The pile is discretized into cylinder and circular elements, {{and the corresponding}} soil is also discretized into {{the elements of the}} same amount and type. The equations of stress and displacements are established for piles and soil, respectively. The beam theory is used to establish the <b>pile</b> <b>equation</b> of stress and displacements, and the fundamental solutions of layered solids are used to establish the <b>pile</b> <b>equation.</b> The global equations for obtaining loads and displacements of pile-foundation interaction are presented by using displacement compatibility. The slipping problem of a pile and foundation is also considered. Finally, three examples of a single pile or pile groups are analyzed to demonstrate this numerical method.

40|$|Pile {{foundations}} are {{the most}} known and used deep foundation technique in civil engineering to support structures. This research treats the problem of dynamic pile loading in both steady state and transient conditions, when a non-axial load is applied at the pile head. The objective of the present research is to investigate the effects of non-axial loading on the dynamic axial pile response. A horizontally coupled axial soil reaction (so-called impedance) is first developed in harmonic loading for a soil disk based on analytical and semi-analytical solutions. Then, coupled soil impedances are introduced into the <b>pile</b> <b>equation</b> of motion to solve the pile-soil vibration problem. It is concluded that the soil disk impedance {{as well as the}} axial pile-soil response in coupled analysis are affected by the lateral load depending on the loading intensity, soil parameters, frequency, etc. Transient pile loading as imposed by high strain dynamic loading tests (a pile driving test) are addressed {{in the second part of}} the thesis. Full-scale pile tests from three sites are considered: Limelette (Belgium), Tessenderlo (Belgium), and Loon-Plage (France), where measurements of axial and flexural pile resistance are presented. An analytical solution and a numerical program to take into account the non-axial pile behaviour are proposed. The analytical solution provides a first indication of the transient pile bending in pile driving. The numerical model (called LPDM for Lateral Pile Driving Model) is more advanced than the proposed analytical solution and gives an insight of the whole problem including non-axial pile head impact, axial and lateral pile and soil vibrations. Finally, the hypoplastic soil model for sandy soils is integrated into LPDM to account for large deformations and non-linear behaviour of the soil. Hypoplastic parameters for Brusselian sand, located in the Limelette site, are calibrated based on advanced laboratory tests. The axial pile response recorded from in-situ pile tests is better fitted by LPDM simulations where both low and high strain behaviour of the soil are well captured. A parametric analysis is also performed to generate axial-lateral interaction diagrams of a soil disk subjected to a pile translation. (FSA - Sciences de l) [...] UCL, 201...|$|E

Rigorous and reliable pile design methods are required to produce designs whose level of safety (probability of failure) is known. By utilizing recently developed, advanced, two-surface plasticity constitutive models, rigorous finite element analyses are conducted. These analyses are for axially loaded single piles and pile groups with several pile-to-pile distances in various group configurations installed in sandy and clayey soil profiles. The analyses {{shed light on the}} relationships between the global response of the pile-soil system (development of shaft and base resistances) and the behavior of local soil elements (e. g., shear band formation). The influence of the group configuration, pile-topile spacing, soil profile, and pile head settlement on the group effects are studied. Mechanisms of pile-soil-pile interactions in pile groups are revealed. Pile efficiencies for individual piles and the overall pile group are reported for use in pile group design. The instrumentation, installation, and static and dynamic testing of a closed-ended, driven pipe pile in Marshall County, Indiana is documented. The test results along with two other case histories are used to verify the new Purdue pile design method.

40|$|Calculation of {{deflections}} for piles loaded {{under both}} axial and lateral loads {{are a key}} component of effective pile design. This thesis presents the solution for the problem of a pile in a multi-layered elastic soil subject to axial loads, lateral loads and moments. The multi-layered soil profile is a continuum following either linear elasticity or nonlinear elasticity. The input parameters needed are the pile geometry, soil profile and the elastic constants of the soil and pile. For nonlinear elastic soil, additional parameters are also required. For a given set of loading conditions, the displacement field at any point in the pile-soil domain can be obtained using principles of continuum mechanics and calculus of variations. An analytical solution for the pile displacements is obtained. Functions varying along the depth and radial direction describe the displacement field in the soil. Using strain-displacement and stress strain relationships, these functions are used to define the strain potential energy of the pile-soil system. Further, through calculus of variations, we get the governing differential equations along with boundary conditions involving these functions. The solution of the boundary-value problem relies on the eigenvalue method for the <b>pile</b> differential <b>equations</b> and on the finite difference method for the soil differential equations. An iterative scheme couples the soil and pile solutions, so that the solution to the problem reflects the interaction between the pile and soil. ...|$|R

40|$|The path {{integral}} {{molecular dynamics}} (PIMD) method provides a convenient way {{to compute the}} quantum mechanical structural and thermodynamic properties of condensed phase systems {{at the expense of}} introducing an additional set of high frequency normal modes on top of the physical vibrations of the system. Efficiently sampling such a wide range of frequencies provides a considerable thermostatting challenge. Here we introduce a simple stochastic path integral Langevin <b>equation</b> (<b>PILE)</b> thermostat which exploits an analytic knowledge of the free path integral normal mode frequencies. We also apply a recently developed colored noise thermostat based on a generalized Langevin equation (GLE), which automatically achieves a similar, frequency-optimized sampling. The sampling efficiencies of these thermostats are compared with that of the more conventional Nosé-Hoover chain (NHC) thermostat for a number of physically relevant properties of the liquid water and hydrogen-in-palladium systems. In nearly every case, the new PILE thermostat is found to perform just as well as the NHC thermostat while allowing for a computationally more efficient implementation. The GLE thermostat also proves to be very robust delivering a near-optimum sampling efficiency in all of the cases considered. We suspect that these simple stochastic thermostats will therefore find useful application in many future PIMD simulations...|$|R
40|$|Pile jacking is a piling {{technique}} {{that provides a}} noise- and vibration-free environment in the construction site. To improve termination criteria for pile jacking and {{to better understand the}} behavior of jacked piles, two steel H piles were instrumented, installed at a weathered soil site, and load tested. A set of termination criteria was applied to the test piles, which includes a minimum blow count from the standard penetration test, a specified final jacking force, a minimum of four loading cycles at the final jack force, and a specified maximum rate of pile settlement at the final jacking force. The two test piles passed all required acceptance criteria. Punching shear failure occurred at the failure load for both piles and the shaft resistance consisted of approximately 80 % of the pile capacity. Based on the results of field tests in Hong Kong and Guangdong and several centrifuge tests, a relation between the ratio of the pile capacity P-ult to the final jacking force P-J and the pile slenderness ratio is established. The P-ult/P-J ratio is larger than 1. 0 for long piles but may be smaller than 1. 0 for short <b>piles.</b> A regression <b>equation</b> is established to determine the final jacking force, which is suggested as a termination criterion for jacked piles.

40|$|Drilled {{displacement}} (DD) piles (commonly {{known as}} „screw piles‟ in Europe) are being increasingly used as foundation elements for structures, particularly in projects requiring accelerated construction or involving {{the rehabilitation of}} foundations of existing, overstressed structures. Different types of DD piles are available in practice; each type is classified according {{to the design of}} the drilling tool and associated installation method. Installation of DD piles causes substantial changes {{in the state of the}} soil surrounding the pile. These changes result from the complex loading imposed on the soil by expansion of a cylindrical cavity to make room for the specially designed drilling tool, by torsional and vertical shearing as the drilling tool gradually moves down into the ground, and by the reversed vertical shearing caused by extraction of the drilling tool from the ground. This report consolidates the information available on DD piling technology, reviews and compares the empirical design methods typically used for these piles, and presents a numerical approach to model the shaft resistance of DD piles in sand. The installation of DD piles produces greater radial displacement of soil than that produced by nondisplacement piles (e. g., drilled shafts), particularly in the case of sandy soils which gain additional strength through densification. This radial displacement of soil around the pile shaft contributes to the high capacity obtained for DD piles. Accordingly, our focus has been on analyzing the shaft resistance of DD piles in sand and proposing a design procedure based on the results of the analyses. The analyses were done using the finite element (FE) method and an advanced constitutive model for sand. The constitutive model captures all the key features required for these analyses, and the FE analyses are 1 D analyses of shaft resistance that can handle the large deformations and displacements involved in <b>pile</b> installation.

40|$|This thesis details {{both the}} {{technical}} and theoretical aspects of performing path integrals through classical Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. In particular, Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) computing is used to augment the Path Integral Molecular Dynamics (PIMD) portion of the widely available Molecular Modelling Tool Kit (MMTK) library. This same PIMD code is also extended in a different direction: a novel method for nuclear ground state property prediction is introduced that closely mimics existing code in functional form. In order to add GPU computing capabilities to the existing MMTK codebase, the open source Open Molecular Mechanics (OpenMM) library was used. OpenMM provides high performance implementations {{of a variety of}} commonly used MD algorithms, with the goal of supporting current and future specialized hardware. Due to the object oriented nature of both codes, and the use of SI units in each, the development process was rather painless. The integration of OpenMM with MMTK is seamless, and arbitrary systems are supported without the user even needing to know that GPU acceleration is being used. The hybrid OpenMM-MMTK code is benchmarked against the vanilla MMTK code in terms of speed and accuracy, and the results show that GPU computing is the obvious choice for PIMD simulations. Starting with a desire to apply the highly efficient Path Integral Langevin <b>Equation</b> (<b>PILE)</b> thermostat to the Path Integral Ground State (PIGS) problem, a new hybrid PILE-PIGS, or LE-PIGS, method was developed. This thesis describes the theoretical justification for this method, including the introduction of a modified normal mode representation based on the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). It is shown that in DCT space, the equations of motion of a PIGS system are virtually identical to the equations of motion of a PIMD system in Fourier space. This leads to direct reuse of existing PILE code in MMTK, and options to extend this ground state problem to OpenMM for the purpose of GPU acceleration.

40|$|Pile jacking is a piling {{method that}} {{provides}} a noise- and vibration-free environment in the construction site. In this thesis, field tests and centrifuge tests were conducted to improve termination criteria for pile jacking {{and understanding of the}} behavior of jacked piles. In the field test, four steel H-piles were instrumented, installed and load tested at a weathered soil site. A set of termination criteria proposed by the Housing Authority was applied to the test piles. These criteria include a minimum SPT blow count of 120, a specified final jacking force, a minimum of four loading-unloading cycles at the final jack force, and a specified maximum rate of pile settlement at the final jacking force. All of the four test piles passed the required acceptance criteria. Punching shear failure occurred at the failure load of RJP- 1 and PP 1 B 1 - 6 piles. The shaft resistance of the piles contributed to approximately 80 % of the pile capacity. Based on the field tests, loading and unloading cycles do not have significant effects on the capacity for these long piles. In the centrifuge, two series of tests were conducted to investigate the effect of pile penetration on the ratio of final jacking force PJ to required pile capacity Pult, which is defined by Davisson's criterion (1972), and the effect of the number of loading-unloading cycles at the final jacking force to the pile behaviour. Based on the results of the field and centrifuge tests and data collected from a large number of field tests in Guangdong, China, a relation between the PJ/Pult ratio and the pile slenderness ratio is established. The PJ/Pult ratio is smaller than 1. 0 for long piles but is larger than 1. 0 for short <b>piles.</b> A regression <b>equation</b> is established to determine the final jacking force with a given slenderness ratio.

40|$|Even {{though for}} most {{hydraulic}} and geotechnical structures clear guidelines are available, those for flexible dolphins are still missing. Consequently, whether a design is safe is usually subject of debate. Economical dolphin piles are large diameter tubular piles, susceptible to local buckling. After installation the embedded {{part of these}} piles remains predominantly filled with soil. The aim {{of this research is}} to provide understanding of the effects concerning local buckling and therewith to contribute to the discussion whether a dolphin design is safe. The main research question is: Does the soil in dolphin piles contribute to the local buckling resistance and can this be used in the design of these piles? Gresnigt (1986) prescribes a strain based method to check a pile on local buckling. This method is incorporated in EN 1993 - 4 - 3 (2009). The resistance against local buckling depends on the slenderness ratio De/(tε 2). Also, ovalisation influences the resistance. The presence of a soil plug reduces the ovalisation, enhancing the local buckling resistance. An analytical method is proposed in which beam theory is used to determine the dolphin pile deformation and loads on the <b>pile.</b> Literature provides <b>equations</b> to calculate the ovalisation that can be applied in three distinct parts: above the bed level, between the bed level and plug level and below the plug level. The provided equations however, show inconsistencies at the transitions. It is proposed to apply beam theory on the pile wall, modelled as a linear beam with springs providing resistance against ovalisation. Above the plug level, the resistance is provided by the ring behaviour of the shell. Below the plug level, the stiffness is increased with the stiffness of the soil plug. The model overcomes the inconsistencies in ovalisation. The method assumes the stiffness of the plug in the pile can be approximated. However, it is concluded that the suggested stiffness in CUR 211 E (2013) is not able to determine the plug stiffness for semi-filled piles. Key parameters that affect the local buckling resistance are identified. These are the plug packing, plug level, slenderness ratio and the soil packing. The influence of these key parameters are studied with the finite element program Abaqus. The parametric study proves that the soil in dolphin piles contributes to the local buckling resistance. A denser packing of the plug improves the capacities of the bending moment and lateral load. Most of all, the dolphin can dissipate more energy. The plug level influences the level at which local buckling is observed, as well as whether an inward or outward buckle occur. The contribution of the inner soil on the local buckling resistance can be compensated by designing a more slender dolphin pile. A more slender cross-section reduces the capacities of the pile. The packing of the outer soil also influences the buckling level and shape. Furthermore, a looser soil packing improves the energy capacity of the dolphin pile. To obtain a dolphin pile that optimises the improvements on the local buckling resistance by the inner and surrounding soil, an installation method is used that does not compact the soil and plug packing and after installation, the plug packing is compacted. With the Abaqus analyses the stiffness of the soil plug is studied. It reveals that the plug is stiffer at deeper levels. For a pile with a diameter comparable to 914 mm, when the predicted ovalisation for that pile without a soil plug is less than 8 mm, a plug stiffness of 30, 000 kN/m 2 can be assumed in the proposed analytical method, regardless of the plug packing. The stiffness is independent of the slenderness ratio. The Port of Rotterdam facilitated a full scale field test with eight piles. The Abaqus model shows reasonable comparison with the field test.

40|$|Driven steel H-piles are {{commonly}} used in Hong Kong as the foundation to support structures. These piles are traditionally installed with termination criteria derived from Hiley's formula. However, the assumptions in Hiley's formula are not suitable for long piles. In this research, the application of wave equation analysis in deriving termination criteria for long steel H-piles founded in granitic saprolites was studied and implemented. A methodology to develop final set tables for long driven <b>piles</b> using wave <b>equation</b> analysis was outlined. To verify the performance of piles final set using the wave equation approach, two preliminary piles, PP- 1 A 2 - 2 and PP- 1 B 3 - 1, were installed based on the new termination criteria. Dynamic and static load tests were carried out on these two piles to confirm the adequacy of pile capacity. Both the pile settlement values at twice the design load and the residual settlement values were well below allowable limits. Hence, the proposed methodology can provide a cost-effective yet safe solution to long piles. Soil parameters for wave equation analyses of driven piles in 6 types of common soils in Hong Kong were also derived from a comprehensive correlation study. With these parameters, final set tables for piles of different lengths can be developed for pile construction. A Hong Kong Driven Pile Database was developed in this project using Microsoft Access. The database contains information of over 1500 piles, with complete records of 308 static load tests, 1276 dynamic tests and 257 CAPWAP analyses. It {{is one of the}} largest databases for steel H-piles in the world. To assist pile design in future projects, comprehensive searching functions are developed and demonstrated with design examples. Using the piling data in the database, the reliability of pile capacity prediction by various dynamic methods was evaluated. It is found that Hiley's formula generally underestimates the capacity of long piles. The predictions from Case's method and CAPWAP analysis are less scattered but these methods also underestimate the pile capacity. An evaluation study on 348 cases of steel H-piles founded on saprolites was also conducted to study the accuracy of driving stress predictions by the methods proposed by ICE (1954) and Bowles (1988), and by wave equation analysis. It is found that the wave equation analysis gives the best predictions among the three methods. The mean and standard deviation of the measurement-to-prediction ratio are 0. 98 and 0. 085, respectively. The load transfer in 14 instrumented long piles founded in granitic saprolites was also studied. The distributions of shaft resistance with depth were developed and the characteristics of the mobilization of both toe and shaft resistances were also studied. The Beta values and toe capacity factor Nq for granitic saprolites were back calculated. For Beta values, the mean is 0. 63 while the standard deviation is 0. 38. For toe capacity factor Nq, the mean and standard deviation are 98 and 50, respectively. Local movements of 3. 3 - 8. 3 % of pile diameter are required for substantial mobilization of the toe resistance. For substantial mobilization of shaft resistance, local movements of 1. 0 - 8. 0 % of pile diameter are required. These values are in a wider range than those for concrete piles. The pile capacity changes with time after construction, which is referred to as pile setup. The setup effect of steel H-piles founded in granitic saprolites, however, has not been sufficiently studied in the literature. In this project, the setup effect was studied through a series of dynamic tests and static load tests carried out on piles PP- 1 B 3 - 1 and PP- 1 A 2 - 2 up to 106 days after the end of driving. Setup in shaft resistance was observed while relaxation occurred at the pile toe. The setup factor Ai for completely decomposed granite was evaluated. The mean of Ai is 0. 58, which is slightly higher than those reported by Bullock et al. (2005), based on relatively short concrete piles in sand and clay. The setup factor tends to decrease with depth...|$|R
