5000|$|The B Reactor had {{its first}} nuclear chain {{reaction}} in September, 1944, the D Reactor in December 1944 and the F Reactor in February 1945. The reactor produced plutonium-239 by irradiating uranium-238 with neutrons {{generated by the}} nuclear reaction. It {{was one of three}} reactors [...] - [...] along with the D and F reactors [...] - [...] built about six miles (10 km) apart on the south bank of the Columbia River. Each reactor had its own auxiliary facilities that included a river pump house, large storage and settling basins, a filtration plant, large motor-driven <b>pumps</b> <b>for</b> <b>delivering</b> water to the face of the pile, and facilities for emergency cooling in case of a power failure.|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectivesOpen {{inguinal}} hernia repair {{is one of}} the most painful procedures in day surgery. A continuous ambulatory analgesic is thought to reduce postoperative pain when it is applied to the surgical site. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of local anesthetic infusion pump following open {{inguinal hernia}} repair for the reduction of postoperative pain. MethodsWe conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that have investigated the outcomes of using an infusion <b>pump</b> <b>for</b> <b>delivering</b> a local anesthetic contrasted to a control group for open inguinal hernia repair. Pain was assessed from Day 1 to Day 5 following the surgery. The secondary outcomes included analgesia use and postoperative complications. ResultsWe reviewed 5 trials that totaled 288 patients. The analgesic effects of bupivacaine (4 trials) and ropivacaine (one trial) were compared with a placebo group. The pooled mean difference in the score measuring the degree of pain diminished significantly at Day 1 to Day 4 in the experimental group. Two studies have reported that the number of analgesics required also decreased in the experimental group. No bupivacaine-related complication was reported. ConclusionOur results revealed that applying a local anesthetic infusion pump following inguinal hernia repairs was more efficacious for reducing postoperative pain than a placebo. However, the findings were based on a small body of evidence in which methodological quality was not high. The potential benefits of applying a local anesthetic infusion pump to hernia repair must still be adequately investigated using further RCTs...|$|R

40|$|A very {{promising}} concept for small range extenders (peak power less than 40 kW) {{is represented by}} the 2 -stroke, direct injection spark ignition engine, with scavenging and exhaust ports controlled by the piston, and an external pump. The most important issue to be addressed on this type of engines is the compliance with stringent rules on pollutant emissions, which depends on combustion patterns {{and the quality of the}} scavenging process. The latter is generally hindered by the symmetry of ports timings, but this handicap can be canceled by adopting a patented rotary valve, controlling the flow through a set of auxiliary transfer ports, and using a piston <b>pump</b> <b>for</b> <b>delivering</b> air to the power cylinder and enhancing the balance of the crankshaft. The paper reviews the design of a virtual engine, rated at 35 kW at 5600 rpm, and developed according to the above mentioned concepts. Design has been driven by CFD simulation, using, whenever possible, experimentally calibrated numerical models, or experimental information derived from similar projects. Particular care has been devoted to characterize the scavenging process and the flow patterns within the cylinder and through the ports, analyzing the influence of the rotary induction valve. Engine performance parameters have been predicted by using a well-established commercial software (GT-Power, by Gamma Technologies), while CFD- 3 D analyses have been carried out by means of a customized version of the KIVA- 3 V code. The whole study is conceived as the basis for the construction of a physical prototype. The power target has been virtually achieved with a very light and compact engine (estimated weight without the close-coupled electric motor: 35 kg). A three-way catalyst allows the engine to comply with the most stringent emission regulations, without relevant penalizations on fuel efficiency. Furthermore, the engine can work with lean mixtures, achieving a minimum specific fuel consumption comparable to a current automotive Diesel engine (223 g/kWh). This excellent result is due to the low friction and pumping losses of the 2 -Stroke engine, as well as to the compactness of the combustion chamber and the capability to stratify the charge...|$|R

From definition (2), irrigation efficiency may be expressed as the ratio of crop yield or increase in yield over nonirrigated production to the volume of irrigation water used. For nurseries, yield can be expressed as a number of marketable plants. It should be also noted, that time required to produce a marketable plant may decrease due to efficient irrigation. In this case, a time factor should b...|$|R
