5|$|Hitler's {{policies}} {{resulted in}} the killing of nearly two million non-Jewish Poles, over three million Soviet prisoners of war, communists and other political opponents, homosexuals, the physically and mentally disabled, Jehovah's Witnesses, Adventists, and trade unionists. Hitler did not speak <b>publicly</b> <b>about</b> the killings, and seems never to have visited the concentration camps.|$|E
5|$|In November1906 the American Robert Peary {{returned}} from his latest unsuccessful quest for the North Pole, claiming a new Farthest North of 87°6′—a record disputed by later historians. He immediately began raising funds for a further attempt. In July1907 Dr Frederick Cook, a former shipmate of Amundsen's from Belgica, set off northwards on what was ostensibly a hunting trip but was rumoured to be an attempt on the North Pole. A month later Ernest Shackleton's Nimrod Expedition sailed for Antarctica, while Robert Falcon Scott was preparing a further expedition should Shackleton fail. Amundsen {{saw no reason to}} concede priority in the south to the British, and spoke <b>publicly</b> <b>about</b> the prospects of leading an Antarctic expedition—although his preferred goal remained the North Pole.|$|E
5|$|Speaking <b>publicly</b> <b>about</b> Biko's death, the country's police {{minister}} Jimmy Kruger initially {{implied that}} it had been the result of a hunger strike, a statement he later denied. His account was challenged by some of Biko's friends, including Woods, who said that Biko had told them that he would never kill himself in prison. Publicly, he stated that Biko had been plotting violence, a claim repeated in the pro-government press. South Africa's attorney general initially stated that no one would be prosecuted for Biko's death. Two weeks after the funeral, the government banned all Black Consciousness organisations, including the BCP, which had its assets seized.|$|E

5|$|There were {{issues with}} casting the film. Paramount Studios' deal with William Shatner had ended {{and so the}} first draft of the film did not feature Captain Kirk. He was later added as a new {{contract}} was signed. However, Leonard Nimoy dropped out of the film because he was concerned over potential merchandising after his likeness as Spock was used in a Heineken advertisement without either his permission or an arrangement for royalties. He had refused to speak <b>publicly</b> <b>about</b> the issue, but Shatner explained it in an interview. The situation was eventually resolved and Nimoy signed on to appear in Planet of the Titans.|$|E
5|$|Glenn was {{considered}} an expert in matters {{in science and technology}} due to his background. He was a supporter of continuing the B-1 bomber program, which he considered successful. This conflicted with President Carter's desire to fund the B-2 bomber program. Glenn did not fully support development of the B-2 because he had doubts about the feasibility of the stealth technology. Glenn joined the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 1978. He became the chairman of the East Asian and Pacific Affairs Subcommittee, for which he traveled to Japan, Korea, the Republic of China, and the People's Republic of China. Glenn helped to pass the Taiwan Enabling Act of 1979. In 1979, another dispute Glenn had with President Carter was Glenn's stance on the SALT II treaty. He did not believe that the U.S. had the capability to monitor the Soviet Union accurately enough to verify compliance with the treaty. During the launching ceremony for the , he spoke about his doubts about verifying treaty compliance. First Lady Rosalynn Carter also spoke at the event, during which she criticized Glenn for speaking <b>publicly</b> <b>about</b> the issue. The Senate never ratified the treaty, {{in part because of the}} Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.|$|E
5|$|Hugh Scrutton, a 38-year-old Sacramento, California, {{computer}} store owner, {{was killed}} in 1985 by a nail-and-splinter-loaded bomb placed {{in the parking lot}} of his store. A similar attack against a computer store occurred in Salt Lake City, Utah, on February 20, 1987. The bomb, which was disguised as a piece of lumber, injured Gary Wright when he attempted to remove it from the store's parking lot. The explosion severed nerves in Wright's left arm and propelled more than 200 pieces of shrapnel into his body. Kaczynski's brother, David—who would play a vital role in Kaczynski's capture by alerting federal authorities to the prospect of his brother's involvement in the Unabomber cases—sought out and became friends with Wright after Kaczynski was detained in 1996. David Kaczynski and Wright have remained friends and occasionally speak together <b>publicly</b> <b>about</b> their relationship.|$|E

5|$|In November 1955, a {{grand jury}} {{declined}} to indict Bryant and Milam for kidnapping, despite their own admissions of having taken Till. Mose Wright and {{a young man named}} Willie Reed, who testified to seeing Milam enter the shed from which screams and blows were heard, both testified in front of the grand jury. After the trial, T.R.M.Howard paid the costs of relocating to Chicago for Wright, Reed, and another black witness who testified against Milam and Bryant, {{in order to protect the}} three witnesses from reprisals for having testified. Reed, who later changed his name to Willie Louis to avoid being found, continued to live in the Chicago area until his death on July 18, 2013. He avoided publicity and even kept his history secret from his wife until she was told by a relative. Reed began to speak <b>publicly</b> <b>about</b> the case in the PBS documentary The Murder of Emmett Till aired in 2003.|$|E
5|$|Players cast {{a fishing}} line {{into the ocean}} and use motion {{controls}} to avoid fish as the hook sinks and to catch as many fish as possible as the reel retracts. Players then touch the screen to shoot fish {{out of the sky}} for money that can be spent on upgrades. Nijman developed the idea during a television show about tuna fishermen. The game was first released as Flash game Radical Fishing with the same basic mechanics. A year after Vlambeer began their iOS development, Gamenauts released Ninja Fishing, a clone of the game that hurt Vlambeer morale. The team worked on other games and spoke <b>publicly</b> <b>about</b> the situation to a standing ovation at the 2012 Game Developers Conference before resolving to scrap the majority of their work and finish the game. Artist Greg Wohlwend moved in with iOS developer Zach Gage to work 14-hour days on the game.|$|E
5|$|The {{office of}} {{quaestor}} {{was considered the}} lowest-ranking of all major political offices. Quaestors were elected by the Tribal Assembly, and the assignment of their responsibilities was settled by lot. Magistrates often chose which quaestor accompanied them abroad, and these quaestors often functioned as personal secretaries responsible for the allocation of money, including army pay. Urban quaestors had several important responsibilities, such as {{the management of the}} public treasury, (the aerarium Saturni) where they monitored all items going into, and coming out of, the treasury. In addition, they often spoke <b>publicly</b> <b>about</b> the balances available in the treasury. The quaestors could only issue public money for a particular purpose if they were authorized to do so by the senate. The quaestors were assisted by scribes, who handled the actual accounting for the treasury. The treasury was a repository for documents, as well as for money. The texts of enacted statutes and decrees of the Roman Senate were deposited in the treasury {{under the supervision of the}} quaestors.|$|E

5|$|While Gore {{has criticized}} Bush for his Katrina response, {{he has not}} spoken <b>publicly</b> <b>about</b> his part in the {{evacuation}} of 270 patients on September 3 & 4, 2005, from Charity Hospital in New Orleans to Tennessee. On September 1, Gore was contacted by Charity Hospital's Neurosurgeon Dr. David Kline, who had operated on his son Albert, through Greg Simon of FasterCures. Kline informed Gore and Simon of the desperate conditions {{at the hospital and}} asked Gore and Simon to arrange relief. On Gore's personal financial commitment, two airlines each provided a plane with one flight latter underwritten by Larry Flax. The flights were flown by volunteer airline crews and medically staffed by Gore's cousin, retired Col. Dar LaFon, and family physician Dr. Anderson Spickard and were accompanied by Gore and Albert III. Gore used his political influence to expedite landing rights in New Orleans.|$|E
