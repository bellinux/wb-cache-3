The private bridge developers are Figg Bridge Developers, the company responsible for rebuilding the I-35W bridge over the Mississippi River in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in eleven months following its disastrous collapse in August 2007. Figg Bridge Developers teamed with Britton Hill Partners to provide the necessary financing at no risk {{to any of the}} local or state governmental agencies.

2500|$|The later Roman Empire {{was in a}} sense {{a network}} of cities. Archaeology now {{supplements}} literary sources to document the transformation followed by collapse of cities in the Mediterranean basin. Two diagnostic symptoms of decline— or as many historians prefer, 'transformation'— are subdivision, particularly of expansive formal spaces in both the domus and the public basilica, and encroachment, in which artisanal shops invade the <b>public</b> <b>thoroughfare,</b> a transformation that was to result in the souk. Burials within the urban precincts mark another stage in dissolution of traditional urbanistic discipline, overpowered by the attraction of saintly shrines and relics.

2500|$|In 1891, the Hove Commissioners (who now had civic {{responsibility}} for the square) {{tried to make the}} private road north of the square a <b>public</b> <b>thoroughfare</b> by removing the barriers. [...] Objections from the residents delayed this plan for several years, but the road did eventually open to the public. [...] Accordingly, the land to the north was now considered part of the Palmeira Square area, and the development as a whole consists of two garden squares. [...] The first is the original development bounded to the south by Adelaide Crescent, to the north by the former private road which is now a widened continuation of Western Road and to the west by the 34 houses of the square. [...] The second is the lawned section formed by the junction between the extension of Western Road, Church Road and the connections between them, and all the surrounding buildings of the late 19th century.|$|E

60|$|Him we {{have left}} to his destiny; but whom else have we found? From this the highest apex of things, {{downwards}} through all strata and breadths, how many fully awakened Realities have we fallen in with:--alas, on the contrary, what troops and populations of Phantasms, not God-Veracities but Devil-Falsities, down to the very lowest stratum,--which now, by such superincumbent weight of Unveracities, lies enchanted in St. Ives' Workhouses, broad enough, helpless enough! You will walk in no <b>public</b> <b>thoroughfare</b> or remotest byway of English Existence but you will meet a man, an interest of men, that has given up hope in the Everlasting, True, and placed its hope in the Temporary, half or wholly False. The Honourable Member complains unmusically that there is 'devil's-dust' in Yorkshire cloth. Yorkshire cloth,--why, the very Paper I now write on is made, it seems, partly of plaster-lime well smoothed, and obstructs my writing!

60|$|In {{the very}} heart of the French capital, are the remains of an {{extensive}} palace of one of the Roman Emperors, and yet it may be questioned if one in a thousand, of those who live within a mile of the spot, have the least idea of the origin of the buildings. I have inquired about it, in its immediate neighbourhood, and it was with considerable difficulty I could discover any one who even knew that there was such a ruin at all, in the street. The great number of similar objects, and the habit of seeing them daily, has some such effect on one, as the movement of a crowd in a <b>public</b> <b>thoroughfare,</b> where images pass so incessantly before the eye, as to leave no impression of their peculiarities. Were a solitary bison to scamper through the Rue St. Honoré, the worthy Parisians would transmit an account of his exploits to their children's children, while the wayfarer on the prairies takes little heed of the flight of a herd.|$|E
60|$|Men {{had still}} quite {{recently}} been {{going in and}} out with parcels and packing-cases, rendering the door and hall within like a <b>public</b> <b>thoroughfare.</b> Elizabeth trotted through the open door in the dusk, but becoming alarmed at her own temerity she went quickly out again by another which stood open in the lofty wall of the back court. To her surprise she found herself in one of the little-used alleys of the town. Looking round at the door which had given her egress, {{by the light of the}} solitary lamp fixed in the alley, she saw that it was arched and old--older even than the house itself. The door was studded, and the keystone of the arch was a mask. Originally the mask had exhibited a comic leer, as could still be discerned; but generations of Casterbridge boys had thrown stones at the mask, aiming at its open mouth; and the blows thereon had chipped off the lips and jaws as if they had been eaten away by disease. The appearance was so ghastly by the weakly lamp-glimmer that she could not bear to look at it--the first unpleasant feature of her visit.|$|E

But {{it would seem to me}} that all that is necessary for a noble Museum of the best art should be more or less removed, and that a collection, solely for the purpose of education, and for the purpose of interesting people who do not care much about art, should be provided in the very heart of the population, if possible, that pictures not of great value, but of sufficient value to interest the public, and of merit enough to form the basis of early education, and to give examples of all art, should be collected in the popular Gallery, but that all the precious things should be removed and put into the great Gallery, where they would be safest, irrespectively altogether of accessibility.|$|E

My friend, if thou ever do come to believe in God, thou wilt find all Chartism, Manchester riot, Parliamentary incompetence, Ministries of Windbag, and the wildest Social Dissolutions, and the burning-up of this entire Planet, a most small matter in comparison. Brother, this Planet, I find, is but an inconsiderable sand-grain in the continents of Being: this Planet's poor temporary interests, thy interests and my interests there, when I look fixedly into that eternal Light-Sea and Flame-Sea with its eternal interests, dwindle literally into Nothing; my speech of it is--silence for the while. I will as soon think of making Galaxies and Star-Systems to guide little herring-vessels by, as of preaching Religion that the Constable may continue possible. O my Advanced-Liberal friend, this new second progress, of proceeding 'to invent God,' is a very strange one! Jacobinism unfolded into Saint-Simonism bodes innumerable blessed things; but the thing itself might draw tears from a Stoic!--As for me, some twelve or thirteen New Religions, heavy Packets, most of them unfranked, having arrived here from {{various parts of the}} world, in a space of six calendar months, I have instructed my invaluable friend the Stamped Postman to introduce no more of them, if the charge exceed one penny.|$|E
60|$|The conspirators {{now found}} that it was useless any longer to attempt to conceal their plans. In fact, they were already all exposed, and they knew that William would {{immediately}} summon his troops and come out to seize them. They must, therefore, either fly from the country or attempt an open rebellion. They decided on the latter--the result was a civil war. In the end, William was victorious. He took a large number of the rebels prisoners, and he adopted the following very singular plan for inflicting a suitable punishment upon them, {{and at the same time}} erecting a permanent monument of his victory. He laid out a public road across the country, on the line over which he had been conducted by the sons of Hubert, and compelled the rebels to make it. A great part of this country was low and marshy, and had been for this reason avoided by the public road, which took a circuitous course around it. The rebel prisoners were now, however, set at work to raise a terrace or embankment, on a line surveyed by William's engineers, which followed almost exactly the course of his retreat. The high road was then laid out upon this terrace, and it became immediately a <b>public</b> <b>thoroughfare</b> of great importance. It continued for several centuries one of the most frequented highways in the realm, and was known by the name of the Raised Road--Terre levée--throughout the kingdom. In fact, the remains of it, appearing like the ruins of an ancient rail-road embankment, exist to the present day.|$|E
