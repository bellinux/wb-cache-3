40|$|Abstract In current {{electronic}} commerce systems, customers have an on-line inter-action with merchants via a browser {{on their personal}} computer. Also payment is done electronically via the Internet, mostly with a credit card. In parallel to this, e-services via wireless-only systems are emerg-ing. This paper identi¯es security and functionality weaknesses {{in both of these}} current approaches. The paper discusses why and how general-purpose mobile devices could be used as an extension to PC based sys-tems, to provide more security and functionality. General-purpose mo-bile devices are shown to be an alternative to costly special-purpose hardware. This combined approach has in many cases more interest-ing properties than when using mobile devices only. As an example of the combined approach, a GSM based electronic payment system is proposed and investigated. The system enables users to order goods through the World Wide Web and <b>pay</b> <b>by</b> <b>using</b> their mobile phone...|$|R

The banks are: Allied Bank, Burj Bank, Bank Al Habib, HBL, KASB Bank, MCB Bank, Standard Chartered bank, Summit Bank, Samba Bank, Soneri Bank and UBL. Customers can log on to www.ke.com.pk, the KE official website, anytime and {{from anywhere in the}} world, and <b>pay</b> <b>by</b> <b>using</b> their 13 digit account number. KE customers can also visit their own internet banking page and pay their power bills by entering their 13 digit KE account number. This convenient service saves them from waiting for the printed bill to arrive and physically visiting bank branches and standing in queues. Customers not familiar with online payment, have been offered other value added alternate payment facilities via Easy Paisa outlets, UBL Omni shops and NADRA offices by just presenting their 13 digit account number at a much wider distribution network of these institutions.|$|R

Our study provides a quantitative version of the well known representer theorem and hold both for regression and classification under very mild and natural assumption. 1. Definitions We assume that the pair (x, y) is in Z = X × Y, where X is a compact subset of Rd and Y is a compact subset of R (for regression Y = [a, b], for binary classification Y = {− 1, 1 }). We assume that Z is endowed with a probability measure ρ that can be decomposed {{in the following way}} ρ(y, x) = ν(x) ρx(y), where ν(x) is the marginal probability measure on X and ρx(y) the conditional probability on Y. Let the hypothesis space H be a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) with a continuous kernel K: X × X → R (Aronszajn, 1950). We recall that H is defined as the unique Hilbert space of continuous functions on X such that f(x) = 〈f, Kx〉 H, (1) where, for all x ∈ X, Kx is the function on X defined by Kx(s) = K(x, s). The loss function V (y, f(x)) is the price we are willing to <b>pay</b> <b>by</b> <b>using</b> f(x) to predict the correct label y (see the following for the mathematical properties we assume on V).
