40|$|<b>Tin</b> <b>metal</b> is studied using photoelectrochemistry in IN KOH solution. In {{the passive}} region, {{there are two}} {{distinct}} oxy-hydroxide films on the surface which are stable over different potential r nges. The first oxy-hydroxide film exists at tow positive potentials, can easily be reduced, and is transformed by intense illumination into the more stable oxide. The second oxy-hydroxide film exists at higher positive potentials and is stable under illumination. <b>Tin</b> <b>metal</b> is used in many applications because it has good corrosion resistance and is nontoxic. The corrosion resistance of tin is attributed to a thin protective film of SnO 2 which is formed on the surface.

40|$|With the {{continuously}} increasing {{amount of}} E-waste scrap {{generated in the}} world and the use of lead-free solder materials, it is becoming a critical issue to develop a suitable process for the recovery of precious metals (Cu, Sn and Ag, Au, PGM’s) from the secondary sources. The chemistry of <b>primary</b> <b>tin</b> smelting is principally described by the seven component system SnO-SnO 2 -FeO-Fe 2 O 3 -CaO-Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2, which represents the logical starting point for the development of tin smelting for E-waste. A critical review of the scientific literature available on the experimental phase equilibria of the tin-containing systems has shown that the phase equilibria in these systems are not well defined. In particular further experimental data are required to fully characterise this system at tin-iron alloy saturation and at fixed oxygen partial pressures. The high vapour pressures of tin species under tin smelting conditions necessitate the use of improved experimental methodologies to determine the phase equilibria in tin-containing systems. In the present study, the primary phase substrate support techniques combined with the use of the electron X-ray microprobe analysis have been used, and phase equilibrium investigations and liquidus determinations have been carried out on the following systems (the notation “SnO” and “FeO” are used here to indicate that tin and iron species are present in these systems in more than one oxidation state) : 1) “SnO”-Sn 2) “SnO 2 ”-CaO-SiO 2 in air 3) “SnO”-SiO 2 in equilibrium with <b>tin</b> <b>metal</b> 4) “SnO”-CaO-SiO 2 in equilibrium with <b>tin</b> <b>metal</b> 5) “SnO”-“FeO” in equilibrium with Sn-Fe alloy 6) “SnO”-SiO 2 -“FeO” in equilibrium with Sn-Fe alloy 7) “SnO”-SiO 2 -“FeO” in equilibrium with Sn-Fe alloy, tridymite and at fixed oxygen partial pressures at 1473 K The experimental data obtained in the present study have been presented in the form of the new phase diagrams in the tin-containing systems and provide the basis for the development of slag system for the treatment of E-waste. These fundamental data also provide experimental information that can be used in the determination of thermodynamic databases with which to characterise phase relations over a wide range of compositions important to recover the electronic waste and the industrial tin smelting processes...|$|R

40|$|This work {{characterizes the}} analog {{performance}} of SOI n-MuGFETs with HfSiO gate dielectric and <b>TiN</b> <b>metal</b> gate {{with respect to}} the influence of the high-k post-nitridation. TiN thickness and device rotation. A thinner <b>TiN</b> <b>metal</b> gate is found favorable for improved analog characteristics showing an increase in intrinsic voltage gain. The devices where the high-k material is subjected to a nitridation step indicated a degradation of the Early voltage (V(EA)) values which resulted in a lower voltage gain. The 45 degrees rotated devices have a smaller V(EA) than the standard ones when a HfSiO dielectric is used. However, the higher transconductance of these devices, due to the increased mobility in the (1 0 0) sidewall orientation, compensates this V(EA) degradation of the voltage gain, keeping it nearly equal to the voltage gain values of the standard devices.

40|$|This work {{studies the}} gate-induced drain leakage (GIDL) in p- and n-MuGFET {{structures}} with different <b>TiN</b> <b>metal</b> gate thickness and high-k gate dielectrics. As {{a result of}} this analysis, it was observed that a thinner <b>TiN</b> <b>metal</b> gate showed a larger GIDL due to the different gate oxide thickness and a reduced metal gate work function. In addition, replacing SiON by a high-k dielectric (HfSiON) results for nMuGFETs in a decrease of the GIDL On the other hand, the impact of the gate dielectric on the GIDL for p-channel MuGFETs is marginal. The effect of the channel width was also studied, whereby narrow fin devices exhibit a reduced GIDL current in spite of the larger vertical electric field expected for these devices. Finally, comparing the effect of the channel type, an enhanced GIDL current for pMuGFET devices was observed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. CAPESCAPESCNPq/FWOCNPq/FWOFAPESPFAPES...|$|R
