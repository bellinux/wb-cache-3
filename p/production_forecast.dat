40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{determine}} whether smoothing in USDA corn and soybean <b>production</b> <b>forecasts</b> is concentrated in years with relatively small and large crops. The sample consists of all USDA corn and soybean <b>production</b> <b>forecasts</b> released over the 1970 through 2006 crop years. Results show that USDA crop <b>production</b> <b>forecasts</b> in both corn and soybeans have a marked tendency to decrease in small crop years and increase in big crop years. The magnitude of smoothing is surprisingly large, with corn and soybean <b>production</b> <b>forecasts</b> cumulatively revised downward by about 6 to 7 percent in small crop years and upward by about 5 to 6 percent in large crop years. Crop condition ratings are useful in predicting whether the current year is likely to be a small, normal, or big crop year.

50|$|In {{order to}} {{illustrate}} this electricity market mechanism, let us consider the Dutch electricity market. Market participants, referred to as Program Responsible Parties (PRPs), submit their price-quantity bids before 11 am for the delivery period covering the following day from midnight to midnight. The Program Time Unit (PTU) on the balancing market is of 15 minutes. Balancing of the 15-minute averaged power is required from all electrical producers and consumers connected to the grid, who for this purpose may be organised in sub-sets. Since these sub-sets {{are referred to as}} Programmes, balancing on the 15-minute scale is referred to as Programme Balance. Programme Balance now is maintained by using the production schedules issued the day before delivery and measurement reports (distributed the day after delivery). When the measured power is not equal to the scheduled power, the Programme Imbalance is the difference between the realised sum of production and consumption and the forecast sum of production and consumption. If only production from wind energy is taken into account, Programme Imbalance reduces to realised wind production minus forecast wind production. The programme imbalance is the wind <b>production</b> <b>forecast</b> error.|$|E
40|$|Accurate and {{reliable}} <b>production</b> <b>forecasting</b> {{is certainly a}} significant step for the management and planning of the petroleum reservoirs. This paper presents a new neural approach called higher-order neural network (HONN) to <b>forecast</b> the oil <b>production</b> of a petroleum reservoir. In HONN, the neural input variables are correlated linearly as well as nonlinearly, which overcomes the limitation of the conventional neural network. Hence, HONN is a promising technique for petroleum reservoir <b>production</b> <b>forecasting</b> without sufficient network training data. A sandstone reservoir located in Gujarat, India was chosen for simulation studies, to prove the efficiency of HONNs in oil <b>production</b> <b>forecasting</b> with insufficient data available. In order to reduce noise in the measured data from the oil field a pre-processing procedure that consists of a low pass filter was used. Also an autocorrelation function (ACF) and cross-correlation function (CCF) was employed for selecting the optimal input variables.

Residents instead received food ration tickets (15-17 kilos of grain per month for each man, 13.75 kg for each woman, 12.75 kg for young adults, 3.75 kg for children under age 10). Due to bullish grain <b>production</b> <b>forecast,</b> winter wheat was not planted in 1958 leaving no harvest in the spring of 1959.

40|$|Minimizing the {{mismatch}} in {{the output of}} a petroleum reservoir model to 4 D seismic data {{has the potential to}} increase its <b>production</b> <b>forecast</b> accuracy. However, the impact of 4 D seismic data on the economic value of improved reservoir management decisions enforced during the <b>production</b> <b>forecast</b> has not been quantified. This work investigates the potential net present value (NPV) of an oil field production strategy, optimized on models conditioned to 4 D seismic data, production data, or both data, controlling the <b>production</b> <b>forecast</b> in a method of adjoint-based assisted history matching and model-based optimization. Applying independent porosity updates in AHM might result in geologically unrealistic parameters; therefore this work applies customized gradients to update the permeability field and dependent on that the porosity field honoring a porosity permeability relation. The method is tested on a 3 D synthetic oil model, and repeated by starting on nine prior models, which results in an average gain in the achieved NPV with respect to the prior models of 6. 45 %, 7. 04 %, and 7. 96 %, based on assimilating respectively 4 D seismic data, production data, or the combined data set into the prior model after five years of historical production. This gain in NPV is lost when the workflow is postponed by five years. This implies that the moment of applying the proposed method can be essential to the achieved gain in economic value. This work also illustrates that the accuracy of the model to predict liquid rates during both the historical production and the <b>production</b> <b>forecast</b> is increased by assimilating the combined data set.

40|$|Probabilistic decline curve {{analysis}} (PDCA) {{methods have}} been developed to quantify uncertainty in <b>production</b> <b>forecasts</b> and reserves estimates. However, the application of PDCA in shale gas reservoirs is relatively new. Limited work has been done on the performance of PDCA methods when the available production data are limited. In addition, PDCA methods have often been coupled with Arp?s equations, which might not be the optimum decline curve analysis model (DCA) to use, as new DCA models for shale reservoirs have been developed. Also, decline curve methods are based on production data only and do not by themselves incorporate other types of information, such as volumetric data. My research objective was to integrate volumetric information with PDCA methods and DCA models to reliably quantify the uncertainty in <b>production</b> <b>forecasts</b> from hydraulically fractured horizontal shale gas wells, regardless of the stage of depletion. In this work, hindcasts of multiple DCA models coupled to different probabilistic methods were performed to determine the reliability of the probabilistic DCA methods. In a hindcast, only a portion of the historical data is matched; predictions are made {{for the remainder of the}} historical period and compared to the actual historical production. Most of the DCA models were well calibrated visually when used with an appropriate probabilistic method, regardless of the amount of production data available to match. Volumetric assessments, used as prior information, were incorporated to further enhance the calibration of <b>production</b> <b>forecasts</b> and reserves estimates when using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) as the PDCA method and the logistic growth DCA model. The proposed combination of the MCMC PDCA method, the logistic growth DCA model, and use of volumetric data provides an integrated procedure to reliably quantify the uncertainty in <b>production</b> <b>forecasts</b> and reserves estimates in shale gas reservoirs. Reliable quantification of uncertainty should yield more reliable expected values of reserves estimates, as well as more reliable assessment of upside and downside potential. This can be particularly valuable early in the development of a play, because decisions regarding continued development are based to a large degree on <b>production</b> <b>forecasts</b> and reserves estimates for early wells in the play...|$|R

40|$|Producing oil and {{gas from}} {{increasingly}} more difficult reservoirs has become an unavoidable challenge for the petroleum industry as the conventional hydrocarbon resources are {{no longer able to}} maintain the production levels corresponding to the global energy demand. As the industrial investments in developing lower-permeability reservoirs increase and more advanced technologies such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing gain more attention and applicability, the need for more reliable means of <b>production</b> <b>forecasting</b> also become more noticeable. <b>Production</b> <b>forecasting</b> of hydraulically fractured wells is challenging particularly for heterogeneous reservoirs where the rock properties vary dramatically over short distances, significantly affecting the performance of the wells. Despite the recent improvements in well performance prediction, the issue of heterogeneity and its effects on well performance have not been thoroughly addressed by the researchers and many aspects of heterogeneity have yet remained unnoticed. In this paper, a novel empirical approach for <b>production</b> <b>forecasting</b> of multi-fractured horizontal wells is presented in attempt to effectively include the effect of heterogeneity. This approach is based on the integration of hyperbolic Decline Curve Analysis (DCA) and heterogeneity impact factor (HIF). This newly-defined ratio quantifies the heterogeneity impact on the hydraulically fractured well performance and is calculated based on net-pressure match interpretation and post-fracture well test analysis. The proposed approach of decline curve using heterogeneity impact factor (DCH) is validated against data from a Southern North Sea field. The results show a maximum of 15 % difference between the outcome of the proposed method and the most detailed three-dimensional history-matched model, for a 15 -year period of <b>production</b> <b>forecasts.</b> DCH is a novel, fast, and flexible method for making reliable well performance predictions for hydraulically fractured wells and can be used in forecasting undrilled wells and the range of possible outcomes caused by the heterogeneity...|$|R
