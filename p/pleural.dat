5|$|A {{pneumothorax}} (collapsed lung) is {{an abnormal}} collection of {{air in the}} <b>pleural</b> space that causes an uncoupling of the lung from the chest wall. The lung cannot expand against the air pressure inside the <b>pleural</b> space. An easy to understand example is a traumatic pneumothorax, where air enters the <b>pleural</b> space from outside the body, as occurs with puncture to the chest wall. Similarly, a scuba diver ascending while holding their breath with their lungs fully inflated can cause air sacs (alveoli) to burst and leak high pressure air into the <b>pleural</b> space.|$|E
5|$|Pleurodesis is a {{procedure}} that permanently eliminates the <b>pleural</b> space and attaches the lung to the chest wall. No long-term study (20 years or more) has been performed on its consequences. Good results {{in the short term}} are achieved with a thoracotomy (surgical opening of the chest) with identification of any source of air leakage and stapling of blebs followed by pleurectomy (stripping of the <b>pleural</b> lining) of the outer <b>pleural</b> layer and <b>pleural</b> abrasion (scraping of the pleura) of the inner layer. During the healing process, the lung adheres to the chest wall, effectively obliterating the <b>pleural</b> space. Recurrence rates are approximately 1%. Post-thoracotomy pain is relatively common.|$|E
5|$|The {{thoracic}} cavity is the space inside the chest {{that contains the}} lungs, heart, and numerous major blood vessels. On {{each side of the}} cavity, a <b>pleural</b> membrane covers the surface of lung (visceral pleura) and also lines the inside of the chest wall (parietal pleura). Normally, the two layers are separated by a small amount of lubricating serous fluid. The lungs are fully inflated within the cavity because the pressure inside the airways is higher than the pressure inside the <b>pleural</b> space. Despite the low pressure in the <b>pleural</b> space, air does not enter it because there are no natural connections to an air-containing passage, and the pressure of gases in the bloodstream is too low for them to be forced into the <b>pleural</b> space. Therefore, a pneumothorax can only develop if air is allowed to enter, through damage to the chest wall or damage to the lung itself, or occasionally because microorganisms in the <b>pleural</b> space produce gas.|$|E
5|$|The {{function}} of the lungs can also be affected by compression from fluid in the <b>pleural</b> cavity <b>pleural</b> effusion, or other substances such as air (pneumothorax), blood (hemothorax), or rarer causes. These may be investigated using a chest X-ray or CT scan, and may require the insertion of a surgical drain until the underlying cause is identified and treated.|$|E
5|$|The cephalic {{molluscs}} {{have two}} pairs of main nerve cords organized around a number of paired ganglia, the visceral cords serving the internal organs and the pedal ones serving the foot. Most pairs of corresponding ganglia {{on both sides of}} the body are linked by commissures (relatively large bundles of nerves). The ganglia above the gut are the cerebral, the <b>pleural,</b> and the visceral, which are located above the esophagus (gullet). The pedal ganglia, which control the foot, are below the esophagus and their commissure and connectives to the cerebral and <b>pleural</b> ganglia surround the esophagus in a circumesophageal nerve ring or nerve collar.|$|E
5|$|Diagnosis of a {{pneumothorax}} {{by physical}} examination alone {{can be difficult}} (particularly in smaller pneumothoraces). A chest X-ray, computed tomography (CT) scan, or ultrasound is usually used to confirm its presence. Other conditions that can result in similar symptoms include a hemothorax (buildup {{of blood in the}} <b>pleural</b> space), pulmonary embolism, and heart attack. A large bullae may look similar on a chest X-ray.|$|E
5|$|Performing a chest {{radiograph}} {{is one of}} {{the first}} investigative steps if a person reports symptoms that may suggest lung cancer. This may reveal an obvious mass, widening of the mediastinum (suggestive of spread to lymph nodes there), atelectasis (collapse), consolidation (pneumonia) or <b>pleural</b> effusion. CT imaging is typically used to provide more information about the type and extent of disease. Bronchoscopy or CT-guided biopsy is often used to sample the tumor for histopathology.|$|E
5|$|Tension {{pneumothorax}} {{occurs when}} the opening that allows air to enter the <b>pleural</b> space functions as a one-way valve, allowing more air to enter with every breath but none to escape. The body compensates by increasing the respiratory rate and tidal volume (size of each breath), worsening the problem. Unless corrected, hypoxia (decreased oxygen levels) and respiratory arrest eventually follow.|$|E
5|$|The abdomen is {{the largest}} tagma of the insect, which {{typically}} consists of 11–12 segments and is less strongly sclerotized than the head or thorax. Each segment of the abdomen is represented by a sclerotized tergum and sternum. Terga are separated {{from each other and}} from the adjacent sterna or pleura by membranes. Spiracles are located in the <b>pleural</b> area. Variation of this ground plan includes the fusion of terga or terga and sterna to form continuous dorsal or ventral shields or a conical tube. Some insects bear a sclerite in the <b>pleural</b> area called a laterotergite. Ventral sclerites are sometimes called laterosternites. During the embryonic stage of many insects and the postembryonic stage of primitive insects, 11 abdominal segments are present. In modern insects there is a tendency toward {{reduction in the number of}} the abdominal segments, but the primitive number of 11 is maintained during embryogenesis. Variation in abdominal segment number is considerable. If the Apterygota are considered to be indicative of the ground plan for pterygotes, confusion reigns: adult Protura have 12 segments, Collembola have 6. The orthopteran family Acrididae has 11 segments, and a fossil specimen of Zoraptera has a 10-segmented abdomen.|$|E
5|$|Water-soluble {{compounds}} of yttrium {{are considered}} mildly toxic, while its insoluble compounds are non-toxic. In experiments on animals, yttrium {{and its compounds}} caused lung and liver damage, though toxicity varies with different yttrium compounds. In rats, inhalation of yttrium citrate caused pulmonary edema and dyspnea, while inhalation of yttrium chloride caused liver edema, <b>pleural</b> effusions, and pulmonary hyperemia.|$|E
5|$|A less {{invasive}} {{approach is}} thoracoscopy, {{usually in the}} form of a procedure called video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). The results from VATS-based <b>pleural</b> abrasion are slightly worse than those achieved using thoracotomy in the short term, but produce smaller scars in the skin. Compared to open thoracotomy, VATS offers a shorter in-hospital stays, less need for postoperative pain control, and a reduced risk of lung problems after surgery. VATS may also be used to achieve chemical pleurodesis; this involves insufflation of talc, which activates an inflammatory reaction that causes the lung to adhere to the chest wall.|$|E
5|$|A {{pneumothorax}} is {{an abnormal}} collection of {{air in the}} <b>pleural</b> space between the lung and the chest wall. Symptoms typically include sudden onset of sharp, one-sided chest pain and shortness of breath. In a minority of cases the amount of air in the chest increases when a one-way valve is formed by an area of damaged tissue, leading to a tension pneumothorax. This condition can cause a steadily worsening oxygen shortage and low blood pressure. Unless reversed by effective treatment, it can result in death. Very rarely both lungs may be affected by a pneumothorax. It is often called a collapsed lung, although that term may also refer to atelectasis.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, it was {{determined}} that the rhesus monkey kidney cells used to prepare the poliovirus vaccines were infected with the SV40 virus (Simian Virus-40). SV40 was also discovered in 1960 and is a naturally occurring virus that infects monkeys. In 1961, SV40 was found to cause tumors in rodents. More recently, the virus was found in certain forms of cancer in humans, for instance brain and bone tumors, <b>pleural</b> and peritoneal mesothelioma, and some types of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. However, it has not been determined that SV40 causes these cancers.|$|E
5|$|On November 3, 2017, Paul was {{assaulted}} by a neighbor, Rene Boucher (aged 59), a former anesthesiologist. As Paul was wearing noise-cancelling headphones while mowing his lawn, Boucher {{was able to}} surprise him. Boucher was arrested by state troopers and charged with one count of fourth degree assault and released on a $7,500 bond. Initial announcements stated that Paul suffered only minor injuries but subsequent news reports said he sustained five broken ribs and lacerations to his lungs. Some sources later stated that six ribs had been broken and that <b>pleural</b> effusion had set in. Three of the ribs were displaced fractures.|$|E
5|$|Pausch was {{diagnosed}} with pancreatic cancer and underwent a Whipple procedure (pancreaticoduodenectomy) on September 19, 2006, in an unsuccessful attempt to halt the disease. He was told in August 2007 to expect a remaining {{three to six months}} of good health. He soon moved his family to Chesapeake, Virginia, a suburb of Norfolk, to be close to his wife's family. On March 13, 2008, Pausch advocated for greater federal funding for pancreatic cancer before the United States Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies. In the week prior to this, he had been hospitalized in order to have needle aspiration of <b>pleural</b> effusion in his right lung.|$|E
5|$|Pneumothorax was {{described}} in 1803 by Jean Marc Gaspard Itard, a student of René Laennec, who provided an extensive description of the clinical picture in 1819. While Itard and Laennec recognized that some cases were not due to tuberculosis (then the most common cause), the concept of spontaneous pneumothorax {{in the absence of}} tuberculosis (primary pneumothorax) was reintroduced by the Danish physician Hans Kjærgaard in 1932. In 1941, the surgeons Tyson and Crandall introduced <b>pleural</b> abrasion for the treatment of pneumothorax.|$|E
5|$|The third {{mechanism}} {{occurs when}} the chest is compressed from front to back, causing it to widen from side to side. The lungs adhere to the chest wall because of the negative pressure {{between them and the}} <b>pleural</b> membranes lining the inside of the chest cavity; thus when the chest widens, they are pulled apart. This creates tension at the carina; the airway tears if this tensile force exceeds its elasticity. This mechanism may be the cause of injury when the chest is crushed. Most TBI are probably due to a combination of these three mechanisms.|$|E
5|$|Traumatic {{pneumothorax}} {{most commonly}} {{occurs when the}} chest wall is pierced, such as when a stab wound or gunshot wound allows air to enter the <b>pleural</b> space, or because some other mechanical injury to the lung compromises {{the integrity of the}} involved structures. Traumatic pneumothoraces have been found to occur in up to half of all cases of chest trauma, with only rib fractures being more common in this group. The pneumothorax can be occult (not readily apparent) in half of these cases, but may enlarge - particularly if mechanical ventilation is required. They are also encountered in patients already receiving mechanical ventilation for some other reason.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{physical}} examination, {{breath sounds}} (heard with a stethoscope) may be diminished on the affected side, partly because {{air in the}} <b>pleural</b> space dampens the transmission of sound. Measures of the conduction of vocal vibrations {{to the surface of}} the chest may be altered. Percussion of the chest may be perceived as hyperresonant (like a booming drum), and vocal resonance and tactile fremitus can both be noticeably decreased. Importantly, the volume of the pneumothorax can show limited correlation with the intensity of the symptoms experienced by the victim, and physical signs may not be apparent if the pneumothorax is relatively small.|$|E
5|$|A small {{spontaneous}} pneumothorax will typically resolve without treatment and requires only monitoring. This approach {{may be most}} appropriate in {{people who have no}} underlying lung disease. In a larger pneumothorax, or if there is shortness of breath, the air may be removed with a syringe or a chest tube connected to a one-way valve system. Occasionally, surgery may be required if tube drainage is unsuccessful, or as a preventive measure, if there have been repeated episodes. The surgical treatments usually involve pleurodesis (in which the layers of pleura are induced to stick together) or pleurectomy (the surgical removal of <b>pleural</b> membranes). About 17–23 cases of pneumothorax occur per 100,000 people per year. They are more common in men than women.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} change detectable on laboratory investigations {{is a low}} {{white blood}} cell count, which may then be followed by low platelets and metabolic acidosis. A moderately elevated level of aminotransferase (AST and ALT) from the liver is commonly associated with low platelets and white blood cells. In severe disease, plasma leakage results in hemoconcentration (as indicated by a rising hematocrit) and hypoalbuminemia. <b>Pleural</b> effusions or ascites can be detected by physical examination when large, but the demonstration of fluid on ultrasound may assist in the early identification of dengue shock syndrome. The use of ultrasound is limited by lack of availability in many settings. Dengue shock syndrome is present if pulse pressure drops to ≤20mmHg along with peripheral vascular collapse. Peripheral vascular collapse is determined in children via delayed capillary refill, rapid heart rate, or cold extremities. While warning signs are an important aspect for early detection of potential serious disease, the evidence for any specific clinical or laboratory marker is weak.|$|E
5|$|The {{sedentary}} {{habits of}} the bivalves have meant that in general the nervous system is less complex than in most other molluscs. The animals have no brain; the nervous system consists of a nerve network {{and a series of}} paired ganglia. In all but the most primitive bivalves, two cerebropleural ganglia are {{on either side of the}} oesophagus. The cerebral ganglia control the sensory organs, while the <b>pleural</b> ganglia supply nerves to the mantle cavity. The pedal ganglia, which control the foot, are at its base, and the visceral ganglia, which can be quite large in swimming bivalves, are under the posterior adductor muscle. These ganglia are both connected to the cerebropleural ganglia by nerve fibres. Bivalves with long siphons may also have siphonal ganglia to control them.|$|E
5|$|Parasitologist John Kinsella {{compared}} the endoparasites of marsh rice rats in a saltwater marsh at Cedar Key and a freshwater marsh at Paynes Prairie, both in Florida, in a 1988 study. He found {{a total of}} 45species, a number unequaled in rodents. This {{may be related to}} the diverse habitats the rice rat uses and to its omnivorous diet; it eats a variety of animals which may serve as intermediate hosts of various parasites. The endoparasites in the saltwater marsh were dominated by trematodes (flukes), and those of the freshwater marsh by nematodes (roundworms). Endoparasites were found in the gastric mucosa (which lines the stomach), the cavity of the stomach, the small intestine, the cecum, the large intestine, the pancreatic duct, the bile ducts, the mucus of the liver, the pulmonary arteries, the abdominal cavity, and the <b>pleural</b> cavity. While the marsh rice rat harbors a number of host-specific species, such as the nematode Aonchotheca forresteri, other parasite species, such as the lone star tick (pictured), are shared with other mammals. Compared to the hispid cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus), Florida marsh rice rats usually harbor fewer individual ectoparasites of each species. Borrelia, the bacterium that causes Lyme disease, has been identified in some ticks that infect the marsh rice rat and it has been identified as a possible natural reservoir for Borrelia.|$|E
25|$|A transudate {{is defined}} as <b>pleural</b> fluid to serum total protein ratio of less than 0.5, <b>pleural</b> fluid to serum LDH ratio < 0.6, and {{absolute}} <b>pleural</b> fluid LDH < 200 IU or < 2/3 of the normal.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pleural</b> {{effusion}} and empyema: Microorganisms {{from the}} lung may trigger fluid {{collection in the}} <b>pleural</b> cavity. If the microorganisms are in the fluid, the collection is an empyema. If <b>pleural</b> fluid is present, it should be collected with a needle and examined. Depending on the results, complete drainage of the fluid with a chest tube may be necessary. If the fluid is not drained, bacteria may continue to proliferate because antibiotics do not penetrate the <b>pleural</b> cavity well.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pleural</b> effusions {{may occur}} with cancer, sarcoid, {{connective}} tissue diseases and lymphangioleiomyomatosis. The {{presence of a}} <b>pleural</b> effusion argues against pneumocystis pneumonia.|$|E
25|$|Locoregional – Gerota's fascia sign (thickening of {{inflamed}} Gerota's fascia, {{which becomes}} visible), pancreatic ascites, <b>pleural</b> effusion (seen on basal cuts of the <b>pleural</b> cavity), adynamic ileus, etc.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} causes of <b>pleural</b> effusions are cancer, {{congestive}} heart failure, pneumonia, and recent surgery. In countries where tuberculosis is common, {{this is also}} a common cause of <b>pleural</b> effusions.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pleural</b> {{thickening}} {{may cause}} blunting of the costophrenic angle, but is distinguished from <b>pleural</b> fluid {{by the fact}} that it occurs as a linear shadow ascending vertically and clinging to the ribs.|$|E
25|$|A high amylase level (twice the {{serum level}} or the {{absolute}} value is greater than 160 Somogy units) in the <b>pleural</b> fluid is indicative of either acute or chronic pancreatitis, pancreatic pseudocyst that has dissected or ruptured into the <b>pleural</b> space, cancer or esophageal rupture.|$|E
25|$|Clinical {{aspects of}} {{pulmonary}} and <b>pleural</b> carcinoma in Nigeria.|$|E
25|$|Cytology is an {{important}} tool in identifying effusions due to malignancy. The most common causes for <b>pleural</b> fluid are lung cancer, metastasis from elsewhere and <b>pleural</b> mesothelioma. The latter often presents with an effusion. Normal cytology results do not reliably rule out malignancy, but make the diagnosis more unlikely.|$|E
25|$|Postcoronary {{bypass surgery}} with {{violation}} of <b>pleural</b> spaces.|$|E
25|$|Fluid {{in space}} between the lung and the chest wall is termed a <b>pleural</b> effusion. There needs {{to be at least}} 75ml of <b>pleural</b> fluid in order to blunt the costophrenic angle on the lateral chest radiograph, and 200ml on the posteroanterior chest radiograph. On a lateral decubitus, amounts as small as 50ml of fluid are possible. <b>Pleural</b> effusions {{typically}} have a meniscus visible on an erect chest radiograph, but loculated effusions (as occur with an empyema) may have a lenticular shape (the fluid making an obtuse angle with the chest wall).|$|E
25|$|When {{cardiopulmonary}} {{status is}} compromised (i.e. when the fluid or air has its repercussions on {{the function of}} heart and lungs), due to air (significant pneumothorax), fluid (<b>pleural</b> fluid) or blood (hemothorax) outside the lung, then this procedure is usually replaced with tube thoracostomy, the placement of a large tube in the <b>pleural</b> space.|$|E
25|$|Decubitus – taken {{while the}} patient is lying down, {{typically}} on his side. useful for differentiating <b>pleural</b> effusions from consolidation (e.g. pneumonia) and loculated effusions from free fluid in the <b>pleural</b> space. In effusions, the fluid layers out (by comparison to an up-right view, when it often accumulates in the costophrenic angles).|$|E
