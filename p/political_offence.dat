It was {{not only}} that the tidings which she heard of Ludovic were hard to bear, but it seemed that Herr Molk was intent on ranging himself altogether with her enemies respecting Peter Steinmarc. In fact, the old man's advice to her respecting Peter was more important in her mind that his denunciation of Ludovic. She did not quite credit what he said of Ludovic. It was doubtless true that Ludovic was in prison; probably for some <b>political</b> <b>offence.</b> But such men, she thought, were not kept in prison long. It was bad, this fact of her lover's imprisonment; but not so bad as the advice which her counsellor gave her, and which she knew she would be bound to repeat to her aunt.|$|E

[Came 8th October, went 21st (OEuvres de Frederic, xxvii. part 3d, p. 98).] Stanislaus has abundance of useless refugee Polish Magnates about him, with their useless crowds of servants, and no money in pocket; Konigsberg all on flutter, with their draperies and them, [...] "like a little Warsaw:" [...] so that Stanislaus's big French pension, moderate Prussian monthly allowance, and all resources, are inadequate; and, in fact, in the end, these Magnates had to vanish, many of them, without settling their accounts in Konigsberg. [History of Stanislaus. ] For the present they wait here, Stanislaus and they, till Fleury and the Kaiser, shaking the urn of doom in abstruse treaty after battle, decide what is to become of them.|$|E

60|$|Differences {{that might}} easily become serious speedily arose upon {{details in the}} minds of two or three of them, and for some days the prime {{minister}} regarded the undertaking as not only difficult but perilous. Sir Charles Wood, in cabinet (April 11), strongly disapproved of the extension of income-tax to Ireland, and to the lowering of the exemption line. On Ireland the plan would lay {{more than half a million}} of new taxation, whereas much of the relief, such as soap and assessed taxes, would not touch her.[287] Palmerston thought it a great plan, perfectly just, and admirably put together, only it opened too many points of attack, and it could never be carried: Disraeli was on the watch, the Irish would join him, so would the radicals, while the succession duty, to which Palmerston individually had great objection, would estrange many conservatives. Lord John Russell perceived difficulties, but he did not see an alternative. Graham then fell in, disliked the twofold extension of the income-tax, and thought they should only take away half the soap-tax. Lord Lansdowne (a great Irish landlord) agreed with him. Mr. Gladstone told them that he was willing to propose whatever the cabinet might decide on, except one thing, namely, the breaking up of the basis of the income-tax: that he could not be a party to; he should regard it as a high <b>political</b> <b>offence.</b> With this reservation he should follow their judgment, but he strongly adhered to his whole plan. Lord Aberdeen said, 'You must take care your proposals are not unpopular ones.' Mr. Gladstone replied that it was after applying the test of popularity, that he was convinced the budget would be damaged beforehand by some of the small changes that had been suggested.|$|E
6000|$|The traitor sold Him to the Sanhedrim, or council, {{in which}} the last words of the prophecy through the Priesthood had {{declared}} that one man must die for the people; and a band of Roman soldiers was obtained from Pilate. Meanwhile, our blessed Lord instituted the new Passover, the Communion by which all the faithful should be enabled to partake of the great Sacrifice; then He {{went out to the}} garden, among the grey olives which still stand beside the brook Kedron, and there, after His night of Agony, He was betrayed by a kiss, and dragged before the High Priest, under an accusation of blasphemy; but as the Sanhedrim had not power of life and death, and such a charge would have mattered little to a Roman, a <b>political</b> <b>offence</b> was invented to bring before Pilate. The procurator perceived the innocence of the Holy One, but feared to befriend Him because of the raging multitude; and after vainly trying to shift the responsibility on Herod Antipas, he washed his hands, to show that it was no affair of his own, and gave the Victim up to the murderers. They chose the most shameful death of Roman slaves, that they might show their hatred and contempt, unwitting that each act and each word had been foretold and foreshown in their own Law and Prophets. For six hours He hung on His Cross, while the sun was dark, and awe crept on the most ignorant hearts. Then came the cry, [...] "It is finished;" [...] and the work was done; the sinless Sacrifice had died; the price of Adam's sin was paid; the veil of the Temple was rent in twain, to show that the way to the true Mercy-Seat was opened. The rich man buried Him--the women watched; and when the Sabbath was over, the Tomb was broken through, and the First-fruits of them that slept arose, wondrously visited His followers for forty days, gave them His last charges, and then ascended into Heaven, carrying manhood to the bosom of the Father. Satan was for ever conquered.|$|E

50|$|Criminal {{responsibility}} is considered personal, therefore collective punishments are not recognized.

50|$|Throughout {{the twentieth}} century, world events forced governments {{to examine the}} concept of the <b>political</b> <b>offence</b> {{exception}} more closely, first in the 1920s and 1930s as clashing fascists and communists used methods that could be described in modern parlance as terrorism to promote their respective political aims, then after World War II as both war criminals and collaborators with occupation governments sought with much success to protect themselves behind the shield of <b>political</b> <b>offence</b> exceptions, and further into the 1960s and 1970s with members of national liberation and anti-colonialist movements whose proponents acclaimed them as freedom fighters while detractors labelled them terrorists.

5000|$|U.S. courts also {{follow the}} [...] "rule of non-inquiry", under which {{consideration}} of the political motivations of the requesting party is a matter left to {{the discretion of the}} executive branch as part of its power to conduct foreign relations. In the 1980s, extradition treaties with Mexico and the Netherlands made the entire question of what constitutes a <b>political</b> <b>offence</b> a question for the executive branch, which was described as [...] "the death knell" [...] for the <b>political</b> <b>offence</b> exception in U.S. law. Legislation around the same time proposed by Representative William J. Hughes (D-NJ) and Senator Strom Thurmond (R-SC) also attempted to develop more detailed and stringent guidelines for the <b>political</b> <b>offence</b> exception in an effort to prevent terrorists from taking recourse to it, but did not pass. This was followed by signing of a Supplementary Treaty between the United Kingdom and the United States in 1985, which sharply contracted the definition of a <b>political</b> <b>offence</b> with the aim of curbing Provisional Irish Republican Army members' recourse to this provision; it was the first U.S. treaty to contain such an exception. Christopher Blakesley described this as [...] "evisceration" [...] of the exception.|$|E

50|$|The 1977 European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism {{was more}} {{successful}} at limiting {{the scope of}} the <b>political</b> <b>offence</b> exception; in its first article, it provided a long list of offences which could not be regarded as political offences, including not just the traditional clause d'attentat, but also kidnapping, hostage taking, and the use of bombs and firearms where the use endangered lives. Article 13 permits contracting states to register reservations to Article 1 and thus to preserve their domestic law <b>political</b> <b>offence</b> exceptions, but, for example, the United Kingdom elected not to do so. Article 11 of the International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings also provided that offences covered by that convention could not be regarded as political offences for the purpose of refusing an extradition request. The 2004 implementation of the European Arrest Warrant system entirely removed the <b>political</b> <b>offence</b> exception to extradition among member states of the European Union.|$|E

5000|$|Under , {{both the}} {{judiciary}} of Hong Kong and the Chief Executive are empowered {{to determine that}} an offence is [...] "of a political character" [...] and thus that a person should not be surrendered. It {{was a matter of}} some debate among Hong Kong and mainland scholars whether or not Hong Kong's agreement with mainland China regarding the cross-boundary surrender of fugitive offenders should also include a <b>political</b> <b>offence</b> exception. Since the 1997 transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong, Hong Kong and mainland China are both part of the same country, and opponents of adding a <b>political</b> <b>offence</b> exception argued that it was only meant to apply among different sovereigns and not different territories of the same sovereign. One example given in this regard was the arrangement among the states of the United States, in particular the Extradition Clause which contains no exception for political offences and specifically names treason as a crime for which an interstate fugitive must be delivered upon demand. However, proponents of adding a <b>political</b> <b>offence</b> exception argued that the principle of one country, two systems meant that Hong Kong should have the right not to surrender fugitive offenders for political offences, and to prosecute such offences under laws it passes on its own.|$|E
