They were much weaker than the strikes of 1980 and were {{discontinued}} after the intervention by Wałęsa, who secured the regime's commitment to begin negotiations with the opposition. The strikes were the last act of active political involvement of the working class in the history of People's Poland and were led by young workers, not connected to Solidarity veterans and opposed to socially harmful consequences of the economic restructuring in progress at that time. According to the researcher Maciej Gdula, the political activity that followed was conducted exclusively by the elites. It was neither inspired by nor consulted with any mass social organization or movement, as the opposition leading circles freed themselves from their strong in the <b>past</b> <b>commitment</b> to the welfare of working people. No longer secure as undisputed leaders, Polish dissidents of the KOR-Solidarity generations were eager to bargain with the weakened regime whose economic goals they now shared.|$|R

40|$|In public {{university}} setting, whether trust in supervisor would attenuate the relationship justice and commitment is not certain. In addition, <b>past</b> <b>commitment</b> research focused on organizational commitment, but neglected the foci of commitment. This {{study investigated the}} moderating role of trust in supervisor in the relation of distributive justice, procedural justice, and interactional justice with foci commitment (commitment to school, commitment to supervisor, and commitment to colleagues). It was expected that the relationships between three types of justice and foci commitment were weaker for those with high trust in their supervisor. This study uses teachers in public universities as the research sample, collects data by questionnaire survey, and analyzes data through hierarchical moderator regression. This study finds that whether trust in supervisor has the attenuating effect for the influence of justice on commitment depends {{on the type of}} justice and commitment.

40|$|The {{current study}} adopts an {{innovative}} {{approach to the}} study of time and organizational commitment, examines commitment as a process that unfolds and changes over time, and illuminates how different components of organizational commitment operate both similarly and distinctly. Past research has found that, in a downsizing organization, employees will recall having experienced greater organizational <b>commitment</b> in the <b>past</b> than they had actually reported experiencing at the time (Kwong & Hamilton, 2004). In contrast, we examine employee recall of <b>past</b> organizational <b>commitment</b> in a growing organization. Further, we consider employee recall for three specific components of organizational commitment: affective, normative, and continuance. A randomly selected cohort of employees at a growing technology company reported their organizational commitment at Time 1. Then at Time 2, 36 months later, they recalled their <b>past</b> organizational <b>commitment.</b> Consistent with study hypotheses, at Time 2, employees recalled having had significantly lower overall organizational commitment than they reported at Time 1. Specifically, employees recalled significantly lower overall, affective, and normative organizational commitment. In contrast, and consistent with research findings in social cognition, participants accurately recalled their level of continuance commitment. Analyses of other variables supported the findings by indicating that continuance commitment was not the only aspect of work that could be accurately recalled, and by showing that other potential moderators, including participant age, sex, education, commitment to work and family life, and ability to balance commitments to work and family life, were not responsible for the results. Taken together, the robust findings suggest (1) that the growth trajectory of an organization (i. e., growing versus downsizing) may be a key moderator of employee recall of <b>past</b> organizational <b>commitment</b> and (2) recall of continuance commitment may act independently of recall of affective and normative commitment. Future directions and implications of the findings for organizational commitment theory and organizational attachment research more generally are discussed. ...|$|R

Applying our results to Aumann’s Stag Hunt game we find that communication is useless if talk is about commitments, while the efficient outcome is selected if talk is about intentions.

In the United States, the younger voting-age population in 1990 compared to 1965 accounts for the observed decline in the relative capital tax rate between those two years.

40|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that leaders of democratic states experience high costs from violating <b>past</b> <b>commitments.</b> We argue that because democratic leaders foresee {{the costs of}} violation, they are careful to design agreements they expect {{to have a high}} probability of fulfilling. This may cause democratic leaders to prefer flexible or limited commitments. We evaluate our argument by analyzing the design of alliance treaties signed by countries of the world between 1815 and 2003. We find that alliances formed among democratic states are more likely to include obligations for future consultation rather than precommitting leaders to active conflict, and defense pacts formed among democratic states are more likely to specify limits to the conditions under which member states must join their partners in conflict. This research {{suggests that}} separating screening effects and constraining effects of international agreements is even more difficult than previously believed.

40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} finding suitable agents to collaborate with for a given interaction in distributed open systems, such as multiagent and P 2 P systems. The agent in question is {{given the chance to}} describe its confidence in its own capabilities. However, since agents may be malicious, misinformed, suffer from miscommunication, and so on, one also needs to calculate how much trusted is that agent. This article proposes a novel trust model that calculates the expectation about an agent's future performance in a given context by assessing both the agent's willingness and capability through the semantic comparison of the current context in question with the agent's performance in past similar experiences. The proposed mechanism for assessing trust may be applied to any real world application where <b>past</b> <b>commitments</b> are recorded and observations are made that assess these commitments, and the model can then calculate one's trust in another with respect to a future commitment by assessing the other's past performance. © 2013 ACM 2157 - 6904 / 2013 / 12 -ART 5 $ 15. 00.

40|$|How do voters {{respond when}} {{politicians}} change positions over time? The answer {{is fundamental to}} understanding candidate competition, election outcomes, and representation in democracies. If voters react negatively to repositioning, they could deter leaders from adapting to shifts in public opinion or the arrival of new policy-relevant information. The existence of penalties for repositioning could also contribute to polarization and legislative gridlock. Elected officials might not compromise with opponents out of concern that voters—including some who actually agree with {{the content of the}} compromise—would punish them for veering from <b>past</b> <b>commitments.</b> Finally, if voters held incumbents to past positions, even when such positions no longer appealed to the median voter, challengers could win without taking centrist positions themselves. Thus, punishing politicians for changing course could be detrimental to democracy. Forgiving candidates for policy reversals would bring its own problems, however. Without penalties for repositioning, politicians would have little incentive to speak honestly. They could say almost anything during campaigns, knowing that voters would excuse them for reneging on commitments. Under such circumstances voters would find it extremely difficult to learn who represents their views. Advertisements, speeches, and policy manifestos woul...|$|E
40|$|This {{experiment}} tested predictions {{derived from}} a social contingency model of judgment and choice that identifies 3 distinctive strategies that people rely on in dealing with demands for accountability from important interpersonal or institutional audiences. The model predicts that (a) when people know {{the views of the}} audience and are unconstrained by <b>past</b> <b>commitments,</b> they will rely on the low-effort acceptability heuristic and simply shift their views toward those of the prospective audi-ence, (b) when people do not know the views of the audience and are unconstrained by past commit-ments, they will be motivated to think in relatively flexible, multidimensional ways (preemptive self-criticism), and (c) when people are accountable for positions to which they feel committed, they will devote the majority of their mental effort to justifying those positions (defensive bolstering). The experiment yielded results supportive of these 3 predictions. The study also revealed some evidence of individual differences in social and cognitive strategies for coping with accountability. Many writers have criticized cognitive social psychology for its apparent indifference to the interpersonal and institutional settings within which people make judgments and choices (e. g., Gergen, 1982; Sampson, 1981).
