Besides toning the face, some <b>powders</b> with sunscreen can also reduce skin damage from sunlight and environmental stress.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} master thesis {{project was}} to {{statistically}} correlate various <b>powder</b> characteristics {{to the quality of}} additively manufactured parts. An additional goal of this project was to find a potential second source supplier of <b>powder</b> for GKN Aerospace Sweden in TrollhÃ¤ttan. Five InconelÂ® alloy 718 <b>powders</b> from four individual <b>powder</b> suppliers have been analyzed in this project regarding <b>powder</b> characteristics such as: morphology, porosity, size distribution, flowability and bulk properties. One <b>powder</b> out of the five, <b>Powder</b> C, is currently used in production at GKN and functions as a reference. The five <b>powders</b> were additively manufactured by the process of laser metal deposition according to a pre-programmed model utilized at GKN Aerospace Sweden in TrollhÃ¤ttan. Five plates were produced per <b>powder</b> and each cut to obtain three area sections to analyze, giving a total of fifteen area sections per <b>powder.</b> The quality of deposited parts was assessed by means of their porosity content, <b>powder</b> efficiency, geometry and microstructure. The final step was to statistically evaluate the results through the analysis methods of Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and simple linear regression with the software Minitab. The method of ANOVA found a statistical significant difference between the five <b>powders</b> regarding their experimental results. This made it possible to compare the five <b>powders</b> against each other. Statistical correlations by simple linear regression analysis were found between various <b>powder</b> characteristics and quality of deposited part. This led to the conclusion that GKN should consider additions to current <b>powder</b> material specification by <b>powder</b> characteristics such as: particle morphology, <b>powder</b> porosity and flowability measurements by a rheometer. One <b>powder</b> was found to have the potential of becoming a second source supplier to GKN, namely <b>Powder</b> A. <b>Powder</b> A had overall good <b>powder</b> properties such as smooth and spherical particles, high particle density at 99, 94 % and good flowability.
