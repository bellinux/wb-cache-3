25|$|Evolutionary {{psychology}} is a theoretical {{approach in the}} social and natural sciences that examines <b>psychological</b> <b>structure</b> from a modern evolutionary perspective. It seeks to identify which human psychological traits are evolved adaptations – that is, the functional products of natural selection or sexual selection in human evolution. Adaptationist thinking about physiological mechanisms, such as the heart, lungs, and immune system, is common in evolutionary biology. Some evolutionary psychologists apply the same thinking to psychology, arguing that the modularity of mind {{is similar to that of}} the body and with different modular adaptations serving different functions. Evolutionary psychologists argue that much of human behavior is the output of psychological adaptations that evolved to solve recurrent problems in human ancestral environments.|$|E

Rewards await." [...] In his review on RogerEbert.com, Brian Tallerico praised the series for its focus on character, especially by having none of its characters [...] "defined by their powers or their relation to a villain". He felt that the performances of Stevens and Keller were especially strong, but did think that the series took itself too seriously at times, lacking some of the humor usually found {{in the works of}} Hawley and Marvel. David Wiegand for the San Francisco Chronicle called Legion the best series of the new year, and praised the [...] "resolutely novelistic" [...] approach from Hawley. Wiegand felt, [...] "It would be facile to say Legion is a comic book show for people who don’t like comic book shows. At the same time, it does have a far more complex thematic and <b>psychological</b> <b>structure</b> than most comic book shows." [...] He praised the cast, especially Stevens, who he said [...] "simply does the best work of his career".|$|E

These dyads are elements of <b>psychological</b> <b>structure.</b> In borderline pathology, the lack of integration of the internal object relations dyads corresponds to a 'split' <b>psychological</b> <b>structure</b> in which totally negative representations are split off/segregated from idealized positive representations of self and other (seeing people as all good or all bad).

In practice the distinctions between physical and psychological torture are often blurred. Physical torture is the inflicting of severe pain or suffering on a person.

Torturers often inflict both types of torture in combination to compound the associated effects.|$|R

Cattell authored, co-authored, or edited almost 60 scholarly books, more than 500 research articles, and over 30 standardized psychometric tests, questionnaires, and rating scales. [...] According to a widely cited ranking, Cattell was the 16th most eminent, 7th most cited in the scientific journal literature, and among the most productive, but controversial psychologists of the 20th century.|$|E

5000|$|Information {{metabolism}} is {{a psychological}} theory of human social interactions {{based on information}} processing, proposed by Kępiński. The most detailed description of information metabolism concept is given in his book [...] "Melancholy". In this model, the living organism is considered as an open system {{in the sense of}} Bertalanffy. Living beings are characterized by negentropy as their functioning results in thermodynamically ordered structures. The body itself retains the same basic structure, although its building elements (molecules) are replaced quite frequently. The energy derived from food and oxygen is spent on securing the integrity of the organism. To refer to the exchange of energy between the organism and its surroundings, Kępiński used the term [...] "energy metabolism". Any activity of the body is an informational sign to other beings, and also for our own psyche. The perception of our own activities and those occurring in the external world, may be seen as information input to the psyche. The psyche can be seen as information-processing unit, with its reactions being the information outputs. As emhpasized by Kępiński, <b>psychological</b> <b>structure</b> of an individual remains relatively stable despite an ongoing exchange of information, analogically to the physical structure subject to energy metabolism. In his books, Kępiński explained various mental conditions as disorders and imbalances of the information metabolism.|$|E

5000|$|Child Identity is {{not only}} a <b>psychological</b> <b>structure,</b> but also a complex subject of {{contemporary}} humanitarian science. Identity formation is a complex process that is never completed. When we research the problems of identity we want to answer questions 'Who we are?', 'Do we choose our identity?', 'Is identity given to us or do we create our own?', etc. In a world of change, children are faced with many questions and struggles as they sort out their multiple identities. Children begin to ask identity questions at an early age. Who am I? Who is my family? Where do I belong? Why does my family celebrate some holidays and not others? These are all standard questions children ask to determine how they fit into their world. [...] Erik Erikson (1902-1994) became one of the earliest psychologists to take an explicit interest in problem of child identity. The child identity is a complex socio-cultural phenomenon, which includes a variety of representations of a child about themselves, about the world, about his place in this world. The Child Identity is a dynamic construct that is rapidly changing {{under the influence of the}} environment, education and family. In childhood, identity is a dependent phenomenon, there are a lot of the unconscious factors are affecting to behavior patterns, relationships child with world. Child Identity formed under influence of various factors and stereotypes.|$|E
