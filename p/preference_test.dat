40|$|Replicated or {{multiple}} <b>preference</b> <b>tests</b> have become important tools for assessing consistency in consumer <b>preferences</b> in repeated <b>tests</b> {{as well as}} overall consumer <b>preference.</b> Replicated <b>preference</b> <b>tests</b> can also provide the means for separating discriminators from non-discriminators. Despite the increasing popularity of multiple <b>preference</b> <b>tests,</b> there are few statistical tools for their analysis, especially when one is interested in assessing the consistency of consumer preferences. This paper presents flexible Bayesian methods for examining overall consumer preference and consistency of consumer preference in replicated <b>preference</b> <b>tests.</b> In particular, this paper presents Bayesian methods for forced-choice <b>preference</b> <b>testing</b> with two tests and then extends this methodology to include forced-choice <b>preference</b> <b>testing</b> with more than two <b>tests</b> and replicated <b>preference</b> <b>testing</b> with a no-preference or no-choice option.

50|$|In 1959, Welsh {{developed}} the Welsh Figure <b>Preference</b> <b>Test,</b> as {{a modified version}} of the non-verbal MMPI. The purpose of this test was to measure or predict creativity. Similar to the non-verbal MMPI, this test consisted of 400 black and white figures, which participants were to indicate which ones they liked and disliked. Welsh classified these various figures as “creative,” meaning they were complex and asymmetric, and “not creative,” meaning they were simple and symmetric. Liking more creative pictures was thought to be indicative of a more creative personality.The next step was the creation of the Barron-Welsh art scale.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>preference</b> <b>test</b> is an {{experiment}} in which animals are allowed free access to multiple environments which differ {{in one or more}} ways. Various aspects of the animal's behaviour can be measured with respect to the alternative environments, such as latency and frequency of entry, duration of time spent, range of activities observed, or relative consumption of a goal object in the environment. These measures can be recorded either by the experimenter or by motion detecting software. Strength of preference can be inferred by the magnitude of the difference in the response, but see [...] "Advantages and disadvantages" [...] below. Statistical testing is used to determine whether observed differences in such measures support the conclusion that preference or aversion has occurred. Prior to testing, the animals are usually given the opportunity to explore the environments to habituate and reduce the effects of novelty.|$|E
5000|$|Lobel & Menashri (1993) explores how the {{rigidity}} {{of gender}} schemas guides behavior. The population of interest consisted of preschool children selected {{from three different}} preschools in Tel-Aviv, Israel, and the study focused {{on the relationship between}} the children's gender-typed toy choice, their frameworks regarding cross-gender behavior, and their concepts of gender constancy. During the procedure, two feminine and two masculine toys were presented to individual children: a visibly new doll, a tattered, old doll, a shiny new truck, and an old, faded truck. Based on a pretest, the dolls and trucks were clearly recognized as feminine and masculine, as well as attractive and unattractive based on their quality. All children preferred the new toy when presented with a pair of singularly gendered toys. Children were first given a toy <b>preference</b> <b>test,</b> then a gender constancy interview, and then a gender-role norms interview. The results indicate that children with a more flexible view on gender-role norms made fewer gender-typed choices than children with rigid norms. Similarly, for children with more flexible gender norms, attractiveness of the toy proved to be more strongly related to preference than the toy's adherence to a traditional gender-role. This result begs the question: from where does this flexibility in gender behavior come? The authors favor the explanation that parental norms play a large role, but insist that further research must be done. Echoing Serbin et al. (2001), they also assert that a certain level of cognitive ability must be reached in order to demonstrate flexibility in gender roles, otherwise conceptions of fundamental gender constancy could become confused with external objects associated with a traditional gender role.|$|E

40|$|There is a {{substantial}} amount of evidence to support the concept, that animals are capable of choosing a balanced diet.

40|$|Abstract. Priming {{effects in}} perceptual tests of {{implicit}} memory {{are assumed to}} be perceptually specific. Surprisingly, changing object colors from study to test did not diminish priming in most previous studies. However, these studies used implicit tests that are based on object identification, which mainly depends on the analysis of the object shape and therefore operates color-independently. The present study shows that color effects can be found in perceptual implicit tests when the test task requires the processing of color information. In Experiment 1, reliable color priming was found in a mere exposure design (<b>preference</b> <b>test).</b> In Experiment 2, the <b>preference</b> <b>test</b> was contrasted with a conceptually driven color-choice test. Altering the shape of object from study to test resulted in significant priming in the color-choice test but eliminated priming in the <b>preference</b> <b>test.</b> Preference judgments thus largely depend on perceptual processes. In Experiment 3, the preference and the color-choice test were studied under explicit test instructions. Differences in reaction times between the implicit and the explicit test suggest that the implicit test results were not an artifact of explicit retrieval attempts. In contrast with previous assumptions, it is therefore concluded that color is part of the representation that mediates perceptual priming...|$|E

The data collected from 17 adults with a profound learning disability and high support needs was analysed using the city block metric to permit informal statements about the trends within the data.

The results suggest that the use of systematic <b>preference</b> <b>testing</b> without previous training has limited application within this population. There is a tentative suggestion that embedded preference observations may be more widely accessible for this population. However, there is not a measurement of embedded observations validity within this study.
