5|$|Elections {{are governed}} by the State Electoral Commission and electoral boards. Members of those bodies are {{required}} to have a university degree in law, {{and they may not}} be members of any political party. The State Electoral Commission prepares and manages elections in accordance with legislation, appoints lower-ranking election-commission and board members, issues directives to such bodies and supervises their work. The State Electoral Commission compiles and publishes candidate lists, supervises the legality of political campaigns and compiles and publishes election results. All members of election boards (or their legal deputies) must be present at assigned polling stations at all times while the <b>polling</b> <b>station</b> is open. The board verifies the identity of voters against the list of registered voters and records the turnout. The turnout number is later checked against number of votes cast; if the number of votes exceeds the turnout, the election at that <b>polling</b> <b>station</b> must be repeated. Votes are tallied by hand, and that information is forwarded (along with all other records kept at the <b>polling</b> <b>station)</b> to the State Electoral Commission.|$|E

2500|$|Observers {{from the}} European Union {{afterwards}} [...] "assessed the closing and counting processes negatively in {{almost half of}} urban <b>polling</b> <b>stations</b> observed, a very high figure for international observers to record, and even worse in rural <b>polling</b> <b>stations</b> observed." [...] Counting was slow, a remarkably high number of ballots were ruled invalid, {{and there was a}} lack of transparency in the results. [...] "Result sheets were only displayed at 29 per cent of rural <b>polling</b> <b>stations</b> observed and 36 per cent of urban <b>polling</b> <b>stations</b> observed at the completion of counting. In 25 per cent of <b>polling</b> <b>stations</b> observed, political party representatives were not provided with a copy of the results." ...|$|R

5|$|All officers, clerks, interpreters, {{candidates}} and candidates' agents at polling stations must maintain the secrecy of voting in stations. Before the poll is closed, {{they must not}} communicate to anyone the name of any elector who has not yet voted or his or her or identification number on the electoral register. They are prohibited from communicating information obtained during the counting of votes as to which candidate has been voted for in any particular ballot paper. Furthermore, no person is allowed {{to try to find}} out from within a <b>polling</b> <b>station</b> who a voter intends to vote for or has voted for, or to communicate with a voter after he has been given a ballot paper but before he has placed it in a ballot box.|$|E
5|$|After {{the poll}} closes, the {{presiding}} officer of each <b>polling</b> <b>station</b> seals the ballot boxes without opening them. Candidates or their polling agents may affix their own seals to the ballot boxes. The ballot boxes are then taken to counting centres {{to be opened}} and the ballots counted. A candidate or his or her counting agent may ask the returning officer for a recount of votes if {{the difference between the}} number of votes for the candidate with the most votes and any other candidate's number of votes is 2% or less, excluding rejected and tendered votes. After all counts, and recounts if any, have been completed, the returning officer ascertains whether the total number of electors registered to vote overseas is less than the difference between the number of votes for the two candidates with the highest number of votes. If so, the returning officer declares the candidate with the highest number of votes to be elected as President. If not, the overseas votes may be decisive. The returning officer then states the number of votes cast for each candidate and the date and location where the overseas votes will be counted.|$|E

5|$|An {{additional}} eight {{members of}} the parliament are elected from the twelfth constituency. It encompasses the entire country; candidates in this constituency are elected by voters belonging to 22 recognized minorities in Croatia: the Serb minority elects three MPs, the Hungarians and Italians elect one MP each, the Czech and Slovak minorities jointly elect one MP, and all other minorities elect the final two MPs. Minority MPs are elected by simple plurality system (candidates with the most number of votes are elected). The nationality of the voters is listed in the voter registry, which {{is provided by the}} registrar's office that maintains Croatia's vital records. Voter nationalities are normally officially declared by the parents at birth, but any citizen may declare or change that information later on at the registrar's office at least 14 days ahead of elections (not at the <b>polling</b> <b>station).</b> The voter's nationality need not be declared or may be declared as unknown. During elections, voters who have officially declared they belong to one of the recognized minorities in Croatia may choose to vote for either a territorially applicable list or a corresponding national minority list; a voter of unknown or non-declared nationality may vote for either a territorially applicable list or any minority list; a voter who has declared a nationality other than Croat or a recognized minority may vote only for a territorially applicable list (the same as someone who has declared themselves a Croat).|$|E
5|$|The {{applicant}} for {{an election}} {{to be avoided}} may ask for a declaration that the election is void, that a particular candidate was wrongfully declared to have been elected, and/or that another candidate was duly elected. The applicant may also request for a scrutiny– that is, a re-examination of the ballot papers– {{if he or she}} alleges that an unsuccessful candidate had a majority of lawful votes. When a scrutiny is conducted, the election judge may order a vote to be struck off if the voter was not on the register of electors assigned to the <b>polling</b> <b>station</b> at which the vote was recorded or was not authorized to vote at the station; if the vote was obtained by bribery, treating or undue influence; if the voter committed or induced someone to commit the offence of personation; and if the vote was for a disqualified candidate and the disqualification was either a matter that the voter was aware of or was sufficiently publicized or widely known. During a scrutiny, a tendered vote that is shown to be valid will be added to the poll if any party to the proceedings asks for the vote to be added. On the other hand, a registered elector's vote will not be struck off at a scrutiny just because he or she was not qualified to be on the electoral register, and the returning officer's decision {{as to whether or not}} a ballot paper should be rejected may not be questioned.|$|E
5|$|Polling {{stations}} {{are set up}} in public buildings throughout the country; voters may only vote at their assigned <b>polling</b> <b>station</b> (according to their permanent residence), but voters deployed abroad in the armed forces, voters on Croatian-flagged ships and imprisoned voters are allowed to vote elsewhere. Other voters residing in Croatia, but traveling abroad on election day may vote at Croatian diplomatic missions. Polling {{stations are}} open from 7:00am until 7:00pm, but all voters present at the polling stations at closing time are allowed to vote. Polling stations may be closed early if all registered voters have voted. Presidential election ballots contain a list of candidates verified by the State Electoral Commission, in alphabetical order. This entails the name and PIN of each candidate, {{and the names of}} political parties endorsing the candidate (or a note that the candidate is running as an independent. The names are preceded by ordinal numbers. Parliamentary election and European Parliament election ballots contain the name of the slate {{and the name of the}} person heading the list, in addition to candidates, who is not necessarily a candidate on the particular list, but may be included as a figurehead symbolizing specific political party or a coalition putting forward the list—usually head of the party of coalition at the national level. The lists are in alphabetical order and preceded by an ordinal number. Voting is done by circling the number associated with a particular candidate. Ballots marked otherwise (but positively indicating a candidate for which a vote is cast) are also considered valid. Blank ballots and ballots on which multiple numbers are circled (or multiple candidates are otherwise indicated) are invalid. Official results are announced and published by the State Electoral Commission.|$|E
