40|$|There is a {{requirement}} (within the food packaging industry) for a greater analytical knowledge and more scientific understanding of the ROPP capping process and of the interaction of caps (closures) with the threaded part of the glass container (finish). Threads used within the industry have largely developed empirically from metal thread profiles. An improved understanding is needed so that problems associated with that process can be better understood and solved. Such problems can be manifest in damaged closures, ‘spinners’ and closures that are just too difficult to open. The term ‘spinners’ is used for closures that do not break the <b>pilfer</b> <b>band</b> (a tamper evident safety feature) when twisted. The same term {{is also used to}} describe closures that have been turned the wrong way (i. e. clockwise) on opening, stripping the thread whilst not breaking the <b>pilfer</b> <b>band.</b> To combat this problem it is desirable to produce a closure system that has a high torque when twisted in the wrong direction (known as the over torque) whilst maintaining good seal integrity and a low torque for correct opening procedure. A successful feasibility study was carried out to investigate the appropriateness of using finite element techniques to investigate closure systems and gain the required understanding to improve these systems. The follow on project utilised these finite element techniques and experimental testing using a single-head capping machine. The Project focuses on the industry standard glass thread finish called the GF 305 that utilises an extra deep, aluminium ROPP closure. The results of this work so far are presented here...|$|E

5000|$|Other reviews {{are very}} average or mixed: Blender gave the album {{a score of}} three stars out of five and said of the band: [...] "They're after {{something}} different here--it's just {{not as good as}} what they've left behind." [...] Paste gave it a score of six out of ten and said that it was [...] "replaced by a more temperate jangle". Now gave it three stars out of five and said, [...] "It's time to move some units, so quirky's out and tunefulness is in." [...] Billboard gave it an average review and said that [...] "Much of the material... is more intimate and, at times, tentative." [...] The New York Times also gave it an average review and said it [...] "doesn't confide much, but it's a picture of a band that's not quite sure what to do next." [...] The Guardian gave it two stars out of five and said that [...] "despite finding some hooks worth <b>pilfering,</b> the <b>band</b> are still struggling to raise their game beyond White Stripes-goth-lite." [...] The Austin Chronicle also gave it two stars out of five and said, [...] "Gone is the glitzy art-punk, spastic freak-out, and unfathomable screaming. Here now instead is simple melody, nasal singing, and familiar songs, which begs the questionsic: Y Control?" ...|$|R
