25|$|The 1872 Railway Act {{gave the}} federal {{government}} broad powers in the railway sector. In 1879 {{the federal government}} established a new Department of Post and Railways its powers over the railways together with the <b>postal</b> <b>sector.</b> The bankruptcy of several railway companies during the 1870s, rail strikes and opposition to foreign ownership of the railways led to support for the nationalisation of the railways. In 1891, the nationalisation of the SCB was rejected in a referendum, but it {{was approved by the}} Federal Council in 1897. A referendum in 1898 was strongly contested, obtaining the highest level of voting participation to that date and won a two-thirds majority. Between 1900 and 1909, the Swiss Confederation acquired the five big railway companies, Jura–Simplon Railway (JS, 937km), Swiss Northeastern Railway (NOB, 771km), Swiss Central Railway (SCB, 398km), United Swiss Railways (VSB, 269km) and the Gotthard Railway (273km), forming the Swiss Federal Railways (SFR). In 1903 the SBB network took over the metre gauge Brünig Railway (German: Brünigbahn) opened in 1888 and the Swiss shipping line on Lake Constance. It acquired another four small private railways between 1913 and 1948.|$|E

40|$|The authors {{estimated}} {{components of}} variance and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) {{to aid in}} the design of complex surveys and community intervention studies by analyzing data from the Hearth Survey for England 1994. This cross-sectional survey of English adults included data on a range of lifestyle risk factors and health outcomes. For the survey, households were sampled in 720 <b>postal</b> code <b>sectors</b> nested within 177 district health authorities and 14 regional health authorities. Study subjects were adults aged 16 years or more. ICCs and components of variance were estimated from a nested random-effects analysis of variance. Results are presented at the district health authority, <b>postal</b> code <b>sector,</b> and household levels. Between-cluster variation was evident at each level of clustering. In these data, ICCs were inversely related to cluster size, but design effects could be substantial when the cluster size was large. Most ICCs were below 0. 01 at the district health authority level, and they were mostly below 0. 05 at the <b>postal</b> code <b>sector</b> level. At the household level, many ICCs were in the range of 0. 0 - 0. 3. These data may provide useful information for the design of epidemiologic studies in which the units sampled or allocated range in size from households to large administrative areas.

This paper describes the use of SAS/OR® optimization procedures to model this problem and configure optimal work areas, and the use of SAS ® Simulation Studio to simulate how the optimal configurations might satisfy the customer service requirements. The experimental results show that the proposed solution can satisfy customer demand within the desired service-time window, with significantly less travel time for the engineers, and with lower overtime and subcontractor costs...|$|R

40|$|The use of postal {{geography}} as areal units has developed significantly since its first introduction in the 1971 Census of Scotland. The 1987 Chorley report advocated {{the use of}} postal codes as the standard areal unit for publication of geographic data across the board. The change to a postal base in the census of England and Wales finally took place in 2001. Aggregation of population data is essential, both to protect the identity of individuals and make the data manageable. The question however remains, whether the independent aggregation of two similar datasets covering the same geographical area makes the data two separate information sources, or whether they can be successfully be linked together and used as one. Through the comparison of two aggregated areal datasets of British population based statistics, this paper examines the reliability of commercially produced, undocumented data, {{with the use of}} a look-up table linking <b>postal</b> <b>sectors</b> to enumeration districts of the 1991 Census of British population. The investigation finds that the ability to link the Experian dataset is to the census is questionable.
