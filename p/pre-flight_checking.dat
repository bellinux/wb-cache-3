5000|$|In {{traditional}} offset {{and digital}} printing, {{the concept of}} workflow represents the process, people and usually software technology (RIPs raster image processors or DFE digital front end) controllers that {{play a part in}} pre/post processing of print-related files. e.g. PDF <b>pre-flight</b> <b>checking</b> to make certain that fonts are embedded or that the imaging output to plate or digital press will be able to render the document intent properly for the image-output capabilities of the press that will print the final image.|$|E
50|$|In {{more recent}} years, {{prepress}} software {{has been developed}} {{which is designed to}} find as many efficiencies in prepress workflow as possible. These tools are accessed online, and allow different workers to work on one project at the same time, often from different locations. Key functionality automates common steps to reduce errors, reinforce quality standards and speed up production. Examples include automatically re-folioing pages, digital dummies for soft proofs, live linking with Adobe InDesign and <b>pre-flight</b> <b>checking.</b> These tools revolve around a Flatplan and are used in all sorts of prepress including book, magazine and catalog production.|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Hyperion {{images are}} {{currently}} processed to level 1 a (from level 0 or raw data). These level 1 a images are files of radiometrically corrected data in units of either watts/(sr × micron × m 2) × 40 for VNIR bands or watts/(sr × micron × m 2) × 80 for SWIR bands. Each distributed Hyperion level 1 a im-age tape contains a log file, called “(EO- 1 identifier). fix. log”, that reports the bad or corrupted pixels (called known bad pixels) found during the <b>pre-flight</b> <b>checking,</b> and details {{how they were}} fixed. All bad pixels should be corrected in a level 1 a image. However, bad pixels are still evident. In addition, there are dark vertical stripes in the image that are not reported in the log file. In this paper, we introduce a method to detect and correct the bad pixels and vertical stripes (we will refer to these occurrences as abnormal pixels). Images from the Greater Victoria Watershed and other EVEOSD test sites are used to determine how stationary {{the locations of the}} abnormal pixels are. After abnormal pixel correction a Hyperion image is ready for geometric correction, atmospheric correction, and further analysis...|$|E

As resupply was not guaranteed at the time, the onboard infantry were heavily laden with ample food, water, cold-weather clothing, night-vision and communications equipment in addition to weapons and ammunition.

25|$|Unlike some {{cars and}} motorcycles, a Wankel aero-engine will be {{sufficiently}} warm before full power is asked {{of it because}} of the time taken for <b>pre-flight</b> <b>checks.</b> A Wankel aero-engine spends most of its operational time at high power outputs, with little idling. This makes ideal the use of peripheral ports. An advantage is that modular engines with more than two rotors are feasible. If icing of any intake tracts is an issue, there is plenty of waste engine heat available to prevent icing.|$|R
5000|$|West Coast Airlines Flight 720 was {{operated}} on March 10, 1967 {{by one of}} the company's Fokker F-27's, registered N2712. On the morning of the flight, the aircraft was parked in West Coast's hangar at the airport for routine maintenance. [...] Due to the falling snow that morning, instead of loading at the terminal, as was standard procedure, the aircraft was loaded in the hangar with the passenger and crew members. Both pilots did a <b>pre-flight</b> <b>check</b> of the plane, and reported nothing unusual.|$|R
50|$|Whilst {{their high}} noise levels, {{increasing}} maintenance costs, high fuel consumption and unsophisticated nature (the <b>pre-flight</b> <b>checks</b> alone take between 30 and 40 minutes) make them obsolete for commercial service in Europe, {{the large number}} of aircraft available means that prices are low (from as little as US$30,000 for a serviceable example). This makes them ideal for the developing world, where their ability to carry large loads into short airstrips makes them assets to airlines on a budget. Many ex-Aeroflot An-2s work as regional airliners in Africa, Central and South America, Cuba and southeast Asia.|$|R
40|$|Tests are {{described}} which, when used {{to augment the}} existing periodic maintenance and <b>pre-flight</b> <b>checks</b> of T 700 engines, can greatly improve the chances of uncovering a problem compared to the current practice. These test signals {{can be used to}} expose and differentiate between faults in various components by comparing the responses of particular engine variables to the expected.

The combination of specific test signals and on-line processing methods provides an ad hoc approach to the isolation of faults which might not otherwise be detected during pre-flight checkout...|$|R
50|$|In {{a common}} digital {{prepress}} workflow, {{a collection of}} computer files provided by clients will be translated from an application-specific format such as Adobe InDesign or QuarkXPress to a format that the raster image processor (RIP) can interpret. But before this rasterization occurs, workers in the prepress department confirm the incoming materials {{to make sure they}} are ready to be sent to the RIP. This is an important step because it prevents production delays caused by missing materials or improperly prepared materials. Once the incoming materials have passed the <b>pre-flight</b> <b>check,</b> they are ready to be put into production and sent to the RIP.|$|R
50|$|<b>Pre-flight</b> safety <b>checks</b> of a {{fly-by-wire}} system are often performed using built-in test equipment (BITE).

25|$|The Welkin {{required}} a sophisticated electrical system. This was to minimise {{the number of}} seals and points of entry in the cockpit for the controls and instrumentation. It took an electrician experienced in {{the features of the}} Welkin four hours to undertake a <b>pre-flight</b> <b>check</b> of this system. The wings were so large that the high lift Fowler flaps of the Whirlwind were not needed, and were replaced by a simple split flap. The extra wing area also required more stability, so the tail was lengthened to provide a longer moment arm. The armament − four Hispano 20 mm cannon − was the same as the Whirlwind's, but the Welkin carried the guns in a tray in its belly, which facilitated loading. In that position, muzzle flash was also less likely to dazzle the pilot.|$|R

If all appeared satisfactory I would then put her into a dive at full power and 3,000rpm, and trim her to fly hands and feet off at [...] IAS (Indicated Air Speed).

Violating the minimum equipment list, according to which the aircraft should have been considered to be in a non-flyable condition, the pilots decided to take-off nevertheless. In flight, the aircraft proved to behave in an unpredicted way, as the leading edges of the wings could not be kept at equal temperatures because of the failing bleed air supply, causing a loss of control.|$|R

The prince, along with two companions, was returning to Stockholm from a hunting trip and visit to Princess Juliana and Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands. The delayed KLM flight from Amsterdam had landed at Copenhagen for a routine stop before continuing to Stockholm. Soon after the Douglas DC-3 aircraft took off, it climbed to an altitude of about 50 meters (150 ft), stalled, and plummeted nose-first to the ground, where it exploded on impact. All 22 people aboard the plane (16 passengers and six crew members) were killed. Also aboard the ill-fated flight was American singer and actress Grace Moore.
