40|$|The {{discovery}} of a new, safe, atypical antipsychotic remains an important challenge. To achieve this goal, a series of N-methylpiperazinopyrido[2, 3 -b] [1, 4]- and -[1, 5]- and -pyrido[4, 3 -b][1, 4]- and -[1, 5]- benzodiazepines were synthesized. The dopaminergic (D 1, D 2), serotonergic (5 -HT 2), and cholinergic (M) affinities, frequently remarked in the action mechanisms of antipsychotic drugs, were determined using their respective in vitro receptor binding assays. All affinities were reduced for each compound. Optimal substituents {{were found to be}} in the 2 - or 8 -position for the retention of affinities, while substitution at the 5 -position by acyl or alkyl groups dramatically diminished binding affinities. Pyridobenzodiazepine derivatives, such as clozapine, were found to be inactive or only weakly effective against apomorphine-mediated stereotypes in rats. In an original and complex behavioral model developed in dogs and successfully used to differentiate distinct classes of psychotropic drugs and to discriminate between typical and atypical neuroleptic drugs, 8 -chloro- 6 -(4 -methyl- 1 -piperazinyl) - 11 H-pyrido[2, 3 -b] [1, 4]benzodiazepine (9), 8 -methyl- 6 -(4 -methyl- 1 -piperazinyl) - 11 H-pyrido [2, 3 -b][1, 4]benzodiazepine (12), and 5 -(4 -methyl- 1 -piperazinyl) - 11 H-pyrido[2, 3 -b][1, 5]benzodiazepine (16) showed most of the behavioral characteristics previously described for neuroleptics. Their neurochemical profiles, particularly their 5 -HT 2 /D 2 pKi ratios, were compatible with an atypical antipsychotic effect. These compounds were selected for further investigation. The proposed modulations could lead to new possibilities for the <b>pharmacochemistry</b> of diarylazepines. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The present work {{is divided}} to two parts: 1) Applied <b>Pharmacochemistry</b> and 2) Computational <b>Pharmacochemistry</b> 1) Applied Pharmacochemistry: New heterocyclic chemotypes are {{synthesized}} that are derivatives of: i) the octahydroindolquinoline {{that may be}} useful for the pharmacotherapy of depression and ii) 2, 4 - and 2, 5 - substituted pyrroles that may be useful for the pharmacotherapy of the chronic complications of diabetes mellitus. These structures were designed based on molecular modeling methods. Their biological profile was studied based on biochemical models. For the synthesis of the compounds, known reactions, appropriately modified, were applied as well as novel synthetic procedures were developed. The aim was to find simple and efficient methodologies for the synthesis of the compounds. A total of 4 target compounds were isolated, {{one of them is}} an indole derivative and the others are pyrrole derivatives. Furthermore, 36 intermediates were synthesized, from which 25 are new compounds, 7 are pyrrole derivatives and 18 are indole derivatives. a) The synthesis of the tetracyclic compound, which is an indole derivative, involves a successful cyclization at the 4 -position of the indole ring. This is carried out using a novel Friedel-Crafts cyclization system. The new indole derivative was tested in vitro for its affinity for serotonin receptors (5 -HT 1 A, 5 -HT 2 A and 5 -HT 1 C) and dopamine receptors (D 1 and D 2). It was found that the compound acts mainly at 5 -HT 2 C receptors whereas it expresses no binding affinity at dopamine receptors. Also, it was tested in vitro for its ability to inhibit the enzyme aldose reductase and to inhibit in vitro the irreversible modification of proteins. The above three in vitro models are related to depression and the results demonstrate desirable biological properties for the pharmacotherapy of mood disorders. Finally, it was tested ex vivo for its intestinal permeability while its polar molecular surface area was calculated. These two parameters are related to passive permeability through biomembranes. Taken together, the above results indicate that the compound could be given per os and it could penetrate the blood brain barrier. b) The synthesis of the pyrrole derivatives was carried out based on Friedel- Crafts acylations. It was found that, for these reactions, the presence of nitromethane was necessary. Intramolecular aroyl migration was also observed and a possible mechanism is proposed. The new pyrrole derivatives were tested in vitro for their ability to inhibit the enzyme aldose reductase. It was found that two of them are strong inhibitors in nanomolar concentrations. The compound that was found to be the more potent aldose reductase inhibitor was studied for its ability to inhibit in vitro the irreversible modification of proteins. It was found to be as effective as trolox. 2) Computational Pharmacochemistry: A number of physicochemical properties were calculated for several molecules with different structures. For the calculation of a number of physicochemical properties, a Monte-Carlo conformational search was first performed to identify a low energy conformer. The calculated properties and the ability of the compounds to inhibit the enzyme aldose reductase were correlated using regression analyses. It was found that the inhibition is favored from rigid molecules, molecules for which the conformations have a significant difference in their energy. It was also found that the inhibition influenced positively from high values of EHOMO and maximum electrostatic potential. These results could {{contribute to the development of}} overall more active compounds. ...|$|E

LXY 6090 was designed to replace the central tetrahydrofuran moiety of MA with a cyclopentane ring and {{was identified as a}} potent HIF- 1 inhibitor with an IC 50 value of 4. 11  nM. It not only inhibited the activity of HIF- 1 in breast cancer cells but also downregulated the protein level of HIF- 1 α, which depended on von Hippel–Lindau for proteasome degradation. The related biological evaluation showed that the activity of HIF- 1 target genes, VEGF and IGF- 2, was decreased by LXY 6090 in breast cancer cell lines. LXY 6090 presented potent antitumor activity in vitro. Furthermore, LXY 6090 showed in vivo anticancer efficacy by decreasing the HIF- 1 α expression in nude mice bearing MX- 1 tumor xenografts.
