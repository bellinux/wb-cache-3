40|$|Abstract [...] The {{interaction}} between a semi- rigid {{structure and the}} surrounding fluid environment is a sober issue in the stability investigation of aircraft wings and design of turbo machinery. To Study about these types of phenomena, it requires the modelling of both fluid and structural domains. A flexible high aspect-ratio wing in flight will experience large nonlinear geometrical deformations. The nonlinear aeroelastic analysis for such kind of a wing is done by using a coupled Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) / Computational Structural Dynamics (CSD) method. The coupled approach treats the fluid and structure as two separate modules and updates the CFD and CSD variables separately by transferring the variables at the fluid–structure interface. In this article, the deformations exist in a rectangular wing model caused by the aeroelastic effects are determined using a <b>partially</b> <b>coupled</b> CFD /CSD method. The <b>partially</b> <b>coupled</b> analysis is carried out {{with the help of}} a Finite Element tool at various speeds in sub sonic Mach number range. The resulting structural deformations of the wing, induced by the moving fluid are fully studied and verified with the numerical analysis...|$|R

" New quantitative indices of resistance and resilience capacity were proposed. " We highlighted different robustness levels according to the contaminants. " There was an impact of the perturbation regime at the community level (DGGE). " Bacterial community structure <b>partially</b> <b>coupled</b> to removal efficiency robustness. a b s t r a c t Since full-scale biofilters are often operated under fluctuating conditions, {{it is critical to}} understand their response to transient states. Four pilot-scale biofilters treating a composting gas mixture and undergoing repeated substrate pulses of increasing intensity were studied. A systematic approach was proposed to quantify the resistance and resilience capacity of their removal efficiency, which enabled to distinguish between recalcitrant (ammonia, DMDS, ketones) and easily degradable (esters and aldehyde) compounds. The threshold of disturbing shock intensity and the influence of disturbance history depended on the contaminant considered. The spatial and temporal distribution of the bacterial community structure in response to the perturbation regime was analysed by Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE). Even if the substrate-pulses acted as a driving force for some community characteristics (community stratification), the structure-function relationships were trickier to evidence: the distributions of resistance and composition were only <b>partially</b> <b>coupled,</b> with contradictory results depending on the contaminant considered...|$|R

In particular, we consider programs where the objective can be expressed as a sum of functions that depend on disjoint sets of variables, which are additionally coupled by the problem constraints (e.g., [3 – 5]). The optimization of such programs is the topic addressed by decomposition methods [6] and a common strategy is to split the original problem into several smaller subproblems that are somehow coordinated until they reach the optimal solution. Additionally and as a by-product, the resulting methods can deal more naturally with decentralized implementations [7, 8].|$|R

40|$|The {{dissertation}} is a two-paper {{investigation of}} observed naturalistic marital support {{behavior in a}} sample of 30 dual-earner middle-class couples with school-aged children who were videotaped in their homes over 4 days (two weekdays, two weekend days). Couples also self-reported on marital satisfaction, job stress, and emotional distress, as well as provided salivary cortisol samples that permitted analysis of diurnal cortisol slopes. Study 1 entails the conceptualization, development, and implementation of a novel observational coding system for naturalistic marital support behavior that provides a comprehensive descriptive analysis of <b>couple</b> <b>support</b> interactions as they unfold in everyday contexts. Analyses indicate that support interactions were relatively rare, predominantly brief (< 30 seconds long), more often solicited than offered, mostly instrumental compared to emotional in content, and overwhelmingly positive versus negative in emotional quality. In addition, patterns were examined among the different support variables; in particular, findings counter the Support Gap Hypothesis and suggest that wives receive more support than husbands, due specifically to wives soliciting more support. Study 2 examines the predictors and outcomes of <b>couple</b> <b>support</b> behavior using the self-reported individual variables and diurnal cortisol slopes. Findings support the notion that emotional distress and job stress predict the support behavior of both spouses. Interesting sex differences emerged, whereby wives' depressive symptoms, wives' job stress, and husbands' neuroticism appeared to have the strongest influence on supportive behavior. However, analyses indicate little evidence for <b>couple</b> <b>support</b> behavior as a predictor of marital satisfaction and diurnal cortisol slopes. The dissertation provides first insights into <b>couple</b> <b>support</b> processes as they spontaneously unfold in naturalistic settings, highlighting the utility of naturalistic observation to shed light on real-life social behavior and its links with health and well-being...|$|R
40|$|In {{this report}} we have {{investigated}} the temperature dependence of photoluminescence (PL) from self-assembled InAs quantum dots (QDs) covered by an InAlAs/InGaAs combination layer. The ground state experiences an abnormal variation of PL linewidth from 15 K up to room temperature. Meanwhile, the PL integrated intensity ratio of the first excited state to the ground state for InAs QDs unexpectedly decreases with increasing temperature, which we attribute to the phonon bottleneck effect. We believe that these experimental results {{are closely related to}} the <b>partially</b> <b>coupled</b> quantum dots system and the large energy separation between the ground and the first excited states.
