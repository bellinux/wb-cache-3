40|$|A {{charge-coupled}} device (CCD) {{is a standard}} imager in optical region in which the image quality is limited by its pixel size. CCDs also function in X-ray region but with substantial differences in performance. An optical photon generates only one electron while an X-ray photon generates many electrons at a time. We developed a method to precisely determine the X-ray point of interaction with subpixel resolution. In particular, we found that a back-illuminated CCD efficiently functions as a fine imager. We present here the validity of our method through an actual imaging experiment. KEYWORDS: {{charge-coupled device}}, X-ray imaging, subpixel spatial resolution, mesh experimentCharge-coupled devices (CCDs) are widely used for optical and X-ray imaging. When an X-ray photon is absorbed by photoelectric interaction in the photo-sensitive region (depletion region) of the CCD, it generates a <b>primary</b> <b>charge</b> cloud consisting of many electrons whose number {{is proportional to the}} incident X-ray energy E. The size of the <b>primary</b> <b>charge</b> cloud is 73 (E/ 2. 3 keV) 1. 75 nm. 1) The <b>primary</b> <b>charge</b> cloud expands through diffusion process until they reach the potential well of the CCD pixel.

40|$|When an X-ray photon lands into a pixel (event pixel), the <b>primary</b> <b>charge</b> {{is mainly}} {{collected}} into the event pixel. If the X-ray landing position is sufficiently {{close to the}} pixel boundary, the <b>primary</b> <b>charge</b> spills over to the adjacent pixel forming split events. We can easily {{understand that there are}} three parameters coupled together; the X-ray landing position inside the pixel, the X-ray event pattern and the <b>primary</b> <b>charge</b> cloud shape. We can determine any one of them from the other two parameters. Since we know the charge cloud shape using the multi-pitch mesh experiment, we can calculate the X-ray landing position with subpixel resolution using the event pattern. We applied our method to Ti-K X-rays for the charge-coupled device with 12 μm square pixel. Once the <b>primary</b> <b>charge</b> splits into the adjacent pixel, we can determine the X-ray landing position with subpixel resolution. Using three- or four-pixel split events, we can determine the X-ray landing position with an accuracy of less than 1 μm. For a two-pixel split event, we obtained a similar position accuracy in the split direction with no improvement in the direction perpendicular to it. We will discuss the type of CCD which can achieve the subpixel resolution for the entire area of the CCD. Comment: 16 pages, 5 figures. To appear in Jpn. J. Appl. Phys. March, 200...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} focused on the {{molecular}} dynamics modeling of the <b>primary</b> <b>charge</b> separation in the photosynthetic reaction center (RC) of Rhodobacter sphaeroides. The kinetic parameters for the electron transfer along the active (L) and inactive (M) sides were obtained from a long MD trajectory, 3. 4 ns, of the RC in an amphophilic environment made of detergent and water. Both nuclear and electronic polarizations are explicitly included in our calculation. With no postprocessing parameter fit, our modeling computes, for two different charge distributions, the driving forces for the transfer of an excess electron to BL and HL from P*, in good agreement with experiments. The multiexponential kinetics of the <b>primary</b> <b>charge</b> separation is also predicted, consistent with experimentally observed kinetics. The decay of the P* state is composed of four characteristic times due to both the conformational heterogeneity of the protein and the two possible mechanisms, superexchange and sequential. At room temperature, the latter is favored over superexchange with decay rates close to experimental rates. Nevertheless, the proximity between the computed diabatic free-energy surfaces on the L side yields a superexchange electronic coupling matrix element very near its resonance point and, thus, very sensitive to changes in the driving forces. For variations of at most 1. 3 kcal mol- 1, smaller than the accuracy of our theoretical approach, superexchange might be favored over the two- step mechanism. Finally, our molecular modeling strongly indicates that the position of the diabatic free- energy surfaces for the <b>primary</b> <b>charge</b> separation cannot by itself account for the directionality of the <b>primary</b> <b>charge</b> separation. A strong electrostatic potential around the special pair that favors the polarization of the transferring electron toward regions closer to BL than to BM is found. This polarization could significantly increase the electronic coupling between P* and BL, thus accounting, at least in part, for the directionality of the electron transfer...|$|R

40|$|We {{explore the}} {{possibility}} of virtual transfer in the <b>primary</b> <b>charge</b> separation of photosynthetic bacteria {{within the context of}} several types of experimental data.

The Stark absorption kinetics data are thus consistent with virtual transfer in the <b>primary</b> <b>charge</b> separation. High-frequency coupling also makes the temperature dependence weak over a wide range of parameters. We demonstrate that Stark fluorescence anisotropy data, usually taken as evidence of virtual transfer, can in fact be consistent with two-step transfer.

40|$|We {{present a}} self-consistent model to {{describe}} X-ray and γ-ray emission from millisecond pulsars (MSPs). The X-rays of MSPs {{are produced by}} the backflow of <b>primary</b> <b>charged</b> particles from the outer gap and most likely consist of three components, two thermal components and one power law component {{if there is a}} strong multipole magnetic field on the stellar surface. The backflow of ultra-relativistic particles emits photons with energies about several tens of GeV via curvature radiation. These photons cause an electromagnetic cascade about 2 - 3 stellar radii above the polar cap. The synchrotron radiation of these cascade e± pairs produces hard X-rays with a power law index ∼ 1. 5. Near 105 cm above the stellar surface, the <b>primary</b> <b>charged</b> particles encounter the strong surface magnetic field, which alters the local radius of curvature greatly, and they quickly loose more than half of their remaining energies to curvature radiation. These curvature photons heat up the polar cap area with a radius ∼ 105 cm, which produce the softer thermal X-ray component. Finally, the <b>primary</b> <b>charged</b> particles deposit their remaining energies in a much smaller polar cap area, which corresponds to the footprints of outer gap and produce the medium hard X-ray component, γ-rays are produced in the outer gap through synchro-curvature radiation. We have applied this model to the MSPs which emit pulsed X-rays and likely γ-rays such as PSR J 0437 - 4715, PSR J 2124 - 3358, PSR J 0218 + 4232 and PSR B 1821 - 24.
