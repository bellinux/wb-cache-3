5|$|After Parise's {{penalty was}} served, it was Canada's turn {{to go on}} the <b>power</b> <b>play,</b> and Esposito scored his sixth goal of the series to tie it at 1–1. The teams {{exchanged}} power plays before Lutchenko scored a <b>power</b> <b>play</b> goal on a slap shot to put the Soviets ahead 2–1. Brad Park then scored his only goal of the series at even strength to complete some pretty passing between Dennis Hull and the Rangers' teammates of Ratelle, Gilbert and Park to tie the score. The period ended with the teams tied 2–2.|$|E
5|$|Both teams {{scored a}} goal {{each in the}} second and third periods. In the second period, an early {{tripping}} penalty against Ottawa's Mike Fisher put the Flyers on the <b>power</b> <b>play,</b> during which Kim Johnsson extended Philadelphia's lead to 4–1. Ottawa received another penalty less than a minute later, which sent Todd Simpson to the penalty box for holding. A Flyers penalty against Radovan Somik for slashing Martin Havlat resulted in a <b>power</b> <b>play</b> goal for the Senators' Zdeno Chara, closing the score to a two-goal gap once again. Fisher subsequently received his second penalty of the game, for high-sticking.|$|E

5|$|Hershey won {{the first}} game 5–2 on April 26, with Crabb opening scoring with a <b>power</b> <b>play</b> goal, and the Bears taking a 4–0 lead by the second period, {{resulting}} in Providence goaltender Niklas Svedberg being pulled from the game. The victory marked Hershey's first game one win in a playoff series since defeating Manchester in the 2009–10 Eastern Conference finals. The Bears also won their second game 5–4 on April 28, with Grubauer making 54 saves, eight short of matching the team's playoff record. The Bruins allowed 64 shots, which were six short of Hershey's highest in a playoff game. Hershey was losing 4–3 in the third, their first time trailing in the series, but Grubauer was pulled for an extra attacker and Crabb tied the game with 91 seconds in regulation, allowing DiSalvatore to score the game-winner in overtime on a <b>power</b> <b>play.</b> Hershey's 5-for-10 <b>power</b> <b>play</b> record ranked {{the highest in the}} Calder Cup playoffs at the time.|$|E
5|$|The Flames {{struggled}} on the <b>power</b> <b>play,</b> finishing 30th {{overall in}} power-play goals, with 43. They did, however, tie the Detroit Red Wings for the fewest shorthanded goals allowed, with just 1.|$|E

5|$|During the {{off-season}} Vancouver signed defenceman Jason Garrison to a six-year contract worth $27.6 million. While the Canucks brought in Garrison, they lost longtime defenceman Sami Salo. The Canucks wanted to re-sign Salo, {{though they were}} unwilling to sign him to a two-year contract and offered only a one-year deal. Salo chose to leave and signed a two-year $7.5 million contract with the Tampa Bay Lightning. It was believed that Garrison would step in {{and contribute to the}} <b>power</b> <b>play</b> and replace the departed Salo, who had performed a similar role. However, he struggled to adjust with his new team. He was taken off the <b>power</b> <b>play</b> unit and dropped to the third pairing within the first month. After the injuries to Bieksa, Garrison was moved from left defenceman to the right side pairing with Dan Hamhuis. The coaching staff came to consider this pairing to be the best and most trusted. Garrison finished the season with eight goals and eight assists, scoring three goals and three assists on the <b>power</b> <b>play,</b> and registering a +18 rating. His plus-minus was second on the team and led all defenceman.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the second}} period the Crunch got another <b>power</b> <b>play</b> {{opportunity}} when Senators' captain Drew Bannister took a hooking penalty. The man advantage did not benefit Syracuse as the Senators tied the game 1–1 when Martin St. Pierre found an open Josh Hennessy, who put the puck past Kevin Lalande for the shorthanded goal. Binghamton seemed to be gaining the advantage {{in the second}} period outshooting the Crunch 16–9. But, with just 11.7 seconds remaining in the period, Crunch defenseman David Liffiton scored the go-ahead goal from the high slot. During the third period the score remained the same, when with just 1:30 left in the game Syracuse's Kevin Harvey took an interference penalty giving the Senators a chance to tie the game on the <b>power</b> <b>play.</b> Binghamton was unable to score in the first minute of the <b>power</b> <b>play</b> and pulled Brodeur to give them the six on four advantage. Even with the two man advantage the Senators failed to post a second goal on Lalande, who stopped 36 of the 37 shots he faced during the game helping the Crunch to the 2–1 victory. His performance earned him the first Star of the Game. The game was a penalty-filled affair with 26 infractions called on the two teams and a total of 18 power plays awarded. Neither team was able to capitalize on the opportunities, with Binghamton going 0–10 and Syracuse 0–8.|$|E
5|$|Hershey next won 2–1 against St. John's on December 11, {{in which}} Holtby the eighth goaltender in Hershey history to reach 70 {{victories}}. Taffe had two assists, tying him with Aucoin for {{second in the}} league for assists, and both Hershey goals came on the <b>power</b> <b>play,</b> marking {{the first time since}} November 9 they scored more than one <b>power</b> <b>play</b> goal in a game. Holtby had three shutout victories in the next five games, starting with a 4–0 win against St. John's on December 12. The Bears scored two power plays, marking {{the first time since the}} season's three opening games that the Bears scored power plays in three consecutive matches. Paquette and Kostenko were reassigned to ECHL's Reading Royals, and rookie winger Stanislav Galiev was recalled from Reading to the Bears. Holtby's next 4–0 shutout victory against Norfolk on December 19 moved him to fifth place in career Hershey shutouts with 13, and seventh place in regular season wins with 72.|$|E

5|$|The Bears {{opened the}} month with a 5–1 loss against Norfolk on December 1, {{even though the}} Admirals allowed nine power plays. On December 4, DiSalvatore and Potulny were {{formally}} named alternate captains, ending the practice of rotating alternates throughout the season. Orlov suffered an upper body injury during Hershey's 2–1 victory against Norfolk on December 6, and {{did not return to}} Hershey until March 9. The Bears also won 5–4 against Wilkes-Barre/Scranton after Kevin Marshall, who had been a healthy scratch the day before, made his first Hershey goal in overtime for the win. The Bears lost 3–2 against the Hamilton Bulldogs, with Potulny scoring both Hershey goals, including a <b>power</b> <b>play</b> goal that ended the team's recent 0-for-19 <b>power</b> <b>play</b> record.|$|E

5|$|After {{losing a}} bitter {{series against the}} rival Rangers in the opening round of the 2008 NHL playoffs, Brodeur refused to shake Sean Avery's hand.

The day after this game the NHL announced that it had revised its unsportsmanlike conduct rule, now known as The Sean Avery Rule, effectively outlawing such antics.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 2013–14 season, the Sedins signed matching four-year, $28 million contract extensions with the Canucks. In 73 games, Daniel had 16 goals and 31 assists in 2013–14. The Canucks did not qualify for the playoffs, as Daniel had a 23-game goal-scoring drought and injured his hamstring during the Heritage Classic against the Ottawa Senators, which forced him to miss nine games. He scored multiple goals in only one game, the last of the season. During the second period of that game, a hit by the Flames' Paul Byron sent Daniel's head into the boards and ended his season. He was stretchered off the ice and briefly hospitalised. On 23 November 2014, Sedin played his 1,000th game as a Canuck, joining his brother Henrik and Trevor Linden as the only players in franchise history to reach that milestone. On 7 February 2015, Daniel scored his 115th <b>power</b> <b>play</b> goal {{as a member of the}} Canucks in the third period of a 5–0 victory over the visiting Pittsburgh Penguins, giving him the franchise record for <b>power</b> <b>play</b> tallies, surpassing his former teammate and linemate Markus Näslund, while simultaneously putting him level with Trevor Linden for second place in goals as a Canuck with 318.|$|E
5|$|Atlanta's {{first draft}} pick was Patrik Stefan, taken first overall, in the 1999 NHL Entry Draft.

He is the leader in goals, assists, points, shots on goal, overtime goals, <b>power</b> <b>play</b> goals, game-winning goals, and games played.|$|E
5|$|During the 2015–16 season, Weber {{recorded}} his first career hat trick on December 5 against the Detroit Red Wings, {{which was also}} the first ever by a Nashville Predators defenceman. Weber would continue his goal-scoring ways, tying Paul Kariya's franchise record for <b>power</b> <b>play</b> goals in a season with 14 and finishing with his third 20+ goal season. Weber was also named a finalist for the Mark Messier Leadership Award., which he would eventually win.|$|E

5|$|Ehrhoff {{is known}} as an {{offensive}} defenceman. He has strong skating ability, which allows him to quickly carry the puck up the ice, starting plays from his team's defensive zone, as well as join offensive plays deep in the opposing team's zone. He also possesses a hard shot, which earns him significant time on the <b>power</b> <b>play.</b> Upon joining the NHL with San Jose, he had to adjust his game to be more defensive. He gradually became counted upon more in defensive situations and has been used on the penalty kill, as well.|$|E

However, he injured his knee during the match and did not play another AHL game that season.|$|E
