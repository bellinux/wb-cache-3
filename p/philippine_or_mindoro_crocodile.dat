5000|$|The Philippine {{crocodile}} (Crocodylus mindorensis), {{also known}} as the <b>Mindoro</b> <b>crocodile,</b> the <b>Philippine</b> freshwater crocodile <b>or</b> locally, bukarot, is one of two species of crocodiles found in the Philippines; the other is the larger Indo-Pacific crocodile or saltwater crocodile (Crocodylus porosus). [...] The Philippine crocodile, the species endemic only to the country, became data deficient to critically endangered in 2008 from exploitation and unsustainable fishing methods, such as dynamite fishing. Conservation methods are being taken by the Dutch/Filipino Mabuwaya foundation, the Crocodile Conservation Society and the Zoological Institute of HerpaWorld in Mindoro island. It is strictly prohibited to kill a crocodile in the country, and it is punishable by law.|$|R

5000|$|Two {{species of}} {{crocodiles}} are indigenous to the Philippines: the [...] "saltwater crocodile". Crocodylus porosus, {{also known as}} the Indo-Pacific crocodile, thrives in the Indo-Pacific region, Australia, Brunei, India, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, Singapore, and Thailand. The <b>Mindoro</b> <b>crocodile</b> (Crocodylus mindorensis) is unique to the Philippines that tends to prefer a freshwater habitat. The latter [...] - [...] is considered [...] "critically endangered" [...] by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) [...] - [...] is found in Mindoro, Busuanga, Palawan, Masbate, Negros , Samar, and in the islands of Sulu. As both are threatened because of loss of their habitats to humans, conservation efforts apply to them both. Crocodile farming under CITES is geared towards the rescue and sustainable exploitation.|$|R

50|$|The {{maximum size}} of a vessel that can pass through the Strait is {{referred}} to as Malaccamax. For some of the world's largest ships (mostly oil tankers), the Strait's minimum depth (25 metres or 82 feet) is not deep enough. In addition, the next closest passageway (the Sunda Strait between Sumatra and Java) is even more shallow and narrow than Malacca. Therefore, these large ships must detour several thousand miles/kilometers and use the Lombok Strait, Makassar Strait, Sibutu Passage, <b>or</b> <b>Mindoro</b> Strait instead.|$|R

The tamaraw was originally found all over Mindoro, from sea level up to the mountains (2000 meters above sea level), but because of human habitation, hunting, and logging, it is now restricted to only a few remote grassy plains and is now an endangered species.|$|R

Also called Mount Pinagbanderahan, literally meaning [...] "where the flag was hoisted", the mountain is easily accessible via a stairway, which takes about {{an hour or so}} to climb.

However, {{it was far from}} being the only new species discovered in the Philippines. Several new rodents had already been discovered in the eighties, one of which was actually from Mindoro as well (Anonymomys mindorensis <b>or</b> <b>Mindoro</b> climbing rat). A constant supply of new species remained in the years after the description of A. gracilirostris. In ten years time, eight new mammal species were added to the list. In 2006, another new Apomys was described: Apomys camiguinensis (Camiguin forest mouse). Apomys also comprises several species which are yet undescribed, two of which are from Mindoro. Another species from Mindoro, from the predominantly Indonesian genus Maxomys, has yet to receive its scientific name.|$|R
