40|$|AbstractIn recent years, {{with the}} rapid {{development}} of the electroplating industry, electroplating sludge has reached much attention. Electroplating sludge contains heavy metals such as nickel, copper, cadmium and chromium. To avoid releasing metal into the environment, removal of heavy metals from the electroplating industry is highly desired. In this study, effects of leaching metal from electroplating sludge under phosphate participation in hydrochloric acid medium were measured. The effects {{of the amount of}} hydrochloric <b>acid,</b> <b>phosphoric</b> <b>acid</b> concentration, temperature, and liquid to solid ratio along with leaching time were investigated and measured using inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES). Using the optimized conditions of 1. 5 mol/L hydrochloric and <b>phosphoric</b> <b>acid</b> concentration, <b>liquid</b> to solid ration 10 : 1 and temperature 40 ̊C, actual electroplating sludge was treated. The leaching rate of copper was measured as high as to 80. 6 % under optimal conditions...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} six phosphoric acid-etching agents on dentin, the independent variables being two acid concentrations (10 % and 32 %- 37 %) and three thickener conditions (no thickener, silica, and polymer). The tested hypothesis was {{that the use of}} different etchants with similar concentrations of <b>phosphoric</b> <b>acid</b> would result in similar depths of dentin demineralization. METHODS: Thirty dentin disks were obtained from extracted human teeth by microtome sectioning. The dentin surfaces were etched with one of the etching agents, fixed, dehydrated and dried. The specimens were observed using a FE-SEM. The mean deepest demineralization of intertubular dentin was measured from fracture surfaces of the disks. These values were analyzed by ANOVA and Duncan's Test. The morphological appearance of the dentin surfaces was compared using the following observation criteria: 1) Presence of a cuff of peritubular dentin; 2) Relative thickness of the layer containing residual collagen or smear layer particles; and 3) Formation of a submicron hiatus {{at the bottom of the}} exposed collagen network. The pH of each of the etching agents was measured. A correlation analysis was made of the pH vs. the depth of dentin demineralization. RESULTS: Silica-thickened etchants did not demineralize dentin as deeply as did polymer-thickened etchants and unthickened etchants. High magnifications revealed three distinct zones within the demineralized dentin layer; an upper porous zone of residual smear layer or denatured collagen and residual silica particles (in groups etched with silica-thickened etchants), an intermediate area with randomly oriented collagen fibers, and a lower zone with submicron hiatus, few collagen fibers, and scattered hydroxyapatite inclusions. This hiatus was observable in all the specimens etched with the polymer-thickened etchants, in 90 % of the specimens etched with the unthickened <b>phosphoric</b> <b>acid</b> <b>liquids,</b> and in 60 % of the specimens etched with the silica-thickened gels. SIGNIFICANCE: The results obtained suggest that similar concentrations of <b>phosphoric</b> <b>acid</b> etchants containing distinct thickeners result in different demineralization depths as well as different morphology of etched dentin. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Objectives. Both {{boric acid}} (H 3 BO 3) and <b>phosphoric</b> <b>acid</b> (H 3 PO 4) are {{components}} of dental cements, commonly incorporated into glass (as {{ingredients in the}} melt) and occasionally added to the powder or liquid components. This study investigated the effect of boric acid addition to an experimental glass-ionomer powder {{and the effect of}} <b>phosphoric</b> <b>acid</b> addition to a glass-ionomer liquid on the 24 -h compressive strength. Boric acid powder was added in various concentrations to an experimental glass-ionomer powder and, separately, <b>phosphoric</b> <b>acid</b> was added to an experimental glass-ionomer liquid. Powders and liquids were dosed into capsules at various powder:liquid ratios and cements thus formed were assessed for 24 -h compressive strength. Incorporation of boric acid in glass-ionomer powder resulted in a pronounced decrease (p< 0. 05 at 1 % boric acid) in compressive strength. Addition of <b>phosphoric</b> <b>acid</b> produced initially stronger cements (up to 13 % increase at 1 % <b>phosphoric</b> <b>acid)</b> before also declining. The incorporation of less than 2 % w/w <b>phosphoric</b> <b>acid</b> in glass-ionomer <b>liquids</b> may improve cement strengths without compromising clinical usefulness.

The idea that inspired this work is {{that the possibility of}} including in such media salts currently used for technological applications should lead to a synergy between the properties of the salt and those of the medium. Therefore, the dynamic features of bis(2 -ethylhexyl) amine (BEEA) and bis(2 - ethylhexyl) <b>phosphoric</b> <b>acid</b> (HDEHP) <b>liquid</b> mixtures were investigated as a function of composition and temperature by 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and rheometry. Inclusion of litium trifluoromethanesulfonate (LiT) has been investigated by infrared spectroscopy, pulsed field gradient NMR, and conductimetry methods to highlight the solubilizing and confining properties of these mixtures as well as the lithium conductivity. It was found that BEEA/HDEHP binary liquid mixtures show zero-threshold percolating self-assembly with a maximum in viscosity and a minimum in molecular diffusion at a 1 : 1 composition. Dissolution of LiT in such system can occur via confinement in the locally self-assembled polar domains. Despite this confinement, Li+ conduction is scarcely dependent on the medium composition because of the possibility of a field-induced hopping decoupled by the structural and dynamical features of the medium...|$|R

40|$|The {{last step}} in the {{production}} of milk powder is drying, an energy intensive process that demands 30 % to 40 % of the total energy input of a typical plant. It takes place in Spray Dryers (SD), where concentrated milk is sprayed and placed in direct contact with hot and dry air that cools down and gains humidity as water is evaporated from milk. The warm and humid air leaving the SD contains a small portion of potentially recoverable sensible heat and a large portion of latent heat that is impractical to recover by direct condensation due to the low dew point of this stream and due to the presence of milk powder particles that become sticky at high relative humidity values. In this research, the thermodynamic feasibility of a liquid sorption system for the recovery of heat from the exhaust of SD’s was investigated. The system proposed has two main advantages: the dehumidification of air in the absorber for reuse in the SD, and the production of medium pressure steam in the regenerator for integration to the steam network of the plant.

Although polybenzimidazole membranes are routinely doped with <b>phosphoric</b> <b>acid,</b> few studies on {{the exact nature of}} the acid inside the membrane have been published. It is not known whether the <b>phosphoric</b> <b>acid</b> is present as ortho- or pyrophosphoric acid at all operating conditions and how it interacts with the membrane at a high operating temperature of 160  °C. In this study, we investigated cross-linked poly(2, 5 -benzimidazole) (ABPBI) membranes obtained from FuMA-Tech GmbH which were doped in 85  % <b>phosphoric</b> <b>acid.</b> Conductivity measurements of the doped membrane under dry conditions show a maximum conductivity at 160 [*]°C. At higher temperatures, the conductivity decreases as the dehydration of the orthophosphoric acid to the less conductive pyrophosphoric acid becomes relevant. Thermogravimetric analyses of pure <b>phosphoric</b> <b>acid</b> and doped membranes help to assess the amount of dehydrated <b>phosphoric</b> <b>acid</b> as well as the content of water and <b>phosphoric</b> <b>acid</b> inside the doped membrane. The thermal signals show two distinct weight losses between 30 [*]°C and 200 [*]°C, whose onset varies with the doping level of the membrane. An explanation for this effect, besides limited heat transfer, could be the bonds formed between the <b>phosphoric</b> <b>acid</b> molecules and the imidazole rings of the polymer. While free <b>phosphoric</b> <b>acid</b> molecules, found in pure <b>phosphoric</b> <b>acid</b> or in highly doped membranes, are free to condensate to pyrophosphoric acid molecules as soon as the activation energy is reached, bonded molecules need more energy to first break the bond and then dehydrate.
