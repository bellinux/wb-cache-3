5000|$|This {{irrigation}} project eventually proved successful, making possible large surpluses {{of cotton}} and sorghum and encouraging private entrepreneurs to undertake new projects. High cotton profits during the Korean War (1950-53) increased private interest along the Blue Nile as well, and by 1958 {{almost half the}} country's irrigated cotton was grown under <b>pump</b> <b>irrigation.</b> During the 1960s, however, downward fluctuations in world cotton prices and disputes between entrepreneurs and tenants led to numerous failures of <b>pump</b> <b>irrigation</b> projects. In 1968 the government assumed ownership and operation of the projects, establishing the Agricultural Reform Corporation for this purpose, and the takeover began that year with the larger estates. [...] Subsequently, as leases expired, the corporation acquired smaller projects, until May 1970 when all outstanding leases were revoked. A considerable number of small pump operations that developed on privately owned land, chiefly along the main Nile {{but also on the}} Blue Nile, continued to operate.Since the 1950s, the government has constructed a number of large pump projects, mostly on the Blue Nile. These have included the Junayd project on the right bank of the Blue Nile east of the Gezira Scheme. This project, with an irrigated area of about 36000 ha, went into operation in 1955 to provide an alternative livelihood for nomadic pastoralists in the area. It produced cotton until 1960, when about 8400 ha were converted to sugarcane. A sugar factory built to process the crop (with a potential capacity of 60,000 tons of sugar a year) opened in 1962. In the early 1970s, the Japanese-assisted As Suki project, also of 36000 ha, was established upstream from Sannar to grow cotton, sorghum, and oilseeds. In the mid-1970s, the government constructed a second project near Sannar of about 20000 ha hectares. In addition to cotton and other crops such as peanuts, about 8400 ha of the area were devoted to raising sugarcane. The cane-processing factory, with a design capacity of 110,000 tons of sugar a year, opened in 1976. Several smaller Blue Nile projects added more than an additional 80000 ha to Sudan's overall irrigated area during this time.|$|E

5000|$|Since the {{sustainability}} of the <b>pump</b> <b>irrigation</b> project was a problem due to high operational costs, Bina Swadaya changed its approach in 1994. Its new objectives were to strengthen the existing SHGs and to increase {{the availability of the}} micro finance scheme to the villagers. [...] And a rural bank, BPR Abdiarta Swadaya was established by Bina Swadaya as a course of action to achieve its new objectives. The majority members of Arta Mekar Mulya Group who were micro entrepreneurs and peasants now could borrow up to Rp. 400.000 without any form of physical collateral allowing them to expand their micro businesses or further improving their rice farming which will aid in increasing the productivity as well. [...] The success of the SHG attracted villagers from other villages to become members of Arta Mekar Mulya Group and this greatly freed many villagers from heavy debts as now instead of borrowing from money lenders who charged exorbitant rates of interest, they can seek financial help from Arta Mekar Mulya Group. Another attribute of this SHG is that instead of only focusing on the well-being of its group members, the profits which were the fruits of their success were channeled to address other social needs of the village as well which resulted in shops, bridges and the establishment of other community infrastructures.|$|E
50|$|The {{waters of}} the Nile in Sudan {{have been used for}} centuries for {{traditional}} irrigation, taking advantage of the annual Nile flood. Some use of this method still continued in the early 1990s, and the traditional shaduf (a device to raise water) and waterwheel were also used to lift water to fields in local irrigation projects but were rapidly being replaced by more efficient mechanized pump systems. Among the first efforts to employ irrigation for modern commercial cropping was the use of the flood{{waters of the}} Qash River and the Baraka River (both of which originate in Ethiopia) in eastern Sudan to grow cotton on their deltas. This project was started in the late 1860s by the Egyptian governor and continued until interrupted by the turbulent period of the 1880s, leading to the reconquest of the country by the British in 1899. Cultivation was resumed in 1896 in the Baraka Delta in the Tawkar area, but in the Qash Delta it only resumed after World War I. Between 1924 and 1926, canals were built in the latter delta to control the flood; sandstorms made canals unfeasible in the Baraka. Between the 1940s and the 1970s, various projects were developed to irrigate land. In 1982 both deltas yielded only one crop a year, watered by the flood. Adequate groundwater, however, offered the eventual possibility of using <b>pump</b> <b>irrigation</b> from local wells for additional cropping or for supplementing any flood shortages.The drought that affected Sudan in the 1980s was a natural disaster that had a crushing effect on the country's irrigation systems. In 1990-91, for instance, water was so scarce in the Tawkar area {{that for the first time}} in 100 years the crops failed.|$|E

40|$|This paper calls {{attention}} {{to the importance of}} social cooperation in irrigation farming. It argues that a mere focus on the technical aspect of irrigation, disregarding its social aspects undermines the long-term benefits of irrigation to rural livelihoods. This assertion draws on lessons from small-irrigation practices in Fogera, in the Blue Nile Basin of Ethiopia, where I conducted fieldwork-based qualitative research. In recent years irrigation farming has drawn a growing interest among farmers in rural Fogera. Farmers practise small-scale irrigation that includes traditional irrigation and motor <b>pump</b> <b>irrigation.</b> Farmers assert that irrigation has brought farming benefits through cultivation of more crops as well as new crops that serve food and cash purposes. Such benefits have particularly spurred the enthusiasm for motor <b>pump</b> <b>irrigation.</b> However, the practice of motor <b>pump</b> <b>irrigation</b> largely relies on the motor-pump technology, overlooking the social scheme of irrigation. While traditional irrigation involves more social cooperation involving joint activities, water allocations and irrigation schedules, lack of social cooperation and such institutional conditions is widespread in motor <b>pump</b> <b>irrigation.</b> Local classification of irrigation practices also associate the mechanism of irrigation use and management including water use regulations and water use turns with traditional irrigation in contrast to motor <b>pump</b> <b>irrigation.</b> The neglect of social cooperation within current practices of motor <b>pump</b> <b>irrigation</b> will have significant adverse implications on long-term practices. Farmers have been already concerned about how competitions for water are growing, limiting the duration of water availability and creating water shortage. The study suggests that while farmers’ willingness to practise motor <b>pump</b> <b>irrigation</b> in Fogera has been stimulated by its livelihood benefits, sustained benefits of this irrigation scheme require social cooperation and feasible institutional conditions that can mediate water usage across user villages...|$|E
