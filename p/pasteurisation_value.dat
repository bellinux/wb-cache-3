40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} use of Time Temperature Integrators (TTIs) to {{validate}} industrial cooking processes aimed to achieve a 6 logarithmic inactivation of Listeria monocytogenes, equal to a heat load of 2 min at 70 °C (P 707. 5 = 2). To produce microbiological TTIs, live cells of L. monocytogenes were crossbound in alginate beads. Decimal reduction (D) values were measured in two food matrixes, meat extract and milk. D-values were compared in capillary tubes and in alginate beads. The {{results showed that the}} immobilised cells had slightly higher D-values compared with free cells in capillary tubes. Measurements in milk revealed higher D-values compared to measurements in meat extract. Alginate beads in milk showed a D 58 of 4. 5 min, compared to capillary tubes with a D 58 of 3. 7 min and alginate beads in meat extract a D 58 of 1. 5 min and capillary tubes a D 58 of 1. 0 min. Enzymatic TTIs based on inactivation of α-amylase (BAA 70) were used for validation of a commercial fried fish burger production. The TTI was calibrated and had a D 70 of 28. 3 min and z of 6. 5 °C ± 0. 30 °C. The burgers were fried on both sides on a Teflon frying belt, before the burgers subsequently were heated in a continuous oven. The temperature profile calculated from a numeric model was combined with known inactivation kinetics and the residual α-amylase activity was calculated and compared to actual values of the TTIs placed in the core of the fish burgers. The results showed that α-amylase BAA 70 TTIs can be used as to validate a specific minimum <b>pasteurisation</b> <b>value</b> for fried fish burgers...|$|E
40|$|Traditional and novel {{approaches}} for {{the calculation of}} the heat treatment efficiency are compared in this work. The Mild Heat value (MH-value), an alternative approach to the commonly used sterilisation, <b>pasteurisation</b> and cook <b>value</b> (F, P, C–value), is calculated to estimate the efficiency of a mild heat process. MH-value is {{the time needed to}} achieve a predefined microbial reduction at a reference temperature and a known thermal resistant constant, z, for log-linear or specific types of non log-linear microbial inactivation kinetics. An illustrative example is given in which microbial inactivation data of Listeria innocua CLIP 20 - 595 are used for estimating the inactivation parameters under isothermal conditions of 58, 60, 63 and 66 oC by the use of the log-linear and the Geeraerd et al., (2000) model. Thereafter, dynamic temperature profiles (targeting at 54 and 57 C) representing milk thermisation are exploited for illustrating the application of MH-value. Finally, the equivalent holding times of different temperatures are calculated taking into account the observed non-linearity...|$|R
