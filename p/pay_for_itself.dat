After April 1796, the military was paid in metallic value, not the worthless paper, but pay was still well in arrears. The French Directory believed that war should <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>itself</b> and did not budget to pay, feed, and equip its troops.

25|$|ESC {{is built}} {{on top of an}} {{anti-lock}} brake system, and all ESC-equipped vehicles are fitted with traction control. The ESC components include a yaw rate sensor, a lateral acceleration sensor, a steering wheel sensor, and an upgraded integrated control unit. In the US, Federal regulations require that ESC be installed as a standard feature on all passenger cars and light trucks as of the 2012 model year. According to National Highway Traffic Safety Administration research, ABS in 2005 cost an estimated US$368; ESC cost a further US$111. The retail price of ESC varies; as a stand-alone option it retails for as little as $250 USD. ESC was once rarely offered as a sole option, and was generally not available for aftermarket installation. Instead, it was frequently bundled with other features or more expensive trims, so the cost of a package that included ESC was several thousand dollars. Nonetheless, ESC is considered highly cost-effective and it might <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>itself</b> in reduced insurance premiums.|$|E

25|$|Thompson left Munich in 1798. His successor, Baron von Werneck, {{attempted}} to make the garden <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>itself</b> through its agricultural use. To that end he expanded the park in December 1799 to encompass the Hirschau, which was improved to provide pasture. The fields of the military gardens {{were added to the}} Englischer Garten in January 1800. Werneck's improvements had been costly, and in 1804 he was replaced by Sckell, who was given the post of Bayerischer Hofgärtenintendant ("Bavarian Court Garden Supervisor"). Although Sckell had had a guiding role from the beginning, many aspects of the execution differed from his ideas, which he set out in a memorandum of 1807. His long supervision of the garden (1804–1823) was marked by a movement away from agricultural uses and by concentration on the landscape garden. For instance, two mills {{at the point where the}} Schwabingerbach (Schwabing stream) leaves the Eisbach (Ice stream) were removed and an artificial waterfall was created in 1814-1815.|$|E
25|$|In 1920, Colter began a long {{effort to}} control {{the waters of the}} Colorado River. He began an effort to put {{construct}} a series of dams from southern Utah {{all the way down to}} Yuma, Arizona. The dams would store water, which would be used to reclaim over 6,000,000 acres of arid land through irrigation. The proposal was supposed to <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>itself</b> through the sale of the power generated by the dams. In December 1921, the Arizona Fish and Game was formed, with Colter serving on its executive committee. In 1922, under doctor's orders, Colter booked an around-the-world cruise to recover his health. The itinerary of the trip included Hawaii, the Philippines, China, Japan, India and the mid-East. The trip was postponed when Colter learned of the Sante Fe Compact. He returned to Arizona and began a decades long fight to keep the lion's share of the water from the Colorado River for use in Arizona.|$|E
25|$|During {{the public}} discussions in 2007, an {{interest}} group {{put forward a}} proposal to build a new, much larger bridge {{to the east of}} the existing harbour bridge, and demolish the latter. They argued that the new bridge, which would be about 50% longer than the existing one, could be constructed to provide for dedicated public transport (including light rail, which they claimed would allow a tripling of the total capacity in people then being moved over the existing bridge), as well as for cyclists and pedestrians. Significantly, they argued that the new bridge would more or less <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>itself,</b> by freeing up new residential land occupied by several kilometres of motorway approaches {{in some of the most}} sought-after Auckland locations like Saint Marys Bay. The proponents claimed that the bridge would free up more than 35 hectares and open up 3.3km of shoreline, a prize which would more than make up for the fact that the plans for the Western Reclamation redevelopment would in this case find themselves partly compromised by a major motorway in its area. The proposed bridge would also be cheaper to operate, and unlike a tunnel, would not need emission vents.|$|E

The model yields simple expressions for the steady-state feedback effect of a tax cut. The feedback is surprisingly large: for standard parameter values, half of a capital tax cut is self-financing. The paper considers various generalizations of the basic model, including elastic labor supply departures from infinite horizons, and non-neoclassical production settings. It also examines how the steady-state results are modified when one considers the transition path to the steady state. ...|$|R

50|$|Commercial {{production}} machining {{now makes}} use of increasingly advanced chucks which have not only indexable positioning but also indexable clamping. Both functions are typically hydraulically controlled. The clamping is often done with each pair of jaws consisting of one fixed jaw and one movable jaw (hydraulically actuated), thematically similar to advanced milling vises. This method of clamping brings the high precision and repeatability of such vises to a chucking application. Such chucks offer the centering precision of traditional independent-jaw chucks with the chucking speed and ease of traditional three-jaw self-centering scroll chucks. They have expensive initial cost (compared with traditional chucks), but such initial cost <b>pays</b> <b>for</b> <b>itself</b> and then lowers ongoing marginal costs in commercial production-run environments.|$|R
