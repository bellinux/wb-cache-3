25|$|Publishers often funded {{trade-in}} {{deals to}} encourage consumers to purchase new games. Trade-in customers at the Australia retailer Game would purchase twice the games per year as non-trade-in customers. The sale of pre-owned games kept retailers in business, and composed {{about a third}} of Game's revenue. Retailers also saved on the UK's value-added tax, which only taxed the retailer's profit on pre-owned games, rather than the full sale on regular games. The former trade-in retail executives behind the trade-in <b>price</b> <b>comparison</b> site Trade In Detectives estimated that the United Kingdom's trade-in industry was {{about a third of}} the size of its new games business. They figured that sites such as eBay, which convert used games into cash, compose about a quarter of the UK's trade-in market, but do not keep the credit within the industry. While consumers might appear to receive better offers on these sites, they also take about 15 percent of the selling price in fees. Alternatively, some retailers will match the trade-in values offered by their competitors. Microsoft's original plan for the Xbox One attempted to translate trade-in deals for the digital marketplace, with a database of product licenses that shops would be able to resell with publisher permission, though the plan was poorly received or poorly sold.|$|E

2500|$|In October 2014, the UK’s Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) banned Wonga {{from using}} a TV advert that it said {{breached}} its code {{because of a}} claim that customers would save money. The authority said this {{was likely to be}} interpreted as a statement that Wonga’s loans were cheaper than those of other lenders and was therefore a <b>price</b> <b>comparison.</b> It ruled that Wonga should consequently have informed consumers of its 5,853% annual interest rate. The ruling was in response to a complaint from the charity Citizens Advice, whose chief executive Gillian Guy, said: [...] "Adverts must be clear about what taking out a loan means and how much it will cost. The consequences are really serious when payday lending goes wrong. High interest rates and fees can mean that a small loan balloons into a huge debt… both the advertising and payday loan industries need to look at why so many adverts are not meeting the grade and change their ways". It was the third Wonga advert to be banned by the ASA in 2014.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{a number}} of {{commentators}} have expressed enthusiasm over the increasing [...] "propertization" [...] of intellectual property (that is to say, the increased application of real property doctrines to intangible property) and {{the extension of the}} trespass to chattels doctrine to computer networks, {{a number of}} detractors have expressed concern over the ramifications of extending the theory to protect electronic communications that do not actually damage the computer systems in question but only cause nominal damage due to their content. [...] Primarily, these critics worry that extending trespass to chattels in this fashion would stifle free speech on the internet because any unwelcome email might constitute a trespass and may subject the sender not only to civil liability under the trespass theory but to criminal liability as well. [...] This would presumably reduce people's willingness to communicate freely on the Internet and curtail the Internet's ability to function as an open, democratic forum. Particularly in situations where the electronic communication is an email that contains speech that is of importance to the public and the communications do not hamper the functionality of the recipient's computer system, First Amendment free speech protections ought to outweigh the property right in the unharmed computer system. Similarly, critics have also expressed concerns that plaintiffs have employed the doctrine to stifle legitimate competition. For example, the screen-scraping cases indicate that courts might interpret trespass to chattels {{in such a way that}} allows major corporations to prevent <b>price</b> <b>comparison</b> sites from employing harmless bots to aggregate information that users want in a readily accessible format since it might encourage consumers to look elsewhere.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{proposes to}} fix online {{shopping}} by guiding {{it away from}} <b>price</b> <b>comparisons</b> and toward value <b>comparisons.</b> Though <b>price</b> <b>comparisons</b> may be adequate for simple products (e. g., books and music), they are inadequate for facilitating transactions of complex products (e. g., computers and automobiles).

Tête-à-Tête is an agent-mediated comparison shopping system that allows consumers to consider dimensions other than price in their buying decisions for complex products.
