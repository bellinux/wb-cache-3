2500|$|A {{zero-coupon bond}} (also {{discount}} bond or deep discount bond) is a bond {{bought at a}} price lower than its face value, with the face value repaid {{at the time of}} maturity.

When the bond reaches maturity, its investor receives its par (or face) value. Examples of zero-coupon bonds include U.S. Treasury bills, U.S. savings bonds, long-term zero-coupon bonds, and any type of coupon bond that has been stripped of its coupons.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} {{proof of the}} Sturm-Hurwitz theorem, using basic calculus. Let f: R → R be a {{continuous}} 2 π-periodic function, and let us assume that its Fourier series is given by (1) f(x) ∼ [ak cos(kx) + bk sin(kx) ], k=n with a 2 n +b 2 n ̸ = 0. In other words we assume that all the harmonic components of order less than n vanish. The Sturm-Hurwitz theorem states that Theorem 1. Assuming (1), the function f has at least 2 n distinct zeroes in the interval [0, 2 π). Sturm stated this result for the case of trigonometric polynomials, while Hurwitz generalized it to <b>periodic</b> functions.

Ordinary Least Square (OLS) was used for short run estimate, while a combination of Johansen Co-Integration, Granger Causality Tests and impulse response analysis were used for long run estimation. Our model shows that the four monetary policy variables have 88 % joint probability of affecting level economic growth as well as explained 84 % of economic growth Nigeria experience for the period 1980 - 2012.

40|$|Disorder in {{periodic}} structures {{is known}} to cause spatial localization of normal modes and attenuation of waves in all frequency bands. This thesis uses a traveling wave perspective to investigate these effects on one-dimensional <b>periodic</b> structures of <b>interest</b> to the engineer. Relevant {{work in the fields}} of solid state physics, mathemat-ics and engineering is reviewed. A transfer matrix formalism including wave transfer matrices is used to model disordered periodic structures. A limit theorem of Fursten-berg for products of random matrices is exploited to calculate localization effects as a function of frequency. The approach presented is applicable to virtually any disor-dered periodic system carrying a single pair of waves. Localization is studied on three disordered periodic systems using both theoretical calculations and Monte Carlo simu-lations. Localization is found to be quite pronounced at frequencies near the stopbands of the perfectly periodic counterparts. The problem of localization in one-dimensional systems carrying a multiplicity of wave types is examined using the theorem of Os-eledets on products of random matrices.

40|$|Repetitive control (RC) with linear {{phase lead}} {{compensation}} provides {{a simple but}} very effective control solution for any periodic signal with a known period. Multirate repetitive control (MRC) with a downsampling rate can reduce the need of memory size and computational cost, and then leads to a more feasible design of the plug-in repetitive control systems in practical applications. However, with fixed sampling rate, both MRC and its linear phase lead compensator {{are sensitive to the}} ratio of the sampling frequency to the frequency of <b>interested</b> <b>periodic</b> signals: (1) MRC might fails to exactly compensate the periodic signal {{in the case of a}} fractional ratio; (2) linear phase lead compensation might fail to enable MRC to achieve satisfactory performance in the case of a low ratio. In this paper, a universal fractional-order design of linear phase lead compensation MRC is proposed to tackle periodic signals with high accuracy, fast dynamic response, good robustness, and cost-effective implementation regardless of the frequency ratio, which offers a unified framework for housing various RC schemes in extensive engineering application.
