40|$|ObjectiveType II endoleak (T 2 EL) with {{aneurysm}} {{expansion is}} believed to place patients at risk for aneurysm-related mortality (ARM). Treatment with glue and/or coil embolization of the aneurysm sac, inferior mesenteric artery (IMA), and lumbar branches via translumbar or transarterial approaches has been utilized to ablate such endoleaks, and thus decrease ARM. We evaluated the midterm results of percutaneous endovascular treatment of T 2 EL with aneurysm expansion. MethodsSingle-institution, 5 -year (January 2003 to August 2008) retrospective study of all endovascular interventions for T 2 EL with sac expansion. Blinded, independent review of all available <b>pre-</b> <b>and</b> <b>post-T</b> 2 EL intervention computed tomography (CT) scans was performed. Aneurysm sac maximal transverse diameters and aneurysm sac growth rates prior to and following T 2 EL intervention were analyzed. ResultsForty-two patients (34 male, eight female; mean age, 75) underwent T 2 EL intervention at 26 ± 20 months after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) and were subsequently followed for 23 ± 20 months. Seven out of 42 patients (17 %) underwent repeat T 2 EL intervention. Interventions included 44 translumbar sac embolizations, and transcatheter embolizations of nine IMAs and seven lumbar/hypogastric arteries. Aneurysm diameter was 6. 1 ± 1. 6 cm at EVAR, 6. 6 ± 1. 5 cm at initial T 2 EL treatment, and 6. 9 ± 1. 7 cm at last follow-up. There {{were no significant differences}} in the rates of aneurysm sac growth <b>pre-</b> <b>and</b> <b>post-T</b> 2 EL treatment. At last follow-up imaging, recurrent or persistent T 2 EL was noted in 72 % of patients. Of 42 patients, nine (21 %) received operative endoluminal correction of occult type I or type III endoleaks that were diagnosed during the T 2 EL angiographic intervention. There were no aneurysm ruptures or ARMs during follow-up; overall mortality for the 5 -year study period was 24 %. ConclusionsIn this series, percutaneous endovascular intervention for type II endoleak with aneurysm sac growth does not appear to alter the rate of aneurysm sac growth, and the majority of patients display persistent/recurrent endoleak. However, diagnostic angiographic evaluation may reveal unexpected type I and III endoleaks and is therefore recommended for all patients with T 2 EL and sac growth. While coil and glue embolization of aneurysm sac and selected branch vessels does not appear to yield benefit in our series, the diagnosis and subsequent definitive treatment of previously occult type I and III endoleaks may explain the absence of delayed rupture and ARM in our series...|$|R

The immunogenicity of the P 2, P 30, and P 2 P 30 T-cell epitopes of tetanus toxin and whole tetanus toxoid (TT) was evaluated by in vitro proliferation assay of lymphocytes from men with no history of tetanus vaccination who were enrolled in a malaria prophylaxis trial. The enhancement of immune response by tetanus vaccination (Td) and possible antagonism by the antimalarial drugs, was measured by <b>pre-</b> <b>and</b> <b>post-Td</b> comparisons within <b>and</b> between immunized prophylaxis groups (primaquine, chloroquine, placebo) and a nonimmunized control group. Constructs demonstrated low immunogenicity relative to TT in all groups. Relative to both control and its own baseline, the immunized primaquine prophylaxis group was distinct in demonstrating significantly increased proliferation against all three subunits and at both high (30 microg ml(- 1)) and low (3 microg ml(- 1)) concentrations. Immunization elicited significantly increased proliferation responses by placebo and chloroquine prophylaxis groups against only the P 2 P 30 construct. Despite these significant post-Td changes, a low concentration of TT 0. 1 microg ml(- 1)) stimulated proliferation 7 - 10 times over that induced by the greatest concentration of the constructs...|$|R

Method: The original game cards were altered by the authors and submitted to content validation by six experts in the field. After redesigns, the game was applied to 30 subjects, who answered a questionnaire (pre-test <b>and</b> <b>post-test)</b> on auscultatory measurement. Data were analyzed descriptively and by the paired Student's t-test and paired Wilcoxon test. Results: Throughout the content validation process, 17 of the 28 original cards were modified. Of these 17 cards, 13 obtained 80 % agreement, and the rest were modified according to the judges' suggestions. The obtained grades significantly increased between <b>pre-</b> <b>and</b> the <b>post-test.</b> Conclusion: It was concluded that the reformulated game presented satisfactory evidence of content validity.

Methods: The research was based on the method of questionnaires. For gathering the data sociometric test was used, which was later evaluated.

40|$|Background This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of mindfulness-based cognitive group therapy (MBCT) in reducing negative automatic thoughts and dysfunctional attitudes in cancer patients. Methods The study was an applied and quasi-experimental research conducted by <b>pre-</b> <b>and</b> post-testing. The sample consisted of 30 cancer patients selected by purposive sampling and randomly placed in the control and the experimental group (15 individuals per group). The members of both groups filled out the automatic thoughts questionnaire (ATQ) and the dysfunctional attitudes scale (DAS- 26) at the <b>pre-</b> <b>and</b> the <b>post-test</b> stage. The collected data were analyzed by the SPSS software and multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) tests. Results The results indicated that MBCT significantly reduced negative automatic thoughts (F = 126. 15, P < 0. 01) and dysfunctional attitudes (F = 179. 53, P < 0. 01) in the experimental group at the post-test stage in comparison to the control group.

The BSM, which {{is an integral part}} of the degree programme, involved teams of four or five individuals, under the direction of a leader, working on a (simulated) car manufacturing task over a period of 24. weeks. Various aspects of team performance contributed towards module assessment.

Leaders were randomly allocated into a self-regulation intervention (15 leaders, 46 followers) or control (25 leaders, 109 followers) conditions. The intervention, which was run by an independent coach, was designed to improve leaders' use of self-regulatory processes to aid the development of task-relevant leadership competencies. Survey data was collected from the leaders and followers (on three occasions: <b>pre-</b> <b>and</b> two <b>post-test</b> intervention), team financial performance (three occasions: <b>post-test)</b> <b>and</b> a final team report (post-test).

30|$|In {{the present}} study, {{clinical}} success was achieved {{in five of}} the seven patients. In one of the two patients experiencing clinical failure, the T 2 EL disappeared after the third intervention; however, we could not stop enlargement of the aneurysm. In both of these patients with sac expansion even after the final treatment for T 2 EL, the T 2 EL was no longer evident on CT angiography, and in one disappearance of the T 2 EL was also confirmed by angiography. There are two possible reasons for continuous enlargement of the aneurysm. First, T 2 ELs that are invisible by both angiography and CT angiography exist. Second, there are causes of enlargement of aneurysms other than T 2 EL. Aziz et al. (2012) reported that percutaneous endovascular intervention for a T 2 EL with aneurysm sac growth does not alter the rate of aneurysm sac growth. They reported that in 42 patients who underwent a T 2 EL intervention the mean diameters of the aneurysm were 6.1  ±  1.6  cm at EVAR, 6.6  ±  1.5  cm at the initial T 2 EL treatment, and 6.9  cm ±  1.7  cm at the last follow-up. There {{were no significant differences in}} sac growth <b>pre-</b> <b>and</b> <b>post-T</b> 2 EL treatment (Aziz et al. 2012). Indeed, there were cases in which the increase in the aneurysm was not arrested after T 2 EL treatment. On the other hand, in many cases the enlargement was arrested by percutaneous endovascular intervention. Funaki et al. (2012) reported treatment of a T 2 EL in 16 patients with growing aneurysms, with technical success observed in 88  % (14 of 16 patients) and clinical success achieved in 100  % (16 or 16 patients). Furthermore, with regard to the clinical success rate of treatment of a T 2 EL with an enlarging aneurysm, Gallagher et al. (2012) reported a rate of 75.9  % (22 of 29 patients) and Steinmentz et al. (2004) reported a rate of 100  % (five of five patients). Hence, we believe that it is worth trying embolization initially and surgical therapy is necessary if embolization fails and the increase of aneurysms continues.|$|R
