The frequent vardenafil-specific side-effect is nausea; the infrequent side effects are abdominal pain, back pain, photosensitivity, abnormal vision, eye pain, facial edema, hypotension, <b>palpitation,</b> tachycardia, arthralgia, myalgia, rash, itch, and priapism.|$|E
25|$|Less {{common side}} effects may include: Hypotension, faintness, <b>palpitation,</b> rash or pruritus, {{gastrointestinal}} disturbances, {{and changes in}} libido are less common. Very infrequently, paradoxical reactions may occur, for example, excitement, stimulation, hallucinations, hyperactivity, and insomnia. Also, depressed or increased dreaming, disorientation, severe sedation, retrograde amnesia, headache, hypothermia, and delirium tremens are reported. Severe liver toxicity has also been reported.|$|E
40|$|<b>Palpitations</b> are {{a common}} symptom of {{presentation}} in medical practice. They are usually caused by cardiac arrhythmias, psychiatric problems or other miscellaneous causes, such as anaemia or endocrine causes. They are rarely due to autonomic seizures. We report a 55 -year-old woman who presented at Sultan Qaboos University Hospital, Oman, with recurrent episodes of <b>palpitations.</b> Her associated symptoms included breathlessness and excessive sweating, followed by a sensation of dizziness. During subsequent episodes, she experienced symptoms of rising abdominal pain followed by a loss of consciousness. Positive electroencephalogram findings, {{as well as the}} response of the symptoms to antiepileptic drugs, were strongly suggestive of temporal lobe epilepsy as the possible diagnosis. The fact that the cardiac investigations, performed during an interictal period, were unremarkable also supports the hypothesis that the <b>palpitations</b> were linked to seizures. Epilepsy should be considered as a differentialdiagnosis of <b>palpitations,</b> especially if the <b>palpitations</b> are episodic...|$|R
40|$|Panic {{disorder}} (PD) is characterised by sudden {{attacks of}} intense fear with somatic symptoms including <b>palpitations</b> and tachycardia. Reciprocally, <b>palpitations</b> caused by paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) are {{commonly associated with}} anxiety and may therefore be misdiagnosed as PD. As demonstrated by two case reports, PSVT and PD can occur comorbidly in a chronological sequence, with PSVT possibly precipitating and maintaining PD via interoceptive processes or, alternatively, with PD increasing the risk for PSVT by elevating stress levels. As both PSVT and PD require different treatments, potentially helpful differential clinical diagnostic criteria are proposed. Background Panic disorder (PD) is characterised by a lifetime prevalence of 1 % to 3 % and sudden attacks of intense fear accompanied by somatic, particularly cardiac symptoms such as <b>palpitations,</b> chest pain, and tachycardia: 89 % of patients with PD complain of <b>palpitations,</b> with up to 25 % of patients initially referred to cardiac clinics with atypical chest pain or <b>palpitations</b> being later diagnose...|$|R

25|$|The {{most common}} side effects are fine tremor, anxiety, headache, muscle cramps, dry mouth, and <b>palpitation.</b> Other {{symptoms}} may include tachycardia, arrhythmia, flushing of the skin, myocardial ischemia (rare), and disturbances {{of sleep and}} behaviour. Rarely occurring, but of importance, are allergic reactions of paradoxical bronchospasms, urticaria (hives), angioedema, hypotension, and collapse. High doses or prolonged use may cause hypokalemia, which is of concern especially in patients with renal failure and those on certain diuretics and xanthine derivatives.|$|E
25|$|Common {{manifestations of}} sensory issues include {{numbness}} or painful sensations {{in the arms}} and legs, abnormal sensations like “pins and needles,” and heat intolerance.

In many subjects, tenderness is seen upon the <b>palpitation</b> of muscles in the feet and legs. Certain people may also feel cramping sensations in the muscles affected and others say there is a burning sensation in their feet and calves.|$|E

500|$|The dried bark, however, {{is still}} an {{officinal}} drug and is listed in the modern Chinese materia medica as chun bai pi (...) , meaning [...] "white bark of spring". Modern works treat it in detail, discussing chemical constituents, how to identify the product and its pharmaceutical uses. It is prepared by felling the tree in fall or spring, stripping the bark and then scraping off the hardest, outermost portion, which is then sun-dried, soaked in water, partially re-dried in a basket and finally cut into strips. The bark {{is said to have}} cooling and astringent properties and is primarily used to treat dysentery, intestinal hemorrhage, menorrhagia and spermatorrhea. It is only prescribed in amounts between 4 and 10grams, so as not to poison the patients. Li's Compendium has 18 recipes that call for the bark. Asian and European chemists have found some justification for its medical use as it contains a long list of active chemicals that include quassin and saponin, while ailanthone, the allelopathic chemical in the tree of heaven, is a known antimalarial agent. It is available in most shops dealing in Chinese traditional medicine. A tincture of the root-bark has been used successfully in treating cardiac <b>palpitation,</b> asthma and epilepsy.|$|E

2500|$|The {{symptoms}} and signs, {{as described by}} physician John Caius and others, were as follows: the disease began very suddenly {{with a sense of}} apprehension, followed by cold shivers (sometimes very violent), giddiness, headache, and severe pains in the neck, shoulders and limbs, with great exhaustion. [...] After the cold stage, which might last from half an hour to three hours, the hot and sweating stage followed. [...] The characteristic sweat broke out suddenly without any obvious cause. [...] Accompanying the sweat, or after, was a sense of heat, headache, delirium, rapid pulse, and intense thirst. [...] <b>Palpitation</b> and pain in the heart were frequent symptoms. [...] No skin eruptions were noted by observers including Caius. [...] In the final stages, there was either general exhaustion and collapse, or an irresistible urge to sleep, which Caius thought to be fatal if the patient was permitted to give way to it. [...] One attack did not offer immunity, and some people suffered several bouts before dying. The disease tended to occur in summer and early autumn.|$|E
2500|$|Under {{pressure}} with organising Zoology and correcting proofs of his Journal (which had to {{have the}} introduction revised when FitzRoy complained that he was [...] "astonished at the total omission of any notice of the officers" [...] for their help), Darwin's health suffered.

Two days later he went to Maer Hall, the Wedgwoods' home, for a month of recuperation. His relations wore him out with questions about gaucho life. His invalid aunt was being cared for by the as-yet unmarried Emma, and his uncle Jos pointed out an area of ground where cinders had disappeared under loam which Jos though might have been the work of earthworms. Darwin returned to London on 21 October and on 1 November gave a talk on the role of earthworms in soil formation to the Geological Society, a mundane subject which to them may have seemed eccentric. William Buckland subsequently recommended Darwin's paper for publication, praising it as [...] "a new & important theory to explain Phenomena of universal occurrence {{on the surface of the}} Earth – in fact a new Geological Power", while rightly rejecting Darwin's suggestion that chalkland could have been formed in a similar way.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Introduction The {{sensation}} of <b>palpitations</b> may either be the initial or the only symptom of cardiac arrhythmia. We describe {{a case of}} an apparent clear temporal relationship between standard ibuprofen dosing and <b>palpitations.</b> A review of the medical literature revealed this to be, {{to the best of}} our knowledge, the first reported case of this type. Case presentation A 13 -year-old Caucasian girl initially presented to our clinic with hamstring tendinitis. She was commenced on a medication regimen of paracetamol and ibuprofen. After the third ibuprofen dose, she experienced <b>palpitations.</b> These were associated with lower chest and/or upper abdominal discomfort, and a feeling of being hot and sweaty. Her symptoms ceased upon the cessation of ibuprofen therapy. Conclusion Cardiac arrhythmia is a potentially fatal disorder that may exhibit heart <b>palpitations</b> as its initial (or only) symptom. The prompt recognition of the cause of the symptom can reduce mortality and morbidity associated with any underlying pathological processes. There is a need to investigate cases of recurrent <b>palpitations</b> so as to exclude underlying structural cardiac pathology and/or abnormal cardiac rhythm. </p...|$|R
