6000|$|When {{the strong}} {{aggressive}} hand of England has grasped some fresh {{portion of the}} earth's surface, there is yet a spirit of justice in her heart and head which <b>prompts</b> <b>the</b> <b>question,</b> among the first of such demands, as to how best and most fairly to deal by the natives of the newly-acquired land. In earlier times, when steam was not, and telegraphs and special correspondents were equally unknown agencies for getting at the truth of things, this question was more easily answered across a width of dividing ocean or continent. Then distant action might be prompt and sharp on emergency, {{and no one would}} be the wiser. But of late years, owing to these results of civilisation, harsh measures have, by the mere pressure of public opinion, and without consideration of their necessity {{in the eyes of the}} colonists, been set aside as impracticable and inhuman. In the case of Natal, most of the early questions of possession and right were settled, sword in hand, by the pioneer Dutch, who, after a space of terrible warfare, drove back the Zulus over the Tugela, and finally took possession of the land. But they did not hold it long. The same hateful invading Englishman, with his new ideas and his higher forms of civilisation, who had caused them to quit the [...] "Old Colony," [...] the land of their birth, came and drove them, vi et armis, from the land of their adoption. And it was not long before these same English became lords of this red African soil, from the coast up to the Drakensberg. Still there were difficulties; for although the new-comers might be lords of the soil, there remained yet a remnant, and a very troublesome remnant, of its original and natural masters: shattered fragments of the Zulu power in Natal, men who had once swept over the country in the army of Chaka the Terrible, Chaka of the Short Spear, but who had remained behind in the fair new land, when Chaka's raids had been checked by the white man and his deadly weapons. Remnants, too, of conquered aboriginal tribes, who had found even Chaka's rule easier than that of their own chieftains, swelled the amount to a total of some 100,000 souls.|$|E

5000|$|While Fight Club expresses [...] "radical" [...] slumming notions through lines like, [...] "Only when you've lost {{everything}} are you {{free to do}} anything," [...] the film is hostile to sentimental slumming. Gandal writes of the film's perception, [...] "Sentimentalism is an insidious lie that denies the realities of human life and the human body as it promises a fairy-tale experience that doesn't exist." [...] Additionally, one of Fight Clubs main characters, Tyler Durden, advocates methods of [...] "self-actualization and self-discovery", which are radical compared to those of [...] "wholesome" [...] heroes. While slumming dramas avoid physically degraded conditions, Fight Club embraces the conditions {{in a manner that}} [...] "mystifies and romanticizes the sordid". This approach differentiates from trauma films' approach of these conditions. Instead of the characters being paralyzed by traumas, the traumas are [...] "romantic" [...] traumas that [...] "shake people awake and remind them that they are alive and full of possibility". Through fight clubs, [...] "the desecrated body is a central image in slumming trauma" [...] with injuries being fetishes in the genre. [...] The romanticism is a paradox in the slumming trauma genre; the characters identify with decay to be [...] "purifying" [...] and identify with the degraded to be [...] "transcendent". The paradox is hinted not to be very stable; there are suggestions of [...] "humiliation and self-loathing". The love object Marla Singer accuses the narrator of having [...] "serious emotional problems", and there is anger among fight club members that they won't be [...] "millionaires and movie gods and rock stars". The narrator discovers that celebrity treatment as leader of the fight clubs <b>prompts</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> of how the narrator cannot be special. Gandal elaborates on the double-sided nature that results from the paradox: [...] "Either the narrator is discovering his aliveness in the body's vulnerability and power to harm, or he is degrading his body and others' out of traumatic self-loathing and depression... Either the film is pushing humility or indulging in a martial, even fascist, fantasy of celebrity." ...|$|E
