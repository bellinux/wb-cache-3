40|$|International audienceAccording to the {{directive}} on energy end-use efficiency and energy services (ESD), the European Member States shall adopt a national indicative energy savings target of 9 % (or beyond) in 2016. The {{issue of the}} energy savings evaluation is crucial for its implementation. The French White Certificates (FWC) scheme {{is one of the}} important measures for France to fulfill its ESD target. However, the accountings of energy savings in the FWC scheme and in the ESD are different. Therefore, an analysis of the consistency of the two systems is needed. A concrete example of actions on residential buildings is used to illustrate the challenges for policy marker and stakeholders to set harmonized evaluation rules. The FWC and ESD calculations appear to be consistent from a physics point of view, as long as calculations are well-documented. But due to differences in the policy objectives, calculation routines may be necessary to convert national energy savings unit (e. <b>g.,</b> <b>kWh</b> cumac) into supranational energy savings unit (e. <b>g.,</b> ESD <b>kWh).</b> Finally, the work done to establish a transparent evaluation system brings additional benefits (e. g., increased visibility and quality of the actions), which will improve the results of the energy efficiency policies on long term...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{large-scale}} pulsed corona system {{is described in}} which pulse parameters such as pulse rise-time, peak voltage, pulse width and energy per pulse can be varied. The chemical efficiency {{of the system is}} determined by measuring ozone production. The temporal and spatial development of the discharge streamers is recorded using an ICCD camera with a shortest exposure time of 5 ns. The camera can be triggered at any moment starting from the time the voltage pulse arrives on the reactor, with an accuracy of less than 1 ns. Measurements were performed on an industrial size wire-plate reactor. The influence of pulse parameters like pulse voltage, DC bias voltage, rise-time and pulse repetition rate on plasma generation was monitored. It was observed that for higher peak voltages, an increase could be seen in the primary streamer velocity, the growth of the primary streamer diameter, the light intensity and the number of streamers per unit length of corona wire. No significant separate influence of DC bias voltage level was observed as long as the total reactor voltage (pulse + DC bias) remained constant and the DC bias voltage remained below the DC corona onset. For those situations in which the plasma appearance changed (e. g. different streamer velocity, diameter, intensity), a change in ozone production was also observed. The best chemical yields were obtained for low voltage (55 kV), low energetic pulses (0. 4 J/pulse) : 60 <b>g</b> (<b>kWh)</b> - 1. For high voltage (86 kV), high energetic pulses (2. 3 J/pulse) the yield decreased to approximately 45 <b>g</b> (<b>kWh)</b> - 1, still a high value for ozone production in ambient air (RH 42 %).

The geometrical interpretation of gauge theories {{in terms of}} quasi principal fibre bundles Q(MS, GS) is reviewed. It is then described the Sp(2) algebra of ordinary Yang-Mills theory. A consistent formulation of covariant lagrangian quantisation for general gauge theories based on Sp(2) BRST symmetry is established. The original N = 1, ten dimensional superparticle is considered {{as an example of}} infinitely reducible gauge algebras, and given explicitly its Sp(2) BRST invariant action. 1. Gauge theories in terms of quasi-principal fibre bundles. Gauge theories have a nice geometrical interpretation in terms of connections on a principal fibre bundle (pfb) <b>P(M,</b> <b>G),</b> where M is the base space-time manifold and G is the gauge group [1, 2, 3, 4]. However, quantisation of gauge theories requires the introduction of fields (cn m, πn m). It would be then desirable to have a formalism where those extra fields fit into some representation of a larger group and all the fields are components of a superfield. This {{is a step in the}} direction of recovering a geometrical interpretation of quantum gauge theories. The main ingredients in the construction of geometrical quasiprincipal fibre bundles (qpfb) are a space-time base manifold M, a gauge group G, an extended superspace manifold MS which is obtained by adding two extra Grassmann variables θa (a = 1, 2) to M, in the case of Sp(2) symmetry, and a supergroup GS. The construction is performed basically in three steps [1, 2, 3]. It starts with a pfb <b>P(M,</b> <b>G)</b> and extend the gauge group G to a supergroup GS. The composition of G with a Grassmann algebra B prolongs <b>P(M,</b> <b>G)</b> to a pfb P ′(M, GS). The most general supergroup GS can be represented in matrix form. In particular, OSp(N/M) groups are represented by block matrices of the for...|$|R

Emission factors of CO, HC, PM and PN observed during ship manoeuvring were much higher than that of those recorded at cruising condition.
