40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} is to find the optimal values of sliding factors which {{influence}} the mechanical emotion of users when they use sliding type mobile phones. Background: There are various researches that study the emotion of using mobile phones. They focus the correlation between emotion words and design factors and use the commercial products by the subjects in the experiment. However, it has a limit in finding the optimal point of emotional factors because we can search the restricted values in the mass production of the products. Therefore, we will find the optimal points by realizing the full range of the user's mechanical emotion. Method: First, we need to get the detailed factors which can describe the mechanical emotion in sliding up and down the mobile phone. Next, we find the control factors by considering the correlation between the factors of the sliding emotion and the possibility of quantitative design. To find the optimal points on the control factors, we make a sliding evaluation system which can help users feel the sliding mechanical emotion by realizing control factors. Finally, we find the optimal points by doing the experiment the system being used. Results: The critical values of the factors which are the main variables of this study are Open Max Force and Dead <b>point</b> <b>Ratio.</b> The optimal point of the Open Max Force is 200 ~ 250 g/f, and the Dead <b>point</b> <b>Ratio</b> is 40 ~ 50 %.

40|$|Asymmetries of {{the vocal}} folds and vocal fold {{vibration}} are key features underlying unilateral vocal fold motion impairment (VFMI). The {{knowledge of what}} particular asymmetries contribute to breathy voice and which asymmetries must be eliminated to re-establish normal voice {{will be important to}} improving evaluation and treatment of VFMI. It was hypothesized that several structural and vibratory asymmetries should lead to predictable changes in the glottal area, flow, and acoustic waveforms, and subsequently a perceived breathy voice quality. The purpose of this project was threefold: 1) to determine how specific vocal fold structural and vibratory asymmetries alter vocal function and perceived voice quality, 2) to determine the improvement in vocal function and voice quality in an abnormal voice with elimination of individual asymmetries, and 3) to develop a battery of vocal function measures that vary with dysphonia in a predictable manner. The approach was to use a computational kinematic model of vocal fold vibration that allows for differential left/right control of parameters such as vocal fold adduction, medial surface bulging, vibratory nodal point, phase, amplitude of vibration, and fundamental frequency. The resultant signals were subjected to aerodynamic and acoustic measurement as well as perceptual rating of voice quality. Results revealed that the degree of vocal process separation was the most influential parameter tested, though asymmetry of bulging, nodal <b>point</b> <b>ratio,</b> and starting phase worsened normal voice quality. Conversely, increased symmetry of bulging, nodal <b>point</b> <b>ratio,</b> amplitude of vibration and starting phase improved disordered voice quality. The amount of improvement to disordered voices varied {{based on the number of}} other asymmetries present. None of the six vocal function measures tested were primarily responsive to one particular model parameter, though four measures generally decreased as vocal process separation increased: maximum flow declination rate (MFDR), spectral slope (B 0 -B 2), cepstral peak prominence (CPP), and harmonics-to-noise ratio (HNR). Two of the measures, MFDR and CPP, co-varied with each of the five parameters and robustly correlated with perceived severity...|$|E
40|$|The {{universal}} critical <b>point</b> <b>ratio</b> of {{the square}} of the second moment of the order parameter to its fourth moment, denoted as Q, is exploited to determine the position of the critical Ising transition lines in the phase diagram of the Ashkin-Teller (AT) model on the square lattice. A leading-order expansion of the Q ratio {{in the presence of a}} non-vanishing thermal field is found from finite-size scaling and the corresponding expression is fitted to the accurate perturbative transfer-matrix data for the L x L squaxe clusters with L <= 9. The same method is used to determine the critical Ising transition line on the phase diagram of the Blume-Capel (BC) model (L <= 11). We have also calculated the Q ratio for the q= 3 Potts model in the critical point.

40|$|In-space {{propulsion}} often necessitates {{the use of}} {{a capillary}} liquid acquisition device (LAD) to assure that gas-free liquid propellant is available to support engine restarts in microgravity. If a capillary screen-channel device is chosen, then the designer must determine the appropriate combination screen mesh and channel geometry. A screen mesh selection which results in the smallest LAD width when compared to any other screen candidate (for a constant length) is desirable; however, no best screen exists for all LAD design requirements. Flow rate, percent fill, and acceleration are the most influential drivers for determining screen widths. Increased flow rates and reduced percent fills increase the through-the-screen flow pressure losses, which drive the LAD to increased widths regardless of screen choice. Similarly, increased acceleration levels and corresponding liquid head pressures drive the screen mesh selection toward a higher bubble point (liquid retention capability). After ruling out some screens on the basis of acceleration requirements alone, candidates can be identified by examining screens with small flow-loss-to-bubble <b>point</b> <b>ratios</b> for a given condition (i. e., comparing screens at certain flow rates and fill levels). Within the same flow rate and fill level, the screen constants inertia resistance coefficient, void fraction, screen pore or opening diameter, and bubble point can become the driving forces in identifying the smaller flow-loss-to-bubble <b>point</b> <b>ratios...</b>|$|R
