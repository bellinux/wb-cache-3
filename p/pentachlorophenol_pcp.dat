Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Dominant commercial treatments currently used for wood preservation are <b>pentachlorophenols</b> (<b>PCP),</b> creosote, and chromium copper arsenicals. These wood preservatives present many studied and documented environmental and toxicological problems with both use of the products themselves, and with the production of secondary reaction contaminants. Furthermore, several of these preservatives are considered priority pollutants according to the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency and are heavily regulated. The need for an environmentally benign combined fire/rot retardant treatment for wood that will effectively reduce both fire and decay is clearly evident. Guayule resin, a co-by-product during rubber extraction from the guayule shrub, is being explored by us as a natural, biodegradable wood rot and fire retardant with potential commercial applications. Wood impregnated with guayule resin has survived over eight years in tropical soils, free of rot, decay, and insect infestations. This study qualitatively analyzed the treated and untreated wood samples for ignitability, flame spread, toxic fumes, and smoke generation. Ignitability of the wood sample of fixed geometry was quantified by measuring the time required for ignition of treated samples vs. untreated samples. Flame spread was measured after ignition with a propane flame by a simple stopwatch-ruler technique. Smoke mass was determined in an Arapahoe Smoke Chamber as per ASTM D- 4100. Analysis of the fumes involved continuous CO, C 02, NOx, SOx, and 02 analyses using the Bacharach Instrument Model 300. Cascade impaction was used to determine the particle size distribution of the smoke and for smoke mass determination. Respirable particles were assessed by utilizing the Anderson 2000 Inc. 1 AFCM Ambient Particle Fractionating Sampler. Inflections of guayule-impregnated and untreated pine are indeed minor with respect to all aspects investigated. Ignition data indicated guayule-impregnated pine did not ignite as quickly as untreated pine. Evidence conveys favorable consideration for further research of wood preservation with guayule resin...|$|R
40|$|The {{adsorption}} {{of three}} organic micropollutants (diclofenac – DFN, <b>pentachlorophenol</b> – <b>PCP</b> and octylphenol – OP) on {{two kinds of}} carbon nanotubes (single walled carbon nanotubes – SWCNT and single walled carbon nanotubes with amine group – SWCNT-NH 2) was investigated, in single and bicomponent solution at pH 5. SWCNT-NH 2 had three times lower specific surface area than SWCNT. Significant differences were observed in sorption capacity of SWCNT and SWCNT-NH 2 for given chemicals. The sorption uptake changes in the following order: OP > PCP > DFN for SWCNT and DFN > PCP > OP for SWCNT-NH 2. A few times higher adsorption of OP on SWCNT came from low OP solubility in water in comparison to PCP and DFN. While, higher adsorption of DFN and PCP on SWCNT-NH 2 {{was a result of}} electrostatic attraction between dissociated form of these chemicals and positively charged SWCNT-NH 2 at pH 5. In adsorption from bicomponent solution, significant competition was observed between PCP and DFN due to similar adsorption mechanism on SWCNT-NH 2. Opposite tendency was observed for SWCNT, DFN did not greatly affect adsorption of PCP and OP since they were very easily absorbable by sigma-sigma interaction...|$|R

40|$|The {{method of}} {{enriching}} <b>PCP</b> (<b>pentachlorophenol)</b> from aquatic environment by solid phase extraction (SPE) was studied. Several factors affecting the recoveries of PCP, including sample pH, eluting solvent, eluting volume and flow {{rate of water}} sample, were optimized by orthogonal array design (OAD). The optimized results were sample pH 4; eluting solvent, 100 % methanol; eluting solvent volume, 2 ml and {{flow rate of water}} sample, 4 ml/min. A comparison is made between SPE and liquid-liquid extraction(LLE) method. The recoveries of PCP were in the range of 87. 6 %- 133. 6 % and 79 %- 120. 3 % for SPE and LLE, respectively. Important advantages of the SPE compared with the LLE include the short extraction time and reduced consumption of organic solvents.

30|$|The {{agricultural}} {{use of pesticides}} that contained PCDD/Fs as an impurity [e.g., 2, 4 -D, 2, 4, 5 -T, PCP, CNP, pentachloronitrobenzene (PCNB)] {{was one of the}} most important PCDD/F release sources to the environment. Due to the use of contaminated <b>PCP</b> (<b>pentachlorophenol)</b> and CNP (chloronitrophen) in the 1950 s– 1980 s, approx. 460  kg TEQ has been released into rice fields in Japan, resulting in soil dioxin levels of 30 – 330  ng TEQ/kg dm [173, 174], considerably above safe levels for raising cattle or producing milk. Some pesticides previously used in agriculture in Germany were also contaminated with PCDD/Fs, however, at lower levels [170] compared to those used in Japan [130, 169]. A survey of PCDD/Fs and PCBs in agricultural soils in Germany shows relatively low levels [63], indicating low-PCDD/F input on agricultural land from pesticide use. However, PCDD/F levels in garden soils in a survey in south Germany (e.g., up to 74  ng TEQ/kg dm) indicated that PCDD/Fs have been released to these soils. In addition to pesticides, other likely sources include PCP use on wood in gardens, ashes from uncontrolled waste incineration in domestic heating systems, and backyard burning. The PCDD/F congener profile in soils and chicken eggs is similar to the PCDD/F congener profile in technical grade PCP [17, 111, 124].|$|R
50|$|Although PCNB {{has a long}} shelflife, it is labile in soil, with a half life of 1.8 days.

50|$|POPRC-7 {{considered}} three {{proposals for}} listing in Annexes A, B and/or C of the Convention: chlorinated naphthalenes (CNs), hexachlorobutadiene (HCBD) and <b>pentachlorophenol</b> (<b>PCP),</b> its salts and esters. The proposal {{is the first}} stage of the POPRC's work in assessing a substance, and requires the POPRC to assess whether the proposed chemical satisfies the criteria in Annex D of the Convention. The criteria for forwarding a proposed chemical to the risk profile preparation stage are persistence, bioaccumulation, potential for long-range environmental transport (LRET), and adverse effects.|$|E
50|$|From 1948 to 2001, the Oroville Plant {{conducted}} {{wood treatment}} operations to prevent wood from deteriorating. In 1963, an on-site fire released 20,000 gallons of <b>pentachlorophenol</b> (<b>PCP)</b> from tanks onto the soil. Another fire was documented in 1987 releasing {{high levels of}} dioxins. With many orders and remedial actions {{to clean up the}} site, KCI Superfund Site is under monitored recovery to clean the affected groundwater and soil contamination. The goal is to return the original source of groundwater to the 10,650 people living in the surrounding area.|$|E
5000|$|The plant {{operated}} from 1902 until 1981, {{when the}} company filed for bankruptcy. Before 1950, creosote was the primary wood preservative chemical, and after 1950 <b>pentachlorophenol</b> (<b>PCP)</b> became the preferred chemical. Prior to 1970, operators discharged liquid process wastes into two onsite, unlined, percolation ponds which were allowed to overflow into Bayou Chico and Pensacola Bay. Later, workers drew wastewaters off the ponds periodically and discharged them into designated [...] "spillage areas" [...] on site. Additional discharges occurred when heavy rainfall flooded the ponds, which then overflowed their dikes.|$|E
50|$|For example, in a {{study on}} the removal of <b>pentachlorophenol</b> (<b>PCP)</b> using {{different}} strains of fungal biomass, as the pH changed from low pH to high pH (acidic to basic) the amount of removal decreased by the majority of the strains, however one strain was unaffected by the change. In another study on the removal of copper, zinc and nickel ions using a composite sorbent as the pH increased from low to high the sorbent favored the removal of copper ions over the zinc and nickel ions. Because of the variability in sorbent this might be a drawback to biosorption, however, more research will be necessary.|$|E
50|$|The {{process of}} wood {{treatment}} requires many chemicals such as <b>pentachlorophenol</b> (<b>PCP),</b> dioxins, dibenzofuran, {{polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons}} (PAH), and heavy metals such as copper, chromium, and arsenic. PCP was first discovered in groundwater and in nearby residential wells in 1971. The most abundant of these chemicals present at the superfund site is PCP. Long-term exposure to low levels of PCP, through soil exposure or water exposure, can lead to carcinogenic, renal, and neurological effects. The Environmental Protection Agency's maximum contaminant level in water is 1 parts per billion (ppb). Some wells most recently measured at the site in 2007 still had concentrations of PCP above 15 ppb.|$|E
50|$|As {{a result}} of the collision, some {{hazardous}} cargo from Testbank was released. Specifically, four cargo containers carrying mixed freight were lost overboard, releasing a significant amount of <b>pentachlorophenol</b> (<b>PCP)</b> into the canal waters. The amount of PCP lost was reported as between 12 and 12.5 tons. There were two other damaged containers containing PCP reported on the deck of Testbank. In addition, a number of barrels containing hydrobromic acid were lost overboard, and others broke open and spilled onto the deck of Testbank, creating a cloud of gas around both ships. Crews were able to clean up the hydrobromic acid within a few days, but the PCP proved to be a greater challenge. Stored in 50 lb paper sacks, the coarse granules of PCP rapidly sank {{to the bottom of the}} channel where visibility was nearly zero. Chemical analysis of the PCP product revealed primarily PCP, tetrachlorphenol and trichlorophenol. Notably, the product also contained several polychlorinated dibenzodioxins, which are known for their toxicity and bioaccumulation. At the time, this was the largest spill of pentachlorophenol in United States history. The United States Coast Guard closed the canal until August 10, 1980. Additionally, all fishing and shrimping operations in a 400 sq mi area were temporarily suspended.|$|E
