5|$|A <b>pH</b> <b>indicator</b> is a {{weak acid}} or weak base that changes colour in the {{transition}} pH range, which is approximately pKa±1. The design of a universal indicator requires a mixture of indicators whose adjacent pKa values differ by about two, so that their transition pH ranges just overlap.|$|E

25|$|A {{solution}} of phenol red {{is used as}} a <b>pH</b> <b>indicator,</b> often in cell culture. Its color exhibits a gradual transition from yellow (λmax = 443nm) to red (λmax = 570nm) over the pH range 6.8 to 8.2. Above pH 8.2, phenol red turns a bright pink (fuchsia) color.|$|E
40|$|Subacute ruminal {{acidosis}} (SARA) {{is usually}} characterized by abnormal and intermittent drops in rumen pH. Nevertheless, high individual animal variability in rumen pH {{and the difference}} in measurement methods for pH data acquisition decrease the sensitivity and accuracy of <b>pH</b> <b>indicators</b> for detecting SARA in ruminants. The {{aim of this study}} was to refine rumen <b>pH</b> <b>indicators</b> in long-term SARA based on individual dairy cow reticulo-rumen pH kinetics. Animal performances and rumen parameters were studied weekly in order to validate SARA syndrome and rumen pH was continuously measured using reticulo-rumen sensors. In total, 11 primiparous dairy cows were consecutively fed two different diets for 12 successive weeks: a control diet as low-starch diet (LSD; 13 % starch for 4 weeks in period 1), an acidotic diet as high-starch diet (HSD; 32 % starch for 4 weeks in period 2), and again the LSD diet (3 weeks in period 3). There was a 1 -week dietary transition between LSD and HSD. Commonly used absolute SARA <b>pH</b> <b>indicators</b> such as daily average, area under the curve (AUC) and time spent below pH < 5. 8 and pH < 6 were processed from absolute (raw) daily kinetics. Then signal processing was applied to raw pH values in order to calculate relative <b>pH</b> <b>indicators</b> by filtering and normalizing data to remove inter-individual variability, sensor drift and sensor noise. Normalized AUC, times spent below NpH <− 0. 3 and NpH <− 0. 5, NpH range and NpH standard deviation were calculated. Those relative <b>pH</b> <b>indicators</b> were compared with commonly used <b>pH</b> <b>indicators</b> to assess their ability to detect SARA. This syndrome induced by HSD was confirmed by consistent expected changes in milk quality, dry matter intake and acetate : propionate ratio in the rumen, whereas the ruminal concentration of lipopolysaccharide was increased. Commonly used <b>pH</b> SARA <b>indicators</b> were not able to discriminate SARA syndrome due to high animal variability and sensor drift and noise, whereas relative <b>pH</b> <b>indicators</b> developed in this study appeared more relevant for SARA detection as assessed by receiver operating characteristic tests. This work shows that absolute pH kinetics should be corrected for drift, noise and animal variability to produce relative <b>pH</b> <b>indicators</b> that are more robust for SARA detection. These relative <b>pH</b> <b>indicators</b> could be more relevant for identifying affected animals in a herd and also for comparing SARA risk among studies...|$|R

40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of <b>pH</b> <b>indicators</b> is always confined in acidic solvents {{used during the}} immobilization {{because of the large}} deviation from their color transition points. By regulating the <b>pH</b> of <b>indicators</b> using organic acid or base, the color transition points of indicators could be readily achieved and the sensitivity could be greatly enhanced. In this study, bromophenol blue was selected as an example to interpret this improvement. And Hue, Saturation and Value (HSV) color model was applied to obtain digital color information of <b>pH</b> <b>indicators.</b> In addition, other two kinds of <b>pH</b> <b>indicators</b> were chosen and regulated to their color transition points as well. The resultant indicators together with the original ones were composed to a colorimetric sensor array and utilized to determine fish freshness. Compared with the original indicators, much higher sensitivity in the detection of fish freshness was obtained by the <b>pH</b> regulated <b>indicators.</b> (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V.

25|$|While the {{rudimentary}} {{method of}} testing pH is to expose the grape juice to a <b>pH</b> <b>indicator</b> such as the strips used for a standard litmus test, the results are usually not as detailed and accurate as {{what is needed to}} evaluate ripeness. Therefore, most wineries will us a pH meter that can give readings to an accuracy of plus or minus 0.1. As with sugars and acids, the ideal pH levels to determine ripeness will vary. For white wines, winemakers often look for pH readings between 3.1 and 3.2, while would be a maximum of 3.4. If the pH is too high, it may be a sign that the grapes are overripe (or that the soil has too much potassium which will also influence pH readings). While there are risks to letting the pH go too high, winemakers can counter high pH by adding more tartaric or malic acid during the winemaking. However many viticulturists and winemakers uses pH readings as a strong boundary line for when to start the harvest.|$|E

Because of the subjective choice (determination) of color, <b>pH</b> <b>indicators</b> are susceptible to imprecise readings. For applications requiring precise measurement of pH, a pH meter is frequently used. Sometimes, a blend of different indicators is used to achieve several smooth color changes over a wide range of pH values. These commercial indicators (e.g., universal indicator and Hydrion papers) are used when only rough knowledge of pH is necessary.|$|R

50|$|In acid-base titrations, an {{unfitting}} <b>pH</b> <b>indicator</b> {{may induce}} a color {{change in the}} indicator-containing solution {{before or after the}} actual equivalence point. As a result, different equivalence points for a solution can be concluded based on the <b>pH</b> <b>indicator</b> used. This is because the slightest color change of the indicator-containing solution suggests the equivalence point has been reached. Therefore, the most suitable <b>pH</b> <b>indicator</b> has an effective pH range, where the change in color is apparent, that encompasses the pH of the equivalence point of the solution being titrated.|$|E

To extend the receptive field of optical sensors, we explore the design of composite materials, where the molecular interaction among the subunits enriches their sensing working mechanisms. We demonstrate that blends of single metalloporphyrins and <b>pH</b> <b>indicators,</b> tested with a transduction apparatus based on ubiquitous and easily available hardware, can be endowed with sensing properties wider than those of single constituents, enabling the recognition of a broad range of volatiles...|$|R
