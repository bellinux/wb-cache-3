25|$|In the 1990s, {{country music}} became a {{worldwide}} phenomenon thanks to Garth Brooks, who enjoyed {{one of the}} most successful careers in popular music history, breaking records for both sales and concert attendance throughout the decade. The RIAA has certified his recordings at a combined (128× platinum), denoting roughly 113 million U.S. shipments. Other artists that experienced success during this time included Clint Black, Sammy Kershaw, Aaron Tippin, Travis Tritt, Alan Jackson and the newly formed duo of Brooks & Dunn; George Strait, whose career began in the 1980s, also continued to have widespread success in this decade and beyond. Toby Keith began his career as a more pop-oriented country singer in the 1990s, evolving into an outlaw persona in the late 1990s with <b>Pull</b> <b>My</b> Chain and its follow-up, Unleashed.|$|E

500|$|Ki {{was mixed}} by Townsend, and {{features}} very little compression, {{in contrast with}} his usual wall-of-sound production style. Townsend explained that he originally [...] "tried doing the wall-of-sound with it and {{it just kind of}} ruined it...it turned it into a not-so-good Strapping record." [...] The album deliberately eschews the loudness wars, the recent music industry practice of competitively mastering audio to seem as loud as possible. [...] "I officially <b>pull</b> <b>my</b> hat out of the loudness wars", Townsend told his mastering engineer. The album's songs were primarily written in open C tuning, except for [...] "A Monday", [...] "Trainfire", and [...] "Disruptr" [...] in open B, [...] "Heaven's End" [...] and [...] "Winter" [...] in open B, and [...] "Quiet Riot" [...] in standard tuning. Townsend has cited Second Nature by The Young Gods, Paul Horn, Chants of India by Ravi Shankar, and Ween as influences on the album.|$|E

[...] He went on to say: [...] "We have got an awesome bunch of guys in this squad... but I have such respect for Cambridge... with a lighter crew we've turned round the biggest weight deficit in history." [...] Nethercott remarked [...] "I really thought we had lost. [...] In the space of a few seconds I went from the lowest point in my life to absolute, unbridled ecstasy." [...] The Cambridge oarsman James Livingston said [...] "It was the worst margin to lose by. I just wish I could stop losing these epic races" [...] while the Cambridge coach Williams described the defeat as a [...] "blow to the heart". Wooge was disappointed: [...] "I <b>pull</b> <b>my</b> hat off to Oxford, that was an amazing race." [...] Rankov later revealed [...] "It’s the hardest I’ve ever had to work in an umpiring situation." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the years}} before Slipknot formed, a state of {{shifting}} band membership existed throughout the metal scene in Des Moines, Iowa. In 1991, the biggest metal band in Des Moines was Atomic Opera, with Jim Root on guitar. Drummer Joey Jordison founded a thrash metal band called Modifidious, playing at a club called Runway. Modifidious opened for Atomic Opera on December 1, 1991, at the Runway, after which their guitarist left for the more successful Atomic Opera. Jordison replaced him with local guitarist Craig Jones. Drummer Shawn Crahan formed another Des Moines band called Heads on the Wall, playing funk metal cover songs at clubs and releasing a demo tape in July 1992. A fourth Des Moines band called Vexx played death metal with Anders Colsefni on drums, Paul Gray on bass, and Josh Brainard on guitar and vocals. Colsefni later took over vocal duties, but Vexx never recorded. During this time, Crahan often went to the Runway on Sundays when the club opened to all ages, where he met other young musicians with whom he could jam. By March 1993, Crahan was jamming with vocalist Colsefni, bassist Gray and guitarist Pat Neuwirth, writing and playing songs in Gray's basement, discussing possible band names such as <b>Pull</b> <b>My</b> Finger, but never making a final decision. One of the songs they recorded was titled [...] "Slipknot"; another was titled [...] "Painface", which Colsefni later used to name his band Painface.|$|E
500|$|Xhinovci {{has come}} to believe that he is Hitler reincarnated since he began {{dressing}} as the Nazi leader. He carries numerous pieces of Nazi paraphernalia around with him, including Nazi-era Reichsmarks, swastika-emblazoned buttons, scarves embroidered with swastikas and other Nazi imagery, as well as a copy of Mein Kampf. He has business cards featuring a swastika and the word [...] "Hitler" [...] printed in bold. Locals and peacekeepers alike do not seem to mind Xhinovci's Hitler impersonations, especially as many Kosovars are too preoccupied with the country's crippling poverty and rampant corruption to give his actions much thought. On the contrary, many passersby—including some NATO peacekeepers—stop and greet him with the Nazi salute. One local told Vice News: [...] "I have {{a lot of other things}} to worry about in my life. I might look at him if he walks by, but that's it." [...] Locals apparently believe that his way of earning a living [...] "shows great enterprise". [...] "People respect me," [...] Xhinovci explains. [...] "The young and old [...] men, women and children. Everyone greets me with [...] "Heil Hitler". Xhinovci's five daughters, referred to locally as [...] "Hitler's children", are not bothered by their father's Hitler impersonations. Xhinovci reportedly attends parent-teacher conferences dressed as Hitler and says that teachers and other parents do not mind his appearance. He says that every time he goes to pick his daughters up from school he is surrounded by children who want to talk with him and take pictures. [...] "Girls like to touch my face. They think it's a mask. They <b>pull</b> <b>my</b> hair and ask if they can kiss me on the face. When I'm out of the house with my family, people stop to talk to me. But my wife is not a jealous person—she doesn't mind." ...|$|E

2500|$|Following {{this album}} was <b>Pull</b> <b>My</b> Chain, {{released}} in August 2001. The album's three singles — [...] "I'm Just Talkin' About Tonight", [...] "I Wanna Talk About Me", and [...] "My List" [...] — {{all went to}} number 1 on the country charts, with the latter two both holding that position for five weeks. [...] "I Wanna Talk About Me", written by Bobby Braddock, also displayed a country rap influence with its spoken-word lyrics. The Country Music Association named [...] "My List" [...] as Single of the Year in 2002. Of <b>Pull</b> <b>My</b> Chain, Erlewine wrote that [...] "this is a bigger, better record than its predecessor, possessing a richer musicality and a more confident sense of humor".|$|E
2500|$|Kerouac {{also wrote}} and narrated a beat movie titled <b>Pull</b> <b>My</b> Daisy (1959), {{directed}} by Robert Frank and Alfred Leslie.

2500|$|Signed to DreamWorks Records Nashville in 1998, Keith {{released}} his breakthrough single [...] "How Do You Like Me Now?!" [...] that year. This song, {{the title track}} to his 1999 album of the same name, was the number one country song of 2000, and one of several chart-toppers during his tenure on DreamWorks Nashville. His next three albums, <b>Pull</b> <b>My</b> Chain, Unleashed, and Shock'n Y'all, produced three more number ones each, {{and all of the}} albums were certified 4x Platinum. A second Greatest Hits package followed in 2004, and after that, he released Honkytonk University.|$|E
2500|$|Daily Nebraskan {{gave the}} album A− {{and called it}} [...] "one of this years best rock records". Consequence of Sound gave the album {{four out of five}} stars and called it [...] "best Corgan work in a long time". CraveOnline gave Oceania an 8 out of 10 review, stating that [...] "If Oceania is a {{testament}} of what's to come, I may need to <b>pull</b> <b>my</b> old Smashing Pumpkin t-shirt out of the closet." [...] SPIN gave a rating of 7 out of 10, declaring that it is [...] "easily Corgan's best work since his rat-in-a-cage heyday." [...] The Seattle Post-Intelligencer scored the album with 4.5 out of five stars, stating it [...] "is full of winners." [...] The album was listed at #48 on Rolling Stone's list of the top 50 albums of 2012, saying [...] "The most recent dispatch from whatever far-off planet Billy Corgan currently resides on is the finest slab of cosmic prog he's thrown down since the Pumpkins' early-Nineties heyday." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2002, he {{released}} the Unleashed album which included four singles. First was [...] "Courtesy of the Red, White, & Blue (The Angry American)", which Keith wrote in 20 minutes {{as a response}} to the September 11, 2001 attacks. The song references Keith's father, a United States Army veteran who died that March in a car accident. Both this song and [...] "Who's Your Daddy?" [...] were number 1 hits, with [...] "Rock You Baby" [...] reaching number 13. The last single was [...] "Beer for My Horses", a duet with Willie Nelson which six weeks at the top of the country charts. At the time, it was also Keith's highest entry on the Hot 100, at number 22. In July 2003, Keith made a guest appearance on Scotty Emerick's debut single [...] "I Can't Take You Anywhere", which was previously recorded by Keith on <b>Pull</b> <b>My</b> Chain. Emerick's version of the song was his only top 40 country hit, at number 27.|$|E

2500|$|Rathbone {{was also}} one to dismiss the {{complaints}} {{in an interview with}} MTV, saying, [...] "I think it's {{one of those things where}} I <b>pull</b> <b>my</b> hair up, shave the sides, and I definitely need a tan. It's one of those things where, hopefully, the audience will suspend disbelief a little bit." [...] The controversy was poorly received by critics as well. Film critic Roger Ebert was one of the critical voices against the casting. When asked about casting a white cast to portray the characters, he said, [...] "The original series Avatar: The Last Airbender was highly regarded and popular for three seasons on Nickelodeon. Its fans take it for granted that its heroes are Asian. Why would Paramount and Shyamalan go out of their way to offend these fans? There are many young Asian actors capable of playing the parts." [...] Jevon Phillips of the Los Angeles Times noted that despite Shyamalan's attempts to defuse the situation, [...] "this is definitely not an issue that will fade away or be overlooked" [...] and that this film exemplifies the need for a debate within Hollywood about racial diversity in its films.|$|E
2500|$|In April 2012, an Internet meme [...] "Texts from Hillary", hosted on Tumblr {{and based}} around a {{photograph}} of Clinton sitting on a military plane wearing sunglasses and using a mobile phone, imagined the recipients and contents of her text messages. It became suddenly popular and earned the endorsement of Clinton herself, before being brought to an end by its creators. Obama himself took note of the meme's popularity, in a humorous exchange that revealed the ease the two now had around one another. Around the same time, a photograph taken during the 6th Summit of the Americas in Cartagena, Colombia, showed Clinton {{with a group of}} colleagues relaxing, drinking Águila beer from a bottle and dancing, at a local nightclub. The episode gained front-page attention from the New York Post and illustrated how Clinton was enjoying the job. Regarding her ongoing popularity, Clinton said, [...] "There's a certain consistency to who I am and what I do, and I think people have finally said, 'Well, you know, I kinda get her now.'" [...] One long-time Washington figure summarized the situation by simply saying, [...] "There's no coin in criticizing her anymore." [...] At the same time, her fashion choices gained renewed attention, with her hair grown long and sometimes pulled back with scrunchies. Public commentary on Clinton's hair was now a tradition across twenty years, but as one female State Department traveller said, [...] "As a chick, it's a big pain in the butt. The weather is different, and you’re {{in and out of the}} plane. [...] gets off that plane looking like garbage most days, but she has to look camera ready. She said the reason she grew her hair long was that it's easier. She has options." [...] Clinton professed she was past the point of concern on the matter: [...] "I feel so relieved to be at the stage I'm at in my life right now, [...] because if I want to wear my glasses, I'm wearing my glasses. If I want to <b>pull</b> <b>my</b> hair back, I'm pulling my hair back." [...] In any case, Clinton showed a much more relaxed attitude vis a vis the press than in past eras.|$|E
