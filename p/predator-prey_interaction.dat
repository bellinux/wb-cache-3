25|$|In {{order to}} study {{predation}} and population oscillations, Huffaker used mite species, one being the predator {{and the other}} being the prey. He set up a controlled experiment using oranges, which the prey fed on, as the spatially structured habitat in which the predator and prey would interact. At first, Huffaker experienced difficulties {{similar to those of}} Gause in creating a stable <b>predator–prey</b> <b>interaction.</b> By using oranges only, the prey species quickly became extinct followed consequently with predator extinction. However, he discovered that by modifying the spatial structure of the habitat, he could manipulate the population dynamics and allow the overall survival rate for both species to increase. He did this by altering the distance between the prey and oranges (their food), establishing barriers to predator movement, and creating corridors for the prey to disperse. These changes resulted in increased habitat patches and in turn provided more areas for the prey to seek temporary protection. When the prey would become extinct locally at one habitat patch, they were able to reestablish by migrating to new patches before being attacked by predators. This habitat spatial structure of patches allowed for coexistence between the predator and prey species and promoted a stable population oscillation model. Although the term metapopulation had not yet been coined, the environmental factors of spatial heterogeneity and habitat patchiness would later describe the conditions of a metapopulation relating to how groups of spatially separated populations of species interact with one another. Huffaker's experiment is significant because it showed how metapopulations can directly affect the predator–prey interactions and in turn influence population dynamics.|$|E

40|$|While aquatic environments {{have long}} been thought to be more {{moderate}} environments than their terrestrial cousins, environmental data demonstrate that for some systems this is not so. Numerous important environmental parameters can fluctuate dramatically, notably dissolved oxygen, turbidity and temperature. The roles of dissolved oxygen and turbidity on <b>predator–prey</b> <b>interactions</b> have been discussed in detail elsewhere within this issue and will be considered only briefly here. Here, we will focus primarily {{on the role of}} temperature and its potential impact upon <b>predator–prey</b> <b>interactions.</b> Two key properties are of particular note. For temperate aquatic ecosystems, all piscine and invertebrate piscivores and their prey are ectothermic. They will therefore be subject to energetic demands that are significantly affected by environmental temperature. Furthermore, the physical properties of water, particularly its high thermal conductivity, mean that thermal microenvironments will not exist so that fine-scale habitat movements will not be an option for dealing with changing water temperature in lentic environments. Unfortunately, there has been little experimental analysis of the role of temperature on such <b>predator–prey</b> <b>interactions,</b> so we will instead focus on theoretical work, indicating that potential implications associated with thermal change are unlikely to be straightforward and may present a greater threat to predators than to their prey. Specifically, we demonstrate that changes in the thermal environment can result in a net benefit to cold-adapted species through the mechanism of <b>predator–prey</b> <b>interactions...</b>|$|R

A trophic function represents the consumption of prey assuming a given number of predators. The trophic function (also {{referred to as the}} functional response) was widely applied in chemical kinetics, biophysics, mathematical physics and economics. In economics, [...] "predator" [...] and [...] "prey" [...] become various economic parameters such as prices and outputs of goods in various linked sectors such as processing and supply.

50|$|While host-parasite and mutualistic {{interactions}} {{are determined by}} task-based phenotypes, predator-prey {{interactions are}} determined by behavior. Predators are digital organisms that have evolved from ancestral prey phenotypes to locate, attack, and consume organisms. When a predator executes an attack instruction (acquired through mutation), it kills a neighboring organism. When predators kill prey, they gain resources required for reproduction (e.g., CPU cycles) proportional to the level accumulated by the consumed prey. Selection favors behavioral strategies in prey {{that enable them to}} avoid being eaten. At the same time, selection favors predators with behavioral strategies that improve their food finding and prey attacking abilities. The resulting diversity in the continuously evolving behavioral phenotypes creates dynamic <b>predator-prey</b> <b>interaction</b> networks in which selective forces are constantly changing {{as a consequence of the}} emergence of new, and loss of old, behaviors. Because predators and prey move around in and use information about their environment, these experiments are typically carried out using spatially structured populations. On the other hand, host-parasite and mutualistic coevolution are often done in well-mixed environments, though the choice of the environment is at the discretion of the experimenter.|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of <b>predator-prey</b> systems and <b>interactions</b> on wildlife passage use by mammals has received {{little attention to}} date. Predator-prey systems vary throughout the world and across regions. Europe and North America are characterised largely by predator-prey systems in which predator and prey have co-evolved. However, large predators are absent from many areas, enabling prey species (e. g., ungulates) to range in predator-free environments. In mainland Australia, the main predator species are evolutionary novel and have not co-evolved with native prey. These fundamental differences in predator-prey systems potentially influence species’ behavior and, it is argued, species’ response to passage environments. Predator-prey systems also operate at different spatial scales. The spatial distribution of large mammals is influenced by regional scale <b>predator-prey</b> <b>interactions</b> that potentially influence the species encountering passages. Medium-sized and small mammals tend to operate at more refined geographical scales and passage avoidance or acceptance may be more influenced by localised <b>predator-prey</b> <b>interactions</b> {{and in response to}} the passage structure. Biotic interactions at passage approaches and within passage confines potentially influence the successful transit of the passage. This paper examines the documented and potential {{influence of}} <b>predator-prey</b> <b>interactions</b> on wildlife passage use by mammals, and passage effects on predator and prey <b>interactions.</b> It considers <b>predator-prey</b> relationships relative to various spatial scales and takes into account biotic interactions that may occur at passage sites. The potential influences of relaxed selection and co-evolution of predator and prey on predator-prey systems and mammalian responses to passage environments are particularly addressed. It is concluded that extrapolation of management recommendations resulting from passage studies under different predator-prey systems need to be treated cautiously. The influence of <b>predator-prey</b> <b>interactions</b> on passage response by mammalian fauna appears to have been underestimated in passage studies to date and warrants further scientific investigation...|$|R
