40|$|Indium- 111 radioimmunoscintigraphy (RIS) has an {{increasing}} {{role in the}} treatment of prostate cancer and is most commonly performed at this disease site using labeled monoclonal antibody against prostate-specific membrane antigen. There are many limitations <b>of</b> <b>RIS,</b> including low spatial resolution, low diagnostic yield and limited availability. Despite these limitations, the efficacy <b>of</b> <b>RIS</b> has been demonstrated in many clinical studies, including multi-institutional investigations. The highest sensitivity and specificity <b>of</b> <b>RIS</b> appears to be in the post-radical retropubic prostatectomy (post-RRP) setting. RIS has recently been explored for its role in clinical radiotherapy decision-making, and was found to have a significant impact in selecting patients for radiotherapy and for the general radiotherapy treatment volume definition. RIS has also recently been explored for its role in radiotherapy planning and was found to impact clinical target volume design. However, manual editing <b>of</b> the <b>RIS</b> volume is still necessary when projected into the radiotherapy-planning scan, as there is often overlap in the RIS-defined uptake regions with normal structures (rectum, bladder and symphysis bone marrow). The impact <b>of</b> <b>RIS</b> on biochemical control has been explored, with studies in this area yielding conflicting results. It appears that the maximum impact <b>of</b> <b>RIS</b> is possible when areas of labeled antibody uptake regions are co-registered with the radiotherapy-planning computed tomography scan. The larger RIS-guided target volumes {{do not appear to be}} prohibitive in increasing radiotherapy-related toxicity. Future directions of the use <b>of</b> <b>RIS</b> for post-RRP prostate cancer are discussed...|$|R

A widely accepted pharmacodynamic mechanism underlying EPS includes {{an increase in}} striatal D 2 -receptor occupancy. However, less {{is known about the}} pharmacokinetic background of EPS. The aim {{of this study was to}} analyze in-vivo possible pharmacokinetic patterns underlying biperiden-treated EPS in risperidone (RIS) -medicated patients. A large therapeutic drug monitoring database containing plasma concentrations <b>of</b> <b>RIS</b> and its metabolite 9 -hydroxyrisperidone (9 -OH-RIS) of 2293 adult inpatients and outpatients was analyzed. Two groups were compared: a group receiving RIS (n= 772) and a group comedicated with biperiden (n= 68). Plasma concentrations, dose-adjusted plasma concentrations (C/D) <b>of</b> <b>RIS,</b> 9 -OH-RIS, and active moiety (AM) (RIS+ 9 -OH-RIS) as well as ratios of concentrations for metabolite to parent drug (9 -OH-RIS/RIS) were computed. We compared the plasma concentrations of the different compounds between the two groups considering the prescription of biperiden as an indirect report of EPS. The daily dosage <b>of</b> <b>RIS</b> did not differ between groups. No differences were detected in case of plasma concentrations and C/D <b>of</b> <b>RIS</b> and active metabolite between the groups. However, plasma concentrations of the AM were significantly higher in the comedicated group (P= 0. 032) and showed a trend in terms of the active metabolite 9 -OH-RIS (P= 0. 053). Data indicate enhanced AM plasma concentrations <b>of</b> <b>RIS</b> in patients comedicated with biperiden as an EPS treatment.

The distinct pitch <b>of</b> <b>RIS</b> is introduced by delaying random noise and adding {{it back to}} the same noise. The relation between the psychoacoustically measured pitch <b>of</b> <b>RIS</b> and the auditory evoked neuromagnetic responses was investigated. The pitch specific onset response (POR) was derived by means of magnetoencephalography (MEG). Source analysis revealed the center of this activity in the lateral part of Heschl's Gyrus in the auditory cortex of both hemispheres. The latency of the POR correlated highly with the perceived pitch. When the perceived pitch <b>of</b> <b>RIS</b> decreased, the latency of the POR increased. In a second experiment, the influence of timbre on perception and the POR was investigated. An increase of the perceived pitch resulted in an increase of the POR-latency, when the center frequency of the bandpass filter was increased. These results indicate that the POR integrates both, pitch and timbre and, thus, POR is an objective neurophysiological representation of the perception of a sound. Simulations of pitch processing showed, that temporal pitch models can account for the perceived pitch <b>of</b> <b>RIS</b> but fail to simulate timbre-induced pitch changes.

The objective {{of the study was}} to analyse the in vivo inhibitory potential of two antihypertensive drugs, amlodipine and metoprolol on CYP 2 D 6 catalysed 9 -hydroxylation <b>of</b> risperidone (<b>RIS).</b> METHODS A therapeutic drug monitoring database with plasma concentrations <b>of</b> <b>RIS</b> and 9 -hydroxyrisperidone (9 -OH-RIS) of 1584 patients was analysed. Three groups were considered; a group <b>of</b> patients receiving <b>RIS</b> without a potentially cytochrome influencing co-medication (control group, R 0, n= 852), a group co-medicated with amlodipine (RA, n= 27) and a group, co-medicated with metoprolol (RM, n= 41). Plasma concentrations, concentration-to-dose ratios (C/Ds) <b>of</b> <b>RIS,</b> 9 -OH-RIS and the active moiety (AM), as well as the metabolic ratios were computed and compared using the Kruskal-Wallis test, the Mann-Whitney U test and the Jonckheere-Terpstra test to determine the means and different patterns of distribution of plasma concentrations as well as the concentration-to-dose ratios. RESULTS The median daily dosage <b>of</b> <b>RIS</b> did not differ between the groups (p= 0. 708). No differences were found in median plasma concentrations <b>of</b> <b>RIS,</b> 9 -OH-RIS and AM. However, concentration-to-dose ratios for RIS, 9 -OH-RIS and AM were significantly higher in the amlodipine group (p= 0. 025, p= 0. 048 and p= 0. 005). In the metoprolol group, the concentration-to-dose ratio for RIS was significantly higher than in the control group (p= 0. 017), while the C/D for 9 -OH-RIS and AM was not. CONCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS Our data show a potential pharmacokinetic interaction, most likely via CYP 3 A 4 between amlodipine and RIS, reflected in significantly different C/Ds for RIS, 9 -OH-RIS and AM. Although the interaction did not result in significantly higher plasma levels, changes in C/Ds and their distribution with regard to the median concentrations were observed...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis {{is to determine the}} mechanism <b>of</b> radiation-induced segregation (<b>RIS)</b> in ferritic-martensitic (F-M) alloys. Toward this goal, experimental results were compared to calculations from models <b>of</b> two potential <b>RIS</b> mechanisms: the inverse Kirkendall (IK) mechanism and the solute drag mechanism. Experiment-model comparisons were performed with respect to the dependence <b>of</b> <b>RIS</b> on the experimental parameters of temperature, nominal Cr concentration, and dose. Irradiation experiments were carried out with 2. 0 MeV protons over a variety of experimental conditions. The temperature dependence <b>of</b> <b>RIS</b> was measured in alloy T 91 at a dose of 3 dpa over a range of irradiation temperatures from 300 Â°C to 700 Â°C. The concentration dependence <b>of</b> <b>RIS</b> was measured in commercial alloys T 91 (~ 9 Cr), HCM 12 A (~ 11 Cr), and HT 9 (~ 12 Cr), as well as in a high-purity Fe- 9 Cr model alloy, at a dose of 3 dpa at 400 Â°C. Lastly, the dose dependence <b>of</b> <b>RIS</b> was measured in both T 91 and the Fe- 9 Cr model alloy at 400 Â°C to doses ranging from 1 dpa to 10 dpa. In all specimens, RIS at grain boundaries was measured using scanning transmission electron microscopy with energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (STEM/EDX). Chromium enrichment at grain boundaries was observed in all but one condition, that being T 91 irradiated to 3 dpa at 700 Â°C. The tendency for Cr to enrich can be explained by differences in solute-defect diffusion rates, or the IK mechanism. The observed crossover between Cr enrichment at 600 Â°C to Cr depletion at 700 Â°C in T 91 irradiated to 3 dpa, can also be explained by the IK mechanism and the competition between Cr enrichment via the interstitial flux and Cr depletion via the vacancy flux. The solute drag mechanism, on the other hand, fails to predict the crossover behavior. The dependence <b>of</b> Cr <b>RIS</b> on nominal Cr concentration demonstrates further consistency between experimental measurements and the IK mechanism, as well as further inconsistency between experiments and the solute drag mechanism. Limited understanding remains regarding the dose evolution <b>of</b> Cr <b>RIS,</b> which is likely influenced by microstructural evolution and minor/impurity element RIS...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Radiation-induced sarcoma (RIS) is a {{well-known}} complication of radiotherapy. It is an aggressive tumour and the prognosis is often poor, despite radical treatment. We aim to investigate the role of surgery in the treatment <b>of</b> patients with <b>RIS</b> <b>of</b> {{the head and neck}} region. Method: We conducted a retrospective review of records of patients whom were treated for radiation-induced sarcoma at Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong, between the period 1999 to 2010. Data collected included patient age, gender, latency period for the development <b>of</b> <b>RIS,</b> site <b>of</b> <b>RIS,</b> symptoms, treatment given, pathology and survival. Results: Nineteen patients were included, (M= 11, F= 8). Eighteen received radiotherapy for treatment of primary nasopharyngeal carcinoma. One received radiotherapy for carcinoma of the parotid. The medial latency period for the development of sarcoma was 11. 1 years (range 5. 3 - 25. 1). The most common site for development <b>of</b> <b>RIS</b> was the neck (n= 8), followed by the oropharynx/oral cavity (n= 4), nasopharynx (n= 3) nasal cavity (n= 2), maxilla (n= 1) and mandible (n= 1). The most common histology was undifferentiated sarcoma (n= 6). Nine patients underwent surgical resection <b>of</b> the <b>RIS</b> with curative intent, three and six patients achieved R 0 and R 1 resection respectively. Chemotherapy was used in eleven instances after surgery. Radiotherapy was used in seven instances, three through brachytherapy, four through external beam irradiation. Overall medial survival from diagnosis <b>of</b> <b>RIS</b> was 1. 74 years (95 % CI 0. 60 - 2. 87), which improves to 2. 47 years (95 % CI 0. 97 - 3. 97) when only calculating those whom surgery was performed. Conclusions: Patients suffering from radiation-induced sarcomas have a poor prognosis, in keeping with existing literature. Treatment is mainly by surgery aiming at resection with a curative intent. If curative resection is impossible, surgery may still have a role in palliating the patientsâ€™ symptoms such as bleeding, fungation, or painpublished_or_final_versio...|$|R
