50|$|The biggest {{advantage}} {{with the}} hose pumps over the roller pumps {{is the high}} operating pressure of up to 16 bar. With rollers max pressure can arrive up to 12 Bar without any problem.

50|$|The minimum {{gap between}} the roller and the housing determines the maximum squeeze applied on the tubing.

40|$|This study {{reports a}} new perfusion-based, micro {{three-dimensional}} (3 -D) cell culture platform for high-throughput cell culture using enabling microfluidic technologies. In this work, the micro 3 -D cell culture platform is fabricated based on SU- 8 lithography and polydimethylsiloxane replication processes. The micro cell culture platform can maintain homogenous and stable culture environments, {{as well as}} provide <b>pumping</b> of multiple <b>mediums</b> and efficient cell/agarose (scaffold) loading functions, which allows realization of more precise and high-throughput cell culture-based assays. In this study, the design of a high-throughput <b>medium</b> <b>pumping</b> mechanism was especially highlighted. A new serpentine-shaped pneumatic micropump was used to provide the required <b>medium</b> <b>pumping</b> mechanism. Pneumatic microchannels with a varied length and U-shape bending corners were designed to connect three rectangular pneumatic chambers such that one can fine-tune the pumping rate of the S-shape micropump by using the fluidic resistance. To achieve a high-throughput <b>medium</b> <b>pumping</b> function, a pneumatic tank was designed to simultaneously activate all of the 30 pneumatic micropumps with a uniform pumping rate. Results show that the pumping rates of the 30 integrated micropumps were statistically uniform with a flow rate ranging from 8. 5 to 185. 1 microl h(- 1), indicating the present multiple <b>medium</b> <b>pumping</b> mechanism is feasible for high-throughput medium delivery purposes. Furthermore, as a demonstration case study, 3 -D culture of oral cancer cell was successfully performed, showing that the cell viability remained as high as 95 % - 98 % during the 48 h cell culture. As the result of miniaturization, this perfusion-based 3 -D cell culture platform not only provides a well-defined and stable culture condition, but also greatly reduces the sample/reagent consumption and the need for human intervention. Moreover, due to the integrated capability for multiple <b>medium</b> <b>pumping,</b> high-throughput research work can be achieved. These traits are found particularly useful for high-precision and high-throughput, 3 -D cell culture-based assay...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn many {{industrial}} processes, {{the use of}} a liquid-gas {{jet pump}} refers to the ejection of the vapor-gas medium, i. e. a medium containing non-condensable and condensable gases in the liquid jet. Conventional calculation methods are used for jet devices that eject non-condensable gases. However, the presence of steam in the medium ejected makes a significant contribution to the operational process and, consequently, its mathematical description and device specifications. The article deals with the development of physical and mathematical models and determination of properties of liquid-gas jet pumps (LGJP) with an ejected vapor-gas medium. While calculating the performance there were used: Bernoulli equation – for spin-up of the active flow in the nozzle device; water balance equation, heat balance, conservation of momentum – for vapor condensation in the suction chamber; momentum equation and isothermal state equation of liquid-gas mixture – for mixture of media in the mixing chamber; liquid-gas mixture flow equation– for transformation of excess kinetic energy into the potential energy in the diffuser. Extremal characteristics that reflected the potential of the LGJP work were calculated {{on the basis of the}} equations. Analysis of specifications was carried out in a non-dimensional coordinates – in terms of the ejection coefficient by dry gas and compression ratio. The calculation of set of extremal characteristics with different ratios of the steam flow to the liquid showed that the presence of steam in the <b>pumped</b> <b>medium</b> degrades performance, i. e. the ejection coefficient is reduced at a constant compression ratio...|$|E

40|$|For {{the study}} of the {{gravitational}} coupling of electromagnetism and the equivalence principle, we have used the spacetime constitutive tensor density {chi}ijkl, and discovered the nonmetric (axion) part (A) {chi}ijkl (equal to {phi}eijkl) of {chi}ijkl worthy investigation. Since we have used Lagrangian formalism, {chi}ijkl is effectively symmetric under the interchange of index pairs, ij and kl, and has 21 independent degrees of freedom. Hehl, Obukhov and Rubilar have started from charge-flux formalism to study electromagnetism, discovered the antisymmetric part (Sk) {chi}ijkl (15 degrees of freedom) of {chi}ijkl under the interchange of index pairs ij and kl worthy investigation, and called it skewon field. In this paper, we study the propagation of the Hehl-Obukhov-Rubilar skewon field in weak gravity field/dilute matter or with weak violation of the Einstein Equivalence Principle (EEP), and further classify it into Type I and Type II skewons. From the dispersion relation we show that no dissipation/no amplification condition implies that the additional skewon field must be of Type II. For Type I skewon field, the dissipation/amplification is proportional to the frequency and the CMB spectrum would deviate from Planck spectrum. From the high precision agreement of the CMB spectrum to 2. 755 K Planck spectrum, we constrain the Type I cosmic skewon field (SkI) {chi}ijkl to less than a few x 10 - 35. The skewon part of constitutive tensor constructed from asymmetric metric is of Type II, hence is allowed.

Relatively low ionization states of low Z elements in the lasing medium are produced by means of an embedded exploding wire (EEW). The EEW source will enable to obtain plasmas having a wide range of densities and relatively low temperatures - thus minimizing both collisional transfer processes and Doppler broadening of the lines of interest.

40|$|Cassie'' {{state of}} wetting can be {{established}} by trapping air pockets on the crevices of textured hydrophobic surfaces, leading to significant drag reduction. However, this drag reduction cannot be sustained due to gradual dissolution of trapped air into water. In this paper, we explore the possibility of sustaining the underwater Cassie state of wetting in a microchannel by controlling the solubility of air in water; the solubility being changed by controlling the local absolute pressure near the surface. We show that using this method, we can in fact make the water locally supersaturated with air thus encouraging the growth of trapped air pockets on the surface. In this case, the water acts as a <b>pumping</b> <b>medium,</b> delivering air to the crevices of the hydrophobic surface in the microchannel, where the presence of air pockets is most beneficial from the drag reduction perspective. In our experiments, the air trapped on a textured surface is visualized using total internal reflection based technique, at different local absolute pressures with the pressure drop (or drag) also being simultaneously measured. We find that, by controlling the pressure and hence the solubility close to the surface, we can either shrink or grow the trapped air bubbles, uniformly over a large surface area. The experiments show that, by precisely controlling the pressure and hence the solubility we can sustain the `'Cassie state'' over extended periods of time. This method thus provides a means of getting sustained drag reduction from a textured hydrophobic surface in channel flows. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
