5|$|The Crédit Mobilier of America scandal {{involved}} {{corruption in}} the financing of the Union Pacific Railroad, part of the transcontinental railroad that was completed in 1869. Union Pacific officers and directors secretly purchased control of the Crédit Mobilier of America company, then contracted with the firm to have it undertake {{the construction of the}} railroad. The grossly inflated invoices submitted by the company were paid by the railroad, using federal funds appropriated to subsidize the project, and the company was allowed to purchase Union Pacific securities at <b>par</b> <b>value,</b> well below the market rate. Crédit Mobilier showed large profits and stock gains, and distributed substantial dividends. The high expenses meant that Congress was called upon to appropriate more funds. One of the railroad officials who controlled Crédit Mobilier was also a congressman, Oakes Ames of Massachusetts. He offered some of his colleagues the opportunity to buy Crédit Mobilier stock at <b>par</b> <b>value,</b> well below what it sold for on the market, and the railroad got its additional appropriations.|$|E

5|$|The Alberta and Great Waterways Railway was one {{of several}} {{companies}} that had been granted charters and assistance by the legislature to build new railways in the province. The government support that it received was more generous than that received by more established railways, such as the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway and the Canadian Northern Railway. Boyle, Cushing, and Bennett alleged favouritism or ineptitude by Rutherford and his government, and pointed to the sale of government-guaranteed bonds in support of the company as further evidence. Because of the high interest rate they paid, the bonds were sold at above <b>par</b> <b>value,</b> but the government only received par for them, leaving the company to pocket the difference.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Little {{is known}} about how population-attributable risks (PAR) for adverse birth {{outcomes}} due to smoking differ in adolescent and adult pregnancies. METHODS: An analysis of community and hospital-based cross-sectional studies in Liverpool was undertaken to estimate the <b>PAR</b> <b>values</b> of low birthweight (LBW), preterm birth, and small for gestational age (SGA) births resulting from pregnancy smoking covering the period between 1983 and 2003. Maternal smoking status and pregnancy outcomes were available for a sample of 12631 women. RESULTS: The prevalence of maternal pregnancy smoking was 40 % in the community sample and 33 % in adults and 40 % among adolescent pregnancies in the hospital sample. The <b>PAR</b> <b>values</b> (95 % CI) associated with LBW, preterm birth and SGA outcomes due to maternal pregnancy smoking in the community sample were 27 % (25 - 30), 13 % (11 - 15) and 25 % (23 - 27), respectively. The <b>PAR</b> <b>values</b> in adults in the hospital sample were 29 % (27 - 31) for LBW, 16 % (14 - 19) for preterm birth and 28 % (26 - 31) for SGA. The corresponding <b>PAR</b> <b>values</b> in adolescents were 39 % (34 - 43), 12 % (7 - 18) and 31 % (23 - 40). The LBW risk attributed to pregnancy smoking in adolescents {{was significantly higher than}} for adults (P= 0. 05). CONCLUSION: About one-third of LBW, one-quarter of SGA and one-sixth of preterm births could be attributed to maternal smoking during pregnancy. The magnitude of the problem was greater among adolescent pregnancies, among whom a sub-group of mothers with very high risk for adverse birth outcomes due to pregnancy smoking was identifie...|$|R
30|$|Considering the PAR {{reduction}} performance, {{it turns}} out that the ccdf of the original signal is not equal to the reference (5) when considering Gaussian signaling. The reason for this behavior is as follows: in the above definition of the feedforward and feedback matrices power loading over the users is included implicitly within each subcarrier. Considering the time-domain signal, i.e., after applying the IDFT, the antenna signals are no longer pairwise statistically independent. Hence, the distribution of <b>PAR</b> <b>values</b> will not exactly match the analytic result from (5) but higher <b>PAR</b> <b>values</b> will occur. Noteworthy, it is possible to overcome this issue by avoiding power loading over the users. In this case, there remains an individual scaling of each user, which can be equalized within the receiver's automatic gain control. However, in this article, we consider sTHP only with power loading over the users in order to have a fair comparison towards LRA-THP, where it is not straightforwardly possible to avoid power loading.|$|R
5|$|Following the Smithsonian Agreement, {{member states}} of the European Economic Community adopted a {{narrower}} currency band of 1.125% for exchange rates among their own currencies, creating a smaller scale fixed exchange rate system known as the snake in the tunnel. The snake proved unsustainable as it did not compel EEC countries to coordinate macroeconomic policies. In 1979, the European Monetary System (EMS) phased out the currency snake. The EMS featured two key components: the European Currency Unit (ECU), an artificial weighted average market basket of European Union members' currencies, and the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM), a procedure for managing exchange rate fluctuations in keeping with a calculated parity grid of currencies' par values. The parity grid was derived from parities each participating country established for its currency with all other currencies in the system, denominated in terms of ECUs. The weights within the ECU changed in response to variances in the values of each currency in its basket. Under the ERM, if an exchange rate reached its upper or lower limit (within a 2.25% band), both nations in that currency pair were obligated to intervene collectively in the foreign exchange market and buy or sell the under- or overvalued currency as necessary to return the exchange rate to its <b>par</b> <b>value</b> according to the parity matrix. The requirement of cooperative market intervention marked a key difference from the Bretton Woods system. Similarly to Bretton Woods however, EMS members could impose capital controls and other monetary policy shifts on countries responsible for exchange rates approaching their bounds, as identified by a divergence indicator which measured deviations from the ECU's value. The central exchange rates of the parity grid could be adjusted in exceptional circumstances, and were modified every eight months on average during the systems' initial four years of operation. During its twenty-year lifespan, these central rates were adjusted over 50 times.|$|E

50|$|The {{length of}} each hole from the tee {{placement}} to the pin mostly determines <b>par</b> <b>values</b> for each hole. Almost invariably, holes are assigned <b>par</b> <b>values</b> {{between three and}} five strokes. For a casual player from the middle tees, a par-three hole will be 100 - 250 yd from the tee to the pin. Par-four holes are 250 - 470 yd, but tournament players will often encounter par-four holes 500 yd or more, as {{it is common for}} short par-five holes for normal play to be turned into par-four holes in championship play. Par-five holes are typically 470 - 600 yd, but in the modern game holes of over 600 yards are becoming more common in championship play. Other relevant factors in setting the par for the hole include the terrain and obstacles (such as trees, water hazards, hills, or buildings) that may require a golfer to take more (or fewer) shots. Some golf courses feature par-sixes and, very rarely, par-sevens, but the latter are not recognised by the United States Golf Association.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{investigations}} {{show that}} the pollen accumulation rate (PAR) of the common tree taxa {{is directly related to}} the biomass and, by inference, to the population size of the taxa around the study site. Fossil PAR records preserved in lakes provide therefore a potential proxy for quantitative biomass and population reconstructions. We use the high-resolution PAR records obtained from two accurately dated lake sediment cores in Finland to generate quantitative Holocene biomass records for Pinus, Picea and Betula, the most common tree taxa of the European Boreal forest. <b>PAR</b> <b>values</b> were calibrated to biomass values by comparing the modern <b>PAR</b> <b>values</b> with the modern biomass values and assuming a linear relationship between the past <b>PAR</b> and biomass <b>values.</b> The obtained <b>PAR</b> and biomass <b>values</b> and trends are remarkably coherent between the two records. Pinus has a stable Holocene biomass size and its modern biomass, about 20 t/ha corresponds with the natural Pinus biomass in the study regions. In contrast, Picea immigrated from the East during the mid Holocene, had a maximum biomass, 50 - 60 t/ha, at 3500 - 1000 cal. yr BP, and declined strongly during the last 1500 - 1000 years as a result of increased human activity and related rise of fire frequency. Thus, the modern Picea biomass in the study regions, about 22 t/ha, is only 35 - 40 % of the natural Picea biomass. The results of this pilot study demonstrate the potential of the calibrated PAR data in quantitative biomass and population reconstructions. Such reconstructions can provide fresh insights into the structure of past plant communities and, when combined with records reflecting palaeoclimates, natural disturbances, and human activity, can help to disentangle the long-term importance of different enviromental drivers to changes in plants populations and ecosystems...|$|R

The effective quantum yield (�F/F �m) showed a diurnal pattern inversely related {{to that of the}} incident downwelling photosynthetically available radiation (PAR), but this pattern was skewed for the shallow colonies such that the values were always lower in the afternoon than during morning hours when measured at similar irradiances. Accordingly, the relative photosynthetic electron transport rate (rETR, ��F/F�m � incident PAR) for those colonies also showed lower values in the afternoons than in the mornings at equal irradiances.

40|$|The {{physical}} activity ratio (<b>PAR)</b> <b>values</b> {{are commonly used}} to convert subjects' {{physical activity}} recalls into estimates of daily energy expenditure (DEE). A PAR {{is defined as the}} ratio between energy expenditure corresponding to a sedentary or a physical activity (kJ/min) and basal metabolic rate [(BMR) kJ/min]. The objective {{of the present study was}} to determine the PAR for different sedentary and physical activities in obese adolescents. Thirty-three obese adolescents [mean body mass index: 35. 1 kg/m 2; 40. 3 % fat mass] aged 11 to 17 yr participated in this study. BMR was assessed by indirect calorimetry after an overnight fast by means of an open-circuit, indirect computerised calorimetry with a rigid, transparent, ventilated canopy. Energy expenditures corresponding to various sedentary and physical activities in free-living conditions were determined using a portable metabolic unit, and body composition by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). The PAR of each activity was obtained by dividing the assessed energy expenditure by BMR. In this study, the PAR of various sedentary and physical activities did not vary significantly with sex, age, and body mass. Thus, the data for boys and girls were combined and the PAR for 27 sedentary and physical activities were determined. The <b>PAR</b> <b>values</b> can be applied to determine the mean DEE (kJ) using the specific equation considering BMR (kJ/min), PAR, and duration (min) of each activity performed by the subject during the 24 h.

An algorithm for estimating instantaneous PAR from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data was developed earlier; however, daily-integrated PAR is more meaningful than instantaneous PAR in many cases because many land surface models require a daily or coarser temporal resolution. This paper compares two different algorithms (adjusted sinusoidal interpolation and look-up table) for estimating daily-integrated PAR from instantaneous <b>PAR</b> <b>values.</b> Statistical analysis of the validation results indicates that the look-up table method more accurately estimates daily-integrated PAR than the use of adjusted sinusoidal interpolation.
