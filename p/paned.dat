5|$|The Grade I mansion's {{principal}} facade {{has been}} substantially remodelled. The house {{is made of}} red brick with ashlar quoining and the principal facade, terminated by symmetrical matching bays, has tall <b>paned</b> windows. The house and detached tower are among the earliest uses of brick as the principal building material for an English house.|$|E
5|$|The five-bay front facade has two flat Doric pilasters and {{two more}} pilasters, located off the central bay support the broken base pediment. The {{original}} door was replaced with a 19th-century door that has a 20-pane fanlight and is flanked by two flat pilasters that support the broken base pediment over the door. The main house originally had two-chimney design and another chimney {{was added to the}} east wall for a 20th-century furnace. Most of the windows in the house were replaced in the 19th century with 2-over-2 sash, except for two attic windows of each end of the gable which retain the smaller <b>paned</b> sashes. The house includes an earlier -story ell in the rear that {{appears to have been a}} two-room central chimney structure that was integrated into the design of the main house and built in the second quarter of the 18th century. The chimney was replaced in the 19th century. A storage shed also sits behind the house. The property also had a dairy barn that was rebuilt following its destruction in the 1938 New England hurricane.|$|E
25|$|In October 1973, I.M. Pei & Partners {{announced}} that all 10,344 window panes would each {{be replaced by}} single <b>paned,</b> heat-treated panels at a total cost between $5 million and $7 million. Approximately 5,000 of the original glass panes were removed intact, and were later reused by artists.|$|E
25|$|The silhouette, {{which was}} {{essentially}} {{close to the}} body with tight sleeves and a low, pointed waist to around 1615, gradually softened and broadened. Sleeves became very full, and in the 1620s and 1630s were often <b>paned</b> or slashed to show the voluminous sleeves of the shirt or chemise beneath.|$|E
25|$|During the mid 17th century, {{the older}} doublets, ruffs, <b>paned</b> hose, and jerkins were {{replaced}} by the precursor to the three piece suit comprising waistcoat, tight breeches, powdered wig, tricorne hat, and a long coat called a justacorps. This coat, popularised by Louis XIII of France and Charles II of England, was knee length and looser fitting than the later frock coat, with turn-back cuffs and two rows of buttons. English and French noblemen often wore expensive brocade coats decorated with velvet, gold braid, embroidery, and gold buttons to demonstrate their wealth.|$|E
25|$|The Traub Brothers Jewelry Building is a four-story wood-frame brick building, {{built in}} 1879. Presumably {{the first floor}} was used as retail while the upper floors were used as {{residential}} space. The building was purchased by Grand Trunk Railroad early in the 20th century, and in 1911 it was renovated to serve as their ticketing office. Grand Trunk removed the second floor and installed a vaulted ceiling reminiscent of period railroad stations. The renovation added a rounded arch on the second floor, filled with <b>paned</b> windows and surrounded by terra cotta detailing with the company's logo. The finely detailed interior woodwork also includes company logos. Although the lower floors of the building were completely altered during this renovation, the upper two floors still retain the original window shapes.|$|E

Erasmus Darwin's study in his original house survives at , [...] and is recognisable as the site of the painting. The eight <b>paned</b> window is unchanged; the door position remains as depicted in the painting, though the architrave is missing. A full moon can be seen from this room at the same bearing and inclination as in the painting, just after midnight when the moon is full. Darwin's [...] "philosophical feasts" [...] that started with the afternoon meal often carried on throughout the night.|$|E

Large, six over six <b>paned</b> windows {{are located in the}} front and the back of the building on both floors. Similar windows are also located {{on the south side of}} the building, but only on the top floor. There are no windows located on the north side. The entire exterior of the {{building is}} constructed from brick. The roof is flat and constructed of roofing cement, with a parapet located around it, with a section of a chimney that sticks out of the south end of the roof. The most prominent feature of the exterior of the building is the large, central pavilion, with a stepped gable parapet wall.|$|E

60|$|The stranger's dress was, though grave, rather {{richer than}} usual. His <b>paned</b> hose were of black velvet, lined with purple silk, which {{garniture}} {{appeared at the}} slashes. His doublet was of purple cloth, and his short cloak of black velvet, to correspond with his hose; and both were adorned with {{a great number of}} small silver buttons richly wrought in filigree. A triple chain of gold hung round his neck; and, in place of a sword or dagger, he wore at his belt an ordinary knife for the purpose of the table, with a small silver case, which appeared to contain writing materials. He might have seemed some secretary or clerk engaged {{in the service of the}} public, only that his low, flat, and unadorned cap, and his well-blacked, shining shoes, indicated that he belonged to the city. He was a well-made man, about the middle size, and seemed in firm health, though advanced in years. His looks expressed sagacity and good-humour: and the air of respectability which his dress announced, was well supported by his clear eye, ruddy cheek, and grey hair. He used the Scottish idiom in his first address, but in such a manner that it could hardly be distinguished whether he was passing upon his friend a sort of jocose mockery, or whether it was his own native dialect, for his ordinary discourse had little provincialism.|$|E
6000|$|He {{came into}} Midhurst by the bridge at the watermill, {{and up the}} North Street, and a little shop flourishing cheerfully, the cheerful sign of a teapot, and exhibiting a {{brilliant}} array of tobaccos, sweets, and children's toys in the window, struck his fancy. A neat, bright-eyed little old lady made him welcome, and he was presently supping sumptuously on sausages and tea, with a visitors' book full of the most humorous and flattering remarks about the little old lady, in verse and prose, propped up against his teapot as he ate. Regular good some of the jokes were, and rhymes that read well--even with your mouth full of sausage. Mr. Hoopdriver formed a vague idea of drawing [...] "something"--for his judgment on the little old lady was already formed. He pictured the little old lady discovering it afterwards--"My gracious! One of them Punch men," [...] she would say. The room had a curtained recess and a chest of drawers, for presently {{it was to be}} his bedroom, and the day part of it was decorated with framed Oddfellows' certificates and giltbacked books and portraits, and kettle-holders, and all kinds of beautiful things made out of wool; very comfortable it was indeed. The window was lead framed and diamond <b>paned,</b> and through it one saw the corner of the vicarage and a pleasant hill crest, in dusky silhouette against the twilight sky. And after the sausages had ceased to be, he lit a Red Herring cigarette and went swaggering out into the twilight street. All shadowy blue between its dark brick houses, was the street, with a bright yellow window here and there and splashes of green and red where the chemist's illumination fell across the road.|$|E

This comprises a central recessed section containing the entrance stair and landings, with projecting wings, stepped in plan, to both sides.
