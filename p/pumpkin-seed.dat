40|$|The {{objective}} {{of our research}} {{was to determine the}} effects of five different diets as a source of various groups of fatty acids on mice adipose tissue lipid content, phospholipid composition and fatty acid composition of adipose tissue total lipids and phospholipids. Beside the standard diet, diets enriched either with <b>pumpkin-seed,</b> olive or fish oil or lard were used for feeding wild type C 57 Bl/ 6 male mice aged 8 - 10 weeks for 3 weeks. In mice fed with diets enriched with oils/lard, relative adipose tissue mass decreased, comparing to standard diet fed mice. Adipose tissue total lipid content decreased significantly in olive and fish oil diet comparing to <b>pumpkin-seed</b> oil and standard diet. Analysis of the phospholipid classes showed that phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine and sphingomyelin were common components in all diet types. The dominant storage form of fatty acids in adipose tissue total lipids were unsaturated fatty acids (oleic and linoleic acid prevailed), while in phospholipids, C 18 acids prevailed (stearic acid was the main fatty acid) in all diets. Enrichment of the diet with specific oil or lard significantly changed the n- 6 /n- 3 ratio. Fish oil diet provoked the highest reduction of that ratio, both in adipose tissue total lipids and in phospholipids. Obtained results imply that diet modification has an influence on adipose tissue lipid content and composition as well as remodelling process occurring in the adipose tissue phospholipids...|$|E
40|$|The {{investigation}} of structure and condition of ichthyofauna was performed {{during the period}} May 2000 — October 2001 on several locations of Nature park »Lonjsko polje«. Samples were caught by electrofishing. The majority of caught specimens, of both locations, belong 70 % of the carp family (Cyprinidae). The values of the CF range from minimal 0. 53 ± 0. 06 for the pike (Esox lucius) to maximum 2. 26 ± 0. 23 for the <b>Pumpkin–seed</b> Sunfish (Lepomis gibbosus). The values of the exponent b in the weight–length relationship W = a Lb range from 1. 9709 for the Zope (Abramis ballerus) to 4. 1979 for the American Catfish (Ictalurus nebulosus). The results indicate positive allometric growth of almost all fish populations of investigated locations {{and the lack of}} rational sport fishery management of these locations...|$|E
40|$|The {{functional}} {{basis of}} learning in prey capture was investigated in the <b>pumpkin-seed</b> sunfish (Lepomis gibbosus). Feeding performance of sunfishes was assessed when the fish were first fed a novel, elusive prey (guppies) and compared with their performance after several weeks of experience with capturing guppies. During these feedings electromyographic recordings were made to document the pattern of activity in four jaw muscles at the strike. With experience, the L. gibbosus improved their ability to capture guppies, and several changes {{in the pattern of}} muscle activity were associated with this improved performance. Average duration and maximum amplitude of activity in all muscles increased between trials. Previous studies of muscle activity modulation in fishes indicate that these changes could improve feeding performance on an elusive prey. Thus, specific modifications of muscle activity appear to be one functional determinant of feeding success in fishes...|$|E

60|$|Jack Pumpkinhead arrived, {{wearing a}} pair of new white kid gloves; and he brought a {{birthday}} present for Ozma consisting of a necklace of <b>pumpkin-seeds.</b> In each seed was set a sparkling carolite, which is considered the rarest and most beautiful gem that exists. The necklace was in a plush case and Jellia Jamb put it on a table with the Princess Ozma's other presents.|$|R

I'll follow you to the Emerald City to-morrow, where we shall meet again. I can't go to-day, because I have to plant fresh <b>pumpkin-seeds</b> and water the young vines. But give my love to Ozma, and tell her I'll be there {{in time for the}} jubilation." ...|$|R
60|$|In {{the wide}} {{thoroughfare}} {{leading from the}} last bridge of the Riva to {{the gate of the}} gardens there is always a clapping of wooden shoes on the stones, a braying of hand-organs, a shrieking of people who sell fish and fruit, at once insufferable and indescribable. The street is a rio terrà,--a filled-up canal,--and, as always happens with rii terrai, is abandoned to the poorest classes who manifest themselves, as the poorest classes are apt to do always, in groups of frowzy women, small girls carrying large babies, beggars, of course, and soldiers. I spoke of fruit-sellers; but in this quarter the traffic in <b>pumpkin-seeds</b> is the most popular,--the people finding these an inexpensive and pleasant excess, when taken with a glass of water flavored with anise.|$|R
60|$|Worthy Sir: In a {{preceding}} communication, I {{have given}} you some brief notice of Wolfert's Roost, the mansion where I first {{had the good fortune}} to become acquainted with the venerable historian of the New Netherlands. As this ancient edifice is likely to be the place whence I shall date many of my lucubrations, and as it is really a very remarkable little pile, intimately connected with all the great epochs of our local and national history, I have thought it but right to give some farther particulars concerning it. Fortunately, in rummaging a ponderous Dutch chest of drawers, which serves as the archives of the Roost, and in which are preserved many inedited manuscripts of Mr. KNICKERBOCKER, together with the precious records of New-Amsterdam, brought hither by Wolfert Acker at the downfall of the Dutch dynasty, as has been already mentioned, I found in one corner, among dried <b>pumpkin-seeds,</b> bunches of thyme, and pennyroyal, and crumbs of new-year cakes, a manuscript, carefully wrapped up in the fragment of an old parchment deed, but much blotted, and the ink grown foxy by time, which, on inspection, I discovered to be a faithful chronicle of the Roost. The hand-writing, and certain internal evidences, leave no doubt in my mind, that it is a genuine production of the venerable historian of the New-Netherlands, written, very probably, during his residence at the Roost, in gratitude for the hospitality of its proprietor. As such, I submit it for publication. As the entire chronicle is too long for the pages of your Magazine, and as it contains many minute particulars, which might prove tedious to the general reader, I have abbreviated and occasionally omitted some of its details; but may hereafter furnish them separately, should they seem to be required by the curiosity of an enlightened and document-hunting public. Respectfully yours, GEOFFREY CRAYON.|$|R
