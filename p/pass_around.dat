5|$|The Stanley Cup {{championship}} team is allotted 100 days during off-season to <b>pass</b> <b>around</b> the Cup including the team's parade, days with sponsors {{and a day}} or so with each player and member of the team's staff. It is always accompanied by at least one representative from the Hockey Hall of Fame. Although many players have unofficially spent a day in personal possession of the Cup, in 1994 the New York Rangers started a tradition wherein each member of the Cup-winning team is allowed to retain the Cup for a day. Victors of the Cup have used it to baptize their children. Three players (the New York Islanders' Clark Gillies, the Anaheim Ducks' Sean O'Donnell, and the Pittsburgh Penguins' Nick Bonino) even allowed their dogs to eat out of the Cup.|$|E

25|$|The {{ring was}} a {{descendant}} of the Arkwright water Frame 1769. It was a continuous process, the yarn was coarser, had a greater twist and was stronger so was suited to be warp.

25|$|This {{may occur}} {{when there is}} a large mass of feces in the rectum (fecal loading), which may become {{hardened}} (fecal impaction). Liquid stool elements are able to <b>pass</b> <b>around</b> the obstruction, leading to incontinence. Megarectum (enlarged rectal volume) and rectal hyposensitivity are associated with overflow incontinence. Hospitalized patients and care home residents may develop FI via this mechanism, possibly a result of lack of mobility, reduced alertness, constipating effect of medication and/or dehydration.|$|E
25|$|The {{displacer}} is a special-purpose piston, used in Beta and Gamma type Stirling engines, to {{move the}} working gas {{back and forth between}} the hot and cold heat exchangers. Depending on the type of engine design, the displacer may or may not be sealed to the cylinder, i.e. it may be a loose fit within the cylinder, allowing the working gas to <b>pass</b> <b>around</b> it as it moves to occupy the part of the cylinder beyond.|$|E
25|$|Another type of pass is the bounce pass. Here, the passer bounces {{the ball}} crisply {{about two-thirds of}} the way from his own chest to the receiver. The ball strikes the court and bounces up toward the receiver. The bounce pass takes longer to {{complete}} than the chest pass, but it is also harder for the opposing team to intercept (kicking the ball deliberately is a violation). Thus, players often use the bounce pass in crowded moments, or to <b>pass</b> <b>around</b> a defender.|$|E

25|$|The Tabriz loom, {{named after}} the city of Tabriz, is used in Northwestern Iran. The warps are {{continuous}} and <b>pass</b> <b>around</b> behind the loom. Warp tension is obtained with wedges. The weavers sit on a fixed seat and when {{a portion of the}} carpet has been completed, the tension is released and the carpet is pulled down and rolled {{around the back of the}} loom. This process continues until the rug is completed, when the warps are severed and the carpet is taken off the loom.|$|E
25|$|Mystery guests {{would usually}} {{attempt to conceal}} their identities with {{disguised}} voices, much to the amusement of the studio audience. According to Cerf, the panel could often determine {{the identities of the}} mystery guests early, as they knew which celebrities were in town, or which major movies or plays were about to open. On those occasions, to provide the audience an opportunity to see the guest play the game, the cast would typically allow questioning to <b>pass</b> <b>around</b> at least once before coming up with the correct guess.|$|E
25|$|Pacific salmon are anadromous; they hatch in lakes, rivers, and streams—or, {{nowadays}} fish hatcheries—migrate to sea, {{and only}} {{at the end of their}} life return to fresh water to spawn. When the Corps of Engineers first built the locks and dam, they changed the natural drainage route of Lake Washington. The locks and dam blocked all salmon runs out of the Cedar River watershed. To correct this problem, the Corps built a fish ladder as the locks were constructed to allow salmon to <b>pass</b> <b>around</b> the locks and dam.|$|E

25|$|Private {{vehicles}} and taxis are the predominant {{means of transport}} in Palm Beach. Bicycles are a popular transport on the island, although most areas have no bicycle trails, so safe and comfortable travel is not always assured. The Lake Trail, exclusively for pedestrian and bike traffic, extends from Royal Palm Way (State Road 704) in the south up to {{the north end of}} the island. The trail follows the edge of the Lake Worth Lagoon (part of the intercoastal waterway) except for a section between the Flagler Museum and the Biltmore Condominiums, where the trail follows the streets. Another break occurs to <b>pass</b> <b>around</b> the Sailfish Yacht Club in {{the north end of the}} island. The Lake Trail is filled daily with bikers, rollerbladers, runners, and dog-walkers.|$|E
25|$|The broken toes {{were held}} tightly against {{the sole of}} the foot while the foot was then drawn down {{straight}} with the leg and the arch of the foot was forcibly broken. The bandages were repeatedly wound in a figure-eight movement, starting at the inside of the foot at the instep, then carried over the toes, under the foot, and around the heel, the freshly broken toes being pressed tightly into the {{sole of the foot}}. At each <b>pass</b> <b>around</b> the foot, the binding cloth was tightened, pulling the ball of the foot and the heel together, causing the broken foot to fold at the arch, and pressing the toes underneath the sole. The binding was pulled so tightly that the girl could not move her toes at all and the ends of the binding cloth were then sewn so that the girl could not loosen it.|$|E
25|$|In {{the strictest}} sense, English folk music has existed since {{the arrival of}} the Anglo-Saxon people in Britain after 400 CE. The Venerable Bede's story of the {{cattleman}} and later ecclesiastical musician Cædmon indicates that in the early medieval period it was normal at feasts to <b>pass</b> <b>around</b> the harp and sing 'vain and idle songs'. Since this type of music was rarely notated, we have little knowledge of its form or content. Some later tunes, like those used for Morris dance, may have their origins in this period, but it is impossible to be certain of these relationships. We know from a reference in William Langland's Piers Plowman, that ballads about Robin Hood were being sung from at least by the late 14th century and the oldest detailed material we have is Wynkyn de Worde's collection of Robin Hood ballads printed about 1495.|$|E

25|$|The role of {{re-entry}} or circus {{motion was}} demonstrated separately by Mines and Garrey. Mines created {{a ring of}} excitable tissue by cutting the atria out of the ray fish. Garrey cut out a similar ring from the turtle ventricle. They were both able to show that, if a ring of excitable tissue was stimulated at a single point, the subsequent waves of depolarisation would <b>pass</b> <b>around</b> the ring. The waves eventually meet and cancel each other out, but, if an area of transient block occurred with a refractory period that blocked one wavefront and subsequently allowed the other to proceed retrogradely over the other path, then a self-sustaining circus movement phenomenon would result. For this to happen, however, {{it is necessary that}} there be some form of non-uniformity. In practice, this may be an area of ischemic or infarcted myocardium, or underlying scar tissue.|$|E
25|$|A {{scoreless}} {{first quarter}} {{ended with the}} Patriots driving to the Jets' 3-yard line. The second quarter began with a touchdown pass from Tom Brady to Wes Welker. The Jets answered with a drive to New England's 31-yard line, where a disastrous sequence of plays began. On a 4th down with inches to go, Jets running back Shonn Greene rushed up the middle and was tackled short of the first-down marker by Patriots linebacker Brandon Spikes, who forced a fumble by knocking {{the ball out of}} Greene's hands. The ball was recovered by Patriots safety Steve Gregory at the Patriots' 17-yard line, for a loss of 14 yards. The Patriots scored on the next play, as running back Shane Vereen ran a wheel route out of the backfield to the left, beating Jets linebacker Bart Scott in man-to-man coverage. Scott was lined up too far inside, and a screen from Welker prevented Scott from reaching Vereen. Vereen caught Brady's <b>pass</b> <b>around</b> the Patriots' 25-yard line, and Vereen sprinted down the sideline for an 83-yard touchdown.|$|E
25|$|The 52nd Light Infantry {{was based}} in Oxford, England, when it became the 2nd Battalion. This was the 52nd of Waterloo fame who, {{under the command of}} Colonel Sir John Colborne, broke a {{battalion}} of the Chasseurs of the Imperial Guard. In 1884 it arrived in Gibraltar and the following year the battalion took part in active service {{for the first time as}} a 2nd battalion when a detachment under the command of Lieutenant Scott was deployed as mounted infantry in the Nile Expedition. In 1886 it {{was based in}} India, where it would remain into the 20th century. During its stay the battalion formed part of the Peshawar column in the Tirah Expedition in the volatile North-West Frontier in 1897; where the battalion saw action in the Khyber <b>Pass,</b> <b>around</b> Koda Khel and Ali Masjid. In 1903 the battalion returned home and was initially based in Chatham and in 1907 moved to Tidworth, Wiltshire. The battalion was stationed at Albuhera barracks, Aldershot, when World War I commenced.|$|E
