40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the basics of}} a new paradigm that allows generators and consumers of global contextual information to determine an appropriate security level needed for contextual information. Security levels have a direct correlation with confidence in the integrity of contextual data and thus their processing. The new approach {{is based on the}} concept of branes, which can be used to map different security levels of a collection of data points in some space. It turns out that different branes offer different classification capabilities and computational challenges. The data are described according to their information context and to their security requirements. Because the internet inherently does not have good security, the creation of this model has necessitated the development of new methods for securing contextual information as it migrates around the web.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} implementation of XenSocket, a UNIX-domain-socket-like construct for high-throughput interdomain (VM-to-VM) communication on the same system. The design of XenSocket replaces the Xen page-flipping mechanism with a static circular memory buffer shared between two domains, wherein information is written by one domain and read asynchronously by the other domain. XenSocket draws on best-practice work in this field and avoids incurring the overhead of multiple hypercalls and memory page table updates by aggregating what were previously multiple operations on multiple network packets into one or more large operations on the shared buffer. While the reference implementation (and name) of XenSocket is written against the Xen virtual machine monitor, the principle behind XenSocket applies broadly across the field of virtual machines.

40|$|Coordinated and {{targeted}} cyber-attacks to Critical Infrastructures (CIs) {{are becoming more}} and more frequent and sophisticated. This is due to: i) the recent technology shift towards Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) products, and ii) new economical and socio-political motivations. In this paper, we discuss some of the most relevant security issues resulting from the adoption in CIs of heterogeneous network infrastructures (specifically combining wireless and IP trunks), and suggest techniques to detect, as well as to counter/mitigate attacks. We claim that techniques such as those we propose here should be integrated in future SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) solutions, and we discuss how we have done so in the EC-funded MASSIF project, with respect to a real-world CI scenario, specifically a distributed system for power grid monitoring.

40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} a new paradigm for global computation, {{one in which the}} context of collected information drives the type of processing and dissemination the information receives as it is dispersed around the world. The creation of this model has necessitated the development of new types of methods for securing contextual information because the internet itself inherently has not have security mechanisms. Security is typically localized at the nodes on the internet that process information. There are multiple models and methods that are under development to provide security for contexts. This paper presents the basics of a model that allows context consumers to determine the level of security contextual information should have. Security levels have a direct correlation with confidence in the integrity of contextual data and thus application of its processing.

It was found that of the central banks for which information was available, {{all of them have}} expressed interest in DLT and have evaluated it to some extent. Nevertheless, no central bank has an operational DLT-based system at this point. This is because some issues remain regarding the speed, cost of <b>processing,</b> <b>security,</b> transparency and privacy, legal settlement finality, scalability and network effects of the technology.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a novel re-keying function protocol (NRFP) for {{wireless sensor network}} security. A re-keying process management system for sensor networks is designed to support in-network processing. The design of the protocol is motivated by decentralization key management for wireless sensor networks (WSNs), covering key deployment, key refreshment, and key establishment. NRFP supports the establishment of novel administrative functions for sensor nodes that derive/re-derive a session key for each communication session. The protocol proposes direct connection, in-direct connection and hybrid connection. NRFP also includes an efficient protocol for local broadcast authentication based {{on the use of}} one-way key chains. A salient feature of the authentication protocol is that it supports source authentication without precluding in-network <b>processing.</b> <b>Security</b> and performance analysis shows that it is very efficient in computation, communication and storage and, that NRFP is also effective in defending against many sophisticated attacks...|$|E
40|$|Optical {{computing}} {{is needed}} to support Tb/s in-network processing {{in a way that}} unifies communication and computation using a single data representation that supports in-transit network packet <b>processing,</b> <b>security,</b> and big data filtering. Support for optical computation of this sort requires leveraging the native properties of optical wave mixing to enable computation and switching for programmability. As a consequence, data must be encoded digitally as phase (M-PSK), semantics-preserving regeneration is the key to high-order computation, and data processing at Tb/s rates requires mixing. Experiments have demonstrated viable approaches to phase squeezing and power restoration. This work led our team to develop the first serial, optical Internet hop-count decrement, and to design and simulate optical circuits for calculating the Internet checksum and multiplexing Internet packets. The current exploration focuses on limited-lookback computational models to reduce the need for permanent storage and hybrid nanophotonic circuits that combine phase-aligned comb sources, non-linear mixing, and switching on the same substrate to avoid the macroscopic effects that hamper benchtop prototypes...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a novel topology of isotropically radiating “smart cubes ” {{for use in}} wireless sensors. The novelty of this antenna {{is the use of}} 3 D frequency selective surfaces which are used both for creating the desired radiation pattern and for creating a core which is electrically isolated from the antenna at the frequency of operation. The core allows for an embedded power source, processor, amplifier, and/or secondary antenna without interfering with the operation of the radiator. As demand for wireless sensors continues to grow, this device will allow for the implementation of sensors in a wider range of applications including autonomous “smart skins”, biosensing, and RFID-enabled sensors. The prototype is printed on glossy paper using a conductive ink, which gives it the potential for low cost production, allowing it to be used in a variety of applications requiring large numbers of sensing nodes, while meeting enhanced data <b>processing,</b> <b>security</b> or autonomy requirements.
