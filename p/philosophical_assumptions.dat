In relation to the Judeo-Christian tradition, Næss offers the following criticism: [...] "The arrogance of stewardship [...] consists in the idea of superiority which underlies the thought that we exist to watch over nature like a highly respected middleman between the Creator and Creation." [...] This theme had been expounded in Lynn Townsend White, Jr.'s 1967 article [...] "The Historical Roots of Our Ecological Crisis", in which however he also offered as an alternative Christian view of man's relation to nature that of Saint Francis of Assisi, who he says spoke for the equality of all creatures, in place of the idea of man's domination over creation. Næss' further criticizes the reformation's view of creation as property to be put into maximum productive use: a view used frequently in the past to exploit and dispossess native populations. [...] Many Protestant sects today regard the Bible's call for man to have stewardship of the earth as a call for the care for creation, rather than for exploitation.|$|E
2500|$|Deep ecology's core {{principle}} {{is the belief}} that the living environment as a whole should be respected and regarded as having certain inalienable legal rights to live and flourish, independent of its utilitarian instrumental benefits for human use. Deep ecology is often framed in terms of the idea of a much broader sociality; it recognizes diverse communities of life on Earth that are composed not only through biotic factors but also, where applicable, through ethical relations, that is, the valuing of other beings as more than just resources. It describes itself as [...] "deep" [...] because it regards itself as looking more deeply into the actual reality of humanity's relationship with the natural world arriving at philosophically more profound conclusions than that of the prevailing view of ecology as a branch of biology. The movement does not subscribe to anthropocentric environmentalism (which is concerned with conservation of the environment only for exploitation by and for human purposes) since deep ecology is grounded in a quite different set of <b>philosophical</b> <b>assumptions.</b> Deep ecology takes a more holistic view of the world human beings live in and seeks to apply to life the understanding that the separate parts of the ecosystem (including humans) function as a whole. This philosophy provides a foundation for the environmental, ecology, and green movements and has fostered a new system of environmental ethics advocating wilderness preservation, human population control, and simple living.|$|E
2500|$|While not metaphysical naturalism per se, in {{the more}} general sense of naturalism and {{philosophy}} expressed by Kate and Vitaly (2000) [...] "there are certain <b>philosophical</b> <b>assumptions</b> made {{at the base of}} the scientific method - namely, that reality is objective and consistent, that humans have the capacity to perceive reality accurately, and that rational explanations exist for elements of the real world. These assumptions are the basis of naturalism, the philosophy on which science is grounded." [...] As noted by Steven Schafersman, methodological naturalism is [...] "the adoption or assumption of philosophical naturalism within scientific method with or without fully accepting or believing it ... science is not metaphysical and does not depend on the ultimate truth of any metaphysics for its success (although science does have metaphysical implications), but methodological naturalism must be adopted as a strategy or working hypothesis for science to succeed. We may therefore be agnostic about the ultimate truth of naturalism, but must nevertheless adopt it and investigate nature as if nature is all that there is." [...] Contrary to other notable opponents of teaching Creationism or Intelligent Design in US public schools such as Eugenie Scott, Schafersman asserts that [...] "while science as a process only requires methodological naturalism, I think that the assumption of methodological naturalism by scientists and others logically and morally entails ontological naturalism." [...] as well as the similarly controversial assertion: [...] "I maintain that the practice or adoption of methodological naturalism entails a logical and moral belief in ontological naturalism, so they are not logically decoupled."

2500|$|However, {{there are}} other controversies, Arthur Newell Strahler embeds {{peculiar}} anthropic distinctions {{in the name of}} naturalism: [...] "The naturalistic view is that the particular universe we observe came into existence and has operated through all time and in all its parts without the impetus or guidance of any supernatural agency. The naturalistic view is espoused by science as its fundamental assumption." [...] Variously known as background independence, the cosmological principle, the principle of universality, the principle of uniformity, or uniformitarianism, there are important <b>philosophical</b> <b>assumptions</b> that cannot be derived from nature. As noted by Stephen Jay Gould: [...] "You cannot go to a rocky outcrop and observe either the constancy of nature's laws or the working of unknown processes. [...] It works the other way around." [...] You first assume these propositions and [...] "then you go to the out crop of rock." [...] "The assumption of spatial and temporal invariance of natural laws is by no means unique to geology since it amounts to a warrant for inductive inference which, as Bacon showed nearly four hundred years ago, is the basic mode of reasoning in empirical science. Without assuming this spatial and temporal invariance, we have no basis for extrapolating from the known to the unknown and, therefore, no way of reaching general conclusions from a finite number of observations. (Since the assumption is itself vindicated by induction, it can in no way [...] "prove" [...] the validity of induction - an endeavor virtually abandoned after Hume demonstrated its futility two centuries ago)." [...] Gould also notes that natural processes such as Lyell's [...] "uniformity of process" [...] are an assumption: [...] "As such, it is another a priori assumption shared by all scientists and not a statement about the empirical world." [...] Such assumptions across time and space are needed for scientists to extrapolate into the unobservable past, according to G.G. Simpson: [...] "Uniformity is an unprovable postulate justified, or indeed required, on two grounds. First, nothing in our incomplete but extensive knowledge of history disagrees with it. Second, only with this postulate is a rational interpretation of history possible, and we are justified in seeking—as scientists we must seek—such a rational interpretation." [...] and according to R. Hooykaas: [...] "The principle of uniformity is not a law, not a rule established after comparison of facts, but a principle, preceding the observation of facts [...] [...] [...] It is the logical principle of parsimony of causes and of economy of scientific notions. By explaining past changes by analogy with present phenomena, a limit is set to conjecture, for {{there is only one way}} in which two things are equal, but there are an infinity of ways in which they could be supposed different." ...|$|E

The challenges of sustainability and competitive advantage could also be attributed to organisations’ reliance on technology which has increased significantly in recent years.

30|$|According to this <b>philosophical</b> <b>assumption,</b> {{there is}} no unique “real world” that preexists {{independently}} of human mental activity and symbolic language. The world {{is a product of}} socially and historically related interchanges amongst people (social construction). The access to reality is given through social constructions, such as language and shared meanings: “The meaning-making activities themselves are of central interest to social constructionists/constructivists, simply because it is the meaning-making/sense making attributional activities that shape action or (inaction)” (Guba and Lincoln 2005 : 197). Therefore, the researcher is not looking for objective “facts”, nor does he aim at identifying and measuring patterns which can be generalized. Contrarily, the constructivist is researching into specific actions, in specific places, at specific times. The scientist tries to understand the construction and the sharing of meaning (Schwandt 1994).|$|R

These authors aim to understand life as a coherent critical structure, and propose to develop an extended physical approach of evolution, as a diffusion of biomass in a space of complexity. Their attempt leads to a simple mathematical reconstruction of Gould's assumption (1989) concerning the bacterial world as a "left wall of least complexity" that we will examine. Extended physical systems are characterized by their constructive properties. Time is acting and new properties emerge by their history that can open the list of their initial properties.

40|$|Assuming the {{universe}} is spatially homogeneous on the largest scales lays the foundation for almost all cosmology. This idea {{is based on the}} Copernican principle, that we are not at a particularly special place in {{the universe}}. Surprisingly, this <b>philosophical</b> <b>assumption</b> has yet to be rigorously demonstrated independently of the standard paradigm. This issue has been brought to light by cosmological models which can potentially explain apparent acceleration by spatial inhomogeneity rather than dark energy. These models replace the temporal fine tuning associated with Lambda with a spatial fine tuning, and so violate the Copernican assumption. While is seems unlikely that such models can really give a realistic solution to the dark energy problem, they do reveal how poorly constrained radial inhomogeneity actually is. So the bigger issue remains: How do we robustly test the Copernican principle independently of dark energy or theory of gravity?Comment: 40 pages, 15 figures.

40|$|ABSTRACT. In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the class of truth-functional modal many-valued logics with the complete lattice of truth-values. The conjunction and disjunction logic operators correspond to the meet and join operators of the lattices, while the negation is independently introduced as a hierarchy of antitonic operators which invert bottom and top elements. The non-constructive logic implication will be defined for a subclass of modular lattices, while the constructive im-plication for distributive lattices (Heyting algebras) is based on relative pseudo-complements as in intuitionistic logic. We show that the complete lattices are intrinsically modal, with banal identity modal operator. We define the autoreferential set-based representation for the class of modal algebras, and show that the autoreferential Kripke-style semantics for this class of modal algebras {{is based on the}} set of possible worlds equal to the complete lattice of algebraic truth-values. The <b>philosophical</b> <b>assumption</b> is based on the consideration that each possible world represents a level of credibility, so that only propositions with the right logic value (i. e., level of credibility) can be accepted by this world, then we connect it with paraconsistent prop-erties and LFI logics.
