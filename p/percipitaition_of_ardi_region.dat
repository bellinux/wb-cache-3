5000|$|The article author, Yohannes Haile-Selassie, {{suggests}} that A. deyiremeda [...] was most probably {{a descendant of}} A. afarensis (Lucy's species) and possibly ancestral to a subsequent clade including genus Homo (the human genus) and Paranthropus (often termed [...] "robust australopithecines"). Yohannes, {{who is also the}} curator of physical anthropology at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History and who discovered the fossil hand <b>of</b> <b>Ardi,</b> wrote: [...] "The Woranso-Mille study area has thus far yielded more than 120 early hominin fossil specimens dated to between 3.8 and 3.4 million years ago." [...] John D. Hawks at the University of Wisconsin-Madison stated to New Scientist, [...] "If Haile-Selassie is right, I think it's only reasonable to conclude that some unknown number of Australopithecus afarensis skeletal remains actually belong to this new species instead. This means that everything that has been written about variation, function and the anatomy of Australopithecus afarensis from fragmentary remains must now be in doubt." ...|$|R
5000|$|Ardi weighed about 50 kg (110 lb) {{and could}} be up to 121.92 cm (4 ft) tall. Although she is a biped, Ardi had both opposable big toes and thumbs in order to climb trees. It is speculated that her bipedality impeded movement, but enabled her to bear more offspring. [...] Although {{it is not known}} whether Ardi's species {{developed}} into Homo sapiens, the discovery is of great significance and added much to the debate on Ardipithecus and its place in human evolution. With regards to Ardi's body composition, archaeologists note that she is unique in that she possesses traits that are characteristic of both extinct primates and early hominids. [...] It is still a point <b>of</b> debate whether <b>Ardi</b> was capable <b>of</b> bipedal movement. <b>Ardi's</b> divergent big toes are not characteristic of a biped. [...] However, the found remains of her legs, feet, pelvis, and hands suggested that she walked upright when on the ground but was a quadruped when moving around trees. Her big toe, for example, spreads out quite a bit from her foot to better grasp tree limbs. Unlike chimpanzees, however, her foot contains a unique small bone inside a tendon which kept the big toe stronger. When seen along with Ardi's other bone structures, this unique bone would have helped her walked bipedally, though less efficient than Lucy. [...] Her wrist bones also provided her with flexibility but the palm bones were short. This suggests that Ardi did not walk on her knuckles and only used her palms to move along tree branches.Some <b>of</b> <b>Ardi's</b> teeth are still connected to her jawbone and show enamel wear suggesting a diet consisting of fruit and nuts. [...] The canine teeth of A. ramidus are smaller, and equal in size between males and females. This suggests reduced male-to-male conflict, pair-bonding, and increased parental investment."Thus fundamental reproductive and social behavioral changes probably occurred in hominids long before they had enlarged brains and began to use stone tools." ...|$|R
5000|$|After {{receiving}} her Ph.D, Ardi began {{a career}} in special education, working in Boston and New York, and serving as {{an assistant professor of}} education at Fordham University's Graduate School of Education. [...] In 1983, she was hired by McGraw-HillProductions, [...] which marked the start <b>of</b> <b>Ardi's</b> career in traditional and developing media. [...] In 1994, Ardi was hired by R.R. Donnelly and Sons, where she led the company's new media initiatives, and, in 1995, she was appointed Managing Director, Partner, and Global Practice Leader at TMP Worldwide, an executive search firm. At TMP, Ardi focused on human capital and organizational design. She left the company in 2000. [...] Subsequently, she joined Jerry Colonna, Bob Greene and Fred Wilson at Flatiron Partners, a well-known early-stage venture capital fund, where she developed the now-standard practice of including the value of human capital into the overall determination of corporate worth. From 2000 through 2009, Ardi served as a partner and managing director at JPMorgan Partners/CCMP Capital, LLC, a private equity firm. [...] Ardi left the company to found Corporate Anthropology Inc., a human capital and advisory firm which provides recruitment and organizational consulting to start ups, investors and corporate clients.|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} genetic and non-genetic factors and their {{interactions}} affecting growth rate and body weights at birth, weaning and at 6 {{months of age}} in Saudi Ardi, Damascus goats and their crosses. Methods: Crossbreeding program between Saudi Ardi(A) goats with Damascus(D) was carried out to improve the meat productivity <b>of</b> <b>Ardi</b> goats through crossbreeding. The pedigree records of the body weights were obtained from 754 kids (397 males and 357 females) produced from 46 Sires and 279 Dams. Birth weight, weaning weigh and 6 months weight as well as average daily gain during different growth stages from birth to weaning (D 1), weaning to 6 months (D 2) and from birth to 6 months of age (D 3) were recorded during winter/autumn and summer/spring. Data were classified according to breed, generation, sex, season, year, and type of birth. Data were analyzed using GLM procedure for the least-squares means of the fixed factors. Heritability and genetic parameters were estimated with derivative-free restricted maximum likelihood procedures using the MTDFREML program. Results: The percentages of variations were moderate for body weights and high for daily gains. Genetic groups had a highly significant (P< 0. 01) effect on the body weights traits. Damascus goats had higher (P< 0. 01) birth and weaning weights, but ½D½A group kids had a higher (P< 0. 01) body weight at 6 months. The genetic groups had a significant effects on the daily weight gains for D 1 (P< 0. 01) and D 3 (P< 0. 05) periods, whereas, it had no effects on D 2 period. The fixed effects of sex, season, year and type of birth were significant differences for body weights. Male kids were heavier (P< 0. 01) than females for different growth stages. Body weights and daily gains during winter/autumn were significantly higher (P< 0. 01) than summer/ spring. Kids born and raised as singles were significantly (P< 0. 01) heavier than those were born as twins or triplets. The genetic and phenotypic correlations between birth and weaning weights were positive for both Damascus and Ardi goats. Conclusions: Genetic program for Ardi goats through upgrading with Damascus is possible to improve meat production...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that the prognosis of ovarian cancer {{is influenced by the}} dose intensity of cytotoxic treatment. The impact of received dose intensity of platinum-based combination chemotherapy on disease outcome was analysed in 226 stage III-IV ovarian cancer patients entered into two prospective randomised trials. All patients received either cisplatin or carboplatin and cyclophosphamide with or without doxorubicin for six courses after primary surgery. The impact of the received dose intensity of each drug (RDI), the average received dose intensity of the treatment regimen (ARDI) and the relative total drug dose (RTD) on progression-free survival (PFS) and survival were analysed. In the 198 patients receiving the full six courses of treatment, RDI of cisplatin or carboplatin, ARDI and RTD were > 0. 76 in 74. 2, 61. 1 and 65. 1 % of cases, respectively. Although the differences were not significant, pathological complete response was more frequently observed in the group <b>of</b> patients with <b>ARDI</b> or = 0. 76 group.

40|$|Invisible {{damage caused}} by the {{wireworm}} up {{to the time of}} harvesting make {{it one of the most}} feared pests, especially in potato cultivation. As there is no curative management possible, the only way to fight against it is preventively. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to examine which factors make the risk of wireworm attacks more prevalent. This study aims to get a better understanding of risk of wireworm attacks within potato cultivation and a better understanding of potato producer views about wireworm management. Two types of enquiries were combined within the same survey: one about technical aspects and the other one about social aspects of the problem. They were completed by going in situ meeting farmers. Information collected was processed using statistical tools: MCA, PCA, and HCPC analyses. The technical part was analyzed within seven themes: previous crops, interculture, wireworm damage, supply of organic matter, plot environment, chemical use, and mechanical passes.

40|$|In mammals, protein {{arginine}} methyltransferase 5, PRMT 5, is {{the main}} type II enzyme responsible {{for the majority of}} symmetric dimethylarginine formation in polypeptides. Recent study reported that PRMT 5 restricts Hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication through epigenetic repression of HBV DNA transcription and interference with encapsidation of pregenomic RNA. Here we demonstrate that PRMT 5 interacts with the HBV core (HBc) protein and dimethylates arginine residues within the arginine-rich domain (ARD) of the carboxyl-terminus. ARD consists of four arginine rich subdomains, ARDI, ARDII, ARDIII and ARDIV. Mutation analysis of ARDs revealed that arginine methylation of HBc required the wild-type status <b>of</b> both <b>ARDI</b> and ARDII. Mass spectrometry analysis of HBc identified multiple potential ubiquitination, methylation and phosphorylation sites, out of which lysine K 7 and arginines R 150 (within ARDI) and R 156 (outside ARDs) were shown to be modified by ubiquitination and methylation, respectively. The HBc symmetric dimethylation appeared to be linked to serine phosphorylation and nuclear import of HBc protein. Conversely, the monomethylated HBc retained in the cytoplasm. Thus, overexpression of PRMT 5 led to increased nuclear accumulation of HBc, and vice versa, down-regulation of PRMT 5 resulted in reduced levels of HBc in nuclei of transfected cells. In summary, we identified PRMT 5 as a potent controller of HBc cell trafficking and function and described two novel types of HBc post-translational modifications (PTMs), arginine methylation and ubiquitination...|$|R

ABSTRACT: The joint liability presents a guarantee in group lending to Microfinance Institution. However this mechanism of lending is often accompanied by a strategic defect which generates failing micro-borrowers. The {{purpose of this study}} is to analyze in an econometric way this failure by using techniques of data analysis to study the validity and the efficiency of the group lending. To this end we shall use data from a foundation specialized in Microfinance, particularly in microcredit, it is a question in this study <b>of</b> the <b>ARDI</b> Foundation (Rabat – Morocco) for Microcredit. The handled database is constituted on one hand, by data collected from a field survey which targets the bad borrowers with regard to the number of days of delay of repayment, and on the other hand, data stemming from the information system of the foundation recapitulating the good borrowers. In this study we tried to establish characteristics of the borrowers, allowing to differentiate the vouchers of bad. The obtained results assert that the fundamental causes of the failure are, the absence of the mutual supervision and the mutual pressure, principles of the solidarity on which is based the microcredit.

40|$|The {{outcomes}} {{of a series}} of tests <b>of</b> the <b>ARDI</b> (Actors, Resources, Dynamics, and Interactions) method in complex cases or conflict-ridden situations is presented. <b>ARDI</b> is part <b>of</b> a companion modeling approach that makes it possible to engage a broad spectrum of stakeholders in the design and development of land and water management plans. It is based on participatory workshops that set out to collaboratively imagine a future open, dynamic management system, capable of adaptation and anticipation, by gathering the various stakeholders in a partnership to examine conservation of the natural resources and promoting a sustainable development. Its originality lies in the co-construction of a "conceptual model" of the functioning of the territory, according to an overarching, negotiated development question. The approach is based on the collective articulation of the key elements of a context or territory by stakeholders such as managers, representatives, socio-professional technicians, nongovernmental organizations, experts, and scientists, and local policy makers. This sharing of representations is done by means {{of a series of}} collective workshops during which Actors, Resources, Dynamics, and Interactions constituting the profile of the territory are identified and clarified. This work of co-construction is conducted within a precise methodological framework that we present in a step-by-step format. The method is grounded in concrete experience gleened from tests conducted by the authors over the past five years. Finally, the requirement for specific skills as well as pitfalls to avoid when applying the method are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{acid rock}} {{drainage}} index (ARDI) was developed to predict acid formation based on intact rock texture. Five textural parameters which have direct control on acid formation are evaluated. The <b>ARDI</b> forms part <b>of</b> the geochemistry–mineralogy–texture (GMT) approach to undertaking {{acid rock drainage}} (ARD) predictive tests. This staged-approach involves parallel use of geochemical, mineralogical and textural analyses. Sample screening is performed at stage-one, and a general classification given. Stage-two {{involves the use of}} routine geochemical tests in order to cross-check stage-one results, and also to quantify the acid forming/neutralising potential. Stage-three uses advanced geochemical tests and microanalytical tools to cross-check any ambiguous results from the previous stages, and for detailed characterisation of acid forming sulphide phases. Samples were obtained from two mine sites in Queensland, Australia, from which seventeen mesotextural groups were identified (A–Q). The ARDI identified mesotextural groups J (quartz–pyrite) and H (quartz–arsenopyrite–pyrite) as extremely acid forming. Routinely used geochemical classifications also identified these as the most acid forming groups. Four mesotextural groups (K–O) were classified as having acid neutralising capacity after full GMT classification. The remainder of mesotextural groups were classified as not acid forming. Mesotextural groups G (quartz–galena–sphalerite), H and J only require kinetic testing to resolve the lag-time to, and longevity of acid formation, and to measure the concentration of potentially deleterious elements released. The ARDI was not able to confidently discern between samples with the capacity to neutralise acid, and those which are not acid forming. Therefore, further refinement <b>of</b> the <b>ARDI</b> is required. However, in its current form the ARDI is suitable for mineral deposits with low-carbonate contents. This paper demonstrates its use as part of stage-one of the GMT approach at both operational and abandoned mine sites to screen and classify acid forming potential...|$|R
40|$|We {{analyzed}} {{the relationship between}} the clinical characteristics, comorbidity, average relative dose intensity (aRDI) and outcome in patients of over 75 years old with malignant lymphoma. Of the 98 patients studied, the mean age was 79. 9 years, and 68 patients (69. 4 %) had B-cell lymphomas, corresponding to mainly diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The 5 -year overall survival rate was 32. 2 % in 97 malignant lymphoma patients. T/NK subtype, poor performance status (PS) and high-intermediate/high international prognostic index (IPI) were found to be predictive of significantly poorer overall survival, {{as is the case in}} young patients. Correlation between comorbidity index and survival rate was not observed. We also {{analyzed the}} <b>aRDI</b> <b>of</b> cyclophosphamide and pirarubicin for 64 / 97 patients. The proportion of patients receiving ≤ 84 % of the planned DI during five cycles gradually increased. Most patients could not maintain aRDI ≥ 85 %. However, overall survival was not significantly different between patients with aRDI ≥ 0. 85 and those with aRDI ≤ 0. 84.

40|$|Alcohol-Related Disease Impact (ARDI) Software {{has been}} {{developed}} for the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) to allow States to calculate mortality, years of potential life lost (YPLL), direct health-care costs, indirect morbidity and mortality costs, and nonhealth-sector costs associated with alcohol use and misuse. The mortality related measures [...] mortality, YPLL, and indirect mortality costs [...] are computed for 35 diagnoses related to alcohol use and misuse. A review of clinical research studies and injury surveillance studies was conducted to produce estimates of the alcohol-attributable fraction (AAF) for each diagnosis.

40|$|Background: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the impact of a dose-dense primary chemotherapy on pathological response rate (pCR) in patients with locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) treated with combined modality therapy. Patients and methods: Stage IIIA/IIIB patients received three courses of induction chemotherapy (ICT) with cyclophosphamide, epirubicin and 5 -fluorouracil (CEF) followed by local therapy (total mastectomy or segmental mastectomy with axillary nodes dissection) and adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) with three courses of CEF alternated with three courses of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, 5 -fluorouracil (CMF). Patients were randomized to receive ICT and ACT every 3. weeks (arm A, 'standard treatment') or every 2 weeks with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) support (arm B, 'dose-dense treatment'). In both arms radiotherapy was administered after the end of chemotherapy (in selected cases) and patients with hormonal receptor-positive tumors received tamoxifen for 5 years. Results: A total of 150 patients were randomized (77 arm A and 73 arm 13) and demographics were well balanced between the two arms. Compliance to treatment was excellent: 95 % and 93 % of patients in arms A and 13, respectively, completed the treatment program with no modification or delay. Median duration of treatment (ICT+local+ACT) was 183 days (range 0 - 265) in arm A and 139 days (0 - 226) in arm B. The average relative dose intensity (<b>ARDI)</b> <b>of</b> chemotherapy was 1. 3 with a 30 % increase in the dose intensity in arm B in comparison with arm A. No difference in clinical [62 %; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 49 % to 73. 2 %] and pathological response rates to ICT was observed between the two arms. Median follow-up was 5 years (range 1 - 96 months); median disease-free survivals were 4. 8 years in arm A and 4. 5 years in arm B. Median overall survival was 7. 8 years in standard therapy: this figure has not yet been reached in the dose-dense treatment. Conclusions: In LABC a dose-dense regimen, while allowing a 30 % increase in the dose intensity of chemotherapy, did not provide significant improvement in pathological response rates. However, accelerated chemotherapy reduced the duration of the combined-modality program (6. 1 versus 4. 6 months) with no additional toxicities...|$|R
