In February 1981, Obama made his first public speech, calling for Occidental to {{participate}} in the disinvestment from South Africa in response to that nation's policy of apartheid. In mid-1981, Obama traveled to Indonesia to visit his mother and half-sister Maya, and visited the families of college friends in Pakistan and India for three weeks. Later in 1981, he transferred as a junior to Columbia University in New York City, where he majored in political science with a specialty in international relations and in English literature and lived off-campus on West 109th Street. He graduated with a BA degree in 1983 and worked for about a year at the Business International Corporation, where he was a financial researcher and writer, then as a project coordinator for the New York <b>Public</b> <b>Interest</b> <b>Research</b> Group on the City College of New York campus for three months in 1985.|$|E

40|$|Astronomy is {{a natural}} science {{attracting}} substantial <b>public</b> <b>interest.</b> On a human scale, most individual celestial objects are essentially unchanging but is the same true for <b>interest</b> in astronomy <b>research?</b> This article uses the popular online encyclopedia Wikipedia {{as a proxy for}} <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> in academic <b>research</b> and assesses {{the extent to which it}} cites astronomy and astrophysics articles published between 1996 and 2014.

The results show that older papers from before 2008 are increasingly less likely to be cited.
