5000|$|A <b>pastry</b> <b>blender</b> is {{a kitchen}} tool used to mix a hard (solid) fat into flour {{in order to}} make pastries. The tool is usually made of narrow metal strips or wires {{attached}} to a handle, and is used by pressing down on the items to be mixed (known as [...] "cutting in"). It is also used to break these fats (shortening, butter, lard) into smaller pieces.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are several}} {{alternatives}} to using a <b>pastry</b> <b>blender.</b> One {{is to work}} the fat into the flour with the fingertips, though this requires having a good [...] "touch" [...] and knowing just how lightly to work the fat into the flour without melting it. [...] Another is to use two table knives {{like a pair of}} scissors, one knife in each hand. A third is to use a food processor.|$|E
50|$|In both sweetcrust and shortcrust pastry, {{care must}} be taken to ensure that fat and flour are blended {{thoroughly}} before liquid is added. This ensures that the flour granules are adequately coated with fat and are less likely to develop gluten and may be achieved {{with the use of a}} food processor, a specialized kitchen utensil called a <b>pastry</b> <b>blender,</b> or through various alternatives, like a pair of table knives held in one hand.|$|E
5000|$|The {{shortening}} method, {{also known}} as the biscuit method, is used for biscuits and scones. This method cuts solid fat (whether lard, butter, or vegetable shortening) into flour and other dry ingredients using a food processor, <b>pastry</b> <b>blender,</b> or two hand-held forks. The layering from this process gives rise and adds flakiness as the folds of fat melt during baking. This technique is said to produce [...] "shortened" [...] cakes and breads, {{regardless of whether or not}} the chosen fat is vegetable shortening.|$|E
5000|$|A short {{dough is}} one that is crumbly or mealy. The {{opposite}} of a short dough is a [...] "long" [...] dough or dough that stretches. Vegetable shortening (or butter, or other solid fats) can produce both types of dough; the difference is in technique. To produce a short dough, which is commonly used for tarts, the shortening is cut into the flour with a <b>pastry</b> <b>blender,</b> pair of table knives, fingers, or other utensil until the resulting mixture has a fine, cornmeal-like texture. For a long dough, the shortening is cut in only until the pea-sized crumbs are formed, or even larger lumps may be included. After cutting in the fat, the liquid (if any) is added and the dough is shaped for baking.|$|E
5000|$|Shortcrust pastry : Shortcrust pastry is the {{simplest}} and most common pastry. It is made with flour, fat, butter, salt, and water to bind the dough. This is used mainly in tarts. It is also the pastry that is used most often in making a quiche. The process of making pastry includes mixing of the fat and flour, adding water, and rolling out the paste. The fat is mixed with the flour first, generally by rubbing with fingers or a <b>pastry</b> <b>blender,</b> which inhibits gluten formation by coating the gluten strands in fat and results in a short (as in crumbly; hence the term shortcrust), tender pastry. A related type is the sweetened sweetcrust pastry, also known as pâte sucrée, in which sugar and egg yolks have been added (rather than water) to bind the pastry.|$|E
