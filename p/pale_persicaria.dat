5000|$|Persicaria lapathifolia (syn. Polygonum lapathifolium), {{known as}} <b>pale</b> <b>persicaria,</b> [...] is a plant {{of the family}} Polygonaceae. It {{is closely related to}} Persicaria maculosa and as such is {{considered}} a weed in Britain and Europe. Other common names for the plant include pale smartweed, curlytop knotweed, and willow weed. It is a species complex made up of a great many varying forms, sometimes considered varieties. The environment also has a strong influence on the morphology of an individual plant.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} effect of different soil tillage and seeding rate on alfalfa root morphology. The field experiment was established in 3 variants of tillage: shallow cultivation (MK), loosening (HK) and conventional tillage (plough), all under two seeding rate (4 and 7 MGS). After autumn cut, root samples were collected in the depth of 25 cm. Lower seeding rate increased intensity of branching and number of lateral root per plant. Total mass of roots per hectar was higher in higher seeding rate variant. Ploughed variant provided higher intensity of branching and branching depth was the deepest of all variants. Loosed variant showed highest branch diameter out of all variants. Highest plant number per square meter was achieved in loosed variant but shallow cultivation showed highest plant survival rate of all variants. Tillage affected weed infestation by 33, 6 %. Dominant weeds in ploughed variant were field pennycress and <b>pale</b> <b>persicaria.</b> Dominant weeds in loosed variant were redroot pigweed and cockspur, while in shallow tillage variant dominant weeds were represented by cleavers and common knotgrass. Results of experiment show that shallow cultivation and loosening have similar influence on plant density and root morphology as conventional tillage. Reduced seeding rates are possible, but due to problematic field emergence of alfalfa and higher weed infestation of thinner stands, higher seeding rates prove themselves as superior...|$|E
40|$|After {{the dark}} Middle Ages {{there was an}} {{enormous}} increase in population in Europe and new grounds were developed. Because of its strategically profitable position, two successive castles were built at Kuinre, inhabited by the Lords of Kuinre. Both castles were swallowed by the Zuiderzee. After the Noordoostpolder fell dry, {{the remains of the}} castles were multiple times archaeologically researched. The first castle was dated between {{the second half of the}} 12 th and the 14 th century. The second one was dated between the 14 th century and 1531. Between 1531 and 1535 the second castle was pulled down and the re-usable material shipped to Genemuiden. An image of the environment is sketched in this essay. The first sample was taken from a ditch, which had been open during the last phase of the first castle and shows a variety of habitats around the first castle. On the peat grew heath, and along the coast salt marshes developed. On these salt marshes low growing species of Chenopodio-Oxalidetum fontanae (Association of the Many-seeded Goosefoot and Yellow Wood-sorrel) determined the vegetation. Closer to the castle it was Scirpetum tabernaemontani (Association of Grey Club-rush), with its communities of Rush, that defined the vegetation. It’s an indication for a brackish environment. The peat-areas around the sand dune on which the castle was situated were covered with heath. Al these species show an increase in wetness in the soil, caused by the expanding Zuiderzee. The ground salted up, en several salt-intolerant species disappeared. Camp sheeting at the moat shows some human interference. Salt marshes developed along the coast, with their own vegetation. The other samples were derived from moats around the second castle, and show the development of the vegetation around this castle through different phases. In the first phase, which took place from the end of the 14 th till the beginning of the 15 th century, the pioneering species Chenopodietum rubri (Association of Goose-foots and <b>Pale</b> <b>persicaria)</b> determined the vegetation. The heath consisted of Erico-Sphagnetum magellanici (Association of Cross-leaved Heath and Peat Moss). In and around the moats the species of Typho-Phragmitetum (Reed-association) were growing. It concerns here the sub-association in which Typha angustifolia dominates. The third sample, taken from moat 1 b, sketches an image of the changes in the vegetation during the second and third phase. In the 15 th century the species of the Reed-association kept covering the banks of the moats, protecting them as camp sheeting. Cladietum marisci (Green Fen Sedge-association) appears in the direct surroundings of the castle. The third sample was the first one with remains of Sphagnum in it, which showed changing heath vegetation caused by this area getting wetter and swampier as well. These moors were covered with Sphagno palustris-Ericetum (Marsh Heath). The brackish water environment speeded up the process. In the last sample the vegetation around the castle consisted of species of Chenopodietum rubri. The peat was covered with Marsh Heath. The plants of Scirpetum tabernaemontani determined the remaining vegetation along the moats, which were filled up during this phase. The fact that the area continuously kept getting wetter stipulated the vegetation, and caused for some species to disappear. The second was castle was built at only 800 meters away from the first one, and it didn’t take long for the expanding Zuiderzee to also threaten this castle. Is the second sample still showing a closed-off moat system, in the successive phase the area is already getting, and that the vegetation altered along in this process. There were also signs of the coast moving towards the second castle during this phase. The high number of Eriophorum vaginatum shows an increase in the formation of peat, another confirmation for these developments. At the end, the inhabitants of this castle were also forced to leave it, and loose the battle that they’ve fought for ages against the sea...|$|E
