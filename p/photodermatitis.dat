50|$|Ingestion of {{pigments}} {{capable of}} producing singlet oxygen with activation by light can produce severe photosensitivity of skin (see phototoxicity, photosensitivity in humans, <b>photodermatitis,</b> phytophotodermatitis). This is especially a concern in herbivorous animals (see Photosensitivity in animals).|$|E
50|$|The leaves have {{a bitter}} and {{unpalatable}} taste. Despite the lemon-like smell, {{the plant is}} acrid when eaten. All parts of the plant may cause mild stomach upset if eaten, and contact with the foliage may cause <b>photodermatitis.</b>|$|E
50|$|Delayed type 4 {{allergic}} hypersensitivity reactions including maculopapular exanthema, erythematous rash, urticarial eruption, erythema multiforme, <b>photodermatitis,</b> eczema and Stevens-Johnson syndrome can occasionally {{occur as}} a result of tetrazepam exposure. These hypersensitivity reactions to tetrazepam share no cross-reactivity with other benzodiazepines.|$|E
50|$|Examples {{of common}} drugs causing drug eruptions are {{antibiotics}} and other antimicrobial drugs, sulfa drugs, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), biopharmaceuticals, chemotherapy agents, anticonvulsants, and psychotropic drugs. Common examples include <b>photodermatitis</b> due to local NSAIDs (such as piroxicam) or due to antibiotics (such as minocycline), and the rash following ampicillin {{in cases of}} mononucleosis.|$|E
50|$|Medical {{organizations}} such as the American Cancer Society recommend the use of sunscreen because it aids in the prevention of squamous cell carcinomas. Many sunscreens do not block UVA radiation, which does not primarily cause sunburn but can increase the rate of melanoma and <b>photodermatitis.</b> The use of broad-spectrum (UVA/UVB) sunscreens can address this concern.|$|E
50|$|Porphyria cutanea tarda has a {{prevalence}} {{estimated at}} approximately 1 in 10,000. An estimated 80% of {{porphyria cutanea tarda}} cases are sporadic.

50|$|<b>Photodermatitis</b> {{may result}} in swelling, {{difficulty}} breathing, a burning sensation, a red itchy rash sometimes resembling small blisters, and peeling of the skin. Nausea may also occur. There may also be blotches where the itching may persist {{for long periods of}} time. In these areas an unsightly orange to brown tint may form, usually near or on the face.|$|E
50|$|<b>Photodermatitis,</b> {{sometimes}} referred to as sun poisoning or photoallergy, is a form of allergic contact dermatitis in which the allergen must be activated by light to sensitize the allergic response, and to cause a rash or other systemic effects on subsequent exposure. The second and subsequent exposures produce photoallergic skin conditions which are often eczematous. In rare cases the victims die.|$|E
50|$|The {{underlying}} mechanism can be immunological (such as in drug allergies) or non-immunological (for example, in <b>photodermatitis</b> or as a {{side effect}} of anticoagulants). A fixed drug eruption is the term for a drug eruption that occurs in the same skin area every time the person is exposed to the drug. Eruptions can occur frequently with a certain drug (for example, with phenytoin), or be very rare (for example, Sweet's syndrome following the administration of colony-stimulating factors).|$|E
50|$|The {{symptoms}} are equivalent to <b>photodermatitis,</b> but vary in severity.The skin condition is a cutaneous phototoxic inflammatory eruption resulting from contact with light-sensitizing botanical substances—particularly {{from the plant}} families Umbelliferae, Rutaceae, Moraceae, and Leguminosae—and ultraviolet light, typically from sun exposure. Phytophotodermatitis usually results in hyperpigmentation of the skin that often appears like a bruise. This may be accompanied by blisters or burning. The reaction typically begins within 24 hours of exposure and peaks at 48-72 hours after the exposure.|$|E
50|$|There is a rapid {{onset of}} {{clinical}} signs {{over the period}} of 2-7 days, beginning with anorexia, lethargy, and hyperbilirubinemia (icterus and discolored urine). Signs of hepatic encephalopathy (ataxia, blindness, aggression, and coma) and fever can also occur. Other signs include <b>photodermatitis,</b> hemorrhagic diathesis, dependent edema, and colic. The reason for colic is unknown, but {{is thought to be}} due to rapid decrease {{in the size of the}} liver, and the increased risk of gastric impaction. Rarely, weight loss can occur.|$|E
50|$|Medical {{organizations}} such as the American Cancer Society recommend the use of sunscreen because it aids in the prevention of squamous cell carcinomas. Many sunscreens do not block UVA radiation, which does not cause sunburn but can increase the rate of melanoma and <b>photodermatitis,</b> so people using sunscreens may be exposed to high UVA levels without realizing it. The use of broad-spectrum (UVA/UVB) sunscreens can address this concern. Diligent use of sunscreen can also slow or temporarily prevent the development of wrinkles and sagging skin.|$|E
50|$|Toxic {{epidermal}} necrolysis {{has occurred}} {{from the use}} of tetrazepam including at least one reported death. Stevens-Johnson syndrome and erythema multiforme has been reported from use of tetrazepam. Cross-reactivity with other benzodiazepines does not typically occur in such patients. Exanthema and eczema may occur. The lack of cross-reactivity with other benzodiazepines is believed to be due to the molecular structure of tetrazepam. <b>Photodermatitis</b> and phototoxicity have also been reported. Occupational contact allergy can also develop from regularly handling tetrazepam. Airborne contact dermatitis can also occur as an allergy which can develop from occupational exposure.|$|E
50|$|The series {{followed}} {{the adventures of}} Nick Knight, a Toronto cop working the graveyard shift with his partner Donald Schanke. Unbeknownst to most of his colleagues, Nick is actually Nicholas, an 800-year-old vampire (his human name was a pun based on {{his status as a}} literal knight in medieval France). Remorseful over centuries spent as a vampiric cold-hearted killer, Nicholas works as a cop and often ends up using his special abilities to bring criminals to justice. Nicholas explains his need to work on the night shift by claiming to have a skin disorder, <b>photodermatitis,</b> which requires him to stay out of sunlight. Refusing to feed from humans, he survives by drinking bottled animal blood, something that most vampires find repulsive. The only one who knows his true nature is his friend Natalie Lambert, a city medical examiner who doesn't like for Nicholas to use his special powers as she believes it increases his need for blood.|$|E
50|$|Antibiotics are {{screened}} for any negative effects before their approval for clinical use, {{and are usually}} considered safe and well tolerated. However, some antibiotics {{have been associated with}} a wide extent of adverse side effects ranging from mild to very severe {{depending on the type of}} antibiotic used, the microbes targeted, and the individual patient. Side effects may reflect the pharmacological or toxicological properties of the antibiotic or may involve hypersensitivity or allergic reactions. Adverse effects range from fever and nausea to major allergic reactions, including <b>photodermatitis</b> and anaphylaxis. Safety profiles of newer drugs are often not as well established as for those that have a long history of use. Common side-effects include diarrhea, resulting from disruption of the species composition in the intestinal flora, resulting, for example, in overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria, such as Clostridium difficile. Antibacterials can also affect the vaginal flora, and may lead to overgrowth of yeast species of the genus Candida in the vulvo-vaginal area. Additional side-effects can result from interaction with other drugs, such as the possibility of tendon damage from the administration of a quinolone antibiotic with a systemic corticosteroid.|$|E
40|$|A mild, micropapular {{eruption}} previously coined as “solar dermatitis” on the extensor of {{the forearm}} {{is a common}} form of <b>photodermatitis</b> in Taiwan. This study aimed to investigate the clinicopathologic findings of “solar dermatitis”, the micropapular type of <b>photodermatitis.</b> Methods: We characterized the features of this <b>photodermatitis</b> by retrospectively reviewing and analyzing all such cases in a medical center in Southern Taiwan diagnosed during October 1988 to November 2010. Results: A total of 34 Taiwanese patients, all with Fitzpatrick skin type III–IV, were included (M:F =  1 : 1; mean age =  33. 5 years; range =  9 – 62 years). Patients typically presented numerous, monomorphous, pinhead-sized micropapules on the extensor of the forearm after a recent, more intense sun exposure. The rash was often mildly pruritic and recurred in the summer, but usually resolved {{in a few days}} after sun protection and topical corticosteroid treatment. Reduced minimal erythema dose to UVB was noted in 2 of the 5 patients tested. Histopathologic examination (n =  10) revealed a mild spongiotic dermatitis. Conclusion: The clinicopathologic findings of the “solar dermatitis” closely resembled those of the pinpoint papular variant of polymorphous light eruption (PP-PMLE) affecting African Americans and Asians in Singapore. PP-PMLE, micropapular light eruption in Japanese, summertime actinic lichenoid eruption in Indians and the present <b>photodermatitis</b> might represent a common, micropapular variant of PMLE affecting darker skin populations...|$|E
40|$|There {{are several}} groups of {{chemicals}} that may produce contact <b>photodermatitis</b> {{and the action}} spectra for photopatch tests with these chemicals have been established. Controversy exists about UVR sensitivity in patients with contact <b>photodermatitis</b> when tests are performed on normal appearing skin without {{the addition of the}} chemical. Four patients became “persistent light reactors” after developing contact <b>photodermatitis</b> from fentichlor, 3 after using a hair cream containing the chemical, the 4 th after industrial exposure. Normal appearing skin {{on the back of the}} trunk was tested to narrow waveband UVR and visible light, fentichlor was not added to the skin during these tests. Abnormal reactions to UVB occurred in all 4 patients and all showed sensitivity to UVA, to 340 nm in 1, to 360 nm in 1 and to 400 nm in 2. At pH 4 fentichlor absorbed between 310 nm and 325 nm, but at pH 9. 2 absorption was between 275 nm and 350 nm, there was no absorption above 350 n. m. The results of tests with narrow waveband UVR show that true sensitivity to UVB does exist in the normal appearing skin of “persistent light reactors,” the sensitivity is not spurious. The normal skin of these patients is also sensitive to UVA. Possible reasons for the UVR sensitivity are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Background: There is {{a strong}} {{need to develop a}} photopatch test tray {{suitable}} for Indian patients of <b>photodermatitis</b> as European/Scandinavian photopatch test trays may not be wholly relevant for them. Aim: We carried out this study using photoallergens relevant in the Indian context to determine their relevance in patients of <b>photodermatitis.</b> Methods: Thirty patients (M:F, 23 : 7) between 19 and 76 years of age of <b>photodermatitis</b> and 10 controls were patch- and photopatch tested with 20 common photoallergens. In addition, the patients were also (photo) patch tested with articles of daily use as and when these were suspected to be the cause. Results: Forty-three positive reactions to one or more antigens were seen in 22 (74 %) patients. Fourteen positive photopatch tests to seven allergens were observed in 10 (33 %) patients, and nine (30 %) of them had a definite relevance. The most common contact allergen was fragrance mix (FM) (30 %), followed by p-phenylenediamine (20 %) and Parthenium hysterophorous (17 %). The definite relevance of the patch- and photopatch tests could be correlated in 47 % of these patients. Conclusions: FM is the most common contact and photocontact allergen among the various photopatch test antigens. Although differences in technique and evaluation make direct comparison between different centers difficult, still photopatch testing remains an integral part and gold standard for the work-up of the photosensitive patients...|$|E

40|$|A {{total of}} 1, 050 {{patients}} with histories and clinical pictures suggestive of photoallergic contact dermatitis were seen. All the patients underwent photopatch tests with haptens {{proposed by the}} Gruppo Italiano Ricerca Dermatiti da Contatto plus other substances suggested by each patient's history. Two hundred fifty-nine patients (24. 6 %) were positive {{to at least one}} test substance of the standard series or to substances added.

40|$|AbstractThe plant Cassia tora L., Fabaceae, traditionally, {{is claimed}} to be useful in the {{treatment}} of psoriasis and other skin diseases. In order to evaluate this information, antipsoriatic activity of three flavonoids, namely luteolin- 7 -O-β-glucopyranoside (1), quercetin- 3 -O-β-D- glucuronide (2) and formononetin- 7 -O-β-D-glucoside (3), isolated from the ethanol extract of C. tora leaves were investigated using UV-B induced <b>photodermatitis</b> model. Further, the flavonoids present in the ethanol extract were identified using HPLC by comparing their retention time with known standard luteolin, quercetin and formononetin. In the UV induced <b>photodermatitis</b> model, histopathological analysis of the section revealed the absence of Munro's microabscess, elongation of rete ridges, and capillary loop dilation in ethanol extract (400 mg/kg), isolated compound 2, 3 and standard group. The ethanolic extract (400 mg/kg) and isolated compounds 1, 2 and 3 exhibited a significant (p < 0. 01) percentage reduction of relative epidermal thickness when compared with a positive control. In the HPLC analysis, three flavonoids were identified by comparison of the retention times of standard marker, namely luteolin, quercetin and formononetin. We concluded, using animal model, that the flavonoids from Cassia tora leaves have significant antipsoriatic activity...|$|E
40|$|Parthenium {{dermatitis}} is {{a widespread}} and distressing dermatoses in rural and urban India caused by the air borne allergen of the Compositae weed Parthenium hysterophorus. Parthenium dermatitis has been thought to be mediated solely by type IV hypersensitivity, but recently a combined immediate (type I) and delayed (type IV) hypersensitivity mechanism has been postulated in the initiation and perpetuation of parthenium dermatitis, especially in sensitized subjects with an atopic diathesis. Initially, the exposed sites of the body are involved. Later {{in the course of}} the disease, unexposed sites may get involved. Various clinical presentations have been described in parthenium dermatitis. Typically, it presents as an air borne contact dermatitis (ABCD) involving the eyelids and nasolabial folds Other presentations include a <b>photodermatitis</b> (essentially a pseudo <b>photodermatitis),</b> atopic dermatitis, seborrheic dermatitis, exfoliative dermatitis, hand dermatitis. Photosensitive lichenoid dermatitis and prurigo nodularis are rarer presentations. Uncommon presentations have been described in parthenium dermatitis. They include prurigo nodularis-like lesions and photosensitive lichenoid eruption. Three cases are presented, two of whom presented as polymorphic-like lesions and one as prurigo nodularis. All three patch tested positive to parthenium on Day 2. Prick testing was positive in two of the three patients. Parthenium dermatitis mimicking polymorphic light eruption has not been reported. Histopathology revealed vasculitis in the lesional skin in two of the patients. Although leukocytoclastic vasculitis has been reported earlier from the prick-tested site, this is the first report demonstrating the presence of vasculitis in lesional skin of parthenium dermatitis...|$|E
40|$|Ubidecarenone (coenzyme Q) is a lipidsoluble quinone with anti-oxidative properties, which exerts a {{scavenger}} {{effect on}} oxygen free radicals.

40|$|Adverse {{reaction}} to cosmetics constitute {{a small but}} significant {{number of cases of}} contact dermatitis with varied appearances. These can present as contact allergic dermatitis, <b>photodermatitis,</b> contact irritant dermatitis, contact urticaria, hypopigmentation, hyperpigmentotion or depigmentation, hair and nail breakage. Fifty patients were included for the study to assess the role of commonly used cosmetics in causing adverse reactions. It was found that hair dyes, lipsticks and surprisingly shaving creams caused more reaction as compared to other cosmetics. Overall incidence of contact allergic dermatitis seen was 3. 3 &#x 0025; with patients own cosmetics. Patch testing was also done with the basic ingredients and showed positive results in few cases where casual link could be established.

40|$|Background: <b>Photodermatitis</b> is an {{abnormal}} response to ultraviolet radiation (UVR). The photoallergic contact dermatitis caused by plant allergens {{is a serious}} cause of morbidity in India. Airborne contact dermatitis is the classical presentation of plant-induced dermatosis, which may become difficult to differentiate from chronic actinic dermatitis in chronic cases. The rapid growth of parthenium weed in India and its ill effects on the population make it important to detect all cases of parthenium sensitivity, which in some cases might simulate <b>photodermatitis.</b> Aims: This study aims to detect the occurrence of plant sensitivity and photosensitivity in idiopathic-acquired photodermatoses, airborne contact dermatitis and general population taken as controls. Methods: One hundred and fifty six consecutive patients suffering from polymorphic light eruption (PMLE), chronic actinic dermatitis (CAD) and airborne contact dermatitis (ABCD) {{were enrolled in the}} study over a period of three years (June 2004 to May 2007). An equal number of age and sex matched healthy subjects were enrolled in the study as controls. All the patients were subjected to detailed history taking, clinical examination and histopathological examination for diagnosis. Patch and photopatch testing were perfomed in all the patients and healthy controls for detection of allergic and photoallergic reactions to parthenium, xanthium and chrysanthemum plant antigens and control antigens. Results: Out of 156 patients enrolled in the study, 78 (50 &#x 0025;) had CAD, 67 (42. 9 &#x 0025;) had PMLE and 11 (7. 05 &#x 0025;) had ABCD. The occurrence of parthenium/xanthium allergy and photoallergy, either to parthenium or both was most commonly found in ABCD (72. 7 &#x 0025;), followed by CAD (32 &#x 0025;). In PMLE 4. 5 &#x 0025; cases showed photoallergy. Only 1. 9 &#x 0025; in the control group showed sensitivity to parthenium and xanthium. Conclusion: This study indicates that parthenium (and possibly xanthium) may act as important environmental factors in the initiation and perpetuation of not only ABCD but of CAD as well. Photoexacerbation to UVA at positive parthenium/xanthium sensitivity sites in ABCD and CAD indicates that ABCD with photosensitivity to compositae can lead to CAD...|$|E
40|$|This study {{reports the}} {{induction}} of contact <b>photodermatitis</b> to musk ambrette, 2 -methoxy- 3, 5 -dinitro- 4 -methyl-t-butylbenzene, in guinea pigs. Photoallergic contact dermatitis was assayed using 2 alternative induction methods. Successful photosensitization was achieved {{only when the}} nuchal skin was stripped with scotch tape before application of musk ambrette and ultraviolet radiation. Induction methods utilizing non-stripped nuchal skin which induce photosensitivity to potent photoallergens were ineffective for musk ambrette. Phototoxicity tests to musk ambrette at concentrations between 1 and 50 % and a dose of 10. 2 joules/cm 2 from “Black Light” fluorescent tubes were all negative. Under identical irradiation conditions, anthracene at 0. 9 % and 8 -methoxypsoralen at 1 % were consistently positive. The mechanism of photosensitivity to musk ambrette appears to be photoallergic rather than phototoxic. The requirement for skin abrasion to induce photosensitization parallels the clinical reports of photosensitivity to musk ambrette in man...|$|E
