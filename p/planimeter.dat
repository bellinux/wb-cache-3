40|$|BACKGROUND: 3 D transesophageal {{echocardiography}} (TEE) may provide more accurate aortic annular and left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) dimensions and geometries compared with 2 D TEE. We assessed agreements between 2 D and 3 D TEE measurements with multislice computed tomography (MSCT) {{and changes in}} annular/LVOT areas and geometries after transcatheter aortic valve implantations (TAVI). METHODS AND RESULTS: Two-dimensional circular (pixr(2)), 3 D circular, and 3 D <b>planimetered</b> annular and LVOT areas by TEE were compared with "gold standard" MSCT <b>planimetered</b> areas before TAVI. Mean MSCT <b>planimetered</b> annular area was 4. 65 +/- 0. 82 cm(2) before TAVI. Annular areas were underestimated by 2 D TEE circular (3. 89 +/- 0. 74 cm(2), P< 0. 001), 3 D TEE circular (4. 06 +/- 0. 79 cm(2), P< 0. 001), and 3 D TEE <b>planimetered</b> annular areas (4. 22 +/- 0. 77 cm(2), P< 0. 001). Mean MSCT <b>planimetered</b> LVOT area was 4. 61 +/- 1. 20 cm(2) before TAVI. LVOT areas were underestimated by 2 D TEE circular (3. 41 +/- 0. 89 cm(2), P< 0. 001), 3 D TEE circular (3. 89 +/- 0. 94 cm(2), P< 0. 001), and 3 D TEE <b>planimetered</b> LVOT areas (4. 31 +/- 1. 15 cm(2), P< 0. 001). Three-dimensional TEE <b>planimetered</b> annular and LVOT areas had the best agreement with respective MSCT <b>planimetered</b> areas. After TAVI, MSCT <b>planimetered</b> (4. 65 +/- 0. 82 versus 4. 20 +/- 0. 46 cm(2), P< 0. 001) and 3 D TEE <b>planimetered</b> (4. 22 +/- 0. 77 versus 3. 62 +/- 0. 43 cm(2), P< 0. 001) annular areas decreased, whereas MSCT <b>planimetered</b> (4. 61 +/- 1. 20 versus 4. 84 +/- 1. 17 cm(2), P= 0. 002) and 3 D TEE <b>planimetered</b> (4. 31 +/- 1. 15 versus 4. 55 +/- 1. 21 cm(2), P< 0. 001) LVOT areas increased. Aortic annulus and LVOT became less elliptical after TAVI. CONCLUSIONS: Before TAVI, 2 D and 3 D TEE aortic annular/LVOT circular geometric assumption underestimated the respective MSCT <b>planimetered</b> areas. After TAVI, 3 D TEE and MSCT <b>planimetered</b> annular areas decreased as it assumes the internal dimensions of the prosthetic valve. However, <b>planimetered</b> LVOT areas increased due to a more circular geometry...|$|R

40|$|AIMS: In {{patients}} with aortic stenosis (AS), echocardiographic grading of stenosis severity is important, in particular for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). Three-dimensional (3 D) echocardiography and correction for pressure recovery (PR) by energy loss index (ELI) may improve aortic valve area (AVA) calculation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirty-nine {{patients with}} severe AS evaluated for TAVI were included. Left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) and ascending aorta (AA) cross-sectional area were determined in transthoracic two-dimensional echocardiography (2 DTTE), 2 D transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), 3 DTEE, and multislice computed tomography (MSCT). AVA {{was calculated by}} the continuity equation and corrected for PR. ELI was determined as [(AVA × AA) /(AA - AVA) ]/body surface area. LVOT area was 2. 41  ±  0. 17  cm(2) calculated using 2 DTTE, 2. 82  ±  0. 16  cm(2) calculated using 2 DTEE, 3. 96  ±  0. 14  cm(2) <b>planimetered</b> in 3 DTEE, and 4. 47  ±  0. 18  cm(2) <b>planimetered</b> in MSCT (P <  0. 001).

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{a method for}} measuring blood flow through the mitral valve 18 normal subjects and 19 patients with cardiac disease in whom mitral and aortic blood flows were identical were studied. Initially the mitral ring area was <b>planimetered</b> from the echocardiographic image, but the results of area calculation using the mathematical formula for the area of an ellipse were found to approximate to within 8 % of the <b>planimetered</b> result in most cases. The formula was therefore used if the ring appeared elliptical on the cross sectional echo image, and other shapes were <b>planimetered.</b> Mitral velocity, aligned with flow in three planes, was recorded just distal to the ring. Mitral flow calculated using the elliptical technique correlated closely with flow measured in the ascending aorta by the Doppler technique and also with systemic flow measured by the Fick method at cardiac catheterisation in 10 patients. The mitral flow technique that assumed a circular orifice correlated almost as well with Doppler aortic flow and with Fick flow but overestimated flow by a mean of 1446 ml, whereas the elliptical method had a mean error of only 138 ml. Both methods correlated well with standards, but the elliptical method was easy to apply and gave a better correlation with comparison reference values...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectives. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the impact of changes in flow on aortic valve area (AVA) as measured by the Gorlin formula and transesophageal echocardiographic (TEE) planimetry. Background. The meaning of flow-related changes in AVA calculations using the Gorlin formula in patients with aortic stenosis remains controversial. It has been suggested that flow dependence of the calculated area could be due to a true widening of the orifice as flow increases or to a disproportionate flow dependence of the formula itself. Alternatively, anatomic AVA can be measured by direct planimetry of the valve orifice with TEE. Methods. Simultaneous measurement of the <b>planimetered</b> and Gorlin valve area was performed intraoperatively under different hemodynamic conditions in 11 patients. Left ventricular and ascending aortic pressures were measured simultaneously after transventricular and aortic punctures. Changes in flow were induced by dobutamine infusion. Using multiplane TEE, AVA was <b>planimetered</b> at the level of the leaflet tips in the short-axis view. Results. Overall, cardiac output, stroke volume and transvalvular volume flow rate ranged from 2. 5 to 7. 3 liters/min, from 43 to 86 ml and from 102 to 306 ml/min, respectively. During dobutamine infusion, cardiac output increased by 42 % and mean aortic valve gradient by 54 %. When minimal flow was compared with maximal flow, the Gorlin area varied from (mean ± SD) 0. 44 ± 0. 12 to 0. 60 ± 0. 14 cm 2 (p < 0. 005). The mean change in Gorlin area under different flow rates was 36 ± 32 %. Despite these changes, there was no significant change in the <b>planimetered</b> area when minimal flow was compared with maximal flow. The mean difference in <b>planimetered</b> area under different flow rates was 0. 002 ± 0. 01 cm 2 (p = 0. 86). Conclusions. By simultaneous determination of Gorlin formula and TEE planimetry valve areas, we showed that acute changes in transvalvular volume flow substantially altered valve area calculated by the Gorlin formula but did not result in significant alterations of the anatomic valve area in aortic stenosis. These results suggest that the flow-related variation in the Gorlin AVA is due to a disproportionate flow dependence of the formula itself and not a true change in valve area.

Design: Prospective observational study. Setting: Tertiary care university hospital. Participants: 35 patients without structural valve abnormalities undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass grafting. Interventions: Left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) diameter determined with 2 D TEE was used to estimate LVOT cross-sectional area (CSA(LVOT)). LVOT area was measured directly with 3 D TEE by planimetry on an en face view. SV and CO were calculated for both methods using the continuity equation. Measurements and Main Results: The area of the LVOT differed significantly between methods, being significantly larger in the 3 D method (3. 57 +/- 0. 70 cm(2) v 3. 98 +/- 0. 93 cm(2)). This resulted in a 10 % lower CO with the 2 D method of LVOT area estimation. Conclusions: LVOT area is underestimated with the single-axis 2 D method when compared with 3 D <b>planimetered</b> area. This results in a CO that is approximately 10 % lower with the 2 D method. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
