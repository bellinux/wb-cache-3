5|$|As {{with the}} {{previous}} game, enemies appear in the open field and can be avoided or engaged. The number of enemies increases during night-time, and their strength and ability to deal damage increases the more days pass in-game. By killing all the standard versions of an enemy, a final version appears as a boss. Defeating it will yield a high reward and make the enemy type extinct {{in an area of}} the game. When Lightning attacks an enemy, or they attack her, the battle starts. If Lightning strikes a monster, they lose a small portion of health, while if the enemy strikes Lightning first, she will lose health. As Lightning performs attacks, her ATB meter is drained and she must switch to another assigned garb: the depleted garb's meter recharges while not being used. Lightning utilizes her many swords for short-range melee attacks and magic for long-range attacks. She can block enemy attacks using her shield and has the option to evade an attack, which can be assigned to any garb. Each enemy has a stagger meter, represented by a line behind their health bar. As Lightning lands certain kinds of magical or physical blows on the enemy, their meter oscillates more. Eventually, the enemy is staggered, rendering them vulnerable to damaging attacks. Lightning can also spend Energy Points to perform special moves or activate abilities, such as Overclock (which slows time for Lightning's opponents and enables her to land more hits); and Army of One, Lightning's signature move. By winning battles, Lightning earns gil, the in-game currency, and replenishes a portion of her Energy <b>Point</b> <b>gauge.</b> In Normal and Hard modes, if Lightning flees from or dies in battle, one in-game hour is lost. Unlike the last two games, the player character does not automatically recover HP after battles, instead needing to use remedies bought from merchants and shops, and there is no auto-battle mode, with Lightning needing to be controlled manually at all times. In Easy Mode, Lightning regenerates health if she stands idle.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} both a {{microwave}} attenuation measurement along a horizontal line and multiple <b>point</b> <b>gauge</b> measurements are analyzed as possible ground-truth designs to validate satellite precipitation retrieval algorithms {{at the field}} of view spatial level (typically about 20 km). The design consists of comparing a sequence of pairs of contemporaneous measurements taken from the ground and from space. The authors examine theoretically the variance of expected differences between the two systems. The line average measurement leads to a smaller mean-square error compared to the case of a single <b>point</b> <b>gauge,</b> since some of the small-scale variability of the rain field is smoothed away by the line integration. The multiple <b>point</b> <b>gauge</b> measurements also give smaller mean-square error than that of a single <b>point</b> <b>gauge.</b> The centroid of the line and <b>point</b> <b>gauge</b> configurations are considered to be located randomly inside {{the field of view}} for different overpasses. A space-time spectral formalism is used with a noise-forced diffusive rain field to find the mean-square error. By considering instantaneous ground and satellite measurement pairs over about 50 visits when raining, we can reduce the expected error to approximately 10 % of the standard deviation of climatological variability. This {{is considered to be a}} useful level of tolerance for identifying biases in the retrieval algorithms. It is found that the multiple point gauges (especially two gauges) are the economical ground-truth design compared to the microwave attenuation based on the mean-square error comparison. The major finding of this study is that a significant improvement over the <b>point</b> <b>gauge</b> is obtained by adding a single additional piece of information; adding more gauges or extending the line of attenuation is not an important improvement...|$|E

The choice of beam defining optics {{can play a}} large role in the magnitude of these errors.

Large specimens usually require necessarily large distances between the slits and the instrument reference <b>point</b> (<b>gauge</b> volume). At large distances, the slit system can lead to significant underestimation of the residual strain magnitude as well as poor definition of the gauge volume.
