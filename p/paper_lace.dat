5000|$|As {{popular music}} and the society it {{mirrored}} changed from the late 1960s onward, the themes carried on in different forms and styles. Songs and spoken-word productions {{about the dangers of}} drug abuse joined the parade of pathos on radio airwaves, ranging from three-minute morality plays to lamentations (from the parental perspective) on the generation gap. These include [...] "Once You Understand" [...] by Think (U.S. #23, 1971) and radio and TV host Art Linkletter's Grammy-winning single [...] "We Love You, Call Collect" [...] (U.S. #42, 1969). Recorded before his daughter Diane's apparent suicide in 1969, the record also included Diane speaking the reply, [...] "Dear Mom and Dad". [...] Into the 1970s, as the Vietnam War continued, hit ballads of youth and death included B. J. Thomas' [...] "Billy and Sue" [...] (1972) and Terry Jacks' No. 1 hit [...] "Seasons in the Sun" [...] (1974), their protagonists of indeterminate age, or slightly older than teens. A song that was thought to have referenced the Civil War was <b>Paper</b> <b>Lace's</b> 1974 hit [...] "Billy Don't Be a Hero." [...] Hard-rock acts recorded vehicular death scenarios such as [...] "D.O.A."

60|$|Nothing {{had changed}} there. She {{closed her eyes}} and saw the little dining room in all the dignity of Sunday dinner, the big silver soup tureen {{catching}} the sun, the flowered china with the gilt edges, and even a glimpse of <b>lace</b> <b>paper</b> when the closet door opened; Aunt Mary and Uncle Tom, with Peter between them.

60|$|This baulked me a little, and I {{resolved}} to push at something or other, for I {{was not used}} to come back so often without purchase; so the next day I dressed myself up fine, and took a walk {{to the other end of}} the town. I passed through the Exchange in the Strand, but had no notion of finding anything to do there, when on a sudden I saw a great cluttering in the place, and all the people, shopkeepers as well as others, standing up and staring; and what should it be but some great duchess come into the Exchange, and they said the queen was coming. I set myself close up to a shop-side with my back to the counter, as if to let the crowd pass by, when keeping my eye upon a parcel of lace which the shopkeeper was showing to some ladies that stood by me, the shopkeeper and her maid were so taken up with looking to see who was coming, and what shop they would go to, that I found means to slip a <b>paper</b> of <b>lace</b> into my pocket and come clear off with it; so the lady-milliner paid dear enough for her gaping after the queen.|$|R

60|$|Sutcliffe! No {{need to tell}} Honora what Sutcliffe was--her cousins {{had talked}} of little else during the past winter; and shown, if the truth be told, just a little commiseration for Honora. Sutcliffe {{was not only a}} famous girls' school, Sutcliffe was the world--that world which, since her {{earliest}} remembrances, she had been longing to see and know. In a desperate attempt to realize what had happened to her, she found herself staring hard at the open china closet, at Aunt Mary's best gold dinner set resting on the pink <b>lace</b> <b>paper</b> that had been changed only last week. That dinner set, somehow, was always an augury of festival--when, on the rare occasions Aunt Mary entertained, the little dining room was transformed by it and the Leffingwell silver into a glorified and altogether unrecognizable state, in which any miracle seemed possible.|$|R
6000|$|Miss Celia {{had been}} gone a fortnight, and every one was longing to have her back. The first week brought Ben a newspaper, with a crinkly line drawn round the marriages to attract {{attention}} to that spot, and one was marked by a black frame with a large hand pointing {{at it from the}} margin. Thorny sent that; but the next week came a parcel for Mrs. Moss, and in it was discovered a box of wedding cake for every member of the family, including Sancho, who ate his at one gulp, and chewed up the <b>lace</b> <b>paper</b> which covered it. This was the third week; and, as if there could not be happiness enough crowded into it for Ben, the letter he read on his way home told him that his dear mistress was coming back on the following Saturday.

However small the pieces, the block should be cut so that each person gets some of each kind. They are generally laid on a <b>lace</b> <b>paper</b> on an ice plate. Four or five kinds are usually put in the mold, though three sorts will do. The following {{will serve as a}} guide in arranging: First, vanilla cream, then raspberry or cherry or currant water; coffee or chocolate in the middle; the strawberry cream, with lemon or orange or pineapple water to finish. A cream ice flavored with any liqueur, a brown bread cream flavored with brandy, with a couple of bright-colored water ices, form another agreeable mixture. Tea cream may be introduced into almost any combination unless coffee were used. Banana cream, pistachio, or almond cream with cherry water and damson or strawberry water are other options.|$|R
