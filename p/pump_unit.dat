5|$|Steam is {{provided}} by an elderly Marshall portable boiler– essentially a portable engine without the actual engine. It was built in Gainsborough, Lincolnshire in 1938 before being used by Thames Water as a stand by steam generator. It was given to Kew Bridge Steam Museum (now the London Museum of Water & Steam) before being {{passed on to the}} Westonzoyland Museum and then restored with a grant from the Preservation of Industrial and Scientific Materials Foundation (PRISM). The boiler provides steam at 50 Pounds per square inch (psi) to the other exhibits. It has been fitted with two whistles, one from Wattstown and the other from Ty Mawr Collieries in Wales, both of which were donated by the National Coal Board. Along with the boiler in the outdoor courtyard area are a waterwheel <b>pump</b> <b>unit</b> built by G. H. Harris of Wadebridge, a Lee Howl pump and Lister deep well pump.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, {{more than}} 340 of the village's 1,830 {{residents}} {{served in the}} United States Armed Forces. The Hook and Ladder Company waived fees and dues for those enlisted from 1941 onward. Such {{a sufficient number of}} firefighters was serving the armed forces that the village requested volunteers ages 16–18 to join the Briarcliff Manor Fire Department; at least nine served on active duty during the war and had the ability to excuse themselves from school (which was then located adjacent to Law Memorial Park) if the fire siren went off. Also during the war, in 1944, the department received a trailer-type <b>pump</b> <b>unit</b> with a 500-gallon pump, hose, nozzle, ladders, and other tools. It was loaned to the village by the Office of Civil Defense and was an auxiliary to the existing equipment. One year later, Briarcliff High School graduate and Briarcliff Fire Company lieutenant Sgt. Arthur J. Quinn, Jr. of the 45th Division was killed in action in Germany.|$|E

30|$|Phased <b>pump</b> <b>units</b> was a beam <b>pumping</b> <b>units</b> {{with high}} performance, {{developing}} in recent several decades such as CYJY in China and Mark/Mark II in USA. Phased <b>pump</b> <b>units</b> had two differences against to conventional pump units: the first {{difference was that}} its gearbox was deviated from the holder, the second difference {{was that there was}} a balance phase angle in the center of gravity of counterbalance, the crank always fall behind with phase angle in clockwise. Therefore, in the upstroke, the acceleration and dynamic load of phase <b>pump</b> <b>units</b> decreased, and the peak torque of gearbox decreased (Feng et al. 2016).|$|R
30|$|The beam <b>pumping</b> <b>units</b> {{applied in}} {{oilfield}} {{for more than}} 150  years, because it had the advantages of simple structure, reliable and durable. At present, it {{is still one of}} the most important artificial lift methods in the world. Due to the inherent structure of the beam <b>pumping</b> <b>units,</b> the balanced torque curve of gearbox has a bigger fluctuation ratio and negative torque that results low motor efficiency and load impact. Because the motor efficiency is directly proportional to the fluctuation ratio of gearbox torque, many researchers designed many types of energy-saving devices to improve the system efficiency. Therefore, based on the balance theory of gearbox torque, we introduced and discussed some significant energy-saving technologies, such as phased <b>pumping</b> <b>units,</b> dual-horsehead <b>pumping</b> <b>units,</b> shock absorber device, load reducer device, lower barbell <b>pumping</b> <b>units,</b> multi-balance device, flywheel-energy-storage device, variable speed drive device.

30|$|The working {{characteristic}} of dual-horsehead <b>pump</b> <b>units</b> was slow upstroke and fast down stroke that can increase its system efficiency, and can decrease the maximum suspend velocity and the maximum suspend acceleration {{that was good}} for decreasing suspend dynamic load (Liu and Feng 2014). However, the flexible drive rope was easy to worn {{so that it was}} not suitable for oil well with higher working load.
