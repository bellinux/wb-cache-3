25|$|There were {{thousands}} of <b>people</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>move,</b> as African Americans tried to reunite families separated by slaves sales, and sometimes migrated for better opportunities in towns or other states. Other freed people moved from plantation areas to cities or towns {{for a chance to}} get different jobs. At the same time, whites returned from refuges to reclaim plantations or town dwellings. In some areas, many whites returned to the land to farm for a while. Some freedpeople left the South altogether for states such as Ohio and Indiana, and later, Kansas. Thousands of others joined the migration to new opportunities in the Mississippi and Arkansas Delta bottomlands and Texas.|$|E

Not only have global horizons expanded {{in the realm}} of work and study; global conflict and exploitation have resulted in forced migration.

Disabled migrants are a hidden population whose experiences are often overlooked or subsumed within wider debates around disability and ethnicity.

30|$|Humanitarian food {{assistance}} is obviously most {{needed in the}} southern parts of Somalia where up to three million <b>people</b> are <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>move</b> attempting to avoid the conflict. Although {{there have been many}} valiant attempts <b>on</b> <b>the</b> part of the NGO implementers to maintain permanent presences with the communities with whom they are engaged in southern Somalia, open conflict eventually engulfed most areas, and the NGOs have been forced to evacuate. I believe that currently, no NGO international staff can visit their project sites and just recently, the United Nations has suspended operations in much of southern Somalia. In fact, for the last number of years, the NGO presence in southern Somalia has been staffed primarily by Somali and Kenyan citizens. This staff does heroic work in a chaotic and dangerous environment, but their work has been limited as to what they can actually accomplish.|$|R
40|$|AbstractGlobal {{migration}} {{is a topic}} of utmost importance in psychological research. As over 200 million <b>people</b> are <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>move</b> across national borders, and many more within their own countries, the processes of these migrations must be examined from {{different points of view}} and from different geographical locations. The articles in this special journal issue pointedly illustrate the role of international, national, community, and individual factors that shape these migrations. One cross-cutting theme is the importance of studying how multiple levels of context affect immigrant and migrant experiences. All six contributions, collectively, enrich the often individual-centric psychological literature. Issues of resilience and spaces of resistance emerged as a second cross-cutting theme, pointing to new directions for acculturation research and intervention. The challenge of recognizing diversity within migrant communities and among migration patterns is a third cross-cutting theme essential to address as we work toward a more equal world in which people can more freely chose whether to stay or leave their homes...|$|R
50|$|Often the pilgrim wore on his hat or cloak a badge {{indicating}} his destination. Those {{going to}} Santiago de Compostela wore a scallop shell. Perhaps {{it was a}} reminder of the small boats in which many of them travelled. Perhaps it had a more practical use as a vessel used in baptism or a drinking vessel. At any rate, the scallop shell eventually became a sign of pilgrimage in general, a symbol of baptism, signifying new life. The pilgrims carried new ways of thinking and of doing things to places that were deeply isolated from the larger world. Pilgrims were <b>people</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>move,</b> people on the way to somewhere else. Like the pilgrims of old, Paulines are <b>people</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>move.</b> When they leave school, many of them go {{to other parts of the}} world, bringing with them new ways of thinking and new ways of doing things.

50|$|Evaporative cooling vests are {{typically}} submersed {{in water for}} around 3 - 5 minutes and lightly wrung out or blot dried.

The trees, under which they have been born and have played in infancy, flourish undisturbed; though, by cutting them down, they might open new streets, and put money in their pockets. In a word, the almighty dollar, that great object of universal devotion throughout our land, seems to have no genuine devotees in these peculiar villages; and unless some of its missionaries penetrate there, and erect banking houses and other pious shrines, there is no knowing how long the inhabitants may remain in their present state of contented poverty.|$|R

Dramatic images of killed children, human lines at European borders, and the chaos of refugee camps in neighbouring countries dominate news stories.
