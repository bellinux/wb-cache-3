5|$|I {{was just}} trying to make a point. I wanted to show people {{how easy it is to}} {{manipulate}} someone's voice. If I can do it with a clip I pulled off of TV, imagine what they are doing on records and during live performances. The entire industry has been so manipulated, because there's such an emphasis on perfection, so when something like this happens, it causes such a stir. I knew something had to have happened to make it jump so fast. It's wild how much the story's been twisted. It's just always been fun for me to manipulate artists, and make it sound crazy. It was just for a good laugh. It was a goof, just for fun. I do a lot of parodies on my YouTube channel, and it just so happens this one got a little out of hand. It was just what I've learned in school, and it's fun I could fool so many people and get away with it. A lot of people had a lot of laughs because of it, so why should I apologize? If you can't poke fun at yourself, I don't know what kind of <b>person</b> <b>you</b> <b>are.</b>|$|E
500|$|Several {{witnesses}} were LaRouche followers who testified under immunity from prosecution. A former fundraiser {{testified that he}} was told, [...] "No matter what the <b>person</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> talking to says, get the money. [...] If you are talking to an unemployed worker {{who says he has}} got to feed ... a dozen children, forget it. Get the money. Most of these people are immoral anyway. This is the most moral thing they have ever done is to give you money." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with The Daily Telegraph Madonna further explained her inspiration behind the song and stated that [...] " [...] a song most people who work can relate to. If part of your work is travelling, and the <b>person</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> with also works and travels, you find yourself separated a lot {{and it can be}} very frustrating, [...] I'm American and he [...] is British, and I have to come to America all the time. [...] Especially at the beginning of our relationship, that long-distance thing was very frustrating. I also think it's easier for people to say things from a distance; it's safer." ...|$|E

500|$|The main {{themes in}} the album, in Adams words are; [...] "searching for something". The lyrical meaning behind track number four, [...] "Oxygen" [...] is what a person needs in order to survive. In other words, [...] "The <b>person</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> with is giving you the air you breathe", and that people in general [...] "need each other 100%." [...] The album's first single, [...] "I Thought I'd Seen Everything" [...] is about keeping an open mind." [...] The theme of [...] "Broken Wings" [...] is about [...] "{{somebody}} who {{taught me how to}} fly", a metaphor which for [...] "putting your trust in somebody who can give you faith and the belief that you can succeed." [...] "Something to Believe In" [...] is based upon the affirmation of life and faith, while [...] "Walk on By" [...] warns the listener of distrustfulness. As with other albums, according to Adams, he likes to end the album with a melancholic song, such as [...] "Something to Believe In" [...] in 11, it's not the last track however. [...] "Flowers Gone Wild" [...] touches on the same theme as two songs he wrote in the early 1980s, [...] "Cover Girl" [...] and [...] "The Best Is Yet To Come", are based upon the murdered playboy bunny Dorothy Stratten. But also people with misplaced emotions and their unfulfilled needs, which are pushed forth by the media, which Adams says, leads people to lose their [...] "sense of decency". Adams explained further; [...] "It's a sort of new love affair with an old story, devouring our celebrities and leaving them when we are done." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{novel is}} written in the first-person, from Clay's perspective. Clay, who [...] "felt betrayed by Less Than Zero", uses Imperial Bedrooms to make a stand or a case for himself, though {{ultimately}} [...] "reveals himself to be far worse than the author of Less Than Zero ever began to hint at." [...] Clay still bears similarities to the earlier character in Less Than Zero; according to one reviewer, [...] "not all that much is changed. Clay is a cipher, an empty shell who is only able to approximate interactions and experiences through acts of sadism and exploitation." [...] He is also, in many ways, a new character, because {{the opening of the}} book presents that the Clay of Less Than Zero had merely been [...] "just a writer pretending to be him". When asked why he [...] "changed" [...] Clay from [...] "passive" [...] to [...] "guilty", Ellis explained he felt Clay's inaction in the original novel made him equally as guilty; it had [...] "always bothered" [...] Ellis that Clay didn't do anything to save the little girl being raped in the first novel. The Independent notes [...] "his passivity [...] has hardened into something far more culpable, and nefarious." [...] According to Ellis, [...] "In LA, over time, the real <b>person</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> ultimately comes out." [...] He also speculates [...] "maybe the fear turned him into a monster". Ellis remarks that he finds the developments in Clay [...] "so exciting". One reviewer summarized the character's development, [...] "The nascent narcissist of Less Than Zero... is now left in a [...] "dead end". The novel is Ellisdeeply pessimistic presentation of human nature as assailable... an unflinching study of evil." ...|$|E
2500|$|A jury at Manchester Crown Court {{took one}} hour to find 49-year-old Smith guilty of Bates' murder. Sentencing him to life imprisonment, the judge, Mr. Justice Sachs, {{recommended}} that Smith should serve a minimum term of 20 years. He stated: [...] "This {{has been a}} terrible case; a catalogue of depravity by one human being upon another. You are a highly dangerous <b>person.</b> <b>You</b> <b>are</b> an abuser of women and I intend, {{so far as it}} is in my power, that you will abuse no more." ...|$|E

"Nevertheless," [...] Lord Chelsford continued, eyeing me closely, [...] "in {{your own}} mind {{you know very well}} who that <b>person</b> <b>was.</b> <b>You</b> <b>are</b> a bad liar, Ducaine.
