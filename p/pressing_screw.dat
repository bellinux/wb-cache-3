In this paper, several hybrid robots have been reviewed and categorized according to their implemented locomotion system. The hybrid locomotion systems are caterpillar wall-pressed type, wheeled wall-pressed type and wheeled wall-pressing screw type. Each hybrid locomotion system is developed according to distinct design requirements for specific environment and might be not suitable for other application. The aim of this review is to highlight the current innovation of in-pipe robot for inspection. Based on the study, wall pressed type {{is the most popular}} main locomotion system in in-pipe robot development. Most of the prototypes are able to travel into branches with the same diameter as the pipe. Integration of caterpillar wheel gives more advantage in preventing motion singularity problem while surpassing branches. On the other hand, wheeled wall-pressed type provides advantage in high speed mobility. Wheeled wall <b>pressing</b> <b>screw</b> type gives the best navigation in curved pipe.

In addition, they avoid the food versus fuel argument as {{they are not a}} major food source in Europe. In spite of these benefits, macroalgae are not yet fully exploited as a biomass source for bioenergy or platform chemical production in Europe, with one issue being the high harvesting and processing costs. This paper considers the impact of mechanical pre-processing of Laminaria digitata combined with different drying techniques and the effect of these on downstream processing to bioethanol. Results show that mechanically <b>screw</b> <b>pressing</b> macroalgae does enhance conversion to ethanol, but only when the material contains low levels of storage carbohydrates. This occurs in freeze-dried and air-dried samples. The addition of a press aid in the mechanical pre-processing step increases ethanol yields per gramme macroalgae, but due to the presence of the unutilised press aid in the fermentation, ethanol yields were lower overall. The two main findings from this work were (1) simple mechanical processing of L. digitata provides homogenisation and pumpability of macroalgae without negatively affecting subsequent microbial conversion to ethanol.

This study investigated preparation of partially defatted peanut flours by extrusion, <b>screw</b> <b>pressing,</b> and use of the flours in breakfast cereal flakes. Release of oil by wet and dry extrusion was evaluated. Wet extrusion (using an Anderson International Company expander) was tried initially and abandoned in favor of dry extrusion (using an InstaPro International Company extruder). Thus, fewer samples of earlier product were observed. Dry extrusion, followed by <b>screw</b> <b>pressing</b> removed oil for a total recovery of 90. 6 % of the oil in peanut kernels. Press cakes prepared by dry extrusion had higher protein dispersibility index (PDI) than those made using wet extrusion. Trypsin inhibitor was quite stable to heat treatment, only 23 % was inactivated by dry extrusion and 26 % after <b>screw</b> <b>pressing.</b> Press cakes were roasted (166 'C for 8 min) to develop flavor. Press cakes were ground and evaluated as protein supplement in flakes. Corn cones, ground corn of particle size intermediate between meal and flour, were replaced with unroasted partially defatted peanut flour (PDPF) and roasted flour (R-PDPF) at 0 %, 10 %, 20 % and 30 % levels. The mixtures were extruded using a Wenger Manufacturing Company twin-screw extruder to produce collets. The collets were flaked, then roasted at 171 'C for 3 min. Flakes containing 30 % PDPF had 16 % protein. Increasing the peanut flour level decreased the product bulk density and hardness. Lightness and yellowness decreased as the peanut flour content increased. Water absorption (WAI) and water solubility (WSI) indices increased for flakes with addition of peanut flour. Bowl fife, the time for crispiness to disappear after soaking in milk, decreased with addition of peanut flour. Sensory evaluation was conducted for crispiness, color, flavor and overall acceptance using the 9 -point hedonic scale (I = dislike extremely, 9 like extremely). Peanut flavor was also evaluated (I = none, 9 = strong). Untrained sensory panelists (n = 48) evaluated 5 samples of flakes (O%, 10 %, 20 %, 30 % R-PDPF and 30 % PDPF) I min after addition of milk.

40|$|Soy protein {{products}} are gaining importance as {{ingredients in the}} food industry. A number of soybean meals have been investigated as starting materials {{for the production of}} soy protein ingredients. Hexane-extracted and flash-desolventized soybean meals, known as white flakes (WF), are most commonly used, but have disadvantages of containing solvent residue and being too expensive for processing identity-preserved soybeans. Gas-supported <b>screw</b> <b>pressing</b> (GSSP) is a new soybean oil-extraction process that combines <b>screw</b> <b>pressing</b> with injecting carbon dioxide (CO 2) under pressure. The objective of the present research was to investigate GSSP meal and its {{protein products}} by determining yields, composition, functional properties, preservation methods and sensory properties. The properties of GSSP meal proteins were compared to traditional soy protein products produced from WF. For the laboratory-scale study, analytical, chemical and functionality tests were performed on the starting materials and isolated soy proteins. Soy protein isolate (SPI) prepared from GSSP meal had higher protein yield, fat content, water-holding capacity (WHC) and viscosity, and better emulsification and fat-binding properties than SPIs prepared from WF. The SPIs produced in the pilot plant were analyzed for composition and functionality. Hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) treated SPIs were compared to jet-cooked SPIs. GSSP SPIs did not differ in functionality from SPIs prepared from WF, except for having lower solubility and poorer foaming properties. H 2 O 2 used as a preservative improved solubility, emulsification and foaming properties and reduced glycinin and β–conglycinin (β–con) denaturation. A descriptive sensory panel study with 12 trained panelists evaluated the aroma, flavor and mouthfeel of SPI and glycinin–rich (gly–rich) and β–conglycinin–rich (β–con–rich) soy protein fractions extracted from both GSSP meal and WF. Protein products prepared from GSSP meal were similar to protein products prepared from WF except for having greater mouthcoating. Regardless of starting material, the gly–rich and β–con–rich fractions had stronger fishy aroma, less floury aroma, less raw beany aroma and less floury flavor than the SPIs. Hunter color LAB data indicated GSSP meal was more yellow (higher b* value) in color compared to WF. SPIs were darker (lower L* value) than than the gly–rich and β –con–rich fractions. Overall, protein products prepared from GSSP meal were similar in composition, functional and sensory properties to protein products prepared from WF. These findings demonstrate that the GSSP process can produce defatted meals suitable for manufacturing soy protein ingredients. Because GSSP plants can be profitable at low capacity (50 mt/day) compared to solvent extraction (3000 mt/day), GSSP is suitable for processing identitypreserved soybeans that contain value-added traits. Additional benefits are that there are no concerns over residual organic solvents and the process complies with “organic“ definitions...|$|R

In order to achieve stronger attachment to the implantation site, hooks using screws for additional fixation have been developed. The failure loads and mechanisms of three such devices have been experimentally determined on human thoracic vertebrae: the Universal Spine System (USS) pedicle hook with one screw, a prototype pedicle hook with two screws and the Cotrel-Dubousset (CD) pedicle hook with screw. The USS hooks use 3. 2 -mm self-tapping fixation screws which pass into the pedicle, whereas the CD hook is stabilised with a 3 -mm set <b>screw</b> <b>pressing</b> against the superior part of the facet joint. A clinically established 5 -mm pedicle screw was tested for comparison. A matched pair experimental design was implemented to evaluate these implants in constrained (series I) and rotationally unconstrained (series II) posterior pull-out tests. In the constrained tests the pedicle screw was the strongest implant, with an average pull-out force of 1650 N (SD 623 N). The prototype hook was comparable, with an average failure load of 1530 N (SD 414 N). The average pull-out force of the USS hook with one screw was 910 N (SD 243 N), not significantly different to the CD hook's average failure load of 740 N (SD 189 N). The result of the unconstrained tests were similar, with the prototype hook being the strongest device (average 1617 N, SD 652 N). However, in this series the difference in failure load between the USS hook with one screw and the CD hook was significant. Average failure loads of 792 N (SD 184 N) for the USS hook and 464 N (SD 279 N) for the CD hook were measured. A pedicular fracture in {{the plane of the}} fixation screw was the most common failure mode for USS hooks. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A {{small scale}} {{sugarcane}} juice extractor using a <b>screw</b> <b>pressing</b> system was designed, constructed and tested. Consideration {{was given to}} the techno-economic status of the micro and small scale sugarcane farmers and juice processors who are the intended users of the machine. The functional parts of the machine included grating unit, extraction unit, prime mover, pulley, transmission belts, bearings and frame. The machine was tested with two varieties of sugarcane each at three levels of moisture content and results showed that average grating efficiency and juice yield of 87. 8 % and 2. 5 % respectively were obtained. Powered by a 3 hp single-phase electric motor, the machine was constructed with materials being available locally at affordable costs. A cottage sugarcane juice extraction plant based on this technology could provide employment {{and at the same time}} produce sugarcane juice and bagasse at low costs for sugar and biofuel industries. An improvement in the design, analysis and optimization of the worm shaft and press cage is expected to improve the juice yield and extraction efficiency; hence, this is highly recommended.

40|$|Doutoramento em Engenharia dos Biossistemas - Instituto Superior de Agronomia - ULJatropha curcas L. is a {{tropical}} shrub, {{belonging to the}} Euphorbiaceae family, well adapted to marginal lands, not competing for arable land and food chain. The seeds are rich in non-edible oil, suitable for biodiesel production. In this work, variation in oil content and composition of Jatropha seeds from 12 origins, grown in Mozambique under the same edapho-climatic and agronomic conditions, was assessed. Oil contents varied from 37 %- 45 % (d. w.). The major fatty acids identified in Jatropha oil were oleic (41. 1 %) and linoleic acids (38. 8 %). The oil presented low acidity {{and low levels of}} oxidation products, proving adequate for biodiesel production. Also high levels of gamma-tocopherol were found (69 - 182 mg/kg). The presence of this antioxidant may explain the high oxidative stability presented by the oil during the storage tests performed under controlled humidity and temperature, simulating tropical climate conditions. Conversely, seeds storage under the same conditions promoted the growth of fungi responsible for oil degradation. Therefore, it is better to extract the oil and store it in closed containers, than to store the seeds. Dry conditioning of seeds to be extracted by <b>screw</b> <b>pressing</b> was optimized via Response Surface Methodology (RSM). The highest extraction oil yields (88 %, w/w) were obtained with seeds dried at higher temperatures for shorter periods of time (e. g., 90 ◦C/ 10 - 20 min; 80 ◦C/ 30 min) or at lower temperatures {{for longer periods of time}} (e. g., 60 ◦C/ 50 - 60 min). RSM was also applied for the optimization of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME, biodiesel) production from Jatropha oil, using sodium methoxide as catalyst. Finally, the feasibility of enzymatic production of Jatropha FAME, using recombinant sn- 1 (3) -regioselective Rhizopus oryzae lipase and Carica papaya lipase and Candida parapsilosis lipase/acyltransferase, immobilized on different synthetic resins, was evaluated. All biocatalysts proved to be efficient and environmentally friendly alternatives to the conventional chemical process...|$|R
40|$|To realise {{an economy}} {{inverter}} construction, it {{is a good}} solution to use high reliable and flexible mounting technologies with a lot of automated steps like Printed Circuit Board (PCB) technology for all components. This is valid specially for all power elements e. g. rectifiers, inverters and brakes. Now this problem is solved with the completion of the „Economodule-Productfamily “ offered from Siemens HL and eupec. Some extra marginal conditions like the thermal management in- and outside of the module and on the PCB have to be observed. The results of these points, which have been simulated, calculated and tested, e. g. about current capability of thickwire bonds are of great interest, because of all intern module connections are made in this flexible technology. 1. The Econo-Mounting-Technology Inside a power converter, e. g. for motor control applications, electrical high and low power connections between the sources, the DC link, the control circuits (e. g. for IGBTs) and the drives have to be realised. Up to now different mounting technologies like soldering, <b>screwing,</b> <b>pressing</b> or gluing has to be used. Often the needed parts are not adapted in dimensions or thermal demands so that extra mechanical and thermal constructions are necessary. But now a high economy converter concept is available, because Siemens HL and eupec completed their Economodule-Productfamily. So inside of three package outlines called Econo 1, 2 and 3 different combinations of rectifier diodes and IGBTs with or without parallel or serial fast diodes for a wide power range are offered. Figure 1 shows the principal construction of the Econo-modules. On top of a baseplate, a both side copper plated ceramic with good thermal conductivity and good isolation features is soldered. On the topsight of this metalled ceramic, whose copperplates are structured, the chips are fixed. The plastic-frame of the module includes several terminals with bonding areas in the inner and solderable pins at the outer parts of the module. The chips are bonded with the copper-structure and th...|$|R
40|$|Using {{diffraction}} {{x-ray tubes}} (2 kW) as the excitation source in Total Reflection X-ray Fluorescence Analysis (TXRF) results in less photon flux on the sample {{compared to the}} excitation with rotating anode tubes (18 kW) or synchrotron radiation. An efficient way of increasing the photon flux on the sample is the insertion of x-ray optical elements in the primary beam path. In this experiment a mechanically bent W/C multilayer monochromator on a Sisubstrate of 0. 5 mm thickness was used, leading {{to an increase in}} intensity of a factor 2 to 3 (comparable to a 4 or 6 kW x-ray tube). A flat multilayer monochromator offers the advantage of a reduction in spectral background {{due to the fact that}} only monoenergetic photons arrive on the sample to cause scattered radiation but it leads to losses in intensity because of the sharp angular acceptance of the Bragg equation. The basic idea is that the bending curve approaches a logarithmic spiral having a constant angle between the radius of the spiral and the respective tangent at each point. This curvature was achieved by fixing one end of the 70 mm long multilayer mechanically tight. In a distance of 40 mm of the remaining length the bending was performed by applying a transversal force and a torque on this free end of the multilayer. This was done by one micrometer <b>screw</b> <b>pressing</b> against the rear side of the multilayer and by a second micrometer producing the torque by means of a simple lever acting at the free end of the multilayer. The result of bending is a large angular acceptance to fulfill the Bragg equation. The calculations leading to values for the mechanical force and torque involved to produce the curvature as well as the scheme of the experimental set-up and spectra comparing the effects of bending the multilayer with the straight multilayer are presented.

40|$|The {{availability}} of organic animal feed for monogastric animals and organic fertilizer {{is in many}} regions a limiting factor for the further spread of animal breeding and crop cultivation in organic farming. The production of these two commodities is the main target of a green biorefinery concept based on regionally organically grown grass biomass, called Organofinery. Anaerobic digestion of the residual streams after protein separation for the organic feed product is a key process to extract both the energetic and the nutritional value of the residual biomass in the biorefinery. Biogas potentials of the residual streams from the processing of red clover and clover grass (press cake obtained from <b>screw</b> <b>pressing</b> to produce green juice and brown juice after precipitation of protein concentrate from the green juice) where determined in batch and reactor experiments and a mass balance of the nutrients was established based on analysis of N, P, K, and S from the different process stages of the concept. The AD process was tested in lab-scale both as co-digestion of press cake and brown juice in a continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) and of the brown juice alone in an up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor. Both reactor processes showed stable performance without signs of inhibition or nutrient deficiency. The methane yields, the nutritional value of the digestates from these experiments {{as well as the}} mass balances for the whole process will be presented. In mesophilic co-digestion (50 : 50 ratio based on VS) of press cake and brown juice from red clover at 20 d hydraulic retention time (HRT) methane yields of 237 to 283 L-CH 4 /kg-VS were achieved while mesophilic treatment of brown juice from clover grass in the high-rate reactor yielded on average 202 L-CH 4 /kg-VS at 3 days HRT. For red clover, concentrations of N, P, K and S were 5. 07, 0. 45, 4. 58, and 0. 25 g/-kg-biomass, respectively while the values for these nutrients were 2. 97, 0. 40, 5. 51, and 0. 23 g/-kg-biomass for clover grass.
