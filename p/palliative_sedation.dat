50|$|<b>Palliative</b> <b>sedation</b> {{is often}} {{initiated}} at the patient's request. It {{can also be}} initiated by the physician who would discuss the option with the patient and family. <b>Palliative</b> <b>sedation</b> {{can be used for}} short periods with the plan to awaken the patient after a given time period, making terminal sedation a less correct term. The patient is sedated while symptom control is attempted, then the patient is awakened to see if symptom control is achieved. In some cases, <b>palliative</b> <b>sedation</b> is begun with the plan to not attempt to reawaken the patient. One such common example is a patient with an enlarging cancer in the throat that compresses the trachea in a patient who does not want intubation or a tracheostomy, so that eventually symptom control is impossible. Instead of experiencing death by suffocation, once symptoms are intolerable some patients will request <b>palliative</b> <b>sedation</b> to ease their symptoms as death approaches.|$|E

50|$|In medicine, {{specifically}} in end-of-life care, <b>palliative</b> <b>sedation</b> (also known as terminal sedation, continuous deep sedation, or sedation for intractable distress in the dying/of a dying patient) is the palliative practice of relieving distress in a terminally ill {{person in the}} last hours or days of a dying patient's life, usually {{by means of a}} continuous intravenous or subcutaneous infusion of a sedative drug, or by means of a specialized catheter designed to provide comfortable and discreet administration of ongoing medications via the rectal route. <b>Palliative</b> <b>sedation</b> is an option of last resort for patients whose symptoms cannot be controlled by any other means. It is not a form of euthanasia, as the goal of <b>palliative</b> <b>sedation</b> is to control symptoms, rather than to shorten the patient's life.|$|E

40|$|Holistic Medicine traces its {{provenance}} to {{the foundational}} value or chrism of the Society of Jesus of cura personalis which directs respect {{be given to}} all individuals and to their souls — especially whenever medical healing is required. Today, the notion of best patient care should include not merely attention to somatic issues of refractory pain management but, equally, to non-somatic or existential suffering. It is at the end-stage of life that palliative — as opposed to curative — care must be provided. When a condition is seen as medically futile, this Article advocates <b>palliative</b> or deep <b>sedation</b> — when consistent with patient values — should be accepted more fully as efficacious and humane end-of-life medical care. Roman Catholic moral theology supports the ideal that extraordinary medical measures need not be provided {{in order to preserve}} life at its endstage.

40|$|A brief {{analysis}} {{of the most significant}} provisions of the new Italian Code of medical ethics reveals the centrality of the ethical principles of beneficence, respect of autonomy, proportionality of care in the doctor – patient relationship. In general, the application of these principles results in particular attention to promote the wellbeing and {{the quality of life of}} the patient, taken as a whole in his/ her global dimension as a ‘person’. This is explicitly stated in Section 3 of the Code according to which duties of the physician are the protection of life and psycho-physical health, the treatment of pain, and the relief of suffering, respecting the freedom and the dignity of the person. The Authors therefore intend to analyse the new provisions of the Code, concerning the assistance to terminal patients and designed to establish specific rules of behavior, e. g. the avoidance of diagnostic procedures and therapeutic interventions not proportionate to the effective condition of the patient (Section 16), the prohibition of acts intended to cause thepatient’s death (Section 17), the use of <b>palliative</b> care, pain <b>sedation,</b> and relief of suffering (Section 39). These provisions reflect a concept of protection of health which includes including all measures directed to achieve the best mental and physical balance in terminally ill patients, respectful of the dignity and therefore of the wishes freely expressed by the individual regarding his/ her treatments (Section 38). In assessing the moral significance of the very complex concept of quality of life, the Authors also intend to probe its direct bearings on the ethics of the healing practices and the medical profession...|$|R

40|$|Currently, {{very few}} {{guidelines}} for supportive {{care for children}} with cancer exist. In the Netherlands, nationwide guidelines are over 10 years old and mostly based on expert opinion. Consequently, there is growing support and need for clinical practice guidelines (CPGs), which ought to be developed with a well-defined methodology and include a systematic search of literature, evidence summaries, and a transparent description of the decision process for the final recommendations. Development of CPGs is time consuming; therefore, {{it is important to}} prioritize topics for which there is the greatest clinical demand. This study aims to prioritize childhood cancer supportive care topics for development of CPGs. A Delphi survey consisting of two rounds was conducted to prioritize relevant childhood cancer supportive care topics for the development of CPGs. A group of experts comprising 15 pediatric oncologists, 15 pediatric oncology nurses, and 15 general pediatricians involved in care for childhood cancer patients were invited to participate. All relevant supportive care topics in childhood cancer were rated. In both rounds, 36 panellists (82 %) responded. Agreement between panellists was very good, with an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0. 918 (95 % confidence interval (CI) [*]=[*] 0. 849 - 0. 966, p[*] <[*] 0. 001) in round 2. The ten topics with the highest score in the final round were infection, sepsis, febrile neutropenia, pain, nausea/vomiting, restrictions in daily life and activities, <b>palliative</b> care, procedural <b>sedation,</b> terminal care, and oral mucositis. We successfully used a Delphi survey to prioritize childhood cancer supportive care topics for the development of CPGs. This is a first step towards uniform and evidence-based Dutch guidelines in supportive care in childhood cancer. Even though performed nationally, we believe that this study can also be regarded as an example starting point for international development of CPGs in the field of supportive care in cancer or any other field for that matte...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{administration}} of sedatives in {{terminally ill patients}} becomes an increasingly feasible medical option in end-of-life care. However, sedation for intractable distress has raised considerable medical and ethical concerns. In our study we provide a critical analysis of seven years experience with the application of sedation in {{the final phase of}} life in our palliative care unit. Methods Medical records of 548 patients, who died in the Palliative Care Unit of GK Havelhoehe between 1995 – 2002, were retrospectively analysed with regard to sedation in the last 48 hrs of life. The parameters of investigation included indication, choice and kind of sedation, prevalence of intolerable symptoms, patients' requests for sedation, state of consciousness and communication abilities during sedation. Critical evaluation included a comparison of the period between 1995 – 1999 and 2000 – 2002. Results 14. 6 % (n = 80) of the patients in <b>palliative</b> care had <b>sedation</b> given by the intravenous route in the last 48 hrs of their life according to internal guidelines. The annual frequency to apply sedation increased continuously from 7 % in 1995 to 19 % in 2002. Main indications shifted from refractory control of physical symptoms (dyspnoea, gastrointestinal, pain, bleeding and agitated delirium) to more psychological distress (panic-stricken fear, severe depression, refractory insomnia and other forms of affective decompensation). Patients' and relatives' requests for sedation in the final phase were significantly more frequent during the period 2000 – 2002. Conclusion Sedation in the terminal or final phase of life plays an increasing role in the management of intractable physical and psychological distress. Ethical concerns are raised by patients' requests and needs on the one hand, and the physicians' self-understanding on the other hand. Hence, ethically acceptable criteria and guidelines for the decision making are needed with special regard to the nature of refractory and intolerable symptoms, patients' informed consent and personal needs, the goals and aims of medical sedation in end-of-life care. </p...|$|R

50|$|In {{the context}} of health, social death—when the ailing person {{no longer has the}} {{consciousness}} to communicate with others—can occur. Social death occurs during the progression of Alzheimer's disease and to patients rendered unconscious through <b>palliative</b> <b>sedation</b> (a type of end-of-life care) to reduce pain before an imminent death.Employees who retire from their careers can experience another example of social death because of their removal from the daily work lives of co-workers.|$|E
50|$|As {{patients}} undergoing terminal sedation {{are typically}} {{in the last}} hours or days of their lives, they are not usually eating or drinking significant amounts. There have not been any conclusive studies to demonstrate benefit to initiating artificial nutrition (TPN, tube feedings, etc.) or artificial hydration (subcutaneous or intravenous fluids). There is also the risk that IV fluids or feedings can worsen symptoms, especially respiratory secretions and pulmonary congestion. If the goal of <b>palliative</b> <b>sedation</b> is comfort, IV fluids and feedings are often not consistent with this goal.|$|E
50|$|Its {{relative}} effectiveness in preventing new memory formation, {{along with its}} ability to reduce agitation and anxiety, makes lorazepam useful as premedication. It is given before a general anesthetic {{to reduce the amount}} of anesthetic required, or before unpleasant awake procedures, such as in dentistry or endoscopies, to reduce anxiety, to increase compliance, and to induce amnesia for the procedure. Lorazepam by mouth is given 90 to 120 minutes before procedures, and intravenous lorazepam as late as 10 minutes before procedures. Lorazepam is sometimes used as an alternative to midazolam in <b>palliative</b> <b>sedation.</b> In intensive care units lorazepam is sometimes used to produce anxiolysis, hypnosis, and amnesia.|$|E

40|$|Background: Little {{is known}} about the {{quantity}} and reasons for use of <b>palliative</b> <b>sedation</b> in cancer patients in general practice and the reason to apply <b>palliative</b> <b>sedation</b> when a request for euthanasia was pending. Aim: To gain more insight into the reasons for <b>palliative</b> <b>sedation</b> at the end of life, also when a request for euthanasia was pending in cancer patients in Dutch general practice. Design and setting: Dynamic cohort study using registrations and questionnaire data of Dutch GPs. Method: Trends and reasons for use of <b>palliative</b> <b>sedation</b> in cancer patients were analysed using multilevel analyses in the years from 2005 until 2014 in the Sentinel Practices of NIVEL Primary Care database. Results: From 2005 – 2014, 220 cancer cases dying after <b>palliative</b> <b>sedation</b> were reported from 62 general practices. The incidence of <b>palliative</b> <b>sedation</b> increased in 2014 threefold compared to the nine years before (P 75 years, 87 %) than in the group < 75 years of age (94 %, P < 0. 05). Pending euthanasia requests were present in 20 % of cases; the choice for <b>palliative</b> <b>sedation</b> in these cases was: rapid progression of the disease and/or short life expectancy (55 %), preference of patient and/or relatives (23 %), adequate communication impossible (17 %).

40|$|TO THE EDITOR: We {{read with}} great {{interest}} the article by Quill and colleagues (1), which presented and discussed 3 categories of pallia-tive sedation: ordinary sedation, proportionate <b>palliative</b> <b>sedation</b> (PPS), and <b>palliative</b> <b>sedation</b> to unconsciousness (PSU). One notion shared by these practices, and by all attempts to justify sedation, is {{that the degree of}} sedation should match the symptoms— proportionality. The prominence of proportionality in this and other discussions of <b>palliative</b> <b>sedation</b> suggests a simpler and ethically clearer classifi-cation. Instead of “ordinary, ” “proportionate, ” and “unconscious” sedation, we suggest that all <b>palliative</b> <b>sedation</b> be classified as PPS. This is not a confusion of types of <b>palliative</b> <b>sedation,</b> as Quill and colleagues suggest, but a helpful reconception. Under the notion of proportionality, all types of <b>palliative</b> <b>sedation</b> are given only to the extent demanded by symptoms. Low demands imply minimal seda...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: <b>Palliative</b> <b>sedation</b> is {{considered}} a normal medical practice by the Royal Dutch Medical Association. Therefore, consultation of an expert is not considered mandatory. The European Association of Palliative Care (EAPC) framework for <b>palliative</b> <b>sedation,</b> however, is more stringent: it considers the use of <b>palliative</b> <b>sedation</b> without consulting an expert as injudicious and insists on input from a multi-professional palliative care team. This study investigates the considerations of Dutch physicians concerning consultation about <b>palliative</b> <b>sedation</b> with specialist palliative care services. Methods: Fifty-four physicians were interviewed on their most recent case of <b>palliative</b> <b>sedation.</b> Results: Reasons to consult were a lack of expertise and the view that consultation was generally supportive. Reasons not to consult were sufficient expertise, the view that <b>palliative</b> <b>sedation</b> is a normal medical procedure, time pressure, fear of disagreement with the service and regarding consultation as having little added value. Arguments in favour of mandatory consultation were that many physicians lack expertise and that <b>palliative</b> <b>sedation</b> is an exceptional intervention. Arguments against mandatory consultation were practical obstacles that may preclude fulfilling such an obligation (i. e. lack of time), <b>palliative</b> <b>sedation</b> being a standard medical procedure, corroding a physician's responsibility and deterring physicians from applying <b>palliative</b> <b>sedation.</b> Conclusion: Consultation about <b>palliative</b> <b>sedation</b> with specialist palliative care services is regarded as supportive and helpful when physicians lack expertise. However, Dutch physicians have both practical and theoretical objections against mandatory consultation. Based on the findings in this study, {{there seems to be}} little support among Dutch physicians for the EAPC recommendations on obligatory consultation. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|E
40|$|Aim. This {{paper is}} a report of a {{nationwide}} study conducted to assess experiences of nurses involved in <b>palliative</b> <b>sedation</b> at home after introduction of a physicians' guideline for <b>palliative</b> <b>sedation.</b> Background. Most studies investigating the practice of <b>palliative</b> <b>sedation</b> focus on physicians' practices and attitudes. However, {{little is known about}} experiences and attitudes of nurses. Methods. A web-based structured questionnaire was offered to 387 nurses providing medical technical care in 2007, assessing their experiences concerning decision-making, treatment policy and communication, focussing on the last patient receiving <b>palliative</b> <b>sedation.</b> Results. The questionnaire was filled out by 201 nurses (response rate 52 %). The majority of respondents agreed with the indication for <b>palliative</b> <b>sedation.</b> However, 21 % reported to have refused carrying out a <b>palliative</b> <b>sedation</b> in the preceding year. The general practitioner was not present at the start of <b>palliative</b> <b>sedation</b> in a third of the cases, but was available when needed. The sedation was considered insufficiently effective by 42 % of the respondents. According to a third of the respondents, the level of sedation was not related to the required level of symptom relief nor were changes in dosage based on the severity of symptoms. Conclusion. Although the guideline for <b>palliative</b> <b>sedation</b> appears to be followed adequately in the majority of cases with respect to indication for <b>palliative</b> <b>sedation</b> and reportage. The survey findings revealed shortcomings in medication policy, communication, medical control over the start and continued monitoring of <b>palliative</b> <b>sedation.</b> © 2011 The Authors.

40|$|Context: Continuous <b>palliative</b> <b>sedation</b> {{has been}} the focus of {{extensive}} international debates in the field of end-of-life decision making. Although nurses may be important participants in the performance of continuous <b>palliative</b> <b>sedation,</b> research has focused primarily on the role and experience of physicians. Nurses' experiences differ from that of physicians; they more often describe that continuous <b>palliative</b> <b>sedation</b> is used with the intention of hastening death and to have experienced serious emotional burden. Therefore, it is important to understand the experience of nurses in continuous <b>palliative</b> <b>sedation.</b> Objective: To describe nurses' experiences with the decision-making and performance of continuous <b>palliative</b> <b>sedation</b> in terminally ill patients. Methods: Cross-sectional study. In 2008, a structured questionnaire was sent to 576 nurses in six professional home care organizations, ten units for palliative care in nursing homes and in-patient hospices and seven hospitals in the western region of the Netherlands. Respondents provided information about the last patient receiving continuous <b>palliative</b> <b>sedation</b> whom they had cared for. Results: Two-hundred seventy-seven questionnaires were returned and 199 (71. 84 %) reported a case of continuous <b>palliative</b> <b>sedation.</b> Nurses felt involved in the decision to use sedation in 84 % of cases, albeit to a lesser extent in home care (68. 75 %, p= 0. 002). They agreed with the performance of continuous <b>palliative</b> <b>sedation</b> in 95. 97 % of cases and they proposed the use of continuous <b>palliative</b> <b>sedation</b> in 16. 16 %. Nurses were present at the start of sedation in 81. 40 % of cases and reported physicians to be present in 45. 22 %. In 72. 77 %, arrangements had been made among caregivers about the coordination of health care regarding the sedation. Conclusion: Nurses seem to play an important role in the use of continuous sedation. This role is mainly supportive toward physicians and patients during the decision-making process, but shifts to an active performance of sedation, particularly in settings where they explicitly participate as members of a team. Nurses could develop the practice of <b>palliative</b> <b>sedation</b> by anticipating procedural obstacles in the performance of continuous <b>palliative</b> <b>sedation.</b> We recommend them to become more active participants in the decision-making to improve the care of patients receiving continuous <b>palliative</b> <b>sedation.</b> © 2012 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: <b>Palliative</b> <b>sedation,</b> the {{intentional}} {{lowering of consciousness}} for refractory and unbearable distress, has been much discussed during the last decade. In recent years, much research has been published about this subject that {{will be discussed in}} this review. The review concentrates on: a brief overview of the main developments during the last decade, an exploration of current debate regarding ethical dilemmas, the development of clinical guidelines, and the application of <b>palliative</b> <b>sedation.</b> RECENT FINDINGS: Main findings are that <b>palliative</b> <b>sedation</b> is mostly described in retrospective studies and that the terminology <b>palliative</b> <b>sedation</b> in now common in the majority of the studies. In addition, life-shortening effects for <b>palliative</b> <b>sedation</b> are scarcely reported, although not absent. A number of guidelines have been developed and published, although systematic implementation needs more attention. Consequently, <b>palliative</b> <b>sedation</b> has become more clearly positioned as a medical treatment, to be distinguished from active life shortening. SUMMARY: Caregivers should apply <b>palliative</b> <b>sedation</b> proportionally, guided by the symptoms of the patient without striving for deep coma and without motives for life shortening. Clinical and multidisciplinary assessment of refractory symptoms is recommended as is patient monitoring during sedation. Future research should concentrate on proportional sedation rather than continuous deep sedation exclusively, preferably in a prospective design...|$|E
40|$|In December 2005 {{the first}} {{national}} guideline for <b>palliative</b> <b>sedation</b> in the Netherlands was published.

Method: Data collected in the years from 2005 until 2011 in the Dutch Sentinel General Practice Network were analyzed. Trends and reasons for use of <b>palliative</b> <b>sedation</b> were analyzed using multilevel analyses to control for clustering of observations within general practices. Results: From 2005 - 2011, 183 cases were reported from 56 general practices. The incidence of <b>palliative</b> <b>sedation</b> fluctuated between 33. 7 per 100, 000 patients in 2006 and 15. 2 in 2011. No rise or decline during the period was observed. <b>Palliative</b> <b>sedation</b> was applied in 5. 7 % of all deaths and most frequently used in younger patients with cancer. The mean number of refractory symptoms was 2. 6 (SD 1. 2); pain (69. 4 %), dyspnoea (53. 0 %) and fear (39. 3 %).

Conclusion: <b>Palliative</b> <b>sedation</b> is performed in a small proportion of dying patients in Dutch general practice, without a rise or decline observed from 2005 to 2011. Patients with non-cancer diseases are less frequently involved in decision making than patients with cancer, possibly related to sudden deterioration. (aut. ref. ...|$|E
40|$|Background: Patients {{suffering}} from a terminal illness often are confronted with severe symptoms during the last phase of their lives. <b>Palliative</b> <b>sedation,</b> although one of the options of last resort, remains a much debated and controversial issue and {{is often referred to}} as a form of slow euthanasia or euthanasia in disguise. METHODS: A prospective longitudinal and descriptive design was used. Each patient admitted in one of the 8 participating units was included if they met the inclusion criteria and gave written informed consent. RESULTS: 266 patients were included. The incidence of <b>palliative</b> <b>sedation</b> was 7; 5 %. For the group of sedated patients results show that 90 % entered the palliative care unit being fully conscious. Two patients were comatose upon arrival. 90 % of the patients remained fully conscious up to the day <b>palliative</b> <b>sedation</b> was started. When looking at the effect of <b>palliative</b> <b>sedation</b> on the level of consciousness the analysis strongly suggest that the <b>palliative</b> <b>sedation</b> - as expected- has an impact on the GCS score. Irrespective of the dichotomization of the score the probability of having a lower GCS increases substantially once sedation is initiated. Additionally, results show that once <b>palliative</b> <b>sedation</b> is administered, the level of consciousness gradually goes down up until the day of death. Conclusion: <b>Palliative</b> <b>sedation</b> is nor slow euthanasia nor an ambivalent practice. It is an intentional medical treatment which is administered in a proportional way when refractory suffering occurs. It occurs in extraordinary situations and at the very end of the dying process. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{critically}} discuss some of the ethically controversial issues regarding continuous deep <b>palliative</b> <b>sedation</b> at the end of life that are addressed in the EAPC recommended framework for the use of sedation in palliative care. Discussion We argue that the EAPC framework would have benefited from taking a clearer stand on the ethically controversial issues regarding intolerable suffering and refractory symptoms and regarding the relation between continuous deep <b>palliative</b> <b>sedation</b> at the end of life and euthanasia. It is unclear what constitutes refractory symptoms and what the relationship is between refractory symptoms and intolerable suffering, which in turn makes it difficult to determine what are necessary and sufficient criteria for <b>palliative</b> <b>sedation</b> at the end of life, and why. As regards the difference between <b>palliative</b> <b>sedation</b> at the end of life and so-called slow euthanasia, the rationale behind stressing the difference is insufficiently demonstrated, e. g. due to an overlooked ambiguity in the concept of intention. It is therefore unclear when <b>palliative</b> <b>sedation</b> at the end of life amounts to abuse and why. Conclusions The EAPC framework would have benefited from taking a clearer stand on some ethically controversial issues regarding intolerable suffering and refractory symptoms and regarding the relation between continuous deep <b>palliative</b> <b>sedation</b> at the end of life and euthanasia. In this text, we identify and discuss these issues in the hope that an ensuing discussion will clarify the EAPC's standpoint. </p...|$|E

40|$|<b>Palliative</b> <b>sedation</b> is {{an option}} of last resort to control {{refractory}} suffering. In order to better understand palliative-care nurses’ attitudes to <b>palliative</b> <b>sedation,</b> an anonymous questionnaire was sent to all nurses (589) employed in palliative care in Flanders (Belgium). In all, 70. 5 % of the nurses (n= 415) responded. A large majority did not agree that euthanasia is preferable to <b>palliative</b> <b>sedation,</b> were against non-voluntary euthanasia {{in the case of}} a deeply and continuously sedated patient and considered it generally better not to administer artificial floods or fluids to such a patient. Two clusters were found: 58. 5 % belonged to the cluster of advocates of deep and continuous sedation and 41. 5 % belonged to the cluster of nurses restricting the application of deep and continuous sedation. These differences notwithstanding, overall the attitudes of the nurses are in accordance with the practice and policy of <b>palliative</b> <b>sedation</b> in Flemish palliative-care units. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: <b>Palliative</b> <b>sedation</b> is {{a symptom}} {{management}} method frequently used in hospices to treat uncontrolled symptoms {{at the end of}} life. There is a substantial literature on this subject however there has been little research into the experiences of hospice nurses when administering <b>palliative</b> <b>sedation</b> as a symptom measure for terminal restlessness experienced by cancer patients. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a purposive sample of seven hospice nurses who had cared for at least one patient who had undergone <b>palliative</b> <b>sedation</b> within the past year in a hospice in the South of England in the UK. A phenomenological approach and Colaizzi’s stages of analysis were used to develop themes from the data. Results: Facilitating a ‘peaceful death’ was the primary goal of the nurses where, through the administration of <b>palliative</b> <b>sedation,</b> they sought to enable and support patients to be: ‘comfortable’; ‘relaxed’; and ‘calm’ at the terminal stage of their illness. Ethical dilemmas related to decision making were a factor in achieving this. These were: medication decisions, ‘juggling the drugs’; ‘causing the death’; sedating young people; family ‘requesting’ sedation and believing hospice was a place where death is hastened. Significance of results: In UK hospices nurses frequently encountered ethical and emotional dilemmas when administering <b>palliative</b> <b>sedation.</b> Making such decisions about using <b>palliative</b> <b>sedation</b> caused general discomfort for the nurses. Undertaking this aspect of care requires confidence and competence {{on the part of the}} nurses and working within a supportive hospice team is of fundamental importance to supporting this practice.
