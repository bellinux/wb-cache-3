5|$|The mineral {{crocoite}} (lead chromate PbCrO4) {{was used}} as a yellow pigment shortly after its discovery. After a synthesis method became available starting from the more abundant chromite, chrome yellow was, together with cadmium yellow, one of the most used yellow pigments. The pigment does not photodegrade, but it tends to darken due to the formation of chromium(III) oxide. It has a strong color, and was used for school buses in the US and for Postal Service (for example Deutsche Post) in Europe. The use of chrome yellow declined due to environmental and safety concerns and was replaced by organic pigments or alternatives free from lead and chromium. Other pigments based on chromium are, for example, the bright red pigment chrome red, which is a basic lead chromate (PbCrO4·Pb(OH)2). A very important chromate pigment, which was used widely in metal primer formulations, was zinc chromate, now replaced by zinc phosphate. A wash primer was formulated to replace the dangerous practice of pretreating aluminium aircraft bodies with a phosphoric acid solution. This used zinc tetroxychromate dispersed in a solution of <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>butyral.</b> An 8% solution of phosphoric acid in solvent was added just before application. It was found that an easily oxidized alcohol was an essential ingredient. A thin layer of about 10–15µm was applied, which turned from yellow to dark green when it was cured. There is still a question as to the correct mechanism. Chrome green is a mixture of Prussian blue and chrome yellow, while the chrome oxide green is chromium(III) oxide.|$|E

50|$|Modern {{laminated}} glass {{is produced by}} bonding two or more layers of ordinary annealed glass (or tempered glass) together with a plastic interlayer, usually <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>butyral</b> or ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA). The PVB or the EVA are sandwiched by the glass, which is either passed {{through a series of}} rollers, or vacuum bagging systems, and ovens, or autoclaves, to expel any air pockets. Then it is heated to form the initial melting. These constructions are then heated under pressure in an autoclave or oven, to achieve the final bounded product(fully crosslinked {{in the case of the}} thermoset EVA). The tint at the top of some car windshields is in the PVB. Also, colored PET films can be combined with the thermoset EVA material, during the laminating process, in order to obtain a colored glass.|$|E
50|$|This {{principle}} generalizes {{to other}} classes of material. Naturally brittle materials, such as glass, are {{not difficult to}} toughen effectively. Most such techniques involve one of two mechanisms: to deflect or absorb {{the tip of a}} propagating crack, or to create carefully controlled residual stresses so that cracks from certain predictable sources will be forced closed. The first principle is used in laminated glass where two sheets of glass are separated by an interlayer of <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>butyral,</b> which as a viscoelastic polymer absorbs the growing crack. The second method is used in toughened glass and pre-stressed concrete. A demonstration of glass toughening is provided by Prince Rupert's Drop. Brittle polymers can be toughened by using metal particles to initiate crazes when a sample is stressed, a good example being high-impact polystyrene or HIPS. The least brittle structural ceramics are silicon carbide (mainly by virtue of its high strength) and transformation-toughened zirconia.|$|E

5000|$|Conservation of {{the wooden}} {{artifacts}} from Gordion has been ongoing since 1981, initiated by Robert Payton, now conservator at the Museum of London.

The preservation method developed by Payton was adapted and refined to treat over 40 pieces of furniture and more than 50 wooden objects from the three tumuli at Gordion. Study of the artifacts revealed that the wood was very fragile when handled. Since the wood was very light in weight and retained little of its original cellular structure, consolidation was necessary in order to strengthen the wood, using a dilute solution of Butvar B-98, a synthetic polymer based on <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>butyral.</b> The same polymer was utilized in more concentrated form to carry out repairs; for particularly fragmentary objects, glass microspheres were added to the solution to make a paste for filling gaps and reinforcing joins.|$|E
5000|$|Thermogravimetric {{analysis}} (TGA) {{relies on}} {{a high degree of}} precision in three measurements: mass change, temperature, and temperature change. Therefore, the basic instrumental requirements for TGA are a precision balance with a pan loaded with the sample, and a programmable furnace. The furnace can be programmed either for a constant heating rate, or for heating to acquire a constant mass loss with time. Though a constant heating rate is more common, a constant mass loss rate can illuminate specific reaction kinetics. For example, the kinetic parameters of the carbonization of <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>butyral</b> were found using a constant mass loss rate of 0.2 wt %/min. [...] Regardless of the furnace programming, the sample is placed in a small, electrically heated furnace equipped with a thermocouple to monitor accurate measurements of the temperature by comparing its voltage output with that of the voltage-versus-temperature table stored in the computer’s memory. A reference sample may be placed on another balance in a separate chamber. The atmosphere in the sample chamber may be purged with an inert gas to prevent oxidation or other undesired reactions. A different process using a quartz crystal microbalance has been devised for measuring smaller samples on the order of a microgram (versus milligram with conventional TGA).|$|E

50|$|Common {{aspects of}} synthesis: With the aerographite's CVD process metal oxides had {{been shown in}} 2012 to be a {{suitable}} template for deposition of graphitic structures. The templates can be in situ removed. Basic mechanism is the reduction of metal oxide to a metallic constituent, the nucleation of carbon in {{and on top of}} metal and the simultaneous evaporation of metal component.Requirements for the metal oxides are: a low activation energy for chemical reduction, a metal phase, which can nucleate graphite, a low evaporation point of metal phase (ZnO, SnO).From engineering perspective, the developed CVD process enables the use of ceramic powder processing (use of custom particles and sintering bridges) for creation of templates for 3D carbon via CVD. Key advantages compared to commonly used metal templates are: shape variety of particle shapes, the creation of sintering bridges and the removal without acids.Originally demonstrated on just µm-sized meshed graphite networks, the CVD mechanism had been adopted after 2014 by other scientists to create nm-sized carbon structures. Details specific to reference: Aerographite is produced by chemical vapor deposition, using a ZnO template. The template consists of micron-thick rods, often in the shape of multipods, that can be synthesized by mixing comparable amounts of Zn and <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>butyral</b> powders and heating the mixture at 900 °C. The aerographite synthesis is carried out at ~760 °C, under an argon gas flow, to which toluene vapors are injected as a carbon source. A thin (~15 nm), discontinuous layer of carbon is deposited on ZnO which is then etched away by adding hydrogen gas to the reaction chamber. Thus the remaining carbon network closely follows the morphology of the original ZnO template. In particular, the nodes of the aerographite network originate from the joints of the ZnO multipods.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe use {{of window}} glass in {{building}} design {{is becoming increasingly}} popular. Laminated glass has gained popularity as a suitable and practical alternative to monolithic and insulating glass in many design situations. Laminated glass plate performance is influenced by several factors such as glass thickness, glass type, temperature, aspect ratio, load duration, and hardness of the interlayer material. A new higher order finite element model (presented by the first two authors) using 9 -noded quadrilateral elements was applied to investigate laminated glass plates with both different interlayer materials. An experimental load-testing program is described. Two types of interlayer materials, regular <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>butyral</b> and strong formulation of <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>butyral</b> were used. First, simply supported rectangular laminated glass plates with regular <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>butyral</b> interlayer with aspect ratios 1 – 5 under different temperatures were tested. Second, one set of laminated glass plates with the strong formulation of <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>butyral</b> interlayer was tested under room temperature. The experimental and theoretical results are compared and discussed. In general, the performance of laminated glass with regular <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>butyral</b> interlayer is closer to that of layered glass at higher temperature. Also, laminated glass with strong formulation of <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>butyral</b> interlayer has a significantly larger load resistance than similar regular <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>butyral</b> samples...|$|E
