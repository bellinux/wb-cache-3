40|$|Thesis (M. M. (Public Policy)) [...] University of the Witwatersrand, Faculty of Commerce, Law and Management, Graduate School of Public and Development Management, 2013. There {{have been}} {{integration}} efforts in Africa {{for the last}} four decades, similar to other continental efforts across the globe. Learning from the past failures of regional integration efforts in Africa, in the late 1960 s and 1970 s, the East African Community <b>partner</b> <b>states</b> came up with a new approach towards integrating the region, that is, people centered and private sector driven integration. The regional integration projects and programmes remain the top priority among the EAC <b>partner</b> <b>states</b> as the means to achieve sustainable development in the region. Nevertheless there are indications that EAC <b>partner</b> <b>states</b> are over ambitious in advancing regional integration. The major challenges of the EAC integration span issues such as policy coordination and harmonization, infrastructure development and intra-regional trade expansion, protocols and policy implementation, labour mobility. The {{purpose of the study was}} to appraise the progress of regional integration protocols and policies implementation at the national level of the EAC <b>partner</b> <b>states.</b> The study assessed the extent of regional cooperation and integration success since the EAC was revived in 1999, up to 2010, in three broad areas: (i) customs union, (ii) community external relations, and (iii) common market. The research used exploratory case study approach. The main findings of the research were that: (i) the customs union is a difficult stage for <b>partner</b> <b>states</b> to implement; (ii) Tanzania has argued that land matters are not part in the common market discussion; and (iii) the EAC <b>partner</b> <b>states</b> are skeptical of the EU’s motives in economic partnership agreement negotiations. The study also found that the EU’s motives are to obtain preferential trade arrangements both in the EAC and other emerging economies. The study recommends initiatives to create an enabling environment for the greater mutual understanding and substantial degree of trust on the scope of cooperation agreed upon, among the <b>partner</b> <b>states</b> as building for further integration in the region...|$|R

5000|$|Especially {{when the}} HN government, the insurgency, and the FID force come from {{different}} cultures, careful thought {{needs to be}} given both {{to the way the}} parties perceive the rules, and the ways the communicate their agreement to one another. Steven Metz, of the US Army Strategic Studies Institute, observed: After the Second World War, the United States initially framed insurgency in Cold War terms, the most successful insurgencies were ones which became more and more [...] "state like," [...] controlling ever larger swaths of territory and expanding their military capability {{to the point that they}} could undertake larger operations. They developed organizational specialization and complexity with separate leaders, combatants, political cadre, auxiliaries, and a mass base. U.S. thinking tended to gravitate to the Maoist insurgent strategy of [...] "people's war" [...] which held that the rebels sought the internal formality and differentiation of a state. Insurgency, in other words, began as an asymmetric conflict but became less so as it progressed. The American notion of counterinsurgency rejected the brutal [...] "mailed fist" [...] approach (e.g., Trinquier's Modern War) used throughout history in favor of methods more amenable to a democracy.Derived from British, French, and American experience in [...] "small wars," [...] this stressed simultaneous actions to neutralize or destroy insurgent armed formations, separate the insurgents from [...] "the people," [...] and undertake political-economic reform. The American approach was to support a partner government, strengthening it and encouraging it to reform: foreign internal defense...which...U.S. involvement began at a low level, escalated until the <b>partner</b> <b>state</b> could stand on its own and had institutionalized political and economic reform, then receded once the insurgents were defeated and the government controlled its territory.|$|E
40|$|This report assesses ways {{in which}} the Action Plan process that has been {{launched}} under the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) could become a more effective driver of political and economic change in the Mashreq region (covering Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and the Palestinian territories), compared with the modest results from the Barcelona process to date. The development of the ENP has already provided a valuable systemic/institutional advance in Euro-Med relations and has been an important confidence-building measure in an increasingly uncertain political environment. But it has yet to provide momentum for economic, political and social advance in the <b>partner</b> <b>states.</b> Key elements in making the Action Plan process more effective would be the following: · The Commission needs to deepen the policy content of the ENP with sketches of different degrees of desirable EU acquis compliance as a function of different economic structures and capabilities of the <b>partner</b> <b>states.</b> · The task of policy-shaping in different sectors of the Action Plans with the <b>partner</b> <b>states</b> needs to be shared by the Commission with other international organisations, most importantly the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the European Investment Bank (EIB). · The policy-shaping recommendations in support of the economic parts of the Action Plans should be explicitly linked to financial or market-access incentives (or both) on offer from the EU and international financial institutions. The promotion of political reform in the <b>partner</b> <b>states</b> is a more delicate affair. Yet there is still some room for ‘positive conditionality’ if the Commission were to define more substantively the package of incentives that are offered to <b>partner</b> <b>states...</b>|$|R
