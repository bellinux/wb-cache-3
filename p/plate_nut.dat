50|$|A <b>plate</b> <b>nut,</b> {{also known}} as a nut plate, anchor nut or anchor plate, is a stamped sheet metal nut that is usually riveted to a workpiece. They have a long tube that is {{internally}} threaded and a plate with two clearance holes for rivets. The most popular versions have two lugs and they exist as fixed anchor nuts and as floating anchor nuts. The latter allows the nut to move slightly and so enlarges the positioning tolerances of the mounted parts. They were originally developed for the aerospace industry, but are now also common in automotive racing.These nuts are made up of variety of soft and hard materials. The choice of material depends on environment to which nut is subjected. Soft materials like copper or brass are used when nut is used in electrical application. Hard materials are used when nut is subjected to high stress environment. Sometimes stainless steel or nickel-plated nuts are used in order to increase corrosion resistance.|$|E
50|$|Locknut {{types are}} available, which utilize {{deformed}} threads or a nylon locking element, {{much like a}} nyloc <b>nut.</b> These locking <b>plate</b> <b>nuts</b> are used when the nut is subjected to constant changes in environment or to vibration. The nylon insert expands and stops vibrations of the nut and acts as a locking arrangement. Other types have a floating nut or replaceable locking elements. A typical U.S. military specification for <b>plate</b> <b>nuts</b> is MS21047.|$|R

40|$|An {{algorithm}} {{was developed}} to separate pistachio nuts with closed-shells from those with open-shells. It was observed that upon impact on a steel <b>plate,</b> <b>nuts</b> with closed-shells emit different sounds than nuts with open-shells. Two feature vectors extracted from the sound signals were melcepstrum coefficients and eigenvalues obtained from the principle component analysis of the autocorrelation matrix of the signals. Classification of a sound signal was done by linearly combining feature vectors from both mel-cepstrum and PCA feature vectors. An important property of the algorithm {{is that it is}} easily trainable. During the training phase, sounds of the nuts with closed-shells and open-shells were used to obtain a representative vector of each class.

40|$|ABSTRACT. An {{algorithm}} using {{speech recognition}} technology {{was developed to}} distinguish pistachio nuts with closed shells from those with open shells. It was observed that upon impact with a steel <b>plate,</b> <b>nuts</b> with closed shells emit different sounds than nuts with open shells. Features extracted from the sound signals consisted of mel−cepstrum coefficients and eigenvalues obtained from the principle component analysis (PCA) of the autocorrelation matrix of the sound signals. Classification of a sound signal was performed by linearly combining the mel−cepstrum and PCA feature vectors. An important property of the algorithm {{is that it is}} easily trainable, as are most speech−recognition algorithms. During the training phase, sounds of nuts with closed shells and with open shells were used to obtain a representative vector of each class. During the recognition phase, the feature vector from the sample under question was compared with representative vectors. The classification accura-cy of closed−shell nuts was more than 99 % on the validation set, which did not include the training set...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT:The main {{principle}} of design of truss by using Ferro-cement is economy and safety. In this investigation a ferrocement roof truss {{has been designed}} which are of low in cost, light in weight and easy to maintain. The first step of design involves the calculation of dead load using IS 875 (part- 1) and wind load using IS 875 (part- 3) - 1987. The next step involves the calculation of tension and compression in each individual member of the truss. Sections of the truss are designed using the value of highest tension or compression. After designing all the sections, the truss is constructed. A 6 -mm diameter circular coil is used as reinforcing material for construction and angles of desired shape are made to hold the sections in position. Hexagonal wire mesh or chicken mess is cut into required sizes and are placed over the reinforced skeleton of the section. Conventional mortar of cement sand ratio of 1 : 2 is prepared. The mixture is laid on the truss and the structure is allowed to stand for 28 days. Connection <b>plates,</b> <b>nuts</b> and bolts are used to connect the members and to hold them firmly in position...|$|R

40|$|As part of {{the search}} for a seismic {{isolator}} for low-rise buildings, this paper proposes a marble-graphite slide seismic isolation system composed of marble-graphite slides, an upper foundation beam, the lower counter{{part of the}} upper beam, and the corresponding stop blocks, with the stop blocks consisting of restrictive screws, positioning <b>plates,</b> <b>nut</b> connectors and stop holes linking the two foundation beams. To provide the desired isolation performance, plain mortar bars can be included at the beam interface to better control the initiating loads for foundation slippage. Tests of low-reversed cyclic loading were performed on four different masonry specimens: a recycled brick wall, a clay brick wall, an integrated recycled brick wall with flay ash blocks sandwiched between, and its clay brick counterpart. The four specimens were provided with marble-graphite slide isolators placed at the foundations. The isolator thickness was 20 mm, and the graphite and the marble served as a lubricant and a bearing, respectively. This paper then analyses all of the specimens in terms of the damage that occurred, the initiating load for slippage, the hysteretic performance, the bearing capacity and the performance of the stop blocks. The results indicate that mortar bars embedded in the marble-graphite slide isolator offer effective control of the initiating load, and the isolation system delivers good hysteretic performance. The stop blocks are capable of withstanding a large-magnitude earthquake and are a good choice for constraining the slippage displacement. Damage or failure of the specimens occurs only when the low-reversed cyclic loading continues after slippage takes place. The design is shown to be an outstanding and flexible seismic scheme for use in low-rise buildings...|$|R

50|$|A {{disadvantage}} {{of the wet}} wing is that every rivet, bolt, <b>nut</b> <b>plate,</b> hose and tube that penetrates the wing must be sealed to prevent fuel from leaking or seeping around these hardware components. This sealant must allow for expansion and contraction due to rapid temperature changes (such as when cold fuel is pumped into a warm wing tank) and must retain its sealing properties when submerged in fuel and when left dry {{for long periods of}} time. Working with this sealant can be difficult and replacing old sealant inside a small wing tank can be harder if the old sealant needs to be removed as well before new sealant can be applied.|$|R
40|$|In the {{underground}} mines of the Legnica–Głogów Copper District (LGOM) the main {{way to protect}} the room excavation {{is the use of}} a rock bolt support. For many years, it has proven to be an efficient security measure in excavations which met all safety standards and requirements. The article presents the consumption of the rock bolt support in the Mining Department “Polkowice–Sieroszowice” in the years 2010 – 2015 as well as the number of bolt supports that were used to secure the excavations. In addition, it shows the percentage of bolt supports that were used to conduct rebuilding work and cover the surface of exposed roofs. One of the factors contributing to the loss of the functionality of bolt supports is corrosion whose occurrence may lead directly to a reduction in the diameter of rock bolt support parts, in particular rods, bearing <b>plates</b> and <b>nuts.</b> The phenomenon of the corrosion of the bolt support and its elements in underground mining is an extremely common phenomenon due to the favorable conditions for its development in mines, namely high temperature and humidity, as well as the presence of highly aggressive water. This involves primarily a decrease in the capacity of bolt support construction, which entails the need for its strengthening, and often the need to perform the reconstruction of the excavation...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of two series of experimental and analytical studies on the structural behavior of an innovative moment-resisting connection to concrete-filled circular hollow sections using blind bolts. The first part of the paper presents a large-scale T-stub connection with full instrumentation tested to failure in tension, and the second part presents a series of pullout tests to explore the anchorage behavior of cogged bars within concrete-filled steel tubes. The favorable strength and stiffness characteristics of this type of connection showed that it could be an alternative to conventional welded moment-resisting connections. A 3 D finite-element (FE) model was developed to simulate the behavior of blind-bolted T-stub connections when subject to tension. The FE model took into account material nonlinearities, geometrical discontinuities, and complex contact interactions among the bolt heads, tube wall, end <b>plates,</b> and <b>nuts.</b> The FE results were found to be in good quantitative agreement with the actual connection behavior. A stiffness model composed of various nonlinear springs was also developed to predict the pullout behavior of cogged bars within concrete-filled steel tubes. The cogged extensions to the blind bolts were very effective in relieving the stress concentration on the thin tube wall. The tensile load can be shared between membrane action of the tube wall and anchorage of the cogged bars. Thus, by using the blind-bolted connections with cogged extensions to connect the beam flanges to the column, moment transfer between the beam and column can be effectively achieved within a structural frame of composite construction...|$|R

Mrs Roper's tea-table was not pleasant to him, but even that would have been preferable to the black dinginess of Pawkins's mahogany, with the company of two tired old men, with whom he seemed to have no mutual subject of conversation. Once or twice he tried a word with the colonel, for the colonel sat with his eyes open looking at the fire. But he was answered with monosyllables, and it was evident to him that the colonel did not wish to talk. To sit still, with his hands closed over each other on his lap, was work enough for Colonel Dale during his after-dinner hours.|$|R
40|$|Mechanically {{compatible}} fasteners for {{use with}} thin or weakened bone sections in the human mandible are being developed to help reduce large strain discontinuities across the bone/implant interface. Materials being considered for these fasteners are a polyetherertherketone (PEEK) resin with continuous quartz or carbon fiber for the screw. The screws were designed to have a shear strength equivalent to that of compact/trabecular bone and {{to be used with}} a conventional <b>nut,</b> <b>nut</b> <b>plate,</b> or an expandable shank/blind nut made of a ceramic filled polymer. Physical and finite element models of the mandible were developed in order to help select the best material fastener design. The models replicate the softer inner core of trabecular bone and the hard outer shell of compact bone. The inner core of the physical model consisted of an expanding foam and the hard outer shell consisted of ceramic particles in an epoxy matrix. This model has some of the cutting and drilling attributes of bone and may be appropriate as an educational tool for surgeons and medical students. The finite element model was exercised to establish boundary conditions consistent with the stress profiles associated with mandible bite forces and muscle loads. Work is continuing to compare stress/strain profiles of a reconstructed mandible with the results from the finite element model. When optimized, these design and fastening techniques may be applicable, not only to other skeletal structures, but to any composite structure...|$|R
