25|$|Experimental neuropsychology is an {{approach}} that uses methods from experimental psychology to uncover {{the relationship between the}} nervous system and cognitive function. The majority of work involves studying healthy humans in a laboratory setting, although a minority of researchers may conduct animal experiments. Human work in this area often takes advantage of specific features of our nervous system (for example that visual information presented to a specific visual field is preferentially processed by the cortical hemisphere on the opposite side) to make links between neuroanatomy and <b>psychological</b> <b>function.</b>|$|E

Seventeen faculty members from the department are affiliated with the CSBMB. Unique among research institutions that own and operate fMRI scanners, the CSBMB is the first facility to own a scanner that is run solely by neuroscientists that conduct basic research. Most scanners in the United States are located in clinical settings and are utilized primarily in applied research.|$|E

40|$|Aims: To {{investigate}} {{the relation between}} <b>psychological</b> <b>functioning</b> of subjects with Down syndrome, and their levels of urine peptide and serum antibodies to food proteins.

Results: The participants, and their siblings, were found to have significantly increased total urine peptide levels.

40|$|The present {{article is}} {{characterized}} by a theoretical research realized based on the Historical and Dialectical Materialism method and it aims to discuss the development of conscience and superior <b>psychological</b> <b>functions</b> under the Historical-Cultural Psychology theory. The superior <b>psychological</b> <b>functions</b> are the complex structure of conscience that were constituted throughout the social historical development of humanity. Human conscience and its superior <b>psychological</b> <b>functions</b> are not ready since birth and are not only developed in a process of biological maturation. They are the social basis of human personality. Humanity humanizes itself as humans appropriate themselves of the knowledge constructed by society throughout history. Through the process of human culture appropriation, humankind develop its <b>psychological</b> superior <b>functions.</b> <b>Psychological</b> superior <b>functions</b> are organized in functional systems, from complex interfunctional nexus. Each isolated function, as well as the <b>psychological</b> <b>functions</b> and its nexus, are developed through instruments and signs, reconstructing human conscience and psyche. The conscience is not priori given, it is developed through cultural appropriation. Conscience is composed by the <b>psychological</b> superior <b>functions,</b> which form a highly complex interrelated psychological system. It is concluded that the humanizing process is essentially educative.

Moreover, we tested whether clients' perceptions of the working alliance and the real relationship mediated the relationship between clients' perceptions of their psychotherapists' MCO and <b>psychological</b> <b>functioning.</b> The results showed that clients' perceptions of their psychotherapists' MCO were positively related to working alliance, real relationship, and <b>psychological</b> <b>functioning.</b> Only clients' ratings of the working alliance mediated the relationship between clients' perceptions of their psychotherapists' MCO and <b>psychological</b> <b>functioning.</b> Thus, because clients perceive their psychotherapists as being more oriented toward cultural issues, they may view the therapist as being more credible and may gain a sense of comfort in the therapeutic process.

40|$|Resilience in {{clinical}} and counseling graduate students was examined as a tripartite construct consisting of personality, coping, and <b>psychological</b> <b>functioning</b> in a structural equation model. Specifically, five personality traits were included {{as predictors of}} coping and <b>psychological</b> <b>functioning,</b> and coping served {{as a predictor of}} <b>psychological</b> <b>functioning.</b> Three hundred and nine graduate students {{in clinical}} and counseling psychology programs participated in an online questionnaire survey consisting of self-report instruments measuring the five-factor model of personality, coping, social support, depression, anxiety, wellbeing, and burnout. In the best fitting model, conscientiousness was a positive predictor of coping and a negative predictor <b>psychological</b> <b>functioning,</b> neuroticism negatively predicted coping, and openness to new experiences positively predicted coping. Extraversion and agreeableness were not significant predictors of coping or <b>psychological</b> <b>functioning</b> in the structural equation model. The goal {{of the study was to}} better understand the relationships between personality, coping, and <b>psychological</b> <b>functioning</b> as well as contribute to the empirical data on the functioning of graduate students in clinical and counseling psychology. The results suggest that there are certain characteristics that may be more important for graduate students and their mentors and supervisors to be aware of to increase the wellbeing of graduate students and protect against burnout and other stress related problems later in their careers. For example, conscientiousness positively predicted coping, yet negatively predicted <b>psychological</b> <b>functioning,</b> suggesting that high levels of conscientiousness could be problematic if the student is over-extended academically. Future work in this area might productively focus on examining more comprehensive and complex models of resilience, utilizing additional personality constructs and variables for a clearer idea of resilience in both psychology graduate students as well as other populations...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether physical and <b>psychological</b> <b>functioning</b> can predict 6 -year cognitive decline in older adults. A group of 669 participants aged 60 to 81 years was recruited from a longitudinal study (the Maastricht Aging Study). Physical functioning was measured in terms of perceived health and instrumental activities of daily living. <b>Psychological</b> <b>functioning</b> or mood was evaluated by the Depression and Anxiety subscales of the Symptom Check List– 90. Although physical <b>functioning</b> and <b>psychological</b> <b>functioning</b> were related to several measures of cognitive <b>functioning</b> at baseline, <b>psychological</b> <b>functioning</b> was specifically related to memory functioning 6 years later. Poor <b>psychological</b> <b>functioning</b> (i. e., depressive and anxiety symptomatology), rather than poor physical health, may have the strongest implications for long-term cognitive functioning in older men and women. F ROM a gerontological viewpoint, knowledge of factorsthat are associated with optimal functioning may help to improve autonomy and well-being in old age. Such knowledge may also make it possible to develop dedicated intervention programs to specifically modify these factors. In this respect, much can be learned from individuals who function on a high level according to psychological and physical criteria (Worl...|$|R
40|$|Music {{listening}} {{has been}} suggested to have short-term beneficial effects. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the association and potential mediating mechanisms between various aspects of habitual music-listening behaviour and physiological and <b>psychological</b> <b>functioning.</b> An internet-based survey was conducted in university students, measuring habitual music-listening behaviour, emotion regulation, stress reactivity, as well as physiological and <b>psychological</b> <b>functioning.</b> A total of 1230 individuals (mean = 24. 89 ± 5. 34 years, 55. 3 % women) completed the questionnaire. Quantitative aspects of habitual music-listening behaviour, i. e. average duration of music listening and subjective relevance of music, were not associated with physiological and <b>psychological</b> <b>functioning.</b> In contrast, qualitative aspects, i. e. reasons for listening (especially 'reducing loneliness and aggression', and 'arousing or intensifying specific emotions') were significantly related to physiological and <b>psychological</b> <b>functioning</b> (all p = 0. 001). These direct effects were mediated by distress-augmenting emotion regulation and individual stress reactivity. The habitual music-listening behaviour appears to be a multifaceted behaviour that is further influenced by dispositions that are usually not related to music listening. Consequently, habitual music-listening behaviour is not obviously linked to physiological and <b>psychological</b> <b>functioning...</b>|$|R
