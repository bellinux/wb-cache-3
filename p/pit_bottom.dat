What did these jungle savages of the dark heart of Guadalcanal know of helmets? Had Mendana's men-at-arms worn helmets and penetrated here centuries before?

5000|$|Another feature {{which is}} {{suspected}} {{to be connected}} to the cave is the pit above the Kravljansko vrelo. It is located at an altitude of 450 m and is 123 m deep. In the winter of 1996 ASAK explored the pit again. Strong air drift from the eroded shaft at the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>pit</b> points to the existence of the spacious canal in the pit's extension, which is most likely connected to the Cerje cave. Previous measurements showed that the pit is located right above the cave's [...] "Salomna chamber" [...] which is located {{at the end of the}} corridor, as much as it was explored at the time. However, repeated measurements showed that the pit is actually 350 m east of the cave's canal and that the <b>pit's</b> <b>bottom</b> is close to the level of the Kravljansko vrelo, below the cave's siphon. A plan was made to dig through the <b>pit's</b> <b>bottom</b> shaft in order to make an easier access to the distant areas of the cave.|$|R

40|$|The {{processes}} {{taking part}} in the chemical weathering of nonvesicular dolerite cobbles producing etch pits and secondary minerals including clays, under cold arid conditions of high-altitude ice-free areas of Victoria Land (Antarctica) are investigated as a possible analog to processes that produced the pitted rocks and clay minerals on Mars. Results suggest that the pits in the dolerite cobbles are formed by the dissolution of the rock by rare snow-melt water during the austral summer, followed by wind erosion of weathered material. The upper interior walls of the pits are lined with a yellow precipitate consisting of illite and quartz mixture, while the <b>pit</b> <b>bottoms</b> contain alteration products including Fe-rich clay minerals and soluble salts. A model is proposed for rock pitting on Mars analogous to that of the Antarctic dolerites...|$|R

40|$|Ten {{composite}} {{soil samples}} (0 - 15 cm depth) {{were collected from}} abandoned phosphate-mined sites on Nauru Island (Central Pacific) and analyzed for % organic C and % N. The samples represent a temporal sequence (chronosequence) of soil development spanning < 55 yr. The increase of% C and % N was fairly rapid. In recently mined sites « 1 yr) the values of % C were between 0. 41 and 0. 48, and those for % N were between 0. 03 and 0. 04. Fifty-five years after mining, the values of % C and % N were 4. 56 and 0. 33, respectively, and comparable to the amounts found in undisturbed Lithic Haplustolls, Typic Haplustolls, and Lithic Ustorthents epipedons. These changes in soil properties {{are considered to be}} a function of time and the accompanying seral development of vegetation (particularly the fern cover of Nephrolepis biserrata and Polypodium scolopendria), because parent materials, climate, and other factors of soil formation are considered to be constant.

5000|$|In the 1960s {{the mine}} was {{producing}} 10000000 carat kg of diamond per year, {{of which a}} relatively high fraction (20%) were of gem quality. The upper layers of the mine (down to 340 metres) had very high diamond content of 4 carat g per tonne of ore, with the relatively high ratio of gems to industrial stones. The yield decreased to about 2 carat g per tonne and the production rate slowed to 2000000 carat kg per year near the <b>pit</b> <b>bottom.</b> The largest diamond of the mine was found on 23 December 1980; it weighed 342.5 carats (68 g) and was named [...] "26th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union" [...] (XXVI съезд КПСС).

40|$|As peak {{fluence of}} high power lasers is increased, it becomes {{necessary}} to tolerate damage on mirrors, polarizers. To study how {{different types of}} damage morphologies initiate and grow during repetitive illumination, hafnia-silica multilayer mirror and polarizer coatings were laser damage tested. The coatings were prepared by e-beam evaporation and irradiated with a 3 -ns pulse at 1064 nm. The damage morphology was recorded after each shot to determine the types of damage that cause massive unstable failure and lower the optic`s functional damage threshold. Results were summarized on damage stability maps plotting the average damage size vs number of shots for fluences ranging from 10 to 40 J/cm{sup 2 }. The maps indicate that the commonly observed damage morphologies (<b>pits,</b> flat <b>bottom</b> <b>pits,</b> scalds, outer layer delamination) have distinct growth behaviors and influence {{the value of the}} functional damage threshold differently. While pits are stable up to fluences as high as 40 J/cm{sup 2 }, flat <b>bottom</b> <b>pits</b> can grow during repetitive illumination above a critical fluence of about 35 J/cm{sup 2 }. Scalds are formed in the first shot and never grow at fluences below 40 J/cm{sup 2 }. Finally, delaminates are highly unstable and have the potential for damaging the coating catastrophically above 15 J/cm{sup 2 }. Results show that delaminate damage should be prevented; this knowledge has allowed coatings development efforts to focus on eliminating the origin of such damage morphology...|$|R

50|$|In 1947 the Wheldale {{colliery}} was nationalised, and in 1949 {{major improvements}} were made: The colliery was completely electrified. Two skips were {{installed in the}} downcast shaft, each with a capacity of six tonnes, allowing a production of 350 tonnes per hour. The Downcast shaft had an electric winder which had two 475 H.P. motors. The upcast shaft, which was for men and materials, had two single deck cages, each of which could hold two tubs. The winder had a 180 H.P. motor. Conveyor belts were installed; Wheldale then had the longest single conveyor belt in the world, about one mile in length. Gate roads were 30 inch belts, trunk conveyors were 36 inch in width. The Flockton seam had two bunkers, a <b>pit</b> <b>bottom</b> bunker of 250 tonnes capacity and an inbye bunker of 200 tonnes. Dirt from repairs in the return gates were transported to the <b>pit</b> <b>bottom</b> in tubs. Deisel locomotives carried men and material about the mine.|$|E

5000|$|The {{children}} of the poor were expected to help towards the family budget, often working long hours in dangerous jobs for low wages. Agile boys were employed by the chimney sweeps; small children were employed to scramble under machinery to retrieve cotton bobbins; and children were also employed to work in coal mines, crawling through tunnels too narrow and low for adults. Children also worked as errand boys, crossing sweepers, shoe blacks, or sold matches, flowers, and other cheap goods. Some children undertook work as apprentices to respectable trades, such as building, or as domestic servants (there were over 120,000 domestic servants in London in the mid 19th century). Working hours were long: builders might work 64 hours a week in summer and 52 in winter, while domestic servants were theoretically on duty 80-hours a week."Mother bides at home, she is troubled with bad breath, and is sair weak in her body from early labour.

The mirrors and polarizers were coated for operation at 1053 nm at 45 {degree} and at Brewster`s angle (56 {degree}), respectively. They were tested {{with a single}} 3 -ns laser pulse. Morphology of the laser-induced damage was characterized by optical and scanning electron microscopy. Four distinct damage morphologies were found: pits, flatbottom pits, scalds, and delaminates. The <b>pits</b> and flat <b>bottom</b> <b>pits</b> (< 30 {mu}m dia) were detected at lower fluences (as low as 5 J/cm{sup 2 }). The pits seemed to result from ejection of nodular defects by causing local enhancement of the electric field. Scalds and delaminates could be observed at higher fluences (above 13 J/cm{sup 2 }) and seemed to result from the formation of plasmas on the surface. These damage types often originated at pits and were less than 300 {mu}m diameter; their size increased almost linearly with fluence. Finally, effects of the damage on the beam (reflectivity degradation and phase modulations) were measured...|$|R
