5|$|A single {{reference}} in {{the tomb of}} Ahmose Pen-Nekhebet indicates another campaign in Iamu {{in the land of}} Kehek. Unfortunately, the location of Kehek is unknown. It was long believed that Kehek was a reference to the Libyan tribe, Qeheq, and thus it was postulated that invaders from Libya took advantage of the death of Ahmose to move into the western Nile Delta. Unfortunately for this theory, the Qeheq <b>people</b> <b>only</b> appeared in later times, and Kehek's identity remains unknown. Nubia is a possibility, since Amenhotep did campaign there, and the western desert and the oases have also been suggested, since these seem to have fallen under Egyptian control once again.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{construction}} of the citadel, the Tây Sơn never again attempted to recapture the city—the building gave Nguyen Anh a further psychological advantage over his opponents. The citadel helped to secure the southern region, which allowed Nguyễn Ánh to implement domestic programs to strengthen himself economically in preparation to fight the Tây Sơn. He used the newfound security to undertake agrarian reforms. Due to Tây Sơn naval raids on the rice crop, the area had been suffering long term rice shortages. Although the land was extremely fertile, the region was agriculturally underexploited because it had been occupied by Vietnamese <b>people</b> <b>only</b> relatively recently. Nguyễn Ánh's programs resulted in large amounts of previously idle land being cultivated. Large surpluses of grain, taxable by the state, were generated.|$|E
5|$|In both Mozambique and Malawi, Delfina dropped heavy {{rainfall}} that caused flooding. In the former country, over 18,000houses were severely damaged or destroyed, leaving thousands homeless. The storm damaged roads and bridges, which disrupted relief {{efforts in the}} aftermath, and floods destroyed widespread areas of crops {{in the midst of}} an ongoing food shortage. Lingering flooding caused an outbreak of cholera and malaria in Mozambique, and 47people were killed by Delfina. In Malawi, flooding was not widespread, although the storm destroyed about 3,600houses and killed eight <b>people.</b> <b>Only</b> two months after the storm struck, however, Cyclone Japhet left damage and deaths in many of the same areas that Delfina affected.|$|E

5|$|Rommel was {{an ambitious}} {{man who took}} {{advantage}} of his proximity to Hitler and willingly accepted the propaganda campaigns designed for him by Goebbels. He sought {{to level the playing}} field for non-nobles, and also supported militarism and a strong German Empire, while treating <b>people</b> <b>only</b> according to their merits. He did not display hatred to people of noble descent, and in fact was a throwback to the medieval knight in his personal traits, appearing well-versed in the ancient customs of chivalry, which helped to attract admiration from the British who saw in him a romantic archetype. Rommel classed himself as a traditionalist regarding military ethics and a modernist regarding warfare techniques. Certain authors remark that he also sought military glory and personal recognition, most of all from Hitler on whom, according to Watson, Rommel projected his idea of the German people's will.|$|E
