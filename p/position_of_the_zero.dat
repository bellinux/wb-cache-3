40|$|We present two exact relations, {{valid for}} any dilepton {{invariant}} mass region (large and low recoil) and independent of any effective Hamiltonian computation, between the observables Pi and PCPi of the angular {{distribution of the}} four-body decay B→K∗(→Kπ) l+l−. These relations emerge out of the symmetries of the angular distribution. We discuss {{the implications of these}} relations under the (testable) hypotheses of no scalar or tensor contributions and no New Physics weak phases in the Wilson coefficients. Under these hypotheses, there is a direct relation among the observables P 1, P 2, and P′ 4, 5. This can be used as an independent consistency test of the measurements of the angular observables. Alternatively, these relations can be applied directly in the fit to data, reducing the number of free parameters in the fit. This opens up the possibility of performing a full angular fit of the observables with existing data sets. An important consequence of the found relations is that a priori two different measurements, namely the measured <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>zero</b> (q 20) of the forward-backward asymmetry AFB and the value of P′ 5 evaluated at this same point, are related by P 24 (q 20) +P 25 (q 20) = 1.

Basically, trajectories for hip and swing foot motion are generated, which guarantee that the objective locomotion parameters attain certain prescribed values. Additionally, the hip trajectories are slightly modified such that the upper body motion is steered naturally, meaning that it requires practically no actuation.
