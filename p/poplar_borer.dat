40|$|An initial {{assessment}} of rapid dieback and mortality of aspen in southwest Colorado {{suggests that it}} represents a decline disease incited by acute, warm drought. Predisposing factors include low elevation, south and southwest aspects, droughty soils, open stands, and physiological maturity. Contributing factors include Cytospora canker, two bark beetles, <b>poplar</b> <b>borer,</b> and bronze <b>poplar</b> <b>borer.</b> Because this is a true decline disease distinct from “aspen decline ” as often discussed in the literature, we {{refer to it as}} sudden aspen decline. There has been little regeneration response to overstory loss...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Fifty-six taxa in forty-two genera are {{reported}} from wood-boring beetle {{activity of the}} long-horned beetle Saperda calcarata (<b>poplar</b> <b>borer)</b> (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) and weevil Cryptorhynchus lapathi (poplar and willow borer) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) during a study designed to assess {{the distribution of the}} yeast genus Ascobotryozyma. Regular collections from wounds, frass, galleries, and larvae in Populus tremuloides (trembling aspen) over 27 months revealed trends in fungal species composition in relation to gallery location and age of beetle damage. In Salix, fungi were identified only from galleries from which Ascobotryozyma was found; thirty-four taxa {{are reported}}. Fungi identified in this study are compared with those from other surveys and their roles within the trees and associations with other organisms are discussed...|$|E
