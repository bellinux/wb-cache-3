5|$|Chinook <b>Pass</b> <b>is</b> {{the border}} between Pierce and Yakima {{counties}} and Mount Rainier National Park and the Wenatchee National Forest. The <b>pass</b> <b>is</b> also where the highway crosses the Pacific Crest Trail, a National Scenic Trail that was completed in 1993. East of Chinook Pass, the roadway begins to parallel the American River northeast to follow the Little Naches River, which becomes the Naches River. After a junction with {{the other end of}} the proposed SR168, named Little Naches Road, the highway exits the Wenatchee National Forest and enters Naches. The byway ends at US12 in Naches near the Naches Selah Canal.|$|E
5|$|Shenzhen Tong {{cards are}} now {{widely used in}} Shenzhen instead, and a {{combined}} Shenzhen Tong – Hong Kong Octopus card is available, called the Hu Tong Xing, with RMB & HKD in different purses. The Macau <b>Pass</b> <b>is</b> now widely used in Macau.|$|E
5|$|The {{eastern end}} of the <b>pass</b> <b>is</b> by the River Derwent. The river is bridged by the Ashopton Viaduct, built {{as part of the}} Ladybower Reservoir project between 1935 and 1945.|$|E

50|$|Admission to {{the park}} costs A$25 per person and {{provides}} a three-day <b>pass.</b> <b>Passes</b> <b>are</b> non-transferable and all <b>passes</b> <b>are</b> checked by park rangers.|$|R
5|$|A park <b>pass</b> <b>is</b> {{required}} for stopping {{in the park}} and permit checks are common during the summer months, especially at Lake Louise and the start of the Icefields Parkway. A permit is not required if travelling straight through the park without stopping. Approximately 5 million people pass through Banff annually on the Trans-Canada Highway without stopping.|$|E
5|$|Four miles (6.4km) {{west of the}} <b>pass</b> <b>is</b> {{the site}} of Independence, the village whose {{establishment}} on July 4 led to the pass's current name. It has been a ghost town since the early 20th century. In 1973 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Most of its buildings were cannibalized for their building supplies, but a few log cabins remain. The Aspen Historical Society, {{in conjunction with the}} U.S. Forest Service, built an interpretive trail with plaques.|$|E
5|$|Major {{entry points}} to Skyline Drive located in Front Royal, Thornton Gap, Swift Run Gap, and Rockfish Gap. Fees are {{collected}} at the Skyline Drive's four access points. The fee is not a toll charged to drive on the road, but rather an entry fee for the park itself. Various passes allow for admission to the park. A $25.00 <b>pass</b> <b>is</b> valid for unlimited entrances within a seven-day period for a private non-commercial vehicle. A seven-day pass costs $15.00 for motorcycles and $10.00 for individuals 16 {{years of age or}} older entering by means other than a private non-commercial vehicle. Commercial tours pay between $25.00 and $200.00 for a seven-day pass, depending on the number of passengers. An annual park pass costs $50.00 for a private non-commercial vehicle. Entrance can also be gained through the America the Beautiful: National Parks and Federal Recreational Lands Pass series. In this series, the Annual Pass costs $80.00, the lifetime Senior Pass costs $10.00, the lifetime Access Pass allows free admission for persons with disabilities, and the Volunteer Pass allows free admission for volunteers who work 250 service hours for the following year. A free Annual <b>Pass</b> <b>is</b> also available for members of the United States Armed Forces and fourth graders can get free admission for their whole family through the Every Kid in a Park Pass.|$|E
50|$|Class passing, {{similar to}} {{racial and gender}} <b>passing,</b> <b>is</b> the {{concealment}} or misrepresentation of one’s social class. In Class-Passing: Social Mobility in Film and Popular Culture, Gwendolyn Audrey Foster suggests racial and gender <b>passing</b> <b>is</b> often stigmatized, while class <b>passing</b> <b>is</b> generally accepted as normative behavior. Class <b>passing</b> <b>is</b> common in the United States and {{is linked to the}} notions of the American Dream and of upward class mobility. Passing in the context of caste, as prevalent in the Indian sub-continent, is also called Sanskritization.|$|R
5000|$|Fares for VIA have {{remained}} relatively modest during its existence. At {{its inception in}} 1978, fares were 25¢ for most routes. Fares for most fixed routes during 2006 were 80¢, and a monthly bus <b>pass</b> <b>was</b> $20, much lower than most other transit systems in the country. On January 1, 2007, basic fares were raised to $1, and monthly <b>pass</b> prices <b>were</b> raised to $25. Basic fares increased to $1.10 and monthly <b>pass</b> prices <b>were</b> raised to $30 on January 1, 2009. On 1 March 2014, the basic bus fare <b>was</b> $1.20; day <b>passes</b> <b>were</b> $4 and a 31-day <b>pass</b> <b>was</b> $35. [...] the base fare <b>is</b> $1.30; day <b>passes</b> <b>were</b> reduced to $2.75; 7-day <b>passes</b> <b>are</b> $12 and 31-day <b>passes</b> <b>are</b> $38. No fare to kids below 5 who ride with fare-paying rider (limit 3). In addition, when fare is paid in cash, a transfer can be bought for $0.15. Transfers have unlimited use on Local Service for 2.5 h in any direction, with round trips or stopovers prohibited. To transfer from local to express, the difference of the service must be paid. Daily, 7 Day and 31 Day <b>Passes</b> <b>are</b> accept on ALL Routes except for VIA Trans and Special Event Service.|$|R

In Auburn, Oswego, Fulton and Rome, 10-ride <b>passes</b> <b>are</b> {{available for}} $10.00 for adults and $5.00 for reduced-fare passengers. Similarly-discounted 10-ride <b>passes</b> <b>are</b> also available for commuter-route passengers in Onondaga, Cayuga and Oswego counties.|$|R
5|$|On the Indian side, only {{citizens}} of India {{can visit the}} pass on Wednesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays, and Sundays, after obtaining permits one day in advance in Gangtok. The <b>pass</b> <b>is</b> particularly useful for pilgrims visiting monasteries in Sikkim such as Rumtek, one of the holiest shrines in Buddhism. For Hindus, the pass reduces the journey time to Mansarovar Lake from fifteen days to two days.|$|E
5|$|Snake <b>Pass</b> <b>is</b> a hill {{pass in the}} Derbyshire {{section of}} the Peak District, {{crossing}} the Pennines between Glossop and the Ladybower Reservoir at Ashopton. The road was engineered by Thomas Telford and opened in 1821. The pass carries the A57 road between Manchester and Sheffield, {{but it is no}} longer the main signposted route between those two cities.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of the freeway over Vail <b>Pass</b> <b>is</b> also listed as an engineering marvel. One of the challenges of this portion is {{the management of the}} wildlife that roams this area. Several parts of the approach to the pass feature large fences that prevent wildlife from crossing the freeway and direct the animals to one of several underpasses. At least one underpass is located along a natural migratory path and has been landscaped to encourage deer to cross.|$|E
5000|$|Double-tracked {{sections}} {{are marked}} [...] "∥", single-tracked sections where trains may <b>pass</b> <b>are</b> marked [...] "◇", and single-tracked sections where trains cannot <b>pass</b> <b>are</b> marked [...] "｜".|$|R
5000|$|Defensive <b>pass</b> {{interference}} <b>is</b> penalized {{from the}} spot of the foul, regardless if the <b>pass</b> <b>was</b> thrown or not. Previously, interference before the <b>pass</b> <b>was</b> thrown was a 15-yard penalty {{from the previous}} spot. This change would be repealed in the 1984 season.|$|R
50|$|Mountain <b>passes</b> that <b>are</b> known {{not to have}} cycling {{milestones}} {{are listed}} in the following table. Since more and more mountain <b>passes</b> <b>are</b> being equipped with cycling milestones, the table specifies the time when a mountain <b>pass</b> <b>was</b> last seen not to have cycling milestones.|$|R
5|$|The <b>pass</b> <b>is</b> above tree line, so the {{surrounding}} terrain is alpine tundra. Open grassy expanses are occasionally broken by low shrubbery and bare patches of rock, {{particularly on the}} steep slope to the north. Snow lingers in some areas year-round. Adjacent to the road and parking area are small ephemeral pools on the southwest, with a larger, permanent one north of the road.|$|E
5|$|The {{terrain is}} level enough, and the ridge broad enough, {{to allow for}} a 500-foot (150 m) parking lot along the south side of Highway 82 at the height of land. The <b>pass</b> <b>is</b> split evenly between Pitkin and Lake counties, as well as White River and San Isabel {{national}} forests. Boundaries of the Collegiate Peaks Wilderness and the Mount Massive Wilderness are near the pass on the south and north respectively. The Hunter–Fryingpan Wilderness is also nearby.|$|E
5|$|Driving {{through the}} <b>pass</b> <b>is</b> challenging. Both {{approaches}} require 6% grades {{due to the}} height of the pass, and require navigating hairpin turns with advisory speeds of 10mph (15km/h). Rockfalls, particularly on the approach from Aspen, have narrowed some sections to a single lane 12 feet (4 m) wide with temporary traffic lights. On the Twin Lakes approach, they have resulted in temporary closures. Other vehicles frequently enter the road unexpectedly at the many parking areas for campgrounds and other recreational attractions, and bicyclists make frequent use of Highway 82 as well. Lastly, the weather at the pass can be unpredictable and vary considerably from conditions in either Aspen or Twin Lakes. There may be thunderstorms on otherwise clear days, and snow can occur at any time of the year. CDOT advises anyone coming to the pass for outdoor recreation to take precautions against the effects of the high altitude and the changeable weather.|$|E
50|$|Timber Falls {{waterpark}} <b>passes</b> <b>are</b> {{not included}} in the room rates. <b>Passes</b> <b>are</b> $17 per person per day for hotel guest or $22 per person per day for non-hotel guests. <b>Passes</b> can <b>be</b> purchased at Timber Falls. Timber Falls is open to the public.|$|R

50|$|The <b>pass</b> <b>was</b> {{also the}} first major project of the young Thomas Bain. Once commenced, the entire 16 km <b>pass</b> <b>was</b> {{completed}} in only 223 days of work, opening on 3 March 1858.|$|R
5|$|Macdonald served {{just under}} 19 years as Prime Minister, {{a length of}} service only surpassed by William Lyon Mackenzie King. Unlike his American counterpart, George Washington, no cities or {{political}} subdivisions are named for Macdonald (with {{the exception of a}} small Manitoba village), nor are there any massive monuments. A peak in the Rockies, Mount Macdonald (c. 1887) at Rogers <b>Pass,</b> <b>is</b> named for him. In 2001, Parliament designated 11 January as Sir John A. Macdonald Day, but the day is not a federal holiday and generally passes unremarked. Since 1971, he has appeared on the Canadian ten-dollar note. In 2015, the Royal Canadian Mint featured Macdonald's face on the Canadian two dollar coin, the Toonie, to celebrate his 200th birthday. He also gives his name to Ottawa's Sir John A. Macdonald Parkway (River Parkway before 2012), Ottawa Macdonald–Cartier International Airport (renamed in 1993) and Ontario Highway 401 (the Macdonald–Cartier Freeway c. 1968), though these facilities are rarely referred to using his name.|$|E
5|$|The Lothian 'Ridacard' bus <b>pass</b> <b>is</b> a {{pre-paid}} plastic smartcard giving unlimited {{travel on}} regular daytime and night bus services, {{as well as}} Edinburgh Trams services. It is purchased initially from a Transport for Edinburgh Travelshop, where the owner's picture is incorporated on the card to prevent misuse. Once purchased, the card can be placed onto an on-board reader, which reads the contactless chip in the smartcard. Cards can be credited for a weekly, 4 weekly or annual period. A warning is displayed on the last five days of validity. The card can then be topped up at Transport for Edinburgh Travelshops or Pay Point equipped retailers.|$|E
5|$|Unfortunately, {{having been}} {{preoccupied with the}} nerd situation, Homer is not {{prepared}} for his final exam. The nerds say {{the only way to}} <b>pass</b> <b>is</b> to cram for the final exam, which they help him do. However, despite Homer's best attempts, he gets an F. To Homer's delight, the nerds hack into the school's student records and change his grade to an A+, but unfortunately, Marge finds out and forces Homer to take the course again in order to set a good example for Bart and Lisa. Homer's next college experience is shown during the end credits, with college clichés such as hazing by a fraternity, phonebooth stuffing, a food fight, and finally his graduation ceremony where Homer flashes the audience.|$|E

5|$|When the <b>pass</b> <b>is</b> open in warmer weather, it is {{a popular}} destination. A scenic {{overlook}} near the pass allows visitors {{to take in the}} alpine tundra environment above treeline, and offers excellent views to the east of Mount Elbert, Colorado's highest peak and the second-highest mountain in the contiguous United States. Rock climbers are drawn to nearby bouldering opportunities, and informal paths lead to nearby mountain summits of even higher elevation. Backcountry skiers make use of the slopes during the late spring and early summer. Since 2011 the pass has been on the route of the USA Pro Cycling Challenge.|$|E
5|$|Although Snake <b>Pass</b> <b>is</b> {{still the}} {{shortest}} route between Manchester and Sheffield, the more northerly Woodhead Pass, {{which is less}} steep and at a lower altitude, is now the primary road link between the two cities. Unlike Snake Pass, the Woodhead route is a trunk road. Traffic levels on both passes remained similar until the 1980s, but the Woodhead Pass route is now favoured as it connects directly to the M1, while Snake Pass leads into the centre of Sheffield. Despite Sheffield and Manchester being among the largest UK cities by population, {{there is no direct}} motorway link between the two. A Manchester to Sheffield motorway was first proposed in 1966, and a small section bypassing Denton and Hyde has been built, now the M67. The Woodhead Tunnel was closed in 1981 in anticipation of a road replacement, but linking the cities would have meant constructing many costly tunnels and viaducts across the Peak District. Consequently, the plans were shelved, but reports in December 2014 announced a revival of the scheme.|$|E
5|$|In American football, passing, {{along with}} running (also {{referred}} to as rushing), {{is one of the}} two main methods of advancing the ball down the field. Passes are typically attempted by the quarterback, but any offensive player can attempt a pass provided they are behind the line of scrimmage. To qualify as a passing play, the ball must have initially moved forward after leaving the hands of the passer; if the ball initially moved laterally or backwards, the play would instead be considered a running play. A player who catches a forward <b>pass</b> <b>is</b> a receiver, and the number of receiving yards each player has recorded in each season is a recorded stat in football games. In addition to the overall National Football League (NFL) receiving champion, league record books recognize statistics from the American Football League (AFL), which operated from 1960 to 1969 before being absorbed into the NFL in 1970, Although league record books do not recognize stats from the All-America Football Conference, another league that merged with the NFL, these statistics are recognized by the Pro Football Hall of Fame.|$|E
