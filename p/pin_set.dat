A loyal servant of the crown, MR Pia introduced ML Pin to King Vajiravudh when he was seven years old. Another often-recounted story from his childhood is that of how, before having learned to count, when his mother asked him to gather half a bunch of betel leaves for her, ML <b>Pin</b> <b>set</b> down to picking up one leaf with each hand at a time, separating them equally into two piles.|$|E

Later that June, Skybound announced {{that at the}} following month's San Diego Comic-Con, it would debut action figures based on the two lead characters, Alana and Marko, by McFarlane Toys. The five-inch figures are issued together in a two-pack, and are paired with a mace and a sword. The company also teamed with Yesterdays, a Southern California collectible enamel pin company, to produce Skybound's first ever <b>pin</b> <b>set,</b> which includes two pins of Lying Cat and a pin of Ghüs, also to debut at that Comic-Con. The Ghüs pin is priced at $10.00, and the Lying Cat set at $15.00, and both were limited to 1000 units each.|$|E
6000|$|Afterwards Kari {{made many}} such {{ornaments}} which I sold for brooches with a <b>pin</b> <b>set</b> {{at the back}} of them. Also he shaped other things, for his skill as a goldsmith was wonderful, such as cups and platters of strange design and rich ornamentation which commanded a great price. But on every one of them, in the centre or some other part of the embossment, appeared this image of the sun. I asked him why. He answered because the sun was his god and his people were Sun-worshippers. I reminded him that he had said that a certain Pachacamac whose image he wore about his neck was his god.

60|$|Slipping off {{the cover}} of her box, Beth uttered a low cry of amazement and admiration. Then {{she held up a}} dainty lavalliere, with a pendant {{containing}} a superb pearl. Louise had the mate to this, but the one Patsy found had a pearl of immense size, its color being an exquisite shade of pink, such as is rarely seen. Arthur displayed a ring set with a splendid white pearl, while Uncle John's box contained a stick <b>pin</b> <b>set</b> with a huge black pearl of remarkable luster. Indeed, they saw at a glance that the size and beauty of all these pearls were very uncommon, and while the others expressed their enthusiastic delight, the faces of Mr. Merrick and Patsy Doyle were solemn and perplexed. They stared at the pearls with feelings of dismay, rather than joy, and chancing to meet one another's eyes they quickly dropped their gaze to avoid exchanging the ugly suspicion that had forced itself upon their minds.|$|E
60|$|The {{friend was}} a charming {{young man of}} {{not much more than}} fifty, dressed in a very bright blue coat with resplendent buttons, black trousers, and the {{thinnest}} possible pair of highly-polished boots. A gold eye-glass was suspended from his neck by a short, broad, black ribbon; a gold snuff-box was lightly clasped in his left hand; gold rings innumerable glittered on his fingers; and a large diamond <b>pin</b> <b>set</b> in gold glistened in his shirt frill. He had a gold watch, and a gold curb chain with large gold seals; and he carried a pliant ebony cane with a gold top. His linen was of the very whitest, finest, and stiffest; his wig of the glossiest, blackest, and curliest. His snuff was princes' mixture; his scent BOUQUET DU ROI. His features were contracted into a perpetual smile; and his teeth were in such perfect order that it was difficult at a small distance to tell the real from the false.|$|E

40|$|The LMP 7300 is a {{combination}} comparator and reference with ideal specifications for precision threshold detecting. The precision 2. 048 V reference comes with a 0. 25 % maximum error. The comparator features micropower (35 µW), low offset voltage (0. 75 mV max), and independent adjustable positive and negative hysteresis. Hysteresis control for the comparator is accomplished through two external pins. The HYSTP <b>pin</b> <b>sets</b> the positive hysteresis and the HYSTN <b>pin</b> <b>sets</b> the negative hysteresis. The comparator design isolates the V IN source impedance and the programmable hysteresis components. This isolation prevents any undesirable interaction allowing the IC to maintain a precise threshold voltage during level detection. The combination of low offset voltage, external hysteresis control, and precision voltage reference provides an easy to use micropower precision threshold detector. The LMP 7300 open collector output makes it ideal for mixed voltage system designs. The output voltage upper rail is unconstrained by V CC and can be pulled above V CC {{to a maximum of}} 12 V. The LMP 7300 {{is a member of the}} LMP ® precision amplifier family...|$|R
40|$|The {{temperature}} {{dependence of the}} domain-wall coercive field of epitaxial magnetic garnet films was modified in a defined temperature range by removing the surface layer of the films. Outside the given temperature range the coercivity versus temperature curve did not change. The result supports a model of coercivity according to which different sets of material imperfections are responsible for pinning the domain walls in different temperature regions. Appropriate processing of the samples enables some of the <b>pinning</b> <b>sets</b> to be modified independently of each other...|$|R

50|$|The mani wheel, or hand prayer wheel, has a cylindrical, {{generally}} sheet-metal body (often beautifully embossed) {{mounted on}} a metal shaft or <b>pin</b> <b>set</b> into a wooden or metal handle that turns on a circular bearing commonly made of Turbinella (conch) shell. The cylinder itself is affixed with a cord or chain terminating in a metal weight allowing it to be spun by a slight rotation of the wrist. The weighted chain, known as a “governor” in Western technology, stabilizes the wheel and keeps it spinning with less input from the practitioner than would otherwise be the case. The common term, “prayer wheel” is a double misnomer. A long strip of rolled-up paper bearing printed or inscribed mantras (Tib. mani) rather than prayers, per se, is inside the cylinder. “Mill,” defined as “a spinning object that generates something,” is a better translation of the Tibetan ‘khor-lo than is “wheel” since {{it is thought that}} the spinning cylinder emanates positive energy, allowing the practitioner to accumulate wisdom and merit. The Tibetan name of this device is mani-chos-'khor (མ་ནི་ཆོས་འཁོར་).|$|E
40|$|We obtain box-counting {{estimates}} for the <b>pinned</b> distance <b>sets</b> of (dense subsets of) planar discrete Ahlfors-regular sets of exponent s> 1. As a corollary, we improve upon a recent result of Orponen, by showing that if A is Ahlfors-regular of dimension s> 1, then almost all <b>pinned</b> distance <b>sets</b> of A have lower box-counting dimension 1. We also show that if A,B⊂R^ 2 have Hausdorff dimension > 1 and A is Ahlfors-regular, then the set of distances between A and B has modified lower box-counting dimension 1, which taking B=A improves Orponen's result in a different direction, by lowering packing dimension to modified lower box-counting dimension. The proofs involve ergodic-theoretic ideas, relying on the theory of CP-processes and projections.
