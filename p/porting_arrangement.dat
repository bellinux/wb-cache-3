40|$|A {{portable}} wind sensitive directional air sampler {{was developed}} {{as part of}} an air pollution source identification system. The system is designed to identify sources of air pollution based on the directional collection of field air samples and their analysis for TSP and trace element characteristics. Sources can be identified by analyzing the data on the basis of pattern recognition concepts. The unit, designated Air Scout, receives wind direction signals from an associated wind vane. Air samples are collected on filter slides using a standard high volume air sampler drawing air through a <b>porting</b> <b>arrangement</b> which tracks the wind direction and permits collection of discrete samples. A preset timer controls the length of time each filter is in the sampling position. At the conclusion of the sampling period a new filter is automatically moved into sampling position displacing the previous filter to a storage compartment. Thus the Air Scout may be set up at a field location, loaded with up to 12 filter slides, and left to acquire air samples automatically, according to the wind, at any timer interval desired from 1 to 30 hours...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the development of}} calibration and data-reduction algorithms for non-conventional multi-hole pressure probes. The algorithms {{that have been developed}} for conventional 5 - and 7 -hole probes are not optimal for probes with <b>port</b> <b>arrangements</b> (on the probe tip) that are non-conventional. Conventional algorithms utilize the axisymmetry of the port distribution pattern to define the non-dimensional pressure coefficients. These coefficients are typically defined specifically for these patterns, but fail to correctly represent different patterns of <b>port</b> <b>arrangements,</b> such as patterns without axisymmetry or regularity. The algorithms introduced herein can handle any pattern of <b>port</b> <b>arrangement,</b> from axisymmetric and regular to random. Moreover, they eliminate the need to separate the measurement domain of a probe to "low-angle" and "high-angle" regimes, typical in conventional 5 - and 7 -hole-probe algorithms that require two different sets of pressure coefficient definitions and procedures. Additionally, the algorithms have been formulated such that they facilitate redundancy implementations, especially in applications where such redundancy is important, such as air-data systems. The developed algorithms are first applied to a non-conventional probe, a nearly omni-directional 18 -hole probe, and demonstrate very high flow measurement accuracy. Subsequently, the algorithms were applied to a new 12 -hole, nearly omni-directional, flow velocity measurement probe capable of measuring reversed flows. The new 12 -hole design offers several advantages over a previously developed, 18 -hole, nearly omni-directional probe. The probe is optimized in the sense that, regardless of the flow direction, it allows calculation of the 4 unknown flow quantities, i. e. the two flow angles, the velocity magnitude and the static pressure, with the minimum necessary number of holes/ports on the probe tip. This probe also has a non-conventional arrangement of its pressure ports and therefore the new calibration and data-reduction algorithms can be effectively employed. With theoretically generated pressure data for the 12 -hole probe, the coefficient definitions are analyzed and found to be well-behaved...|$|R

50|$|The first {{successful}} sleeve valve was patented by Charles Yale Knight, and used twin alternating sliding sleeves. It {{was used in}} some luxury automobiles, notably Willys, Daimler, Mercedes-Benz, Minerva, Panhard, Peugeot and Avions Voisin. Mors adopted double sleeve-valve engines made by Minerva.The higher oil consumption was heavily outweighed by the quietness of running and the very high mileages without servicing. Early poppet-valve systems required decarbonization at very low mileages. The Burt-McCollum sleeve valve was named for the two inventors that applied for similar patents {{within a few weeks}} of each other. The Burt system was an open sleeve type, driven from the crankshaft side, while the McCollum design had a sleeve in the head and upper part of the cylinder, and a more complex <b>port</b> <b>arrangement</b> (Source: 'Torque Meter' Magazine, AEHS). The design that entered production was more 'Burt' than 'McCollum.' It was used by the Scottish company Argyll for its cars, and was later adopted by Bristol for its radial aircraft engines. It used a single sleeve which rotated around a timing axle set at 90 degrees to the cylinder axis. Mechanically simpler and more rugged, the Burt-McCollum valve had the additional advantage of reducing oil consumption (compared to other sleeve valve designs), while retaining the combustion chambers and big, uncluttered, porting area possible in the Knight system.|$|R
40|$|Pure laparoscopic {{hepatectomy}} {{is a less}} {{invasive procedure}} than conventional open hepatectomy for the resection of hepatic lesions. Increases in experiences with the technique, in combination with advances in technology, have promoted the popularity of pure laparoscopic hepatectomy. However, indications for usage and potential contraindications of the procedure remain unresolved. The characteristics and specific advantages of the procedure, especially for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with chronic liver diseases, are reviewed and discussed in this paper. For cirrhotic patients with liver tumors, pure laparoscopic hepatectomy minimizes destruction of the collateral blood and lymphatic flow from laparotomy and mobilization, and mesenchymal injury from compression. Therefore, pure laparoscopic hepatectomy has the specific advantage of minimal postoperative ascites production that leads to lowering the risk of disturbance in water or electrolyte balance and hypoproteinemia. It minimizes complications that routinely trigger postoperative serious liver failure. Under adequate patient positioning and <b>port</b> <b>arrangement,</b> the partial resection of the liver {{in the area of}} subphrenic space, peri-inferior vena cava area or next to the attachment of retro-peritoneum is facilitated in pure laparoscopic surgery by providing good vision and manipulation in the small operative field.

These improved features are especially advantageous for patients with liver cirrhosis and multicentric and/or metachronous HCCs...|$|R

40|$|The bubble {{dynamics}} of a seismic airgun are investigated {{in relation to}} their use for shock testing naval vessels. A model-scale airgun is used to investigate the {{dynamics of}} a bubble generated at different standoffs from a steel plate and a free surface in an open top tank. The airgun is fired at 50 and 100 bar initial pressures. Field pressure, wall pressure and acceleration are measured, and the bubble is imaged using low- and highspeed photography. The behaviour of the bubble is described and the bubble growth is determined from shadowgraph photography and compared with the simultaneous pressure field signal. Four distinct bubbles are evident at the first bubble maximum {{as a result of the}} initial four jets of air. The Rayleigh–Taylor Instability is identified as playing a role in the bubble break up. The bubble and reverberant frequencies are identified using Wavelet and Fast Fourier transforms. The interaction of the bubble with the free surface is similar compared with other bubbles; however, the bubble is unaffected by the nearby wall for the standoffs tested. Only the initial shock generated by the airgun significantly impacts the wall, which moves in phase with the bubble pulsations. As a result of the movement, little pressure is felt at the wall from the pressure pulses generated by the bubble collapses. Despite the four <b>port</b> <b>arrangement,</b> the pressure signature of this airgun is not directional. An analytical model of the bubble dynamics is developed based on the Gilmore equation. Additional terms for modelling the presence of the airgun body, mass throttling, effective viscosity and heat diffusion are included and Gilmore’s model for the radiated pressure wave is used to predict the pressure field generated by the bubble. The results of this model compare favourably with the model-scale airgun data, with the exception of the initial shock and first maximum bubble velocity, which are over-predicted. Full-scale airgun pressure field measurements are predicted well by the model. Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics is investigated as a numerical method for modelling a pulsing seismic airgun bubble. Limitations are found in the available computational time and power, and in the ability to accurately model the gas-water interface. Some improvements are identified to enable modelling the bubble pulsation due to the pressure differential across the bubble surface...|$|R
