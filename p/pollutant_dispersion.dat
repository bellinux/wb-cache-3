The environmental standard of NO 2 {{was used as the}} indicator to calculate the largest development density because it is a crucial air pollutant source in Korea. The process of allocating development densities consisted of 3 steps; trajectory analysis, air <b>pollutants</b> <b>dispersion</b> analysis, and development densities allocation. First, trajectory analysis was applied to pre-development conditions such as emission volume and locations. The additional pollutants emission volume caused by new urban development was inputted to employ the air <b>pollutants</b> <b>dispersion</b> model. Secondly, the air <b>pollutants</b> <b>dispersion</b> model was used to identify concentrations of air pollutants dispersed by the additional pollutants. Comparing air pollutant concentrations with environmental standards, the suitable population density of the development area was calculated.

The results of the development density allocation model can be useful for preparing density and land-use maps in planning processes.

In a preliminary campaign held {{during the winter of}} 2012 with continuous gas releases, we had 12 ultrasonic anemometers measuring wind velocity and temperature at 10 Hz, and six photo-ionisation detectors measuring gas concentration at 50 Hz. Turbulence is verified to be anisotropic by calculating variances, integral length scales and power spectra of velocity. Some evidence of a − 1 power law sub-range has been found in velocity power spectra. Also, we have deduced eddy advection velocity from spatial velocity cross-correlation and found it greater than mean wind speed measured directly by sensors. Concentration measurements are corrected by using a baseline method. Significant relationships between concentration and turbulence measurements at high frequency are still under further study...|$|R
