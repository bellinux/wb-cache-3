2500|$|Initially, only {{a single}} {{reconnaissance}} (S) variant was considered, but fitting cameras {{as well as a}} radar proved to be impossible. The SH 37 maritime strike and reconnaissance variant was very similar to the AJ 37 and differed mainly in a maritime-optimized PS 371/A radar with longer range, a cockpit air-data camera and tape recorder for mission analysis. [...] "Red Baron" [...] and a SKa 24D 600 mm LOROP camera pods were usually carried on the fuselage pylons. The centreline fuel tank was converted {{for a short period of}} time to a camera pod with two Recon/Optical CA-200 1676mm cameras. In addition to the reconnaissance equipment, the SH 37 could also use all weapons for the AJ 37. For the photographic SF version, the radar in the nose was omitted in favour of four SKa 24C 120mm and two SKa 31 570mm <b>photographic</b> <b>cameras</b> as well as one 57 mm VKa 702 Infrared linescan camera and air-data camera; all of which were integrated with and controlled by the aircraft's central computer. Additional equipment, such as more camera pods, fuel tanks, ECM pods, and self-defense air-to-air missiles could also be carried upon the fuselage pylons.|$|E

60|$|This {{room was}} grotesquely latter-day in its appointments. In the centre {{was a bright}} oval lit by shaded {{electric}} lights from above. The rest was in shadow, and the double finely fitting doors through which he came from the swarming Hall of the Atlas made the place very still. The dead thud of these as they closed behind him, the sudden cessation of the tumult {{in which he had}} been living for hours, the quivering circle of light, the whispers and quick noiseless movements of vaguely visible attendants in the shadows, had a strange effect upon Graham. The huge ears of a phonographic mechanism gaped in a battery for his words, the black eyes of great <b>photographic</b> <b>cameras</b> awaited his beginning, beyond metal rods and coils glittered dimly, and something whirled about with a droning hum. He walked into the centre of the light, and his shadow drew together black and sharp to a little blot at his feet.|$|E

40|$|Digital aerial {{photogrammetry}} has {{the virtue of}} high precision and efficiency, but the plane array of single digital camera is not wide enough, so the land coverage and base-height ratio of single digital camera is smaller than the traditional film camera. So people always array several single digital cameras (usually two or four) together as one camera, and it’s called multiple plane array digital <b>photographic</b> <b>camera</b> or mosaic camera, the angle of single digital camera is not level as usual, it circumgyrates around it’s own axis of lens to get large land coverage, {{and it has become}} the focus in recent research. The tilting angle of single camera is the most important parameter in multiple plane array digital <b>photographic</b> <b>camera</b> system; it determines the image quality and the useful land coverage (effective virtual picture format). The image distortion caused by camera incline was studied particularly in the process of multi-lens aerial digital camera exterior marriage in this paper. The formulas on the GSD change ratio of any pixel caused by camera incline in two-mosaic, four-mosaic(DMC) and film camera were deduced and calculated. It has important significance in the design of multiple plane array digital <b>photographic</b> <b>camera.</b> 1...|$|R

50|$|The {{earliest}} daguerreotype (invented 1839) <b>photographic</b> <b>cameras</b> did {{not have}} shutters, because the lack of sensitivity {{of the process and}} the small apertures of available lenses meant that exposure times were measured in many minutes.

40|$|To {{eliminate}} the serious vignetting phenomenon and {{to solve the}} difficulty of choosing a relatively positioning target value problems among CCDs during the radiometric calibration of the whole image plane of the <b>photographic</b> <b>camera</b> with a composite plane array CCD, a method for radiometric calibration of multi-CCDs was proposed. After the dark signal calibration on each pixel, the gray value of the pixel in the vignetting area was revised, and by choosing the appropriate relative calibration target gray value of the whole image plane, the radiometric calibration of the <b>photographic</b> <b>camera</b> with a composite plane array CCD was eventually completed. Through analysis of the gray distribution characteristics of vignetting area, the gray correction method {{for all kinds of}} explosion time and radiance was proposed. With calculation of fitting coefficient between each CCD gray value and the input radiance respectively, the coefficient with global minimum fitting error was chosen to calculate the relative calibration target gray value corresponding to radiance. After the radiometric calibration using this method, the non-uniformity of the whole image plane of the <b>photographic</b> <b>camera</b> with a composite plane array CCD is reduced from above 20 % to better than 2 %, and the accuracy of the absolute calibration is 4. 23 %. The result indicates that the proposed calibration method is appropriate for the calibration of composite planes array CCD. The accuracy of the calibration satisfies the radiometric calibration requirement of aerial cameras. © 2017, Science Press. All right reserved. </p...|$|R
