50|$|Gresford Colliery finally {{closed on}} {{economic}} grounds in November 1973. In the 1980s {{the site was}} redeveloped as an industrial estate. In 1982 a memorial {{to the victims of}} the disaster was erected nearby; it was constructed using a wheel from the old <b>pit-head</b> <b>winding</b> <b>gear.</b> The last direct link to the disaster, Mr Eddie Edwards, who began work in the mine aged 14, and who participated in the rescue efforts, died on 6 January 2016, aged 102.|$|E
50|$|The town {{lies on the}} Grantham Canal, {{opened in}} 1797. Some {{exploration}} for coal had been attempted {{for a hundred years}} but none was discovered in the area until about 1950. Cotgrave Colliery was established in the early 1960s with large numbers of miners and their families being moved from other mining areas of England, especially the North East, to live on a large purpose-built housing estate. Initially, in 1962, around 500 experienced mining workers and their families, accepted the National Coal Board incentive of tied new houses complete with furnishings to move from the area of the recently closed Radford Mine on the north-west side of nearby Nottingham. This mine was near the site of what is now known as Bobber's Mill. Some four years later a similar scheme was introduced to attract miners from other worked-out mines in the North East of England, including Gateshead. It is interesting to note that, according to residents, special meetings were arranged so that workers already established could understand, for safety reasons, the dialect, and vice versa, of the newcomers. The population of the village rose from about 700 to over 5,000 within a few years. A branch railway was extended from Nottingham over the River Trent past Radcliffe on Trent to service the colliery. The koepe towers at the pit head were considered very modern and distinctive compared with other <b>pit-head</b> <b>winding</b> <b>gear</b> towers. In a departure from traditional miners' working conditions, face workers had extensive modern changing and shower facilities, which meant they could leave as clean as they entered.|$|E

50|$|A winze {{is a minor}} {{connection}} between different levels in an underground mine. When worked upwards from a lower level it is usually called a raise; when sunk downward from a higher level it may be called a sump. The top of a winze is located underground {{and it is not}} equipped with <b>winding</b> <b>gear,</b> in contrast to a shaft, which is a deeper {{connection between}} levels and does have <b>winding</b> <b>gear,</b> whether the top of the excavation is located on the surface or underground.|$|R

2500|$|The Pwllyrhebog Colliery incline on {{the former}} Taff Vale Railway was a [...] 1-in-13 incline with a {{continuous}} rope cable so that a descending train was partially counterbalanced by an ascending train. The locomotives (Taff Vale Railway H class) on the incline were fitted with coned boilers {{so that there was}} always sufficient water above the firebox. To provide additional control and power a stationary locomotive, fitted with two intergeared drums, controlled the cable. No. 2750 Class 2721 had been fitted with the necessary <b>winding</b> <b>gear</b> to control the incline in 1935, but was withdrawn in 1945, and replaced by 5700 No. 7722 which was fitted with the <b>winding</b> <b>gear</b> in 1946. Operation of the incline ended in 1952.|$|R
5000|$|Winding and pumping plant, No. 1 shaft, {{comprises}} vertical Tangye boiler of , steaming horizontal Tangye engine, with <b>winding</b> <b>gear</b> attached; also pumping gear, {{working two}} 18 in by 5 pumps, with two connecting rods (of steam gas pipe) and 3 in delivery pipe. The rods rest on friction pulleys, the shaft going {{down on the}} underlay of lode at an angle of 45deg. The pump draws the water from depth of 437 ft in one column. A substantial steel tramway is laid {{from top to bottom}} of the shaft upon which the trucks are hauled by means of steel-wire rope attached to drum of the <b>winding</b> <b>gear.</b> This plant is entirely under a substantially-built wooden shed, covered with galvanized iron.|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} {{historical}} {{remnants of the}} coal mining past {{to be seen in}} the Park, including colliery coal trams, and pit <b>winding</b> <b>gear</b> which forms part of a monument {{in the northern part of}} the Park. In 1985 a Visitor Centre was established at the Park.|$|R
50|$|The old village well {{stands to}} the east of the town centre in Woodmansterne Lane. It is almost 300 feet (90 m) deep and was last used around the end of the 19th century. The {{wellhead}} cover dates from the 18th century and still contains the <b>winding</b> <b>gear.</b>|$|R

50|$|A {{rescue team}} entered {{the main shaft}} but damage meant the <b>winding</b> <b>gear</b> could only reach 295 yards down. John Harris climbed down guide ropes and rescued several men.

50|$|A {{portable}} {{steam engine}} and portable boiler on site {{are now the}} only such surviving examples recorded in the Gilberton locality. The wet bottom portable boiler is possibly of United States origin and is early and rare. It is the only wet bottom boiler recorded in North Queensland, and was probably used to power <b>winding</b> <b>gear.</b>|$|R
50|$|The former {{colliery}} site {{now has the}} Canolfan sheltered housing complex, and the Ysticlau Park playing field. Some {{history of}} the village still remains, with the pit head <b>winding</b> <b>gear</b> sunk in the ground next {{to the site of}} the old colliery, and five pairs of preserved sections of railway line indicating the size of the enterprise.|$|R
25|$|Further {{development}} work {{was required to}} enable the mine to be worked systematically and the Rogers' Golden Gate produced 3,295 tons of quartz yielding 3,947 ounces of gold in 1900. The mine was worked with two stem engines of eight and ten horsepower, two sets of double <b>winding</b> <b>gear,</b> one steam pump, and one whip, valued at £850. In 1902 additional plant was erected including three steam engines {{with a total of}} 51 horsepower, one single and two sets of double <b>winding</b> <b>gear.</b> The straight shaft was done to 510 feet and the underlie of the extended shaft down to 531 feet. The mine kept 15 head of stamps at the Golden Gate mill constantly employed. The mine was partly tributed in 1904 with the tributers doing well. In 1906 Rogers' Golden Gate was the Golden Gate line's largest producer - 2,000 tons for 10,527 ounces by the tributers.|$|R
500|$|In 1981 a {{memorial}} to those lost in the disaster was unveiled by the National Coal Board. Based outside Nant-y-parc Primary School, which is built {{on the site of}} the former colliery, the monument is a [...] high replica of the colliery's <b>winding</b> <b>gear.</b> A second monument was unveiled in 2006 to the dead from both the 1901 and 1913 explosions.|$|R
50|$|The Great Extended Ravenswood Mining Company {{spent over}} £2,000 on surface plant (headframe, <b>winding</b> <b>gear</b> and two engines), and the shaft was sunk to 209m on the {{vertical}} {{and to a}} further 30.5m on the underlie once the lode was intersected. Although one assay was of 5,000 ozs of silver to the ton, results were disappointing compared with the adjacent King's mine.|$|R
50|$|In 1981 a {{memorial}} to those lost in the disaster was unveiled by the National Coal Board. Based outside Nant-y-parc Primary School, which is built {{on the site of}} the former colliery, the monument is a 20 ft high replica of the colliery's <b>winding</b> <b>gear.</b> A second monument was unveiled in 2006 to the dead from both the 1901 and 1913 explosions.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} of the shed housing the <b>winding</b> <b>gear</b> contains the double drum winding engine with cable extant on the drums, a platform and controls for the driver, a large electric motor and electrical switch gear including the main circuit breaker for underground. These are all intact. The floor is concrete except where the cable spools are located; here the floor is dirt.|$|R
