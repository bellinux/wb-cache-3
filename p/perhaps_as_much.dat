In 46 BC Caesar lost <b>perhaps</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as {{a third of his}} army, but {{ultimately}} came back to defeat the Pompeian army of Metellus Scipio in the Battle of Thapsus, after which the Pompeians retreated yet again to Hispania.

5|$|A {{good picture}} of the county in 1086 is given by Domesday Book, though there is some {{difficulty}} in identifying the various places since the hundreds are not specified. The total population given for the county, which had different boundaries to those today, was 13,399, however this only included the heads of households, so with their families {{this may have been}} around 67,000. Farming seems to have prospered for the next three centuries but was severely hit by the Black Death which in 1348 arrived in Dorset and quickly spread through Somerset, causing widespread mortality, <b>perhaps</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as 50% in places. It re-occurred, resulting in a change in feudal practices since the manpower was no longer so available.|$|E
5|$|Pompey's death {{did not see}} the end of {{the civil}} wars since {{initially}} Caesar's enemies were manifold and Pompey's supporters continued to fight on after his death. In 46 BC Caesar lost <b>perhaps</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as a third of his army when his former commander Titus Labienus, who had defected to the Pompeians several years earlier, defeated him at the Battle of Ruspina. However, after this low point Caesar came back to defeat the Pompeian army of Metellus Scipio in the Battle of Thapsus, after which the Pompeians retreated yet again to Iberia. Caesar defeated the combined forces of Titus Labienus and Gnaeus Pompey the Younger at the Battle of Munda in Iberia. Labienus was killed in the battle and the Younger Pompey captured and executed.|$|E

5|$|The baronial revolt {{was crushed}} between 1266 and 1267, leaving de Clare free to advance north into Glamorgan from his main base in Cardiff. De Clare started to {{construct}} a castle at Caerphilly to control his new gains in 1268. The castle lay in a basin of the Rhymney Valley, alongside the Rhymney River and {{at the heart of}} network of paths and roads, adjacent to a former Roman fort. Work began at a huge pace, with ditches cut to form the basic shape of the castle, temporary wooden palisades erected and extensive water defences created by damming a local stream. The walls and internal buildings were built at speed, forming {{the main part of the}} castle. The architect of the castle and the precise cost of the construction are unknown, but modern estimates suggest that it could have cost as much as castles such as Conwy or Caernarfon, <b>perhaps</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as £19,000, a huge sum for the period.|$|E
5|$|He {{concluded}} that the caudofemoralis muscles which link the tail bones and the upper leg bones could have assisted Tyrannosaurus in leg retraction and enhanced its running ability, agility and balance. The caudofemoralis muscle {{would have been a}} key muscle in femoral retraction; pulling back the leg at the femur. The study also found that theropod skeletons such as those of Tyrannosaurus had adaptations (such as elevated transverse processes in the tail vertebrae) to enable the growth of larger tail muscles and that Tyrannosaurus's tail muscle mass may have been underestimated by over 25 percent and <b>perhaps</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as 45 percent. The caudofemoralis muscle was found to comprise 58 percent of the muscle mass in the tail of Tyrannosaurus. Tyrannosaurus also had the largest absolute and relative caudofemoralis muscle mass out of the three extinct organisms in the study. This is because Tyrannosaurus also had additional adaptations to enable large tail muscles; the elongation of its tail's hemal arches. According to Persons, the increase in tail muscle mass would have moved the center of mass closer to the hindquarters and hips which would have lessened the strain on the leg muscles to support its weight; improving its overall balance and agility. This would also have made the animal less front-heavy, thus reducing rotational inertia. Persons also notes that the tail is also rich in tendons and septa which could have been stores of elastic energy, and thereby improved locomotive efficiency. Persons adds that this means non-avian theropods actually had broader tails than previously depicted, as broad or broader laterally than dorsoventrally near the base.|$|E

25|$|Clinical studies {{consistently}} {{conclude that}} morphine, like other opioids, often causes hypogonadism and hormone imbalances in chronic users of both sexes. This side effect is dose-dependent and occurs in both therapeutic and recreational users. Morphine {{can interfere with}} menstruation in women by suppressing levels of luteinizing hormone. Many studies suggest the majority (<b>perhaps</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as 90%) of chronic opioid users have opioid-induced hypogonadism. This effect may cause the increased likelihood of osteoporosis and bone fracture observed in chronic morphine users. Studies suggest the effect is temporary. , the effect of low-dose or acute use of morphine on the endocrine system is unclear.|$|E

25|$|The {{history of}} the Jews in the Roman Empire traces the {{interaction}} of Jews and Romans {{during the period of}} the Roman Empire (27 BC – AD 476). Their cultures began to overlap in the centuries just before the Christian Era. Jews, as part of the Jewish diaspora, migrated to Rome and Roman Europe from the Land of Israel, Asia Minor, Babylon and Alexandria in response to economic hardship and incessant warfare over the land of Israel between the Ptolemaic and Seleucid empires. In Rome, Jewish communities enjoyed privileges and thrived economically, becoming {{a significant part of the}} Empire's population (<b>perhaps</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as ten percent).|$|E
25|$|The {{population}} of Scotland grew steadily in the 19th century, from 1,608,000 in the census of 1801 to 2,889,000 in 1851 and 4,472,000 in 1901. Even {{with the development}} of industry there were insufficient good jobs; as a result, during the period 1841-1931, about 2 million Scots migrated to North America and Australia, and another 750,000 Scots relocated to England. Scotland lost a much higher proportion of its population than England and Wales, reaching <b>perhaps</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as 30.2 per cent of its natural increase from the 1850s onwards. This not only limited Scotland's population increase, but meant that almost every family lost members due to emigration and, because more of the migrants were young males, it skewed the sex and age ratios of the country.|$|E
25|$|Clinical {{studies have}} {{consistently}} associated medical and recreational opioid use with hypogonadism and hormone imbalance in different sexes. The effect is dose-dependent. Most {{studies suggest that}} the majority (<b>perhaps</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as 90%) of chronic opioid users suffer hormone imbalances. Opioids can also interfere with menstruation in women by limiting the production of luteinizing hormone (LH). Opioid-induced endocrinopathy likely causes the strong association of opioid use with osteoporosis and bone fracture. It also may increase pain and thereby interfere with the intended clinical effect of opioid treatment. Opioid-induced endocrinopathy is likely caused by their agonism of opioid receptors in the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland. One study found that the depressed testosterone levels of heroin addicts returned to normal within one month of abstinence, suggesting that the effect is not permanent. , the effect of low-dose or acute opiate use on the endocrine system is unclear.|$|E

25|$|For {{several centuries}} of the Medieval era, the {{vineyards}} of Germany (including Alsace) expanded, and {{is believed to}} have reached their greatest extent sometime around 1500, when <b>perhaps</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as four times the present vineyard surface was planted. Basically, the wine regions were located in the same places as today, but more lands around the rivers, and land further upstream Rhine's tributaries, was cultivated. The subsequent decline can be attributed to locally produced beer becoming the everyday beverage in northern Germany in the 16th century, leading to a partial loss of market for wine, to the Thirty Years' War ravaging Germany in the 17th century, to the dissolution of the monasteries, where much of the wine-making know-how was concentrated, in those areas that accepted the Protestant reformation, and to the climatic changes of the Little Ice Age that made viticulture difficult or impossible in marginal areas.|$|E
