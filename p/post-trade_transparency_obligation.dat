Transparency has little effect without market incentives. <b>Post-trade</b> <b>transparency</b> benefits both large and small investors by lowering transaction costs. • Transparency results in market insights, some of which are not consistent with anecdotal evidence. • The trade reporting that accompanies <b>post-trade</b> <b>transparency</b> provides regulators such as the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) with tools to regulate more effectively...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper offers}} a new {{framework}} {{for the assessment of}} financial market liquidity and identifies two types: search liquidity and systemic liquidity. Search liquidity, i. e. liquidity in “normal” times, is driven by search costs required for a trader to find a willing buyer for an asset he/she is trying to sell or vice versa. Search liquidity is asset specific. Systemic liquidity, i. e. liquidity in “stressed” times, is driven by the homogeneity of investors - the degree to which one’s decision to sell is related to the decision to sell made by other market players at the same time. Systemic liquidity is specific to market participants’ behaviour. This framework proves fairly powerful in identifying the role of credit derivatives and transparency for liquidity of corporate bond markets. We have applied it to the illiquid segments of the European credit market and found that credit derivatives are likely to improve search liquidity as well as systemic liquidity. However, it is possible that in their popular use today, credit derivatives reinforce a concentration of positions that can worsen systemic liquidity. We also found that <b>post-trade</b> <b>transparency</b> has surprisingly little bearing on liquidity in that where it improves liquidity it is merely acting as a proxy for pre-trade transparency or transparency of holdings. We conclude that if liquidity is the objective, pre-trade transparency, as well as some delayed transparency on net exposures and concentrations, is likely to be more supportive of both search and systemic liquidity than <b>post-trade</b> <b>transparency.</b> JEL Classification: G 14, G 15, G 18.

In particular, we show that dealers operating in a transparent structure set regret-free prices at each period making zero expected profits in each of the two trading rounds, whereas in the opaque market dealers invest in acquiring information {{at the beginning of the}} trading day. Moreover, we obtain that if there is no trading activity in the first period, then market makers only change their quotes in the opaque market. Additionally, we show that trade disclosure increases the informational efficiency of transaction prices and reduces volatility. Finally, concerning welfare of market participants, we obtain ambiguous results. Keywords: Market microstructure, <b>Post-trade</b> <b>transparency,</b> Price experimentation, Price dispersion.

40|$|The new European {{framework}} directive contains {{a number of}} policy objectives {{in the area of}} net neutrality. In support of these objectives, the universal service directive includes a <b>transparency</b> <b>obligation</b> for ISPs. This paper proposes a multi-stakeholder model for the implementation of this <b>transparency</b> <b>obligation.</b> The model is a multi-stakeholder model {{in the sense that it}} treats the content and form of the transparent information in close connection with the parties involved in the provision of the information and the processes in which they take part. Another crucial property of the model is that it distinguishes between technical and user-friendly information. This distinction makes it possible to limit the obligation to ISPs to the information for which they are in the best position to provide: the technical information on the traffic management measures that they apply, e. g., which traffic streams are subject to special treatment? Which measures are applied and when? The public availability of this technical information creates the opportunity for the other parties in the model to step in and contribute to the formulation of the user-friendly information for end users: which applications and services receive special treatment? When is their effect noticeable? It is expected that the involvement of other parties will lead to multiple, complementary routes for the formulation of the user-friendly information. Thus, the user-friendly information emerges in ways driven by market players and stakeholders that would be difficult to design and lay down in advance in the <b>transparency</b> <b>obligation.</b> [...] net neutrality,transparency,traffic management...|$|R
40|$|The European {{bond market}} {{is made up}} of many {{segments}} characterised by varying levels of liquidity and of pre- and <b>post-trade</b> <b>transparency.</b> The possibility of extending the transparency provisions envisioned in the Directive 2004 / 39 /EC, disciplining the functioning of markets in financial instruments in Europe (MiFID), from the equity to the bond market is currently being discussed. This poses risks to the status quo through trading fragmentation and strong negotiating power of a few large dealers, particularly with respect to small retail investors. The main conclusion of the paper is that if MiFID transparency rules are to be extended to the bond market, this must be "real" transparency, meaning pre-trade dissemination of real-time executable prices and a transparent order book. Under current provisions, this kind of information is available if not directly to everybody, at least directly to dealers and indirectly to professional and retail clients through business-to-business electronic platform...|$|R

40|$|The {{principle}} of transparency in EU law’ explores a variety of <b>transparency</b> <b>obligations</b> in European law, and offers a comprehensive framework to classify and understand those obligations. The {{principle of}} transparency is ubiquitous and multifaceted. The obligations derived from it range from a duty to allow access to documents held by the EU-institutions to a prohibition to change {{the terms of a}} contract concluded after a procurement procedure. But although transparency is a diffuse concept, it has a distinct core: the concept refers to the availability, accessibility and clarity of information. However, the concept of transparency does not in itself determine the target and the timing of <b>transparency</b> <b>obligations,</b> nor does it tell us much about the acceptability of exceptions, and whether information should be provided pro-actively or on request. The author provides a method to determine the exact nature of the <b>transparency</b> <b>obligations</b> that can be derived from the {{principle of transparency}} in concrete situations. She explains how the application of the EU principle of transparency is affected by the manner in which transparency contributes to the realisation of a variety of goals, the context in which it is applied, and the presence of conflicting interests. The key to understanding the principle of transparency is appreciating its instrumental value. By being transparent, governments can promote democracy and individual rights, and improve economic performance. These goals are realised by means of two related but distinct mechanisms. First, transparency aids people in decision-making. Second, it allows them to see what is going on inside government. As such it is a precondition for any attempt to affect what is going on inside that government. Understanding how transparency functions is insufficient though: whether there is an obligation to be transparent is determined by the normative framework that governs the relation between the government and its citizens. This framework differs depending on whether this relation is perceived as one involving the citoyen, homo economicus, or homo dignus. For the citoyen, the overarching principle governing its relation with the government is democracy. For homo economicus, it is the promotion of the internal market and the Treaty freedoms. For homo dignus, it is the respect for human rights. The contents of the principle of transparency are determined by these higher-order principles. Because of that, we can only derive those particular <b>transparency</b> <b>obligations</b> from it that do in fact contribute to the realisation of the state that is embodied in those higher order principles. Because transparency always functions in the same two distinct ways to bring about its positive effects – it facilitates decision-making and allows outsiders to see what public authorities are doing – our understanding of {{the manner in which it}} functions provides us with a way to determine what concrete <b>transparency</b> <b>obligations</b> we can derive from the principle of transparency, provided we know what effects the law requires us to achieve by its observance...|$|R

40|$|The {{efficiency}} of the Iberian Energy Derivatives Market in its first {{five and a half}} years is assessed in terms of volume, open interest and price. The continuous market shows steady liquidity growth. Its volume is strongly correlated to that of the Over The Counter (OTC) market, the amount of market makers, the enrolment of financial agents and generation companies belonging to the integrated group of last resort suppliers, and the OTC cleared volume in its clearing house. The hedging efficiency, measured through the ratio between the final open interest and the cleared volume, shows the lowest values for the Spanish base load futures as they are the most liquid contracts. The ex-post forward risk premium has diminished due to the learning curve and the effect of the fixed price retributing the indigenous coal fired generation.
