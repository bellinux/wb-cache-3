5|$|The {{orientation}} and placement of many structures within Ambohimanga were copied from Ambohimanga's older twin city, the rova at Antananarivo, which likewise embodies both traditional notions of space. The {{placement of the}} city of Ambohimanga relative to Antananarivo also reflects these systems. Centrally located Antananarivo is the nation's <b>political</b> <b>capital</b> today, and Ambohimanga to its northeast is regarded as the spiritual capital.|$|E
5|$|An ancient carved {{slab of slate}} {{depicting}} {{an animal}} {{very similar to the}} blue wildebeest has been discovered. Dating back to around 3000 BC, it was found in Hierakonopolis (Nekhen), which used to be the religious and <b>political</b> <b>capital</b> of Upper Egypt at that time. This may be evidence that the animal used to occur in North Africa and was associated with the ancient Egyptians.|$|E
5|$|Its {{position}} was formed through constitutional convention, making {{its status as}} de facto capital {{a part of the}} UK's unwritten constitution. The capital of England was moved to London from Winchester as the Palace of Westminster developed in the 12th and 13th centuries to become the permanent location of the royal court, and thus the <b>political</b> <b>capital</b> of the nation. More recently, Greater London has been defined as a region of England and in this context is known as London.|$|E

5|$|Upon Andriamasinavalona's {{death in}} 1710, Imerina split into four warring {{quadrants}} and Antananarivo was made {{the capital of}} the southern district. During the 77-year civil war that followed, the eastern district's capital at Ambohimanga rose in prominence. The last king of Ambohimanga, Andrianampoinimerina, successfully conquered Antananarivo in 1793; he reunited the provinces of Imerina, ending the civil war. He moved the kingdom's <b>political</b> <b>capital</b> back to Antananarivo in 1794, and declared Ambohimanga the kingdom's spiritual capital, a role it still maintains. Andrianampoinimerina created a large marketplace in Analakely, establishing the city's economic center.|$|E
5|$|In {{the middle}} of this period, through a process of conquest, {{consolidation}} and treaty, the boundaries of Scotland were gradually extended from a small area under direct control of the kings of Alba in the east, to almost its modern borders. For most of the Medieval era the monarchy and court was itinerant, with Scone and Dunfermline acting as important centres and later Roxburgh, Stirling and Perth, before Edinburgh emerged as the <b>political</b> <b>capital</b> in the fourteenth century. Largely as a result of Viking raids from about 800, Iona declined as a religious centre. Despite royal attempts to establish a new religious centre at Dunkeld, it was St. Andrews on the east coast, close to the heartland of Pictish settlement, that emerged as the most important religious focus of the kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the conquest}} of Antananarivo in 1793, Andrianampoinimerina shifted the <b>political</b> <b>capital</b> of Imerina from Ambohimanga to its {{original}} site at Antananarivo, while pronouncing Ambohimanga the kingdom's spiritual capital. Important traditional rituals continued {{to be held at}} Ambohimanga, and Andrianampoinimerina regularly stayed in its Mahandrihono palace. His son, Radama I, inhabited Ambohimanga's Nanjakana compound as a youth before relocating to Antananarivo, and visited Ambohimanga frequently after the move. Radama's widow and successor, Ranavalona I, renovated the Mahandrihono compound and moved several buildings from the sister rova at Antananarivo to Ambohimanga. She also forbade swine at Ambohimanga due to their association with Europeans, who had propagated pork as a food source in the decade prior. Subsequent queens made their own mark on the site, including the reconstruction of Nanjakana by Rasoherina, and Ranavalona II's addition of two large pavilions to the Mahandrihono compound that reflected a syncretism of traditional and Western architectural styles.|$|E
40|$|London {{continues}} to dominate British public life, with political decision-making centralised {{to an almost}} unbelievable degree.

50|$|Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar, the {{commercial}} and <b>political</b> <b>capitals</b> of Gujarat respectively, were established {{on the banks of}} Sabarmati river. The legend is that Sultan Ahmed Shah of Gujarat, resting on the bank of Sabarmati, was inspired by the courage of a rabbit chasing a dog to the extent of establishing Ahmedabad in 1411. The soils of the Sabarmati area {{on the banks of the}} river are rich.|$|R
5|$|Among the {{buildings}} extant {{at the royal}} city {{during the time of}} King Andrianampoinimerina (1787–1810), only the original Mahandrihono palace remains intact. The Mahandrihono palace, which served as the home of Andrianampoinimerina before he relocated the <b>political</b> <b>capital</b> of Imerina to Antananarivo, has been preserved in its original state since construction, excepting the replacement of the original roof thatch with wooden shingles. The simple wooden structure is constructed in the traditional style of the aristocracy of Imerina: the walls are made of solid rosewood and topped by a peaked roof that is supported by 10-meter central rosewood pillar, much like the one that had originally supported the roof of the Rova Manjakamiadana of Antananarivo before it was destroyed by fire in 1995. The roof horns (tandrotrano) formed {{at each end of the}} roof peak by the crossing of the gable beams were originally silver-plated, and a silver eagle was affixed in the middle of the roof peak. Silver ornaments were also hung from the corners of the roof in the interior of the house. The building's name is inscribed on a white marble plaque affixed to an exterior wall near one of the building's two entrances. This house contains a number of items that belonged to Andrianampoinimerina, including weapons, drums, talismans and a bed raised on stilts. During Andrianampoinimerina's time, his wives were allowed to visit this building but not allowed to sleep there overnight. The site is highly sacred: Queen Rasoherina and her successors often sat on the stepping stone at its threshold to address their audience, and many pilgrims come here to connect with the spirits of Andrianampoinimerina and his ancestors. Visitors are asked to enter the house by stepping in with their right foot and exiting backwards, according to custom, in order to show respect for the spirit of Andrianampoinimerina.|$|E
5|$|An early {{member of}} the Nazi Party, Göring was among those wounded in Adolf Hitler's failed Beer Hall Putsch in 1923. While {{receiving}} treatment for his injuries, he developed an addiction to morphine which persisted {{until the end of}} his life. After Hitler became Chancellor of Germany in 1933, Göring was named as Minister Without Portfolio in the new government. One of his first acts as a cabinet minister was to oversee the creation of the Gestapo, which he ceded to Heinrich Himmler in 1934. Following the establishment of the Nazi state, Göring amassed power and <b>political</b> <b>capital</b> to become the second most powerful man in Germany. In 1935, he was appointed commander-in-chief of the Luftwaffe (air force), a position he held until {{the final days of the}} regime. Upon being named Plenipotentiary of the Four Year Plan in 1936, Göring was entrusted with the task of mobilizing all sectors of the economy for war, an assignment which brought numerous government agencies under his control and helped him become one of the wealthiest men in the country. After the Fall of France in 1940, he was bestowed the specially created rank of Reichsmarschall, which gave him seniority over all officers in Germany's armed forces.|$|E
5|$|Another {{source of}} crown income was {{represented}} by England's Jews. The Jews were the king's personal property, and {{he was free to}} tax them at will. By 1280, the Jews had been exploited to a level at which they were no longer of much financial use to the crown, but they could still be used in political bargaining. Their usury businessa practice forbidden to Christianshad made many people indebted to them and caused general popular resentment. In 1275, Edward had issued the Statute of the Jewry, which outlawed usury and encouraged the Jews to take up other professions; in 1279, {{in the context of a}} crack-down on coin-clippers, he arrested all the heads of Jewish households in England and had around 300 of them executed. In 1280, he ordered all Jews to attend special sermons, preached by Dominican friars, with the hope of persuading them to convert, but these exhortations were not followed. The final attack on the Jews in England came in the Edict of Expulsion in 1290, whereby Edward formally expelled all Jews from England. This not only generated revenues through royal appropriation of Jewish loans and property, but it also gave Edward the <b>political</b> <b>capital</b> to negotiate a substantial lay subsidy in the 1290 Parliament. The expulsion, which was reversed in 1656, followed a precedent set by other European territorial princes: Philip II of France had expelled all Jews from his own lands in 1182; John I, Duke of Brittany, drove them out of his duchy in 1239; and in the late 1240s Louis IX of France had expelled the Jews from the royal demesne before his first passage to the East.|$|E
25|$|Religious ceremonies {{have since}} {{prehistory}} employed {{the procession of}} holy objects to inspire solidarity of belief. The Doges of Venice once staged elaborate barge processions to bless the waters on which Venice's tightly controlled maritime economy depended. Symbolic processions were an important tool in the non-violent protest of Mahatma Gandhi. Marches on <b>political</b> <b>capitals</b> often include formal processions. Gay Pride parades also started with this basis in New York City.|$|R
40|$|<b>Political</b> {{national}} <b>capitals</b> {{provide the}} location for national institutions, represent national values {{and are the}} seat of government. Despite the importance of <b>political</b> national <b>capital</b> cities as tourism destinations, they may be faced with a poor image and perceptions from potential tourists because of their association with government and negative media coverage. This paper presents research undertaken to examine the images, values and perceptions that Australian 2 ̆ 7 s hold of Canberra (the national capital) and to explore whether perceptions differed based on previous visitation. The results suggest {{that a significant number}} of images and perceptions changed if respondents had visited Canberra previously. Furthermore, a visit can lead to an increased agreement that the national capital represents national values. Three cluster segments were also determined and named the misinformed, the capital lovers and the uninformed based on their characteristics. The paper concludes by suggesting both tourism agencies and national capital agencies should work more closely together in fostering greater visitation to <b>political</b> <b>capitals</b> which will help to build feelings of nationhood as well as correct negative destination perceptions...|$|R
50|$|The {{roster of}} early urban traditions is notable for its diversity. Excavations at early urban sites show that some cities were sparsely {{populated}} <b>political</b> <b>capitals,</b> others were trade centers, and still other cities had a primarily religious focus. Some cities had large dense populations, whereas others carried out urban {{activities in the}} realms of politics or religion without having large associated populations. Theories that attempt to explain ancient urbanism by a single factor, such as economic benefit, fail to capture the range of variation documented by archaeologists.|$|R
5|$|Many craft guilds were {{established}} {{in the second half}} of the 13th century, and a patrician stratum based in commerce and craft production displaced the older landed elite in the town's leadership. Through the privilege granted by Sigismund of Luxembourg in 1405, the city opted out from the jurisdiction of voivodes, vice-voivodes and royal judges, and obtained the right to elect a twelve-member jury every year. In 1488, King Matthias Corvinus (born in Kolozsvár in 1440) ordered that the centumvirate—the city council, consisting of one hundred men—be half composed from the homines bone conditiones (the wealthy people), with craftsmen supplying the other half; together they would elect the chief judge and the jury. Meanwhile, an agreement was reached providing that half of the representatives on this city council were to be drawn from the Hungarian, half from the Saxon population, and that judicial offices were to be held on a rotating basis. In 1541, Kolozsvár became part of the Eastern Hungarian Kingdom (that transformed to Principality of Transylvania in 1570) after the Ottoman Turks occupied the central part of the Kingdom of Hungary; a period of economic and cultural prosperity followed. Although Alba Iulia (Gyulafehérvár) served as a <b>political</b> <b>capital</b> for the princes of Transylvania, Cluj (Kolozsvár) enjoyed the support of the princes to a greater extent, thus establishing connections with the most important centres of Eastern Europe at that time, along with Košice (Kassa), Kraków, Prague and Vienna.|$|E
