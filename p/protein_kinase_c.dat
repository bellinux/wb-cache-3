We have previously shown that amyloid beta causes neuronal loss by inducing microglia to phagocytose neurons, and here we investigated whether <b>protein</b> <b>kinase</b> <b>Cs</b> and NADPH oxidase were involved in this. The loss of neurons induced by amyloid beta in co-cultures of primary glia and neurons was completely prevented by inhibiting <b>protein</b> <b>kinase</b> <b>Cs</b> with Gö 6976 or Gö 6983. Directly activating <b>protein</b> <b>kinase</b> <b>Cs</b> with phorbol myristate acetate stimulated microglial phagocytosis, and induced neuronal loss mediated by MFG-E 8 /vitronectin receptor pathway of microglial phagocytosis. Blocking phagocytosis by MFG-E 8 knockout or receptor inhibition left live neurons, indicating microglial phagocytosis was the cause of neuronal death. Phorbol myristate acetate stimulated the microglial NADPH oxidase, and inhibiting the oxidase prevented neuronal loss. A physiological activator of NADPH oxidase, fMLP, also induced neuronal loss dependent on microglia. Amyloid beta-induced neuronal loss was blocked by NADPH oxidase inhibitors, superoxide dismutase or Toll-like receptor function-blocking antibodies. The results indicate that amyloid beta induces microglial phagocytosis of neurons via activating <b>protein</b> <b>kinase</b> <b>Cs</b> and NADPH oxidase, and that activating the kinases or oxidase is sufficient to induce neuronal loss by microglial phagocytosis. Thus inhibiting <b>protein</b> <b>kinase</b> <b>Cs</b> or NADPH oxidase might be beneficial in Alzheimer's disease or other brain pathologies involving inflammatory neuronal loss mediated by microglia.

Almost all annexins are both in vitro and in vivo substrates for PKCs except annexin V.

25|$|Inositol trisphosphate (IP3) {{functions}} as an intracellular second messenger, which initiates the intracellular release of calcium ions (which activates intracellular enzymes, causes {{the release of}} hormones and neurotransmitters from the cells {{in which they are}} stored, and causes smooth muscle contraction when released by IP3), and the activation of <b>protein</b> <b>kinase</b> <b>C</b> (PKC), which is then translocated from the cell cytoplasm to the cell membrane. Although inositol trisphosphate, (IP3), diffuses into the cytosol, diacylglycerol (DAG) remains within the plasma membrane, due to its hydrophobic properties. IP3 stimulates the release of calcium ions from the smooth endoplasmic reticulum, whereas DAG is a physiological activator of <b>protein</b> <b>kinase</b> <b>C</b> (PKC), promoting its translocation from the cytosol to the plasma membrane. PKC is a multifunctional protein kinase which phosphorylates serine and threonine residues in many target proteins.

25|$|The binding of {{melatonin}} to melatonin receptors activates a few signaling pathways.

MT1 receptors also activate phospholipase C (PLC), affect ion channels and regulate ion flux inside the cell. The binding of melatonin to MT2 receptors inhibits adenylyl cyclase which decreases the formation of cAMP. As well it hinders guanylyl cyclase and therefore the forming of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP).

During this process, a feedback loop exists between P16 and Rb, and P16 expression is controlled by Rb. P16/Rb pathway collaborates with the mitogenic signaling cascade for the induction of reactive oxygen species, which activates the <b>protein</b> <b>kinase</b> <b>C</b> delta, leading to an irreversible cell cycle arrest.

Since PAR 2 control ion transport in several epithelia, we searched for an effect on sodium transport in the cortical thick ascending limb of Henle's loop, a nephron segment that avidly reabsorbs NaCl, and for its signaling. Activation of PAR 2, by either trypsin or a specific agonist peptide, increased the maximal activity of Na,K-ATPase, its apparent affinity for sodium, the sodium permeability of the paracellular pathway, and the lumen-positive transepithelial voltage, featuring increased NaCl reabsorption. PAR 2 activation induced calcium signaling and phosphorylation of ERK 1, 2. PAR 2 -induced stimulation of Na,K-ATPase Vmax was fully prevented by inhibition of phospholipase C, of changes in intracellular concentration of calcium, of classical <b>protein</b> <b>kinases</b> <b>C,</b> and of ERK 1, 2 phosphorylation. PAR 2 -induced increase in paracellular sodium permeability was mediated by the same signaling cascade. In contrast, increase in the apparent affinity of Na,K-ATPase for sodium, although dependent on phospholipase C, was independent of calcium signaling, was insensitive to inhibitors of classical <b>protein</b> <b>kinases</b> <b>C</b> and of ERK 1, 2 phosphorylation, but was fully prevented by the nonspecific <b>protein</b> <b>kinase</b> inhibitor staurosporine, as was the increase in transepithelial voltage. In conclusion, PAR 2 increases sodium reabsorption in rat thick ascending limb of Henle's loop along both the transcellular and the paracellular pathway. PAR 2 effects are mediated {{in part by a}} phospholipase C/protein kinase C/ERK 1, 2 cascade, which increases Na,K-ATPase maximal activity and the paracellular sodium permeability, and by a different phospholipase C-dependent, staurosporine-sensitive cascade that controls the sodium affinity of Na,K-ATPase...|$|R

Neurotoxicity results from lead’s ability to act in a similar manner to calcium ions, as concentrated lead will lead to cellular uptake of calcium which disrupts cellular homeostasis and induces apoptosis.

25|$|In {{addition}} to the subset of potassium channels that are directly gated by G proteins, G proteins can also directly gate certain calcium ion channels in neuronal cell membranes. Although membrane ion channels and protein phosphorylation are typically indirectly affected by G protein-coupled receptors via effector proteins (such as phospholipase C and adenylyl cyclase) and second messengers (such as inositol triphosphate, diacylglycerol and cyclic AMP), G proteins can short circuit the second-messenger pathway and gate the ion channels directly. Such bypassing of the second-messenger pathways is observed in mammalian cardiac myocytes and associated sarcolemmal vesicles in which Ca2+ channels are able to survive and function {{in the absence of}} cAMP, ATP or <b>protein</b> <b>kinase</b> <b>C</b> when {{in the presence of the}} activated α-subunit of the G protein. For example, Gα, which is stimulatory to adenylyl cyclase, acts on the Ca2+ channel directly as an effector.

At least three extensively characterized phosphorylation sites (Ser273, 282 and 302; numbering {{refers to the}} mouse sequence) are localized in the M motif of cMyBP-C and are targeted by protein kinases in a hierarchical order of events. In its dephosphorylated state, cMyBP-C binds predominantly to myosin S2 and brakes crossbridge formation, however, when phosphorylated in response to β-adrenergic stimulation through activating cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), it favours binding to actin, then accelerating crossbridge formation, enhancing force development and promoting relaxation. Protein kinases identified thus far to phosphorylate cMyBP-C in the M motif are PKA, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII), ribosomal s6 kinase (RSK),protein kinase D (PKD), and <b>protein</b> <b>kinase</b> <b>C</b> (PKC). Furthermore, GSK3β was described as another protein kinase to phosphorylate cMyBP-C outside the M-domain in the proline-alanine-rich actin-binding site at Ser133 in human myocardium (mouse Ser131). Phosphorylation is required for normal cardiac function and cMyBP-C stability, and overall phosphorylation levels of cMyBP-C are reduced in human and experimental heart failure.
