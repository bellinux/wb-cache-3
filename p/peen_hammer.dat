40|$|Highly {{stressed}} {{turbine blades}} made of Inconel 718 (DIN NiCr 19 NbMo (2. 4668); ASTM B 637; UNS N 07718) have to satisfy stringent requirements regarding durability and reliability. The impact of surface integrity on the fatigue {{strength of the}} workpiece material {{has proven to be}} of significant importance. An optimization of the surface integrity after wire EDM of Inconel 718 can be achieved using the surface finishing process machine <b>hammer</b> <b>peening.</b> Machine <b>hammer</b> <b>peening</b> is an incremental forming process which has the potential to induce residual compressive stresses and strain hardening while smoothing surface asperities. As the effect of machine <b>hammer</b> <b>peening</b> on surface integrity has not yet been completely investigated, this paper deals with its description and modeling of the unknown impact of machine <b>hammer</b> <b>peening</b> on the fatigue strength of Inconel 718. Wire EDM and machine <b>hammer</b> <b>peening</b> parameters maximizing the fatigue strength are presented. Experimental measurements are performed to quantify the surface integrity, especially surface roughness, compressive residual stresses and strain hardening, after wire EDM and subsequent machine <b>hammer</b> <b>peening.</b> The evaluation of the effect of surface integrity on the fatigue strength is carried out using a bending fatigue strength testing machine. Additionally, a finite element model is developed to analyze the surface integrity under load and to reveal the effects of difficult-to-measure properties on the fatigue strength. Based on the new knowledge gained during this work, a model to predict the fatigue strength using similitude theory is presented. Along with the previously analyzed correlations between surface integrity and fatigue strength, this allows a constructive setting of machine <b>hammer</b> <b>peening</b> parameters. Thereby, a significant new contribution to knowledge about the influence of machine <b>hammer</b> <b>peening</b> on surface integrity and fatigue strength of Inconel 718 is made. The presented approach can be easily transferred to other materials and workpiece geometries...|$|R

50|$|The {{cutting edge}} of a scythe blade is {{traditionally}} maintained by occasional peening followed by frequent honing. Peening reforms the malleable edge, by hammering, to: create the desired profile, to temper the metal and to remove minor nicks and dents. For mowing fine grass the bevel angle may be peened extremely fine, while for coarser work a larger angle is created to give a more robust edge. Peening requires some skill and is done using a <b>peening</b> <b>hammer</b> and special anvils or by using a peening jig.

40|$|Low {{roughness}} of free-form surfaces {{represents a}} challenge in production of forming tools. In the industry, the free-form surface is grinded and polished manually. The technology of <b>hammer</b> <b>peening</b> has the capability to replace the time consuming handcraft by automated machining with high productivity and other positive effects, like increased hardness and compressive residual stress in the surface layer. This leads to a high wear resistance of the machined surface. The <b>hammer</b> <b>peening</b> can be conducted with a piezo-actuated tool.

40|$|Various {{traumatic}} {{events such as}} automobile accidents, structure fires, or terrorist attacks result in traumatic and thermal injury. Fire is a destructive force that can alter or destroy evidence, and thermal alterations have negative effects on forensic and anthropological recovery and analysis. Blunt force trauma is particularly difficult to analyze because of the multiple ways in which this trauma appears on a body and the variety of objects that can impact and fracture a bone or the variety of ways a body can impact a blunt surface. As fire is a common way to cover up a crime and blunt force trauma {{is used as a}} means to kill or injure an individual, it is necessary to understand the differences between these two types of fractures that can present together on bone. The present study was performed to determine the amount of survivability of traumatic fracture patterns in remains that have been exposed to a burning event. The sample used for this investigation was composed of twenty limbs (forty long bones) from five full-grown, domestic, female sheep (Ovis aries) obtained from a farm in Connecticut. Thirty specimens were traumatized with the head of an Estwing ball <b>peen</b> <b>hammer</b> and ten were left as controls. After specimens were subjected to blunt force trauma, each was radiographed using Computed Tomography. They were then placed in a small structure, 8 ' x 8 ', that was constructed to simulate the conditions of a house fire. Each post-burn bone was analyzed based on a number of characteristics. A trauma score of " 1 " no trauma, " 2 " ambiguous, and " 3 " traumatic fractures were given based on these observations. CT scans were examined after bone samples had been analyzed. Again, each specimen's CT scan was given a trauma score (" 1 " no trauma, " 2 " ambiguous, and " 3 " traumatic fractures). Results from the bone analysis on the 30 traumatized and burned specimens revealed that 15 did not have trauma, 2 were ambiguous (i. e., they may have trauma but traumatic characteristics were not distinct), and 13 presented with distinguishable traumatic injury. Comminuted was the most prominent type of fracture, and the next most common fracture was oblique. The majority of traumatic injury was found on the middle portion of the bone. CT examination showed that 12 specimens had suffered traumatic injury. The two analyses were compared and showed an agreement of 83. 3 % between the trauma scores. Results show that differentiation of traumatic and thermally induced fractures is possible using various fracture characteristics as well as taphonomic indicators to determine the sequence of events...|$|E

The Fatigue Life of welded structures is still in need for improvement. The sheer number of Fatigue Live Improvement Techniques parameters leads to the need of simulating and predicting their results. For this study, two different materials were used, an Austenitic Stainless Steel and a Duplex Stainless Steel. Non-load carrying cruciform weld joints were produced and fatigue tested, with and without the <b>Hammer</b> <b>Peening</b> treatment. Finally a FEA code (ABAQUS®) was used to simulate the <b>Hammer</b> <b>Peening</b> technique.

5000|$|Shot peening is a {{solution}} process for flattening a deformed steel belt in which {{the surface of the}} belt is hammered with small spherical stainless steel or carbon steel balls called peening shot.

Overlapping indentation create a homogeneous layer of residual compressive stress. It is well known that cracks will not lead up nor propagate in a compressible stressed zone.
