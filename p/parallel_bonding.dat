40|$|Thin {{films of}} fumaramide [2] rotaxane, a {{mechanically}} interlocked molecule {{composed of a}} macrocycle and a thread in a "bead and thread" configuration, were prepared by vapor deposition on both Ag(111) and Au(111) substrates. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and high-resolution electron-energy-loss spectroscopy were used to characterize monolayer and bulklike multilayer films. XPS determination of the relative amounts of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen indicates that the molecule adsorbs intact. On both metal surfaces, molecules in the first adsorbed layer show an additional component in the C 1 s XPS line attributed to chemisorption via amide groups. Molecular-dynamics simulation indicates that the molecule orients two of its eight phenyl rings, one from the macrocycle and one from the thread, in a <b>parallel</b> <b>bonding</b> geometry {{with respect to the}} metal surfaces, leaving three amide groups very close to the substrate. In the case of fumaramide [2]rotaxane adsorption on Au(111), the presence of certain out-of-plane phenyl ring and Au-O vibrational modes points to such bonding and a preferential molecular orientation.

40|$|The {{failure process}} of brittle rock {{submitted}} to a compression state of stress with different confining pressures is investigated in this paper based on discrete element method (DEM) simulations. In the DEM model, the rock sample is represented by bonding rigid particles at their contact points. The numerical model is first calibrated by comparing the macroscopic response with the macroscopic response of Beishan granite obtained from laboratory tests. After the validation of numerical model in terms of macroscopic responses, the failure process of the DEM model under unconfined and confined compression is studied in micro-scale in detail. The contact force network {{and its relation to}} the development of micro-cracks and evolution of major fractures are studied. Confining pressure will prohibit the development of tensile cracks and hence alter the failure patterns. An in-depth analysis of micro-scale response is carried out, including the orientation distribution and probability density of stress acting on <b>parallel</b> <b>bonds,</b> the effect of particle size heterogeneity on bond breakage and the evolution of fabric tensor and coordination number of <b>parallel</b> <b>bond.</b> The proposed micromechanical analysis will allow us to extract innovative features emerged from the stresses and crack evolution in brittle rock failure process.

For the approach that showed to be better describing grain crushing a complete model was prepared together with all the measurements needed to track the sample behaviour during simulation. At the end the model was tested. It turned out that the application of <b>parallel</b> <b>bonds</b> in modelling grain crushing is unnecessary. The main reason for <b>parallel</b> <b>bond</b> application in the model was good description of tensile grain failure. Due to the high coordination numbers the tensile grain splitting is unlikely to occur. Instead, shear grain failure at contact is the most common grain failure. Therefore, contact bonds, which are much more computationally efficient, should be used instead.

The Chi-Chi earthquake produced many monoclinal scarps by fault-propagation folding which caused great damage. The trishear kinematic model of fault-propagation folding appears to approximately represent the geometric development of some structures like monoclines, comparatively little is known of the mechanical controls on their development. Thus we construct a series of distinct-element models that consist of bounded assemblies of elastic particles that simulate the brittle deformation associated with fault-related folding over a rigid footwall.

40|$|Cracking {{processes}} {{have been}} extensively studied in brittle rock and rock-like materials. Due {{to the experimental}} limitations and the complexity of rock texture, details of the cracking processes could not always be observed and assessed comprehensively. To contribute to this field of research, a numerical approach based on the particle element model was used in present study. It would give us insights into {{what is happening to}} crack initiation, propagation and coalescence. <b>Parallel</b> <b>bond</b> model, a type of bonded-particle model, was used to numerically simulate the cracking process in rock-like material containing a single flaw under uniaxial vertical compression. The single flaw's inclinations varied from 0 ° to 75 ° measured from the horizontal. As the uniaxial compression load was increased, multiple new microcracks initiated in the rock, which later propagated and eventually coalesced into longer macrocracks. The inclination of the pre-existing flaw was found to have a strong influence on the crack initiation and propagation patterns. The simulations replicated most of the phenomena observed in the physical experiments, such as the type, the initiation location and the initiate angle of the first cracks, as well as the development of hair-line cracks, which later evolved to macrocracks. Analyses of the <b>parallel</b> <b>bond</b> forces and displacement fields revealed some important mechanisms of the cracking processes. The first cracks typically initiated from the tensile stress concentration regions, in which the tensile stress was partially released after their initiation. The tensile stress concentration regions subsequently shifted outwards close to the propagating tips of the first cracks. The initiation and propagation of the first cracks would not significantly influence the compressive stress singularity at the flaw tips, which was the driving force of the initiation of secondary cracks. The initiation of microcracking zone consisting almost exclusively of micro-tensile cracks, and that of microcracking zone consisting of micro-tensile cracks and mixed micro-tensile and shear cracks, were found to be correlated with two distinct types of displacement fields, namely type I (DF-I) and type II (DF-II), respectively. © Springer-Verlag 2012.
