These mobile phases contain many of the important physicochemical parameters of alveolar surfactant. Results show that <b>physical</b> <b>desorption</b> into model surfactant will be dependent upon the heat of solution and the heat of adsorption. Dominance of either thermodynamic parameter is dependent upon the relative polarity of the adsorbent surface and the adsorbate molecule.

The experimental data of CO 2 desorption {{as a function of}} time are derived by zero-length column at different temperatures (35, 50, and 70 °C) and analyzed by Avrami’s fractional-order kinetic model. A new method is used to distinguish the <b>physical</b> <b>desorption</b> and chemical desorption performance of surface-modified mesoporous MCM- 41. The activation energy Ea of CO 2 <b>physical</b> <b>desorption</b> and chemical desorption calculated from Arrhenius equation are 15. 86 kJ/mol and 57. 15 kJ/mol, respectively. Furthermore, intraparticle diffusion and Boyd’s film models are selected to investigate the mechanism of CO 2 desorption from MCM- 41 and surface-modified MCM- 41. For MCM- 41, there are three rate-limiting steps during the desorption process. Film diffusion is more prominent for the CO 2 desorption rates at low temperatures, and pore diffusion mainly governs the rate-limiting process under higher temperatures. Besides the surface reaction, the desorption process contains four rate-limiting steps on surface-modified MCM- 41...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. AISI 304 {{austenitic}} stainless steel was carburized at low temperature {{by means of the}} active screen plasma carburizing (ASPC). A layer of carbon supersaturated solid solution (i. e. the Sc phase) can be formed on the surface without precipitation of chromium carbide. The hardness of the carburized steel is greatly improved without degradation of its corrosion resistance. ASPC also solves some problems associated with the conventional DC plasma carburizing (DCPC), such as temperature uniformity, edge effect and so on. Particles sputtered from the active screen were collected and analyzed. XRD and SEM analysis indicated that the sputtered particles in sub-micron scale were neutral Fe 3 C and Fe 2 C 5. The particles play the role of the carbon carrier in ASPC. Therefore, ASPC is also a multi-stage process, involving sputtering, <b>physical</b> adsorption, <b>desorption,</b> diffusion and deposition, the same as active screen plasma nitriding...|$|R

Characteristics of the prepared low cost adsorbent (RH) was established using {{scanning electron microscope}} (SEM), Fourier Transform Infra Red (FTIR) and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area. RH was applied for Rhodamine B (RhB) uptake from aqueous solution. Equilibrium adsorption data were fitted using four isotherms and kinetic data tested with five kinetic models. The BET surface area obtained was 0. 00351 m 2 /g; SEM reveals large pores that could enhance the uptake of large molecules.

40|$|Ecological and {{hygienic}} {{importance of}} mercury to environment results from its {{physical and chemical}} properties. At temperatures usual for the temperate climatic zone, the mercury is a liquid metal with relatively high tension of saturated vapours. Interaction of these vapours with a solid phase is realised predominantly by physical forces on the phase interface through the mediation of the adsorption mechanism. Contamination of the soil occurs and the soil consequently becomes an emitter of mercury since the processes of <b>physical</b> adsorption and <b>desorption</b> in the environment are reversible processes. On three examples the authors demonstrate the manifestations of <b>physical</b> adsorption and <b>desorption</b> on the soil samples and point out the relevant part of this contamination mechanism in the entire soil contamination. From {{the point of view}} of a possible separation of individual contributions to the solid phase contamination, either of anthropogeneous or natural origin, the authors recommend to use the recording of a thermodesorption curve for defining three regions characterizing the origin, or forms of mercury and its bound to the solid phase. Authors state that the current analytical methods for determining the mercury concentration in a solid phase provide an information on the so called entire mercury in it but do not distinguish individual mercury forms. From an ecological as well as hygienical point of view, the mercury content in a solid phase reveals more important from the physical adsorption, as it is the mercury form which is very mobil and interactive in respect of the other components of the environment...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A {{model of}} the {{heterogeneous}} catalysis of a dissociated carbon dioxide mixture on high–temperature heat shield coating has been developed. The model takes into account both chemical and <b>physical</b> adsorption and <b>desorption</b> of oxygen atoms at vacant active sites on the surface; recombination of chemisorbed oxygen atoms with gas phase of O atoms and of CO molecules (Eley – Rideal recombination) and with physisorbed atoms (Langmuir – Hinshelwood recombination). Note that the physisorbed atoms either are desorbed from the surface or diffused to the nearest chemisorbed site. Therefore some of these diffusing atoms will be able either to occupy vacant active sites or to react with chemisorbed atoms. The developed here kinetic model for surface reactions provides closed expression for effective probabilities of heterogeneous reactions,OOO 2 →+ 2 COOCO →+ and 2 COO 2 C →+ on the quartz surface {{in terms of the}} rate constants and the activation energies of the elementary studies of these reactions. Based on comparison of the calculated heat fluxes in dissociated carbon dioxide with those measured on the VGU- 4 plasma generator of the Institute for Problems in Mechanics of the RAS, the parameters of the present catalysis model were chosen for 2 SiO- based coating materials. The different mechanisms effect of above-mentioned heterogeneous reactions on recombination probabilities and heat fluxes to coatings was investigated...|$|R

40|$|A new and {{potentially}} valuable {{approach to the}} study of the acidity and reactivity of the surfaces of solid acid materials is described. The technique uses a combination of constant rate thermal analysis (CRTA) with the rate jump technique (CRTA-RJ) for temperature programmed desorption (TPD) and reaction (TPRx). CRTA, where the sample temperature is changed to force the rate of reaction to remain constant through a process, offers a number of advantages over conventional linear heating thermal methods by minimizing temperature and concentration gradients in the sample and reducing the effects of diffusion. CRTA and CRTA-RJ were applied to the TPD and TPRx of isopropylamine from NaY zeolite and its acidic form, HY. Activation energies of both the <b>physical</b> <b>desorption</b> of the amine and the surface-catalyzed Hoffman elimination reaction were calculated as a function of surface coverage and the advantages and limitations of the techniques are discussed. Comparisons are made with analogous TPD experiments using conventional linear heating methods.

Detonated soils exhibited lower gas-exchangeable surface areas than their pristine counterparts.

40|$|The {{accumulation}} and fate {{of model}} microbial “pathogens” within a drinking-water distribution system {{was investigated in}} naturally grown biofilms formed in a novel pilot-scale water distribution system provided with chlorinated and UV-treated water. Biofilms were exposed to 1 -μm hydrophilic and hydrophobic microspheres, Salmonella bacteriophages 28 B, and Legionella pneumophila bacteria, and their fate was monitored over a 38 -day period. The accumulation of model pathogens was generally independent of the biofilm cell density and was shown {{to be dependent on}} particle surface properties, where hydrophilic spheres accumulated to a larger extent than hydrophobic ones. A higher accumulation of culturable legionellae was measured in the chlorinated system compared to the UV-treated system with increasing residence time. The fate of spheres and fluorescence in situ hybridization-positive legionellae was similar and independent of the primary disinfectant applied and water residence time. The more rapid loss of culturable legionellae compared to the fluorescence in situ hybridization-positive legionellae was attributed to a loss in culturability rather than <b>physical</b> <b>desorption.</b> Loss of bacteriophage 28 B plaque-forming ability together with erosion may have affected their fate within biofilms in the pilot-scale distribution system. The current study has demonstrated that desorption was one of the primary mechanisms affecting the loss of microspheres, legionellae, and bacteriophage from biofilms within a pilot-scale distribution system as well as disinfection and biological grazing. In general, two primary disinfection regimens (chlorination and UV treatment) were not shown to have a measurable impact on the accumulation and fate of model microbial pathogens within a water distribution system...|$|E
40|$|The first {{substantial}} experimental {{measurements of}} mass transfer in a rotating spiral channel are reported for counter-current <b>physical</b> <b>desorption</b> {{of a range}} of organic solutes from water into air. General relations in terms of bulk properties are developed that allow analysis and comparison across different solute properties, operating conditions and contacting equipment. The phase flow rate ratio and cleaned-phase throughput per passage volume emerge as parameters of principal importance, the former measuring sufficiency of solvent phase flow and the later mass transfer effectiveness and, consequently, required device size. The analytical solution for an infinitely wide channel is used to probe the finite-width experimental results and an apparently universal pattern of differences involving a peak in mass transfer coefficient emerges. As liquid flow rate decreases, the thickness of the liquid layer decreases and the mass transfer coefficient rises. But with further decrease in liquid flow rate and liquid layer thickness, an increasing fraction of the liquid flows in the corner regions under the end-wall menisci and the poor contact in these regions leads to a falling mass transfer coefficient. The peak is found to occur at a similar liquid layer thickness regardless of gas flow rate or solute equilibrium characteristics. Comparison is made with packed columns and rotating packed beds using available data in the literature. The rotating spiral performance suggests device sizes will be many times smaller than those for the two packed devices considered. Dependence of rotating spiral device volume on the square of channel size is demonstrated, showing that further reduction in device volume is possible...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Chemistry)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2005. The {{purpose of}} the study {{developed}} from the shortcomings of previous investigations in which no satisfactory explanations could be found why exhausted activated carbon which had been thermally reactivated before cannot be regenerated by sc-C 02; the iodine number does not improve after regeneration by sc-CO 2 despite the removal of material from the surface of exhausted activated carbon as depicted by a mass loss; sc-C 02 is incapable of regenerating exhausted carbon to the same extent as thermal reactivation. The strategy to accomplish this purpose was to find answers to the crucial questions by virtue of titrimetric methods (iodine and caramel number), spectrographic techniques (scanning electron microscopy) and adsorption methods (BET analysis and mercury porosimetry). Samples of activated carbon exhausted during the refining of sugar were investigated to establish to what extent these samples could be regenerated by sc-CO 2. The titrimetric results showed that both the iodine and caramel number indeed improved as a result of sc-C 02 regeneration provided that the samples had not been exposed to thermal reactivation before. Thermal reactivation burns substances onto the pore surface, and these blocked pores cannot be decontaminated by sc-C 02. The surface chemistry quantities proved that sc-C 02 is incapable of creating new pores, and thus the iodine number does not improve in cases where sc-C 02 removes material from previously reactivated carbon. It could be shown by virtue of a few thermodynamic quantities and activation parameters that the mechanism of sc-CO 2 regeneration is based upon <b>physical</b> <b>desorption,</b> which totally differs from the mechanism of thermal reactivation by which new pores are created.

Detonated soils exhibited lower gas-exchangeable surface areas than their pristine counterparts. This is likely due to an explosive residue coating on detonated soil surfaces, shock-induced compaction, sintering, and/or partial fusion of soil particles under the intense heat associated with detonation. Our results suggest that explosive compounds loaded to soils through detonation take longer to reach equilibrium concentrations in aqueous batches than soils loaded with explosive residues through aqueous addition.

40|$|Cytotoxic {{platinum}} compounds play a {{major role}} in the chemotherapy of a large number of human cancers. However, due to the severe side effects for the patient and other problems associated with their use, there is a need for the development of more efficient drugs and new methods for their selective delivery to the tumours. One way to achieve the latter could be in the use of nanoparticular carrier materials that can adsorb or chemically bind the drug. In the cell, the drug is supposed to be slowly released, either by <b>physical</b> <b>desorption</b> or by dissolution of the particle framework. Ideally, the cytotoxic properties of the platinum drug unfold only then, in the cancer cell and over a longer period of time due to the gradual release. In this paper, we report on our first steps in this direction. The binding properties of a series of cytotoxic Pt(II) oxadiazoline compounds to mesoporous silica particles has been studied by NMR and UV/vis spectroscopy. High loadings were achieved when the Pt(II) compound was relatively polar, and has been dissolved in a relatively unpolar solvent before the silica was added. Typically, 6 - 10 hours were required for complete equilibration, suggesting the adsorption did not only occur to the outer surface but also to the interior of the pores. The untreated and Pt(II) loaded particles were characterised by C,H,N combustion analysis, BET/BJH nitrogen sorption, electron microscopy (REM and TEM) and EDX. With the latter methods we were able to demonstrate the homogenous distribution of the Pt(II) compound on and in the silica particles, and no Pt(II) bulk precipitate had formed. The in vitro cytotoxicity in a human cancer cell line (HeLa) has been determined for one of the new platinum compounds adsorbed to mesoporous silica particles of different size, and compared with the corresponding compound in solution. The IC 50 data are similar in all cases, suggesting that the release of the Pt(II) compound was relatively fast and possibly occurred before the particles reached the cells.

40|$|The {{growth and}} ligninolytic enzyme {{production}} of two typical lignin-degrading white-rot fungi Phanerochaet chrysosporium and Trametes versicolor were studied. Lactase {{was the major}} ligninolytic enzyme produced by Trametes versicolor in secondary metabolism and triggered by N- or C-limitation, {{in the presence of}} oxygen. The yield of enzyme production by old mycelium (125 U/g) was much higher than that by new mycelium (70 U/g for C-limited and 55 U/g for N-limited) in batch cultures. Lignin peroxidase (Lip) was the major ligninolytic enzyme produced by P. chrysosporium in a strict secondary metabolism, triggered by nutrient starvation and induced by veratryl alcohol (VA). The yield of lignin peroxidase production by old mycelium (21 U/g) was lower than that by new mycelium (25 U/g for C-limited and 30 U/g for N-limited). Lignin peroxidase was sensitive to shear stress and protease. Three typical synthetic dyes (azo, anthraquinone and indigo) were decolorized in vitro by P. chrysosporium and T. versicolor. Dye degradation by three systems including fermentation broth, crude enzymes and enzyme plus mediators (substrates) were studied. A mechanism of lactase-catalyzed dye degradation is proposed based on experimental evidence. The enzyme is first oxidized by O 2 to form oxidized enzyme which can take electrons away from its substrates (dyes, mediators). The oxidized substrate radicals may be further decomposed or reduced by oxidizing other substrates or dyes. By this mechanism, the enzyme can decolorize synthetic dyes of various structures at a high rate. HPLC analysis of the intermediates and end products from dye degradation showed that the decolorized dyes by the in vitro systems could still have residual fragments such as aromatic rings which had high UV adsorption. The presence of living fungal cells, however, showed a better extent of dye degradation than that of in vitro systems. HPLC chromatograms of degradation products indicate that P. chrysosporium can completely degrade the dyes in two days without the residual aromatic or other electron rich fragments of high UV absorption. T. versicolor has a high decolorization rate but can not completely degrade indigo and anthraquinone dyes (AG 27) in 2 days. Adsorption of dye molecules on fungal biomass also contributed to the overall color removal from water. Quantitative adsorption of three dyes on fungal mycelia was investigated. Depending on the structure of individual dyes, the adsorption capacity (Q) and adsorption affinity (K) were different. The adsorption site on biomass could be regenerated by <b>physical</b> <b>desorption</b> and enzymatic degradation; the latter was the major mechanism in regeneration of the dye-saturated biomass.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Chemistry)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2007. The {{feasibility}} of recovering gold preloaded onto activated carbon by {{supercritical carbon dioxide}} (sc-CO 2) was investigated {{in view of the}} actuality of a more environmentally friendly process for the retrieval of gold from real-world matrices (ion-exchange resin, cellulose, activated carbon) than the harsh elution methods currently employed. Several complexes of gold(I) and gold(III) were synthesised and characterised (AA, uv/visible), and their solubility in sc-CO 2 investigated, to identify a suitable compound for loading onto activated carbon and subsequent retrieval by sc-CO 2. KAu(CN) 2 was successfully loaded onto activated carbon. The mass percentage of gold relative to that of other elements on the carbon surface was monitored (SEM-EDS) before and after exposure to sc-CO 2 using a laboratory-size supercritical extractor of the latest design. A decrease in ca. 3. 6 % in the mass percentage of gold on the carbon surface, and the presence of gold in the resulting extracts (ICP-MS), confirmed that a small amount (< 1 %) of the loaded gold could be recovered. Since the same results were obtained regardless of whether sc- CO 2 extraction was performed in static mode (to establish equilibrium conditions for solubility measurement) or dynamic mode (to warrant exhaustive extraction), it could be concluded that the limiting factor was not the solubility of the adsorbate in the fluid but the amount of removable gold in the outer layer(s) of the adsorbed material {{on the surface of the}} activated carbon. The extent of gold recovery was improved to ca. 10 % of the loaded gold by entraining sc-CO 2 with tributyl phosphate (TBP) or TBP-HNO 3 (a Lewis-acid- Lewis-base-adduct supposed to improve recovery by oxidising gold(I) to gold(III) species), but the results revealed, just as with pure sc-CO 2, that there was a surface related limitation and not a TBP related limitation to the amount of recoverable gold. This conclusion could be substantiated by enlarging the surface either by larger samples of loaded carbon or by crushing samples of loaded carbon to very small particles, and in both cases correspondingly higher recoveries were obtained. The influence of different variables on the recovery of KAu(CN) 2 from activated carbon by TBP-HNO 3 entrained sc-CO 2 was studied by surface response analysis based on a statistical design. The independence of density and thus solvent strength suggested that sc-CO 2 was not the primary extractant, and a comparison between gold recovery in the absence and presence of sc-CO 2 revealed that the supercritical fluid neither improved nor deteriorated the extent of recovery by TBP-HNO 3. The slight positive effect of temperature allowed a small positive enthalpy of recovery to be calculated which could be interpreted in terms of <b>physical</b> <b>desorption</b> of gold from the carbon surface. The recoverable gold probably resided in the outer or secondary layer(s) attached to the primary monolayer on the carbon surface from where it could be desorbed by ion-dipole interaction between opposite charges (Au(CN) 2 - and positive end of polar TBP), explaining why the process was found to be surface-limited. The pore size distribution of the activated carbon was determined (mercury porosimetry) to find an explanation why gold was removed only from the surface. Although the activated carbon consisted for 95 % of micropores (8 - 100 A), the molecular diameter of Au(CN) 2. pTBP was found to be ca. 20 A so that it could easily exit a micropore and thereby warranted that, in principle, gold could be removed from the inner pore structure as well. In the course of investigating the central hypothesis, valuable additions to existing knowledge were achieved. The spectral data acquired for a few gold complexes either confirmed existing literature data or represent new data published for the first time. The uv-visible spectra of the complexes were not only recorded but also interpreted in terms of different types of transitions (d-d, charge-transfer, ∏* < [...] ∏, ∏* < [...] n). The solubility in sc-CO 2 of an organophosphorous compound (TBP) was determined with the available supercritical extractor using a self-invented procedure which prevented liquid samples from being swept away instantaneously by sc-CO 2 on entering the extraction thimble. The solubility so obtained was inexcellent agreement with values reported in the literature for similar type compounds at comparable conditions. The proved solubility of 1. 10 - phenanthroline in sc-CO 2 opened up the possibility of purifying a phenanthroline complex of gold(III) containing some unreacted ligand as an impurity by sc-CO 2 instead of recrystallising the substance from solution. The investigation drew the attention to the decisive role played by activated carbon in limiting the recovery of gold regardless of which extractant (sc-CO 2, TBP or TBP-HNO 3) was used. This encourages investigation of alternative matrices (ionexchange resins, cellulose membranes) with weaker attractive forces in future if an efficient gold recovery process need to be developed.

FlFFF, a relatively new separations technique, can be used to characterize a variety of environmental samples. FlFFF is a subtechnique of field-flow fractionation (FFF). In FFF, an applied field is oriented perpendicular to the longitudinal flow of analytes through a thin fluid channel where a parabolic velocity profile gives rise to separations. In FlFFF, a uniform flow field is applied over the channel area. Detailed theoretical derivations of the basic equations of normal mode FFF leading to a comprehensive FlFFF theory are provided. This theoretical chapter connects the basic experimental design of the FlFFF system to the experimental methods and results. Humic and fulvic acids, aqueous compost-leachates, the hydrophobic and hydrophilic fractions of a compost-leachate (obtained from adsorption chromatography), and hematite particles (a common soil constituent) are characterized in terms of molecular weight distributions (MWDs) and hydrodynamic diameter distributions (HDDs) using FlFFF. Humic acid/hematite and fulvic acid/hematite mixtures are analyzed using FlFFF in terms of their kinetics and adsorption phenomena. MWDs of water-soluble organic soil constituents were determined by their calibration with poly(styrene-sulfonate) standards. HDDs for these soil constituents are determined directly from FlFFF data. Hematite particle diameters were determined from calibration standards and directly from FlFFF data. The data show that a compost-leachate, collected with a lysimeter, is similar to that obtained by leaching soil samples with deionized water in the laboratory. The MWDs of the water leachate samples contain higher molecular weight components than either the hydrophobic or the hydrophilic fraction. And the hydrophobic fraction exhibits higher molecular weight components than the hydrophilic fraction. The similar MWDs obtained from ultraviolet (UV) absorption and refractive index detection for each sample, coupled with the evidence that the hydrophobic fraction contains higher molecular weight components than the hydrophilic fraction, indicates that the high molecular weight components of the water leachate may be hydrophobic but are not necessarily aromatic. The hydrophobic and hydrophilic fractions of the source compost-leachate have lower peak molecular weights, Mps, and narrower MWDs than their source material. This is possibly {{due to the fact that}} the humic acids were removed from the water leachate before they were separated into the hydrophobic and hydrophilic fractions, or it may be that the hydrophobic and hydrophilic fractions interact to form at least part of the higher molecular weight components in the source water leachates. Upon characterizing the MWDs and HDDs for humic materials, the effect of pH and salt concentration on hydrodynamic size are investigated for the compost- leachate samples and a standard fulvic acid sample. When the pH of the carrier liquid is lowered, hydrodynamic diameters decrease for the compost-leachate samples and the fulvic acid. This is probably due to the collapse of their polymeric branches. Humic acids are typically larger macromolecules and form aggregates below pH 5, but the hydrodynamic diameters of the humic leachate samples decrease as the pH is lowered. Additions of sodium chloride do not significantly affect size distributions but the addition of calcium chloride at low ionic strengths indicates a molecular reconformation to smaller diameters as well as the formation of aggregates (probably oligomers), although profound coagulation is not observed. As the ionic strength of calcium chloride is further increased, aggregation subsides, HDDs are shifted to lower size distributions, and there is significant sample loss (probably through the membrane). This supports the idea that collapsed molecular branches inhibit intermolecular interactions. Although the HDDs were successfully characterized, the analysis of collapsed and unaggregated humic molecules is limited by their penetration and subsequent loss through the channel membrane. Studies of the interaction of two humic substances [...] a humic acid and a fulvic acid [...] with colloidal hematite particles in DI water show that adsorption of the humic substances onto the hematite particles occurs readily. These studies demonstrate the strong affinity for humic molecules to adsorb onto the hematite particles, and that humic/hematite mixtures are in a dynamic state of interactive equilibria. Adsorption phenomena may continue indefinitely, but the adsorption of the humic substances onto the hematite particles reaches an apparent state of equilibrium within hours. The interactions between the humic molecules and the hematite particles can be interpreted in terms of physical adsorption. Shifted elution profiles of the adsorbed humics show <b>physical</b> <b>desorption</b> where the desorbed molecules are either irreversibly lost by the hematite and elute early from the channel or are sequentially desorbed and adsorbed (also leading to their early elutions). The degree of shifting of adsorbed elution profiles is a function of concentration and molecular species. The fulvic acid shifts are greater than those of the humic acid which is in agreement with its higher diffusivity. And secondary chemical equilibrium theory predicts the shifted profiles from sequential desorption and adsorption as a function of concentration. Quantitative adsorption isotherms are established for the humic and fulvic acid samples by computing the mass of humic substance lost to adsorption onto the hematite. These isotherms suggest Langmuir-type behavior where initial monolayer adsorption proceeds quickly as a function of equilibrium concentration and then begins to slow as the hematite adsorbent surfaces are increasingly saturated. They also show that the hematite surfaces adsorb more humic acid mass than fulvic acid mass at all of the tested equilibrium concentrations...|$|E
