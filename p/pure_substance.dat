A toxic dose requiring medical treatment varies but is considered more than 0.1 mL per kg body weight (mL/kg) of <b>pure</b> <b>substance.</b> That is roughly 16 mL of 50% ethylene glycol for an 80kg adult and 4 mL for a 20kg child. Poison control centers often use more than a lick or taste in a child or more than a mouthful in an adult as a dose requiring hospital assessment.|$|E

25|$|In organic chemistry, {{there can}} {{be more than one}} {{chemical}} compound with the same composition and molecular weight. Generally, these are called isomers. Isomers usually have substantially different chemical properties, may be isolated and do not spontaneously convert to each other. A common example is glucose vs. fructose. The former is an aldehyde, the latter is a ketone. Their interconversion requires either enzymatic or acid-base catalysis. However, there are also tautomers, where isomerization occurs spontaneously, such that a <b>pure</b> <b>substance</b> cannot be isolated into its tautomers. A common example is glucose, which has open-chain and ring forms. One cannot manufacture pure open-chain glucose because glucose spontaneously cyclizes to the hemiacetal form.|$|E

2500|$|The {{absolute}} entropy ( [...] {{rather than}} [...] ) was defined later, using either statistical mechanics or the third law of thermodynamics, an otherwise arbitrary additive constant is fixed {{such that the}} entropy of a <b>pure</b> <b>substance</b> at absolute zero is zero.

2500|$|Vanillin {{was first}} {{isolated}} {{as a relatively}} <b>pure</b> <b>substance</b> in 1858 by Nicolas-Theodore Gobley, who obtained it by evaporating a vanilla extract to dryness, and recrystallizing the resulting solids from hot water. In 1874, the German scientists Ferdinand Tiemann and Wilhelm Haarmann deduced its chemical structure, {{at the same time}} finding a synthesis for vanillin from coniferin, a glucoside of isoeugenol found in pine bark. Tiemann and Haarmann founded a company, Haarmann and Reimer (now part of Symrise) and started the first industrial production of vanillin using their process in Holzminden, Germany.

2500|$|Melting {{points are}} often used to {{characterize}} organic and inorganic compounds and to ascertain their [...] The melting point of a <b>pure</b> <b>substance</b> is always higher and has a smaller range than the melting point of an impure substance or, more generally, of mixtures.

The temperature at which melting begins for a mixture is known as the [...] "solidus" [...] while the temperature where melting is complete is called the [...] "liquidus". Eutectics are special types of mixtures that behave like single phases. They melt sharply at a constant temperature to form a liquid of the same composition. Alternatively, on cooling a liquid with the eutectic composition will solidify as uniformly dispersed, small (fine-grained) mixed crystals with the same composition.|$|E
2500|$|A {{chemical}} substance {{may well be}} defined as [...] "any material with a definite chemical composition" [...] in an introductory general chemistry textbook. According to this definition a {{chemical substance}} can either be a pure chemical element or a pure chemical compound. But, there are exceptions to this definition; a <b>pure</b> <b>substance</b> can also {{be defined as a}} form of matter that has both definite composition and distinct properties. The chemical substance index published by CAS also includes several alloys of uncertain composition. Non-stoichiometric compounds are a special case (in inorganic chemistry) that violates the law of constant composition, and for them, it is sometimes difficult to draw the line between a mixture and a compound, {{as in the case of}} palladium hydride. Broader definitions of chemicals or chemical substances can be found, for example: [...] "the term 'chemical substance' means any organic or inorganic substance of a particular molecular identity, including – (i) any combination of such substances occurring in whole or in part as a result of a chemical reaction or occurring in nature".|$|E
2500|$|There {{are many}} [...] {{thermodynamic}} properties that are functions of state.

Often, if two properties of the system are determined, then the state is determined and the other properties' values can also be determined. For instance, a quantity of gas at a particular temperature and pressure has its state fixed by those values and thus has a specific [...] volume that is determined by those values. [...] As another instance, a system composed of a <b>pure</b> <b>substance</b> of a single phase at a particular uniform temperature and pressure is determined (and is thus a particular state) and is at not only a particular volume but also at a particular entropy. The fact that entropy is a function of state is one reason it is useful. In the Carnot cycle, the working fluid returns to the same state it had at the start of the cycle, hence the line integral of any state function, such as entropy, over this reversible cycle is zero.|$|E
