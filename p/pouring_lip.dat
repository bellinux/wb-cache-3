2500|$|However, one vessel type used in food {{preparation}} was closely {{linked with the}} spread of Roman culture and Roman cuisine: the [...] This was a robust shallow bowl with a thick, out-curved rim that {{made it easy to}} handle, often a <b>pouring</b> <b>lip,</b> and an internal surface deliberately roughened with a coating of grit or coarse sand during manufacture. It was used with a pestle to purée or pulverise ingredients in order to prepare elaborate and carefully seasoned Roman dishes; the Roman culinary tradition made extensive use of herbs and spices. The mortarium was the Roman equivalent of the food-processor, and is a real indicator of 'romanisation'; In Britain, the first mortaria were being imported from Gaulish sources more than a generation before Britain became a Roman province in AD 43, indicating the growing influence of Roman culture in late Iron Age southern Britain, and perhaps the actual presence of immigrants from Gaul. Later, locally-made mortaria produced at specialised potteries in different areas of the province were available throughout Britain, in addition to imported products: Paul Tyers discusses mortaria from no fewer than 16 different manufacturing sources, Romano-British and Continental, that have been found in Britain. Like so many other specialised Roman ceramic products, many mortaria also bore workshop or makers' stamps on their rims, and noting their chronology and distribution can help archaeologists understand trading patterns and the Roman economy.|$|E

The font, dated 12th century, {{could have been a}} relic of the former Priory. This was not {{originally}} made as a font, but as a quern - a vessel for corn or liquid with a <b>pouring</b> <b>lip</b> {{on the edge of the}} rim.|$|E

60|$|The King {{watched a}} while, screams and curses <b>pouring</b> from his <b>lips</b> {{to be lost}} in the horrible uproar. He turned, perhaps to upbraid his mother and his brother, but found that they were no longer at his side. Behind him in the room a page was crouching, {{watching}} him with a white, horrified face.|$|R
60|$|O'Moy's honest {{soul was}} in torturing {{revolt against the}} falsehoods he had implied--and to this man of all men, to this man whom he reverenced above all others, who stood to him for the very fount of {{military}} honour and lofty principle! He {{was in such a}} mood that one more question on the subject from Wellington and the whole ghastly truth must have come <b>pouring</b> from his <b>lips.</b> But no other question came. Instead his lordship turned on the threshold and held out his hand.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have killed}} him!" [...] she muttered. [...] "Oh, Dio mio, you have killed him!" [...] Then I heard a sudden sharp intake of her breath, and she sprang {{into the air}} with a cry of joy. Round and round the room she danced, her hands clapping, her dark eyes gleaming with delighted wonder, and a {{thousand}} pretty Italian exclamations <b>pouring</b> from her <b>lips.</b> It was terrible and amazing to see such a woman so convulsed with joy at such a sight. Suddenly she stopped and gazed at us all with a questioning stare.|$|R
60|$|Genevieve {{was aware}} {{only of the}} diatribe; she knew a flood of abuse was <b>pouring</b> from the <b>lips</b> of the Jewess, {{but she was too}} stunned to hear the details of the abuse. Joe, her Joe, was Joe Fleming the prize-fighter. It was abhorrent, impossible, too {{grotesque}} to be believable. Her clear- eyed, girl-cheeked Joe might be anything but a prize-fighter. She had never seen one, but he in no way resembled her conception of what a prize- fighter must be--the human brute with tiger eyes and a streak for a forehead. Of course she had heard of Joe Fleming--who in West Oakland had not?--but that there should be anything more than a coincidence of names had never crossed her mind.|$|R
60|$|While those wild {{words were}} <b>pouring</b> from her <b>lips,</b> the {{rumbling}} of carriage wheels became audible {{on the drive}} {{in front of the}} house. In the all-absorbing agitation of the moment, the sound of the wheels (followed by the opening of the house door) passed unnoticed by the persons in the dining-room. Horace's voice was still raised in angry protest against the insult offered to Lady Janet; Lady Janet herself (leaving him for the second time) was vehemently ringing the bell to summon the servants; Julian had once more taken the infuriated woman by the arms and was trying vainly to compose her--when the library door was opened quietly by a young lady wearing a mantle and a bonnet. Mercy Merrick (true to the appointment which she had made with Horace) entered the room.|$|R
5000|$|In 2009, Thomlinson was {{a private}} serving with the 2nd Commando Regiment in Tarin Kowt District of South Afghanistan. While on night patrol on 3 April 2009, the vehicle he was in ran over an improvised {{explosive}} device planted by the Taliban. The explosion caused extensive damage to his body that resulted in both of his legs being amputated, as one leg was completely obliterated {{and the other was}} torn off below the knee. His arms were also severely injured, with the elbow on his right arm coming out through a hole. Both hands and wrists were broken and he had a dislocated shoulder. He also broke his nose and tore his lips. He nearly choked on blood from his cut <b>lips</b> <b>pouring</b> down his throat. The sound of him wheezing alerted others {{to the fact that he}} was still alive. His best friend, Private Scott Palmer, aided him by providing immediate medical attention following the explosion in an act that saved Thomlinson's life. [...] Thomlinson was subsequently evacuated to Germany for treatment, and has no memory of the actual incident. [...] While in rehabilitation, he learned how to walk again within several months, with some of his later recovery taking place at the Pain Management Research Institute at Royal North Shore Hospital. He does not have any problems with phantom limb issues that other amputees sometimes deal with.|$|R
