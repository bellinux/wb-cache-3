5|$|Dr. James Baxter of the Everton {{committee}} donated a £1,000 {{interest-free loan}} to build Goodison Park. The stadium was England's first <b>purpose-built</b> football ground, with stands on three sides. Goodison Park was officially opened on 24 August 1892 by Lord Kinnaird and Frederick Wall of the Football Association. No football was played; instead the 12,000 crowd watched a short athletics event followed by {{music and a}} fireworks display. Upon its completion the stadium was the first joint <b>purpose-built</b> football stadium in the world; Celtic's basic Celtic Park ground in Glasgow, Scotland was inaugurated {{on the same day}} as Goodison Park.|$|E

5|$|Everton's current {{position}} regarding {{the future of}} Goodison Park {{is that they are}} considering all options, including relocation, redevelopment of the current ground, or a groundshare with Liverpool F.C., in a new, <b>purpose-built</b> stadium in Stanley Park, stressing that finance is the main factor affecting decision-making.|$|E
5|$|In January 2001, {{plans were}} drawn up {{to move to}} a 55,000-seat <b>purpose-built</b> arena {{on the site of the}} King's Dock in Liverpool. The {{proposed}} stadium would have had a retractable roof enabling it to be used for concerts and chairman Bill Kenwright had hoped to have it ready for the 2005–06 season.|$|E
5|$|The Dorothy Hughes Pack Holiday Centre {{was built}} in 1970 by fitting {{interlocking}} logs together from a Norwegian, with no nails used to construct the original frame.

5|$|Wazir Khan Mosque {{features}} South Asia's first {{example of}} a <b>purpose-built</b> Central Asian charsu bazaar, or four-axis bazaar - although in the Wazir Khan Mosque adaptation, {{two of the four}} axises are aligned as the mosque's entryway, while the other two form the Calligrapher's Bazaar.|$|E
5|$|A {{referendum}} of the Scottish electorate, held on 11 September 1997, {{approved the}} establishment of a directly elected Scottish Parliament to legislate on most domestic affairs. Following this, the Scottish Office, led by the then Secretary of State for Scotland, Donald Dewar, decided that a new <b>purpose-built</b> facility would be constructed in Edinburgh, to house the Scottish Parliament.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 2,202 M3 GMCs were {{produced}} from 1941 to 1943. Only 86 vehicles were produced in 1941, {{but this was}} increased in 1942 during which 1,350 examples came off the production lines. A further 766 were completed in 1943. Production was stopped due {{to the introduction of}} turreted, <b>purpose-built,</b> tank destroyers, such as the M10 GMC.|$|E

Arsenal's Academy under-18 teams play their home matches at Shenley, while the reserves play their games at Meadow Park, {{which is also the}} home of Boreham Wood F.C..|$|E
5|$|Bordered by the Cowley Road, {{this site}} was {{formerly}} Nazareth House, a residential care home convent — Goldie Wing (shown left) and Larmenier House are its surviving buildings.

The two new halls were opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 8 November 2000.|$|E
5|$|Brislington House (now {{known as}} Long Fox Manor) was {{built as a}} private lunatic asylum. When it opened in 1806 {{it was one of}} the first <b>purpose-built</b> asylums in England. It is {{situated}} on the Bath Road in Brislington, Bristol, although parts of the grounds cross the city boundary into the parish of Keynsham in Bath and North East Somerset.|$|E
5|$|Conditions {{in camps}} varied {{considerably}} geographically and over time. Conditions were particularly {{poor in the}} summer of 1940, when facilities proved insufficient to accommodate the large number of new POWs, and in the particularly cold winter that same year. Gradually, as prisoners were repatriated, relieving overcrowding, conditions generally improved. From 1943, however, as the war on the Eastern Front turned against Germany, conditions worsened and the food supply became more precarious. Some camps were <b>purpose-built,</b> like Stalag II-D, but others could be former barracks, asylums or fortresses.|$|E
5|$|Conversion {{planning}} {{began in}} May 1942, {{and had the}} conversion been finished, {{she would have been}} the largest German aircraft carrier, longer even than the <b>purpose-built</b> s. The work was canceled in November 1942, however, after design problems, including serious instability and structural weaknesses, proved to be irreconcilable. No work was done on the ship, which was eventually seized by the US Army and used as a troop transport following the end of the war.|$|E
5|$|Crompton Library is a <b>purpose-built</b> library housing over 36,000 items {{including}} books, CDs, and DVDs {{that can}} be borrowed by anyone {{who lives in the}} Oldham borough.

5|$|Dorchester Town F.C., the town's {{football}} team currently {{play in the}} Southern League Premier Division. Harry Redknapp and former England players Graham Roberts and Martin Chivers represented 'The Magpies' in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The club is based on Weymouth Avenue {{in the south of}} the town after moving from its old ground also on Weymouth Avenue. The club moved to the <b>purpose-built</b> 5,000 capacity Avenue Stadium on Duchy of Cornwall land in the early 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Due to laxer laws about {{building}} housing on major roads, as London suburbs developed, properties {{were allowed to}} be built on the North Circular Road. The original <b>purpose-built</b> road had been designed with no speed limit, as was typically {{the case in the}} 1920s, but by 1951 a 30mph speed limit was enforced along the route.|$|E
5|$|From 1921 to 1976, {{the meeting}} {{place of the}} Parliament of Malta had been the Tapestry Chamber of the Grandmaster's Palace, also in Valletta. In 1976, the former armoury of the same palace was {{converted}} into a new parliament, and meetings were held there until {{the opening of the}} <b>purpose-built</b> Parliament House on 4 May 2015.|$|E
5|$|Goodison Park is a {{football}} stadium located in Walton, Liverpool, England. The stadium has {{been home to}} Premier League club Everton since its completion in 1892 {{and is one of}} the world's oldest <b>purpose-built</b> football grounds.

5|$|Greyhound racing was {{introduced}} to Belle Vue in 1926, in the UK's first <b>purpose-built</b> greyhound stadium, constructed {{at a cost of}} £22,000. It was built on land leased by Belle Vue to the Greyhound Racing Association (GRA), a company chaired by Sir William Gentle, who was also the chairman of Belle Vue (Manchester) Ltd. The site was sold to the GRA in 1937, with the proviso {{that it had to be}} used for greyhound racing.|$|E
5|$|In 1871 the town's first <b>purpose-built</b> {{police station}} {{was built in}} Windsor Street. The {{building}} included three cells and stables. The Metropolitan Police continued to use the building until 1988, when operations {{moved to a new}} site in Harefield Road. The building subsequently became the Old Bill public house in 1996, renamed the Fig Tree in 2006.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, the City of London School {{moved to}} its present site in <b>purpose-built</b> {{facilities}} in Queen Victoria Street (where it is opposite the College of Arms and just below St Paul's Cathedral) {{on one side}} and facing onto the banks of the River Thames on the other side. It was officially opened in 1987 by HRH The Princess Anne. The Millennium Bridge is next to the school buildings.|$|E
5|$|In June 1962, Bell Helicopter {{presented}} a new helicopter design to Army officials, {{in the hopes}} of soliciting funding for further development. The D-255 Iroquois Warrior was envisioned as a <b>purpose-built</b> attack aircraft based on the UH-1B airframe and dynamic components, with a nose-mounted ball turret, a belly-mounted gun pod, and stub wings for mounting rockets or SS.10 anti-tank missiles.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to its growing importance as a tourist centre, Keswick developed a reputation for its manufacture of pencils during the 19th century. It had begun on a modest scale in or about 1792, as a cottage industry, using graphite mined locally. This developed on more industrial lines in factories <b>purpose-built</b> by several companies. Pencil making was the town's most important manufacturing industry by the mid-19th century, textiles and leather goods having declined.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the established church, a variety of Reformed denominations have been practised in Royton. The Religious Society of Friends were recorded as holding conventicles in Heyside in {{as early as the}} 1650s. A Baptist meeting place was erected in 1775. Congregational preachers regularly visited Royton, {{but it was not until}} 1854 that a workshop was established in the town. Primitive Methodism was established in Royton in a room in a Royley building, with its first <b>purpose-built</b> church being erected in 1867.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the exhibition buildings, Duxford's 'North Side', {{the area of the}} site north of the A505 road, provides storage for the Imperial War Museum's collecting departments. The stored collections include the film collection, with potentially hazardous nitrate film kept in <b>purpose-built</b> vaults at nearby Ickleton. Other collections stored at Duxford's north side include books, maps, ephemera, photographs, documents and collections of uniforms and equipment.|$|E
5|$|In {{recognition}} of the established and popular activity of mountain biking in the greater Adelaide area, and to better accommodate the mountain biking community in the north eastern suburbs, it was proposed in 2006 to permit cycling in designated zones on <b>purpose-built</b> tracks and on certain management tracks within the park. The intention is to satisfy both biodiversity and recreation objectives {{in the park and}} reducing the incidence of illegal mountain bike riding in other non designated areas.|$|E
5|$|In the Northover {{district}} {{industrial production}} of sheepskins, woollen slippers and, later, boots and shoes, developed {{in conjunction with}} the growth of C Clark in Street. Clarks still has its headquarters in Street, but shoes are no longer manufactured there. Instead, in 1993, redundant factory buildings were converted to form Clarks Village, the first <b>purpose-built</b> factory outlet in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|In {{the seasons}} {{following}} the FA Cup triumph, {{the club was}} dogged by allegations of financial irregularities, culminating in the suspension of seventeen players in 1906, including captain Billy Meredith, who subsequently moved across town to Manchester United. A fire at Hyde Road destroyed the main stand in 1920, and in 1923 the club moved to their new <b>purpose-built</b> stadium at Maine Road in Moss Side.|$|E
5|$|Lake Shore Road {{around the}} island was built between 1900 and 1910 by the state, and the M-185 {{designation}} was first assigned on July 12, 1933. The roadway was <b>purpose-built</b> for non-motorized use; it is narrower than other state highways. During the 1950s, the state paved the road in asphalt. Since the 1970s, the MISPC has allowed snowmobiles to operate on Mackinac Island during the winter.|$|E
5|$|Many {{people put}} up bat houses to attract bats. The 1991 University of Florida bat {{house is the}} largest {{occupied}} artificial roost in the world, with around 300,000 residents. In Britain, thickwalled and partly underground World War II pillboxes have been converted to make roosts for bats, and <b>purpose-built</b> bat houses are occasionally built to mitigate damage to habitat from road or other developments.|$|E
