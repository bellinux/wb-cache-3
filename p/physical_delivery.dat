Digital video also allows footage to be viewed on location without the expensive chemical processing required by film. Also <b>physical</b> <b>deliveries</b> of tapes and broadcasts do not apply anymore. Digital television (including higher quality HDTV) started to spread in most developed countries in early 2000s. Digital video is also used in modern mobile phones and video conferencing systems. Digital video is also used for Internet distribution of media, including streaming video and peer-to-peer movie distribution. However even within Europe are lots of TV-Stations not broadcasting in HD, due to restricted budgets for new equipment for processing HD.|$|R

The contracts ultimately are not between the original buyer and the original seller, but between the holders at expiry and the exchange.

The structure of these contracts varies by regional market due to different conventions and market structures. However, the two simplest and most common forms are simple fixed price forward contracts for <b>physical</b> <b>delivery</b> and contracts for differences where the parties agree a strike price for defined time periods. In the case of a contract for difference, if a resulting wholesale price index (as referenced in the contract) in any time period is higher than the [...] "strike" [...] price, the generator will refund the difference between the [...] "strike" [...] price and the actual price for that period. Similarly a retailer will refund the difference to the generator when the actual price is less than the [...] "strike price".

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis examines {{the impact of}} the elimination of 'Facility Not Available' (FNA) waivers. Naval Reserve facilities could previously waive, as 'FNA,' any portion of the periodic physical examination not locally available. The Navy eliminated the authority to use FNA waivers in February 1994. The objective of this thesis was to identify the impact of FNA waiver elimination on periodic physical examination cost, effectiveness and delivery methods. It begins by describing the periodic physical examination and the Naval Reserve <b>physical</b> examination <b>delivery</b> system. Three methodologies were used to do this: interviews of key personnel, a literature review, and analysis of retrospective data from the Naval and Marine Corps Physical Evaluation Board (PEB) and the Commander of the Naval Reserve Force (CNRF). Then the impacts of FNA waiver elimination were examined using a survey which resulted in the review of 81, 699 medical records and periodic <b>physical</b> examination <b>delivery</b> and cost data from 199 Naval Reserve facilities (98 percent of the Naval Reserve). This thesis found that FNA waiver elimination was an extremely successful change in health care policy for the Naval Reserve. Periodic physical examination costs were increased and the methods used to deliver examinations were changed. However, these impacts are justified because of the dramatic increase in periodic physical examination effectiveness achieved due to FNA waiver elimination. [URL] United States Nav...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} about {{integrating}} {{a supply chain}} to a customer’s implementation project. The study is to identify and describe key factors that influence supply chain choices for project businesses. The aim is to explain the selection criteria for the right chain for an individual customer under different circumstances. The research problem, a highly relevant theme in the Internet age, is how to select the most appropriate supply chain for a customer in different business conditions. In addition to contributing to the scientific literature, this research also aims to support practical business situations in the industry by creating a normative decision-making model. The scope of this study is, thus, restricted to supply chains in project businesses where the success of logistics processes is largely dependent on how well <b>physical</b> <b>deliveries</b> are integrated into the implementation schedules of a project. The focused product type is typical of high-tech and innovative products with relatively short life cycles. Furthermore, the business environment of the scope is characterised by fast-growing turbulent markets. This study is an action research conducted in the GSM network business in Europe during 1999 and 2000. The research is an inductive, theory-building multiple-case study. The supplier case company is Nokia Networks, {{one of the leading}} suppliers of fixed and mobile telecommunication systems, and the customers consist of major European mobile phone operators, which however are anonymous in the thesis for the sake of business confidentiality.

40|$|Background/PurposeSince {{there is}} no {{comprehensive}} research of natal and neonatal teeth in Taiwan, careful investigation of natal or neonatal teeth is worthy of being studied. This retrospective study investigated the prevalence and clinical characteristics of natal or neonatal teeth in a hospital setting, and analyzed the possible relationships between investigated variables of the natal or neonatal teeth. MethodsAll of the 12, 019 infants born at an assigned hospital between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2014 were investigated for natal or neonatal teeth. The identified individuals were reviewed for systemic diseases. Dental examinations included the location, clinical appearance, and degree of mobility. A positive family history of natal or neonatal teeth and mother's <b>physical</b> condition before <b>delivery</b> were also investigated. The collected {{data were analyzed using}} Fisher's exact test. ResultsThirty infants were identified with a total of 43 natal or neonatal teeth (females, 19; males, 11). Most of the teeth were in the mandibular primary incisor position (97. 6 %). A radiographic examination confirmed that not all of the natal or neonatal teeth were supernumerary. No significant differences were observed between males and females in tooth morphology, positive family history, and treatment methods (p >  0. 05) or between normal and conical shapes in positive family history, premature infant, mother's <b>physical</b> condition before <b>delivery,</b> and treatment methods (p >  0. 05). ConclusionMost of the natal or neonatal teeth were in the mandibular primary incisor position and not all of them were supernumerary. No gender differences were found in tooth morphology, positive family history, and treatment methods. The tooth morphology was not significantly related to a positive family history, premature delivery, or the mother's <b>physical</b> condition before <b>delivery...</b>|$|R

Although recent research has highlighted the difference between <b>physical</b> service <b>delivery</b> and service delivery in e-commerce (Parasuraman et al., 2005; Barnes and Vigden, 2002, 2005), there is little documented evidence of these techniques being applied to e-commerce.

40|$|The skin {{has evolved}} {{to resist the}} {{penetration}} of foreign substances and particles. Effective topical drug delivery into and/or through the skin is hindered by these epidermal barriers. A range of physical enhancement methods has been developed to selectively overcome this barrier. This review discusses recent advances in <b>physical</b> drug <b>delivery</b> by broadly separating the techniques into two main areas; indirect and direct approaches. Indirect approaches consist of electrical, vibrational or laser instrumentation that creates pores in the skin followed by application of the drug. Direct approaches consist of mechanical disruption of the epidermis using techniques such as microdermabrasion, biolistic injectors and microneedles. Although, in general, physical techniques are yet to be established in a clinical setting, the potential gains of enhancing delivery of compounds through the skin is of great significance and will no doubt continue to receive much attention...|$|R
