5|$|<b>Prophet</b> Elijah {{was also}} {{regarded}} as a protector from the ale. As soon as he spotted an ala consuming the fertility of fields, he would summon dragons and harness them to his flying chariot. They then together attacked the demon, shooting fiery arrows at her. Instead of the dragons, the <b>prophet</b> could summon dragon men. They would then fall asleep, and their souls would rush to the thundering clouds to assist the <b>prophet</b> against the ale. A legend {{in the region of}} Leskovac has it that fighting the ale was originated by <b>Prophet</b> Elijah, when he, accompanied by a dragon boy, killed twelve of these demons. In the popular tradition of Slavic peoples, <b>Prophet</b> Elijah is a Christian replacement of the pagan Slavic thunder god Perun.|$|E
5|$|As the Word, Jesus was {{eternally}} {{present with}} God, active in all creation, {{and the source}} of humanity's moral and spiritual nature. Jesus is not only greater than any past human <b>prophet</b> but greater than any <b>prophet</b> could be. He not only speaks God's Word; he is God's Word. In the Gospel of John, Jesus reveals his divine role publicly. Here he is the Bread of Life, the Light of the World, the True Vine and more.|$|E

5000|$|The {{author of}} the Lives of the <b>Prophets</b> {{seems to have been}} more {{interested}} in miracles, intercessions and predictions of the <b>prophets</b> than in their ethical teaching.One of the more typical themes of the Lives of the <b>Prophets</b> is the interest of the author for the burial places of the <b>prophets.</b> Jeremias in his study examines both the archaeological and the literary evidence, in particular the Herod architectural activity and the attestations of [...] and Luke 11:47, and considers the Lives as a witness of popular devotion in the 1st century.The theme of <b>prophets</b> as intercessors for people long after the <b>prophet's</b> death is also present.A major theme is martyrdom of the prophets: six <b>prophets</b> are said to have been martyred.|$|R
5|$|The Sunnah contributed {{much to the}} {{development}} of Islamic law, particularly {{from the end of the}} first Islamic century. Muslim mystics, known as sufis, who were seeking for the inner meaning of the Quran and the inner nature of Muhammad, viewed the <b>prophet</b> of Islam not only as a <b>prophet</b> but also as a perfect human-being. All Sufi orders trace their chain of spiritual descent back to Muhammad.|$|E

5|$|The {{opinion that}} Eclogue 4 was a {{reference}} to the coming of Jesus was not universally held by early members of the early Church, however. St. Jerome, an early Church writer noted for translating the Bible into Latin, specifically wrote that Virgil could not have been a Christian <b>prophet</b> without having accepted Christ, and claimed that anyone that had accepted that Virgil was a pre-Christian <b>prophet</b> was being childish. Classicist Ella Bourne, however, noted that the mere fact that St. Jerome responded to the idea {{is a testament to the}} belief's pervasiveness.|$|E

40|$|When {{speaking}} of <b>prophets</b> in our culture, we usually have the Old Testament classical <b>prophets</b> in mind. At {{the mention of}} prophetic ecstasy the immediate reaction is often, "That would be Saul and the asses or Elijah and the <b>prophets</b> of Baal". A sharp distinction is often made between the so-called primitive <b>prophets</b> and the classical <b>prophets.</b> Bearing {{in mind that the}} Chronicles mention chronicles, prophesies, visions and narratives of various non-classical <b>prophets</b> there is a certain danger that we make a distinction between different prophetic types more sharply than was done in Old Testament times. In this paper ecstasy is treated purely in its own terms...|$|R
50|$|During {{the rule}} of Com (the second), who was the twenty-first-great-grandson of Jared, many <b>prophets</b> {{predicted}} the people would face destruction unless they repented.

The <b>prophets</b> preached to Com, and they blessed him with long life and success.|$|R
25|$|The Latter <b>Prophets</b> {{are divided}} into two groups, the Major <b>prophets</b> (Isaiah, Jeremiah and Ezekiel) and the Twelve Minor <b>Prophets</b> (Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah and Malachi) {{collected}} into a single book.|$|R
5|$|Ahmadiyya, a modern-era movement, {{consider}} Krishna as one {{of their}} ancient prophets.

5|$|And {{although}} it is a literary anachronism to connect Virgil to Erichtho, given that Lucan—the one who popularized Erichtho in literature—was born around fifty years {{after the death of}} Virgil, this connection successfully plays upon the popular Medieval belief that Virgil himself was a magician and <b>prophet.</b>|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} the 7th century Muhammad was {{attacked}} by non-Muslim Arab contemporaries for preaching monotheism. In modern times, criticism has also dealt with Muhammad's sincerity in claiming to be a <b>prophet,</b> his morality, warfare, and his marriages.|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 130 - 135) The {{primary objective}} of this thesis is the analysis of female <b>prophets</b> who have originated religious movements. Female religious leaders of this kind are cross-culturally rare occurrences. This is because men generally occupy these authority positions. In order to discover reliable biographical data on female <b>prophets,</b> {{it was necessary to}} do a comparative analysis of the available literature. The study revealed that 28 known female <b>prophets</b> have existed between 1591 and 1950. Five <b>prophets</b> were from Africa, 17 from America, two from Asia, and four from Europe. Biographical data indicated that the <b>prophets</b> were women of varied characteristics with regard to age, education, religious affiliation, marital status, and family situation. Nevertheless, some biographical patterns were discerned. These patterns indicate characteristics which allowed and encouraged these women to become prophetic leaders. For example, it appears female <b>prophets</b> {{were more likely to have}} conversion experiences and found sects between the ages of 40 - 49. Although they were associated with various religions, generally <b>prophets</b> were raised to be Protestant. It also appears that female <b>prophets</b> were more likely to be married and have small families. Socio-cultural factors affecting the <b>prophets</b> were also discerned. It appears <b>prophets</b> existed in geographical areas associated with Protestant Western religions because these environments encourage prophetic appearances and allow women more opportunities for religious expression. How the <b>prophets</b> affected their environments is also discussed. These <b>prophets</b> are significant in that they set precedents of female leadership and raised questions of equal status for women, as well as established new religious organizations...|$|R

5|$|Banks used {{a number}} of {{keyboards}} during Genesis' career, continually trying out new models, though he used the piano regularly throughout the group's lifetime. In the 1970s, he frequently used the Hammond organ, Hohner Pianet, Mellotron, RMI Electronic Piano and ARP Pro Soloist. In the 1980s, he used the Sequential Circuits <b>Prophet</b> 5 and <b>Prophet</b> 10, the ARP Quadra and various Korg synthesizers. For the Turn It On Again tour in 2007, his main board was a Korg Oasys. As both a guitarist and bassist, Rutherford regularly swapped between the two roles, and his trademark instrument with Genesis, particularly through the 1970s, was a double neck guitar. In the 1980s and beyond, he favoured the Eric Clapton Stratocaster.|$|E
