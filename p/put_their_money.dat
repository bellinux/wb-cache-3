25|$|By October {{customers}} {{appeared to}} be regaining confidence in the bank, when it emerged {{that there had been}} a surge in the number of new accounts which had been opened. People appeared to see Northern Rock as a safe place to <b>put</b> <b>their</b> <b>money,</b> given the current status as a nationalised bank which cannot fail. The bank decided to remove some of their savings products from the market, as the bank has a commitment to take only a 1.5% share of total UK retail deposits.|$|E
25|$|At this point, Haim Arlosoroff visited Nazi Germany to {{negotiate}} the controversial Ha'avara Agreement with the Nazi government, an agreement which allowed for the emigration of Jews to Palestine along with most of their property. The Nazis were happy {{to get rid of}} Jews, but unwilling to allow them to take their property with them. Via this agreement, the Jews had to <b>put</b> <b>their</b> <b>money</b> into a special bank account. This money was then used to purchase German goods for export to Palestine (and other countries). The proceeds of the sale of these goods were given to the Jews on their arrival in Palestine. For the Nazis, this helped them get rid of Jews, while overcoming any attempts at a boycott of Nazi exports (especially from a moral point of view - it was the Jews themselves importing the goods). For the Zionist settlement, this influx of capital gave a much-needed economic boom in the midst of worldwide depression.|$|E

25|$|Washington Airport was {{the first}} to be sold, and the buyers were the Ludingtons. Nicholas S. Ludington and his brother, Charles Townsend Ludington, were co-owners of the Philadelphia Flying Service, a pilot {{training}} school and demonstration airplane manufacturer established in 1922. The Ludingtons became quite wealthy, and in 1929 Charles was {{on the board of directors}} of the Aviation Corporation—an aviation investment company in which some of the richest men in shipping, railroads, and investment banking had <b>put</b> <b>their</b> <b>money.</b> The brothers also were managers of Camden Airport, near Philadelphia. In June 1930, the Ludingtons founded New York-Philadelphia-Washington Airways (soon to be renamed Ludington Airline), an eastern seaboard airline which famous aviator Amelia Earhart joined as Vice President. The Ludingtons sold their airline to Eastern Air Transport in February 1933, and Eastern Air Transport was in turn acquired by North American Aviation a month later. These transactions left the Ludingtons with plenty of cash. On July 8, 1933, Federal Aviation put Washington Airport up for auction. D.C. attorney H. Rozier Dulany, Jr. (son of the famous Virginia horse breeder) held a $255,000 first mortgage against the property and the Ludingtons held a $160,000 second mortgage, payments on which Washington Airport was unable to make. North American Aviation (owner of the Ludington's newly sold airline) passed on the chance to buy the property. At auction on July 17, 1933, an unidentified buyer purchased Washington Airport for $432,000.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{importance}} of the Dutch Baltic trade for Amsterdam and the northern Holland port cities, the Dutch were always keenly interested in what happened around the Sound. Already in the 1640s the Republic had intervened in the Torstenson War of king Christian IV of Denmark with Sweden, putting its thumb in the scales, both by military intervention in favor of the Swedes, and by favoring that country in the subsequent peace mediation that resulted in the Treaty of Brömsebro. Denmark had made itself unpopular in Dutch eyes by siding with Spain in the war and by unilaterally increasing the toll on Dutch shipping. At first there was little the Dutch could do, but when Christian provoked the Swedes to invade Jutland in 1643, the Dutch applauded, but did little more than offer diplomatic support, because the Zeeland and Rotterdam interests were loth to spend good money to defend the Amsterdam interests (the Orangists still being in the ascendant in this period). When the Swedes in consequence showed little enthusiasm to help lower tolls for the Dutch in the peace negotiations of 1644, the States General were finally forced to <b>put</b> <b>their</b> <b>money</b> where their mouth was. A Dutch fleet of 48 warships was assembled that in July, 1645, escorted three hundred Dutch merchant vessels through the Sound, making a show of not paying any toll at all. The Danish monarch watched the imposing spectacle in person from the ramparts of the castle of Helsingør, being politely saluted by the Dutch. The king made no response. A few months later a treaty was signed with the Dutch that formed the basis for their commercial ascendancy throughout the 17th century in the Baltic trade. Tolls for the Dutch were lowered; Dutch shipping would be exempt from visitation by Danish officials; Dutch shipping would be totally exempt from the toll at Glückstadt.|$|E

40|$|While Luoma and Goodstein (1999) find {{increased}} stakeholder representation on {{the boards}} of American companies, Dimovski and Brooks (2004) provide evidence that the Australian initial public offering (IPO) market does not require non equity stakeholder representation on their boards. This paper analyses the change in composition of the boards of large Australian companies post listing. We find a substantial {{increase in the number of}} directors holding equity capital in the firms in which they hold their directorships.

2500|$|The easily {{obtainable}} {{credit that}} had helped create and engorge the real-estate bubble {{continued to be}} a problem for several years to come, and as late as 1997, banks were still making loans that had a low guarantee of being repaid. Loan Officers and Investment staff had a hard time finding anything to invest in that would return a profit. Meanwhile, the extremely low interest rate offered for deposits, such as 0.1%, meant that ordinary Japanese savers were just as inclined to <b>put</b> <b>their</b> <b>money</b> under their beds as they were to put it in savings accounts. Correcting the credit problem became even more difficult as the government began to subsidize failing banks and businesses, creating many so-called [...] "zombie businesses". Eventually a carry trade developed in which money was borrowed from Japan, invested for returns elsewhere and then the Japanese were paid back, with a nice profit for the trader.|$|E
2500|$|The group's first single, [...] "Maybe Tomorrow", {{produced}} by Visconti, was released worldwide on 15 November 1968. It reached the Top Ten in several European countries and Japan, but only number 67 on the US Billboard Hot 100, {{and failed to}} chart in the UK. The US manager of Apple Records, Ken Mansfield, ordered 400,000 copies of the single—considered to be a bold move {{at the time in}} the music business—and pushed for automatic airplay and reviews from newspapers, which he secured. Nevertheless, Mansfield remembered the problems: [...] "We had a great group. We had a great record. We were missing just one thing ... the ability to go out and pick up people, and convince them to <b>put</b> <b>their</b> <b>money</b> on the counter". A second Tom Evans composition, [...] "Storm in a Teacup", was included on an Apple EP promoting Wall's Ice Cream, along with songs by Apple artists such as [...] James Taylor, Mary Hopkin and Jackie Lomax.

An LP containing both singles and titled Maybe Tomorrow was released only in Italy, Germany and Japan. This limited release strategy was thought to be the work of Apple Corps' president, Allen Klein; an Apple Corps' press officer, Tony Bramwell, remembered: [...] " [...] was saying, 'We're not going to issue any more records until I sort out this [...] mess.'" ...|$|E
