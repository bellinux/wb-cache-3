5000|$|Due to {{articles}} {{featured on}} TechCrunch and Digg, the game experienced more network traffic than its servers could handle at its launch in August 2007. In December 2007 Duels {{launched a new}} version of the game, called Duels 2.0. This version introduced female avatars and a new level of strategy with the addition of actions. In summer 2008, additional quests were added to help with non-paying players running short of game gold to buy actions. The multi duel feature of the challenge button was disabled due to an interference with in-game awarding of badges earned but not credited to player accounts. Other added features included multiple ladders for different level brackets, up to ten playable avatars per single <b>player</b> <b>account,</b> and multi item trading. The August expansion [...] "Treasure of Abtu-Khan" [...] was introduced with Noble and Patron challenge coin users having the option to shop in three other in-game stores besides the basic Armory that all duels.com players could use. Challenge Coin users could also choose to respec their avatars into two cat folk races besides the original human and elf options.|$|E
5000|$|Horseland is an {{escalating}} {{system of}} gameplay, where players strive to earn as many points as possible, both for their <b>player</b> <b>account</b> {{as well as}} their individual horses. Players earn points through the training of their horses or dogs. A single player can own many animals of varying breeds and descriptions. While there is no single point goal for their animals, the players are restricted by the trainable lifespan of their horses and dogs. While a horse or a dog can only participate in show training for a period of time, it can participate in ticket training its whole life. When an animal becomes too old for show training, it is offered the option of retirement. Most players do not retire their animals, as it creates [...] "broken lines" [...] where the horses' or dogs' records are wiped off the Horseland database and cannot be found again. However, horses can pass a portion of their earned points to their offspring if they breed before reaching retirement age, and thus an evolving system of gameplay continues through the lineage of the animals that players foster and maintain.Points usually take time, depending on the points. The horse or dog must have all their checkups completed before they show.|$|E
40|$|The {{emergence}} of player account-based gambling {{is a result}} of escalating technological sophistication and the incorporation of these developments into gambling. This term refers to gambling from a centralized account that is linked to an identified individual. Player account-based gambling is increasingly being utilized for multiple forms of Internet, mobile and land-based gambling through player cards and user-names. Player accounts track and store a wealth of data on gambling behaviour and related activities. Gambling research has been justifiably criticized for its reliance on self-report rather than behavioural measures. Research analysing <b>player</b> <b>account</b> data may advance conceptual models, identify behavioural risk factors for problem gambling and evaluate and guide effective policy and responsible gambling programmes. Although research utilizing <b>player</b> <b>account</b> data has unique limitations, it offers considerable benefits for researchers, operators and regulators. Research methodology incorporating the use of <b>player</b> <b>account</b> data stands to make significant contributions to the gambling field...|$|E

30|$|In {{order to}} match {{accounts}} and player names, we first listed the accounts that have minimum edit distance from a given player’s name. We removed whitespaces and transformed all characters to lower case.

40|$|Gambling {{research}} often {{relies on}} self-report and cross-sectional data which {{is limited by}} inaccuracies in recall. Analysis of behavioural data is necessary to advance conceptual understandings of gambling. This paper analysed <b>player</b> <b>account</b> data of 11, 394 customers of a large Australian wagering operator over a ten-year period to investigate characteristics and betting patterns of account holders. Comparisons were made between players based on {{the total number of}} bets placed. More frequent bettors (those with greater total bet frequency counts), made smaller bets, but bet greater total amounts and lost smaller proportions as compared to less frequent bettors. Less frequent bettors bet larger single bets and lost a greater proportion of their total amounts bet. A minority of bettors accounted for a disproportionately high number of bets but lost the lowest proportion of these. The results indicate that players exhibit differential patterns of betting and subgroups of gamblers can be identified and appropriately targeted with player education and responsible gambling strategies...|$|E
