I'm going to take worked-out wheat-land that I can buy as at a fire-sale, rip out the <b>plow-sole,</b> and make it produce more in the end than it did when you fellows first farmed it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{old folks}} schemed and {{gathered}} and added the land {{into the big}} holdings, and built the great barns and mansions, and planted the house orchards and flower gardens. The young folks were spoiled by so much wealth and went away to the cities to spend it. And old folks and young united in one thing: in impoverishing the soil. Year after year they scratched it and took out bonanza crops. They put nothing back. All they left was <b>plow-sole</b> and exhausted land. Why, there's big sections they exhausted and left almost desert.|$|E

You took forty {{thousand}} {{acres of the}} finest Sacramento Valley soil and you grew wheat on it year after year. You never dreamed of rotation. You burned your straw. You exhausted your humus. You plowed four inches and put a <b>plow-sole</b> like a cement sidewalk just four inches under the surface. You exhausted that film of four inches and now you can't get your seed back.|$|E

The Nishinam got it from the Maidu, who got it from the Konkau, who made it. But the Nishinam and the Maidu and the Konkau are gone. Their last rancheria is not. You plowed it under, Mr. Crockett, with you bonanza gang-plowing, <b>plow-soling</b> farming. And I got the song from a certain ethnological report, volume three, of the United States Pacific Coast Geographical and Geological Survey. Red Cloud, who was formed out of the sky, first sang this song to {{the stars and the}} {{mountain}} flowers in the morning of the world. I shall now sing it for you in English." ...|$|R
40|$|The {{principal}} soil fumigants {{and their}} order of discovery are carbon disulfide, chloropicrin, methyl bromide, 1, 3 -dichloropropene, ethylene dibromide, 1, 2 -dibromo- 3 -chloropropane, and methyl isothiocyanate. Biological activity of soil fumigants ranges from limited to broad spectrum. Fumigants diffuse through the continuous soil air space as gases. Physical and chemical characteristics determine diffusion rates, distribution between the soil air and moisture, and sorption onto {{and into the}} soil particles. The principal soil factors affecting the efficacy of each treatment are the size and continuity of air space, moisture, temperature, organic matter, and depth of placement. Application can be made overall with tractor injection or <b>plow-sole,</b> or as a row or bed treatment. Treatment for trees is best made in conjunction with tree site backhoeing...|$|E
40|$|Density and {{diversity}} of bottom fauna population as dependent on sediment types and water depth is largely well known in Kiel Bay. This {{is in contrast to}} structures and processes of bioturbation, although generally it has a big influence on the benthic boundary layer and its processes, e. g., the metabolism of the bottom fauna, the mechanical properties, the age dating, and the large field of chemical processes. In the densely inhabited sands and muddy sands of the shallower waters with sediment thicknesses of some decimeters only, bioturbation is usually ubiquitous, and most of the structures left are monotonously of "biodeformational" character. At greater water depths, however, where a sedimentary column of several meters of Holocene is developed, the X-ray radiographs of numerous sediment cores show heterogeneous biogenic structures with regional and stratigraphical differentiation. They are described in terms of ichnofabrics and are interpreted on ethological knowledge of the related macrobenthos species. lmportant organisms creating specific traces include the bivalve Arctica (Cyprina) islandica and the polychaete worm Pectinaria koreni. These species are abundant in Kiel Bay and produce by their crawling-plowing mode of locomotion, a characteristic biogenic stratification, the "plow-sole structure". Other typical biogenic structures are tube traces, which are left by a number of different polychaetes occurring either singly, or as U-pairs mainly in mud sediments. Although sea urchins are rare to absent in Kiel Bay, layers of their characteristic traces Scolicia occur as witness of paleohydrographic events in channel sediments of the central bay. <b>Plow-sole</b> traces, polychaete-tube ichnofabric, Scolicia layers and alternations of laminated and bioturbated layers are considered as building blocks of a future "ichnostratigraphy" of Kiel Bay...|$|E
