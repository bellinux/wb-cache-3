5000|$|Common {{criticism}} of intensive <b>piggeries</b> {{is that they}} represent a corporatization of the traditional rural lifestyle. Critics feel the rise of intensive <b>piggeries</b> has largely replaced family farming. Between 1982 and 1987 some 21% of Iowa hog farmers went out of business. By 1992, another 12% {{had gone out of}} business. In large part, this is because intensive <b>piggeries</b> are more economical than outdoor systems, pen systems, or the sty. In many pork-producing countries (e.g., United States, Canada, Australia, Denmark) the use of intensive <b>piggeries</b> has led to market rationalization and concentration. The New York Times reported that keeping pigs and other animals in [...] "unnaturally overcrowded" [...] environments poses considerable health risks for workers, neighbors, and consumers.|$|R

25|$|In 1856, the {{settlement}} structures – the two-storey prison/workshop building, stables, barns and <b>piggery</b> were burnt down. Their former locations are {{identified in the}} area between the shops in {{the settlement}} area. The fire was deliberately lit by the superintendent, Henry Vincent, after two prisoners had escaped into nearby bush. Vincent lit the fire {{with the intent of}} flushing the prisoners out of their hiding place. The prevailing winds at the time were blowing away from the buildings; however, the wind changed direction which brought the flames into the settlement. About 50 tons of hay was also destroyed.|$|E
25|$|In 1850, {{the land}} was {{occupied}} by free blacks and Irish immigrants who had purchased land, where they raised livestock, built churches and cemeteries, and had lived as a community for close to 50 years. Before {{the construction of the}} park could start, the area had to be cleared of its inhabitants. Rossi states that part of the impetus to schemes such as Central Park and others was to remove what they incorrectly deemed as shanty towns and their denizens. However, most lived in small villages, such as Harsenville, the <b>Piggery</b> District, or Seneca Village; or in the school and convent at Mount St. Vincent's Academy. Approximately 1,600 residents were evicted under the rule of eminent domain during 1857. Seneca Village and parts of the other communities were razed {{to make room for the}} park. In addition, when the commission finally submitted its report for public examination on October 4, 1855, taxpayers learned that they would be paying $5 million just for the park land, more than three times what they had been told the completed park as a whole would cost. At the same time, the offsetting revenue from property taxes of adjacent land came to $1.7 million, or one-third of the purchase price, and was considerably less than earlier estimates.|$|E
25|$|In the 1830s {{the village}} {{consisted}} of only four houses: the hotel or inn, the smithy, and two toll houses.

The Lugton Inn was sadly destroyed by fire in the early 2000s. The name 'Lugton' is not marked on Timothy Pont's map of 1604. Some of the Lugton area farms are indicated, with Waterlands, Duniflett, Biggart, Roshead (Ramshead), and Knokmend (Knockmade). A Waterland Mill is shown. Armstrong's map of 1775, does not show Lugton or its farms and the only road passes Lochlibo from Glasgow and heads up through the Caldwell estate to Paisley. Thomson's 1820 map marks a 'Keepers Cottage' {{which may have been}} on the main entrance drive running to the main road. The Paraffin Lamp Inn is not marked on the 1860 OS, however it is present on the 1895 edition. It appears to have been called the 'Paraffin Lamp' for many years, prior to which it was a private dwelling with outbuildings. It had a <b>piggery</b> and smokehouse and when it became an inn the dwelling house continued its use as a private home. The old site of Halket Loch lies not far away, once located near the various Halket Farms and that of Lochridgehills Farm.|$|E

40|$|In New Zealand, Trichinella spiralis appears {{absent from}} {{commercial}} pigs, {{and is not}} a significant cause of zoonotic disease. Surveillance testing at slaughter has not ever detected T. spiralis in a commercially raised pig in New Zealand, yet many importing countries still require individual testing of all pig carcases for export. This thesis comprises four studies designed to evaluate the risk of T. spiralis infection in commercial pigs in New Zealand. In the first study, the prevalence of T. spiralis was surveyed in selected populations of rats, cats, stoats and weasels from landfills, <b>piggeries</b> and Department of Conservation lands as they are considered potential reservoirs of T. spiralis for domestic pigs. No positive samples were detected in this survey. The second study investigated rodent activity and baiting efficacy on three commercial <b>piggeries</b> in the Manawatu region of New Zealand over 72 weeks. This study found that while baiting and on-farm sanitation can effectively control rodents, the efficacy of the control depends largely on staff commitment. The third study used a mail questionnaire sent to 123 <b>piggeries,</b> to survey current management practices on commercial <b>piggeries</b> that could pose a risk for Trichinella transmission. The survey had a 69 % response rate and found that risky management practices occur infrequently in commercial <b>piggeries.</b> Lastly, a quantitative risk model was developed comparing individual carcass testing with alternative risk management strategies to assess the annual probability that a consumer in an importing country will eat a pork product of New Zealand origin containing at least one larva per gram of T. spiralis. Offals were found to always be safe. However, the unrestricted risk for fresh pork was over one in a million (1. 87 x 10 - 5), which was above the safety threshold and therefore various risk management options were considered. The strategy of only exporting pigs reared in certified, confined commercial herds has now been accepted and is in place by the importing country. This means that individual carcass testing is no longer compulsory for every exported pig carcass. The overall conclusion from this research established a very low risk of T. spiralis infection and transmission in New Zealand commercial <b>piggeries.</b> These findings have directly led to successfully changing export legislation by removing compulsory carcass testing pre-export, which has advanced New Zealand’s ability to competitively export high quality pork and pork products...|$|R
500|$|The Queensland Ambulance Service (QAS) began {{operations}} on Palm Island in 2000 {{and took over}} from the hospital based service. Presently staffed by two paramedics and three ambulance attendants, they average approx 2200 cases per year. One paramedic is qualified as a Paramedic Practitioner and practices under the guidelines of paramedic practitioners giving the community more health resources and options – this officer assists with sexual health cases and general medical cases including suturing at the local Joyce Palmer Health Service. The QAS is also involved in teaching First Aid to the community, [...] "Adopt an Ambo" [...] programs with both schools, motivational camps for teenagers and local football competitions and works closely with allied health services on the island. The QAS has also started a stinger prevention program with stinger stations having been established in different locations around the island.

2500|$|Pigs are {{naturally}} omnivorous and are generally fed {{a combination of}} grains and protein sources (soybeans, or meat and bone meal). [...] Larger intensive pig farms may be surrounded by farmland where feed-grain crops are grown. [...] Consequently, piggeries are reliant on the grains industry. [...] Pig feed may be bought packaged, in bulk or mixed on-site. [...] The intensive <b>piggery</b> system, where pigs are confined in individual stalls, allows each pig to be allotted a portion of feed. [...] The individual feeding system also facilitates individual medication of pigs through feed. This has more significance to intensive farming methods, as the proximity to other animals enables diseases to spread more rapidly. To prevent disease spreading and encourage growth, drug programs such as vitamins and antibiotics are administered preemptively.|$|E
