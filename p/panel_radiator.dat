40|$|When a {{building}} is heated {{to a steady}} internal temperature, equilibrium is established in which the heat power into the building equals {{the rate at which}} heat is lost from the building. A good approximation of heat losses can be determined using the conventional generic equations which give a relatively accurate value of the heat loss; however these equations can be inaccurate, especially in applications where radiative heating is used. In this article simple predictive tools are developed to estimate the characteristic temperature ratios for both <b>panel</b> <b>radiator</b> and high temperature radiant strip systems. The calculated results can be used in follow up calculations for a model, which fully takes into account the radiation heat transfer occurring within a room space. The results of the proposed method are found to be in excellent agreement with reported data in the literature with average absolute deviation being around 0. 2 %. The predictive tool is simple and straightforward and it can be readily implemented in a standard spreadsheet program. The prime application of the method is as a quick-and-easy evaluation tool in conceptual development and scoping studies where a <b>panel</b> <b>radiator</b> system and a high temperature radiant strip system are being considered.

40|$|We {{present a}} fully parallelized, high-performance, OpenGL-based {{approach}} to compute obstructed area-to-area (A 2 A) view factors for radiative heat transfer. The A 2 A view factors are computed from the defining surface integral by Gaussian quadrature. The {{values of the}} integrand, i. e. the point-to-area view factors, are computed using an OpenGL-based hemicube (HC) method to efficiently solve the obstruction problem by exploiting the hardware-accelerated visibility testing on modern graphics cards. The final steps to maximize hardware usage are rendering the HC and performing the numerical quadrature in parallel such that data transfer times are completely shadowed by computations. To demonstrate the power of our approach we compute the A 2 A view factor matrices for a warehouse equipped with ceramic infrared heaters and a test cabin conforming to EN 442 containing a section of a <b>panel</b> <b>radiator.</b> To judge {{the quality of the}} results we measure the deviation from unity of the area-weighted column sums of the view factor matrix and the error in radiant flux balance.

40|$|The optimum {{radiator}} configuration in hot lunar thermal environments is one {{in which}} the radiator is parallel to the ground and has no view to the hot lunar surface. However, typical spacecraft configurations have limited real estate available for top-mounted radiators, resulting in a desire to use the spacecraft s vertically oriented sides. Vertically oriented, flat panel radiators will have a large view factor to the lunar surface, and thus will be subjected to significant incident lunar infrared heat. Consequently, radiator fluid temperatures will need to exceed approx. 325 K (assuming standard spacecraft radiator optical properties) in order to provide positive heat rejection at lunar noon. Such temperatures are too high for crewed spacecraft applications in which a heat pump is to be avoided. A recent study of vertically oriented radiator configurations subjected to lunar noon thermal environments led to the discovery of a novel radiator concept that yielded positive heat rejection at lower fluid temperatures. This radiator configuration, called the Upright Lunar Terrain Radiator Assembly (ULTRA), has exhibited superior performance to all previously analyzed concepts in terms of heat rejection in the lunar noon thermal environment. A key benefit of the ULTRA is the absence of louvers or other moving parts and its simple geometry. Analysis of the ULTRA for a lunar extravehicular activity (EVA) portable life support system (PLSS) is shown to provide moderate heat rejection, on average, at all solar incident angles assuming an average radiator temperature of 294 K, whereas prior concepts exhibited insignificant heat rejection or heat absorption at higher incident angles. The performance of the ULTRA for a lunar lander is also discussed and compared to the performance of a vertically oriented, flat <b>panel</b> <b>radiator</b> at various lunar latitudes...|$|E
40|$|Tez (Yüksek Lisans) [...] İstanbul Teknik Üniversitesi, Fen Bilimleri Enstitüsü, 1999 Thesis (M. Sc.) [...] İstanbul Technical University, Institute of Science and Technology, 1999 Ülkemizdeki ısıtma sistemlerinde doğal gazın yakıt olarak kullanılmaya başlanması ile birlikte bireysel ısıtma daha fazla tercih edilen bir uygulama haline gelirken radyatör kullanımında da önemli artışlar olmuştur. Bireysel ve merkezi ısıtma uygulamalarında değişik malzemelerden ve değişik tiplerde radyatörler kullanılmaktadır. Radyatör seçimindeki önemli kriterler maliyet, birim ısıl verim, kullanım ömrü, ısıtma sistemlerine uygunluğu ve rejime girme süreleridir. Enerji tasarrufu sağlaması açısından radyatörlerin rejime girme süreleri, seçilen ısıtma sistemine uygunluk ve birim ısıl verimleri son derece önemlidir. Bu çalışmada ısıtma cihazlarının ısıl davranışları incelenmiş farklı malzemelerdeki radyatör tipleri için {{transfer}} fonksiyonları çıkartılarak, bu fonksiyonların zaman sabitleri hesaplanmıştır. Sıcak su panel radyatöre girdiğinde, radyatörün kanalları içinde soğumakta olan suyla, arasında bir miktar karışma meydana gelecektir. Mükemmel karışımın belirtisi su sıcaklığının radyatör boyunca aynı sıcaklıkta olmasıdır. Panel radyatörün ısıl reaksiyonu;As {{the individual}} heating becomes a more preferred application within {{the beginning of}} natural gas usage at the heating systems in our country, there also have been increases in radiator using. Radiators of different materials and with different types are being used in individual and central heating. The most important creations in radiator selection is cost, thermal output per unit, life time, appropriateness to heating system and time constant. Time constant, appropriateness to the heating system chosen and thermal output per unit are very important {{in the case of}} saving energy. With this work, the thermal attitudes of heating equipment have been examined and the time constants of transfer functions found for the radiators of different types have been calculated. When hot water enters a <b>panel</b> <b>radiator</b> some mixing will occur between it and water already cooling in radiator's channels. The symptom of perfect mixing would be that the water temperature throughout the radiator. The equation for the thermal response of the panel radiator; CR =mwater cwater + mmetal cmetal Transfer function of systems is explained; The time constant of systems is explained; In some designs of low water content radiator, the radiator channels consist in fact of a small number of pipes bonded to the convector surface. Very little mixing would be expected to take place in such an arrangement. The equation for the thermal response of the aluminum radiator; Cm: Thermal capacity of metal = mmetal cmetal Transfer function of systems is explained; The time constant of systems is explained; In the much older column radiator the thermal mass of iron columns may not be correctly modeled by simply aggregating it with the water content as was inferred earlier for the steel <b>panel</b> <b>radiator.</b> In effect this gives two equations describing the radiator dynamics; Transfer function of systems is explained; The time constant of systems is explained; The risk of instability and system gain had been examined by comparing radiator output at different flow temperatures. The risk of instability therefore occurs at low load condition. The risk can be reduced by separately reducing the flow temperatures in accordance with external load. In addition to this it was given transfer function at fluctuations in water flow rate and fluctuations flow temperature by examining behavior of coils, embedded heating panels. For fluctuations in water flow rate: For fluctuations in water flow temperature: (? = ?c 0 / v) The BSRIA model estimates these time constants on the basis of length of tubes per circuit actively transferring heat, the number of tubes per header, the water velocity in the tube and the air velocity through the heat exchanger. It has been seen that the time constants of aluminum radiators are shorter than the other radiator types. Panel, iron and steel radiators are following aluminum radiators. Radiators, which have shorter time constant, will be adept to any changes in the systems. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|E
