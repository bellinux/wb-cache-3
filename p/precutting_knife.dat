40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} the clinical outcome of double balloon enteroscopy (DBE) -assisted {{endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography}} (DB-ERCP) in patients with altered gastrointestinal anatomy. METHODS: Between September 2006 and April 2011, 47 procedures of DB-ERCP were performed in 28 patients with a Roux-en-Y total gastrectomy (n = 11), Billroth II gastrectomy (n = 15), or Roux-en-Y anastomosis with hepaticojejunostomy (n = 2). DB-ERCP was performed using a short-type DBE combined with several technical innovations such as using an endoscope attachment, marking by submucosal tattooing, selectively applying contrast medium, and CO 2 insufflations. RESULTS: The papilla of Vater or hepaticojejunostomy site was reached in its entirety with a 96 % success rate (45 / 47 procedures). There {{were no significant differences}} in the success rate of reaching the blind end with a DBE among Roux-en-Y total gastrectomy (96 %), Billroth II reconstruction (94 %), or pancreatoduodenectomy (100 %), respectively (P = 0. 91). The total successful rate of cannulation and contrast enhancement of the target bile duct in patients whom the blind end was reached with a DBE was 40 / 45 procedures (89 %). Again, there {{were no significant differences in}} the success rate of cannulation and contrast enhancement of the target bile duct with a DBE among Roux-en-Y total gastrectomy (88 %), Billroth II reconstruction (89 %), or pancreatoduodenectomy (100 %), respectively (P = 0. 67). Treatment was achieved in all 40 procedures (100 %) in patients whom the contrast enhancement of the bile duct was successful. Common endoscopic treatments were endoscopic biliary drainage (24 procedures) and extraction of stones (14 procedures). Biliary drainage was done by placement of plastic stents. Stones extraction was done by lithotomy with the mechanical lithotripter followed by extraction with a basket or by the balloon pull-through method. Endoscopic sphincterotomy was performed in 14 procedures with a needle <b>precutting</b> <b>knife</b> using a guidewire. The mean total duration of the procedure was 93. 6 1; 6. 8 min and the mean time required to reach the papilla was 30. 5 1; 3. 7 min. The mean time required to reach the papilla tended to be shorter in Billroth II reconstruction (20. 9 1; 5. 8 min) than that in Roux-en-Y total gastrectomy (37. 1 1; 4. 9 min) but there was no significant difference (P = 0. 09). A major complication occurred in one patient (3. 5 %); perforation of the long limb in a patient with Billroth II anastomosis. CONCLUSION: Short-type DBE combined with several technical innovations enabled us to perform ERCP in most patients with altered gastrointestinal anatomy...|$|E
40|$|Aims To {{evaluate}} the safety, effectiveness, success rate and complications of needle <b>knife</b> <b>precut</b> papillotomy for inaccessible bile duct after failed pancreatic ducts access. Methods Selective {{common bile duct}} cannulation was required for 582 patients from November 2004 to May 2008. Precut sphincterotomy was performed in 28 patients (16 male, 12 female; mean age 71). When standard bile duct cannulation was unsuccessful after more than 20 minutes, the bile duct was considered inaccessible. Group A consisted of patients where pancreatic duct access was possible and transpancreatic papillary septotomy was performed (20 patients). If pancreatic duct cannulation also failed, needle <b>knife</b> <b>precut</b> method was performed and these patients belonged to group B (8 patients). The success and complication rates {{of the two groups}} were compared using the Chi-square test. Results The success rates were 85 % and 87. 5 % respectively. Of the 28 patients in group A, 6 had mild to moderate pancreatitis and one patient had mild bleeding. The complication rates were 35 % and 0 % respectively and the differences were not significant. Conclusion Needle <b>knife</b> <b>precut</b> papillotomy is useful and acceptable in patients after failed pancreatic duct access...|$|R
40|$|AIM: Prospective {{evaluation}} of repeat {{endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography}} (ERCP) for failed Schutz grade 1 biliary cannulation in a high-volume center. METHODS: Prospective intention-to-treat analysis of patients referred for biliary cannulation following recent unsuccessful ERCP. RESULTS: Fifty-one patients (35 female; mean age: 62. 5 years; age range: 40 - 87 years) with previous failed biliary cannulation were referred for repeat ERCP. The indication for ERCP was primarily choledocholithiasis (45 %) or pancreatic malignancy (18 %). Successful biliary cannulation was 100 %. The <b>precut</b> needle <b>knife</b> sphincterotomy (NKS) rate was 27. 4 %. Complications occurred in 3. 9 % (post-ERCP pancreatitis). An identifiable reason for initial unsuccessful biliary cannulation was present in 55 % of cases. Compared to a cohort of 940 naïve papilla patients (female 61 %; mean age: 59. 9 years; age range: 18 - 94 years) who required sphincterotomy over the same time period, there was no statistical difference in the cannulation success rate (100 % vs 98 %) or post-ERCP pancreatitis (3. 1 % vs 3. 9 %). Precut NKS use was more frequent (27. 4 % vs 12. 7 %) (P = 0. 017). CONCLUSION: Referral to a high-volume center following unsuccessful ERCP is associated with high technical success, with a favorable complication rate, compared to routine ERCP procedures...|$|R
40|$|Aim. We {{aimed to}} develop a {{simulation}} dry model for endoscopic sphincterotomy (ES) and needle <b>knife</b> <b>precut</b> sphincterotomy (NKP) and to evaluate its usefulness as a training simulator. Materials and Methods. An endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography trainer {{was used as a}} duodenum, bile duct, and papilla simulator. A simulated papilla was created with a piece of rolled uncured ham, and ES and NKP were performed. Hands-on training was carried out using this model, and success and failure of the procedures were evaluated. A questionnaire survey was conducted among the participants to assess the performance and usefulness of the dry model for ES and NKP training. Results. Twenty-two endoscopists participated in the hands-on training using this dry model. ES was successful in 33 out of 34 attempts (97 %) whereas NKP was successful in all 7 attempts (100 %). Based on the results of the questionnaire survey, the median score for realism was 7 (range: 2 – 9) for ES and 8 for NKP on a scale of 1 to 10. Conclusions. The dry model using an uncured ham provides a condition closely similar to actual clinical practice and is useful as a training model for ES and NKP...|$|R
