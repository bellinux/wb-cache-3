40|$|Where {{international}} human rights instruments lack explicit prohibitions on refoulement, non-refoulement obligations are read into other substantive rights. In this context, state responsibility is engaged by the act of removal of an individual to a state {{where he or she}} will be exposed to a certain degree of risk of having his or her human rights violated. In its so-called medical cases, the European Court appears to position the source of the risk to which removal exposes the individual, in terms of whether it emanates from circumstances that can give rise to the responsibility of the destination state or not, as a significant factor in establishing the proper scope of <b>protection</b> <b>from</b> <b>refoulement</b> under the ECHR. In light of this, this article argues that there is something problematic about the use of the ‘removal plus risk’ formulation to read prohibitions on refoulement into human rights provisions. This is linked to the failure of the European Court adequately to address the legal basis for reading non-refoulement obligations into the prohibition on torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. It is the contention of this article that none of the possible legal bases identified in the academic commentary really offer a solid foundation upon which to base implicit non-refoulement obligations and, in this sense, non-refoulement under the ECHR is a castle built on sand...|$|E
40|$|Every year, {{millions}} of people are seeking <b>protection</b> <b>from</b> countries other than their own for fear of being tortured, persecuted or killed. Finding protection is not easy. States are closely guarding their borders, making it difficult for aliens to seek and enjoy <b>protection</b> <b>from</b> serious harm. No matter where they are or why they flee, people seeking international protection are vulnerable and insecure; in dire need of knowing, understanding and receiving their rights. This book explores the basic right of every forcibly displaced person to be protected <b>from</b> <b>refoulement.</b> The prohibition of refoulement is the cornerstone of international refugee and asylum law and aims to provide protection to people at risk of persecution, torture, inhuman treatment or other human rights violations upon return to their own country. This book provides a comprehensive legal analysis of prohibitions of refoulement contained in four human rights treaties: the Refugee Convention, the European Convention on Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention against Torture. The emphasis of the analysis is on the international meaning of the prohibitions of refoulement and on the responsibilities of States deriving from these prohibitions. The four treaties are analysed in separate chapters. The final chapter compares the prohibitions of refoulement contained in the four investigated treaties. This book will be an important resource for legal scholars, students and practitioners working with asylum seekers and refugees throughout the world. It is also a reminder for States, which have obliged themselves to protect people from becoming victims of unspeakable atrocities. Promotor: P. Boeles, B. P. VermeulenWith summary in Dutc...|$|R
50|$|As {{repatriation}} can be voluntary {{or forced}} {{the term is}} also used as a euphemism for deportation. Involuntary or forced repatriation is the return of refugees, prisoners of war, or civil detainees to {{their country of origin}} under circumstances that leave no other viable alternatives. According to contemporary international law, prisoners of war, civil detainees, or refugees refusing repatriation, particularly if motivated by fears of political persecution in their own country, should be protected <b>from</b> <b>refoulement</b> and given, if possible, temporary or permanent asylum. The forced return of people to countries where they would face persecution is more specifically known as refoulement, which is against international law.|$|R

Resettlement might be an option when it enables safe family reunification in the resettlement country, or when it protects a child <b>from</b> <b>refoulement</b> or persecution or other serious human rights violations in the country of destination. This might be the case when a child victim of trafficking has to be protected from reprisals or renewed recruitment by traffickers. Unless it poses any risks to the child, the child’s parents need to be informed, consulted and heard in the assessment and resettlement process.|$|R
40|$|The United States {{operates}} a Migrant Interdiction Program (MIP) outside its territorial sea and in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. This thesis provides a legal {{analysis of the}} MIP {{as it relates to}} Haitian and Cuban nationals interdicted by the United States. This thesis examines the MIP {{from the perspective of the}} United States’ municipal law, as well as a range of applicable international laws including international maritime, human rights and refugee law. This thesis argues that the United States’ MIP is largely compliant with its own municipal law and international maritime law, with the important exception of the United States’ practice of turning rescue operations into interdiction operations. However, the MIP places the United States in breach of numerous obligations under international human rights and refugee law. This thesis argues that the most viable means of remedying these violations is for the United States to cease the practice of turning rescue operations into interdictions; refrain from the use of Guantánamo Bay as a refugee processing and detention facility; conduct all status determinations in the United States; and resettle individuals owed <b>protection</b> <b>from</b> <b>refoulement</b> in the United States. This thesis will also argue that interdictees and their advocates cannot turn to the international legal regime or to the courts of the United States to compel the United States’ executive to abide by its international obligations. This is because of the lack of effective enforcement mechanisms in the international legal regime. Furthermore, international human rights and refugee law obligations discussed in this thesis are not enforceable in the courts of the United States without additional implementing legislation. The United States has not implemented all of its international obligations in municipal law, and those obligations that have been implemented are unlikely to apply to the United States’ executive in international waters and in Guantánamo Bay...|$|E
40|$|This article {{considers}} whether, in {{the context}} of armed conflicts, certain non-refoulement obligations of non-belligerent States can be derived from the 1949 Geneva Conventions. According to Common Article 1 (CA 1) thereof, all High Contracting Parties (HCPs) undertake to ‘respect and to ensure respect’ for the four conventions ‘in all circumstances’. It is contended that CA 1 applies both in international armed conflicts (IACs) and in non-international armed conflicts (NIACs). In turn, it is suggested that Common Article 3 (CA 3) which regulates conduct in NIACs serves as a ‘minimum yardstick’ also applicable in IACs. It is widely (though not uniformly) acknowledged that the undertaking to ‘ensure respect’ in a given armed conflict extends to HCPs that are not parties to it; nevertheless, the precise scope of this undertaking is subject to scholarly debate. This article concerns situations where, in the course of an (international or non-international) armed conflict, persons ’taking no active part in hostilities’ flee from States where violations of CA 3 are (likely to be) occurring to a non-belligerent State. Based on the undertaking in CA 1, the central claim of this article is that, as long as risk of exposure to these violations persists, persons should not be refouled notwithstanding possible assessment of whether they qualify as refugees based on the 1951 Refugee Convention definition, or could be eligible for complementary or subsidiary forms of protection that are regulated in regional arrangements. The analysis does not affect the explicit <b>protection</b> <b>from</b> <b>refoulement</b> that the Fourth Geneva Convention accords to ‘protected persons’ (as defined in Article 4 thereof). It is submitted that CA 1 should be read in tandem with other obligations of non-belligerent States under the 1949 Geneva Conventions. Most pertinently, all HCPs are required to take specific measures to repress ‘grave breaches’ and to take measures necessary for the suppression of all acts contrary to the 1949 Geneva Conventions other than the grave breaches. A HCP that is capable of protecting displaced persons from exposure to risks of violations of CA 3 and nonetheless refoules them to face such risks is arguably failing to take lawful measures at its disposal in order to suppress acts contrary to the conventions and, consequently, fails to ‘ensure respect’ for the conventions.
