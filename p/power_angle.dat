50|$|A {{power system}} {{consists}} {{of a number of}} synchronous machines operating synchronously under all operating conditions. Under normal operating conditions, the relative position of the rotor axis and the resultant magnetic field axis is fixed. The angle between the two is known as the <b>power</b> <b>angle</b> or torque angle. During any disturbance, the rotor deaccelerates or accelerates with respect to the synchronously rotating air gap mmf, creating relative motion. The equation describing the relative motion is known as the swing equation, which is a non-linear second order differential equation that describes the swing of the rotor of synchronous machine. The power exchange between the mechanical rotor and the electrical grid due to the rotor swing (acceleration and deceleration) is called Inertial response.|$|E

The input of the RSW system is the firing angle of the silicon-controlled rectifier (SCR) during each control cycle. Wrongly choosing a firing angle may induce disastrous consequence. The range of firing angle depends on the system's power factor angle; {{the relation between the}} firing <b>angle,</b> <b>power</b> factor <b>angle</b> and conduction angle is highly non-linear. After comparing three methods, a simple mathematical model is proposed in this study to facilitate the online calculation of the <b>power</b> factor <b>angle</b> and selection of the proper firing angle, so that the safety operation of RSW system can be guaranteed.

40|$|The {{power factor}} {{is a very}} {{important}} process variable in ac resistance spot welding (RSW) operation. Because of the variation of welding load during the welding process, the power factor is a time-varying variable. The power factor of RSW cannot be obtained online because the value of <b>power</b> factor <b>angle</b> cannot be directly measured in real time. After analyzing the electrical structure of RSW, a new algorithm for measuring the <b>power</b> factor <b>angle</b> in real time is developed. Then, an integrated algorithm for calculating the power factor on a practical discrete system in real time is proposed. Experiments were conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
