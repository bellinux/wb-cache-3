Led by Đurđe Ninković, son of the hotel's owner Milorad Ninković, they occupied the hotel from March 3rd until March 30th employing the principles of direct action, unhappy at seeing the family property sold by the Serbian government without having passed a denationalization law or a restitution law for property seized by the FPR/SFR Yugoslavia communist regime. Instead, the government based the tender auction on the current privatization law, setting the hotel's initial price at €1.2 million.|$|R

40|$|In {{this article}} I discuss the complex {{relationship}} among privatization, company restructuring after privatization, and corporate performance in Hungary {{during the first}} nine years of the transition. The analysis is based on two large samples of the Hungarian companies. The first group embraces all companies with double entry book-keeping. The second, smaller group consists {{of the companies that}} are subordinated to the state <b>privatization</b> <b>agencies.</b> Corporate performance is measured by a set of indicators that cover the companies' profitability, efficiency, labor productivity and financial state. A statistical and a multi-regression analysis are applied to describe the relationship between ownership change and corporate performance. Based on the above analysis I show that the transforming enterprise is a special blend of the ‘textbook company’ during restructuring, as it is described by the theory of industrial organization and by the institutionalist theory of the firm, and a ‘mutant’ state-owned enterprise that operates under extreme uncertainties. ...|$|R

50|$|Despite these problems, {{the process}} of {{unification}} moved ahead, albeit slowly. The Treuhand, staffed almost entirely by Germans from the west, became the virtual government of eastern Germany. In the course of <b>privatization,</b> the <b>agency</b> decided which companies would live and which would die, which communities would thrive and which would shrivel, and which eastern Länder would be prosperous and which would not.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{estimated}} that the costs of remediating contaminated sites in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) will be very high. These contingent environmental liabilities have emerged precisely at the time CEE countries are attempting to privatize their capital stocks, creating major challenges for <b>privatization</b> <b>agencies.</b> It is also generally agreed that an inadequate handling of these liabilities in the past has reduced sales of state-owned enterprises in Central and Eastern Europe. This paper uses an analytical model to identify optimal policies for minimizing the damage to privatization processes from environmental liabilities. Policy simulations are conducted which evaluate the effects of the use of liability indemnifications and environmental audits on privatization sales, prices and government revenues net of environmental costs. The major finding of the paper is that goals to mitigate the effects of environmental liability on privatizations and maximize government net revenues from privatization sales require equivalent environmental liability policies. Both goals require optimal provision of information and indemnifications to investors, and moreover it is found that the two policies are complementary rather than substitutes.

50|$|Even before {{economic}} unification, the West German {{government had}} decided {{that one of its}} first tasks was to privatize the East German economy. For this reason, it had taken over in June the Treuhandanstalt (Trust Agency, commonly known as Treuhand), which had been established by the GDR to take over East German firms and to turn them over to new management through <b>privatization.</b> The <b>agency</b> assumed the assets and liabilities of about 8,000 East German enterprises in order to sell them to German and other bidders. By the time the Treuhand was disbanded at the end of 1994, it had privatized some 14,000 enterprises. The policies of the Treuhand were not universally welcomed, and the CEO Detlev Karsten Rohwedder was assassinated in Düsseldorf in 1991.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} unified {{theoretical}} framework {{to discuss the}} costs and benefits of privatization using the recent advances of Incentive Theory. I begin by presenting a simple model in which the State (the principal) delegates a task (e. g., the production of a public good) to the private sector (the agent). I give and discuss conditions for the “Irrelevance Theorem” due to Sappington and Stiglitz [Sappington, D., & Stiglitz, J. (1987) Journal of Policy Analysis and Management, 6, 567 – 582] to hold under complete contracting. I then show how various contract incompletenesses can make either public or private ownership optimal. Finally, I provide critical assessments of these results.

50|$|However, the {{privatization}} efforts were ultimately unsuccessful despite some public interest from Aeroflot and Air India. The privatization tender was opened on July 31, 2008 by the Serbian Government's <b>Privatization</b> <b>Agency</b> with a starting price for 51% stake set at US$51 million. Prospective buyers could buy from 51% up to 70% {{stake in the}} company. But, until the tender's closing date on September 26, 2008, no one submitted an offer. As a result, Serbian Government decided to restructure the company, rather than calling another tender with a lower starting price.|$|E

[...] The changes would include an emphasis upon <b>privatization</b> and the <b>agency</b> embarked on its goal with a new approach in the 1980s.

40|$|Legally {{adopted in}} France and the UK, {{privatization}} of water services is still vigorously debated in the Netherlands. Advocates of privatization {{believe it is}} the best way to save on utility costs and to increase their transparency. Opponents believe that the Dutch water sector already provides high quality services for low prices, including an additional public performance that is expected to be excluded in a free market. The author argues that the performance of water service providers should not be assessed only in terms of efficiency, but in terms of the effects on the entire water system as well as the protection of small customers. It is quite possible that without <b>privatization,</b> a public <b>agency</b> could also improve its efficiency and become more competitive in relation to other service providers. Privatization seems to be more a matter of political ideology (based on a belief that the public sector operates inefficiently) than a matter of hard facts. The success of privatization depends at least on the performance of a complementary public regulatory regime. The question should not be whether the public or the private sector performs better hypothetically, but how the actual performance regarding public goods and services can be improved...|$|R
50|$|A {{good example}} of interim {{management}} benefitting from a geo-political change was its use by the German <b>privatization</b> <b>agency</b> after reunification of East and West, post 1989.

Demand continued {{to grow in the}} 1990s in Germany as the economy struggled to deal with unification, recession and resultant ambitious economic forecasts for the ‘new’ economy.

40|$|Uruguay is carring out an {{incipient}} {{regulatory reform}} process in telecommunication sector. The reform stresses on {{the liberalization of}} all services but fixed telephone and national long distance, {{and the creation of}} a regulatory <b>agency.</b> <b>Privatization</b> of the national utility is not foreseen. The liberalization of the mobile market requires the use of a scarce resource, the spectrum, that limits the number of possible entrants, thus it was decided to regulate the access through an auction. Licences auctions for mobile provoked a revolution in auction theory. Due to the special characteristics of the object to be auctioned, several designs were developed and applied in different countries. Finally, British auction in multiple rounds was adopted as a consensus design. This kind of desing is better than others used previously, but it is sensitive to some details that influence too much on the auctioneer results. In this paper we analyze the Uruguayan auction design compared to those used in other countries as well as its implementation details. The auction processus is having important problems related to political issues, the relationship with regional telecommunication markets and economic crisis, rather than the auction design itself. In this paper we discuss the relevance of all this elements in promoting competition in mobile market. ...|$|R
40|$|Governments {{increasingly}} rely on {{forms of}} privatisation to provide critical public infrastructure yet when those infrastructures {{fail to meet}} community expectations government bears {{the political and economic}} risks, being held accountable by the public as steward for those infrastructures. Reconfiguration of the contractual relationships may achieve better stewardship. Many of the forms of <b>privatization</b> rely on <b>Agency</b> theory prescriptions, conceptualizing organisations and individuals as motivated solely by self-interest. Stewardship theory (Van Slyke 2007) has developed as a complement to Agency theory offering the possibility of contractual relationships which maximize stewardship outcome. Stewardship theory asserts that pro-stewardship factors cause the agent/steward to act {{in the interests of the}} principal. This research has interrogated the literature finding that of the pro-stewardship factors, sense of responsibility is pre-eminent and has a significant link to the agent acting as a steward. The research has explored how important it is that the steward feel sense of responsibility and the actions that sense of responsibility. Case studies of privatized core elements of urban water systems infrastructure were explored. Data has been gathered primarily from archival sources and individual interviews of government and private sector executives key to those systems. This paper reports the findings as to the extent of stewardship, how important it is that the steward acts in the interests of the principal, even to the steward’s detriment and the importance of the steward feeling a sense of responsibility. The actions which increase that sense of responsibility will be assembled to position the research to better proceed with the analysis of the data as to these actions...|$|R

The Department contracted with FMHI again in FY 02 - 03, expanding the evaluation to include all counties that began implementing CBC in FY 01 - 02 : Hillsborough, DeSoto, Okaloosa, Escambia, Santa Rosa, and Walton Counties. The CBC Evaluation Plan has been designed in keeping with the legislative intent for CBC (s. 409. 1671, F. S.), which is to assess quality of service, programmatic outcomes, and cost-efficiency of the CBC sites. Previous experience with the implementation of <b>privatization</b> and lead <b>agencies</b> {{in other parts of the}} nation has been inconsistent. In some cases the implementations were successful, while in others they have failed. Likewise, some implementations have achieved the promised benefits of privatization such as increased flexibility or reduced cost, and some have not, depending on local conditions and the implementation strategies used. However, a consistent finding is that in most cases, implementation took longer than expected (Gibelman 2 ̆ 6 Demone, 1998). Because Florida’s CBC initiative is still quite new in most counties, it is too soon to conclude whether the reform has succeeded or failed. Consequently, this evaluation focuses on preliminary outcomes and the advantages and disadvantages of privatization as it has been implemented in Florida thus far. This report’s goal is to provide policymakers with concrete information and recommendations about next steps and mid-course corrections...|$|R
