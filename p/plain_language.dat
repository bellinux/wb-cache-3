5|$|Justice Stephen Breyer {{delivered}} {{the opinion of}} the court on April 19, 2004. Breyer believed that the question the Court needed to answer was whether Congress had the authority to relax restrictions that had been imposed on an Indian tribe's inherent sovereignty. He noted that the intent of Congress was clear, not only based on the <b>plain</b> <b>language</b> of the statute, but also from its legislative history.|$|E
5|$|The {{book was}} {{noted for its}} heft, {{in terms of its}} actual page numbers, {{exhaustive}} research, and dense academic language. The writing does occasionally include illustrative anecdotes and some <b>plain</b> <b>language.</b> Rifkin synthesizes research and material from fields such as literature and the arts, theology, philosophy, anthropology, sociology, political science, psychology, and communication theory. The book was described as sociobiology. The Empathic Civilization was contrasted to the book Crisis Economics by Nouriel Roubini and Stephen Mihm, as reaching different conclusions but being complementary by offering valid alternative futures different from contemporary belief in social progress.|$|E
50|$|Clouse and Clouse (1993) note {{many of the}} Lakes <b>Plains</b> <b>{{languages}}</b> share several unusual phonological features. While Papuan languages {{typically have}} at least two nasal phonemes, {{this is not the case}} for Lakes <b>Plains</b> <b>languages.</b> Although phonetic nasals do exist in most Lakes <b>Plains</b> <b>languages,</b> they do not contrast with the corresponding voiced stops. Doutai, Sikaritai and Obokuitai lack even phonetic nasals. Additionally, no Lakes <b>Plains</b> <b>language</b> has a liquid phoneme. Clouse (1997) reconstructs for the ancestor of Lakes Plains the typologically remarkable consonant inventory, consisting entirely of stops, /p, t, k, b, d/.|$|R
50|$|The small {{consonant}} inventory {{is typical}} of Lakes <b>Plain</b> <b>languages.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Sikaritai has six vowels.Many other Lakes <b>Plain</b> <b>languages</b> have {{developed}} a series of extra high [...] "fricativized" [...] vowels {{from the loss of}} a final consonant. In Sikaritai the final consonants have been retained; however, extra-high i and u appear as allophones of /i/ and /u/ before final /g/ and /d/. Martin postulates that Sikaritai {{is in the process of}} developing contrastive fricativized vowels as other Lakes <b>Plain</b> <b>languages</b> have done.|$|R
5|$|On April 25, 1968, {{the case}} was reargued. The tribe was again {{represented}} by Hobbs, who made the same basic argument that the hunting and fishing rights were not extinguished. The state of Wisconsin was represented by Bronson La Follette, the Attorney General of Wisconsin. La Follette argued that the <b>plain</b> <b>language</b> of the termination act not only ended federal supervision of the tribe, but extinguished the tribe and with it all treaty rights. He argued that the Court of Claims ruling was incorrect and should be reversed, and that the tribe was due compensation from the federal government. The United States was again represented by Claiborne, who reiterated his earlier argument.|$|E
5|$|Swedish {{heraldry}} encompasses heraldic {{achievements in}} modern and historic Sweden. Swedish heraldic style {{is consistent with}} the German-Nordic heraldic tradition, noted for its multiple helmets and crests which are treated as inseparable from the shield, its repetition of colours and charges between the shield and the crest, and its scant use of heraldic furs. Because the medieval history of the Nordic countries was so closely related, their heraldic individuality developed rather late. Swedish and Finnish heraldry have a shared history prior to the Diet of Porvoo in 1809; these, together with Danish heraldry, were heavily influenced by German heraldry. Unlike the highly stylized and macaronic language of English blazon, Swedish heraldry is described in <b>plain</b> <b>language,</b> using (in most cases) only Swedish terminology.|$|E
5|$|In English, {{achievements}} of arms are usually described (blazoned) in a specialized jargon that uses derivatives of French terms. In Swedish, however, {{achievements of}} arms {{are described in}} relatively <b>plain</b> <b>language,</b> using only Swedish terms and tending to avoid specialized jargon. Examples {{include the use of}} Swedish blå and grön for blue and green, as compared to the French-derived azure and vert used in English blazon. Rather than argent, the Swedish words silver or vit (white) are used, and white, while rare, may be a different color than silver. Purpur (purple) is used in the lining of crowns and in the royal canopy of the greater national coat of arms. Traditionally, purple was rarely used as a tincture on the shield, though it does appear on the shields of some (especially modern) burgher arms. Ermine likewise appears in the lining of the mantling over the greater national coat of arms, but is otherwise virtually unknown in Swedish heraldry. Vair is also rare in Scandinavian heraldry, and other furs are unknown.|$|E

25|$|In the U.S., Conservative Friends {{are part}} of three small Quaker Yearly Meetings in Ohio, North Carolina and Iowa; Ohio Yearly Meeting (Conservative) is {{generally}} considered to be the most Bible-centred of the three Conservative Friends Yearly Meetings, retaining Christian Quakers who use the <b>plain</b> <b>language,</b> who continue to wear plain dress, and who live in small villages or rural areas; more than the Conservative Friends from the other two Conservative Friends Yearly Meetings.|$|E
25|$|In the UK, {{the acronym}} STEP or PEST is used (peace, equality, {{simplicity}} and truth). In his book Quaker Speak, British Friend Alastair Heron, lists the following {{ways in which}} British Friends testify to God: Opposition to betting and gambling, capital punishment, conscription, hat honour (the largely historical practice of dipping one's hat toward social superiors), oaths, slavery, times and seasons, tithing and promotion of integrity (or truth), peace, penal reform, <b>plain</b> <b>language,</b> relief of suffering, simplicity, social order, Sunday observance, sustainability, temperance and moderation.|$|E

50|$|Unusual phonological {{features}} of Obokuitai and other Lakes <b>Plain</b> <b>languages</b> are the {{complete lack of}} nasals, even allophones, {{and a series of}} extra high or fricativized vowels that developed from loss of a following stop consonant.|$|R
25|$|Meanwhile, {{mainstream}} publishers {{were more}} reticent. A {{relationship between the}} female Marvel Comics characters Mystique and Destiny was only implied at first, then cryptically confirmed in 1990 {{through the use of}} the archaic word , meaning a lover or sweetheart. Only in 2001 was Destiny referred to in <b>plain</b> <b>language</b> as Mystique's lover. Previously, WildStorm's Image Comics had featured Sarah Rainmaker of Gen¹³ as a character with an interest in other women, and had openly depicted homosexual relationships between the members of the Authority, such as Jenny Sparks and Swift.|$|E
25|$|In {{reaction}} to the federal prosecution and eventual imprisonment of 18-year-old political activist Sherman Austin for hosting bomb-making instructions entitled Reclaim Guide on his web site, Dr. Touretzky provided a mirror on his Carnegie Mellon website {{for more than two}} years, although he acknowledged on the website that his own reposting of the information did not violate the <b>plain</b> <b>language</b> of the statute under which Austin was convicted. In May 2004, to avoid harassment of the university and controversy in the media, Dr. Touretzky moved the mirror from the Carnegie Mellon server to a private site.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, {{some have}} called for Congress to enact {{additional}} regulations on the industry to expand the disclosure box clearly disclosing rate hikes, use <b>plain</b> <b>language,</b> incorporate balance payoff disclosures, and also to outlaw universal default. At a congress hearing around 1 March 2007, Citibank announced {{it would no longer}} practice this, effective immediately. Opponents of such regulation argue that customers must become more proactive and self-responsible in evaluating and negotiating terms with credit providers. Some of the nation's influential top credit card issuers, which are among the top fifty corporate contributors to political campaigns, successfully opposed it.|$|E

25|$|Stove {{notes that}} in part one he has only {{demonstrated}} how an irrational position might be expressed, {{in such a way}} as it had some appearance of credibility, not that such a position is actually held by the subjects of his study. He now turns to establishing this second point. The philosophers he is criticising not only use language in unusual ways, but do indeed also make <b>plain</b> <b>language</b> assertions of an irrationalist nature. Stove presents examples of what he believes are the clearest statements of irrationalism in their writing. Ultimately he considers providing examples from Karl Popper suffices. He presents the quotes and paraphrases apparently in ascending order of irrationality.|$|E
25|$|U-570s {{transmission}} was in <b>plain</b> <b>language</b> and the British intercepted it. Admiral Percy Noble, {{commander of}} Western Approaches Command, immediately ordered several ships to {{race to the}} scene. By early afternoon, fuel levels had forced the Hudsons to return to Iceland. The Catalina, a very long-range aircraft, was ordered to watch the submarine until Allied ships arrived. If none came before sunset, the aircraft was to warn U-570s crew {{to take to the}} water, then sink her. The first vessel to reach U-570, the anti-submarine trawler HMT Northern Chief, arrived around 10pm, guided to the scene by flares the Catalina dropped. The Catalina returned to Iceland after having circled U-570 for 13 hours.|$|E
25|$|Fern was {{extremely}} successful in her lifetime as a columnist. She {{was said to}} fit her material and subject matter to the audience. Many readers of weekly literary papers were women, and Fern addressed them in a conversational style, often using interjections and exclamation points, while tackling topics that concerned the daily life of ordinary women. Her readers were wives and mothers who worried about their children, current fashions, difficult husbands, and aggravating relatives. Sometimes they felt oppressed, depressed, or stressed. Fern expressed their problems in <b>plain</b> <b>language,</b> addressing women's suffrage, the woman's right to her children in a divorce, unfaithful husbands, social customs that restricted women's freedom, and sometimes just having a bad day.|$|E

50|$|The Lakes <b>Plain</b> <b>languages</b> are a {{small family}} of Papuan languages. They were {{tentatively}} grouped by Stephen Wurm with the Tor languages in his Trans-New Guinea proposal.

50|$|Clouse 1997 {{removed the}} Lakes <b>Plain</b> <b>languages</b> {{of the upper}} Mamberamo River in the {{interior}} of Papua from Trans-New Guinea, where Würm had placed them, and added them to the Geelvink Bay languages.
