40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} the potential Dutch disease threat of remittance in‡ows in a <b>panel</b> <b>of</b> <b>net</b> labor exporters in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. Using the dynamic pooled mean group (PMG) estimator (Pesaran et al., 1999), we {{account for the}} empirically proven complementarity between international migration and inward foreign direct investments (FDI), and hence for the resulting simultaneity between in‡ows of remittances and FDI. We …nd that the standalone appreciative e¤ect of remittances, usually found in the literature, is increasingly attenuated by the productivity-enhancing depreciative e¤ect of simultaneous FDI. A threshold level of net FDI is found beyond which the appreciative real exchange rate e¤ect of remittances turns depreciative. We also present novel evidence on the reverse Dutch disease e¤ect of large remittance out‡ows from the MENA net labor importers and major oil producers, using an augmented version of the PMG estimator which accounts for error cross-section dependence...|$|E

40|$|In recent years, the {{tendency}} in some {{sectors of the}} fishing industry has been to use thicker and stiffer twines in the manufacture <b>of</b> <b>netting</b> material. This increases the mesh’s resistance to opening and, consequently, reduces the selective performance of fishing gears. The main characteristic <b>of</b> <b>netting</b> twine contributing to mesh resistance to opening is flexural rigidity (EI). We present a methodology for quantifying mesh resistance to opening {{through the use of}} a prototype called the resistance to opening and deflection meter (ROD-m). It incorporates four tension load cells and four stepping motors that are driven by four ministep bipolar chopper drives. Small <b>panels</b> <b>of</b> <b>netting</b> (3 3 meshes) can be mounted on ROD-m, which can measure the forces acting on the netting and the position of the knots.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{characterize}} {{the expression of the}} peptides ghrelin and obestatin, as well as other neuroendocrine markers in human normal tissues, in invasive breast cancer and a wide <b>panel</b> <b>of</b> neuroendocrine tumors (<b>NETs).</b> In normal tissues the expression of ghrelin and obestatin was mainly localized to the gastric mucosa, and in lesser extent in the remaining gastrointestinal tract, endocrine pancreas and mammary glands. Double immunofluorescence studies demonstrated that ghrelin and obestatin were co-localized in the same cells displaying the same cytoplasmic distribution. In normal breast tissue, ghrelin, obestatin, adrenomedullin, apelin and vesicular monoamine transporter 2 were specifically demonstrated in the luminal epithelial cells. Consecutive sections indicated that mammary epithelial cells could express several of these peptides. Secretogranin II and III were also detected in breast tissue, but their presence was restricted to the outer layer of myoepithelial cells, whereas chromogranin B immunoreactivity was found in both the epithelial and myoepithelial cells. Ghrelin and obestatin immunoreactivity was seen in invasive breast cancer, where the expression could be correlated to factors associated with prognosis. Furthermore, multivariate analysis indicated that ghrelin expression was a possible independent prognostic factor for prolonged recurrence-free and breast cancer-specific survival. In a <b>panel</b> <b>of</b> <b>NETs</b> and endocrine-related disorders it was revealed that ghrelin and obestatin immunoreactivity was primarily found in tumors originating from the respective normal tissues. The two proteins were detected in only a few cases and only occasional tumor cells were immunoreactive. In conclusion, ghrelin and obestatin are localized in the gastrointestinal tract, endocrine pancreas and mammary glands. This thesis has contributed {{to our understanding of the}} distribution of ghrelin and obestatin in both normal tissue and tumor cells. A potential role of ghrelin as a prognostic factor in invasive breast cancer has been identified and should be further explored...|$|R

The results of the testing were used to validate a finite element analysis and also were scaled up {{to that of a}} full sized, deployed fish cage used for aquaculture purposes. The first model was a “skeleton” cage (without nets) rectangular in shape. This model was moored submerged in front of a viewing window and subjected to various regular waves. The motions were then recorded nonintrusively by means of an optical system acting through a viewport within the sidewall of the wavetank. The results of this testing were then compared to that of the finite element program under development in a parallel effort. The second model was a 1 / 15. 2 scale model of an Ocean Spar fish cage, which UNH first deployed in 1999. This model was towed at various speeds while the forces were measured using a load cell. The model was also towed with different amounts <b>of</b> <b>netting</b> applied, which simulated varying degrees of biofouling. Experiments included both surface and submerged configurations.

40|$|The {{main goal}} of this PhD project {{was to develop a}} method for {{non-linear}} strength analysis <b>of</b> <b>net</b> structures applied in the aquaculture and fishing industries, e. g. net cages and trawls. The work focused on the aquaculture net cage, which was applied in experiments and analyses, and included research to establish knowledge within material properties and failure modes <b>of</b> traditional <b>netting</b> materials for aquaculture. It was chosen to focus on tensile properties and to study elastic and plastic behaviour, fracture, creep behaviour and cod bite damage. The project consisted of three main activities: tensile testing <b>of</b> <b>netting</b> materials, studies and testing of cod bite damage and resistance, and structural analysis <b>of</b> aquaculture <b>net</b> cages. Net cages are built as a system <b>of</b> ropes and <b>netting.</b> They are designed to transfer and carry all major forces through the ropes. Loads from current, waves, weights and handling induce forces in the net cage, which must be dimensioned to withstand this. Analyzing an aquaculture net cage is both complex and time consuming due to non-linear effects, detailed geometry and dynamic loads. The behaviour <b>of</b> the <b>net</b> cage is dominated by very large deformations and displacements, and materials with non-linear properties. There is a need for verified analysis methods and specific guidance on how to reduce the complexity <b>of</b> a <b>net</b> cage analysis. In order to perform a strength analysis <b>of</b> a <b>net</b> cage, it is crucial to know the material properties <b>of</b> the <b>netting</b> material. Traditionally, the material property of major interest for the aquaculture industry has been the tensile breaking strength <b>of</b> <b>netting</b> (mesh) and ropes, and comparatively little focus has been on their detailed stiffness properties and general behaviour prior to fracture. A new test method was established to determine the uniaxial tensile properties <b>of</b> knotless <b>netting</b> materials. It was applied on a variety <b>of</b> <b>netting</b> materials and stress-strain relations were developed. Data on temporary creep properties, recovery of strain post creep and post creep tensile properties of a selection <b>of</b> Raschel knitted <b>netting</b> materials was presented. Post creep tensile testing showed that the length and force at break were not significantly affected by the creep load history. Cod farmers have reported that cod interact with the cage netting through biting and thereby create wear and tear. The nature of the cod bite attack on traditional, multifilament netting materials was described based on studies of cod interaction with traditional knotless netting and resulting fracture damage on netting fibres. Field experiments were performed, subjecting <b>panels</b> <b>of</b> <b>netting</b> to cod bite in commercial cod cages. In addition, a test method was developed to simulate damage on traditional netting from cod bite, and a prototype bite-jig was designed and assembled. It was concluded that netting materials for cod aquaculture must be resistant to cod bite or be repellent or uninteresting for cod. A method for numerical analysis <b>of</b> <b>net</b> cages in constant uniform current was developed and verified for limited solidity, deformations and current velocities. Various new designs for aquaculture net cages were presented and compared to a traditional net cage with regard to stresses in the netting material and deformation <b>of</b> the <b>net</b> cage.

Four different mesh sizes for the gill nets and the inner <b>panel</b> <b>of</b> trammel <b>nets</b> (16, 18, 20 and 22 mm bar length) were used. Selectivity parameters for the five most economically important species, bogue (Boops boops), annular sea bream (Diplodus annularis), striped red mullet (Mullus surmuletus), axillary sea bream (Pagellus acarne) and blotched picarel (Spicara maena), caught by the two gears were estimated. The SELECT method was used to estimate the selectivity parameters {{of a variety of}} models. Catch composition and catch proportion of several species were different in gill and trammel nets. The length frequency distributions of the species caught by the two gears were significantly different. The bi-modal model selectivity curve gave the best fit for gill net and trammel net data, and there was little difference between the modal lengths <b>of</b> these <b>nets.</b> However, a clear difference was found in catching efficiency. The highest catch rates were obtained with the trammel net. Given that many discard species and small fish are caught by gill nets and trammel nets with a mesh size of 16 mm, it is clear that these nets are not appropriate for fisheries. Consequently, the best mesh size for multispecies fisheries is 18 mm. This mesh size will considerably reduce the numbers of small sized individuals and discard species in the catch...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The flow {{characteristics}} through and around a net panel {{have been investigated}} through computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and measurements. A finite volume approach was used for solving the Reynolds averaged Navier–Stokes equations combined with a k–ε turbulence model for describing the flow. For computational efficiency, the net was modeled as a sheet of porous media rather than {{a large number of}} cylinders connected by knots. The model resistance coefficients needed for the porous media equations were found by optimizing the fit between computed lift and drag forces on the net panel and lift and drag measured in tow tank experiments. Lift and drag acting on a flat <b>panel</b> <b>of</b> knotless nylon <b>net</b> (2. 8 mm twine thickness and 29 mm mesh size) stretched on a frame were measured at different speeds and angles of attack, and fluid velocity was recorded in the region behind the net.

Final comparisons between CFD predictions and measurements of lift and drag coefficients and velocity reduction behind the net panel were made for two of the speeds and angles of attack.

40|$|Fisheries {{bycatches}} and discards {{constitute a}} significant problem in many fisheries worldwide. Unlike the pelagic purse-seine, the demersal purse seine usually targets high commercial value demersal species such as sea breams (e. g., Diplodus spp., Pagellus spp., Sparus aurata) and the European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax), while discards consist mainly of pelagic species and juveniles of the above mentioned species. In order to evaluate the efficiency of a selectivity device in reducing bycatch and consequently of discards in a demersal purse seine fishery, experimental deployments were carried out. The bycatch reducing device (BRD) consisted in the use <b>of</b> a <b>panel</b> <b>of</b> diamond-shaped mesh <b>netting</b> <b>of</b> 70 mm stretched mesh in the posterior part of the purse seine. Data from 61 experimental fishing trials allowed the evaluation of discards, with Scomber japonicus, Boops boops, Sardina pilchardus, Diplodus bellottii and Belone belone being the main discarded species. The mean discard ratio per set was 0. 49 (+/- 0. 30 standard deviation). The causes for discarding were also identified, with low commercial value being the most important reason. The results of the trials with BRD, were promising, {{with an average of}} 49 % (+/- 24 %) of the fish escaping per set, especially from those species that are most discarded. Overall, the use of this method for reducing discards can be considered positive for the following reasons: {{there is no need for}} structural modification of the fishing gear, the BRD is easy to deploy, and it is efficient in terms of species, sizes and quantities of fish that manage to escape. It therefore has significant benefits for the demersal purse seine fishery and possibly for other "metiers" as well...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{potential}} procyclical effects of fair value accounting (FVA). If FVA adjustments result in increased accounting profits with {{the recognition of}} transitory gains through a firm's profit and loss (P&L), and if management incorrectly assesses {{the persistence of the}} unrealised gains, these increased profits may be paid out as dividends. This has the potential to increase leverage and risk for these firms, thereby also possibly amplifying economic cycles. A study by Goncharov and Van Triest (2011 : 59) on Russian firms found that FVA adjustments are persistent in future earnings; however, no empirical evidence was found to support an increase in dividends in response to unrealised FVA gains. By contrast, when the setting is limited to South African banks only, De Jager (2015 : 157) found that South African banks have paid the full amount of any unrealised transitory gains as dividends. This study focuses on the effects of FVA adjustments on dividend policy for South African firms, as represented by the firms included in the FTSE/JSE Top 40 Index. This furthers De Jager's (2015) study by extending the investigation of the dividend relevance of FVA adjustments from the major South African banks, to South African large firms in general. The results <b>of</b> a <b>panel</b> regression <b>of</b> the <b>net</b> profit <b>of</b> these firms reveal that unrealised FVA adjustments do have a persistent influence on future earnings, indicating that these adjustments contain both transitory and persistent elements.
