The particular characteristics of this market suggest that <b>prices</b> <b>per</b> share should be very low. Using a sample of 20 stocks from the main Portuguese Stock Index (PSI 20) in Jan/ 1999 –Jun/ 2010, we observe that Portuguese corporations indeed seek extremely low <b>prices</b> <b>per</b> share through stock splits and similar actions. However, we find that low-price stocks are actually less liquid than high-price stocks. Furthermore, low-price stocks trade at lower valuation ratios. Our results do not support any of the existing the-ories on optimal <b>price</b> <b>per</b> share and therefore increase the nominal share price puzzle. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackgroundSustainable diets, {{as defined}} by the Food and Agriculture Organization, need to combine environment, nutrition, and {{affordability}} dimensions. However, it is unknown whether these dimensions are compatible, and no guidance is available in the official recommendations. ObjectiveTo identify foods with compatible sustainability dimensions. MethodsFor 363 of the most commonly consumed foods in the Second French Individual and National Study on Food Consumption, environmental impact indicators (ie, greenhouse gas [GHG] emissions, acidification, and eutrophication), and prices were collected. The nutritional quality of the foods was assessed by calculating the score for the nutritional adequacy of individual foods (SAIN) to score for disqualifying nutrients (LIM) ratio. A sustainability score based on the median GHG emissions, price, and SAIN:LIM was calculated for each food; the foods with the best values for all three variables received the highest score. ResultsThe environmental indicators were strongly and positively correlated. Meat, fish, and eggs and dairy products had the strongest influence on the environment; starchy foods, legumes, and fruits and vegetables had the least influence. GHG emissions were inversely correlated with SAIN:LIM (r=– 0. 37) and positively correlated with <b>price</b> <b>per</b> kilogram (r= 0. 59); the correlation with <b>price</b> <b>per</b> kilocalorie was null. This showed that foods with a heavy environmental impact tend to have lower nutritional quality and a higher <b>price</b> <b>per</b> kilogram but not a lower <b>price</b> <b>per</b> kilocalorie. Using <b>price</b> <b>per</b> kilogram, 94 foods had a maximum sustainability score, including most plant-based foods and excluding all foods with animal ingredients except milk, yogurt, and soups. Using <b>price</b> <b>per</b> kilocalorie restricted the list to 42 foods, including 52 % of all starchy foods and legumes but only 11 % of fruits and vegetables (mainly 100 % fruit juices). ConclusionsOverall, the sustainability dimensions seemed to be compatible when considering <b>price</b> <b>per</b> kilogram of food. However, this conclusion is too simplistic when considering <b>price</b> <b>per</b> kilocalorie, which highlights the need to integrate the data at the diet level...|$|R
40|$|The authors examine {{variability}} in the price and purity of cocaine and heroin using data gathered over a 14 -year period by the System to Retrieve Information from Drug Evidence (STRIDE) of the United States Drug Enforcement Administration. The amount of variability is very great, larger than the variability for any of 15 legal goods for which comparable estimates are available. This {{raises the question of}} how such markets cope with the problem of purchasing “lemons”—undesirable or unreliable goods whose quality can not be determined ex ante. Repeated purchases may be {{an essential part of the}} answer. Much, though not the majority, of {{variability in}} <b>prices</b> <b>per</b> pure gram comes from variation in purity. Conversely, the vast majority of variation in purity does not translate (with positive correlation) into variation in <b>price</b> <b>per</b> raw gram; instead, it translates (with negative correlation) into variation in <b>price</b> <b>per</b> pure gram. Thus, variability in <b>price</b> <b>per</b> pure gram is the “sum ” of variability in <b>price</b> <b>per</b> raw gram plus variability in purity.

5000|$|Average prices represent, quite simply, {{total sales}} revenue divided by total units sold. Many products, however, {{are sold in}} {{multiple}} variants, such as bottle sizes. In these cases, managers face a challenge: they must determine 'comparable' units. Average prices can be calculated by weighting different unit selling prices by the percentage of unit sales (mix) for each product variant. If we use a standard, rather than an actual mix of sizes and product varieties, the result is <b>price</b> <b>per</b> statistical unit. Statistical units are also known as equivalent units. Average <b>price</b> <b>per</b> unit and <b>prices</b> <b>per</b> statistical unit are needed by marketers who sell the same product in different packages, sizes, forms, or configurations {{at a variety of}} different prices. As in analyses of different channels, these product and price variations must be reflected accurately in overall average prices. If they are not, marketers may lose sight of what is happening to prices and why. If the price of each product variant remained unchanged, for example, but there was a shift in the mix of volume sold, then the average <b>price</b> <b>per</b> unit would change, but the <b>price</b> <b>per</b> statistical unit would not. Both of these metrics have value in identifying market movements. In a survey of nearly 200 senior marketing managers, 51 percent responded that they found the [...] "average <b>price</b> <b>per</b> unit" [...] metric very useful in managing and monitoring their businesses, while only 16% found [...] "price per statistical unit" [...] very useful.|$|R
