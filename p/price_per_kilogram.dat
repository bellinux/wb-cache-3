40|$|Introduction: Land use in {{the overall}} concept {{is said to be}} the type of using land in the current {{situation}} which contains all users in different sectors of agriculture, natural resources and the industry. Protecting land use is as follows: “Prevent the change of application of certain lands by their owners, if their change has negative natural, economic, political, cultural, or scientific effects”. Change of application of land is certainly the most important factor that will affect the protection of natural ecosystems. Thus, it is imperative to consider the importance of land use change from the perspective of environmental, economic, social and finally, its important aspects such as food security and the lack of planning for its realization and the changes that occur in these sectors. Factors affecting the development of land use change should be considered to finally be able to apply appropriate policies and strategic principles to reduce its negative effects. Materials and Methods:Thestudy’s data and information were obtained by simple random sampling and through interviews and 60 questionnaires that were completed by farmers and rice farmers of Tonekabon city that all or part of their land use had been changed and the datahadbeen collected in 2012. For investigating the factors affecting agricultural land use changes, the Tobit model of Heckman’s two-step was used. In this paper, the relationship between the factors that influence decision to change land use and actions to land use change were investigated. The variables including family size, literacy, experience, number of garden plots, citrus cultivation, kiwi cultivation, the <b>price</b> <b>per</b> square meter of garden land, the <b>price</b> <b>per</b> <b>kilograms</b> of horticultural crops (citrus), the <b>price</b> <b>per</b> <b>kilograms</b> of horticultural products (kiwi), number of pieces of agricultural land, cultivated level, the <b>price</b> <b>per</b> <b>kilograms</b> of crop, the <b>price</b> <b>per</b> square meter of agricultural land, satisfaction of supporting institutions and garden and agricultural insurance were used in this study. Results and Discussion: The estimated Probit model’s marginal effects showed that the variables of literacy, experience, citrus and kiwi cultivation, number of garden plots, the <b>price</b> <b>per</b> <b>kilograms</b> of horticultural products (kiwi), cultivated level, and the <b>price</b> <b>per</b> square meter of agricultural land have been positive signs that indicate a positive impact of these variables on the decision to change the use of land. The estimated linear regression model showed that the variables of number of garden plots, citrus cultivation, kiwi cultivation, the <b>price</b> <b>per</b> <b>kilograms</b> of horticultural crops (citrus), number of pieces of agricultural land, cultivated level and garden and agricultural insurance have been positive signs that indicate the positive impact of these variables on the action to change the use of land. Due to significant coefficients of the quantitative variables that influence the rate of change in land use, cultivation of citrus fruits is dedicated to most positive effects. As well, satisfaction of supporting institutions also has the most negative role as a dummy variable. Conclusion: The issues of land use change, prevention of land destruction and preservation of land, are of the main challenges in recent years. In this paper, we investigated the factors affecting change in land use by using a survey of 60 farmers in Tonekabon and the two-step Tobit model (Heckman) in 2012. The result of the Probit model showed that literacy levels, experience, number ofhorticulturalland pieces, area of citrusandkiwi,the price ofhorticultural products(kiwi), crop area and price ofland hada positive effect andhouseholdsize, price ofhorticultural land, price ofhorticultural products(citrus), number ofagricultural land price, and averageprice ofcrop, the satisfaction level of support in situations, horticultural and agricultural insurance had negative effects on thedecisionofchanging agriculturallandtohorticultural. Also, the results of the second stage Tobit regressi on model showed that the number of horticulturalland price, area of kiwi and citrus, price of horticultural products (citrus), pieces of agricultural land and crop area, price of land and horticulturalcropinsurance hada positive effect on householdsize,literacy levels, experience, price ofhorticultural products(kiwi), and price ofcrops and satisfaction level ofsupportinstitutions had a negative effect on thelevel ofchanging in land use.

40|$|This paper {{adds to the}} {{knowledge}} of the relationship between international trade and product variety by analyzing the relationship between variety in export supply and exports at the firm-level. Using highly detailed firm-level export data in 2003, the paper finds clear empirical evidence for gains from variety in export supply at the level of individual firms. By applying a decomposition methodology related to Hummels & Klenow (2004), it is shown that these gains can be attributed to a larger amount of markets served and larger export sales per market, roughly on a 50 - 50 basis. The paper also examines how the export variety of firms varies with distance and GDP across markets. The variety of a firm’s export flows to a market increases with the market’s GDP but decreases with distance. The paper estimates that 15 % of the larger export sales to a market with larger GDP can be attributed to a larger number of products exported to the market. Moreover, the paper finds empirical support for quality differentiation on the behalf of individual firms among markets with different GDP. About one third of the effect of GDP on the total value of the export flows to a market can be ascribed to higher average <b>prices</b> <b>per</b> <b>kilogram</b> of the export products. Products shipped over longer distances tend also to have higher average <b>prices</b> <b>per</b> <b>kilogram.</b> exports; product variety; international trade; multi-product firms...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackgroundSustainable diets, {{as defined}} by the Food and Agriculture Organization, need to combine environment, nutrition, and {{affordability}} dimensions. However, it is unknown whether these dimensions are compatible, and no guidance is available in the official recommendations. ObjectiveTo identify foods with compatible sustainability dimensions. MethodsFor 363 of the most commonly consumed foods in the Second French Individual and National Study on Food Consumption, environmental impact indicators (ie, greenhouse gas [GHG] emissions, acidification, and eutrophication), and prices were collected. The nutritional quality of the foods was assessed by calculating the score for the nutritional adequacy of individual foods (SAIN) to score for disqualifying nutrients (LIM) ratio. A sustainability score based on the median GHG emissions, price, and SAIN:LIM was calculated for each food; the foods with the best values for all three variables received the highest score. ResultsThe environmental indicators were strongly and positively correlated. Meat, fish, and eggs and dairy products had the strongest influence on the environment; starchy foods, legumes, and fruits and vegetables had the least influence. GHG emissions were inversely correlated with SAIN:LIM (r=– 0. 37) and positively correlated with <b>price</b> <b>per</b> <b>kilogram</b> (r= 0. 59); the correlation with price per kilocalorie was null. This showed that foods with a heavy environmental impact tend to have lower nutritional quality and a higher <b>price</b> <b>per</b> <b>kilogram</b> but not a lower price per kilocalorie. Using <b>price</b> <b>per</b> <b>kilogram,</b> 94 foods had a maximum sustainability score, including most plant-based foods and excluding all foods with animal ingredients except milk, yogurt, and soups. Using price per kilocalorie restricted the list to 42 foods, including 52 % of all starchy foods and legumes but only 11 % of fruits and vegetables (mainly 100 % fruit juices). ConclusionsOverall, the sustainability dimensions seemed to be compatible when considering <b>price</b> <b>per</b> <b>kilogram</b> of food. However, this conclusion is too simplistic when considering price per kilocalorie, which highlights the need to integrate the data at the diet level...|$|E

Fifty pig butchers were interviewed using questionnaires in two districts, Kakamega (peri-urban) and Busia (rural). Results showed that pig butchers were central to the coordination of activities required to connect pig farmers to pork consumers in their communities. Several differences between rural and peri-urban enterprises included use of agents to find pigs, average market weight of pigs, pig <b>prices</b> <b>per</b> <b>kilogram,</b> transport and marketing.

40|$|This {{study has}} {{attempted}} to identify determinants of cattle <b>price</b> <b>per</b> <b>kilogram</b> live weight using a log-linear regression model. The estimated model explains about 48 % {{of the variation in}} market prices of cattle. <b>Price</b> <b>per</b> <b>kilogram</b> live weight of cattle increases with animal characteristics such as age, live weight and grade. Type of sellers, buyers' purposes, festivals, time of transaction and a time trend are also important variables in affecting cattle prices. Farmers tend to sell their animals at price discounts as compared to trader sellers. Cattle sellers suffer from price discounts in selling to buyers with business purposes in comparison to selling to ultimate consumers. Sellers tend to benefit from animal sales during festivals, as they tend to receive price premium compared to selling during non-festival periods. Cattle <b>price</b> <b>per</b> <b>kilogram</b> live weight increases with the time of transaction suggesting that sellers tend to obtain higher prices by selling at later hours of a market day. The policy implications of these empirical results are that efforts to benefit cattle producers and/or sellers need to pay attention to animal characteristics, sellers' type, buyers' purposes and festivals in preparing animals for market and/or during actual transactions. It is vitally essential to train cattle keepers on the above issues. Provision of reliable livestock market (price) information to market participants, and investment in different livestock marketing facilities (like weighing scale) and services need to be given due attention in order to avoid unrewarding cattle-pricing practices.

Eight different yogurt categories were created within the four main supermarket chains in Catalonia (Mercadona, Dia, Carrefour and Lidl) using the following attributes: brand, added ingredients, fat content and the price which was differentiated by two monthly dynamic price indicators. Results showed that the price was the major driving factor.

One hundred and fifty respondents comprising smoked and frozen fish sellers and consumers were randomly selected and interviewed. Twenty-two smoked fish species were identified, out of which 12 were freshwater species while 10 were marine species. Eighty-six per cent (86 %) of consumers preferred smoked fish while 14 % preferred frozen fish. Herrings, horse mackerel and salmon were the most preferred fish. Consumer preferences were based on taste, affordability, availability and wholesomeness in soup and stew.

Stabex (Stabilization of Export Earnings—see Glossary), a system of the EC, provides aid to the Comoros and other developing countries to mitigate the effects of fluctuations in the prices of export commodities.|$|R
5|$|Found {{with almost}} all other rare-earth metals but never by itself, {{lutetium}} {{is very difficult}} to separate from other elements. The principal commercially viable ore of lutetium is the rare earth phosphate mineral monazite: (Ce, La, etc.)PO4 which contains 0.0001% of the element. The abundance of lutetium in the Earth crust is only about 0.5mg/kg. The main mining areas are China, United States, Brazil, India, Sri Lanka and Australia. The world production of lutetium (in the form of oxide) is about 10 tonnes per year. Pure lutetium metal {{is very difficult to}} prepare. It is one of the rarest and most expensive of the rare earth metals with the <b>price</b> about US$10,000 <b>per</b> <b>kilogram,</b> or about one-fourth that of gold.|$|R
