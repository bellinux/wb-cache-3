40|$|As LNG {{carriers}} become {{larger and}} new operating conditions are being designed, {{it is essential}} to develop a new procedure for the strength evaluation of a membrane-type LNG <b>containment</b> <b>system</b> under sloshing loads. The conventional comparative method based on existing service experiences and previous damage cases is currently used in most cases, but this method is only valid for designing new LNG carriers with similar size and type of existing ones. In this study, an analytical solution of acoustic-solid interaction has been derived and a simple 2 D coupled acoustic-solid model has been simulated to investigate hydro-elastic effects for the verification purpose. After validation of FE modeling, a coupled model considering the fluid-structure interaction between LNG and <b>containment</b> <b>system</b> has been developed for structural analysis of LNG Mark III <b>containment</b> <b>system.</b> For LNG Mark III <b>containment</b> <b>system,</b> nonlinear dynamic FE analysis under sloshing impact pressure has been conducted using the fluid-structure coupling model. In FE simulations, the hydro-elastic effect in structural response has been studied through considering LNG as an acoustic medium, foam as a visco-elastic material, plywood as an orthotropic material, and mastic as an isotropic material. Parametric study has also been done to investigate the effects of material properties and loading patterns on hydro-elastic response in the coupled fluid-structure model. Based on FE results and experimental data, the strength of LNG Mark III <b>containment</b> <b>system</b> has been evaluated in terms of acceptance criteria. Finally, the new procedure has been developed for the strength evaluation of membrane-type LNG <b>containment</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R

Containing the fast propagating worm is a difficult task and hence is a ongoing area of interest for many researchers. Many <b>containment</b> <b>systems</b> have been proposed including anomaly detection, address blacklisting and signature-based content filtering. Meanwhile recently developed worm models enable us to develop a testbed to accurately and quickly evaluate the efficiency of these defense mechanisms. In this thesis, we present a testbed which utilizes software agents to achieve large scale simulation and maintain functionality of each individual host. In addition, our proposed <b>containment</b> <b>systems</b> are evaluated using this testbed in terms of security and performance tradeoff. For the purpose of evaluation, the testbed is firstly exposed to analyze normal network and worm behavior pursued by multiple containment tactics. Our results indicate that a dynamic <b>containment</b> <b>system</b> achieves better performance and security. We believe our testbed is an effective tool to explore and evaluate varying worm <b>containment</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R

40|$|Studies of worm {{outbreaks}} {{have found}} that the speed of worm propagation makes manual intervention ineffective. Consequently, many automated containment mechanisms have been proposed to contain worm outbreaks before they grow out of control. These <b>containment</b> <b>systems,</b> however, only provide protection for hosts within networks that implement them. Such a containment strategy requires complete participation to protect all vulnerable hosts. Moreover, collaborative <b>containment</b> <b>systems,</b> where participants share alert data, face a tension between resilience to false alerts and quick reaction to worm outbreaks. This paper suggests an alternative approach where an autonomous system in an internetwork, such as the Internet, protects not only its local hosts, but also all hosts that route traffic through it, which we call internetwork-centric containment. Additionally, we propose a novel reputation-based alerting mechanism to provide fast dissemination of infection information while maintaining the fairness of the system. Through simulation studies, we show that the combination of internetwork-centric containment and reputation-based alerting is able to contain an extremely virulent worm with relatively little participation in the <b>containment</b> <b>system.</b> In comparison to other collaborative <b>containment</b> <b>systems,</b> ours provides better protection against worm outbreaks and resilience to false alerts...|$|R
