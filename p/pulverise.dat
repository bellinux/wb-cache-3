25|$|The {{characters}} {{discover that}} the true force behind the war has been the supercomputer Hactar. Previously built to serve a war-faring species, Hactar was tasked to build a supernova-bomb that would link the cores of every sun in the Universe together at the press of a button and cause {{the end of the}} Universe. Hactar purposely created a dud version of the weapon instead, causing his creators to <b>pulverise</b> him into dust, which thus became the dust cloud around Krikkit. However, Hactar was still able to function, though at a much weaker level. Trillian and Arthur speak to Hactar in a virtual space that he creates for them to explain himself. Hactar reveals that he spent eons creating the spaceship that crashed on Krikkit to inspire their xenophobia and incite them to go to war, also influencing their thoughts. However, when the Slo-Time envelope was activated, his control on the population waned. As he struggles to remain functional, Hactar apologises to Trillian and Arthur for his actions before they leave for their ship.|$|E

2500|$|However, one vessel type used in food {{preparation}} was closely {{linked with the}} spread of Roman culture and Roman cuisine: the [...] This was a robust shallow bowl with a thick, out-curved rim that {{made it easy to}} handle, often a pouring lip, and an internal surface deliberately roughened with a coating of grit or coarse sand during manufacture. It was used with a pestle to purée or <b>pulverise</b> ingredients in order to prepare elaborate and carefully seasoned Roman dishes; the Roman culinary tradition made extensive use of herbs and spices. The mortarium was the Roman equivalent of the food-processor, and is a real indicator of 'romanisation'; In Britain, the first mortaria were being imported from Gaulish sources more than a generation before Britain became a Roman province in AD 43, indicating the growing influence of Roman culture in late Iron Age southern Britain, and perhaps the actual presence of immigrants from Gaul. Later, locally-made mortaria produced at specialised potteries in different areas of the province were available throughout Britain, in addition to imported products: Paul Tyers discusses mortaria from no fewer than 16 different manufacturing sources, Romano-British and Continental, that have been found in Britain. Like so many other specialised Roman ceramic products, many mortaria also bore workshop or makers' stamps on their rims, and noting their chronology and distribution can help archaeologists understand trading patterns and the Roman economy.|$|E

60|$|Twice in my life, {{and twice}} lately, I {{have seen a}} piece of English pedantry bring us {{within an inch of}} an {{enormous}} English peril. The first was when all the Victorian historians and philosophers had told us that our German cousin was a cousin german and even germane; something naturally near and sympathetic. That also was an identification; that also was an assimilation; that also was a union of hearts. For the second time in a few short years, English politicians and journalists have discovered the dreadful revenge of reality. To pretend that something is what it is not is business that can easily be fashionable and sometimes popular. But the thing we have agreed to regard as what it is not will always abruptly punish and <b>pulverise</b> us, merely by being what it is. For years we were told that the Germans were a sort of Englishman because they were Teutons; but it was all the worse for us when we found out what Teutons really were. For years we were told that Jews were a sort of Englishman because they were British subjects. It is all the worse for us now we have to regard them, not subjectively as subjects, but objectively as objects; as objects of a fierce hatred among the Moslems and the Greeks. We are in the absurd position of introducing to these people a new friend whom they instantly recognise as an old enemy. It is an absurd position because it is a false position; but it is merely the penalty of falsehood.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Field, of Lambeth, has {{supplied}} me abundantly {{with beautiful}} illustrations of the candle and its materials. I shall therefore now refer to them. And, first, {{there is the}} suet--the fat of the ox--Russian tallow, I believe, employed {{in the manufacture of}} these dips, which Gay Lussac, or some one who entrusted him with his knowledge, converted into that beautiful substance, stearin, which you see lying beside it. A candle, you know, is not now a greasy thing like an ordinary tallow candle, but a clean thing, and you may almost scrape off and <b>pulverise</b> the drops which fall from it without soiling anything. This is the process he adopted[2]:--The fat or tallow is first boiled with quick-lime, and made into a soap, and then the soap is decomposed by sulphuric acid, which takes away the lime, and leaves the fat re-arranged as stearic acid, whilst a quantity of glycerin is produced at the same time. Glycerin--absolutely a sugar, or a substance similar to sugar--comes out of the tallow in this chemical change. The oil is then pressed out of it; and you see here this series of pressed cakes, shewing how beautifully the impurities are carried out by the oily part as the pressure goes on increasing, and at last you have left that substance which is melted, and cast into candles as here represented. The candle I have in my hand is a stearin candle, made of stearin from tallow in the way I have told you. Then here is a sperm candle, which comes from the purified oil of the spermaceti whale. Here also are yellow bees-wax and refined bees-wax, from which candles are made. Here, too, is that curious substance called paraffin, and some paraffin candles made of paraffin obtained from the bogs of Ireland. I have here also a substance brought from Japan, since we have forced an entrance into that out-of-the-way place--a sort of wax which a kind friend has sent me, and which forms a new material for the manufacture of candles.|$|E
60|$|Anybody could <b>pulverise</b> the Irish {{church in}} argument, {{and to show}} that it ought to be disestablished and disendowed was the easiest thing in the world. But as often happens, what it was easy to show ought to be done, was {{extremely}} hard to do. Here Mr. Gladstone was in his great element. It was true to say that “never were the wheels of legislative machinery set in motion under conditions of peace and order and constitutional regularity to deal with a question greater or more profound,” than when the historic protestant church in Ireland was severed from its sister church in England and from its ancient connection with the state. The case had been fully examined in parliament. After examination and decision there, it was discussed and decided in the constituencies of the United Kingdom. Even then many held that the operation was too gigantic in its bearings, too complex in the mass of its detail, to be practicable. Never was our political system more severely tested, and never did it achieve a completer victory. Every great organ of the national constitution came into active play. The sovereign performed a high and useful duty. The Lords fought hard, but yielded before the strain reached a point of danger. The prelates in the midst of anger and perturbation were forced round to statesmanship. The Commons stood firm and unbroken. The law, when at length it became law, effected the national purpose with extraordinary thoroughness and precision. And the enterprise was inspired, guided, propelled, perfected, and made possible from its inception to its close by the resource, temper, and incomparable legislative skill of Mr. Gladstone. That the removal of the giant abuse of protestant establishment in Ireland made a deeper mark on national well-being than other of his legislative exploits, we can hardly think, but—quite apart from the policy of the act, as to which there can now be scarcely two opinions—as a monument of difficulties surmounted, prejudices and violent or sullen heats overcome, rights and interests adjusted, I know not where in the records of our legislation to find its master.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the current}} work was at {{development}} and validation of modeling tools for simulation of <b>pulverised</b> wood flames in furnaces and study how different factors influence on such flames. The numerical model involves different sub-models for the physo-chemical processes, such as, two-phase flow motion, drying, devolatilization and shrinkage of particles, the formation and oxidation of volatile, tar and char, turbulence-chemistry interaction, turbulence-radiation interaction, etc. Because {{of the complexity of}} such flames, the work here is divided into different stages. In the first stage, modeling the motion of <b>pulverised</b> wood particles in turbulent flows is carried out. This includes addressing the following open questions: how do highly anisotropic and typically non-spherical particles behave in turbulent flows; how are the particle projected area and orientations changed during particle tracing; how is the interaction between the particles and the flow field (turbulence). In the second stage, the conversion of <b>pulverised</b> wood particles in combustion conditions is extensively studied. Modelling of different processes during the conversion is investigated. More attention is paid upon the devolatilization process since it is the most dominating one during the thermal degradation processes. The devolatilization kinetics for <b>pulverised</b> wood particles in combustion conditions is studied, including the evaluation and determination of devolatilization mechanism and devolatilization rate constants. In the third stage, the effect of moisture and volatile releases during thermal degradation on the motion of <b>pulverised</b> wood particles is studied. Since the fiber structure in the wood particles is anisotropic; the release of gasses is not isotropic along the particle surface. The particle is then subjected to a force that we may refer to ?rocket? force, since the physical process resembles that of rocket propulsion. This new phenomenon is modeled and validated during this stage. In addition, the effect of rocket force on the particle velocity, particle distribution and the combustion processes is investigated. In the fourth stage, the sub-models studied in the previous stages are coupled together with supplementary sub-models, such as oxidation of volatile, tar and char, turbulence-chemistry interaction and turbulence-radiation interaction, to simulate the <b>pulverised</b> wood flames in a vertical furnace. Different flame sub-models together with required governing equations are all integrated to a CFD code, developed previously at LTH. The solid-gas coupling is done here using the Eulerian/Lagrangian coupling approach. From this work the basic structures of <b>pulverised</b> wood flames are identified. It was shown that <b>pulverised</b> wood flames have strong similarity and difference as compared to gaseous flames. Similar to the gaseous premixed flames, the <b>pulverised</b> wood flames consist of distinct zones ? preheat zone, drying-devolatilization zone, oxidation zone and post-flame zone. The mechanism of heat transfer to the preheat zone of <b>pulverised</b> wood flames is however different from the gas flames. The structure of <b>pulverised</b> wood flames is not only a property of the fuel/air mixture itself, but also it depends on the combustor configuration. It was shown that <b>pulverised</b> wood flames are rather sensitive to the physical parameters such as particle size and shape, heat capacity of particles, fuel feeding rate and shrinkage process...|$|R
