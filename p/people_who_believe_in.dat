5|$|The Moon {{has long}} been {{associated}} with insanity and irrationality; the words lunacy and lunatic (popular shortening loony) are derived from the Latin name for the Moon, Luna. Philosophers Aristotle and Pliny the Elder argued that the full moon induced insanity in susceptible individuals, believing that the brain, which is mostly water, must {{be affected by the}} Moon and its power over the tides, but the Moon's gravity is too slight to affect any single person. Even today, <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> a lunar effect claim that admissions to psychiatric hospitals, traffic accidents, homicides or suicides increase during a full moon, but dozens of studies invalidate these claims.|$|E

Most <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> Taoism also ascribe to Buddhism at the same time, as the differences and boundaries between the two religions are not always clear. Many residents of the area also worship the folk sea goddess Mazu, who is variously syncretized as a Taoist immortal or avatar of the bodhisattva Guanyin. Her temple on Cijin Island is the oldest in the city, with its original bamboo-and-thatch structure first opened in 1673.

500|$|Although anti-Catholicism {{had been}} a {{consistent}} platform of the Klan, before leaving the organization, Evans renounced his anti-Catholicism and pronounced a [...] "new era of religious tolerance". In 1939, he said that [...] "in no other time in history has there been more need for all <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> the same Father and same Son to stand together." [...] That year, Evans also publicly {{expressed an interest in}} learning aspects of Judaism to better understand the Old Testament. Chester L. Quarles, a professor of criminal justice at the University of Mississippi, argues that Evans repudiated anti-Catholicism owing to his desire to fight unions and communism and his fear of having too many enemies at one time.|$|E
500|$|Many {{philosophers}} consider {{experience to}} be the essence of consciousness, and believe that experience can only fully be known from the inside, subjectively. [...] But if consciousness is subjective and not visible from the outside, why do {{the vast majority of}} people believe that other people are conscious, but rocks and trees are not? [...] This is called the problem of other minds. [...] It is particularly acute for <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> the possibility of philosophical zombies, that is, people who think it is possible in principle to have an entity that is physically indistinguishable from a human being and behaves like a human being in every way but nevertheless lacks consciousness.

I am not a dreamer, and I am not saying that this will initiate any kind of definitive answer or cure to cancer. I believe in miracles. I have to." [...] The Cancer Society was skeptical of his dedication, but agreed to support Fox once he had acquired sponsors and requested he get a medical certificate from a heart specialist stating that he was fit to attempt the run. Fox was diagnosed with left ventricular hypertrophy– an enlarged heart– a condition commonly associated with athletes. Doctors warned Fox of the potential risks he faced, though they did not consider his condition a significant concern. They endorsed his participation when he promised that he would stop immediately if he began to experience any heart problems.|$|E

[...] The author identifies the press as {{a key figure in}} the tenor of the 2016 campaign, [...] "The public hates us reporters in the best of times. But the summer of Trump could easily turn into an Alamo moment for the press." [...] Taibbi comes to the view that members of the press should spend more time hearing out the viewpoints of the American populace, writing, [...] "Just like the politicians our job was to listen, and we talked instead. Now America will do its own talking for a while. The world may never forgive us for not seeing this coming." ...|$|E

500|$|Series writer David Fury cited graphic novel author Alan Moore's Promethea—a story {{combining}} science fiction, mysticism, and {{a female}} superhero—as inspiration for the storyline, and another nod to Frankenstein as its original title was Frankenstein; or, the Modern Prometheus. In addition, series creator, Joss Whedon has long been interested in science fiction. He wrote the script for the film Alien Resurrection (1997), where an extraterrestrial creature is bred from a human and an alien in a laboratory, {{and went on to}} develop the space western television series Firefly. Buffy uses both science and magic as narrative devices. According to author Andrew Aberdein, the series employs science in three ways: to demonstrate what contemporary science explains, to posit what science may be able to accomplish, and the dominance of supernatural forces over science. According to Aberdein, Adam, a [...] "kinematically redundant, bio-mechanical demonoid", is the series' deepest exploration of scientific potential. Series writer Doug Petrie states that Adam is the embodiment of the invasion of science in a world where magic is the most powerful force. The series relied on its own form of magic to explain Buffy's superpowers and other supernatural occurrences up to the fourth season. Adam is [...] "what happens when <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> science use demons for military gain", according to Petrie. The result is that science [...] "gets its ass kicked" [...] by magic.|$|E

5000|$|As Martinich {{has pointed}} out, in Hobbes's time the term [...] "atheist" [...] was often applied to <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>believed</b> <b>in</b> God {{but not in}} divine providence, or to <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>believed</b> <b>in</b> God but also {{maintained}} other beliefs that were inconsistent with such belief. He says that this [...] "sort of discrepancy has led to many errors in determining who was an atheist in the early modern period". [...] In this extended early modern sense of atheism, Hobbes did take positions that strongly disagreed with church teachings of his time. For example, he argued repeatedly {{that there are no}} incorporeal substances, and that all things, including human thoughts, and even God, heaven, and hell are corporeal, matter in motion. He argued that [...] "though Scripture acknowledge spirits, yet doth it nowhere say, that they are incorporeal, meaning thereby without dimensions and quantity". (In this view, Hobbes claimed to be following Tertullian, whose views were not condemned in the First Council of Nicaea.) He also, like Locke, stated that true revelation can never disagree with human reason and experience, although he also argued that people should accept revelation and its interpretations also for the reason that they should accept the commands of their sovereign, in order to avoid war.|$|R

2500|$|Harold Lindsell {{points out}} that it is a [...] "gross distortion" [...] to state that <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> biblical inerrancy suppose every {{statement}} made in the Bible is true (opposed to accurate). He indicates there are expressly false statements in the Bible which are reported accurately (for example, Satan is a liar whose lies are accurately reported as to what he actually said). Proponents of biblical inerrancy generally do not teach that the Bible was dictated directly by God, but that God used the [...] "distinctive personalities and literary styles of the writers" [...] of scripture and that God's inspiration guided them to flawlessly project his message through their own language and personality.|$|E
2500|$|By mid-1958 Proserpine parish's {{participation}} in the Anglican Building Crusade had raised over £3000 and their own fundraising campaign was supported and encouraged by Bishop Shevill, who stated [...] "...I should like to congratulate the wardens and council upon their adoption of a design which is so revolutionary and so progressive, for it will provide the parish with a contemporary building of great beauty and one which will make religion relevant to the 20th Century <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> progress...". The original timber church was relocated {{to the rear of}} the property and Cairns contractors Les Tinsley and Co. began construction of the new St Paul's in June 1958.

[...] The apparitions occurred on the fourth day of every month for ten years, and many were filmed. Volpini's father supported her, but her mother, while believing in the apparitions, feared for the girl's life. The local priest, Gianni Baget Bozzo, believed the child and formed a lifelong friendship with her. He often compared the apparitions to those of Our Lady of Lourdes. On his death May 8, 2009, he left one-sixth of his fortune to Volpini. <b>People</b> <b>who</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> Volpini's experiences formed a devotional organization called Nova Cana—the name invented by Volpini herself—to commemorate the events.|$|E

Seneca the Younger seems to be less consistent, arguing both sides, indicating that death brings about utter annihilation while also talking about some survival of the spirit after it escapes from the prison of the body. Tacitus at the end of Agricola takes the opposite opinion to Pliny, and claims that the wise believe the spirit does not die with the body, although he may be specifically referring to the pious [...] – which harkens to the mythological idea of Elysium.
