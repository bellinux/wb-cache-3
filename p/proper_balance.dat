In the 1960s W.D. Hamilton and others developed game theory approaches to explain altruism from an evolutionary perspective through kin selection. The possible origin of higher organisms through endosymbiosis, and contrasting approaches to molecular evolution in the gene-centered view (which held selection as the predominant cause of evolution) and the neutral theory (which made genetic drift a key factor) spawned perennial debates over the <b>proper</b> <b>balance</b> of adaptationism and contingency in evolutionary theory.|$|E

5|$|The {{foundation}} of Celestial Master {{belief is that}} there is an energy source known as qi, that is born from the Dao and is the source of life all things. The human body contains spirits that need to be nourished by the <b>proper</b> <b>balance</b> of qi. There are three types of qi: yin qi, yang qi and blended qi, which is mixed yin/yang qi. The goal of a Daoist is to achieve transcendence to a higher plane. In order to do this, they must preserve and harmonize their internal spirits. Only through meditation that guides qi correctly throughout the body, can the spirits be harmonized correctly. While it is known that the Celestial Masters meditated in order to obtain qi, there is no surviving evidence that describes their meditation practices.|$|E

40|$|Abstract) Balancing an air {{distribution}} system consists primarily of measuring airflow and adjusting volume control devices to get specified airflow. Flow calculation methods are not accurate enough to ensure <b>proper</b> <b>balancing</b> by duct design alone. To assure <b>proper</b> <b>balancing,</b> dampers within an {{air distribution}} system must be adjusted until design flows are met throughout the system to within + 10 %. By properly balancing an {{air distribution system}}, operating costs in the system will be reduced, comfort for the occupants in the building will be increased, {{and the life of}} the HVAC equipment will be improved. Existing balancing techniques are iterative methods that require several measurements and damper adjustments. The flows and pressures are first measured, and then the dampers are adjusted to match design airflow. The flows are measured again and the measuring and adjusting process is repeated on a trial-and-error process until design flow is achieved. This iterative process is time consuming and expensive. The proposed new balancing technique is to use a computer program that, based on a few measurements, determines damper adjustments that will achieve design airflo...|$|R
