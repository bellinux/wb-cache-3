According to Sarma (2008): [...] "One finds in the Rigveda intelligent speculations about {{the genesis of the}} universe from nonexistence, the configuration of the universe, the spherical self-supporting earth, and the year of 360 days divided into 12 equal parts of 30 days each with a periodical intercalary month.". The first 12 chapters of the Siddhanta Shiromani, written by Bhāskara in the 12th century, cover topics such as: mean longitudes of the planets; true longitudes of the planets; the three problems of diurnal rotation; syzygies; lunar eclipses; solar eclipses; latitudes of the planets; risings and settings; the moon's crescent; conjunctions of the planets with each other; conjunctions of the planets with the fixed stars; and the patas of the sun and moon.

Along with analysis <b>part</b> <b>cover</b> plate shape was modified due to its continuous use amp prevailing conditions at the workshop. The cover plate consist of insulating materials compacted to retain the heat in the bath tub. The thermal convection of air is less than thermal resistance of insulating materials used thus heat loss is negligible. Thermal convection air 0. 0579 w m k Thermal Resistance Insulator 7. 046 w m k. Thermal analysis report show at 450 C. Deformation is effecting end portion 2 - 3 mm. Stress amp Strain at that portion is also low 0. 1 - 0. 3 Mpa. Heat transfer of air is more than insulating materials. Thus Heat transfer rate of Insulating materials being low they dont conduct heat from the bath tub to the atmosphere. So temperature of the bath tub is maintained.

40|$|Bachelor's thesis "Story of {{an educated}} Romany lady" is {{concerned}} with the issue of Romany education. In essence, thesis mainly consists of a case study of one Romany lady who, unlike most of the Romani citizens in the Czech Republic, managed to struggle through the Czech educational system up to the university studies. The goal of the study is to become familiar with the subject and to describe important motivational forces in subject's life that led to the desire for being educated. For this reason, the methodological perspective is qualitative. Data were collected via half-structured interviews and the "Axis of Life" method. Subsequently, all data were analyzed and interpreted in the context of specialized literature. Thesis is divided to three main parts - theoretical, methodological and empirical. Sources used in the theoretical <b>part</b> <b>cover</b> various fields, such as psychology, ethnology, anthropology, pedagogy and sociology. Given sources mainly focus on the issue of education of Romany minority children and problem with identity, especially cultural and ethnical identity of Romany minority.

40|$|RNA is {{essential}} for all living organisms. It has important roles in protein synthesis, controlling gene expression as well as catalyzing biological reactions. Chemically RNA is a very stable molecule, although in biological systems many agents catalyze the cleavage of RNA, such as naturally occurring enzymes and ribozymes. Much effort has been put in the last decades in developing highly active artificial ribonucleases since such molecules could have potential in the therapeutic field and provide tools for molecular biology. Several potential catalysts have emerged, but usually detailed cleavage mechanism remains unresolved. This thesis is aimed at clarifying mechanistic details of the cleavage and isomerization of RNA by using simpler nucleoside models of RNA. The topics in the experimental <b>part</b> <b>cover</b> three different studies, one concerning the mechanism of catalysis by large ribozymes, one dealing with the reactivity of modified and unmodified RNA oligonucleotides and one showing an efficient catalysis of the cleavage and isomerization of an RNA phosphodiester bond by a dinuclear metal ion complex. A {{review of the literature}} concerning stabilization of the phosphorane intermediate of the hydrolysis and isomerization of RNA phosphodiester bond is first presented. The results obtained in the experimental work followed by mechanistic interpretations are introduced {{in the second part of}} the thesis. Especially the significance of hydrogen bonding interactions is discussed...|$|E
