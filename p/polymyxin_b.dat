25|$|Fluid {{support is}} {{essential}} to maintain blood pressure, often {{with the help of}} colloids or hypertonic saline. NSAIDs are commonly given to reduce systemic inflammation. However, they decrease the levels of certain prostaglandins that normally promote healing of the intestinal mucosa, which subsequently increases the amount of endotoxin absorbed. To counteract this, NSAIDs are sometimes administered with a lidocaine drip, which appears to reduce this particular negative effect. Flunixin may be used for this purpose at a dose lower than that used for analgesia, so can be safely given to a colicky horse without risking masking signs that the horse requires surgery. Other drugs that bind endotoxin, such as <b>polymyxin</b> <b>B</b> and Bio-Sponge, are also often used. Polymixin B prevents endotoxin from binding to inflammatory cells, but is potentially nephrotoxic, so should be used with caution in horses with azotemia, especially neonatal foals.

LPS from B 5055 ΔlpxM displayed a fourfold increased binding affinity for <b>polymyxins</b> <b>B</b> and E compared with the B 5055 WT LPS. EC 50 values were consistent with polymyxin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values for each strain. Accordingly, polymyxin exposure considerably enhanced the permeability of the B 5055 ΔlpxM OM.

40|$|We {{suggest a}} novel {{approach}} to enhancing antimicrobial drug action by utilizing engineered peptide conjugates. Our most potent conjugates, [fMLF]PMBN and [fMLF]PMEN, are nonapeptides derived from <b>polymyxin</b> <b>B's</b> (PMB's) cyclic moiety (Thr-Dab-cyclo[Dab-Dab-d-Phe-Leu-Dab-Dab-Thr], where Dab is 2, 4 -diaminobutyric acid) and polymyxin E's (PME's) cyclic moiety (Thr-Dab-cyclo[Dab-Dab-d-Leu-Leu-Dab-Dab-Thr]), respectively, attached to a linear tail comprised of formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLF). The cyclic part binds to gram-negative lipopolysaccharides, rendering the bacterial outer membrane permeable to hydrophobic antibiotics. The tail confers chemotactic and opsonic activities upon the conjugates. These two activities {{appear to be the}} basis for the conjugates' antibacterial activities. The conjugates are 8 to 10 times less toxic than the parent PMB or PME antibiotics. Fourteen of 18 mice lethally challenged with erythromycin-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae survived following intraperitoneal administration of erythromycin and [fMLF]PMBN, whereas erythromycin or the peptide conjugate alone had no effect. Moreover, the clearance of Klebsiella from blood was markedly enhanced by intravenous injection of the [fMLF]PMEN peptide conjugate compared to the clearance of the organism from the mice treated with buffer alone as a control and was similar to that achieved by the PME antibiotic. Blood clearance was also significantly enhanced by administration of PMEN either alone or in a mixture with fMLF, although the effect was less than that produced by the peptide conjugate. Since resistance to polymyxins, the parent molecules of the synthetic cyclic peptides, is rare, the emergence of bacteria resistant to the antimicrobial properties of the peptide conjugates may be precluded as well...|$|R

40|$|Microbial {{colonization}} of indwelling devices remains {{a major concern}} in modern healthcare. Developing approaches to prevent biomaterial-associated infections (BAI) is, therefore, in great demand. This study aimed to immobilize two antimicrobial peptides (<b>polymyxins</b> <b>B</b> and E) onto polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) using two polydopamine (pDA) -based approaches: the conventional two-step method involving the deposition of a pDA layer to which biomolecules are immobilized, and a one-step method where peptides are dissolved together with dopamine before its polymerization. Surface characterization confirms the immobilization of polymyxins onto PDMS at a non-toxic concentration. Immobilization of polymyxins using a one-step pDA-based approach is able to prevent Pseudomonas aeruginosa adhesion and kill a significant fraction of the adherent ones. Living cells adhered to these modified surfaces exhibit the same susceptibility pattern as cells adhered to unmodified surfaces, highlighting no resistance development. Results suggest that polymyxins immobilization holds a great potential as an additional antimicrobial functionality {{in the design of}} biomaterials.

40|$|International audienceColistin is {{a mixture}} of {{polymyxin}} E 1 and E 2, bactericidal pentacationic lipopeptides used to treat infections caused by Gram-negative pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Industrial production of colistin is obtained by a fermentation process of the natural producer Paenibacillus polymyxa var colistinus. NonRibosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS) coding the biosynthesis of <b>polymyxins</b> A, <b>B</b> and P have been recently described, rendering thereof the improvement of their production possible. However, the colistin biosynthesis pathway was not published so far. In this study, a Paenibacillus alvei has been identified by biochemical (Api 50 CH system) and molecular (16 S rDNA sequencing) methods. Its culture supernatant displayed inhibitory activity against Gram-negative bacteria (P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, Salmonella spp.). Two polymyxins, E 1 and E 2, were recovered from the supernatant and were characterized by high resolution LC-MS. A genomic library (960 clones) was constructed to identify the gene cluster responsible for biosynthesis of polymyxins. Selection of the clones harbouring the sequences of interest was obtained by a simple PCR-based screening. We used primers targeting NRPS sequences leading to the incorporation of amino acids present in polymyxins E. The sequences from three clones of interest were assembled on 50. 4 kb. Thus, five open reading frames corresponding to a new NRPS gene cluster of 41 kb were identified. In silico, analyses revealed the presence of three NRPS implicated in the biosynthesis of polymyxins E.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the efficacy of}} two regimens of selective decontamination of the digestive tract in mechanically ventilated patients. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, concurrent trial. SETTING: Multidisciplinary intensive care unit (ICU) in a 1, 800 -bed university hospital. PATIENTS: Consecutive patients (n = 660) who were likely to require mechanical ventilation for at least 48 hrs were randomized {{to one of three}} groups: conventional antibiotic regimen (control group A); oral and enteral ofloxacin-amphotericin B (group B); and oral and enteral <b>polymyxin</b> E-tobramycin-amphotericin <b>B</b> (group C). Both treatment groups received systemic antibiotics for 4 days (ofloxacin in group B and cefotaxime in group C). INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized to receive standard treatment (control group A, n = 220), selective decontamination regimen B (group B, n = 220), and selective decontamination regimen C (group C, n = 220). After early deaths and exclusions from the study, 185 controls (group A) and 193 (group B) / 200 (group C) selective decontamination regimen patients were available for analysis. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Measurements included colonization and primary/secondary infection rate, ICU mortality rate, emergence of antibiotic resistance, length of ICU stay, and antimicrobial agent costs. The study duration was 19 months. The patient groups were fully comparable for age, diagnostic category, and severity of illness. One third of patients in each group suffered a nosocomial infection at the time of admission. There was a significant difference between treatment group B and control group A in the number of infected patients (odds ratio of 0. 42, 95 % confidence interval of 0. 27 to 0. 64), secondary lower respiratory tract infection (odds ratio of 0. 47, 95 % confidence interval of 0. 26 to 0. 82), and urinary tract infection (odds ratio of 0. 47, 95 % confidence interval of 0. 27 to 0. 81). Significantly more Gram-positive bacteremias occurred in treatment group C vs. group A (odds ratio of 1. 22, 95 % confidence interval 0. 72 to 2. 08). Infection at the time of admission proved to be the most significant risk factor for subsequent infection in control and both treatment groups. ICU mortality rate was almost identical (group A 16. 8 %, group B 17. 6 %, and group C 15. 5 %) and was not significantly related to primary or secondary infection. Increased antimicrobial resistance was recorded in both treatment groups: tobramycin-resistant enterobacteriaceae (group C 48 % vs. group A 14 %, p <. 01), ofloxacin-resistant enterobacteriaceae (group B 50 % vs. group A 11 %, p <. 02), ofloxacin-resistant nonfermenters (group B 81 % vs. group A 52 %, p <. 02), and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (group C 83 % vs. group A 55 %, p <. 05). Antimicrobial agent costs were comparable in control and group C patients; one third less was spent for group B patients. CONCLUSIONS: In cases of high colonization and infection rates at the time of ICU admission, the preventive benefit of selective decontamination is highly debatable. Emergence of multiple antibiotic-resistant microorganisms creates a clinical problem and a definite change in the ecology of environmental, colonizing, and infecting bacteria. The selection of multiple antibiotic-resistant Gram-positive cocci is particularly hazardous. No beneficial effect on survival is observed.

40|$|One of {{the major}} threats to human health in the 21 st century is the {{emergence}} of pathogenic bacteria that are resistant to multiple antibiotics, thereby limiting treatment options. An important route through which pathogens become resistant is via acquisition of resistance genes from environmental and human-associated bacteria. Yet, it is poorly understood to what extent and by what mechanisms these so-called reservoirs contribute to emerging resistance. Therefore, the work described in this thesis focussed on generating novel insights into different niches as sources of resistance, with a particular focus on the human gut microbiota as well as on microbial communities associated with marine sponges, especially because the latter have been described as one of the richest sources of bioactive secondary metabolites, including a broad range of antimicrobials. Cultivation-based methods were complemented with culture-independent approaches in order to study bacterial taxa that are not readily cultivated. Using metatranscriptomics it was found that clinically relevant antibiotic resistance genes are expressed in a broad range of environmental niches including human, mouse and pig gut microbiota, sea bacterioplankton, a marine sponge, forest soil and sub-seafloor sediment. The diversity of resistance gene transcripts differed greatly per niche indicating that the environment contains a rich reservoir of functional resistance that could be accessible by pathogens. Even though resistance gene expression might be linked to the presence of natural antibiotics, we did not detect expression of the corresponding secondary metabolite biosynthesis clusters. Thirty-one antibiotic-resistant bacteria, amongst which three belonging to potentially novel Flavobacteriaceae spp., were isolated from the Mediterranean sponges Aplysina aerophoba, Corticium candelabrum and Petrosia ficiformis. Isolates were identified in a high throughput manner by double-barcoded 16 S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Furthermore, analysis of sponge tissue-derived bacterial biomass growing on agar media showed that many novel bacterial taxa can still be isolated by conventional cultivation methods. Genomic DNA from the 31 antibiotic resistant bacteria was interrogated with respect to the presence of active resistance genes by functional metagenomics. In addition, we also screened metagenomic libraries prepared from DNA directly isolated from sponge tissue in order to circumvent the need for cultivation. In total, 37 unique resistance genes were identified, and the predicted gene products of 15 of these shared < 90 % amino acid identity with known gene products. One resistance gene (blaPSV- 1), which was classified into a new β-lactamase family, was found to be exclusive to the marine specific genus Pseudovibrio. These findings raised questions as to the functional roles of these genes in sponges, but more importantly, the functionality of these genes in E. coli shows that they can potentially be harnessed by phylogenetically distinct bacteria in other environments, including human pathogens. As such, it is a wake-up call as to the significance of marine resistance reservoirs. Pseudovibrio, a genus of α-Proteobacteria, was studied in more detail by comparative genomics as it comprises bacteria that potentially play a role as sponge symbionts and marine hubs of antibiotics resistance. Based on gene content, members of the genus Pseudovibrio were found to cluster by sponge sampling location indicating geographic speciation. Furthermore, Pseudovibrio spp. isolated from sponges near the Spanish coast clustered by sponge, suggesting host-specific colonization or adaptation. Strong support for Pseudovibrio spp. forming symbiotic relations with sponges came from the presence of a plethora of (predicted) conserved symbiosis-related functions in their genomes. A final study aimed to isolate novel antibiotic resistant reservoir species from the human gut microbiota using a targeted approach. Faecal samples from hospitalized patients that received Selective Digestive Decontamination (SDD), a prophylactic treatment with a cocktail of different antibiotics (tobramycin, <b>polymyxin</b> E, amphotericin <b>B</b> and cefotaxime), were inoculated anaerobically on agar media, after which bacterial biomass was analysed by 16 S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Six novel taxa were identified that, based on their growth on media supplemented with the SDD antibiotics, could serve as clinically relevant reservoirs of antibiotic resistance. For one of these six taxa a member was obtained in pure culture by targeted isolation. The abundance of antibiotic resistant uncultivated taxa in the human gut microbiota warrants further research as to their potential roles in resistance dissemination. In conclusion, this thesis provides deeper insights into different environmental niches as reservoirs of antibiotic resistance. The results can serve to prime and inspire future research...|$|R
