5|$|The {{effective}} capacity to exchange information worldwide through two-way telecommunication networks grew from 281 petabytes of (optimally compressed) information in 1986, to 471 petabytes in 1993, to 2.2 (optimally compressed) exabytes in 2000, and to 65 (optimally compressed) exabytes in 2007. This is the informational equivalent of two newspaper pages per <b>person</b> <b>per</b> <b>day</b> in 1986, and six entire newspapers per <b>person</b> <b>per</b> <b>day</b> by 2007. Given this growth, telecommunications play {{an increasingly important}} role in the world economy and the global telecommunications industry was about a $4.7 trillion sector in 2012. The service revenue of the global telecommunications industry was estimated to be $1.5 trillion in 2010, corresponding to 2.4% of the world’s gross domestic product (GDP).|$|E
5|$|Some {{palladium}} is emitted {{with the}} exhaust gases of cars with catalytic converters. Between 4 and 108ng/km of palladium particulate is released by such cars, while the total uptake from food {{is estimated to}} be less than 2µg per person a day. The second possible source of palladium is dental restoration, from which the uptake of palladium {{is estimated to be}} less than 15µg per <b>person</b> <b>per</b> <b>day.</b> People working with palladium or its compounds might have a considerably greater uptake. For soluble compounds such as palladium chloride, 99% is eliminated from the body within 3 days.|$|E
5|$|Off South Africa, {{the round}} ribbontail ray is {{captured}} incidentally by prawn trawlers on offshore banks, {{but is not}} utilized. Because of its size and strength, it is also prized by sport anglers, who usually release it unharmed. South Africa sets a recreational bag limit of one ray per species per <b>person</b> <b>per</b> <b>day,</b> and does not allow spearfishing for this species. In Australian waters, this ray has been assessed as of Least Concern. Although it is caught (and discarded) by prawn trawlers, this mortality has been reduced by the mandatory installation of Turtle Excluder Devices (TEDs). Furthermore, a portion of its Australian range lies within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. This species has also been listed under Least Concern in the Maldives where, due to the tourist value of rays, the government has created protected marine reserves and banned the export of rays in 1995 and ray skins in 1996.|$|E

Most medieval Europeans toiled long hours to produce or earn much less than the equivalent of $2 per <b>person</b> <b>per</b> <b>day,</b> from which they paid tithes, taxes, and rents. To make fishing a viable economic alternative to other means of subsistence, a significant majority of fleets leaving port had to reach the fisheries and return alive and intact.|$|E

The Times alleged that members had taken courses in how to use knives and rifles, and had produced reports for South Africa on anti-apartheid groups in the United States.

25|$|There {{have also}} been campaigns to urge people to {{conserve}} water, reducing consumption from 165 litres per <b>person</b> <b>per</b> <b>day</b> in 2003 to 155 litres in 2009. The target is to lower it to 140 litres by 2030. Public education was an important instrument to promote water conservation. For example, a Water Efficiency Labeling Scheme for taps, showerheads, toilets and washing machines was introduced so that consumers could make informed choices when making purchases. Also, the tariff structure was modified. While tariffs historically included a cross-subsidy from industries that paid a higher price to residential users that paid a lower price for social reasons, this policy was ended and residential users were charged a tariff that covers the full costs of supply. The level of water losses - more precisely defined as non-revenue water - {{is one of the}} lowest in the world at only 5%.|$|E
