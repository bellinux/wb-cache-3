5|$|The {{distance}} to Vega {{can be determined}} by measuring its <b>parallax</b> shift against the background stars as the Earth orbits the Sun. The first person to publish a star's <b>parallax</b> was Friedrich G. W. von Struve, when he announced a value of 0.125arcseconds (0.125″) for Vega. Friedrich Bessel was skeptical about Struve's data, and, when Bessel published a <b>parallax</b> of 0.314″ for the star system 61 Cygni, Struve revised his value for Vega's <b>parallax</b> to nearly double the original estimate. This change cast further doubt on Struve's data. Thus most astronomers at the time, including Struve, credited Bessel with the first published <b>parallax</b> result. However, Struve's initial result was actually close to the currently accepted value of 0.129″, {{as determined by the}} Hipparcos astrometry satellite.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Hipparcos <b>parallaxes</b> x {{distances}} to individual {{stars in the}} Hyades cluster with an accuracy of 6 per-cent. We use the Hipparcos proper motions, which have a larger relative precision than the trigonometric paral-laxes, to derive 3 times more precise distance estimates, by assuming that all members share the same space motion. An investigation of the available kinematic data conrms that the Hyades velocity eld does not contain signi cant structure {{in the form of}} rotation and/or shear, but is fully consistent with a common space motion plus a (one-dimensional) internal velocity dispersion of 0. 30 km s− 1. The improved <b>parallaxes</b> as a set are statistically consistent with the Hipparcos <b>parallaxes.</b> The maximum expected systematic error in the proper motion-based <b>parallaxes</b> for stars in the outer regions of the cluster (i. e., beyond 2 tidal radii 20 pc) is < 0. 30 mas. The new <b>parallaxes</b> conrm that the Hipparcos measurements are correlated on small angular scales, consistent with the limits specied in the Hipparcos Catalogue, though with signicantly smaller " than claimed by Narayanan & Gould. We use the Tycho 2 long time-baseline astrometric catalogue to derive a set of independent proper motion-based <b>parallaxes</b> for the Hipparcos members.

40|$|We present further {{arguments}} that the Hipparcos <b>parallaxes</b> {{for some of}} the clusters and associations represented in the Hipparcos catalog should be used with caution {{in the study of the}} Galactic structure. It has already been shown that the discrepancy between the Hipparcos and ground-based <b>parallaxes</b> for several clusters including the Pleiades, Coma Ber, and NGC 6231 can be resolved by recomputing the Hipparcos astrometric solutions with an improved algorithm diminishing correlated errors in the attitude parameters. Here we present new <b>parallaxes</b> obtained with this algorithm for another group of stars with discrepant data - the galactic cluster Cr 121. The original Hipparcos <b>parallaxes</b> led de Zeeuw et al. to conclude that Cr 121 and the surrounding association of OB stars form a relatively compact and coherent moving group at a distance of ≃ 550 - 600 pc. Our corrected <b>parallaxes</b> reveal a different spatial distribution of young stellar populace in this area. Both the cluster Cr 121 and the extended OB association are considerably more distant (750 - 1000 pc), and the latter has a large depth probably extending beyond 1 kpc.

5|$|In the 16th century Tycho Brahe {{demonstrated}} that comets must exist outside the Earth's atmosphere {{by measuring the}} <b>parallax</b> of the Great Comet of 1577 from observations collected by geographically separated observers.

5|$|Measurements of the {{distance}} have elicited much controversy. Results prior to {{the launch of the}} Hipparcos satellite generally found that the Pleiades were about 135 parsecs away from Earth. Data from Hipparcos yielded a surprising result, namely a distance of only 118 parsecs by measuring the <b>parallax</b> of stars in the cluster—a technique that should yield the most direct and accurate results. Later work consistently argued that the Hipparcos distance measurement for the Pleiades was erroneous. In particular, distances derived to the cluster via the Hubble Space Telescope and infrared color-magnitude diagram fitting favor a distance between 135 and 140 pc; a dynamical distance from optical interferometric observations of the Pleiad double Atlas favors a distance of 133–137 pc. However, the author of the 2007–2009 catalog of revised Hipparcos parallaxes reasserted that {{the distance}} to the Pleiades is ~120 pc and challenged the dissenting evidence. Recently, Francis and Anderson proposed that a systematic effect on Hipparcos <b>parallax</b> errors for stars in clusters biases calculation using the weighted mean and gave a Hipparcos <b>parallax</b> distance of 126 pc and photometric distance 132 pc based on stars in the AB Doradus, Tucana-Horologium, and Beta Pictoris moving groups, which are all similar in age and composition to the Pleiades. Those authors note that the difference between these results can be attributed to random error.|$|E

5|$|Since the {{collimated}} image {{produced by}} the sight is only truly <b>parallax</b> free at infinity, the sight has an error circle equal to {{the diameter of the}} collimating optics for any target at a finite distance.
