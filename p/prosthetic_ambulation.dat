40|$|Objective: To predict {{successful}} <b>prosthetic</b> <b>ambulation</b> {{for patients}} immediately transferred to an inpatient rehabilitation facility after amputation surgery. Methods: Seventy-five individuals with lower-limb amputation were studied at a tertiary acute care and rehabilitation facility. Successful <b>prosthetic</b> <b>ambulation,</b> {{defined as the}} ability to ambulate with a prosthesis at least 45 m, was measured in addition to other key demographic and medical factors. Results: Sixty-eight percent were successful prosthetic ambulators at rehabilitation discharge. The absence of residual-limb contracture and a longer length of stay during rehabilitation showed a significant relationship to successful <b>prosthetic</b> <b>ambulation</b> with regression analysis. Younger age was modestly correlated to outcome. There were no significant differences when comparing success of the early rehabilitation program with surgical level or etiology of amputation. For successful prosthetic users, mean wear time at rehabilitation discharge was 5. 7 hours with a mean distance walked of 67 m. Of those who failed this approach, 70 % were related to a failure of wound healing. Conclusions: In this cohort, 68 % of patients who were selected for a trial of early prosthetic rehabilitation ambulated using a prosthesis at rehabilitation discharge. This approach appears to be more effective for younger patients without contractures who are medically stable to participate in the rehabilitation process...|$|E

40|$|Background: Dysvascularity is {{the main}} cause of lower limb amputations in Scotland and there is an {{insignificant}} proportion (1. 7 %) of knee disarticulations (KD), despite the benefits of the amputation. Objectives: The outcomes of knee disarticulation and its associated surgical techniques will be evaluated based on healing, reamputations, functional outcomes, <b>prosthetic</b> <b>ambulation,</b> and gait biomechanics, to determine whether a greater rate of knee disarticulations can be justified among dysvascular patients. Study design: Systematic review Methods: Key electronic databases were searched for the relevant literature based on a pre-specified eligibility criterion. Results: The 17 articles included in this review were appraised for their quality, and key findings extracted. Conclusion: Healing rates are favourable, but {{there is a need for}} appropriate amputation level selection to prevent reamputations. Knee disarticulation patients have better maintenance of independent living status than transfemoral patients, but overall <b>prosthetic</b> <b>ambulation</b> rates are inconsistent. In terms of gait biomechanics of knee disarticulation, there are some positive indications but the evidence is insubstantial. A stronger body of evidence is required in this subject field, and recommendations are made for future research - Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network Grade of Recommendation - C...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Musculoskeletal {{imbalances}} or pathologies often {{develop into}} secondary physical conditions or complications {{that may affect}} the mobility {{and quality of life}} of people with lowerlimb amputation. Using one or more prostheses causes people with amputation to alter the biomechanics of their movement. For example, people with lower-limb amputation often favor and stress their intact lower limb more during everyday activities. This can lead to degenerative changes such as osteoarthritis of the knee and/or hip joints of the intact limb. Since people with amputation spend less time on their residual limb, osteopenia and subsequent osteoporosis often occur secondary to insufficient loading through the long bones of the lower limb. A proper prosthetic fit increases the probability of equal force distribution across the intact and <b>prosthetic</b> limbs during <b>ambulation,</b> thus decreasing the risk of osteoarthritis. People with limb loss commonly complain of back pain, which is linked to poor prosthetic fit and alignment, postural changes, leg-length discrepancy, amputation level, and general deconditioning. We review the literature on secondary complications among people with lowerlimb loss who are long-term prosthesis wearers. Key words: back pain, fracture, leg-length discrepancy, lowerlimb amputation, osteoarthritis, osteopenia, osteoporosis, prosthetics, rehabilitation, secondary complications...|$|R

40|$|Background: Dysvascularity is {{the main}} cause of lower limb amputations in Scotland and there is an {{insignificant}} proportion (1. 7 %) of knee disarticulation (KD), despite the benefits of the amputation. Objectives: The outcomes of KD and its associated techniques will be evaluated based on quality of stump, functional outcomes, <b>prosthetic</b> <b>ambulation</b> and gait biomechanics, to determine if a greater rate of KD can be justified among dysvascular patients. Methods: Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library and Science Direct were searched for the relevant literature based on a pre-specified eligibility criteria. Studies were critically appraised and data extraction/synthesis were carried out. Results/ Quality appraisal: SIGN 50 Grade of Recommendation, C. 17 studies reported on the quality of stump. Healing rates are comparible to trans-femoral levels of other studies. However, there are risks of reamputations if the method of amputation level selection is inappropriate. The key is to have ancillary physiologoical tests to supplement clinical judgements during selection. Functional Outcomes: Four studies reported on functional outcomes, which were pooere with more proximal amputations. Trans-femoral patients had poorer maintenance of preoperative independent status than KD patients, however results were only from a 1 -year follow-up periosd. Prosthetic Ambulation: Nine studies reported on <b>prosthetic</b> <b>ambulation.</b> Ambulation rates vary largely across studies, however most patients had limited preoperative mobility and it would be more accurate to indicate the maintenance of ambulatory multi-disciplinary involvement in the research teams. Gait Biomechanics: two studies reported on gait biomechanics and walking capacity decreased with more proximal amputation levels. One study indicated that KD provided greater stabilioty than trans-tibial levels for dysvascular patients, but the evidence was insubstantial. Overview of Surgical Techniques: The anterior flap is unsuitable for dysvascular patients. Theoretically, the posterior flap allow 3 s better vascularisation and padding than sagittal flaps, but there was no direct comparisons between both techniques. The Mazet technique is potentially propitious in the quality of stump and <b>prosthetic</b> <b>ambulation,</b> but more robust study designs are required to justify that the technique is suitable for dysvascular patients. Gritti-Stokes amputations had low re-amputation rates, but controversial ambulation rates, and may be suitable for non-ambulatory patients. Recommendations: The overall strength of evidence of current literature is low and further creditable research is required to determine if a greater proportion of KD’s can be justified among dysvascular patients with comparisons to different amputation levels and the inclusion of results from long-term follow-up periods. Variable have to be fully identified and accounted for in multivariate analyses as rehabilitation outcomes are multifactorial. If <b>prosthetic</b> <b>ambulation</b> is measured, the involvement of prosthetists and physiotherapists with the use of validated mobility scales are necessary...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Introduction Dysvascular amputations are {{increasingly}} performed {{in patients with}} underlying cardiac and pulmonary disorders. A limb prosthesis is rarely offered to patients with severe {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} because of their inability to achieve the high energy expenditure required for <b>prosthetic</b> <b>ambulation.</b> We describe a case of successful prosthetic fitting and rehabilitation of a patient with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with the aid of oxygen supplementation. Case presentation A 67 -year-old aboriginal woman with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and hypercapnic respiratory failure underwent right trans-tibial (below the knee) amputation for severe foot gangrene. An aggressive rehabilitation program of conditioning exercises and gait training utilizing oxygen therapy was initiated. She was custom-fitted with a right trans-tibial prosthesis. A rehabilitation program improved her strength, endurance and stump contracture, and she was able to walk for short distances with the prosthesis. The motion analysis studies showed a cadence of 73. 5 steps per minute, a velocity of 0. 29 meters per second and no difference in right and left step time and step length. Conclusion This case report illustrates that patients with significant severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease can be successfully fitted with limb prostheses and undergo rehabilitation using supplemental oxygen along with optimization of their underlying comorbidities. Despite the paucity of published information in this area, prosthesis fitting and rehabilitation should be considered in patients who have undergone amputation and have severe chronic obstructive disease. </p...|$|E
