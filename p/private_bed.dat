6000|$|My friends, Mr. G. K. Chesterton and Mr. Max Beerbohm, those {{brilliant}} ornaments of our age, {{when they}} chance {{to write about}} Socialism, confess this universal failing--albeit {{in a very different}} quality and measure. They are not, it is true, distressed by that unwashed coal-heaver who haunts the now <b>private</b> <b>bed</b> of the common Anti-Socialist, nor have they any horrid vision of the fathers of the community being approved by a select committee of the County Council--no doubt wrapped in horse-cloths and led out by their grooms--such as troubles the spurred and quivering soul of that equestrian--I forget his name--the [...] "brood-mare" [...] gentleman who denounced me in the Pall Mall Gazette; but their souls fly out in a passion of protest against the hints of discipline and order the advancement of Socialism reveals. Mr. G. K. Chesterton mocks valiantly and passionately, I know, against an oppressive and obstinately recurrent anticipation of himself in Socialist hands, hair clipped, meals of a strictly hygienic description at regular hours, a fine for laughing--not that he would want to laugh--and austere exercises in several of the more metallic virtues daily. Mr. Max Beerbohm's conception is rather in the nature of a nightmare, a hopeless, horrid, frozen flight from the pursuit of Mr. Sidney Webb and myself, both of us short, inelegant men indeed, but for all that terribly resolute, indefatigable, incessant, to capture him, to drag him off to a mechanical Utopia and there to take his thumb-mark and his name, number him distinctly in indelible ink, dress him in an unbecoming uniform, and let him loose (under inspection) in a world of neat round lakes of blue lime water and vistas of white sanitary tiling....|$|E

General Secretary, Karnataka State <b>Private</b> <b>B.Ed.</b> College Principals and Lecturers Association, said: [...] "The association rejects the report of the Task Force as it is unscientific and undemocratic.

How can they trespass colleges, seize documents and approach outside regulatory bodies against the colleges?" ...|$|E
5000|$|A BJP MLC {{and senior}} ABVP leader asked the {{government}} to scrap the Bangalore University B.Ed Task Force, alleging {{that it has been}} targeting and harassing a few colleges. The MLC, Prof. P.V. Krishna Bhat, wrote a letter to Legislative Council chairman D.H. Shankaramurthy, stating that he wanted to raise the issue during the monsoon session. [...] "Principals of many B.Ed. colleges have told me that this task force, headed by Mr. Karan Kumar, is conducting surprise raids on <b>private</b> <b>B.Ed.</b> colleges in the city and is harassing college managements in the name of inspection. The government should interfere immediately and must {{put an end to this}} task force," [...] he states in the letter. Prof. Bhat said it is the responsibility of the Local Inquiry Committee to report any loopholes in colleges, and it is the prerogative of the BU Syndicate to act against such colleges, based on the LIC report. Mr. Bhat has alleged that the task force has no legal sanctity and is harassing the B.Ed colleges. [...] Prof. Bhatâ€™s letter comes as a surprise to many academics, who were pressuring BU to implement the B.Ed task force report which has shed light on the corrupt practices of these colleges. [...] "There may be some technical issues with the B.Ed Task Force, but it is doing a wonderful job. It has done what the Syndicate and LIC could not do for years. It is the ABVP which is in the forefront of all agitations aimed at bringing qualitative changes in the higher education sector. But no one knows why a senior ABVP leader like Prof. Bhat is opposing it," [...] said a senior faculty member of the university.|$|E
40|$|Health {{care systems}} in many {{developed}} countries have services financed and provided by {{both public and private}} sectors. In Ireland, though, the public/private mix is atypical: a private patient can be treated in an acute public hospital and seen by a consultant who may also treat public patients within the same hospital. Nationally, one in five beds in acute public hospitals is designated for use by private patients and existing legislation restricts accommodation of a private patient in a public-designated bed. Yet there are concerns that acute public hospitals may sidestep such restrictions on their private practice, resulting in public hospital resources potentially being diverted away from public patients towards their private counterparts. Indeed, Irish providers face financial incentives which favour the treatment of private patients. Consultants are rewarded on a fee-for-service basis for private care, but receive a salary for public practice. Public hospitals, meanwhile, receive a fixed daily payment for every private patient in a <b>private</b> <b>bed.</b> Added to these financial incentives is an increased opportunity to engage in private practice due to the substantial recent growth in private health insurance subscribers...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Previous {{studies have}} {{attempted}} to link hygiene hypothesis with IBD. However most of these studies come from developed countries where the level of hygiene is high and universal. Very little data is available from developing countries. The present study explores the truth of hygiene hypotheses and other risk factors for ulcerative colitis (UC) in a North Indian population where the prevalence of UC has been increasing. Methods A total of 518 patients diagnosed with UC and 188 age-matched controls {{were included in the}} study. A structured questionnaire concerning socio-demographics and level of hygiene was completed by all participants. Logistic regression analysis was used to study the association between hygiene-related factors and the risk for UC. Odds ratios and 95 % confidence intervals were estimated. Results There was a higher proportion of females (P< 0. 001), and a higher educational status (P= 0. 01) in UC patients compared with controls. A family history of IBD was present in 7. 2 % of cases and non-existent in controls. On multivariate analysis, after accounting for potential confounders, having a <b>private</b> <b>bed</b> (P< 0. 001), and having better toilet facilities [(RCA versus none, P= 0. 01; Flush toilet versus none, P= 0. 01), (RCA LATRINE as a toilet technology used in rural areas where no flush facility exists. It was developed under RCA project) ] were inversely associated with risk fo...|$|E

50|$|Jack Ralite (born 14 May 1928) is a French politician. He {{was elected}} in 1973 to the Seine-Saint-Denis {{constituency}} for the French Communist Party. In 1981 he became Minister for Health and subsequently Minister for Employment (1981-1984). While serving as Minister for Health, he implemented a new health care policy that included the abolition of <b>private</b> <b>beds</b> in hospitals, reform of medical training, modernisation of facilities, and {{the election of the}} heads of medical services by the entire staff, rather than just by doctors, as had previously been the case.|$|R
40|$|Objectives. To {{study the}} {{variations}} in infant mortality rate (IMR) across Colombia's 33 administrative departments over the period 2003 - 2009, examine persistency of variations across departments over time, and relate those variations {{to the impact of}} socio-economic conditions and availability of care on IMR. Materials and methods. Using vital statistics and related socio-economic data we establish three types of analysis according to: (a) the variation of the departmental IMR (2003 - 2009), (b) the association between the departmental IMR and its key determinants over time, and (c) the lines of causality and relative impact of different factors, by using structural equations. Results. The 4. 7 fold ratio between the highest and lowest departmental IMR (2009) may be underestimated considering underreporting, especially in low-income departments. There is a negative association between the departmental IMR with time and a set of highly correlated variables, such as the mother education, income per capita, health insurance level and access to services. Conclusions. The effect of better insurance, availability of <b>private</b> <b>beds,</b> and having doctors attending mothers, eclipse the impact of better socioeconomic conditions. The range of services {{does not appear to be}} influenced by a rational policy; resources are not allocated according to the need, but with the general development. <b>Private</b> <b>beds</b> are made available where there is better health insurance...|$|R
