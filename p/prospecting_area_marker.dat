40|$|One of the {{principal}} objectives of this demonstration project is to test surface geochemical techniques for detecting trace amounts of light hydrocarbons in pore gases {{as a means of}} reducing risk in hydrocarbon exploration and production. During this reporting period, microbial samples were collected from the Springdale <b>prospect</b> <b>area</b> in Manistee County, Michigan. The samples were taken along the trace of the proposed horizontal wells. The samples are presently being analyzed and the results will be reported in the next quarterly report. The main news this reporting period is that the Springdale <b>prospect</b> <b>area</b> in Manistee County, Michigan, continues to see drilling activity.

40|$|Analysis of seismic multi {{attributes}} {{has been}} applied to identify the <b>prospect</b> <b>area</b> of hydrocarbon reservoir which is unidentified by using conventional seismic processing. Analysis was done by RMS amplitude, instantaneous amplitude, maximum amplitude, instantaneous phase and instantaneous frequency attributes computation that is the basic parameter for hydrocarbon reservoir characterization. These <b>prospect</b> <b>areas</b> were identified as high amplitudes, low phase and low frequency anomalies, which was response of the hydrocarbon existence. Seismic attributes were correlated to well log data to identify the physical properties such as rock porosity in area surrounding of well position. The result of seismic multi attributes analysis was shown by RMS amplitude attribute map, maximum amplitude attribute map, instantaneous amplitude attribute map, instantaneous phase attribute map and instantaneous frequency attribute map. These multi attribute maps had the same distribution of anomaly area at west-south. Based on correlation of production well with the zone of anomaly high amplitude, low phase and low frequency, some new <b>prospect</b> <b>areas</b> for drilling are proposed at zone a trap structure with direction Northwest –Southeast...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} archaeological {{prospecting}} {{for the purpose}} of finding a prehistoric settlement in Alsike hage, Alsike parish, Uppland.

40|$|Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM +) and {{airborne}} geophysics data {{have been used}} for locating porphyry copper and epithermal gold <b>prospect</b> <b>areas</b> related to hydrothermal alteration zones in the Lut block of eastern Iran. The Lut block has a great potential for different types of mineralization due to its extensive exposure of Cenozoic volcanic and subvolcanic calc-alkaline rocks generated in a subduction zone tectonic setting. Various ETM + images processing techniques were employed, including false color composite images, color composite ratio images, standard PC image analysis on six bands and color composite selective PC images. Application of these techniques detected four major <b>prospect</b> <b>areas</b> and also identified another small previously unknown alteration area in the southeastern part of the district. Color composition selective PC images proved to be the most reliable method for exploration. Airborne magnetometry data show high magnetism over the most of the study area, resulting from the presence of magnetic-series granitoid rocks and/or propylitic/potassic alteration zones with magnetite veins related to mineralization. Low magnetic areas reflect intense magnetic destruction in other types of alteration zone. Radiometry detected areas of high K and U counts that have resulted from the presence of sericite, clay minerals and K-feldspar in alteration zones with low magnetism...|$|R

Drill logs from each Uphole point was used in conjunction with the theoretical interpretations as a physical set of data to aid in making inferences for boundary distinction. Fifty two (52) Uphole locations were drilled and logged. Each location was drilled to 66 m and logged to 60 m. Litho logy from the bore samples reveals dominantly sand and clay units. The sand sizes ranges from fine to coarse. The records / playbacks have good signal quality with distinct first break times.

Analysis on the weathering thickness and velocities within the <b>prospect</b> <b>area</b> reveals that uphole locations have weathering thickness ranging from 2. 7 m to 11. 0 m.
