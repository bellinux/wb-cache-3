500|$|Potatoes {{were slow}} to be adopted amongst Welsh folk, despite being {{introduced}} to the UK in the 16th century; only in the early 18th century did they become a Welsh staple, due to grain failures.

But the spur was really nearer Hemlock Hill, and could have been reached more directly by a road from there. He, however, kept along the ridge, and after half an hour's ride was convinced that Jackson Tribbs could have communicated with Provy Smith without coming nearer Hemlock Hill, and this revived his former belief that they were together.

60|$|On the {{following}} day they met--but as flying leaves meet in the air. Sick they were not; but the wind propelled them hastily into rooms, violently downstairs. They passed each other gasping on deck; they shouted across tables. They wore fur coats; and Helen was never seen without a bandanna on her head. For comfort they retreated to their cabins, where with tightly wedged feet they let the ship bounce and tumble. Their sensations were the sensations of <b>potatoes</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> sack on a galloping horse. The world outside was merely a violent grey tumult. For two days they had a perfect rest from their old emotions. Rachel had just enough consciousness to suppose herself a donkey on the summit of a moor in a hail-storm, with its coat blown into furrows; then she became a wizened tree, perpetually driven back by the salt Atlantic gale.|$|E

They were all destroyed, he said, nobody knew how to milk except himself--where he is about right. Then came dinner and a delightful little surprise. Perhaps you remember that long ago I used not to eat mashed potatoes, but had always two or three boiled in a plate.

60|$|The Captain {{had spread}} the cloth with great care, and was making some egg-sauce {{in a little}} saucepan: basting the fowl {{from time to time}} during the process with a strong interest, as it turned and browned on a string before the fire. Having propped Florence up with {{cushions}} on the sofa, which was already wheeled into a warm corner for her greater comfort, the Captain pursued his cooking with extraordinary skill, making hot gravy in a second little saucepan, boiling a handful of <b>potatoes</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> third, never forgetting the egg-sauce in the first, and making an impartial round of basting and stirring with the most useful of spoons every minute. Besides these cares, the Captain had to keep his eye on a diminutive frying-pan, in which some sausages were hissing and bubbling in a most musical manner; and there was never such a radiant cook as the Captain looked, in the height and heat of these functions: it being impossible to say whether his face or his glazed hat shone the brighter.|$|E
6000|$|Breed's hut was {{standing}} {{only a dozen}} years ago, though it had long been unoccupied. It was {{about the size of}} mine. It was set on fire by mischievous boys, one Election night, if I do not mistake. I lived {{on the edge of the}} village then, and had just lost myself over Davenant's [...] "Gondibert," [...] that winter that I labored with a lethargy--which, by the way, I never knew whether to regard as a family complaint, having an uncle who goes to sleep shaving himself, and is obliged to sprout <b>potatoes</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> cellar Sundays, in order to keep awake and keep the Sabbath, or as the consequence of my attempt to read Chalmers' collection of English poetry without skipping. It fairly overcame my Nervii. I had just sunk my head on this when the bells rung fire, and in hot haste the engines rolled that way, led by a straggling troop of men and boys, and I among the foremost, for I had leaped the brook. We thought it was far south over the woods--we who had run to fires before--barn, shop, or dwelling-house, or all together. [...] "It's Baker's barn," [...] cried one. [...] "It is the Codman place," [...] affirmed another. And then fresh sparks went up above the wood, as if the roof fell in, and we all shouted [...] "Concord to the rescue!" [...] Wagons shot past with furious speed and crushing loads, bearing, perchance, among the rest, the agent of the Insurance Company, who was bound to go however far; and ever and anon the engine bell tinkled behind, more slow and sure; and rearmost of all, as it was afterward whispered, came they who set the fire and gave the alarm. Thus we kept on like true idealists, rejecting the evidence of our senses, until at a turn in the road we heard the crackling and actually felt the heat of the fire from over the wall, and realized, alas! that we were there. The very nearness of the fire but cooled our ardor. At first we thought to throw a frog-pond on to it; but concluded to let it burn, it was so far gone and so worthless. So we stood round our engine, jostled one another, expressed our sentiments through speaking-trumpets, or in lower tone referred to the great conflagrations which the world has witnessed, including Bascom's shop, and, between ourselves, we thought that, were we there in season with our [...] "tub," [...] and a full frog-pond by, we could turn that threatened last and universal one into another flood. We finally retreated without doing any mischief--returned to sleep and [...] "Gondibert." [...] But as for [...] "Gondibert," [...] I would except that passage in the preface about wit being the soul's powder--"but most of mankind are strangers to wit, as Indians are to powder." ...|$|E

50|$|Prior to cooking, {{the potato}} should be {{scrubbed}} clean, washed and dried with eyes and surface blemishes removed, and basted with oil (usually Olive oil) or butter and/or salt.
