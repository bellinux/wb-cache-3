40|$|The {{purpose of}} this Closure Report (CR) is to provide {{documentation}} of the completed corrective action and to provide data confirming the corrective action. The corrective action was performed following the approved Corrective Action Plan (CAP) (U. S. Department of Energy [DOE], 1999 b) and consisted of closure-in-place with partial excavation, disposal, backfilling, administrative controls, and post-closure monitoring. Soil with petroleum hydrocarbon concentrations above the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection (NDEP) Action Level of 100 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) (Nevada Administrative Code, 1996) was removed {{to a depth of}} 1. 5 meters (m) (5 feet [ft]). The excavations were backfilled with clean fill to restore the site and to prevent contact with deeper, closed-in-place soil that exceeded the NDEP Action Level. According to the Corrective Action Investigation Plan (CAIP) (DOE, 1998), the Mercury Fire Training Pit was used from approximately 1965 to the early 1990 s to train fire-fighting and emergency response personnel at the NTS and encompasses an area approximately 85 by 115 m (280 by 380 ft). The location of the Mercury Fire Training Pit is shown in Figure 1 and a site plan is shown in Figure 2. The Mercury Fire Training Pit formerly included a bermed bum pit with four small bum tanks; four large above ground storage tanks (ASTS); an overturned bus, a telephone pole storage area; and several areas for burning sheds, pallets, and cables. During the active life of the Mercury Fire Training <b>Pit,</b> <b>training</b> events were conducted at least monthly and sometimes as often as weekly. Fuels burned during these events included off-specification or rust-contaminated gasoline, diesel, and aviation fuel (JP- 4). Other items burned during these events included paint, tires, a pond liner, wood, paper, cloth, and copper cable. Approximately 570 liters (L) (150 gallons [gal]) of fuel were used for each training event resulting in an approximate total of 136, 000 L (36, 000 gal) of fuel used {{over the life of the}} Mercury Fire Training Pit. Unburned fuel was allowed to pool on the ground and was left to eventually volatilize or soak into the soil. In addition, fuels from the ASTS and fuels and fluids from the overturned bus leaked or spilled onto the ground. Approximately 19 L to 38 L (5 to 10 gal) of paint were also burned monthly until sometime in the 1970 s...|$|E

40|$|Starting in 1993, the Ultimate Fighting Championship {{broadcast}} ‘no-holds-barred’ fights, <b>pitting</b> athletes <b>trained</b> in {{a variety}} of combat sports against each other. While critics were scandalized by the permissiveness of these contests, aficionados were stunned by the effectiveness of relatively non-violent fighting techniques. The matches revealed how resilient a trained fighter’s body might become. Fighters had to adapt to several waves of changes in fighting strategies and to strategic revisions of match regulations intended to make them more obviously violent. Seemingly minor changes in the tools available to contestants - ‘mundane technology’ such as the structure of the fighting space, standardized clothing and lightweight gloves - shifted radically how contestants’ bodies could be used. In addition, fighters modified their own bodies to make them better suited for the activity, for example, altering perceptions of pain. Ironically, the mass-mediated presentation of deregulated fighting revealed that, instead of being humanity’s natural state, it was technically demanding, dependent upon substantial enculturation of athletes’ bodies, and far from instinctual. 26 page(s...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} the losses associated with powered industrial trucks (PIT) at Company X from January 1996 through September 1999. This task was accomplished through loss tab analysis. A review of accident reports from PITrelated accidents was performed in attempt to identify possible root causes of the accidents. Seventy-seven PIT-related accidents were identified. These accidents resulted in significant economic losses for Company X. Medical and indemnity payments from Worker’s Compensation claims resulting from these accidents totaled $ 347, 966. 42. Employees 19 - 25 years of age and/or with under 5 years of employment were found to be at highest risk to be involved in PIT-related accidents. Accident claims involving these groups resulted in approximately 40 % of incurred losses from PIT-related accidents at Company X. Additional risk factors were identified, such as speed of PIT operation and uneven surfaces. To reduce the impact of these risk factors, several control measures were recommended including enhanced <b>PIT</b> operator <b>training,</b> workplace hazard assessments, and more thorough accident reporting methods. iii Acknowledgement...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel {{technique}} for direct recognition of multiple speech streams given the single channel of mixed speech, without first separating them. Our technique {{is based on}} permutation invariant <b>training</b> (<b>PIT)</b> for automatic speech recognition (ASR). In PIT-ASR, we compute the average cross entropy (CE) over all frames in the whole utterance for each possible output-target assignment, pick {{the one with the}} minimum CE, and optimize for that assignment. PIT-ASR forces all the frames of the same speaker to be aligned with the same output layer. This strategy elegantly solves the label permutation problem and speaker tracing problem in one shot. Our experiments on artificially mixed AMI data showed that the proposed approach is very promising. Comment: 5 pages, 6 figures, InterSpeech 201...|$|R
5000|$|About {{half of the}} stations, mostly those {{actually}} underground, have a pit {{under the}} tracks. Originally constructed to drain water, they have now been shown {{to reduce the number}} and severity of injuries and deaths, although not to eliminate them: as a Transport for London (TfL) spokesperson has said, [...] "people fall into <b>pits</b> and the <b>train</b> rushes on overhead". A study of 58 cases showed that the presence of a suicide pit halved the number of deaths. Another safety mechanism are platform edge doors (PEDs), which separate the train from the passengers. These are installed exclusively at the below-ground stations of the Jubilee Line Extension. PEDs are expensive to install and can fail to open, adding a potential reliability problem to train services.|$|R
40|$|This report {{provides}} a summary {{and analysis of}} visual site inspections and soil gas sampling results for Corrective Action Unit (CAU) 342, Area 23 Mercury Fire <b>Training</b> <b>Pit.</b> CAU 342 is identified in the Federal Facility Agreement and Consent Order of 1996 and consists of Corrective Action Site 23 - 56 - 01, Former Mercury Fire <b>Training</b> <b>Pit.</b> This report covers calendar years 2004 and 2005. Visual site inspections were conducted on May 20 and November 14, 2004, and May 17 and November 15, 2005. No significant findings were observed during these inspections. The site was in good condition, and no repair activities were required. Soil gas samples were collected on November 29, 2005, for analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and semivolatile organic compounds (SVOCs), and samples were collected on December 1, 2005, for analysis of base gases. Base gas concentrations in the monitoring well show {{a high concentration of}} carbon dioxide and a low concentration of oxygen, which is an indication of biodegradation of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) in the soil. Results for VOCs and SVOCs are unchanged, with VOCs below or near laboratory method detection limits and no SVOCs detected above laboratory method detection limits. Post-closure monitoring was required for six years after closure of the site. Therefore, since 2005 was the sixth year of monitoring, the effectiveness of natural attenuation of the TPH-impacted soil by biodegradation was evaluated. The base gas concentrations indicate that biodegradation of TPH in the soil is occurring; therefore, it is recommended that monitoring be discontinued. Visual site inspections should continue to be performed biannually to ensure that the signs are in place and readable and that the use restriction has been maintained. The results of the site inspections will be documented in a letter report and submitted annually...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} novel deep {{learning}} model, which supports permutation invariant <b>training</b> (<b>PIT),</b> for speaker independent multi-talker speech separation, {{commonly known as}} the cocktail-party problem. Different from most of the prior arts that treat speech separation as a multi-class regression problem and the deep clustering technique that considers it a segmentation (or clustering) problem, our model optimizes for the separation regression error, ignoring the order of mixing sources. This strategy cleverly solves the long-lasting label permutation problem that has prevented progress on deep learning based techniques for speech separation. Experiments on the equal-energy mixing setup of a Danish corpus confirms the effectiveness of PIT. We believe improvements built upon PIT can eventually solve the cocktail-party problem and enable real-world adoption of, e. g., automatic meeting transcription and multi-party human-computer interaction, where overlapping speech is common.

40|$|This {{biennial}} soil gas {{monitoring report}} provides an analysis and summary of site inspections and soil gas monitoring data obtained at the Area 23 Mercury Fire <b>Training</b> <b>Pit</b> site, located in Area 23 of the Nevada Test Site, Nye County, Nevada, during the calendar years December 1999 [...] December 2001 monitoring period. This site is {{identified in the}} Federal Facility Agreement and Consent Order (FFACO, 1996) as Corrective Action Site (CAS) 23 - 56 - 01 {{and is the only}} CAS assigned to Corrective Action Unit 342. Inspections of the Area 23 Mercury Fire <b>Training</b> <b>pit</b> site are conducted to determine and document the physical condition of the site, monitoring well, and any unusual conditions that could impact the proper operation of the unit closure. Physical inspections of the closure were completed semiannually and indicated that the site is in good condition with no significant findings noted. The objective of the soil gas monitoring program is to determine if the remaining petroleum hydrocarbons beneath the above-ground storage tank area are undergoing natural biodegradation. Comparing initial conditions to those of the first biennial soil gas monitoring event indicate a general increase in concentration of organic analytes, although this trend is not strong. There has been a decrease in the amount of carbon dioxide, with the percentage of nitrogen and oxygen about the same. The increase in organic analytes indicates that mixing of the atmosphere with the air in the monitoring well is occurring. Changes in atmospheric pressure will drive air {{both in and out of}} the monitoring well. The change in carbon dioxide in the opposite direction possibly indicates a change in biological parameters between the sampling events. The sampling and analysis of future samples should be consistent with the methods already used. This includes sampling at the same time of year, but not immediately after a significant meteorological event. This means the results to date are not conclusive. Monitoring needs to be continued to make an effective evaluation...|$|R
