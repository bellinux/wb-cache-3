5|$|The Tribute Money is a fresco by the Italian renaissance painter Masaccio, {{located in}} the Brancacci Chapel of the {{basilica}} of Santa Maria del Carmine, Florence, and completed by his senior collaborator, Masolino. <b>Painted</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1420s, it is widely considered among Masaccio's best work, and {{a vital part of}} the development of renaissance art.|$|E
5|$|The high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes were {{designated}} in 1998. When they opened, {{they were the}} first anywhere in a rural area of Colorado. In a departure from the usual practice, the diamonds were <b>painted</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> right lanes rather than the left, so that Roaring Fork Transportation Authority (RFTA) buses could get to and from their stops more easily.|$|E
5|$|Next to the apse is a {{mural of}} Saint Cyril of Alexandria, captioned as “Saint Cyril the Philosopher”, the 9th-century missionary to the Slavs. Although the {{position}} and iconography of the portrait clearly identify it as an image of Cyril of Alexandria, the caption hints that the local population confused the two saints and Cyril the Philosopher was still well-remembered at the time. Other images <b>painted</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> church include these of the Dormition of the Mother of God (above the entrance), the Transfiguration of Jesus (under the vault), John Damascene, Cosmas of Maiuma, Archangel Michael (south of the entrance), Saint Constantine and Saint Helena (right of the entrance).|$|E

50|$|He <b>painted</b> many landscapes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{area near}} Silkeborg, and spent his summers {{starting}} in 1873 at Himmelbjerg, one of Denmark’s highest points.

5|$|Route {{branding}} {{has been}} increasingly used by Lothian since {{the introduction of}} low floor vehicles. Route branding highlights the route of certain services making the buses easier to be spotted throughout Lothian. Since May 2010 the Harlequin livery used to identify low floor buses has started to be phased out, as the company is now a full low floor operation, with {{a return to the}} traditional madder and white livery although the style has been altered slightly to suit the lines of modern buses. Each type of bus owned directly by Lothian Buses has had at least one of their type <b>painted</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> new livery.|$|E
5|$|Star Alliance's 27 member {{airlines}} {{operate a}} fleet of approximately 4,657 aircraft, serve more than 1,330 airports in 192 countries and carry 641.1million passengers per year on more than 18,500 daily departures. The alliance has a two-tier rewards program, Silver and Gold, with incentives including priority boarding and upgrades. Like other airline alliances, Star Alliance airlines share airport terminals (known as co-location) and many member planes are <b>painted</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> alliance's livery.|$|E
5|$|The Canadian Air and Space Museum (CASM), {{located at}} the former CFB Downsview, {{features}} a full-size replica Arrow built by volunteers with assistance from local aerospace firms. With a metal structure, the replica features many authentic-looking components including landing gear constructed by Messier-Dowty, the original Arrow primary landing gear sub-contractor. <b>Painted</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> colours of Arrow 25203, the Arrow replica was rolled out for a media event on 28 September 2006 and was on public display on 8–9 October 2006 to commemorate the original aircraft's rollout in 1957.|$|E

5|$|The Dening Hall has Daoist murals {{painted on}} {{three of its}} walls. The western wall's mural, {{said to have been}} <b>painted</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Tang Dynasty, {{measures}} 17 by 7 meters and features a local water deity with a winged being at the top. With similar dimensions to the western mural, the eastern mural portrays the Dragon King. The hall contains nine statues, all dating from a more recent period than the hall.|$|E
5|$|The Peasant Wedding (1567) and The Peasant Dance (1569) {{are also}} by Bruegel which {{share the same}} wedding theme and {{elements}} and were <b>painted</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same period in Bruegel's later years. They {{are considered to be}} a trilogy of works by Bruegel. In all three of the paintings, there are pipers playing the pijpzak (bagpipes), they also exude pride and vanity, for example in The Peasant Dance the man seated next to the pijpzak player is wearing a peacock feather in his hat.|$|E
5|$|The Tlaxcalan {{allies of}} the Spanish who {{accompanied}} them in their invasion of Guatemala wrote their own accounts of the conquest; these included {{a letter to the}} Spanish king protesting at their poor treatment once the campaign was over. Other accounts were in the form of questionnaires answered before colonial magistrates to protest and register a claim for recompense. Two pictorial accounts <b>painted</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> stylised indigenous pictographic tradition have survived; these are the Lienzo de Quauhquechollan, which was probably painted in Ciudad Vieja in the 1530s, and the Lienzo de Tlaxcala, painted in Tlaxcala.|$|E

5|$|The college boathouse, {{which is}} {{shared with the}} boat club of Keble College, is in Christ Church Meadow, on the Isis (as the River Thames is called in Oxford). It dates from 1964 and {{replaced}} a moored barge used by spectators and crew-members. The last college barge had been purchased {{from one of the}} Livery Companies of the City of London in 1911. It is now a floating restaurant further down the Thames at Richmond, and for some years was <b>painted</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> college colours of green and white.|$|E
5|$|The third version, {{composed}} after 1900, {{is part of}} {{a private}} collection. The fourth, <b>painted</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1920s, was in a private collection until World War II. After the war, it was confiscated by the communists. Following the death of Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito, it was put on display at Tito's mausoleum, the House of Flowers. It is currently on display at the Museum of Yugoslav History, and catalogued under the inventory code 59 R.|$|E
5|$|When Phantoms {{were first}} {{delivered}} to interceptor squadrons, they {{remained in the}} grey-green camouflage colour scheme more associated with the strike and close air support missions they had undertaken. During the late 1970s, the RAF began experimenting with new colours for its air defence units, with 56 Squadron tasked with trialling proposed new schemes. In October 1978, a Phantom FGR.2 of 56 Squadron became {{the first to be}} <b>painted</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> new air superiority grey colour, combined with small, low visibility roundels and markings. However, although the roundel remained in low visibility colours, individual squadron markings eventually returned to more observable sizes and colours.|$|E

5|$|Angel {{finds that}} he cannot {{stop talking about}} his divorce when trying to meet new women at a bar. After he meets a woman {{recovering}} from her own divorce, he has to leave her {{to speak to a}} prostitute whom he sees across the room with a prosthetic hand and fingernails <b>painted</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same way as the Ice Truck Killer's first victim. Working on a hunch that the Ice Truck Killer is an acrotomophiliac, Angel decides to speak to Debra's boyfriend, Rudy Cooper, a prosthetics specialist and (unbeknownst to anyone else) the actual Ice Truck Killer. Rudy cooperates with the interview upon realizing that Angel does not know his identity. Later, Angel is stabbed in a parking lot by a masked man. Angel manages to elbow him in the face before two men scare the attacker off. Minutes later, Rudy - who had earlier fallen out with Debra due to secretly having dinner with Dexter - arrives with flowers. They kiss, but Rudy backs away complaining of a cut lip, suggesting that he was Angel's attacker.|$|E
5|$|Biblical {{scenes and}} figures {{depicted}} in the Church of the Holy Mother of God include the worshiping of the Christ child as the eucharistic victim (the Melismos) in {{the lower part of}} the apse, the raising of Lazarus, the Annunciation, Jesus' triumphal entry into Jerusalem, Judas Iscariot's betrayal of Jesus, the Passion of the Christ in the upper part of the cella, the Descent from the Cross, the mourning of Jesus, and the Dormition of the Theotokos on the west wall. The north and south walls of the cella, as well as the wall piers, bear frescoes of saints, including rare images of military saints on horseback. Murals of Saint Petka and Saint Nicholas were <b>painted</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> upper reaches of the narthex, in the south and the north tower respectively.|$|E
5|$|For the {{extension}} to Queen's Park, the LER supplemented the {{existing rolling stock}} with 14 new carriages ordered from Brush Traction and Leeds Forge Company plus spare Gate stock carriages from the GNP These carriages, the 1914 stock, {{were the first to}} have doors in the sides of the carriages as well as the ends. For the longer extension to Watford, the LER and the LNWR ordered 72 new carriages from the Metropolitan Railway Carriage and Wagon Company. Manufacture of this rolling stock was delayed by the war, and, while it was waiting for delivery, the Bakerloo Tube used spare 1915 stock carriages ordered for an unfinished extension of the CLR to Ealing Broadway and more spare Gate stock carriages from the GNP Delivery of the carriages for the Watford service, known as the Watford Joint stock because ownership was shared with the LNWR, began in 1920; they were <b>painted</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> LNWR's livery to distinguish them from trains operating only on the Bakerloo Tube's tracks.|$|E

5|$|In 1938 {{the second}} five {{locomotives}} of the class, Nos. 6225–6229 (named after Duchesses) were also built in streamlined form {{at an average}} cost of £11,323 each. They were <b>painted</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same shade of crimson lake which had already been applied to the Princess Royal class; the same style of horizontal lining {{that had been a}} feature of the first five locomotives was continued, but in gilt. Although the crimson lake matched the standard LMS rolling stock, there was no attempt to apply the gilt lining along the sides of these coaches. A prototype trainset was built with such lining for exhibition in America, but it was never put into service due to the outbreak of the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|Nevinson, {{alongside}} Edward Elgar and H.G. Wells represented British {{culture at}} the celebrations of {{the first anniversary of}} the Republic of Czechoslovakia in Prague in 1919. Nevinson first visited New York in May 1919 and spent a month there while his World War One prints were being shown, to great acclaim, at the Frederick Keppel & Co gallery. A second exhibition at the same venue in October 1920 was poorly received. This led to Nevinson becoming disillusioned with New York, to the extent he changed the name of his painting New York-an abstraction to The Soul of the Soulless City. Nevinson claimed to have been the first artist to depict New York in a modernist style but in fact several British avant-garde artists had <b>painted</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city before World War One. In May 1919, while Nevinson was in America, Kathleen Nevinson gave birth to a baby son, but the child died shortly later and before his father could return to Britain.|$|E
5|$|Ngoia Pollard {{began her}} {{contemporary}} artistic career by assisting her husband, who painted with Papunya Tula artists {{for several years}} prior to his death. In 1997, Ngoia Pollard began painting independently, and in 2004 won the first prize in a central Australian painting competition supported by the region's major newspaper, the Centralian Advocate. In 2006, Ngoia Pollard won the painting prize in the National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Awards, with her work Swamps west of Nyirripi. Another of her works <b>painted</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same year, and carrying the same title, was acquired by the Art Gallery of South Australia. 2006 was also marked by an artist's residency in Copenhagen, shared with fellow Indigenous artist Lilly Kelly Napangardi, whom she had known since they attended school together in the 1960s.|$|E
