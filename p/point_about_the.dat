Throughout the beginning, she helps make the campaign's focal <b>point</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> fear of the terrorist Islamic Caliphate Organization (ICO, a fictionalized version of ISIS/ISIL) {{and how they can}} stop the threat.|$|E
25|$|Much {{the same}} <b>point</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> catastrophic effect of {{sexuality}} {{was made by}} Gregorio Leti's political pamphlet, The amours of Messalina, late queen of Albion, in which are briefly couch'd secrets of the imposture of the Cambrion prince, the Gothick league, and other court intrigues of the four last years reign, not yet made publick (1689). This was yet another satire on a Stuart Queen, Mary of Modena in this case, camouflaged behind the character of Messalina.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} issue of Huxley's Natural History Review, an article by George Rolleston on the {{orangutan}} brain showed the features that Owen claimed apes lacked, and when Owen responded {{in a letter to}} the Annals and Magazine of Natural History that the issue was a matter of definition rather than fact, Huxley made a public dissection of a spider monkey that had died at the zoo, to support his case. In the following issue John Marshall provided detailed measurements making the same <b>point</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> chimpanzee, as well as explaining how a chimpanzee's brain could be distorted by not being properly preserved and removed from the skull, so that it would look like the one in Owen's illustration.|$|E

500|$|In {{the decade}} between the {{publication}} of Uncle Tom's Cabin {{and the start of}} the American Civil War, between twenty and thirty anti-Tom books were published. Among these novels are two books titled Uncle Tom's Cabin As It Is (one by W. L. Smith and the other by C. H. Wiley) and a book by John Pendleton Kennedy. More than half of these anti-Tom books were written by white women, with Simms commenting at one <b>point</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> [...] "Seemingly poetic justice of having the Northern woman (Stowe) answered by a Southern woman." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{words to}} [...] "Where Is Home?" [...] {{begin at the}} funeral of Christopher Alaneme, a black {{teenager}} stabbed to death in Kent in April 2006 in a racially motivated attack. Okereke has described him as a [...] "cousin" [...] due to their Nigerian mothers' close friendship. The track castigates right-wing newspapers for perpetuating a hysterical fear of black youths in hoodies, an action which often leads to opportunities being denied to the Black British community at large. Populist media is also the target of [...] "Hunting for Witches" [...] (with the right-wing tabloid Daily Mail being singled out for criticism), whose subject matter is terrorism, namely the 7 July 2005 London bombings. Okereke has stated, [...] "I guess the <b>point</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> song for me is post-September 11th, the media has really traded on fear {{and the use of}} fear in controlling people." ...|$|E
500|$|The Tagora´s {{handling}} {{was deemed}} [...] "on the good side", wrote Autocar, and performance {{was described as}} [...] "good but not outstanding". As such the car lay [...] "uneasily close to being listed as under-engined" [...] though the authors conceded that generally the Tagora did not feel under-engined when in use. LJK Setright dissented saying the Tagora was as [...] "refined in its ride as should be expected of it" [...] and that [...] "the car also has {{a good deal more}} road-holding and cornering than might be expected". However, in December 1981 Car magazine judged the car (2.2 GLS model) to be prone to [...] "untidy" [...] handling, tending to under-steer first followed by excessive over-steer. The magazine made a particular note of the advantage in handling and grip enjoyed by the older live-axled Volvo 244, underlining the <b>point</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Tagora's lack of advantage in terms of road manners.|$|E

500|$|But his {{philological}} concerns {{now were}} {{only a small part}} of a much larger project to make sense of the nature of the Greek culture itself. His work in this period shows a theoretical sophistication far beyond his earlier efforts, extending his theory of literacy toward a theory of culture itself. He said of the Dipylon inscription, a poetic line scratched into a vase and the earliest Greek writing known at the time, [...] "Here in this casual act by an unknown hand there is announced a revolution which was destined to change the nature of human culture." [...] It is this larger <b>point</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> differences between oral and literate culture that represents Havelock's most influential contribution. Walter J. Ong, for example, in assessing the significance of non-oral communication in an oral culture, cites Havelock's observation that scientific categories, which are necessary not only for the natural sciences but also for historical and philosophical analysis, depend on writing. These ideas were sketched out in Preface to Plato but became central to Havelock's work from Prologue to Greek Literacy (1971) onward.|$|E
500|$|In A Room of One's Own, Virginia Woolf {{created a}} character, [...] "Judith Shakespeare", {{although}} she {{is supposed to be}} Shakespeare's sister rather than his daughter. Besides the similar names and setting, there is no other direct connection between Judith, Shakespeare's daughter, and Woolf's creation, and in fact Shakespeare's sister was named Joan. In Woolf's story Shakespeare's sister is denied the education of her brother despite her obvious talent. When her father tries to marry her off, she runs away to join a theatre company but is ultimately rejected because of her gender. She becomes pregnant, is abandoned by her partner, and commits suicide. Woolf's Judith was created in an attempt to fill a historical gap. Woolf intended to make a <b>point</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> struggle that a female poet and playwright would have had in the Elizabethan age. Woolf speculated as to why there were so few talented women from that time. [...] "What I find deplorable," [...] she observed, [...] "is that nothing is known about women before the eighteenth century." ...|$|E
500|$|Douglas Murray of The Daily Telegraph {{said of the}} episode, [...] "I can't {{recommend}} it enough", and particularly complimented the episode scenes with Buddha snorting cocaine and the South Park townspeople hiding Muhammad. Murray said, [...] "They make the <b>point</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> absurd self-censorship and thuggish intimidation surrounding the Islamic faith better than anything else I've seen." [...] Amy Duncan of Metro said it [...] "certainly was an episode to remember". Duncan praised the story, which she said [...] "develops with [...] usual rude inferences and below-the-belt remarks". Ryan Broderick of The Hofstra Chronicle said the episode [...] "came together so simply, so smoothly, and so hilariously that it forgives the last couple lame duck episodes of the season". Broderick said it avoided the pitfalls of most landmark episodes by providing an original story {{in addition to the}} throwback references. Nick Zaino of TV Squad said the episode did not offer much new, but also offer good throwbacks and celebrity spoofs, and didn't [...] "pull any punches". Zaino said the episode has [...] "a wonderful sense of the absurd", particularly through the use of Mecha-Streisand and Cartman's hand-puppet.|$|E

500|$|Carlos Delgado of iF Magazine {{pointed out}} that {{although}} the episode mocked drug addicts and handicapped children, it did not face the kind of censorship [...] "200" [...] and [...] "201" [...] did, which he suggested proved that censorship was born of fear rather than ethics. Delgado also said the comparison of handicapped children to Looney Tunes characters [...] "should remind us all that such cruel portrayals of disabled people {{have been going on}} for years". Others criticized the episode. MTV writer Adam Rosenberg thought the episode [...] "just wasn't very funny", and said it missed an opportunity to continue the creative edginess demonstrated in [...] "200" [...] and [...] "201". Rosenberg found the jokes about handicapped children [...] "pointlessly mean", and said {{the fact that they are}} allowed where depictions of Muhammad are censored [...] "makes a <b>point</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> absurdity of what is and isn't TV-acceptable". The television website TV Fanatic praised the Towelie storyline and the use of his son [...] "Washcloth", but said the jokes about the handicapped children were unfunny and irritating. The site called it [...] "by far the weakest of the season" [...] and a disappointment following [...] "200" [...] and [...] "201".|$|E
500|$|Mitsuda names his {{favorite}} works as the soundtracks to the Chrono series, Xenogears, Xenosaga Episode I, {{and the original}} album Kirite, though {{he also says that}} all of his soundtracks are [...] "representational works", as they represent who he was as a composer when he made them. His favorite pieces overall are [...] "The Girl Who Closed Her Heart" [...] and [...] "Pain" [...] from Xenosaga Episode I and pieces from Kirite. When he starts to compose a soundtrack, he first takes one month to gather information and artwork about the game world and scenario, so that his music will fit in with the game. He also finds it easier to be inspired if he has a visual representation. Mitsuda claims that he does not save his best work for more popular games, as he tries to compose each piece to correspond to how {{it is going to be}} used in a specific game. He also tries to compose good pieces even for games he feels do not live up to them, so that they will be a redeeming <b>point</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> game for the players. The majority of his video game soundtracks are for role-playing games, but he likes projects that are different from what he has done before and is interested in working in other genres.|$|E

2500|$|A day later, Stone stated: [...] "In {{trying to}} make a broader {{historical}} <b>point</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> range of atrocities the Germans committed against many people, I made a clumsy association about the Holocaust, for which I am sorry and I regret. Jews obviously do not control media or any other industry. The fact that the Holocaust is still a very important, vivid and current matter today is, in fact, a great credit to the very hard work of a broad coalition of people committed to the remembrance of this atrocity—and it was an atrocity." ...|$|E

2500|$|In response, Ridley {{rejected}} Hooper's {{insistence on}} biblical origins and countered Hooper's interpretations of his chosen biblical texts. He {{points out that}} many non-controversial practices are not mentioned or implied in scripture. Ridley denies that early church practices are normative for the present situation, and he links such primitivist arguments with the Anabaptists. Joking that Hooper's reference to Christ's nakedness on the cross is as insignificant as the clothing King Herod put Christ in and [...] "a jolly argument" [...] for the Adamites, Ridley does not dispute Hooper's main typological argument, but neither does he accept that vestments are necessarily or exclusively identified with Israel and the Roman church.

He went on to explain that other members of Slipknot are obsessed with metal and that he [...] "went with it" [...] because it was different for him and he could introduce them to something different. He describes Dirty Little Rabbits as the band he's been waiting his whole life for.

2500|$|The most {{important}} <b>point</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Act {{is that there}} is some confusion about whom it covers. Most British people will be covered, but often vulnerable workers are not. Under section 230 of the Act the word [...] "employee" [...] is defined to mean somebody with a [...] "contract of employment". This in turn means someone who has a [...] "contract of service". In legal cases since the early 1980s, some judges have placed a restrictive interpretation on what that means. The opposite of a [...] "contract of service" [...] is a [...] "contract for services", and it is meant to draw the line between someone who is working for another, on their account, under their control and someone who is working on their own account, controlling their own work. In other words, it is meant to be the difference between the truly [...] "employed" [...] and the [...] "self employed".|$|E
