50|$|Since the {{development}} of very sensitive magnetic sensors (SQUID, GMR, atomic magnetometer) it has become possible (in the 2000s) to detect NMR signals directly in zero-field environments. Previous zero-field NMR experiments relied on indirect detection where the sample had to be shuttled from the shielded zero-field environment into a high magnetic field for detection with a conventional inductive <b>pick-up</b> <b>coil.</b>|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} measure magnetizations in pulsed-fields, an {{inductive}} method using a <b>pick-up</b> <b>coil</b> {{located in a}} pulse magnet is generally employed. To measure the rapid magnetic flux change of a sample in a strong pulsed-field, {{it is necessary to}} construct a <b>pick-up</b> <b>coil</b> system that is compensated, usually in the accuracy of < 10 − 5. A number of techniques have been proposed to achieve this requirement (e.g., Grössinger 1982; Grössinger et al. 1993; Dudding et al. 2006). We employed in this study the configuration by Kodama (2015) using a coaxial <b>pick-up</b> <b>coil</b> pair located in the sample cavity of a commercial pulse magnet (ASC IM 10 - 30 impulse magnetizer).|$|E
40|$|Recently, {{a sensor}} {{structure}} consisting of magnetic wires attached {{directly to a}} rotating shaft, a <b>pick-up</b> <b>coil,</b> {{and a pair of}} magnets separately located outside the rotor was proposed. This paper presents a structure whose excitation source is just a single magnet. This structure decreases the cost of the previous sensor while retaining its advantages. For example, multiple output signals can be obtained per turn of the shaft by simply adding a corresponding number of wires, without requiring more pick-up coils and magnet pairs. In this study, the dependence of the output voltage on the <b>pick-up</b> <b>coil</b> was measured and the domain wall structure was elucidated by the measurement result...|$|E

An integrated sensor response can then be constructed for cross-sectional area corresponding to measured samples such as the u-channels. The new tool and procedure provide an effective approach in improving the efficiency and accuracy of sensor response curve estimates.|$|R

40|$|Low {{temperature}} superconducting quantum interference devices (LTS SQUIDs) {{are used}} to make precision measurements of electromagnetic fields in applications ranging from biomedicine to high energy physics. We have previously described an LTS SQUID-based device for nuclear physics which employs the Cryogenic Current Comparator principle (CCC). The CCC consists of a high-performance LTS DC SQUID system, a toroidal <b>pick-up</b> <b>coil,</b> and a meander-shaped superconducting niobium shield. Theoretical investigations show that as external noise decreases, improvements in performance depend on {{the properties of the}} ferromagnetic core material embedded in the <b>pick-up</b> <b>coil.</b> Here we present the temperature- and frequency-dependence of several candidate ferromagnetic and nanocrystalline materials. We discuss these results in light of the optimization of the CCC sensor performance...|$|E
30|$|The key to {{constructing}} the <b>pick-up</b> <b>coil</b> {{system is to}} achieve the accurate compensation of the two oppositely wound coils. It is expected that {{a larger number of}} coil windings would result in higher sensitivity. However, as discussed by Kodama (2015), the stray capacitance and the impedance of the pick-up coils increase with an increasing number of coil windings. This leads to a high-frequency resonance of the <b>pick-up</b> <b>coil</b> for the short interval (< 1  ms) of {{the rise and fall of}} a pulse. The resonance is stronger with higher pulsed fields, resulting in the lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This problem was already pointed out by Likhite et al. (1985) who was forced to limit the pulse peak < 0.6  T due to the imbalance of <b>pick-up</b> <b>coil</b> caused by “ringing” of the coil system. In the same way, because a slight failure of the coil compensation contributes to greater reduction of the SNR, we found that the maximum peak of a pulse was set to 0.7  T in this study. In addition, the measurement without a sample was performed for each run, and this background signal was subtracted from the signal with the sample.|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{describes}} {{the effect of}} magnetic <b>pick-up</b> <b>coil</b> transfer functions on mode number analysis in magnetically confined fusion plasmas. Magnetic probes mounted inside the vacuum chamber are widely used to characterize the mode structure of magnetohydrodynamic modes, as, due to their relative simplicity and compact nature, several coils can be distributed over the vessel. Phase differences between the transfer functions of different magnetic pick-up coils lead to systematic errors in time- and frequency resolved mode number analysis. This paper presents the first in-situ, end-to-end calibration of a magnetic <b>pick-up</b> <b>coil</b> system which {{was carried out by}} using an in-vessel driving coil on ASDEX Upgrade. The effect of the phase differences in the <b>pick-up</b> <b>coil</b> transfer functions is most significant in the 50 - 250 kHz frequency range, where the relative phase shift between the different probes can be up to 1 radian (60). By applying a correction based on the transfer functions we found smaller residuals of mode number fitting in the considered discharges. In most cases an order of magnitude improvement was observed in the residuals of the mode number fits, which could open the way to investigate weaker electromagnetic oscillations with even high mode numbers...|$|E
30|$|These {{differences}} in the sensor responses could be caused by different designs between SRMs at KCC (cooled with liquid helium) and OSU (cooled with pulse tube). For instance, the KCC SRM <b>pick-up</b> <b>coils</b> may have narrower widths along the SRM track. Jackson et al. (2010) noted that the geometry of the superconducting shield in the “dry” SRM (cooled with pulse tube) {{is different from that}} in the conventional liquid He-cooled SRM, and the sensor response function is different accordingly. It is therefore critical to estimate the sensor response accurately for both types of SRM in order to successfully utilize the deconvolution. The narrow width of <b>pick-up</b> <b>coils</b> with narrow FWHM of KCC SRM sensor response is suitable for reconstruction of higher-resolution paleomagnetic signals with deconvolution.|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} {{prototype}} module of our extendible and robust multichannel SQUID magnetometer system. A multi-module arrangement {{can be implemented}} by using up to 7 modules. It is intended for high-precision measurements of biomagnetism and spin precession. Further demanding applications are magnetorelaxometry and ultra-low-field nuclear magnetic resonance (ULF NMR), where pulsed fields of up to 100 mT are typically applied. The system is operated inside the Berlin Magnetically Shielded Room and equipped with 18 magnetometers consisting of niobium (Nb) wire-wound <b>pick-up</b> <b>coils.</b> A total of 16 small <b>pick-up</b> <b>coils</b> with 17. 1 mm diameter form a regular grid with individual channels arranged to ensure system sensitivity covers all three orthogonal spatial directions. Two large hexagonal <b>pick-up</b> <b>coils</b> with an equivalent diameter of 74. 5 mm sensitive in z-direction surround the grid at two different heights and are suitable {{for the detection of}} deep sources. Each coil is connected to the input of a thin-film Nb SQUID current sensor via a detachable superconducting contact. The SQUIDs are equipped with integrated input current limiters. Feedback into the <b>pick-up</b> <b>coils</b> minimizes crosstalk between channels. The current sensor chip package includes a superconducting shield of Nb. The field distortion of the prototype and a multi-module arrangement was analysed by numerical simulation. The measured noise of the small magnetometers was between 0. 6 and 1. 5 fT/Hz$^{ 1 / 2 }$, and well below 1 fT/Hz$^{ 1 / 2 }$ for the large ones. Using a software gradiometer, we achieved a minimum noise level of 0. 54 fT/Hz$^{ 1 / 2 }$. We performed ULF NMR experiments, verifying the system's robustness against pulsed fields, and magnetoencephalographgy (MEG) on somatosensory evoked neuronal activity. The low noise performance of our 18 -channel prototype enabled the detection of high-frequency components at around 1 kHz by MEG. Comment: 11 pages, 10 figure...|$|R

40|$|The off-diagonal magneto-impedance in Co-based {{amorphous}} ribbons {{was measured}} using a <b>pick-up</b> <b>coil</b> wound around the sample. The ribbons were annealed in air or in vacuum {{in the presence of}} a weak magnetic field. The evolution of the first and second harmonics in the <b>pick-up</b> <b>coil</b> voltage as a function of the current amplitude was studied. At low current amplitudes, the first harmonic dominates in the frequency spectrum of the voltage, and at sufficiently high current amplitudes, the amplitude of the second harmonic becomes higher than that of the first harmonic. For air-annealed ribbons, the asymmetric two-peak behaviour of the field dependences of the harmonic amplitudes was observed, which is related to the coupling between the amorphous phase and surface crystalline layers appearing after annealing. For vacuum-annealed samples, the first harmonic has a maximum at zero external field, and the field dependence of the second harmonic exhibits symmetric two-peak behaviour. The experimental results are interpreted in terms of a quasi-static rotational model. It is shown that the appearance of the second harmonic in the <b>pick-up</b> <b>coil</b> voltage is related to the anti-symmetrical distribution of the transverse field induced by the current. The calculated dependences are in a qualitative agreement with the experimental data. Comment: 16 pages, 4 figure...|$|E
