40|$|Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) is a {{designation}} {{given to}} materials of the polyaryletherketone family having a characteristic distribution of ether and ketone {{groups in the}} polymer backbone. <b>PEEK</b> <b>materials</b> have high strength and chemical resistance as well as very high melting points and glass transition temperatures. Because of this combination of properties, <b>PEEK</b> <b>materials</b> find use for wear application in extreme environments where they provide a light-weight and corrosion resistant bearing material that often does not require lubrication. An initial study focused on determining the effects of supplier and molecular weight on the wear of particular <b>PEEK</b> <b>materials,</b> {{in addition to the}} effect of contact pressure. This work is significant because it highlights the fact that tribologically relevant polymers, such as <b>PEEK</b> <b>materials,</b> vary greatly in terms of their polymer morphology and processing history, and this variation must be recognized by investigators when reporting wear data. Because of their light weight, chemical resistance, and self-lubricating properties, polymers are used in applications ranging from biomedical to aerospace. Some polymers exhibit significant differences in wear resistance based on whether they are in unidirectional or multidirectional sliding. Shear induced polymer chain orientation is believed to be responsible for this behavior. Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) has excellent wear resistance, but its multidirectional sliding behavior has not been thoroughly investigated. A factorial multidirectional pin-on-plate wear study of PEEK was conducted with a focus on molecular weight and sliding path directionality. These factors were studied for their correlation to overall wear performance. Additionally, transfer film thickness was measured at locations along the wear path using white light interferometry. A result of this work has been a greater understanding of PEEK wear mechanisms in various sliding configurations and how they relate to transfer film formation. A major outcome was the development of a quantitative metric to describe transfer film thickness and continuity. It was found that thinner more continuous transfer films form under sliding conditions that change direction rather than overlapping along the same path. The thinner more continuous transfer film was found to also correspond with statistically lower wear behavior. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) investigation of the transfer film and pin wear surface confirmed the relationship between transfer film quality and wear...|$|R
40|$|Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) is a polymer with {{outstanding}} performance, particularly concerning temperature resistance, {{chemical resistance}} and mechanical characteristics. Literature shows {{a gap in}} the knowledge with regards to PEEK flammability and decomposition products. The aim of this thesis is to describe the decomposition and flammability behaviour of PEEK, in order to develop new fire safe PEEK-based materials. By relating the measured thermal decomposition behaviour and changes in physical properties of <b>PEEK</b> <b>materials</b> to their performance in standard flammability tests, the dependence of these tests has been investigated with regards to orientation, thickness, presence of fillers, moisture absorption and absorption of infrared radiation. This understanding can inform the development of modified <b>PEEK</b> <b>materials</b> with enhanced fire safety. Various industry standard tests have been utilised to examine PEEK such as the Cone Calorimeter (ISO 5660), UL- 94 (EN 60695 - 10 - 11), Limiting Oxygen Index (LOI), Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) in both air and inert atmospheres and the Small Flame Ignitability Test (ISO 11925). PEEK decomposition has been investigated using Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA), Simultaneous Thermal Analysis coupled with Fourier Transform Infrared (STA-FTIR) and Pyrolysis Gas Chromatography coupled with Mass Spectrometry (pyGC/MS). Residue analysis has been carried out using Diamond Attenuated Total Reflectance coupled with Fourier Transform Infrared (dATR-FTIR), Solid State Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (MAS-NMR) and Scanning Electron Microscopy coupled with Electron Dispersive X-ray Analysis (SEM-EDX). Thermal analysis shows a rapid mass loss around 580 °C followed by a slower mass loss of the resultant char. The stages of decomposition have been investigated by using FTIR and NMR on the condensed phase residues. Samples subjected to various temperature regimes have been observed in the dATR-FTIR and MAS-NMR and the results shows differences in the structures of the residue during decomposition. Generally, filled <b>PEEK</b> <b>materials</b> (with glass fibre, carbon fibre and talc) tend to have lower flammability in the Cone Calorimeter with a longer time to ignition and a lower peak heat release rate compared to the unfilled materials. The same is true in the LOI, where filled materials give a higher oxygen index, and in the UL- 94 test where shorter burn times are recorded. PEEK shows inconsistent behaviour in some flammability tests, possibly due to the critical heat flux for ignition of PEEK being so close to the heat fluxes employed in many industry standard tests. The presence of moisture within the samples also reduces the time to ignition of PEEK in the Cone Calorimeter and increases the burning time in the UL- 94, possibly due to the formation of a foamed sample close to the melting temperature of the polymer...|$|R

In this paper a shear characterisation method for uni-directionally (UD) reinforced thermoplastics in their molten configuration is presented. Bar-like specimens made from UD carbon <b>PEEK</b> <b>material</b> are subjected to oscillating torsional loads. By utilising linear visco-elastic theory, the small strain oscillatory responses are translated to storage and loss shear moduli. The frequency dependent moduli are subsequently translated to the transient domain and show a close-to elastic response for the considered instantaneous strain rates. The application of such characterisation data is demonstrated by modelling the stamp forming process of a complex shaped product with the aid of the finite element method. The process considered deals with an initially flat quasi-isotropic laminate consisting of eight plies, which is formed at high temperatures. Predicted intra-ply shear strains are compared with those measured by photogrammetry in a real formed part.

The coatings were benefited from the antimicrobial activity of silver ion, the biocompatibility of titanium dioxide, and the flexibility of the polymer.

This material is presented as an alternative to current commercial ion exchange membranes that have been primarily designed for fuel cell applications. To increase the hydrophilicity and ion transport of the <b>PEEK</b> <b>material,</b> charged groups are introduced through sulfonation. The effect of sulfonation and casting conditions on membrane performance has been systematically determined by producing a series of membranes synthesized over an array of reaction and casting conditions. Optimal reaction and casting conditions for producing SPEEK ion exchange membranes with appropriate performance characteristics have been established by this uniquely systematic experimental series. Membrane materials were characterized by ion exchange capacity, water uptake, swelling, potential difference and NMR analysis. Testing this extensive membranes series established that the most appropriate sulfonation conditions were 60 °C for 6 h. For mechanical stability and ease of handling, SPEEK membranes cast from solvent casting concentrations of 15 %– 25 % with a resulting thickness of 30 – 50 µm were also found to be most suitable from the series of tested casting conditions.

Metal rods are often {{fixed to the}} spine with screws or hooks, while fusion develops on the affected vertebrae. Fusion is determined by visual examination of radiographic images (X-ray), computed tomography (CT) scans or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), yet these inspection procedures are subjective methods of review.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare the fracture strength of implant-supported fixed partial dentures (FPDs) with excessive crown height, fabricated from three different materials. Materials and Methods: Two implants with corresponding abutments were mounted in a metal model that simulated mandibular second premolar and second molar. Thirty 3 -unit frameworks with supportive anatomical design were fabricated using zirconia, nickel-chromium alloy (Ni-Cr), and polyetheretherketone (PEEK) (n= 10). After veneering, the CHS was equal to 15 mm. Then; samples were axially loaded on the center of pontics until fracture in a universal testing machine at a crosshead speed of 0. 5 mm/minute. The failure load data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA and Games-Howell tests at significance level of 0. 05. Results: The mean failure loads for zirconia, Ni-Cr and PEEK restorations were 2086 ± 362 N, 5591 ± 1200 N and 1430 ± 262 N, respectively. There were significant differences in the mean failure loads of the three groups (P< 0. 001).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the marginal soft and hard tissue healing at titanium and Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) healing implant abutments over a 4 -month period. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In six Labrador dogs, all mandibular premolars and first molars were extracted. After 4  months of healing, flaps were elevated, and two implants were installed at {{each side of}} the mandible, one in the premolar and the other in the molar regions. Four different types of healing abutments were positioned on the top of each implant: (i) titanium (Ti); (ii) <b>PEEK</b> <b>material</b> bonded to a base made of titanium (Ti-P), randomly positioned in the premolar region; (iii) PEEK, pristine (P); and (iv) PEEK, roughened (P-R), randomly positioned in the molar region. The flaps were sutured to allow a non-submerged healing, and after 4  months, the animals were sacrificed and ground sections obtained for histological evaluation. RESULTS: A higher resorption of the buccal bone crest was observed at the PEEK bonded to a base made of titanium abutments (1. 0  ±  0. 3  mm) compared to those made of titanium (0. 3  ±  0. 4  mm). However, similar dimensions of the peri-implant mucosa and similar locations of the soft tissues in relation to the implant shoulder were observed. No statistically significant differences were seen in the outcomes when the pristine PEEK was compared with the roughened PEEK abutments. The mean apical extension of the junctional epithelium did not exceed the implant shoulder at any of the abutment types used.

As the demand for joint replacement grows, and the life expectancy of the population increases, the performance requirements of these implants also changes. New materials, to improve longevity and enhance performance have been explored including PEEK and CFR-PEEK. This study investigated whether CFR-PEEK and PEEK were appropriate materials for total joint replacement by examining wear performance in simple configuration studies articulating against cobalt chrome under a range of cross-shear and contact pressure conditions. Simple geometry pin on plate studies were conducted for one million cycles for each test condition, with the contact pressure and cross-shear conditions representing a range in which the material may need to operate in-vivo. The wear factor for PEEK was significantly higher than CFR-PEEK and conventional polyethylene under all test conditions. Both PEEK and CFR-PEEK wear were influenced by contact pressure, with the highest wear factors for both materials measured at the highest pressure conditions. PEEK appeared to have a cross-shear dependent wear response, but this was not observed for the CFR-PEEK material. This study has further characterised the wear performance of two materials that are gaining interest for total joint replacement. The wear performance of the <b>PEEK</b> <b>material</b> showed poorer wear performance compared to polyethylene when articulating with a metal counterface, but the performance of the CFR-PEEK material suggested it may provide a suitable alternative to polyethylene in some applications. The wear performance of CFR-PEEK was poorer than polyethylene when it was used as the plate, when there was translation of the contact zone over the surface of the CFR-PEEK plate.

Friction and wear testing A bespoke test rig, in line with aerospace standards, was developed to allow the investigation of composite materials. Testing was conducted at room and high temperatures. A full analysis {{of the impact of the}} selected bulk material, short fibres and fillers was completed. Key parameters such as coefficient of friction, wear and fatigue life were identified. Further testing using optical microscopy was completed to enhance the understanding of the wear process and to support the findings of the detailed friction and wear testing program. 3. Mechanical testing The mechanical performance of <b>PEEK</b> <b>materials</b> was investigated through experimental analysis and available data. Again the impact of differing ratios of fillers and short fibres was determined. In addition static testing was used to investigate instantaneous strain and creep of selected materials. 4. Development of PEEK blends A final testing programme of two identified blends was completed that aimed to optimise for wear, friction and mechanical performance. The materials selected ware successful in matching aspects of the established design criteria but further work on the blends needs to be completed. However one of the selected materials is being proposed for an in service aerospace application...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Polyetheretherketones (PEEK) {{has been}} widely used as {{biomaterial}} for trauma, orthopaedic and spinal implants. Component made from Polyetheretherketones generally required additional machining process for finishing {{which can be a}} problem especially to attain a good surface roughness and dimensional precision. This research attempts to optimize the machining and processing parameters (cutting speed, feed rate and depth of cut) for effectively machining Polyetheretherketones (<b>PEEK)</b> implant <b>material</b> using carbide cutting tools. Response Surface Methodology (RSM) technique was used to assess the effects of the parameters and their relations towards the surface roughness values. Based on the analysis results, the optimal machining parameters for the minimum surface roughness values were by using cutting speed of 5754 rpm, feed rate of 0. 026 mm/tooth and 5. 11 mm depth of cut (DOC) ...|$|R
40|$|To use {{graphite}} polyetheretherketone (<b>PEEK)</b> <b>material</b> on highly curved surfaces {{requires that}} the material be drapable and easily conformable to the surface. This paper presents the mechanical property characterization and impact resistance results for laminates made from two types of graphite/PEEK materials that will conform to a curved surface. These laminates were made from two different material forms. These forms are: (1) a fabric where each yarn is a co-mingled Celion G 30 - 500 3 K graphite fiber and PEEK thermoplastic fiber; and (2) an interleaved material of Celion G 30 - 500 3 K graphite fabric interleaved with PEEK thermoplastic film. The experimental results from the fabric laminates are compared with results for laminates made from AS 4 /PEEK unidirectional tape. The {{results indicate that the}} tension and compression moduli for quasi-isotropic and orthotropic laminates made from fabric materials are at least 79 percent of the modulus of equivalent laminates made from tape material. The strength of fabric material laminates is at least 80 percent of laminates made from tape material. The evaluation of fabric material for shear stiffness indicates that a tape material laminate could be replaced by a fabric material laminate and still maintain 89 percent of the shear stiffness of the tape material laminate. The notched quasi-isotropic compression panel failure strength is 42 to 46 percent of the unnotched quasi-isotropic laminate strength. Damage area after impact with 20 ft-lbs of impact energy is larger for the co-mingled panels than for the interleaved panels. The inerleaved panels have less damage than panels made from tape material. Residual compression strength of quasi-isotropic panels after impact of 20 ft-lbs of energy varies between 33 percent of the undamaged quasi-isotropic material strength for the tape material and 38 percent of the undamaged quasi-isotropic material strength for the co-mingled fabric material...|$|E
40|$|Total joint {{replacement}} is {{a successful}} surgical intervention {{for the treatment of}} the degeneration of many joints, particularly the hip and knee. As the demand for joint replacement grows, and the life expectancy of the population increases, the performance requirements of these implants also changes. New materials, to improve longevity and enhance performance have been explored including PEEK and CFR-PEEK. This study investigated whether CFR-PEEK and PEEK were appropriate materials for total joint replacement by examining wear performance in simple configuration studies articulating against cobalt chrome under a range of cross-shear and contact pressure conditions. Simple geometry pin on plate studies were conducted for one million cycles for each test condition, with the contact pressure and cross-shear conditions representing a range in which the material may need to operate in-vivo. The wear factor for PEEK was significantly higher than CFR-PEEK and conventional polyethylene under all test conditions. Both PEEK and CFR-PEEK wear were influenced by contact pressure, with the highest wear factors for both materials measured at the highest pressure conditions. PEEK appeared to have a cross-shear dependent wear response, but this was not observed for the CFR-PEEK material. This study has further characterised the wear performance of two materials that are gaining interest for total joint replacement. The wear performance of the <b>PEEK</b> <b>material</b> showed poorer wear performance compared to polyethylene when articulating with a metal counterface, but the performance of the CFR-PEEK material suggested it may provide a suitable alternative to polyethylene in some applications. The wear performance of CFR PEEK was poorer than polyethylene when it was used as the plate, when there was translation of the contact zone over the surface of the CFR PEEK plate. This has implications for applications in low conforming contacts, such as lower conformity knee replacement...|$|E
40|$|Chronic {{back pain}} {{is one of}} the major causes of {{inability}} to work, early rehabilitation and premature retirement in the industrialized societies. This as a result of degenerative changes involving the lumbar spine in up to 60 % of the cases. Conservative measures are to be begun with. In case of failure of the conservative treatment and the presence of a correlation between the clinical signs and symptoms with the morphological imaging, the surgical treatment is to be considered. In the past decades, different surgical techniques and approaches have been developed using implants of various models and materials. The posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) is on of theses techniques with the aim of segmental fusion with intervertebral cage insertion to regain height and decompression of the nerve root by distraction. Additionally, the retention of lumbar lordosis and the prevention of the approach-induced instability are achieved by dorsal compression through supplemental dorsal transpedicular screw/rod instrumentation. For segmental spinal alignment and fusion, a polyetheretherketon (PEEK) implant model was chosen in our study to be inserted in the intervertebral space that could be distracted up to 6 °. 58 patients were included in our study. These patients underwent posterior lumbar interbody fusion using a distractable PEEK cage pairs and transpedicular dorsal instrumentation for degenerative disc diseases. The radiological and clinical outcome after 6 and 12 months was assessed. All the patients were treated in the department of neurosurgery- Charité at Campus Benjamin Franklin. 47 patients had a mono-segmental fusion and 11 a multi-segmental fusion. 73 cage pairs were implanted. The radiological outcome was assessed by conventional lumbar x-ray follow up after 6 and 12 months in anterior-posterior, lateral and functional view. The functional outcome was studied by using the VAS and Denis Pain Scale. The clinical functional follow up was documented using the JOA-Scale. The last showed a preoperative mean of 13, 5 points, 14, 1 points on discharge, 15, 3 points after 6 months and 15, 8 after 12 months. The rate of bony consolidated segments was 78 % after 12 months. After 12 months follow up a number of mono-segmental and multi-segmental fused levels showed incomplete bony fusion. On subsuming group III and IV to the “ group of functionally stable levels”, 82, 2 % of the treated levels could show segmental stability on the basis of the radiological and functional criteria as early as 6 months. After 12 months the stability rate increased up to 91, 8 %. This suggested that 8, 2 % of the treated segments showed neither functional stability nor fusion after 12 months of follow up. The segmental intervertebral height was measured before and after surgery. In so doing, an increase of the mean intervertebral height of 3. 3 mm was gained. In the cases were both the reconstruction of the intervertebral height and the retention of the lordosis angle is to be aimed, the using of the distractable cage is an alternative option. However, the aim to regain complete segmental alignment through the retention of the lordosis angel was limited by the fact that the distractable cage could only retain 4, 26 ° of the originally 6 ° distraction. This corresponds to two thirds of the manufacturer given value of distraction angle. The complete 6 ° can be only achieved by using dorsal compression through transpedicular screw/rod instrumentation. Hence, the distractable cage can be used as a stand-alone implant, but the size of the to be used implant has to corresponds to 130 % of the aimed lordosis angle in the intervertebral space. The posterior interbody fusion with cage and dorsal transpedicular instrumentation represents a successful surgical option after decompression of the neural structures for degenerative diseases of the lumbar spinal canal. The high biocompatibility of Polyetheretherketon (PEEK) acts as an excellent material to be used for manufacturing intervertebral cages. The above-mentioned result of posterior interbody fusion using distractable cages and dorsal instrumentation shows a satisfactory radiological outcome of fusion. The late onset of trabecular growth in the intervertebral space could be explained by the ingrowth’s manner of <b>PEEK</b> <b>material</b> in the course of distance osteogenesis. That should be the basic approach of further studies...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE To {{investigate}} the retention loads of differently fabricated secondary telescopic polyetheretherketone (PEEK) crowns on cobalt-chromium primary crowns with different tapers. MATERIALS AND METHODS Cobalt-chromium primary crowns with 0 °, 1 °, and 2 ° tapers were constructed, milled, and sintered. Corresponding secondary crowns were fabricated by milling, pressing from pellets, and pressing from granules. For these nine test groups, the pull-off tests of each crown combination were performed 20 times, and the retention loads were measured (Zwick 1445, 50 mm/min). Data {{were analyzed using}} linear regression, covariance analysis, mixed models, Kruskal-Wallis, and Mann-Whitney U-test, together with the Benferroni-Holm correction. RESULTS The mixed models covariance analysis reinforced stable retention load values (p = 0. 162) for each single test sequence. There was no interaction between the groups and the separation cycles (p = 0. 179). Milled secondary crowns with 0 ° showed the lowest mean retention load values compared to all tested groups (p = 0. 003) followed by those pressed form pellets with 1 °. Regarding the different tapers, no effect of manufacturing method on the results was observed within 1 ° and 2 ° groups (p = 0. 540; p = 0. 052); however, among the 0 ° groups, the milled ones showed significantly the lowest retention load values (p = 0. 002). Among the manufacturing methods, both pressed groups showed no impact of taper on the retention load values (p > 0. 324 and p > 0. 123, respectively), whereas among the milled secondary crowns, the 0 ° taper showed significantly lower retention load values than the 1 ° and 2 ° taper (p < 0. 002). CONCLUSION Based on these results, telescopic crowns made of PEEK seem to show stable retention load values for each test sequence; however, data with thermo-mechanical aging are still required. In addition, further developments in CAD/CAM manufacturing of <b>PEEK</b> <b>materials</b> for telescopic crowns are warranted, especially for 0 °...|$|R
40|$|Statement of Problem: Poly-ether-ether-ketone (PEEK), a {{high-performance}} semi-crystalline thermoplastic polymer, has been employed {{to replace the}} metallic implant components in orthopedics. There were various studies performed in accordance to medical grade PEEK, but the relationship between titanium dioxide (TiO 2) -coated PEEK, TiO 2 -blended PEEK, and untreated PEEK still remains complicated, even undefined. Purpose: The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare and quantify the osteogenic potential of untreated PEEK, TiO 2 -coated PEEK and TiO 2 -blended <b>PEEK.</b> <b>Materials</b> and Methods: Three groups with ten samples in each group were designed for this study. They were Group 1 - Untreated PEEK, Group 2 - TiO 2 -coated PEEK, Group 3 - TiO 2 -blended PEEK. The PEEK samples were prepared according to the ISO standard 15309 : 2013 and milled to size of 15 mm × 2 mm, and the surfaces were finished with grit-blasted alumina of size 20 μm. In this 10 samples were chosen for Group 1. Group 2 samples were prepared by coating TiO 2 nanoparticles by arc ion plating, and Group 3 samples were prepared by blending TiO 2 nanoparticles in HAAKE rheocord with degree of blending analyzed by torque rheometer. These samples were tested for cytotoxicity using human osteosarcoma cells, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity was performed to evaluate and quantify the bone mineralization process. The cross-sectional and the fracture morphology of coatings was observed by a field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM) with the magnification range × 20 –× 200, 000. Result: Results of cytotoxicity assay and ALP assay of Group 1, Group 2, and Group 3 were statistically analyzed. SEM analysis result clearly showed the difference in the matrix before and after cell adhesion. Conclusion: The results made it evident that n-TiO 2 -coated PEEK was more versatile biomaterial of choice in implant dentistry followed by n-TiO 2 -blended PEEK and untreated PEEK...|$|R
