25|$|The {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of Graves' disease virtually all result from the direct and indirect effects of hyperthyroidism, with main exceptions being Graves' ophthalmopathy, goiter, and pretibial myxedema (which are caused by the autoimmune processes of the disease). Symptoms of the resultant hyperthyroidism are mainly insomnia, hand tremor, hyperactivity, hair loss, excessive sweating, shaking hands, itching, heat intolerance, weight loss despite increased appetite, diarrhea, frequent defecation, palpitations, muscle weakness, and skin warmth and moistness. Further signs that may be seen on physical examination are most commonly a diffusely enlarged (usually symmetric), nontender thyroid, lid lag, excessive lacrimation due to Graves' ophthalmopathy, arrhythmias of the heart, such as sinus tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, and <b>premature</b> <b>ventricular</b> <b>contractions,</b> and hypertension. People with hyperthyroidism may experience behavioral and personality changes, including: psychosis, mania, anxiety, agitation, and depression.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} we present an {{algorithm}} to detect <b>premature</b> <b>ventricular</b> <b>contraction</b> beats (PVCs) which based on blood pressure measuring data technique. A PVC beat is chosen and {{compared with the}} number of heart beats per unit time (Heart rate) using Mat lab. The heart rate may be too fast or too slow. PVC beats are then detected using a decision parameter which is a discrete function of two unequal indices. One of the indices is linearly dependent on inter-beat duration time and the other is a total beat duration time of the <b>premature</b> <b>ventricular</b> <b>contraction</b> coefficient between blood pressure beat and the PVC beat. Potential of this proposed method was examined using Mat lab algorithm database. Results show high sensitivity of beat recognition...|$|R

50|$|Engel and Chism (1967) operantly trained {{subjects}} to decrease, increase, and then decrease their heart rates (this was analogous to ON-OFF-ON EEG training). He then used {{this approach to}} teach patients to control their rate of <b>premature</b> <b>ventricular</b> <b>contractions</b> (PVCs), where the ventricles contract too soon. Engel conceptualized this training protocol as illness onset training, since patients were taught to produce and then suppress a symptom. Peper has similarly taught asthmatics who wheeze to better control their breathing.|$|E

50|$|A <b>premature</b> <b>{{ventricular}}</b> <b>contraction</b> (PVC)—also {{known as}} a <b>premature</b> <b>ventricular</b> complex, <b>ventricular</b> <b>premature</b> <b>contraction</b> (or complex or complexes) (VPC), <b>ventricular</b> <b>premature</b> beat (VPB), or ventricular extrasystole (VES)—is a relatively common event where the heartbeat is initiated by Purkinje fibers in the ventricles {{rather than by the}} sinoatrial node, the normal heartbeat initiator. The electrical events of the heart detected by the electrocardiogram (ECG) allow a PVC to be easily distinguished from a normal heart beat. Although a PVC can be a sign of decreased oxygenation to the heart muscle, often PVCs are benign and may even be found in otherwise healthy hearts.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Premature</b> <b>ventricular</b> <b>contraction</b> causes early {{emptying}} of {{the left}} ventricle (LV) into the aorta. Since the next <b>ventricular</b> <b>contraction</b> occurs at its regular time, the filling time for the LV increases, causing an increased LV end-diastolic volume. Due to the Frank-Starling mechanism, the next <b>ventricular</b> <b>contraction</b> is more forceful, leading to the ejection of the larger than normal volume of blood, and bringing the LV end-systolic volume back to baseline.|$|R
