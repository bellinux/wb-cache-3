25|$|Stimuli {{that are}} {{directly}} attended to are projected onto the fovea, the central {{point of the}} retina that corresponds to the focal point in visual space. To the immediate left and right of the focal point is the portion of visual space attributed to binocular vision. The far left and right of one's visual space is attributed to the monocular vision of {{the left and right}} eyes. In sum, one's visual space covers roughly 200° from the periphery of the left eye to the periphery of the right eye. This large visual space in human beings is a result of a fully developed and functioning anatomical visual system. In the context of Plato's Problem, our visual system is an innate capacity that enables us to be aware of a considerable portion of our immediate environment which enhances our conscious experience by supplementing it with an extensive environmental awareness and predisposing us to extract meaningful <b>perceptual</b> <b>information.</b> In other words, it is our biologically produced visual system that makes our perceptual experiences meaningful.|$|E
2500|$|Agnosia is the {{inability}} to process sensory information. Often there is a loss of ability to recognize objects, persons, sounds, shapes, or smells while the specific sense is not defective {{nor is there any}} significant memory loss. It is usually associated with brain injury or neurological illness, particularly after damage to the occipitotemporal border, {{which is part of the}} ventral stream. [...] Agnosia only affects a single modality, such as vision or hearing. More recently, a top-down interruption is considered to cause the disturbance of handling <b>perceptual</b> <b>information.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Odor {{recognition}} {{is the most}} common and direct means used to measure odor memory. In an odor recognition test participants are asked whether or not they recognize an odor. [...] More specifically, a participant is subjected to a certain olfactory-related stimulus, and after a delay period is asked to decide if a probe (a stimulus that could or could not be the same as the initial stimulus) {{is the same as the}} one he/she initially encountered. Memory accuracy is assessed by the amount of correct recognition decisions that are made. A potential problem with this measure involves the generation of verbal labels that may enhance memory for olfactory stimuli. [...] There are various ways of measuring the effect of verbal labeling, which include comparison of odors and odor names, as well as the speed and accuracy with which lexical decisions are made regarding odor names. It has been suggested that odor recognition testing should be considered as a measure that involves both memory for <b>perceptual</b> <b>information</b> as well as potentially confounding memory due to the generation of verbal labels.|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study, the authors explore {{in detail the}} level of visual object {{recognition}} at which <b>perceptual</b> color <b>information</b> improves the recognition of color diagnostic and noncolor diagnostic objects. To address this issue, 3 object recognition tasks with different cognitive demands were designed: (a) an object verification task; (b) a category verification task; and (c) a name verification task. The authors found that <b>perceptual</b> color <b>information</b> improved color diagnostic object recognition mainly in tasks for which access to the semantic knowledge about the object was necessary to perform the task; that is, in category and name verification. In contrast, the authors found that <b>perceptual</b> color <b>information</b> facilitates noncolor diagnostic object recognition when access to the object's structural description from long-term memory was necessary—that is, object verification. In summary, the present study shows {{that the role of}} <b>perceptual</b> color <b>information</b> in object recognition is dependent on color diagnosticity...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{we propose}} an {{unsupervised}} image segmentation which integrates <b>perceptual</b> <b>informations</b> of regions in an image from colour and texture properties {{in order to}} perform image segmentation. This proposed segmentation algorithm {{is based on a}} active region model. To correctly take semantic object (region and boundary information) into account, a mixture of Gaussians is used to model pixels of the background image and those of the semantic object. The model minimizes a modified Chan–Vese functional over each component of the colour image, and improves appreciably the chan-vese algorithm and is fast and robust with respect to noise. The results for segmenting objects in an sequence of images are demonstrated...|$|R
50|$|Most model based {{strategies}} of motor control rely on <b>perceptual</b> <b>information,</b> but {{assume that this}} information is not always useful, veridical or constant. Optical information is interrupted by eye blinks, motion is obstructed by objects in the environment, distortions can change the appearance of object shape. Model based and representational control strategies are those that rely on accurate internal models of the environment, constructed {{from a combination of}} <b>perceptual</b> <b>information</b> and prior knowledge, as the primary source information for planning and executing actions, {{even in the absence of}} <b>perceptual</b> <b>information.</b>|$|E

The relative sensitivity assumption assumes that the [...] "sensitivity of a direct discrimination is {{greater than or equal to}} the sensitivity of a comparable indirect discrimination to conscious task relevant information." [...] In other words, Reingold and Merikle argued that it is impossible for indirect measures to provide a more comprehensive understanding of relevant <b>perceptual</b> <b>information</b> than for direct measures such as indirect discriminations are always less than or equally sensitive to relevant <b>perceptual</b> <b>information</b> to direct discriminations.|$|E

Further, the <b>perceptual</b> decision <b>information</b> was specifically coded in the prestimulus alpha oscillations and in the asymmetric distribution of oscillatory features between the two hemispheres.|$|R

50|$|Perceptual {{learning}} {{is often said}} to be implicit, such that learning occurs without awareness. It {{is not at all}} clear whether perceptual {{learning is}} always implicit.

50|$|Source {{confusion}} is an attribute seen in different people's {{accounts of the}} same event after hearing people speak about the situation. An example of this would be, a witness who heard a police officer say {{he had a gun}} and then that witness later says they saw the gun. Understanding the source of one's memories is important to memory processes necessary for every day living. Memories arise both from perceptual experiences and from one's thoughts, feelings, inferences, and imagination. Source monitoring theory postulates that memory errors occur when <b>perceptual</b> <b>information</b> is incorrectly attributed as being the source of a past experience. This may take place because one event shares the characteristics of another source. When a person has many sources of <b>perceptual</b> <b>information</b> about an event, their brain is easily able to evoke a memory of that event, even if they did not experience it, thus creating a misattributed memory.|$|E

40|$|Gender is {{important}} for the determination of olfactory abilities. Previous reports on gender differences in human odour perception claimed that the sensitivity and discrimination ability of females for odours is superior to that of males. Evolutionary theories, however, open up the possibility of an interesting dissociation between females and males in terms of odour processing: there is an advantage for women for the perceptual aspects of olfactory stimuli and an advantage for men when translating <b>perceptual</b> olfactory <b>information</b> into action. In line with this hypothesis our observations suggest that encoding odours has the ability to guide the movement of males but not that of females...|$|R

40|$|A {{fundamental}} question in neuroscience concerns how {{the human brain}} represents <b>perceptual</b> and conceptual <b>information.</b> Tradition-ally, researchers probed this issue by identifying single neurons that increased their firing rate when an animal encountered certain stimuli. Here we provide evidence of a complementary scheme in which gamma-band (25 – 128 Hz) electrocorticographic (ECoG) activity— a phenomenon involving large groups of neurons—encodes the active cognitive representation. We analyzed intracranial brain record-ings from neurosurgical patients while they studied lists of visually presented letters {{and found that the}} amplitude of gamma-band activity encoded the identity of the current letter. These letter-specific patterns occurred during periods of overall increased gamma amplitude and were linked to the phase of simultaneous theta (4 – 8 Hz) oscillations. In occipital cortex, these patterns sometimes reflected the shapeof the viewed letter, but, in other brain regions, this phenomenonwasnot related to letter form. Our findings show that gamma-band activity encodes a range of <b>perceptual</b> and conceptual <b>information,</b> suggesting that ECoG recordings can reveal neural correlates of specific human cognitive representations...|$|R

40|$|The naming {{difficulties}} of Broca’s and anemic aphasics were explored {{in relation to}} a recently developed model of the normal mental lexicon which stresses the importance of integrating <b>perceptual</b> and functional <b>information</b> in the act of nam-ing, and equally stresses the inherent vagueness of conceptual categories based on such information. Subjects were shown line drawings of various food containers varying in physical features such as height and width; they were required to select a name for the object from a multiple choice list (cup, bowl, or glass). Prototypical as well as nonprototypical objects were shown. The Broca’s aphasics showed relatively normal naming protiles. In contrast, the posterior patients were unable to integrate <b>perceptual</b> and functional <b>information</b> and were insensitive to the fuzzy boundaries between conceptual categories.

40|$|Visual {{information}} contributes fundamentally to {{the process}} of object categorization. The present study investigated whether the degree of activation of visual information in this process is dependent on the contextual relevance of this information. We used the Proactive Interference (PI-release) paradigm. In four experiments, we manipulated the information by which objects could be categorized and subsequently be retrieved from memory. The pattern of PI-release showed that if objects could be stored and retrieved both by (non-perceptual) semantic and (<b>perceptual)</b> shape <b>information,</b> then shape information was overruled by semantic information. If, however, semantic information could not be (satisfactorily) used to store and retrieve objects, then objects were stored in memory in terms of their shape.
