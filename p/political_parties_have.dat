5|$|During {{the campaigns}} of the June 2015 Turkish elections, Agar.io {{was used in}} Turkey as a medium of {{political}} advocacy; many players were naming their cells after Turkish political parties and references, with alliances formed between players with similar political views, battling against other players with opposing views. Some <b>political</b> <b>parties</b> <b>have</b> used Agar.io in campaign posters {{as a symbol of}} support.|$|E
5|$|Despite that, the {{government}} has stated that the issue might be addressed if France were to be offered something of equal value. The Council itself has indicated privately that it would discuss the Strasbourg seat only if Parliament gives them a signal to start a debate, as they would not do on their own initiative. However, few wish {{to discuss the issue}} while the current constitutional issues are still present. Although <b>political</b> <b>parties</b> <b>have</b> no formal position, the Greens, Liberals and Socialists are all outspoken on having Brussels as a permanent seat.|$|E

5|$|The {{divide between}} the Dutch-speaking north (Flanders) and the French-speaking South (Wallonia) has caused the {{parliamentary}} democracy to become ethnically polarized. Though {{an equal number of}} seats in the Chamber of Representatives are prescribed to the Flemish and Walloons, Belgian <b>political</b> <b>parties</b> <b>have</b> all divided into two ideologically identical but linguistically and ethnically different parties. The political crisis has grown so bad in recent years that the partition of Belgium has been feared.|$|E
5|$|Until the {{legalisation}} {{of opposition}} parties in 1992, Déby's MPS {{was the sole}} legal party in Chad. Since then, 78 registered <b>political</b> <b>parties</b> <b>have</b> become active. In 2005, opposition parties and human rights organisations supported the boycott of the constitutional referendum that allowed Déby to stand for re-election for a third term amid reports of widespread irregularities in voter registration and government censorship of independent media outlets during the campaign. Correspondents judged the 2006 presidential elections a mere formality, as the opposition deemed the polls a farce and boycotted them.|$|E
5|$|Seven <b>political</b> <b>parties</b> <b>have</b> been {{represented}} in the committee. The first committee consisted exclusively {{of members of the}} Liberal Party. The party was represented on all committees until 1973, after which it has not had a seat. In 1907, Francis Hagerup became the first representative from the Conservative Party, and this party has been represented on the board since. The Labour Party has been represented on the board since 1919, when Halvdan Koht became a member. The Agrarian Party (since named the Centre Party) was first represented on the board by Birger Braadland in 1938. The Christian Democratic Party was first represented by Erling Wikborg in 1965, the Socialist Left Party by Hanna Kvanmo in 1991 and the Progress Party by Inger-Marie Ytterhorn in 2000.|$|E

5|$|In 2008, Gorrostieta Salazar {{was elected}} mayor of Tiquicheo. Several drug {{trafficking}} organizations, particularly the La Familia Michoacana and the Knights Templar Cartel, {{are based in}} the area. Michoacán is a leading producer of marijuana and opium poppy, making it a lucrative route for smugglers taking narcotics into the United States. Despite receiving threats, Gorrostieta Salazar publicly denounced the activities of these groups. The drug cartels, which are constantly fighting each other for territorial control, often target mayors who confront them. Other mayors, however, are corrupted and bribed by the cartels. Mexico has more than 2,500 municipalities, {{many of which are}} far from the capital cities and lack amenities available {{in other parts of the}} country. Many of these areas are plagued with drug-related violence, so the <b>political</b> <b>parties</b> <b>have</b> faced difficulties finding people interested in holding the post of mayor.|$|E
