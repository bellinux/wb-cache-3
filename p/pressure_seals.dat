In 1968, William Bruggeman significantly reduced {{the size of}} the triplex pump and increased the lifespan so that car washes could use equipment with smaller footprints. Durable high <b>pressure</b> <b>seals,</b> low <b>pressure</b> <b>seals</b> and oil seals, hardened crankshafts, hardened connecting rods, thick ceramic plungers and heavier duty ball and roller bearings improve reliability in triplex pumps.

40|$|The rotordynamic forces {{generated}} by the fluid flow through the impeller leakage path of a centrifugal pump are now well established. The present paper examines the effects of modifying the leakage path geometry by changing the front shroud, from a conical shape to a more typical curved design, {{and the effects of}} low <b>pressure</b> <b>seal</b> design on these forces. It is found that only the cross-coupled stiffness is affected by the change of path geometry. Changing the low <b>pressure</b> <b>seal</b> from an axial to a radial clearance does, however, significantly affect the rotordynamic forces. A bulk flow numerical model is found to predict the same general result for the low <b>pressure</b> <b>seal</b> tests. The model agrees with the general trends with increasing leakage flow coefficient exhibited by the data, but appears to underpredict the magnitude of the normal force...|$|R

50|$|Another type of bonnet {{construction}} in a gate valve is <b>pressure</b> <b>seal</b> bonnet. This construction is adopted for valves for high pressure service, typically {{in excess of}} 2250 psi (15 MPa). The unique feature of the <b>pressure</b> <b>seal</b> bonnet is that the bonnet ends in a downward-facing cup which fits inside {{the body of the}} valve. As the internal pressure in the valve increases, the sides of the cup are forced outward. improving the body-bonnet seal. Other constructions where the seal is provided by external clamping pressure tend to create leaks in the body-bonnet joint.|$|R

50|$|Fan drives can be {{internal}} or external. Internal drives have the motor inside the autoclave in an unheated chamber.

Internal drives are simpler, result in slightly less floor space taken, and impose a small but essential cooling load; external drives require more elaborate drive shaft arrangements and use high <b>pressure</b> <b>seals.</b>|$|E

Then came electrical failures, caused by faulty Cannon plugs, which supplied connections throughout the ten miles (16 km) of wiring in each B-29.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Fluid dynamic {{potentials}} {{are critical}} to the entrapment, distribution, phase, leakage and migration of hydrocarbons. The classification system combines two cap rock proper t ies (static and dynamic) wi th five seal and leakage modes (capillary <b>seal,</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>seal,</b> hydraulic resistance seal, water drive leakage and hydraulic fracturing leakage) and two hydrocarbon migration mechanisms {{into and out of}} a trap (fill/spill and fill/leak). Static cap rocks, such as thick shales, usually seal more than the vertical closure of the trap, {{as a consequence of the}} critical po re throat capillary <b>pressure</b> (capillary <b>seal).</b> In two-phase hydrocarbon systems fill/spill tends to concent ra te gas. Hydraulic fracturing is usually required to generate significant leakage through static cap rocks. Then fill/leak tends to concentra te oil. Dynamic cap rocks, such as inhomogeneous sand/shale sequences and faults have less sealing capacity than the static cap rocks, but are more widespread. They are strongly affected by variations in the fluid dynamic propert ies and are less dependen t on capillary pressure. Water potentials are often critical, for <b>seal</b> (<b>pressure</b> <b>seal)</b> or for leakage and redistribution (water drive leakage). Hydraulic resistance seal is important for trapping of oil and crucial for concentrat ion of oil relative to gas (fill/leak) ...|$|R
