5|$|On May 22, 2008, Capcom {{announced}} the game, titled Tatsunoko vs. Capcom: Cross Generation of Heroes, for release in Japanese arcades. The arcade cabinets' system board was <b>proprietary</b> <b>hardware</b> {{based on the}} Wii. Beta units were sent to test locations in Tokyo (July 10–13) and Osaka (July 25–27). By September, the game was 70% complete, and a Wii version was announced for Japanese release. Capcom gradually revealed the game's cast until release. It was released in Japan on the Wii on December 11, 2008, and an arcade version followed in mid-December 2008.|$|E
5|$|The Image Computer never sold well. Inadequate sales {{threatened}} {{to put the}} company out of business as financial losses grew. Jobs invested more and more money in exchange for an increased stake in the company, reducing the proportion of management and employee ownership until eventually, his total investment of $50million gave him control of the entire company. In 1989, Lasseter's growing animation department, originally composed of just four people (Lasseter, Bill Reeves, Eben Ostby, and Sam Leffler), {{was turned into a}} division that produced computer-animated commercials for outside companies. In April 1990, Pixar sold its hardware division, including all <b>proprietary</b> <b>hardware</b> technology and imaging software, to Vicom Systems, and transferred 18 of Pixar's approximately 100 employees. That same year, Pixar moved from San Rafael to Richmond, California to Burbank, California. Pixar released some of its software tools on the open market for Macintosh and Windows systems. RenderMan was one of the leading 3D packages of the early 1990s, and Typestry was a special-purpose 3D text renderer that competed with RayDream addDepth.|$|E
25|$|Digital rights {{management}} (DRM) {{is a set}} {{of access}} control technologies for restricting the use of <b>proprietary</b> <b>hardware</b> and copyrighted works. DRM technologies try to control the use, modification, and distribution of copyrighted works (such as software and multimedia content), as well as systems within devices that enforce these policies.|$|E
50|$|Prime {{was divided}} into the two main divisions: Prime Hardware, which was {{responsible}} for the <b>proprietary</b> computer <b>hardware,</b> and Prime Computervision, which {{was responsible for the}} CAD/CAM business with MEDUSA and CADDS.|$|R
50|$|MAGIX Sequoia is {{a digital}} audio workstation. It {{is the most}} {{powerful}} of the MAGIX audio software family, essentially offering a superset of MAGIX Samplitude's functionality. Sequoia is purely software-based, making it independent of <b>proprietary</b> audio <b>hardware.</b>|$|R

25|$|Most of the {{machines}} {{in the early days}} of MS-DOS had differing system architectures and there was a certain degree of incompatibility, and subsequently vendor lock-in. Users who began using MS-DOS with their machines were compelled to continue using the version customized for their hardware, or face trying to get all of their <b>proprietary</b> <b>hardware</b> and software to work with the new system.|$|E
2500|$|The {{signalling}} {{technology used}} {{on all three}} SkyTrain lines to run trains automatically was originally developed by Alcatel, and loaded from a 3.5" [...] diskette. There are four systems called the VCC (Vehicle Control Computer) with three divided over the mainline {{and one for the}} storage yard. VCC1 controls trains from Waterfront to Royal Oak; VCC2 controls trains from Royal Oak to King George (it now also controls a portion of the Millennium line); and VCC3 controls trains in the yard. Each VCC is a cluster of three IBM rack-mount computers with Intel-IA32 processors and <b>proprietary</b> <b>hardware,</b> configured in a fault tolerant setup. For every command that is sent to a VCC, {{at least two of the}} computers must agree with the action, otherwise an error is generated and the command is ignored. The VCCs communicates with the train's VOBC (Vehicle On Board Computer), whose data is transmitted through leaky coax cable laid along the tracks. There are up to two VOBCs per married-pair trains, i.e., 4-car train would have two VOBCs. If the VCCs fail or communication between the VCC and the VOBC is lost, the train will 'time-out' and (EB) emergency-brake through a Quester Tangent BAM (Brake Assurance Monitor) that controls propulsion and braking systems. The VCCs have a command-line-console, but normally the trains are controlled through a system known as the SMC, which also provides scheduling. All commands from the SMC are verified to be safe by the VCC before execution. However if the SMC fails, the system can still be operated through the VCC. This is known as 'degraded mode'. The SkyTrain HMU (Health Monitoring Unit) developed by Quester Tangent [...] provides monitoring and diagnostic functionality for vehicle maintenance by connecting to CAN vehicle network and providing a maintenance display in the Hoslter Panel.|$|E

50|$|In 2000 SCO {{released}} the UnixWare 7.1.1 update. Simultaneously the UnixWare NonStop Clusters 7.1.1+IP single-system image cluster package was released. This new package allowed commodity hardware {{to be used}} as well as the <b>proprietary</b> Compaq <b>hardware</b> supported by the earlier Integrity XC product, and was directly available from SCO.|$|R
50|$|The XTS-300 transitioned from <b>proprietary,</b> mini-computer <b>hardware</b> to COTS, Intel x86 hardware. XTS-300 {{completed}} {{evaluation in}} 1994 at the B3 level. XTS-300 also went through several ratings maintenance cycles (a.k.a. RAMP), {{very similar to}} an assurance continuity cycle under CC, ultimately ending up with version 5.2.E being evaluated in 2000.|$|R

30|$|In this section, we {{introduce}} the work presented by Bhattacherjee in [29] to apply {{some of the}} known SSID and anti-evasion techniques to SDN which use network function virtualization (NFV). NFV is an initiative to virtualize network services traditionally run on <b>proprietary,</b> dedicated <b>hardware.</b> With NFV, functions like routing, load balancing, and firewalls are packaged as virtual machines (VMs) on commodity hardware.|$|R
50|$|The MiWi {{protocols}} {{are supported}} on certain Microchip PIC and dsPIC microcontrollers. When developing for these platforms, <b>proprietary</b> SDKs and <b>hardware</b> development tools, {{such as the}} ZENA wireless packet sniffer, may be used.|$|R
50|$|Later, a {{short run}} of semi-custom models (designated the JG series after {{the owner of}} one of the first models, John Gustafson) {{featured}} hand-tooled leather scratchplates. They introduced {{for the first time the}} distinctive eight coil humbucking pickups and <b>proprietary</b> bridge <b>hardware</b> which became a feature of all future Wal bass models. Owners of these models included John Entwistle, Paul Simonon, Gary Tibbs, Alan Spenner, and Percy Jones.|$|R

50|$|Prime {{was divided}} into the two main divisions: Prime Hardware, which was {{responsible}} for the <b>proprietary</b> computer <b>hardware,</b> and Prime Computervision, which {{was responsible for the}} CAD/CAM business with MEDUSA and CADDS. With falling hardware sales Prime eventually stopped production of PrimOS computers and transferred its maintenance obligations to another company, thus being able to concentrate on the CAD/CAM software business. The company was renamed from Prime Computervision to Computervision (CV).|$|R
50|$|OpenVMS {{supports}} clustering (first called VAXcluster {{and later}} VMScluster), where multiple systems share disk storage, processing, job queues and print queues, and are connected either by <b>proprietary</b> specialized <b>hardware</b> (Cluster Interconnect) or an industry-standard LAN (usually Ethernet). A LAN-based cluster {{is often called}} a LAVc, for Local Area Network VMScluster, and allows, among other things, bootstrapping a possibly diskless satellite node over the network using the system disk of a bootnode.|$|R
50|$|The second {{title in}} this series is The Journey To Wild Divine: Wisdom Quest. Wisdom Quest also {{utilizes}} the same <b>proprietary</b> Iom biofeedback <b>hardware.</b> It retains the same game format while building on the adventure game format.|$|R
5000|$|The WaveFrame, Fairlights, and Audiofile {{were of the}} [...] "integrated" [...] {{variety of}} DAW, and {{required}} the purchase of expensive <b>proprietary</b> <b>hardware</b> and specialized computers (not standard PCs or Macs). Of the two surviving systems, Pro Tools still requires some <b>proprietary</b> <b>hardware</b> (either a low cost portable device such as the [...] "Mbox" [...] or the more expensive multichannel A/D,D/A converters for more professional high end applications), while Nuendo (a successor to Cubase) is of the [...] "host based" [...] variety.|$|E
50|$|Unlike most {{electronic}} drum kits, the DrumIt Five kit {{comes with}} its own complete set of <b>proprietary</b> <b>hardware,</b> including mounting rack, hi-hat stand, and bass drum pedal.|$|E

2500|$|Imagination Technologies {{offers a}} free API called OpenRL which accelerates tail {{recursive}} ray tracing-based rendering algorithms and, {{together with their}} <b>proprietary</b> ray tracing <b>hardware,</b> works with Autodesk Maya to provide what 3D World calls [...] "real-time raytracing to the everyday artist".|$|R
5000|$|Plasma {{was picked}} up by demo coders for their demos where the effect was heavily used, {{especially}} in the early 1990s. The effect was particularly common on the Commodore Amiga where it could be implemented very efficiently by using the features of the <b>proprietary</b> display <b>hardware.</b> Plasma can also be implemented easily in software rendering by using [...] sinus tables and pseudocolor palettes, and it has also been the first true demo effect for many beginning PC democoders.|$|R
40|$|The {{analytical}} {{modeling and simulation}} of conservative electrostatic, electromagnetic and electrodynamic transducers found in microsystems using a non-linear lumped-parameter approach is presented in this paper. A comparison is made between this approach and the linearized equivalent circuit method All models of transducers are written in HDL-A(TM), a <b>proprietary</b> analogue <b>hardware</b> description language (HDL). System-level simulation is performed in the SPICE simulator using behavioral models of the transducers. Finally, a parameter extraction and HDL model generation tool for devices is presented...|$|R
50|$|In 1993, VERSYSS {{partnered with}} IBM to port their MMOS to the RS/6000 line of systems. At that point, almost all <b>proprietary</b> <b>hardware</b> {{requirements}} were dropped except the terminal firmware.|$|E
5000|$|In May 2016, Google {{unveiled}} its own <b>proprietary</b> <b>hardware</b> [...] "tensor processing units", {{which it}} stated {{had already been}} deployed in multiple internal projects at Google, including the AlphaGo match against Lee Sedol.|$|E
50|$|Traditionally, Quantel {{systems were}} based around <b>proprietary</b> <b>hardware</b> & software. With the {{introduction}} of the generationQ range a number of Quantel products were based on Microsoft Windows and standard PC hardware with occasional use of custom hardware.|$|E
50|$|The game ran on Sega's <b>proprietary</b> System 1 <b>hardware,</b> {{based on}} a Z80 {{processor}} running at 4 MHz. Audio was provided by two 2 MHz SN76496 chips with a 4 MHz Z80 co-processor. The graphics were provided by a raster video unit at a resolution of 256 x 224.|$|R
50|$|The {{industry}} gradually {{moved away}} from <b>proprietary</b> Japanese <b>hardware</b> to the burgeoning DOS platform, and then later in the decade to Windows. Throughout the nineties, bishōjo games underwent an evolution from {{being one of the}} most technologically demanding types of games (because their detailed 2D graphics required a large amount of storage space by the standards of early computers) to one of the least (they rarely use 3D graphics). Thus, more than regular games, the main employees required by bishōjo game companies today are not programmers but artists and writers.|$|R
5000|$|An arcade {{fighting}} game {{developed by}} Rare {{and published by}} Midway and Nintendo. Initially released in arcades in 1994, and rumored to use an [...] "Ultra 64" [...] hardware engine, in reality the <b>proprietary</b> arcade <b>hardware</b> was co-developed by Rare and Midway. The game received a high-profile launch on the SNES which bundled a CD of remixed game tracks with a limited edition cartridge colored black, {{as well as a}} release on the Game Boy handheld the following year. A digital port, titled Killer Instinct Classic, was released as part of a bundle with its 2013 sequel's first season on Xbox One.|$|R
