5|$|Around this time, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{great and}} {{definitive}} works from Cairano, the Sanmicheli left Brescia, never to return. In Casale Monferrato, Bartolomeo {{died two years}} later. Matteo, who started alongside his father, continued and ended his career in Piedmont, near Turin, where he left many of his better known works.|$|E
5|$|In 1254 or 1255, Henry III {{received}} an African elephant from Louis IX of France depicted by Matthew Paris in his ‘Chronica Majora’. A wooden structure {{was built to}} house the elephant, 12.2m (40ft) long by 6.1m (20ft) wide. The animal died in 1258, possibly because it was given red wine, but also <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cold climate of England.|$|E
5|$|Karamokho Alfa's {{maternal}} {{cousin was}} Maka Jiba, {{the ruler of}} Bundu, and both men studied in Fugumba under the famous scholar Tierno Samba. However, there are no records of Bundu participation in the Futa Jallon jihad, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> internal troubles in Bundu at that time, or perhaps because Maka Jiba was not greatly interested in the cause.|$|E
50|$|<b>Perhaps</b> partly <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> modest {{commercial}} {{success of this}} album, and <b>perhaps</b> partly <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> habit <b>of</b> distancing themselves musically from their most recent work, Tennant and Lowe have since returned to their dance roots. One year after <b>the</b> release <b>of</b> Release, Pet Shop Boys released Disco 3 which included remixes <b>of</b> some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> songs from Release along with new material that {{they were working on}} at <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> writing/producing material for Release.|$|R

50|$|Although {{this was}} the largest popular {{uprising}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Meiji period, or <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> it, <b>the</b> government sought to dismiss it by describing the rebels {{as little more than}} hooligans.|$|R
5|$|The set was Haydn's first {{complete}} set of quartets since the Opus 33 set of 1781. While the Opus 33 set was apt for broad public consumption, the Opus 50 set is more serious and experimental. It is <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Opus 50's intellectual character that other sets among Haydn's mature quartets have received more attention from performers.|$|E
5|$|The use of {{incendiary}} devices had {{decreased by}} the 14th century, {{perhaps due to}} the economic realities of war where it became increasingly important that captured castles and towns were undamaged. Moreover, fewer wooden engines and structures were employed in the battlefield after the late 13th century, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prior success of the incendiary weapons at destroying them.|$|E
5|$|After the Norman Conquest of 1066, {{the manor}} of Clevedon was {{granted by the}} King to Matthew de Mortagne, who in turn granted it to his sub-tenant, Hildebert. It is thought that Sir John was a {{descendant}} of either Matthew or Hildebert. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> distance to the parish church, the manor house included a chapel dedicated, in the 1320s, to Saint Peter. The house has undergone considerable change since it was built, almost every century seeing structural alterations, but it still retains many features of a mediaeval manor house.|$|E
50|$|In American English, {{the term}} has evolved to {{describe}} <b>the</b> final event <b>of</b> a sporting season, e.g. in soccer or motocross, <b>perhaps</b> partly <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> popularity <b>of</b> these with television viewers.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> lyrics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> song vary considerably. British {{versions}} of this rhyme differ significantly, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> allusions in the rhyme were unknown to British children at the time. Common versions include: ...|$|R
25|$|In spite <b>of</b> (or <b>perhaps</b> partly <b>because</b> <b>of)</b> <b>the</b> {{fact the}} two men did not get along, <b>the</b> {{combined}} influence <b>of</b> King and General Douglas MacArthur increased <b>the</b> allocation <b>of</b> resources to <b>the</b> Pacific War.|$|R
5|$|Noronhomys vespuccii, {{also known}} as Vespucci's rodent, is an extinct rat species from the islands of Fernando de Noronha off northeastern Brazil. Italian {{explorer}} Amerigo Vespucci may have seen it {{on a visit to}} Fernando de Noronha in 1503, but it subsequently became extinct, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> exotic rats and mice introduced by the first explorers of the island. Numerous but fragmentary fossil remains of the animal, of uncertain but probably Holocene age, were discovered in 1973 and described in 1999.|$|E
5|$|<b>Perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> large income the Abbot was sustaining, Bishop Alnwick {{appears to}} have not taken strong {{measures}} against the Abbot's indiscretions. He ordered {{that the number of}} canons should be increased to 30 and the number of boys in the almonry increased to 16. The Bishop also ordered proper accounts to be kept and forbade the abbot from granting favours without the permission of both the Bishop and the Canons.|$|E
5|$|Tournaments and hastiludes {{began in}} the 11th century as both a sport and to provide {{training}} for battle. Usually taking {{the form of a}} melee, the participants used the horses, armour and weapons of war. The sport of jousting grew out of the tournament and, by the 15th century, the art of tilting became quite sophisticated. In the process, the pageantry and specialization became less war-like, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> knight's changing role in war.|$|E
50|$|Although Knyaz Boris became Tsar in 1918, {{there is}} no {{evidence}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> park's name ever having officially changed to reflect this fact. Instead (or, <b>perhaps,</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> this), <b>the</b> word Knyaz was gradually dropped to become simply Boris's Garden.|$|R

50|$|Despite (or <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>of)</b> all <b>the</b> {{personnel}} moves, {{the team}} finished with only 26 wins against 58 losses, which {{put them in}} fifth (last) place in the Western Division, 34 games behind the Utah Stars, and kept them out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> playoffs.|$|R
5|$|Even {{though the}} {{boundary}} event was severe, there was significant {{variability in the}} rate of extinction between and within different clades. Species that depended on photosynthesis declined or became extinct as atmospheric particles blocked sunlight and reduced the solar energy reaching the surface of the Earth. This plant extinction caused a major reshuffling of the dominant plant groups. Omnivores, insectivores, and carrion-eaters survived the extinction event, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> increased availability of their food sources. No purely herbivorous or carnivorous mammals seem to have survived. Rather, the surviving mammals and birds fed on insects, worms, and snails, which in turn fed on dead plant and animal matter. Scientists hypothesize that these organisms survived the collapse of plant-based food chains because they fed on detritus (non-living organic material).|$|E
5|$|Following the June 29, 1889 elections, several {{suburban}} townships {{voted to}} be annexed to the city, which offered better services, such as improved water supply, sewerage, and fire and police protection. Hyde Park Township, however, had installed new waterworks in 1883 {{just north of}} 87th Street. Nonetheless, the majority of voters in 1889 supported annexation <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city’s water system for fire prevention or because of the belief that township government had become too unwieldy. After the 1889 annexation Chicago was able to leverage efficiencies as the largest United States city in area and second largest in population.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} intake, by 1937 there were 201 undergraduates; {{it was a}} uniform {{selection}} that was almost completely middle class, {{like the rest of}} the University. Over 60% of entrants came from independent schools, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> £250 a year cost of reading towards a degree. It had, unlike some other college, students from several other nations: Muhammad Aslam Khan Khattak and Abbas Khaleeli from British India among them. Students were varied: Baptist Thomas George Cowling became an astronomer and member of the Royal Society, in contrast, Jew Paul Dehn went on to become a film critic and screenwriter. Other alumni of this period include Charles Langbridge Morgan, Edward Atiyah and William Golding.|$|E
50|$|Fox later {{discontinued}} <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> term on its telecasts. This {{may have}} been done to save face among <b>the</b> critics <b>of</b> this practice, or <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> few <b>of</b> <b>the</b> leaders were non-Sprint Cup Series drivers anymore.|$|R

40|$|Cultivation of Mycobacterium lepraemurium in {{cell-free}} {{media has}} not yet been successful, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> deterioration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nutritional quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> medium with prolonged incubation at 37 °C. Trials with a continuous culture technique, involving regular change of a simple liquid medium prepared from human placenta, demonstrated active fission <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Myco. lepraemurium cells. Abundant growth in the form by macroscopically visible colonies has not been achieved even after prolonged incubation up to 8 months...|$|R
5|$|In {{the late}} medieval period, Ælfheah's feast day was celebrated in Scandinavia, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> saint's {{connection}} with Cnut. Few church dedications to him are known, {{with most of}} them occurring in Kent and one each in London and Winchester; as well as St Alfege's Church in Greenwich, a nearby hospital (1931–1968) was named after him. In the town of Solihull in the West Midlands St Alphege Church is dedicated to Ælfheah dating back to approximately 1277. In 1929 a new church in Bath was dedicated to Ælfheah, under the name Alphege, designed by Giles Gilbert Scott in homage to the ancient Roman church of Santa Maria in Cosmedin.|$|E
5|$|Shells {{are used}} decoratively in many ways. They can be pressed into {{concrete}} or plaster to make decorative paths, steps or walls {{and can be}} used to embellish picture frames, mirrors or other craft items. They can be stacked up and glued together to make ornaments. They can be pierced and threaded onto necklaces or made into other forms of jewellery. Shells have had various uses in the past as body decorations, utensils, scrapers and cutting implements. Carefully cut and shaped shell tools dating back 32,000 years have been found in a cave in Indonesia. In this region, shell technology may have been developed in preference to the use of stone or bone implements, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scarcity of suitable rock materials.|$|E
5|$|The church {{held the}} right to conduct the marriages of people {{throughout}} Manchester, not only from within its parish, until 1874. Despite this, there were no such services for the first 35 years of its existence, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> continued popularity of the Collegiate Church as a venue for weddings but probably because the latter insisted on collecting its own fees for marriages held in other local churches, which effectively doubled the cost of being married at St John's {{rather than at the}} Collegiate Church. Later, after the rights of the Collegiate Church were curtailed, some weeks saw more than 100 marriage services at St John's in the years just before 1874.|$|E
50|$|Despite - or <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> - <b>the</b> poor {{effects and}} editing, and all-round unprofessional feel, {{it became very}} popular with fans, perhaps also due to the {{carefree}} nature and fooling around <b>of</b> <b>the</b> band onscreen that {{can be attributed to}} <b>the</b> large amount <b>of</b> alcohol they consumed while filming.|$|R
5000|$|The name {{may come}} from the Yiddish words tzim (for) and esn (eating).

5|$|A towering {{figure in}} the Republican party of his day, Blaine fell into obscurity fairly soon after his death. A 1905 {{biography}} by his wife’s cousin, Edward Stanwood, was written when the question was still in doubt, {{but by the time}} David Saville Muzzey published his biography of Blaine in 1934, the subtitle “A Political Idol of Other Days” already spoke to its subject’s fading place in the popular mind, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nine men the Republican Party nominated for the Presidency from 1860 to 1912, Blaine {{is the only one who}} never became President. Although several authors studied Blaine’s foreign policy career, including Edward P. Crapol’s 2000 work, Muzzey’s was the last full-scale biography of the man until Neil Rolde’s 2006 book. Historian R. Hal Williams was working on a new biography of Blaine, tentatively titled James G. Blaine: A Life in Politics, until his death in 2016.|$|E
5|$|Because of its poor flying ability, {{large size}} and {{possible}} island tameness, the broad-billed parrot was easy prey for sailors who visited Mauritius, and their nests {{would have been}} extremely vulnerable to predation by introduced crab-eating macaques and rats. Various sources indicate the bird was aggressive, {{which may explain why}} it held out so long against introduced animals after all. The bird is believed to have become extinct by the 1680s, when the palms it may have sustained itself on were harvested on a large scale. Unlike other parrot species, which were often taken as pets by sailors, there are no records of broad-billed parrots being transported from Mauritius either live or dead, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stigma associated with ravens. The birds would not in any case have survived such a journey if they refused to eat anything but seeds.|$|E
5|$|In the 14th century, as Gothic art {{gave way}} to the International Gothic era, a number of schools {{developed}} in northern Europe. Early Netherlandish art originated in French courtly art, and is especially tied to the tradition and conventions of illuminated manuscripts. Modern art historians see the era as beginning with 14th-century manuscript illuminators. They were followed by panel painters such as Melchior Broederlam and Robert Campin, the latter generally considered the first Early Netherlandish master, under whom van der Weyden served his apprenticeship. Illumination reached a peak in the region in the decades after 1400, mainly due to the patronage of Burgundian and House of Valois-Anjou dukes such as Philip the Bold, Louis I of Anjou and Jean, Duke of Berry. This patronage continued in the low countries with the Burgundian dukes, Philip the Good and his son Charles the Bold. The demand for illuminated manuscripts declined {{towards the end of the}} century, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> costly production process in comparison to panel painting. Yet illumination remained popular at the luxury end of the market, and prints, both engravings and woodcuts, found a new mass market, especially those by artists such as Martin Schongauer and Albrecht Dürer.|$|E
50|$|Understanding the {{potential}} for change in the sediment sources and supply of cay beaches with environmental change is an important key to predicting their present and future stability. Despite, or <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> debate around <b>the</b> future <b>of</b> cays, there is consensus that these island environments are very complex and somewhat fragile.|$|R
50|$|Despite his {{military}} service, or <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> it, <b>the</b> Prince became a pacifist, establishing <b>the</b> International Institute <b>of</b> Peace in Monaco {{as a place}} to develop a peaceful settlement for conflict through arbitration. In the tension-filled times leading up to World War I, Prince Albert made numerous attempts to dissuade Germany's Kaiser Wilhelm II from war.|$|R
