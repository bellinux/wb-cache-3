This ‘fusion’ (mix of expertise) resulting from gaining expertise in quite different occupational areas, is attainable at academic career start levels in accounting, where during one's career orientation a professor is both an academic and a professional by training. Fusion is also attainable in complementary competence building wherein the faculty member invests in training and development in the non-core competence domain. The so-called ‘fusion framework’ that is depicted in this contribution could be usefully applied in recruitment efforts of business schools in search of a promising accounting professor...|$|R

40|$|Today’s <b>public</b> <b>accounting</b> firms face {{a number}} of {{challenges}} {{in relation to their}} most valuable resource and primary revenue generator, human capital. Expanding regulations, technology advances, increased competition and high turnover rates {{are just a few of}} the issues confronting <b>public</b> <b>accounting</b> leaders in today’s complex business environment. In recent years, some <b>public</b> <b>accounting</b> firms have attempted to combat low retention and high burnout rates with traditional one-to-one mentoring programs, with varying degrees of success. Many firms have found that they lack the resources necessary to successfully implement and maintain such programs. In other industries, organizations have used a group mentoring approach in an attempt to remove potential barriers to mentoring success. Although the research regarding group mentoring shows promise for positive organizational outcomes, no cases could be found in the literature regarding its usage in a <b>public</b> <b>accounting</b> firm. Because of the unique challenges associated with <b>public</b> <b>accounting</b> firms, this paper attempts to answer two questions: (1) Does group mentoring provide a viable alternative to traditional mentoring in a <b>public</b> <b>accounting</b> firm? (2) If so, what general model might be used for implementing such a program? In answering these questions, a review of the group mentoring literature is provided, along with a suggested model for the implementation of group mentoring in a <b>public</b> <b>accounting</b> firm...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{inability}} of <b>public</b> <b>accounting</b> practices to retain female auditors {{is of concern}} to the profession. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to examine the factors associated with the actual turnover decisions made by female auditors in the <b>public</b> <b>accounting</b> profession. Design/methodology/approach – Multinomial logistic regression is used to analyze survey data from 247 female auditors who were formerly employed by <b>public</b> <b>accounting</b> firms in Hong Kong. About 20 semi-structured interviews are conducted to supplement the findings. Findings – The results reveal that role conflict has the highest explanatory power among the independent variables. Social comparison with peers, stress and age are also influential factors in the turnover decisions made by female auditors in the <b>public</b> <b>accounting</b> field. These results support social comparison theory, which asserts that individuals are driven to evaluate their abilities and opinions through social comparison with others. A particularly interesting finding is that neither physical appearance nor gender discrimination is an influential factor, which contradicts the findings of research carried out in the USA and Japan. Originality/value – According to human capital theory, the departure of female auditors from the <b>public</b> <b>accounting</b> profession represents a significant loss in human capital. <b>Public</b> <b>accounting</b> firms should thus take immediate measures to retain this valuable source of human capital and achieve the goal of a gender-diverse workplace.

40|$|Thesis (MPA) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2011. Since its {{inception}} in 1861 when the first <b>public</b> <b>accounts</b> committee {{was established in the}} United Kingdom, this oversight mechanism has developed into a model for non-executive financial oversight and accountability at the national and provincial levels of government throughout the Commonwealth and beyond. A few municipalities in South Africa have also established <b>public</b> <b>accounts</b> committees, but they are a few isolated cases. The hesitance on the part of South African municipalities to establish a good governance mechanism with a proven track record is a cause of concern, especially in view of the poor financial management that prevails throughout the local sphere of government. In this case study of the <b>public</b> <b>accounts</b> committee established in the City of Cape Town in 2006, the researcher explores the feasibility of the implementation of the <b>public</b> <b>accounts</b> committee model within the local government sphere in South Africa. Twenty internationally recognised <b>public</b> <b>accounts</b> committee practices were identified and used to probe the selected case to gain in-depth knowledge {{of the extent to which}} the committee adheres to these recognised practices. Where the committee deviated from accepted practices, the reasons for the deviation and its impact on the effectiveness of the committee were analysed. Finally, the key lessons learnt from the experience of the <b>public</b> <b>accounts</b> committee in the City of Cape Town are used in order to make two sets of recommendations: Firstly, recommendations on how the <b>public</b> <b>accounts</b> committee of the City of Cape Town can become more effective than it currently is – recommendations which are also relevant to any municipality wishing to establish a <b>public</b> <b>accounts</b> committee. The second set of recommendations is addressed to the national authorities in charge of finance and local government, as the challenge of establishing improved governance systems in local government is of national importance, and it is within the power of these authorities to remove a few key obstacles in the way of establishing municipal <b>public</b> <b>accounts</b> committees...|$|R
