50|$|The <b>pale-vented</b> <b>pigeon</b> {{is common}} at forest edges, riverbanks, and other {{partially}} open areas with some trees. It feeds mainly on small fruits, berries and seed. This {{is a fairly}} solitary bird, but may form small flocks at drinking areas. Its flight is high, fast and direct, with the regular beats and an occasional sharp flick of the wings which are characteristic of pigeons in general.|$|E

Formerly often placed in Columba, it actually belongs to a clade of the older New World genus Patagioenas. With its relatives it represents an evolutionary radiation extending {{through most of the}} warm-temperate to tropical Americas. Grey-hued birds, even their males generally lack iridescent display plumage, although the present species has some coppery gloss on the nape.|$|E
