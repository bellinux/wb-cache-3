Notre objectif est d’aborder les notions de varifold et de courbure gnralise au travers d’exemples simples. 1. What is a varifold? 1. 1. Context Varifolds were introduced by F. Almgren in [2] as {{he was interested in}} solving <b>Plateau’s</b> <b>problem</b> in a broader class of surfaces. Roughly, <b>Plateau’s</b> <b>Problem</b> can be formulated in the following form Problème 1. 1 (<b>Plateau’s</b> <b>Problem).</b> Given a closed curve Γ in R 3, is there a surface with minimal area spanning it? Obviously, this problem depends on the hypothesis on Γ, the set of surfaces one authorizes and the meaning one gives to span. In 1931 (cf. [5]), J. Douglas solved the problem in the restricted class of surfaces being parametrized images of a disk but this excludes the case of non-orientable surfaces or triple-junction. The problem is that Mœbius strip or junctions can be obtained as soap films. Almgren introduced varifolds to tackle <b>Plateau’s</b> <b>Problem</b> in a class containing such surfaces. A varifold is a generalized surface, which can b...|$|R

The {{question as to whether}} a minimal surface with given boundary exists is called <b>Plateau's</b> <b>problem</b> after the Belgian physicist Joseph Plateau who carried out experiments on soap films in the mid-nineteenth century. In 1930 Jesse Douglas and Tibor Radó gave an affirmative answer to <b>Plateau's</b> <b>problem</b> (Douglas was awarded one of the first Fields medals for this work in 1936).|$|R

50|$|As a {{graduate}} student at the University of Warwick, where Zeeman introduced her to <b>Plateau's</b> <b>problem.</b> She found a counterexample to the Seifert conjecture at Oxford. In a Berkeley seminar in 1983 she proposed the existence of a general theory linking these together, and the theory of differential chains began to evolve. Jenny Harrison and Harrison Pugh proved that the topological vector space of differential chains satisfies a universal property determined by two natural axioms. They have used the theory to provide the first universal solution to <b>Plateau's</b> <b>problem,</b> including soap film regularity, building upon Harrison's earlier paper. Recently, Fried and Seguin have found a broad generalization to Reynolds transport theorem using the methods of differential chains.|$|R

40|$|<b>Plateau's</b> <b>problem</b> is not {{a single}} {{conjecture}} or theorem, but rather an abstract framework, encompassing a number of different problems in several related areas of mathematics. In its most general form, <b>Plateau's</b> <b>problem</b> is to find an element of a given collection C of "surfaces" specified by some boundary constraint, which minimizes, or is a critical point of, a given "area" function F:C→. In addition, one should also show that any such element satisfies some sort of regularity, that it be a sufficiently smooth manifold away from a well-behaved singular set. The choices apparent in making this question precise lead to a great many different versions of the <b>problem.</b> <b>Plateau's</b> <b>problem</b> has generated a large number of papers, inspired new fields of mathematics, and given rise to techniques which have proved useful in applications further afield. In this review we discuss a few highlights from the past hundred years, with special attention to papers of Federer, Fleming, Reifenberg and Almgren from the 1960 's, and works by several groups, including ourselves, who have made significant progress on different aspects of the problem in recent years.

5000|$|Harrison {{specializes in}} {{geometric}} analysis and {{areas in the}} intersection of algebra, geometry, and geometric measure theory. She introduced and developed with collaborators a theory of generalized functions called differential chains that unifies an infinitesimal calculus with the classical theory of the smooth continuum, a long outstanding problem. The infinitesimals are constructive and arise from methods of standard analysis, {{as opposed to the}} nonstandard analysis of Abraham Robinson. The methods apply equally well to domains such as soap films, fractals, charged particles, and Whitney stratified spaces, placing them on the same footing as smooth submanifolds in the resulting calculus. The results include optimal generalizations and simplifications of the theorems of Stokes, Gauss and Green. She has pioneered applications of differential chains to the calculus of variations, physics, and continuum mechanics. Her solution to <b>Plateau's</b> <b>problem</b> is the first proof of existence of a solution to a universal <b>Plateau’s</b> <b>problem</b> for finitely many boundary curves, taking into account all soap films arising in nature, including nonorientable films with triple junctions, as well as solutions of Jesse Douglas, [...] Herbert Federer and Wendell Fleming.
