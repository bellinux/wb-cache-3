5|$|Compared with {{planets and}} other astronomical bodies, {{the objects of}} {{everyday}} life (people, cars, houses, even mountains) have little mass. Where such objects are concerned, the laws governing the behavior of test particles are sufficient to describe what happens. Notably, in order to deflect a test particle from its geodesic path, an external force must be applied. A chair someone is sitting on applies an external upwards force preventing the person from falling freely towards {{the center of the}} Earth and thus following a geodesic, which they would otherwise be doing without matter in between them and the center of the Earth. In this way, general relativity explains the daily experience of gravity {{on the surface of the}} Earth not as the downwards pull of a gravitational force, but as the upwards <b>push</b> <b>of</b> external forces. These forces deflect all bodies resting on the Earth's surface from the geodesics they would otherwise follow. For matter objects whose own gravitational influence cannot be neglected, the laws of motion are somewhat more complicated than for test particles, although it remains true that spacetime tells matter how to move.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish vanguard {{was driven}} {{off by the}} English at the first charge, but the Spanish pikemen under Captains Pedro Manrique and Manuel de Vega, from Francisco Arias de Bobadilla's and Juan del Águila's tercios, formed the {{defenders}} into squadron formation and kept the way open for the wagons. As the carters fled {{at the beginning of}} the fight, the Spanish arquebusiers had to take their places and brought the wagons towards Zutphen. Stanley's pikemen charged upon the Spanish squadron, but they were repelled at the <b>push</b> <b>of</b> pike. As the fight approached Zutphen and Francisco Verdugo noticed the musketry fire, he ordered a wagon to be loaded with powder and bullets and sent it to the Spanish arquebusiers. The English cavalry, in the meantime, charged over the Spanish pikes on one of its flanks. Though they succeeded in breaking the two or three foremost ranks, Essex's men could not penetrate further. Twice more the English charged upon the squadron, but they were as well repelled.|$|E

5|$|The game {{opens to}} music {{composed}} by Johann Sebastian Bach. Its tiled maze contains 256 screens and is drawn in a 16 by 16 grid. The maze's paths are bordered by tropical flora, populated with attacking enemies and, on its outskirts, surrounded by mountains. Apart from the jungle, the game's maze also includes several lakes. The player swings Sabreman's sabre with the <b>push</b> <b>of</b> the joystick's fire button to defeat enemies that spawn in random on-screen locations. When the player idles {{too long in}} the same screen, an indestructible bushfire appears to pursue Sabreman. Enemies include spiders, scorpions, snakes, bats, indigenous people, sleeping hippos, and a fast wolf (the titular Sabre Wulf). Some enemies are killed, others flee when hit, while the wolf, cave guardian, and bushfire are unaffected by the sabre.|$|E

25|$|Construction on Glen Canyon Dam {{began with}} a {{demolition}} blast keyed by the <b>push</b> <b>of</b> a button by President Dwight D.

On February 11, 1959, water was diverted through the tunnels so dam construction could begin. Later that year, the bridge was completed, allowing trucks to deliver equipment and materials for the dam, and also for the new town of Page, Arizona.|$|E
25|$|Although {{there is}} no clearly {{documented}} reason behind the migration of 406, a widely accepted {{theory is that the}} migration of the various Germanic peoples west of the Rhine is due to the westward <b>push</b> <b>of</b> the Huns during the late 4th century. The reasoning being that the activities of the Huns disrupted and threatened the existing peoples of the region forcing them to uproot. It should be noted that this theory has created controversy within the academic community, {{because of the lack of}} convincing evidence.|$|E

25|$|During World War I, company {{commander}} Captain Lawrence of the U.S. Army overheard Solomon Louis and Mitchell Bobb conversing in the Choctaw language. He found eight Choctaw {{men in the}} battalion. Eventually, fourteen Choctaw men in the Army's 36th Infantry Division trained to use their language in code. They helped the American Expeditionary Forces win several key battles in the Meuse-Argonne Offensive in France, during the final large German <b>push</b> <b>of</b> the war. Within 24 hours of the Choctaw language being pressed into service, the tide of the battle had turned. In less than 72 hours, the Germans were retreating and the Allies were in full attack. These soldiers are {{now known as the}} Choctaw code talkers.|$|E
25|$|The western {{defenses}} were {{pierced by}} two gates: the Lenba (the main gate) and a secondary one, {{closer to the}} beach. By that stage there were scarcely 300 Spaniards left, most of which had no fireams. Carleill ordered Sergeant-Major Powell to assault the secondary gate with a storming party, while the lieutenant-general led {{the rest of his}} men towards the Lenba. Both English columns broke into a run and charged at the <b>push</b> <b>of</b> pike. Following a mingled fierce hand-to-hand fight, the Spanish were swept on through both gates and then melted away, after which neither column met with any serious opposition. The stormers did not stop until the two English columns met in the Plaza.|$|E

The aggressive expansion of the Iroquois Confederacy southward and the simultaneous <b>push</b> <b>of</b> the Cherokee people northward far in excess of their rates of population growth cleared large sections of the central eastern United States of most inhabitants, facilitating the rapid settlement by Europeans.|$|E
