His advice to princes was therefore certainly not limited to discussing how to maintain a state. It {{has been argued that}} Machiavelli's <b>promotion</b> <b>of</b> <b>innovation</b> led directly to the argument for progress as an aim of politics and civilisation.

Various policy measures targeted at SMEs’ support and development necessarily include measures on <b>promotion</b> <b>of</b> <b>innovations</b> within small business.

Statistics on the registered small and medium enterprises shows that the sharp rise of entrepreneurship observed in the early 1990 s changed for the stagnation {{towards the end of the}} decade and sluggish dynamics of the present time. Unfortunately, as practice shows, measures taken so far do not stimulate significant changes in the development of small business. Moreover, differentiation of small businesses between regions is only increasing, as it is manifested through substitution of divergence for convergence.
