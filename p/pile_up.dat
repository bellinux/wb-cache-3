5|$|The game tasks {{the player}} with {{navigating}} a bus through roads filled with alien potato beings. The player's bus holds female {{members of the}} alien race, and the player can shoot the females {{from the front of}} the bus in order to clear the alien potatoes. The aliens come in two colors: red and blue. Aliens are cleared from the road when two like-colored potatoes touch each other, but aliens begin to <b>pile</b> <b>up</b> in the road if two aliens hit each other that are not of the same color. The road is continuously scrolling downwards, forcing the player to make holes in the road wide enough to fit the bus through. The game can end prematurely if the player runs into too many aliens and loses all their lives.|$|E
5|$|Before commencing laying, {{the female}} spends much time near the nest and is entirely {{provisioned}} by the male. Meanwhile, the male roosts nearby and may cache any prey that is surplus to their requirements. When the female has reached peak weight, the male provides a ritual presentation {{of food and}} copulation occurs at the nest. The female lays eggs on alternate days and the clutch size averages about five eggs (range two to nine). The eggs are chalky white, somewhat elliptical and {{about the size of}} bantam's eggs, and incubation begins as soon as the first egg is laid. While she is sitting on the nest, the male is constantly bringing more provisions and they may <b>pile</b> <b>up</b> beside the female. The incubation period is about thirty days, hatching takes place over a prolonged period and the youngest chick may be several weeks younger than its oldest sibling. In years with plentiful supplies of food, there may be a hatching success rate of about 75%. The male continues to copulate with the female when he brings food which makes the newly hatched chicks vulnerable to injury.|$|E

40|$|To {{solve the}} {{ecological}} disasters in Pubugou Reservoir Fluctuating Zone, ecological blanket governance model is proposed in this paper, which may provide good early environment for plants’ survival in fluctuation zone, and then play {{the function of}} greening and sustainable development to ensure the slopes’ stability. Meanwhile, based on the result of vetiver ecological blanket in Hanyuan experimental zone, we find that three kinds of typical Fluctuating Zone slope’s greening effect is good, which includes the dirt <b>piling</b> <b>up</b> slope, the whole lump of rock slope and the gravel <b>piling</b> <b>up</b> slope, and it gets an average coverage of 90. 3 % as well as good strength. Due to the different geological conditions, the ecological blankets’ governance effect differs from slope to slope. Using analytic hierarchy process to calculate the weight, we get the dirt <b>piling</b> <b>up</b> slope, the whole lump of rock slope and the gravel <b>piling</b> <b>up</b> slope’s weights are 0. 41, 0. 17, 0. 42, respectively, namely, the dirt <b>piling</b> <b>up</b> slope and the gravel <b>piling</b> <b>up</b> slope have good results overall, followed by the whole lump of rock slope...|$|R

Geoff Boycott took nearly seven hours to make 142 not out having seen his partners Luckhurst, Edrich (run out by Boycott) and Fletcher depart with only 48 runs on the board. He added 133 with d'Oliveira (56), 95 with Illingworth (53) and 43 with Knott (21 not out) before the captain declared at 319/5 on the afternoon of the fourth day.|$|E
25|$|CH {{stations}} converted their {{angle and}} range measurements into a {{location on the}} Ordnance Survey National Grid. A telephone operator, or teller, forwarded this location to the filter room, where a plotter would place a small coloured marker at that location on a large map covering most of the UK, the colours being {{the same as those}} adopted by the Observer Corps to indicate the time of the report. The rapidity of reporting caused plot markers to <b>pile</b> <b>up</b> on the map, which became quite cluttered during larger missions. Since each station had inaccuracies, the plots spread out on the map.|$|E
25|$|To {{produce a}} shock wave, {{an object in}} a given medium (such as air or water) must travel faster than the local speed of sound. In {{the case of an}} {{aircraft}} travelling at high subsonic speed, regions of air around the aircraft may be travelling at exactly the speed of sound, so that the sound waves leaving the aircraft <b>pile</b> <b>up</b> on one another, similar to a traffic jam on a motorway. When a shock wave forms, the local air pressure increases and then spreads out sideways. Because of this amplification effect, a shock wave can be very intense, more like an explosion when heard at a distance (not coincidentally, since explosions create shock waves).|$|E

25|$|The {{lack of a}} {{vigorous}} response led the Navy to conclude that their bombardment had suppressed the Japanese defenses and in good order the Marines began deployment to the Iwo Jima beach. Gen. Kuribayashi was far from beaten, however. In the deathly silence, landed US Marines began to slowly inch their way forward inland, oblivious to the danger. After allowing the Americans to <b>pile</b> <b>up</b> men and machinery on the beach for just over an hour, Kuribayashi unleashed the undiminished force of his countermeasures. Shortly after 10:00, everything from machine guns and mortars to heavy artillery began to rain down on the crowded beach, which was quickly transformed into a nightmarish bloodbath.|$|E
25|$|During {{his first}} season with Lancashire, Law was awarded his county cap. Apart from an {{enforced}} absence through injury {{for part of the}} 2004 season, Law continued to <b>pile</b> <b>up</b> the runs for his new team, scoring 1,820 in 2003 at an exceptional average of 91, and after hitting 1,277 championship runs in 2007, signed a new one-year deal with the club. Following Mark Chilton's resignation as captain {{at the end of the}} 2007 season, Law was appointed Lancashire captain ahead of players such as Dominic Cork, Glen Chapple and Luke Sutton. He was released in October 2008 to be replaced by Glen Chapple as captain for the 2009 season, before signing a contract to play for Derbyshire in limited overs cricket in 2009.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes an {{exhibition}} race is held {{after all the}} meaningful races are run with all the amateur class winners from Novice up to Expert and including the Open, girls classes and perhaps Cruiser classes race together once. This is called the Trophy Dash. Like in the Open Classes, no points are rewarded in this case, just a chance for bragging rights and to match yourself up against people that are at a higher skill level. Only one race for a single first-place trophy is awarded. As in the Opens the Expert usually wins with the Intermediate winner pulling one out {{every once in a}} while. Novices usually win only when a major, catastrophic <b>pile</b> <b>up</b> occurs on the track and even then the mass smash up has to happen quite close to the finish line.|$|E

25|$|By {{the end of}} the battle, {{several hundred}} Druze fighters were slain, {{although}} the sources vary about the actual figure with Michael Provence stating it was between 300–400, while Jean-Denis Lepage writing it was close to 500. Among the deceased rebels was the local chief of Rasas, Sheikh Salman Hamza as well as his four sons. On the French side, 47 soldiers were killed and 83 wounded, while all the French cavalry horses were lost, despite not being utilized. There were also about 500 wounded Druze who were captured after the battle as prisoners of war. They were ordered by Andréa to <b>pile</b> <b>up</b> the slain rebels and residents of al-Musayfirah in front of the village to serve as an example. The POWs were subsequently executed. The battle of al-Musayfirah marked the first French victory during the revolt.|$|E
25|$|Student unrest {{became a}} regular feature of Ethiopian {{life in the}} 1960s and 1970s. Marxism took root in large {{segments}} of the Ethiopian intelligentsia, particularly among those who had studied abroad and had thus been exposed to radical and left-wing sentiments that were becoming popular {{in other parts of the}} globe. Resistance by conservative elements at the Imperial Court and Parliament, and by the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, made Haile Selassie's land reform proposals difficult to implement, and also damaged the standing of the government, costing Haile Selassie much of the goodwill he had once enjoyed. This bred resentment among the peasant population. Efforts to weaken unions also hurt his image. As these issues began to <b>pile</b> <b>up,</b> Haile Selassie left much of domestic governance to his Prime Minister, Aklilu Habte Wold, and concentrated more on foreign affairs.|$|E
25|$|In Week 2, {{the team}} {{traveled}} to St. Louis where they lost 24-22. A major defensive loss was suffered when Brian Orakpo went {{down from a}} tear to his left pectoral muscle.

The game started on a bad omen when the Bengals threw a 76-yard TD pass on the opening drive. Although the Redskins responded furiously and played another close match, they lost and injuries continued to <b>pile</b> <b>up</b> as CB Josh Wilson and WR Pierre Garçon went down. They would win their next game on a late game field goal at Tampa Bay, 24-22, after the Buccaneers made a 4th quarter comeback to take the lead. The Redskins only won one of their next five games, going into the bye week at 3-6.|$|E
