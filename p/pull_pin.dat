40|$|Mechanism easy to open {{intentionally}} but resists accidental opening. Locking or Unlocking {{occurs when}} <b>pull</b> <b>pin</b> enters or leaves conical base. Pushing ejection pin or pulling knob unlocks mechanism. Unintentional release unlikely since accidental pilot motions push on knob in most cases. This safety feature, coupled with simplicity {{and reliability of}} mechanism, useful for emergency exits for land vehicles or even buildings...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} we {{analyzed}} a joint created {{for a medical}} walker currently in the prototyping stage of development. The walker {{is designed to help}} a user stand up from a seated position. The joint holds two legs of the walker together in an 'x ' shape. It must be able to lock in two positions and support the full weight of the user while he or she is getting up. We looked at four different locking mechanisms including a spring loaded <b>pull</b> <b>pin,</b> a friction bearing, a clutch, and an electronic solenoid. After weighing {{the pros and cons of}} each mechanism we recommend and present a design using the <b>pull</b> <b>pin.</b> In order to determine the strength and deflection of the loaded pin we modeled it both as a cantilevered beam, and a simply supported beam with three points of contact. We compared the hand calculations to FEA of solid models and found that modeling the pin as a simply supported beam is more accurate than the cantilever representation...|$|E

50|$|<b>Pull</b> the <b>Pin</b> is {{the sixth}} studio album by Welsh rock band Stereophonics, {{released}} by V2 in the UK on 12 October 2007. A Stereophonics newsletter released the <b>Pull</b> the <b>Pin</b> album artwork to subscribers. The cover was also shown to Myspace users that had added the band in a bulletin.|$|R
40|$|A double-retention {{redundant}} <b>pull</b> <b>pin</b> {{release system}} is disclosed. The system responds {{to a single}} pull during an intentional release operation. A spiral-threaded main pin is seated in a mating bore in a housing, which main pin has a flange fastened thereon at {{the part of the}} main pin which is exterior to the housing. Accidental release tends to rotate the main pin. A secondary pin passes through a slightly oversized opening in the flange and is seated in a second bore in the housing. The pins counteract against one another to prevent accidental release. A frictional lock is shared between the main and secondary pins to enhance further locking of the system. The secondary pin, in response to a first pull, is fully retracted from its bore and flange hole. Thereafter the pull causes the main pin to rotate free of the housing to release, for example, a parachute mechanism...|$|E
50|$|Stereophonics did not {{resurface}} {{until later}} {{the following year}} where they began recording for the sixth studio album <b>Pull</b> The <b>Pin</b> which was released on 15 October 2007. <b>Pull</b> The <b>Pin</b> is an album that returns to the band's classic rock roots evident in the first album {{and the influence of}} 1970s rock can be heard in numerous tracks.|$|R
40|$|Damage to {{connectors}} {{reduced and}} special tools not needed. Clockwise rotation of screw tightens wedges against mounting body and right heat sink. Counterclockwise rotation of screw drives bottom wedge downward and jacking ring upward, <b>pulling</b> <b>pins</b> away from mating connector. Screw in mechanism turned to produce jacking force that disengages board from mating connector. Force parallel to connector pins do not bend or brake. When disengaged, board protrudes from assembly and readily grasped by operator...|$|R

50|$|Philips, however, used an 'M-wrap' {{similar to}} that in VHS machines. Cables <b>pulled</b> <b>pins</b> along tracks in order to pull the tape into the {{transport}} path. This drive was large, heavy and very complex to produce, although having the head drum, capstan, audio/erase heads and the respective drive motors all mounted on a common base plate meant it was produced to high tolerances. Philips referred to this assembly as the ‘microworld’. Second and third generation Philips drives replaced the cable-pulled pins with a reliable lever mechanism.|$|R

50|$|HD Audio {{can sense}} the {{presence}} of an audio dongle. A 10 kΩ pull-up resistor is attached to pin 4 (PRESENCE#). When the HDA dongle is plugged in, it <b>pulls</b> <b>pin</b> 4 to ground with a 1 kΩ resistor. The motherboard can determine if the dongle is plugged in by examining the logic level on pin 4. If the motherboard does not detect {{the presence of}} an HDA dongle, then it should ignore SENSE1_RETURN (pin 6) and SENSE2_RETURN (pin 10) signals. In AC'97, pins 2 and 4 are audio ground, but pin 4 is often disconnected. Consequently, an HDA motherboard would not detect {{the presence of an}} AC'97 dongle with a disconnected pin 4.|$|R

5000|$|In September 2004, while {{investigating}} {{reports that}} Abu Mousab al-Zarqawi's nascent [...] "al-Qaeda in Iraq" [...] group was openly claiming {{control of the}} Haifa Street area of Baghdad, Ware was briefly held at gunpoint by fighters loyal to Zarqawi who had <b>pulled</b> <b>pins</b> from live grenades and forced his car to stop. The men dragged him from the car and stood him beneath one of the banners, intending to film his execution with his own video camera. By threatening them with immediate and violent retaliation, his local guides, including members of the Ba'ath Party, were able to win his release. Ware has stated that, had this happened {{only a few months}} later, when Zarqawi's group had grown stronger, he would have been killed.|$|R
40|$|A helmet formed of a rigid {{shell is}} disclosed. The shell {{is lined with}} several air filled {{bladders}} to contact firmly {{the head of a}} user. The shell has a rigid chin bar supporting a bite bar connected fixedly to a mouthpiece bearing against the teeth and hard palate to firmly anchor the helmet without movement. The outer shell surface supports various air pumping bulbs and accelerometers. Separate left and right visor pivot on the side guided in a central tongue and groove track to move optical lens mounts into the user's field of vision. The chin bar is connected to the shell by a pair of releasable clasps.

40|$|Following {{the failure}} of a {{previously}} qualified pyrotechnically actuated <b>pin</b> <b>puller</b> design, an investigation led to a redesign and requalification. The emphasis of the second qualification was placed on determining the functional margin of the <b>pin</b> <b>puller</b> by comparing the energy deliverable by the pyrotechnic cartridge to the energy required to accomplish the function. Also determined were the effects of functional variables. This paper describes the failure investigation, the test methods employed and the results of the evaluation, and provides a recommended approach to assure the successful functioning of pyrotechnic devices...|$|R
