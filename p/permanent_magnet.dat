5|$|This {{relationship}} between magnetic fields and currents is extremely important, for {{it led to}} Michael Faraday's invention of the electric motor in 1821. Faraday's homopolar motor consisted of a <b>permanent</b> <b>magnet</b> sitting {{in a pool of}} mercury. A current was allowed through a wire suspended from a pivot above the magnet and dipped into the mercury. The magnet exerted a tangential force on the wire, making it circle around the magnet {{for as long as the}} current was maintained.|$|E
5|$|Bismuth is {{also used}} in aluminium-silicon cast alloys in order to refine silicon morphology. However, it {{indicated}} a poisoning effect on modification of strontium (Sr). Some bismuth alloys, such as Bi35-Pb37-Sn25, are combined with non-sticking materials such as mica, glass and enamels because they easily wet them allowing to make joints to other parts. Addition of bismuth to caesium enhances the quantum yield of caesium cathodes. Sintering of bismuth and manganese powders at 300°C produces a <b>permanent</b> <b>magnet</b> and magnetostrictive material, which is used in ultrasonic generators and receivers working in the 10–100kHz range and in magnetic memory devices.|$|E

A method for increasing the magnetic induction in the gap of the motor LW- 3000 by forming a combined magnetic rotor system based on flat <b>permanent</b> <b>magnets</b> with tangential magnetization and ferromagnetic concentrators of magnetic fluxes is proposed. The influence of the thickness of <b>permanent</b> <b>magnets</b> on the static torque characteristics of {{the two types of}} electric motors with identical overall dimensions of stator: radial and tangential magnetization of <b>permanent</b> <b>magnets</b> on the rotor is examined.

25|$|The main {{advantage}} of an electromagnet over a <b>permanent</b> <b>magnet</b> is that the magnetic field can be quickly changed by controlling the amount of electric current in the winding.

40|$|Abstract—Attracting {{ferromagnetic}} forces between magnet {{and reaction}} rail provide the supporting force in Electromagnetic Suspension. Miniature maglev using <b>permanent</b> <b>magnets</b> and electromagnets {{is based on}} the idea to generate the nominal magnetic force by <b>permanent</b> <b>magnets</b> and superimpose the variable magnetic field required for stabilization by currents flowing through control windings in electromagnets. <b>Permanent</b> <b>magnets</b> with a high energy density have lower power losses with regard to supporting force and magnet weight. So the advantage of the maglev using electromagnets and <b>permanent</b> <b>magnets</b> is partially reduced by the power required to feed the remaining onboard supply system so that the overall onboard power is diminished as compared to that of the electromagnet. In this paper we proposed the how to design and control the miniature maglev and confirmed the feasibility of the levitation system using electromagnets and <b>permanent</b> <b>magnets</b> through the manufacturing the miniature magle...|$|R
