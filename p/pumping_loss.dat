25|$|Wankel {{rotary engine}} and piston engine displacement, and {{corresponding}} power, output can more accurately be compared by displacement per {{revolution of the}} eccentric shaft. A calculation of this form dictates that a two-rotor Wankel displacing 654cc per face will have a displacement of 1.3 liters per every rotation of the eccentric shaft (only two total faces, one face per rotor going through a full power stroke) and 2.6 liters after two revolutions (four total faces, two faces per rotor going through a full power stroke). The results are directly comparable to a 2.6-liter piston engine with an even number of cylinders in a conventional firing order, which will likewise displace 1.3 liters through its power stroke after one revolution of the crankshaft, and 2.6 liters through its power strokes after two revolutions of the crankshaft. A Wankel rotary engine is still a four-stroke engine, and pumping losses from non-power strokes still apply, but the absence of throttling valves and a 50% longer stroke duration result in a significantly lower <b>pumping</b> <b>loss</b> compared to a four-stroke reciprocating piston engine. Measuring a Wankel rotary engine in this way more accurately explains its specific output, because the volume of its air fuel mixture put through a complete power stroke per revolution is directly responsible for torque, and thus the power produced.|$|E

This involves closing the intake valve midway through the intake stroke. Air/fuel demands are so low at low-load conditions and the work required to fill the cylinder is relatively high, so Early intake valve closing greatly reduces <b>pumping</b> <b>losses.</b> [...] Studies have shown early intake valve closing reduces <b>pumping</b> <b>losses</b> by 40%, and increases fuel economy by 7%.

2500|$|Introduced in 2009 as a 2010 {{model year}} vehicle, the RX 450h (GLV10/GLV15) premiered {{alongside}} its non-hybrid counterpart, the RX 350.

The RX 450h {{was scheduled to}} go on sale in the U.S. in mid to late 2009, with sales introductions for the RX 450h in Asia (including Japan) and Europe in the same year. The RX 450h features an upgraded 3.5L 2GR-FXE V6 engine (shared with the RX 350) which produces [...] at 6000 rpm, along with a new inverter which boosts total horsepower to [...] (with the electric motors providing an added [...] ). The new inverter is 8kg lighter, and more efficient. Up to three electric motors {{are used in the}} hybrid system, including two dual motors for the forward wheels (123kW output), and a third for the rear wheels on the AWD model (50kW; engages when slippage is detected or the throttle pressed firmly). The RX 450h's V6 engine now runs on the Atkinson cycle for added efficiency. Compared to the prior Otto cycle system, the Atkinson cycle has a lower compression ratio, along with higher expansion ratio inside engine cylinders. This system uses less energy to form fuel-air mixtures, and releases more energy. A lighter, more free-flowing oil (0W-20) is also used, reducing friction energy loss and oil pump power requirements. Two additional systems are added to the RX 450h's Lexus Hybrid Drive powertrain, an exhaust heat recovery system to reduce engine warm-up periods (optimizing engine start-stop times, particularly in cold conditions), and a cooled exhaust gas-recirculation system to reduce fuel <b>pumping</b> <b>loss.</b> The electric motors use the first automotive application of liquid cooling {{on both sides of the}} high-current transistors, allowing greater contribution from the electric motors versus the gasoline engine.|$|E

50|$|The free-piston linear generator's great {{versatility}} {{comes from}} {{the absence of a}} crankshaft, removing a great <b>pumping</b> <b>loss,</b> giving the engine a further degree of freedom. The combustion can be two-stroke engine or four-stroke engine. However, a four-stroke requires a much higher intermediate storage of energy, the rotational inertia of the crankshaft, to propel the piston through the four strokes. With the absence of a crankshaft, a gas spring would need to power the piston through the intake, compression and exhaustion stokes. Hence the reason why most of the current research focuses on the two-strokes cycle.|$|E
50|$|Unavoidably, {{some of the}} fluid's {{kinetic energy}} will be lost due to {{friction}} and turbulence, causing the converter to generate waste heat (dissipated in many applications by water cooling). This effect, {{often referred to as}} <b>pumping</b> <b>loss,</b> will be most pronounced at or near stall conditions.

50|$|MIVEC {{switches}} {{to the higher}} cam profile as engine speed increases, and drops back to the lower cam profile as engine speed decreases. The reduced valve overlap in low-speed mode provides stable idling, while accelerated timing of the intake valve's closing reduces backflow to improve volumetric efficiency, which helps increase engine output as well as reduce lift friction. High-speed mode {{takes advantage of the}} pulsating intake effect created by the mode's high lift and retarded timing of intake valve closure. The resulting reduced <b>pumping</b> <b>loss</b> of the larger valve overlap yields higher power output and a reduction in friction.

5000|$|Heavier fuels like {{diesel fuel}} have higher cetane ratings and lower octane ratings, {{resulting}} in increased tendency to ignite spontaneously and burn {{completely in the}} cylinders when injected. Increased compression ratios create higher combustion chamber temperatures to ignite the injected fuel. Higher compression ratios increase pumping losses as more work is required to compress intake air to a smaller volume, but <b>pumping</b> <b>loss</b> increases are offset by increased power and efficiency. Increasing compression ratios in spark-ignition engines requires higher octane fuels that are harder to ignite and burn completely and/or advanced spark timing to avoid pre-ignition, knocking and resulting performance losses and engine damage. Power gains from increased compression ratios are reduced in spark-ignition engines while the pumping losses remain comparable to similar compression ratio increases in diesel engines.|$|E
5000|$|In 2001, BMW {{introduced}} the Valvetronic system. The Valvetronic system can continuously and precisely vary intake valve lift, and in addition, the independent Double VANOS system can concurrently vary the timing {{for both the}} intake and exhaust valves.

Furthermore, both systems can also be combined with BMW DIVA (Differentiated Variable Air Intake) system which is the world's first continuously variable length intake manifold.

50|$|An engine {{has many}} moving parts that produce {{friction}}. Some of these friction forces remain constant (as long as applied load is constant); {{some of these}} friction losses increase as engine speed increases, such as piston side forces and connecting bearing forces (due to increased inertia forces from the oscillating piston). A few friction forces decrease at higher speed, such as the friction force on the cam's lobes used to operate the inlet and outlet valves (the valves' inertia at high speed tends to pull the cam follower away from the cam lobe). Along with friction forces, an operating engine has pumping losses, which is the work required to move air {{into and out of}} the cylinders. This <b>pumping</b> <b>loss</b> is minimal at low speed, but increases approximately as the square of the speed, until at rated power an engine is using about 20% of total power production to overcome friction and pumping losses.|$|E
40|$|There {{are many}} {{technologies}} that being developed {{to increase the}} efficiency of internal combustion engines as well as reducing their fuel consumption. In this paper, the main area of focus is on cylinder deactivation (CDA) technology. CDA is mostly being applied on multi cylinders engines. CDA has the advantage to improve fuel consumption by reducing <b>pumping</b> <b>losses</b> at part load engine conditions. Here, the application of CDA on 1. 6 L four cylinders gasoline engine is studied. One-dimensional (1 D) engine modeling work is performed to investigate the effect of intake valve strategy on engine performance with CDA. 1 D engine model is constructed based on the 1. 6 L actual engine geometries. The model is simulated at various engine speeds at full load conditions. The simulated results show that the constructed model is well correlated to measured data. This correlated model is then used to investigate the CDA application at part load conditions. Also, the effects on the in-cylinder combustion as well as <b>pumping</b> <b>losses</b> are presented.

50|$|Some modern {{internal}} combustion engines (such as some BMW engines) {{do not use}} a traditional throttle, instead relying on their variable intake valve timing system to regulate the airflow into the cylinders, although {{the end result is}} the same, albeit with less <b>pumping</b> <b>losses.</b>|$|R
25|$|A {{four-stroke}} cylinder {{produces a}} power stroke only every other {{rotation of the}} crankshaft, with three strokes being <b>pumping</b> <b>losses.</b> This doubles the real surface-to-volume ratio for the four-stroke reciprocating piston engine and the displacement increased. The Wankel, therefore, has higher volumetric efficiency and lower <b>pumping</b> <b>losses</b> through the absence of choking valves. Because of the quasi-overlap of the power strokes, that cause the smoothness of the engine and the avoidance of the four-stroke cycle in a reciprocating engine, the Wankel engine is very quick to react to power increases, giving a quick delivery of power when the demand arises, especially at higher rpm's. This difference is more pronounced when compared to four-cylinder reciprocating engines and less pronounced when compared to higher cylinder counts.|$|R
50|$|Cylinder {{deactivation}} is used {{to reduce}} the fuel consumption and emissions of an internal combustion engine during light-load operation. In typical light-load driving the driver uses only around 30 percent of an engineâs maximum power. In these conditions, the throttle valve is nearly closed, and the engine needs to work to draw air. This causes an inefficiency known as <b>pumping</b> <b>loss.</b> Some large capacity engines need to be throttled so much at light load that the cylinder pressure at top dead centre is approximately half that of a small 4-cylinder engine. Low cylinder pressure results in lower fuel efficiency. The use of cylinder deactivation at light load means there are fewer cylinders drawing air from the intake manifold, which works to increase its fluid (air) pressure. Operation without variable displacement is wasteful because fuel is continuously pumped into each cylinder and combusted even though maximum performance is not required. By shutting down half of an engine's cylinders, the amount of fuel being consumed is much less. Between reducing the pumping losses, which increases pressure in each operating cylinder, and decreasing the amount of fuel being pumped into the cylinders, fuel consumption can be reduced by 8 to 25 percent in highway conditions.|$|E
