These include the environmental stability, homogeneity and bulk properties, connection procedures, and costs.

Costs are still prohibitive for all but the most demanding applications. None of these problems, however, appear to be unsolvable, and their solution may result in wide spread GOC application.

In the first part, {{a review of the}} hierarchical voltage control in the system is given, because the coordinated reactive power regulator (GRRS) has to be embedded in future processes of voltage control automatisation on higher levels and 'smart' control in the power system. For the needs of studying the HV <b>bus</b> <b>bars</b> voltage control, as well as reactive power allocation within the power plant in manual and automatic control mode, a series of simulations was performed. For verification purposes, the simulation results are compared to the on-site measurements. An excellent match of simulated and recorded results is achieved...|$|R
40|$|Critical {{medium voltage}} {{substations}} are often fed {{by at least}} 2 transformers. When the short-circuit power reaches unacceptable levels, a system with automatic switchovers can provide a solution. With this system, each transformer feeds its own <b>bus</b> <b>bar</b> (see Fig. 1). The transformers are able to feed both <b>bus</b> <b>bars</b> (e. g. for maintenance). When one transformer breaks down, the other will take over its <b>bus</b> <b>bar,</b> but only after the voltage has dropped. To avoid this voltage drop, a DC coupling between both <b>bus</b> <b>bars</b> could be used. This link only adds {{a limited amount of}} short circuit power and is able to take over the other <b>bus</b> <b>bar</b> immediately, to exchange an arbitrary amount of <b>power</b> between the <b>bus</b> <b>bars,</b> etc [...] . The technology (back-to-back converter) already exists, but the application is unknown to the major manufacturers.

These effects have important consequences, including a rise of the ac resistance, which in turn increases power loss, thus limiting the rating for the conductor.

The bakeout system is designed for two modes of operation. The first mode allows heating of the first wall components to 350 degrees C while the external vessel is cooled to 150 degrees C. The second mode cools the first wall to 150 degrees C and the external vessel to 50 degrees C. The system uses a low viscosity heat transfer oil which is capable of high temperature low pressure operation. The NSTX Torus Vacuum Pumping System (TVPS) is designed to achieve a base pressure of approximately 1 x 10 (superscript - 8) Torr and to evacuate the plasma fuel gas loads in less than 5 minutes between discharges. The vacuum pumping system is capable of a pumping speed of approximately 3400 l/s for deuterium. The hardware consists of two turbo molecular pumps (TMPs) and a mechanical pump set consisting of a mechanical and a Roots blower pump. A PLC is used as the control system to provide remote monitoring, control and software interlock capability.

40|$|The {{present day}} {{scenario}} of {{electrical power system}} engineering mainly encompasses the problems like power paucity, blackout, load shedding, ineptness of meeting the necessary demand of power etc. Hence new power plants are built or old ones are expanded and upgraded. Power flow analysis plays an integral role in both the above cases. Power flow analysis equips power system engineers with all the essential data for building a secure, stable and reliable power system. Power flow analysis tells about the line flows of active and reactive <b>power</b> and <b>bus</b> <b>bar</b> values of voltage magnitude and phase difference. The practical application of load flow analysis is exploited by converting it to Optimal Power Flow (OPF) analysis. There has been significant development in research fields of power generation plants and transmission and distribution systems. Although these developments {{play a key role}} in today’s scenario, there still remains a field where the scope of development still persists. Loads in general are taken as constant sinks for both active and reactive power; where in reality, the load power consumption is very much dependent on voltage magnitude and frequency deviations. OPF analysis incorporating load modeling is a major tool for minimizing transmission and generation losses, generation cost and maximizing the system efficiency. System security and accuracy are also increased by incorporation of load models. This thesis focuses on incorporating load models in traditional OPF studies and comparing the results of the above with those obtained from OPF analysis without the incorporation of load models. ...|$|R

40|$|With the {{extensive}} implementation of power circuit devices, mainly rectifier, inverters, switches in power system and manufacturing industries results in serious problem {{relating to the}} quality of power. One of the major issues is a production of harmonics for current and voltage causing alteration in output waveform, voltage-distortion, voltage degrading, equipment local heating, etc. Loads which are non-linear such as UPS, SMPS, and speed drives results in production of harmonics in current waveform. These draws in the component of current having reactive <b>power</b> from the <b>bus</b> <b>bar,</b> and thus, causes an imbalance in bus current waveform. Hence to eliminate the problems of harmonics we need to compensate the component of harmonic causing such trouble. With all the existing methods used, one of the method being minimizing harmonic in power utility via SAPF. Hence this Paper suggests a complete analysis of SAPF performance by applying two current control strategies. First being instantaneous active and reactive power theory (p-q) and second being synchronous frame reference theory (d-q) and analyzing their overall performance to select one of the above methods. Harmonic current controller is described and used which provides correct gating signals for the IGBT based inverter nad thus helps in eliminating harmonic components.

40|$|AbstractWith {{decreasing}} module {{prices on}} the spot market, the cost of silver is {{getting more and more}} important in solar cell fabrication. Silver is necessary for the front side metallization and the rear side <b>bus</b> <b>bar</b> metallization in a solar cell. The front side benefits from the good conductivity of silver whereas the rear side <b>bus</b> <b>bars</b> need the low oxidation degree and thus the good solderability of this noble metal. We replace silver <b>bus</b> <b>bars</b> by a metal paste containing a combination of different metals with a silver content below 40 %. Thus we reach a silver reduction of 30 % compared to conventional rear <b>bus</b> <b>bar</b> metal paste. Multi crystalline silicon solar cells with the new paste achieve identical efficiencies compared to cells with silver reference pastes, tested on 150 cells per batch. The new paste simply replaces conventional rear <b>bus</b> <b>bar</b> metal pastes and passes the common tests. Reliability tests are in progress at the moment.

A great on line monitoring would provide fault diagnosis, optimal use and quality management. However, diagnosis is, until today, mainly based on vibration analysis and/or motor current signature analysis (weel known as MCSA). This paper presents a new approach in the whole electrical drive diagnosis thought original measurements. The first part shows that the measures of the electromagnetic field emitted on the DC <b>bus</b> <b>bar</b> of the inverter can provide a relevant signature for the spectral analysis of the power drive.

40|$|<b>Bus</b> <b>bars</b> on {{solar cells}} shade silicon from light. When the <b>bus</b> <b>bars</b> are patterned, they can reflect light {{back onto the}} silicon using total {{internal}} reflection. These patterned <b>bus</b> <b>bars</b> are tin plated and produce 1 - 2. 5 % improvement in module efficiency [6]. There is a potential for even greater improvement by using higher reflectivity metal plating on the <b>bus</b> <b>bars.</b> Silver is the most reflective of all metals, but is also very expensive. We tested to see if silver would actually be as reflective as published values and if silver could redirect {{a substantial amount of}} light using total internal reflection. We found that silver plating followed the published spectral dependence curve with little deviation, and would reflect 18. 4 % more light than the published values for tin. Plating 2. 24 microns resulted in 94. 9 % of reflected light undergoing TIR; the most reflected light of any tested material. Finally, given the current cost of silver is $ 430 per kilogram and the variable cost of a solar cell is $ 2 per Watt, the maximum allowable thickness we could afford to plate is 44. 8 microns. In our testing, plating as little as 0. 35 microns produced a very high light capture.
