Natural rubber (NR) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} agriculture products of Thailand, which is an important material with unique and special characteristics used in wide range of applications such as mechanical properties, excellent strength, and elasticity. However, it is inferior in oil resistance due to the presence of hydrogen and carbon in its structure. This inherent drawback of NR has limited its application in industry. In order to expand the use of NR, this research is interested to improve the oil resistance of NR without loss of outstanding properties by grafting NR with <b>acrylonitrile</b> (AN) <b>monomer</b> to form the nano-matrix structure.

It was found that increasing the final pH and total iron salts concentration increased saturation magnetization, but the variation of ammonium hydroxide concentration did not change the saturation magnetization. In contrast, the saturation magnetization decreased from 80. 23 emu/g to 64. 83 emu/g when the addition rate of ammonium hydroxide was increased from 5 ml/min to 20 ml/min. The reduction of saturation magnetization for these samples was due to decrease in the crystallite size of the particles with increasing addition rate. Additional continuous efforts were made to further improve the dispersion stability of magnetite nanoparticles in aqueous media by modifying the magnetite surface using surface modifiers (e. g., polyethylene glycol, oleic acid) to generate an effective repulsive force in between particles. It was found that the resultant MNPs incorporated with oleic acid demonstrated a maximum stability in maintaining good colloidal dispersion. This MNPs colloidal suspension performance was approximately 7 times higher (21 days) than the uncoated MNPs (3 days). The reason can be mainly attributed to the formation of oleate secondary layer in the bilayer oleic acid coated MNPs that enabled the MNPs to be well dispersed in <b>polar</b> (<b>acrylonitrile)</b> and non-polar (butadiene) parts of the building block of nitrile latex. In addition, the oleic acid coating layer could reduce the oxidation reaction that trigger phase transition as compared with PEG coating.

A K 2 S 2 O 8 /FeSO 4 redox system was used in the presence of air. The graft yield and grafting efficiency increased with the increase of monomer, initiator and reaction time up to certain values, thereafter it decreased.

The maximum graft yield with acrylonitrile and methacrylonitrile, under optimized conditions, was 19.78 and 43.15 %, respectively. The graft yield of methacrylonitrile is greater than that of acrylonitrile. This is due to the –CH 3 group present in methacrylonitrile.

40|$|A {{study has}} been made of the {{copolymerisation}} behaviour of <b>acrylonitrile</b> with the <b>monomers</b> methyl acrylate and vinylidene chloride respectively. The project arose from reports by workers at Courtauld's Ltd. that the lengths of the sequences of the monomer units in certain copolymers of acrylonitrile and vinylidene chloride were longer than predicted by statistical considerations. The copolymerisation of methyl acrylate with acrylonitrile was studied to examine the possibility of a preferential swelling of polymer particles by one monomer during polymerisation. Copolymerisation was carried out in three different solvents, and unsuccessful attempts were made to measure the sequence lengths in the polymers directly using NMR spectroscopy. Only compositional analysis was possible by this means, but measurements of the thermal properties of the polymers indicated that the sequence lengths were short in all cases. It was found that the Alfrey-Lewis copolymerisation equation was obeyed when the reaction was carried out homogeneously in dimethylformamide, but it was not obeyed when it was carried out heterogeneously in hexane or butanol. The copolymerisation of acrylonitrile with vinylidene chloride was studied in several different solvents, and also in mixed solvent systems. Sequence lengths were measured by NMR spectroscopy, and were found to be short for all methods of preparation. In no case was the Alfrey-Lewis copolymer equation obeyed, even in those solvent systems for which the reaction was homogeneous. The preparation of copolymers homogeneously in dimethylformamide showed the least deviation from the simple copolymer equation; for some of the systems used the results could be fitted to the equation derived by Merz et al. in which the effect of the penultimate group in the polymer chain is considered. The problems in setting up a model for heterogeneous polymerisation have been discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to develop polyacrylonitrile (PAN) -based hollow fiber ultrafiltration (UF) membranes with improved anti-fouling properties for wastewater treatment. The prepared membranes were characterized with respect to their morphological structure, surface chemical composition, surface roughness, and hydrophilicity to investigate the impact of the membrane properties on the separation and anti-fouling performance. In the first stage of this study, PAN-based hollow fiber membranes incorporated with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) were fabricated. Experimental results indicated that the resultant membranes demonstrated a trade-off between their separation and anti-fouling performances. Therefore, for the second stage, PAN-g-PVA graft copolymers of different properties (i. e. CP 5, CP 10 and CP 15) were synthesized via ceric (Ce(IV)) -initiated free radical polymerization by using different <b>acrylonitrile</b> (AN) <b>monomer</b> weights (5, 10, 15 g of AN per 10 g of PVA) and incorporated in the hollow fiber membranes. Obtained results revealed that the copolymer properties (i. e. number of PVA repeating units (nPVA)) significantly influenced the overall membrane properties. The highest pure water flux (179 L/m 2. h. bar) was achieved by the membrane incorporated with graft copolymer of the highest nPVA of 70 due to the increase in hydrophilicity, pore size and porosity, and surface roughness. Thirdly, the investigation on the effect of the graft copolymer compositions in dope solution on the membrane properties and performances was carried out by using the best performance graft copolymer (CP 10). The membrane properties and performance were significantly altered using the different copolymer composition. Membranes with the highest copolymer content demonstrated the highest water flux of 297 L/m 2. h when tested at 1 bar which attributed to the changes in the membrane morphology, surface roughness and hydrophilicity. Overall, it was summarized that the UF performance and fouling property were mostly affected by the pore structure of the membrane and partly by the membranes physical properties (i. e. degree of PVA surface coverage and surface roughness) during filtration of bovine serum albumin (BSA), albumin from chicken egg white (EA) and trypsin. In the final stage, three different membranes; CP 5 (incorporated with graft copolymer with nPVA of 68 at PAN:PAN-g-PVA weight ratio of 90 : 10), CP 10 - 10 (incorporated with CP 10 graft copolymer with nPVA of 25 at PAN:PAN-g- PVA weight ratio of 90 : 10) and CP 10 - 5 (incorporated with CP 10 graft copolymer with nPVA of 25 at PAN: PAN-g-PVA weight ratio of 95 : 5), which demonstrated among the highest flux recovery during proteins filtration, were subjected to a feasibility study for natural rubber (NR) effluent treatment. The highest flux recovery of 84 % could be achieved by CP 10 - 10 membrane using hydraulic cleansing and its properties are summarized as follows: 62. 73 º contact angle, 34. 3 % degree PVA surface coverage, 43. 5 nm root mean square surface roughness (Rq), 30 - 72 nm pore size and 23 % porosity. It can also be inferred that the pore size and pore size distribution gave profound influence on the membrane fouling resistance during NR filtration. In addition, all the membranes showed remarkable performances in reducing turbidity (> 99 %) and colour (> 97 %). Reduction of 68 - 70 % total proteins, 29 - 38 % chemical oxygen demand (COD), 14 - 32 % total organic carbon (TOC), 8 - 11 % total dissolved solid (TDS) and 7 - 8 % conductivity were achieved by the membranes depending on the membrane properties...|$|R
40|$|The {{liquid phase}} removal of low {{concentrations}} of <b>polar</b> compounds (acetonitrile, <b>acrylonitrile</b> and dioxane) from toluene by adsorption on zeolites reveals very high selectivity factors. Kinetic selectivity factors {{as high as}} 16, 100 are observed. The selection of the zeolites (MFI, MWW and FAU type) allowed {{the study of the}} effects of varying aluminum content, the presence and absence of acidic centers and varying pore volumes. The equilibrium data show that the effectiveness of liquid-phase polar compound adsorption using H-ZSM- 5 increases with the number of Bronsted acid sites which are proportional to the alumina content. Also on a per cation basis, the H-ZSM- 5 and H-MCM- 22 protonic zeolites appear to have higher selectivity for these polar adsorbates than the metal cation. With similar porous structures and alumina content, the H-ZSM- 5 and H-MCM- 22 show similar adsorption behavior. ^ To assess the relative effectiveness of each adsorbent, equilibrium batch, kinetic batch and continuous flow experiments were conducted. The zeolites H-ZSM- 5, H-MCM- 22, H-mordenite and Na-X are highly effective in removing the polar compounds from toluene to a concentration level down to less than 20 ppm (detection limit). ^ The liquid-phase effective diffusion coefficients of acrylonitrile, acetonitrile and dioxane were estimated by matching simulations to kinetic batch experimental data using both the Pore Diffusion Control (PDC) model and the Surface Diffusion Control (SDC) model. The PDC described the kinetic behavior better and the diffusivities show the order of Deff(Ace.) 3 ̆e Deff(Acr.) 3 ̆e Deff(Dio.) which is consistent with the literature data on the respective diffusivities in water. ^ The adsorption isotherms were described by various isotherm equations. The best-fit parameters obtained from the Langmuir equation were incorporated into the fixed-bed adsorption simulation. A mathematical model was established to simulate single-solute fixed-bed adsorption. An orthogonal collocation method was employed to solve the partial differential equations. The behaviors of the fixed-bed adsorption systems were successfully described using this model with only the effective diffusion coefficient as the adjustable parameter. The model was then extended to the two-solute adsorption system. By applying the information derived from the single-solute systems, simulation results were obtained that matched the experimental data qualitatively well. ...|$|R
40|$|The direct {{catalytic}} hydrogenation of acrylonitrile-butadiene-rubber in latex form was studied {{for the development}} of a simple process for the modification of unsaturated diene-based polymers. Acrylonitrile-butadiene-rubber, known as NBR, is a rubber synthesized from <b>acrylonitrile</b> and butadiene (<b>monomers)</b> via copolymerization. It has been widely utilized as oil resistant rubber components in industry. Selective hydrogenation of the residual carbon-carbon double bonds (C=Cs) in the NBR backbone could improve its physical and chemical properties which greatly extend its range of application and lifetime. However, the current hydrogenation procedure involves a number of cumbersome steps which substantially increase the production cost. Hence, it is worthwhile developing new technology which HNBR could be synthesized in a cheaper and environmentally friendly way. Considerable efforts have been undertaken to realize this goal. Among them, hydrogenation of commercial NBR latex becomes especially attractive and promising. Direct hydrogenation of NBR in the latex not only avoids using large amounts of organic solvent which is required in polymer solution hydrogenation but also produces hydrogenated-NBR (HNBR) in the latex form which can be utilized for painting or coating. It has been reported that the commercial NBR latex could successfully be hydrogenated using RhCl(PPh 3) 3 with added triphenylphosphine (PPh 3). High quality HNBR latex was obtained after the reaction. However, the hydrophobicity of RhCl(PPh 3) 3 and PPh 3 greatly restrict their separation and diffusion in the NBR latex, resulting in a very low activity in the heterogeneous NBR latex system. In order to improve the process of NBR latex hydrogenation using the RhCl(PPh 3) 3 /PPh 3 catalytic system, an in-situ hydrogenation process was developed where RhCl(PPh 3) 3 was directly synthesized from the water-soluble catalyst precursor RhCl 3 and PPh 3 in the NBR latex. The catalyst precursor RhCl 3 is soluble in the aqueous phase of the NBR latex and PPh 3 was well dispersed in the aqueous NBR latex after adding small amounts of alcohol. Compared with using pre-made solid catalyst, the in-situ synthesized catalyst in the NBR latex could quickly be transported into the polymer particles and faster hydrogenation reaction was observed. In addition, the influence of various operational conditions on the hydrogenation rate; such as catalyst concentration, latex system composition, reaction temperature and hydrogen pressure have been studied. With the success of NBR latex hydrogenation using RhCl(PPh 3) 3 catalyst, two water-soluble analogs of RhCl(PPh 3) 3, RhCl(TPPMS) 3 (TPPMS = Monosulfonated Triphenylphosphane) and RhCl(TPPTS) 3, (TPPTS = Trisulfonated Triphenylphosphane) were then used for NBR latex hydrogenation. It was found that the difference of their solubility in water greatly affected their activities in NBR latex hydrogenation. Successful hydrogenation was achieved using the RhCl(TPPMS) 3 catalyst while only low conversion was observed when using the RhCl(TPPTS) 3 catalyst. The catalysts retention in the polymer is also in agreement with the reaction results. High conversion could only be achieved when the catalyst diffused into the polymer particles in the latex. Using the RhCl(TPPMS) 3, the reaction could be carried out in a temperature range of 70 °C to 120 °C. And no co-catalyst ligand (i. e. TPPMS) was required for catalyst diffusion or reaction. In addition, the effects of the particle size of the NBR latex and the molecular weight of NBR (gel fraction) on hydrogenation were also investigated using lab made “in-house” NBR latices. It was found that the hydrogenation reaction was much faster with smaller particle size. It was also observed that the gel fraction in the latex particles greatly influenced the mobility of the polymer chains within the particles. In addition to the rhodium based catalysts, ruthenium based catalysts have also been investigated for NBR latex hydrogenation. With the recent findings of the hydrogenation activity of the Grubbs type metathesis catalyst, the hydrogenation of NBR latex was studied first using the second generation of Grubbs catalyst (G 2). It was found using the G 2 catalyst with small addition of organic solvent such as mono-chlorobenzene (MCB) to dissolve the catalyst resulted in a successful hydrogenation in NBR latex. Meanwhile, the metathesis activity of the G 2 catalyst was also measured during the hydrogenation reaction. Comparing with conventional ruthenium catalysts, the multifunctional G 2 catalyst benefited the NBR latex hydrogenation process by controlling its molecular weight change. The increase of molecular weight within hydrogenation reaction was partially offset by a synchronous metathesis reaction between NBR and the added of chain transfer agent (CTA). As a result, no visible gel was observed in the final HNBR product. In addition, the kinetic behavior of the hydrogenation was systematically studied with respect to the catalyst concentration, hydrogen pressure as well as NBR concentration. The apparent activation energy over the temperature range of 80 - 130 °C for the hydrogenation of metathesized NBR was also measured. Further experiments showed that the second generation of Hoveyda-Grubbs catalyst (HG 2) could be employed for the NBR latex hydrogenation even without adding any organic co-solvent to dissolve the catalyst. Although HG 2 catalyst is insoluble in water, it could be well dispersed in aqueous system with the addition of certain surfactants. A fast {{catalytic hydrogenation}} (e. g. TOF > 7000 h- 1 at 95 mol. % conversion) was achieved and successful hydrogenation was still observed under very low catalyst concentration. Compared with using G 2 catalyst, the degree of metathesis reaction under HG 2 in this organic solvent free process was very limited. As a result of this research project, different catalysts were successfully developed for hydrogenation of NBR in latex. A significant milestone was achieved in improving polymer hydrogenation technology. 1 yea...|$|R
