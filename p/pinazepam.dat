50|$|<b>Pinazepam</b> {{differs from}} other benzodiazepines {{in that it}} has a {{propargyl}} group at the N-1 position of the benzodiazepine structure. It is less toxic than diazepam and in animal studies it appears to produce anxiolytic and anti-agitation properties with limited hypnotic and motor coordination impairing properties. <b>Pinazepam</b> is rapidly absorbed after oral administration. The main active metabolites of <b>pinazepam</b> are depropargylpinazepam (N-desmethyldiazepam, nordazepam) and oxazepam. In humans <b>pinazepam</b> acts as a pure anxiolytic agent in that it does not possess to any significant degree the other pharmacological characteristics of benzodiazepines. Its lack of intellectual, motor and hypnotic impairing effects makes it more appropriate than other benzodiazepines for day time use. The elimination half-life is longer in the elderly.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pinazepam</b> (marketed {{under the}} brand name Domar and Duna) is a drug that is a benzodiazepine. It {{possesses}} anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, sedative and skeletal muscle relaxant properties.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pinazepam</b> and its {{metabolite}} N-desmethyldiazepam {{are transferred}} to the developing fetus in utero, but the plasma drug level in the mother is usually significantly {{higher than in the}} fetus.|$|E
50|$|Nordazepam (INN; marketed under {{brand names}} Nordaz, Stilny, Madar, Vegesan, and Calmday; {{also known as}} nordiazepam, desoxydemoxepam, and desmethyldiazepam) is a 1,4-{{benzodiazepine}} derivative. Like other benzodiazepine derivatives, it has amnesic, anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, muscle relaxant, and sedative properties. However, it is used primarily {{in the treatment of}} anxiety disorders. It is an active metabolite of diazepam, chlordiazepoxide, clorazepate, prazepam, <b>pinazepam,</b> and medazepam.|$|E
40|$|A {{new method}} is {{described}} for the {{qualitative and quantitative}} analysis of midazolam, a short-acting 1, 4 -imidazole benzodiazepine, in human plasma. It involves a plasma deproteinization step, solid-phase microextraction (SPME) of midazolam using an 85 -microm polyacrylate fiber, and its detection by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) in selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode, using <b>pinazepam</b> as internal standard. The assay is linear over a midazolam plasma range of 1. 5 - 300 ng/mL, relative intra- and inter-assay standard deviations at 5 ng/mL are below 7 %, and the limit of detection is 1 ng/mL. The method is simple, fast and sufficiently sensitive to be applied in clinical and forensic toxicology {{as well as for}} purposes of therapeutic drug monitoring...|$|E
40|$|The {{anticonvulsant}} {{properties of}} several 1, 4 -benzodiazepine and azirino[1, 2 -d][1, 4]benzodiazepine (ABDZ) derivatives were studied after intraperitoneal (IP) administration in DBA/ 2 mice (a strain genetically susceptible to sound-induced seizures) and in Swiss mice. The anticonvulsant effects were evaluated on seizures evoked {{by means of}} auditory stimulation (109 dB, 12 - 16 kHz) in animals placed singly under a hemispheric Perspex dome or on seizures induced by administration of pentylenetetrazole. The 1, 4 -benzodiazepines were generally more potent than the related ABDZ derivatives. The rank order of potency for anticonvulsant activity was flunitrazepam > diazepam > <b>pinazepam</b> > ABDZ 5 > ABDZ 4 > prazepam > halazepam > ABDZ 1 > ABDZ 3 > camazepam > ABDZ 6 > ABDZ 2. The impairment of locomotor performance following IP administration of these derivatives was also evaluated {{by means of the}} rotarod test. The rank order of potency for impairment of coordinated motor movements was <b>pinazepam</b> > flunitrazepam > diazepam > ABDZ 5 > prazepam > halazepam > ABDZ 4 > ABDZ 3 > ABDZ 1 > camazepam > ABDZ 2 = ABDZ 6. The potency of various 1, 4 -benzodiazepines and ABDZs as inhibitors of specific [3 H]flumazenil binding to membranes from cerebellum or cortex was evaluated. In general, ABDZs were active as anticonvulsants and inhibited [3 H]flumazenil binding in the micromolar range. Radioligand binding studies carried out in stable cell lines demonstrated that none of the ABDZs tested showed a particular subtype specificity. The pharmacological actions of ABDZ 4 and ABDZ 5, which appeared to be the most potent ABDZs as anticonvulsants, were significantly reduced by treatment with flumazenil (8. 24 mumol/kg IP), suggesting a clear involvement of benzodiazepine mechanisms in the anticonvulsant activity of these compounds or their metabolites. The anticonvulsant activity of ABDZ 4 and ABDZ 5 was also evaluated against seizures induced in DBA/ 2 mice by two beta-carbolines: methyl-beta-carboline- 3 -carboxylate (beta-CCM) and methyl- 6, 6 -dimethoxy- 4 -ethyl-beta-carboline- 3 -carboxylate (DMCM). Both ABDZ 4 and ABDZ 5 give better protection against seizures induced by beta-CCM than DMCM, suggesting a preferential action on the benzodiazepine receptor subtype BDZ 1...|$|E
40|$|A simple chromatographic {{procedure}} is {{reported for the}} determination of some less prescribed but equally important benzodiazepines (Clotiazepam, clozapine and <b>pinazepam)</b> in serum. The optimization studies {{have been made in}} CN, C 18 and C 8 columns, using mobile phase containing sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) modified with either propanol, butanol or pentanol. The method proposed for the determination of the three benzodiazepines using a mobile phase of 0. 13 M SDS, 2. 4 % pentanol- 0. 01 M phosphate buffer- 0. 1 % triethylamine (pH 7) at 25 °C and UV detection (240 nm) in a C 8 column. The serum samples was injected directly, without any pretreatment, eluted in less than 8 min, in accordance to their relative polarities, as indicated by their octanol-water partition coefficients. The limits of detection (ng/mL) was in the 1. 6 to 5. 6 and 7 to 87 range, for aqueous and serum samples, respectively. Repeatability and intermediate precision was tested for three different concentrations of the drugs, resulting in the 0. 1 to 2 range. The results obtained here for the separation of the three benzodiazepines in serum were also counter checked at Department of Bio-analytical Chemistry, Universitat Jaume I, Castelló, Spain...|$|E
40|$|Phenobarbitone-pretreated male Sprague-Dawley rat liver microsomes {{were used}} to examine C-hydroxylation and N-dealkylation of four {{clinically}} important benzodiazepines: diazepam (DZP), prazepam (PZP), <b>pinazepam</b> (PIN) and halazepam (HZP). These substrates differ only {{in the nature of}} the N-substituent of the B ring and N-desmethyldiazepam (DMD) is the N-dealkylation product in each case. C-Hydroxylation was accordingly also studied with DMD as substrate. All monooxygenations were studied with substrates at a concentration of 10 μM, in the absence of solubilizing agents, and under conditions where the production of secondary metabolites was minimized. A 20 -fold variation in the rate of C-hydroxylation was recorded across the five substrates with HZP showing the highest rate and DMD showing the lowest rate. An almost equally large range of variation was shown for the N-dealkylation reaction, with PZP undergoing this biotransformation more than 17 times faster than DZP. Log P values (a measure of lipophilicity) for the five substrates were determined using an HPLC method and a remarkable lack of correspondence between this substrate parameter and either of the monooxygenations was noted. This suggests that multiple substrate determinants govern the relative rates of these monooxygenations. It was, however, notable that the additive rate of metabolism of these substrates by both monooxygenase routes did show an excellent correlation with substrate lipophilicity...|$|E
40|$|Editorial Group: Cochrane Musculoskeletal Group. Published Online: 18 JAN 2012. Assessed as up-to-date: 6 SEP 2011 BACKGROUND Pain {{management}} {{is a high}} priority for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Muscle relaxants include drugs that reduce muscle spasm (for example benzodiazepines such as diazepam (Valium), alprazolam (Xanax), lorazepam (Ativan) and non-benzodiazepines such as metaxalone (Skelaxin) or a combination of paracetamol and orphenadrine (Muscol)) and drugs that prevent increased muscle tone (baclofen and dantrolene). Despite a paucity of evidence supporting their use, antispasmodic and antispasticity muscle relaxants have gained widespread clinical acceptance as adjuvants in the management of patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain. OBJECTIVES The aim of this review was to determine the efficacy and safety of muscle relaxants in pain management in patients with RA. The muscle relaxants that were included in this review are the antispasmodic benzodiazepines (alprazolam, bromazepam, chlordiazepoxide,cinolazepam, clonazepam, cloxazolam, clorazepate, diazepam, estazolam, flunitrazepam, flurazepam, flutoprazepam, halazepam, ketazolam, loprazolam, lorazepam, lormetazepam, medazepam, midazolam, nimetazepam, nitrazepam, nordazepam, oxazepam, <b>pinazepam,</b> prazepam, quazepam, temazepam, tetrazepam, triazolam), antispasmodic non-benzodiazepines (cyclobenzaprine, carisoprodol, chlorzoxazone, meprobamate, methocarbamol, metaxalone, orphenadrine, tizanidine and zopiclone), and antispasticity drugs (baclofen and dantrolene sodium). SEARCH METHODS We performed a search of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, 4 th quarter 2010), MEDLINE (1950 to week 1 November 2010), EMBASE (Week 44 2010), and PsycINFO (1806 to week 2 November 2010). We also searched the 2008 to 2009 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) abstracts and performed a handsearch of reference lists of relevant articles. SELECTION CRITERIA We included randomised controlled trials which compared a muscle relaxant to another therapy (active, including non-pharmacological therapies, or placebo) in adult patients with RA and that reported at least one clinically relevant outcome. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two blinded review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias in the trials. Meta-analyses were used to examine the efficacy of muscle relaxants on pain, depression, sleep and function, as well as their safety. MAIN RESULTS Six trials (126 participants) were included in this review. All trials were rated at high risk of bias. Five cross-over trials evaluated a benzodiazepine, four assessed diazepam (n = 71) and one assessed triazolam (n = 15). The sixth trial assessed zopiclone (a non-benzodiazepine) (n = 40) and was a parallel group study. No trial duration was longer than two weeks while three single dose trials assessed outcomes at 24 hours only. Overall the included trials failed to find evidence of a beneficial effect of muscle relaxants over placebo, alone (at 24 hrs, 1 or 2 weeks) or in addition to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (at 24 hrs), on pain intensity, function, or quality of life. Data from two trials of longer than 24 hours duration (n = 74) (diazepam and zopiclone) found that participants who received a muscle relaxant had significantly more adverse events compared with those who received placebo (number needed to harm (NNTH) 3, 95 % CI 2 to 7). These were predominantly central nervous system side effects, including dizziness and drowsiness (NNTH 3, 95 % CI 2 to 11). AUTHORS’ CONCLUSIONS Based upon the currently available evidence in patients with RA, benzodiazepines (diazepam and triazolam) {{do not appear to be}} beneficial in improving pain over 24 hours or one week. The non-benzodiazepine agent zopiclone also did not significantly reduce pain over two weeks. However, even short term muscle relaxant use (24 hours to 2 weeks) is associated with significant adverse events, predominantly drowsiness and dizziness.
