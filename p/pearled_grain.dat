40|$|The {{extracts}} from six barley cultivars (Hordeum vulgarae L.) {{grown in the}} Canadian prairies, namely AC Metcalfe, Falcon, Phoenix, Tercel, Tyto, and Peregrine, were evaluated for their potential antioxidant, antiradical, and antiproliferative efficacies by various chemical and biological methods. Antioxidative compounds were solvent-extracted after optimizing extraction parameters (solvent composition, extraction temperature, and time) using response surface methodology (RSM). In addition, the distribution of antioxidative constituents in the barley grain was investigated by separately pearling two barley cultivars (Falcon and AC Metcalfe) into seven fractions (F 1 -F 7) in a layer-wise fashion up to 50 % of the kernel weight. Antioxidative efficacy of the layers and the remaining kernel (<b>pearled</b> <b>grain)</b> was evaluated using chemical and biological methods. Furthermore, phenolic compounds present in the six barley samples were separated into free, soluble conjugates, and insoluble-bound fractions using alkaline hydrolysis and the antioxidative potential {{of each of the}} fractions was also investigated. [...] The optimum conditions for extraction of antioxidative components from barley extracts were 80 % aqueous methanol, 60 °C, and 40 min as determined by RSM. Total phenolic content (TPC) of whole kernel extracts ranged from 13. 58 to 22. 93 and 0. 81 to 1. 38 mg ferulic acid equivalents per gram lyophilizate and defatted material, respectively. The order of TPC was Peregrine > AC Metcalfe > Falcon > Tyto > Phoenix > Tercel. Total antioxidant capacity (TAC), as measured by Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC), ranged from 3. 74 to 6. 82 μmol Trolox equivalents per gram defatted material. Antioxidant and antiradical efficacies of barley extracts were evaluated using different assays including 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), superoxide, oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORACFL), hydroxyl radical averting capacity (HORACFL), and photochemiluminescence (PCL). All six barley extracts showed significant antioxidant and antiradical activities although the order of their activity changed from assay to assay. Barley extracts exhibited substantial metal chelation activity as measured by 2, 2 '- bipyridyl competition assay. Evaluating the whole barley extracts using a number of model systems such as β-carotene/linoleate, bulk stripped corn oil as well as accelerated oxidation study, using Rancimat®, further revealed that the whole barley extract possessed strong antioxidant activity. Whole grain extracts exhibited strong inhibitory effects against copper-induced human LDL cholesterol oxidation as well as peroxyl and hydroxyl radical-induced DNA double strand scission. Barley extracts also exhibited substantial antiproliferative effect against growth of Caco- 2 human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells in a concentration-dependent manner. [...] In {{the second phase of the}} study involving fractionation, it was revealed that anti oxidative constituents were mainly located in the outer 9 % (w/w) of the kernel. TPC of Falcon and AC Metcalfe fractions ranged from 0. 51 to 6. 26 and 0. 17 to 4. 16 as ferulic acid equivalents per gram defatted material. TAC, as measured by TEAC, varied from 0. 45 to 60 and 0. 69 to 56 μmol Trolox equivalents per gram defatted material, respectively. Antioxidant efficacy gradually diminished from the outer layers to the inner layers. In general, antioxidant efficacy determined by other methods followed a similar trend to that of TAC. [...] In the last phase of the study involving hydrolysis of phenolic compounds, it was revealed that a greater proportion of antioxidative compounds were present in insoluble-bound form followed by soluble conjugate form. It was further revealed that the antioxidant and antiradical efficacies of insoluble bound phenolic compounds were the highest followed by soluble conjugates and free phenolic. The predominant phenolic acid detected in barley extracts was ferulic acid. The other phenolic acids detected were vanillic, caffeic, p-coumaric and sinapic acids...|$|E

40|$|Pearl millet is the {{principal}} staple food crop in large portions of Western Sub-Sahelian Africa and the millet head miner (Heliocheilus albipunctella) {{is one of its}} most devastating insect pests. Since 2006, augmentative mass releases of the larval ectoparasitoid, Habrobracon hebetor, have been conducted in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger as part of minimizing <b>pearl</b> millet <b>grain</b> losses imposed by millet head miners. These ongoing mass releases are based on low-cost mass-rearing of both host larvae and parasitoids. A release of parasitoids consists of placing jute bags containing <b>pearl</b> millet <b>grain</b> and flour and parasitized host larvae near pearl millet fields. The total production costs of a single jute bag with parasitized rice moth larvae are US$ 3 - 4. Based on a study of 6634 individual pearl millet heads collected at harvest in 12 farmers' fields in southern Niger in 2010, we demonstrated (i) a strong negative correlation between pearl millet head damage (mining) and grain yield and (ii) that parasitism by H. hebetor reduced grain losses by, on average, 34 % (comparison of infested millet heads with/without parasitism) within the given growing season. Additional benefits may include reduction in millet head miners in subsequent generations. Data from 900 pearl millet heads collected in nine farmers' fields in 2011 were used to confirm data trends observed in the 2010 data and to characterize the dispersal of parasitoids in upwind and downwind directions from a release site. This study provided a quantitative description of the negative impact of millet head miner infestations on <b>pearl</b> millet <b>grain</b> yields and of benefits on grain yield of parasitism by H. hebetor.

Even under these conditions, pearl millet yields 300 – 400 kg ha- 1 of <b>grain.</b> <b>Pearl</b> millet hybrids maturing in 80 – 85 days, when cultivated as an irrigated summer season crop in parts of Rajasthan, Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh states of India, have been reported to give as high as 4000 – 5000 kg ha- 1 of <b>grain</b> yield. <b>Pearl</b> millet <b>grains</b> have high protein content, balanced amino acid profile, and high levels of iron, zinc, and insoluble dietary fiber. Eggs produced from layers fed on a diet of pearl millet have much lower levels of LDL (the bad cholesterol) than those fed on a maize-based diet. These adaptive and nutritional features combined with high yield potential make pearl millet an important cereal crop that can effectively address the emerging challenges of global warming, water shortages, land degradation and food-related health issues. Farmers cultivating pearl millet continue to be plagued by uncertain and low economic returns when production falls and also when production increases (due to low prices). This serves as a deterrent for farmers to invest in improved crop management, although the latter can play an effective dual role in increasing productivity and enhancing production stability.

40|$|M. Tech. (Food Technology) Abstract: Millet is {{extensively}} {{grown in}} sub Saharan Africa (SSA) {{where it is}} used as food for an estimated 400 million people. Pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) constitutes 40 % of the world’s millet production. Although, pearl millet is cultivated worldwide, it is grossly underutilized, with limited food uses. Its food uses have been confined only to traditional consumers especially to areas of their cultivation. This is mainly due to non-availability of consumer friendly and ready-to-use food products. Considering the prospects, nutritional value and health benefits of this cereal grain, there is need to explore the potentials embedded in it. Through the desirable modification of pearl millet using fermentation and malting and the subsequent delivery of acceptable ready-to-eat (RTE) foods. Fermentation {{is one of the}} oldest methods used to process and improve the nutritional qualities of cereals. Particularly in developing countries, where refrigeration is not always available, the fermentation process is widely used and of crucial importance. Fermentation prolongs the shelf-life of foods and has been reported to increase the protein content and digestibility of millet. Furthermore, fermentation improves the nutritive value, bioavailability of minerals and decreases the concentration of ant-nutritional factors such as phytic acid. Malting of grains on the other hand causes increased activities of endogenous hydrolytic enzymes, through which there is an improvement in nutritional quality acceptability of foods. This study was thus aimed at investigating the effects of malting and fermenting pearl millet on physico-chemical, nutritional and sensory properties of pearl millet flours and resultant biscuits. <b>Pearl</b> millet <b>grains</b> were fermented and malted to produce flours, after which these flours including the native one (milled <b>pearl</b> millet <b>grains)</b> were further processed into a 100 % pearl millet-based biscuit.

40|$|An {{expedition}} to Ghana was undertaken during August 1981 to collect mainly the early-maturing pearl millet, Pennisetum americanum. The collection team travelled extensively {{in most of}} the pearl millet-growing areas of the eastern and northern provinces of Ghana. The mission was planned to coincide with harvesting so that early-maturing landraces could be obtained from farmers’ fields. Seed samples of late-maturing pearl millet were also obtained from local markets. Early-maturing pearl millet is traditionally intercropped with groundnut (Arachis hypogaea), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) or late-maturing pearl millet. <b>Pearl</b> millet <b>grain</b> is used in several traditional food preparations: thick porridge called tô, a thin, fermented porridge calledkoko, and a deep-fried pancake calledmarsa. Landrace populations grown by the farmers were mixtures of several types. The material collected varied considerably for shapes, sizes and colors of spikes and grains. Of the 284 samples collected, 227 were grown in a uniform nursery at Patancheru: they flowered in 39 – 140 days, grew 120 – 315 cm tall, spikes were short (6 – 53 cm) and conical, grains were large, globular and gray with starchy endosperm. The samples belong to race globosum and serve as a good source of genes for earliness and large-grain siz...|$|R
40|$|References Curing/Storage for Seeds The {{harvested}} {{pearl millet}} ear heads are dried to a seed moisture content of below 20 % before threshing. The grain {{is separated from}} the ear heads by using a mechanical thresher. Another common ractice is running a stone roller by oxen over the ear-heads or, trampling under {{the feet of the}} cattle. The separated grain is then cleaned by winnowing and dried once again in the field exposed to the sun or seed driers are used. For long-term storage (more than 6 months), moisture content of the grains should not be more than 13. 5 %. <b>Pearl</b> millet <b>grain</b> is stored traditionally in bins made from or straw or bamboo or metal bins. The storage structures in rural areas are not ideal from scientific-storage point of view, as substantial losses occur during storage of grain from insect pests, moulds, rodents, etc. Keeping the requirements of the farmers in view, the Indian Grain Storage Institute (IGSI), Hapur, Uttar Pradesh, with its branches at Ludhiana and Hyderabad, India have developed several metal bins of different capacities for scientific storage of grain in rural areas...|$|R
40|$|Pearl millet is an {{important}} staple food in rural Africa. However, the mineral bioavailability of pearl millet is low due to its high content of antinutrients, particularly phytate. This research investigated the effects of mineral biofortification, steeping/lactic acid fermentation and parboiling alone and in combination with abrasive decortication of <b>pearl</b> millet <b>grain</b> on its mineral and antinutrient contents. Six normal varieties and two mineral biofortified hybrids were investigated. There was considerable variability in mineral content among the varieties. Iron content ranged from 3. 0 to 9. 6 mg / 100 g and zinc from 3. 0 to 4. 8 mg / 100 g. The mineral biofortified hybrids Dhanashakti and ICMH 1201 had substantially higher iron (21 - 68 %) and zinc (15 - 39 %) contents compared to the normal varieties. Phytate content differed substantially, with levels from 830 to 1360 mg / 100 g. There was no definite trend between the phytate content of normal and mineral biofortified types. Decortication did not cause significant losses in zinc, but resulted considerable iron losses (mean 31 %) across the varieties. There were minimal effects of steeping/lactic acid fermentation and parboiling on iron and zinc contents. Mineral biofortified hybrids were associated with high iron and zinc content after all processing treatments. Decortication of raw grain substantially reduced phytate (mean 24 %) and by a further 12 percentage points when applied after steeping/lactic acid fermentation. Parboiling plus decortication was less effective in reducing phytate content. The critical phytate: iron molar ratio of < 1, above which iron absorption is seriously impaired, was not achieved {{with any of the}} processes. However, steeping/lactic acid fermentation plus decortication and parboiling plus decortication reduced the phytate: zinc molar ratio to below the critical level of < 15 in some varieties. Generally, the mineral biofortified hybrids had improved phytate: mineral molar ratios than the normal varieties for both raw and processed grains. Decortication greatly reduced total phenolic content (mean 24 %) across the varieties and by an additional 14 percentage points after steeping/lactic fermentation and parboiling. Abrasive decortication in combination with steeping/lactic acid fermentation is an effective way of reducing phytate content in <b>pearl</b> millet <b>grain,</b> and hence somewhat improving estimated iron and zinc availability. It is recommended that the process is utilised to a greater extent in pearl millet food processing. Parboiling is also effective in phytate reduction, and can be adopted. Because mineral biofortified pearl millet hybrids have much higher iron and zinc contents, their breeding and cultivation should be promoted in rural Africa.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Pearled</b> {{amaranth}} <b>grains</b> {{obtained by}} abrasive milling were processed by {{planetary ball milling}} to produce starch-enriched flours. The influence of milling energy on rheological and thermal behavior of starch-enriched amaranth flour dispersions and stability during refrigerated storage was investigated. The rheological behavior of flour dispersions was determined using a rotational viscometer, while enthalpy change was determined by differential scanning calorimetry. The power law model {{was found to be}} suitable in expressing the relationship between shear stress and shear rate. All flour dispersions showed a pseudoplastic behavior. However this character decreased with the storage being dependent on flour concentration and milling energy. Several characteristics of the flour dispersions could be explained: decrease of the consistency coefficient and increase of the flow index with the increasing milling energy; decrease of gelatinization enthalpy showed the loss of crystalline structure due to ball milling, as well as increased stability of the flour dispersions during storage. It was observed, that the stability changed with the concentration of amaranth flours. Thus, more stable dispersions were obtained as the flour concentration increased. The highly milled sample was the most stable sample during the storage. To conclude, a more suitable performance to develop liquid food could be obtained using modified amaranth flour by the application of ball milling procedur...|$|R
40|$|Location, year, {{and water}} supply {{influence}} {{the relationship between}} grain yield and yield components of pearl millet [Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br] and grain sorghum Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench]. Field experiments were conducted in 2000 and 2001 on a silt loam soil in semiarid western Nebraska and on a silty clay loam soil in subhumid eastern Nebraska to determine how environment (location, year, water regime) influences number of panicles per square meter, kernel weight, and kernels per panicle in determining <b>grain</b> yield of <b>pearl</b> millet and <b>grain</b> sorghum. Grain yield components were examined by analysis of variance, correlation, and path analysis. Four water regimes were used: (i) no irrigation, (ii) single irrigation at boot stage, (iii) single irrigation at mid-grain fill, and (iv) multiple irrigations. Grain sorghum produced from 109 to 212 g m- 2 greater yield than pearl millet in all environments in western Nebraska and 52 to 150 g m- 2 greater yield in eastern Nebraska. Correlation and path analysis direct effects indicated {{that the number of}} kernels per panicle (R from 0. 36 – 0. 93; P from 0. 21 – 0. 45) and kernel weight (R from 0. 46 – 0. 89; P from 0. 46 – 0. 73) were associated with grain yield for both crops at both locations, but in the path analysis, kernel weight was more highly associated with grain yield for grain sorghum (P from 0. 65 – 0. 73) than the number of kernels per panicle (P from 0. 21 and 0. 32). Plant breeding and production research to increase <b>pearl</b> millet and <b>grain</b> sorghum yield should consider all yield components, but increased emphasis on kernel weight is merited for grain sorghum...|$|R
40|$|Losses of {{nutrients}} such as starch, lipids, proteins, iron and zinc {{as well as}} phytase activity and of recognised anti-nutritional compounds (some insoluble fibres, iron-binding phenolic compounds and phytates) were determined following abrasive decortication of <b>grains</b> from two <b>pearl</b> millet cultivars (Gampela and IKMP- 5) with different composition cultivated in Burkina Faso. In both cultivars, abrasion of the starchy endosperm started when about 12 % of the dry matter {{had been removed from}} grains but lipid and protein losses followed the loss of dry matter. Zinc loss (%) was lower than that of iron; however, both were higher than dry matter losses. By contrast, phytate loss was lower than dry matter loss. Interestingly, decortication led to significant losses in fibres and iron-binding phenolic compounds with different level depending on the cultivar. Changes in phytase activity also differed in the two cultivars (42 % and 11 % losses of phytase activity in grains from Gampela and IKMP- 5 cultivars, respectively, at 12 % of abrasion). Hence, decortication of <b>pearl</b> millet <b>grains</b> does not decrease lipid and protein contents but does considerably decrease some anti-nutritional factors (part of the fibres and iron-binding phenolic compounds). However, as mineral contents and particularly iron content decreased while phytate content remains high, decortication may be insufficient to increase Fe and Zn bioavailability.
