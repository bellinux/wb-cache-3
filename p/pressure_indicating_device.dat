In fact, the ASME code {{does not require}} interlocks or mechanical <b>pressure</b> <b>indicating</b> <b>devices</b> on such doors. Even when opened, the cam-lock does not allow the bolt to disengage from the latching lug {{if there is any}} pressure against the door. Since it is mounted at a small angle to the lug, the bolt cannot be swung outward away from the engaging lug on the door if there is any pull on it.|$|R

If the output of an EMT in terms of any electrical quantity i. e. voltage, current or frequency, is related / dependent upon input quantity i. e. pressure then this relationship can be defined by a curve that has been fitted to experimental data by method of least square. The calculation of the calibration results and the associated uncertainties is a complex matter involving many influencing quantities.

40|$|Abstract: A {{wide range}} of direct {{pressure}} measuring electromechanical transducers is now commercially available in the market. In such electromechanical type direct <b>indicating</b> <b>devices,</b> the applied <b>pressure</b> is directly measured by a sensing element with a suitable mechanism into an analog / digital electrical signal in terms of voltage, current or frequency. The generation of such signals is based upon some electromechanical effects viz. inductive, capacitive, resistive, piezoelectric, piezoresistive, reluctive, resonative and optoelectric etc. A {{wide range of}} such pressure measuring instruments is now commercially available in the market. The high-pressure technology and new applications demand that the best instrumentation should ensure the lowest measurement uncertainty, particularly in the fluid media. The calculation of the calibration results and associated uncertainties is a complex matter involving many influencing quantities. The present paper describes a novel method for evaluating uncertainty in pressure measurement using electromechanical type direct <b>pressure</b> <b>indicating</b> <b>devices</b> through statistical analysis of errors. The method of evaluation of associated uncertainties {{is in line with}} ISO and EA Guidelines on the evaluation and expression of uncertainty in measurement. The results thus obtained are compared with the results obtained by using standard technique described in EA guidelines. Both the methods are quite comparable...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} {{progress}} {{in the development of}} GaAsBi/(Al) GaAs based lasers grown using metal-organic vapour phase epitaxy and focuses on the underlying processes governing their efficiency and temperature dependence. Room temperature lasing has been achieved in devices with 2. 2 % Bi and lasing in devices with 4. 4 % Bi was observed up to 180 K. We show that the device performance can be improved by optimizing both electrical and optical confinement in the laser structures. Analysis of the temperature dependence of the threshold current together with pure spontaneous emission and high hydrostatic <b>pressure</b> measurements <b>indicate</b> that <b>device</b> performance is currently dominated by non-radiative recombination through defects (> 80 % of the threshold current at room temperature in 2. 2 % Bi samples) and that to further improve the device performance and move towards longer wavelengths for optical telecommunications (1. 3 - 1. 5 μ m) further effort is required to improve and optimize material quality. © 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd...|$|R

This purely temperature-induced resistance will be registered by the <b>indicating</b> <b>device</b> as a strain and {{is referred to as}} 'apparent strain' to distinguish it from strain due to applied stress. One desirable technique for apparent strain compensation is to employ two identical gages with identical mounting procedures which are connected with a 'half bridge' configuration where gages see the same thermal environment but only one experiences a mechanical strain input. Their connection in adjacent arms of the bridge will then balance the thermally induced apparent strains and, in principle, only the mechanical strain remains.
