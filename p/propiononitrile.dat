40|$|The acetoxy-protected maltosyl radical 1, {{obtained}} through bromine abstraction from acetobromomaltose (ABM), was studied {{by means of}} EPR spectroscopy. At room temperature, only the spectrum of 1 was observed, but at higher temperatures a second radical, the acetoxy-protected 2 -deoxymaltos- 2 -yl radical 2, was detected, resulting from migration of an acetoxy group from position 2 to position 1. Some acetoxy-protected maltose derivatives were prepared from ABM, via different radical pathways involving 1 and 2 as intermediates. Electroreduction on silver provides tetrasaccharide-like mimics 7 and maltal 8. Photochemical generation of 1, followed by trapping with tributyltinhydride or with acrylonitrile, leads respectively to 1, 5 -anhydromaltitol 9 and to 3 -a-maltosyl <b>propiononitrile</b> 10. Generation of 2 at 808 C by 1 ! 2 isomerisation, followed by trapping with tributyltinhydride, leads to 2 -deoxymaltopyranoside 1...|$|E
40|$|Equilibrium {{constants}} for {{the formation}} of ZnCln 2 -n complexes have been measured in some acetonitrile (MeCN) -water mixtures ranging from 0 to 100 % MeCN at 25 Â°C and I = 0. 1 M (Et 4 NClO 4), by potentiometric titration. The equilibria shift strongly in favour of the formation of the higher-order complexes (n = 3, 4) at high MeCN concentrations. This is shown to be due to differences in the magnitude of unfavourable solvation of the Zn 2 +, Cl - and ZnCln 2 -n ions in MeCN-H 2 O solutions. The Gibbs free energies of transfer of all of these ions from water to MeCN-H 2 O mixtures are strongly positive, but the net change in the transfer function {{for the formation}} of the higher-order complexes is favourable. Thus the formation of these complexes is predominant in MeCN -rich aqueous solutions. Approximate measurements in <b>propiononitrile</b> indicate that the ZnCln 2 -n complexes are even stronger than in acetonitrile...|$|E
40|$|There {{have been}} {{numerous}} theories to explain the mechanism of action of Beta-amino <b>propiononitrile</b> (BAPN) in producing lathyrism. BAPN has been reported: {{to have an effect}} on chondroitin sulfate (1, 2), to have an action as an antimetabolite (6), to interfere with collagen synthesis (4), to cause a dis turbance in the metabolism of nitrogen containing compounds (8) and also an alteration in the metabolism of individual amino acids (5). Microscopic sections of tissue in lathyritic animals reveal definite changes in connective tissue. There is an increase in collagen (14, 9) and also an accumulation of metachromatic material (2). A more recent explanation of the action of BAPN is that it interferes with the cross linking of collagen. It has been shown to inhibit the transformation of collagen soluble in cold 1 Molar sodium chloride to collagen insoluble in this material (13). This explanation is not incompatible with many of the above theories. These authors felt that soluble collagen differed from insoluble in that it had fewer cross links between collagen molecules.
