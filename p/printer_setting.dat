50|$|However, for {{printing}} technologies that perform color mixing through dithering (halftone) {{rather than through}} overprinting (virtually all home/office inkjet and laser printers), printer DPI and image PPI {{have a very different}} meaning, and this can be misleading. Because, through the dithering process, the printer builds a single image pixel out of several printer dots to increase color depth, the printer's DPI setting must be set far higher than the desired PPI to ensure sufficient color depth without sacrificing image resolution. Thus, for instance, printing an image at 250 PPI may actually require a <b>printer</b> <b>setting</b> of 1200 DPI.|$|E

This Instrument can be exploited as queue number - print out - system on the automatic queue system {{at the place where}} queue system needed. The system consisted of hardware and software. The hardware consists of minimum system of microcontroller AT 89 S 51, knob input circuit, seven segment circuit and Epson LX- 800 printer. The microcontroller software in this research was built by using assembly language. This system work after microcontroller is turn on then the microcontroller will do the counter initialization and <b>printer</b> <b>setting.</b> After the initialization and setting process finished, the system will be waiting the counter button pressed, if the counter button pressed, microcontroller will send instruction data to the printer for printing and will represent the queue number counter result at seven segment. In the Epson LX- 800 printer will do the printing process suitable with input data from microcontroller. This system have been realized and be able to print the queue number print out and also represent the queue number counter result on the seven segment after the button was pressed...|$|E

40|$|Additive Manufacturing (AM) -commonly {{known as}} 3 d {{printing}} - is experiencing an upward trend {{as measured by}} a number of metrics, such as patent filing and number of company entries. The number of companies manufacturing hardware, software and materials serving both consumer and industrial segments of this industry has increased over recent years. This technology has radically changed how companies, designers and consumers in general go about prototyping their ideas. AM has also impacted low-volume manufacturing by allowing the production of small batches of products with all the advantages and flexibility the technology confers. Because the industry is still in its fluid phase, a high level of activity and significant changes are still to come. Employing Diffusion of Innovation theory by E. M. Rogers [1] which proposes the use of five factors or dimensions to assess the diffusion speed: relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, triability and observability; the study followed a two-pronged methodology. First I conducted semi-structured interviews and observational analysis; then, I analyzed technological developments, patent activity and firm entry. This study uncovers that 3 d-printing something without observing technical requirements is quite easy. But 3 d-printing a product that complies with a set of product requirements and specifications, so that the component can then be used {{in the context of a}} larger assembly or specific use, is quite another story. Based on observational data this thesis describes the vicissitudes of designing, selecting the <b>printer,</b> <b>setting</b> up the printer's parameters and ultimately printing a component, and thus demonstrates a perspective of the adoptability of this technology. by Jose M.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{of the relationship between}} percentage underneath area cover age and ink film trapping is presented. It is common knowledge that an ink generally adheres better to the paper than to a wet ink. This is known as undertrapping. To avoid this problem, <b>printers</b> <b>set</b> a limit for the total area coverage to be printed on the press sheet. The problem is that no formal study has been done to find the optimum point at which the limit should be set. The investigation addresses the issue of total area coverage from a trap ping point of view. This presents the behavior of ink trapping relative to differ ent combinations of underneath area coverage. A test target with area coverage from 15 % to 300 % was printed underneath a solid. Ink trapping of the solid over the different combinations of underneath area coverage was determined densitometrically. A plot of the relationship between ink trapping and under neath area coverage demonstrates that there is an inverse and linear relation ship between the two variables...|$|R

Going 13-5 and {{finishing}} 1st in the division, the Lions set a team record of 8 consecutive wins in a single season. In addition to club records, the season brought an array of individual performances to the forefront. Quarterback Casey <b>Printers</b> <b>set</b> a CFL record for highest single game completion average of 90.9% (completing 20 of 22 passing attempts) during an August, 2004 game against Hamilton.
