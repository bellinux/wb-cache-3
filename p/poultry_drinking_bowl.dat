25|$|The aerobic {{bacteria}} found in poultry housing can {{include not only}} E. coli, but Staphylococcus, Pseudomona, Micrococcus and others as well. These contaminants can contribute to dust that often cause issues with the respiratory systems of both the poultry and humans working in the environment.

Another Dennert Fir Tree was erected {{in front of his}} former house.|$|R
50|$|Two tombs {{from this}} period with wall {{paintings}} have also been discovered in Lycia. The Karaburun tomb has a scene depicting a man reclining and holding aloft a <b>drinking</b> <b>bowl.</b> This may reflect elements of the Anatolian tradition of the funerary feast, well known from tumulus burials at Gordion. The other painted Lycian tomb is Kızılbel, which depicts Greek legends from the Homeric epics, as well as aspects of kingship similar to those seen in Assyrian imagery.|$|R
5000|$|Jorum Glacier (...) is {{a glacier}} {{draining}} the southeast slopes of Forbidden Plateau, and flowing east {{along the north}} side of Austa Ridge into Borima Bay southwest of Furen Point, on the east coast of Graham Land, Antarctica.

50|$|In the Mahalasa Narayani form, Mahalasa {{has four}} hands, {{carrying}} a Trishula, a sword, a severed head, and a <b>drinking</b> <b>bowl.</b> She also wears the yajnopavita (sacred thread), {{which is generally}} dedicated on male deities. She stands on a prostrate man or demon, as a tiger or lion licks blood dripping from the severed head. Goud Saraswat Brahmins as well as Vaishnavas from Goa and South Canara identify her with Mohini and call her Narayani and Rahu-matthani, the slayer of Rahu, as told in the Bhavishya Purana.|$|R
50|$|The {{terracotta}} figure depicts Polyphemos, the Cyclops and antagonist of Odysseus in book nine of Homer’s Odyssey, as {{a dignified}} banqueter consuming wine. This figure depicts {{the scene in}} The Odyssey where, in order to escape death, Odysseus tricks Polyphemos to become highly intoxicated. The figure was discovered in the Kabirion sanctuary, which is situated near Thebes. Every year, the sanctuary held a festival where performers parodied popular myths. Polyphemos reclining and holding a <b>drinking</b> <b>bowl</b> reflects the presence and importance of humor in ancient Greek culture.|$|R
5000|$|Too late, {{the captain}} and crew learn that [...] "offog" [...] is a {{misprint}} for [...] "off. dog," [...] the ship's official dog, Peaslake, which has spent the whole course of the inventory making a conspicuous nuisance of itself. The animal's collar, <b>drinking</b> <b>bowl,</b> sleeping basket and (the unchewed half of) its cushion were correctly ticked off the inventory list without alerting the crew to their oversight.Obviously the central command is worried about how a dog could come apart, under gravitational stress or not.|$|R
30|$|Jebel Khalid is {{a single}} period Hellenistic site {{on the west bank}} of the Euphrates River in {{northern}} Syria. The occupation of the site dates from the early 3 rd century BCE until its abandonment in the late 70 s BCE. The so-called Governor’s Palace, an administrative centre on the Acropolis of the site, overlooked this walled Greek garrison city. A considerable quantity of glass, predominantly <b>drinking</b> <b>bowls,</b> was excavated from this building complex. This study concerns the elemental analysis of glass samples from this assemblage by electron probe microanalysis (SEM-WDS).|$|R
5000|$|A {{few were}} turned very finely, {{normally}} from burr maple (Acer campestre). Both {{the wood and}} the vessels made of it were known as [...] "mazer", so in contemporary accounts sometimes they {{are referred to as}} ciphis de mazer (<b>drinking</b> <b>bowl</b> of burr maple wood), and sometimes simply as a [...] "mazer". The best mazers had silver or silver gilt rims added. Commonly prints were also added (a decorated disc in the base of the bowl), and occasionally, normally on later mazers, a silver or gilt foot was also added.|$|R
25|$|According {{to local}} tradition, the church became barracks during the American Revolution and was, {{like most other}} Anglican churches in Virginia, {{abandoned}} after either the Revolution or Episcopal Church's disestablishment circa 1794. American soldiers reportedly slaughtered animals in the courtyard and used the communion table as a chopping block, although its surface was later restored. By the War of 1812, the church had fallen into ruin and an “American patrol” used the baptismal fort as a <b>drinking</b> <b>bowl,</b> {{so that it was}} carried away and found on a nearby farm. They also allegedly made unspecified repairs to the brick walls.|$|R
5000|$|Flexible {{glass is}} a legendary lost {{invention}} {{from the time}} of the reign of the Roman Emperor Tiberius Caesar (between 14-37 AD). As recounted by Isidore of Seville, the craftsman who invented the technique brought a <b>drinking</b> <b>bowl</b> made of flexible glass before Caesar who tried to break it, whereupon the material dented, rather than [...] The inventor then repaired the bowl easily with a small hammer. After the inventor swore to the Emperor that he alone knew the technique of manufacture, Tiberius had the man beheaded, fearing such material could undermine the value of gold and silver.|$|R
5000|$|Serving the cauim {{at parties}} {{is also a}} women's task. Cauim is better {{consumed}} warm, and so the women will place the pots over a slow fire in the village's central plaza. While keeping the pot well stirred, they will serve the beverage in <b>drinking</b> <b>bowls</b> [...] - [...] holding up to [...] "three Parisian quarts" [...] each [...] - [...] to the dancing men, as they pass by. While men are supposed to empty their bowls in one go (and perhaps twenty bowlfuls in a single party), the women take sips more or less continuously.|$|R

50|$|Although Kachylion's {{workshop}} only produced <b>drinking</b> <b>bowls,</b> and Euphronios {{continued to}} work for him into his maturity, simple bowls soon failed to satisfy his artistic impulse. He began to paint other vase types, probably working with different potters. The Villa Giulia holds two very early pelikes by him. Such medium-size vases offered more space for his figural paintings. A psykter now in Boston is also counted among his early work, as it strongly resembles the work of Oltos: stiff garment folds, almond-shaped eyes, a small protruding chin and ill-differentiated hands and feet. Alternatively, it could be a relatively careless work from a later phase.|$|R
50|$|Patera (pl. paterae) is Latin for {{a shallow}} <b>drinking</b> <b>bowl.</b> The term {{was applied to}} certain ill-defined, scalloped-edged craters that {{appeared}} in early spacecraft images to be large volcanic calderas. The smaller paterae in Tharsis appear to be morphologically similar to the tholi, except for having larger calderas. Like the tholi, the Tharsis paterae probably represent the tops of larger, now buried shield volcanoes. Historically, the term patera {{has been used to}} describe the entire edifice of certain volcanoes on Mars (e.g., Alba Patera). In 2007, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) redefined the terms Alba Patera, Uranius Patera, and Ulysses Patera to refer only to the central calderas of these volcanoes.|$|R
50|$|Mahalasa is {{identified}} with Mohini, the female avatar {{of the god}} Vishnu. Mahalasa has four hands, carrying a Trishula, a sword, a severed head, and a <b>drinking</b> <b>bowl.</b> She stands on a prostrate man or demon, as a tiger or lion licks blood dripping from the severed head. She also wears the yajnopavita (sacred thread), which is generally dedicated on male deities. She stands on a prostrate man or demon, as a tiger or lion licks blood dripping from the severed head.

5|$|In Goa, Mohini is worshipped as Mahalasa or Mahalasa Narayani. She is the Kuladevi (family goddess) of many Hindus {{from western}} and {{southern}} India, including Goud Saraswat Brahmins, Karhade Brahmins, Daivajnas and Bhandaris. The chief temple of Mahalasa Narayani is at Mardol, Goa, though her temples also {{exist in the}} states of Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, and Gujarat.

50|$|The fountains {{are not all}} identical, {{but most}} share one of two basic designs. The most common version is 6 ft tall, {{consisting}} of a large circular bowl with a square pillar rising from its center placed on a square pedestal. The main bowl, intended for horses, is 6 ft in diameter and is fed by bronze spigots {{in the shape of}} lion heads on three sides of the upper pillar. The fourth side contains a bronze plaque listing details of the fountain's construction. The lower pedestal is 18 in high and has niches on each side with <b>drinking</b> <b>bowls</b> near ground level for dogs, cats, and other small animals. The fountain is assembled from five pieces of granite weighing 10000 lb in total.|$|R

25|$|A round {{drilling}} edge is used, {{being the}} size of a <b>drinking</b> <b>bowl,</b> while the depth of the borehole amounts to several tens of zhang. Large bamboo stems are used with the septa removed and fitted together by male-female joints to form the well, thus keeping the fresh water out so that the salty spring water comes up by itself. Smaller bamboo tubes are also used which travel {{up and down in the}} wells as buckets. They have no bottom, but an orifice is mounted at the top. A piece of leather of several inches in size is hung up. As the tubes go in and out of the brine, the air pushes and sucks, closing and opening the leather valve. Each tube brings up several dou of brine… Where profit is to be had, people do not fail to know about it.|$|R
