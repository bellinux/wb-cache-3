40|$|Abstract Background <b>Personality</b> <b>disorders</b> {{affect a}} {{substantial}} {{proportion of the}} population. It is unclear, however, whether the burden of <b>personality</b> <b>disorders</b> on modern mental health services has been increasing. To fill this gap, we analyzed trends in admissions for <b>personality</b> <b>disorders</b> in Italy from 1988 to 1998. Methods We used the yearly data from the Italian Central Institute of Statistics to analyse trends in {{the total number of}} admissions for <b>personality</b> <b>disorders</b> and in the total number of first admissions for <b>personality</b> <b>disorders.</b> Results The absolute number of admissions for <b>personality</b> <b>disorders</b> almost trebled from 1988 to 1998, as well as the proportion of all psychiatric admissions that were for <b>personality</b> <b>disorders.</b> Whilst there has been a marked increase in the absolute number of first admissions, the proportion of all first psychiatric admissions that were for <b>personality</b> <b>disorders</b> showed a steady but modest increase, from 5. 7 % to 7. 6 %. Conclusion In Italy, the burden of <b>personality</b> <b>disorders</b> on modern mental health services has been increasing. In terms of public health, these findings highlight the urgent need of developing policies to tackle the increasing demand of care of this difficult-to-treat patient population. </p...|$|R

5|$|Ann Rule began {{corresponding}} with Green in 1996, {{and interviewed}} her in person in 1997.

Green claimed that though her behavior {{in the summer and}} fall of 1995 had been neglectful, she had neither the desire nor the wherewithal to set fire to her house or harm her children or her husband. Rule—who was neither a doctor nor a psychologist, but had a background in criminology and law enforcement—believed that even Green does not understand what caused her to attempt to murder Michael Farrar beyond {{the fact that she had}} come to hate him. Rule's theory was that in destroying Farrar, Green would have been able to preserve her own ego, in that Farrar would not have been able to leave her for another woman. Psychiatrist Michael H. Stone, using Rule's book as a source of information about Green, identifies Green as showing characteristics of psychopathy, borderline <b>personality</b> <b>disorder,</b> and narcissistic <b>personality</b> <b>disorder.</b>|$|E

40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of the present study}} is to investigate the association between DSM-IV <b>personality</b> <b>disorders</b> and motivation for treatment in a large sample of patients admitting for a variety of psychotherapeutic programs (n = 1083). Second, we examine whether and to what extent this association is accounted for by other relevant patient variables (i. e., demographics, subjective distress, and treatment history). We developed a brief questionnaire to measure the motivation for treatment: the Motivation for Treatment Questionnaire (MTQ- 8). The MTQ- 8 consists of two subscales, i. e., Need for help and Readiness to change. The results show that patients with various <b>personality</b> <b>disorders</b> were significantly more motivated for treatment than those without. No differences across specific <b>personality</b> <b>disorders</b> were apparent. The association between <b>personality</b> <b>disorders</b> and motivation for treatment appeared to be partly accounted for by the level of symptom distress. It is concluded that, among treatment-seeking patients, <b>personality</b> <b>disorders</b> are associated with motivation for treatment and this association can best be understood by the higher symptom distress in patients with <b>personality</b> <b>disorders</b> as compared to those without <b>personality</b> <b>disorders...</b>|$|R

5|$|There is no {{well-established}} {{treatment for}} self-injurious behaviour in children or adolescents. Cognitive behavioural therapy {{may also be}} used to assist those with Axis I diagnoses, such as depression, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. Dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) can be successful for those individuals exhibiting a <b>personality</b> <b>disorder,</b> and could potentially be used for those with other mental disorders who exhibit self-harming behaviour. Diagnosis and treatment of the causes of self-harm is thought {{by many to be the}} best approach to treating self-harm. But in some cases, particularly in people with a <b>personality</b> <b>disorder,</b> this is not very effective, so more clinicians are starting to take a DBT approach in order to reduce the behaviour itself. People who rely on habitual self-harm are sometimes hospitalised, based on their stability, their ability and especially their willingness to get help. In adolescents multisystem therapy shows promise. Treatments such as CBT, family intervention, interpersonal therapy, and various psychodynamic therapies were all shown to be possibly effective in treating self-injurious behaviour in children and adolescents.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Although it is {{generally}} agreed that <b>personality</b> <b>disorders</b> are an important topic in old-age psychiatry, DSM- 5 has paid relatively little attention to older persons affected with this severe mental disorder. AIM: To look closely and carefully at several aspects {{of the way in}} which DSM- 5 defines <b>personality</b> <b>disorders</b> relating to older persons. METHOD: We make a critical evaluation of the description of <b>personality</b> <b>disorders</b> given in DSM- 5. RESULTS: First of all, we question whether the phrase 'personality change due to another medical condition' should really be included in the dsm- 5 chapter of <b>personality</b> <b>disorders</b> because a <b>personality</b> change actually has the features of a persistent conduct disorder. Secondly, we argue that in a future revised version of dsm- 5 <b>personality</b> <b>disorders</b> affecting older persons should be referred to specifically as 'late-onset' <b>personality</b> <b>disorders.</b> Thirdly, we stress that the research programme relating to the dimensional dsm- 5 model of <b>personality</b> <b>disorders</b> should involve a larger number of older persons. In addition, more research is needed with regard to the use, wording and validity of the phrase 'personality change due to a medical condition'. Those responsible for the revision of the DSM- 5 should ensure that the concept 'late-onset personality disorders' is incorporated in the text. CONCLUSION: The description of <b>personality</b> <b>disorders</b> in DSM- 5 is confusing. This is probably due to the transitional period between the old categorical (dsm-iv) system and the newly proposed dimensional approach to <b>personality</b> <b>disorders</b> in DSM- 5, an approach that needs further investigation. However, this intervening period could be a good opportunity for doing further research into <b>personality</b> <b>disorders</b> in older adults...|$|R

5|$|Paradoxical reactions, such as {{increased}} seizures in epileptics, aggression, violence, impulsivity, irritability and suicidal behavior sometimes occur. These reactions have been explained as consequences of disinhibition {{and the subsequent}} loss of control over socially unacceptable behavior. Paradoxical reactions are rare in the general population, with an incidence rate below 1% and similar to placebo. However, they occur with greater frequency in recreational abusers, individuals with borderline <b>personality</b> <b>disorder,</b> children, and patients on high-dosage regimes. In these groups, impulse control problems {{are perhaps the most}} important risk factor for disinhibition; learning disabilities and neurological disorders are also significant risks. Most reports of disinhibition involve high doses of high-potency benzodiazepines. Paradoxical effects may also appear after chronic use of benzodiazepines.|$|E
5|$|Richard's posthumous {{reputation}} {{has been}} shaped {{to a large extent}} by William Shakespeare, whose play Richard II portrayed Richard's misrule and his deposition by Bolingbroke as responsible for the 15th-century Wars of the Roses.

5|$|In a {{study of}} a {{district}} general hospital in the UK, 5.4% of all the hospital's self-harm cases were aged over 65. The male to female ratio was 2:3 although the self-harm rates {{for males and females}} over 65 in the local population were identical. Over 90% had depressive conditions, and 63% had significant physical illness. Under 10% of the patients gave a history of earlier self-harm, while both the repetition and suicide rates were very low, which could be explained by the absence of factors known to be associated with repetition, such as <b>personality</b> <b>disorder</b> and alcohol abuse. However, NICE Guidance on Self-harm in the UK suggests that older people who self-harm are at a greater risk of completing suicide, with 1 in 5 older people who self-harm going on to end their life.
