50|$|The {{ossicles}} are classically {{supposed to}} mechanically convert the vibrations of the eardrum, into amplified pressure {{waves in the}} fluid of the cochlea (or inner ear) with a lever arm factor of 1.3. Since the effective vibratory area of the eardrum is about 14 fold larger {{than that of the}} oval window, the sound pressure is concentrated, leading to a <b>pressure</b> <b>gain</b> of at least 18.1. The eardrum is merged to the malleus, which connects to the incus, which in turn connects to the stapes. Vibrations of the stapes footplate introduce pressure waves in the inner ear. There is a steadily increasing body of evidence that shows that the lever arm ratio is actually variable, depending on frequency. Between 0.1 and 1 kHz it is approximately 2, it then rises to around 5 at 2 kHz and then falls off steadily above this frequency. The measurement of this lever arm ratio is also somewhat {{complicated by the fact that}} the ratio is generally given in relation to the tip of the malleus (also known as the umbo) and the level of the middle of the stapes. The eardrum is actually attached to the malleus handle over about a 0.5 cm distance. In addition the eardrum itself moves in a very chaotic fashion at frequencies >3 kHz. The linear attachment of the eardrum to the malleus actually smooths out this chaotic motion and allows the ear to respond linearly over a wider frequency range than a point attachment. The auditory ossicles can also reduce sound pressure (the inner ear is very sensitive to overstimulation), by uncoupling each other through particular muscles.|$|E

40|$|If the {{conventional}} steady flow combustor {{of a gas}} turbine is replaced with a device which achieves a <b>pressure</b> <b>gain</b> during the combustion process then the thermal efficiency of the cycle is raised. All such ‘Pressure Gain Combustors ’ (e. g. PDEs, pulse combustors or wave rotors) are inherently unsteady flow devices. For such a device to be practically installed in a gas turbine {{it is necessary to}} design a downstream row of turbine vanes which will both accept the combustors unsteady exit flow and deliver a flow which the turbine rotor can accept. The design requirements of such a vane are that its exit flow both retains the maximum time-mean stagnation <b>pressure</b> <b>gain</b> (the <b>pressure</b> <b>gain</b> produced by the combustor is not lost) and minimises the amplitude of unsteadiness (reduces unsteadiness entering the downstream rotor).

Intracochlear pressure changes were recorded in a cochlear model with a micro-pressure sensor positioned in the apical region of the cochlea model to follow the maximum amplitude and <b>pressure</b> <b>gain</b> velocity in intracochlear pressure. A temporal bone mastoid cavity was attached to the model to simulate cable positioning.

Comparing the cable storage conditions, a cable fixed mode offers significantly lower maximum pressure amplitude and <b>pressure</b> <b>gain</b> velocity than the nonfixed mode. Conclusion.

The results of engine cycle analysis indicated the level of specific fuel consumption (SFC) benefits to be 17 percent. The potential losses in <b>pressure</b> <b>gain</b> due to leakage were found to be closely coupled to the wave processes at the rotor endpoints of the ORC/WR system. Extensive investigation into the sealing approaches is reported. Sensitivity studies show that SFC gains of 10 percent remain available even when <b>pressure</b> <b>gain</b> levels are highly penalized. This indicates ORC/WR systems to have a high degree of tolerance to rotor leakage effects but also emphasizes their importance. An engine demonstration of an ORC/WR system is seen as key to progressing the TRL of this technology.

Prior to such a demonstration, the existing NASA pressure exchanger wave rotor rig was identified as an opportunity to apply both expanded analytical modeling capabilities developed within this program and to identify and fix identified leakage issues existing within this rig.
