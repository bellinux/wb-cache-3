40|$|This study {{examined}} <b>principals</b> 2 ̆ 7 and teachers 2 ̆ 7 perceptions regarding both {{the importance of}} certain leadership skills and the ratings of <b>principals</b> 2 ̆ 7 actual skills. There are strong theoretical bases {{for the use of}} <b>principals</b> 2 ̆ 7 and teachers 2 ̆ 7 perceptions in this study. The analysis of perceptions of leadership skills can lead to: (1) an increased awareness of <b>principals</b> 2 ̆ 7 strengths and weaknesses; (2) greater communication between <b>principals</b> and teachers; and, (3) hopefully, increased productivity on the part of <b>principals</b> and teachers. The population for this study included a group of twenty-eight <b>principals</b> who participated in the Confederation of Oregon School Administrators Assessment Center, and teachers in those <b>principals</b> 2 ̆ 7 schools. These <b>principals</b> represented the total number of Assessment Center participants who were promoted to their positions subsequent to their participation in the Center. Assessment Center predictions ratings of these <b>principals</b> 2 ̆ 7 skills were compared to teachers 2 ̆ 7 ratings of the same <b>principals</b> 2 ̆ 7 skills. Research questions sought information in the following areas: (1) <b>principals</b> 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of their own skills; (2) <b>principals</b> 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of the importance of given skills; (3) <b>principals</b> 2 ̆ 7 predictions of teachers 2 ̆ 7 ratings of the importance of skills; (4) <b>principals</b> 2 ̆ 7 predictions of teachers 2 ̆ 7 ratings of <b>principals</b> 2 ̆ 7 actual skills; (5) teachers 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of <b>principals</b> 2 ̆ 7 skills; (6) teachers 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of the importance of given skills; and, (7) Assessment Center predictions ratings of <b>principals</b> 2 ̆ 7 skills. The methodology for this study combined survey research with information provided by the COSA Assessment Center. Mailed surveys were used to collect data regarding <b>principals</b> 2 ̆ 7 and teachers 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of leadership skills. The results of this study suggested that there is a general agreement between <b>principals</b> and teachers regarding <b>principals</b> 2 ̆ 7 leadership skills. Additionally, the predictions made regarding <b>principals</b> 2 ̆ 7 skills by the Assessment Center accurately reflected teachers 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of the same <b>principals</b> 2 ̆ 7 skills in the field. The area of greatest difference in this study was in <b>principals</b> 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of teachers 2 ̆ 7 ratings. <b>Principals</b> generally predicted that teachers would rate the importance of skills lower than teachers actually rated them. Because teachers 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of <b>principals</b> 2 ̆ 7 skills are generally accurate, it can be concluded that teachers 2 ̆ 7 ratings of their <b>principals</b> can {{play an important role in}} the total process of <b>principals</b> 2 ̆ 7 evaluations...|$|R

The target population included all <b>principals</b> and teachers of guidance schools and high schools in the Dashtiari District, Iran. A sample consisting of 46 <b>principals</b> and 129 teachers was selected by stratified sampling and simple random sampling methods. A leadership Behavior Description Questionnaire (LBDQ) developed by Kozes and Posner (2001) was used for data collection. The obtained data were analyzed using one sample and independent t-test, correlation coefficient and crosstabs pearson Chi-square test. The results showed that teachers describe leadership behaviors of their <b>principals</b> relatively well. However, <b>principals</b> themselves evaluated their leadership behaviors as very well. Comparing between leadership behaviors self-reported by <b>principals</b> and those observed by teachers, a significant difference was found between the views and evaluations of teachers and <b>principals</b> on all components of leadership behaviors of <b>principals,</b> except that regarding empowerment. In fact, <b>principals</b> described their leadership behaviors better and at a more appropriate level than teachers.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{qualitative}} case study was to build on a prior study that examined how <b>principals</b> acquired and applied new knowledge from professional development (PD). Findings from the prior study suggested a three-part model of <b>principals?</b> learning: (1) learning in a social context facilitates knowledge development, (2) a <b>principals?</b> context of practice influences learning, and (3) the application of PD learning is mediated by a <b>principal?s</b> phronesis, or practical wisdom, about their context. A purposive sample of five elementary school <b>principals</b> from rural areas in a northern Midwestern state were interviewed and observed in their practice. <b>Principals</b> were asked to reflect on how they processed new knowledge during and after PD sessions. <b>Principals</b> {{were asked if they}} applied PD learning in practice and how. Finally, <b>principals</b> were asked what aspects of PD experiences were most useful and why. Data were analyzed using the model that emerged from the prior study as the conceptual framework. Results from this study supported the prior study model of <b>principals?</b> PD learning. Additionally, results from the present study found <b>principals</b> engaged in a sensemaking process as they acquired and considered new knowledge in light of their contextual constraints and supports. Results also provided {{a deeper understanding of the}} contextual considerations that mediated <b>principals?</b> new learning. Additionally, results confirmed that application of new knowledge occurred as small changes in <b>principals?</b> practices mediated by <b>principals?</b> phronesis about their school community gained from experiences in their context. This study has added to the body of knowledge about how <b>principals</b> acquire and apply learning from PD. That body of knowledge can be useful in informing the assessment, design, and delivery of PD programs for <b>principals.</b> Additionally, future research in other contexts of practice can build on this study in an effort to develop a theory into practice model representing how <b>principals</b> learn during PD and apply their learning in practice. As a part of future research, further probing of how and why <b>principals</b> apply learning in practice can help determine to what extent current PD is helping <b>principals</b> become more effective leaders...|$|R

The questionnaires consisted of fortyfive items and two Likert-type response scales. <b>Principals</b> and assistant <b>principals</b> were asked to indicate on one scale the degree to which the item ideally should have been provided and on a second scale the degree to which the item actually was provided by central staff. Questionnaires were returned by fifty-eight or ninety-three percent of the <b>principals</b> and assistant <b>principals.</b> ConclusionsThe conclusions of the study were:Discrepancies exist between the ideal and actual classification in that <b>principals</b> were not provided with:Training in interviewing and staff selection procedures. An annual meeting between <b>principals</b> and maintenance to determine priorities. Maintenance service programs structured from a preventative standpoint. Discrepancies do not exist between the ideal and actual classification in that:Principals were given the final authority in the selection processes.

Their learning has extended to their teachers and students. (2) Even though the <b>principals</b> have not been exposed to long-ranged, purposeful professional development activities, they have been involved in professional development activities and have used the professional development opportunities available to them to strengthen their knowledge and skills. (3) The <b>principals</b> know they are leaders and are willing to accept the challenges that accompany being the leader.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} and report selected Indiana public school principals' perceptions of differentiated staffing as a viable method of school personnel organization. The research was designed to examine Indiana school principals' perceptions of the differentiated staffing concept and the possible affects it may have on <b>principals,</b> classroom teachers, and students. The data obtained revealed the beliefs of those <b>principals</b> sampled concerning the relationship of differentiated staffing and school personnel organization. The original study population included 300 Indiana school <b>principals</b> who had been randomly sampled from the 1969 - 70 Indiana School Directory. Of the original sample, 100 were elementary <b>principals</b> (K- 6, 1 - 6), 100 were junior high <b>principals</b> (7 - 8, 7 - 9), and 100 were high school <b>principals</b> (9 - 12, 10 - 12). A <b>Principal's</b> Response Instrument was designed from a review of the literature on differentiated staffing. The questionnaire was mailed to the selected <b>principals</b> and from this mailing, a total of 240 questionnaires were returned. This represented an eighty per cent return. Of the total number returned, eighty-five were from elementary <b>principals,</b> seventy-nine were from junior high <b>principals,</b> and seventy-six were from high school <b>principals.</b> Review of the data led to the following conclusions: Elementary <b>principals,</b> junior high school <b>principals,</b> and senior high school <b>principals</b> tended to respond in a fairly consistent pattern that did not produce a highly distinguishable difference between the three levels of school <b>principals</b> represented in the study. Seventy per cent of the Indiana <b>principals</b> perceived differentiated staffing to be a better method of school personnel organization than traditional staffing methods. They indicated that the differentiated staffing concept would need to develop the skills necessary to become specialists in group process, organization management, and human relations. <b>Principals</b> felt that the concept would permit the <b>principals</b> to be the instructional leader in the school. <b>Principals</b> did not feel that teachers would be in favor of differentiated staffing. However, they did feel that the concept would permit better utilization of teacher resources and would recognize a career ladder for teachers. They felt that the concept would foster good teaching techniques and that teachers' individual needs, interests, and aptitudes could be met under differentiated staffing. <b>Principals</b> perceived differentiated staffing as providing more meaningful educational opportunities for learners than traditional staffing patterns while meeting student individual interests, needs, and abilities. <b>Principals</b> favored the establishment of learning resource centers in the schools and the implementation of more individualized curriculum for students. <b>Principals</b> were overwhelmingly supportive to the notion that the primary concern of differentiated staffing is to promote more effective learning for students. <b>Principals</b> strongly favored the implementation of experimental models of differentiated staffing in the public schools in Indiana.
