5|$|Whatever event {{eventually}} {{triggered the}} battle, it obviously altered the strategic or tactical balance sufficiently to induce the Athenians {{to attack the}} Persians. If the first theory is correct (see above), then the absence of cavalry removed the main Athenian tactical disadvantage, {{and the threat of}} being outflanked made it imperative to attack. Conversely, if the second theory is correct, then the Athenians were merely reacting to the Persians attacking them. Since the Persian force obviously contained a high proportion of missile troops, a static defensive position would have made little sense for the Athenians; the strength of the hoplite was in the melee, and the sooner that could be brought about, the better, from the Athenian point of view. If the second theory is correct, this raises the further question of why the Persians, having hesitated for several days, then attacked. There may have been several strategic reasons for this; <b>perhaps</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> aware (or suspected) that the Athenians were expecting reinforcements. Alternatively, since they may have felt the need to force some kind of victory—they could hardly remain at Marathon indefinitely.|$|E

It suggests that Rowland had a simple accident, such as tripping and steadying himself against the girl, or <b>perhaps</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> lovers and had a quarrel.|$|E

Boborykino culture (late 5th millennium BC - late 4th millennium BC) coexisted with the Koshkinskino and Sosnovka-Ostrov. Monuments of the Poludenskoe culture are few; <b>perhaps</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> functioning {{at a time when}} the surrounding area was empty.|$|E

25|$|There was a rumor of {{one final}} act to survive {{conducted}} by the USBA. The idea to turn Merl Mennenga, {{the founder of the}} ABA to somehow force Mr. Anderson and Mr. Vargas to sell back the ABA and then to sell the ABA to the USBA which would then close down the ABA under the Chapter VII bankruptcy law with the USBA inheriting the tracks ABA's then current leadership. If true, <b>perhaps</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> thinking about the precedent of Walt Ehnart, the former President of the ABA and by then the Vice President of the USBA that they could have turned Mennenga. However unlikely it would have been, nothing came of it.|$|E
25|$|Much {{international}} attention was attracted especially {{by the discovery}} of an extremely rare find, a life-sized sandstone statue or stele, dating from the 5th century BC, which was found just outside the larger tumulus. The stele, fully preserved except for its feet, depicts an armed male warrior. It measures 186cm in height and weighs 230kg. It is made from a type of sandstone available within a few kilometres of Glauberg. Much detail is clearly visible: his trousers, composite armour tunic, wooden shield and a typical La Tène sword hanging from his right side. The moustachioed man wears a torc with three pendants, remarkably {{similar to the one}} from the chamber in mound 1, several rings on both arms and one on the right hand. On his head, he wears a hood-like headdress crowned by two protrusions, resembling the shape of a mistletoe leaf. Such headdresses are also known from a handful of contemporary sculptures. As mistletoe is believed to have held a magical or religious significance to the Celts, it could indicate that the warrior depicted also played the role of a priest. Fragments of three similar statues were also discovered in the area. It is suggested that all four statues once stood in the rectangular enclosure. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> associated with an ancestor cult.|$|E
500|$|Astronomers at the time, {{including}} Edmond Halley, {{speculated that}} this comet was {{a return of}} a bright comet seen close to the Sun in the sky in 1106. 163 years later, the Great Comet of 1843 appeared and also passed extremely close to the Sun. Despite orbital calculations showing {{that it had a}} period of several centuries, some astronomers wondered if it was a return of the 1680 comet. [...] A bright comet seen in 1880 was found to be travelling on an almost identical orbit to that of 1843, as was the subsequent Great Comet of 1882. [...] Some astronomers suggested that <b>perhaps</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> all one comet, whose orbital period was somehow being drastically shortened at each perihelion passage, perhaps by retardation by some dense material surrounding the Sun.|$|E

500|$|After {{arriving}} in Paris, they soon relocated to Antibes on the French Riviera. While Scott was absorbed writing The Great Gatsby, Zelda became infatuated with a dashing young French pilot, Edouard S. Jozan. She spent afternoons swimming {{at the beach}} and evenings dancing at the casinos with Jozan. After six weeks, Zelda asked for a divorce. Scott at first demanded to confront Jozan, but instead dealt with Zelda's demand by locking her in their house, until she abandoned her request for divorce. Jozan did not know she'd asked for a divorce. He left the Riviera later that year, and the Fitzgeralds never saw him again. Later in life he told Zelda's biographer Milford that any infidelity was imaginary: [...] "They both had a need of drama, they made it up and <b>perhaps</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> the victims of their own unsettled and a little unhealthy imagination." [...] In Fitzgerald's, [...] "A Life in Letters," [...] Fitzgerald referred to the Jozan affair in his August letter to Ludlow Fowler. He writes of lost illusions in The Great Gatsby as his lost certainty in Zelda's fidelity. The book reflected the dramatized pivotal aspects of his and Zelda's love, of courtship, break, restoration with financial success, and the Jozan betrayal: [...] "I feel old too, this summer... the whole burden of this novel—the loss of those illusions that give such color {{to the world that}} you don't care whether things are true or false as long as they partake of the magical glory." [...] The Great Gatsby was in draft form during the July 1924 Jozan crisis; the typescript was sent to Scribners at the end of October. Fitzgerald wrote in his notebooks, [...] "That September 1924, I knew something had happened that could never be repaired." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the verdict}} of a {{successful}} D-Day for the 3rd CID, the failure of Canadian units to reach their final objectives has proven more disputed than {{the reasons for their}} success. Terry Copp places the blame on Keller, who committed the entirety of the 9th Brigade reserve to land on the narrower beaches of the 8th Brigade—which was itself still fighting to clear the seaside towns—after receiving reports of poor progress by the 7th Brigade. Dutch historian Dan Van der Vat notes that [...] "the planned breakout of the 9th Brigade was held up by a huge jam of vehicles". Wilmot also places the blame with logistical difficulties of the landing, saying that [...] "on the whole it was not so much the opposition in front as the congestion behind—on the beaches and in Bernières—that prevented the Canadians from reaching their final D-Day objective". Stacey offers a different view, suggesting that it was not impossible for the 3rd CID to reach its D-Day objectives, and that the failure to do so rests in the fact that [...] "British and Canadian forces were usually better at deceiving the enemy and achieving initial success in an assault than they were at exploiting surprise and success once achieved. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> rather too easily satisfied". Copp disagrees with Stacey's assessment, suggesting that such caution was not the result of poor planning but of the fact that [...] "the British and Canadians fought the way they had been trained, moving forward to designated objectives in controlled bounds and digging in {{at the first sign of}} a counterattack". He also disputes whether the capture of the final objectives would have been strategically intelligent, observing that [...] "if 9th Brigade had reached Carpiquet and dug in, with artillery in position to offer support, the commander of the 26th Panzer Grenadiers might have followed orders and waited until a coordinated counterattack with other divisions had been organized. Such an attack might well have done far more damage to the Allied beachhead than the hastily improvised operation actually carried out [...] ".|$|E
2500|$|Unterberger continues, [...] "Perhaps {{they were}} saying they wished they {{could be on the}} front lines, but were not {{in the right place at}} the right time; <b>perhaps</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> saying, as John Lennon did in the Beatles' [...] "Revolution", that they didn't want to be {{involved}} in violent confrontation. Or <b>perhaps</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> even declaring indifference to the tumult." [...] Other writers' interpretations varied. [...] In 1976, Roy Carr assessed it as a [...] "great summer street-corner rock anthem on the same echelon as 'Summer in the City', 'Summertime Blues', and 'Dancing in the Street'." [...] In 1979, Dave Marsh wrote that it was the keynote of Beggars Banquet, [...] "with its teasing admonition to do something and its refusal to admit that doing it will make any difference; as usual, the Stones were more correct, if also more faithless, philosophers than any of their peers." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the early}} empire one finds milites medici who were immunes ("exempt") from other duties.

The hospital administrator was an optio valetudinarii. The orderlies aren't generally mentioned, but they must have existed, as the patients needed care and the doctors had more important duties. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> servile or civilians, not worth mentioning.

2500|$|... 19th-century {{and early}} 20th-century historians speculated {{on whether the}} {{northern}} Belgae were Celts or Germanic tribes. Caesar claims {{that most of the}} northern Belgae were descended from tribes who had long ago crossed the Rhine from Germania. However many tribal names and personal names or titles recorded are identifiably Celtic. It seems likely that the northern Belgae, due to their intense contact with the Gaulish south, were largely influenced by this southern culture. Tribal names were 'qualifications' and could have been translated or given by the Gauls and picked up by Caesar. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> Germanic people who had adopted Gaulish titles or names. The Belgians were a political alliance of southern Celtic and northern Germanic tribes. In any case, the Romans were not precise in their ethnography of northern barbarians: by [...] "German(ic)" [...] Caesar meant [...] "originating east of the Rhine".
