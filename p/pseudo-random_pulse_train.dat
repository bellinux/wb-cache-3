40|$|Abstract—In this study, {{we examine}} the {{characteristics}} of electric field <b>pulse</b> <b>trains</b> that are attributed to preliminary breakdown in negative cloud-to-ground lightning discharges and compare them to those of similar <b>pulse</b> <b>trains</b> associated with attempted cloud-to-ground leaders. The data were acquired in 2006 in Gainesville, Florida. The largest <b>pulses</b> in the <b>train</b> can exceed in magnitude the following first return-stroke pulse. The arithmetic mean pulse duration and interpulse interval for <b>pulse</b> <b>trains</b> in negative cloud-to-ground discharges are 4. 8 and 65 µs, respectively. The arithmetic mean pulse duration and interpulse interval for <b>pulse</b> <b>trains</b> in attempted cloud-to-ground leaders are 17 and 73 µs, respectively. This implies that <b>pulse</b> <b>trains</b> in ground discharges contain a larger fraction of “narrow” pulses (apparently disregarded in previous studies), defined here as those with durations equal to or less than 4 µs, than the <b>pulse</b> <b>trains</b> in attempted cloud-to-ground leaders.
