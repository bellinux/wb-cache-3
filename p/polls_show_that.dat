5|$|As {{with other}} Western countries, the U.S. is {{becoming}} less religious. Irreligion is growing rapidly among Americans under 30. <b>Polls</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> overall American confidence in organized religion {{has been declining}} since {{the mid to late}} 1980s, and that younger Americans in particular are becoming increasingly irreligious. According to a 2012 study, the Protestant share of the U.S. population had dropped to 48%, thus ending its status as religious category of the majority for the first time. Americans with no religion have 1.7 children compared to 2.2 among Christians. The unaffiliated are less likely to get married with 37% marrying compared to 52% of Christians.|$|E

A CNN/ORC poll of debate viewers found that 62% believed Clinton won, compared to 27% for Trump. A poll conducted by Public Policy Polling found that 51% thought Clinton won the debate, while 40% thought Trump won. A YouGov {{poll found that}} 57% of Americans declared Clinton the winner, while 30% declared Trump the winner. A Politico/Morning Consult <b>poll</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> 49% of likely voters thought that Clinton won the debate, while 26% thought that Trump won, and 25% were undecided. Echelon Insights <b>polling</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> Clinton won the debate 48-22, and that the debate made 41% of respondents more likely to vote for Clinton while 29% {{were more likely to}} vote for Trump. A Reuters/Ipsos poll found that 56% of Americans thought Clinton did better, while 26% thought Trump did.

A CBS News <b>poll</b> <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> 32% of likely voters say that they thought better of Clinton after watching the debate, but only 10% of voters said that they thought better of Trump afterward.|$|R
25|$|<b>Polls</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> if the two-state {{solution}} were {{taken off the}} table, a strong majority of Americans would favor a one-state solution in which Jews and Arabs would have equal citizenship and rights.

25|$|To {{encourage}} {{investment in}} wind power, families were offered a tax exemption for generating their own electricity {{within their own}} or an adjoining municipality. While this could involve purchasing a turbine outright, more often families purchased shares in wind turbine cooperatives which in turn invested in community wind turbines. By 1996 there were around 2,100 such cooperatives in the country. Opinion <b>polls</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> this direct involvement has helped the popularity of wind turbines, with some 86% of Danes supporting wind energy when compared with existing fuel sources.|$|E
25|$|As {{official}} {{religious statistics}} are forbidden in France, {{there are no}} official figures about religious practices in Brittany. However, successive <b>polls</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> the region {{tends to be more}} and more nonreligious. Catholic religion has started to decline after the Second World War, during the urbanisation of Brittany. A poll conducted in 2006 showed that Morbihan was the only département to have a strong Catholic population, around 70% of its inhabitants belonging to that religion. Loire-Atlantique and Côtes-d'Armor were among the least Catholic French départements, with only 50% of Catholics, while Ille-et-Vilaine and Finistère were at around 65%. Other religions are almost non-existent, apart from Islam which gathers between 1 and 3% of the inhabitants in Ille-et-Vilaine and Loire-Atlantique.|$|E

25|$|Numerous {{breakaway}} parties, {{such as the}} Anatolia Party, the Democratic Progress Party and the Nation and Justice Party {{were formed}} by former MPs of the CHP and AKP. In the end, only the Anatolia Party fielded candidates for election. The AKP, CHP and MHP all held leadership elections in the lead-up to the election, with Ahmet Davutoğlu elected unopposed as the AKP leader during the party's first extraordinary congress in August 2014. The MHP's long-time leader Devlet Bahçeli was re-elected unopposed during the 2015 MHP Extraordinary Congress, with his rivals unable to gain enough signatures to contest the leadership election. Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu was re-elected as CHP leader during the party's 2014 Extraordinary Convention, defeating his rival Muharrem İnce. The HDP has a co-presidential system, where one male and one female leader are elected. The party's chairman and chairwoman are Selahattin Demirtaş and Figen Yüksekdağ. Many opposition commentators and opinion <b>polls</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> the public largely regard President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, the AKP's founder who constitutionally must remain neutral as President, as the de facto leader of the AKP. Of the 20 parties contesting the election, only two party leaders were women. These were Emine Ülker Tarhan of the Anatolia Party and Özlem Şen Abay of the Communist Party.|$|E

2500|$|The latest <b>polls</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> {{approximately}} 26% to 38% of Finns {{would like}} to see Karelia return to Finnish control and some 51% to 62% would oppose such a move. In Russia, people associate the word [...] "Karelia" [...] with the Republic of Karelia instead of Finnish Karelia, which makes conducting polls more difficult. In a 1999 poll by MTV3, 34% of the people of Vyborg supported returning Karelia to Finland and 57% were opposed. Vyborg {{and the rest of the}} ceded Karelia outside the Republic of Karelia nowadays contain very few ethnic Finns, and is almost exclusively inhabited by people who moved there during the Soviet era and their descendants.|$|E

2500|$|As {{was true}} historically, though, {{there are far}} more libertarians in the US than those who belong to the party touting that name. In the United States, libertarians may {{emphasize}} economic and constitutional rather than religious and personal policies, or personal and international rather than economic policies, such as the Tea Party movement, founded in 2009, which has become a major outlet for Libertarian Republican ideas especially rigorous adherence to the US Constitution, lower taxes and an opposition to a growing role for the federal government in health care. However <b>polls</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> many people who identify as Tea Party members do not hold traditional libertarian views on most social issues, and tend to poll similarly to socially conservative Republicans. Eventually during the 2016 presidential election many Tea Party members abandoned more libertarian leaning views in favor of Donald Trump and his right wing populism [...]|$|E
2500|$|Although <b>polls</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> many Catholics dissent {{from church}} {{teaching}} on contraception, there has nevertheless been {{a resurgence of}} support for it in certain quarters, from Roman Catholic theologians such as, Germain Grisez, Janet E. Smith, Mary Shivanandan, Scott and his wife Kimberly Hahn. They along with numerous Catholic authors and speakers such as such as Christopher West, Matt Fradd, Jason Evert, and Leah Darrow are currently advancing a deeper appreciation {{and understanding of the}} Church's teaching regarding sex and marriage. At the official level, Catholicism’s commitment to Humanae Vitae is more stable than ever. [...] According to John L. Allen, Jr., [...] "In addition, three decades of bishops’ appointments by John Paul II and Benedict XVI, both unambiguously committed to Humanae Vitae, mean that senior leaders in Catholicism these days are far less inclined than they were in 1968 to distance themselves from the ban on birth control, or to soft-pedal it. A striking number of Catholic bishops have recently brought out documents of their own defending Humanae Vitae. [...] Also, developments in fertility awareness since the 1960s [...] have given rise to natural family planning organizations such as the , Couple to Couple League and the Creighton Model FertilityCare System, which actively provide formal instruction on the use and reliability of natural methods of birth control.|$|E
