The objective of the workshop was to analyse which juvenile animal studies proposals were received and agreed by the Paediatric Committee, to check consistency and how to apply the existing European guideline on juvenile animal studies. A comparison of main organ system development in man vs. animal species was presented to guide the review and to support species selection and protocol design.

Out of 109 <b>paediatric</b> <b>investigation</b> <b>plans</b> finalised between November 2008 and March 2009, 43 included one or more juvenile animal studies. In most cases the preferred species was the rat; one species only was requested to be studied (20 / 22), but in a minority two species were required (2 / 22). When deciding on the characteristics of the juvenile animal studies, such as age of animals at study start, the age of the children targeted by the medicine was considered. It is expected that the increasing experience gained by Applicants and Regulators will allow further refining the criteria for these juvenile animal studies.

40|$|Aims In the EU, {{development}} of new medicines for children should follow a prospectively agreed <b>paediatric</b> <b>investigation</b> <b>plan</b> (PIP). Finding the right dose for children is crucial but challenging due to the variability of pharmacokinetics across age groups and the limited sample sizes available. We examined strategies adopted in PIPs to support paediatric dosing recommendations to identify common assumptions underlying dose investigations and the attempts planned to verify them in children. Methods We extracted data from 73 PIP opinions recently adopted by the Paediatric Committee of the European Medicines Agency. These opinions represented 79 medicinal development programmes and comprised a total of 97 dose investigation studies. We identified the design of these dose investigation studies, recorded the analyses planned and determined the criteria used to define target doses. Results Most dose investigation studies are clinical trials (83 of 97) that evaluate a single dosing rule. Sample sizes used to investigate dose are highly variable across programmes, with smaller numbers used in younger children (< 2 years). Many studies (40 of 97) do not pre-specify a target dose criterion. Of those that do, most (33 of 57 studies) guide decisions using pharmacokinetic data alone. Conclusions Common assumptions underlying dose investigation strategies include dose proportionality and similar exposure−response relationships in adults and children. Few development programmes pre-specify steps to verify assumptions in children. There is scope {{for the use of}} Bayesian methods as a framework for synthesizing existing information to quantify prior uncertainty about assumptions.

Responding to this mandate, five FP 7 project calls were launched and 20 projects were granted. This paper aims to detail the funded projects and their preliminary results. Publicly available sources have been consulted and a descriptive analysis has been performed. Twenty Research Consortia including 246 partners in 29 European and non-European countries were created (involving 129 universities or public funded research organisations, 51 private companies with 40 SMEs, 7 patient associations). The funded projects investigate 24 medicines, covering 10 therapeutic areas in all paediatric age groups.

40|$|The {{availability}} of licensed paediatric drugs is lagging behind those for adults, {{and there is}} a lack of safe formulations in suitable doses that children are able and willing to take. As a consequence, children are commonly treated with off-label or unlicensed drugs. As off-label and unlicensed drug use are associated with a greater risk for harm than on-label drug use, a range of global initiatives have been developed to realize "better" medicines for children. This review describes the challenges and achievements of the European Union to realize this goal, with a focus on paediatric drug development and formulation design. In 2007, a European Paediatric Regulation was installed enforcing companies to consider children in the early development of drugs with a new drug substance, for a new indication or with a new route of administration. The Regulation, e. g. requires companies to develop a <b>paediatric</b> <b>investigation</b> <b>plan</b> discussing the proposed clinical trials in children of different ages and the formulations for future marketing. Since 2013, the pharmaceutical design of any newly marketed paediatric drug should comply with the "Guideline on the Pharmaceutical Development of Medicines for Paediatric Use. " Companies should, e. g. justify the route of administration, dosage form, formulation characteristics, safety of excipients, dosing frequency, container closure system, administration device, patient acceptability and user information. In this review, the guideline's key aspects are discussed with a focus on novel formulations such as mini-tablets and orodispersible films, excipients with a potential risk for harm such as azo dyes and adequate user instructions...|$|E
40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Since 2007, it is {{mandatory}} for {{the pharmaceutical companies}} to submit a <b>Paediatric</b> <b>Investigation</b> <b>Plan</b> to the Paediatric Committee at the European Medicines Agency for any drug in development in adults, and it often leads {{to the need to}} conduct a pharmacokinetic study in children. Pharmacokinetic studies in children raise ethical and methodological issues. Because of limitation of sampling times, appropriate methods, such as the population approach, are necessary for analysis of the pharmacokinetic data. The choice of the pharmacokinetic sampling design has an important impact on the precision of population parameter estimates. Approaches for design evaluation and optimization based on the evaluation of the Fisher information matrix (M(F)) have been proposed and are now implemented in several software packages, such as PFIM in R. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this work were to (1) develop a joint population pharmacokinetic model to describe the pharmacokinetic characteristics of a drug S and its active metabolite in children after intravenous drug administration from simulated plasma concentration-time data produced using physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) predictions; (2) optimize the pharmacokinetic sampling times for an upcoming clinical study using a multi-response design approach, considering clinical constraints; and (3) evaluate the resulting design taking data below the lower limit of quantification (BLQ) into account. METHODS: Plasma concentration-time profiles were simulated in children using a PBPK model previously developed with the software SIMCYP(®) for the parent drug and its active metabolite. Data were analysed using non-linear mixed-effect models with the software NONMEM(®), using a joint model for the parent drug and its metabolite. The population pharmacokinetic design, for the future study in 82 children from 2 to 18 years old, each receiving a single dose of the drug, was then optimized using PFIM, assuming identical times for parent and metabolite concentration measurements and considering clinical constraints. Design evaluation was based on the relative standard errors (RSEs) of the parameters of interest. In the final evaluation of the proposed design, an approach was used to assess the possible effect of BLQ concentrations on the design efficiency. This approach consists of rescaling the M(F), using, at each sampling time, the probability of observing a concentration BLQ computed from Monte-Carlo simulations. RESULTS: A joint pharmacokinetic model with three compartments for the parent drug and one for its active metabolite, with random effects on four parameters, was used to fit the simulated PBPK concentration-time data. A combined error model best described the residual variability. Parameters and dose were expressed per kilogram of bodyweight. Reaching a compromise between PFIM results and clinical constraints, the optimal design was composed of four samples at 0. 1, 1. 8, 5 and 10 h after drug injection. This design predicted RSE lower than 30 % for the four parameters of interest. For this design, rescaling M(F) for BLQ data had very little influence on predicted RSE. CONCLUSION: PFIM was a useful tool to find an optimal sampling design in children, considering clinical constraints. Even if it was not forecasted initially by the investigators, this approach showed that it was really necessary to include a late sampling time for all children. Moreover, we described an approach to evaluate designs assuming expected proportions of BLQ data are omitted...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Ciprofloxacin Therapy for Neonates and Young Infants: A Clinical Pharmacological Perspective {{including}} Pharmacokinetics (PK) and Pharmacodynamics (PD). Severe infection due to Gram-negative bacteraemia increases {{mortality and}} long term consequences of morbidity. In Liverpool Women’s NHS FT neonatal unit mortality increased from 20 % for the more premature babies to 44 %. Ciprofloxacin is a synthetic fluoroquinolone prescribed for suspected or proven Gram-negative infection in many neonatal units throughout Europe (25 %). At present this drug is not authorised for this population and is prescribed off label. The optimal drug regimen is unknown resulting {{in a wide range}} of regimens (5 to 60 mg/kg/day) prescribed internationally. The TINN Consortium ‘Treat Infection in Neonates’ were funded by a European Union FP 7 grant to develop a <b>Paediatric</b> <b>Investigation</b> <b>Plan</b> in line with the EU Paediatric Regulations and European Medicines Agency requirements. This thesis describes a prospective population PK clinical trial as part of the work of TINN, a retrospective clinical outcome study in neonates and infants with late onset Gram-negative sepsis and a framework to facilitate PK-PD research. The pharmacokinetic (PK) clinical trial of ciprofloxacin recruited 64 babies including a minimum of seven recruits representing every four weeks of development. The median post menstrual age in weeks was 35. 7 (6. 5) (range 24. 9 - 47. 9). Blood samples (n = 265) were collected at pre-defined informative time points in addition to 165 samples scavenged from clinically indicated blood tests, in total 430. A two compartment model with first-order elimination fitted the data. PK parameters included maximum concentration, clearance, area under the curve (0 -tau), apparent volume of distribution and half-life and selected covariates with their inter-individual variability (CV%). Based on adult PD targets the minimum area under the curve /minimum inhibitory concentration (AUC/MIC) ratio 125 was achieved by 85 % of this population. Higher AUC 24 hour/MIC targets > 250 may be required for serious infections yet few (42 %) of this population achieved this. The optimal AUC/MIC ratio for neonates is unknown. Clearance increased with post-natal age yet the combined effect of PMA at birth and corrected gestational age had a greater effect on clearance. Clearance reduced by 29 % with co-administration of inotropes associated with underlying renal compromise. Monte Carlo simulation demonstrated that the AUC 24 /MIC 125 was achieved by 90 % of neonates < 34 weeks PMA administered 7. 5 mg/kg/day and 84 % of those ≥ 34 PMA administered 12. 5 mg/kg/day. Ciprofloxacin is lipophilic and has good tissue penetration. CSF concentrations achieved a ratio of 0. 33 of the serum plasma concentrations. Pharmacodynamic data included a retrospective cohort study over a six year period of neonates with confirmed Gram-negative organisms in blood cultures. Organisms retrieved from the clinical laboratory (n= 88) were re-cultured and the MIC ciprofloxacin determined using an E Test. A sub-group were administered ciprofloxacin (n= 33); each organism’s MIC was compared with the same neonate’s clinical outcome. Relatively higher MICs within the susceptible range were associated with a greater risk of treatment failure. These data were not statistically significant due to the low incidence of confirmed Gram-negative bacteraemia (1. 3 %). The clinical implications are that more intensive dosage regimens may be required or a lower clinical breakpoint subject to further PD and safety data. Too few organisms were available to determine if the MIC increased annually but the incidence of ciprofloxacin resistance in surveillance surface swabs was no higher than for gentamicin. To prepare for a future pharmacogenomic study, DNA scavenged from clinical blood samples were compared to a buccal scrape to evaluate whether this less invasive method is reliable. A substantially larger quantity and higher quality of DNA was obtained from scavenged blood. A sub-group were transfused with leukocyte depleted products for their clinical care prior to DNA sampling. The genotyping of allelic polymorphisms were not affected by the donor’s blood sufficiently to affect the genetic fingerprint. This indicates that prior blood transfusions should not be a contra-indication to scavenging blood for pharmacogenetic purposes. The challenges of PK/PD trials in this vulnerable population were explored. The majority were recruited in intensive care and had comorbidity and extreme prematurity. Due to the complexity of critical illness there are limitations to interpreting clinical outcome or safety data from a PK clinical trial design. There were no suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions. Arthralgia was not reported but is difficult to assess in non-weight bearing non-vocal neonates and young infants. A proportionate regulatory model of neonatal PK clinical trials was developed with the Medicines and Health Care Products Regulatory Agency. A framework for pharmacovigilance reporting during critical illness which avoided nuisance reporting was developed. The impact was assessed by an observational case study and review of discharge letters to illustrate the challenge of attributing causality. Individualised therapy may be required in critical illness. The correct dose of an antimicrobial may change daily during the sepsis episode. The inter- and intra-individual variability in parameters is associated with dynamic changes during neonatal development and the effects of critical illness. Further outcome and safety data are required to determine the optimal AUC 24 /MIC ratio. Paediatric clinical breakpoints specific to each sub-age group of children are required. Individualised therapy may be required to optimise clinical outcome and minimise resistance...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSeven {{years after}} {{the launch of the}} European Paediatric Medicine Regulation, limited {{progress}} in paediatric oncology drug development remains a major concern amongst stakeholders – academics, industry, regulatory authorities, parents, patients and caregivers. Restricted increases in early phase paediatric oncology trials, legal requirements and regulatory pressure to propose early <b>Paediatric</b> <b>Investigation</b> <b>Plans</b> (PIPs), missed opportunities to explore new drugs potentially relevant for paediatric malignancies, lack of innovative trial designs and no new incentives to develop drugs against specific paediatric targets are some unmet needs. Better access to new anti-cancer drugs for paediatric clinical studies and improved collaboration between stakeholders are essential. The Cancer Drug Development Forum (CDDF), previously Biotherapy Development Association (BDA), with Innovative Therapy for Children with Cancer Consortium (ITCC), European Society for Paediatric Oncology (SIOPE) and European Network for Cancer Research in Children and Adolescents (ENCCA) has created a unique Paediatric Oncology Platform, involving multiple stakeholders and the European Union (EU) Commission, with an urgent remit to improve paediatric oncology drug development. The Paediatric Oncology Platform proposes to recommend immediate changes in the implementation of the Regulation and set the framework for its 2017 revision; initiatives to incentivise drug development against specific paediatric oncology targets, and repositioning of drugs not developed in adults. Underpinning these changes is a strategy for mechanism of action and biology driven selection and prioritisation of potential paediatric indications rather than the current process based on adult cancer indications. Pre-competitive research and drug prioritisation, early portfolio evaluation, cross-industry cooperation and multi-compound/sponsor trials are being explored, from which guidance for innovative trial designs will be provided...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Pharmaceutical {{industry}} {{is no longer}} allowed to develop new medicines for use in adults only, as the 2007 Paediatric Regulation requires children to be considered also. The plans for such paediatric development called <b>Paediatric</b> <b>Investigation</b> <b>Plans</b> (PIPs) are subject to agreement by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and its Paediatric Committee (PDCO). The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the key characteristics of oral paediatric medicines in the PIPs and the changes implemented as a result of the EMA/PDCO review. METHODS: All PIPs agreed by 31 December 2011 were identified through a proprietary EMA-database. PIPs were included if they contained an agreed proposal to develop an oral medicine for children 0 to 11 years. Information on the therapeutic area (EMA classification system); target age range (as defined by industry) and pharmaceutical characteristics (active substance, dosage form(s) as listed in the PIP, strength of each dosage form, excipients in each strength of each dosage form) was extracted from the EMA website or the EMA/PDCO assessment reports. RESULTS: A hundred and fifty PIPs were included corresponding to 16 therapeutic areas and 220 oral dosage forms in 431 strengths/compositions. Eighty-two PIPs (37 %) included tablets, 44 (20 %) liquids and 35 (16 %) dosage forms with a specific composition/strength that were stored as a solid but swallowed as a liquid e. g. dispersible tablets. The EMA/PDCO review resulted in an increase of 13 (207 to 220) oral paediatric dosage forms and 44 (387 to 431) dosage forms with a specific composition/strength. For many PIPs, the target age range was widened and the excipient composition and usability aspects modified. CONCLUSION: The EMA/PDCO review realized an increase in the number of requirements for the development of oral dosage forms and a larger increase in the number of dosage forms with a specific composition/strength, both targeting younger children. Changes to their pharmaceutical design were less profound...|$|R
40|$|Background: Drug {{development}} for rare diseases is challenging, especially when these orphan drugs (OD) {{are intended for}} children. In 2007 the EU Paediatric Drug Regulation was enacted to improve the development of high quality and ethically researched medicines for children through the establishment of <b>Paediatric</b> <b>Investigation</b> <b>Plans</b> (PIPs). The effect of the EU Paediatric Drug Regulation on the marketing authorisation (MA) of drugs for children with rare diseases was studied. Methods: Data on all designated orphan drugs, their indication, MA, PIPs and indication group (adult or child) {{were obtained from the}} European Medicines Agency (EMA). The outcome and duration of the process from orphan drug designation (ODD) to MA, was compared, per indication, by age group. The effect of the Paediatric Drug Regulation, implemented in 2007, on the application process was assessed with survival analysis. Results: Eighty-one orphan drugs obtained MA since 2000 and half are authorised for (a subgroup of) children; another 34 are currently undergoing further investigations in children through agreed PIPs. The Paediatric Drug Regulation did not significantly increase the number of ODDs with potential paediatric indications (58 % before vs 64 % after 2007 of ODDs, p = 0. 1) and did not lead to more MAs for ODs with paediatric indications (60 % vs 43 %, p = 0. 22). ODs authorised after 2007 had a longer time to MA than those authorised before 2007 (Hazard ratio (95 % CI) 2. 80 (1. 84 - 4. 28), p < 0. 001); potential paediatric use did not influence the time to MA (Hazard ratio (95 % CI) 1. 14 (0. 77 - 1. 70), p = 0. 52). Conclusions: The EU Paediatric Drug Regulation had a minor impact on development and availability of ODs for children, was associated with a longer time to MA, but ensured the further paediatric development of drugs still off-label to children. The impact of the Paediatric Drug Regulation on research quantity and quality in children through PIPs is not yet clea...|$|R

Corrective Action Unit 263 is located southwest of Building 4839, in the Central Propellant Storage Area. Operations in Building 4839 from 1968 to 1996 resulted in effluent releases to the leachfield and associated collection system. In general, effluent released to the leachfield consisted of sanitary wastewater from a toilet, urinal, lavatory, and drinking fountain located within Building 4839. The subsurface soils {{in the vicinity of the}} collection system and leachfield may have been impacted by effluent containing contaminants of potential concern generated by support activities associated with the Building 4839 operations...|$|R
