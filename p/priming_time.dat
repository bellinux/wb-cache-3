40|$|Recapitulation of endochondral {{ossification}} {{leads to}} a new concept of bone tissue engineering via a cartilage intermediate as an osteoinductive template. In this study, we aimed to investigate the influence of in vitro chondrogenic <b>priming</b> <b>time</b> {{for the creation of}} cartilage template on the in vivo endochondral bone formation both qualitatively and quantitatively. To this end, rat bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) were seeded onto two scaffolds with distinguished features: a fibrous poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) /poly(epsilon-caprolactone) electrospun scaffold (PLGA/PCL) and a porous hydroxyapatite/tricalcium phosphate composite (HA/TCP). The constructs were then chondrogenically differentiated for 2, 3 and 4 weeks in vitro, followed by subcutaneous implantation in vivo for up to 8 weeks. A longer chondrogenic <b>priming</b> <b>time</b> resulted in a significantly increased amount and homogeneous deposition of the cartilage matrix on both the PLGA/PCL and HA/TCP scaffolds in vitro. In vivo, all implanted constructs gave rise to endochondral bone formation, whereas the bone volume was not affected by the length of <b>priming</b> <b>time.</b> An unpolarized woven bone-like structure, with significant amounts of cartilage remaining, was generated in fibrous PLGA/PCL scaffolds, while porous HA/TCP scaffolds supported progressive lamellar-like bone formation with mature bone marrow development. These data suggest that, by utilizing a chondrogenically differentiated MSC-scaffold construct as cartilage template, 2 weeks of in vitro <b>priming</b> <b>time</b> is sufficient to generate a substantial amount of vascularized endochondral bone in vivo. The structure of the bone depends on the chemical and structural cues provided by the scaffold design...|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effect of prolonged application time of primers on the marginal adaption after extended times for demineralising enamel or dentin surfaces with phosphoric acid. Additionally, the influence of thermocycling procedures was investigated. 144 human caries free premolars were subjected to 576 marginal adaption examinations. Standardized class V cavities were prepared into caries-free human premolars. All cavities were conditioned by phosphoric acid for either 15 s, 30 s or 60 s, rewetted and then treated with one of the following etch & rinse adhesives OptiBond FL, Prime&Bond NT, Excite by applying the primer for either 30 s or 60 s. The composite resin Filtek Z 250 was incrementally placed in the cavities. After polishing the samples were stored in water for 21 days and then thermocycled (2000 cycles between 5 °C and 55 °C, exposure time 30 s). Before and after the thermocycling procedure replica were taken for the margin analysis in the SEM at a magnification of 200 x using defined criteria. Statistical evaluation of the quantitative margin analysis using SPSS for enamel showed neither significant differences between the different primer application periods nor between the different etching times regarding “margin quality 1 ”. Analysis of dentin obtained the following results: Excite showed significantly better results when the primer was applied for 60 s compared to the results for 30 s. OptiBond FL and Prime&Bond NT did not show any significant differences in marginal adaptation regardless of the phosphoric acid etching and priming times. There were no statistically significant differences between the results for OptiBond FL and Prime&Bond NT. <b>Priming</b> <b>time</b> of 60 s showed a significant effect for Excite for etching times of 15 s and 30 s. Additionally, only Excite showed significantly better results when applying the adhesive for 60 s. The results showed, that a combination of 15 s phosphoric acid etching and 30 s of priming is sufficient for all tested adhesives in enamel. Extended <b>priming</b> <b>time</b> did not improve the marginal adaption, even if enamel is conditioned up to 60 s. For dentin the sufficient <b>priming</b> <b>time</b> depended on the adhesive system used.

Guarantee of their reliable working in space depends on thermocontrol system (TCS) operation that is confirmed by qualification working-off ground tests both with heat pipes separately and when they are a part of satellite TCS.

40|$|Siphonic roof {{drainage}} {{systems have been}} in existence for more than 40 years and are becoming an increasingly common element of urban drainage infrastructure. A siphonic system allows roof runoff to quickly reach its maximum flowrate. In contrast to a conventional system the siphonic approach to roof drainage aims to exclude air and to induce the full bore flow conditions required for siphonic action. This means that the filling and priming times are more efficient and quicker than for a conventional gravity-fed roof drainage system. Understanding the <b>priming</b> <b>time</b> of siphonic systems can help to identify potential problems in large systems {{that may not be}} able to fill and prime quickly enough to deal with high-intensity storms of short duration.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} cognitive relevance of selected morphological and phonological {{units in the}} Arabic mental lexicon. The morphological units are sound and weak roots, etymons, phonetic matrices, and sound and weak patterns. The phonological units are vowels and consonants. The work is motivated by a controversy in Arabic morphology that is paralleled by a cross-linguistic debate in lexical processing. There are two views in Arabic morphology, the stem-based theory and the morpheme-based theory that is represented by two sub-theories. The first sub-theory argues that derivations are based on roots and patterns and the second proposes that the root should {{be replaced by the}} etymon and the phonetic matrix. The morpheme-based theory is congruent with lexical processing hypotheses that propose that complex words are accessed and represented as morphemes. The stem-based theory maintains that derivation is stem or word-based and is in line with the whole word hypothesis of lexical processing. These theoretical positions on Arabic morphology and lexical processing were tested in six priming experiments. One objective of these experiments was to test which of these morphemes prime word recognition. Another objective was to test the prediction of connectionism, another lexical processing hypothesis, that <b>priming</b> <b>time</b> correlates with prime-target overlap. A third objective was to examine how abstract the processing of these morphemes could be. The cognitive status of vowels and consonants was tested using a letter-circling task. The results of the online studies have shown that both roots and etymons facilitate word recognition significantly more than orthographic controls. However, non-ordered etymons, phonetic matrices, and patterns did not facilitate word recognition. Weak roots had priming effects only when primes and targets shared a vague semantic relationship. There was no correlation between <b>priming</b> <b>time</b> and meaning and/or form overlap. The lack of priming with non-ordered etymons suggests that there could be limits on abstractness in lexical processing. The results of the offline task suggest that root consonants are more salient than other letters. On the whole, the results support a morpheme-based theory of Arabic morphology and a localist view of lexical processing that assumes a morphemic stage in word recognition...|$|E

In order to optimize the delivery of specific biological fluids to target regions in microfluidic capillary autonomous systems (CAS), we analyze self-priming of liquid water into a microfluidic device consisting of a microfluidic channel that feeds a rectangular microfluidic cavity trough an appropriately designed micro-chamber. The target performance criteria in our optimization are (1) fast and complete wetting of the cavity bottom while (2) minimizing the probability of trapping air bubble in the device. The numerical model {{is based on the}} lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) and a three-dimensional single-component multiple-phase (SCMP) scheme. By using a parallel implementation of this algorithm, we investigate the physical processes related to the invasion of the liquid-gas interfaces in rectangular cavities at different liquid-solid contact angle and shapes of the transition micro-chamber. The numerical results has successfully captured important qualitative and some key quantitative effects of the liquid-solid contact angle, the roughness of the cavity edges, the depth of the holes and shape of the micro-chambers.

Seeds were hydrated at 100 % relative humidity for 0, 2, or 10 d at Weeks 1, 6, or 12 of after-ripening. Dormancy status was assessed after each hydration treatment by measuring seed germination at 12 -hourly alternating 25 / 15 C (light/dark) periods using seeds directly from the hydration treatment and seeds subjected to 4 d postpriming desiccation. Seeds exposed {{to one or more}} hydration events during the 12 wk were less dormant than seeds that remained dry throughout after-ripening.

In this study an experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of different time seed priming (osmo-hydropriming) on germination and seedling growth of Secale montanume seeds under drought conditions. Seeds were immersed in water with osmotic potentials of- 0. 5,- 1 and- 1. 5 MPa. PEG 600 was employed to induce the required levels of osmotic potentials. Induction of hydropriming was obtained by immersing the seeds in distilled water with aeration and no aeration conditions. Both two priming treatments were conducted at 3 time duration (6, 12 and 24 hours). These primed seeds were germinated and grew at osmotic potentials of 0 (distilled water),- 0. 5,- 1, and- 1. 5 MPa by PEG 6000. Results showed that the seed germination and seed growth were inhibited by increasing drought stress as the germination percentage of hydroprimed seeds with aeration was reduced from 74. 02 % to 60. 45 %.

Furthermore, we offer evidence suggesting that the structure(s) on meningococcus that trigger this suppression is heat labile and different from the antigenic structure(s) recognized by the suppressed B cells. In addition, we found that there is a gradual increase in antibody secretion rates of N. meningitidis-induced anti-PC plaque-forming cells that correlates with N. meningitidis <b>priming</b> <b>time.</b> Rather unexpected was the fact that pretreatment of mice with PC-keyhole limpet hemocyanin (thymus-dependent antigen) had a great influence on the subsequent PC-specific immunoresponses induced by N. meningitidis and PC-coupled heat-inactivated meningococcus [PC-(NMB) HI], as shown by (i) a striking decrease in T 15 idiotype expression, (ii) concomitant direct anti-PC plaque-forming cells reduction, (iii) switching to immunoglobulin G (N. meningitidis-induced immunoresponse) or immunoglobulin G plus immunoglobulin A [PC-(NMB) HI-induced immunoresponse], and (iv) a significant increase in heterogeneity of plaque-forming cell secretion rates.

40|$|Cheeses of low pH, such as Feta, Blue, Cream and Cheshire, often exude whey after manufacture. This {{exudation}} {{lowers the}} yield and reduces product acceptability. Virtually no scientific {{study has been}} undertaken on this subject. Investigations were therefore undertaken to determine the factors affecting exudation and to elucidate the underlying mechanism. Cream cheese made by the hot-pack method and recombined Feta cheese made by the traditional method, representing unripened and ripened varieties of cheese respectively, were studied. In Cream cheese the amount of exudate increased with decreased protein to fat (P /F) ratio, decreased homogenisation pressure, decreased pasteurisation temperature, decreased pH at cooking, decreased cooking temperature, increased storage temperature and increased storage time. Within the selected limits of variation of P /F ratio, fat did not affect exudation. However, an increase of moisture in non-fat substance resulted in an increased amount of exudate. The effect of homogenisation pressure appears {{to be due to}} the increase in the fat globule surface area and the increase in the coating of fat globule with casein. The partial heat-denaturation of the whey proteins in the cheesemilk was effective in reducing the rate of exudation, possibly due to the complex formation between 13 -lactoglobulin and K-casein that prevented fusion of casein micelles. Residual lactose and pH did not change, and proteolysis was not detected up to 16 weeks in Cream cheese stored at 5 · C. It is concluded that exudation from Cream cheese does not occur due to any gross chemical changes during storage. Manufacture of Feta cheese involved the use of recombined cow's milk and vacuum packaging of cheese after brining. A storage study of Feta cheese up to 6 months showed steady proteolysis, slow metabolism of residual lactose and a gradual decrease of pH. The water activity of the cheese depended on the salt-in-moisture concentration. In Feta cheese the amount of exudate increased with increased P /F ratio, i ncreased pH at draining, increased residual rennet, packaging cheese without vacuum, increased storage temperature and increased storage time. Variation of <b>priming</b> <b>time,</b> with a constant curd pH at draining, did not affect exudation. Unlike Cream cheese, an increase in protein and a decrease in fat content in Feta correlated with increase in the amount of exudate. The effects of change in pH and calcium (within a range expected in normal Feta) on exudation were minor. Homogenisation was effective in reducing the rate of exudation in Feta cheese. However, a variation in the homogenisation pressure had no effect. The type of material adsorbed to the fat globule surface influences syneresis during manufacture as well as subsequent exudation during storage. The effect of a reduction in the size of fat globules on exudation appears to be less important. In Feta cheese the incorporation of heat-denatured whey proteins did not affect exudation. However, there was a substantial increase in yield. Proteolysis is the dominant factor affecting exudation. Its influence is apparently due to the disintegration of the casein network and the release of water physically held in the capillaries. Exudation is also substantially influenced by the gradient in NaCl concentration in Feta cheese following brining. Denaturation of whey proteins in Cream cheese; and homogenisation, controlled proteolysis, decreased salt gradient, use of vacuum packaging in Feta cheese appear to be the main factors available for reducing the extent of exudation. Based on the findings of the investigation a hypothesis is proposed to explain the exudation from cheeses...|$|E
