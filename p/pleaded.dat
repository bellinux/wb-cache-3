5000|$|In {{addition}} to notice <b>pleading,</b> {{a minority of}} states (e.g., California) use an intermediate system known as code <b>pleading.</b> Code <b>pleading</b> is an older system than notice <b>pleading</b> {{and is based on}} legislative statute. It tends to straddle the gulf between obsolete common-law <b>pleading</b> and modern notice <b>pleading.</b> Code <b>pleading</b> places additional burdens on a party to <b>plead</b> the [...] "ultimate facts" [...] of its case, laying out the party's entire case and the facts or allegations underlying it. Notice <b>pleading,</b> by contrast, simply requires a [...] "short and plain statement" [...] showing only that the pleader is entitled to relief. (FRCP 8(a)(2)). One important exception to this rule is that when a party alleges fraud, that party must <b>plead</b> the facts of the alleged fraud with particularity. (FRCP 9(b)).|$|R

40|$|Most {{scholars}} {{mark the}} end of notice <b>pleading</b> in federal civil cases {{at the time of the}} Supreme Court’s 2007 decision in Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly or, at the latest, at the Court’s 2009 decision in Ashcroft v. Iqbal. Scholars have noted occasional departures from the notice <b>pleading</b> standard in more complex civil cases, but notice <b>pleading</b> has been thought to remain the prevalent practice in simple negligence cases. This Article examines two sets of complaints filed in federal district courts in 2006 in cases alleging injuries from simple automobile accidents. We find that notice <b>pleading</b> practice, as indicated by Form 11 in the Appendix of Forms that accompany the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, had already been abandoned in these routine cases before Twombly in favor of narrative <b>pleading</b> that provides a fuller expression of the factual context of the claim. If <b>pleading</b> practice did not follow the notice <b>pleading</b> standard before Twombly in simple negligence cases that had the benefit of specific Form 11 guidance, it is doubtful that attorneys adhered to notice <b>pleading</b> practice in other more complex federal civil cases. In this regard, our findings also raise doubts about the utility of Form 11. In discussing our findings, we also briefly explore the psychology of <b>pleading</b> and whether the emergence of narrative <b>pleading</b> was an unintended consequence of a series of amendments to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure starting in the mid- 1980 s and intended to allow more effective judicial management of litigation. While the Twombly/Iqbal plausibility standard certainly presents a higher standard than notice <b>pleading,</b> the trend is clear: <b>pleading</b> additional facts beyond the requirements of notice <b>pleading</b> predated Twombly or Iqbal and lower courts had already started to abandon the notice <b>pleading</b> standard...|$|R

50|$|Code <b>pleading</b> {{was first}} {{introduced}} in 1850 in New York and in 1872 in California, and eventually spread to 22 other states. Code <b>pleading</b> sought to abolish the distinction between law and equity. It unified civil procedure {{for all types of}} actions as much as possible. The focus shifted from <b>pleading</b> the right form of action (that is, the right procedure) to <b>pleading</b> the right cause of action (that is, a substantive right to be enforced by the law). Under code <b>pleading,</b> the required elements of each action are supposed to be set out in carefully codified statutes.|$|R
50|$|Virginia <b>pleading</b> {{practice}} {{differs from}} that of federal courts and many other states in that it offers no amendments to the pleadings as of right.

A party must instead seek and receive leave to amend before any amended <b>pleading</b> will be accepted, even if that amended <b>pleading</b> is filed before any response to the initial <b>pleading</b> has been received. However, Virginia courts are generally liberal in allowing parties to amend, absent undue delay or prejudice to a party.|$|R

40|$|In Conley v. Gibson, the Supreme Court {{announced}} {{its commitment to}} a liberal <b>pleading</b> regime in federal civil cases, and for decades thereafter was steadfast in resisting ad hoc heightened <b>pleading</b> rules adopted by lower courts. Thus, from 1957 {{until a few years}} ago, most litigants could count on surviving a motion to dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim so long as their <b>pleading</b> provided some minimal notice to the defendant of the nature of their claim. Enter Ashcroft v. Iqbal and Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly. Iqbal and Twombly, by many accounts, two-stepped the Court from notice to heightened “plausibility” <b>pleading</b> for all civil cases. And this shift garnered both applause and withering criticism. No one seems willing to defend the process that the Court used to abandon fifty years of <b>pleading</b> law—shorn as it was of any attention to the procedures contemplated by the Rules Enabling Act—but as a substantive matter, heightened <b>pleading</b> has many adherents. For its advocates, heightened <b>pleading</b> promises to reduce crowded dockets, make discovery available only to worthy litigants, and generally improve the quality of litigation to which attorneys and federal courts devote their attention. And at the bottom of it all lies a fundamental assumption: notice <b>pleading</b> lets in too many meritless cases, and heightened <b>pleading</b> will keep them out. Despite this assumption, however, there has been almost no empirical analysis of the connection between merit and <b>pleading.</b> This Article critically intervenes in this discussion by providing empirical data to question the widespread assumptions about {{the costs and benefits of}} heightened <b>pleading.</b> The data reported here show that pleadings that survive a notice <b>pleading</b> standard but not a heightened <b>pleading</b> standard—what I refer to as “thin” pleadings—are just as likely to be successful as those cases that would survive heightened <b>pleading.</b> Indeed, the research summarized in this Article, gathered through a novel retrospective analysis of appellate and trial court decisions from 1990 to 1999, suggests that there is no correlation between the heft of a <b>pleading</b> and the ultimate success of a case. This Article certainly does not end the debate, but it is better to begin on solid empirical footing than on supposition alone. Although there are limitations to the data reported here, they can make an important contribution to the discussion, and they serve to call attention to the costs of heightened <b>pleading</b> even as they suggest avenues for further research. As Congress, the judiciary, and the academy are engaged in a critical discussion as to how to respond to the Supreme Court’s most recent alteration of <b>pleading</b> jurisprudence, relevant empirical data should be part of the conversation...|$|R
