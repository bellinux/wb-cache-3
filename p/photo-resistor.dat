To insure accuracy of the reproduced data, these systems require frequent calibration and alignment. As the number of tracks on these systems has increased, this task has become more time-consuming. Even with a well-trained technician, this task can take several hours at a minimum. To alleviate this problem, we developed a system for performing this calibration automatically. The implementation utilizes a Fast-Fourier-Transform technique to analyze the output of a pre-recorded signal on tape. The desired response, most frequently defined by IRIG Standards, is stored in a look-up table in the machine. The actual response is compared to that desired, and, under micro-processor control, adjustment made in the signal channel until an acceptable response is achieved. A unique <b>photo-resistor</b> technique {{is used in the}} signal path to control such parameters as gain and phase. A description of the hardware system will be given, as well as a description of the algorithms utilized for implementation...|$|E

The paper proposes a new solution of the solar position sensor used in {{tracking system}} control. The new matrix solar sensor (MSS) is an economic device {{but in the same}} time MSS advantages are the robustness and the accuracy. An actual tracking system that uses the new MSS achieves a position accuracy better then 1 °. The main innovative concept of the new MSS is to use the ancient concept of solar clock to digitize the data set provided by the photosensors matrix area. The new MSS uses eight ordinary <b>photo-resistors.</b> These sensors working principle is to operate in two extreme conditions: in bright area or in shaded area. This binary principle simplifies the operating of the tracking control device.

40|$|The {{fabrication}} of germanium-based near infrared <b>photo-resistors</b> on a flexible substrate is reported. The devices were fabricated using plasma enhanced {{chemical vapor deposition}} of amorphous germanium on an insulating stack layer of silicon nitride and silicon oxide on a flexible polyimide thin film. The deposited films were annealed using a pulsed laser at different pulse rates and laser energy densities to investigate the effects of germanium recrystallization {{on the characteristics of}} the <b>photo-resistors.</b> Electrical and opto-electrical responses of the films have been measured and reported. Surface characterization via scanning electron and atomic force microscopy was used to evaluate the variations in surface roughness of the annealed material versus the amorphous germanium layers. Power spectral density analysis was performed to investigate the effect of laser annealing on the crystalline structure of the germanium samples. Providing a low-temperature processing flow, this work lays the foundation for the development of infrared sensors above flexible substrates with potential applications in wearable electronics among others...|$|R

The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{investigate}} how behavior-based robots can be modeled by non-linear dynamical systems. Taking the example of navigation as a case study, dynamic control architectures are developed and implemented on low-level vehicles. These architectures combine a number of behaviors and lead to ﬂexible and smooth overt behavior which is stably coupled in closed loop with sensory information. Moreover, these architectures also comprise dynamical representations of information which enable the vehicles to exhibit cognitive behaviors such as decision making, memory, forgetting and robustness against noisy sensory information. The design of the individual behaviors, of the representations of particular types of information, {{as well as of}} their coupling is based on the qualitative theory of dynamical systems and dynamic ﬁeld theory. These provide a general theoretical language in which autonomous robot architectures can be built. Dynamical systems theory was used as a theoretical language and tool to design, specify, analyze, simulate and implement behavior-based control architectures. The architectures were fully formulated in terms of dynamics and implemented on computationally modest vehicle platforms based on very low-level sensory information. The main ideas and achievements are the following: 1. Attractor dynamics can be used to control motion based on low-level sensors (a) Robot action can be generated in the manner of control systems, by assigning values to planning (i. e. behavioral) variables continuously in time. A process that can be formalized through dynamical systems. It was shown how an intelligent choice of such planning variables makes it possible to generate ﬂexible behavior from asymptotically stable states (attractors) of such dynamical systems. (b) Generation of behavior is an intrinsically non-linear problem. Behavioral situations exist, in which a minor change in the conﬁguration or sensory situation must elicit a qualitative change in the behavior. This is a simple form of decision making. This non-linearity poses a problem for the design of dynamical systems, as no general theory exists for such systems. (c) Bifurcation theory is one branch of the theory of non-linear dynamical systems that is very structured by powerful theorems. Local bifurcation theory helps to describe how attractors and repellers of dynamical systems may annihilate by collision or emerge through splitting at critical parameter values. Because the approach in this thesis made use of attractor solutions only, local bifurcation theory may be employed to design the dynamical systems such that an appropriate bifurcation is obtained when a behavioral decision must be made. Additional beneﬁts are the contribution of the behavioral dynamics to the overall control theoretic stability of the autonomous robot even when decision making takes place. (d) Sensory information enters into the dynamical system by deﬁning attractive or repulsive values of the planning variables, determining the strength of attraction or repulsion as well as the range of values over which theses forces act. Although the contribution of each individual sensor to the dynamical system is not invariant under change of the values of the planning variables, and neither necessarily generates the right postulated functional form nor necessarily generates the right attractors and repellers, the superposition of all contributions of all sensors does exhibit that invariance and thus generates the designed dynamics. This is ultimately true because the environment is invariant, for instance, under rotation of the vehicles on the spot, and the summed contributions sample that environment. (e) We made a detailed presentation of how individual motion behaviors can be designed, how they can be integrated and moreover how they can be implemented on autonomous vehicles equipped with low-levels sensors like infra-red sensors, sonars, <b>photo-resistors</b> or microphones. (f) Vehicle motion toward targets while simultaneously avoiding obstacles and/or following walls was generated from attractors of dynamical systems of heading direction and path velocity. (g) Vehicle motion toward targets and avoidance of perceived obstructions also was generated from attractors of dynamical systems of angular and path velocities. 2. Dynamic ﬁelds can endow robots with sub-symbolic representations based on low-level sensory information (a) We showed how the ideas of attractor dynamics employed to control the motion of the robots can be extended to the level of representation by using dynamic ﬁelds to interpolate sensory information. (b) We have demonstrated how dynamic ﬁelds can provide robotic systems with sub-symbolic representations that rely on low-level sensory information. These representations enabled a robotic vehicle to exhibit the simplest forms of cognitive abilities. For instance: • A dynamic ﬁeld model for target representation based on low-level sound sensors was built. This permitted the robot to exhibit skills such as detecting targets only if sensory information was consistent, estimating direction to a target through interpolation, deciding which target to track when multiple targets were presented and stabilization of such decision, maintaining targets in short-term memory during momentary absence of pertinent sensory information, and deleting a memory item after a characteristic delay to clear the memory from obsolete information. • A dynamic ﬁeld model for wall representation based on low-level distance sensors (infra-red sensors and sonars) was also built that supported wall detection, robust wall orientation estimation and wall selection. 3. Representations can be integrated with stable action planning and control (a) The pattern of activation in a dynamic ﬁeld shapes continuously in time the vector ﬁeld of the dynamics of the behavior to which it is dedicated: i. The value over which a peak of positive activation is centered de- ﬁnes an attractive value of the planning variable used to design the behavioral dynamics. ii. The amount of total positive activation in the ﬁeld determines the attraction strength of that force. iii. Because the ﬁeld dynamics is invariant under rotations of the vehicle on the spot so is the dynamics that brings about the motion of the vehicle. (b) The amount of positive activation in a dynamic ﬁeld may also inhibit the contribution of other behaviors to the complete behavioral dynamics. (c) The time scale of the ﬁeld dynamics is set much faster than that of the planning variables so that the ﬁeld has typically relaxed to a stable pattern on the time scale on which the movement plans of the robot evolve. The resulting behavior is therefore stable. (d) Two examples are: • The dynamic ﬁeld for target representation speciﬁes the particular form of the target acquisition dynamics. • Analogously, the dynamic ﬁeld for wall representation speciﬁes the wall-following dynamics. • The dynamic ﬁeld for wall representation inhibits the contribution of obstacle avoidance to the planning dynamics when a wall is detected. 4. Navigation in non-engineered environments (a) The smooth overt behavior generated when the systems are set to work in non-structured environments was documented. (b) The implementation of the dynamic ﬁeld for target representation on a small autonomous vehicle enabled it to ﬁnd sound sources while avoiding obstacles. Memory helped to keep it moving toward the target during the periods when sensory information was not available. Decision making enabled the vehicle to track only one sound source. Hysteresis in the ﬁeld dynamics enabled the vehicle to continue moving toward the selected sound target even when it approach a second sound source of equal intensity due to obstacle avoidance. Detection of a sound target with an intensity near the sensor threshold is stabilized through the cooperative forces within the ﬁeld. (c) The implementation of the dynamic ﬁeld for wall representation on a small autonomous vehicle enabled it to follow walls with various shapes (e. g. planar, circular and concave corners). Decision making allowed to select a wall and hysteresis permitted to maintain the decision stable even when new walls were encountered during the motion course...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} reactor {{system has been}} optimized throughout a series of experiments for making titanium tubes from an electrically heated titanium coil filament by a chemical vapour deposition method, based on the original van Arkel-de Boer -process. The titanium is thermally decomposed on the filament from vapourized titanium tetraiodide in a method not seen in similar experiments. The small-scale reactor is built for this purpose, and the associated systems and methods are developed to maintain the optimal conditions for a continuous metal deposition. A filament current control system is made of an Arduino micro-controller, utilizing a <b>photo-resistor</b> to measure thermal radiation from the filament, working for maintaining a constant filament temperature. Five experiments are conducted with the small-scale reactor and presented in this thesis, where different procedures, materials, duration and amount of starting material is tested. By the use of copper electrodes, it was quickly found that the metal could easily be contaminated from other metal sources. The most important precautions necessary to achieve a good deposition of high purity is to keep {{air out of the}} system, and a purpose-built glove box is made to fulfill this. In the first two experiments, titanium was deposited on a platinum wire and tungsten wire, respectively. In the three following experiments, a titanium coil filament was used, whereas experiment 5 was considered the most successful, by the purity of the deposited titanium and the growth on the coil filament, forming a solid tube.
