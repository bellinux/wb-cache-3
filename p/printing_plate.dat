25|$|Engraving is the {{practice}} of incising a design onto a hard, usually flat surface by cutting grooves into it. The result may be a decorated object in itself, as when silver, gold, steel, or glass are engraved, or may provide an intaglio <b>printing</b> <b>plate,</b> of copper or another metal, for printing images on paper as prints or illustrations; these images are also called engravings. Wood engraving {{is a form of}} relief printing and is not covered in this article.|$|E
25|$|During World War I, several {{ingredients}} of postage stamp ink {{that had previously}} been imported from Germany became unavailable, and the domestic materials that replaced them had significant gritty impurities, with the result that the stamp printing plates became worn much more quickly. In response to this problem, the U.S. Post Office employed the new offset printing process to produce several separate Washington-head issues. The offset method involved taking a photo of a die proof of the postage stamp and through a special process, transferring an image of its negative to a plate of glass, which became the actual <b>printing</b> <b>plate.</b> The set-up and development process was more involved in the preparation stages than the engraving process, but once the photo mask was made it only took about an hour to produce and replace a worn <b>printing</b> <b>plate.</b> The offset process produced an image of lesser quality with a smooth surface, as compared to that of an engraved stamp whose lines are raised above the surface of the paper. A stamp produced by the offset process almost always possesses a softer or grayish tone to its color and is usually easy to distinguish, especially when placed next to a similar stamp printed by the engraving process.|$|E

25|$|Imprimatur {{sheets are}} {{from among the}} first sheets of stamps printed from a {{finished}} <b>printing</b> <b>plate.</b> The actual imprimatur (Let it be printed) refers to the written permission of the Inland Revenue officials entered {{on the back of}} the sheet of stamps. In the 19th century, it was common for officials to remove some stamps from each sheet to present as gifts to dignitaries and other important people. Individual stamps from an Imprimatur sheet can thus be found for sale on the open market.|$|E
25|$|Many booklet stamps can be {{identified}} by one non-perforated edge, though a few are perforated on all edges. On booklets up to 1977, the <b>printing</b> <b>plate</b> construction enabled both upright and inverted watermarks in equal quantities owing to a gutter dividing vertical rows 6 and 7 in the sheets of 12 x 22 stamps.

25|$|Gravure {{printing}} is an {{intaglio printing}} technique, where the image being printed {{is made up}} of small depressions in the surface of the <b>printing</b> <b>plate.</b> The cells are filled with ink, and the excess is scraped off the surface with a doctor blade. Then a rubber-covered roller presses paper onto the surface of the plate and into contact with the ink in the cells. The printing cylinders are usually made from copper plated steel, which is subsequently chromed, and may be produced by diamond engraving; etching, or laser ablation.|$|E

Because of the high relief of the coin die, a test striking was made to see if coins would release from the Confederate die. The die was made by a <b>printing</b> <b>plate</b> engraver (A.H.M. Peterson) in New Orleans who was unfamiliar with techniques required to engrave coining dies. These coins were struck using a U.S. obverse die (Seated Liberty) and the Confederate die made by Peterson. These coins are known as originals, {{and the location of}} all four of the coins is known today.|$|E
25|$|This gallery holds {{machinery}} {{from the}} last of the hot metal typesetting printshops as used in the newspaper industry. The monotype keyboard produces punched 31-level tape for casting on the monotype caster. The keyboard comprises seven QWERTY arrangements (Roman upper and lower case, bold upper and lower case, italic upper and lower case and SMALL CAPITALS). It is operated by compressed air and produces a wide paper tape that contains perforations that when transferred to the caster give full instructions for each character to be cast. The monotype system was widely used in the commercial printing sector. There is a forme (text lines produced on a Linotype typesetting machine) made up into {{the front page of the}} last edition of the Yorkshire Sports, 2 May 1981.

25|$|Many {{collectors}} long {{thought the}} blue plane portion was printed first, {{thus it was}} actually the red frames that were inverted. However, research by noted philatelic authors Henry Goodkind and George Amick shows this to be incorrect; in fact, the frames were printed first {{and it is the}} planes that are upside down. In examples where the plane is so far off center that it overlaps the frames, {{it can be seen that}} the blue ink used to print the plane lies atop the red ink used to print the frames. The Smithsonian's National Postal Museum offers two explanations for how this might have occurred: either a sheet of printed frames was placed in the press upside down for the printing of the plane; or the <b>printing</b> <b>plate</b> used to print the planes was mounted inverted within the printing press.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of the first four designs, {{preparing}} printing plates for each stamp required two separate transfer phases. Two different steel dies were used, one containing the Washington or Franklin engraving, the other providing the framework and lettering. After every image on the steel plate had been impressed with both design components, the plate was heat-treated and hardened to prepare it for printing. In the lower-denomination Washington-Franklin Issues, 400 separate impressions appeared on a <b>printing</b> <b>plate,</b> referred to as a flat plate. The higher value of 1-dollar was printed from a flat plate of 200 subjects. The fifth design required different plates for each of the two elements, as printing took place in two stages: the frame was first printed in color and, in a second impression, the Franklin portrait was laid over it in black. These $2 and $5 values employed plates of 100 subjects.|$|E
25|$|Those {{engraved}} {{images on}} the 2 and 3 cent Washington-head issues that appear similar but whose lines vary significantly are referred to and often cataloged as types. Type I occurs on flat plate printings only while types II & III also occur mostly in rotary press printings and in offset printings as they were produced from photo plates made from the former printing plates. The 2-cent Type II stamp does not occur on a flat plate stamp. Because the commonly used denominations of the Washington-Franklin issues were printed in greater quantities the worn printing plates {{would have to be}} replaced in the process from time to time. Though each new plate was made from the same die transfer, the plates would still differ slightly from the previous plate in use due to the bending process to fit the plate around the rotary press printing cylinder. Plates would also differ because the transfer die itself would wear from repeated image transfers to the <b>printing</b> <b>plate.</b>|$|E

25|$|Laser diodes find wide use in {{telecommunication}} {{as easily}} modulated and easily coupled light sources for fiber optics communication. They {{are used in}} various measuring instruments, such as rangefinders. Another common use is in barcode readers. Visible lasers, typically red but later also green, are common as laser pointers. Both low and high-power diodes are used extensively in the printing industry both as light sources for scanning (input) of images and for very high-speed and high-resolution <b>printing</b> <b>plate</b> (output) manufacturing. Infrared and red laser diodes are common in CD players, CD-ROMs and DVD technology. Violet lasers are used in HD DVD and Blu-ray technology. Diode lasers have also found many applications in laser absorption spectrometry (LAS) for high-speed, low-cost assessment or monitoring of the concentration of various species in gas phase. High-power laser diodes are used in industrial applications such as heat treating, cladding, seam welding and for pumping other lasers, such as diode-pumped solid-state lasers.|$|E

Engraving was a historically important method of producing images on paper, both in artistic printmaking, and also for commercial reproductions and illustrations for books and magazines. It has long been replaced by photography in its commercial applications and, {{partly because of the}} difficulty of learning the technique, is much less common in printmaking, where it has been largely replaced by etching and other techniques. Other terms often used for engravings are copper-plate engraving and Line engraving. These should all mean exactly the same, but especially in the past were often used very loosely to cover several printmaking techniques, so that many so-called engravings were in fact produced by totally different techniques, such as etching.|$|E
