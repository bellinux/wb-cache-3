Comparison with the observed morphology supports the idea that regions of optical emission lie on the local outer boundary of the shell and have not been engulfed by the blast wave.

This is overcome by spacetime objects, a variant of spatial deformation, which alters topology by extruding an object into 4 -D, deforming the 4 -D object and extracting a topologically altered object. However, they are specifically targeted to animation. In this paper, we adapt space-time objects to interactive modelling by: employing a tetrahedral rather than parallelepiped representation; exploiting coherence during the constant projection into four dimensions; and limiting <b>projection</b> to the <b>portions</b> of an object undergoing topology changes and thereby producing simpler triangulations of undeformed regions.

The methodology behind the classical DEA, the oriented method, is to hold inputs (outputs) constant and to determine how much of an improvement in the output (input) dimensions is necessary in order to become efficient. The authors extend this methodology in two substantive ways. First, a method is developed that determines the shortest projection from an inefficient DMU to the efficient frontier in both the input and output space simultaneously, and second, introduces the notion of the "observable" frontier and its subsequent projection. The observable frontier is the portion of the frontier that has been experienced by other DMUs, and thus the <b>projection</b> onto this <b>portion</b> of the frontier guarantees a recommendation that has already been demonstrated by an existing DMU or a convex combination of existing DMUs.

CRF projections from neurons {{in the central}} nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) to the brainstem are of particular interest for their role in motivated behavior. To directly examine the anatomy and function of CRF neurons, we generated a BAC transgenic Crh-Cre rat in which bacterial Cre recombinase is expressed from the Crh promoter. Using Cre-dependent reporters, we found that Cre expressing neurons in these rats are immunoreactive for CRF and are clustered in the lateral CeA (CeL) and the oval nucleus of the BNST. We detected major projections from CeA CRF neurons to parabrachial nuclei and the locus coeruleus, dorsal and ventral BNST, and more minor <b>projections</b> to lateral <b>portions</b> of the substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area, and lateral hypothalamus. Optogenetic stimulation of CeA CRF neurons evoked GABA-ergic responses in 11 % of non-CRF neurons in the medial CeA (CeM) and 44 % of non-CRF neurons in the CeL. Chemogenetic stimulation of CeA CRF neurons induced Fos in a similar proportion of non-CRF CeM neurons but a smaller proportion of non-CRF CeL neurons. The CRF 1 receptor antagonist R 121919 reduced this Fos induction by two-thirds in these regions.

After the earthquake the collapsed dome was replaced by means of a concrete sphere connected with the survived portions of the old dome’s timber. The old dome shape and the fresco were virtually reconstructed thanks to a set of historical pictures obtained by Italian, USA and German archives; those images have been calibrated and oriented by using modern digital photogrammetric approach and a realistic 3 D model of the old inner surface of the dome has been realised. By using a LiDAR survey the 3 D model of the apse and of the dome, has been set up and the boundaries between original and new structures have been reconstructed by visual evidences.

However, we contend that the dense and homogeneously collected data sets presented in this catalogue {{can also be used}} to assess the location, physical dimensions and orientation of the earthquake source on purely historical grounds. The method we describe is of special value for older earthquakes and for all events that fall in areas where the understanding of faulting and tectonics is limited. At the end of the calculations the seismic source is represented as an oriented "rectangle", the length and width of which are obtained from moment magnitude through empirical relationships. This rectangle is meant to represent the actual surface projection of the seismogenic fault or, at least, the <b>projection</b> of the <b>portion</b> of the Earth crust where a given seismic source is likely to be located. Sources derived through this procedure can then be juxtaposed to sources derived from instrumental and geological data for constructing fault segmentation and earthquake recurrence models and for highlighting linear gaps in the global seismic release.

40|$|Onboard cone beam {{computed}} tomography (CBCT) {{has become a}} widespread means of three-dimensional target localization for radiation therapy; however, it is susceptible to metal artifacts and beam-hardening artifacts that can hinder visualization of low contrast anatomy. Dual-CBCT provides easy access to techniques that may reduces such artifacts. Additionally, dual-CBCT can decrease imaging time and provide simultaneous orthogonal projections which may also be useful for fast target localization. However, dual-CBCT will suffer from large increases in scattered radiation due to {{the addition of the}} second source. An experimental bench top dual CBCT system was constructed so that each imaging chain in the dual CBCT system mimics the geometry of gantry-mounted CBCT systems commonly used in the radiation therapy room. The two systems share a common axis of rotation and are mounted orthogonally. Custom control software was developed to ensure reproducible exposure and rotation timings. This software allows the implementation of the acquisition sequences required for the cross scatter avoidance and correction strategies studied. Utilizing the experimental dual CBCT system cross scatter was characterized from 70 - 145 kVp in projections and reconstructed images using this system and three cylindrical phantoms (15 cm, 20 cm, and 30 cm) with a common Catphan core. A novel strategy for avoiding cross-scatter in dual-CBCT was developed that utilized interleaved data acquisition on each imaging chain. Contrast and contrast-to-noise-ratio were measured in reconstructions {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} this strategy to avoid the effects of cross scatter. A novel correction strategy for cross scatter was developed wherein the cross scatter was regularly sampled during the course of data acquisition and these samples were used as the basis for low- and high- frequency corrections for the cross-scatter in projections. The cross scatter sampling interval was determined for an anthropomorphic phantom at three different sites relevant to radiation therapy by estimating the angular Nyquist frequency. The low frequency portion of the cross scatter distribution is interpolated between samples to provide an estimate of the cross scatter distribution at every projection angle and was then subtracted from the <b>projections.</b> The high-frequency <b>portion</b> of the correction was applied after the low-frequency correction was applied. The novel high-frequency correction utilizes the fact that a direct estimate of the high-frequency components was obtained in the cross scatter samples. The high-frequency components of the measured cross scatter were subtracted from the projections in the Fourier domain, a process referred to as spectral subtraction. Each projection is corrected using the cross scatter sample taken at the closest projection angle. In order to apply this correction in the Fourier domain the high-frequency component of the cross scatter must be approximately stationary. To improve the stationarity of the high-frequency cross scatter component a novel two-dimensional, overlapping window was developed. The spectral subtraction was then applied in each window and the results added to form the final image. The effectiveness of the correction techniques were evaluated by measuring the contrast and contrast-to-noise-ratio in an image quality phantom. Additionally, the effect of the high-frequency correction on resolution was measured using a line pair phantom. Cross scatter in dual CBCT was shown for large phantoms to be much higher than forward scatter which has long been known to be one of the largest degrading factors of image quality in CBCT. This results in large losses of contrast and CNR in reconstructed images. The interleaving strategy for avoiding cross scatter during projection acquisition showed similar performance to cross scatter free acquisitions, however, does not acquire projections at the maximum possible rate. For those applications in which maximizing the acquisition rate of projections is important, the low- and high-frequency corrections effectively mitigated the effects of cross scatter in the dual CBCT system.
