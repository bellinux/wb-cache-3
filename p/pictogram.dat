40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to evaluate awareness and significance of <b>pictograms</b> among pharmacy and non-pharmacy students. The study was conducted in two public and private sector institutes of Karachi during July to Oct 2013. Altogether 306 pharmacy and non pharmacy students participated in the study. A self administered questionnaire was used for this purpose. Nineteen <b>pictograms</b> from the USP-DI and corresponding set of 19 locally developed <b>pictograms</b> conveying the same medication instructions or messages were evaluated. Respondents were evaluated for their interpretation of all 38 <b>pictograms.</b> More than 98 % of the pharmacy students agreed that <b>pictograms</b> attracts attention of people to provide information about medicine use. 97 % considered that <b>pictograms</b> are used as universal language that can be easily understood by everyone and they are effective tools for educating the illiterate patients. 97. 87 % non pharmacy students agreed that patients are unfamiliar with medical terminologies and <b>pictograms</b> may be used to convey the medically significant information to patients. Both pharmacy and non pharmacy students preferred USP-DI <b>pictograms</b> over the <b>pictograms</b> of local origin. It is a need of time to introduce <b>pictograms</b> as a topic in curriculum of Pharm-D courses like Dispensing Pharmacy, Hospital pharmacy and Community pharmacy so that during professional life pharmacist can use these tools to improve patient counselin...|$|R

40|$|Pharmaceutical <b>pictograms</b> {{have the}} {{potential}} {{to play an important role}} in optimizing compliance in the illiterate patient population. <b>Pictograms</b> may improve warning comprehension for those with visual or literacy difficulties and can sometimes be recognized and recalled far better than words. The main purpose of this study is to determine whether these <b>pictograms</b> can be effectively understood by illiterate patients, who otherwise cannot read the instructions given on their prescription order. In this study, 10 pharmaceutical <b>pictograms</b> were evaluated in patients attending the outpatient department of the Shri Mahant Indresh Hospital, a multispecialty, referral hospital in Dehradun (Uttarakhand). Understanding of <b>pictograms</b> by patients before and after interpretation was noted and follow-up interpretation was also noted. Results of the study showed that prior to explanation, the majority of the patients were unable to interpret the <b>pictograms</b> correctly but after explanation of their meaning, interpretation by them showed a marked improvement, indicating the need of using <b>pictograms</b> along with verbal reinforcement. The study also highlighted poor patient follow-up, a major cause of patient non-compliance, often leading to a poor therapeutic outcome of the prescribed medication order. Such problems can be taken care of by an active participation by healthcare professionals...|$|R

40|$|The {{comprehension}} of medicine instructions {{is essential for}} the safe and effective use of medicines. In cases where low literacy constitutes a possible barrier to understanding written medicine information fully, the inclusion of <b>pictograms</b> may facilitate comprehension. Twenty-three internationally available <b>pictograms</b> and 23 corresponding locally developed images were evaluated in 304 low-literate respondents from eight different South African language groups. Demographic data were collected and an English literacy test was administered to those respondents who had stated that they could read English. Interviewees were shown the 46 <b>pictograms</b> in random order and were asked for their interpretation. Preference for either the international or local version was assessed. Correct interpretation of individual <b>pictograms</b> ranged from 14 % to 97 %. Images which had been developed locally were more successful in eliciting correct interpretations than those obtained from an international source (USP <b>pictograms).</b> Only 2 of the 23 USP <b>pictograms</b> achieved the 85 % criterion of the American National Standards Institute compared with 12 of 23 locally developed counterparts. Local <b>pictograms</b> were preferred over the American ones in all cases. Standard of education had a significant influence on interpretation, whereas no significant differences in interpretation could be attributed to cultural diversity between the African language groups. Almost all respondents (98 %) reacted positively to the idea of having <b>pictograms</b> on their medicine labels. The success of the local <b>pictograms</b> highlighted the value of a rigorous and consultative design and test process. Results from one African language group can reliably be extrapolated to other groups in South Africa...|$|R

Methods: The study participants were individuals between 60 and 90 years old, of both sexes, with different levels of education and income. Fifteen of 81 <b>pictograms</b> from the USP-DI were presented to the elderly subjects, individually, without subtitles and in random order, so that the participants’ understanding of the <b>pictograms</b> could be evaluated. Results: The study included 116 participants. Only one of the selected <b>pictograms</b> reached the comprehension criterion established by the International Organization for Standardization 3864. With regard to the relationship between understanding and sociodemographic characteristics, age, wage income, and level of education were all found to be significantly associated with participants’ understanding of some of the <b>pictograms.</b> Conclusion: Most of the USP-DI <b>pictograms</b> evaluated were not well understood by the elderly Brazilians.

40|$|Patients’ {{understanding}} of how to use their therapy is a key determinant of good medication adherence. Low-literate medication users, who have difficulty reading, are at higher risk to misunderstand information about their therapy and to experience negative health outcomes compared to patients with higher reading levels. This thesis describes the development of visual aids, <b>pictograms,</b> to support written drug information for low-literate medication users, with repeated consultative/participative involvement of the target group. The pre-design phase showed that low-literate people experience drug leaflets as discouraging to use and that <b>pictograms</b> can make information look more appealing and easier to find, read and understand. This phase was followed by an iterative design, evaluation and redesign process using mixed-methods. Finally, the <b>pictograms</b> were tested in the context of easy-to-read drug leaflets with antihypertensive medication users. In addition to the resulting grammatical system of pharmaceutical <b>pictograms,</b> the thesis presents recommendations for the design of informative images for low-literate patients as well as an evaluation of end-user involvement in the design of pharmaceutical <b>pictograms.</b> The study shows that it is essential to provide low-literate medication users with suitable, printed drug information and that the use of <b>pictograms</b> can empower this target group...|$|R
