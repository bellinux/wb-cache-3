5|$|Ancient Athens, of the 6th century BC, was {{the busy}} trade centre at the {{confluence}} of Egyptian, Mesopotamian and Minoan cultures {{at the height of}} Greek colonisation of the Mediterranean. The philosophical thought of this period ranged freely through many subjects. Empedocles (490430 BC) foreshadowed Darwinian evolutionary theory in a crude formulation of the mutability of species and natural selection. The physician Hippocrates (460370 BC) avoided the prevailing superstition of his day and approached healing by close observation and the test of experience. At this time a genuine non-anthropocentric curiosity about plants emerged. The major works written about plants extended beyond the description of their medicinal uses to the topics of <b>plant</b> <b>geography,</b> morphology, physiology, nutrition, growth and reproduction.|$|E

25|$|In 1911 Tansley, in {{conjunction}} with the British Vegetation Committee, organised the first International Phytogeographic Excursion (IPE). He was inspired by a <b>plant</b> <b>geography</b> tour of Switzerland organised by Swiss botanist Carl Schröter in 1908, which introduced him not only to vegetation types, but also to botanists from other countries. The connections made between Tansley and American ecologists Henry Chandler Cowles and Frederic Clements helped build a philosophical and methodological link between British and American plant ecology. Other attendees included Schröter, Swedish botanist Carl Lindman, and German botanists Oscar Drude and Paul Graebner. Tansley's book Types of British Vegetation was prepared with an eye to serving as a guide to the vegetation for the attendees of the first IPE. The second IPE in 1913 was hosted by Cowles. This brought Tansley to America.|$|E
500|$|Physiological <b>plant</b> <b>geography,</b> {{perhaps more}} familiarly termed ecology, emerged from floristic {{biogeography}} {{in the late}} 19th century as environmental influences on plants received greater recognition. Early {{work in this area}} was synthesised by Danish professor Eugenius Warming (1841–1924) in his book [...] (Ecology of Plants, generally taken to mark the beginning of modern ecology) including new ideas on plant communities, their adaptations and environmental influences. This was followed by another grand synthesis, the [...] of Andreas Schimper (1856–1901) in 1898 (published in English in 1903 as Plant-geography upon a physiological basis translated by W. R. Fischer, Oxford: Clarendon press, 839 pp.) ...|$|E

In summarizing these discoveries in 1932, Wherry noted {{that many of the}} colonies were already known to local residents, who picked the berries for food, under names such as [...] "juniper-berry", [...] "ground-huckleberry", and [...] "bear-huckleberry".

5000|$|Many of the book's {{chapters}} are {{studies of}} the animals, <b>plants,</b> <b>geography,</b> and climate of the region around Arches National Monument. Cliffrose and Bayonets and Serpents of Paradise and Cliffrose and Bayonets focus on Abbey's descriptions of the fauna and flora of the Arches area, respectively, and his observations of the already deteriorating balance of biodiversity in the desert due to the pressures of human settlement in the region. Abbey provides detailed inventories and observations {{of the life of}} desert plants, and their unique adaptations to their harsh surroundings, including the cliffrose, juniper, pinyon pine, and sand sage. He comments on the decline of the large desert predators, particularly bobcats, coyotes, mountain lions, and wildcats, and criticizes the roles ranchers and the policies of the Department of Agriculture have had in the elimination of these animals, which in turn has fostered unchecked growth in deer and rabbit populations, thereby damaging the delicate balance of the desert ecosystem.|$|R

2500|$|Through {{his travels}} to South America and his {{observational}} records in An Essay on the Geography of Plants {{as well as}} Kosmos, an important trend emerged through his techniques of observation, scientific instruments used and unique perspective on nature. Humboldt's novel style {{has been defined as}} Humboldtian Science. Humboldt had the ability to combine the study of empirical data with a holistic view of nature and its aesthetically pleasing characteristics, which is now held to be the true definition of the study of vegetation and <b>plant</b> <b>geography.</b> Humboldtian science {{is one of the first}} techniques for studying both organic and inorganic branches of science. Examining the interconnectedness of vegetation and its respective environment is one of the new and important aspects of Humboldt's work, an idea labeled as [...] "terrestrial physics," [...] something that scientists who preceded him, such as Linnaeus, failed to do. Humboldtian science is founded on a principle of [...] "general equilibrium of forces." [...] General equilibrium was the idea that there are infinite forces in nature that are in constant conflict, yet all forces balance each other out.|$|E
2500|$|Natural {{history in}} the eighteenth century was the [...] "nomination of the visible". Carl Linnaeus was preoccupied with fitting all nature into taxonomy, fixated on only what was visible. Towards the turn of the nineteenth century, Immanuel Kant became {{interested}} in understanding where species derived from, and was less concerned with an organism's physical attributes. Next, Johann Reinhold Forster, one of Humboldt's future partners, became interested in the study of vegetation as an essential way of understanding nature and its relationship with human society. Proceeding Forster, Karl Willdenow examined floristic <b>plant</b> <b>geography,</b> the distribution of plants and regionality as a whole. All of these pieces in the history before Humboldt help to shape what is defined as Humboldtian science. Humboldt took into account both the outward appearance and inward meaning of plant species. His attention to natural aesthetics and empirical data and evidence is what set his scientific work apart from ecologists before him. Malcolm so aptly puts it as; [...] "Humboldt effortlessly combined a commitment to empiricism and the experimental elucidation of the laws of nature with an equally strong commitment to holism and to a view of nature which was intended to be aesthetically and spiritually satisfactory". It was through this holistic approach to science and the study of nature that Humboldt was able to find a web of interconnectedness despite a multitude of extensive differences between different species of organisms.|$|E
