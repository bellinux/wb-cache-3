40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{analyze the}} {{influence}} of lying in prone <b>position</b> on a specially designed stretcher on the maternal-fetal hemodynamic parameters and comfort of pregnant women. METHODS: A randomized, controlled trial with 33 pregnant women divided into 2 groups: pregnant group sequence 1 and pregnant group sequence 2. The order of <b>positions</b> used in sequence 1 was Fowler’s <b>position,</b> prone <b>position,</b> supine <b>position,</b> left lateral, Fowler’s <b>position</b> 2, supine <b>position</b> 2, prone <b>position</b> 2 and left lateral 2. The order of <b>positions</b> used in sequence 2 was Fowler’s <b>position,</b> prone <b>position,</b> left lateral, supine <b>position,</b> Fowler’s <b>position</b> 2, left lateral 2, prone <b>position</b> 2 and supine <b>position</b> 2. Each woman remained in each <b>position</b> for 6 minutes. For the statistical analyses, we used Wilcoxon’s test for 2 paired samples when comparing the prone <b>position</b> with the other <b>positions.</b> The variables are presented in graphs showing the means and 95 % confidence intervals. Trial Registration: Clinical Trial No. ISRCTN 41359519 RESULTS: All the parameters were within the standards of normality. There were no differences between <b>positions</b> in terms of maternal heart rate, diastolic blood pressure, oxygen saturation and fetal heart rate. However, there were significant decreases in respiratory rate and systolic blood pressure in prone <b>position</b> 2 compared with left lateral 2. There {{was an increase in}} oxygen saturation in prone <b>position</b> compared with Fowler’s <b>position</b> and supine <b>position</b> 2 in both sequences. All the women reported feeling comfortable in the prone <b>position.</b> CONCLUSIONS: The prone <b>position</b> was considered safe and comfortable and could be advantageous for improving oxygen saturation and reducing the systolic blood pressure and respiratory rate...|$|R

Luongo sent tapes of his play to Allaire during his rookie season in the QMJHL and his former goaltending coach advised him {{to be more aggressive}} and come out of the net more to cut off angles and challenge shooters. Later in his NHL career, the Canucks hired a new goaltending coach, Roland Melanson, prior to the 2010–11 season. Working with Melanson, Luongo began playing deeper in his crease against Allaire's original advice, allowing him to maintain <b>positioning</b> for rebounds. The following season, Melanson further tweaked Luongo's style, encouraging him to extend and elevate his glove after his hand's usual low <b>positioning</b> was interpreted to have become a weakness.|$|E

5|$|Many of the {{features}} found in sauropods that basal sauropodomorphs lack {{are related to the}} change in body size. The greatest regions affected by this are the hind limbs and pelvis.

Vulcanodon possessed these features, the latter of which is seen earliest in it.

5|$|One of the {{innovations}} of the Dewey Decimal system {{was that of}} <b>positioning</b> books on the shelves {{in relation to other}} books on similar topics. When the system was first introduced, most libraries in the US used fixed positioning: each book was assigned a permanent shelf position based on the book's height and date of acquisition. Library stacks were generally closed to all but the most privileged patrons, so shelf browsing was not considered of importance. The use of the Dewey Decimal system increased during the early 20th century as librarians were convinced of the advantages of relative <b>positioning</b> and of open shelf access for patrons.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Position-based routing {{protocols}} make routing {{decisions based on}} the geographical <b>position</b> of the destination of a packet. Such protocols scale well since they do not require nodes to maintain explicit routes. Instead each node must know only its own <b>position,</b> the <b>position</b> of its neighbors, and the <b>position</b> of the destination. Thus, {{a critical component of}} position-based {{routing protocols}} is the <b>position</b> service that allows nodes to obtain the <b>position</b> of a destination node. In this paper we analyze the security vulnerabilities of positionbased routing protocols and virtual home region (VHR) -based distributed <b>position</b> service systems. We propose methods to protect the <b>position</b> information from both external and internal attackers. We then discuss and propose several mitigation mechanisms against <b>position</b> abuse by internal attackers that exploit the <b>position</b> service to trace their targets. Finally, we propose a <b>position</b> verification mechanism that allows the <b>position</b> service to verify that the <b>positions</b> reported by nodes are correct. I...|$|R
