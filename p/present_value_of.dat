5|$|By {{the time}} Harding took office, there were calls from foreign governments for {{reduction}} of the massive war debt owed to the United States, and the German government sought to reduce the reparations that it was required to pay. The U.S. refused to consider any multilateral settlement. Harding sought passage of a plan proposed by Mellon to give the administration broad authority to reduce war debts in negotiation, but Congress, in 1922, passed a more restrictive bill. Hughes negotiated an agreement for Britain to pay off its war debt over 62 years at low interest, effectively reducing the <b>present</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> the obligations. This agreement, approved by Congress in 1923, set a pattern for negotiations with other nations. Talks with Germany on reduction of reparations payments {{would result in the}} Dawes Plan of 1924.|$|E
25|$|To {{price the}} CDS we now need to assign probabilities {{to the five}} {{possible}} outcomes, then calculate the <b>present</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> the payoff for each outcome. The <b>present</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> the CDS is then simply the <b>present</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> the five payoffs multiplied by their probability of occurring.|$|E

40|$|An ant colony {{algorithm}} is proposed to improve the net <b>present</b> <b>values</b> <b>of</b> resource-constrained projects since the net <b>present</b> <b>value</b> is a critical criterion for a project with a long time span and considerable cash flows. The algorithm adaptively adjusts the allocation of scarce resources according to the pheromone generated by artificial ants in the previous iterations so as to maximize the project’s net <b>present</b> <b>value.</b> The crossover operation, inverse mutation and elitist strategy are applied to accelerate the searching for better project schedules, and the backward scheduling technique is adopted to improve the net <b>present</b> <b>value</b> further. The experimental test {{results show that the}} proposed algorithm significantly improves the net <b>present</b> <b>values</b> <b>of</b> resource-constrained projects...|$|R
40|$|In a multi-period {{economy with}} stock markets, we exhibit first order {{necessary}} {{conditions for a}} constrained Pareto optimal allocation. This allows us to provide {{an extension of the}} Drèze’s Criterion for a multi-period economy. If the necessary conditions are satisfied, the <b>present</b> <b>values</b> <b>of</b> the firms using Drèze’s prices, are equal to the individual <b>present</b> <b>values</b> <b>of</b> the shareholders. Furthermore, they are equal to the market values if the necessary conditions for individual preference maximization are also satisfied. Thus, under these conditions, the <b>values</b> <b>of</b> firms are well defined and consistent. Since, generically, the necessary conditions do not hold at a stock market equilibrium allocation, the <b>values</b> <b>of</b> firms cannot be correctly deduced from the market values. ...|$|R

25|$|For {{bonds with}} {{multiple}} coupons, {{it is not}} generally possible to solve for yield in terms of price algebraically.

The authors find a negative relationship between initial wage levels and wage growth, even after correcting for negative biases in existing estimates of this relationship.

25|$|From 1982 until 2012, most Western economies {{experienced}} {{a period of}} low inflation combined with relatively high returns on investments across all asset classes including government bonds.

25|$|In DCF valuations, the {{discount}} rate, often {{an estimate of}} the cost of capital for the business, is used to calculate the net <b>present</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> a series of projected cash flows. The discount rate can also be viewed as the required rate of return the investors expect to receive from the business enterprise, given the level of risk they undertake.|$|E
25|$|A {{discount}} rate or capitalization rate {{is used to}} determine the <b>present</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> the expected returns of a business. The {{discount rate}} and capitalization rate are closely related to each other, but distinguishable. Generally speaking, the discount rate or capitalization rate may be defined as the yield necessary to attract investors to a particular investment, given the risks associated with that investment.|$|E

25|$|The {{operation}} of evaluating a present value {{into the future}} value is called capitalization (how much will $100 today be worth in 5 years?).

25|$|In {{this case}} each cash flow grows {{by a factor}} of (1+g). Similar to the formula for an annuity, the <b>present</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> a growing annuity (PVGA) uses the same {{variables}} with the addition of g as the rate of growth of the annuity (A is the annuity payment in the first period).

25|$|These {{equations}} {{are frequently}} combined for particular uses. For example, bonds {{can be readily}} priced using these equations. A typical coupon bond is composed of two types of payments: a stream of coupon payments similar to an annuity, and a lump-sum return of capital {{at the end of}} the bond's maturity—that is, a future payment.
