40|$|The {{techniques}} of physical modeling and visioplasticity {{were used to}} explore the behavior during extrusion of particulate metal-matrix composites. Plasticine billets with nylon inclusions were chosen as modeling materials. Initial full-billet testing was done {{in order to make}} sure that the previously-observed phenomenon of void formation during extrusion of half-billets was not due solely to interaction between the half-billet and the transparent chamber cover or its silicon gel coating. Extensive half-billet testing was then undertaken. A constant reduction ratio of 2 : 1 was used. Friction was kept as constant as possible: the die and chamber were coated with talcum powder, and the chamber cover was coated with silicon gel. The semicone die angle was varied. Six values were used: 15 °, 30 °, 45 °, 60 °, 75 °, and 90 °. Some degree of void-formation around the front and back of the nylon half-sphere was found in almost all samples. However, the size of the voids was significantly smaller in the billets extruded through 15 ° dies than in those extruded through the other dies. It may be that there is a critical angle somewhere below 30 °. Voids visible on the top of the billet were similarly shaped for both front and back positions. They had conical profiles, with the largest cross-sectional area at the sphere, and were slightly overhung with plasticine along their sides. Voids not visible from the top of the billet, but only when the billet was cut open and the half-sphere removed, were smaller than the top-visible voids, but had clear similarities to them. Video-taping of the extrusions, with normal and magnifying lenses, allowed the flow patterns in front and back of the nylon half-sphere to be observed at length. A distinct flow pattern emerged. The pattern and the shape of the voids show strong resemblances to those of the <b>piping</b> <b>defect...</b>|$|E
40|$|International audienceA {{method for}} {{computing}} shape sensitivity {{in the frame}} of non-linear and non-steady-state forging is presented. Derivatives of toot geometry, velocity and state variables with respect to the shape parameters are calculated by a direct differentiation of discrete equations. Because of the important part played by the accuracy of finite element calculations, an efficient transfer method is used between meshes during remeshings and the contact algorithms are carefully differentiated. The resulting inverse design procedure is successfully applied to two industrial examples of forging of automobile parts, with fold-over and <b>piping</b> <b>defects</b> occurring during the intermediate designs. It makes it possible to suggest reasonable preform shapes, with or without any available knowledge of the forging proces...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSafety {{evaluation}} for in-service pressure <b>piping</b> containing <b>defects</b> {{plays an}} important role in ensuring safety production. Based on Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB) Assessment of the Integrity of Structures Containing Defects (R 6) revision 4 failure assessment diagram (FAD), a novel safety assessment method, named Q factor method, is presented for pressure piping containing circumferential surface defects through analysis and simplified in this paper. The Q factor method is simple and efficient, established and given in a more acceptable form in engineering application, and suitable for the safety assessment of defective piping of different materials, without complex fracture or limit load analysis. Besides, the nature of the Q factor approach is consistent with the FAD method, so its validation isn’t mentioned in this paper...|$|R
40|$|Fracture {{mechanics}} {{is mainly}} {{concerned with the}} analysis of fracture-dominant failure. Various methods of analyses for cracks {{are used in the}} determination of fracture characterizing parameters, which in turn can be used to predict loads and crack sizes at which failure would occur. [...] In engineering practice, robust methods for estimating fracture parameters are useful, given the lack of details of material data, geometric configuration and computational sophistication in an operational industrial plant. This thesis focuses on the approximate methods for the determination of (1) crack tip plastic zone size, (2) the J of circular-ended notches and (3) the J for three-dimensional pressure vessels and piping components. Furthermore, this thesis focuses on design perspectives based on robust methods. [...] The assessment of the integrity of structures and components with defects {{has been shown to be}} possible using the robust methods developed in this thesis. The robust method for estimating the elastic-plastic energy release rate has been presented which is suitable for the purpose of design. In order to estimate the effect of out-of-plane loading which is parallel to the crack front, the so-called " 2 ½-D" model is proposed in this thesis. This model has been developed to evaluate J for three-dimensional pressure vessels and <b>piping</b> components with <b>defects</b> such as pressure vessels and piping with a circumferential flaw or a longitudinal flaw...|$|R
40|$|Transmission gas {{pipelines}} {{are an important}} part of energy-transportation infrastructure vital to the national economy. The prevention of failures and continued safe operation of these pipelines are therefore of national interest. These lines, mostly buried, are protected and maintained by protective coating and cathodic protection systems, supplemented by periodic inspection equipped with sensors for inspection. The primary method for inspection is ''smart pigging'' with an internal inspection device that traverses the pipeline. However, some transmission lines are however not suitable for ''pigging'' operation. Because inspection of these ''unpiggable'' lines requires excavation, it is cost-prohibitive, and the development of a methodology for cost-effectively assessing the structural integrity of ''unpiggable'' lines is needed. This report describes the laboratory and field evaluation of a technology called ''magnetostrictive sensor (MsS) '' for monitoring and early detection of internal corrosion in known susceptible sections of transmission pipelines. With the MsS technology, developed by Southwest Research Institute{reg_sign} (SwRI{reg_sign}), a pulse of a relatively low frequency (typically under 100 -kHz) mechanical wave (called guided wave) is launched along the pipeline and signals reflected from defects or welds are detected at the launch location in the pulse-echo mode. This technology can quickly examine a long length of <b>piping</b> for <b>defects,</b> such as corrosion wastage and cracking in circumferential direction, from a single test location, and has been in commercial use for inspection of above-ground piping in refineries and chemical plants. The MsS technology is operated primarily in torsional guided waves using a probe consisting of a thin ferromagnetic strip (typically nickel) bonded to a pipe and a number of coil-turns (typically twenty or so turns) wound over the strip. The MsS probe is relatively inexpensive compared to other guided wave approaches, and can be permanently mounted and buried on a pipe at a modest cost to allow long-term periodic data collection and comparison for accurate tracking of condition changes for cost-effective assessment of the integrity of the susceptible sections of pipeline. The results of work conducted in this project, with the collaboration from Clock Spring{reg_sign} and cooperation with El Paso Corporation, showed that the MsS probe indeed can be permanently installed on a pipe and buried for long-term monitoring of pipe condition changes. It was found however that the application of the MsS to monitoring of bitumen-coated pipelines is presently limited because of very high wave attenuation caused by the bitumen-coating and surrounding soil and resulting loss in defect detection sensitivity and reduction in monitoring range. Based on these results, it is recommended that the MsS monitoring methodology be used in benign, relatively low-attenuation sections of pipelines (for example, sleeved sections of pipeline frequently found at road crossings and pipelines with fusion epoxy coating). For bitumen-coated pipeline applications, the MsS methodology needs to increase its power to overcome the high wave attenuation problem and to achieve reasonable inspection and monitoring capability...|$|R
