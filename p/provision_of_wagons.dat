50|$|Evidently after 1945, an {{approximately}} 600 metres {{of normal}} gauge freight train was dismantled as reparations {{with the end}} of the Second World War. Since freight traffic on the narrow-gauge line fell in the 1960s, a long timber loading ramp, a transhipment platform and an open transhipment hall were shut down and demolished. On the standard-gauge line, general traffic was handled at the Freital-Potschappel station, so the freight yard was used for other purposes. In 1964, the station's name was changed to Freital-Hainsberg. At the end of the 1970s, freight traffic at Freital-Hainsberg station was still so great that a locomotive of class V 60, which had been specifically installed here, was used. In particular, the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>wagon</b> loads for the Freital stainless steelworks and the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>wagon</b> loads for the narrow-gauge line took up the yard’s capacity. The siding to the paper factory, which can be seen on old track plans, no longer exists.|$|R

50|$|The {{station was}} built in 1877 by the West Holstein Railway Company (Westholsteinische Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft) along with its main line from Neumünster. This line {{continued}} to Karolinenkoog as the Heide-Karolinenkoog railway, including a ferry to Tönning opened in 1876. In 1878, the Marsh Railway was extended to the station, giving a direct connections to Hamburg via Itzehoe and Elmshorn. The line was extended to Husum in 1886, using part of the Karolinenkoog branch. In 1883, the West Holstein Railway also completed a branch to Büsum. The premises of the Norderdithmarschen District Railway (Kreisbahn Norderdithmarschen) were in the station forecourt from 1905 to 1938. It operated a metre gauge railway from Heide to places in the Geest country of the northern Dithmarschen district. Its terminus and loading tracks were to the northeast of the state railway station. The relatively large entrance and administration building of the Norderdithmarschen District Railway is now used as a youth centre and a music school, among other things. The Heide workshop, which {{was responsible for the}} <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> locomotives and <b>wagons,</b> was {{at the southern end of}} the station from 1878 to 1978.|$|R
30|$|The study finds that, {{under the}} theme <b>of</b> <b>wagon,</b> the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> an {{electrical}} power supply to each individual rail freight wagon is deemed important. In the train and hubs theme, the research suggests that greater importance is assigned to terminal access and functionality, rather than their overall cargo handling capabilities. In the business quality and planning theme, one issue in particular stood out: the ability to freely integrate freight and passenger services; this is considered a key requirement of the railways of the future.|$|R

These included the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> secretarial services and rooms for railway meetings, and meetings between road and rail companies; classification of goods for the setting of rates; the examination and certification of new packaging materials; the registration of rolling stock; the issue of maps and other publications including scales of charges; and the spot-check <b>of</b> <b>wagons</b> and consignments in transit.|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{attendance}} {{of the demand}} for freight transport {{is related to the}} process of allocation <b>of</b> the <b>wagons</b> that in turn is associated with {{the way in which the}} decision is taken. The distribution <b>of</b> <b>wagons</b> to the shipment terminals depends on the planning as well as on movement <b>of</b> the empty <b>wagons.</b> In addition, the trips <b>of</b> the empty <b>wagons</b> have the major financial impact on the railroad system. In such a way, an efficient mechanism <b>of</b> <b>wagon</b> distribution is vital to the railroads, because it provides important operational profits and of costs. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to analyze the problem related to the distribution <b>of</b> the load <b>wagons</b> and to develop a mathematical model that can propose an optimal scheduling <b>of</b> the <b>wagons...</b>|$|R

40|$|The article {{assesses the}} {{contributions}} of FlexCargoRail for enhancement <b>of</b> single <b>wagon</b> transport, makes calculation for economic efficiency and derives recommendations for further research in single wagon transport. FlexCargoRail can enhance flexibility <b>of</b> single <b>wagon</b> transport due to the possibility for shunting without a shunting engine. Just-in-time delivery to the loading place is possible from a central point of the siding. A target-costing calculation is made to identify maximum of possible investment cost for each FCR wagon. The maximum investment depends on the number <b>of</b> <b>wagon</b> uses per year {{and the rate of}} FCR and conventional (not propelled) Wagons. Critical is to reduce time <b>of</b> circulation <b>of</b> <b>wagons.</b> This leads to conception of direct trains between sidings or regional bundling sites, For this a calculation for minimum number <b>of</b> <b>wagons</b> for cost savings of direct trains in comparison with single wagon transport is made.
