In {{the case of the}} subtribe Chrysomelina (Chrysomelinae), all live stages are protected by the occurrence of isoxazolin-5-one derived glucosides that partially contain esters of 3-nitropropanoic acid (3-NPA, beta-nitropropionic acid). The latter compound is an irreversible inhibitor of succinate dehydrogenase. Hence, 3-NPA inhibits the tricarboxylic acid cycle. This inhibition leads to neurodegeneration with symptoms similar to those caused by Huntington's disease. [...] Since leaf beetles produce high concentrations of 3-NPA esters, a powerful chemical defense against a wide range of different predators is obvious. The larvae of Chrysomelina leaf beetles developed a second defensive strategy that is based on the excretion of droplets via pairs of defensive glands {{at the back of the}} insects. These droplets are immediately presented after mechanical disturbance and contain volatile compounds that derive from sequestered plant metabolites. Due to the specialization of leaf beetles to a certain host plant, the composition of the larval secretion is species-dependent. For instance, the red <b>poplar</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>beetle</b> (Chrysomela populi) consumes the leaves of poplar plants, which contain salicin. This compound is taken up by the insect and then further transformed biochemically into salicylaldehyde, an odor very similar to benzaldehyde. The presence of salicin and salicylaldehyde can repel potential predators of leaf beetles.|$|E

The presence of salicin and salicylaldehyde can repel potential predators of leaf beetles.The hemolymph toxins originate from autogenous de novo biosynthesis by the Chrysomelina beetle. Essential amino acids as valine serve as precursors for the production of the hemolymph toxins of Chrysomelina leaf beetles. The degradation of such essential amino acids provides propanoyl-CoA. This compound is further transformed into propanoic acid and β-alanine. The amino group in β-alanine is then oxidized to yield either an oxime or the nitro-toxin 3-nitropropanoic acid (3-NPA). The oxime is cyclized to isoxazolin-5-one, which is transformed with α-UDP-glucose into the isoxazolin-5-one glucoside. In a final step, an ester is formed by transesterification of 3-nitropropanoyl-CoA to the 6´-position of isoxazolin-5-one glucoside. This biosynthetic route yields high millimolar concentrations of the secondary isoxazolin-5-one and 3-NPA derived metabolites. Free 3-NPA and glucosides that derive from 3-NPA and isoxazolin-5-one also occur in many genera of leguminous plants (Fabaceae).|$|E

40|$|Background: Insects evolved ingenious {{adaptations to}} use {{extraordinary}} food sources. Particularly, the diet of herbivores enriched with noxious plant secondary metabolites requires detoxification mechanisms. Sequestration, which involves the uptake, transfer, and concentration of occasionally modified phytochemicals into specialized tissues or hemolymph, {{is one of}} the most successful detoxification strategies found in most insect orders. Due to the ability of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) carriers to transport a wide range of molecules including phytochemicals and xenobiotics, it is highly likely that they play a role in this sequestration process. To shed light on the role of ABC proteins in sequestration, we describe an inventory of putative ABC transporters in various tissues in the sequestering juvenile <b>poplar</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>beetle,</b> Chrysomela populi. Results: In the transcriptome of C. populi, we predicted 65 ABC transporters. To link the proteins with a possible function, we performed comparative phylogenetic analyses with ABC transporters of other insects and of humans. While tissue-specific profiling of each ABC transporter subfamily suggests that ABCB, C and G influence the plant metabolite absorption in the gut, ABCC with 14 members is the preferred subfamily responsible for the excretion of these metabolites via Malpighian tubules. Moreover, salicin, which is sequestered from poplar plants, is translocated into the defensive glands for further deterrent production.

40|$|Due {{to lack of}} {{detailed}} information on the suitability of short rotation coppice (SRC) species for different climatic regions, over four years this study investigated tree growth and susceptibility to pests and diseases of willow (Salix spp.) and poplar (Populus spp.) clones and other tree species like Alnus spp. and Robinia pseudoacacia at four sites located in southwestern Germany. The study was undertaken in order to deduce the kind of tree species recommended for the various site conditions. In 2009, field trials were established at four sites which differ in climate and soil characteristics (Forchheim, Kupferzell, Marbach and Aulendorf). At all tested locations, a high survival rate (> 90 %) was observed for almost all willow and poplar clones and little infestations with leaf rust (Melampsora) and minor leaf damages caused by the <b>poplar</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>beetle</b> (Chrysomela populi) had occurred. The survival of the other tree species varied from 22 to 97 % depending on the site and species. Across all tree species and locations, results indicated that willow clones can be recommended for cold sites and poplars generally seem to require higher temperatures. The Alnus spp. seems to be favorable for both cold and warm conditions while Robinia pseudoacacia can be recommended for warm sites. Due to its chilling sensitivity, Paulownia tomentosa seems to be rather unsuitable for cultivation in southwestern Germany. For all tested sites, it appears that those with heavy soils and dry conditions are inappropriate for establishing SRC species...|$|E

40|$|Background Chrysomela populi (<b>poplar</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>beetle)</b> is {{a common}} {{herbivore}} in poplar plantations whose infestation causes major economic losses. Because plant volatiles act as infochemicals, we tested whether isoprene, the main volatile organic compound (VOC) produced by poplars (Populus x canescens), affects the performance of C. populi employing isoprene emitting (IE) and transgenic isoprene non-emitting (NE) plants. Our hypothesis was that isoprene is sensed and affects beetle orientation or {{that the lack of}} isoprene affects plant VOC profiles and metabolome with consequences for C. populi feeding. Results Electroantennographic analysis revealed that C. populi can detect higher terpenes, but not isoprene. In accordance to the inability to detect isoprene, C. populi showed no clear preference for IE or NE poplar genotypes in the choice experiments, however, the beetles consumed a little bit less leaf mass and laid fewer eggs on NE poplar trees in field experiments. Slight differences in the profiles of volatile terpenoids between IE and NE genotypes were detected by gas chromatography - mass spectrometry. Non-targeted metabolomics analysis by Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometer revealed genotype-, time- and herbivore feeding-dependent metabolic changes both in the infested and adjacent undamaged leaves under field conditions. Conclusions We show {{for the first time that}} C. populi is unable to sense isoprene. The detected minor differences in insect feeding in choice experiments and field bioassays may be related to the revealed changes in leaf volatile emission and metabolite composition between the IE and NE poplars. Overall our results indicate that lacking isoprene emission is of minor importance for C. populi herbivory under natural conditions, and that the lack of isoprene is not expected to change the economic losses in poplar plantations caused by C. populi infestation...|$|E

It is the first time that long chain fatty alcohols and [alpha]-TQ have been identified as cottonwood <b>leaf</b> <b>beetle</b> adult feeding stimulants. And it is the first time that [alpha]-TQ has been reported as a feeding stimulant for an insect. Fatty alcohols or [alpha]-TQ alone do not induce beetle feeding significantly, but a mixture of alcohols and [alpha]-TQ synergistically stimulates beetle feeding;Field-planted University of Washington poplar pedigree materials (parent clones ILL- 129, Populus deltoides, and 93 - 968, Populus trichocarpa, F, clones, 53 - 242 and 53 - 246, and 87 F 2 selections) were used for leaf disc feeding tests.

The beetles showed varied feeding preferences among parent clones, F 1 clones, and F 2 clones. Contents of the alcohols or the phenolic glucosides did not explain adult beetle feeding preference. Content of [alpha]-TQ on the leaf surface, in the presence of the alcohols, could explain the adult beetle feeding preference. The beetle preferred to feed on clones with [alpha]-TQ rather than on clones without [alpha]-TQ.
