5000|$|... 1 vs. 100 is a {{game show}} created by Endemol that is aired in several countries. The game <b>pits</b> one <b>person</b> against 100 others {{for a chance to}} win a large cash prize. The game first aired in the Netherlands as Eén tegen 100, {{sponsored}} by the Nationale Postcode Loterij (National Postal Code Lottery).|$|R
5000|$|... 1 vs. 100 is an Australian {{spin-off}} {{game show}} {{based on the}} American {{version of the same}} name and the original Dutch version created by Endemol. The game <b>pits</b> one <b>person</b> against 100 others for a chance to win one million dollars. The program is hosted by former Nine Network CEO and personality Eddie McGuire.|$|R
40|$|Nail {{abnormalities}} occur {{frequently in}} patients with psoriatic arthritis. This study of the finger nails of 46 patients with psoriatic arthritis, 100 nonpsoriatic rheumatism patients, and 100 nonpsoriatic general medical patients was designed to characterise these abnormalities with particular reference to the severity of nail pitting. The {{results of the study}} suggest: (1) Onycholysis alone in the absence of previous injury to the affected nail is in favour of a psoriatic origin for the nail dystrophy. (2) Two or all of onycholysis, horizontal ridging, and nail pitting in the same patient are in favour of a psoriatic origin for the nail dystrophy. (3) The presence or absence of nail pitting alone is a poor discriminator between psoriatic and other causes for nail dystrophy. (4) More than 20 finger nails <b>pits</b> per <b>person</b> is suggestive of a psoriatic cause for the dystrophy. (5) More than 60 <b>pits</b> per <b>person</b> is unlikely {{to be found in the}} absence of psoriasis...|$|R
40|$|Ten probands with {{tuberous}} sclerosis (TS) and 20 first degree relatives were examined {{for evidence of}} pitted enamel hypoplasia; 100 % of TS patients had pitting, compared to 65 % of relatives and 72 % of 25 controls. We found that 70 % of TS cases had more than 14 <b>pits</b> per <b>person</b> compared with only 5 % of relatives and 4 % of controls; 85 % of relatives and 84 % of controls had fewer than six <b>pits</b> per <b>person.</b> Our results confirm that significantly increased numbers of dental enamel pits are found in persons with TS compared to controls. These results suggest that examination for {{the presence or absence}} of dental enamel pits is not a useful screening test for first degree relatives to detect otherwise unsuspected subjects with {{tuberous sclerosis}}. However, the lack of pits in first degree relatives in our study is probably largely because none of the relatives appeared to carry the TS gene...|$|R
50|$|The pit that Emma, Snow White/Mary Margaret, and Cora {{were placed}} in resembles the scene from Lost in which the {{survivors}} were also caught and sent down to a <b>pit</b> with another <b>person</b> willing to help, only to later find out the person was a traitor. In this case, the traitor was Cora.|$|R

The script was {{written and directed by}} James Hugh Keenan Campbell and Charles Harries, and starred Montreal actors Emily Skahan, John Pleasants, and Katie Scharf among others. Robin Warner, a Montreal jazz bassist, directed the six <b>person</b> <b>pit</b> band.|$|R
500|$|The {{intervention}} did {{not occur}} immediately, leaving the two sides to cast aspersions at each other. While a majority of church members supported Wheelwright, a large minority were in support of Pike, and when the brethren attempted to subject Pike to discipline for misconduct, he contemptuously refused the judgment, and Wheelwright then excommunicated him from the church. In the spring of 1677 several disaffected {{members of the church}} and town petitioned the court that Wheelwright was the cause of the disturbance, and that his preaching had a tendency to <b>pit</b> one <b>person</b> against another, and requested he be removed from the ministry. Pike's biographer wrote in 1879 that Pike [...] "opposed Wheelwright, and the arbitrary devices of his church polity, to the extent of incurring excommunication". The legislature appointed a committee, earlier proposed by Wheelwright, and through much effort was able to establish a peace. Both parties were assigned fault in the matter, Pike was required to make a concession of his faults, and the church was prompted to return him to communion. From all that is known, the matter was resolved, and did not recur.|$|R
50|$|After {{his success}} in S2000 Simmons {{graduated}} into the USAC Formula Ford 2000 East championship for 1992. In 1992 Simmons won three out of seven races in his Van Diemen RF92. After winning the championship Chris Simmons returned in the series for the 1993 season. He again won the championship after winning nine races. He ran a limited race schedule in 1994 as he started his mechanical engineering study at the University of Pennsylvania. Simmons won one race in the Formula Ford 2000, at New Hampshire International Speedway. Simmons was also involved in a deadly midget crash. During the USAC Hoosier Invitational X at the Hoosier Dome his car crashed into the <b>pit</b> area. One <b>person</b> got killed, eight others were injured. Simmons was uninjured.|$|R
6000|$|On the 14th Zu’l Hijjah {{we started}} to perform the rite of Umrah, or Little Pilgrimage. After {{performing}} ablution, and resuming the Ihram with the usual ceremonies, I set out, accompanied by the boy Mohammed and his brother Abdullah. Mounting asses which resembled mules in size and speed,[FN#20] we rode to the Harim, and prayed there. Again remounting, we issued through the Bab al-Safa towards the open country north-east of the city. The way was crowded with pilgrims, on foot as well as mounted, and their loud Labbayk distinguished those engaged in the Umrah rite from the many whose business was with the camp of the Damascus Caravan. At {{about half a mile}} from the city we passed on the left a huge heap of stones, where my companions stood and cursed. This grim-looking cairn is popularly believed to note the place of the well where Abu Lahab laid an ambuscade for the Prophet. This wicked uncle stationed there a slave, with orders to throw headlong into the <b>pit</b> the first <b>person</b> who ...|$|R
60|$|When the Convention was chosen, the electors of Paris {{rejected}} Condorcet. He was elected, however (Sept. 6), for {{the department}} of the Aisne, having among his colleagues in the deputation Tom Paine, and--a much more important personage--the youthful Saint-Just, who was so soon to stupefy the Convention by exclaiming, with mellow voice and face set immovable as bronze: 'An individual has no right to be either virtuous or celebrated in your eyes. A free people and a national assembly are not made to admire anybody.' The electors of the department of the Aisne had unconsciously sent two typical revolutionists: the man of intellectual ideas, and the man of passion heated as in the <b>pit.</b> In their <b>persons</b> the Encyclopædia and the Guillotine met. Condorcet, who had been extreme in the Legislative, but found himself a moderate in the Convention, gave wise counsel as to the true policy towards the new members: 'Better try to moderate them than quarrel.' But in this case, not even in their ruin, were fire and water reconciled.|$|R
