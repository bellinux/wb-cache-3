50|$|The player's car {{can travel}} at two speeds, a normal speed {{which is the}} same speed as {{computer-controlled}} cars, or if the player <b>presses</b> the <b>controller</b> button, his or her car travels at a fast speed - double its normal speed. The computer-controlled cars have only one speed. Players change lanes by pushing the controller in the appropriate direction when their car is near one of the gaps in the roadway.|$|R
5000|$|Batman Returns (Super NES) - In options, use <b>controller</b> 2 and <b>press</b> [...] Use <b>controller</b> 1 {{to adjust}} the number of lives. When finished, the player can retype the code but instead of the second down press up twice.|$|R
50|$|The game {{begins with}} a cold open; the first level begins {{as soon as the}} game is turned on with a random {{character}} (depending on the direction the player <b>pressed</b> on the <b>controller's</b> D-Pad). After completing the first stage, the title screen and credits roll and the player is given the option to switch characters.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Pressing</b> the <b>controller's</b> [...] "Home" [...] button suspends {{the current}} game or app {{and opens the}} Home Menu: it shows basic {{information}} (such as the current time, controller battery levels, and notifications), and allows access to several [...] "multitasking" [...] functions, including the Nintendo eShop, Miiverse, download manager, a web browser, and the user's friends list. To play Wii games, the user must enter [...] "Wii Mode", a legacy mode that emulates the Wii's system software and Wii Menu interface. Initially, Wii Mode could only be used on the television screen, but the October 2013 firmware update enables Wii Mode to be used off-TV. Either way, Wii controllers must be used.|$|R
5000|$|Detana!! TwinBee (PC Engine) - At {{the title}} screen press [...] to select up to 9 credits in the options menu. Pressing [...] {{on the second}} {{controller}} (a multi-tap is required) will allow the selection of up to ten ships in the options menu. Reversing the code, on the title screen <b>press</b> [...] on <b>controller</b> three to unlock 'Vmode' (Arcade Mode) in the options menu.|$|R
500|$|The player {{character}} is {{situated at the}} bottom of the screen. Leftward and rightward movements of the joystick correspond to leftward and rightward movements of the character. Moving the joystick upward and downward induces the character to fire left and right respectively. <b>Pressing</b> the <b>controller</b> button results in the character firing upward. The player must shoot enemy creatures that come from the top and bottom before they shoot the player character. Enemy creatures fire beams that cause the player to lose a life whenever contact is made with the character. An extra life is awarded every 2,000 points; points are earned by destroying enemies, with 115 or 165 points awarded for killing an Electrosaurus and 200 points for a Marsupod.|$|R
50|$|Without {{a matrix}} circuit, a 61-key {{keyboard}} for a synthesizer, electronic organ, or digital piano would require 62 wires to connect (one for each note, and a ground)—an awkwardly thick bundle of wiring. With a matrix circuit, any of 61 notes {{can be determined}} with only 16 wires. This is drawn schematically as a matrix of 8 columns and 8 rows of wires, with a switch at every intersection. The keyboard controller scans the columns. If a key has been <b>pressed,</b> the <b>controller</b> scans the rows — and in a manner analogous to the board game Battleship!, the controller determines the row-column combination at which a key has been pressed, and generates a note corresponding to that key. This process occurs so quickly that the performer is unaware of any delay.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the still}} images {{composing}} the animation {{of a video}} game. Most gaming systems (and thus, emulators) update the screen approximately 50 (PAL) or 60 (NTSC) times per second (although sometimes only every second or third frame is rendered on some systems, lag notwithstanding). Every update is called a frame. Almost all console systems check the input (which buttons are <b>pressed</b> on the <b>controller)</b> once per frame, which is therefore the highest possible resolution of input in tool-assisted speedrunning.|$|R
50|$|A MIDI {{controller}} is any hardware or {{software that}} generates and transmits Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) data to electronic or digital MIDI-enabled devices, typically to trigger sounds and control parameters of an electronic music performance. The {{most commonly used}} MIDI controller is the electronic musical keyboard MIDI controller, which has keys that can be pressed. When the keys are <b>pressed,</b> the MIDI <b>controller</b> sends MIDI data about the pitch of the note, the velocity and duration, {{which can be used}} to trigger sounds from a MIDI-compatible sound module or synthesizer.|$|R
50|$|He {{started his}} career in 1970 at Thomson <b>Press</b> as Production <b>Controller</b> and {{continues}} to be its guiding force even though he recently handed over the reins to his son Ankoor Purie. With five facilities across India, it has a national presence. He began the India Today Group with an eponymous magazine in 1975. Today the group is India's most diversified media group with 32 magazines, 7 radio stations, 4 TV channels, 1 newspaper, multiple web and mobile portals, a leading classical music label and book publishing arm.|$|R
5000|$|This {{process works}} by {{depositing}} a simple, two-instruction program in memory and executing it. The first instruction commands the disk controller to begin reading the disk {{from the current}} disk address into the current memory address. The second instruction is a JMP instruction that jumps to itself endlessly. When [...] "Clear" [...] is <b>pressed,</b> the disk <b>controller's</b> current disk address is set to sector 0 and its current memory address is set to memory location 0000. When the read is commanded, the program stored in disk sector 0 overlays the bootstrap program and, once the JMP instruction is overlaid, the disk program takes control of the machine.|$|R
500|$|Flower {{is divided}} up into six main levels and one credits level. Each level is {{represented}} by a flower in a pot on a city apartment windowsill, and upon selecting one the player is taken to the [...] "dream" [...] of that flower. Once inside a level, the player controls the wind as it blows a single flower petal through the air. Changes in the pitch and roll of the floating petal are accomplished by tilting the PlayStation 3 <b>controller.</b> <b>Pressing</b> any button blows the wind harder, which in turn moves the petal faster. The camera generally follows just behind the petal, though it sometimes moves to show a new objective or consequence of the player's actions.|$|R
500|$|... 24s minigames {{serve as}} interludes {{from the main}} mission, and are {{primarily}} interrogation sequences or computer puzzles. They are presented both as single puzzles in third-person missions, and as timed stand-alone missions. The computer puzzles include maze puzzles, where a player must select a coloured path from a starting box to an ending box and sometimes a second and third box, are used to represent bypassing locks and other computer functions. Letter sequence puzzles, where a player swaps adjacent pairs {{of a series of}} random letters until they are in the correct sequence, are used to represent code-breaking such as for encrypted files or a locked door. Colour/symbol matching puzzles, where a cursor randomly moves across a field of coloured squares and the player must <b>press</b> the <b>controller</b> button that corresponds to that coloured square, are used to represent unscrambling files from hard drives and other similar functions. A number of other puzzles are used only once, including puzzles to simulate transferring files over a damaged network, infrared scanning of buildings, radar-like scanning of areas, and creating a network link across the entire planet.|$|R
40|$|The case is {{made that}} the path to AGI through {{cognitive}} and developmental robotics is compelling. Beyond the familiar argument that it keeps researchers honest by forcing their systems {{to cope with the}} real world, it encourages them to recapitulate the evolutionary developmental path which gave rise to intelligence in humans. Insights from this perspective are embodied in the Servo Stacks cognitive architecture with several salient features. The brain evolved as a body controller and thus is based largely on computational structures appropriate to physical process control. Evolution typically copies existing structure and modi es it minimally to meet a new demand. We should therefore expect the higher cognitive functions to be performed by body <b>controllers</b> <b>pressed</b> into service as brain controllers...|$|R
500|$|Like the Dual Analog, the DualShock and DualShock 2 feature an [...] "Analog" [...] button {{between the}} analog sticks that toggles the analog sticks {{on and off}} (for use with games which support only the digital input of the {{original}} controller). On the PlayStation 3 Sixaxis and DualShock 3 controllers, the analog sticks are always enabled. Beginning with the Sixaxis, a 'PlayStation button' (which featured the incorporated PS logo and is similar in function to the Xbox 360 [...] "Guide" [...] button) was included on controllers. The PlayStation button replaces the [...] "Analog" [...] button of the DualShock and DualShock 2 <b>controllers.</b> <b>Pressing</b> the PS button on the PS3 brings up the XMB, while holding it down brings up system options (such as quit the game, change controller settings, turn off the system, and turn off the controller).|$|R
5000|$|When {{connected}} to Xbox Live, the player can view their performance {{in relation to}} players in their friends list. This is done by an in-game meter which displays the closest friend to the player's time which adjusts based on whether the player is leading or trailing the friend's course time. Trials HD includes a level editor that allows players to construct their own courses and share them with players in their friends list. Every course in the game was created using the level editor, which allows users to create professional-quality levels. It also features leaderboards {{for each of the}} game's courses and modes. [...] For each course the fastest five thousand times are able to be viewed as replays. During the replay the viewer can view that recorded player's <b>controller</b> <b>presses,</b> allowing them to learn patterns and skills from it.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe annual {{number of}} daily flights in France has {{increased}} from about 3500 in 1982 to about in 8000 in 2000. The number of flights simultaneously present {{on the radar screen}} of the controller has also increased. Usually controllers manage about 15 aircraft on their position and sometime this number reach a maximum of 20. On the radar screen, aircraft are represented by spots (with some previous positions and their speed vector) and the associated label which give the flight ID, the speed and the altitude of the aircraft. The controller in charge of the controlled area, {{has to be able to}} select any aircraft in order to manipulate some parameters of the flight such as heading, speed, altitude etc. Aircraft selection is done by the mean of a virtual keyboard where the <b>controller</b> <b>pressed</b> the keys of the flight ID. This ID is composed by a sequence of three letters (maximum) which represents the airline code, followed by the flight number. When such a selection is done, the associated flight is made highlighting on the radar screen. Depending of the flight ID distribution on a control position, the virtual keyboard can be optimized in order to speed up the aircraft selections and to improve the work of the controllers mainly when the sectors are overloaded. This keyboard optimization problem may be addressed like a pure assignment problem which is NP_Hard. This paper shows how artificial evolution has been used for solving such a problem with very good results on real instance associated to the Roissy departure sector...|$|R
40|$|With the {{competition}} in the games market focus is placed on entertaining the user {{for the sale of}} their products. This brings entertainment to the safe environment of the home. To play these games the user needs to use a keyboard and mouse. For somebody without finger dexterity and limited arm movement, pressing keys on the keyboard is impossible without pressing other keys at the same time. The mouse is also impossible to use. This project involves the design of a wireless controller made for an individual who has no finger dexterity, limited arm movement and has access to an optical head tracker to move the mouse cursor. The inputs are done by buttons and joysticks. The project requires careful design and testing to ensure the inputs can be operated by this individual. The average time spent comfortably playing on the game controller was four hours. The delay coming from the controller was not noticeable for all the button presses. The processing time to do a key <b>press</b> by the <b>controller</b> was tested to be less than thirty two milliseconds. The battery that is in the controller will last for 16 hours of gameplay. The controller is mostly operated by the user so that less work is done by the carers. The only other method of playing games before the controller was to have a pointer glued into his splint. This could then be used to operate the mobile phone by using the pointer on the touch screen. The user found that computer gaming is more entertaining than playing games on a mobile phone...|$|R
