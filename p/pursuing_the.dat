5|$|On 13 February, having fought three {{successful}} {{actions in}} three days against the Prussian and Russian army at Champaubert, Montmirail and Château-Thierry, Napoleon was <b>pursuing</b> <b>the</b> defeated enemy. After his consecutive defeats, Field-marshal Blücher decided to disengage from Napoleon and move a significant force against the isolated French Army Corps of Marshal Marmont, at Étoges. Blücher knew that Marmont's Corps was weak and his plan was to destroy it and thus fall upon the rear of Napoleon's main force.|$|E

5|$|On {{appeal to}} the Court of Appeal, three issues were raised. The first issue was whether the plaintiffs (appellants) had the {{requisite}} locus standi. The second was whether {{there had been an}} inordinate delay on the appellants' part in <b>pursuing</b> <b>the</b> matter in court. The third issue is the most significant, namely, whether the acquisition of the temple property violated Article 12(1) of the Constitution.|$|E

5|$|The poem {{discusses}} {{time and}} disorder within nature {{that is the}} result of humanity following only science and not the divine.

5|$|After Scott B. Smith had {{published}} {{a short story}} for The New Yorker, the magazine's fiction editor learned of his then-unpublished novel A Simple Plan before reading it and forwarding it to an agent. Shortly thereafter, Smith learned that Mike Nichols was interested in purchasing the film rights to his novel. Nichols spent a weekend reading the book, before contacting Smith's agent, and finalizing a deal the following Monday morning. Nichols purchased the rights for his production company Icarus Productions for $250,000, with an additional $750,000 to come later from a studio interested in <b>pursuing</b> <b>the</b> project. Smith’s manuscript of A Simple Plan was optioned for development at an independent film studio, Savoy Pictures. However, due to scheduling conflicts with a planned film adaptation of All the Pretty Horses, Nichols {{stepped down from the}} project.|$|E
5|$|After a brief {{engagement}} between Thebes and Phocis, {{in which}} Thebes was victorious, the allies gathered a large army at Corinth. A sizable force was sent out from Sparta to challenge this force. The forces {{met at the}} dry bed of the Nemea River, in Corinthian territory, where the Spartans won a decisive victory. As often happened in hoplite battles, the right flank of each army was victorious, with the Spartans defeating the Athenians while the Thebans, Argives, and Corinthians defeated the various Peloponnesians opposite them; the Spartans then attacked and killed a number of Argives, Corinthians, and Thebans as these troops returned from <b>pursuing</b> <b>the</b> defeated Peloponnesians. The coalition army lost 2,800 men, while the Spartans and their allies lost only 1,100.|$|E
5|$|At the University of Birmingham in Britain, the Australian {{physicist}} Mark Oliphant assigned two refugee physicists—Otto Frisch and Rudolf Peierls—the task {{of investigating}} {{the feasibility of}} an atomic bomb, ironically because their status as enemy aliens precluded their working on secret projects like radar. Their March 1940 Frisch–Peierls memorandum indicated that the critical mass of uranium-235 was within {{an order of magnitude}} of 10kg, which was small enough to be carried by a bomber of the day. The British Maud Committee then unanimously recommended <b>pursuing</b> <b>the</b> development of an atomic bomb. Britain had offered to give the United States access to its scientific research, so the Tizard Mission's John Cockcroft briefed American scientists on British developments. He discovered that the American project was smaller than the British, and not as far advanced.|$|E

5|$|Barret {{is first}} {{introduced}} in Final Fantasy VII as an eco-terrorist, leading the group AVALANCHE to bomb Mako reactors in the fictional city of Midgar, {{so as to}} avenge the losses dealt him by the megacorporation Shinra, the Planet's de facto world government, who operate under the pretense of saving the Planet. As the story progresses, Barret re-examines his efforts and focuses on <b>pursuing</b> <b>the</b> villain Sephiroth {{in an effort to}} protect the Planet and the future of his adopted daughter, Marlene. Elements of the Compilation of Final Fantasy VII would later expand upon his character, detailing the character's history before and after the events of the original game.|$|E
5|$|By 19:30, the High Seas Fleet, {{which was}} {{by that point}} <b>pursuing</b> <b>the</b> British battlecruisers, had not yet {{encountered}} the Grand Fleet. Scheer had been considering retiring his forces before darkness exposed his ships to torpedo boat attack. He had not yet made a decision when his leading battleships encountered {{the main body of}} the Grand Fleet. This development made it impossible for Scheer to retreat, for doing so would have sacrificed the slower pre-dreadnought battleships of the II Battle Squadron, while using his dreadnoughts and battlecruisers to cover their retreat would have subjected his strongest ships to overwhelming British fire. Instead, Scheer ordered his ships to turn 16 points to starboard, which would bring the pre-dreadnoughts to the relative safety of the disengaged side of the German battle line.|$|E
5|$|By late 1958, Davis {{employed}} one of {{the most}} acclaimed and profitable working bands <b>pursuing</b> <b>the</b> hard bop style. His personnel had become stable: alto saxophonist Cannonball Adderley, tenor saxophonist John Coltrane, pianist Bill Evans, long-serving bassist Paul Chambers, and drummer Jimmy Cobb. His band played a mixture of pop standards and bebop originals by Charlie Parker, Thelonious Monk, Dizzy Gillespie, and Tadd Dameron. As with all bebop-based jazz, Davis's groups improvised on the chord changes of a given song. Davis was one of many jazz musicians growing dissatisfied with bebop, and saw its increasingly complex chord changes as hindering creativity.|$|E
