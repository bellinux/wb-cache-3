The frequency-sensitive optical {{response}} due to two-photon {{resonance of}} electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) in a tunable band structure of an EIT-based layered medium is considered. The unit cells of this periodic layered structure {{are composed of}} dielectric (e. g., GaAs) and EIT atomic vapor. The frequency-sensitive behavior of controllable reflectance and transmittance depending on the external control field can be applicable to new device design (e. g., it can serve as the fundamental working mechanism for photonic switches and <b>photonic</b> <b>logic</b> <b>gates).</b> Some two-input <b>logic</b> <b>gates</b> (e. g., OR and NAND gates) are designed based on the present effect of sensitive switching control that results from the two-photon resonance...|$|R
40|$|Kerr {{nonlinear}} cavities displaying optical thresholding {{have been}} proposed for the realization of ultra-low power <b>photonic</b> <b>logic</b> <b>gates.</b> In the ultra-low photon number regime, corresponding to energy levels in the attojoule scale, quantum input-output models become important to study the effect of unavoidable quantum fluctuations {{on the performance of}} such <b>logic</b> <b>gates.</b> However, being a quantum anharmonic oscillator, a Kerr-cavity has an infinite dimensional Hilbert space spanned by the Fock states of the oscillator. This poses a challenge to simulate and analyze <b>photonic</b> <b>logic</b> <b>gates</b> and circuits composed of multiple Kerr nonlinearities. For simulation, the Hilbert of the oscillator is typically truncated to the span of only a finite number of Fock states. This paper develops a quasi-principal components approach to identify important subspaces of a Kerr-cavity Hilbert space and exploits it to construct an approximate reduced model of the Kerr-cavity on a smaller Hilbert space. Using this approach, we find a reduced dimension model with a Hilbert space dimension of 15 that can closely match the magnitudes of the mean transmitted and reflected output fields of a conventional truncated Fock state model of dimension 75, when driven by an input coherent field that switches between two levels. For the same input, the reduced model also closely matches the magnitudes of the mean output fields of Kerr-cavity-based AND and NOT gates and a NAND latch obtained from simulation of the full 75 dimension model.

40|$|Structural DNA {{nanotechnology}} {{has developed}} profoundly {{in the last}} several years allowing for the creation of increasingly sophisticated devices capable of discrete sensing, locomotion, and molecular logic. The latter research field is particularly attractive as it provides information processing capabilities that may eventually be applied in situ, for example in cells, with potential for even further coupling to an active response such as drug delivery. Rather than design a new DNA assembly for each intended logic application, it would be useful to have one generalized design that could provide multiple different <b>logic</b> <b>gates</b> or states for a targeted use. In pursuit of this goal, we demonstrate a switchable, triangular dye-labeled three-arm DNA scaffold where the individual arms can be assembled in different combinations and the linkage between each arm can be physically removed using toehold-mediated strand displacement and then replaced by a rapid anneal. Rearranging this core structure alters the rates of FÃ¶rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between each of the two or three pendant dyes giving rise to a rich library of unique spectral signatures that ultimately form the basis for molecular <b>photonic</b> <b>logic</b> <b>gates.</b> The DNA scaffold is designed such that different linker lengths joining each arm, and which are used as the inputs here, can also be used independently of one another thus enhancing the range of molecular gates. The functionality of this platform structure is highlighted by easily configuring it into a series of one-, two- and three-input <b>photonic</b> Boolean <b>logic</b> <b>gates</b> such as OR, AND, INHIBIT, etc., along with a photonic keypad lock. Different gates can be realized in the same structure by altering which dyes are interrogated and implementation of toehold-mediated strand displacement and/or annealing allows reconfigurable switching between input states within a single <b>logic</b> <b>gate</b> as well as between two different gating devices...|$|R

40|$|An {{optical device}} {{configuration}} allowing efficient electrical tuning of surface plasmon wavelength and absorption in a suspended/conformal graphene film is reported. An underlying 2 -dimensional array of inverted rectangular pyramids greatly enhances optical coupling to the graphene film. In contrast to devices utilising 1 D grating or Kretchman prism coupling configurations, both s and p polarization can excite plasmons due to symmetry of the grating structure. Additionally, the excited high frequency plasmon mode has a wavelength independent of incident photon angle allowing multidirectional coupling. By combining analytical methods with Rigorous Coupled-Wave Analysis, absorption of plasmons is mapped over near infrared spectral range {{as a function}} of chemical potential. Strong control over both plasmon wavelength and strength is provided by an ionic gel gate configuration. 0. 04 eV change in chemical potential increases plasmon energy by 0. 05 ?eV shifting plasmon wavelength towards the visible, and providing enhancement in plasmon absorption. Most importantly, plasmon excitation can be dynamically switched off by lowering the chemical potential and moving from the intra-band to the inter-band transition region. Ability to electrically tune plasmon properties can be utilized in applications such as on-chip light modulation, <b>photonic</b> <b>logic</b> <b>gates,</b> optical interconnect and sensing applications...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} we have {{demonstrated}} the cascading of two <b>photonic</b> AND <b>logic</b> <b>gates</b> by using two symmetric semiconductor GaAs microring resonators. In addition, we have developed a new, low-cost method for fabricating glass microring resonators. In {{the first part of}} this work, we discuss the properties of microring resonators and describe the fabrication of semiconductor microring resonators by the research team of which I was a member. In the experiments on cascaded <b>logic</b> <b>gates</b> we launched one probe and pump beam into different input waveguides, respectively. The first ring works as a AND <b>logic</b> <b>gate</b> for probe and pump beams. The output beam from the first ring goes to the second ring. The second ring also work as a AND <b>logic</b> <b>gate</b> using the second pump to switch the beam coming from the first ring. We successfully demonstrated cascading two <b>photonic</b> <b>logic</b> <b>gates</b> by using two symmetric semiconductor GaAs microrings. In the second part of this work, we extended our prior work on the fabrication of semiconductor microrings in a clean room to a purely mechanical method of glass microring fabrication. Many laboratories, including ours, lack the expensive facilities needed for the lithographic fabrication of microrings. And, a low-cost, high yield method of fabrication may have significant application in the development of disposable microring sensors. We have built up a complete mass=production capability based on glass capillary pulling and micro-polishing to fabricate glass microrings, because there were no available off-the-shelf systems available from industry at affordable prices. This method of producing highly polished glass micro-resonators has many advantages, such as fast fabrication (≦ 6 weeks), high yield (≧ 50 %) (percentage of devices w/o cracks on edge), low cost (no need to use costly facilities in a clean room), mass production (800 ~ 1200 devices per batch). The surface quality of glass resonators should be excellent because capillaries were made at high temperature ≧ 1000 ℃ and devices were polished by suspension slurry of 70 nm colloidal silica. Further measurements that are beyond our current capability are needed for final verification. If some fabrication steps could be optimized in the future, we estimate that the fabrication time could be within 2 weeks, the yield rate would be higher than 90 %, and the number of devices per batch could be more than 1, 200. This innovative method opens a new path for microresonator fabrication at low cost and in fast mass production. In sensor applications where low cost and mass production could be important, our work is an important first step to making microring sensors inexpensive, if further work in characterizing them can be done. Glass microresonators can play a key role, for example, in gas sensors, chemical sensors, liquid sensors, biological sensors, and vibration sensors. Two appendices in this thesis list the most significant sub-systems of the whole system we designed and built for producing glass microring resonators.

40|$|Integrated quantum {{photonics}} {{provides a}} promising route towards scalable solid-state implementations of quantum networks, quantum computers, and ultra-low power opto-electronic devices. A key component {{for many of}} these applications is the <b>photonic</b> quantum <b>logic</b> <b>gate,</b> where the quantum state of a solid-state quantum bit (qubit) conditionally controls the state of a photonic qubit.

The qubit is composed of a quantum dot (QD) strongly coupled to a nano-cavity, which acts as a coherently controllable qubit system that conditionally flips the polarization of a photon on picosecond timescales, implementing a controlled-NOT (cNOT) gate.

40|$|In {{the last}} few years, {{there has been a}} great {{interest}} in all-optical switching devices due to the high demand on optical communication systems and networks. Unlike conventional electronic switches, photonic switching devices are ideal candidates for ultrafast data stream processing, approaching the THz regime. It is the goal of this thesis to propose, study, and demonstrate a new class of compact optical switches based on semiconductor microring resonators. A detailed theoretical analysis of the nonlinear behavior of the microring resonator shows that, due to the resonance effect, there is an enhancement of the overall switching efficiency by up to the third power of the cavity finesse. Two different semiconductor materials are used in fabricating these devices, GaAs and InP. Both materials are analyzed and compared in terms of switching energy requirement, nonlinear coefficients, speed limitation and ease of fabrication. In addition, two different fabrications techniques are used to realize the ring structure layout, laterally and vertically coupled. The round trip phase of the microring resonator can be controlled by changing its refractive index. This can be accomplished by free carrier injection induced by two-photon absorption or single-photon absorption. As a result, a temporal blue shift in the resonator resonance wavelength is observed. When these carriers diffuse to the waveguide walls, the effect diminishes. A probe beam, tuned to one of the resonator resonant wavelengths, is used to capture the dynamic change in the transmission function of the resonator. All-optical switching is demonstrated using a single microring resonator, with few tens of picojoules switching energy and a switching window approaching 30 GHz, limited by the carrier lifetime of the guiding material. Moreover, such a device is used in time division demultiplexing a stream of data channels as well as spatial pulse routing with approximately 8 ~dB cross-talk noise, limited by fabrication tolerances. More complicated structures of these resonators are proposed and used to achieve a set of functionally complete <b>photonic</b> <b>logic</b> <b>gates...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{author of}} this thesis {{concentrates}} his attention on quantum optical properties of some artificial electromagnetic media, such as quantum coherent atomic vapors (various multilevel electromagnetically induced transparency vapors) and negative refractive index materials, and suggests some possible ways to manipulate wave propagations inside the artificial electromagnetic materials based on quantum coherence and quantum vacuum effects. In Chapters 1 and 2, the author reviews the previous papers on quantum coherence {{as well as the}} relevant work such as electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT), atomic population trapping and their various applications. The basic concepts of quantum coherence (atomic phase coherence, quantum interferences within atomic energy levels) and quantum vacuum are introduced, and the theoretical formulations for treating wave propagations in quantum coherent media are presented. In Chapter 3, the author considers three topics on the manipulation of light propagations via quantum coherence and quantum interferences: i) the evolutional optical behaviors (turn-on dynamics) of a four-level N-configuration atomic system is studied and the tunable optical behavior that depends on the intensity ratio of the signal field to the control field is considered. Some typical <b>photonic</b> <b>logic</b> <b>gates</b> (e. g. NOT and NOR gates) are designed based on the tunable four-level optical responses of the N-configuration atomic system; ii) the destructive and constructive quantum interferences between two control transitions (driven by the control fields) in a tripod-type four-level system is suggested. The double-control quantum interferences can be utilized to realize some photonic devices such as the logic-gate devices, e. g., NOT, OR, NOR and EXNOR gates; iii) some new quantum coherent schemes (using EIT and dressed-state mixed-parity transitions) for realizing negative refractive indices are proposed. The most remarkable characteristic (and advantage) of the present scenarios is such that the isotropic left-handed media (with microscopic structure units at the atomic level) in the optical frequency band can be achieved. Quantum vacuum (the ground state of quantized fields) can exhibit many interesting effects. In Chapter 4, we investigate two quantum-vacuum effects in artificial materials: i) the anisotropic distribution of quantum-vacuum momentum density in a moving electromagnetic medium; ii) the angular momentum transfer between quantum vacuum and anisotropic medium. Such quantum-vacuum macroscopic mechanical effects could be detected by current technology, e. g., the so-called fiber optical sensor that can measure motion with nanoscale sensitivity. We expect that these vacuum effects could be utilized to develop sensitive sensor techniques or to design new quantum optical and photonic devices. In Chapter 5, the author suggests some interesting effects due to the combination of quantum coherence and quantum vacuum, i. e., the quantum coherent effects, in which the quantum-vacuum fluctuation field is involved. Two topics are addressed: i) spontaneous emission inhibition due to quantum interference in a three-level system; ii) quantum light-induced guiding potentials for coherent manipulation of atomic matter waves (containing multilevel atoms). These quantum guiding potentials could be utilized to cool and trap atoms, and may be used for the development of new techniques of atom fibers and atom chips, where the coherent manipulation of atomic matter waves is needed. In Chapter 6, we conclude this thesis with some remarks, briefly discuss new work that deserves further consideration in the future, and present a guide to the previously published papers by us.
