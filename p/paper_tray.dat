40|$|Scientists at the UC Kearney Research and Extension Center have {{developed}} a new method to produce dried-on-vine (DOV) raisins. Prior DOV systems required costly trellising and harvesting equipment, putting DOV {{out of reach for}} most growers. Our new, within-row-alternate-bearing DOV (WRAB DOV) method can be used with the existing trellis and no retrofitting. DOV raisins are machine harvested, reducing human contact and production costs, and improving profitability. Drying raisins on the vine eliminates the need for intensive cultivation to prepare terraces down row middles.

The grapes are picked at harvest time, usually late August to early September, and dried naturally in the sun, either by hand-picking them and laying them on <b>paper</b> <b>trays</b> or allowing them to dry-on-the-vine (DOV) for mechanical harvesting.

40|$|Noise {{is one of}} the {{problems}} that often occur in urban areas due to the traffic condition. Noise in a building design depends on the choice of materials as sound absorbers. The type of sound dampening material that already exists is a porous material, a resonator, and a panel. The material often used as an absorber is porous materials, because it is relatively cheaper and lighter, especially to reduce the noise in the narrow spaces such as housing and offices. Various substitutes are made from cheap materials, such as the use of recycled materials of egg <b>tray</b> <b>paper</b> with the size of 40 x 40 centimeters. This is a quantitative research that will measure the place of egg <b>tray</b> <b>paper</b> in reducing noise, using a Sound Level Meter.
