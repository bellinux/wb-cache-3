40|$|This article summarises, extends and updates {{previous}} empirical {{work on the}} distributional {{implications of}} alternative health care financing arrangements in a selection of European countries and the US. On the one hand, total health care payments are almost proportional to ability to pay in most countries. This is predominantly driven by a high reliance on public financing. On the other hand, <b>private</b> <b>payments</b> - out-of-pocket payments as well as private insurance premiums - are highly regressive. More extended reliance on private financing may therefore endanger the equitable nature of financing systems. In addition, <b>private</b> <b>payments</b> put a heavy burden on unfortunate households.

A government-sponsored study found that Medicare payments for anesthesia services are lower than <b>private</b> <b>payments.</b> Congress is concerned that this difference may create regional discrepancies in the supply of anesthesia practitioners, and asked GAO to explore this issue. GAO examined (1) {{the extent to which}} Medicare payments for anesthesia services were lower than <b>private</b> <b>payments</b> across Medicare payment localities in 2004, (2) whether the supply of anesthesia practitioners across Medicare payment localities in 2004 was related to the differences between Medicare and <b>private</b> <b>payments</b> for anesthesia services or the concentration of Medicare beneficiaries, and (3) compensation levels for anesthesia practitioners in 2005 and trends in graduate training. GAO used claims data from two anesthesia service billing companies that bill private insurance payers and Medicare to calculate payments by payer for seven anesthesia services in 41 Medicare payment localities. GAO also used data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and other sources to determine practitioner supply and Medicare beneficiary concentration in 87 Medicare payment localities. ...|$|R

The new government continued to follow the policies of its predecessor on this issue. The goal was to convince the Allies to accept an extended <b>payment</b> <b>moratorium</b> {{for three to four}} years that would allow the Germans to stabilize their economy and currency first before resuming transfers. However, the French had budget problems of their own and refused to compromise on this, holding the German side to earlier agreements. The French government of prime minister/foreign minister Raymond Poincaré was convinced that Germany (and its industry) was unwilling rather than unable to make the reparations. A debt moratorium was considered possible only if France would be able to obtain [...] "productive collateral" [...] (such as direct Allied control over the coal mines of the Ruhr). On 26 December 1923, the reparations commission formally found that Germany had culpably failed to comply with its obligations concerning the delivery of wood, against the vote of the British commissioner. Similarly, it found on 9 January 1923 that the 1922 deliveries of coal to France had been deficient. Two days later French and Belgian troops occupied the Ruhr.|$|R

We investigate the effects of such insurance on the utilization of physician services {{using data from the}} 1998 Enqu�te sur la santé et la protection sociale, a nationally representative survey of the non-institutionalized French population. Our results indicate that insurance has a strong and significant effect on the utilization of physician services. Individuals with supplemental coverage have substantially more physician visits than those without. While French patients have greater freedom than patients in other countries to choose to see a specialist rather than a general practitioner, we find no evidence that supplemental insurance affects this decision.
