40|$|This masters thesis uses {{urban design}} and {{landscape}} architecture {{to investigate the}} role of open spaces in increasing the adaptive capacity of New Zealand's sand spit communities {{in the face of}} <b>climate</b> related <b>change.</b> In order to respond to <b>potential</b> <b>climate</b> related <b>change,</b> the design of open spaces should acknowledge the crucial role that natural processes and ecosystems play in protecting coastal environments. Urban design and landscape architecture have the potential to encourage interaction at the interface of the social and ecological systems within these coastal communities. The design of public open space can encourage more sensitive development patterns and increase the communities' awareness of coastal processes. These spaces can become the focus of social capital building while ensuring the environment has the capacity to absorb <b>potential</b> <b>climate</b> related <b>changes.</b> This research focuses on three sand spit resort communities on the east coast of New Zealand's North Island. Through a series of design studies, a range of strategies are proposed and tested in response to the <b>potential</b> impacts of <b>climate</b> <b>change</b> and sea level rise. The exclusive and expensive coastal development trend is augmented to provide for all potential beach users. Diversification in both the users, and types of use, in these coastal areas will increase the social capital investment and awareness, further building the adaptive capacity of the spit system...|$|R

50|$|As an {{ecosystem}} level model FORECAST offers the user {{the ability to}} represent {{a high degree of}} complexity in vegetation (multiple species and different life forms), plant community structure (canopy layering as a simple even-age single canopy layer or a complex multi-age, multi canopy) and population, community and ecosystem processes. However, the model can be simplified to any desired level of complexity that matches the user’s interests, specific application and data availability. In its simplest form it can be run as a single age cohort, plant monoculture, light competition model. At the other extreme the model can be used to simulate succession and disturbance responses in a complex multi species, multi age cohort ecosystem-level application with population, community and ecosystem processes represented with light, nutrient and moisture effects and their interactions, and the possibility to examine <b>potential</b> <b>climate</b> <b>change</b> effects.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the most}} useful {{features}} of IWFM is the internal calculation of water demands for each land use type. IWFM simulates four land use classes: agricultural, urban, native vegetation, and riparian vegetation. Land use areas are delineated as a time series, with corresponding evapotranspiration rates and water management parameters. Each time step, the land use process applies precipitation, calculates infiltration and runoff, calculates water demands, and determines what portion of the demands are not met by soil moisture. For agricultural and urban land use classes, IWFM then applies surface water and groundwater at specified rates, and optionally adjusts surface water and groundwater to exactly meet water demands. This automatic adjustment feature is especially useful for calculating unmeasured flow components (such as groundwater withdrawals) or for simulating proposed future scenarios such as studying the impacts of <b>potential</b> <b>climate</b> <b>change.</b>|$|E
50|$|India has {{a growing}} {{population}}, and large impoverished rural population {{that relies on}} monsoon-irrigated agriculture. Weather uncertainties, and <b>potential</b> <b>climate</b> <b>change</b> induced weather volatilities, raise concerns of social stability and impact of floods and droughts on rural poverty. The population of India {{is expected to grow}} further at a decelerating pace and stabilize around 1.5 billion by 2050, or another 300 million people - the size of United States - compared to the 2011 census. This will increase demand for reliable sources of food and improved agriculture yields - both of which, claims India's National Council of Applied Economic Research, require significantly improve irrigation network than the current state. The average rainfall in India is about 4,000 billion cubic metre, of which annual surface water flow in India is estimated at 1,869 billion cubic metre. Of this, for topological and other reasons, only about 690 billion cubic metre of the available surface water can be utilised for irrigation, industrial, drinking and ground water replenishment purposes. In other words, about 1,100 billion cubic metre of water is available, on average, every year for irrigation in India. This amount of water is adequate for irrigating 140 million hectares. As of 2007, about 60% of this potential was realized through irrigation network or natural flow of Indian rivers, lakes and adoption of pumps to pull ground water for irrigation.|$|E
