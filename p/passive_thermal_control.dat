40|$|International audienceThe {{core of the}} High Frequency Instrument (HFI) {{on-board}} the Planck satellite {{consists of}} 52 bolometric detectors cooled at 0. 1 Kelvin. In order to achieve such a low temperature, the HFI cryogenic architecture consists in several stages cooled using different active coolers.

40|$|AbstractStudy ObjectiveIncidence of {{inadvertent}} perioperative hypothermia {{is still}} high; therefore, present guidelines advocate “prewarming” for its prevention. Prewarming means preoperative patient skin warming, which minimizes redistribution hypothermia caused by induction of anesthesia. In this study, {{we compared the}} new self-warming BARRIER EasyWarm blanket with <b>passive</b> <b>thermal</b> insulation regarding mean perioperative patient core body temperature. DesignMultinational, multicenter randomized prospective open-label controlled trial. SettingSurgical ward, operation room, postanesthesia care unit at 4 European hospitals. PatientsA total of 246 adult patients, American Society of Anesthesiologists class I to III undergoing elective orthopedic; gynecologic; or ear, nose, and throat surgery scheduled for 30 to 120 minutes under general anesthesia. InterventionsPatients received warmed hospital cotton blankets (<b>passive</b> <b>thermal</b> insulation, <b>control</b> group) or BARRIER EasyWarm blanket at least 30 minutes before induction of general anesthesia and throughout the perioperative period (intervention group). MeasurementsThe primary efficacy outcome was the perioperative mean core body temperature measured by a tympanic infrared thermometer. Secondary outcomes were hypothermia incidence, change in core body temperature, length of stay in postanesthesia care unit, thermal comfort, patient satisfaction, ease of use, and adverse events related to the BARRIER EasyWarm blanket. Main ResultsThe BARRIER EasyWarm blanket significantly improved perioperative core body temperature compared with standard hospital blankets (36. 5 °C, SD 0. 4 °C, vs 36. 3, SD 0. 3 °C; P<. 001). Intraoperatively, in the intervention group, hypothermia incidence was 38 % compared with 60 % {{in the control group}} (P=. 001). Postoperatively, the figures were 24 % vs 49 %, respectively (P=. 001). Patients in the intervention group had significantly higher thermal comfort scores, preoperatively and postoperatively. No serious adverse effects were observed in either group. ConclusionsPerioperative use of the new self-warming blanket improves mean perioperative core body temperature, reduces the incidence of inadvertent perioperative hypothermia, and improves patients' thermal comfort during elective adult surgery...|$|R

Two sets of 6 attitude control nitrogen jets were mounted on the ends of the solar panels.

40|$|Tests {{conducted}} at the NASA Lewis Research Center's Supplemental Multilayer Insulation Research Facility (SMIRF) demonstrated that a hybrid <b>thermal</b> <b>control</b> system could eliminate boiloff of cryogenic propellants.

With long-duration cryogenic storage, propellants will boil off because of the environmental heating of the tank. To accommodate these losses, extra propellant is required along with larger propellant tanks.

The EATCS consists of two independent Loops (Loop A & Loop B), which both use mechanically pumped fluid state ammonia in closed-loop circuits. The EATCS is capable of rejecting up to 70 kW, and provides a substantial upgrade in heat rejection capacity from the 14 kW capability of the Early External Active Thermal Control System (EEATCS) via the Early Ammonia Servicer (EAS), which was launched on STS-105 and installed onto the P6 Truss.|$|E
50|$|Multilayer {{insulation}} (MLI) is {{the most}} common <b>passive</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>control</b> element used on spacecrafts. MLI prevent both heat losses to the environment and excessive heating from the environment. Spacecraft components such as propellant tanks, propellant lines, batteries, and solid rocket motors are also covered in MLI blankets to maintain ideal operating temperature. MLI consist of an outer cover layer, interior layer, and an inner cover layer. The outer cover layer needs to be opaque to sunlight, generate a low amount of particulate contaminates, and be able to survive in the environment and temperature to which the spacecraft will be exposed. Some common materials used for the outer layer are fiberglass woven cloth impregnated with PTFE Teflon, PVF reinforced with Nomex bonded with polyester adhesive, and FEP Teflon. The general requirement for the interior layer is that it needs to have a low emittance. The most commonly used material for this layer is Mylar that is aluminized on one or both sides. The interior layers are usually thin compared to the outer layer to save weight and are perforated to aid in venting trapped air during launch. The inner cover faces the spacecraft hardware and is used to protect the thin interior layers. Inner covers are often not aluminized in order to prevent electrical shorts. Some materials used for the inner covers are Dacron and Nomex Netting. Mylar is not used because of flammability concerns. MLI blankets are an important element of the thermal control system.|$|E
