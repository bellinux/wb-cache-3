5|$|In July 1943, a plane {{carrying}} Sikorski <b>plunged</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> sea {{immediately after}} takeoff from Gibraltar, killing all on board except the pilot. The exact circumstances of Sikorski's death have been disputed and have {{given rise to}} a number of different theories surrounding the crash and his death. Sikorski had been the most prestigious leader of the Polish exiles, and his death was a severe setback for the Polish cause.|$|E
50|$|On {{a manual}} milling machine, the {{micrometer}} adjustment nut limits the depth {{to which the}} cutting tool may <b>plunge</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> workpiece. It is located on a threaded rod on the mill head. The machine operator moves it up or down by rotating it clockwise (to move it down) or counter-clockwise (to move it up). Moving the nut down increases the depth to which the cutting tool may <b>plunge</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> workpiece. Moving the nut up reduces the depth to which the cutting tool may <b>plunge</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> workpiece.|$|R

5|$|According to the Aviation Safety Network, Ethiopian Airlines records {{there have}} been 60 {{accidents}} and incidents since 1965, plus six more for Ethiopian Air Lines, the airline's former name. , these occurrences resulted in 337 deaths. One hijacking is the carrier's deadliest accident, when the plane <b>plunged</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Indian Ocean due to fuel starvation in 1996. The second-deadliest accident occurred in 2010, when an aircraft crashed into the Mediterranean Sea, shortly after it departed Beirut–Rafic Hariri International Airport, killing all 90 people on board. The crash of a Boeing 737-200 in 1988 led to 35 fatalities and ranks as the third most deadly accident experienced by the company. Despite this, Ethiopian Airlines has a good safety record, in contrast to other African airlines.|$|E
5|$|Flooding {{damage was}} also {{reported}} to infrastructure other than roads. After two rivers overflowed, at least 70% of Oxford was flooded, {{which included a}} hardware store and dozens of homes, while a senior citizens living complex were evacuated. The SOS Children's Village in Margaretsville sustained approximately $25,000 (1999CAD) in flood damage. Schools in Amherst and the University of Windsor canceled afternoon classes on September24. In the Canning area, 1,500people were left without power, while electricity was also lost in Annapolis Valley, Yarmouth, Truro, Westville, Amherst, and Stellarton. A woman required rescue by firemen after her van <b>plunged</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> swollen River Philip. In Maccan, a tractor trailer loaded with lumber went off the road. Damage in Nova Scotia likely exceeded $5million (1999CAD).|$|E

5|$|However, {{during the}} 1980s, two Sun-observing {{satellites}} serendipitously discovered several {{new members of}} the Kreutz family, and since {{the launch of the}} SOHO Sun-observing satellite in 1995, it has been possible to observe comets very close to the Sun at any time of year. The satellite provides a constant view of the immediate solar vicinity, and SOHO has now discovered hundreds of new Sun-grazing comets, some just a few metres across. About 83% of the sungrazers found by SOHO are members of the Kreutz group, with the other being referred to as 'non-Kreutz' or 'sporadic' sungrazers (Meyer, Marsden, and Kracht1&2 families). On average, a new member of the Kreutz family is discovered every three days. Apart from Comet Lovejoy, none of the sungrazers seen by SOHO has survived its perihelion passage; some may have <b>plunged</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Sun itself, but most are likely to have simply evaporated away completely.|$|E
5|$|Making for the harbour mouth, the British ship's bow {{and stern}} {{alternately}} rose and <b>plunged</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> incoming waves; the propeller at times was spinning in air, requiring a careful hand on the throttle to keep the shaft from running away to destruction. Green seas were boarding the vessel and running {{the length of the}} deck. There were ten men on the wheel and more below handling relieving tackle on the tiller to assist in maintaining control of the rudder. Taking two hours to travel four cables, the cruiser finally escaped the anchorage into the open sea, an achievement not known to Calliopes crew for some time, as sea spray and spume had reduced visibility to nothing.|$|E
5|$|McCudden set {{out across}} the English Channel. Unsure of the dispositions on the ground after the German advance he checked the {{airfield}} he suspected to be Boffles but found it empty. Flying in heavy mist he decided to head to Auxi-le-Château, France, to get directions from the RAF personnel stationed there. He approached Corporal W.H. Burdett and L. E Vallins of 52 Squadron. Burdett had served with McCudden in 3 Squadron back in 1915. Burdett did not recognise him in his flying gear. They marked his map and McCudden returned to his machine. Around 90 seconds after takeoff from Auxi-le-Château, the S.E.5a <b>plunged</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> ground. 8 Squadron's Corporal W.H. Howard was on the scene within minutes and fought through the fire to free McCudden who was lying {{next to one of}} the wings—he had not worn his safety belt. Burdett followed and recognised the pilot as soon as his headgear had been removed. He was taken to No. 21 Casualty clearing station and diagnosed with a fractured skull. He did not regain consciousness and died at 20:00.|$|E

5|$|Following its {{construction}} in 1874, the Whipple truss {{bridge over the}} South Branch Potomac River served Romney and travelers along the Northwestern Turnpike for 63 years. In 1935, the West Virginia State Road Commission began organizing a project to replace the Whipple truss bridge, and construction of the new bridge had begun by 1936. In November of that year, a car collided with {{the south side of}} the eastern Whipple truss span, which knocked the span completely off its eastern abutment. The car <b>plunged</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> South Branch Potomac River, followed by the compromised truss span, which collapsed on top of the car. Unaware of the span's collapse, a car traveling from the west drove off the end of the west span at the bridge's center pier, and fell onto the collapsed span. According to the Hampshire Review, the only serious injury sustained was a broken wooden leg. Following the collapse of the eastern Whipple truss span, a temporary wooden span was hastily constructed between the western truss span and the eastern abutment, so that traffic was uninterrupted until the new bridge was completed and opened on June 21, 1937. The 1937 bridge was used until 2010 when it was replaced by the current South Branch Bridge.|$|E
