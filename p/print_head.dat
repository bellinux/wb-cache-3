25|$|A {{thermal printer}} (or direct thermal printer) {{produces}} a printed image by selectively heating coated thermochromic paper, or thermal paper {{as it is}} commonly known, when the paper passes over the thermal <b>print</b> <b>head.</b> The coating turns black in the areas where it is heated, producing an image.|$|E
25|$|Stepper motors {{were and}} still are often used in {{computer}} printers, optical scanners, and digital photocopiers to move the optical scanning element, the <b>print</b> <b>head</b> carriage (of dot matrix and inkjet printers), and the platen or feed rollers. Likewise, many computer plotters (which since the early 1990s have been replaced with large-format inkjet and laser printers) used rotary stepper motors for pen and platen movement; the typical alternatives here were either linear stepper motors or servomotors with closed-loop analog control systems.|$|E

500|$|Schwalbach later {{replaced}} the piano-like keys with [...] "buttons" [...] and positioned them into four banked rows. [...] The {{mechanics of the}} machine, however, made the alphabetical arrangement problematic. The typebars were attached to the circumference of a metal ring, forming a [...] "basket". When a key was pressed, the corresponding typebar would swing upwards, causing the <b>print</b> <b>head</b> to strike {{at the center of}} the ring. Gravity would then return the typebar to its initial position. The implication of this design, however, was that pressing adjoining keys in quick succession would cause their typebars to collide and jam the machine. To mitigate this problem, keys were reordered using analysis of letter frequency and trial and error. Densmore asked his son-in-law, a Pennsylvania school superintendent, what letters and combinations of letters appeared most often in the English language. Typebars corresponding to letters in commonly occurring alphabetical pairs, such as S and T, were placed on opposite sides on the ring. The keyboard ultimately presented to Remington was arranged as follows: ...|$|E

At least one case of severe injury was noted from an explosion involved in metal powders used for fused filament printing. [...] Other general health and safety concerns include the hot surface of UV lamps and <b>print</b> <b>head</b> blocks, high voltage, ultraviolet radiation from UV lamps, and potential for mechanical injury from moving parts.|$|E

2500|$|There {{have been}} several {{technical}} applications for the Möbius strip. [...] Giant Möbius strips {{have been used as}} conveyor belts that last longer because the entire surface area of the belt gets the same amount of wear, and as continuous-loop recording tapes (to double the playing time). [...] Möbius strips are common in the manufacture of fabric computer printer and typewriter ribbons, as they let the ribbon be twice as wide as the <b>print</b> <b>head</b> while using both halves evenly.|$|E
2500|$|A {{dot matrix}} printer or impact matrix printer refers to a type of {{computer}} printer with a <b>print</b> <b>head</b> that runs {{back and forth on}} the page and prints by impact, striking an ink-soaked cloth ribbon against the paper, much like a typewriter. Unlike a typewriter or daisy wheel printer, letters are drawn out of a dot matrix, and thus, varied fonts and arbitrary graphics can be produced. [...] Because the printing involves mechanical pressure, these printers can create carbon copies and carbonless copies.|$|E
2500|$|A {{servo system}} differs from some stepper motor {{applications}} {{in that the}} position feedback is continuous while the motor is running; a stepper system relies on the motor not to [...] "miss steps" [...] for short term accuracy, although a stepper system may include a [...] "home" [...] switch or other element to provide long-term stability of control. For instance, when a typical dot matrix computer printer starts up, its controller makes the <b>print</b> <b>head</b> stepper motor drive to its left-hand limit, where a position sensor defines home position and stops stepping. As long as power is on, a bidirectional counter in the printer's microprocessor keeps track of print-head position.|$|E
50|$|An {{intermediate}} method does exist: {{a disposable}} ink tank {{connected to a}} disposable head, which is replaced infrequently (perhaps every tenth ink tank or so). Most high-volume Hewlett-Packard inkjet printers use this setup, with the disposable <b>print</b> <b>heads</b> used on lower volume models. A similar approach is used by Kodak, where the printhead intended for permanent use is nevertheless inexpensive and can {{be replaced by the}} user. Canon now uses (in most models) replaceable <b>print</b> <b>heads</b> which are designed to last the life of the printer, but can be replaced by the user should they become clogged.|$|R

2500|$|Each dot is {{produced}} by a tiny metal rod, also called a [...] "wire" [...] or [...] "pin", which is driven forward by [...] {{the power of a}} tiny electromagnet or solenoid, either directly or through small levers (pawls). Facing the ribbon and the paper is a small guide plate (often made of an artificial jewel such as sapphire or ruby [...] ) pierced with holes to serve as guides for the pins. The moving portion of the printer is called the <b>print</b> <b>head,</b> and when running the printer as a generic text device generally prints one line of text at a time. Most dot matrix printers have a single vertical line of dot-making equipment on their print heads; others have a few interleaved rows in order to improve dot density.|$|E
50|$|In {{the case}} of edgeline {{printing}} technology, the <b>print</b> <b>head</b> is wide {{enough to cover the}} size of the printing paper supported in the printer.

50|$|The {{printing}} {{depends on}} the smooth flow of ink, which can be hindered if the ink begins to dry at the <b>print</b> <b>head,</b> as can happen when an ink level becomes low. Dried ink can be cleaned from a cartridge <b>print</b> <b>head</b> using isopropyl alcohol or water. Isopropyl alcohol will damage the printing head, melting the plastic at the connections and rubber gaskets. Tap water contains contaminants that may clog the <b>print</b> <b>head,</b> so distilled water and a lint-free cloth is recommended.|$|E
50|$|The common serial {{dot matrix}} {{printers}} use a horizontally moving <b>print</b> <b>head.</b> The <b>print</b> <b>head</b> {{can be thought}} of featuring a single vertical column of seven or more pins approximately the height of a character box. In reality, the pins are arranged in up to four vertically or/and horizontally slightly displaced columns in order to increase the dot density and print speed through interleaving without causing the pins to jam. Thereby, up to 48 pins can be used to form the characters of a line while the <b>print</b> <b>head</b> moves horizontally.|$|E
50|$|The {{disposable}} head philosophy uses a <b>print</b> <b>head</b> {{which is}} supplied {{as a part}} of a replaceable ink cartridge. Every time a cartridge is exhausted, the entire cartridge and <b>print</b> <b>head</b> are replaced with a new one. This adds to the cost of consumables and makes it more difficult to manufacture a high-precision head at a reasonable cost, but also means that a damaged or clogged <b>print</b> <b>head</b> is only a minor problem: the user can simply buy a new cartridge. Hewlett-Packard has traditionally favoured the disposable <b>print</b> <b>head,</b> as did Canon in its early models. This type of construction can also be seen as an effort by printer manufacturers to stem third party ink cartridge assembly replacements, as these would-be suppliers don't have the ability to manufacture specialized print heads.|$|E
40|$|Cell {{printing}} is {{a promising}} technology in tissue engineering, {{with which the}} complex threedimensional tissue constructs can be formed by sequentially printing the cells layer-by-layer.

To get a better understanding of drop on demand piezoelectric cell printing, a cell printing experiment system with commercial piezoelectric ink jet <b>printing</b> <b>head</b> and configurable drive circuit is developed. And a series of cell printing experiment with yeast cell is performed to study the influence of drive parameters, cell solution density and viscosity of the solution on cell survival rate, droplet density and orifice status. The experimental results show that the cell solution density and its viscosity are key issue for cell printing with commercial <b>printing</b> <b>head,</b> and a large drive pulse width is helpful for printing the cell solution with a high cell density and viscosit...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} 3 DP- 0, a modular, multi-material 3 D printer. Currently, 3 D printers {{available on}} the market are typically expensive and difficult to develop. In addition, the simultaneous use of multiple materials in 3 D printing has not been extensively explored. The printer presented in this thesis was developed to address these shortcomings. The printer features a low-cost high-performance design largely using commercial off-the-shelf parts. Inkjet <b>print</b> <b>heads</b> from commercial desktop printers allow {{the use of multiple}} materials within a single print. In addition, the modular and open design of the printer allows the independent and continuing development of <b>print</b> <b>heads</b> and <b>print</b> materials. Testing has shown the system to be capable of producing objects with fine features, including 500 [mu]m-wide cubes containing multiple materials separated within a core. by Justin Lan. Thesis (S. M.)

5000|$|Dr. An Wang, Robert Howard and Prentice Robinson began {{development}} of a low-cost printer at Centronics, a subsidiary of Wang Laboratories that produced specialty computer terminals. The printer used the dot matrix printing principle, with a <b>print</b> <b>head</b> consisting of a vertical row of seven metal pins connected to solenoids. When power {{was applied to the}} solenoids, the pin was pulled forward to strike the paper and leave a dot. To make a complete character glyph, the <b>print</b> <b>head</b> would receive power to specified pins to create a single vertical pattern, then the <b>print</b> <b>head</b> would move to the right by a small amount, and the process repeated. On their original design, a typical glyph was printed as a matrix seven high and five wide, while the [...] "A" [...] models used a <b>print</b> <b>head</b> with 9 pins and formed glyphs that were 9 by 7.|$|E
5000|$|Several {{manufacturers}} implemented color dot-matrix impact printing {{through a}} multi-color ribbon. Color was achieved through a multi-pass composite printing process. During each pass, the <b>print</b> <b>head</b> struck a different {{section of the}} ribbon (one primary color). For a 4-color ribbon, each printed line of output required up to 3 passes depending on color. In some color printers, such as the Apple ImageWriter II and Star Micronics NX-1000C [...] "Rainbow" [...] or the optional color kits for the NEC Pinwriter series, the printer moved the ribbon vertically relative to the fixed <b>print</b> <b>head</b> assembly. In other models, the <b>print</b> <b>head</b> was tilted against a stationary ribbon.|$|E

50|$|Digital Printers are {{sometimes}} erroneously {{referred to as}} being “Digital Printing Presses”. The term Printing Press refers {{to the nature of}} the process, in which there is contact between the system that applies the ink to the substrate and substrate that the ink is pressed onto.

50|$|In {{addition}} to volumetric color {{by use of}} multiple <b>print</b> <b>heads</b> and colored binder, the 3D printing process is generally faster than other additive manufacturing technologies such as fused deposition modeling material jetting which require 100% of build and support material to be deposited at the desired resolution. In 3D printing, the bulk of each printed layer, regardless of complexity, is deposited by the same, rapid spreading process.|$|R
