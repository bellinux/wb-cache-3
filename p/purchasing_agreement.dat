The mining was hit by two strikes in 1919, the first lasting from the summer to October, and the second from November to January 1920. Because of the ice, each year the shipping was limited from May through October. By 1919 the company had fallen into severe financial difficulties. A British take-over was waved off and instead state coal <b>purchasing</b> <b>agreement,</b> effectively subsidies, were enforced. By 1921 the men had started bringing their families, raising the female population to twenty-two and the child population to twenty-three. An improvised school was therefore taken into use.|$|E
2500|$|While {{agreement}} {{is the basis}} for all contracts, not all agreements are enforceable. A preliminary question is whether the contract is reasonably certain in its essential terms, or essentialia negotii, such as price, subject matter and the identity of the parties. Generally the courts endeavour to [...] "make the agreement work", so in Hillas & Co Ltd v Arcos Ltd, the House of Lords held that an option to buy softwood of [...] "fair specification" [...] was sufficiently certain to be enforced, when read in the context of previous agreements between the parties. However the courts do not wish to [...] "make contracts for people", and so in Scammell and Nephew Ltd v Ouston, a clause stipulating the price of buying a new van as [...] "on hire purchase terms" [...] for two years was held unenforceable because there was no objective standard by which the court could know what price was intended or what a reasonable price might be. Similarly, in Baird Textile Holdings Ltd v M plc the Court of Appeal held that because the price and quantity to buy would be uncertain, in part, no term could be implied for M to give reasonable notice before terminating its <b>purchasing</b> <b>agreement.</b> Controversially, the House of Lords extended this idea by holding an agreement to negotiate towards a future contract in good faith is insufficiently certain to be enforceable.|$|E

We do not even notice that we all meet with one of its types every day when buying things in the supermarket.

The thesis is composed of thirteen chapters, each of them dealing with different aspects of the <b>purchase</b> <b>agreement.</b> It starts with its history. Then it defines the legal regulations of the <b>purchase</b> <b>agreement,</b> describes its definition, essentials, claims of a seller and a purchaser in case of wrong performance, and also illustrates the possibilities of adjoining agreements which can be added to the <b>purchase</b> <b>agreement,</b> and at last it looks at the special types of the <b>purchase</b> <b>agreement</b> and at the <b>purchase</b> <b>agreement</b> composed in the form of the notarial record.

At the same time, new roads, snowmobiles and bush airlines facilitated access to distant hunting territories of the interior. While highly motivated, the Cree's opposition to the Great Whale River Project was mainly ineffective until 1992 when the State of New York withdrew from a multibillion-dollar power <b>purchasing</b> <b>agreement</b> due to public outcry and a decrease in energy requirements.

50|$|The power station, {{which is}} {{expected}} to come online in March 2015, has a generating capacity of 2.4 Megawatts. Construction was completed in January 2015. Biojoule Kenya Limited, the company that owns he power station, signed a 20-year power <b>purchasing</b> <b>agreement</b> with Kenya Power and Lighting Company, to supply 2MW to the national electricity grid. Once operational, the power station will be the first biogas-fired power plant to sell power to the national grid. Power is generated using plant waste generated on the 800 ha Gorge Farm, near Lake Naivasha, owned by VP Group, an investor in the power project. The plant material is allowed to decompose anaerobically, generating gases, including methane. The gases are burnt, generating heat, which is used to heat water, generating steam. The steam is then used to run electricity generators. Some of the heat is used to warm greenhouses on the arm. The power generated will be evacuated via a substation within nearby Naivasha Town.|$|E

50|$|With these coal {{deposits}} in mind, a <b>purchasing</b> <b>agreement</b> {{was signed in}} 1981 by two Canadian mining companies, a consortium of Japanese steel mills, and the governments of British Columbia and Canada. As part of the deal, the provincial government committed, under the North East Coal Development plan, {{to build a new}} town near the deposits, two highways off Highway 97, a power line from the W. A. C. Bennett Dam at Hudson's Hope, and a branch rail line through the Rocky Mountains. An alternative of using work camps staffed by people from Dawson Creek and Chetwynd was also considered. Massive initial investments were required as planning for the new town began in 1976 with the objective of having a fully functioning town ready before residents arrived. Coordinated through the provincial Ministry of Municipal Affairs the town, regional infrastructure, and mining plants were all built simultaneously. When the municipality was incorporated in April 1981 the area was completely forested. During that year building sites and roadways were cleared and in the winter the water and sewerage system was built. In 1982, houses and other buildings were constructed. Full production at the mines was reached the following year.|$|E

50|$|In 1984, world coal {{prices were}} {{dropping}} and the Japanese consortium requested {{a reduction in}} the price of coal from the Tumbler Ridge mines. As price reduction requests continued, the concern over the viability of the mines led the BC Assessment Authority to lower the 1987 property assessments for the Quintette mine from CAD$156 million to $89 million and the Bullmoose mine $70 million to $43 million. This lowered their taxes as they tried to enforce the <b>purchasing</b> <b>agreement</b> at the Supreme Court of Canada. Their 1990 ruling required the Quintette Operations Company to reduce coal prices and reimburse the Japanese consortium $4.6 million. The company responded by reducing production, cutting employment, and applying for court protection from creditors. This allowed Teck to acquire 50% interest and take over management of the Quintette mine, but it was unable to stop further job losses. As most residents left town, apartment blocks were closed and the mine companies bought back all but 11 houses in the town. After 30% of the workforce had been laid off, new contracts with the Japanese consortium were signed in 1997, allowing re-hirings to begin, but with lower export levels. The North East Coal Development was projected to create a net benefit of CAD$0.9 billion (2000), but incurred a net loss of $2.8 billion and half the expected regional employment.|$|E

50|$|The park, though profitable, {{was still}} an {{earnings}} disappointment for Marriott, leading the company in 1983 to explore options to sell. An interested party, Caz Development Co., appraised the land value at US$800,000 to $1 million per acre. Marriott also involved the city of Santa Clara in negotiations, which was already leasing 55 acre of parking space for the amusement park. Fearing development of the land by Caz Development would aggravate already congested roadways, the city council approved a $101 million <b>purchasing</b> <b>agreement</b> on January 31, 1984, by a 4-3 vote that also had {{to be approved by}} city residents. The citywide vote passed, approving the sale by a margin of 3 to 1. Caz Development then sued the city and Marriott in the Superior Court of Santa Clara County to block the transaction. The court nullified the sale, forcing the city to attempt to salvage the deal through negotiations with the other parties. Unable to broker a timely agreement, the city council voted 6-1 to scuttle the sale on February 5, 1985, though the city was still interested in owning the park. After Marriott refunded a $20 million down payment back to the city, negotiations were restarted. All parties were able to agree on a compromise, which was signed in marathon sessions taking place in early June 1985. The city acquired the park for $93.5 million from Marriott, which retained 20 acre from the sale for development. Caz Development settled and was allowed to build a hotel and office near the park, which the city renamed Great America.|$|E
