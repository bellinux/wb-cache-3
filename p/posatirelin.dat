40|$|The {{effect of}} 4 and 8 weeks of {{treatment}} with the {{thyrotropin releasing hormone}} (TRH), analogue <b>posatirelin</b> (L- 6 -ketopiperidine- 2 -carbonyl-L-leucyl-proline amide), on the changes of cholinergic neurotransmission enzymes, choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE), caused by lesions of the nucleus basalis magnocellularis (NBM), was investigated in the rat frontal cortex. ChAT and AChE were demonstrated with immunohistochemical and histochemical techniques, respectively associated with image analysis and microdensitometry. Monolateral and bilateral lesions of NBM area caused a significant loss of ChAT-immunoreactive nerve cell bodies in the NBM, {{as well as a}} remarkable decrease of ChAT-immunoreactive fibres and of AChE reactivity in the frontal cortex ipsilateral to the lesion or of both sides, respectively. The number of ChAT-immunoreactive nerve cell bodies in the lesioned NBM was higher in posatirelin-treated rats for 8 weeks in comparison with control NBM-lesioned rats. Moreover, the compound increased the number of ChAT-immunoreactive fibres in the frontal cortex of monolaterally and bilaterally NBM-lesioned rats at 8 weeks after lesion, but was without effect on these fibres in sham-operated rats. The same is true for AChE reactivity, developed in the neuropil of the frontal cortex, which was restored in part by an 8 -week treatment with <b>posatirelin</b> in NBM-lesioned rats. These findings suggest that treatment with <b>posatirelin</b> rescues cholinergic neurons of the NBM and cholinergic projections to the cerebral cortex affected by lesioning of the NBM. The functional relevance of these observations and their possible applications should be evaluated in future studies...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} 4 and 8 weeks {{treatment}} with 10 mg/kg/day of the {{thyrotropin releasing hormone}} analogue <b>posatirelin</b> (L- 6 -ketopiperidine- 2 -carbonyl-L-leucyl-proline amide) on microanatomical changes induced by monolateral and bilateral lesions of the nucleus basalis magnocellularis (NBM) were investigated. The following parameters were assessed in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of NBM-lesioned and sham-operated rats: 1) number of nerve cell and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) -immunoreactive astrocyte profiles; 2) density of silver-gold impregnated fibres; 3) density of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) -immunoreactive fibres; 4) intensity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) staining. In NBM-lesioned untreated rats, no changes {{in the number of}} nerve cell or of astrocyte profiles were found either in the frontal cortex or in the hippocampus. The only exception was a {{decrease in the number of}} granule neuron profiles in the dentate gyrus at 8 weeks after lesioning. Silver-gold impregnated fibres, which express the width of interneuronal connections, were reduced in the hippocampus but not in the frontal cortex of NBM-lesioned rats. ChAT immunoreactivity and AChE reactivity, which were localised respectively in nerve fibre-like structures and in the neuropil, were decreased in the frontal cortex but not in the hippocampus from the fourth week after NBM lesioning. Lesions did not change the number of ChAT-immunoreactive nerve fibres or intensity of AChE staining in the hippocampus. Treatment with <b>posatirelin</b> was without effect on the number of nerve cell profiles or of GFAP-immunoreactive astrocytes both at 4 and 8 weeks after NBM lesioning. Treatment with the compound increased the number of silver-gold impregnated fibres in the hippocampus of NBM-lesioned rats and restored in part ChAT immunoreactivity and AChE reactivity in the frontal cortex. These effects were noticeable in NBM-lesioned rats after 8 weeks of treatment. The possible significance of the neuroprotective effect elicited by <b>posatirelin</b> treatment after lesions of the NBM is discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of monolateral and bilateral lesions of the Locus coeruleus (LC) {{on the number}} of nerve cell and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) -immunoreactive astrocyte profiles, on silver-gold impregnated fibres and on tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunoreactivity was assessed in the rat frontal cortex and hippocampus. The {{influence of}} treatment for 4 and 8 weeks with a 10 mg/kg/day dose of the neuroactive peptide <b>posatirelin</b> on the above parameters was also investigated. Lesions of the LC decreased the number of nerve cell profiles in the frontal cortex 8 weeks after lesioning and were without effect on nerve cell profiles in the frontal cortex 4 weeks after lesioning and in the hippocampus at both 4 and 8 weeks after LC lesioning. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) -immunoreactive astrocytes were not affected by lesions of LC. Silver-gold impregnated fibres were decreased in the frontal cortex but not in the hippocampus of LC-lesioned rats at 8 weeks after lesioning. TH immunoreactivity, which was localized in nerve fibre-like structures both in the frontal cortex and in the hippocampus was decreased in the frontal cortex and in the hippocampus from the 4 th week after LC lesioning. Treatment with <b>posatirelin</b> was without effect {{on the number of}} nerve cell and of GFAP-immunoreactive astrocyte profiles at both 4 and 8 weeks after LC lesioning, with the exception of nerve cells of the frontal cortex in monolaterally-lesioned rats which were increased 8 weeks after lesioning. The compound increased silver-gold impregnated fibres in the frontal cortex of monolaterally lesioned rats after 8 weeks of treatment, but did not affect TH immunoreactivity both in the frontal cortex or in the hippocampus. The above results suggest that treatment with <b>posatirelin</b> exerts a neuroprotective effect on the frontal cortex consisting of the partial restoration of some microanatomical changes caused by lesions of LC. The possible significance of this effect is discussed...|$|E
