The slat cove filler is preferably made of a super elastic shape memory alloy, and the slat cove filler shifts between stowed and deployed shapes as the slat is deployed. The slat cove filler may be configured such that a separate <b>powered</b> <b>actuator</b> {{is not required to}} change the shape of the slat cove filler from its deployed shape to its stowed shape and vice-versa.

40|$|Variable {{stiffness}} actuators (VSA) are fostered in robotics {{for their}} capability to address physical interaction with a physically adjustable compliance, being advantageous {{in terms of}} efficiency, safety and adaptability to unknown environments. Here we introduce {{the concept of a}} switching VSA (sVSA), in which a single actuator is used to control the position or the stiffness of a robotic joint according to a mechanical switch. Despite not allowing simultaneous control of both quantities, this architecture has the potential to make the design lighter, requiring one continuously <b>powered</b> <b>actuator,</b> controllable in position, and one additional switch, activated only occasionally between two limit stages: the advantages are the separation of the motors power requirements and a simpler control. A first prototype of a 1 -DoF revolute variable-stiffness joint has been built, based on the vsaUT-II developed at the University of Twente, with a novel clutch mechanism allowing continuous and efficient switching. The prototype proved functionality and feasibility of the sVSA concept...|$|E
40|$|This study {{deals with}} the {{possibility}} of raising the flutter speed of an aeroelastic system by feedback control. Emphasis is given to feedback control through a control surface driven by a <b>powered</b> <b>actuator.</b> It is shown that only for certain aeroelastic systems is it possible to significantly raise the flutter speed by this type of feedback control. In addition, a second type of feedback control is considered, a jet reaction torquer acting on the wing itself. A marked increase in flutter speed is possible in essentially all aeroelastic systems with this form of control. Despite the fact that this type of controller requires more power than the control surface actuator, its use may be practical in many cases. The question of the reliability of the feedback control used to raise flutter speed is becoming less important in this era of missiles where the entire system is controlled by automatic devices. Part I discusses the basic problem. Parts II and III develop a general feedback theory. This theory, when applied to a specific aeroelastic system, permits ready determination of whether an increase in flutter speed is possible for that system. Parts IV and V consider numerical investigations of many systems using a control surface actuator. Analyses are made by both the general feedback theory and by analog computer, showing similar numerical results. Part VI considers the jet reaction torquer and the increase in flutter speed that it can achieve. Conclusions are presented in Part VII...|$|E

50|$|Both {{hydraulic}} and {{pneumatic power}} {{may be used}} to drive an actuator, usually the larger and more powerful types. As their internal construction is generally similar (in principle, if not in size) they are often considered together as fluid <b>power</b> <b>actuators.</b> Fluid <b>power</b> <b>actuators</b> are of two common forms: those where a linear piston and cylinder mechanism is geared to produce rotation (illustrated), and those where a rotating asymmetrical vane swings through a cylinder of two different radii. The differential pressure between {{the two sides of the}} vane gives rise to an unbalanced force and thus a torque on the output shaft. Vane actuators require a number of sliding seals and the joints between these seals have tended to cause more problems with leakage than for the piston and cylinder type.|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} optimal control {{processes}} for closed-loop chain SCARA-like robots {{is the subject}} of this thesis. In comparison with the well-known SCARA robot, the proposed new structure is characterized by the incorporation of an additional <b>powered</b> <b>actuator,</b> several unpowered actuators and an additional link that gives a closed-loop chain robot. The performance of the SCARA-like robot with various arrangements of powered and unpowered actuators is addressed by formulating and solving energy-optimal and time-optimal control problems for periodic pick-and-place operations in the horizontal plane. Two computational methods suitable for solving optimal control problems for two-degree-of-freedom closed-loop chain SCARA-like robots are developed. With the direct parameter optimization approach, the relevant optimal control problems are converted into nonlinear programming problems using an inverse dynamics based method with polynomial-Fourier series approximation of the generalized coordinates and the redundant torques. The resulting constrained nonlinear optimization problems are solved using sequential quadratic programming (SQP). An indirect computational method based on Pontryagins maximum principle is also developed. The necessary conditions of optimality are derived for the problems considered, and the resulting multi-point boundary-value problems are solved with a smoothing-continuation approach and an adaptive collocation method. In closed-loop chain robots with more actuators than degrees-of-freedom (overactuation), the dynamic redundancy enables optimization of the force distribution. Unpowered spring-like drives can assist the powered actuators or control some of the degrees-of-freedom of a manipulator robot (semi-passive control). Here, the advantages of overactuation and semi-passive control for the SCARA-like robots are demonstrated analytically and numerically for both given motion and periodic pick-and-place operations. The numerical results for the solutions to the energy-optimal control problems show that the energy consumption and maximum torque required of the active actuators for typical pick-and-place operations can be reduced by using overactuation or adding unpowered drives to the structure of the robot. Using semi-passive control of the SCARA-like robot also allows simplification of the control system by reducing the number of powered actuators (underactuation). The results from the time-optimal control problems confirm the advantages of overactuation and semi-passive control. The results obtained in this thesis suggest that other mechanical systems and machines with periodic motion, such as various robots, automatic cyclic machines and bipedal robots, can benefit from overactuation and semi-passive control...|$|E
40|$|The {{number of}} people with spinal cord injury (SCI) is {{increasing}} every year and walking {{has been found to be}} the most exciting and important prospect to these patients to improve their quality of life. Many individuals with incomplete SCI have the potential to walk and everyone of them wants to try. Unfortunately up to now, there is less than one third of patients could walk again after SCI. Residual function, the orthotic support, energy expenditure, patient motivation and control technique are some of the factors that influence the walking outcome of spinal cord injured people. In this thesis, a series of studies are carried out to investigate the possibility of enhancing the performance of the functional electrical stimulation (PES) assisted paraplegic walking with wheel walker through the development and implementation of intelligent control technique and spring brake orthosis (SBO) with full utilization of the voluntary upper body effort. The main aim of this thesis is to enable individuals with complete paraplegia to walk again with maximum performance and the simplest approach as possible. Firstly, before simulation of the system can be made, it is important to select the right model to represent the actual plant. In this thesis, the development of a humanoid and wheel walker models are carried out using MSC. visualNastran 4 D (vN 4 D) software and this is integrated with Matlab Simulink® for simulation. The newly developed quadriceps and hamstrings muscle models from the series of experiments are used to represent subject muscles after comparison and validation with other two well-known muscle models are performed. Several experiments are conducted to investigate the effect of stimulation frequency and pulse-width in intermittent stimulation with isometric measurement from paraplegic subjects. The results from this work can serve as a guidance to determine the optimum stimulation parameters such as frequency and pulse-width to reduce muscle fatigue during PES application. The ability test is introduced to determine the maximum leg force that can be applied to the specific paraplegic subject during FES functional task with minimum chance of spasm and leg injury. Investigations are carried out on the control techniques implemented for FES walking with wheel walker. PID control and fuzzy logic control (FLC) are used to regulate the electrical stimulation required by the quadriceps and hamstrings muscles in order to perform the FES walking manoeuvre according to predefined walking trajectory. The body weight transfer is introduced to increase the efficiency of FES walking performance. The effectiveness of body weight transfer and control strategy to enhance the performance of FES walking and reduce stimulation pulses required is examined. Investigations are carried out on the effectiveness of spring brake orthosis (SBO) for FES assisted paraplegic walking with wheel walker. A new concept in hybrid orthotics provides solutions to the problems that affect current 'hybrid orthosis, including knee and hip flexion without relying on the withdrawal reflex or a <b>powered</b> <b>actuator</b> and foot-ground clearance without extra upper body effort. The use of SBO can also eliminate electrical stimulation pulses required by the hamstrings muscle for the same FES walking system. Further improvement of the FES walking system is achieved by introducing finite state control (FSC) to control the switching time between springs, brakes and electrical stimulation during FES assisted walking with wheel walker with the combInation of FLC to regulate the electrical stimulation required for the knee extension. The results show that FSC can be used to accurately control the switching time and improve the system robustness and stability...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Recent {{developments}} in millimeter-scale fabrication processes {{have led to}} rapid progress towards creating airborne flapping wing robots based on Dipteran (two-winged) insects. Previous work to regulate reaction forces and torques generated by two flapping wings has largely focused on wing trajectory control. An alternative approach introduces additional degrees of freedom to the wing flapping mechanism to passively regulate these forces and torques. The resulting ‘mechanically intelligent’ devices can execute wing trajectory corrections to realize desired body forces and torques without the intervention of an active controller. This paper describes an insect-scale flapping wing aeromechanical structure consisting of a piezoelectric bimorph <b>power</b> <b>actuator,</b> an underactuated transmission mechanism, and passively rotating wings. The transmission is designed to passively modulate wing stroke velocity to eliminate the net roll torque imparted to the airframe. The system is modeled as having four degrees of freedom driven open-loop by a single <b>power</b> <b>actuator.</b> The theoretical model predicts lift-generating wing trajectories {{as well as a}} passive reduction in roll torque experienced by the airframe. An at-scale structure constructed using Smart Composite Microstructure (SCM) fabrication techniques provides experimental support for the theoretical model. I...|$|R
