40|$|A {{strategy}} has been developed to computationally accelerate the response time of a generic electronic sensor. The strategy can be deployed as an algorithm in a control system or as a physical interface (on an embedded microcontroller) between a slower responding external sensor and a higher-speed control system. Optional code implementations are available to adjust algorithm performance when computational capability is limited. In one option, the actual sensor signal can be sampled at the slower rate with adaptive linear neural networks predicting the sensor's future output and interpolating intermediate synthetic output values. In another option, a synchronized collection of predictors sequentially controls the corresponding synthetic output voltage. Error is adaptively corrected in both options. The core {{strategy has}} been demonstrated with automotive oxygen sensor data. A prototype interface device is under construction. The response speed increase afforded by this strategy could greatly offset the cost of developing a replacement sensor with a faster <b>physical</b> <b>response</b> <b>time...</b>|$|E
40|$|According to Garner, visual {{patterns}} are mentally represented as categories {{rather than by}} their physical identity. However, physical and categorical identification tasks engender their own specific processing strategies. Nevertheless, categorical strategies should be more generic than physical ones. We tested this prediction using Garner patterns in a same-different task: one version involved categorical, the other physical identification. Both tasks showed effects of categorical representation but also contrasting categorical and physical processing strategies in their response time profiles. When trials from categorical and physical identification tasks were randomly intermixed, mixing costs were additive for categorical trials but not for physical trials, indicating a shift in processing strategy for the latter. For these trials, the <b>physical</b> <b>response</b> <b>time</b> profile {{was found to be}} displaced by a categorical profile. We concluded that the more generic processing strategy is the one that maximizes the role of categorical representation. Gestalt laws, such as Proximity and Symmetry have shown to be rigid and quantifiable and might, thus, be considered psychophysical laws, i. e. functions of physical properties o...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to couple a {{regional}} (Southern Ocean) ocean/sea ice model to the existing Goddard Institute for Space Science (GISS) atmospheric general circulation model (GCM). This modification recognizes: the relative isolation of the Southern Ocean; the need to account, prognostically, for the significant air/sea/ice interaction through all involved components; and the advantage of translating the atmospheric lower boundary (typically the rapidly changing ocean surface) to a level {{that is consistent with}} the <b>physical</b> <b>response</b> <b>times</b> governing the system evolution (that is, {{to the base of the}} fast responding ocean surface layer). The deeper ocean beneath this layer varies on time scales several orders of magnitude slower than the atmosphere and surface ocean, and therefore the boundary between the upper and deep ocean represents a more reasonable fixed boundary condition...|$|R
40|$|Most {{deliberations}} {{on climate}} policy {{are based on}} a mitigation response that assumes a gradually increasing reduction over time. However, situations may occur where a more urgent response is needed. A key question for climate policy in general, but even more in the case a rapid response is needed, is: what are the characteristic <b>response</b> <b>times</b> of the <b>response</b> options, such as rapid mitigation or solar radiation management (SRM) ? This paper explores this issue, which has not received a lot of attention yet, by looking into the role of both societal and <b>physical</b> <b>response</b> <b>times.</b> For mitigation, technological and economic inertia clearly limit reduction rates with considerable uncertainty corresponding to political inertia and societies' ability to organize rapid mitigation action at what costs. The paper looks into a rapid emission reductions of 4 - 6 % annually. Reduction rates at the top end of this range (up to 6 %) could effectively reduce climate change, but only with a noticeable delay. Temperatures could be above those in the year of policy introduction for more than 70 years, with unknown consequences of overshoot. A strategy based on SRM is shown to have much shorter <b>response</b> <b>times</b> (up to decades), but introduces an important element of risk, such as ocean acidification and the risk of extreme temperature shifts in case action is halted. Above all, the paper highlights the role of <b>response</b> <b>times</b> in designing effective policy strategies implying that a better understanding of these crucial factors is required...|$|R

50|$|While {{the general}} idea sounded {{somewhat}} promising, the Hardiman had major limitations. It was impractical, {{due to its}} 680-kilogram (1,500 lb) weight. Another issue was {{that it is a}} master-slave system, where the operator is in a master suit, which, in turn, is inside the slave suit that responds to the master and handles the workload. This multiple physical layer type of operation may work fine, but responds slower than a single physical layer. When the goal is <b>physical</b> enhancement, <b>response</b> <b>time</b> matters. Its slow walking speed of 0.76 metres per second (2.5 ft/s) further limited practical uses. The project was not successful. Any attempt to use the full exoskeleton resulted in a violent uncontrolled motion, and as a result it was never tested with a human inside. Further research concentrated on one arm. Although it could lift its specified load of 340 kg (750 lb), it weighed three quarters of a ton, just over twice the liftable load. Without getting all the components to work together, the practical uses for the Hardiman project were limited.|$|R

Clinical reasoning is complex and multi-factorial and key models of clinical reasoning within musculoskeletal physiotherapy are discussed, highlighting the omission of emotion and subsequent <b>physical</b> <b>responses</b> and how these can impact upon a clinician when making a decision. Discussion It is proposed that clinicians should consider the emotions associated with decision-making, especially when there is concern surrounding a presentation. Reflecting on practice in the clinical environment and subsequently applying this to a patient presentation should involve some acknowledgement of clinicians' <b>physical</b> <b>responses,</b> emotions and how they may {{play a part in}} any decision made. Presenting intuition and gut-feeling as separate reasoning methods and how these processes co-exist with other more accepted reasoning such as hypothetico-deductive is also discussed. Conclusion Musculoskeletal physiotherapy should consider the elements of feelings, emotions and <b>physical</b> <b>responses</b> when applying reflective practice principles. Furthermore, clinicians dealing with difficult and challenging presentations should look at the emotional as well as the analytical experience when justifying decisions and learning from practice...|$|R
