5000|$|The Dreamcast, PC, Game Boy Advance and N-Gage {{versions}} received [...] "generally favorable reviews" [...] {{according to}} the review aggregation website Metacritic. The main complaint in the individual reviews is that Worms World Party could have been just an expansion <b>pack</b> to <b>Worms</b> Armageddon.|$|R
40|$|Quantification of {{octopamine}} {{was performed}} using HPLC coupled with electrochemical detection. 30 µl of <b>packed</b> <b>worms</b> were homogenized with a pestle in 100 µl 0. 3 M perchloric acid and centrifuged at 13, 000 rpm at 4 °C {{to remove the}} insoluble residue. The supernatant was filtered through a 0. 22 µm centrifugal filter and diluted five-fold with DEMO mobile phase (ESA, Bedford, Mass., USA), which contains 90 mM sodium phosphate, 50 mM citric acid, 1. 7 mM 1 -octanesulfonic acid, 10 % acetonitrile adjusted to pH 3. 0 with phosphoric acid. Samples were injected into an ESA MD 150 /RP-C 18 column at a flow rate of 0. 5 ml/min. Eluted compounds were detected electrochemically using an ESA model 5011 detection system. Detector potentials were set at – 175 mV (channel 1) ...|$|R
50|$|On 12 July 2016, as a pre-order bonus, Team17 {{announced}} an expansion <b>pack</b> called <b>Worms</b> W.M.D All-Stars, featuring additional content themed after various other video games, {{such as the}} Octane Battle Car from Rocket League, several masks for worm customisation, various thematic weapons and additional missions. On 15 November 2016, All-Stars was released for free to all players.|$|R
50|$|A cut-down {{version for}} the PC was also {{released}} in 1998, also titled Worms Pinball, and was initially {{included in a}} <b>Worms</b> compilation <b>pack</b> containing <b>Worms</b> and Reinforcements United and Worms 2. It was also included with the first print run of Worms Blast for the PC in 2002, and in 2012 was released on Steam. This version {{does not include the}} World Rally Fever table.|$|R
5000|$|Worms Reinforcements (...) is an {{expansion}} <b>pack</b> for <b>Worms,</b> which was later amalgamated {{with the original}} game to create Worms and Reinforcements United (a.k.a. Worms United or Worms Utd.) the same year. Released only for the PC, it added a single player campaign {{and the ability to}} add custom levels and soundpacks (which was already available for the Amiga version). It also included an introductory FMV.|$|R
5|$|Originally {{meant to}} be an {{expansion}} <b>pack</b> to <b>Worms</b> 2 and initially titled Wormageddon, Worms Armageddon was released as a standalone game initially for PCs in 1999 and has since been ported to other platforms; the game was also released on Steam on 20 March 2013. The game was met with positive critic reviews, with gameplay receiving praise, and placed on several lists of the greatest games of all time.|$|R
5000|$|Worms Armageddon was {{initially}} {{intended to be}} released as an expansion <b>pack</b> for <b>Worms</b> 2, but was released as a stand-alone game when it exceeded all expectations. Worms Armageddon included 33 in-depth missions in an extensive and elaborate campaign, along with training missions, a [...] "deathmatch" [...] feature, some new graphics and sounds, and a few new weapons and utilities. Much of the customization of Worms 2 was removed, as Team17 thought that the interface would become cluttered and overwhelming.|$|R
5000|$|While {{the first}} {{versions}} of the game were generally praised, the series has since been criticized {{for the lack of}} meaningful additions. In 2001, Metacritic quoted Worms World Party reviews with comments such as [...] "it's virtually nothing more than an expansion <b>pack</b> for <b>Worms</b> Armageddon" [...] and, as ActionTrip's Dejan Grbavcic put it, [...] "And I thought that only Eidos was impertinent enough to keep selling the same game with a slightly different name...". In 2007, IGN included the Worms series in its list of game franchises that have jumped the shark.|$|R

50|$|The first {{additional}} downloadable content <b>pack</b> for <b>Worms</b> Battleground {{was titled}} 'Alien Invasion', and added various new items to the game. It {{was released in}} January 2015. The pack adds a new game mode called 'Body Count' in which the player scores points for killing worms, as well as adding more campaign levels for the player to complete. In addition to this, new weapons {{were added to the}} game, such as the Plasma Blaster, Energy Orbs and a UFO Strike, as well as adding various new customisable items to decorate the player's <b>worms.</b> The <b>pack</b> also added an additional five trophies and achievements to its list. 'Alien Invasion' was released on January 12th for the Xbox One and January 21st for the PlayStation 4.|$|R
5|$|Worms Armageddon was {{originally}} intended to be an expansion <b>pack</b> to <b>Worms</b> 2, but it was eventually developed as a standalone game. It {{was intended to be}} the last game of the Worms franchise, but Andy Davidson, the creator of Worms, felt that it needed more content before being released, leading to the development of Worms World Party. It was also going to be released under the name Wormageddon, but Team17 changed the name to Worms Armageddon because of close similarities to {{the name of the game}} Carmageddon. It was released initially for PCs in 1999 in Europe and on 31 May 1999 in North America and has since been ported to Dreamcast and PlayStation on 30 November 1999, Game Boy Color on 19 January 2000, and Nintendo 64 on 30 March 2000. The Nintendo 64 version is one of the first Nintendo 64 games to feature a terrain editor and generator. A Macintosh version was being developed by MacSoft, but it has since been cancelled. Worms Armageddon was produced by Martyn Brown and composed by Bjørn Lynne, Karl Morton was the game's lead programmer, and Dan Cartwright was the game's lead artist.|$|R
40|$|To date, swimbladder lesions due to Anguillicola crassus {{infection}} of the European eel Anguilla anguilla have so far been studied only by conventional X-ray methods. This is the first study to report the use of computerised tomography (CT) for studying lesions induced by anguillicolosis. Of 50 eels caught by electrofishery from Lake Balaton, Hungary, in autumn 2002 and pre-selected by a conventional X-ray method, 22 specimens were examined with a Siemens Somatom Plus S 40 spiral CT scanner. Tomograms, radiographs and photographs of 5 of these, showing anguillicolosis-induced swimbladder lesions of varying severity, are presented. Computerised tomograms provide information on the inner structure, air content and wall thickness of the swimbladder {{as well as on}} the number of worms it contains. When the swimbladder is not severely affected or not completely filled with worms, computerised tomography provides adequate data on the shape of the swimbladder, thickness of the swimbladder wall and the location of worms in the lumen. However, in more severe cases, i. e. when the swimbladder is tightly <b>packed</b> with <b>worms</b> or contains no air as a result of wallthickening, this method fails to determine the number and location of helminths or the thickness of the swimbladder wall...|$|R
50|$|Worms Revolution is a 2D {{artillery}} turn-based tactics {{video game}} developed by Team17 and {{is part of}} the Worms series. It was released on PlayStation 3, Windows via Steam and Xbox 360 in October 2012. An OS X version was released on June 6, 2013. A PlayStation Vita version including all three previously released downloadable <b>packs</b> and titled <b>Worms</b> Revolution Extreme was released on October 8, 2013. This version of the game was included as part of a promotional bundle alongside the PlayStation TV system. Like previous games in the series, gameplay is 2D and turn-based, but it is rendered with an all-new 3D engine. There are both single player and multiplayer modes with up to four players online or local hotseat. The game was delisted from Xbox Live Arcade on June 2, 2015.|$|R
50|$|The group {{now only}} has three people, Stanley, Captain Jennifer Henle (Tamara Hope) and Isla. They {{know that the}} worms can hear them but can't see them, so they decide to use grenades as distractions to help them reach a tall building, which they {{ascertain}} that the worms couldn't reach them. As the plan seems to fail when they're {{very close to the}} building, they plan to commit suicide using a bomb pack. Then a Black Hawk arrives on time and kills one of the two worms, and the other undermines due to the noise. The group is picked up but as they are about to flee, the last worm lunges out from the ground and tries to grab the chopper. To save the others, Stanley jumps into the worm's mouth and triggers the bomb <b>pack,</b> killing the <b>worm</b> and himself, leaving Henle as the sole survivor of all the soldiers.|$|R
40|$|Background: To {{determine}} {{the range of}} ultrasonographic (US) appearances of Ascaris lumbricoides roundworms in the biliary system, their distribution in the intra- and extrahepatic parts of the system, and associated features. Methods: All cases of biliary ascariasis during a 10 -year period were reviewed. There were 42 cases in which diagnosis was based on established US criteria, and 2 cases diagnosed surgically in which US had been negative. These 44 cases occurred in 36 patients. Results: In the US-diagnosed cases, worms were present in intrahepatic ducts in 32 cases, in the main duct in 37, and in the gallbladder in eight. In six cases, the liver was lifted off the main portal vein by a bundle of worms obliterating the lumen of the main bile duct. <b>Worms</b> <b>packing</b> and dilating intrahepatic ducts produced pseudotumorous appearances in the liver in four cases and bundlelike appearances in three. Worms were also seen in the pancreatic duct in two cases. Stones in intrahepatic ducts were present in 12 patients. Conclusion: Biliary ascariasis should be searched for {{inside and outside the}} liver. The appearances of bundles and boluses are different from those of single worms. Intra- and extrahepatic biliary stones may be present. Articl...|$|R
40|$|Several {{methods can}} be used to control pest infestation, {{especially}} by the use of biological agents that do not contaminate environment. Virus as a biological agent has already been used to control army worm on some plants. Some benefits can be obtained when biological agents are used to control insect infestation. The objectives of these studies were to obtain: a method to produce MsNPV formulation from rice army worm; an effective and efficient method to pack and store Ms NPV formulation as biological agent of rice army worm and an efficient application method of Ms NPV formulation to control rice army worm. These studies were conducted at laboratory and green house in Bogor and rice field in Indramayu and Sukabumi, West Java during the planting season of 2005. The experiment consisted of several parts: production of suspension and Ms NPV formulation from the larvae of ricearmy <b>worm,</b> <b>packing</b> and period storing of MsNPV formulation, observe the effect of Ms NPV formulation on rice army worm in the rice fileds. Results from these studies show that the number of larvae used will effect production of suspension and formulation of MsNPV. The number of larvae used would increase the production of suspension and the value of formulation will also increase. While method of packing, period of time and location of storing showed that time period of 1; 2; and 3 months at different colour of plastic also location of storing refrigerator vs room temperature did not effect on mortality of larvae rice armyworm...|$|R
