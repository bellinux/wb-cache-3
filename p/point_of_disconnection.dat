40|$|This paper {{presents}} MyZone, {{a private}} online social network for relatively small, closely-knit communities. MyZone has three important distinguishing features. First, users keep {{the ownership of}} their data and have complete control over maintaining their privacy. Second, MyZone is free from any possibility of content censorship and is highly resilient to any single <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>disconnection.</b> Finally, MyZone minimizes deployment cost by minimizing its computation, storage and network bandwidth requirements. It incorporates both a P 2 P architecture and a centralized architecture in its design ensuring high availability, security and privacy. A prototype of MyZone was deployed {{over a period of}} 40 days with a membership of more than one hundred users. The paper provides a detailed evaluation of the results obtained from this deployment. Comment: 24 pages, 13 Figures, 1 Table. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv: 1110. 537...|$|E
40|$|The {{break-up}} of {{a liquid}} thread or drop {{under the influence}} of capillary forces {{has been the subject of}} nu-merous theoretical and experimental studies over the past decade, motivated both by industrial applications (e. g. spraying, emulsification, ink-jet printing) and by theoretical interest in topological transitions. Cap-illary break-up and the subsequent recoil are examples of finite-time singularities in which the interfacial curvature becomes infinite at the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>disconnection.</b> The divergence of scales near disconnection allows similarity solutions to be found for the flow close to disconnection for both inviscid (potential) and very viscous (Stokes) flow [1 – 9]. Despite substantial progress, a number of outstanding questions remain unan-swered. This paper discusses some of the relationships between the known solutions and these outstanding questions. The inviscid problem is characterised by the density ratio ∆ of internal to external fluids and the viscous problem by the corresponding viscosity ratio λ. For nonzero ∆ the similarity lengthscales are all τ 2 / 3 and for finite nonzero λ they are all τ, leading to well-understood self-similar behaviour. The cases ∆ = ∞, λ = 0 and λ = ∞ are all special and correspond to singular limits. Time-dependent simulations for large ∆ show overturning instabilities due to a Kelvin–Helmholtz-like mechanism, and the case ∆ = ∞ is the subject of some controversy!

Commonly, the broadband access and enterprise networks involve devices with dynamic NAPT(NAT) and statefull firewalls functionality. Keeping open connection behind such an intermediate device {{is not a}} trivial task. The intermediate device closes the connection without sending any notify to participants. Until proactively detaching the change of connection status, all send packets get lost. Most applications involve deed-peer-detection mechanisms to verify the host availability, thus if the connection is active. The fast detection of connection lost is vital for the application and therefore short constant dead-peer-detection intervals are used. The update interval is a tradeoff between the network resources and fast detection of disconnection. The interval values are currently constant and set based on the general network experience and application requirements. In this paper is suggested a new framework for dynamic optimization of the update intervals in respect of fast disconnection detection and low network resources.

We investigated by radiofrequency ablation the electrophysiological characteristics of the junction of the right atrium (RA) and the SVC and the feasibility <b>of</b> electrical <b>disconnection</b> <b>of</b> the SVC from the RA. Methods and Results—Sixteen patients with paroxysmal AF after pulmonary vein isolation underwent electroanatomic mapping at the RA–SVC junction during sinus rhythm. Mapping showed sharp potentials (SVC potentials) inside the SVC. Activation spread from the earliest SVC potential (breakthrough) {{to the rest of the}} SVC. SVC potentials were found over a large amount of the circumference, suggesting widespread muscle coverage of the SVC. Breakthroughs from the RA to SVC were located anteriorly, laterally, posteriorly, and septally in 3, 4, 10, and 6 patients, respectively. The number of breakthroughs was 1. 40. 5 per patient. Radiofrequency energy was applied with the end <b>point</b> <b>of</b> electrical <b>disconnection.</b> All breakthroughs were eliminated with 3. 11. 7 applications per breakthrough without complications.

Commonly, the broadband access and enterprise networks involve devices with dynamic NAPT(NAT) and statefull firewalls functionality. Keeping open connection behind such an intermediate device is not a trivial task, since the communication participants are not notified for NAPT/Firewall status changes.

40|$|Current {{research}} has focused primarily on prescriptive models of professional development (PD), yet few have focused on teachers’ experiences of mandatory PD. Furthermore, researchers (Adams, 2014; Elmore, 2002; Hargreaves, 2011) have shown numerous <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>disconnection</b> between the prescribed policies for teacher PD and the de facto policies reflected in teachers’ experiences of PD, leaving teachers’ accounts of mandatory PD largely underexplored. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the institution of mandatory PD in New Mexico, exploring the characteristics of mandatory PD and full-time public high school teachers’ perceptions of their PD experiences at one high school and in one school district. In using Institutional Ethnography (IE) as both theory and method, I was able to conceptualize the “institution” of mandatory PD as coordinated and intersecting work processes within a system of social relations focused on compliance. In my institutional ethnographic account of mandatory PD in New Mexico, I used three data sources: 1) institutional texts (n = 13), 2) one-on-one interviews with high school teachers (n = 3) and educational stakeholders (n = 12), and 3) the 2011 - 12 Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS) Teacher Background Questionnaire (n = 3, 440). To generalize districtwide and statewide, I conducted statistical analyses of the SASS data and described: the format, topic, and duration of high school teachers’ participation in PD; high school teachers’ perceptions regarding the usefulness of PD; institutional support high school teachers’ received for PD; and high school teachers’ perceptions of their influence on PD and teacher evaluation school policies. Analyses of interview and institutional text data revealed that the effects of state power, or ruling relations, within the institution of mandatory PD are achieved through moments of text activation that join together teachers and educational stakeholders in diverse, yet coordinated sequences of action. Findings from this study indicate that, at the state level, mandatory PD focuses on external compliance mandates, rather than teachers’ needs and input. This study is part of a growing body of research that provides empirical evidence of K- 12 teachers’ mandatory PD experiences in specific school, district, and state contexts.

40|$|Geographic routing {{protocols}} base their forwarding {{decisions on the}} location of the current device, its neighbors, and the packets destination. Early proposed heuristic greedy routing algorithms might fail even if there is a path from source to destination. In recent years several recovery strategies have been proposed in order to overcome such greedy routing failures. Planar graph traversal was the first of those strategies that does not require packet duplication and memorizing past routing tasks. This article introduces a novel recovery strategy based on the idea of planar graph traversal but performing routing tasks along geographical clusters instead of individual nodes. The planar graph construction method discovered so far needs one-hop neighbor information only, but may produce disconnection even if there is a path from source to destination. However, simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is a good choice from a practical <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view, since <b>disconnection</b> does only concern sparse networks, while in dense network the proposed algorithm competes with existing solutions and even outperforms planar graph routing methods based on one-hop neighbor information.

Disconnection is increasingly welcomed by local authorities to meet social, environmental and safety (from flooding) criteria. Unfortunately, traditional, bolt-on or end-of-pipe solutions tend to result in a degraded and piecemeal infrastructure which is expensive and difficult to manage or improve. Further, the limited availability of funding, and the acuteness of flooding problems, means that the more sustainable opportunities provided by watercourses can be readily overlooked. <b>Disconnection</b> <b>of</b> surface water focuses on controlling the water at source thereby providing a rationale for integrated use of land for water storage and other uses.
