50|$|One {{disadvantage}} of PSM {{is that it}} only accounts for observed (and observable) covariates. Factors that affect assignment to treatment and outcome but that cannot be observed cannot be accounted for in the matching procedure. As the procedure only controls for observed variables, any hidden bias due to latent variables may remain after matching. Another issue is that <b>PSM</b> requires large <b>samples,</b> with substantial overlap between treatment and control groups.|$|R
40|$|The {{segmental}} {{pattern of}} the spine is established early in development, when the vertebral precursors, the somites, are rhythmically produced from the presomitic mesoderm. Microarray studies of the mouse presomitic mesoderm transcriptome reveal that the oscillator associated with this process, the segmentation clock, drives the periodic expression of a large network of cyclic genes involved in cell signaling. Mutually exclusive activation of the notch–fibroblast growth factor and Wnt pathways during each cycle suggests that coordinated regulation of these three pathways underlies the clock oscillator. The segmentation clock drives the expres-sion of a very limited number of geneswhose mRNA shows a dynamic expres-sion sequence that is repeated in the presomitic mesoderm (PSM) each time a new somite forms (1). Most of the known cyclic genes are com-ponents of the notch pathway oscillating in phase with each other. In chick and mouse, they include genes coding for transcription factors of the hairy and enhancer of split (Hes) family and the lunatic fringe (Lfng) glycosyltransferase (1). Additionally, in mouse, a single component of the Wnt pathway, Axin 2, oscillates out of phase with the notch pathway cyclic genes (2). We have used gene expression arrays sys-tematically to explore the cyclic transcription program associated with the segmentation clock in the mouse PSM. During the formation of each somite, Lfng is expressed in the PSM as a wave that sweeps across the tissue in a posterior-to-anterior direction (1). Therefore, by visually comparing the anteroposterior position of the Lfng expression stripes in the PSM in stained embryos, {{it is possible to}} define an approximate chronological order of the embryos along the segmentation clock oscillation cycle (3, 4). We collected <b>PSM</b> <b>samples</b> from 40 mouse embryos ranging from 19 to 23 somites and used their Lfng expression patterns as a proxy to select 17 samples covering an entire oscillation cycle (fig. S 1 and Figs. 1 and 2, A and B). Probes were produced from RNA extracted from the dis-sected PSMs by using a two-step amplification protocol and were hybridized to Affymetri...|$|R
30|$|In this paper, we empirically {{explore the}} impact of {{returnee}} managers on CSR based on manually collected managerial background data over the period of 2010 to 2014. We find that these returnee managers have a positive association with CSR. We have {{conducted a series of}} robustness checks including propensity score matching (<b>PSM),</b> Heckman two-stage <b>sample</b> selection, alternative measure of CSR, and alternative definition of returnee managers and find that the results are robust. Further analyses show that this association is more pronounced if managers have foreign study experience compared with foreign career work experience. In addition, when firms face greater information asymmetry, returnee managers are more willing to use CSR as a tool to convey a positive image to outsiders. Further tests show that CSR can help managers reduce information asymmetry and improve firm value.|$|R
40|$|Media {{has been}} {{becoming}} increasingly diversified {{and public service}} broadcasters (PSBs) {{all over the world}} face new challenges by the Internet, and they have been restructuring their consistencies for the new environments. PSBs have been developing various management approaches by the diversification of transmission channels and the development of cross-media contents. The optimum deployment of distribution channels and content genres is currently becoming the top management priority, which is referred to as Portfolio Management. This approach for determining the portfolio of products and businesses will result in the most efficient strategic allocation of management resources. This paper thus takes NHK (Nippon Hoso Kyokai), Japan's PSB, as a research target, and analyzes its portfolio management. NHK has introduced the VFM (Value for Money) index through the measurement of WTP(Willingness to pay), and has initiated channel 7 genre matrix management. This study thus aims to estimate WTP to the channel 7 genre matrixin order to analyze how viewers evaluate NHK and its programs. To evaluate whether NHK's channel 7 genre matrix management is oriented to the way as pay-TV or to public service value, PSM (Propensity Score Matching) is employed. Using <b>PSM,</b> the <b>sample</b> population is divided into two groups, the consumer's view and the citizen's view, and how the distributed WTP to genre is different between two groups is examined...|$|R
40|$|The {{article of}} record as {{published}} {{may be found}} at: [URL] solvent-free processing methods to disperse multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) in bisphenol F-based epoxy resin were investigated, {{including the use of}} a microfluidizer (MF), planetary shear mixer (PSM), ultrasonication (US) and combinations. The processed mixture was cured with diethyl toluene diamine. Three complimentary techniques were used to characterize the dispersion of the MWCNTs in cured composite samples: optical microscopy, micro Raman spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). For <b>sample</b> MF þ <b>PSM,</b> optical micrographs and Raman images showed reduced agglomeration and a homogeneous distribution of MWCNTs in the epoxy matrix. SEM analysis of fractured specimen after tensile testing revealed breakage of nanotubes along the fracture surface of the composite. A comparison of the MWCNT dispersion in the epoxy samples processed using different methods showed that a combination of MF and PSM processing yields a more homogeneous <b>sample</b> than the <b>PSM</b> or US þ <b>PSM</b> processed <b>samples.</b> Mechanical testing of the composites showed about 15 % improvement in the tensile strength of samples processed by the MF þ PSM method over other methods. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) results showed a small decrease in the onset degradation temperature for poorly dispersed <b>samples</b> produced by <b>PSM</b> compared with the well-mixed <b>samples</b> (MF þ <b>PSM).</b> These results strongly suggest that the MF þ PSM processing method yield better-dispersed and stronger MWCNT/epoxy composites...|$|R
30|$|We {{sought to}} check that our {{estimates}} of the incidence of overeducation and overskilling were not affected by selection bias, i.e. {{the possibility that the}} observable characteristics of migrants were not distributed in a non-random fashion with respect to mismatch. Failure to account for such influences can result in naive probit models, such as those presented in Tables  2 – 5, generating biased estimates. Within the existing literature linking mismatch with migrant status, the issue of selection has been largely ignored. We consequently estimate the likelihood of mismatch among migrants relative to natives with similar observable characteristics, and thus similar probabilities of mismatch, using propensity score matching (<b>PSM).</b> Due to <b>sample</b> size problems, it was only possible to assess the robustness of the overall migrant coefficients for males and females as any further disaggregation, according to either date of arrival or country of origin, was not feasible.|$|R
40|$|Phase shift {{modulation}} (PSM) is {{a commonly}} used technique for controlling the active power flow in resonant dc-ac and dc-dc converters. Although traditionally developed as an analog modulation scheme, digital PSM is being increasingly {{used in conjunction}} with advanced multi-variable digital controllers and online efficiency optimization algorithms. While analog PSM is known not to introduce additional dynamics from a small-signal standpoint, the analysis disclosed in this work indicates that discrete-time, or uniformly <b>sampled,</b> <b>PSM</b> introduces a transport delay of small-signal nature. Furthermore, and in close analogy with the theory of uniformly sampled pulse width modulators, such delay depends on the modulator carrier type {{as well as on the}} converter operating point. The paper first clarifies the modeling procedure for describing the small-signal dynamics of uniformly sampled phase shift modulators. Secondly, it provides an extension of traditional phasor modeling to digital phase-controlled converters, allowing to account for the additional modulator dynamics in the design of the closed-loop compensation. Theoretical findings are validated via simulation and experimental results...|$|R

In the field of forest tree breeding the measurements would be performed from increment core samples collected from standing trees. In this study we have assessed the potential of Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) for evaluating the content of stilbenes (STB) pinosylvin (PS) and its monomethyl ether (<b>PSM)</b> from heartwood <b>samples</b> of Scots pine, Pinus sylvestris L. Gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) {{was used as a}} reference method. Increment core samples originating from a Scots pine progeny trial were divided into calibration and validation sets. Predictive models were developed for the calibration set using partial least-square regression. Prediction accuracy of the models was evaluated using the validation set. The best model was characterized by a R² of 0. 87 for the validation set, demonstrating the usefulness of NIRS for evaluating the content of stilbenes. Also a technology based on UV-fluorescence of stilbenes will be briefly discussed...|$|R

This {{study is}} a {{benchmarking}} exercise aimed at identifying the variation in the practice - within the South African process industry - of three process safety management (PSM) elements, namely: Management of Change (MOC), Emergency Preparedness Program (EPP), and Process Safety Incident Investigation (PSII) programs. Structured questionnaires were developed {{for each of the}} three PSM elements, and sent to over 180 process plants. Typically, the study experienced a low response rate. However, data were gathered from a total of 39 process facilities which include chemical, pharmaceutical, gas, petrochemical, metal extraction, and processing plants. Observed, is a wide variance in the practice of the PSM elements among the industry. Juxtaposed against international standards, the industry practice is some degrees lower than international benchmarks. Nonetheless, there is a positive attitude to <b>PSM</b> among the <b>sampled</b> facilities. Recommendations were made for the industry stakeholders. Master...|$|R
40|$|Environmental {{management}} standards (EMS) {{are important}} voluntary management tools that aim at reducing {{the environmental impact}} of firms’ activities. From ethical motivations through increasingly high pressure from regulatory authorities to expected financial returns, reasons to adopt an EMS are manifold. While they all certainly matter, it is still unclear from the literature which firm-specific organisational capabilities and structural characteristics significantly drive adoption. Using Propensity Score Matching (<b>PSM)</b> on two <b>samples</b> of French firms, we identify firm-specific factors associated with the early or late adoption of ISO 14001 -type EMS and we test whether adoption increases labour productivity. We find that adopters are moderately large manufacturing firms that rely on ISO 9001 standards or Total Quality Management. In addition, according to the first sample, early adopters tend to be more technologically complex firms that are active in the European market. These differences are attenuated in the second sample, which may be biased towards more innovative firms. Both samples however concur with the conclusion that, whether early or late, adoption is associated with a higher labour productivity compared to non-adoption. This result still holds when we use fully interacted linear models instead of PSM, and seems to be consistent over time. Thus, implementing EMS might provide win–win opportunities to adopters, without giving any premium to “early birds”...|$|R
40|$|Microfinance is the {{provision}} of small amount of loans {{to those who have}} low income and could not have the access to credit from the formal banks. The study was conducted aiming to assess impact of programs in terms of poverty reduction, women`s empowerment, timely repayment and the livelihood of borrowers of Dedebit Credit and Saving Institution(DECSI), using primary data which has been collected through structured questionnaire in the study area. Data used for this study were collected as part of the MU-IUC collaboration program between Mekelle University and Flemish Universities. A sample of 183 borrowers was selected randomly for the study. From the total sample respondents 71. 58 % are female and the rest 28. 42 % are male. Moreover, 108 are female headed households and the remaining 51 are male headed households. Therefore, from the sample clients female headed households are larger than male headed clients. Only clients who took at least two group loans are included in the study as members of the treated group. The control group, on the other hand, was made up of DECSI’s clients who took only one loan. It was found out in the study that, on average, female headed borrowers took significantly lesser amount of loan than their male counterparts. Members of the treated group in the sample enjoyed loan frequency ranging from 2 - 14 and {{it was found that the}} amount of loan they borrow (loan size) increased from time to time. With regard to average profit the amount of profit on average obtained by male household headed borrowers is higher than their female household headed counterparts in x all the three loan periods (Current Loan period, Previous Loan period, and Before Previous Loan period). To measure the impact of microfinance on the living condition of clients we use the Propensity Score Matching (<b>PSM).</b> Quasi-experimental <b>samples</b> which contain participants and non-participants have been used. We use household consumption expenditure as impact indicator. The analytical findings indicate that microfinance loans of DECSI have improved the clients` wellbeing in their living standard. There is a significance difference between treated and control groups in terms of food and non-food expenditure which includes expenditure on personal care, durables and jewelry. The income of the clients has increases due to the fact that beyond their food consumption they possess durable goods like household furniture and jewelry such as gold and silver. However, we did not find significant difference between program participants and non-participants for total expenditure on education, utilities and other expenses like social contributions except that in only one method is significant. The increment of income is not only at household level but also total per capita of individual household members...|$|R
40|$|This Thesis {{investigates the}} recent {{regulatory}} reforms {{applied to the}} credit ratings industry in Europe and the US. It analyses the impact on credit rating agencies (CRAs) and financial markets. The prior literature on CRA regulation {{is focused on the}} US markets and is limited to investigations of competition between CRAs. The impact of recently implemented regulations for CRAs in Europe has received very little academic attention and presents a highly topical research avenue. This Thesis makes several novel contributions to the literature, including (i) critical perspectives on the new regulation, especially in the EU; (ii) the impact of the solicitation status of sovereign ratings upon bank ratings; and (iii) whether European Securities Markets Authority (ESMA) rating identifiers affect the quality of ratings. Several methodologies are applied to enhance the robustness of the findings, including ordered probit analyses, fixed effects models, covariate matching (CVM) and propensity score matching (<b>PSM).</b> An extensive <b>sample</b> of rating actions by the largest CRAs (Fitch, Moody’s and S&P) during 2006 to 2014 is utilised. The critical review of the EU’s CRA regulation sheds light on several shortcomings and raises a need for reassessment. Some assumptions presented by the European Commission (EC) lack underlying evidence and are subjective in nature. Disclosures by CRAs have been inconsistent, which may reflect ambiguity in the regulations. Compliance with new regulation has affected the CRAs’ operating costs, which confirms earlier fears expressed by CRAs. Additional evidence is presented relating to CRAs’ business models. The second empirical chapter identifies that changes to the solicitation status of sovereigns induced by new disclosure rules have an adverse effect on banks domiciled in these countries. This has policy implications for regulators and banks since the ceiling effect identified in the study can lead to higher costs and harm the intermediaries. In the final empirical chapter, ESMA’s requirement for rating identifiers is questioned since it does not have any discernible impact on the quality of ratings reported by CRAs. This finding is of interest to policymakers, market participants and academics since the quality of ratings is linked to banking regulation and affects financial stability...|$|R
