In our method each pair of images is treated independently and can therefore use a different pair of parallel planes not necessarily visible in the other views. While, for each pair of images, constraints on the singular values of the essential matrix provide two algebraic constraints on the intrinsic parameters, those we derive from <b>plane</b> <b>parallelism</b> {{have the advantage of}} providing two additional ones making the calibration of a no-skew camera possible from two images only...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{shows that}} by {{imposing}} the parallelism constraint between the measured plane and the reference plane, {{the position of}} the current plane is not univocal specified and is impossible to specify the way to attain the parallelism errors imposed by accuracy constrains. The parameters involved in the calculus of plane to <b>plane</b> <b>parallelism</b> error can be used to set univocal the relative position between the two planes...|$|E
40|$|The {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) metric {{reconstruction of}} a scene from two-dimensional images is a fundamental problem in Computer Vision. The major bottleneck {{in the process of}} retrieving such structure lies in the task of recovering the camera parameters. These parameters can be calculated either through a pattern-based calibration procedure, which requires an accurate knowledge of the scene, or using a more flexible approach, known as camera autocalibration, which exploits point correspondences across images. While pattern-based calibration requires the presence of a calibration object, autocalibration constraints are often cast into nonlinear optimization problems which are often sensitive to both image noise and initialization. In addition, autocalibration fails for some particular motions of the camera. To overcome these problems, we propose to combine scene and autocalibration constraints and address in this thesis (a) the problem of extracting geometric information of the scene from uncalibrated images, (b) the problem of obtaining a robust estimate of the affine calibration of the camera, and (c) the problem of upgrading and refining the affine calibration into a metric one. In particular, we propose a method for identifying the major planar structures in a scene from images and another method to recognize parallel pairs of planes whenever these are available. The identified parallel planes are then used to obtain a robust estimate of both the affine and metric 3 D structure of the scene without resorting to the traditional error prone calculation of vanishing points. We also propose a refinement method which, unlike existing ones, is capable of simultaneously incorporating <b>plane</b> <b>parallelism</b> and perpendicularity constraints in the autocalibration process. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed methods are robust to image noise and provide satisfactory results...|$|E

Similarities preserve angles {{but do not}} necessarily preserve orientation, direct similitudes preserve orientation and opposite similitudes change it.|$|R
40|$|Three {{apparently}} {{distinct and}} different approaches {{have been proposed}} {{to account for the}} crystallographic features of diffusion-controlled precipitation. These three models are based on (a) an invariant line in the habit <b>plane,</b> (b) the <b>parallelism</b> of a pair of Deltags that are perpendicular to the habit plane and (c) the parallelism of a pair of Moire fringes that are in turn parallel to the habit plane. The purpose of the present paper is to show that these approaches are in fact absolutely equivalent and that when certain conditions are satisfied they are essentially the same as the recent edge-to-edge matching model put forward by the authors.

6000|$|From {{the use of}} the gnomon there {{naturally}} grew up {{the conception}} of angular measurements; and with the advance of geometrical conceptions there came the hemisphere of Berosus, the equinoctial armil, the solstitial armil, and the quadrant of Ptolemy--all of them employing shadows as indices of the sun's position, but in combination with angular divisions. It is obviously out of the question for us here to trace these details of progress. It must suffice to remark that in all of them we may see that notion of equality of relations of a more complex kind, which is best illustrated in the astrolabe, an instrument which consisted [...] "of circular rims, movable one within the other, or about poles, and contained circles which were to be brought into the position of the ecliptic, and of a plane passing through the sun and the poles of the ecliptic"--an instrument, therefore, which represented, as by a model, the relative positions of certain imaginary lines and planes in the heavens; which was adjusted by putting these representative lines and <b>planes</b> into <b>parallelism</b> and coincidence with the celestial ones; and which depended for its use upon the perception that the relations between these representative lines and planes were equal to the relations between those represented.|$|R
40|$|A magmatic {{origin of}} a {{differentiated}} Precambrian granitic pluton, consisting of quartz diorite, granodiorite, and quartz monzonite, {{is consistent with}} the results of petrographic and structural studies. Petrographic modal analyses and accurate plagioclase determinations by the Rittman Zone Method and X-ray diffraction revealed: (1) a general decrease in anorthite content of the plagioclase and in the amounts of plagioclase, hornblende,and biotite; (2) an increase in the percentage of K feldspar; and (3) no consistent variation in the proportion of quartz towards the core of the pluton. Textures and microstructures show that early-formed minerals underwent cataclasis and plagioclase was replaced by K feldspar. Potassium and calcium-sodium autometasomatism are believed to account for the replacement of plagioclase by K feldspar and the formation of myrmekite. The interpretation is made on the basis that alkalies were concentrated and transported in water which was left over from magmatic crystallization. A statistical analysis of linear fabrics, associated with the anticline occupied by the granitic pluton, shows that "b" lineations consist of elongate hornblende crystals and "a" lineations are composed of Streaks of quartz and feldspar along foliation <b>planes.</b> The <b>parallelism</b> of foliations and lineations in the pluton and surrounding metasedimentary rocks indicates that the pluton was introduced during folding which accompanied regional metamorphism. Magmatic introduction of concordant bodies of diabase followed complete crystallization of the granitic pluton...|$|R
40|$|Two novel transforms, related {{together}} and called Sine and Cosine Fresnel Transforms, {{as well as}} their optical implementation are presented. Each transform combines both backward and forward light propagation in the framework of the scalar diffraction approximation. It has been proven that the Fresnel transform is the optical version of the fractional Fourier transform. Therefore the former has the same properties as the latter. While showing properties {{similar to those of the}} Fresnel transform and therefore of the fractional Fourier transform, each of the Sine and Cosine Fresnel transforms provides a real result for a real input distribution. This enables saving half of the quantity of information in the complex <b>plane.</b> Because of <b>parallelism,</b> optics offers high speed processing of digital signals. Speech signals should be first represented by images through special light modulators for example. The Sine and Cosine Fresnel transforms may be regarded respectively as the fractional Sine and Cosine transforms which are more general than the Cosine transform used in information processing and compression. ...|$|R
40|$|Natural head {{position}} (NHP) is the usual, balanced {{position of the}} head which is adopted for viewing the horizon or an object at eye level. Determination of NHP is useful when reconstructing facial form in art, forensics, orthodontic diagnosis and treatment planning for surgical management of craniofacial dysmorphic conditions. When NHP is uncertain, correction such as orientation to Frankfurt horizontal (FH) has been advocated. However, FH angulation varies between individuals and is subject to landmark identification error. Previous studies have measured FH and other craniofacial planes {{in relation to the}} true horizontal (HOR) with subjects in NHP and have found similar variation to that found with FH. This study measured craniofacial planes in 40 Aboriginal Australians (20 male, 20 female, aged 17 years or greater) from lateral cephalographs and compared its results with classical previous studies. Four planes, the neutral horizontal axis (NHA), FH, Krogman-Walker line (KW line), and palatal plane (P <b>plane)</b> demonstrated near <b>parallelism</b> and averaged between - 1 degrees and - 2 degrees from HOR. The combined use of NHA, FH, KW line, and P plane enables more effective corrected {{head position}} (CHP). Andrew L. Barbera, Wayne J. Sampson, Grant C. Townsen...|$|R
40|$|The {{interaction}} of {{man with his}} environment rests in a linear relationship of representation, form making, and dialectic. As referenced through the theory of painting, pictorial form is created {{through the use of}} point and line to <b>plane.</b> An inherent <b>parallelism</b> is established between the act of creating form on a surface and man?s act of creating landscape. As humans we create the landscape through the body from eye to mind to hand. The idea of the point is expressed as the physical form of man in relation {{to the surface of the}} earth. Man interacts with his environment through the activation of that point into linear form. The intersections of linear form created makes visible the language of man?s relationship with his environment by creating, framing, and forming the horizontal plane of the landscape. The exploration into this process of making the landscape exposes man?s perception of his environment in a manner that begins a personal dialogue between the landscape and me. Using this exploration I begin a personal grounding of the landscape with my hometown of Altoona, Pennsylvania. Formalizing the relationship I have had to the landscape I was born into establishes a framework for continual intrigue into the making of the landscape...|$|R
40|$|Background: Historically, many {{reference}} {{lines and}} planes {{of the human}} skull {{have been used in}} an attempt to depict the head in a natural head position (NHP) which is a relaxed/balanced position when looking ahead at their eye level. Head position correction has been attempted in fields such as anatomy, art, anthropology, orthodontics, oral and maxillofacial surgery, plastic surgery, and forensics. In orthodontics, oral and maxillofacial surgery, and plastic surgery, corrected head position (CHP) is particularly important for diagnosis of the normality/protrusion/retrusion of the patient‚Äôs facial skeleton. Usually a single plane, such as Frankfurt horizontal, is used to correct head position, but its angulation is variable between individuals, because each individual‚Äôs anatomy is unique. It has been found previously that the Neutral Horizontal Axis (NHA), Frankfurt horizontal (FH), Krogman-Walker plane (KW plane), and Palatal plane (P <b>plane)</b> demonstrated near <b>parallelism,</b> and these <b>planes</b> averaged - 1 to - 2 degrees from the true horizontal (HOR, which is a horizontal plane determined as being perpendicular to the earth‚Äôs gravitational force) with subjects in NHP. Methods: Craniofacial planes were measured in an Aboriginal Australian sample and in two contemporary samples obtained from Australian orthodontic practices, and the findings were compared with previous studies. Each sample consisted of 40 individuals (20 males and 20 females) with subjects in NHP. The Aboriginal Australian sample was longitudinal (T 1, mean age 10 years; T 2, mean age 14 years, and T 3, mean age 18 years) enabling NHP to be assessed over approximately 8 years. A soft tissue Ear - nose plane (EN plane) was also investigated. Results: NHP reproducibility over 8 years demonstrated a mean of absolute difference of 2. 9 degrees, with a range of differences from - 7. 9 to 8. 2 degrees and a standard deviation of differences equal to 3. 6 degrees. The Neutral Horizontal Axis (NHA), Frankfurt horizontal (FH), Krogman-Walker plane (KW plane), and Palatal plane (P <b>plane)</b> demonstrated near <b>parallelism</b> with each other, and averaged between 0 and - 3 degrees from HOR. On average, EN plane was horizontal but was variable. Conclusions: NHP is not consistently reproducible at the individual level. For hard tissue images, the combined use of NHA, FH, KW plane, and P plane enables prediction of CHP. Additionally, the rectangular shape of the lower orbit - nasal airway region appears to be useful for correcting head position. In facial soft tissue images, EN plane in combination with other visual factors helps to correct head position. Simple geometry enables this head position correction to be performed from any view of the head where relevant landmarks are seen. Thesis (D. Clin. Dent.)

40|$|Volume {{holographic}} {{data storage}} uses the superposition of image holograms in a suitable medium to pursue large storage capacity and high readout rates. The holographic method of structuring the medium with data, and subsequent readout of those data structures, relies on an optical system with two distinct paths. The object path is typically a 4 F system relaying a high space-bandwidth-product object to an image plane with the storage medium placed near the Fourier <b>plane.</b> Optical system <b>parallelism,</b> measured by space-bandwidth-produce, promotes both storage capacity and readout rate. The reference path is typically a relay with the field stop placed {{near the center of}} the storage material. We will consider how the properties of the object path optical system affect the storage capacity and readout rate. We will demonstrate that the object beam 4 F system can be optimized for the particular requirements of volume holographic storage, and that relatively simple optical systems can provide high parallelism. We will also consider the optical parallelism possible for standard optical disk storage, and how these results compare to volume holographic storage. Finally, we will consider how the optical system of the reference path affects the storage capacity. We find that modifications to the reference beam, or apodization, can substantially mitigate the effects of interpage crosstalk, a fundamental noise source in volume holographic storage...|$|R
40|$|The author's {{theory of}} the {{broadening}} of the Compton line as a Doppler effect of electron velocities is briefly reviewed and it is pointed out that only the component velocity along a direction which nearly bisects the angle between primary and scattered x-ray beams should be effective in broadening the line. Crystalline Ceylon graphite possesses properties which lend hope {{to the belief that}} a class of weakly bound or structure electrons in this crystal might have momenta restricted uniquely to <b>parallelism</b> with one <b>plane</b> in the crystal: the (0001) plane. A composite scatterer was built up out of blocks consisting of the crystal flakes all orientated with their (0001) <b>planes</b> in mutual <b>parallelism</b> and the blocks in turn were so orientated that the normals to these planes bisected the angle formed by the primary and scattered x-ray beams. If the electron momenta are orientated parallel to the plane of the graphite flakes one should expect the contribution of such electrons to the shifted scattering to give a sharp line or peak superposed on the broader structure caused by the remaining isotropically distributed momenta. Details of the experimental set-up are described and the spectrum obtained from scattering by the Ceylon graphite scatterer is compared with the spectrum from an isotropic Acheson graphite scatterer. The breadth and structure of the shifted line proves to be quite identical in the two cases and the conclusion is drawn that if a class of electrons having selectively orientated momenta exists in the crystal-line graphite it constitutes less than 5 percent of the total number. The bearing of this result on related questions is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Background: Consideration of {{substantial}} case peculiarities requires constant attention, {{as in the}} case system we can observe the processes of active transformation, case forms acquisition of secondary functions. Meanwhile the formal implementation processes for cases are relevant, as modification of formal case expression increases the intercase convergence that is particularly easy to trace throughout the evolution of cases formalization general field and against inflexion narrowing of individual case. Purpose: Establishing the status of non-prepositional Genitive and Accusative in grammatical conception of Yuriy Shevel'ov along with tracing of their load in the inside-sentence structure and clarifying the regularity indices in post-verbal position. Results: Starting analysis of noun governmenability peculiarities from Accusative form as the most common and most powerful in verbal government position, Yuriy Shevel'ov states that such property is regular in the case of his object functions realization under transitive verbs. In object Accusative semantics there was pointed out the resultive, in which Accusative object, repeating the verb root, forms the semantic integrity with it, and constitutes pleonasm in stylistic aspect. In the interpretation of by-verbal directly governed Genitive Yu. Shevel'ov emphasizes that the form of Genitive indicates the action covering only part or subject or in its path to the subject encounters obstacles that becomes a foundation for distinction of partitive Genitive and negative Genitive. To declared two functions Yu. Shevel'ov adds 1) removal Genitive and 2) approaching Genitive that are regular for verbs with corresponding semantics, as well as for verbal lexemes of refusal, subtraction, fear. Discussion: Thorough study of non-prepositional Genitive and Accusative substantial cases in the grammatical conception of Yuriy Shevel'ov showed activation of post-lexeme valence-conventional object Accusative and narrowing of <b>parallelism</b> <b>planes</b> of both forms in post-lexeme appearance. Activation of the semantic opposition of identity among a number of verbal lexemes with possible implementation {{of substantial}} Genitive object brings out the tendency of strengthening of object Accusative functional load. Equally important is leveling of significance of non-prepositional substantial Genitive and replacing it with prepositional substantial Genitive. Meanwhile the relevant tendency is the enhance of syncretism of object and purpose Genitive, where the latter is marked by functional status of individual proposition and correlated with semantically similar and functionally different grammatical structures...|$|R
