40|$|AbstractIn the {{traditional}} <b>process</b> <b>of</b> set <b>operations,</b> the elements <b>of</b> set are usually represented through natural language rather than formalized representation, which affected the efficiency <b>of</b> set <b>operations.</b> In order {{to solve this}} problem and improve the efficiency <b>of</b> set <b>operations,</b> this paper innovatively introduced the binary into the <b>process</b> <b>of</b> set <b>operations,</b> proposed the concept of “set code”, and defined a series <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> rules about “set code”. All the above formed a relatively complete and formal computing system of “set code”. Experimental results show that: the <b>process</b> <b>of</b> set <b>operations</b> can be achieved through 0, 1 operation in the form of “set code”. We also successfully achieved the target <b>of</b> query <b>operation</b> which is very important in the database through the mechanism of “set code”...|$|R

50|$|When Operation Plumbbob {{began in}} 1957 during the Spring, the {{planning}} <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>Operation</b> Hardtack I was well underway {{and the number}} of nuclear detonations planned were more than those in the Plumbbob series. At the same time, radiation and nuclear proliferation concerns around the world had led to formal discussions between the US, USSR, and other countries on the topic of instituting a global ban on nuclear testing as a path to disarmament. In 1957 on August 9 AEC chairman Lewis L. Strauss proposed to President Eisenhower a preliminary plan of Operation Hardtack I. President Eisenhower objected to the length of the four month testing period and that plan called for 25 shots, which was one more than in Plumbbob. As a result of the discussion Eisenhower consented to yields no larger than 15 Megatons, and ordered that the testing period be as brief as possible.|$|E

Historically, CFM has had good relations with the Communist Party of Moldova. In 2009, its employees signed a letter in which they condemned the opposition protests that followed the 2009 parliamentary elections. They described the events as [...] "an attempt to bring chaos into the country and to destroy everything positive that was built by the current government", claimed that [...] "the elections were carried out in conformity with the international norms and national law on elections" [...] and [...] "the victory of the communists is a logical result of their eight-year stay in power", expressed [...] "full support to the elected power", and called for [...] "punishing the responsible". Eventually, after the defeat of the PCRM in the national elections, the management of the enterprise was changed.|$|E

These strengths are characterized by the strong, weak, electromagnetic (fine-structure constant), and gravitational coupling constants. Other leading contributors in the field include H.
