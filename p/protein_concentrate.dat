2500|$|Researchers {{have focused}} on the role of {{melamine}} and related compounds in causing renal failure. Beginning on 19 April, [...] researchers reportedly had ruled out aminopterin contamination and had found a [...] "spoke-like crystal" [...] in contaminated wheat gluten and rice <b>protein</b> <b>concentrate</b> and the tissues and urine of affected animals. (It was previously known that melamine and cyanuric acid can form networks of hydrogen bonds, creating a tile-like planar structure through molecular self-assembly.) The crystal has been said to serve as a biomarker for contamination and is approximately 30% melamine. The remainder has been identified as cyanuric acid, ammelide and ammeline, with crystals recovered from urine reported to be approximately 70% cyanuric acid. While some researchers have theorized the three latter chemicals might have been formed as the animals metabolized the melamine, or as byproducts of bacterial metabolism (cyanuric acid is a known intermediate byproduct of bacterial metabolism of melamine), their presence in the crystals found in contaminated protein itself, combined with media reports of widespread adulteration with both melamine and cyanuric acid in China, has focused research efforts on their combined effects in animals. Neither melamine nor cyanuric acid, a chemical commonly used in pool chlorination, have been thought to be particularly toxic by themselves. The current hypothesis is, although these contaminants are not very toxic individually, their potency appears to be increased when they are present together.|$|E

40|$|Rice bran, a {{good source}} of protein and fat, is at present underutilized as a food material. The {{potential}} of producing rice bran at the global level is 27. 3 million t. The presence of enzyme lipase in rice bran causes rapid deterioration of oil to free fatty acids and glycerol. Various stabilization techniques involving heat treatment, low-temperature storage, chemical treatment, control of relative humidity during storage, and simultaneous milling and extraction were evolved to inactivate lipase. Multiple forms of rice bran lipase have been identified. Fractional classification of proteins reveals a high percentage of albumins and globulins. Proteins can be extracted from full-fat or defatted rice bran by alkaline extraction and acid or heat precipitation. Extraction procedures influence the <b>protein</b> content of <b>concentrates,</b> which ranged from 19. 4 to 76. 1 % in concentrates from full-fat rice bran and 17. 5 to 85. 0 % in concentrates from defatted rice bran.

40|$|Abstract: The {{effects of}} whey <b>protein</b> <b>concentrates</b> on {{physical}} and rheological properties of yogurt were studied. Five commercial whey <b>protein</b> <b>concentrates</b> (340 g kg− 1 protein nominal) {{were used to}} fortify milk to 45 g protein kg− 1. Fermentation was performed with two different starters (ropy and non-ropy). Resulting yogurts were compared with a control yogurt enriched with skim milk powder. The water-holding capacity of the yogurt fortified with skim milk powder was 500 g kg− 1 and ranged from 600 to 638 g kg− 1 when fortified with whey <b>protein</b> <b>concentrates.</b> Significant rheological differences have been noticed between the yogurts fortified with different whey <b>protein</b> <b>concentrates,</b> independent of the starter used. Three whey <b>protein</b> <b>concentrates</b> generated yogurts with a behavior similar to the control.

The yogurts with the lowest firmness and viscosity were produced with concentrates which contained the highest amount of non-protein nitrogen fraction (160 g kg− 1 versus 126 g kg− 1 of the total nitrogen), and the highest amount of denaturation of the whey protein (262 versus 200 g kg− 1 of the total nitrogen) ...|$|R

40|$|Dry milling in {{combination}} with air classification was evaluated {{as an alternative to}} conventional wet extraction of protein from yellow field peas (Pisum sativum). Major advantages of dry fractionation are retention of native functionality of proteins and its lower energy and water use. Peas were ground by impact (ZPS 50) and jet milling (AFG 100) at various classifier wheel speeds to provide pea flours with different particle size distributions, protein contents and damaged starch levels. Peas were milled under various conditions to maximally disentangle starch granules from the surrounding protein bodies. The optimal milling conditions were confirmed by particle size analysis and scanning electron microscope imaging. Too extensive milling, e. g. using ultrafine impact or jet milling, resulted in very fine flours (with D 0. 5 < 10 µm) with poor flowability, whereas ultrafine jet milling led to an increased percentage of damaged starch. Subsequently, air classification was applied to separate small fragments (primarily protein bodies) from the coarse fraction (starch granules) to obtain enriched <b>protein</b> <b>concentrates.</b> <b>Protein</b> <b>concentrates</b> were obtained with protein contents between 51 % and 55 % (w/dw) and a maximum protein recovery of 77 %. Deviating cut-off size for air classification could be ascribed to build-up of material between the vanes of the classifier wheel. Finally, water holding capacity (WHC) tests were used to evaluate the functional properties of the pea <b>protein</b> <b>concentrates.</b> A liquid pea concentrate comprising 26 % (w/w) of protein could be prepared from dry pea concentrates containing more than 30 % (w/dw) of pea protein. This was explained by the high solubility of pea protein in its native state. After heat treatment of pea <b>protein</b> <b>concentrates,</b> a gel with a high WHC of 4. 8 g water (w/w) was obtained, which decreased with increasing protein content.
