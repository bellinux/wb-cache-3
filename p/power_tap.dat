Power-based training had been possible in labs only with special ergometers mounted to stationary bikes until 1988 when Balboa Instruments and several other companies began to develop the technology for [...] "on-the-road" [...] use. Another system, the SRM, actually started the concept of measuring rider output on the road. It was shortly followed by the Power Pacer (Balboa Instruments) and LOOK Max One hubs. The SRM enjoyed greater publicity when it was embraced by international cycling federations, as well as world-famous Tour de France winner Greg LeMond.

40|$|Background: Doxorubicin (DOX), an {{anthracycline}} antibiotic, is {{a widely}} used anticancer agent. In spite of its high antitumor efficacy, the use of DOX in clinical chemotherapy is limited due to diverse toxicities, including gonadotoxicity. Objective: We investigated the protective effect of nano-zinc oxide (nZnO) as an established antioxidant on DOX-induced testicular disorders. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study 24 adult male Wistar rats were divided into four groups including one control and three experimentals (6 rats per group). They received saline (as control), DOX alone (6 mg/kg body weight, i. p.), nZnO alone (5 mg/kg body weight, i. p.), and nZnO followed by DOX. Animals were sacrificed 28 days after treatment and evaluations were made by sperm count and measuring sex hormone levels in plasma. Also total antioxidant <b>power</b> (<b>TAP)</b> and lipid peroxidation (LPO) in plasma were tested. Data was analyzed with SPSS- 14 and one way ANOVA test.

Results: In the DOX-exposed rats significant differences were found compared with the control group (p= 0. 001) in plasma total antioxidant <b>power</b> (<b>TAP)</b> (425. 50 ± 32. 33 vs. 493. 33 ± 18. 54 mmol/mL), Lipid peroxidation (LPO) (3. 70 ± 0. 44 vs. 2. 78 ± 0. 68 μmol/mL), plasma testosterone (3. 38 ± 0. 69 vs. 5. 40 ± 0. 89 ng/dl), LH (0. 26 ± 0. 05 vs. 0. 49 ± 0. 18 mlU/mL), sperm count (157. 98 ± 6. 29 vs. 171. 71 ± 4. 42 × 106 /mL) and DNA damage (11. 51 ± 3. 45 vs. 6. 04 ± 2. 83 %).

Materials and Methods: Male BALB/c mice were randomly divided into 12 groups composing sham, control, and treated groups. Aging was induced by administration of D-galactose (500 mg/kg/day for 6 weeks). A positive control group was assigned that received vitamin E (200 mg/kg/day). The extract of herbs was prepared, lyophilized, and used in this study. The herbs were administered by gavage for 4 weeks to D-galactose-aged animals at the selected doses (mg/kg/day) as follows: Zingiber officinale (250), Glycyrrhiza glabra (150), Rosmarinus officinalis (300), Peganum harmala (50), Aloe vera (150), Satureja hortensis (200), Teucrium scordium (200), Hypericum perforatum (135) and Silybum marianum (150).

Materials and Methods: Levels of leptin, adiponectin, total antioxidant <b>power</b> (<b>TAP),</b> lipid peroxides, and C-reactive protein (CRP) were assessed in 115 diabetics and {{an equal number of}} control respondents. Furthermore, various anthropometric indices and blood pressure were measured using standard methods. Levels of biomarkers were compared between groups based on body mass index or blood pressure classifications. Results: Control respondents exhibited higher (P 0. 05) mean levels of the various biomarkers, except TAP level which was higher (P 0. 05) levels of the other biomarkers between diabetes patients and their control counterpart. Irrespective of diabetes, obesity, or hypertensive status, leptin associated positively with various measures of adiposity. Adiponectin correlated positively with leptin (R > 0. 38; P< 0. 05) only in the control respondents, suggesting a possible functional paradox of the adipocytokines in this group of respondents.

Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into five groups of six animals each. Oral administration of PPE at doses of 100 and 200 mg/kg once a day for 10 days resulted in {{a significant reduction in}} fasting blood glucose and an increase in serum insulin levels, in comparison with diabetic control group. It also prevented diabetes-induced loss in body weight. Hepatic TAP increased and TBARS decreased following PPE treatments. The extract at 100 and 200 mg/kg increased the activity of hepatic SOD, CAT, and GPx in diabetic rats. It is concluded that PPE has antidiabetic potential that is comparable with glibenclamide. In conclusion, {{the results of the present}} study show positive effects of P. persica on experimental diabetes and thus the antidiabetic effect of PPE is related to its potential to inhibit hepatocellular oxidative stress...|$|E

Objectives: Design of the methodics {{for creating}} model cycling rides in the training of the cycling part of the triathlon for an intermittent method with short distances using the power meter. Method: The pilot study focuses on the methodics for creating model cycling rides in the cycling part of the triathlon and their evaluation. Firstly, we perform rides to determine the critical power levels. Based on the critical power we derive the intensity of model rides for the training method of short intermittent distances Intensity II and III. By evaluating the results we gain an insight into the questions of creating the model rides. All field rides are performed by a single person.
