40|$|The aim {{of study}} {{is to improve the}} {{consistency}} of fuzzy complementary judgment matrices. Group decision making problems with different forms of <b>p</b> <b>reference</b> information are discussed. Firstly, four forms of <b>p</b> <b>reference</b> information (i. e., preference ordering, utility value, AHP judgment matrix and fuzzy judgment matrix) are introduced and the computing formulas are given to uniform different forms of preference information into the form of fuzzy judgment matrix. Then, the paper discusses the method of testing the complete consistency of the fuzzy complementary judgment matrices. On the basis of some theories, a new algorithm is proposed to improve the fuzzy complementary judgment matrices consistency. And then the paper analyzes the feasibility of the algorithm theoretically. The algorithm is not only simple and effective, but also can provides a new idea for the research on attributes sorting or some references for expert s to modify the original judgment matrix...|$|E

The authors synthesise international monetary theory with the Samuelson-Black-Scholes insight that assets prices follow diffusion processes, and obtain a system of stochastic differential equations to model exchange rate dynamics {{under the influence of}} purchasing power parity. An exact formula to price foreign currency options is obtained, which incorporates the influence of its purchasing power parity. The book is essential to advanced undergraduate and graduate students who wish to learn about the modern theory of foreign exchange options.

This paper shows that node coverage {{is an important}} metric for query performance in random graph based P 2 P networks.

We evaluate these two models in terms of various performance metrics against simulation results.

Reference evapotranspiration was estimated by the Penman-Monteith method. Precipitation and temperature data were statistically downscaled and evaluated using the DOE/NCAR PCM global circulation model projections for the B 1 (low), A 2 (mid-high) and A 1 fi (high) emission scenarios of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report on Emission Scenarios. Relative crop yield reduction was estimated from a water stress factor, which is a function of soil moisture content. Average soil moisture content for the three locations was determined by means of a simple water balance approach. Results from the analysis indicate that the rainy season will become wetter and the dry season will become drier.

Observations: When we compare this with our earlier presentation at PEDICON 2011, we found that hypertension (HTN) (22. 9 % vs. 23. 07 %) is not significantly different but pre-HTN (28. 09 % vs. 33. 9 %), pre-diabetes mellitus (pre-DM) (3. 7 % vs. 64. 3 %), and diabetes mellitus (DM) (0. 35 % vs. 3. 8 %) are significantly high in this study.

At this low beam energy this may be a result of the interplay between initial-state Cronin effects, final-state flow, and energy loss in medium. The v(2) of electrons from heavy-flavor decays is nonzero when averaged between 1. 3 < p(T) (e) < 2. 5 GeV/c for 0 %- 40 % centrality collisions at root(NN) -N-S = 62. 4 GeV. For 20 %- 40 % centrality collisions, the v(2) at root(NN) -N-S = 62. 4 GeV is smaller than that for heavy-flavor decays at root(NN) -N-S = 200 GeV. The v 2 of the electrons from heavy-flavor decay at the lower beam energy is also smaller than v(2) for pions. Both results indicate that the heavy quarks interact with the medium formed in these collisions, but they may not be at the same level of thermalization with the medium as observed at root(NN) -N-S = 200 GeV...|$|E

The influence of incubation time on MIC values, {{and the performance of}} a spectrophotometric method for MIC determination in comparison with the visual reference method, were also evaluated. Amphotericin B was active against most of the isolates. All the isolates were highly resistant to 5 -fluorocytosine (MICs > 256 mg/L). Voriconazole was significantly less active than the other drugs with an overall MIC(90) (MIC at which 90 % of the isolates were inhibited) of 32 mg/L. In contrast, posaconazole showed good activity (MIC(90) 1 mg/L). A wide range of MICs, from 0. 03 to > or = 32 mg/L, was obtained for itraconazole and terbinafine. Differences in susceptibility between and within genera were noted. Rhizopus spp. were significantly less susceptible to itraconazole, posaconazole, terbinafine and amphotericin B than Absidia spp., and less susceptible than Mucor spp. to amphotericin B. Terbinafine appeared to be more active against Rhizopus microsporus than against Rhizopus oryzae (geometric mean MIC of 0. 15 and 64 mg/L, respectively). The activity of the drugs was dependent on the incubation period. A significant increase in MICs was noted between 24 and 48 h of incubation. On the other hand, the two methods used for MIC determination (visual and spectrophotometric readings) showed good agreement. These results suggest that the zygomycetes are a heterogeneous group for antifungal susceptibility. Some of the conventional and new antifungals are effective in vitro; their efficacies in vivo remain to be determined. The spectrophotometric method appears to be a valuable alternative to the visual method for MIC determination for zygomycetes...|$|E

40|$|The optical {{constants}} of erbium (Er) {{films were}} {{obtained in the}} 3 : 25 - 1580 eV range from transmittance measurements performed at room temperature. Thin films of Er were deposited by evaporation in ultra high vacuum conditions and their transmittance was measured in situ. Substrates consisted of a thin C film supported on a grid. Transmittance measurements were used to obtain the extinction coefficient k of the Er films. The refractive index n of Er was calculated using the Kramers-Krönig analysis. k data were extrapolated both on the high- and low-energy parts of the spectrum by using experimental data and calculated k values available in the literature. Er, similar to other lanthanides, has a low-absorption band below the O 2, 3 edge onset; the smallest absorption was measured at ~ 22 : 5 eV. Therefore, Er {{is a promising material}} for filters and multilayer coatings in the energy range below the O 2, 3 edge, in which materials typically have an absorption stronger than at other energies. Good consistency of the data resulted from the application of f and inertial sum rules. © 2011 Optical Society of America.

The window, here, has been the reason to make incisions in the architectural body {{and has to be}} understood as both a ventilation device and as an instrument to look and see. The article explains how critical sequential drawing (CSD) consists of the elaborated combination of the following drawing techniques: Chronological Drawing, X-Ray-Drawing and annotated drawing can be applied in order to anatomise and hence investigate the material and spatial conditions of the masses and voids of the fortifications of Cambrai. For Studio Anatomy drawing is also a way of questioning the architectural construction and its mediation. It is an exploratory journey into depths of unveiling perspectives of the architectural drawing and the craftsmanship of the architect beyond today.

40|$|Visible-Near Infrared (VNIR) {{spectroscopy}} provides rapid, low cost, non-destructive and simultaneous {{measurements of}} several constituents {{from a single}} scan. The method has recently gained attention {{as an alternative to}} conventional soil analytical techniques in soil quality assessment. However, most of the research has focused on spectral measurement after sample preprocessing in the laboratory. This study was conducted in Ethiopia in collaboration with Ethiopian Agricultural Transformation Agency (ATA). In this study, 112 soil samples were scanned in the field and the result was compared with scans made in the laboratory on pre-processed samples. All samples were collected from a geographical area of 10 km x 10 Km block. Partial Least Square (PLS) regression was used to determine the best re-gression model between laboratory reference data and spectral data for both field and laboratory measurements. The result demonstrated that VNIR spectroscopy can predict soil chemical and physical properties both in the field and under laboratory conditions but that the predictions are slightly better for soil particle size distribution (texture) and few chemical properties in the field than in laboratory. This could be either due to the number of scans per sample performed or co-variation of soil physiochemi-cal properties with soil moisture. Fraction of organic carbon (FOC), CEC, Ca, pH, Co and %clay particle size were all predicted with better accuracy (Residual Prediction Deviation (RPD) ≥ 2 and R 2 > 0. 7) for both field and laboratory measurements.
