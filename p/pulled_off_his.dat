5|$|Following the {{conclusion}} of his title match against JBL at the event, Eddie Guerrero began to feud with Kurt Angle. During a Steel Cage match between Guerrero and JBL for the WWE Championship, El Gran Luchadore (Kurt Angle in disguise) interfered on JBL's behalf, which allowed JBL to escape the cage and win the match. After the match, Guerrero attacked El Gran Luchadore and <b>pulled</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> mask, revealing him to be Kurt Angle. The following week, Vince McMahon scheduled a match between the two at SummerSlam. Angle won the match, and their feud concluded at the November pay-per-view, Survivor Series, when Guerrero's team defeated Angle's in a 4 on 4 Survivor Series match.|$|E
25|$|Before the 1999 season, fans began {{discussing}} Earnhardt's age and speculating {{that with}} his son, Dale Jr., making his Winston Cup debut, Earnhardt might be contemplating retirement. Earnhardt swept both races for the year at Talladega, leading some to conclude that his talent had become limited to the restrictor plate tracks, which require a unique skill set and an exceptionally powerful racecar to win. But halfway through the year, Earnhardt began to show {{some of the old}} spark. In the August race at Michigan, he led laps late in the race and nearly <b>pulled</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> first win on a non-restrictor-plate track since 1996.|$|E
25|$|For {{the match}} between Rey Misterio Jr. and Juventud Guerrera Rey Misterio Jr. was {{accompanied}} by Super Caló while Guerera had Mosco de la Merced in his corner. The match quickly went out of control with the referee not counting when the two fought on the floor, treating the match as a no-disqualification match. After a long match where neither man could gain a decisive advantage Pierroth Jr. came to ringside and helped Guerrera and Mosco de la Merced attack Rey Misterio Jr. Mosco and Pierroth Jr. tired Misterio Jr.'s hands, making him helpless to block Guerrera's attack with a Kendo stick. After a couple of blows with the Kendo stick the masked rudo known as The Killer came to the ring to help out. An exhausted Juventud Guerrera gave Killer the Kendo Stick, but instead of hitting Rey Misterio Jr. the Killer turned to Guerrera and hit him {{over the head with}} the Kendo Stick several times, then <b>pulled</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> mask to reveal that it was actually Konnan under the mask. After chasing off both Pierroth Jr. and Mosoco Rey Misterio Jr. was finally able to roll up Juventud Guerrera for the pinfall victory. With the victory the storyline was that Misterio Jr. now owned Juventud Guerrera's car.|$|E

2500|$|Esposito {{was elected}} to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1984. On December 3, 1987, his #7 jersey was retired by the Boston Bruins in an {{emotional}} ceremony where the then-current wearer, superstar defenceman Ray Bourque, <b>pulled</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> #7 jersey to reveal his new number, 77—dramatically [...] "surrendering" [...] his old number in Esposito's favour. Esposito was [...] "visibly moved" [...] when Bourque showed the Boston Garden crowd his new number, which he used {{for the rest of his}} career. Esposito was also on hand in Boston to hand Bourque his retired number after the latter retired.|$|E
2500|$|The {{university}} adopted {{blue and}} white as its official colors in 1892. Originally, however, UK students had decided on blue and light yellow prior to the Kentucky-Centre College football game on December 19, 1887. The shade of blue, which is close to a royal blue, was chosen when a student asked the question, [...] "What color blue?" [...] At the time, Richard C. Stoll (who lettered in football at UK in 1889–94) <b>pulled</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> necktie and held it up. The students then adopted that particular shade of blue. A year later, UK students officially dropped the light yellow color for white because the two colors did not look good together.|$|E

2500|$|The {{secondary}} feud on SmackDown! featured Kurt Angle and Eddie Guerrero. The feud {{first started}} at WrestleMania XX, when Guerrero defeated Angle to successfully retain the WWE Championship. Guerrero lost the title to John [...] "Bradshaw" [...] Layfield (JBL) in June, when Angle, then-SmackDown! General Manager, screwed Guerrero and declared JBL the winner. Three weeks later, on the July 15 episode of SmackDown!, JBL defeated Guerrero in a Steel Cage match {{to retain the}} title. Towards {{the end of the}} match, El Gran Luchadore (portrayed by Angle) interfered, giving JBL enough time to escape the cage and win the match. After the match ended, Guerrero attacked Luchadore and <b>pulled</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> mask, revealing him to be Kurt Angle. On the following episode of SmackDown!, Vince McMahon scheduled a match between Angle and Guerrero for SummerSlam.|$|E
2500|$|Originally {{assured of}} his {{personal}} safety during the treaty negotiations, Hintsa rapidly found himself held hostage and pressured with massive demands for cattle [...] "restitution". Other sources say he offered himself as a hostage until the indemnity was paid and even suggested that he accompany Colonel Smith in collecting Xhosa cattle. He attempted to escape at the Nqabarha River but was pursued, <b>pulled</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> horse and immobilized with shots through the back and the leg. Immediately, a soldier named George Southey (brother of colonial administrator Sir Richard Southey) came up behind Hintsa and {{shot him in the}} back of the head; furthermore, Hintsa's ears were cut off after his death. Other sources say his horse bolted and Harry Smith tried to shoot the fleeing man but both his pistols misfired. Giving chase, he caught hold of Hintsa and dragged him heavily to the ground. Hintsa was still full of fight. [...] "He was jabbing at me furiously with his assegai," [...] Colonel Smith recalled in his autobiography, and the chief succeeded in breaking away to cover in a nearby stream bed. There, while pleading for mercy, the top of his skull was blown off by one of Smith's officers and his body was afterwards mutilated by British and colonial troops. These actions shocked the government in London, which condemned and repudiated Governor D’Urban. Hintsa's murder angered the Xhosa for decades thereafter.|$|E
2500|$|With over 5,000 {{supporters}} {{struggling to}} get through the Plainmoor turnstiles for the match with Crawley, there was a fifteen-minute delay to the kick off to {{what turned out to be}} an ill-tempered Fourth Round tie. [...] Torquay found it hard to get a foothold in the first half of the game and eventually fell behind in the 39th minute to a Matt Tubbs strike. [...] However, worse was to follow in the second period when Chris Zebroski was sent off in the 61st minute for a second bookable offence after a handball in the six yard box. [...] However, when keeper Scott Bevan managed to save the resulting penalty from Tubbs, the Gulls spirits were raised again until another penalty was awarded to Crawley just minutes later. [...] Astonishingly, Bevan <b>pulled</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> second penalty save of the match, this time from Craig McAllister, to give Torquay another lifeline. [...] Unfortunately, they were unable to capitalise on Bevan’s heroics and, despite the sending off of Dean Howell for Crawley in the 83rd minute, the score remained 1-0 until the final whistle. [...] In a match which saw seven bookings in addition to the two dismissals, many Torquay supporters were angered by the tactics employed by Crawley manager Steve Evans (two of Crawley’s yellow cards were for time wasting) and their misery was compounded the following day when Evans’ men were rewarded with a trip to Old Trafford to play Manchester United in the Fifth Round draw.|$|E

2500|$|After {{finishing}} {{his days in}} the isolation ward, Lukwiya would sit {{with members of the}} WHO, CDC and other medical teams that had set up in the hospital compound to offer assistance and take blood samples that allowed them to map the course of the disease. [...] His main question for them was how to stop his staff members from becoming infected. [...] The likely explanation in most cases are momentary lapses. [...] Health workers at St. Mary's worked 14 hours shifts for weeks in a row while in layers of protective clothing that were stifling in the equatorial country. [...] All that would be required for infection is for a health worker to lose focus for a moment and, after touching a patient, slip a gloved finger under their mask to scratch an itchy nose or rub an eye. [...] One infected St. Mary's health worker who may have been infected in this way was nurse Simon Ajok. [...] In the early morning of 20 November, Ajok was in the Ebola ward and critical, bleeding from both his nose and gums. [...] Fighting to breathe, Ajok <b>pulled</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> oxygen mask and coughed violently, sending a fine spray of blood and mucus against the nearby wall. [...] He then astonished and terrified the night-shift by rising to his feet and staggering into the hallway. [...] The night nurse on duty called Dr. Lukwiya for help. [...] Woken out of bed, Lukwiya put on protective clothing, mask, cap, gown, apron and two pairs of gloves, but not goggles or a face shield to protect the eyes. [...] Explanations for this range from grogginess at being newly awoken or haste to reach a colleague that he had helped train. [...] While it will never be known for certain, the care for Simon Ajok, who died one hour after the physician arrived, is the most likely candidate for Lukwiya's infection.|$|E
