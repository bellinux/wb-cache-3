2500|$|Stephanie Maslansky is {{the costume}} {{designer}} for Iron Fist, after serving {{the same role}} for the previous Marvel Netflix series. Maslansky noted one {{of the differences in}} the series compared to the other Marvel Netflix series was the neighborhoods it spent time in ("the wealthier neighborhoods; Midtown, Upper East Side, that sort of thing") compared to Hell's Kitchen for Daredevil and Jessica Jones and Harlem for Luke Cage. As such, Rand wears more suits than the other heroes, and given the amount of fighting he does in the season, a lot of spandex was added to increase the suits' flexibility. Rand's look evolves throughout the season, with Maslansky noting, [...] "When we first meet him he's clearly traveled a long way. I wanted <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> Danny and not be sure exactly what he was. A backpacker, or a homeless man. His look needed to reflect a variety of culture... almost ... otherworldly." [...] Once Rand enters the corporate world, he settles on an [...] "Urban Cali" [...] style, which is [...] "a little looser, little more relaxed. But it’s still a suit. His tie is never tied tightly and he always wears sneakers." [...] This relaxed style for Rand also provided [...] "a strong contrast" [...] to Ward Meachum who is a [...] "far more corporate looking person." [...] The monk costumes and Rand's warrior costume was based on [...] "real Shaolin warrior monk costumes... I took that distinctive silhouette from the Shaolin warrior monk clothing, and we combined it with the traditional colors of the Iron Fist, green and gold." [...] Regarding Gao, Maslansky stated [...] "Her particular look is influenced by ancient China," [...] particularly the Terracotta Army and further progress the [...] "villainy" [...] look of the Marvel Netflix series of [...] "surround themselves with , with beautiful things." ...|$|E

2500|$|Roxy Miéville appears {{with the}} couple, {{as well as}} with the unseen Godard and Anne-Marie Miéville at the end of the film. Godard and his {{long-term}} professional and romantic partner Miéville co-own Roxy, but no longer live together. During the film's production Godard would often talk about Miéville. Olivier Séguret of Libération observed that most of the film was shot in places Godard shared with Miéville in their personal life and that the dialogue between the two couples could be based on conversations between them. When interviewed by NPR, Bordwell interpreted the shots of Roxy as Godard [...] "trying to get <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the world in a kind of an unspoiled way... There are hints throughout the film that animal consciousness is kind of closer to the world than we are, that language sets up a barrier or filter or screen between us and what's really there. And although the film is full of language, talk, printed text and so on, nevertheless I think there's a sense he wants the viewer to scrape away a lot of the ordinary conceptions we have about how we communicate and look at the world afresh." [...] Godard said that it was partially true that he sees the world through Roxy's eyes and that Roxy [...] "restores balance" [...] to the couple when they are in conflict and represent [...] "the commoners" [...] while the couple represents [...] "nobility" [...] or [...] "the clergy." [...] MacCabe wrote that Roxy [...] "offer an image of acceptable sociality" [...] in the film. In a scene with Roxy, a narrator talks about the Universal Declaration on Animal Welfare, which Brody calls [...] "Godard's one rare glimmer of historical optimism.
