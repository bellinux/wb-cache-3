In 1725 Basile Bouchon invented an attachment for draw looms which used a broad strip of punched paper to select the warp threads that would be raised during weaving.

If one habitat's rotation is slightly off, the two cylinders will rotate about each other.

We present a methodology for generating and adapting object manipulation behaviors using reinforcement learning. An AIBO four-legged robot carries cylinders {{to a desired}} position by pushing them with its frontal legs. The movement of a cylinder depends on where the robot exerts forces on it, and upon several physical characteristics (geometry, weight, floor roughness, etc.). Initially the robot doesn’t know this dynamics and it learns it from its own experience. By continuously evaluating the action that minimizes the ti me to achieve the goal, and using a global configuration fitness function, the robots can complete the target configuration, and learn the tradeoff between <b>pushing</b> a given <b>cylinder</b> on a given position and moving itself to a new pushing position.

50|$|In {{case the}} {{retracted}} {{length of the}} cylinder is too long for the cylinder {{to be built in}} the structure, Telescopic cylinder can be used. One has to realize that for simple <b>pushing</b> applications telescopic <b>cylinders</b> might be easily available; for higher forces and/or double acting cylinders, they must be designed especially and are very expensive. If hydraulic cylinders are only used for pushing and the piston rod is brought in again by other means, one can also use Plunger cylinders. Plunger cylinders have no sealing over the piston, if the piston even exists. This means that only one oil connection is necessary. In general the diameter of the plunger is rather large compared with a normal piston cylinder, whereas a hydraulic motor will always leak oil.

50|$|Ship {{propulsion}} was improving but {{was also}} taking time to develop.

With greater efficiency came increasingly complex machinery and the larger potential for breakdown. However, advances in metallurgy and engineering, the potential for smaller bunkerage and the successful use of compounding in commercial engines made it an attractive option for naval engines, as well. By the 1870s, compound engines had become standard for warships. Compounding by itself did not increase power or speed significantly, although it allowed for a much greater operating range. Forced-draught systems would help increase power and speed but would not come into use until the early 1890s.|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{belongs to}} the field of Artificial Intelligence, {{robotics}} and qualitative reasoning. The purpose of the work is to use a qualitative simulator for planning qualitative actions of a robot. Our modification of the known QSIM algorithm generates state space, which we search with the heuristic search algorithm A*. Implementations of all algorithms are written in the programming language Prolog. Some machine learning algorithms induce qualitative models using QDE constraints that are not defined in the original QSIM algorithm. One of these QDE constraints is the monotonicity in multiple variables. This QDE constraint was implemented and tested on an artificial domain. Generated robot plans have been tested on an object pushing simulator, which is based on the Box 2 D engine. For this purpose, an algorithm for plan execution was developed. This plan execution algorithm communicates through an interface, which was also developed as part of the thesis. The interface is responsible for a conversion of numerical data into qualitative states. The interface also implements execution of qualitative actions on the simulator. Plans developed by the proposed algorithm have been tested in two object pushing domains: the case of <b>pushing</b> a vertical <b>cylinder</b> and the case of pushing a block. For this purpose, there was a hand-built qualitative model for each domain.

50|$|It uses water {{pressure}} from the water supply system rather than gravity from a raised tank like in previous models. A diaphragm separates a pressure chamber from the main water supply. A narrow passageway leads from the main water supply into the pressure chamber. It is the narrowness of this passage that meters the flow by slowing repressurizing of the pressure chamber after the action of a flush. The diaphragm technology allows the flush valve to open and let water into the bowl. A main cylinder valve operates up and down. A groove in this cylinder allows water from the main supply to flow through when {{it is in a}} mid position. The valve is shut off at both its top and bottom positions. A second valve, placed within the main cylinder valve, releases the water in the topmost pressure chamber when the flush lever is activated, sending the main cylinder valve shooting upwards. The topmost pressure chamber slowly refills through its narrow passageway, <b>pushing</b> the valve <b>cylinder</b> back down gradually. A flush occurs while it is in its open mid positions. Because the water is gradually shut off, slower water {{at the end of the}} cycle that will not activate the siphon serves to refill the bowl. The valve cannot be kept open by holding the flush lever in the activated position, wasting water, because this only sends the main cylinder valve all the way up to its topmost shutoff position. A flush can only occur when the valve is in one of its mid positions.|$|R

Experiments were conducted to collect dominant hand grip pressure and joint-angle data during activities of daily life. Representative actions chosen as part of this study were: <b>pushing</b> a weighted <b>cylinder</b> along a flat surface, pulling a weighted cylinder across a flat surface, and lifting a weighted cylinder from a flat surface to shoulder height. Three separate weighted cylinders were used, 3 lbs., 5 lbs., and 10 lbs., and the representative motions were repeated five times for each cylinder. A Tekscan Grip VersaTek Pressure Measurement System and Motion Analysis Cortex System were utilized to collect data. Each subject was outfitted with 18 separate sensorized piezo-resistive tiles placed on their dominant hand and 33 reflective markers at representative locations on their body. The motion of each cylinder was tracked via the placement of seven retro-reflective markers on the cylinder's surface. Analysis of cohort data from five male and five female volunteers, aged between 23 and 51 years, is presented. A Moving Average Filter was implemented to automatically determine contact between the subject's hand and the weighted cylinder. Once contact was determined during an action cycle, maximum detected pressure from each of 18 sensing areas was found. Results report wrist angle during the action- cycle as well as maximum applied pressure during each action across the cohort. Average wrist angle per action-cycle, by action, is also reported for the cohort.

In this field, several types of detectors are used to detect the presence of a source, to measure the exposure rate to men, to locate and to identify it. To test the performance of such detectors, many exposures with a radioactive source are required (typically 60), and the exposures need to be repeated with sources with different gamma-energies, and with neutron-emitting sources. For some tests, combinations of sources are used. IRMM and ITU jointly designed and built an instrument, named "NIR" that can expose a radioactive source for a defined amount of time. The instrument consists of a source holder, mounted on an electrically controlled <b>cylinder.</b> The <b>cylinder</b> <b>pushes</b> the source holder out of a radiation shield, and retracts the holder after the exposure time has elapsed. Unique about this instrument {{is the fact that it}} does not contain a fixed source. Instead, the user can choose any source available and mount it in the source holder. The motion of the source holder is very precisely controlled using a servo motor. It will always come to the same position, following the same motion profile. The instrument can be controlled from a distance using software running on a computer, thereby reducing exposure to operators, as compared to manually executed exposures.
