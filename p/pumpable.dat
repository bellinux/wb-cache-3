25|$|High solids (dry) digesters are {{designed}} to process materials with a solids content between 25 and 40%. Unlike wet digesters that process <b>pumpable</b> slurries, high solids (dry – stackable substrate) digesters {{are designed}} to process solid substrates without the addition of water. The primary styles of dry digesters are continuous vertical plug flow and batch tunnel horizontal digesters. Continuous vertical plug flow digesters are upright, cylindrical tanks where feedstock is continuously fed {{into the top of}} the digester, and flows downward by gravity during digestion. In batch tunnel digesters, the feedstock is deposited in tunnel-like chambers with a gas-tight door. Neither approach has mixing inside the digester. The amount of pretreatment, such as contaminant removal, depends both upon the nature of the waste streams being processed and the desired quality of the digestate. Size reduction (grinding) is beneficial in continuous vertical systems, as it accelerates digestion, while batch systems avoid grinding and instead require structure (e.g. yard waste) to reduce compaction of the stacked pile. Continuous vertical dry digesters have a smaller footprint due to the shorter effective retention time and vertical design. Wet digesters can be designed to operate in either a high-solids content, with a total suspended solids (TSS) concentration greater than ~20%, or a low-solids concentration less than ~15%.|$|E
500|$|A {{cofferdam}} {{is a small}} {{little space}} left open between two bulkheads, to give protection from heat, fire, or collision. Tankers generally have cofferdams forward and aft of the cargo tanks, and sometimes between individual tanks. A <b>pumpable</b> room houses all the pumps connected to a tanker's cargo lines. [...] Some larger tankers have two pumprooms. A pumproom generally spans the total breadth of the ship.|$|E
5000|$|Refrigeration systems using <b>pumpable</b> ice {{technology}} are attractive {{for the air}} cooling of supermarket counters (showcases). For this application, <b>pumpable</b> ice is circulated through the already available piping as a coolant, replacing environmentally unfriendly refrigerants like R-22 (Freon) and other hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFC’s).Reasons to use <b>pumpable</b> ice technology for this application are the following: ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Pumpable</b> {{ice with}} maximum ice {{concentration}} of 40% can be pumped {{straight from the}} ice maker to the consumer. The final possible ice concentration of <b>pumpable</b> ice in the storage tank is 50%. The maximum value of cooling energy of <b>pumpable</b> ice accumulated in the storage tank in a homogeneous phase is about 700 kWh, which corresponds to 10 - 15 m3 volume of a storage tank. A high-shear mixer is used to prevent the separation of ice from the cooled liquid and keeps the ice concentration unchanged over time and unaffected by the tank height. <b>Pumpable</b> ice is transported from the storage tank {{to a place of}} consumption that could be hundreds of meters away. The practical ratio between the required electric power of the submersible mixer motor (kW) and the “kneaded” <b>pumpable</b> ice volume (m3) is 1:1.|$|E

5000|$|Target of {{usage of}} PIT system: Applying <b>pumpable</b> ice for {{direct contact with}} a {{refrigerated}} product requires the installation of storage tanks with a mixer. To prevail over the tendency of ice to freeze in an iceberg form and to pump ice through the pipes over a distance of 100 m to 200 m, continuous mixing must be used.

5000|$|Wide {{perspectives}} for <b>pumpable</b> ice usage open up for {{the production}} of special wines reminiscent of [...] "ice wine" [...] (German Eiswein). In comparison with the existing technology for ice wine production, <b>pumpable</b> ice technology does not require a wait of a few months for the freezing of the grapes. Freshly squeezed grapes are harvested in a specific container connected to the <b>pumpable</b> ice machine. The juice is pumped through this machine, from which comes a mixture of ice (in the form of tiny, pure ice crystals) and a somewhat concentrated juice. Liquid ice returns to the accumulation tank, {{in which there is a}} natural (according to Archimedes law) separation of ice and juice. The cycle is repeated many times until the sugar concentration reaches 50-52°Brix. Then a process of fermentation takes place, resulting in this alcoholic drink.|$|E

50|$|In the <b>pumpable</b> {{ice maker}} liquid {{treatment}} {{is used to}} remove particles down to 1 µm in size and to minimize fouling of the heat transfer surface of the evaporators. Plate heat exchangers {{also need to be}} disassembled and cleaned periodically. Properly treating liquid before it enters the <b>pumpable</b> ice maker or the Plate heat exchanger will help to limit the amount of scale build-up, thus reducing cleaning times and preventative maintenance costs. Improperly sizing the liquid filter system leads to costly early change outs and poor performance.|$|E
50|$|A pumpable-ice-based Thermal Energy Storage System (TESS) {{can be used}} in {{centralized}} water-cooled {{air-conditioning systems}} in order to eliminate peak demand loads at critical times. This reduces the operating costs of buildings, the need for new power plants and modern transmission lines, power plant energy consumption and pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions. The idea is to make and accumulate <b>pumpable</b> ice during off-peak electricity hours with the lowest kWh tariff. The stored <b>pumpable</b> ice is used during middle- or high-tariff hours to cool the equipment or air supplied to the buildings. The return on investments (ROI) takes 2-4 years. In comparison with static and dynamic ice storage systems, the overall heat transfer coefficient (OHTC) during the production of <b>pumpable</b> ice is more than tens or hundreds of times higher (more efficient) than the same coefficient for the above-mentioned TESS types. This is explained by the presence of many different kinds of thermal resistances between the boiling refrigerant at the evaporator and water/ice in the storage tanks of static and dynamic ice storage systems. The high OHTC value pumpable-ice-technology-based TESS means a decrease in component volume, an increase in the maximum achievable concentration of ice in the volume of a storage tank, and ultimately a decrease in the price of equipment. TESSs based on <b>pumpable</b> ice technology have been installed in Japan, Korea, USA, UK and Saudi Arabia.|$|E

50|$|Indirect <b>pumpable</b> ice {{technologies}} produce <b>pumpable</b> ice {{consisting of}} 5 to 50 micrometer crystals {{and have a}} number of advantages. They can produce 1,000 kg of crystal ice at the low energy expenditure of 60 to 75 kWh instead of the 90 to 130 kWh required to produce regular water ice (plate, flake, shell types). Further improvements are expected to lead to a specific energy expenditure for ice production of 40 to 55 kWh per 1,000 kg of pure ice and a high specific ice capacity per an area value at the evaporator cooling surface (up to 450 kg/(m2·h)).|$|E
