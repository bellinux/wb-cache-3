It is the preposition întru, which expresses the <b>processuality</b> of the being or what he calls [...] "the becoming in-towards (întru) Being". This idiomatic preposition, of Latin provenance (intro) stands for more than a spatial inclusion: it indicates a going on, a movement both toward something, and within that something i.e. a movement of participation.|$|E

New media art is an umbrella term that encompasses art forms that are produced, modified and transmitted by means of digital technologies or, in a broader sense, make use of ‘new’ and emerging technologies that originate from a scientific, military or industrial context. The majority of authors that try to ‘delineate’ the aesthetic object of new media art emphasize aspects of interactivity, <b>processuality,</b> multimedia, and real time. The focus of new media art lies in the cultural, political, and social implications {{as well as the}} aesthetic possibilities - more or less its ‘media-specificity’ - of digital media. Consequently, scholars recognize the function of media technologies in New Media Art not only as a ‘carrier’ of meaning, but instead as a means that fundamentally shapes the very meaning of the artwork itself.|$|E
40|$|The {{issue of}} <b>processuality</b> {{in the area}} of music brought {{together}} many contemporary philosophersand theoreticians of art, while the roots of the research in <b>processuality</b> {{can be traced back to}} the late 19 th century. It is rarely noted, however, that this <b>processuality</b> is understood very diversely, sometimes even contradictory, by certain researchers. The basic difference emerging from the analysis of various viewpoints lies in determining what it is that procesuality should refer to (in other words: the <b>processuality</b> of what we deal with in music). The paper briefly presents several possible approaches to the issue and introduce the author’s own understanding of <b>processuality</b> in music. The different approaches analyzed in the paper entail the following options for understanding of the notion: (1) the <b>processuality</b> of the experience of a musical piece; (2) the <b>processuality</b> of the musical piece itself (the ontology of a work of art); (3) the <b>processuality</b> of perception the subject of which is a musical piece. The authors themself presents a hypothesis stating that music should be considered separately from the concept of a work of art, with <b>processuality</b> itself being an essential moment of music itself as an execution which does not constitute a composition.

Examina-se particularmente, por meio de uma metodologia anal??tica qualitativa, fundamentada nas contribui????es do pensamento sist??mico e complexo, um corpus de pesquisa de quatro sites cat??licos: CatolicaNet, Irm??s Ap??stolas do Sagrado Cora????o de Jesus ? Prov??ncia do Paran??, A 12 e Pe. Reginaldo Manzotti. Perscruta-se, assim, que religi??o resulta dessa manifesta????o de pr??ticas religiosas a partir do emprego e da atividade dos meios digitais, com o objetivo de colaborar com a an??lise das primeiras consequ??ncias diretas que esse fen??meno est?? trazendo para a religi??o e, particularmente, para a Igreja Cat??lica como a conhecemos hoje. A partir de uma leitura de alguns estudos que abordam a {{interface}} entre comunica????o e fen??meno religioso na Internet, reflete-se sobre alguns conceitos e perspectivas de an??lise para a investiga????o dos sites cat??licos institucionais brasileiros, como a midiatiza????o digital do sistema religioso; a quest??o da t??cnica transformada em meio; novas modalidades de experiencia????o; e novas configura????es de tempo-espa??o-materialidades na experi??ncia religiosa do fiel-internauta. Em seguida, descrevem-se tr??s modalidades de estrat??gias de oferta de sagrado por parte do sistema e de apropria????o por parte do fiel nos sites cat??licos brasileiros, a partir de infer??ncias obtidas em nosso corpus de pesquisa: os n??veis tecnol??gico e simb??lico d{{a interface}} interacional; quatro fluxos de intera????es discursivas; e dois fluxos, com dois subfluxos cada, de intera????es rituais. Como pistas de conclus??o, aponta-se que, por meio dessas estrat??gias interacionais, a religi??o que nasce no ambiente online ?? vivenciada, praticada e experienciada por meio de novas temporalidades, novas espacialidades, novas materialidades, novas discursividades e novas ritualidades marcadas pelos protocolos e processualidades da Internet. With {{the manifestation of}} a phenomenon of appropriation of the Internet by Catholic religious institutions, this research analyzes {{the operation of the}} interactions among faithful- Church-God to the living, practice and experience of the faith in the online rituals of the Brazilian Catholic digital environment. It examines in particular, through an analytical methodology, based on the contributions of the systemic and complex thinking, a corpus for research of four Catholic websites: CatolicaNet, Irm??s Ap??stolas do Sagrado Cora????o de Jesus - Prov??ncia do Paran??, A 12 and Fr. Reginaldo Manzotti. It investigates what religion is born from that manifestation of religious practices from the employment and activity of digital media, aiming to collaborate with the analysis of the first direct consequences this phenomenon is bringing to religion, and particularly for the Catholic Church as we know it today. From a reading of some studies that address the interface between communication and religious phenomenon on the Internet, it reflects on some concepts and analytical perspectives for investigating the institutional Catholic Brazilian websites, such as digital mediatization of the religious system; the issue of the technique transformed into media; new modalities of experiencing; and new configurations of time-space-materiality in the religious experience of the faithful. Then, it describes three modalities of supply strategies of the sacred by the system and of appropriation by the faithful in Brazilian Catholic websites, from inferences obtained from our corpus of research: four technological and symbolic levels of interface interactions; four flows of discursive interactions; and two flows, each with two sub-flows, of ritual interactions. In conclusion, it is noted that, through these interactional strategies, the religion that is born in the online environment is lived, practiced, and experienced through new temporalities, new spatialities, new materialities, new discursivities, and new ritualities that are marked by the protocols and <b>processualities</b> of the Internet...|$|R

40|$|In the “Logic of Being-there”, Chapter 2, Hegel {{discusses}} Finitude, {{beginning with}} a preamble wherein he advances the moments of the whole logical path. In a brief methodological recapitulation, he reaffirms that {{the first part of}} being-there (being there in general, quality and something) has a structure in which affirmative determination is dominant; whereas the second part of finitude (something and other, being-in-itself, being-for-other, determination, constitution and limit and something as finite) has a negative structure, that is, the negation of something is within itself, introducing the theme of otherness from the category of the other. What is the logical structure of something as finite? Something and other at the moment of limit show themselves as finite, since they both negate each other as the negation of negation. Then, the limit of something and other manifests itself as negation of negation, becoming contradictory and precarious. Hegel, in writing this dialectics of something and other, explains the objects in the world elaborating a new concept of substrate through the relationship between substrates and the idea of <b>processuality,</b> which dissolves the substrates and provides them with a new identity, substrates in movement of relationship and otherness. Whereas conventional thinking depicts the world as static substrates, dialectic thinking reveals the dimension of <b>processuality</b> in the world with meanin...|$|E

It {{is the language}} {{that allows us to}} be in the world, {{and at the same time}} it is the language which throws light upon how we are there. The air of Being is called with the ancient Greek Rhythmos as a first measurement of time, and thus the articulation of our speech points out the articulation of time. With reference to the musicologist Thrasybulos Georgiades the two formations of language will be shown as articulations of time that are most decisive for the Occident: the archaic rhythm of quantity which originates from a “filled time”, and the rhythm of accentuation that belongs to the arythmic principle of counting. The counting-principle of “empty time” is the allincluding reality (truth) of the present world. Heidegger calls it the “Gestell”. In this connection we have to repeat the question about the Rhythmos. The problem of Being in an epoch of an all dragging away <b>processuality</b> means nothing else than the question about the historical dimension of Rhythmos as a first measure of time...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{a version}} of ‘Live Sociology’ that enacts and engages with the openness and <b>processuality</b> of events. This is initially explored through a focus on everyday objects that, in their relationality, ‘misbehave’, potentially challenging standard sociological framings. Drawing {{on the work of}} Isabelle Stengers, it is suggested that such objects can be understood as ‘idiotic’ - possessed of an incommensurability that enables social scientists to ‘slow down’ and reflect upon ‘what is busily being done’ (not least by the social scientists themselves). This responsiveness to the idiot object is then contrasted to the proactive idiocy of Speculative Design. Here, artefacts - probes and prototypes – are designed to have oblique and ambiguous functions that allow both their users and designers to open up what is at stake in particular events. Examples taken from past and current research are used to illustrate how speculative designs can open up what ‘the neighbourhood’ and ‘energy demand reduction’ can be. The paper ends with a discussion of a possible ‘idiotic methodology’ and its implications for the conceptual and practical doings of social scientific research...|$|E

The problem of ethnic identification was examined among members of groups (endoidentification), as well as among non-members, i. e. outsiders (exoidentification).

Researchers of social life belonging to this orientation were usually using their general theoretical assumptions and methods for empirical investigations of daily interhuman interactions.

40|$|In preindustrial basic buildings, {{technological}} solutions that {{a local community}} processes to respond to specific needs are the lexical components of building language. Such processing takes place {{within the limits of}} a spontaneous behavior - which is aimed at finding the most economical resolution in terms of material and constructive knowledge - until the gradual progress of technological possibilities and the gradual weakening of the cultural and constructive limitations caused by the local-size of each community, lead to solutions gradually more elaborate than the initial spontaneous ones. This process is particularly interesting if it’s related to the costitutive elements of building enclosure, which constitute the main vehicles of rework in construction, technology and formal solution- first relating to the local tradition and then to monumental architecture’s codes- enriched gradually by the intentionality of architectural language. This process is particularly important in historical basic buildings, where urban tissue is readable in plan and elevation as a continuous organic and enclosure, in its specific connotation of facade, {{plays a key role in}} the characterization of building units. This applies in basic buildings rather than monumental architectures, because in monumental architectures all parts of the construction, such as the enclosure, are configured as costitutive elements designed to be representative of a coded language and architectural culture that often goes beyond the local traditions. Building language, as an anthropic product at minimum scale construction, it’s a particular aspect of the spontaneous process in pre-industrial buildings that regulates transformations in building structures and urban tissues. The approach to its reading can be follows methodological criteria of morpho-typological basic buildings reading, with the aim of systematically reconstruct the logical spontaneous figurative and construction <b>processuality</b> of its elements. This investigation, based on a multi-scale reading of building transformations, can break free from considerations about uniqueness of building product and influence of specific actors in building process; these are evaluations that were otherwise inevitable in the case of investigations on individual building, especially in monumental architecture.
