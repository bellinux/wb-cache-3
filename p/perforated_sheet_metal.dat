The Electromagnetic force on the sheet is calculated using Ansys Emag by changing the parameters in current density, gap between coil and sheet, the coil thickness. The force is calculated for nine combinations of the three parameters. Taguchi orthogonal array is used to find the best combination of parameters.

50|$|No wood {{is used in}} the {{manufacture}} of large numbers of AMD-65s. The front handguard area is made of <b>perforated</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> and typically has a gray plastic vertical foregrip attached to assist in controlling fully automatic fire from this short weapon.

Interestingly, the vertical foregrip is physically identical to the rear grip, with the former mounted backwards with respect to the rear. There are, however, wooden grips available which can serve in place of the common gray plastic version.

50|$|Faraday cages cannot block stable or slowly varying {{magnetic}} fields, {{such as the}} Earth's {{magnetic field}} (a compass will still work inside). To a large degree, though, they shield the interior from external electromagnetic radiation if the conductor is thick enough and any holes are significantly smaller than the wavelength of the radiation. For example, certain computer forensic test procedures of electronic systems that require an environment free of electromagnetic interference {{can be carried out}} within a screened room. These rooms are spaces that are completely enclosed by one or more layers of a fine metal mesh or <b>perforated</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>metal.</b> The metal layers are grounded to dissipate any electric currents generated from external or internal electromagnetic fields, and thus they block a large amount of the electromagnetic interference. See also electromagnetic shielding. They provide less attenuation from outgoing transmissions versus incoming: they can shield EMP waves from natural phenomena very effectively, but a tracking device, especially in upper frequencies, may be able to penetrate from within the cage (e.g., some cell phones operate at various radio frequencies so while one cell phone may not work, another one will).|$|E
50|$|In 1950, Vorgrimler {{moved to}} Spain where {{he created the}} LV-50 rifle {{chambered}} for the Kurz cartridge and later, the proprietary 7.92×40mm CETME M53 round. At this point, the rifle was renamed the Modelo 2. The Modelo 2 drew {{the attention of the}} West German Border Guards (Bundesgrenzschutz), who sought to re-equip the newly formed national defense forces. Not willing to accept a cartridge outside of the NATO specification, the Germans asked CETME to develop a 7.62×51mm version of the rifle. The resulting CETME Model A was chambered for the 7.62×51mm CETME cartridge which was identical in chamber dimensions but had a reduced-power load compared to the 7.62×51mm NATO round. Further development of the rifle with input from H&K produced the CETME Model B which received several modifications, including the ability to fire from a closed bolt in both semi-automatic and automatic firing modes, a new <b>perforated</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> handguard (the folding bipod had been the foregrip in previous models), improved ergonomics and a slightly longer barrel with a 22 mm rifle grenade launcher guide. In 1958, this rifle was accepted into service with the Spanish Army as the Modelo 58, using the 7.62×51mm CETME round.|$|E
5000|$|After the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) had to {{overcome}} several logistics problems which were {{a result of the}} wide variety of old firearms that were in service. In 1955 the IDF adopted the IMI-produced Uzi submachine gun. To replace the German Mauser Kar 98k and some British Lee-Enfield rifles, the IDF decided in the same year to adopt the FN FAL as its standard-issue infantry rifle, under the name Rov've Mitta'enn or Romat (רומ"ט), an abbreviation of [...] "Self-Loading Rifle". The FAL version ordered by the IDF came in two basic variants, both regular and heavy-barrel (automatic rifle), and were chambered for 7.62mm NATO ammunition. In common with heavy-barrel FALs used by several other nations, the Israeli 'heavy barrel' FAL (called the Makle'a Kal, or Makleon) was found to frequently experience a failure to feed after firing two rounds from a full magazine when in automatic mode. The Israeli FALs were originally produced as selective-fire rifles, though later light-barrel rifle versions were altered to semi-automatic fire only. The Israeli models are recognizable by a distinctive handguard with a forward <b>perforated</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> section, and a rear wood section unlike most other FALs in shape, and their higher 'Commonwealth'-type sights. Israel has been a keen user of rifle grenades, in particular the AT 52 which is often seen in photographs with the FAL.|$|E

40|$|In {{this report}} the {{anisotropic}} elastoplastic behaviour of <b>perforated</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> is investigated. Due to the perforation, {{which consists of}} a large number of small rectangular holes positioned in a regular pattern, the mechanical behaviour of the sheet is strongly anisotropic. All considerations are confined to geometricallinarity (small displacements, rotations and strains). A practical application of the above indicated problem, is the drawing process of shadow masks used in colour television tubes. The shape of a flat mask after drawing approximately follows the glass screen panel. From electron optical requirements both the shape and the position of a hole with respect to the screen panel are important. Therefore the drawing process has to be reproducible within relatively small tolerances. The prediction of the stress and strain distribution over the sheet during the stretching part of the drawing process is the main goal to be achieved in this report. An outline of this report is given below. In chapter 1 an overview of the general elastoplastic continuum theory is treated. This theory is mainly based on [2]. The rank four continuum elastoplastic tensor is derived. Although thi...|$|E
40|$|Commercialisation of proton {{exchange}} membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) technology depends on high volumetric power density and specific power {{for a given}} cost. In the present study, a novel wave-like architecture for PEMFC stack based on undulate membrane electrode assembles (MEAs) and perforated bipolar plates (PBPs) was presented.

After driving 25 screws {{at a particular}} work location/tool mass combination, subjects assessed their perceived exertion for that condition using the Borg ten-point ratio rating scale and completed a body part discomfort survey. Both tool mass and work location were significant factors in determining the ratings. As tool mass increased, so did the ratings of perceived exertion (18 % to 100 %). The lowest ratings of perceived exertion were at 114 cm on the vertical surface and at 13 cm on the horizontal surface. For the vertical surface, the body part discomfort data revealed that the low back and the right arm were often cited as uncomfortable at 64 cm, the right arm was identified as uncomfortable at 114 cm, and the right arm and the chest were cited as uncomfortable at 165 cm.
