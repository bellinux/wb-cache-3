At {{a time when the}} Government are proposing to extend <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> <b>supervision</b> over people with severe mental illness in the community, it is appropriate that service users' experiences of existing legislation are examined and reported.

The present paper presents the findings of a qualitative investigation into service users' perceptions and experiences of living with SDOs. In the interviews, service users communicated their understanding of why mental health professionals placed them on the order and how their lives have been affected. Individual service users are capable of seemingly contradictory responses, simultaneously accepting and resisting the orders. This paper presents a typology of the range of responses. These responses are fatalism and resignation, dependency, ownership, bargaining, cooperation, resistance, and rejection. The study provides a model with which we can begin to understand how service users respond to compulsory community care where their options are legally constrained...|$|R

The usefulness of creating a Court of Wards in the country was recognised by Philip Francis, a member of the Council of Bengal, as early as 1773, {{but it was not until}} August 1797 that the institution was finally established in the Presidency of Bengal by the Governor-General, Sir John Shore. The court had <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> <b>supervision</b> regarding the finances and upbringing of the heirs to estates, in the event that an estate owner died or was incapacitated. Its powers extended as far as allowing the Court to choose different heirs, to dissolve successions, and to take direct control of estates, including taking such control over lands and revenues as was found necessary to protect the interests of the British. Similar institutions were later established in other areas controlled by the East India Company - Assam, the Bombay Presidency, the Central Provinces, the North West Frontier Province, Orissa, the Punjab, Sindh, and the United Provinces - and were emulated by rulers such as the raja of the Gadwal samasthan.

Generally, the existence of multiple controllers produces a weak system, from which operators may benefit by using conflict regulation to their advantage. In the realm <b>of</b> banking <b>supervision,</b> studies adopting an empirical approach have shown that the ECB cannot exercise this function exclusively, also due to the genetic characteristics of European administrative law.
