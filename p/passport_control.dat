5|$|A {{special unit}} of the Stasi secret police worked covertly within the Grenztruppen, posing as regular border guards, between 1968 and 1985, to weed out {{potential}} defectors. One in ten officers and one in thirty enlisted men {{were said to have}} been recruited by the Stasi as informers. The Stasi regularly interviewed and maintained files on every guard. Stasi operatives were directly responsible for some aspects of security; <b>passport</b> <b>control</b> stations at crossings were manned by Stasi officers wearing Grenztruppen uniforms.|$|E
25|$|After the war, {{resources}} were significantly reduced {{but during the}} 1920s, SIS established a close operational relationship with the diplomatic service. In August 1919, Cumming created the new <b>passport</b> <b>control</b> department, providing diplomatic cover for agents abroad. The post of <b>Passport</b> <b>Control</b> Officer provided operatives with diplomatic immunity.|$|E
25|$|Airside transit visa, {{required}} by some countries for passing through their airports even {{without going through}} <b>passport</b> <b>control.</b>|$|E
50|$|The north {{track is}} served by a single car for <b>passport</b> <b>controlled</b> {{passengers}} only. The south track serves both <b>passport</b> <b>controlled</b> passengers and the general public, separated by platform dividers between the cars.|$|R
50|$|Racers are {{required}} to visit a series of checkpoints or <b>passport</b> <b>controls</b> (CPs), usually in a specific order.|$|R
50|$|Until 2006, Al-Buraimi and Al-‘Ain {{shared an}} open border. This border was closed in November 2006, and <b>passport</b> <b>controls</b> were imposed.|$|R
25|$|In arrivals, the {{terminal}} contains 52 immigration counters, 14 baggage carousels, and 12 e-gates (Electronic <b>Passport</b> <b>Control</b> System) used at all entry point into the United Arab Emirates. There are also 6 baggage carousels for oversized luggage.|$|E
25|$|Around 11:00am local time, {{a special}} {{operation}} was launched to patrol all the subway stations {{in search of}} possible clues to trace the instigators. Squads of local police performed <b>passport</b> <b>control</b> at every station of the Sokolnicheskaya Line.|$|E
25|$|The third {{level of}} Terminal E {{is used for}} departures, the second for <b>passport</b> <b>control,</b> and the ground level for arrivals and customs. The Federal Inspection Station located in Terminal E is capable of {{processing}} over 2,000 passengers per hour.|$|E
50|$|Since Switzerland's {{accession}} to the Schengen Area in 2008, {{there have been}} no permanent <b>passport</b> <b>controls</b> along this border, even if there can be customs controls.|$|R
2500|$|In 1917, Russia {{restricted}} emigration by instituting <b>passport</b> <b>controls</b> and forbidding {{the exit}} of belligerent nationals. In 1922, after the Treaty on the Creation of the USSR, both the Ukrainian SSR and the Russian SFSR issued general rules for travel that foreclosed virtually all departures, making legal emigration impossible. Border controls thereafter strengthened such that, by 1928, even illegal departure was effectively impossible. [...] This later included internal <b>passport</b> <b>controls,</b> which {{when combined with}} individual city Propiska ("place of residence") permits, and internal freedom of movement restrictions often called the 101st kilometre, greatly restricted mobility within even small areas of the Soviet Union.|$|R
2500|$|There is a {{need for}} full <b>passport</b> <b>controls,</b> since this is the border between the Schengen Area and the Common Travel Area. There are {{juxtaposed}} <b>controls,</b> meaning that <b>passports</b> are checked before boarding first by officials belonging to departing country and then officials of the destination country. These are only placed at the main Eurostar stations: French officials operate at London St Pancras, Ebbsfleet International and Ashford International, while British officials operate at Calais-Fréthun, Lille-Europe, Brussels-South and Paris-Gare du Nord. [...] There are security checks before boarding as well. For the shuttle road-vehicle trains, there are juxtaposed <b>passport</b> <b>controls</b> before boarding the trains.|$|R
25|$|The International Settlement of Shanghai was {{established}} by the Treaty of Nanking. Police, jurisdiction and <b>passport</b> <b>control</b> were implemented by the foreign autonomous board. Under the Unequal Treaties between China and European countries, visas were only required to book tickets departing from Europe.|$|E
25|$|Passengers {{travelling}} through international airports do {{not need}} a visa for a transit of less than 24 hours (except to/from Belarus), provided a confirmed onward ticket is held and the traveller remains in the international transit area (without clearing <b>passport</b> <b>control).</b>|$|E
25|$|After check-in, all {{checked baggage}} is {{screened}} using sophisticated X-ray and CT scanners {{and put in}} a pressure chamber to trigger any possible explosive devices. Following the check-in process, passengers continue to personal security and <b>passport</b> <b>control.</b> Before passing through the metal detectors and putting carry-on baggage through the X-ray machine at the security checkpoint, passports and boarding passes are re-inspected and additional questions may be asked. Before boarding the aircraft, passports and boarding passes are verified once again. Security procedures for incoming flights are not as stringent, but passengers may be questioned by <b>passport</b> <b>control</b> depending on country of origin, or countries visited prior to arrival in Israel. Passengers who have recently visited countries at war with Israel (all Arab countries except Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, Mauritania and Qatar) will be subject to further questioning.|$|E

25|$|In {{accordance}} with a treaty between Russia and Finland, {{though there are}} <b>passport</b> <b>controls</b> at borders, a visa is not required for just passing through the Russian part of the Saimaa canal without leaving the vessel.|$|R
50|$|In the European Union, Finland is {{a member}} of the Eurozone, and in addition, the Schengen treaty abolishing <b>passport</b> <b>controls.</b> 60% of foreign trade is to the EU. Other large trade {{partners}} are Russia and the United States.|$|R
25|$|Terminal E {{underwent}} a $100 million renovation {{which started in}} 2014, it includes a post-security connector between Terminals E and C (opened summer 2016), improved immigration and <b>passport</b> <b>control</b> kiosks, and gates capable of serving the Airbus A380. The Terminal E expansion was completed in late January 2017.|$|E
25|$|This {{works like}} {{juxtaposed}} controls {{and is more}} efficient than border control on arrival, since immigrants {{have the right to}} apply for asylum at <b>passport</b> <b>control</b> at ports of entry in the EU. Such applications must be done in person in the country the application is aimed at. Preventing immigrants from boarding aircraft or boats prevents them from applying for asylum.|$|E
25|$|The {{first phase}} of the work will be {{completed}} early next year, with all upgrades conforming to UK Visas and Immigration requirements. Phases two and three will then involve additions to the international arrivals hall, centring on improving its <b>passport</b> <b>control</b> and baggage reclaim facilities as well as increasing floor space. A separate £2million project to transform the terminal forecourt at Aberdeen Airport got underway in July 2008 and was completed that autumn.|$|E
50|$|The customs {{controls}} {{are located in}} a tunnel between the platforms and the station hall; international trains which continue to Basel SBB usually have on-board border <b>controls.</b> <b>Passport</b> <b>controls</b> were abolished when Switzerland joined the Schengen Area in 2008.|$|R
5|$|In 1995, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Russia, {{and later}} acceding states Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan signed the first {{agreements}} on {{the establishment of}} a Customs Union. Its purpose was to gradually lead the way toward the creation of open borders without <b>passport</b> <b>controls</b> between member states.|$|R
5000|$|The {{countries}} that apply the Schengen Agreement (Schengen Area, {{a subset of}} the EEA) do not implement <b>passport</b> <b>controls</b> between each other, unless exceptional circumstances occur. It is, however, mandatory to carry a passport, compliant national identity card or alien's resident permit.|$|R
25|$|At the {{check-in}} counter, passengers' passports and {{tickets are}} closely examined. A passport without a sticker from the security checkers {{will not be}} accepted. At <b>passport</b> <b>control</b> passengers' names are checked against information from the FBI, Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS), Scotland Yard, Shin Bet, and Interpol databases. Luggage is screened and sometimes hand searched. In addition, bags are put through a decompression chamber simulating pressures during flight that could trigger explosives. Even at overseas airports, El Al security agents conduct all luggage searches personally, {{even if they are}} supervised by government or private security firms.|$|E
25|$|The Overseas Passenger Terminal is host to both {{international}} and domestic cruise ships and liners. As a result of this, the Customs Hall, located within the OPT building is sometimes subject to the regulation and control of Border Protection, managed by the Australian Department of Immigration. Temporary spaces within the Customs Hall are prepared when a cruise ship is moored to allow immigration offers to screen passengers, providing health questionnaires, outbound/inbound passenger cards as well as <b>passport</b> <b>control.</b> Since the millennium upgrades, the efficiency and capacity of the OPT have been significantly improved, allowing for an average turn-over of 4,000 passengers within {{the course of a}} single day.|$|E
25|$|In October 1976 he {{returned}} undetected to Germany and on 1 November 1978 he and Adelheid Schulz shot two Dutch customs officers, Dionysius de Jong and Johannes Goemans, at a <b>passport</b> <b>control</b> in Kerkrade and seriously injured two more. de Jong died instantly, and Goemans died on 14 November 1978. When {{he was arrested}} on 9 June 1979 in Frankfurt am Main, Heissler was seriously injured by {{a shot in the}} head but survived. On 10 November 1982, he was sentenced to two life terms plus 15 years for murders and membership in the RAF. On 25 October 2001, he was released on probation.|$|E
25|$|Greece {{joined in}} 1981, Portugal and Spain {{following}} in 1986. In 1985, the Schengen Agreement {{paved the way}} for the creation of open borders without <b>passport</b> <b>controls</b> between most member states and some non-member states. In 1986, the European flag began to be used by the EEC and the Single European Act was signed.|$|R
25|$|In Western Europe in {{the late}} 19th century and early 20th century, {{passports}} and visas were not generally necessary for moving {{from one country to}} another. The relatively high speed and large movements of people traveling by train would have caused bottlenecks if regular <b>passport</b> <b>controls</b> had been used. Passports and visas became usually necessary as travel documents only after World War I.|$|R
50|$|The National Commission for Visas and <b>Passports</b> <b>controlled</b> all {{travel and}} {{immigration}} {{in and out}} of Romania. In effect, traveling abroad was all but impossible for anyone but highly placed Party officials, and any ordinary Romanian who applied for a passport was immediately placed under surveillance. Many Jews and ethnic Germans were given passports and exit visas through tacit agreements with the Israeli and West German governments.|$|R
25|$|Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport {{is built}} {{with only one}} airside hallway for both departing and {{arriving}} passengers. For that reason, security checks are located at gate entrances rather than on a central location. Passport controls are placed on two entrances and the single exit of the hallway. All passengers must pass the <b>passport</b> <b>control,</b> as there are no domestic flights. An additional security check used to exist on the hallway entrance, but it was removed in 2013 as it inconvenienced passengers and was not essential for security. In 2007 the airport prohibited cars parking next to the airport terminal, instead they {{have to use the}} car park provided, {{as a result of the}} 2007 Glasgow International Airport attack.|$|E
25|$|Until {{the summer}} of 2017 Terminal 1 was used for flight check-in, {{security}} screening and passport-control for international flights for passengers of certain low-cost airlines, but following <b>passport</b> <b>control</b> passengers were bussed to the departures concourse of Terminal 3 from which they boarded their flights. All incoming flights for airlines operating out of Terminal 1 were handled in Terminal 3. However, beginning on 19 June 2017 and following several months of renovations, Terminal 1 passengers began being bussed directly to their flights from Terminal 1, although incoming passengers continue to be handled in Terminal 3. The renovations to Terminal 1's boarding area included adding duty-free shops, restaurants and cafes. The terminal was also equipped with advanced checked-baggage handling and screening systems, {{similar to those in}} Terminal 3.|$|E
25|$|The {{next day}} the Czech {{authorities}} issued an international arrest warrant for Dahlgren, who, as was later revealed, had already passed through the <b>passport</b> <b>control</b> at Vienna International Airport before his name appeared in the international database. Subsequently, at around 1PM the Austrian authorities alerted the crew of Austrian Airlines flight OS93 of the arrest warrant. The flight, carrying Dahlgren, had left Vienna at 10:46AM and was at time flying over the United Kingdom. After contemplating an emergency landing or a return to Vienna, the pilots {{decided it would be}} safer to continue the flight. The cabin crew were instructed to pretend not to know anything about the suspect on the flight. Immediately after landing at Washington Dulles International Airport, the plane was stormed by U.S Customs and Border Protection Officers, who arrested Dahlgren and turned him over to the FBI.|$|E
50|$|The Soviet Socialist Republics of {{the later}} Soviet Union began such {{restrictions}} in 1918, with laws and borders tightening until even illegal emigration was nearly impossible by 1928. To strengthen this, they set up internal <b>passport</b> <b>controls</b> and individual city Propiska ("place of residence") permits, along with internal freedom of movement restrictions often called the 101st kilometre, rules which greatly restricted mobility within even small areas.|$|R
50|$|The EU has {{developed}} a single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. Within the Schengen Area (which includes 22 EU and 4 non-EU European states) <b>passport</b> <b>controls</b> have been abolished. EU policies favour the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within its boundaries, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries and regional development.|$|R
2500|$|The terminal, in the Otay Mesa {{neighborhood}} of San Diego, allows passengers {{to check in}} on the U.S. side of the U.S.–Mexico border, cross a [...] pedestrian/passenger bridge across the border, clear Mexican immigration and customs, and catch their flights at the Tijuana International Airport. Passengers arriving in Tijuana are equally able to cross the pedestrian/passenger bridge into the Otay Mesa passenger terminal, clear U.S. <b>passport</b> <b>controls</b> and U.S. Customs, and exit on the U.S. side.|$|R
