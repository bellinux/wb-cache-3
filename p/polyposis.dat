5|$|Mutations in the MADH4 gene {{is usually}} {{associated}} with juvenile <b>polyposis,</b> and detection of such a mutation would indicate a need to screen the patient and affected relatives for polyps and tumors of the large intestine.|$|E
5|$|Thyroid nodules {{have been}} {{associated}} with the Birt–Hogg–Dubé phenotype, present in 65% of individuals and 90% of families with the syndrome. However, a connection between BHD and thyroid cancer has not been substantiated. Other conditions have been reported to be associated but may not be caused by the mutation in FLCN or may not be related at all. These include multinodular goiter, medullary thyroid carcinoma, parotid oncocytoma, colonic <b>polyposis,</b> connective tissue nevus, lipomas, angiolipomas, parathyroid adenomas, flecked chorioretinopathy, neurothekeoma, meningiomas, angiofibromas of the face, trichoblastomas, cutaneous focal mucinosis, cutaneous leiomyoma, breast cancer, tonsillar cancer, colorectal cancer, sarcoma of the leg, lung cancer, melanoma, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, basal cell carcinoma, cutaneous leiomyosarcoma, and squamous cell carcinoma.|$|E
5|$|Five genetic {{types of}} HHT are recognized. Of these, three {{have been linked}} to {{particular}} genes, while the two remaining have currently only been associated with a particular locus. More than 80% of all cases of HHT are due to mutations in either ENG or ACVRL1. A total of over 600 different mutations is known. There {{is likely to be a}} predominance of either type in particular populations, but the data are conflicting. MADH4 mutations, which cause colonic <b>polyposis</b> in addition to HHT, comprise about 2% of disease-causing mutations. Apart from MADH4, it is not clear whether mutations in ENG and ACVRL1 lead to particular symptoms, although some reports suggest that ENG mutations are more likely to cause lung problems while ACVRL1 mutations may cause more liver problems, and pulmonary hypertension may be a particular problem in people with ACVRL1 mutations. People with exactly the same mutations may have different nature and severity of symptoms, suggesting that additional genes or other risk factors may determine the rate at which lesions develop; these have not yet been identified.|$|E
5|$|Several {{experimental}} and clinical {{studies have indicated}} that aberrations and deregulations of the UPS contribute to the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative and myodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and Pick's disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Huntington's disease, Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, and motor neuron diseases, polyglutamine (PolyQ) diseases, Muscular dystrophies and several rare forms of neurodegenerative diseases associated with dementia. As part of the Ubiquitin-Proteasome System (UPS), the proteasome maintains cardiac protein homeostasis and thus plays a significant role in cardiac Ischemic injury, ventricular hypertrophy and Heart failure. Additionally, evidence is accumulating that the UPS plays an essential role in malignant transformation. UPS proteolysis {{plays a major role in}} responses of cancer cells to stimulatory signals that are critical for the development of cancer. Accordingly, gene expression by degradation of transcription factors, such as p53, c-Jun, c-Fos, NF-κB, c-Myc, HIF-1α, MATα2, STAT3, sterol-regulated element-binding proteins and androgen receptors are all controlled by the UPS and thus involved in the development of various malignancies. Moreover, the UPS regulates the degradation of tumor suppressor gene products such as adenomatous <b>polyposis</b> coli (APC) in colorectal cancer, retinoblastoma (Rb). and von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (VHL), as well as a number of proto-oncogenes (Raf, Myc, Myb, Rel, Src, Mos, Abl). The UPS is also involved in the regulation of inflammatory responses. This activity is usually attributed to the role of proteasomes in the activation of NF-κB which further regulates the expression of pro inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-β, IL-8, adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, VCAM-1, P selectine) and prostaglandins and nitric oxide (NO). Additionally, the UPS also plays a role in inflammatory responses as regulators of leukocyte proliferation, mainly through proteolysis of cyclines and the degradation of CDK inhibitors. Lastly, autoimmune disease patients with SLE, Sjogren's syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) predominantly exhibit circulating proteasomes which can be applied as clinical biomarkers.|$|E
25|$|The third variant, {{autosomal}} recessive familial adenomatous <b>polyposis</b> or MYH-associated <b>polyposis,</b> is also milder and, {{as its name}} suggests, requires both parents to be 'carriers' to manifest the condition.|$|E
25|$|The genetic {{determinant}} in familial <b>polyposis</b> may also predispose carriers to other malignancies, e.g., of the duodenum and stomach (particularly ampullary adenocarcinoma). Other signs that may point to FAP are pigmented lesions of the retina ("CHRPE—congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium"), jaw cysts, sebaceous cysts, and osteomata (benign bone tumors). The combination of <b>polyposis,</b> osteomas, fibromas and sebaceous cysts is termed Gardner's syndrome (with or without abnormal scarring).|$|E
25|$|Treatment, {{typically}} surgery of some kind, {{is involved}} if <b>polyposis</b> {{has led to}} a large number of polyps, or a significant risk of cancer, or actual cancer.|$|E
25|$|Mutations and {{overexpression}} of β-catenin {{are associated}} with many cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma, colorectal carcinoma, lung cancer, malignant breast tumors, ovarian and endometrial cancer. Alterations in the localization and expression levels of beta-catenin {{have been associated with}} various forms of heart disease, including dilated cardiomyopathy. β-catenin is regulated and destroyed by the beta-catenin destruction complex, and in particular by the adenomatous <b>polyposis</b> coli (APC) protein, encoded by the tumour-suppressing APC gene. Therefore, genetic mutation of the APC gene is also strongly linked to cancers, and in particular colorectal cancer resulting from familial adenomatous <b>polyposis</b> (FAP).|$|E
25|$|Because {{familial}} <b>polyposis</b> develops very gradually over years, and {{can also}} manifest in an 'attenuated' form even more gradually, polyps resulting from FAP can lead to cancer developing at any point from adolescence to old age.|$|E
25|$|Familial adenomatous <b>polyposis</b> (FAP) is an {{inherited}} {{condition in which}} numerous adenomatous polyps form mainly in the epithelium of the large intestine. While these polyps start out benign, malignant transformation into colon cancer occurs when they are left untreated. Three variants are known to exist, FAP and attenuated FAP (originally called hereditary flat adenoma syndrome) are caused by APC gene defects on chromosome 5 while autosomal recessive FAP (or MYH-associated <b>polyposis)</b> is caused by defects in the MUTYH gene on chromosome 1. Of the three, FAP itself is the most severe and most common; although for all three, the resulting colonic polyps and cancers are confined to the colon wall and removal can greatly reduce the spread of cancer.|$|E
25|$|The {{first one}} {{includes}} the protein adenomatous <b>polyposis</b> coli (APC) {{and the associated}} protein EB1, which need MTs to localize on the kinetochores. Both proteins are required for correct chromosome segregation. EB1 binds only to MTs in polymerizing state, suggesting that it promotes kMTs stabilization during this phase.|$|E
25|$|Examples of disordered {{repetitive}} sequences {{include the}} 7-mer peptide repeats {{found in the}} RPB1 subunit of RNA polymerase II, or the tandem beta-catenin or axin binding linear motifs in APC (adenomatous <b>polyposis</b> coli). Examples of short repeats exhibiting ordered structures include the three-residue collagen repeat or the five-residue pentapeptide repeat that forms a beta helix structure.|$|E
25|$|Familial adenomatous <b>polyposis</b> {{can have}} {{different}} inheritance patterns and different genetic causes. When this condition results from mutations in the APC gene, it is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one {{copy of the}} altered gene is sufficient to cause the disorder. The incidence of malignancy in these cases approaches 100%. In most cases, an affected person has one parent with the condition.|$|E
25|$|Screening / {{monitoring}} programs involve visually {{examining the}} intestinal tract to check its healthy condition. It is undertaken as a routine matter {{every few years}} where there is cause for concern, when either (a) a genetic test has confirmed the risk or (b) a genetic test has not been undertaken for any reason so the actual risk is unknown. Screening and monitoring allows <b>polyposis</b> to be detected visually before it can become life-threatening.|$|E
25|$|Depending on {{the nature}} of the defect in the APC gene, and whether it is the full or {{attenuated}} form, familial <b>polyposis</b> may manifest as polyps in colon or in the duodenal tract, or in any combination of these. Therefore, an absence of polyps in, for example, the rectum, may not of itself be sufficient to confirm absence of polyps. It may be necessary to consider and visually examine other possible parts of the intestinal tract. Colonoscopy is preferred over sigmoidoscopy for this, as it provides better observation of the common right-side location of polyps.|$|E
25|$|Colorectal {{cancer is}} a disease of old age: It {{typically}} originates in the secretory cells lining the gut, and risk factors include diets low in vegetable fibre and high in fat. If a younger person gets such a cancer, it {{is often associated with}} hereditary syndromes like Peutz-Jegher's, hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer or familial adenomatous <b>polyposis.</b> Colorectal cancer can be detected through the bleeding of a polyp, colicky bowel pain, a bowel obstruction or the biopsy of a polyp at a screening colonoscopy. A constant feeling of having to go to the toilet or anemia might also point to this kind of cancer.|$|E
25|$|Most {{colorectal}} cancers {{are due to}} old age {{and lifestyle}} factors with {{only a small number}} of cases due to underlying genetic disorders. Some risk factors include diet, obesity, smoking, and lack of physical activity. Dietary factors that increase the risk include red and processed meat as well as alcohol. Another risk factor is inflammatory bowel disease, which includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Some of the inherited genetic disorders that can cause colorectal cancer include familial adenomatous <b>polyposis</b> and hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer; however, these represent less than 5% of cases. It typically starts as a benign tumor, often in the form of a polyp, which over time becomes cancerous.|$|E
25|$|Those with {{a family}} history in two or more first-degree {{relatives}} (such as a parent or sibling) have a two to threefold greater risk of disease and this group accounts for about 20% of all cases. A number of genetic syndromes are also associated with higher rates of colorectal cancer. The most common of these is hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC or Lynch syndrome) which is present in about 3% of people with colorectal cancer. Other syndromes that are strongly associated with colorectal cancer include Gardner syndrome, and familial adenomatous <b>polyposis</b> (FAP). For people with these syndromes, cancer almost always occurs and makes up 1% of the cancer cases. A total proctocolectomy may be recommended for people with FAP as a preventative measure due to the high risk of malignancy. Colectomy, removal of the colon, may not suffice as a preventative measure {{because of the high}} risk of rectal cancer if the rectum remains.|$|E
25|$|Mutation of tumor {{suppressor}} {{genes that}} are {{passed on to}} the next generation of not merely cells, but their offspring, can cause increased likelihoods for cancers to be inherited. Members within these families have increased incidence and decreased latency of multiple tumors. The mode of inheritance of mutant tumor suppressors is that affected member inherits a defective copy from one parent, and a normal copy from another. Because mutations in tumor suppressors act in a recessive manner (note, however, there are exceptions), the loss of the normal copy creates the cancer phenotype. For instance, individuals that are heterozygous for p53 mutations are often victims of Li-Fraumeni syndrome, and that are heterozygous for Rb mutations develop retinoblastoma. In similar fashion, mutations in the adenomatous <b>polyposis</b> coli gene are linked to adenopolyposis colon cancer, with thousands of polyps in the colon while young, whereas mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 lead to early onset of breast cancer.|$|E
25|$|In {{some cases}} FAP can {{manifest}} {{higher in the}} colon than usual (for example, the ascending colon, or proximal to the splenic flexure, or in the gastric or duodenal tracts) where they show no symptoms until cancer is present and greatly advanced. APC mutations {{have been linked to}} certain other cancers such as thyroid cancer. As the mutation causing FAP is genetic, it can be inherited hereditarily from either parent, and passed to children. A genetic blood test of the APC gene exists that can determine whether it is deficient, and therefore can predict the possibility of FAP. Individuals at risk (due to family links or genetic testing) are usually offered routine monitoring of the intestinal tract every 1 – 5 years for life, from early adulthood, to detect the slow-forming polyps and act if found, before they can pose a threat. International <b>polyposis</b> registries exists that track known cases of FAP or APC gene defects, for research and clinical purposes. Mutation of APC also occurs commonly in incident cases of colorectal carcinoma, emphasizing its importance in this form of cancer.|$|E
500|$|Pancreatic {{cancer has}} been {{associated}} with the following other rare hereditary syndromes: Peutz–Jeghers syndrome [...] due to mutations in the STK11 tumor suppressor gene (very rare, but a very strong risk factor); dysplastic nevus syndrome (or familial atypical multiple mole and melanoma syndrome, FAMMM-PC) due to mutations in the CDKN2A tumor suppressor gene; autosomal recessive ataxia-telangiectasia and autosomal dominantly inherited mutations in the BRCA2 gene and PALB2 gene; [...] hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer (Lynch syndrome); and familial adenomatous <b>polyposis.</b> PanNETs have been associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) and von Hippel Lindau syndromes.|$|E
2500|$|Familial adenomatous <b>polyposis</b> (FAP) {{should be}} {{excluded}} {{in cases of}} colorectal carcinoma; ...|$|E
2500|$|Because of {{the genetic}} nature of FAP, <b>polyposis</b> {{registries}} have been developed around the world. [...] The purpose of these registries is to increase knowledge about the transmissibility of FAP, but also to document, track, and notify family members of affected individuals. [...] One study {{has shown that the}} use of a registry to notify family members (call-ups) significantly reduced mortality when compared with probands. The [...] is the oldest in the world, started in 1924, and many other <b>polyposis</b> registries now exist.|$|E
2500|$|At least 3 {{relatives}} with histologically confirmed colorectal cancer, 1 {{of whom is}} a {{first degree}} relative of the other 2; familial adenomatous <b>polyposis</b> should be excluded; ...|$|E
2500|$|Papillary thyroid cancer (75% to 85% of cases) – {{often in}} young females – {{excellent}} prognosis. May occur {{in women with}} familial adenomatous <b>polyposis</b> and in patients with Cowden syndrome.|$|E
2500|$|The APC [...] is a tumour {{suppressor}} gene responsible {{for the production of}} adenomatous <b>polyposis</b> coli (APC), a large multifunction tumour-suppressing protein which acts as a [...] "gatekeeper" [...] to prevent development of tumours. (APC regulates β-catenin, a protein that plays a crucial role in cell communication, signalling, growth, and controlled destruction, but which left uncontrolled also gives rise to numerous cancers). A flaw in the APC gene means APC is not as effective as it should be, and over time it is likely that some cells that should have been controlled by APC will not be, and will instead continue to develop and become cancerous. [...] In familiar <b>polyposis</b> they usually manifest as polyps—small abnormalities {{on the surface of the}} intestinal tract.|$|E
2500|$|NCBI {{states that}} when an {{individual}} is identified as having FAP, or the mutations resulting in FAP: [...] "It is appropriate to evaluate the parents of an affected individual (a) with molecular genetic testing of APC if the disease-causing mutation is known in the proband [...] or (b) for clinical manifestations of APC-associated <b>polyposis</b> conditions".|$|E
2500|$|Because {{of the way}} {{familial}} <b>polyposis</b> develops, it {{is possible}} to have the genetic condition, and therefore be at risk, but have no polyps or issues so far. Therefore, an individual may be diagnosed [...] "at risk of" [...] FAP, and require routine monitoring, but not (yet) actually have FAP (i.e., carries a defective gene but as yet appears not to have any actual medical issue as a result of this). Clinical management can cover several areas: ...|$|E
2500|$|The second form of FAP, {{known as}} {{attenuated}} familial adenomatous <b>polyposis</b> has the APC gene functional but slightly impaired. It is therefore somewhat {{able to operate}} as usual. [...] Attenuated FAP still presents a high 70% lifetime risk of cancer (as estimated), but typically presents with far fewer polyps (typically 30) rather than the hundreds or thousands usually found in FAP, [...] and arises {{at an age when}} FAP is usually no longer considered likely—typically between 40 and 70 years old (average 55) rather than the more usual 30's upward. Because it has far fewer polyps, options for management may be different.|$|E
2500|$|NCBI {{states that}} [...] "Although most {{individuals}} diagnosed with an APC-associated <b>polyposis</b> condition have an affected parent, the family history {{may appear to}} be negative because of failure to recognize the disorder in family members, early death of the parent before the onset of symptoms, or late onset of the disease in the affected parent." [...] In addition around 20% of cases are a de novo mutation, and of those with an apparent de novo APC mutation (i.e. no known family history) 20% have somatic mosaicism. Asymptomatic individuals (and therefore asymptomatic family members) are also known to exist.|$|E
2500|$|Similar {{mutations}} {{are also}} frequently {{seen in the}} β-catenin recruiting motifs of APC. Hereditary loss-of-function mutations of APC cause a condition known as Familial Adenomatous <b>Polyposis.</b> Affected individuals develop hundreds of polyps in their large intestine. Most of these polyps are benign in nature, but they {{have the potential to}} transform into deadly cancer as time progresses. Somatic mutations of APC in colorectal cancer are also not uncommon. [...] Beta-catenin and APC are among the key genes (together with others, like K-Ras and SMAD4) involved in colorectal cancer development. The potential of β-catenin to change the previously epithelial phenotype of affected cells into an invasive, mesenchyme-like type contributes greatly to metastasis formation.|$|E
2500|$|Similarly, we {{find the}} {{familiar}} E-cadherin, whose cytoplasmatic tail contacts the ARM domain in the same canonical fashion. The scaffold protein axin (two closely related paralogs, axin 1 and axin 2) contains a similar interaction motif on its long, disordered middle segment. Although one molecule of axin only contains a single β-catenin recruitment motif, its partner the Adenomatous <b>Polyposis</b> Coli (APC) protein contains 11 such motifs in tandem arrangement per protomer, thus capable to interact with several β-catenin molecules at once. [...] Since {{the surface of the}} ARM domain can typically accommodate only one peptide motif at any given time, all these proteins compete for the same cellular pool of β-catenin molecules. This competition is the key to understand how the Wnt signaling pathway works.|$|E
2500|$|But even axin {{does not}} act alone. Through its N-terminal {{regulator}} of G-protein signaling (RGS) domain, it recruits the adenomatous <b>polyposis</b> coli (APC) protein. APC {{is like a}} huge [...] "Christmas tree": with a multitude of β-catenin binding motifs (one APC molecule alone possesses 11 such motifs [...] ), it may collect as many β-catenin molecules as possible. APC can interact with multiple axin molecules {{at the same time}} as it has three SAMP motifs (Ser-Ala-Met-Pro) to bind the RGS domains found in axin. In addition, axin also has the potential to oligomerize through its C-terminal DIX domain. The result is a huge, multimeric protein assembly dedicated to β-catenin phosphorylation. This complex is usually called the beta-catenin destruction complex, although it is distinct from the proteosome machinery actually responsible for β-catenin degradation. It only marks β-catenin molecules for subsequent destruction.|$|E
2500|$|In 1986, Marc Kirschner and Tim Mitchison {{proposed}} that microtubules use their dynamic properties {{of growth and}} shrinkage at their plus ends to probe the three dimensional space of the cell. Plus ends that encounter kinetochores or sites of polarity become captured and no longer display growth or shrinkage. In contrast to normal dynamic microtubules, which have a half-life of 5–10 minutes, the captured microtubules can last for hours. This idea {{is commonly known as}} the [...] "search and capture" [...] model. Indeed, work since then has largely validated this idea. At the kinetochore, a variety of complexes have been shown to capture microtubule (+)-ends. Moreover, a (+)-end capping activity for interphase microtubules has also been described. This later activity is mediated by formins, the adenomatous <b>polyposis</b> coli protein, and EB1, a protein that tracks along the growing plus ends of microtubules.|$|E
2500|$|The Wnt/β-catenin pathway {{starts with}} the binding of Wnt to a {{receptor}} complex encompassing a Fz receptor and LRP co-receptor. [...] After Wnt binds, an intracellular protein named Dishevelled (Dvl) is activated via phosphorylation. β-catenin degradation complexes in the cytoplasm are composed of adenomatous <b>polyposis</b> coli (APC), glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) and Axin. [...] APC promotes the degradation of β-catenin by increasing the affinity of the degradation complex to β-catenin. [...] Axin is a scaffolding protein which holds the degradation complex together. [...] The activated Dvl associates with Axin and prevents GSK3β and casein kinase 1α (CK1α) from phosphorylating critical substrates, such as β-catenin. [...] Phosphorylation of β-catenin marks the protein for ubiquitylation and rapid degradation by proteasomes. [...] Thus, the binding of Wnt to the receptor results in a non-phosphorylated form of β-catenin which localizes to the nucleus and, after displacing the Groucho corepressor protein, forms a complex with Tcf/Lef transcription factors and co-activators (such as CREB binding protein) and induces the expression of downstream target genes.|$|E
50|$|Other {{conditions}} {{consisting of}} multiple hamartomatous polyps of {{the digestive tract}} include Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, juvenile <b>polyposis,</b> and Cowden disease. Related <b>polyposis</b> conditions are familial adenomatous <b>polyposis,</b> attenuated familial adenomatous <b>polyposis,</b> Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome and MUTYH.|$|E
