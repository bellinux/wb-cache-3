25|$|Collage {{made from}} photographs, {{or parts of}} photographs, is called <b>photomontage.</b> <b>Photomontage</b> is the process (and result) of making a {{composite}} photograph by cutting and joining {{a number of other}} photographs. The composite picture was sometimes photographed so that the final image is converted back into a seamless photographic print. The same method is accomplished today using image-editing software. The technique is referred to by professionals as compositing.|$|E

They also alleged that {{a photograph of the}} former New Democracy leader Konstantinos Mitsotakis, standing next to a uniformed Nazi officer, repeatedly published by the PASOK-leaning Greek daily Avriani, was really a <b>photomontage</b> that had been fabricated in Bulgaria. Their disclosures have not been challenged to this day.|$|E
25|$|The <b>photomontage</b> {{became the}} {{technique}} most associated with Berlin Dada, used extensively by Hausmann, Höch, Heartfield, Baader and Grosz, and would prove a crucial influence on Kurt Schwitters, El Lissitsky and Russian Constructivism. It {{should also be}} pointed out that Grosz, Heartfield and Baader all laid claim to having invented the technique in later memoirs, although no works have surfaced to justify these claims.|$|E
25|$|The Constructivists were early {{developers}} {{of the techniques}} of <b>photomontage.</b> Gustav Klutsis' 'Dynamic City' and 'Lenin and Electrification' (1919–20) are the first examples of this method of montage, which had in common with Dadaism the collaging together of news photographs and painted sections. However Constructivist montages would be less 'destructive' than those of Dadaism. Perhaps {{the most famous of}} these montages was Rodchenko's illustrations of the Mayakovsky poem About This.|$|E

25|$|The book {{designs of}} Rodchenko, El Lissitzky and others such as Solomon Telingater and Anton Lavinsky were a major {{inspiration}} {{for the work of}} radical designers in the West, particularly Jan Tschichold. Many Constructivists worked on the design of posters for everything from cinema to political propaganda: the former represented best by the brightly coloured, geometric posters of the Stenberg brothers (Georgii and Vladimir Stenberg), and the latter by the agitational <b>photomontage</b> work of Gustav Klutsis and Valentina Kulagina.|$|E

25|$|Yves Klein {{had been}} a {{precursor}} of performance art with the conceptual pieces of Zone de Sensibilité Picturale Immatérielle (Zones of Immaterial Pictorial Sensibility) 1959–62, Anthropométries (1960), and works like the <b>photomontage,</b> Saut dans le vide (Leap into the Void). In the late 1960s Earth artists as diverse as Robert Smithson, Dennis Oppenheim, Michael Heizer and Carl Andre created environmental pieces that predict the performance art of the 1970s. Works of conceptual artists in the early 1980s, like Sol LeWitt, who converted mural-style drawing into an act of performance by others, were influenced by Yves Klein and the Earth artists as well.|$|E

25|$|Photography and {{videography}} are the mainstays of recording, {{which has}} become much more convenient with the advent of reasonably priced digital still and HD video cameras. Cameras, including video cameras can be provided with special underwater housings that enable them to be used for underwater videography. Low visibility underwater and distortion of image due to refraction mean that perspective photographs can be difficult to obtain. However, it is possible to take a series of photographs at adjacent points and then combined into a single <b>photomontage</b> or photomosaic image of the whole site. 3D photogrammetry has also become a very popular way to image underwater cultural materials and shipwreck sites.|$|E
500|$|Along with {{pavilion}} design, Lissitzky began {{experimenting with}} print media again. His work with book and periodical design was {{perhaps some of}} his most accomplished and influential. He launched radical innovations in typography and <b>photomontage,</b> two fields in which he was particularly adept. He even designed a <b>photomontage</b> birth announcement in 1930 for his recently born son, Jen. [...] itself is seen as being another personal endorsement of the Soviet Union, as it superimposed an image of the infant Jen over a factory chimney, linking Jen's future with his country's industrial progress. Around this time, Lissitzky's interest in book design escalated. In his remaining years, {{some of his most}} challenging and innovative works in this field would develop. In discussing his vision of the book, he wrote: ...|$|E
500|$|Back in the USSR, Lissitzky {{designed}} displays for {{the official}} Soviet pavilions {{at the international}} exhibitions of the period, up to the 1939 New York World's Fair. One of his most notable exhibits was the All-Union Polygraphic Exhibit in Moscow in August–October 1927, where Lissitzky headed the design team for [...] "photography and photomechanics" [...] (i.e. <b>photomontage)</b> artists and the installation crew. His work was perceived as radically new, especially when juxtaposed with the classicist designs of Vladimir Favorsky (head of the book art section of the same exhibition) and of the foreign exhibits.|$|E

40|$|Graphically {{manipulated}} {{photographs were}} frequently used {{to illustrate the}} impact of the projected building on the existing cityscape or landscape, in particular, in those cases, where the projects had a monumental scale. We discouvered two sorts of documents at Teófilo Rego Archive: on the one hand, the collages and <b>photomontages</b> made by architects and photographed by Teófilo Rego; on the other hand, collages and <b>photomontages</b> made by Teófilo Rego at the commission of architects, a work whose depth seems to indicate the collaboration, a free, curious and imaginative spirit of research and the deepening of the formal and expressive hypothesis proportionated by the commission. In the second group are included the photographs of four projects of the International Competition for the monument to the Infante D. Henrique in Sagres, 1954 / 1957. The <b>photomontages</b> and collages contained in the specification and in the draft’s process submitted by João Andresen, and the <b>photomontages</b> of the projects by Nadir Afonso and Manuel da Silva Passos Junior must have been a form of project impact statement from their authors, and certainly represent a period of great creativity as concerns Teófilo Rego. All <b>photomontages</b> by Teófilo Rego are constructed images, the result of a rational being, but are also emotional. As his gaze approaches the models, the images become abstract, and deviate from a possible illusion of reality. Whereas the compositions on the territory and the monument demanded a certain expressive naturalism more than realism, it is the geometric abstraction of architectural form that prevails in the close-ups.

500|$|Palace Software {{repeated}} the {{strategy for the}} sequel, publishing a poster of Whittaker as Princess Mariana, this time in metal bikini armour, and Michael Van Wijk as the barbarian. [...] Steve Brown, creator of the Barbarian games, recalled that the bikini's chain [...] "snapped a number of times" [...] in comical Carry On fashion during the shoot. [...] Brown was behind {{the concept of the}} poster, which was brought to fruition by Lee Gibbons, a commercial artist, over the course of four weeks. [...] The image of the barbarian and princess poised over the fallen body of a large, scaly monster was a <b>photomontage,</b> created by superimposing three photographsone of each subjecton one another. [...] The creature was a small scale model made of Plasticine. [...] After cutting out the subjects from their photos and composing the cut-outs to form a new scene, Gibbons painted the background and added effects such as smoke to form the final image.|$|E
500|$|His first designs {{appeared}} in the 1917 book, Sihas hulin: Eyne fun di geshikhten (An Everyday Conversation), where he incorporated Hebrew letters with a distinctly art nouveau flair. His next book was a visual retelling of the traditional Jewish Passover song Had gadya (One Goat), in which Lissitzky showcased a typographic device that he would often return to in later designs. In the book, he integrated letters with images through a system that matched {{the color of the}} characters in the story with the word referring to them. In the designs for the final page, Lissitzky depicts the mighty [...] "hand of God" [...] slaying the angel of death, who wears the tsar's crown. This representation links the redemption of the Jews with the victory of the Bolsheviks in the Russian Revolution. An alternative view asserts that the artist was wary of Bolshevik internationalization, leading to destruction of traditional Jewish culture. Visual representations of the hand of God would recur in numerous pieces throughout his entire career, most notably with his 1924 <b>photomontage</b> self-portrait The Constructor, which prominently featured the hand.|$|E
500|$|Lissitzky's {{entire career}} was laced {{with the belief}} that the artist could be an agent for change, later {{summarized}} with his edict, [...] "das zielbewußte Schaffen" [...] (goal-oriented creation). Lissitzky, of Lithuanian Jewish оrigin, began his career illustrating Yiddish children's books in an effort to promote Jewish culture in Russia. When only 15 he started teaching, a duty he would maintain for most of his life. Over the years, he taught in a variety of positions, schools, and artistic media, spreading and exchanging ideas. He took this ethic with him when he worked with Malevich in heading the suprematist art group UNOVIS, when he developed a variant suprematist series of his own, Proun, and further still in 1921, when he took up a job as the Russian cultural ambassador to Weimar Germany, working with and influencing important figures of the Bauhaus and De Stijl movements during his stay. In his remaining years he brought significant innovation and change to typography, exhibition design, <b>photomontage,</b> and book design, producing critically respected works and winning international acclaim for his exhibition design. This continued until his deathbed, where in 1941 he produced one of his last works– a Soviet propaganda poster rallying the people to construct more tanks for the fight against Nazi Germany. In 2014, the heirs of the artist, in collaboration with Van Abbemuseum and leading worldwide scholars on the subject, the Lissitzky Foundation was established in order to preserve the artist's legacy and to prepare a catalogue raisonné of the artist oeuvre.|$|E

50|$|In particular, he {{used the}} pages of {{magazines}} like Look, Life, L'Espresso, and Paris Match, in which enquiries, documentaries, and ads all co-existed; anticipating television, which was still structured along theatrical lines. Thus he created his first <b>photomontages.</b>|$|R
50|$|Ramos-Poquí {{refers to}} his {{intimate}} {{works of the}} 1980s as ‘symbolic paintings' which were followed during the 90s by a series driven by urban inspiration known as ‘Satirical and Metaphysical Urban paintings’, executed while he was developing digital <b>photomontages.</b> Having already produced lithographs and etchings, {{it was during this}} period that he explored the possibilities of this new digital medium. His digital <b>photomontages</b> were exhibited in London. They were praised by art critics including :es: José Corredor-Matheos and reviewed in many London papers. In 2001 he was commissioned to design the book covers for the Open University course 'Exploring Psychology.'His assemblages, of a satirical nature, were exhibited both in London and Belfast.|$|R
500|$|The general {{opinion of}} Fountain of the Great Lakes was {{positive}} with some describing it as a cultural achievement for Taft and Chicago. The detractors conceded that as a figural composition, it was ideal in an Old World way. [...] Critics voiced concern over the sculpture's confusion and decorum. [...] One of the basic problems for the critics was the propriety of the symbolism of artistic and attractive bronze figures posed as bodies of water. [...] There had for some time been discussion of the depictions representing relative elevations and the flows of the waters as they seem to do. There were grumblings for closer association of the figures to the lakes by use of physical features, directional orientation and definite contours. [...] Harriet Monroe, a general supporter of Taft's artistic efforts, was disappointed in the lack of representative geographic configuration {{and the lack of}} spirit of the lakes as inland seas. [...] With respect to this specific piece she had gone from being an ardent supporter who felt the model was [...] "stupendous" [...] to finding herself in [...] "doubt" [...] about the work. [...] Taft's human form depictions of the lake failed to capture the imagery of contemporary literature as it related to the power and fury of nature and the heroism of those struggling against those forces in works such as those of Hamlin Garland, Charles Eugene Banks, Willa Cather, or Robert Morss Lovett. [...] Taft's representations of Lakes with quiet trickling water was in keeping with his general theme of quiet dignity for public sculpture. [...] On the day of the dedication the Chicago Daily News expressed this point with a <b>photomontage</b> juxtaposition of Taft's fountain and Lake Michigan in all its fury.|$|E
2500|$|Klein is {{also well}} known for a <b>photomontage,</b> Saut dans le vide (Leap into the Void), {{originally}} published in the artist's book Dimanche, which apparently shows him jumping off a wall, arms outstretched, towards the pavement. Klein used the photograph as evidence {{of his ability to}} undertake unaided lunar travel. In fact, [...] "Saut dans le vide", published as part of a broadside on the part of Klein (the [...] "artist of space") denouncing NASA's own lunar expeditions as hubris and folly, was a <b>photomontage</b> in which the large tarpaulin Klein leaped onto was removed from the final image.|$|E
2500|$|The Dadaists – the [...] "monteurs" [...] (mechanics) – used {{scissors}} and glue rather than paintbrushes and paints {{to express their}} views of modern life through images presented by the media.
