5000|$|The {{movement}} of the head at <b>program</b> <b>switch</b> point could sometimes pull the tape up or down, causing the tape to fold over and start playing {{the back side of}} the tape. The tape would continue to play, albeit muffled and barely audible. Continued playing would flip the entire tape over, so the tape would be wound on the reel inside with the backside showing. Many vintage tapes can be found with {{the back side of the}} tape, facing forward. The <b>program</b> <b>switch</b> point is often the place where the tapes would be ingested into the player i.e. [...] "eaten", when the tape head moved from program 4, to program 1- its furthest track change movement. While moving upward the head would grab the tape, fold it over, and when this fold hit the capstan, it would wrap around the capstan and ingest the tape into the player.|$|E

40|$|A floating-gate {{transistor}} array and method for programming the same. The floating-gate {{transistor array}} includes {{a plurality of}} transistors having a source, drain, and floating-gate, whereby the plurality of transistors is arranged into multiple rows and columns. Each row of transistors includes a row <b>programming</b> <b>switch</b> having an output connected to each floating-gate within the row, while each column of transistors includes a column <b>programming</b> <b>switch</b> having an output connected to each drain within the column. The source of each transistor is coupled with a source line corresponding to the specific row of the transistor. The row and column <b>programming</b> <b>switches</b> are utilized to select and program a desired floating-gate transistor. In an indirect programming method, two transistors share a floating gate, such that programming a programmer transistor modifies the current of an agent transistor, which {{is attached to the}} circuit, thereby permitting run-time programming.

5000|$|While a {{computer}} {{may be viewed}} as running one gigantic program stored in its main memory, in some systems it is necessary to give the appearance of running several programs simultaneously. This is achieved by multitasking i.e. having the computer switch rapidly between running each program in turn. One means by which this is done is with a special signal called an interrupt, which can periodically cause the computer to stop executing instructions where it was and do something else instead. By remembering where it was executing prior to the interrupt, the computer can return to that task later. If several programs are running [...] "at the same time". then the interrupt generator might be causing several hundred interrupts per second, causing a <b>program</b> <b>switch</b> each time. Since modern computers typically execute instructions several orders of magnitude faster than human perception, it may appear that many programs are running at the same time even though only one is ever executing in any given instant. This method of multitasking is sometimes termed [...] "time-sharing" [...] since each program is allocated a [...] "slice" [...] of time in turn.|$|E

PBX FEATURES The PBX is a stored <b>program</b> <b>switch</b> similar to a Class 5 switch. It is usually used within a medium- to-large-sized business for employee telephony service. Since a PBX is typically operated by a single private organization, there are a wide variety of PBX services and features. Custom configurations are common.

The user can observe the aggregate uncontrolled load curve of the households in the controlled area, and proceed with the optimization of <b>switching</b> <b>programs.</b> The <b>switching</b> <b>program</b> optimizer receives I/O 3 and produces <b>switching</b> <b>programs</b> based on the user-defined parameters (the desired peak reduction target, control periods etc.). The best <b>switching</b> <b>programs</b> are presented to the user, so that he/she can select the most suitable <b>switching</b> <b>program.</b> The hot water cylinder model then calculates controlled water heating loads (I/O 5) by applying the user-selected <b>switching</b> <b>program</b> (I/O 4) to the hot water consumption profiles (I/O 2).
