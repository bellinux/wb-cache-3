40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} random {{shuffling}} scheme to apply with adaptive sorting algorithms. Adaptive sorting algorithms utilize the presortedness <b>present</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> given sequence. We have probabilistically increased the amount of presortedness <b>present</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> sequence by using a random shuffling technique that requires little computation. Theoretical analysis suggests that the proposed scheme can improve the performance of adaptive sorting. Experimental results show that it significantly reduces the amount of disorder <b>present</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> given sequence and improves the execution time of adaptive sorting algorithm as well.

5|$|A {{wide range}} of {{theological}} and philosophical ideas are presented through Krishna in Hindu texts. Ramanuja, a Hindu theologian whose works were influential in Bhakti movement, presented him in terms of qualified monism (Vishishtadvaita). Madhvacharya, a Hindu philosopher whose works led to the founding of Haridasa sect of Vaishnavism, presented Krishna {{in the framework of}} dualism (Dvaita). Jiva Goswami, a saint from Gaudiya Vaishnava school, described Krishna theology in terms of Bhakti yoga and Achintya Bheda Abheda. Krishna theology is <b>presented</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> pure monism (advaita, called shuddhadvaita) framework by Vallabha Acharya, who was the founder of Pushti sect of vaishnavism. Madhusudana Sarasvati, an India philospher, presented Krishna theology in nondualism-monism framework (Advaita Vedanta), while Adi Shankara, who is credited for unifying and establishing the main currents of thought in Hinduism, mentioned Krishna in his early eighth-century discussions on Panchayatana puja.|$|E

Instead of presenting the battles as political and moral issues, Jackson felt racial context and relevance needed to be <b>presented</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> more forward way. As a result, in 2000, he recrafted the United States Department of the Interior's appropriation to include a directive to have United States Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt use his influence over the superintendents of the national parks to encourage greater inclusion of slavery and social issues in Civil War presentations.|$|E

5|$|Cladistic {{analyses}} of tyrannosaurid phylogeny often find Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus to be sister taxa, with Daspletosaurus more basal than either. A {{close relationship between}} Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus is supported by numerous skull features, including the pattern of sutures between certain bones, {{the presence of a}} crescent-shaped crest on the postorbital bone behind each eye, and a very deep maxilla with a noticeable downward curve on the lower edge, among others. An alternative hypothesis was <b>presented</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> 2003 study by Phil Currie and colleagues, which found weak support for Daspletosaurus as a basal member of a clade also including Tarbosaurus and Alioramus, both from Asia, based on the absence of a bony prong connecting the nasal and lacrimal bones. Alioramus was found to be the closest relative of Tarbosaurus in this study, based on a similar pattern of stress distribution in the skull.|$|E

A committee was formed to propose founding a company in which SAT and the state were both involved. The proposal was <b>presented</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> meeting on 20 March. The name of the company was Oy Yhteissisu Ab ("mutual Sisu"), which meant the intention was joint production of Sisu vehicles. The private owners were A.

Rosenlew & Co., Suomen Autoteollisuus, Suomen Gummitehdas, Suomen Kaapelitehdas, Tampereen Pellava- ja Rauta-Teollisuus, Yhtyneet Paperitehtaat and Strömberg.
