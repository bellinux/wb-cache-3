Afterwards, signal processing is accomplished by using wavelet transformation and we preliminarily find a kind of acousto-elastic sensitive concrete material which is comparatively sensitive to stress. This kind of material is produced by mixing epoxy resin, styrene-acrylic emulsion, acrylic emulsion, auxiliaries and iron powder into cement concrete together. The sensitivity of ultrasound and stress {{of this kind of}} modified concrete behaves preferably well as follows: at the low stress stage, not only the correlativity curve of ultrasound velocity and stress but also the correlativity curve of weighted spectrum area and stress arises apparently.

Since ilmenite mud is enriched in natural radionuclides, such as radium isotopes (2. 0 · 103 Bq kg− 1228 Ra and 5. 0 · 102 Bq kg− 1226 Ra), the IMC-SPCs were subjected to leaching experiments, which showed their environmental impact to be negligible.

40|$|Organic substances, {{particularly}} polymers, {{are finding}} increasing use in modifying {{the properties of}} cements and concrete. Although {{a significant amount of}} research has been conducted into the modification of the mechanical properties of <b>cements</b> by <b>polymers,</b> {{little is known about the}} nature of the interface and interactions taking place between the two phases. This thesis addresses the problem of elucidating such interactions. Relevant literature is reviewed, covering the general use of <b>polymers</b> with <b>cements,</b> the chemistry of <b>cements</b> and <b>polymers,</b> adhesion and known interactions between <b>polymers</b> and both <b>cements</b> and related minerals. Although several polymer systems were studied, two in particular were selected, as being well characterized. These were: - 1) polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), the polymer derived from methyl methacrylate (MMA), and 2) an amine-cured epoxy resin system. By this approach, a methodology was developed for the examination of other polymer/cement interactions. Experiments were conducted in five main areas:- 1) polymer-cement adhesion and the feasibility of revealing interfacial regions mechanically, 2) chemical reactions between <b>polymers</b> and <b>cements,</b> 3) characterization of cement adhesion surfaces, 4) interactions affecting overall polymerisation rates, and 5) studies of <b>polymer</b> impregnated <b>cements.</b> The following conclusions were reached:- 1) The PMMA/cement interface contains calcium methacrylate as an interfacial reaction product, water being a reactant. Calcium methacrylate is detrimental to the properties of PMMA/cement composites, being highly water-soluble. 2) The pore surface of cement accelerates the polymerisation of MMA, leading to an increased molecular weight compared to polymerisation of pure MMA, minerals in hydrated cement powders having the opposite effect. 3) The investigation of reaction products presents a number of experimental problems, selection of appropriate techniques depending upon the system studied. For the two systems examined in detail, ion chromatography proved particularly useful; DTA, IRS and XPS indicated reactions, though the data was hard to interpret; XRD proving inconclusive. 4) It is impractical to reveal interfacial regions mechanically, but may be accomplished by chemical means...|$|R

We all know that this is important [...] in fact, required to keep the industry healthy. The objective must be to continuously develop technology which will do things better for less money. This is the ultimate goal of research. I've been asked to comment on production research issues. And so, I will limit my discussion to just that. I think what we've heard {{in the last few days}} concerning cements, waste processing, and scale prediction is encouraging. In particular, the work that is being conducted on <b>polymer</b> <b>cements</b> may be of significant importance. As you may know, many parts of The Geysers and other fields are incurring high corrosion rates. The question before us is, do we plug and abandon these wells? Install hangdown strings of small diameter liner using expensive metallurgy such as Inconnel, Hastelloy or Titanium? Or, drill new wells? With current economics, it behooves them to seek the least expensive option which can extend the economic life of these deteriorating facilities. Our current option may be to run inner-liners utilizing these new <b>polymer</b> <b>cements.</b> However, Coatings can be damaged and the smaller diameter inner-liner can significantly reduce the amount of steam produced. I would like to suggest to Research, that you investigate or develop alternative means of placing cements or modified coatings directly down-hole onto the corroded casing itself. Inexpensive treatments may be the only salvation for these marginal producers during these times. How can we accomplish this? Some methods we might consider include: spray coating down-hole, or displace and plug techniques. Polymer curing might be accomplished with the use of down-hole heaters. Obviously, there are many options and details which remain to be worked out. But, it is clear that a simple and inexpensive technique would enhance the economic viability of existing geothermal projects. It is important to remember that these coatings need not provide indefinite erosion/corrosion protection. It is possible that re-coating may be required on a periodic basis, if cost permits. The bottom-line objective here is to extend the life of the project...|$|R

40|$|<b>Polymer</b> {{modified}} <b>cements</b> and mortars {{have become}} popular {{for use as}} patch repair materials. General evidence suggests that these materials offer considerable improvements compared to traditional mortars although the mechanisms for this are not fully understood.

In view of {{the wide range of}} commercial systems available, investigations concentrated on the use of three of the most commonly available groups of polymers. These were: (1) Styrene Butadiene Rubber (SBR), (2) Acrylics and, (3) Ethylene Vinyl Acetates (EVA). The later two were in the form of both emulsions and redispersible powders.

The following main conclusions were reached: (1) The addition of polymer emulsions have a considerable influence on the workability of fresh cement pastes, the extent of this {{depending on the type of}} system used. (2) The rheological parameters of fresh polymer modified mortars can be established using a two-point workability test which may be used when comparing the properties of different systems at constant workability. (3) Curing conditions affect the properties of polymer modified systems and a wet/dry curing regime was essential for good adhesion of these materials to mortar substrates. (4) In contrast, the wet/dry curing regime resulted in a curing affected zone at the surface of patch materials. This can result in a much coarser pore structure and enhanced diffusion of e. g. chloride ions.
