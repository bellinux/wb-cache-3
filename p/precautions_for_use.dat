Because of its mercury content, cinnabar can be toxic to human beings. Though people in ancient South America often used cinnabar for art, or processed it into refined mercury (as a means to gild silver and gold to objects) [...] "the toxic properties of mercury were well known. It was dangerous to those who mined and processed cinnabar, it caused shaking, loss of sense, and death.

40|$|There is {{consensus}} in Turkey that the archiving studies {{started in the}} second half of the XIXth century. The historical signs of these studies go back to beginning of the XVth century. It is seen that there is necessity for modern archiving since the documents preserved in sealed sacks and chests in rolls has died out because of negligence and bad conditions. These studies had been continued only with a view to preservation-protection with various attempts until the declaration of Turkish Republic. In this period; the most important attempt in Turkish archiving was founding Hazine-i Evrak in 1846 and collecting the governmental documents there. In Turkish Republic period; the Turkish National Assembly protected the documents of Bab-ı Ali Hazine-i Evrakı, important ministries and institutions after the abolition of Ottoman Sultanate on November 1, 1922. On March 1, 1923, “Mahzen-i Evrak Mümeyyizliği”, which was attached to the Office of the Executive Assistant of Turkish National Assembly Cabinet of Government Ministers, was founded. This situation formed the core of today’s General Directorate of State Archives. The documents taken over from the Ottoman Empire and the documents produced by the institutions of Turkish Republic had been passed through various cleaning and destruction methods until 1931. The most important one of this is; the sale of nearly 1, 5 million documents, most of which belonging to the Ministry of Finance, 30 - 50 tons in weight, to Bulgaria in May 1931 and the developments after this event. This event was experienced due to “negligence and indifference” and “deficiency of regulations” which had caused loss of many documents before. After this distressing event, legal <b>precautions</b> <b>for</b> not destructing of the state documents were taken, but the private archives were not included in the frame of these precautions. In order not to experience such events, controlling important – unimportant governmental documents of private persons and institutions and taking necessary legal <b>precautions</b> <b>for</b> <b>using</b> them against to the government are necessary.

Available data suggest that combination therapies are more efficacious than monotherapies, reflecting the complementarity of mechanisms of action. Information on side effects remains contradictory, and tolerability of these combinations may vary between different patient groups. In some studies, tolerability is equivalent to that seen with monotherapy; in others a high rate of adverse events has led to frequent treatment discontinuation. Dermatological reactions may be a specific side effect of these combination therapies. Combination therapy is considered justified for treatment of patients diagnosed early who are at risk for rapid progression and for patients who fail to respond to monotherapy. The majority of participants favored adding biological agents to a previously established leflunomide monotherapy rather than starting both treatments simultaneously. On the other hand, combination therapy should be considered with caution in patients with a history of treatment failure, with hepatic comorbidity, or with other autoimmune disease, and in immunocompromised patients. When considering initiation of combination therapy, it is important to provide full information to the patient on the potential benefits and risks of such treatment and to integrate patients as far as possible into the decision-making process...|$|E

Methods: Inclusion criteria consisted of OTC herbal remedies meant for use in diabetes. They were bought from local Sri Lankan super markets and non-Ayurvedic pharmacies and product information regarding the risk of hypoglycaemia, <b>precautions</b> <b>for</b> <b>use,</b> adverse events, dose and interactions were assessed using a scoring system. The accuracy of the information was then compared against published data. Results: Eleven products fulfilled the inclusion criteria.

40|$|Reliability {{tests are}} {{designed}} to reproduce failures of a product which can occur in actual use. Understanding failure mechanisms {{from the results of}} reliability testing is extremely important to know the product is reliable in actual use. The effect of stresses (temperature, humidity, voltage, current etc.) on the occurrence of failures can be identified by understanding the failure mechanisms. The product reliability in actual use can be predicted from the results of the reliability tests, which are conducted under accelerated conditions. Reliability-affecting problems of the product can also be identified by clarifying the failure mechanisms. Such information is useful in improving the product design and manufacturing processes to enhance the product reliability and quality, as well as in determining <b>precautions</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> which must be made clear to the customers. Reliability testing also provides useful information for the manufacturer to screen products using an optimal method selected according to the identified failure mechanisms. Furthermore, {{in the event of a}} failure reported in the market, understanding of the failure mechanisms enables the manufacturer to take prompt and proper measures for correcting the design and/or manufacturing processes, so that the recurrence of the failure can be prevented.

40|$|The TRMM Global Validation Program {{is giving}} us a unique {{opportunity}} to compare radar datasets from different sites since they are analyzed in a relatively uniform procedure. Monthly Ze-R relations for four different sites (i. e, Melbourne Florida, Houston Texas, Darwin Australia and Kwajalein Atoll) were derived. The relations were obtained using the Window Probability Matching Method (WPMM). This version of the PMM relies on matching unconditional probabilities of rain rates, R, and radar reflectivity, Ze, using rain gauge and radar data, respectively. This procedure was done separately for convective and stratiform rain type using the Steiner classification procedure. The radar and gauge data from all sites were quality controlled using the same algorithms, which include also an automatic procedure to filter unreliable rain gauge data upon comparison to radar data. An adjusted power law Z-R for each rain type was also derived by comparing the radar-gauge coincident pairs in order to adjust the total monthly rainfall to match the gauges. The obtained PMM based Ze-R relations are found to be curved lines in log-log space rather than any straight line power law. While the PMM based Ze-R curves were always distinctly different between the convective and stratiform rain, the power law based Z-R, in few cases, was found to be the same for both types. In general, a given reflectivity was matched to a much lower rain intensity in the convective rainfall as compared to that in stratiform rainfall. These findings are inherently contradictory to previous findings based on disdrometer data and suggest some <b>precaution</b> <b>for</b> <b>using</b> the latter Z-R relations on radar data when the partition of stratiform and convective rainfall amount is in concern. The inverse trends in the relations might be caused by effects such as partial beam fillings, the use of different classification schemes, as well as having a distinct difference in the Z-R relations between the initial convective and the trailing transition regions as suggested by recent findings...|$|R

40|$|Atrial {{fibrillation}} (AF) is {{the most}} frequently encoun-tered sustained arrhythmia in clinical practice andaccounts for more physician visits and hospital days than any other cardiac arrhythmia. 1 Although it is usually not life-threatening, AF is associated with substantial mor-bidity and increased mortality, {{largely because of the}} in-creased risk of stroke and thromboembolic events. 2 – 4 Maintenance of sinus rhythm by means of cardioversion and use of antiarrhythmic drugs is often the initial therapy for AF, 5 although the results of recent randomized con-trolled trials have cast doubt on whether rhythm control should be routinely applied in patients with atrial fibrilla-tion or flutter. 6, 7 Several factors are offered as justification for the use of antiarrhythmic drug therapy: symptoms can substantially impair quality of life, 8, 9 lack of active atrial transport and irregular, frequently rapid ventricular rates may result in reduced exercise capacity, dyspnea and car-diomyopathy; and the risk of stroke and thromboembolism is increased, owing to incomplete atrial emptying and stasis in the noncontracting atria. 10 Of the antiarrhythmic agents approved for use in Cana-da, 5 are prescribed relatively commonly. All 5 are indica-ted for ventricular arrhythmias, and 2 (flecainide and quini-dine) are approved for supraventricular arrhythmias (SVA) in patients without structural heart disease.

40|$|On June 10, 2005, a tetanus toxoid, reduced {{diphtheria}} toxoid and acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap) formulated {{for use in}} adults and adolescents was licensed in the United States for persons aged 11 [...] 64 years (ADACEL, manufactured by sanofi pasteur, Toronto, Ontario, Canada). Prelicensure studies demonstrated safety and efficacy, inferred through immunogenicity, against tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis when Tdap was administered as a single booster dose to adults. To reduce pertussis morbidity among adults and maintain the standard of care for tetanus and diphtheria prevention and to reduce the transmission of pertussis to infants and in health-care settings, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that: 1) adults aged 19 [...] 64 years should receive a single dose of Tdap to replace tetanus and {{diphtheria toxoid}}s vaccine (Td) for booster immunization against tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis if they received their last dose of Td > 10 years earlier {{and they have not}} previously received Tdap; 2) intervals shorter than 10 years since the last Td may be used for booster protection against pertussis; 3) adults who have or who anticipate having close contact with an infant aged < 12 months (e. g., parents, grandparents aged < 65 years, child-care providers, and health-care personnel) should receive a single dose of Tdap to reduce the risk for transmitting pertussis. An interval as short as 2 years from the last Td is suggested; shorter intervals can be used. When possible, women should receive Tdap before becoming pregnant. Women who have not previously received Tdap should receive a dose of Tdap in the immediate postpartum period; 4) health-care personnel who work in hospitals or ambulatory care settings and have direct patient contact should receive a single dose of Tdap as soon as feasible if they have not previously received Tdap. An interval as short as 2 years from the last dose of Td is recommended; shorter intervals may be used. These recommendations for use of Tdap in health-care personnel are supported by the Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC). This statement 1) reviews pertussis, tetanus and diphtheria vaccination policy in the United States; 2) describes the clinical features and epidemiology of pertussis among adults; 3) summarizes the immunogenicity, efficacy, and safety data of Tdap; and 4) presents recommendations for the use of Tdap among adults aged 19 [...] 64 years.

Control of air {{concentrations in the}} workplace so they do not exceed 2 parts per million (ppm) in 45 liters is discussed. Medical requirements of the standard, including preplacement and annual physicals, counseling regarding use of alcohol and barbiturates, {{and the maintenance of}} medical records also are discussed together with labelling requirements for shipping and storage containers, and for areas of occupational exposure. Clothing and equipment are described for protection of eyes and respiratory system, together with gloves, aprons, and footwear. The need for employee education regarding the hazards, signs, and symptoms of overexposure, emergency procedures, and proper conditions and <b>precautions</b> <b>for</b> safe <b>use</b> of carbon tetrachloride is considered. Work practices, including the control of airborne contamination, contact with skin and eyes, emergency procedures, cleaning of spills, housekeeping procedures, personal hygiene, access to regulated areas, and control of soiled clothing are described. Sanitation requirements are presented for washing facilities, clothing and locker facilities, and smoking restrictions. Record keeping and exposure monitoring procedures are reviewed. The author notes that the carbon-tetrachloride standard is designed to protect {{the health and safety of}} workers up to 10 hours per day, 40 hours per week, over a working lifetime.

40|$|Oxcarbazepine (OXC) is {{indicated}} for treating partial-onset {{with or without}} secondary generalized tonic-clonic seizures, in both adults and children aged over 6 years, as monotherapy or adjuvant therapy. Trials data and extensive clinical experience demonstrate generally good tolerability and antiepileptic efficacy similar to carbamazepine (CBZ), sodium valproate or phenytoin. Since the UK launch of OXC in March 2000, UK collaborators have pooled experience to optimize prescribing recommendations for adults. Many patients are successfully managed using the prescribing information recommended titration schedule. However, evolving clinical experience suggests a slower introduction is preferable (e. g. 150 mg day one, then 300 mg daily, increased by 300 mg weekly) both for monotherapy and adjuvant therapy. Overnight 'switch' from CBZ to OXC (using CBZ:OXC ratio of 1 : 1. 5) has been <b>used</b> <b>for</b> patients responsive to CBZ, but with dose-related side-effects. Owing to individual variations in CBZ enzyme autoinduction, however, overnight switching is advised only for those on CBZ < 800 mg daily; otherwise, slower switching is recommended. OXC {{is not the first}} choice alternative for patients developing a CBZ rash owing to increased OXC rash rate in CBZ sensitive subjects. Hyponatraemia may be more common (albeit often asymptomatic) than trials data suggest, especially in the elderly. Serum sodium monitoring is unnecessary, however, unless relevant risk factors or pointers exist. Severe haematological dyscrasias have not been reported with OXC. The enzyme inducing interaction of OXC with ethinyloestradiol and levonorgestrel necessitates additional <b>precautions</b> <b>for</b> women <b>using</b> hormonal contraception...|$|R
