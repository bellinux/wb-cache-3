50|$|A {{safety issue}} is that the cooking time given on the {{packaging}} {{does not apply to}} all microwave ovens. Setting the timer and coming back later, after the timer's alarm has sounded, could result in the popcorn being burnt and smoking badly. Microwave popcorn makers suggest that the person cooking the popcorn stay near the oven to observe the popcorn as it cooks, and take the <b>popcorn</b> <b>out</b> when the time between pops is more than a few seconds.|$|E

So Chip n Dale cover Donald's house with a storm of popcorn they got from 2 boxes and Donald ends up cleaning <b>popcorn</b> <b>out</b> of his driveway.|$|E
50|$|The Demon Cockroaches first {{appeared}} when the Monster in the Darkness left {{a bowl of}} <b>popcorn</b> <b>out</b> {{in the living room}} instead of taking it back to the kitchen like he was supposed to. These shoe-sized red cockroaches follow Redcloak and Xykon around. They enjoy watching the carnage and destruction that Xykon brings with him, though Xykon and Redcloak usually ignore their existence. The extent of their interaction is limited to Redcloak's annoyance and setting of Roach Motels and Xykon's betting with one. They often make sarcastic comments at the seemingly absurd actions of Xykon and Redcloak a la Mystery Science Theater 3000, similar to the insect banter in the margins of Cricket Magazine. Although they are usually side characters, they sometimes take part in the comic's action. For instance, in one strip, Miko uses one of the roaches to escape a forcecage by making the roach breathe fire, lighting a Molotov cocktail made from her cloak and a bottle of dwarven brandy.|$|E

50|$|Since 1854, the {{ancestors}} of Richard Kelty (1936-2015) had been growing a heirloom <b>popcorn</b> variety <b>out</b> of small kernels, whose hulls would disintegrate after being popped, resulting in a richer taste. The popcorn had been introduced to the Kelty family by Native Americans, who shared it with them. The Kelty family had never sold the popcorn, which was only grown for personal consumption.|$|R
5000|$|Smartfood {{was first}} created in 1985 by Andrew Martin, Ken Meyers, and Martin's wife Annie Withey in Hampton, Connecticut. It was {{intended}} to fill recloseable packages that Martin and his business partner, Ken Meyers, were trying to market. Meyers was quoted in The New York Times as saying that [...] "the <b>popcorn</b> turned <b>out</b> better than the package." [...] Smartfood was first marketed under the registered brand name in 1985, and was manufactured in Marlborough, Massachusetts.|$|R
50|$|In 1999 and 2003, the cup made {{a trip to}} Joe Nieuwendyk's alma mater, Cornell University, {{both times}} visiting a local college bar. In 2003, Martin Brodeur ate <b>popcorn</b> <b>out</b> of the Cup. It had butter stains and salt damage for the next eight days before Jamie Langenbrunner cleaned it. In 2003, the Cup was slated to make its first-ever visit to Slovakia with New Jersey Devils' Jiri Bicek, but was left behind in Canada; {{it was on the}} next flight out of Toronto. Finally, on August 22, 2004, Walter Neubrand, keeper of the Cup, boarded a plane to Fort St. John, British Columbia, to deliver it to Tampa Bay Lightning head scout Jake Goertzen. However, Air Canada {{officials}} at Vancouver International Airport removed it before takeoff because of weight restrictions. The Cup spent the night in the luggage area, 1,200 km away. It was flown to Fort St. John the following day.|$|E
5000|$|While {{the team}} celebrates its success, Lazlo {{insists that the}} high-energy laser can only {{be used as a}} weapon, and in fact that it must have been {{conceived}} for this purpose. Chris is devastated. Hathaway has removed the laser from the lab. Chris, Mitch, Ick and Jordan trick Kent into revealing the date when the laser is going to be tested by placing a microphone in his braces and convincing him that God is talking to him. The group tails Hathaway to a nearby Air Force base. While Chris and Mitch talk their way onto the base, Lazlo remotely cracks the laser's computer and changes its target coordinates to Hathaway's house, where the team has placed a huge tin of popcorn. Meanwhile, Chris and Mitch remove circuits that prevent the laser from overheating. When the laser beam hits the house, it is diffused by a prism placed by Chris and the popcorn heats and expands; the house bursts at the seams as popcorn pours out onto the lawn. Kent [...] "rides" [...] the flowing <b>popcorn</b> <b>out</b> of the front door unharmed and laughing, thinking the incident was religious in nature. The group, reveling in their success, greet an arriving Lazlo accompanied by Sherry, riding in a motor home pulling a trailer full of prizes he won in a sweepstakes. He and Sherry indicate they intend to run off together as he is the genius she's been looking for all this time. Hathaway arrives home and in disbelief, assesses his ruined home.|$|E

5000|$|She {{left her}} public {{relations}} job in 1947 to concentrate full-time on writing, though she occasionally taught classes and led writing workshops. Her many books written under {{her own name}} include the [...] "Ginny" [...] and [...] "Cathy" [...] series. As Thayer, she wrote such books as Sandy and the Seventeen Balloons (1955), Quiet on Account of Dinosaur (1964), and Mr. Turtle's Magic Glasses (1971). Her last book for children, The <b>Popcorn</b> Dragon, came <b>out</b> in 1989. That year she also published her one book for adults, Writing for Children.|$|R
5000|$|Glenn Kenny of The New York Times {{gave the}} film a {{positive}} review writing, [...] "This movie is, it happens, easier {{to sit through}} than the 2014 film", while also adding that [...] "The 3-D action, overseen by the director Dave Green, is not wholly incoherent. The production values (showcasing new mutants and many gear-heavy extra-dimensional machines undreamed of in any actual engineering philosophy) are ultrashiny. And there are {{even a couple of}} amusing, albeit unmemorable, sight gags and one-liners." [...] Edward Douglas of New York Daily News gave the film three out of five stars, saying, [...] "As with the best <b>popcorn</b> flicks, <b>Out</b> of the Shadows offers plenty of mindless entertainment and mind-numbing silliness that somehow works well enough to leave even the Ninja Turtles' biggest detractors shell-shocked." [...] Michael O'Sullivan of The Washington Post praised the film's action sequences and story while overall writing that, [...] "Out of the Shadows is, at least, deliciously silly, even if it is also decidedly forgettable. Like a well-plated but nutrition-free meal, it registers on the senses while being bad for you." ...|$|R
50|$|In early {{formulations}} {{it often}} contained white asbestos fibers. When asbestos was banned in ceiling treatments by the Clean Air Act of 1978 in the United States, <b>popcorn</b> ceilings fell <b>out</b> of favor {{in much of}} the country. However, in order to minimize economic hardship to suppliers and installers, existing inventories of asbestos-bearing texturing materials were exempt from the ban, so it is possible to find asbestos in popcorn ceilings that were applied through the 1980s. After the ban, popcorn ceiling materials were created using a paper-based or Styrofoam product to create the texture, rather than asbestos. Textured ceilings remain common in residential construction in the United States.|$|R
5000|$|Barney Bear is {{selected}} by a drawn Draft Number to {{enlist in the}} army. His hibernation is interrupted when a telegram is delivered to him and, misinterpreting {{the words on the}} telegram, assumes it's an actual vacation. Barney enters the base with vacation supplies, but discovers his true purpose when bumping into the heavy artillery and is refused departure. He enlists through answering [...] "simple" [...] questions, having his photo taken, his physicality examined, his flat feet inflated, his teeth fixed and in the end, when he's passed all his exams, has his butt stamped. He finally gets his uniform, gun and gas mask [...] "which is thoroughly tested". After putting on a pair of heavy shoes, Barney goes marching for 10,000 miles, but is tired (as well as his shoes, literally) after just 10 miles. His shoes get hotter and hotter until they sprout <b>out</b> <b>popcorn.</b> The whole thing {{turns out to be a}} dream when a spit from Barney's fireplace wakes him up by burning his rear. Before Barney can go back to sleep, he receives a telegram telling him to enlist in the army, along with a P.S., saying [...] "And this time, buddy, it ain't no dream!", much to Barney's dismay.|$|R
5000|$|Tom watches {{clips of}} himself {{attempting}} to catch Jerry, {{the first of}} which is from [...] "Part Time Pal" [...] where Tom chases Jerry until he is hit in a wall and Jerry then proceeds to eat a corn as Tom drags it and gives chase. Jerry escapes by knocking all milk bottles, and Tom later pauses the clip. The next clip is from [...] "Nit-Witty Kitty" [...] in the scene where Tom is eating cheese in a plank and Jerry throws a bowling ball in the seesaw and Tom is hit in the ceiling until the ball hits him and Tom pauses this. The next clip is from [...] "Johann Mouse" [...] where Tom slides into the stairs to get Jerry, but he is hit in the window and falls, Tom rewinds this and checks the heights and measurements of the disaster. Jerry comes out of his hole and sees [...] "The Yankee Doodle Mouse" [...] clips, he smiles and drags out a tub of <b>popcorn</b> and brings <b>out</b> a telescope, the next clip is from [...] "Heavenly Puss", in the part when Tom tries to catch Jerry before Tom got hit by a piano. Tom rewinds the clip to where he just begins pulling up the carpet, and he replays the scene a second time. When Jerry starts laughing, Tom turns from making his calculations and spots the laughing mouse. He chases Jerry, but hits his head on a wall.|$|R
