5000|$|The Dupont Viscoloid Company, Inc. is {{a former}} {{plastics}} manufacturer based in Leominster, Massachusetts. [...] The company was founded by Alexander Paton, Ludwig Stross and Bernard W. Doyle in 1901 as the Sterling Comb Company. [...] In 1912, the three men consolidated a number of smaller plastics manufactures under the name Viscoloid Company. [...] The company pioneered the use of <b>pyroxylin</b> plastic in hair combs, toilet articles, {{and a number of}} different products. In 1914, the Viscoloid Company began marketing <b>pyroxylin</b> plastic toys. [...] The toy industry quickly became the company’s most profitable, and the Viscoloid was soon the leading <b>pyroxylin</b> plastic toy manufacturer in America. [...] By 1923, Bernard Doyle had taken over the company and “The Viscoloid” spanned 106 buildings and was the largest employer in Leominster. [...] In 1925, the company was sold to the Dupont Company of Leominster and was renamed the Dupont Viscoloid Company, Inc. [...] The company would continually be a giant in the plastics industry until closing in November 1977.|$|E

[...] The largest plastic manufacturer in the city was the Viscoloid Company founded by Bernard Wendell Doyle in 1901. [...] In 1914, the Viscoloid Company pioneered making toys out of <b>pyroxylin</b> plastic, and by 1923 the company was the largest employer in Leominster.

50|$|Parkesine is the {{trademark}} {{for the first}} man-made plastic, nitrocellulose. It was patented by Alexander Parkes in 1862. In 1866 Parkes formed the Parkesine Company to mass-produce the material. The company, however, failed due to poor product quality as Parkes tried to reduce costs. Parkesine's successors were Xylonite, produced by Daniel Spill (an associate of Parkes), and Celluloid from John Wesley Hyatt. Parkesine was made from cellulose treated with nitric acid and a solvent. The generic name of Parkesine is <b>pyroxylin,</b> or Celluloid. Parkesine is often called synthetic ivory. The Parkesine company ceased trading in 1868. Pictures of Parkesine are held by the Plastics Historical Society of London. There is a plaque {{on the wall of}} the site of the Parkesine Works in Hackney, London.|$|E
5000|$|Bernard Wendall Doyle (1873 - December 26, 1949) was an American {{industrialist}} and philanthropist. In 1901, Doyle cofounded the Viscoloid Company in Leominster, Massachusetts. [...] Doyle helped pioneer {{the use of}} <b>pyroxylin</b> plastic {{for making}} hair combs and accessories. [...] Soon the Viscoloid Company would expand into a range of products {{and became one of}} the leading pyroxlyin plastic manufactures in the country. [...] Doyle would also help found the Merchants National Bank of Leominster in 1912. [...] By 1923, Doyle had become chief executive of the entire Viscoloid Company and by that same year, the company had a capital of three million dollars and employed over 60% of the Leominster workforce. In 1925, he sold his interest of the Viscoloid Company to Dupont de Nemours. Bernard Doyle remained on as vice-president of the renamed Dupont Viscoloid Company until his retirement. The Leominster complex was also renamed the “Doyle Works” of the Dupont Viscoloid Company. Throughout his life Bernard Doyle {{was one of the most}} prominent and philanthropic citizens Central Massachusetts has ever seen. He served as the second Leominster city mayor from 1920-1924, as well as donating the entire Doyle Field athletic complex to the city in 1931. He also contributed generously to Leominster Hospital, the Notown Reservoir, St. Leo’s Church in Leominster and countless other ventures throughout north central Massachusetts. At the time of his death, Doyle was a director of the Merchants National Bank of Boston, Boston Edison Company, Boston and Maine Railroad, Massachusetts Life Insurance Company of Springfield, member of the Finance Committee of the United States Rubber Company, directory of the Safety Fund National Bank of Fitchburg, and vice-president of the Independent Lock Company of Fitchburg. [...] Doyle was also a trustee of both Northeastern University and Cushing Academy. [...] Bernard Doyle first married Elizabeth Haley, together they had two daughters: Marjorie Doyle Rockwell and Louise Doyle. [...] After his wife’s death, Doyle remarried in 1949 to Rachel Butler. Bernard Doyle died on December 26, 1949.|$|E
40|$|Using the {{broadening}} of {{the electron}} paramagentic resonance (EPR) linewidth of paramagnetic particles by oxygen, {{it is possible to}} make measurements of the partial pressure of oxygen in vivo. While the results obtained so far with EPR oximetry are very encouraging, several paramagnetic materials may lose their responsiveness to oxygen in tissues. This aim {{of this study was to}} provide evidence that an appropriate coating can preserve the oxygen sensitivity of paramagnetic materials in vivo. Two charcoals that have the oxygen-sensing properties required for EPR oximetry (combined with a tendency to lose responsiveness to oxygen when placed in tissues) were coated using <b>pyroxylin.</b> Sensitivity to variations in pO 2 was checked by inducing hypoxia in the muscles of mice injected with charcoal. While the uncoated material lost responsiveness to oxygen within few days, the particles coated with 20 - 30 % of <b>pyroxylin</b> did not lose their responsiveness for more than 2 months...|$|E
40|$|The {{technique}} of replica casting {{of ceramic materials}} and the various methods of mounting and examination are described. Co-ordination of optical properties of the peels and X-ray analysis is considered. The uses of peels in showing orientation of clays settled under gravitation and also effects of plastic deformation are discussed. HISTORY The peeling of <b>pyroxylin</b> or other films from the surfaces of petri-factions has long {{been used in the}} microscopical study of fossil plants. The history of the technique was summarized by Appel (1933). The technique was applied to soft ores by Appel (op. cit.) and to clays by Weatherhead (1940). Weatherhead noticed that detrital quartz-grains remained included in his micro-preparations, and this obser-vation led Williamson (1941) to use a comparable method for eluci-dating the effects of processing-operations (filter-pressing, casting, extrusion, mechanical spreading, etc.) on the arrangement of the non-plastic particles in electrical porcelain and other ceramic "bodies. " These particles had been comminuted by ball-mills and other devices, and most of them were quartz or calcined flint as flattened chips and feldspar as cleavage-fragments. Because of their tendency to flatness they developed epositional or flow planar parallelisms in response to processing-operations, e. g., to filter-pressing or extrusion re-spectively. They were oriented within clay-aggregates where the basal planes of the clay-minerals were in some accord with the major surfaces of the included particles; thus a general planar parallelism tended to appear throughout the composite mass (Williamson, 1947...|$|E
