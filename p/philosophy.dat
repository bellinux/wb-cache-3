5|$|Most of the {{discussion}} in this article has focused on one style or tradition of <b>philosophy</b> in modern Western culture, usually called analytic <b>philosophy</b> (sometimes described as Anglo-American <b>philosophy).</b> Many other schools of thought exist, however, which are sometimes subsumed under the broad (and vague) label of continental <b>philosophy.</b> In any case, though topics and methods here are numerous, {{in relation to the}} <b>philosophy</b> of mind the various schools that fall under this label (phenomenology, existentialism, etc.) can globally be seen to differ from the analytic school in that they focus less on language and logical analysis alone but also take in other forms of understanding human existence and experience. With reference specifically to {{the discussion}} of the mind, this tends to translate into attempts to grasp the concepts of thought and perceptual experience in some sense that does not merely involve the analysis of linguistic forms.|$|E

5|$|Anarky is {{a fictional}} character, {{appearing}} in comic books published by DC Comics. Co-created by Alan Grant and Norm Breyfogle, he {{first appeared in}} Detective Comics No. 608 (November 1989), as an adversary of Batman. Introduced as Lonnie Machin, a child prodigy with knowledge of radical <b>philosophy</b> and driven to overthrow governments to improve social conditions, stories revolving around Anarky often focus on political and philosophical themes. The character, who is named after the <b>philosophy</b> of anarchism, primarily espouses anti-statism; however, multiple social issues have been addressed through the character, including environmentalism, antimilitarism, economic inequality, and political corruption. Inspired by multiple sources, early stories featuring the character often included homages to political and philosophical books, and referenced anarchist philosophers and theorists. The inspiration {{for the creation of}} the character and its early development was based in Grant's personal interest in anti-authoritarian <b>philosophy</b> and politics. However, when Grant himself transitioned to the <b>philosophy</b> of Neo-Tech, developed by Frank R. Wallace, he shifted the focus of Anarky from a vehicle for socialist and populist <b>philosophy,</b> to rationalist, atheist, and free market thinking.|$|E
