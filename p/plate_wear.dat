5000|$|There are {{multiple}} designs of vehicle clutch, {{but most are}} based on one or more friction discs pressed tightly together or against a flywheel using springs. The friction material varies in composition depending on many considerations such as whether the clutch is [...] "dry" [...] or [...] "wet". Friction discs once contained asbestos, but this has been largely discontinued. Clutches found in heavy duty applications such as trucks and competition cars use ceramic plates that have a greatly increased friction coefficient. However, these have a [...] "grabby" [...] action generally considered unsuitable for passenger cars. The spring pressure is released when the clutch pedal is depressed thus either pushing or pulling the diaphragm of the pressure plate, depending on type.

Two types of HC refiners were investigated: the Andritz RTS refiner at the Hallstavik Mill and the Sprout-Bauer Twin 60 refiner at the Braviken Mill. The {{objective of the}} study was to clarify the relationship between the pulp properties and refining conditions such as electrical energy input, housing- and feed- pressure and <b>plate</b> <b>wear</b> in high consistency refining. The results of this project show that worn segments reduce the operating energy maximum input and the pulp and handsheet properties in negative aspects such as lower tensile- and tear index, and shorter average fibre length. Energy input is an important factor in the refining process and influence Canadian Standard Freeness and the tensile index as evident from the probability residuals. Housing pressure and feed pressure influence the pulp quality and should be adjusted in order to optimise the refining process, although the effect is not as great as for energy input or <b>plate</b> <b>wear.</b> The results of the study indicate that Braviken Mill is operating at its optimum for the parameters measured in this project. Hallstaviks goal, to avoid fibre shortening and to obtain better tensile index, can be reached by making slight changes in pressure condition. ...|$|E

A novel fault diagnosis method PSO-RVM based on relevance vector machines (RVM) with particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm for plunger pump in truck crane is proposed. The particle swarm optimization algorithm is utilized to determine the kernel width parameter of the kernel function in RVM, and the five two-class RVMs with binary tree architecture are trained to recognize the condition of mechanism. The proposed method is employed in the diagnosis of plunger pump in truck crane. The six states, including normal state, bearing inner race fault, bearing roller fault, plunger wear fault, thrust <b>plate</b> <b>wear</b> fault, and swash <b>plate</b> <b>wear</b> fault, are used to test the classification performance of the proposed PSO-RVM model, which compared with the classical models, such as back-propagation artificial neural network (BP-ANN), ant colony optimization artificial neural network (ANT-ANN), RVM, and support vectors, machines with particle swarm optimization (PSO-SVM), respectively. The experimental results show that the PSO-RVM is superior to the first three classical models, and has a comparative performance to the PSO-SVM, the corresponding diagnostic accuracy achieving as high as 99. 17 % and 99. 58 %, respectively. But the number of relevance vectors is far fewer than that of support vector, and the former is about 1 / 12 – 1 / 3 of the latter, which indicates that the proposed PSO-RVM model is more suitable for applications that require low complexity and real-time monitoring...|$|E

The relative velocity function of the plate to the workpiece is obtained through kinematic analyses in the mode of uncertain eccentricity plane lapping, and material removal rate (MRR) function and wear uniformity function were deduced based on Preston equation. Effects of the ratio and eccentricities on the wear uniformity are discussed in detail through MATLAB simulation. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the ratio k 1 of workpiece revolution speed to lapping plate is the key to decide whether the lapping plate is lapped uniformly. Theoretically, when k 1 1, Besides, a bit bigger eccentricity e 1 is propitious to the lapping uniformly of the lapping plate, and bigger eccentricity e 2 are also helpful to lapping uniformly of the lapping plate.

There is a great interest in using magnesium (Mg) alloys in the automotive industry due to greater environmental concern. Fuel resources are limited so it should be conserved and the harmful emissions in the environment should be reduced. Magnesium with a density of 1. 74 gm/cm 3 is a light metal and is suitable for automotive purpose. In this investigation the microstructure and properties of AE 42 magnesium alloy and its composites reinforced with saffil short (essentially d-Al 2 O 3) fibers and Sic particles has been studied.

Wear study is carried out on Ball on <b>Plate</b> <b>Wear</b> Tester at a normal load of 5 N and 10 N at rotational speed of 25 rpm.

40|$|Due {{to their}} simple design and easy {{maintainability}} jaw crushers {{are widely used}} as primary size reduction equipments in mechanical and mining industries. As jaw crushers break minerals & ores of high strength and the economy of many industries depends on its performance; {{it is essential to}} improve the efficiency of the present design. The kinematic analysis of single toggle jaw crusher shows that the forces on the moving jaw plate at different crank angle are different and hence power generated varies with crank angle. One way to increase the efficiency is to store the energy in a flywheel when the supply is more than the rate of consumption and to utilize the same when the supply falls down. Hence efforts are made to design a flywheel to minimize the wastage of power and to improvise the performance parameters of single toggle jaw crusher. Jaw <b>plate</b> <b>wear</b> has considerable affect on the life of jaw Crusher which is caused by the slipping motion between the fed material and the jaws. This wear is predominantly serious in the fixed plate and hence the liners of the fixed jaw should be properly chosen. In addition to this the toggle bar which acts as a safety lever has to be precisely designed. The design aspects of flywheel, spring of tension bar and toggle bar are discussed in this paper. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this dissertation is to study the effect of sensitization on the mechanical properties such as hardness and tensile strength of a non-conventional austenitic stainless steel with special emphasis on wear properties. A set of samples has been solution annealed by soaking the steel at 1050 °C followed by water quenching. On the other hand, {{a total of four}} sets of samples of the steel have been given sensitization treatment by holding at 7500 C temperature for different soaking time periods ranging from 1 to 7 hours followed by water quenching. The microstructures of both the solution annealed as well as sensitized samples have been observed by optical microscope. The mechanical testing such as microhardness and macrohardness as well as tensile testing of each specimen has been performed. The wear behaviour of the non-conventional stainless steel is determined by using the ball on <b>plate</b> <b>wear</b> testing machine, with varying loads and sliding distances. It is observed that the height loss due to wear increases with increase in sensitization time, applied load and sliding distance.

Aluminium and Aluminium based alloys are used in the automotive industries, parts operated at severe wear and tear conditions. In the present work, with the objective of studying the wear behavior of Al-Sn alloys, some samples of Al and 1 % Sn composition alloy were taken. The sliding wear behavior using ball on <b>plate</b> <b>wear</b> tester was observed.
