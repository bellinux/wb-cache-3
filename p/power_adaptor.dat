50|$|While the SL series {{devices have}} long been sold only in Japan, there are {{companies}} in Japan who specialise in exporting them worldwide; sometimes without modifying them at all, sometimes an English conversion is available at extra cost. Not all Zaurus models came from Sharp with universal (100/110/240V) power supplies (the Zaurus takes a regulated 5V/1A supply), so either an additional or an exchanged <b>power</b> <b>adaptor</b> would be needed, and not all exporters provide this by default.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a <b>power</b> <b>adaptor</b> device, {{referred to as}} smart panel device, allowing the connection of additional energy sources and storage elements to a domestic photovoltaic (PV) grid-connected system. The adaptor output port is designed to behave as a power source/sink, thus enabling its hot-swap parallel connection to renewable power sources without modifying their maximum power point (MPP). Moreover, the adaptor device features a power characteristic with a single controllable MPP and allows {{the control of the}} injected power within the operating range of the dc–ac grid-connected inverter. The work presents the design principles of such device by describing the operation of a sliding- mode controlled quadratic-boost converter. The proper operation of the device is experimentally verified for several scenarios in a small PV-based microgrid system including a fuel-cell stack, a 1 -kW three-phase wind turbine, a battery charger–discharger, and commercial grid-connected PV invertersPeer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|E

40|$|The {{introduction}} of the paper emphasizes an increasingly important role of alternative power sources nowadays. At the same time, a solar collector (suntrap) {{is one of the}} most frequent techniques to use the solar energy. It is an absorber that picks up solar radiation and heats a heat carrier circulating in the close loop. Then the heat is transferred to the heat accumulator that is integrated in the hot-tap water system (HWS). The paper presents a prospective circuit of the solar collector. It differs from the traditional one because, in addition to absorbing panel, it uses photoconverters to generate electric power for the circulating pump. The advantage of this system is that for operation such a solar energy converter has no need in external power sources, i. e. it is autonomous. The need to calculate the essential thermo-physical parameters that ensure no-break system operation was stated as a main objective of the work. The suggested circuit has a photocell panel to convert solar radiation into dc voltage of 12 V. In case of a lack of the solar energy an accumulator battery can be used for feeding. To ensure the no-break supply of <b>power</b> an <b>adaptor</b> is offered. To calculate a density distribution of solar radiation a sine law is offered depending on the time of day and geographical locality. This dependence was used to obtain the expressions for calculating the water temperature in boiler over daytime. Further, the calculations have been done for the operating conditions under which an efficient heat exchange will be provided with the minimum consumption of electric power for the heat carrier circulation in the first loop. For this purpose, a pump power was calculated depending on consumption and hydraulic losses of head in the pipeline. As a minimum required consumption the value has been chosen at which a laminar flow regime changes to the turbulent one because of the most efficient heat exchange being both in collector and in heat accumulator. The hydraulic loss has been calculated by Darcy-Weisbach equation. Finally, the formula has been obtained to calculate a minimum area of photo converters to be needed for the solar power system to ensure no-break operation. As a result of studies, it has been found that with typical external parameters, the area required for photo converters is about 100 - 300 cm 2. Dependences to calculate main parameters of system components including necessary minimum areas of absorber and photo converter, pump power, heat carrier consumption has been obtained as well. The paper conclusions are as follows. The model of solar heat accumulator obtained in the paper makes it possible to calculate main parameters of system components. Required photo converter dimensions have acceptable values. Also it is necessary to calculate the convection exchange processes in absorber to optimize a design for reducing the thermal and hydraulic losses. Further, the paper presents the calculation of operating conditions under which an efficient heat exchange is ensured with minimum consumption of electric power for the heat carrier circulation in the first loop. For this, a pump power has been calculated depending on the consumption and hydraulic losses in the pipeline. </p...|$|R
