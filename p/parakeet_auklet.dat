2500|$|Since 1995, the zoo {{has been}} a part of the red wolf Species Survival Plan and {{reintroduction}} program. [...] The zoo has been home to 48 of these critically endangered animals, including a litter of 5, born at the zoo in 2002, which became the first captive-bred wolves to be adopted by wild parents. [...] The zoo is also involved in the gorilla Species Survival Plan and received two female gorillas in early 2010 as part of the effort. As a result of their successful breeding, two male gorillas (Bomassa and Apollo) were born in August 2012. The Aviary is also known for a number of high-profile hatchings, including the first US hatchings of the golden white-eye, the red-faced liocichla, the African pied barbet, the golden-headed manakin, the horned puffin, the <b>parakeet</b> <b>auklet</b> and the thick-billed murre as well as the second US hatchings of the African grey-headed kingfisher and the African spoonbill.|$|E

50|$|Coastal cliffs provide nesting {{habitat for}} more than 600,000 seabirds, mostly for crevice nesting auklets. Least Auklets account for 62% of the colony, Crested Auklets for 30%, and <b>Parakeet</b> <b>Auklets</b> for 6%. Each of these species is present on the island in numbers {{exceeding}} 1% of their global populations.|$|R
50|$|The <b>parakeet</b> <b>auklet's</b> food {{varies with}} season, during the {{breeding}} season it takes mostly small planktonic crustaceans such as euphausiids, copepods and amphipods. Recent research shows it also preys on jellyfish in some areas. It often feeds at a considerable {{distance from the}} colony, diving up to 30 m to reach its prey.|$|R
5000|$|Auklets are {{typically}} very social and nest in dense colonies (<b>Parakeet</b> <b>auklets</b> are more dispersed). [...] All {{have some form}} of facial ornamentation such as large crests (Whiskered and crested auklets), auricular plumes (all four species), and crested and whiskered auklets have a tangerine-scented odour which may function in mate choice or species recognition, although this requires more study.|$|R
50|$|The genus Aethia did {{not enter}} into {{widespread}} use until the 1960s. Initially, the auklets were placed in Alca, but later reorganized into genera including: Simorhynchus, Phaleris and Cyclorhynchus. Cyclorhynchus is still occasionally used for the <b>parakeet</b> <b>auklet.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>parakeet</b> <b>auklet</b> is not {{considered}} threatened, there {{are estimated to be}} over a million individuals in the North Pacific. It is not thought to have declined recently, but may be threatened in the future by introduced predators and oil spills.|$|E
50|$|The <b>parakeet</b> <b>auklet</b> {{is a small}} (23 cm) auk with a short orange {{bill that}} is upturned to give the bird its curious fixed expression. The bird's plumage is dark above and white below. with a single white plume {{projecting}} back from the eye. There is {{a small amount of}} variation between breeding and winter plumage.|$|E
25|$|The island {{supports}} a breeding colony of about 35,000 seabirds, including some 25,000 least auklets and crested auklets. In 1925, the tufted puffin (Fratercula cirrhata), horned puffin (Fratercula radionuclidia), <b>parakeet</b> <b>auklets</b> (Aethia psittacula), and Pallas' murre (Uria lomvia arra) were reported at Fairway Rock, nesting in the crevices of the island's cliffs. A 1960 account reports that Eskimo inhabitants of Little Diomede reported a glaucous gull (Larus hyperboreus) colony on Fairway Rock {{larger than that}} on Little Diomede.|$|R
40|$|We {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that the spatial distributions of foraging least, crested and <b>parakeet</b> <b>auklets</b> (Aethia pusilla, A. cristatella and A. psittacula, respectively) in the shallow passes of the Aleutian Islands would be determined by physical mechanisms that control near-surface prey concentrations. We recorded currents using an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler, volume scattering using 200 and 420 kHz scientific echosounders, and the numbers of foraging birds. Zooplankton were sampled using a multiple opening/closing net and environmental sampling system (MOCNESS). Prey choice of birds was ascertained by collecting foraging birds and examining their stomach contents. Most sampling occurred between 8 July and 6 August 1993, when we conducted 50 passages along a transect that crossed a sill between Unalga and Kavalga Islands, western Aleutian Islands, thereby sampling the foraging activity of auklets at a variety of times of day and tidal phases. We found that the abundance of foraging individuals of each of th e 3 auklet species was a function of tidal speed. Auklet species were selective about the species of prey taken. Regardless of tidal direction, crested auklets foraged on euphausiids upwelled on the upstream side of the pass, whereas least auklets consumed copepods concentrated in near-surface convergences on the downstream side. <b>Parakeet</b> <b>auklets</b> foraged {{over the top of the}} pass and took fish and invertebrates. Tidal speed and direction influenced the distance between the peak numbers of some, but not all, species of auklets. Auklet prey preferences dictated where they foraged in the pass and the physical mechanisms exploited for successful foraging. Thus, in this instance, resource partitioning by these closely related planktivores was enhanced by a spatial segregation forced by the physical processes that enhanced the availability of prey. Our findings emphasize the important role of physical processes in the structuring of marine communities...|$|R
50|$|In {{the spring}} and summer seabirds nest on the island, {{including}} crested, <b>parakeet</b> and rhinoceros <b>auklet,</b> common and thick-billed murre, black-legged kittiwake, ancient murrelet, and tufted puffin.|$|R
50|$|The <b>parakeet</b> <b>auklet</b> is {{a highly}} vocal species at the nest, calling once it arrives at the nest and then duetting once its mate arrives. It makes a series of rhythmic hoarse calls (like that of the Cassin's auklet) and a quavering squeal. The {{function}} of these are unknown, but could be associated with defending its burrow from intruders and strengthening the bond with its mate.|$|E
50|$|The <b>parakeet</b> <b>auklet</b> (Aethia psittacula) {{is a small}} seabird of the North Pacific. Parakeet Auklets used to {{be placed}} on its own in the genus Cyclorrhynchus (Kaup, 1829) but recent {{morphological}} and genetic evidence suggest it should be placed in the genus Aethia, making them closely related to crested auklets and least auklets. It is associated with the boreal waters of Alaska, Kamchatka and Siberia. It breeds on the cliffs, slopes and boulder fields of offshore islands, generally moving south during the winter.|$|E
50|$|Talan Island (Остров Талан) , {{is a small}} roundish island, {{which lies}} 11 km (6.8 mi) {{to the north of}} Spafaryev's {{northern}} tip. It is 2 km (1.2 mi) across. Large colonies of seabirds nest on the island in the spring and summer, including over a million crested auklet, a few hundred thousand tufted and horned puffin, tens of thousands of black-legged kittiwake, and thousands of <b>parakeet</b> <b>auklet</b> and ancient murrelet. Common murre also nest here and in the summer dovekie congregate on the island. Steller's sea eagle prey on these seabirds.|$|E
50|$|Steller {{sea lions}} {{occur on the}} islands, while {{in the spring and}} summer {{millions}} of seabirds nest on the islands, including roughly six million least auklet (possibly the largest colony in the world), over 900,000 northern fulmar, and tens of thousands of <b>parakeet</b> auklet; crested <b>auklet</b> also nest on the islands. These islands are part of the Magandskiy Zapovednik or protected bioregion of the Magadan area.|$|R
5000|$|All Aethia auklets lay {{one white}} egg {{in a natural}} crevice and {{incubate}} for 25-36 days, after which, a semi-precocial chick emerges and fledges after 25-35 days. [...] Age at first breeding is estimated at 3-5 years. [...] Colony sizes are highly variable, and range from less than 100 individuals to over 1 million, although least and crested auklets tend to nest in greater density than <b>parakeet</b> and whiskered <b>auklets.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Raikoke {{is one of}} {{five major}} Steller sea lion rookeries on the Kuril Islands and {{in the spring and summer}} it is home to one of the largest {{northern}} fulmar aggregations on the Kurils; crested and <b>parakeet</b> <b>auklet,</b> pigeon guillemot, and black-legged kittiwake also nest on the island. Captain Henry James Snow reported that in 1883 some 15,000 northern fur seals inhabited the island. However, by the 1890s only [...] "a few scores" [...] were recorded captured there, almost certainly due to overexploitation by fur hunters. Currently no fur seals reproduce on Raikoke.|$|E

40|$|Auks {{are small}} to {{medium-sized}} diving birds having bills that are variably pointed and compressed but never acuminate and are sometimes covered with colorful horny sheaths in breeding adults. Feathering densely covers the lores and often {{extends to the}} nostrils, which vary from linear to oval. There are 10 functional primaries and 15 – 19 secondaries; the greater secondary and primary coverts are usually lengthened. Molting of the primaries is usually simultaneous but is gradual in some species; the wings are used for underwater propulsion, and the feet are then used mainly for steering. The 12 – 18 rectrices are short and normal in shape. The feathers are dense, water-resistant, and shiny; aftershafts and adult down feathers are present. The legs are set fairly far back on the body; walking is done in an erect posture with the weight on the toes (digitigrade). Takeoff from level ground is difficult and infrequent; the birds usually take flight from cliffs or into the wind from water. The tarsus is compressed laterally, is reticulated or scutellated, and is usually shorter than the middle toe. The hallux is absent or vestigial, and the front toes are fully webbed. The wings are relatively short (one recently extinct species and several fossil species were flightless), bowed, and pointed, and the body is robust, with a short neck and large head. Adults have white to dark grayish underparts and usually are blackish dorsally. Adults of most species exhibit crests, facial tufts, or other distinctive plumage or horny bill adornments in both sexes during the breeding season. All species are monogamous and monomorphic, often having distinct breeding and wintering plumages. The eggs are laid on rock ledges, in crevices or burrows, or rarely among the branches of trees. The eggs (1 or 2) are often spotted and are pyriform to ovate. The young are down-covered, unpatterned to bicolored, and are nidifugous to seminidicolous. The family is Holarctic in distribution, and the species are entirely marine in winter but usually breed colonially (sometimes solitarily) along coastlines. Their foods mainly consist of fish, plankton, and other marine fauna. There are twenty-two extant species, twenty of which breed in North America, particularly along the northern Pacific coast.
