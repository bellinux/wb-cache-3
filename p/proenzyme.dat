5|$|Examples of post-translational {{modification}} include phosphorylation, myristoylation and glycosylation. For example, in {{the response to}} insulin, the phosphorylation of multiple enzymes, including glycogen synthase, helps control the synthesis or degradation of glycogen and allows the cell to respond to changes in blood sugar. Another example of {{post-translational modification}} is the cleavage of the polypeptide chain. Chymotrypsin, a digestive protease, is produced in inactive form as chymotrypsinogen in the pancreas and transported in this form to the stomach where it is activated. This stops the enzyme from digesting the pancreas or other tissues before it enters the gut. This type of inactive precursor to an enzyme {{is known as a}} zymogen or <b>proenzyme.</b>|$|E

When released into the duodenum, they are activated by the enzyme enteropeptidase present in {{the lining of the}} duodenum. The proenzymes are cleaved, creating a cascade of activating enzymes: enteropeptidase activates the <b>proenzyme</b> trypsinogen by cleaving it to form trypsin. The free trypsin then cleaves the rest of the trypsinogen, as well as chymotrypsinogen to its active form chymotrypsin.|$|E
2500|$|Trypsin (...) is a serine {{protease}} from the PA clan superfamily, {{found in the}} digestive system of many vertebrates, where it hydrolyses proteins. Trypsin is formed in the small intestine when its <b>proenzyme</b> form, the trypsinogen produced by the pancreas, is activated. Trypsin cleaves peptide chains mainly at the carboxyl side of the amino acids lysine or arginine, except when either is followed by proline. It is used for numerous biotechnological processes. The process is {{commonly referred to as}} trypsin proteolysis or trypsinisation, and proteins that have been digested/treated with trypsin are said to have been trypsinized. Trypsin was discovered in 1876 by Wilhelm Kühne.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{guinea pig}} exocrine {{pancreatic}} cells intracisternal granules (ICGs) occur {{at a low}} frequency within the lumen of the RER. By starving and refeeding guinea pigs or injecting them in CoC 12 solution, the number of these granules is greatly increased. We show here that ICGs contain the complete set of secreted pancreatic digestive enzymes and <b>proenzymes.</b> Two other soluble proteins in the lumen of the RER, GRP 78 /BiP and protein disulphide isomerase (PDI), are specifically excluded from ICGs. The formation of ICGs, which occurs without acidification of the RER cisternae, is therefore a sorting event involving the cocondensation of {{a complete set of}} secretory enzymes and <b>proenzymes,</b> which for brevity we refer to collectively as the zymogens.

40|$|The human 66 000 mol. wt. {{plasminogen}} activator (HPA 66; tissue-type plasminogen activator) {{has been}} purified from melanoma cells by a one-step affinity method with a monoclonal antibody. HPA 66 purified {{in this way}} consists mainly of a one-polypeptide chain form with small amounts (15 %) of a form containing two polypeptide chains held together {{by one or more}} disulphide bridges. The one-chain form was converted to the two-chain form by catalytic amounts of plasmin. During the conversion, the enzyme activity of HPA 66, as measured by an [125 I]plasminogen conversion assay and with a chromogenic substrate, increased linearly with the percentage of the two-chain form. A linear regression analysis showed that all enzyme activity could be accounted for by the two-chain form, while the one-chain form had no measurable enzyme activity (detection limit approximately 5 % of the activity of the two-chain form). Together with previous findings of inactive <b>proenzymes</b> to murine and human approximately 50 000 mol. wt.

40|$|AIM: To {{examine whether}} {{rendezvous}} {{endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography}} (ERCP) is associated with less pancreatic damage, measured as leakage of <b>proenzymes,</b> than conventional ERCP. METHODS: Patients (n = 122) with symptomatic gallstone disease, intact papilla and no ongoing inflammation, were prospectively enrolled in this case-control designed study. Eighty-one patients were subjected to laparoscopic cholecystectomy and if intraoperative cholangiography suggested common bile duct stones (CBDS), rendezvous ERCP was performed intraoperatively (n = 40). Patients with a negative cholangiogram constituted the control group (n = 41). Another 41 patients with CBDS, not subjected to surgery, underwent conventional ERCP. Pancreatic <b>proenzymes,</b> procarboxypeptidase B and trypsinogen- 2 levels in plasma, were analysed at 0, 4, 8 and 24 h. The <b>proenzymes</b> were determined in-house with a double-antibody enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Pancreatic amylase was measured by an enzymatic colourimetric modular analyser with the manufacturer&#x 2019;s reagents. All samples were blinded at analysis. RESULTS: Post ERCP pancreatitis (PEP) occurred in 3 / 41 (7 %) of the patients cannulated with conventional ERCP and none in the rendezvous group. Increased serum levels indicating pancreatic leakage were significantly higher in the conventional ERCP group compared with the rendezvous ERCP group regarding pancreatic amylase levels in the 4 - and 8 -h samples (P = 0. 0015; P = 0. 03), procarboxypeptidase B in the 4 - and 8 -h samples (P < 0. 0001; P < 0. 0001) and trypsinogen- 2 in the 24 -hour samples (P = 0. 03). No differences in these markers were observed in patients treated with rendezvous cannulation technique compared with patients that underwent cholecystectomy alone (control group). Post procedural concentrations of pancreatic amylase and procarboxypeptidase B were significantly correlated with pancreatic duct cannulation and opacification. CONCLUSION: Rendezvous ERCP reduces pancreatic enzyme leakage compared with conventional ERCP cannulation technique. Thus, laparo-endoscopic technique can be recommended with the ambition to minimise the risk for post ERCP pancreatitis...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Endoscopic {{retrograde}} cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) -induced pancreatitis (EIP) {{provides an}} opportunity to study different pathophysiologic events early {{in the course of}} acute pancreatitis. AIMS: To investigate whether the leakage of pancreatic <b>proenzymes</b> (anionic trypsinogen), pancreatic protease activation (carboxypeptidase B activation peptide), cytokine response (interleukin [IL]- 1 receptor antagonist, IL- 6, and soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor-I) and neutrophil activation (neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin and polymorphonuclear elastase) differ between patients with and without EIP. A second aim was to clarify the temporal relation between these different events. METHODOLOGY: Ninety-nine nonconsecutive patients undergoing ERCP were investigated in the study. RESULTS: Fourteen of 99 patients undergoing ERCP developed mild EIP. Six hours after the investigation the concentration of anionic trypsinogen was significantly higher in patients with EIP than in patients without EIP. The day after ERCP, higher concentrations of anionic trypsinogen, carboxypeptidase B activation peptide, IL- 6, and polymorphonuclear elastase were recorded in the EIP group. No significant differences in IL- 1 receptor antagonist, soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor-I or neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin were found between the groups in this study. CONCLUSION: Mild EIP was accompanied by early leakage of <b>proenzymes</b> and later activation of trypsinogen/proteases. A significant cytokine response and neutrophil activation were recorded the day after ERCP, but further studies are needed to determine the temporal relation between these different pathophysiologic events...|$|R
40|$|The {{extracellular}} serine endopeptidase GluSE (EC 3. 4. 21. 19) {{is considered}} {{to be one of the}} virulence factors of Staphylococcus epidermidis. The present study investigated maturation processing of native GluSE and that heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli. In addition to the 28 -kDa mature protease, small amounts of <b>proenzymes</b> with molecular masses of 32, 30, and 29 kDa were identified in the extracellular and cell wall-associated fractions. We defined the pre (M 1 -A 27) - and pro (K 28 -S 66) -segments, and found that processing at the E 32 -S 33 and D 48 -I 49 bonds was responsible for production of the 30 - and 29 -kDa intermediates, respectively. The full-length form of C-terminally His-tagged GluSE was purified as three <b>proenzymes</b> equivalent to the native ones. These molecules possessing an entire or a part of the pro-segment were proteolytically latent and converted to a mature 28 -kDa form by thermolysin cleavage at the S 66 -V 67 bond. Mutation of the essential amino acid S 235 suggested auto-proteolytic production of the 30 - and 29 -kDa intermediates. Furthermore, an undecapeptide (I 56 -S 66) of the truncated pro-segment not only functions as an inhibitor of the protease but also facilitates thermolysin processing. These findings could offer clues to the molecular mechanism involved in the regulation of proteolytic activity of pathogenic proteases secreted from S. epidermidis...|$|R

50|$|The second vital {{secretion}} of the GI tract {{is that of}} {{digestive enzymes}} that are secreted in the mouth, stomach and intestines. Some of these enzymes are secreted by accessory digestive organs, while others are secreted by the epithelial cells of the stomach and intestine. While some of these enzymes remain embedded in {{the wall of the}} GI tract, others are secreted in an inactive <b>proenzyme</b> form. When these proenzymes reach the lumen of the tract, a factor specific to a particular <b>proenzyme</b> will activate it. A prime example of this is pepsin, which is secreted in the stomach by chief cells. Pepsin in its secreted form is inactive (pepsinogen). However, once it reaches the gastic lumen it becomes activated into pepsin by the high H+ concentration, becoming an enzyme vital to digestion. The release of the enzymes is regulated by neural, hormonal, or paracrine signals. However, in general, parasympathetic stimulation increases secretion of all digestive enzymes.|$|E
50|$|The protein Sf caspase-1 is {{the insect}} {{ortholog}} {{of the human}} effector caspases CASP3 (CPP32) and CASP7 (MCH3) in the species Spodoptera frugiperda (Fall armyworm). It was identified as {{the target of the}} baculoviral caspase inhibitor protein P35, which it cleaves and by which it is inhibited. Like other caspases, Sf caspase-1 is an aspartate-specific cysteine protease that is produced as an inactive <b>proenzyme</b> and becomes activated by autocatalytic cleavage. The Sf caspase-1 <b>proenzyme</b> is cleaved after the amino acid residues Asp-28 and Asp-195, resulting in a smaller 12 kDa fragment and a larger 19 kDa fragment. Just like with human caspases CASP3 or CASP7, the two cleavage fragments form heterodimers, which again form biologically active dimers-of-heterodimers consisting of two smaller and two larger fragments. Some experiments also showed cleavage of Sf caspase-1 at the residue Asp-184, resulting in a 18 kDa instead of 19 kDa fragment, however this result is likely an in vitro artefact. The insect immunophilin FKBP46 is a substrate of Sf caspase-1, which cleaves full length FKBP46 (~46 kDa) resulting in a ~25 kDa fragment.|$|E
