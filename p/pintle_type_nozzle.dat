40|$|In {{order to}} design the metal {{delivery}} system for the single belt caster in the MMPC (McGill Metals Processing Centre) foundry, water modeling and mathematical modeling were carried out for a newly devised three-chamber type tundish. Water flow in the acrylic tundish was visualized using dye injection. Flow velocities were also measured using a Dual Nd-YAG PIV (Particle Image Velocimetry) system. A commercial FEM code, FEMLAB 2. 3 was adopted to predict the velocity field and temperature profile within the tundish, especially in the output chamber. Calculated results were validated with the PIV measurements. A full-scale water model was built for the single belt caster to simulate the casting operation and to validate the optimized delivery system. Temperature profiles for the tundish wall were also predicted to choose a suitable method of preheating and to determine refractory wall specifications. A three-chamber type tundish comprising an entry chamber, a head control chamber and an output chamber was designed to provide clean metal and strips of uniform thickness across {{the width of the}} belt. An output chamber proved to be essential for removing the bubbles and for obtaining a uniform film of water on the substrate by preventing strong hydraulic jump. The output chamber had to be completely closed for rapid bubble removal. For rapid filling of the output chamber at start up, the starting stopper proved to be essential. The 3 -hole <b>type</b> <b>nozzle,</b> proved to be more effective for removing the bubbles, was found to have problems in terms of strongly impinging jet flow and non-uniform lateral velocities. Using mathematical modeling and full scale water modeling, including PIV measurements, the "FD" <b>type</b> <b>nozzle,</b> which had a multi channel flow modifier in the output chamber and a slot <b>type</b> inlet <b>nozzle,</b> was found to be the best in terms of rapid bubble removal and uniform distribution of flow. This was achieved by a dramatic reduction in the strength of the vertically impinging flow towards the belt. However, this "FD" <b>type</b> <b>nozzle</b> generated a dead zone near the triple point within the output chamber. To remove the dead zone, a gently sloped shape insulator was inserted between the tundish back wall and the belt...|$|R

40|$|Student Number : 9506932 W - MSc {{research}} report - School of Mechanical Engineering - Faculty of Engineering and the Built EnvironmentIn this research project, {{the performance and}} emissions of a conventional compression ignition engine fuelled on ethanol as main fuel and dimethyl ether as ignition promoter were investigated. Tests were first conducted on diesel fuel, then on ethanol fuel with dimethyl ether and compared. All tests for both fuelling techniques were conducted at the same engine speed and injector pressure. However, engine settings with specific reference to injection timing and injector pressure were optimised to suit diesel fuel, and were left unaltered when the engine was fuelled on ethanol and dimethyl ether. The injector nozzle configuration used for diesel fuel was a standard three-hole <b>type</b> <b>nozzle,</b> whereas for ethanol fuel with dimethyl ether a standard three-hole nozzle {{as well as a}} four-hole <b>type</b> <b>nozzle</b> was used. Also investigated was the effect a catalytic converter would have on exhaust emissions, from both fuelling techniques. The performance results of ethanol/dimethyl ether fuel compared favourably to that of diesel fuel. The brake power attained for both fuelling techniques was approximately the same, however the only penalty incurred to this desired result was the simultaneous increase in the brake specific fuel consumption of ethanol/dimethyl ether fuel. The fuel conversion efficiency of ethanol/dimethyl ether fuel was also found to be lower than that of diesel fuel, this largely attributed to the difference in energy release patterns between the two fuels. The emissions results obtained showed that ethanol/dimethyl ether fuel burns cleaner, mainly due to its chemical structure containing oxygen molecules. The NOx, THC, CO and CO 2 emissions, produced before the catalytic converter, of ethanol/dimethyl ether fuel were lower than those of diesel fuel. The catalytic converter further produced lower emissions, with the four-hole <b>type</b> <b>nozzle</b> producing the most desired results. In terms of catalytic converter efficiency, THC and CO emissions were more readily removed compared to NOx. In addition, virtually no smoke emissions were detected for ethanol/dimethyl ether fuel combustion...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{feasibility}} study of jet propulsion for remote operated vehicles (ROV’s). The concept {{of using a}} tilting <b>type</b> <b>nozzle</b> for improved maneuverability is discussed. Though the propulsion efficiency of jets is less {{compared to that of}} the propeller for the velocity ranges usually encountered in ROV movements, the implementation of jet propulsion is considered in view of the advantages in improving maneuvering qualities. Also, the simplicity of the system and les complexity in pressure compensation adds to its advantages. This study concentrates on the selection of an optimum nozzle configuration for ROV’s. [...] An experimental set-up was designed and fabricated for this investigation. Ten different plexi-glass conical nozzles were used for five different circular disk shaped drag plates, simulating the drag of the ROV motion under water. Energy losses were determined both experimentally and theoretically. Wall effects encountered in the experimental tank were compensated by towing the model in an open water wave tank for the same range of speeds. It was found that the propulsion efficiency is maximum for one particular nozzle over a wide range of flow rates encountered in the experiments. Finally, a feasible design of a jet propelled ROV with tilting <b>type</b> <b>nozzles</b> is presented. This design could be fabricated and tested for commercial production...|$|R

40|$|A pulsed {{detonation}} {{rocket engine}} concept was explored {{through the use}} of hypergolic propellants in a fuel-centered pintle injector combustor. The combustor design yielded a simple open ended chamber with a <b>pintle</b> <b>type</b> injection element and pressure instrumentation. High-frequency pressure measurements from the first test series showed the presence of large pressure oscillations in excess of 2000 psia at frequencies between 400 - 600 hz during operation. High-speed video confirmed the high-frequency pulsed behavior and large amounts of after burning. Damaged hardware and instrumentation failure limited the amount of data gathered in the first test series, but the experiments met original test objectives of producing large over-pressures in an open chamber. A second test series proceeded by replacing hardware and instrumentation, and new data showed that pulsed events produced under expanded exhaust prior to pulsing, peak pressures around 8000 psi, and operating frequencies between 400 - 800 hz. Later hot-fires produced no pulsed behavior despite undamaged hardware. The research succeeded in producing pulsed combustion behavior using hypergolic fuels in a pintle injector setup and provided insights into design concepts that would assist future injector designs and experimental test setups. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{rotating}} {{propagation of}} a continuous detonation engine (CDE) with different <b>types</b> of <b>nozzles</b> is investigated in three-dimensional numerical simulation using a one-step chemical reaction model. Flux terms are solved by the so-called monotonicity-preserving weighted essentially non-oscillatory (MPWENO) scheme. The simulated flow field agrees {{well with the}} previous experimental results. Once the initial transient effects die down, the detonation wave maintains continuous oscillatory propagation in the annular chamber as long as fuel is continuously injected. Using a numerical flow field, the propulsion performance of a CDE is computed for four <b>types</b> of <b>nozzles,</b> namely the constant-area nozzle, Laval nozzle, diverging nozzle and converging nozzle. The gross specific impulse of the CDE ranges 1 540 - 1 750 s and the mass flux per square meter ranges 313 - 330 kg/(m 2 ·s) for different nozzles. Among these four <b>types</b> of <b>nozzles,</b> Laval nozzle performs the best, and these parameters are 1 800 N, 1 750 s and 313 kg/(m 2 ·s).
