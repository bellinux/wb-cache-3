An occupational type specific bronchial provocation test with toluene diisocyanate (10 - 25 <b>parts</b> <b>per</b> <b>thousand</b> <b>million</b> for 10 - 15 minutes) elicited an immediate response in 24, a late response in 50, and a dual response in 40 patients. Subjects with a dual response showed at diagnosis a longer duration of symptoms and a greater prevalence of airway obstruction; in these subjects FEV, (percentage of predicted value) was lower than in subjects with immediate or late reactions to toluene diisocyanate. The percentage of current smokers and ex-smokers was significantly lower in subjects with a late response (26 %) than in subjects with immediate or dual responses (56 % and 57 % respectively). In 27 of the 114 subjects a non-specific challenge test with methacholine was performed and subjects with dual responses showed greater non-specific bronchial hyperresponsivess than the other groups.

Seawater interaction with the granitoids produced enrichment in S- 34 of sulphide-sulphur in both the microgranites and associated skarn mineralization.

40|$|Sulfur {{speciation}} and {{the sources}} of water-soluble sulfate in three oxidizing sulfidic mine tailings impoundments were investigated by selective dissolution and stable isotopes. The studied tailings impoundments-Piuquenes, Cauquenes, and Salvador No. 1 -formed from the exploitation of the Rio Blanco/La Andina, El Teniente, and El Salvador Chilean porphyry copper deposits, which are located in Alpine, Mediterranean, and hyperarid climates, respectively. The water-soluble sulfate may originate from dissolution of primary ore sulfates (e. g., gypsum, anhydrite, jarosite) or from oxidation of sulfide minerals exposed to aerobic conditions during mining activity. With increasing aridity and decreasing pyrite content of the tailings, the sulfur speciation in the unsaturated oxidation zones showed a trend from dominantly Fe(Ill) oxyhydroxide fixed sulfate (e. g., jarosite and schwertmannite) in Piuquenes toward increasing presence of water-soluble sulfate at Cauquenes and Salvador No. 1. In the saturated primary zones, sulfate is predominantly present in water-soluble form (mainly as anhydrite and/or gypsum). In the unsaturated zone at Piuquenes and Cauquenes,the delta(34) S(S 04) values ranged from + 0. 5 <b>parts</b> <b>per</b> <b>thousand</b> to + 2. 0 <b>parts</b> <b>per</b> <b>thousand</b> and from - 0. 4 <b>parts</b> <b>per</b> <b>thousand</b> to + 1. 4 <b>parts</b> <b>per</b> <b>thousand</b> Vienna Canyon Diablo Troilite (V-CDT), respectively, indicating a major sulfate source from pyrite oxidation (delta(34) S(pyrite) - 1. 1 <b>parts</b> <b>per</b> <b>thousand</b> and - 0. 9 <b>parts</b> <b>per</b> <b>thousand).</b> In the saturated zone at Piuquenes and Cauquenes, the values ranged from - 0. 8 %. to + 0. 3 <b>parts</b> <b>per</b> <b>thousand</b> and from + 2. 2 <b>parts</b> <b>per</b> <b>thousand</b> to + 3. 9 <b>parts</b> <b>per</b> <b>thousand,</b> respectively. At Cauquenes the 34 S enrichment in the saturated zone toward depth indicates the increasing contribution of isotopically heavy dissolved sulfate from primary anhydrite (similar to+ 10. 9 %o). At El Salvador No. 1, the delta(34) S(SO 4) average value is - 0. 9 <b>parts</b> <b>per</b> <b>thousand,</b> suggesting dissolution of supergene sulfate minerals (jarosite, alunite, gypsum) with a delta(34) S similar to - 0. 7 <b>parts</b> <b>per</b> <b>thousand</b> as the most probable sulfate source.

Survival was frequently higher and development faster at 15 - 25 <b>parts</b> <b>per</b> <b>thousand</b> than in sea water (35 <b>parts</b> <b>per</b> <b>thousand),</b> possibly indicating a phylogenetic adaptation of A. miersii to brackish water. Extremely low and high salinities (5, 45 - 55 <b>parts</b> <b>per</b> <b>thousand)</b> caused prolonged development durations and increased mortality rates. Tolerance of very low salinity, but not that of hypersaline conditions tended to increase during development. This suggests that late stages attain an increasing capability for hyper-osmoregulation in dilute media, but probably remain poor regulators in concentrated media. The megalopa and crab I were, in some experiments, less affected by chronic than by acute exposure to unfavourable salinities, suggesting that non-genetic resistance adaptation (acclimatization) had taken place during earlier development. During continual exposure to extreme salinities, however, effects of severe osmotic stress outweighed those of acclimatization. The range which allowed for successful development through metamorphosis widened with consecutively later change of salinity: 15 - 35 <b>parts</b> <b>per</b> <b>thousand</b> (exposure from hatching), 15 - 45 <b>parts</b> <b>per</b> <b>thousand</b> (from zoea II), 5 - 45 <b>parts</b> <b>per</b> <b>thousand</b> (from zoea III), 5 - 55 <b>parts</b> <b>per</b> <b>thousand</b> (from megalopa or crab I). It is concluded that tolerance of variable, predominantly low salinities in larval and early juvenile A. miersii has evolved as an adaptation to breeding in a physically unstable environment, where rapidly decreasing or continually low salinities {{are more likely to}} occur than hypersaline conditions. The degree of salinity tolerance in its early life-cycle stages shows that this species has reached, within the Grapsidae, a phylogenetically intermediate stage of adaptation to conditions in freshwater and terrestrial environments...|$|R

Both covered thermal maturity from 0. 48 to 1. 3 R-c (vitrinite reflectance and reflectance calculated from MPI 1). Sediment burial up to 4500 m caused thermal maturation of organic matter in the KS horizon from the Early Zechstein basin of Poland, whereas contact metamorphic thermal maturation originated in the Early Toarcian PS (Posidonienschiefer) of the North German Vlotho Massif.

40|$|A {{collection}} of 24 seawaters from various worldwide locations and differing depth was culled to measure their chlorine isotopic composition (delta(37) Cl). These samples {{cover all the}} oceans and large seas: Atlantic, Pacific, Indian and Antarctic oceans, Mediterranean and Red seas. This collection includes nine seawaters from three depth profiles down to 4560 mbsl. The standard deviation (2 sigma) of the delta(37) Cl of this collection is +/- 0. 08 <b>parts</b> <b>per</b> <b>thousand,</b> which is in fact as large as our precision of measurement (+/- 0. 10 <b>parts</b> <b>per</b> <b>thousand).</b> Thus, within error, oceanic waters {{seem to be an}} homogeneous reservoir. According to our results, any seawater could be representative of Standard Mean Ocean Chloride (SMOC) and {{could be used as a}} reference standard. An extended international cross-calibration over a large range of delta(37) Cl has been completed. For this purpose, geological fluid samples of various chemical compositions and a manufactured CH 3 Cl gas sample, with delta(37) Cl from about - 6 <b>parts</b> <b>per</b> <b>thousand</b> to + 6 <b>parts</b> <b>per</b> <b>thousand</b> have been compared. Data were collected by gas source isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) at the Paris, Reading and Utrecht laboratories and by thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS) at the Leeds laboratory. Comparison of IRMS values over the range - 5. 3 <b>parts</b> <b>per</b> <b>thousand</b> to + 1. 4 <b>parts</b> <b>per</b> <b>thousand</b> plots on the Y=X line, showing a very good agreement between the three laboratories. On 11 samples, the trend line between Paris and Reading Universities is: delta(37) Cl(Reading) = (1. 007 +/- 0. 009) delta(37) Cl(Paris) - (0. 040 +/- 0. 025), with a correlation coefficient: R- 2 = 0. 999. TIMS values from Leeds University have been compared to IRMS values from Paris University over the range - 3. 0 <b>parts</b> <b>per</b> <b>thousand</b> to + 6. 0 <b>parts</b> <b>per</b> <b>thousand.</b> On six samples, the agreement between these two laboratories, using different techniques is good: delta(37) Cl(Leeds) =(1. 052 +/- 0. 038) delta(37) Cl(Paris) + (0. 058 +/- 0. 099), with a correlation coefficient: R- 2 = 0. 995. The present study completes a previous cross-calibration between the Leeds and Reading laboratories to compare TIMS and IRMS results (Anal. Chem. 72 (2000) 2261). Both studies allow a comparison of IRMS and TIMS techniques between delta(37) Cl values from - 4. 4 <b>parts</b> <b>per</b> <b>thousand</b> to + 6. 0 <b>parts</b> <b>per</b> <b>thousand</b> and show a good agreement: delta(37) Cl(TIMS) =(1. 039 +/- 0. 023) delta(37) Cl(IRMS) +(0. 059 +/- 0. 056), with a correlation coefficient: R- 2 = 0. 996. Our study shows that, for fluid samples, if chlorine isotopic compositions are near 0 <b>parts</b> <b>per</b> <b>thousand,</b> their measurements either by IRMS or TIMS will give comparable results within less than +/- 0. 10 <b>parts</b> <b>per</b> <b>thousand,</b> while for delta(37) Cl values as far as 10 <b>parts</b> <b>per</b> <b>thousand</b> (either positive or negative) from SMOC, both techniques will agree within less than +/- 0. 30 <b>parts</b> <b>per</b> <b>thousand.</b> (C) 2004 Elsevier B.

40|$|International audienceTracing {{the origin}} of iron cyanide {{complexes}} in the environment is important because these compounds are potentially toxic. We determined the stable isotopic compositions of cyanide carbon (C-CN) and cyanide-nitrogen (N-CN) in 127 contaminated solids and 11 samples of contaminated groundwater from coal carbonization sites, blast furnace operations, and commercial cyanide applications. Coal-carbonization-related cyanides had unique high mean delta C- 13 (CN) values of - 10. 5 +/- 3. 5 <b>parts</b> <b>per</b> <b>thousand</b> for the solids and - 16. 1 +/- 1. 2 <b>parts</b> <b>per</b> <b>thousand</b> for the groundwater samples, while the values for blast furnace sludge (- 26. 9 +/- 1. 5 <b>parts</b> <b>per</b> <b>thousand),</b> commercial cyanides (- 26. 0 +/- 3. 0 <b>parts</b> <b>per</b> <b>thousand),</b> and their corresponding groundwaters were significantly lower. Determination of delta C- 13 (CN) is a promising tool for identifying the source of cyanide contamination. However, for coal carbonization sites, historical research into the manufacturing process is necessary because a nonconventional gas works site exhibited exceptionally low delta C- 13 (CN) values of - 22. 7 +/- 1. 7 <b>parts</b> <b>per</b> <b>thousand.</b> The delta N- 15 (CN) values for samples related to coal carbonization and blast furnaces overlapped within a range of + 0. 1 to + 10. 3 <b>parts</b> <b>per</b> <b>thousand,</b> but very high delta N- 15 (CN) values seemed to be indicative for a cyanide source in the blast furnace. In contrast, commercial cyanides tend to have lower delta N- 15 (CN) values of - 5. 6 to + 1. 9 <b>parts</b> <b>per</b> <b>thousand</b> in solids and - 0. 5 to + 3. 0 <b>parts</b> <b>per</b> <b>thousand</b> in the groundwater...|$|R
40|$|Fumarolic gases, {{rocks and}} {{condensate}} samples from Merapi volcano (Indonesia) have been analyzed by multiple collector inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS) for their Zn isotopic compositions. The variation observed, expressed as delta Zn- 66 (delta Zn- 66 = [(Zn- 66 /Zn- 64) (sample) /(Zn- 66 /Zn- 64) (JMC) (3 - 049 L) - 1] 10 (3)), ranges from+ 0. 05 <b>parts</b> <b>per</b> <b>thousand.</b> to + 1. 68 <b>parts</b> <b>per</b> <b>thousand</b> [...] The overall reproducibility {{was found to}} be better than 0. 10 <b>parts</b> <b>per</b> <b>thousand.</b> (2 SD). The delta Zn- 66 of andesitic rock samples are homogeneous with a mean value of + 0. 24 <b>parts</b> <b>per</b> <b>thousand.,</b> which is comparable to previously reported basalt data. delta Zn- 66 in the Woro furnerolic field are ranging from + 0. 05 <b>parts</b> <b>per</b> <b>thousand</b> to + 0. 85 <b>parts</b> <b>per</b> <b>thousand</b> and + 1. 48 <b>parts</b> <b>per</b> <b>thousand</b> to + 1. 68 <b>parts</b> <b>per</b> <b>thousand</b> in fumarolic gases and condensates respectively. Upon cooling from 590 to 297 degrees C, gaseous Zn concentrations decrease and become increasingly enriched in the lighter Zn isotopes, while the condensates become increasingly enriched in the heavier isotopes. Gas and condensate isotopic compositions can be explained with a Rayleigh condensation model with temperature dependent isotope fractionation factor, alpha((solid/vapor)). Over the 574 degrees C to 297 degrees C range of observations, 1000 In(alpha(solid/vapour)) C- 1 +C- 2 /T+C- 3 /T- 2 (with C- 1 = 0, C- 2 = - 0. 88 x 10 (3), C- 3 = 1. 00 x 10 (6) and T in degrees Kelvin), which corresponds to alpha((solid/vapor)) of 1. 00033 to 1. 00153 respectively at the indicated temperatures...|$|R
40|$|The study {{investigated}} delta N- 15 in the intertidal benthic food webs {{from the middle}} Westerschelde Estuary and the middle Oosterschelde. Much heavier delta N- 15 values were observed for the main benthic primary producers and invertebrates in the Westerschelde Estuary. In the Oosterschelde, mean delta N- 15 values ranged from 1. 4 to 7. 3 <b>parts</b> <b>per</b> <b>thousand</b> for SOM and suspended POM, respectively, to 6. 3 to 9. 1 <b>parts</b> <b>per</b> <b>thousand</b> for Fucus vesiculosus and benthic diatoms, respectively. Mean delta N- 15 values in benthic invertebrates ranged from 9. 7 <b>parts</b> <b>per</b> <b>thousand</b> for Gammarus locusta to 15. 4 <b>parts</b> <b>per</b> <b>thousand</b> for Tubificoides sp. In the Westerschelde Estuary, mean delta N- 15 increased from 8. 1 to 8. 6 <b>parts</b> <b>per</b> <b>thousand</b> for suspended POM and SOM, respectively, to heavier delta N- 15 from 15. 9 to 28. 5 <b>parts</b> <b>per</b> <b>thousand</b> for F. vesiculosus and benrhic diatoms, respectively. Mean delta N- 15 for intertidal invertebrates ranged from 18. 1 <b>parts</b> <b>per</b> <b>thousand</b> for Lumbricillus sp. to 20. 7 <b>parts</b> <b>per</b> <b>thousand</b> for Eulimnogammarus obtusatus. Higher enrichment in N- 15 in benrhic primary producers and invertebrates from the Westerschelde Estuary are most likely due to the incorporation of N- 15 -enriched DIN carried by the Scheldt River by benthic algae and, then by benthic consumers. These results {{point to the fact}} that delta N- 15 in benthic estuarine food webs may respond directly to anthropogenic nitrogen inputs delivered into estuaries by rivers which drain highly urbanized areas.
