2500|$|The nerves of the sacral plexus pass {{behind the}} hip joint to {{innervate}} the posterior {{part of the}} thigh, most of the lower leg, and the foot. [...] The superior (L4-S1) and inferior gluteal nerves (L5-S2) innervate the gluteus muscles and the tensor fasciae latae. The posterior femoral cutaneous nerve (S1-S3) contributes sensory branches to the skin on the posterior thigh. [...] The sciatic nerve (L4-S3), the largest and longest nerve in the human body, leaves the pelvis through the greater sciatic foramen. In the posterior thigh it first gives off branches to the short head of the biceps femoris and then divides into the tibial (L4-S3) and common fibular nerves (L4-S2). The fibular nerve continues down on the medial side of biceps femoris, winds around the fibular neck and enters {{the front of the}} lower leg. There it divides into a deep and a superficial terminal branch. The superficial branch supplies the peroneus muscles and the deep branch enters the extensor compartment; both branches reaches into the dorsal foot. In the thigh, the tibial nerve gives off branches to semitendinosus, semimembranosus, adductor magnus, and the long head of the biceps femoris. The nerve then runs straight down the back of the leg, through the <b>popliteal</b> <b>fossa</b> to supply the ankle flexors {{on the back of the}} lower leg and then continues down to supply all the muscles in the sole of the foot.|$|E

To draw attention to diagnostic and therapeutic difficulties associated with pemphigus foliaceus. Case report. A 14 -year-old boy was admitted to our department with seborrhoeic crusts over the anterior and posterior surfaces of the chest and erythematous-infiltrative lesions in the axillary and <b>popliteal</b> <b>fossae.</b> Since histopathological examination revealed features of Darierâ€™s disease, acitretin treatment was initiated. No improvement was noted after 3 months. Another skin biopsy was obtained and immunologic tests were carried out. Based on the clinical manifestations and results of additional tests, juvenile pemphigus foliaceus was diagnosed. Prednisone therapy was initiated, however it failed to produce satisfactory improvement in skin lesions. Cyclophosphamide was added to prednisone, causing remission of the disease. Conclusions. In patients with non-characteristic lesions who fail to respond to treatment it is advisable to extend diagnostics by immunologic tests. In the reported case combination therapy with prednisone and cyclophosphamide led to long-term remission, causing no adverse effects...|$|R

Extraocular light {{has been reported to}} produce phase-shifts of the human circadian pacemaker. This allows a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of light therapy in SAD. Methods: Twenty-nine SAD patients participated. Clinical state was measured on days 1, 8, and 15 of the protocol. From days 4 through 8, 15 patients (4 M, 11 F) received extraocular light by fiberoptic illumination, and 14 (4 M, 10 F) placebo (no light) in the <b>popliteal</b> <b>fossae,</b> from 8 AM to 11 AM. In the evenings of days 3 and 8, the salivary dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) was assessed. Patients completed daily self-ratings on mood, alertness, and sleep. Results: Both conditions showed a progressive improvement of clinical state over time. Between conditions, no significant differences were observed in clinical scores, the self-ratings on mood and alertness, and in timing of the DLMO before and directly after treatment. Conclusions: The response to extraocular light therapy in SAD patients did not exceed its placebo effect. Extraocular light did not induce a phase shift of the circadian pacemaker.

Obesity has been implicated as a risk factor in the lithotomy position-related WLCS during surgery. In the present study, we investigated the relationship between the external pressure (EP) applied to the calf region using a KCLH system in the lithotomy position and selected physical characteristics. Methods: Twenty-one young, healthy volunteers (21. 4 Â± 0. 5 Â years of age, eleven males and ten females) participated in this study. The KCLH system used was Knee CrutchÂ®. We assessed four types of EPs applied to the calf region: box pressure, peak box pressure, contact pressure, and peak contact pressure, using pressure-distribution measurement system (BIG-MATÂ®). Relationships between these four EPs to the calf regions of both lower legs and a series of physical characteristics (sex, height, weight, and body mass index [BMI]) were analyzed. Results: All four EPs applied to the bilateral calf regions were higher in males than in females. For all subjects, significant positive correlations were observed between all four EPs and height, weight, and BMI. Conclusion: EP applied to the calf region is higher in males than in females when the subject is supported by a KCLH system in the lithotomy position. In addition, EP increases with the increase in height, weight, and BMI. Therefore, male sex, height, weight, and BMI may contribute to the risk of inducing WLCS.
