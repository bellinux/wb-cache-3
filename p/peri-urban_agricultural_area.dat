40|$|AbstractPollution of {{groundwater}} due to industrial and municipal wastewaters is of a rising concern {{in many cities}} and industrial clusters of India. Faridabad - a <b>peri-urban</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>area</b> is one such industrial site in district Haryana, India. The primary aim of this investigation was, to assess extend of ground water contamination in the peri-urban agricultural sites around Faridabad, Haryana and to assess its contribution due to salt/trace metal laden agricultural irrigation waters. For this, a detailed survey on the farming practices, soils and surface/sub-surface irrigation waters of 30 spatially separated villages around study area was conducted. The surveyed information was used for estimating deep percolation loss, salt/heavy metal leaching and thus vulnerability of ground waters at each sample site to salt/heavy metals {{by means of a}} field scale decision support system - IMPASSE©. Analysis showed that the study area was saline (i. e., ECmean = 4. 79 2. 76 dS/m, Clmean = 2043. 30 457. 26 ppm and Fmean = 11. 57 4. 83 ppm). These salt affected agricultural lands were found to be irrigated with (good to marginally alkali) canal, (marginally alkali to alkali) drain and (good to alkali) tube well waters. As a result, the mean EC (2. 85 0. 85 dS/m), Cl (1227. 85 remove-image> 295. 93 ppm) and F (6. 26 2. 12 ppm) concentrations in the root zone leachates from each test site, were found to be far beyond their permissible limits of 0. 75 dS/m, 1000 ppm and 1. 5 ppm. Even the soil root zone water soluble concentrations of some trace metals (viz., Cr: 0. 06 0. 00 ppm; Ni: 0. 02 0. 01 ppm, and Pb: 0. 05 0. 01 ppm) were observed to be of some threat to the deep percolating waters. However, the vulnerability assessments indicated that due to existing cropping pattern and deeper water table depths, the study area ground waters were not yet vulnerable to these salts/trace metals in the root zone leachates, and that the presence of salts in the study area ground waters was primarily geogeni...|$|E
40|$|The {{projects}} of valorisation of the {{agriculture in the}} Italian metropolitan areas have had above all origin inside the initiatives of the peri-urbain parks. The debate {{on the role of}} the protected peri-urban and metropolitan areas has received vigour on the occasion of the second national Conference on the Protected Areas (Turin, October 2002), in which has been confirmed the idea that the <b>peri-urban</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>areas</b> can have the task of approach between the rural and the urban culture, through new models of management.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to identify the effect of different land uses in peri-urban agriculture on the soil properties. Soil health indicators were evaluated in the top 10 cm at five tilled agricultural sites involving different cropping systems and use of agrochemicals within the <b>peri-urban</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>areas</b> of Yaounde, Cameroon, and compared with a native forest land. The experimental data showed that the selected indicators were sensitive to cropping practice. Most cropped land had significantly higher total C, available N and P con-centrations, soil pH, electrical conductivity, salinity, biomass C and P, dehydrogenase, b-glucosidase, and acid phosphatase activities. Land producing corn (Zea mays L.) and sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum L.) differed from that producing tomatoes (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.), but cultivation of these crops has significantly impacted native soil quality. However, phenol oxidase, microbal biomass C/organic...|$|R
40|$|Worldwide, {{population}} is increasingly centralized in metropolitan areas. This {{has an impact}} on water systems and complex metropolitan watersheds emerge. Flows of varying water quality are generated and distributed among different users who develop new opportunities and coping mechanisms for dealing with marginal quality waters. In developing countries waste water management often fails to cope with the increasing number and volumes of flows. Financial and institutional limitations force waste water managers to discharge substantial amounts of untreated or partially treated waste water into surface waters. Consequently, use of polluted water is increasingly common in the downstream <b>peri-urban</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>areas.</b> This, albeit productive, may lead to negative impacts on human health and environment, if management of this water is not rightly done. Mitigation of the problems requires rethinking of conventional ‘top-down’ waste water system design and management, in combination with expected down-stream use. In this chapter the applicability of water governance principles in design and operation of waste water systems with an effluent use component is investigated. Acknowledgement of the treatment potential of subsequent uses and the significance of use-based practices as opposed to zero-pollution design will certainly change design and treatment procedures. Inclusion of agriculture and nature as a treatment step and participation of users in decision-making are expected to optimize use of finances, infrastructure and personne...|$|R
40|$|When "new" soils, mostly {{deprived}} of technogenic materials, are imported into urban from periurban areas, {{an important question}} is to understand how these soils will evolve when exposed to urban environmental conditions. The soils of street tree-pits in Paris could be an interesting subject for such investigations. Indeed, when the city of Paris plants a new tree, it removes all the previous soil from the pit and replaces it by a newly imported soil from <b>peri-urban</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>areas.</b> Since there are no artificial nutrient inputs during the tree’s life, whilst its fallen leaves are removed from the soil, it can be expected that soil carbon and nitrogen stocks would decrease with time. Furthermore, due to specific urban isotopic signatures of atmospheric carbone and nitrogen (strongly negative d 13 C, strongly positive d 15 N), we can respectively expect a decrease and an increase of soil d 13 C and d 15 N with the aging of trees. The presentation will show {{the results of a}} campaign realized in the summer of 2011 in Paris, where the soils (at 10 - 30 cm and 30 - 40 cm depths) and leaves (4 on the lower canopy) of 79 silver lindens (Tilia tomentosa) were sampled. The sites were chosen according to three dbh (diameter at breast height) classes : 7 - 15 cm (n = 28); 32 - 43 cm (n = 29); 56 - 73 cm (n= 22).

Certain metals are important to biological actions. However all metals, whether essential or inessential will show toxicity at certain levels. During 2012 total 17 fungi were isolated and preserved from contaminated <b>peri-urban</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>areas</b> of Multan and Gujranwala for further detail investigation of heavy metal tolerance. Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus fumigatus and Aspergillus flavus isolated from both soil and water samples while Aspergillus terreus and Penicillium sp were only isolated from soil samples of Multan and Aspergillus versicolor, Aspergillus flavus, Fusarium oxysporum, Aspergillus niger which were isolated from contaminated soils and water samples while Penicillium sp was isolated from only water samples of Gujranwala. These few fungal isolates were selected for tolerance to metal Cu (SO 4) 2. 5 H 2 O, Cd (NO 3) 2, Cr (NO 3) 2 and Pd (NO 3) 2. The tolerant strains were selected with increasing metals concentration of 100 ppm and compared to control in the medium. The degree of tolerance was measured by radial growth (cm) {{in the presence of}} various heavy metals and compare to the control, which contain no heavy metals. The present study investigation concludes isolates Penicillium sp and Aspergillus flavus isolated from soil of Gujranwala show maximum tolerance index 2. 1 at 100 ppm toward Cr and 4. 8 at 100 ppm toward Cd respectively. Aspergillus Versicolor (isolated from waste water) exhibit considerable highest tolerance index toward Cu and Pb while show a sensitivity against other metals. From all the collected samples the Gujranwala soil and water show more tolerance toward the heavy metals as compared to Multan area. The present study indicates that in future similar strains will be tested with other heavy metals for the confirmation of tolerance and tolerant strains will be used for bioremediation of heavy metal...|$|R
40|$|The {{context of}} {{cultural}} reference {{is that of}} the urban countryside, considered as a possible source of open spaces and a public asset for the city and its citizens. The reference is also to the debate that the École Nationale Superieure du Paysage of Versailles has long been conducting, and which {{has proven to be a}} particularly fertile terrain for interpreting and planning periurban agricultural landscapes in some southern Italian contexts, and indeed in Mediterranean contexts in general. The author edited the Italian edition of Campagnes urbaines by Pierre Donadieu, conceiving it as a complex editorial project to introduce to the Italian readers those well structured reflections of the French Versailles school, from a long standing commitment on these issues, but also to build project implications of the vicinity countryside in the disciplinary debate in defining the project of the contemporary city. The curatorship consisted, in addition to text translation, in writing a long preface, developing a glossary of terms between agriculture and urban planning, and creating boards of french agrarian parks and the presence of a new essay by Donadieu as an upgrade text for Italian readers. Finally, new photographs were selected, inserting images of urban campaigns to help the reader in the Italian translation of the text and to implement it into the Italian culture. In recent years, architects, urban planners, landscape architects and environmentalists are questioning the nature and destiny of <b>peri-urban</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>areas.</b> Unstable places, rapidly changing, where the environmental systems that are slowly organized and trained in relation to the economy and agricultural culture are falling apart; these not builded intervals are invested not only by processes of real estate development that tend to turn them into new suburbs, but also by new activities, new social practices and unexpected questions that challenge the classical categories of urban analysis (among others, urban-rural landscape-the city, the center- outskirts). New forms of urban agriculture suggest to reformulate the relationship between cities (figure) and rural (background), assigning it the value of natural infrastructure, and therefore a public good, and resource. All this is a correspondence in a widespread demand for new natural, which is reflected in the changes taking place in terms of behavior and consumption in the sphere of living and leisure...|$|R

Integrated catchment management approaches in Queensland in the 1990 s failed to alter farm practices to address this pollution. Action research was used to develop and implement a novel approach to <b>peri-urban</b> <b>agricultural</b> catchment management. The project developed and refined the FarmFLOW framework, which is an area-wide adaptive management approach to extension, specifically for high-value but high-risk <b>peri-urban</b> <b>agricultural</b> catchments that feature a diverse mix of land uses. Over four years, the project achieved its target of 30 per cent of producers adopting all the recommended best management practices. Further, over eighty percent of producers commenced a process of continuous improvement in their adoption of at least some new practices that reduce off-site movement of nutrients of concern by 2011. The project has demonstrated social and economic benefits to producers and a consequent reduction in risk of chronic algal blooms (Lyngbya majuscula) in receiving waters.

40|$|<b>Peri-urban</b> <b>agricultural</b> {{production}} remains important globally and {{its value}} will increase as {{the impacts of}} climate change, energy costs, rising world population and changing patterns of food consumption are felt. Maintaining the natural resource base for food production around cities will become an increasingly important part of city planning. Yet peri-urban areas continue to undergo radical change {{over much of the}} world, displacing traditional agriculture and reducing the capacity of cities to adapt to non-linear change. Urban resilience is best maintained through a regional approach which connects urban and peri-urban systems. Such system relationships are examined in a case study focused on the city of Melbourne in South-East Australia. Peri-urban Melbourne produces a signifi cant proportion of the fruit and vegetables grown in the state of Victoria, but agricultural production on the city&# 039;s outer fringe is under pressure from rapid urban development. This case study examines three scenarios which relate rural and urban land supply and demand, and explore land use planning techniques for limiting rural land development and transferring demand for rural land to regional settlements.
