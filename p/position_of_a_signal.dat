30|$|Similar to {{the overall}} driver-related {{incident}} statistics, wrong-side door activations have been localised to the stations with designs deviating from the standardised design. It could be an unusual <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>signal,</b> Victorian built environment at the legacy stations or other deviation. Furthermore, stations with a different platform side, compared to a previous station, demonstrated increased levels of such incidents. The drivers disagree that either change of the platform side or an unusual positioning of a signal affects their door-opening duties. They scored the attention lapse and distraction high {{as the most important}} potential causes for this type of incident. Difference in the layout of the door control in different cars has been marked high too. However, when the respondents were asked what stations they believe to carry the highest risk and why, they mostly mentioned stations associated with the platform side change for the same reason.|$|E

The Holevo quantity, and hence the mutual information, is at most of order E Δ t / ħ, where E is the average energy of the signal, and Δ t {{is the amount of}} time for which detectors operate. The bound does not depend on the size or mass of the emitting and receiving systems, nor {{on the nature of the}} signal. No restrictions on preparing and processing the signal are imposed. As an example, I consider the encoding of information in the transverse or angular <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>signal</b> emitted and received by systems of arbitrarily large cross-section. In the limit of a large message space, quantum effects become important even if individual signals are classical, and the bound is upheld. Comment: 4 pages, 2 figures; v 2 : minor change...|$|E

40|$|Discussion of how {{range and}} range-difference data types can make {{possible}} precise three-dimensional measurement <b>of</b> ground station <b>positions</b> and the <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> artificial <b>signal</b> source, without explicit dependence upon the signal source trajectory. An effective strategy for such measurement is {{to combine the}} multilateration approach with a VLBI system using natural radio sources. The VLBI methods would provide <b>a</b> coarse grid <b>of</b> three-dimensional benchmark locations on a regional and global scale. Multilateration stations would then occupy these coarse grid locations and provide a means for highly portable, relatively low-cost units to then densify networks on a regional and local scale. Because a multilateration approach can make use of strong artificial radio sources, it makes possible the use of relatively low-cost, highly mobile stations. Such mobile stations are virtually essential for three dimensional surveying in heavily urbanized areas or in rugged terrain...|$|R

30|$|Even though station overruns {{are usually}} {{associated}} with low rail adhesion (LRA), there were several incidents in the studied period which were outside the LRA season. An in-depth investigation of the locations revealed unusual <b>positions</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> running <b>signal.</b> Instead <b>of</b> being at <b>a</b> platform’s end, the running signal at such locations was located further down the line. The respondents indicated that while {{attention is paid to}} the running signal at the platform while coming to a scheduled stop, their perception is that the two (the running signal and the stopping position) are not related. The station overruns have been historically treated as LRA-related incidents in T&W Metro which could have led to the participant not being able to consider other factors. However, the statements were worded {{in a way that does}} not make the association with a certain driver-related incident type obvious. Most respondents have never been in a station overrun incident outside the LRA season. On the other hand, the most important factor in choosing the stopping point for a driver is the ability to interact with driver only operations (DOO) dispatch equipment.|$|R
40|$|The origin <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> emitted <b>signal</b> is {{commonly}} determined using arrays of synchronized receivers {{or through the}} use of directional receivers. In this paper a single omni-directional hydrophone used to estimate the <b>position</b> <b>of</b> periodic acoustic emitters in three dimensions is proposed and studied. The theory behind the method and the alterations to the common range differencing problem to adjust for a single receiver is explained. An extended Kalman filter and a Particle filter are suggested to provide iterative estimators for the state estimation problem. The primary focus of this paper is on the performance and robustness of these filters using measurements available from a single observer. The system containing a moving receiver and periodic emitter was modeled and simulated to validate the theory and analyze the performance when put through different noisy scenarios. Experiments in the field with commercially available hardware have been conducted. The first trial used a boat as platform for the moving receiver, and data was collected and post-processed. The second trial used an AUV as platform where data was processed on-board in real time. Results from these trials show the algorithms combined with the hardware setups produce satisfactory position estimates for the purpose of finer scale behavioral tracking...|$|R
40|$|SummaryModern birds do {{not have}} teeth. Rather, they develop a {{specialized}} keratinized structure, called the rhamphotheca, that covers the mandible, maxillae, and premaxillae. Although recombination {{studies have shown that}} the avian epidermis can respond to tooth-inductive cues from mouse or lizard oral mesenchyme and participate in tooth formation [1, 2], attempts to initiate tooth development de novo in birds have failed. Here, we describe the formation of teeth in the talpid 2 chicken mutant, including the developmental processes and early molecular changes associated with the formation of teeth. Additionally, we show recapitulation of the early events seen in talpid 2 after in vivo activation of β-catenin in wild-type embryos. We compare the formation of teeth in the talpid 2 mutant with that in the alligator and show the formation of decidedly archosaurian (crocodilian) first-generation teeth in an avian embryo. The formation of teeth in the mutant is coupled with alterations in the specification of the oral/aboral boundary of the jaw. We propose <b>an</b> epigenetic model <b>of</b> the developmental modification of dentition in avian evolution; in this model, changes in the relative <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> lateral <b>signaling</b> center over competent odontogenic mesenchyme led to loss of teeth in avians while maintaining tooth developmental potential...|$|R

The bicolour FISH technique involving 18 S- 5. 8 S- 26 S and 5 S ribosomal RNA genes as probes was used to assign physical localization and measurement of rDNA sites on homologous pairs of chromosomes. The two 18 S- 5. 8 S- 26 S rRNA gene sites were at the terminal regions of the short arms of the chromosomes 1 and 2 involving NOR region of chromosome 1.

40|$|A {{spatially}} {{distributed system}} contains <b>a</b> large amount <b>of</b> agents with limited sensing, data processing, and communication capabilities. Recent technological advances {{have opened up}} possibilities to deploy spatially distributed systems for signal sampling and reconstruction. In this paper, we introduce a graph structure for a distributed sampling and reconstruction system by coupling agents in a spatially distributed system with innovative <b>positions</b> <b>of</b> <b>signals.</b> <b>A</b> fundamental problem in sampling theory is the robustness of signal reconstruction {{in the presence of}} sampling noises. For a distributed sampling and reconstruction system, the robustness could be reduced to the stability of its sensing matrix. In a traditional centralized sampling and reconstruction system, the stability of the sensing matrix could be verified by its central processor, but the above procedure is infeasible in a distributed sampling and reconstruction system as it is decentralized. In this paper, we split a distributed sampling and reconstruction system into <b>a</b> family <b>of</b> overlapping smaller subsystems, and we show that the stability of the sensing matrix holds if and only if its quasi-restrictions to those subsystems have uniform stability. This new stability criterion could be pivotal for the design <b>of</b> <b>a</b> robust distributed sampling and reconstruction system against supplement, replacement and impairment of agents, as we only need to check the uniform stability of affected subsystems. In this paper, we also propose an exponentially convergent distributed algorithm for signal reconstruction, that provides a suboptimal approximation to the original signal in the presence of bounded sampling noises...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, {{we present}} a {{systematic}} computer-based approach {{to solve the problem}} of optimum transmitter placement for indoor LTE coverage systems operating in the TVWS. This approach is supported with rigorous simulations that reflect very promising results. This work focuses on the deployment of indoor LTE small cells acting as secondary transmitters in TVWS. Proposed methods make use of measurements stored in a Radio Environment Map (REM) that characterizes the DVB-T reception inside the building under consideration. Under this framework, this work analyses two different approaches for the deployment of small cells. First approach is based on maximizing total secondary transmit power inside the building, while the second approach is based on maximizing the percentage <b>of</b> <b>positions</b> having <b>a</b> <b>Signal</b> to Interference and Noise Ratio (SINR) above a desired threshold. Approaches are validated by means of rigorous simulations supported by real measurements of DVB-T signal reception. Results include optimum secondary transmitter placement, and transmit power values for providing indoor LTE coverage considering operating in a channel adjacent to the one used by DVB-T. These results are compared against exhaustive enumeration techniques and proven to provide very accurate results. Results reveal that when considering system capacity or network throughput, the second approach is more efficient and provides better results than the first approach. To the author's best knowledge, this model is the only model that provides an actual deployment strategy of indoor LTE secondary transmitters while considering interference constraints from adjacent channel DVB-T transmission. While our approaches are only tested in the considered building, the methods used are generic and can be applied in the same manner within any indoor environment provided that the REM for that environment is established...|$|R
