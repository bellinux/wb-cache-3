40|$|Short-time {{work was}} the "German answer" to the {{economic}} crisis. The number of short-time workers strongly increased in the recession and peaked at more than 1. 5 million. Without the extensive use of short-time work, unemployment would have risen by approximately {{twice as much as}} it actually did. Short-time work has certainly contributed to the mild response of the German labor market to the crisis, but this is likely due to the country-specific context. Although the crisis has been overcome and employment is strongly expanding, modified regulations governing short-time work are still in place. This leads to undesired side effects. labor market policy, <b>partially</b> <b>unemployed</b> workers, short-time work compensation, economic crisis...|$|E
40|$|L'auteur cherche à savoir pourquoi, malgré leur inefficacité reconnue, des lois du salaire minimum continuent à être adoptées par les législateurs. The basic {{teaching}} of economies on minimum wage laws is well-known: this legislation is inefficient because {{it results in}} non optimal combinations and locations of resources and therefore in lower total output and employment. What is less easily understood is why this policy is enacted {{in spite of its}} inefficiency. The answer offered in this note is that in addition to being inefficient, minimum wage legislations operate transfers of wealth from unorganized losers to well-organized gainers. Because of this advantage in the political market, the latter are found to dominate the political process. The victims of minimum wage laws belong to two broad categories of people. The direct and most immediate victims are the individuals who are disemployed {{as a result of the}} measure. These persons either become totally or <b>partially</b> <b>unemployed</b> or they choose to withdraw from the labour force in view of their deteriorated employment opportunities. In more concrete terms, the big losers are found in groups with lowest skills, namely 1. the young of both sexes 2. older workers deprived of an opportunity to make their contribution to family income 3. women of all ages and 4. low-wage workers in labour intensive industries located in declining regions. In a more general way, the society as a whole is made worse-off, because consumers have to pay higher prices for goods and services now produced in smaller quantities and taxpayers have to bear a heavier burden to finance unemployment and other social security measures. Representative governments do not enact laws that make only losers. Four groups of persons come out gainers from the adoption of minimum wage laws. First and fore-most, union workers rely on this policy instrument to counter the competition from lower skill non-union workers. Second workers in high wage areas support the policy because it lessens the tendency for manufacturing investments to locate outside their region. Third firms in high wage areas also join the supporters of this legislation in order to protect the value of their assets from potential competitors in low wage areas. Finally low wage workers who are able to retain their jobs are clearly made better-off. From empirical results in the U. S., where minimum wages are lower than in Canada, it would seem that the young lose more in reduced employment than they gain in in-creased wage rates. The effect would be about neutral among male adults. Only adult women would be net gainers. In the U. S., the position taken by the House Representatives on minimum wage rates was found to be consistent with theoretical predictions. Campaign contributions by unions, the level of wages in the district and the level of campaign contributions by small businesses were in that order the most important determinant of roll-call voting. Low-wage and teenage workers also influenced the voting pattern as expected. That gainers prevail over losers should not be surprising. Generally they are members of well organized pressure groups, for which the cost of lobbying and other forms of political action is almost nil. Opponents on the other hand include mostly isolated, ill-informed and unorganized individuals. In raising minimum wages, the governing party gain more votes among the beneficiaries than it looses among the victims...|$|E

Targeting the synovial membrane, cartilage and bone, untreated RA leads to joint destruction, disability and increased mortality.

TULF leader Appapillai Amirthalingam even provided letters of reference to the LTTE and to other Tamil insurgent groups to raise funds. Amirthalingam introduced Prabhakaran to N.S. Krishnan, who later became the first international representative of LTTE. It was Krishnan who introduced Prabhakaran to Anton Balasingham, who later became the chief political strategist and chief negotiator of LTTE.

The leftist parties had remained [...] "non-communal" [...] for a long time, but the Federal Party (as well as its offshoot, the TULF), deeply conservative and dominated by Vellalar casteism, did not attempt to form a national alliance with the leftists in their fight for language rights.|$|R

First, we include a set of basic demographic and socio-economic respondent and household characteristics: a dummy variable with value 1 if the respondent is a male, age of the respondent, age squared, a dummy taking the value 1 if the respondent lives with a partner. We control for education using dummies for intermediate education (secondary general or intermediate vocational) and high education (higher vocational or university), using low education (primary school only or lower vocational schooling) as the benchmark. To capture employment status, we include dummy variables for respondents who are retired, disabled (or <b>partially</b> disabled), <b>unemployed,</b> or homemaker. For workers, we distinguish between the private and the public sectors, where the latter includes health, education, and civil servants. 9 We included time dummies for each month (except one) {{in order to control}} for macro-economic shocks on beliefs, like the financial and economic crisis. We also included a dummy variable that takes the value 0 if the question concerned a 10 -year horizon and value 1 if it concerned a 20 -year horizon.|$|R
3000|$|In a {{significant}} loosening {{of access to}} full disability benefits in the mid- 1970 s, Dutch courts determined that unless disability evaluators could prove otherwise, {{they were required to}} attribute a partially disabled worker’s lack of employment to discriminatory behavior. The result was that it became “administrative practice” to treat <b>unemployed,</b> <b>partially</b> disabled persons as if they were fully disabled. That interpretation of the law made assessing lost earnings capacity unnecessary beyond the minimum 15 [*]%. This practice essentially made the Dutch partial disability system a very generous full disability program. Consequently, in [...] the 1970 s, the disability recipiency rate in the Netherlands grew 11.15 [*]% per year (Table  1; Fig.  3, Panel B).|$|R

This essentially made the Dutch partial disability system a very generous full disability program. These increases in eligibility together with the generosity of the system in large part explain the 11.45 percent per year increase in adjusted Dutch disability recipiency rates seen in Table  1 and Figure  3, Panel C, during the 1970 s.|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} {{plan is the}} signed appendix to the benefit decision notice in which the administrative agency defines the client's path towards employment and in which the rights and obligations of both parties to ensure the successful completion of the plan are laid down. The {{development plan}} is given shape in accordancy with the resources to be put in. The administrative agency is authorized to draw up this plan, or to issue instructions for it o be drawn up, {{in consultation with the}} client, on grounds of legislation in a formal sense or a municipal ordinance. The development plan as a tool was included in the Dutch National Assistance Act (Abw), the Dutch Act on Income Provisions for Older and <b>Partially</b> Disabled <b>Unemployed</b> Persons (IOAW) and the Dutch Act on Income Provisions for Older and Partially Disabled Formerly Self-employed Persons (IOAZ) in 1996 and in the Dutch Jobseekers Employment Act (WIW) in 1998. In 2002 the tool was also included in the employee benefit schemes with the introduction of the Dutch Act on the Structure of the Implementation of the Work and Income Act (SUWI Act). The purpose of this research is to answer the question whether this tool should be used in reintegration projects and why the development plan is the right tool. The research question reads: Is the development plan a suitable tool for the reintegration of benefits recipients and unemployed persons not entitled to a benefit...|$|R
