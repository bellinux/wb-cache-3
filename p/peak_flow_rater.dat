40|$|Background. <b>Peak</b> expiratory <b>flow</b> (‘‘peak flow’’) predicts {{important}} {{outcomes in}} older persons. Nevertheless, its clinical application is uncertain because prior strategies for reporting <b>peak</b> <b>flow</b> {{may not be}} valid. We thus determined the frequency distribution of <b>peak</b> <b>flow</b> by the conventional strategy of percent predicted (%predicted) and by an alternative method termed standardized residual (SR) percentile, and evaluated how these two metrics relate to health status in older persons. Methods. Participants included 754 community-dwelling persons aged 70 years. Data included chronic conditions, frailty indicators, and <b>peak</b> <b>flow.</b> Results. Mean age was 78. 4 years, with 63. 7 % reporting a smoking history, 17. 4 % chronic lung disease, and 77. 1 % having one or more frailty indicators. <b>Peak</b> <b>flow</b> 80 %predicted was recorded in 67. 5 % of participants, whereas <b>peak</b> <b>flow</b> 80 th SR percentile was only noted in 15. 9 %. A graded relationship was observed between <b>peak</b> <b>flow</b> and health status, but %predicted yielded health risk at <b>peak</b> <b>flows</b> currently considered normal (80 – 100 %predicted), whereas SR percentile conferred health risk only at severely reduced <b>peak</b> <b>flows</b> (, 50 th SR percentile). Conclusions. <b>Peak</b> <b>flow</b> expressed as SR percentile attains a frequency distribution more consistent with the characteristics of our elderly cohort, and establishes health risk at more appropriate levels of reduced <b>peak</b> <b>flow.</b> These findings establish the need for longitudinal studies based on SR percentile to further evaluate the use of <b>peak</b> <b>flow</b> as a ris...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND—A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to investigate the}} compliance with and accuracy of <b>peak</b> <b>flow</b> diaries in childhood asthma.  METHODS—Forty asthmatic children (5 - 16 years) were asked to perform <b>peak</b> <b>flow</b> measurements twice daily for 4 weeks {{by means of an}} electronic <b>peak</b> <b>flow</b> meter and to record values in a written diary. Patients and parents were unaware that the device stored the <b>peak</b> <b>flow</b> values on a microchip. In random order, half of the patients were only told that the device allowed for more accurate assessment of <b>peak</b> <b>flow</b> while the other half were told that accurate recording of <b>peak</b> <b>flow</b> was important because the results would be used in guiding adjustments to treatment. Data in the written diary (reported data) were compared with those from the electronic diary (actual data).  RESULTS—In the entire study population the mean (SD) actual compliance (77. 1 (20. 5) %) was much lower than the mean reported compliance (95. 7 (9. 1) %) (95 % CI for difference 12. 7 % to 24. 4 %) The percentage of correct <b>peak</b> <b>flow</b> entries decreased from 56 % to < 50 % from the first to the last study week (p< 0. 04), mainly {{as a result of an}} increase in self-invented <b>peak</b> <b>flow</b> entries.

40|$|SummaryBackground: There is {{widespread}} use of <b>peak</b> <b>flow</b> meters in both hospitals and general practice. Previous studies to assess <b>peak</b> <b>flow</b> meter accuracy have shown {{significant differences in the}} values obtained from different meters. However, many of these studies did not use human subjects for <b>peak</b> <b>flow</b> measurements and did not compare meters of varying usage. In this study human subjects have been used with meters of varying usage. Methods: Participants were tested using two new (meters A and C) and one old <b>peak</b> <b>flow</b> meter (meter B) in random order. The study was double-blinded. Participants were recruited from the university campus. Results: Four hundred and nine individuals participated. The difference between <b>peak</b> <b>flow</b> means of A and B was − 9. 93 l/min (95 % CI: − 12. 37 to − 7. 48, P< 0. 0001). The difference between <b>peak</b> <b>flow</b> means of B and C was 20. 08 l/min (95 % CI: 17. 85 – 22. 29, P< 0. 0001). The difference between <b>peak</b> <b>flow</b> means of A and C was 10. 15 l/min (95 % CI: 7. 68 – 12. 61, P< 0. 0001).

The aim {{of the present study}} was to obtain reliable {{reference values}} for the variation in <b>peak</b> <b>flow</b> and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) in healthy schoolchildren using home spirometry with electronic data storage. Healthy schoolchildren (n= 204; 100 males) aged 6 - 16 yrs measured their <b>peak</b> <b>flow</b> and FEV 1 twice daily for 2 weeks using an electronic home spirometer. The variation in <b>peak</b> <b>flow</b> and FEV 1 were calculated as a diurnal amplitude as a percentage of the day's mean. The mean <b>peak</b> <b>flow</b> variation was 6. 2 % (95 th percentile 12. 3 %) and the mean FEV 1 variation was 5. 7 % (95 th percentile 11. 8 %).

40|$|Climate {{change is}} {{expected}} to have large impacts on <b>peak</b> <b>flows.</b> However, there may be bias in the simulation of <b>peak</b> <b>flows</b> by hydrological models. This study aims to improve the simulation of <b>peak</b> <b>flows</b> under climate change in Lanjiang catchment, east China, by comparing two approaches: postprocessing of <b>peak</b> <b>flows</b> and composite objective calibration. Two hydrological models [Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and modèle du Génie Rural à 4 paramètres Journalier (GR 4 J) ] are employed to simulate the daily flows, and the peaks-over-threshold method is used to extract <b>peak</b> <b>flows</b> from the simulated daily flows. Three postprocessing methods, namely, the quantile mapping method and two generalized linear models, are set up to correct the biases in the simulated raw <b>peak</b> <b>flows.</b> A composite objective calibration of the GR 4 J model by taking the <b>peak</b> <b>flows</b> into account in the calibration process is also carried out. The regional climate model Providing Regional Climates for Impacts Studies (PRECIS) with boundary forcing from two GCMs (HadCM 3 and ECHAM 5) under greenhouse gas emission scenario A 1 B is applied to produce the climate data for the baseline period and the future period 2011 – 40.

40|$|AIM: To {{study the}} effect of a warm up {{schedule}} on exercise-induced asthma in asthmatic children to enable them to engage in asthmogenic activities. METHOD: In the first study, <b>peak</b> <b>flows</b> during and after three short, repeated warm up schedules (SRWU 1, 2, and 3), identical in form but differing in intensity, were compared in 16 asthmatic children. In the second study the efficiency of the best of these SRWU schedules was tested on 30 young asthmatic children. Children performed on different days a 7 minute run alone (EX 1) or the same run after an SRWU (EX 2). RESULTS: The second study showed that for most children (24 / 30) the fall in <b>peak</b> <b>flow</b> after EX 2 was less than that after EX 1. The percentage fall in <b>peak</b> <b>flow</b> after EX 2 was significantly correlated with the percentage change in <b>peak</b> <b>flow</b> induced by SRWU 2 (r = 0. 68). The children were divided into three subgroups according to the change in <b>peak</b> <b>flow</b> after SRWU 2 : (G 1 : increase in peak flow; G 2 : 15 % fall in <b>peak</b> <b>flow).</b> Only the children in the G 3 subgroup did not show any gain in <b>peak</b> <b>flow</b> after EX 2 compared with EX 1. CONCLUSION: The alteration in <b>peak</b> <b>flow</b> {{at the end of the}} SRWU period was a good predictor of the occurrence of bronchoconstriction after EX 2. An SRWU reduced the decrease in <b>peak</b> <b>flow</b> for most of the children (24 / 30) in this series, thus reducing subsequent post-exercise deep bronchoconstriction. ...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Early {{detection}} {{and treatment of}} patients with asthma or chronic bronchitis who have a rapid annual decline in lung function is essential {{in order to improve}} their long-term prognosis. This annual rate of decline can be assessed accurately by monitoring the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) which is a routine procedure in hospital respiratory laboratories but not in general practice. General practitioners usually measure patients' <b>peak</b> expiratory <b>flow</b> rate (<b>peak</b> <b>flow)</b> to evaluate lung function. If annual decline in lung function can be assessed by monitoring <b>peak</b> <b>flow,</b> this method could be used in general practice for detecting patients at an early stage who have a rapid decline. AIM: A study aimed to investigate the long-term correlation between FEV 1 and <b>peak</b> <b>flow</b> among a group of patients in Nijmegen, the Netherlands. METHOD: FEV 1 and <b>peak</b> <b>flow</b> were monitored in 53 patients with moderate asthma and 78 patients with moderate chronic bronchitis over four years. FEV 1 was measured in a laboratory once every six months and <b>peak</b> <b>flow</b> was measured by patients once a week. The correlation between the two sets of measurements was studied for each patient. RESULTS: Four-year data for 83 of the 131 patients were analysed; the other 48 patients received inhaled steroids {{during the second half of}} the study period so their data were not considered for all the analyses. Of the 83 patients, 35 (42 %) showed a decrease in both FEV 1 and <b>peak</b> <b>flow.</b> Thirty six patients (43 %) showed a decrease in FEV 1 and an increase in <b>peak</b> <b>flow.</b> Four patients (5 %) showed an increase in FEV 1 and a decrease in <b>peak</b> <b>flow</b> and eight patients (10 %) showed an increase in both rates. Approximately similar results were seen in a separate analysis of all 131 patients during the first two years of the study. CONCLUSION: No long-term correlation was found between FEV 1 and <b>peak</b> <b>flow.</b> <b>Peak</b> <b>flow</b> is not capable of detecting annual decline in lung function. Therefore it cannot be used to detect patients with asthma or chronic bronchitis who have a rapid annual decline in lung function. Spirometers, which measure <b>peak</b> <b>flow</b> and FEV 1, could be used in general practice. These would allow general practitioners to continue measuring <b>peak</b> <b>flow</b> in order to assess short-term changes in lung function while providing an important means for monitoring FEV 1 to assess long-term changes in lung function...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThere is {{uncertainty}} {{about the development of}} airway tolerance to β -agonists and the phenomenon of rebound bronchoconstriction on β -agonist withdrawal. We have recently completed a study of the regular terbutaline and budesonide treatment in asthma. We report our observations on the effect of starting and stopping terbutaline treatment on morning and evening <b>peak</b> <b>flows.</b> The study was a randomized four-way, double-dummy, cross-over comparison of regular inhaled terbutaline (500 – 1000 μ g four times daily), budesonide, combined treatment and matching placebo. Each treatment was given for 6 weeks following a 4 week single-blind placebo washout. Ipratropium was used for symptom relief. No other asthma medication was permitted during either the treatment or wash-out periods. Evaluable data were obtained from 52 subjects for both placebo and terbutaline treatment. Changes in mean morning and evening <b>peak</b> <b>flows</b> during terbutaline treatment were compared to the baseline <b>peak</b> <b>flows</b> during the last 2 weeks of the preceding washout. The <b>peak</b> <b>flow</b> changes on stopping terbutaline were also analysed. Mean morning <b>peak</b> <b>flow</b> was not significantly different during terbutaline treatment when compared to either baseline or placebo treatment. Evening <b>peak</b> <b>flows</b> were significantly higher during terbutaline treatment [mean increase 23 · 1 l min− 1 (95 %CI= 18 · 8, 27 · 4) ]. Analysis of the <b>peak</b> <b>flow</b> changes on a day-by-day basis revealed an initial increase in morning <b>peak</b> <b>flows</b> for the first 2 days of treatment of 19 · 2 and 13 · 4 l min− 1 [increases of 25 · 0 and 17 · 3 l min− 1 in comparison with the corresponding values during placebo (P< 0 · 01) ] followed by a return to baseline. The increase in evening <b>peak</b> <b>flows</b> was also greater for the first 2 days of treatment than {{for the remainder of the}} treatment period (P< 0 · 01). On ceasing terbutaline treatment there was a fall in mean morning <b>peak</b> <b>flow</b> below the baseline on the following morning of 21 · 6 l min− 1 (P< 0 · 05 compared to placebo). The temporary increase in morning <b>peak</b> <b>flows</b> and greater than expected rise in evening <b>peak</b> <b>flows</b> for the first 2 days of treatment suggest the development of tolerance to the bronchodilator effect of terbutaline. Similarly, the fall in morning <b>peak</b> <b>flows</b> on treatment withdrawal suggests rebound bronchoconstriction. These effects are likely to be mediated by downregulation of the β -receptor during treatment. The clinical significance of these changes is uncertain in view of the stability of overall asthma control during terbutaline treatment, but sudden withdrawal of β -agonist treatment could conceivably lead to a deterioration in asthma control...|$|R

All children performed twice daily spirometry at home, unsupervised and completed a symptom diary every morning. They were visited at approximately 4 weekly intervals. At each visit quality of life and use of health services were recorded.;There were no differences in mean daily symptom score, lung function, quality of life score or use of health services between the groups over time. During acute episodes children responded to changes in symptoms, irrespective of the randomisation group, so that <b>peak</b> <b>flow</b> did not contribute to self-management decisions.;In conclusion, knowledge of <b>peak</b> <b>flow</b> did not add significantly to the management of asthma in these children, even during acute exacerbations...|$|R

In the present case, sub-watersheds have lower R f [...] value (0.26 – 0.76) indicating them to be elongated in shape and suggesting flatter <b>peak</b> <b>flow</b> for longer duration.

40|$|Recent {{large-scale}} flood {{events in}} Iowa demonstrate {{a need to}} understand how drainage alteration, specifically through tile drainage and ditches related to intensive agriculture, affect <b>peak</b> <b>flow</b> events and streamflow hydrology. This research tested the hypothesis that there is a relationship between tile drainage and <b>peak</b> <b>flow</b> events, specifically that tile drainage increases the occurrence of <b>peak</b> <b>flow</b> events. The first objective was to implement a physically based, coupled surface water/groundwater model (HydroGeoSphere - HGS) in the South Fork watershed in north-central Iowa. The second objective was to sample and analyze precipitation, surface water, groundwater, and tile water for stable isotopes from August 2011 to July 2013 in order to implement and model isotopic hydrograph separation during a <b>peak</b> <b>flow</b> event. The intent of that work was to delineate the source of water in the flood. Due to the inability of the HGS model to converge, the model was abandoned and efforts were refocused on using stable isotopes to predict water sources during <b>peak</b> <b>flow</b> events. The drought of 2012 provided an opportunity to investigate how tiles interact with other hydrologic components during a hydrologic extreme. Results suggest that tile drainage water [...] which is often a mixture of surface intakes water, saturated macropore flow, and groundwater [...] was fed exclusively by groundwater during the drought. In contrast, tile water is a combination of these sources under normal hydrologic conditions. During a precipitation and flood event in late May 2013 water pooled around surface intakes, stream discharge reached two-year peaks, and the tile water isotopic composition moved significantly away from groundwater towards the composition of precipitation. These results suggest that surface runoff to the tiles would be the dominant component fed to streams during <b>peak</b> <b>flow,</b> and that isotopic hydrograph separation may prove useful when <b>peak</b> <b>flow</b> occurs again. Although HGS was not useful for simulating <b>peak</b> <b>flow</b> and hydrograph separation in this research, it will be a useful tool, along with stable isotopes, to continue investigations of this type in the future...|$|R
40|$|Open ditch {{drainage}} {{has historically}} been a common land management practice in upland blanket peats, particularly in the UK. However, peatland drainage is now generally considered to have adverse effects on the upland environment, including increased <b>peak</b> <b>flows.</b> As a result, drain blocking has become a common management strategy in the UK over recent years, although there is only anecdotal {{evidence to suggest that}} this might decrease <b>peak</b> <b>flows.</b> The change in the hydrological regime associated with the drainage of blanket peat and the subsequent blocking of drains is poorly understood, therefore a new physics-based model has been developed that allows the exploration of the associated hydrological processes. A series of simulations is used to explore the response of intact, drained and blocked drain sites at field scales. While drainage is generally found to increase <b>peak</b> <b>flows,</b> the effect of drain blocking appears to be dependent on local conditions, sometimes decreasing and sometimes increasing <b>peak</b> <b>flows.</b> Based on insights from these simulations we identify steep smooth drains as those that would experience the greatest reduction in field-scale <b>peak</b> <b>flows</b> if blocked and recommend that future targeted field studies should be focused on examining surface runoff characteristics...|$|R
40|$|Evolutionary algorithms, {{which are}} {{frequently}} {{used in an}} automatic calibration of watershed runoff simulation models, are unconstrained optimization algorithms. An additional method is required to impose constraints on those algorithms. The {{purpose of the study}} is to modify the SCE-UA (shuffled complex evolution-University of Arizona) to impose constraints by a penalty function and to improve performance of the automatic calibration module of the SWMM (storm water management model) linked with the SCE-UA. As indicators related to <b>peak</b> <b>flow</b> are important in watershed runoff event simulation, error of <b>peak</b> <b>flow</b> and error of <b>peak</b> <b>flow</b> occurrence time are selected to set up constraints. The automatic calibration module including the constraints was applied to the Milyang Dam Basin and the Guro 1 Pumping Station Basin. The automatic calibration results were compared with the results calibrated by an automatic calibration without the constraints. Error of <b>peak</b> <b>flow</b> and error of <b>peak</b> <b>flow</b> occurrence time were greatly improved and the original objective function value is not highly violated in the automatic calibration including the constraints. The automatic calibration model with constraints was also verified, and the results was excellent. In conclusion, the performance of the automatic calibration module for watershed runoff even...|$|R
