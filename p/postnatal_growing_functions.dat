The enzyme activity in the particulate fraction increased slightly. Immunoblot analyses showed that the postnatal increase in the activity was correlated {{with an increase in}} the enzyme protein. The quantity of mRNA of the liver transglutaminase did not change significantly during the <b>postnatal</b> <b>growing</b> phase examined. These results indicated that transglutaminase may be involved in the postnatal development of guinea pig liver and that the amount of transglutaminase in the postnatal liver may be controlled post-transcriptionally...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} equidistant polynomial splines S(x) which may grow as O|x | s. We present an integral representation of such splines with a distribution kernel. This representation {{is related to}} the Fourier integral of slowly <b>growing</b> <b>functions.</b> The part of the Fourier exponentials herewith play the so called exponential splines by Schoenberg. The integral representation provides a flexible tool for dealing with the growing equidistant splines. First, it allows us to construct a rich library of splines possessing the property that translations of any such spline form a basis of corresponding spline space. It is shown that any such spline is associated with a dual spline whose translations form a biorthogonal basis. As examples we present solutions of the problems of projection of a <b>growing</b> <b>function</b> onto spline spaces and of spline interpolation of a <b>growing</b> <b>function.</b> We construct formulas for approximate evaluation of splines projecting a function onto the spline space and establish therewith exact estimations of the approximation errors. 1...|$|R
40|$|While {{much work}} has been done to {{characterize}} the Turing degrees computing members of various collections of fast <b>growing</b> <b>functions,</b> much less has been done to characterize the rate of growth necessary to compute particular degrees. Prior work has shown that every degree computed by all sufficiently fast <b>growing</b> <b>functions</b> is uniformly computed by all sufficiently fast <b>growing</b> <b>functions.</b> We show that the rate of growth sufficient for a function to uniformly compute a given Turing degree can be separated by an arbitrary number of jumps from the rate of growth that suffices for a function to non-uniformly compute the degree. These results use the unpublished method Harrington developed to answer McLaughlin’s conjecture so we begin the paper with a rigorous presentation of the approach Harrington sketched in his handwritten notes on the conjecture. We also provide proofs for the important computability theoretic results Harrington noted were corollaries of this approach. In particular we provide the first published proof of Harrington’s result that there is an effectively given sequence o...|$|R

40|$|There are two {{well known}} systems formalizing total {{recursion}} beyond primitive recursion (PR), system T by Gödel and system F by Girard and Reynolds. system T defines recursion on typed objects and can construct every function of Heyting arithmetic (HA). System F introduces type variables which can define the recursion of system T. The {{result is a}} system as expressive as second-order Heyting arithmetic (HA_ 2).

The body of this robot is a single point and the legs {{are attached to the}} body. The robot is subject to two constraints: each leg has a maximal extension R (accessibility constraint) and the body of the robot must lie above the convex hull of its feet (stability constraint). Moreover, the robot can only put its feet on some regions, called the foothold regions. The free space F is the set of positions of the body of the robot such that there exists a set of accessible footholds for which the robot is stable. We present an efficient algorithm that computes F in O(n 2 log n) time using O(n 2 α(n)) space for n discrete point footholds where α(n) is an extremely slowly <b>growing</b> <b>function</b> (α(n) � 3 for any practical value of n).
