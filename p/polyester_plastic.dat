25|$|Biafra (1970–1978) was a {{group of}} Croatian artists that rebelled against the artistic, social and {{cultural}} conventions of the day, and engaged with real problems through their art. Individual members ranged in style from pop-art and minimalism to new figuration. The sculptors of the group used new materials in their work, such as <b>polyester,</b> <b>plastic,</b> jute, aluminum, and glass wool, while the painters engaged with imaginative, expressive, rich colors. The content of their art was expressionist, clear and direct. Exhibitions and activities were organized on the streets, presenting their ideas directly to the public. The group originally consisted of the young sculptors Branko Bunić, Stjepan Gračan, Ratko Petrić and Miro Vuco. Membership expanded over the years to include Ivan Lesiak, Zlatko Kauzlarić Atač, Rudolf Labaš, Vlado Jakelić, Stanko Jančić, Ratko Janjić-Jobo, Đurđica Zanoški-Gudlin, Emil Robert Tanay.|$|E

50|$|Futuro, or Futuro House, is a round, {{prefabricated}} house designed by Matti Suuronen, of which fewer than 100 were built {{during the late}} 1960s and early 1970s. The distinctive flying saucer-like shape and airplane hatch entrance has made the houses popular among collectors. The Futuro is composed of fiberglass-reinforced <b>polyester</b> <b>plastic,</b> polyester-polyurethane, and poly(methylmethacrylate), measuring 13 feet (4 metres) high and 26 feet (8 metres) in diameter.|$|E
50|$|Fibre-reinforced plastic (FRP) (also called fibre-reinforced polymer, or fiber-reinforced plastic) is a {{composite}} material made of a polymer matrix reinforced with fibres. The fibres are usually glass, carbon, aramid, or basalt. Rarely, other fibres such as paper, wood, or asbestos have been used. The polymer is usually an epoxy, vinylester, or <b>polyester</b> thermosetting <b>plastic,</b> though phenol formaldehyde resins are still in use.|$|R

40|$|Polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) and {{polyethylene}} teraphthalate (PET) {{are cheap}} and common <b>polyester</b> <b>plastics</b> {{used throughout the}} world in the manufacturing of bottled drinks, containers for foodstuffs, and fibers used in clothing. These plastics are also known organic scintillators with very good scintillation properties. As particle physics experiments increase in energy and particle flux density, so does radiation exposure to detector materials. It is therefore important that scintillators be tested for radiation tolerance at these generally unheard of doses. We tested samples of PEN and PET using laser stimulated emission on separate tiles exposed to 1 MRad and 10 MRad gamma rays with a 137 Cs source. PEN exposed to 1 MRad and 10 MRad emit 71. 4 % and 46. 7 % of the light of an undamaged tile, respectively, and maximally recover to 85. 9 % and 79. 5 % after 5 and 9 days, respectively. PET exposed to 1 MRad and 10 MRad emit 35. 0 % and 12. 2 % light, respectively, and maximally recover to 93. 5 % and 80. 0 % after 22 and 60 days, respectively...|$|R

5000|$|It was {{the first}} car {{launched}} by Alpine under Renault ownership (though Alpine had been affiliated with Renault for many years, with its earlier models using many Renault parts). It effectively updated the design of its predecessor, the Alpine A310, updating that car's silhouette with modern design features like body-integrated bumpers and a triangular C pillar with large rear windshield. It used the PRV V6 engine in a rear-engined layout, with extensive use of <b>Polyester</b> <b>plastics</b> and fibreglass for the body panels making it considerably lighter and quicker than rivals such as the Porsche 944. It {{was one of the}} most aerodynamic cars of its time, the naturally aspirated version achieved a world record 0.28 drag coefficient in its class. The GTA name, used to denote the entire range of this generation, stands for [...] "Grand Tourisme Alpine" [...] but in most markets the car was marketed as the Renault Alpine V6 GT or as the Renault Alpine V6 Turbo. In Great Britain it was sold simply as the Renault GTA, as Sunbeam (and then Chrysler/Talbot) had been using the [...] "Alpine" [...] badge since the 1950s.|$|R
50|$|In the {{following}} table, the estimated world polyester production is shown.

5000|$|The {{material}} {{chosen for}} the project [...] - [...] fibreglass-reinforced <b>polyester</b> <b>plastic</b> [...] - [...] was familiar to Suuronen and was previously used {{in the design of}} a large plastic dome for the roof of a grain silo in Seinäjoki. To facilitate transport, the house consisted of 16 elements that were bolted together to form the floor and the roof. The project could be constructed on site, or dismantled and reassembled on site in two days, or even airlifted in one piece by helicopter to the site. The only necessity on site for its placement were four concrete piers, so the project could occupy nearly any topography. Due to the integrated polyurethane insulation and electric heating system, the house could be heated to a comfortable temperature in only thirty minutes, from -20 to 60 °F (-28,8 to 15,6 °C).|$|E
50|$|The {{development}} {{in the beginning of}} the 20th century resulted in the need for a larger factory, as the company located at the center of the historic city became too small. A spacious factory for constructing hydraulic fruit, wine and oil presses was built. After the Second World War the Dieffenbacher group specialized in heavy equipment construction and could gain ground in the timber industry in 1954. The first chipboard and inlay presses were built. Furthermore, plywood facilities and pattern facilities to refine chipboards were adopted in the product range. In the mid-60’s Dieffenbacher developed a spotting press with pivoting slide plates and extendable desk. This type of press is the precursor of today’s tryout press. From 1960’s onwards Dieffenbacher built presses for fiber-reinforced <b>polyester</b> <b>plastic</b> processing and became the market leader of this branch in the 1970s. With the entry of Wolf-Gerd Dieffenbacher as managing director in 1980 the development to a complete system manufacturer and the internationalization of the company with numerous start-ups, acquisitions and worldwide expansion of sales offices and service-centers. The Dieffenbacher group is represented in 22 locations worldwide today.|$|E

The development of the forespore membrane {{was found to be}} similar to that already described for the genus Bacillus, being, in addition, accompanied by considerable cell enlargement. The cortex, as in the bacilli, was found between the apposed layers of the double forespore membrane. The spore coat was laid down in the narrow zone of cytoplasm peripheral to the outer forespore membrane. As these layers formed, striking changes occurred in the fine structure of the spore nuclear material, mesosomes and ribosomes, reflecting the marked alterations in physical environment known to occur in a developing spore...|$|E

40|$|An UV-dosimeter {{has been}} {{developed}} for routine measurements which mainly weights the various components of the spectrum {{in relation to their}} damaging effects on a microorganism. For this purpose a biofilm was constructed, comprising dried spores of Bacillus subtilis (wild-type or DNA repair defective strain), immobilized on transparent <b>polyester</b> <b>plastic</b> sheets. After irradiation, the biofilm was incubated in a growth medium. The proteins, synthesized by immobilized microorganisms after spore germination and several cell divisions, were stained and determined by photometry, giving a measure of the biological activity. The "biological effective dose" was determined from a calibration curve. It reflects the dose equivalent to that of the calibration source producing the same effect. The UV-response of the biofilm is additive and follows the reciprocity law in the range of fluence rates investigated. The response is nearly independent of temperature within the range of 20 °C to + 70 °C as well as of humidity between about 37 % and 80 % relative humidity. Storage for up to 9 months at < 70 % relative humidity and room temperature does not influence the viability of the spores to a significant rate...|$|E

At least two types of binding have been described unipolar-polysaccharide dependent polar attachment and UPP-independent attachment (both polar and lateral). The genes encoding the enzymes for the production of the former are located on the circular chromosome, while the genes involved in the latter have not been identified.
