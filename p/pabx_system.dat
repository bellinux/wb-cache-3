In 1992, it introduced video conferencing facilities nationwide as well as Centrex, a virtual <b>PABX</b> <b>system</b> that allows larger organisations the option of functioning without operators, enabling customers to reach staff directly.

This is why Step 10 is represented twice in the diagram. However, {{it does not mean}} that a system will receive the event Connected twice. Indeed, the Calling and Receiving states are mutually exclusive in the same layer and just one of them will be handling events in a certain moment.|$|E

But, for those nuclear power plants which are currently in service, wireless technology did not get fully used, some even in unused condition.

40|$|As the {{telegram}} {{was replaced by}} telephony, so to Voice over IP (VoIP) systems are replacing conventional switched wire telephone devices, these systems rely on Internet connectivity for the transmission of voice conversations. This paper is an outline of ongoing preliminary research into malfeasant VoIP activity on the Internet. 30 years ago <b>PABX</b> <b>systems</b> were compromised by hackers wanting to make long distance calls at some other entities expense. This activity faded as telephony became cheaper and <b>PABX</b> <b>systems</b> had countermeasures installed to overcome attacks. Now the world has moved onto the provision of telephony via broadband enabled Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) this service is now being provided {{as a replacement for}} conventional fixed wire telephony by major telecommunication providers worldwide. Due to increasing bandwidth it is possible for systems to support multiple voice connections simultaneously. The networked nature of the Internet allows for attackers of these VoIP systems to enumerate and potentially attack and compromise a wide range of vulnerable systems...|$|R
50|$|The Do Not Disturb or (DND) {{function}} on most PBX or <b>PABX</b> <b>systems</b> prevents {{calls from}} ringing on an extension for which DND is activated. Some Do Not Disturb (DND) attributes include directing {{the call to}} a preassigned extension (like a secretary or assistant), busy signal, DND signal, or recorded message generated by the telephone switch. Some switches allow the call to go through to the extension but restrict the response to a visual indication. Some PBX systems allow the assignment of DND circumvention codes to supervisors.|$|R
30|$|Finally, one may {{say that}} the pcb-statechart of Fig. 17 does not reflect {{accurately}} {{the behavior of a}} Skype-like system. For example, that a server receives events and then distributes them appropriately to the systems. Thus, there are not direct multicast interactions among systems like in (2 a, 2 c, 9 a, 9 b, and 9 c). If such server really exists, or it should exist to improve the system architecture, it could be added to the diagram just like the <b>PABX</b> <b>system</b> of Fig. 13. Then, source-to-targets multicast interactions (1 →n) should be changed by a pair source-to-server unicast interaction (1 → 1) and server-to-targets multicast interaction (1 →n).|$|E
40|$|Fast {{advances}} in communication engineering {{especially in the}} office environment, require an integration of different services and the easy accessibility of these services via smaller and more compact equipment. The integration of voice and data has been the goal of ISDN technology. There is also a high demand for the transfer of high speed data (1. 536 Mbps e. g. for computer graphics) across different floors and buildings in a typical office environment. One efficient solution for this is to attempt to integrate LAN within an ISDN <b>PABX</b> <b>system.</b> This thesis examines one such design and the proposed design simulation results are also verified here highlighting how {{the integration of the}} ISDN PABX & LAN can be achieved successfully...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In this work, {{we propose}} a {{framework}} capable of transparently switching between multiple {{hardware and software}} implementations of embedded system components to cope with and adapt to dynamic runtime characteristics such as power, throughput and quality of service. The reconfiguration process is decomposed into small steps such that it is preemptable, transparent, dynamic and compliant with real-time requirements. We present a Private Automatic Branch eXchange (<b>PABX)</b> <b>system</b> {{as a case study}} for the framework, and investigate the dynamic reconfiguration of three of its components: an ADPCM codec, a DTMF detector, and an AES core. Our results with this case study show how our framework is able to perform reconfiguration of hardware/software components in the order of a few milliseconds, without taking excessive system resources, and without disrupting the execution of application threads.

50|$|This was a 746 type {{telephone}} {{which could}} transmit MF4 signalling, {{also known as}} DTMF touch tones. These telephones could only operate to exchanges that could deal with MF4 but they were used on <b>PABX</b> <b>systems</b> that used MF4 for internal calls from the 1970s. The TXE1 exchange could handle MF4 calls {{as early as the}} late 1960s. This was however a unique prototype exchange, which served customers in Leighton Buzzard: otherwise customers did not have access to MF4 capable exchanges until later models of the TXE4 system came into service in the late 1980s.|$|R

5000|$|A {{weakness}} of some <b>PABX</b> <b>systems</b> {{lies in the}} distant voicemail feature, which is accessed by entering a password when the initial greeting is being played. A hacker can call a direct dial number with voicemail, {{and then try to}} use the default password or guess it, or then select the [...] "call back" [...] function, and enter a premium rate number for the call back. The PABX calls back the premium rate line, confirming the password for the hacker. To stop this form of hacking, it is important to turn off the call back feature on the PABX, or to use a strong password.|$|R

Thus the convergence strategy of an IP <b>PABX</b> <b>system</b> with the existing wire telephone network has been discussed.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} an attempt {{is made to}} {{integrate}} the mathematical foundations and the engineering aspects of algebraic specifications. The theoretical concepts are the starting-point {{for the design of}} a practical specification language. The impact of traditional principles of software engineering and advanced features of current high level programming languages {{on the development of the}} specification language is discussed. The main characteristics of the resulting specification language is its constructivity, which enables rapid prototyping. Other important characteristics are its module mechanism and its general parameterization concept. Finally, the language contains an elegant notation supporting an explicit error detection and error handling method. The result may be considered as a strongly typed functionel programming language. Many case studies have been carried out, includign an industrial specification of a call handling <b>system</b> (<b>PABX).</b> These case studies show that an algebraic specificatio as a formalism is not sufficient. It must be accompanied by a design methodology. The design methodology used for the PABX is object-oriented. A more theoretical contribution of this thesis is the elaboration of abstract implementations. Finally, a programming environment that supports the building of algebraic specifications is of major importance. Programming environments and rapid prototyping are briefly discussed. nrpages: 323 status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The present {{explosion}} in digital communications and multi-user wireless cellular networks has urged {{a demand for}} more effective modulation methods, utilizing the available frequency spectrum more efficiently. To accommodate {{a large number of}} users sharing the same available frequency band, one requirement is the availability of large families of spreading sequences with excellent AC and CC properties. Another requirement is the availability of sets of orthogonal basis functions to extend capacity by exploiting all available degrees of freedom (e. g., temporal, frequency and spatial dimesions), or by employing orthogonal multi-code operation in parallel, such as used in the latest 3 GPP and 3 GPP 2 Wide-band Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA) modulation standards by employing sets of orthogonal Walsh codes to improve the overall data throughput capacity. The generic Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) transmitter developed in this dissertation has originally been designed and implemented to investigate the practicality and usefulness of complex spreading sequences, and secondly, to verify the concept of non-linearly interpolated root-of-unity (NLI-RU) filtering. It was found that both concepts have a large potential for application in point-to-point, and particularly micro-cellular Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) and Wireless-Local-Loop (WLL) environments. Since then, several novel concepts and subsystems {{have been added to the}} original system, some of which have been patented both locally and abroad, and are outlined below. Consequently, the ultimate goal of this research project was to apply the principles of the generic DSSS transmitter and receiver developed in this study in the implementation of a WLL radio-frequency (RF) -link, and particularly towards the establishment of affordable wireless multimedia services in rural areas. The extended coverage at exceptionally low power emission levels offered by the new design will be particularly useful in rural applications. The proposed WLL concept can for example also be utilized to add a unique mobility feature to for example existing Private Automatic Branch Exchanges (<b>PABXs).</b> The proposed <b>system</b> will in addition offer superior teletraffic capacity compared to existing micro-cellular technologies, e. g., the Digital European Cordless Telephony (DECT) system, which has been consider by Telkom for employment in rural areas. The latter is a rather outdated interim standard offering much lower spectral efficiency and capacity than competitive CDMA-solutions, such as the concept analyzed in this dissertation, which is based on the use of unique large families of spectrally well confined (i. e., band-limited) constant envelope (CE) complex spreading sequences (CSS) with superior correlation properties. The CE characteristic of the new spreading sequences furthermore facilitates the design of systems with superior power efficiency and exceptionally robust performance characteristics (much less spectral re-growth) compared to existing 2 G and 3 G modulation standards, in the presence of non-linear power amplification. This feature allows for a system with larger coverage for a given performance level and limited peak power, or alternatively, longer battery life for a given maximum communication distance and performance level, within a specified fixed spreading bandwidth. In addition, the possibility to extend the concept to orthogonal multi-code operation provides for comparable capacity to present 3 G modulation standards, while still preserving superior power efficiency characteristics in non-linear power amplification. Conventional spread spectrum communication systems employ binary spreading sequences, such as Gold or Kasami sequences. The practical implementation of such a system is relatively simple. The design and implementation of a spread-spectrum communication system employing complex spreading sequences is however considerable more complex and has not been previously presented, nor been implemented in hardware. The design of appropriate code lock loops for CSS has led to a unique design with 3 dB performance advantage compared to similar loops designed for binary spreading sequences. The theoretical analysis and simulation of such a system will be presented, with the primary focus on an efficient hardware implementation of all new concepts proposed, in the form of a WLL RF-link demonstrator.
