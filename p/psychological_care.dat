40|$|The interrelated {{constructs}} of privacy, confidentiality and privilege, much discussed in legal and medical arenas, are sometimes given perfunctory {{treatment in the}} education and training of sport psychologists. This article briefly traces the history, debate, and practices of ethical delivery of service from Hippocrates to current sport psychology professional relationships. Sport psychologists often operate in looser environments (e. g. on the pool deck, courtside, in the locker room) than those of other psychologists, {{and it seems that}} some concepts of ethical practice, such as confidentiality, are also looser (Andersen, Van Raalte, & Brewer, 2001). This looseness in the field may be, in part, a result of the myriad educational and training pathways people take {{to get to the point}} of acting in <b>psychological</b> <b>caring</b> roles with athletes and coaches. This article is a strident questioning of some of the ethically loose practices of individuals and sport institutes in the world of sport psychology services.

40|$|Purpose The aim of {{this paper}} was to explore the {{learning}} experiences of post-registration nursing students who listened to parents' classroom storytelling about their children with disabilities. Background The nursing education literature provides little information about using movies, books, or case studies as teaching tools. Nurse educators should use a variety of teaching methods to enhance students' learning and clinical competencies. Method For this qualitative study, focus group interviews were used and guided by a set of semi-structured questions. Data were collected in 2009 from nursing students at a university in a metropolitan area of central Taiwan. Of 156 students enrolled in three classes on paediatric nursing, 34 volunteered to share their learning experiences from the storytelling lesson. Results Analysis of the focus group interview content revealed three main themes: facing again the important issues (<b>psychological,</b> <b>caring,</b> and cultural) in nursing care, enhancing learning interest and comprehensive learning, and cherishing their lives. Conclusions The teaching strategy of parents telling their stories in the classroom helped students to reflect on their nursing work experience from the parents' perspective. Such reflection not only enhanced students' professional capabilities and ensured that knowledge was put into clinical practice, but also added meaning to their lives by helping them to cherish their lives.
