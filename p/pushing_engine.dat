50|$|All {{the trains}} {{mentioned}} here were push-pull trains {{and consisted of}} eleven passenger cars (including one control car) and a trailing, pushing electric locomotive. All vehicles with German traditional coupling must pass force (here: tractive effort) either by the coupling (pulling force) or the buffers (pushing force). A <b>pushing</b> <b>engine</b> must not exceed certain force levels (that depend on points, curves, train length, mass and vehicle types), or the train may be distorted, e.g. pushed outwards in a curve. In extreme cases as these, derailment may happen.|$|E

Fuel cost and emissions reduction, in order to fulfil new stringent legislations, are <b>pushing</b> <b>engine</b> manufactures and developers {{in the direction of}} further increasing energy efficiency. In the last years, Organic Rankine Cycles (ORC) are constantly gaining increased interest in order to recover engine waste heat from several sources: exhaust gas, EGR (Exhaust Gas Recirculation), Jacket Cooling Water, CAC (Charge Air Cooler) or oil circuit. However, currently, ORC are mostly developed as a retrofit of existing engines, resulting in a non-optimized powertrain. For this reason, in a preliminary phase of an engine-ORC development project, it could be useful to investigate combined optimized concepts in oder to maximize energy efficiency and reduce emissions. For this purpose, first and second law of thermodynamics techniques can help in order to understand where, in the combined system, irreversibilities destroy exergy, thus increasing system entropy production and reducing overall system performance. Furthermore, an accurate assessment of typical applications duty profiles and thermo-economic techniques can help to design the most efficient and cost effective system...|$|E
40|$|There is {{a strong}} drive to reduce the energy losses from {{automotive}} engines {{in order to improve}} fuel economy and reduce emissions of pollutants. The demands of reducing engine losses are <b>pushing</b> <b>engine</b> manufacturers to consider using technologies such as diamond-like carbon (DLC) coatings to give enhanced wear protection of components and provide low friction operation. Valve-train component interactions are tribologically complex, with contacts commonly experiencing mixed boundary and elasto-hyrdodynamic lubricated sliding wear, abrasive wear, impact and fatigue. Whilst there have been many studies of the mechanical properties and wear resistance of diamond like carbon films, there have been fewer studies of the effect of impact at the contact loads and geometries relevant to the automotive valve-train. Thus, a series of inclined impact tests have been conducted at impact angles from 15 ° to 45 ° on hydrogenated and non-hydrogenated diamond like carbon films with and without lubrication to understand how the films respond to impact under controlled conditions. The results have been compared to the coatings performance in a motored and instrumented cam-tappet testing rig. The results show that impact loading in the valve-train has a significant effect on coating durability. Coating durability is affected by impact angle and lubricant and counter-intuitively the introduction of lubrication decreases the coating durability. This is attributed to the lubricant preventing the formation of beneficial tribolayers and also forming an abrasive slurry where DLC wear particles are retained in the contact and create additional abrasive wear...|$|E
