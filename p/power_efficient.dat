Nuclear reactor accidents still occur and there is no convincing {{solution to the problem of}} long-lived radioactive waste. Nuclear weapons proliferation continues to occur, notably in Pakistan and North Korea, building on facilities and expertise from civilian nuclear operations. The alternatives to nuclear <b>power,</b> <b>efficient</b> energy use and renewable energy (especially wind power), have been further developed and commercialised.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{benchmarks}} on {{its official}} website, the Fastra II is {{faster and more}} <b>power</b> <b>efficient</b> than its competitors, including the Fastra I and the Tesla C1060 video card. The benchmarks were performed on the Fastra II, the Fastra I, a 512-core cluster (consisting of Opteron CPUs), an Nvidia Tesla C1060 workstation card on an Intel Core i7 940 CPU, and on an Intel Core i7 940 CPU itself. The Fastra II is over three {{times faster than the}} Fastra I in CT slice reconstruction speed. Although the Fastra II consumes more power than the Fastra I, it's nearly 3 times as energy efficient as the Fastra I, and over 300 times as energy efficient as the 512-core cluster. The video cards run at 37 degrees Celsius when idle, and at 60 degrees Celsius at full load.|$|E

40|$|The {{irreversible}} {{heat engine}} is reconsidered {{with a general}} heat transfer law. Three criteria known in the literature—power, <b>power</b> density, and <b>efficient</b> power—are redefined {{in terms of the}} work criteria function (WCF), a concept introduced in this study. The formulation enabled the suggestion and analysis of a unique criterion—the <b>efficient</b> <b>power</b> density (which accounts for the efficiency and power density). Practically speaking, the <b>efficient</b> <b>power</b> and the <b>efficient</b> <b>power</b> density could be defined on any order based on the WCF. The applicability of the WCF is illustrated for the Newtonian heat transfer law (n= 1) and for the radiative law (n= 4). The importance of WCF is twofold: it gives an explicit design and educational tool to analyze and to display graphically the different criteria side by side and thus helps in design process. Finally, the criteria were compared and some conclusions were drawn...|$|R

The <b>efficient</b> <b>power</b> {{is defined as the}} multiplication of engine power and engine efficiency. Hence, the proposed method considers not only the power output but also the engine efficiency. Optimizing the <b>efficient</b> <b>power</b> gives a compromise between power and engine efficiency. Results obtained are compared with those obtained by using the maximum power (MP) and maximum power density (MPD) conditions. The results show that the engine designed at maximum <b>efficient</b> <b>power</b> (MEP) criterion is more efficient as compared with those designed at maximum power and maximum power density conditions. The system analysis is done with variable specific heat parameter due to which it...|$|R

500|$|Zenbook (also {{known as}} ZenBook) are {{a family of}} ultrabooks [...] low-bulk laptop {{computers}} [...] produced by Asus. The first Zenbooks were released in October2011, and the original range of products was amended and expanded during 2012. Models range from 12-inch laptops, featuring <b>power</b> <b>efficient</b> components but lacking connectivity and having only integrated graphics processors, to 15-inch laptops with discrete graphics processing units and optical disc drives. Most (though not all) Zenbooks use Intel Core ultra-low-voltage processors and Nvidia GPUs when integrated graphics are not used. Asus introduced new models with touch screens {{to take advantage of}} Windows 8 after its release in late 2012. Most models drew comparisons to the Macbook Air. The most recent release in the Zenbook line is the upmarket Zenbook Infinity UX301 series. The Zenbook mainly competes against computers such as Acer's Aspire, Dell's Inspiron and XPS, HP's Pavilion and Envy, Lenovo's IdeaPad and Toshiba's Satellite.|$|E

40|$|Thermodynamic {{analysis}} {{of an ideal}} air standard Atkinson cycle usnder <b>Efficient</b> <b>Power</b> Density is presented in this paper. Three past known criteria {{in the context of}} Finite time thermodynamics or Entropy Generation Minimization i. e Power, <b>Power</b> density & <b>efficient</b> <b>power</b> are re-casted in terms of Work Criteria Function which is relatively a new approach to analyze the performance & maximize the power output of any heat engines. The formulation of this concept gives rise to new performance criteria i. e <b>Efficient</b> <b>power</b> density(EPD) which is defined as the <b>efficient</b> <b>power</b> divided by maximum volume of working fluid & its maximum value gives Maximum <b>Efficient</b> <b>Power</b> Density(MEPD). This theory has been implemented to calculate the Power output & efficiency of an Atkinson cycle. Finally a comparative study of different criteria has been made to draw the inference & thus result is obtained. The result obtained from this analysis showed that engine designed at MEPD condition are more efficient than those designed at MP,MPD & MEP conditions. This work has been carried out by incorporating relative air fuel ratio, fuel mass flow rate & residual fraction such that these parameters are the function of variable specific heat & it is observed that the efficiency increases with the increase of relative air fuel ratio & residual fraction. This result can be helpful in the thermodynamic modeling & design of practical Atkinson engine...|$|R
