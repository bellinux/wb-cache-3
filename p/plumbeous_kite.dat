50|$|The <b>plumbeous</b> <b>kite</b> (Ictinia plumbea) is a {{bird of prey}} in {{the family}} Accipitridae.|$|E
50|$|Sexes are similar, but {{immature}} {{birds have}} white-streaked grey upperparts and dark-streaked whitish underparts. They lack the rufous wing patch. The call of <b>plumbeous</b> <b>kite</b> is a whistled si-see-oo.|$|E
5000|$|Endemic and/or {{rare species}} of birds include the Red-Masked Parakeet, Pale-browed Tinamou, Pacific Pygmy Owl, Esmeralda Woodstar hummingbird, Gray-backed Hawk, Guayaquil Woodpecker, Pacific Royal-Flycatcher, <b>Plumbeous</b> <b>Kite,</b> Rufous-headed Chachalaca, and the Chocó Toucan.|$|E

50|$|The <b>plumbeous</b> <b>kite</b> has long, pointed wings. Adults {{are mainly}} slate-grey, with a paler head and underparts. The short black tail has 2-3 white bands. The eyes are red and the legs are orange. In flight, this kite shows a rufous primary patch.|$|E
50|$|The <b>plumbeous</b> <b>kite</b> breeds in the neotropic ecozone, {{from eastern}} Mexico to Peru, Bolivia and Argentina. It also breeds on Trinidad. Birds {{in the north}} and south of the {{breeding}} range, including the populations in Central America, Trinidad, Venezuela and Colombia, and southern Argentina and Brazil, are migratory, moving into tropical South America in the northern winter.|$|E
50|$|Average annual {{rainfall}} is 1658 mm.Temperatures {{range from}} 20 to 28 C {{with an average}} of 24 C.The reserve holds areas of marshland and coastal Atlantic Forest in good condition.An exotic eucalyptus forest covers 8.6% of the area, and will be replaced by native species.249 species of trees have been recorded.The <b>plumbeous</b> <b>kite</b> (Ictinia plumbea) visits via the reserve from September to January.The golden lion tamarin (Leontopithecus rosalia) and maned sloth (Bradypus torquatus) are endemic.|$|E

40|$|Some {{species of}} large cicadas (Hemiptera) emerge in huge numbers during {{particular}} periods, and thus become an abundant food source for several vertebrate species that dwell {{in the same}} areas. I record here a small assemblage of six bird species that preyed on the season's first giant cicadas (Quesada gigas) from early September to mid November 2007 in an urban park of Campinas, São Paulo, southeastern Brazil. The <b>Plumbeous</b> <b>Kite</b> (Ictinia plumbea) was the most ubiquitous cicada predator. It waited high on perches or patrolled on wing and hunted adult cicadas only. Three cuckoo species (Crotophaga ani, Guira guira, and Piaya cayana) foraged on cicadas both on vegetation and on the ground, the first one also taking nymphs that emerged from a pond bank. The Common Moorhen (Gallinula chloropus) preyed mostly on nymphs on the pond bank, although it also preyed on adult cicadas that fell in the water, which {{was the case of}} the Green Heron (Butorides striata) as well. With the exception of the <b>Plumbeous</b> <b>Kite,</b> which may specialize on cicadas during the breeding season, the remainder birds behaved as opportunistic predators on this seasonal and abundant food source...|$|E
40|$|Between August and December 2005 and September and December 2006, 80 h of {{observations}} were observed on {{a nest of}} <b>Plumbeous</b> <b>Kite</b> (Ictinia plumbea), located {{on the edge of}} a fragment in the town of Frederico Westphalen, RS, Brazil. During this period data were obtained on the behavior of copulation, parental care, nest maintenance and feeding. In early August 2005 and October 2006, copulations were observed that lasted on average 9. 5 s. The parents took turns incubating. In early November, the presence of nestlings was confirmed (one in each breeding season), and this time the parents fed the chicks with small insects (Hymenoptera and Coleoptera) and carried out the maintenance of the nest. The nestlings that were developing into young birds were fed with larger insects (Odonata, Lepidoptera – Myelobia smerintha and Orthoptera – Tropidacris collaris). The parents inhibited the approach of potential predators. Besides the food items supplied to the pups, they consumed fruits of Batinga Eugenia rostrifolia and a Piaya cayana carcass. The incubation period observed in this study agrees with that period already described in the literature for other regions. Finally, the data obtained allow inference of the reproductive season of this species in southern Brazil and also expand the knowledge about their diet to fruits and animal carcasses...|$|E
40|$|TAXONOMIC UNIQUENESS: One of {{two species}} in Ictinia. The other, I. plumbea is the <b>plumbeous</b> <b>kite</b> of the neotropics. According to AOU 1983 in NatureServe, Ictinia mississippiensis is {{considered}} conspecific with I. plumbea by some authors. DESCRIPTION: A medium-sized raptor with long, pointed wings, with first primary distinctly shorter. Length 33. 0 - 43. 2 cm (13. 0 - 17. 0 in.); wingspread 86. 4 - 94. 0 cm (34. 0 - 37. 0 in); Glinski (1998) reports wingspan of 74 - 84 cm (29 - 33 in). Females {{are larger than}} males: males weigh about 7. 5 - 9. 5 oz., while females weigh about 9. 75 - 12. 0 oz. The head, throat, nape, breast, abdomen, flanks, and wing-linings are light to medium gray; the back and upperwing coverts are darker gray to near-black. Scapulars and other back-feathers rarely show variable white spots. The flight-feathers are black except for the secondaries, which are dorsally pale gray to silvery white. Many adults show variable patches of brownish red on the primaries. The tail is uniformly black; the tip generally squarish to slightly notched. The beak, cere, lores, and narrow circle of feathers around the eye, are black. The iris is scarlet. The stout feet are pale to dark yellow to orange-yellow, with gray or black areas. The sexes are similar, but the head and nape of the male is usually paler than the female. Identificatio...|$|E
