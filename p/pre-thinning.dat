50|$|As {{the trees}} became {{established}} and were approximately 20 feet high all side shoots {{up to six}} feet were removed. This process called brashing ensured easy access, less risk of fire and the first six feet of the tree had a reduced knotty core. The next stage after brashing was <b>pre-thinning</b> this process was carried out after 15 to 16 years. It involved the removal of diseased trees. Larger trees known as wolves were also removed as they suppressed their smaller and straighter more valuable neighbours. Thinning began when the trees were 18 to 20 years old, coinciding with the start of World War 2. At {{this time there was}} much debate about how the work would be carried out. It was decided that racks or access ways 18 to 20 feet in width would be cut and then dividing the compartments into blocks covering 5 acres. Next, two rows of trees were removed to create a rack some 10 feet wide. The thinnings were graded and the straighter poles used as pit props in the coal industry. Other thinnings had a wide range of uses including fencing posts, pea poles in gardens and into netting stakes for the local rabbit warrens. Curved or irregular shaped cuttings was sold as firewood. In 1946, a central processing depot was established at Brandon to process poles into pit-props destined for the East Midlands coalfields. Large amounts of waste material was generated and this attracted a secondary industry of charcoal burning. As the forest matured the quantity of the thinnings increased with the disposal of them continued to be a problem. By 1950, demand from the National Coal Board for the timber decreased and the commission had to find new outlets, these included many of the smaller poles being cut up and converted into wallboard and some 60 tons of pine transported each week to a wood wool factory in Manchester. Large numbers of thinnings were taken to the Commission's own creosote plant at Santon Downham which was established in 1958 before closing in 1970. As the forest matured the size of the material being removed increased and clear felling of mature areas began with felled timber being sold directly to timber merchants. By the mid 1960s chainsaws had been introduced and by the early 1980s specially adapted tractors and trailers known as forwarders came into widespread operation. With the arrival of the harvester in 1991 full mechanization had reached the forest. Some 2500 trees were being extracted each day producing 180,000 cubic metres of timber annually by 1997. Much of this is sold to local saw mills and used in the building industry with the remainder producing fence posts, pallets and pit props.|$|E
40|$|Ion milling, wedge cutting or polishing, {{and focused}} ion beam (FIB) milling are widely-used {{techniques}} for the transmission electron microscope (TEM) sample preparation. Especially, the FIB milling provides a site-specific analysis, deposition, and ablation of materials in the micrometer and nanometer scale. However, the cost of FIB tools has been always a significant concern. Since it is inevitable to use the FIB technique, the improvement of efficiency is a key point. Traditional TEM sample preparation with FIB was routinely implemented on a single sample each time. Aiming at cost efficiency, a new <b>pre-thinning</b> technique for batch sample preparation was developed in this paper. The present proposal combines the sample preparation techniques with multi-samples thinning, cross-section scanning electron microscopy (SEM), wedge cutting, FIB and other sample <b>pre-thinning</b> techniques. The new <b>pre-thinning</b> technique is to prepare an edge TEM sample on a grinding and polishing fixture with a slant surface. The thickness of the wedges sample can be measured to 1 ∼ 2 μm under optical microscope. Therefore, this fixture is superior to the traditional optical method of estimating the membrane thickness. Moreover, by utilizing a multi-sample holding fixture, more samples can be pre-thinned simultaneously, which significantly improved the productivity of TEM sample preparation...|$|E

The watershed is covered with commercial plantations of Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica), Japanese cypress (Chamaecyparis obtusa), red pine (Pinus densiflora) and oak (Quercus spp.). Following an initial <b>pre-thinning</b> period (1996 - 1999), stream flow measurements were continued over a comparable post-thinning period (2000 - 2003) and linear regression models were developed for the two periods to assess the effects of a thinning operation conducted during December 1999 to January 2000. We hypothesized that the regression model for the <b>pre-thinning</b> period is still valid for the post-thinning period and tested this utilizing the Chow`s F Test. A 95 % prediction interval was calculated for the <b>pre-thinning</b> regression models to evaluate changes in individual observations of the post-thinning period. The results suggest that the thinning, carried out on 19. 25 % of the watershed area removing only 6. 35 % of total timber volume, did not cause noticeable effects on direct runoff and peak runoff. Concentration time was found to be decreased after thinning for some storm events. The study revealed that hydrometric method is not enough for detecting noticeable effects of a small thinning operation on direct runoff and peak runoff properties...|$|E

30|$|Maximum {{likelihood}} estimation (procedure NLMIXED in SAS, SAS Institute Inc. 2004) {{was used}} to fit the model to the data. The variance was modelled as a power of the time since the last measurement (Pinheiro and Bates 2000), i.e., Var(ϵi)[*]=[*]σ 2 (ti – ti- 1) 2 δ. Serial correlation should not be an issue since volume is being projected for only one measurement interval. For each measurement in each plot, the standing volume (Vi m 3 /ha) was the dependent variable and the total age (ti years) and the standing volume (Vi- 1) and total age (ti- 1) from the previous measurement were independent variables in the fitting process, {{as well as the}} other variables in Equation  4. Consequently, the volume from the first observation for each plot was not used as a dependent variable since there was not a previous measurement to provide a value for Vi- 1 and ti- 1. For all plots except one Douglas-fir plot, the thinning was done immediately after the plot was established. Therefore, the post-thinning volume (as opposed to the <b>pre-thinned</b> volume) was considered to be the observation for that year except for the one plot where the thinning was not done at plot establishment. For this plot, the <b>pre-thinned</b> volume was used as Vi for that year. The post-thinning volume was obtained by subtracting the volume removed in the thinning from the <b>pre-thinned</b> volume and it was used as Vi- 1 for the next observation. Each species was analyzed independently from the other. Normal quantile-quantile (QQ) plots of the standardized residuals were made to check for normality and plots of the standardized residuals versus the fitted values and the years since the previous measurement (ti – ti- 1) were made to check that the residuals were homoscedastic (Sen and Srivistava 1990).|$|R

40|$|We {{examined}} {{the effect of}} forest thinning on runoff generation at plot and catchment scales in headwater basins draining a Japanese cypress (. Chamaecyparis obtusa) forest. We removed 58. 3 % of the stems (corresponding to 43. 2 % of the basal area) in the treated headwater basin (catchment M 5), and left the control catchment (M 4) untreated. In both catchments, we monitored overland flow from hillslope plots and stream runoff from catchments at basin outlets over a 2 -year <b>pre-thinning</b> period and a 2 -year post-thinning period. Paired catchment analysis revealed that annual catchment runoff increased 240. 7. mm after thinning. Delayed runoff increased significantly, while quick runoff followed similar patterns in the pre- and post-thinning periods. Flow duration in the ephemeral channel in catchment M 5 increased from 56. 9 % in the <b>pre-thinning</b> period to 73. 3 % in the post-thinning period. Despite the changes in hydrological responses at the catchment scale, increases in overland flow were not significant. The increased availability {{of water in the}} soil matrix, caused by decreased interception loss and evapotranspiration, increased base flow after thinning. Based on the summarized data of previous studies together with this study, the effects of forest thinning on increases in runoff were less than partial harvesting in which the managed areas were concentrated within a watershed.

[...] University of Washington, 2012 Organophosphorus (OP) {{pesticides}} {{are some}} of the most widely used insecticides in the United States, and spray applications are a concern for public health due to potential human exposures from distant transport via off target volatilization and particulate drift. Initial tests on active air sampling methods found the NIOSH recommended sampling matrix (OVS XAD- 2 Resin Tubes) to artificially transform substantial amounts of chlorpyrifos (CPF) to its oxygen analog (CPF-O) in the laboratory (up to 32 %) and in the field, leading to inaccuracies in reported levels CPF and CPF-O in past field studies. A series of side-by-side tests identified the PUF matrix as a superior sampling medium for OP pesticides and their oxygen analogs. Passive air sampling methods were developed and tested in a laboratory exposure chamber and in the field to measure airborne exposures to OP pesticides and oxygen analogs in an agricultural community. Results show that the new PUF-PAS method combined with sensitive analysis (LC/MS-MS) may be used to improve our understanding of the continued fate and transport at low levels typical of residential communities down to method limits of quantification of 0. 01 to 0. 05 ng/m 3. PUF-PAS air sampling rates were similar to other semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs), ranging from 1. 6 - 8. 4 m 3 /day. The PUF-PAS devices were deployed in the Yakima Valley region of Washington State and measured cumulative monthly air concentrations during <b>pre-thinning,</b> thinning, and non-application seasons. Results demonstrated that air concentrations of CPF during <b>pre-thinning</b> season were 5 - 10 x higher than AZM during thinning season. Households proximal to tree fruit fields (≤ 250 m) reported significantly higher outdoor air concentrations CPF and AZM than non-proximal households. Indoor air concentrations were significantly reduced compared to outdoors, and farmworker households reported higher mean air concentrations of CPF than non-farmworker households. Very few samples detected oxygen analogs indoors. Indoor surface deposition (ng/m 2) and air concentration (ng/m 3) measurements were correlated. Higher proportions of oxygen analogs (2 - 35 %) were identified in air, particularly in samples further from potential sources of application and during times of increased cumulative solar radiation (mJ/m 2). This research highlights the ability of oxygen analogs ability to persist in air, resulting from atmospheric transport, photolysis, or reaction with oxidizing agents. Opportunity for exposure to oxygen analogs outdoors is a greater concern than indoor exposures. When considering cumulative and aggregate effects of exposure to OP pesticides in order to protect the unique health needs of children, the inclusion of oxygen analogs in risk assessments is necessary...|$|E

40|$|This paper reports an {{approach}} for estimating thinning-induced changes in N and P budgets in jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) {{forest in the}} Wungong catchment of Western Australia. Two thinning strategies, herbicide injection and selective removal, were tested and nutrient budgets were constructed for soil, litter and tree biomass. The effects of thinning were evaluated based on <b>pre-thinning</b> biomass allocation and on reductions in biomass after thinning. Tree above ground biomass was 399 ton ha(- 1), from which the selective logging removed 18. 7 ton ha(- 1) or 5 per cent of the N and 4 per cent of the P. Thinning residues from stem injection of herbicide contained fivefold more nutrients than the ground litter. Top soil was the primary nutrient store but only 1 - 2 per cent of total N and P were in available forms. In contrast, fine litter materials in thinned sites may release 4. 8 - 5. 7 kg P ha(- 1) via leaching over the rainy months. Cut branches and dead stems stored 176 kg N ha(- 1) and 7. 0 kg P ha(- 1) but would decompose over many decades.

We conducted a proof-of-concept study to explore the potential to achieve targeted plant populations consistently and to reduce variability in plant spacing by sowing additional seed and thinning emerged plants. In one onion crop, replicated plots were sown at half the standard within-row plant spacing (72 mm). Eight weeks after sowing, plant spacing was recorded in each plot, and then thinned using templates that identified plants to be removed based on spacing from the last retained plant (plant distance thinning), or at fixed distances {{from the start of}} the plot (fixed distance thinning). Plant-distance thinning treatments reduced within-row spacing variability (coefficient of variation (CV) 75 % <b>pre-thinning</b> to 34 % post-thinning). The mean spacing (74 mm) was similar to that of the control plots (73 mm; CV 61 %). Fixed-distance thinning treatments increased the mean and CV to 115 mm and 84 % respectively. A survey of six commercial onion fields showed that they varied significantly in within-row plant spacing variance (< 0. 001). Sowing more thickly, and then thinning small-seeded crops like onions shows promise in reducing plant spacing variability, extending the existing use of this approach from crops such as lettuce where automated thinning is being developed. The next consideration is measuring the impact of thinning treatments on yield and variability and considering automated methods for thinning of tightly spaced crops...|$|E
40|$|Forest canopy {{reduction}} {{is well known}} to affect the coarse and fine root biomass production. Seasonality, to the same extent, is acknowledged to vary the non-structural carbon content. However, the fine root response in terms of carbon concentration to both canopy cover and seasonal change remains unclear. To this aim, morphological and anatomical traits like xylem percentage, carbon concentration and starch content were measured in mid-summer and early-fall on fine roots of three beech stands differing in canopy cover and basal area. The results highlighted a significant effect of canopy cover on the xylem area percentage throughout the < 2 mm diameter fine root population, as the lower the canopy cover is, the larger the xylem area is. Moreover, an inverse relationship occurred between carbon concentration and xylem area percentage, highlighting the key role played by this anatomical trait. In order of magnitude, the significant carbon concentration decrease observed 5 years after felling was 15 kg ha 1 for a mean fine root biomass of 200 g m 2. For a given xylem percentage, starch concentration seasonal change partially explained the carbon concentration decrease with the incipient dormancy. Root tissue density significantly decreased with soil depth in mature and 15 -yr-old conversion stands, whereas it did not in recently cut (5 -yrold) conversion stand. Outcomes are that canopy closure in the mature stand, which increases the fine root standing crop, produced a higher total carbon input into the soil. Moreover, fifteen years since felling appeared sufficient for detecting a clear trend in the recovery of fine root biomass to <b>pre-thinning</b> levels...|$|E

This thesis discusses the integration of flexible single-crystal semiconductors with plastic substrates utilizing conductive intermediary adhesive materials.

40|$|White cypress pine Callitris glaucophylla is an {{important}} native tree widespread in heavily cleared savanna woodlands of the south-east Australian wheat-sheep belt. C. glaucophylla woodlands have {{been the focus of}} vigorous debate regarding their structure and dynamics during Aboriginal times and following European settlement, and the causes of structural changes are poorly understood. Management of contemporary woodland remnants is therefore controversial, and has so far lacked a predictive, process-based approach. We sought to determine whether a simple process model with recruitment, growth and survival mediated by rainfall and competition, could accurately simulate medium-term dynamics of C. glaucophylla woodlands in which fire has typically been excluded. Model parameters were optimised using reference data from 6 - to 36 -year silvicultural trials in central-western New South Wales (NSW). Predictions of the calibrated model compared favourably to actual growth, survival and recruitment of C. glaucophylla in the reference data, as well as in an independent dataset not used in optimisation. We tested whether remaining differences between predictions and actual data were related to variation in site productivity (a function of moisture availability as influenced by soil and landscape factors not modelled). Growth was overestimated in low-productivity sites and underestimated in high-productivity sites. Growth predictions were improved by using site-specific expected maximum heights to reflect site productivity. We also tested whether the model and parameter set produce dynamics consistent with those observed over the last half century. Modelled growth, survival, recruitment and competition processes were consistent with data and observations in previous studies on historical dynamics and stand behaviour of C. glaucophylla. The model has a wide range of potential applications for understanding past and predicting future stand dynamics. To illustrate an application of the model to thinning, a strategy currently being implemented to manage tree densities in inland NSW, we compared predicted stand structures in simulations of different thinning treatments. The simulations showed that without careful manipulation of existing canopy cover, stands can re-fill to <b>pre-thinning</b> densities within relatively short periods of time. 14 page(s...|$|E

A dual-probe nuclear densimeter {{was used to measure}} bulk density at four and eight inches. Slash depth after thinning and disturbance category were determined at bulk density measurement points in all units. Data were analyzed using paired t-tests, Tukey-Kramer multiple comparison tests, and multiple linear regression. Data were collected in two CTL units <b>pre-thinning</b> but one unit post-harvester and post-thinning (after both harvester and forwarder). During the sampling period thinning was completed only in the northeast corner of one unit (approximately 25 acres) before operations were ended due to concerns about soil moisture conditions and damage to hauling roads. Thus post-harvester and post-thinning data and conclusions apply only to that portion of the CTL units. In this harvested portion, slopes ranged from 0 - 10 percent and equipment traffic levels were estimated to range from three passes at the end of skid trails, to 30 passes on secondary trails and well over 40 passes on primary trails. These values are considered characteristic of most of Unit 82 except for areas near streams with steeper slopes. Plot centers were located using an incomplete, offset grid system. A sub-sample of bulk densities in old skid trails was also taken. The effects of harvester-only and the combined effect of harvester-forwarder traffic on the bulk density of old skid trails and previously undisturbed soils was assessed. In the three skyline units, bulk density was measured in the center, edge and halfway between skyline roads both before and after thinning. In addition, detailed maps of soil disturbance were created from transects located both directly on top of and halfway between a sub-sample of skyline roads within each unit. From the randomly located plots in the CTL units, it was determined that old skid trails covered approximately 27 and 13...|$|E
40|$|Rifting is {{the process}} {{that leads to the}} {{formation}} of oceans. Rifting is the break up of continents, leading to the formation of new oceanic floor between the two continental plates. Although the concept of continental rifting is accepted within the scientific community, it is still debated what controls the volume and composition of igneous material generated at these constructive plate boundaries. Here I present the results of dynamic modelling of rifted margins. I have explored the consequences of margin and mantle structure on the melt generated during continental extension and breakup. The central aim is to understand how melting affects the rifting of continents, especially in the North Atlantic. In order to understand the enigmatic melt production observed around the North Atlantic various tools are developed for interpreting the model output. These are predictions of primary major element composition of the melt, rare-earth element composition of the melt, predictions of the crystallised mid-oceanic ridge basalt composition and the seismic velocity of the lower crust. The thickness of the lithosphere has a very large impact on the subsequent rifting style. Extension of a 125 km thick thermally and rheologically defined lithosphere that has no prior thinning produces little melt during breakup. The Southeast Greenland margin rifted above a <b>pre-thinned</b> lithosphere and at initial fast half spreading rates. Further- more, to generate the thickness, chemistry and seismic velocities observed off this margin, rifting was coincident with the arrival of a 50 km thick, 200 ?C thermal anomaly. This thermal anomaly is not a plume, rather an exhaustible thermal layer that has drained along the sub-lithospheric topography from a distal plume. The melts generated are high in MgO, and depleted in TiO. They are depleted in rare-earth elements. This would lead to high seismic velocities within the underplate being, as observed off Southeast Greenland...|$|R
40|$|This {{has been}} a {{co-operative}} research project between the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, Division of Horticulture and Processing, DSIR, New Zealand Apple and Pear Marketing Board, The New Zealand Fruit growers Federation and the Department of Horticulture, Lincoln University commenced {{in the winter of}} 1986. The objective was to monitor 15 Royal Gala or Gala apple orchards in the three main apple producing regions of New Zealand to produce a data base for modelling biological and financial interactions. Selected trees were continuously monitored for three growing seasons. One orchard was continuously monitored for another 3 years (in the third additional year for the purpose of model validation). The orchards were 5 - 8 years old during the first monitoring season. Twelve of the orchards were on MM 106 rootstock and the remainder on M 793. Tree density ranged from 455 - 1102 /ha. Five trees were monitored for fruit number and fruit quality in each orchard at harvest. Three branches from each monitored tree were chosen to record the number of flowers and fruits before thinning and after thinning. To establish a fruit tree branch sampling system which can be reliably extrapolated to a whole tree basis, measurements from 204 trees, 151 parent branches and 9283 sub-branches were involved. Wood density was measured and the estimation of the volume of a branch, and the ratio of the branch to the whole tree, compared. Evidence is presented to show that the ratio of the sum of branch cross sectional area (CSA) to the trunk CSA is equal to the ratio of fruitfulness of the whole tree to fruitfulness of the sum of the branches. A relationship has been established between the sum of the CSA of branches directly arising from the central leader and the trunk CSA of central leader-trained apple trees. Ratios of 1. 6 - 2. 1 : 1 have been determined over 7 years of research without any major influence from pruning. The relationship of secondary branching of individual fruiting arms was investigated also, suggesting a similar relationship between branch CSA and secondary branch CSA but the influence from pruning, in this case, is relatively greater. Between orchard, tree and branch variation is explained. Recommendations on branch sampling for research and monitoring purposes are provided, based on these findings. Climatic data from 7 meterological stations was used, incorporating temperature, sunshine hours and rainfall. For each season the orchards were monitored, climatic data was recorded for the period October in the previous growing season until harvest time (March) of the current season, a total of 18 months in each case. Correlation calculations were attempted for all monthly combinations. Contour maps of correlation coefficients between tree parameters and monthly combinations of climatic data are presented to show the major effects of climate on fruit production. The production of multiple regressions has been focused on a range of tree parameters, with relevant climatic data from the contour maps added, to refine the mathematical relationships. Higher maximum temperatures in the period of March and April produced higher initial fruit set (r = 0. 54 **) the following spring suggesting an effect on quality of the flower. Lower maximum temperatures in the late dormant period (August to September) produced a higher initial fruit set (r = - 0. 40 **) as well. The natural simple regression between initial fruit set and flower number per cross sectional area (CSA) gives an r value of - 0. 47 ** indicating that the more flowers on a tree the lower the percentage initial fruit set. Introduction of the climatic effects produces a refined multiple regression with an r value at 0. 76 **. A negative correlation for estimating fruit number/ha after thinning was determined (r = - 0. 78 **). The estimation of fruit volume from fruit diameter was explored. Fruit growth curves based on fruit diameter or volume were plotted for 2 growing seasons. The influence of temperature on fruit growth is documented. Fruit size variation was explored and the sampling size for estimating average fruit weight is recommended. It is demonstrated how fruit number after thinning can be extrapolated to estimate total yield, fruit size and size distribution at harvest. Average fruit size was positively correlated with November to February temperatures in the previous season and also maximum temperatures in the December to January period prior to harvest. A negative correlation with fruit size was found for minimum temperatures in May. All these improved knowledge on the relationship between average fruit size and fruit number after thinning, but the maximum temperatures in December and January were critical in providing more accurate information (r = 0. 81 **) for harvest predictions. For management planning it is necessary to relate yield, fruit quality and size distribution, revenue and cost data, in order to calculate annual gross margins. A set of dynamic mathematical models developed are presented, to demonstrate the interrelationship of factors influencing apple production and profitability. Based on the model, a computer program was produced for practical orchard application. At the blossom and <b>pre-thinning</b> stages of fruit production, model users may specify parameters recorded from their own trees (eg flower numbers) and climatic data to predict tree behaviour for the next stage. At the post-thinning stage, model users may again specify parameters recorded from their own trees (eg fruit number) and climatic data to predict yield and fruit size distribution at harvest. These predictions can be correlated with financial data such as price realisations for the fruit and production and harvesting costs, to minimise estimated net return. The models allow annual climatic data to be balanced against biological parameters (eg fruit number) in order to minimise costs and maximise gross income and annual gross margins. For example, the required fruit number per tree after thinning can be correlated with the size grade distribution which will maximise returns, incorporating weather, cost and other key management parameters. Carbohydrate reserves in the dormant period are of primary importance for fruit production in the following year. The storage of starch in different parts or organs of apple trees was compared. The concentration of starch in the root system is much higher than that in the above ground parts. Observations of root growth and photos provided the evidence that roots continued to grow in the dormant period in Canterbury. Non-structural young rootlets contained almost no starch. For secondary roots, on average, thin roots contained higher concentrations of starch than thicker roots. However, results indicated there is greater variation of starch concentration in thinner roots. Results also showed that the starch content in root bark is much higher than that in root wood. The sampling variation may be reduced when bark and wood are separately tested. This is because the ratio of bark to wood is different for different roots. To minimize the variation, the bark of roots above 1 cm in diameter is recommended for analysis. Under 3 different crop loads, starch content was measured using replicates of 6 roots per tree and 3 trees per treatment. Starch content under light crop load conditions was significantly higher than that of middle and high crop loads, indicating a negative correlation with crop load in the growing season. A negative relationship between the content of starch and soluble sugar was found, reflecting the vigour of root growth. For the following year's production, higher yield or fruit number was positively correlated with the stored starch level or negatively correlated with the yield or fruit number in the previous growing season. An accurate method of estimation of fruit size distribution using average fruit weight and standard deviation of the mean is discussed...|$|E
