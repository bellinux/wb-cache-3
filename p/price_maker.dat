50|$|A {{monopoly}} is a <b>price</b> <b>maker</b> in {{that its}} choice of output level affects the price paid by consumers. Consequently, a monopoly tends to price {{at a point}} where price is greater than long-run average costs. X-inefficiency, however tends to increase average costs causing further divergence from the economically efficient outcome. The sources of X-inefficiency have been ascribed to things such as overinvestment and empire building by managers, lack of motivation stemming from a lack of competition, and pressure by labor unions to pay above-market wages.|$|E

Price controls as a strategy provide relief from the price exploitation of the dominant player in a market transaction, albeit a short term abatement of this power which is a common criticism of this method.|$|E

His name never showed up in any ownership documents. The Austrian government has not charged him with anything. One reason may well be that, in many instances, it is believed, that parties involved in international deals pay Saxena simply to have him on side. Saxena is not averse to shorting stocks. According to one of India's biggest power brokers, Chandraswami (also Nemi Chand Jain), Saxena is not averse to greenmail-type attacks on deals in progress, and due to his extensive knowledge of the markets (financial, economic and political), his reach is daunting, but his name is not on the paperwork.

50|$|Market {{power is}} the ability to {{increase}} the product's price above marginal cost without losing all customers. Perfectly competitive (PC) companies have zero market power when it comes to setting prices. All companies of a PC market are price takers. The price is set by the interaction of demand and supply at the market or aggregate level. Individual companies simply take the price determined by the market and produce that quantity of output that maximizes the company's profits. If a PC company attempted to increase prices above the market level all its customers would abandon the company and purchase at the market price from other companies. A monopoly has considerable although not unlimited market power. A monopoly has the power to set prices or quantities although not both. A monopoly is a <b>price</b> <b>maker.</b> The monopoly is the market and prices are set by the monopolist based on their circumstances and not the interaction of demand and supply. The two primary factors determining monopoly market power are the company's demand curve and its cost structure.|$|E
50|$|The {{objectives}} of UC {{depend on the}} aims of the actor for which it is solved. For a MO, this is basically to minimize energy production costs while satisfying the demand; reliability and emissions are usually treated as constraints. In a free-market regime, the aim is rather to maximize energy production profits, i.e., the difference between revenues (due to selling energy) and costs (due to producing it). If the GenCo is a <b>price</b> <b>maker,</b> i.e., it has sufficient size to influence market prices, it may in principle perform strategic bidding in order to improve its profits. This means bidding its production at high cost so as to raise market prices, losing market share but retaining some because, essentially, there is not enough generation capacity. For some regions {{this may be due to}} the fact that there is not enough grid network capacity to import energy from nearby regions with available generation capacity. While the electrical markets are highly regulated in order to, among other things, rule out such behavior, large producers can still benefit from simultaneously optimizing the bids of all their units to take into account their combined effect on market prices. On the contrary, price takers can simply optimize each generator independently, as, not having a significant impact on prices, the corresponding decisions are not correlated.|$|E
50|$|A {{firm with}} market power {{has the ability}} to {{individually}} affect either the total quantity or the prevailing price in the market. <b>Price</b> <b>makers</b> face a downward-sloping demand curve, such that price increases lead to a lower quantity demanded. The decrease in supply {{as a result of the}} exercise of market power creates an economic deadweight loss which is often viewed as socially undesirable. As a result, many countries have anti-trust or other legislation intended to limit the ability of firms to accrue market power. Such legislation often regulates mergers and sometimes introduces a judicial power to compel divestiture.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Time-shiftable loads play an {{important}} role in creat-ing load flexibility and enhancing demand response and peak-load shaving programs. However, recent studies have suggested that time-shiftable loads may face load synchronization and market instability if they are deployed at high penetrations such that they become <b>price</b> <b>maker.</b> To tackle this problem, in this paper, we propose a new demand bidding framework that recognizes the special characteristics of time-shiftable loads. The bids in this new bidding framework are called extended-time demand bids. They are either extended-time self-schedule bids or extended-time economic bids. The bidding concept, its visualization, and its mathematical representation are presented. Using the bids data in the California energy market, we show that the new bidding structure is beneficial not only to the power system as a whole but also to the consumers that are capable of shifting a portion of their loads. The new bidding structure also increases the market competitiveness due to expanding the competition domain and increasing demand elasticity with temporal dependencies...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} technology adoption {{problems in}} a simple general equilibrium framework, characterized {{by the presence of}} a firm and a number of self-employed consumer. It is shown that the choice of technologies may be hindered, or even blocked when the firm is <b>price</b> <b>maker</b> on the labor market and price taker on the goods market. Two sources of externality are likely to determine inefficient technology choices and thus inefficiencies of market allocations. First, the firm's technology choice generates a positive externality on the production function of self employed workers. Second, this positive externality induces an increase in labor costs, hence implying a negative pecuniary externality on the firm. Pareto efficient allocations that would be generated by a social planner internalizing all sources of externalities are discussed, and different mechanisms of policy intervention in order to overcome (or mitigate) market failure are studied, ranging from non linear (first best) subsidization to Pigouvian (second best) subsidies/taxes on labor input and technology adoption...|$|E
40|$|Generation company (Genco) bidding in an {{electricity}} market (EM) aims {{to maximize}} its profit under uncertain market characteristics and a regulated bidding mechanism. This paper addresses the strategic bidding {{for a large}} <b>price</b> <b>maker</b> Genco and empirically investigates {{the effect of a}} step-wise multiple segment bidding mechanism and EM characteristics, such as demand and rivals' behavior, on its market power (MP) potential and efficiency. The methodology of using novel hybrid differential evolution with biogeography-based optimization (DE/BBO), employing the sinusoidal migration model, is proposed for strategic bidding. DE exploration with BBO exploitation enhances global optimization. Uncertain rival behavior is modeled as normal distribution and simulated by the Monte Carlo technique. The proposed approach is validated for large Genco bidding in spot EM, under changing market characteristics and bidding segments. The implicit MP potential and efficiency of Genco for corresponding strategies is assessed using the criteria of expected profit, risk of profit variance, and failure rate of Genco. This assessment discovers an underlying correlation between the market characteristics and bidding segments, which would aid Genco in optimizing its bidding strategy and market performance...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} {{emergence}} of strategic behavior in double auctions with an equal number n of buyers and sellers, under the distinct assumptions that orders are cleared simultaneously or asynchronously. The evolution of strategic behavior is modeled as a learning process driven by a genetic algorithm. We find that, as the size n of the market grows, allocative inefficiency tends to zero and performance converges to the competitive outcome, regardless of the order-clearing rule. The main result concerns the evolution of strategic behavior. Under simultaneous order-clearing, as n increases, only marginal traders learn to be price takers and make offers equal to their valuations/costs. Under asynchronous order-clearing, as n increases, all intramarginal traders learn to be <b>price</b> <b>makers</b> and make offers equal to the competitive equilibrium price. The nature of the order-clearing rule affects in a fundamental way what kind of strategic behavior we should expect to emerge.

40|$|Starting {{from the}} theory of {{portfolio}} selection under Cumulative Prospect Theory (CPT) in a one period model, we firstly present some remarks connected with the violation of the so-called loss aversion {{in the case of}} power utility functions. The main contribution of this paper comes from the analysis of two equilibrium models. In the first one, an Expected Utility (EU) maximizer, a CPT agent and an accommodating market maker are allowed to interact. We show that there can be equilibria with null, positive or total risky investment by the CPT trader. Our results are then compared to an analogous model with two EU maximizers. On the contrary, the second financial market is populated by a sufficiently large number of EU agents and CPT agents, each of them being <b>price</b> <b>maker</b> and endowed with possibly heterogeneous preferences, these two facts being new to the literature. This time EU traders fully invest in stocks whereas CPT traders stay out of the risky market. For both models, equilibrium existence and robustness is shown using analytical and numerical methods.

In particular, it is proposed to re-examine Mundell's conclusions about monetary and fiscal policy under fixed and flexible exchange rates and to show that, under flexible exchange rates, an optimum policy combination exists that eliminates the trade-off between inflation and unemployment. As is common in these stabilization policy models, growth in factor supplies, and therefore output, is assumed not to exist. ...|$|R
