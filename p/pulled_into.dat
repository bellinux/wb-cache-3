5|$|According to the game's back-story, Necrid {{was once}} a human warrior. He sought and found the cursed sword Soul Edge, only to be <b>pulled</b> <b>into</b> the {{dimension}} that the sword's spirit inhabits. Escaping the dimension with his body drastically mutated, his memories and sanity initially lost, he now wields various forms of energy as weapons, while searching for fragments of the shattered Soul Edge that soothe the pain caused by his separation from the dimension's energies.|$|E
5|$|Depending {{upon his}} choice, the player {{character}} must assault or defend three key positions around the City of Judgment. After the battle, the player learns where his own soul is located and wrests {{it from the}} Wall of the Faithless. The player is then <b>pulled</b> <b>into</b> a dreamscape where he must battle Akachi's avatar, The Faceless Man, for control of his soul. After defeating the Faceless Man, Kelemvor narrates the ending, which varies based on the player's choices throughout the game.|$|E

5|$|The COS hinders {{the agents}} {{as they make}} their way inside. When it shuts down the building's power, Scully climbs through the air vents and is almost <b>pulled</b> <b>into</b> a giant fan, but manages to destroy it. Meanwhile, Mulder is {{permitted}} into the COS' control room by Peterson. However, Peterson reveals himself as a mole for the Defense Department and tries to stop Mulder uploading the virus. Scully arrives and holds Peterson at gunpoint, allowing Mulder to upload the virus and destroy the COS.|$|E
5|$|The {{steamship}} Celtic <b>pulled</b> <b>into</b> New York Harbor on September 23, carrying Kalākaua, Judd, Macfarlane, and von Oelhoffen. Awaiting them on {{the dock}} were Armstrong, Hawaiian consul general Elisha Hunt Allen, Jr. and Claus Spreckels. New York was in mourning over the September 19 death of President Garfield. Out of respect to the solemnity of the tragedy, Kalākaua attended no public or private functions in the city. The royal party did, however, spend a day as private tourists at Coney Island.|$|E

5|$|Actinides {{are typical}} metals. All {{of them are}} soft and have a silvery color (but tarnish in air), {{relatively}} high density and plasticity. Some {{of them can be}} cut with a knife. Their electrical resistivity varies between 15 and 150 µOhm·cm. The hardness of thorium {{is similar to that of}} soft steel, so heated pure thorium can be rolled in sheets and <b>pulled</b> <b>into</b> wire. Thorium is nearly half as dense as uranium and plutonium, but is harder than either of them. All actinides are radioactive, paramagnetic, and, with the exception of actinium, have several crystalline phases: plutonium has seven, and uranium, neptunium and californium three. The crystal structures of protactinium, uranium, neptunium and plutonium do not have clear analogs among the lanthanides and are more similar to those of the 3d-transition metals.|$|E
5|$|After {{they started}} to break apart, further orders were placed for {{additional}} suits and all the suits used eventually fell apart during the four days they were used on set. In order to film one scene, McChesney wore the suit open-backed due to the damage. No optical effects were used in creating Armus. For the scene where Riker is <b>pulled</b> <b>into</b> the oil, a stuntman {{was used as a}} stand in for Jonathan Frakes. Where Riker's face emerges from the oil, it was actually a plaster cast of Frakes' face painted black. It was placed on the same grate used to lift McChesney, and filmed lifting out of the liquid. The twitching effect in Yar's death was due to a wire tied around Crosby's waist being pulled on.|$|E
5|$|Amy is a 12-year-old, pink-furred {{anthropomorphic}} hedgehog girl {{created by}} Kenji Terada for the Sonic the Hedgehog manga series. She debuted in 1992, wearing a dress {{and with her}} then-orange hair <b>pulled</b> <b>into</b> 2 ponytails. The character was redesigned the next year for the Sega CD game, Sonic CD. Like the Sonic CD introduction Metal Sonic, an early grayscale concept sketch shows her very similar to her appearance in the game (except her shoes, which became larger and flatter). Her coloring was red at first (including her skirt), except for a green shirt. The character had two other names in game previews: Rosy the Rascal and Princess Sally (a character in the Sonic the Hedgehog TV series). Amy received her present design, with a red dress and boots, in Sonic Adventure.|$|E

5|$|As {{introduced}} in Soulcalibur II, Necrid is a warrior who fought and defeated a former wielder of the cursed sword Soul Edge, and was <b>pulled</b> <b>into</b> the dimension where the sword's spirit, Inferno, inhabited. Instead of battling Inferno, he fled, and became {{trapped in the}} dimension for years. Warped physically and mentally by the dimension as a result, he escaped during the closing events of Soulcalibur, but quickly found that, without the dimension's energies, he experienced intense pain and would eventually die. Attacking travelers he perceived as enemies, he happened upon a fragment of Soul Edge and felt his pain dampened. Pursuing other fragments of the sword, he encountered Talim, who was also seeking them, and helped defeat the resurrected Inferno. His memories and sanity restored by the battle, Necrid closed {{the entrance to the}} void, trapping himself within.|$|E
5|$|In June 1916, the {{battalion}} departed from Alexandria {{to join the}} British Expeditionary Force in France for service on the Western Front; they arrived at Marseilles on 23 June. The 30th Battalion's first major action began with {{the outbreak of the}} Battle of Fromelles on 19 July 1916. The unit was originally designated with providing carrying parties for supplies and ammunition during the battle, but was subsequently <b>pulled</b> <b>into</b> the fighting. Wark commanded a company during the action, until being evacuated to the 7thStationary Hospital with a gunshot wound to his leg. He was transferred to the 3rdLondon General Hospital in England three days later, and moved again to the 5thAustralian Auxiliary Hospital, Digswell House, Welwyn, on 7 August. Recovered by September, Wark was discharged and granted leave before returning to France and the 30th Battalion later that month.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter has a faint {{planetary}} ring system composed of three main segments: an inner torus of particles {{known as the}} halo, a relatively bright main ring, and an outer gossamer ring. These rings appear {{to be made of}} dust, rather than ice as with Saturn's rings. The main ring is probably made of material ejected from the satellites Adrastea and Metis. Material that would normally fall back to the moon is <b>pulled</b> <b>into</b> Jupiter because of its strong gravitational influence. The orbit of the material veers towards Jupiter and new material is added by additional impacts. In a similar way, the moons Thebe and Amalthea probably produce the two distinct components of the dusty gossamer ring. There is also evidence of a rocky ring strung along Amalthea's orbit which may consist of collisional debris from that moon.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile Captain Archer, {{accompanied}} by Lieutenant Reed, Ensign Sato, {{and a team}} of MACOs, enters the vortex created by the Xindi weapon. During the pursuit, a recovering Sato is pushed by Archer to decipher Degra's schematics. Again Archer is suddenly <b>pulled</b> <b>into</b> the future by Temporal Agent Daniels, this time to the founding of the United Federation of Planets, but Archer is again uninterested. Arriving near Earth, Archer receives an unexpected transmission from Commander Shran, who engages and then destroys the Reptilian ship. In the chaos, Archer and his team are able to beam aboard the weapon. A fierce fire-fight ensues, and as Archer and Sato try to disable the weapon, Commander Dolim attempts to stop them. He fails and the weapon is destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Michael Schumacher {{maintained}} his start line advantage and withstood Häkkinen's attempts to pass him {{going into the}} first corner. Further around the lap, a collision involving four cars prompted the deployment of the safety car and a fire marshal Paolo Gislimberti {{was struck by a}} flying wheel. When the safety car <b>pulled</b> <b>into</b> the pit lane on lap eleven, Michael Schumacher began to immediately pull clear from Häkkinen and kept the lead until his pit stop on the 39th lap. When Häkkinen made his own pit stop three laps later, Michael Schumacher regained the lead which he held to clinch his sixth victory of the 2000 season; Häkkinen finished almost four seconds behind.|$|E
5|$|The 2006–07 season saw Nolan {{take over}} from the {{departed}} Jay-Jay Okocha as club captain. His three league goals helped Bolton to again qualify for the UEFA Cup. Nolan's long throw-in set up a goal, which helped Bolton achieve a 2–2 draw away against German champions Bayern Munich, who dominated the match. Despite reaching the first knockout round, Bolton's league form suffered as they were <b>pulled</b> <b>into</b> a relegation fight, eventually finishing the season one point above the relegation zone in 16th. Nolan scored in the 2–0 win over Sunderland in May that virtually secured the club's Premier League status.|$|E

5|$|The race began {{behind the}} safety car but was stopped after three laps {{because of a}} large amount of {{standing}} water on the circuit. After a 45-minute delay, the race was restarted and the safety car <b>pulled</b> <b>into</b> the pit lane after thirteen laps. Pole sitter Sebastian Vettel maintained his lead going into the first corner. A second safety car deployment caused by the collision of Mark Webber and Nico Rosberg on lap nineteen closed up the field but Vettel retained the lead. Alonso maintained second position until a botched pit stop during a third safety-car period caused him to drop to third. At the restart on lap thirty-five, Hamilton ran wide at the first corner, allowing Alonso back into second place. Vettel's engine failed eleven laps later, allowing Alonso to move into the lead, which he maintained to win the race.|$|E
5|$|The race saw two drivers {{out before}} the start lights even went out, as first Sebastian Vettel stopped on track during the warm-up lap with an engine failure before Jolyon Palmer <b>pulled</b> <b>into</b> the pit lane instead of lining up on the grid, {{suffering}} from a hydraulic failure. It {{was the first time}} in Vettel's career that he was unable to start a race. At the start, Rosberg <b>pulled</b> <b>into</b> the lead ahead of Hamilton, who came into contact with Valtteri Bottas and dropped back to ninth place. Both Bottas and Ricciardo damaged their front wings in the situation. Felipe Massa took advantage and moved into second behind Rosberg. Further back, Sergio Pérez and Carlos Sainz also made contact, leaving Sainz with a puncture and Pérez with front wing damaged and both had to pit for repairs. Daniil Kvyat and Nico Hülkenberg were two more victims of contact during the first lap. The order after five laps was Rosberg, Massa, Bottas, Ricciardo and Räikkönen, who took fourth a lap later. The same lap, Jenson Button retired with a failure of his energy recovery system. After yet another lap, Räikkönen moved ahead of Bottas as well into third. Hamilton recovered from his first-turn accident and soon moved ahead of Bottas as well, laying in fourth place on lap eight. On lap ten, Bottas received a drive-through penalty for his collision with Hamilton at the start. By lap eleven, Esteban Gutiérrez retired with brake failure, while his teammate Grosjean was in fourth place.|$|E
5|$|Then {{the girl}} was <b>pulled</b> <b>into</b> the tent and the men started to beat on the shields so her screams could not be heard. Six men entered the tent to have {{intercourse}} with the girl, after which they forced her onto her master's bed. Two men grabbed her hands, and two men her wrists. The angel of death put a rope {{around her neck and}} while two men pulled the rope, the old woman stabbed the girl between her ribs with a knife. Thereafter, the relatives of the dead chieftain arrived with a burning torch and set the ship aflame. It is said that the fire facilitates the voyage to the realm of the dead.|$|E
