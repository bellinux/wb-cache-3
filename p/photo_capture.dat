In a first-of-its-kind study, we use context-aware camerephone devices to examine privacy decisions in mobile and online photo sharing. Through data analysis on a corpus of privacy decisions and associated context data from a real-world system, we identify relationships between location of <b>photo</b> <b>capture</b> and photo privacy settings. Our data analysis leads to further questions which we investigate through a set of interviews with 15 users. The interviews reveal common themes in privacy considerations: security, social disclosure, identity and convenience. Finally, we highlight several implications and opportunities for design of media sharing applications, including using past privacy patterns to prevent oversights and errors.

In our Mobile Media Metadata 2 (MMM 2) prototype, we apply collaborative filtering techniques to automatically gathered contextual metadata to infer the likely sharing recipients for photos captured on cameraphones. We show that while current cameraphone sharing interfaces are fraught with difficulty, it is possible to use a context-aware approach to make the sharing of cameraphone photos simpler and more satisfying for users. Based on our analysis of the relative contributions of different cameraphone sensors to predicting the likely recipients for photos, we discover for our user population that the temporal context of <b>photo</b> <b>capture</b> proved highly predictive of photo sharing behavior...|$|E

In this paper, we employ an iterative <b>photo</b> <b>capture</b> by robots (by repositioning itself) to capture good quality photographs. Our image quality assessment approach {{is based on}} few high level features of the image combined {{with some of the}} aesthetic guidelines of professional photography. Our system can also be used in web image search applications to rank images. We test our quality assessment approach on a large and diversified dataset and our system is able to achieve a classification accuracy of 79 %. We assess the aesthetic error in the captured image and estimate the change required in orientation of the robot to retake an aesthetically better photograph. Our experiments are conducted on NAO robot with no stereo vision. The results demonstrate that our system can be used to capture professional photographs which are in accord with the human professional photography. ...|$|E

In Flickr, annotation (as textual tags) serves {{both personal and}} social purposes, increasing incentives for tagging and resulting in a relatively high number of annotations. ZoneTag, in turn, {{makes it easier to}} tag cameraphone photos that are uploaded to Flickr by allowing annotation and suggesting relevant tags immediately after capture. A qualitative study of ZoneTag/Flickr users exposed various tagging patterns and emerging motivations for photo annotation. We offer a taxonomy of motivations for annotation in this system along two dimensions (sociality and function), and explore the various factors that people consider when tagging their photos. Our findings suggest implications for the design of digital photo organization and sharing applications, as well as other applications that incorporate user-based annotation...|$|E
