The aim of this work was to evaluate the parameters of radiotherapy simulators affecting the precision of simulation. Material and methodsA test protocol has been prepared based on appropriate IEC norms and the methodology used by service engineers, as well as on previous work undertaken at the Medical Physics Department. Two radiotherapy simulators (Varian Ximatron and Oldelft Simulix) have been regularly tested for a period of over one year. ResultsTests have shown that on both simulators, <b>precision</b> of <b>laser</b> centrators (light beams indicating the isocenter), field size and telemeter (light scale indicating the source-to-skin distance) varies over time, which in some situations could lead to significant inaccuracies in simulations. Inaccuracies observed during the tests were, in most cases, not noticed by the operators. Usually, appropriate adjustments can only be made by service engineers.
