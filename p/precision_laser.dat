The aim of this work was to evaluate the parameters of radiotherapy simulators affecting the precision of simulation.

Two radiotherapy simulators (Varian Ximatron and Oldelft Simulix) have been regularly tested for a period of over one year. ResultsTests have shown that on both simulators, <b>precision</b> of <b>laser</b> centrators (light beams indicating the isocenter), field size and telemeter (light scale indicating the source-to-skin distance) varies over time, which in some situations could lead to significant inaccuracies in simulations.
