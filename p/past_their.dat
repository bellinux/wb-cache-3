In North Carolina and Virginia, Irene produced heavy rainfall of over 10inches (255mm), adding more flooding after previous Hurricanes Dennis and Floyd. The flooding closed many roads, and caused rivers to crest <b>past</b> <b>their</b> banks, though damage in the area was relatively minor.|$|E

The country's {{participation}} in Rio de Janeiro marked its twelfth {{appearance at the}} Summer Olympics since its debut in 1964. The delegation included two track and field athletes: Bachir Mahamat in the men's 400 metres and Bibiro Ali Taher in the women's 5000 metres. Both athletes participated at the Games through wild card places since they {{did not meet the}} required standards to qualify. Neither athletes progressed <b>past</b> <b>their</b> heats.|$|E

5|$|Machinery {{problems}} {{were likely to}} delay the ships well <b>past</b> <b>their</b> intended delivery dates of 1943–44. The Kharkhovskii Turbogenerator Works never completed a single turbine before the German invasion in June 1941. Another problem were the 305mm guns and turrets as the armament factories were focused on the higher-priority guns for the Sovetsky Soyuz-class battleships. Prototypes of neither had been completed {{by the time the}} Germans invaded. The situation was not much better for the smaller guns as mountings for both the 152mm and 100mm guns were still incomplete on 22 June 1941 and all of these programs were terminated quickly afterwards.|$|E

Three turbines were delivered by Brown Boveri in 1939 to Arkhangelsk for the Sovetskaya Rossiya, but the Kharkhovskii Turbogenerator Works never completed a single turbine before the German invasion in June 1941. A prototype boiler {{was supposed to have}} been built ashore for evaluation, but it was not completed until early 1941, which further complicated the production plan.|$|E

The last captive birth for these species in North America was in 2001 in San Diego.

On August 27, he reached Kariopoli {{in an attempt to}} take a safe path through the mountains. Before he reached the town of Polytsaravos, his army of 8,000 Egyptians was delayed by Theodoros Stathakos and his family of thirteen men who refused to let the invaders <b>past</b> <b>their</b> tower. Bosinas tried to negotiate with Stathakos. Stathakos, feigning surrender, told Bosinas to come and take his family's guns. As Bosinas came to retrieve the guns, the Stathakos family killed him. In retaliation, the Egyptians used their two cannons and blew up the tower.|$|E
5|$|Banks {{fitted in}} well at Stoke, as Waddington built {{a team of}} veteran players who were judged {{by some to be}} <b>past</b> <b>their</b> best.

Banks remained a reliable stopper for the club, though on 1 March 1969 he was knocked unconscious at Roker Park by Sunderland's Malcolm Moore, and his replacement David Herd conceded four goals in a 4–1 defeat. Banks also played a season for the Cleveland Stokers of the American United Soccer Association in the summer of 1968: he played seven of the short-lived club's 12 games in Cleveland, Ohio.|$|E

5|$|In {{its early}} {{developmental}} stages {{north of the}} Greater Antilles, the storm caused minor damage to shipping in The Bahamas and generated rough seas offshore Cuba. At its first landfall on Fort Pierce, the hurricane caused extensive property damage, particularly in coastal regions, where numerous homes were unroofed. Central Florida's citrus crop was hampered by the strong winds and heavy rain. Several of Florida's lakes, including Lake Okeechobee, rose <b>past</b> <b>their</b> banks, inundating coastal areas. Damage to infrastructure was less in inland regions than at the coast, though power outages caused loss of communication statewide. At the hurricane's second landfall, wind damage was relatively minor, though torrential rainfall, aided by orthographic lift, caused extensive flooding {{as far north as}} the Mid-Atlantic states. Overall, the hurricane caused $235,000in damages, primarily in Florida, and two deaths.|$|E
5|$|Over Georgia, {{the storm}} dropped heavy {{rainfall}} of 10inches (255mm) in 24hours in various locations. The deluge caused rivers to crest <b>past</b> <b>their</b> banks, including the Oconee River at Milledgeville which peaked at 33.7feet (10.3m). The rainfall, which was heaviest across the southwestern {{portion of the}} state, washed out several bridges and roads, and flooded many other roads. Georgia governor Roy Barnes {{declared a state of}} emergency for seven counties in the state. The storm also spawned two tornadoes. In South Carolina, Allison's outer bands produced 10tornadoes and several funnel clouds, though most only caused minor damage limited to a damaged courthouse, snapped trees and downed power lines. Allison produced from 12 to 16inches (305 to 406mm) of rainfall in North Carolina, closing nearly all roads in Martin County and damaging 25homes. The severe flooding washed out a bridge in eastern Halifax County and flooded numerous cars. Wet roads caused nine traffic accidents throughout the state.|$|E
5|$|Populations of slow loris species, {{such as the}} Bengal and Sunda slow loris, are not faring well in zoos. In 2011, the International Species Information System (ISIS) {{had only}} 11 and 53specimens (respectively) on file from {{reporting}} zoos worldwide. In North American zoos, for instance, several of the 29captive specimens in 2008 were hybrids that could not breed while most were <b>past</b> <b>their</b> reproductive years, and the last captive birth was in 2001 at the San Diego Zoo. Only three Javan slow lorises were kept in zoos in 2011 according to ISIS. Pygmy slow lorises are doing better, with 100specimens reported from zoos worldwide in 2011. In North American zoos, for instance, the population has grown to 74animals between {{the time they were}} imported in the late 1980s and 2008, with most of them born at the San Diego Zoo.|$|E

5|$|Returning to Canada, Roberts {{signed a}} three-year {{contract}} with the Toronto Maple Leafs worth $8 million. He chose his hometown Maple Leafs because he felt they had a better opportunity to win the Stanley Cup than Carolina did. He recorded 53 points in 2000–01 and his 29 goals led the team. A 48-point season followed in 2001–02 and he assumed leadership of the Maple Leafs during the 2002 Stanley Cup Playoffs after team captain Mats Sundin suffered a season-ending injury. Roberts led Toronto <b>past</b> <b>their</b> first round opponent, the New York Islanders, in an occasionally violent seven game series. The Maple Leafs reached the Eastern Conference final, where they ultimately lost to Carolina. Roberts led Toronto in playoff scoring with 19 points in 19 games.|$|E
5|$|The Horns took {{possession}} of the ball to start the game and used {{less than two minutes}} in scoring on a 25-yard carry by Jamaal Charles. Rice advanced to the Texas43-yard line before punting the ball to Texas' one-yard line, forcing the Longhorns to start from inside their own end zone. UT drove the ball 99yards in sevenplays for a secondtouchdown. With fourseconds left in the first quarter, Vince Young threw a pass that was intercepted by Ja'Corey Shepherd at the UT20-yard line. Rice lost yardage on their possession and failed to convert on fourth down so they turned the ball over on downs. The rest of the first-half scoring was dominated by the Longhorns as they scored four more touchdowns to take a 42–0 lead. The Owls had four–more possessions in the second–quarter but never advanced the ball <b>past</b> <b>their</b> own 30-yard line.|$|E
5|$|With the Alabama {{starters}} in {{the game}} for the first possession of the second half, the defense again held the Tigers to a three-and-out and forced a punt.

The Alabama defense then did not allow Auburn to get <b>past</b> <b>their</b> own 41-yard line {{for the duration of}} the game and secured their fourth shutout of the season. The victory was the second largest in the history of the Iron Bowl after the 55–0 Alabama win in 1948 and improved Alabama's all-time record against the Tigers to 42–34–1.|$|E
