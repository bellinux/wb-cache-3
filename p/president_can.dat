5|$|Constitutional {{questions}} {{may also be}} referred to the Tribunal when Parliament attempts to circumvent or curtail the discretionary powers conferred on the President by the Constitution. If the attempt is by way of an ordinary bill, the <b>President</b> <b>can</b> exercise personal discretion to withhold assent to it. It is then open to Cabinet to advise the President {{to refer to the}} Tribunal the question whether the bill in fact circumvents or curtails his discretionary powers. If the bill is determined by the Tribunal not to have that effect, the President is deemed to have assented to the bill on the day following the day when the Tribunal's opinion is pronounced in open court. When Article 5A of the Constitution is brought into force, a similar procedure will apply to attempts to circumvent or curtail the President's discretionary powers through a constitutional amendment. If the Tribunal rules that the proposed amendment does have the effect of restricting the discretionary powers of the President, the Prime Minister is entitled to submit the bill to a national referendum for approval.|$|E

40|$|Does the {{president}} {{have the ability to}} set the congressional agenda? Agenda setting is a prerequisite for influence, so this is an important element in understanding presidentialâ€“legislative relations. We focus on the State of the Union address and show that popular <b>presidents</b> <b>can,</b> indeed, cause Congress to shift attention to those topics most emphasized. The impact is tempered by divided government and time, however. No matter the state of divided government, however, popular <b>presidents</b> <b>can</b> direct congressional attention, at least for a little while. Unpopular presidents, by contrast, are irrelevant...|$|R
