Elements commonly associated with the sulfidic phase, Cd, Cu, Pb, Zn and Fe exhibited the most significant changes under the BCR sequential extraction procedure. Cd, Cu, Zn, {{and to a lesser}} extent Pb, were redistributed into the weak acid extractable fraction upon oxidation of the anoxic sediment and Fe was redistributed into the reducible fraction as expected, but an increase was also observed in the residual Fe. For the HCl <b>partial</b> <b>extraction,</b> sediments with moderate acid volatile sulfide (AVS) levels (1 – 100 μmol g− 1) showed no significant difference in element partitioning following oxidation, whilst sediments containing high AVS levels (> 100 μmol g− 1) were significantly different with elevated concentrations of Cu and Sn noted in the partial extract following oxidation of the sediment. Comparison of the labile metals released using the BCR sequential extraction procedure (ΣSteps 1 – 3) to labile metals extracted using the dilute HCl <b>partial</b> <b>extraction</b> showed that no method was consistently more aggressive than the other, with the HCl <b>partial</b> <b>extraction</b> extracting more Sn and Sb from the anoxic sediment than the BCR procedure, whilst the BCR procedure extracted more Cr, Co, Cu and As than the HCl extraction...|$|E

Several types of geochemical technique, including weak acid <b>partial</b> <b>extraction,</b> strong acid extractions and total digestion have been used. Attempts have been made to overcome the influence that grainsize has on chemical concentrations in heterogeneous environments by analysing the fines, typically the mud fraction (< 63 μm), in an attempt to improve the detection of anthropogenic contamination. Here we compare a weak acid <b>partial</b> <b>extraction</b> using 1 M HCl and total digestion methods for a regional survey of reference and impacted sites in Antarctica using both whole sediment (< 2 mm) and mud (< 63 μm) fractions.

Sediment quality assessment is therefore an important consideration in ensuring the ecological sustainability of coastal regions. An important research focus associated with sediment quality assessment is determining whether sediments enriched with trace metals actually exert an adverse effect on aquatic ecosystems (Ankley et al., 1994). This issue is complicated because trace metal bioavailability in sediments is controlled by sorption to several solid-phases (such as iron oxyhydroxides, organic matter and reactive sulfide species; Chapman et al., 1998). Furthermore, total metal analysis often provides a poor indication of bioavailability and potential mobility (ANZECC/ARMCANZ, 2000).

Some of the setbacks to successful geochemical exploration may be ascribed {{to the use of}} various <b>partial</b> <b>extraction</b> techniques,without a profound understanding of the regolith components and their composition. This investigation therefore focuses on the use of hydroxylamine <b>partial</b> <b>extraction</b> geochemistry for geochemical mapping in regolith over two contrasting environments viz; aeolian sand-calcrete regolith over Au mineralization at Amalia Blue Dot Mine in South Africa and lateritic regolith covering the Ni-Cu deposit at Kabanga Main and Luhuma in Tanzania. Regolith samples from the above areas were sieved and extracted with hydroxylamine hydrochloride solution and analyzed for multi-element by AAS and ICP-MS techniques. A stepwise optimization of the hydroxylamine extraction technique of samples from both areas was carried out and incorporated into the analytical programme (in a pilot study). Results of hydroxylamine <b>partial</b> <b>extraction</b> generally gave better anomaly contrast and reflection of bedrock mineralization than the conventional aqua regia techniques that were previously used in the region. The results however show that lateritic regolith may be best extracted using 0. 25 M hydroxylamine while 0. 1 M concentration appears most suitable for extraction of aeolian-calcrete regolith. The above results are corroborated by principal component analysis of the analytical data that show various element associations, e. g. with Fe-Mn oxides while others possibly belong to the loosely adsorbed or exchangeable group. The gochemical maps in the pilot study areas at Amalia, Kabanga and Luhuma show elevated element contents or clusters of anomalies of diverse elements associated with Fe-Mn oxides. Geochemical mapping at Kabanga with deeply concealed mineralization however shows variability of subdued element patterns over mineralized areas. Geochemical signatures associated with hydroxylamine hydrochloride partial leach are therefore characterized by a lower geochemical background than that using conventional aqua regia leach.

Ca 2 + sensitivity of tension, the steepness of the force-pCa relationship, and Ca 2 + dependence of ktr were measured in skinned fibers that were (1) treated with NEM-S 1, a strong-binding, non–force-generating derivative of myosin subfragment 1, to promote cooperative strong binding of endogenous cross-bridges to actin; (2) subjected to <b>partial</b> <b>extraction</b> of TnC to disrupt the spread of activation along the thin filament; or (3) both, <b>partial</b> <b>extraction</b> of TnC and treatment with NEM-S 1. The steepness of the force-pCa relationship was consistently reduced by treatment with NEM-S 1, by <b>partial</b> <b>extraction</b> of TnC, or {{by a combination of}} TnC extraction and NEM-S 1, indicating a decrease in the apparent cooperativity of activation. <b>Partial</b> <b>extraction</b> of TnC or NEM-S 1 treatment accelerated the rate of force redevelopment at each submaximal force, but had no effect on kinetics of force development in maximally activated preparations.

NEM-S 1 also accelerated ktr at intermediate levels of activation, but to values that were submaximal. However, the combination of partial TnC extraction and 6 μM NEM-S 1 increased ktr to virtually identical supramaximal values at all levels of activation, thus, completely eliminating the activation dependence of ktr.

At this initial stage of the project the main objectives were: (1) to identify associations between chemical elements; (2) to estimate spatial patterns of variation for such associations in the surficial materials. The associations were established using principal component analysis (PCA). Variography was used to obtain the theoretical model of spatial continuity of each variable. These models were used in the interpolation method (kriging) selected to estimate surficial dispersion patterns. The results of PCA and PCA mapping indicate distinct distribution patterns for the metals related to the primary mineralogical or geochemical association, as identified for this deposit. Based on the results, six of the 53 chemical elements studied were selected to estimate spatial patterns of dispersion in the topsoil.

Interpretation of <b>partial</b> <b>extraction</b> data is, however, subject to uncertainty because the effects of changing soil or sediment properties on extraction are poorly defined.

This indicates that the severe periodontitis patients were specifically unresponsive to solubilized dental plaque prior to therapy. The mechanism of the unresponsiveness is not clear, but probably does not involve serum factors because supplementation of the lymphocyte cultures with pooled homologous plasma from individuals with gingivitis or moderate periodontitis (instead of the patient's autologous plasma) did not significantly change the mean lymphocyte responses to solubilized dental plaque. In addition, lymphocytes from eleven long-term (5 [...] 18 yr) edentulous subjects, who were free of oral inflammation, were significantly transformed by solubilized dental plaque. The latter lymphocyte responses and those of the treated periodontitis patients could be due either to the presence of low levels of oral bacteria in the edentulous mouth or to the lymphocyte transformation assay being a measure of previous antigen sensitization rather than current disease status. In either case, lymphocyte transformation to solubilized dental plaque is not a useful diagnostic tool in periodontitis, but should continue to be a valuable research tool for investigating pathological mechanisms in periodontitis...|$|R
40|$|The Upper Allochthonous Thrust Complex (UATC) of the Braganca massif in {{northern}} Portugal contains {{a set of}} ultrabasic rocks interthrust with granulites. The ultrabasic rocks have refractory silicate mineral and whole rock compositions which indicate an origin as depleted mantle.
