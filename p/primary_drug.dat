25|$|Little {{attention}} {{has focused on}} the degree that benzodiazepines are abused as a <b>primary</b> <b>drug</b> of choice, but they are frequently abused alongside other drugs of abuse, especially alcohol, stimulants and opiates. The benzodiazepine most commonly abused can vary from country to country and depends on factors including local popularity as well as which benzodiazepines are available. Nitrazepam for example is commonly abused in Nepal and the United Kingdom, whereas in the United States of America where nitrazepam is not available on prescription other benzodiazepines are more commonly abused. In the United Kingdom and Australia there have been epidemics of temazepam abuse. Particular problems with abuse of temazepam are often related to gel capsules being melted and injected and drug-related deaths. Injecting most benzodiazepines is dangerous because of their relative insolubility in water (with the exception of midazolam), leading to potentially serious adverse health consequences for users.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background After rapid {{scaling up}} of {{antiretroviral}} therapy in HIV- 1 -infected patients, {{the data of}} <b>primary</b> HIV- 1 <b>drug</b> resistance in Thailand is still limited. This study aims to determine the prevalence and associated factors of <b>primary</b> HIV- 1 <b>drug</b> resistance in Thailand. Methods A prospective observational study was conducted among antiretroviral-naïve HIV- 1 -infected Thai patients from 2007 to 2010. HIV- 1 subtypes and mutations were assayed by sequencing a region of HIV- 1 pol gene. Surveillance drug resistance mutations recommended by the World Health Organization for surveillance of transmitted HIV- 1 drug resistance in 2009 were used in all analyses. <b>Primary</b> HIV- 1 <b>drug</b> resistance {{was defined as the}} presence of one or more surveillance drug resistance mutations. Results Of 466 patients {{with a mean age of}} 38. 8 years, 58. 6 % were males. Risks of HIV- 1 infection included heterosexual (77. 7 %), homosexual (16. 7 %), and intravenous drug use (5. 6 %). Median (IQR) CD 4 cell count and HIV- 1 RNA were 176 (42 - 317) cells/mm 3 and 68, 600 (19, 515 - 220, 330) copies/mL, respectively. HIV- 1 subtypes were CRF 01 _AE (86. 9 %), B (8. 6) and other recombinants (4. 5 %). The prevalence of <b>primary</b> HIV- 1 <b>drug</b> resistance was 4. 9 %; most of these (73. 9 %) had surveillance drug resistance mutations to only one class of antiretroviral drugs. The prevalence of patients with NRTI, NNRTI, and PI surveillance drug resistance mutations was 1. 9 %, 2. 8 % and 1. 7 %, respectively. From logistic regression analysis, there was no factor significantly associated with <b>primary</b> HIV- 1 <b>drug</b> resistance. There was a trend toward higher prevalence in females [odds ratio 2. 18; 95 % confidence interval 0. 896 - 5. 304; p = 0. 086]. Conclusions There is a significant emergence of <b>primary</b> HIV- 1 <b>drug</b> resistance in Thailand after rapid scaling up of antiretroviral therapy. Although HIV- 1 genotyping prior to antiretroviral therapy initiation is not routinely recommended in Thailand, our results raise concerns about the risk of early treatment failure in patients with <b>primary</b> HIV- 1 <b>drug</b> resistance. Interventions to prevent the transmission of HIV- 1 drug resistance and continuation of surveillance for <b>primary</b> HIV- 1 <b>drug</b> resistance in Thailand are indicated. </p...|$|R

To prevent these undesirable side effects, hydralazine is usually prescribed in combination with a β-blocker (e.g., propranolol) and a diuretic.
