5|$|She went on {{to appear}} in <b>Peter</b> <b>Pan,</b> a 1951 Broadway revival adapted from the 1904 J.M. Barrie play. She starred {{in the title role}} in a touring company {{production}} in 1951, succeeding Jean Arthur. The play was not a musical, and was different from the subsequent version starring Mary Martin a few years later, but had five songs by Leonard Bernstein. Captain Hook was played by Boris Karloff. Her performance in <b>Peter</b> <b>Pan</b> was praised by critics, and it was her favorite acting role.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{entered into the}} 2001 Cannes Film Festival, {{and was the first}} {{animated}} film since Disney's <b>Peter</b> <b>Pan</b> (1953) to receive that honour.|$|E
5|$|After {{the release}} {{and success of}} the movie, Walt Disney Pictures has {{announced}} the development of several live-action adaptations of their Animated Classics series. Maleficent, Cinderella, The Jungle Book and Beauty and the Beast have followed to similar box-office results with the latter three also earning critical praise. Disney has also announced the development of live-action adaptations of Christopher Robin, Dumbo, Aladdin, The Lion King, Mulan, Pinocchio, Fantasia, The Sword in the Stone, The Black Cauldron, <b>Peter</b> <b>Pan,</b> The Little Mermaid, and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. The company also has plans for live-action spin-offs of <b>Peter</b> <b>Pan,</b> One Hundred and One Dalmatians and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs along with a live-action prequel to Aladdin.|$|E

5|$|In July 2012, Rowling was {{featured}} at the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony in London where she {{read a few}} lines from J. M.

An inflatable representation of Lord Voldemort and other children's literary characters accompanied her reading.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{fed by the}} River Westbourne and Tyburn Brook in the 1730s, the lake's {{water was}} then pumped from the Thames in the 1830s. The water is now pumped from three {{boreholes}} within Hyde Park, the most recent being installed in May 2012 {{as part of the}} 2011–2012 restoration of the Lake. The Serpentine provided a focal point for The Great Exhibition of 1851, and more recently was a venue for the men's and women's triathlon and marathon swimming events in the London 2012 Olympics. Since 1864 the Serpentine Swimming Club has organised a 100-yard race every Christmas morning. In 1913, the <b>Peter</b> <b>Pan</b> Cup was inaugurated for this race by J. M. Barrie, the creator of the fictional character <b>Peter</b> <b>Pan.</b>|$|E
5|$|Wong {{continued}} to be offered exotic supporting roles, playing indigenous native girls in two 1924 films. Filmed on location in the Territory of Alaska she portrayed an Eskimo in The Alaskan. She returned to Los Angeles to perform the part of Princess Tiger Lily in <b>Peter</b> <b>Pan.</b> Both films were shot by cinematographer James Wong Howe but <b>Peter</b> <b>Pan</b> was more successful; the hit of the Christmas season. The next year, Wong was singled out for critical praise in a manipulative Oriental vamp role in the film Forty Winks. Despite such favorable reviews, she became increasingly disappointed with her casting and began to seek other roads to success. In early 1925 she joined a group of serial stars {{on a tour of}} the vaudeville circuits; when the tour proved to be a failure, Wong and the rest of the group returned to Hollywood.|$|E
5|$|Greyhound Bus Lines offers limited {{intercity}} service from {{a stop on}} Water Street. Current service consists of two daily buses in each direction operating along the I-95 corridor, with transfers available to other routes in Boston, New Haven, and New York City. Greyhound and <b>Peter</b> <b>Pan</b> Bus (which no longer serves New London) previously used the former baggage and express office.|$|E
5|$|Since 1864, the Serpentine {{has hosted}} a 100-yard (91.4m) {{swimming}} competition every Christmas morning at 9am. In 1904, author J. M. Barrie awarded the <b>Peter</b> <b>Pan</b> Cup {{to the winner}} of the race, a tradition which has continued ever since. Owing to the hazards of swimming in freezing water, the race is open only to members of the Serpentine Swimming Club.|$|E
5|$|Snow White's success led to Disney {{moving ahead}} with more feature-film productions. Walt Disney used {{much of the}} profits from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs to finance a new $4.5 million studio in Burbank– the {{location}} on which The Walt Disney Studios is located to this day. Within two years, the studio completed Pinocchio and Fantasia and had begun production on features such as Dumbo, Bambi, Alice in Wonderland and <b>Peter</b> <b>Pan.</b>|$|E
5|$|Traditional Victorian dancing fairies and elves {{appear in}} much of Tolkien's early poetry, and have {{influence}} upon his later works {{in part due to}} the influence of a production of J. M. Barrie's <b>Peter</b> <b>Pan</b> in Birmingham in 1910 and his familiarity with the work of Catholic mystic poet, Francis Thompson which Tolkien had acquired in 1914.|$|E
5|$|A {{rectangular}} swimming area on {{the southern}} bank was opened in 1930. Known as Lansbury's Lido, it is partitioned {{off from the rest}} of the lake by a perimeter of buoys. There is a fee for entering the lido, and changing rooms are available. It is normally open only in the summer, typically between 10:00 and 17:30, although members of the Serpentine Swimming Club may swim all the year round from 06:00 to 09:30. The <b>Peter</b> <b>Pan</b> Christmas Day Race is only open to regular participants in the Saturday swimming competitions during the winter.|$|E
5|$|Bowring Park, {{located in}} the Waterford Valley, {{is one of the}} most scenic parks in St. John's. Entrance to the park is via Waterford Bridge Road, passing a {{sculptured}} duck pond and a statue of <b>Peter</b> <b>Pan.</b> The park land was donated to the city in 1911 by Sir Edgar Rennie Bowring on behalf of Bowring Brothers Ltd. on their 100th anniversary of commerce in Newfoundland. The park was officially opened by His Royal Highness, the Duke of Connaught on 15 July 1914.|$|E
5|$|In December 2011, Ice played Captain Hook in the Chatham, Kent Central Theatre {{pantomime}} {{production of}} <b>Peter</b> <b>Pan,</b> {{a role that}} previously belonged to Henry Winkler. He also turned on the Christmas lights for Rochester, Kent in Rochester Castle, {{as part of the}} promotion for the panto. On May 12, 2012, Vanilla Ice helped in the launch of the Mr. Freeze Reverse Blast roller coaster at Six Flags over Texas in Arlington with a free concert for valid daily park ticket or 2012 Season Pass holders. In mid 2013, Vanilla Ice joined the New Kids on the Block tour alongside Boyz II Men.|$|E
5|$|McKellen {{attended}} Bolton School (Boys' Division), {{of which}} he is still a supporter, attending regularly to talk to pupils. McKellen's acting career started at Bolton Little Theatre, {{of which he}} is now the patron. An early fascination with the theatre was encouraged by his parents, who took him on a family outing to <b>Peter</b> <b>Pan</b> at the Opera House in Manchester when he was three. When he was nine, his main Christmas present was a wood and bakelite, fold-away Victorian theatre from Pollocks Toy Theatres, with cardboard scenery and wires to push on the cut-outs of Cinderella and of Laurence Olivier's Hamlet.|$|E
5|$|Most of the Disney {{features}} {{from the}} 1990s had been spun off into direct-to-video sequels, television series, or both, {{produced by the}} Disney Television Animation unit. Beginning with the February 2002 release of Return to Never Land, a sequel to <b>Peter</b> <b>Pan</b> (1953), Disney began releasing lower-budgeted sequels to earlier films, which had been intended for video premieres, in theaters, a process derided {{by some of the}} Disney animation staff and fans of the Disney films.|$|E
5|$|Smith {{became a}} {{professional}} actress in 1982 {{after graduating from}} drama school. After appearances {{in a number of}} school plays, she joined the local Arena Stage theater group on an apprenticeship, featuring in their production of <b>Peter</b> <b>Pan.</b> She went on to star in several other plays in Washington. She moved to New York City in 1984 and appeared in the Broadway production of Tom Stoppard's play The Real Thing alongside Jeremy Irons and Glenn Close.|$|E
5|$|Alice in Wonderland, {{released}} in 1951, {{met with a}} lukewarm response {{at the box office}} and was a sharp critical disappointment in its initial release. <b>Peter</b> <b>Pan,</b> {{released in}} 1953, was, on the other hand, a commercial success and the highest-grossing film of the year. In 1955, Lady and the Tramp was released to higher box office success than any other Disney feature from the studio since Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, earning an estimated $7.5 million in rentals at the North American box office in 1955. Lady is significant as Disney's first widescreen animated feature, produced in the CinemaScope process, and was the first Disney animated feature to be released by Disney's own distribution company, Buena Vista Distribution.|$|E
5|$|As a game {{meant to}} explore the fictional universes of various Disney films, over one hundred Disney {{characters}} are featured in various capacities. While many serve as major characters in the story, others appear in cameo roles, such as the One Hundred and One Dalmatians playing a part in a side-quest. Most worlds also feature a Disney villain whom the player must defeat. The player can summon various Disney characters to fight alongside Sora in battle, causing Donald and Goofy {{to withdraw from the}} battlefield {{for the duration of the}} summon. Available summoned characters include the Genie from Aladdin, Tinker Bell from <b>Peter</b> <b>Pan,</b> and Simba from The Lion King, among others.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{favorable}} {{reviews of}} her performances in The Big Knife and <b>Peter</b> <b>Pan,</b> her worsening {{health and the}} failure of her most recent Broadway plays took a toll on her career. As her health declined, she found that her dancing ability was affected. She suffered a severe heart attack in 1955, followed by a possible second attack, and then developed pneumonia which required an extended stay in the hospital. She hid the severity of her health problems, but some details became public. Upon release from the hospital, McCracken was told by her doctors that she could no longer dance. The news was devastating to her.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} two years Richardson {{appeared}} in six plays in London ranging from <b>Peter</b> <b>Pan</b> (as Mr Darling and Captain Hook) to Cornelius, an allegorical play written for and dedicated to him by JBPriestley. Cornelius ran for two months; this was less than expected, and left Richardson with a gap in engagements {{in the second half of}} 1935. He filled it by accepting an invitation from Katharine Cornell and Guthrie McClintic to play Mercutio in their production of Romeo and Juliet on a US tour and on Broadway. Romeo was played by Maurice Evans and Juliet by Cornell. Richardson's performance greatly impressed American critics, and Cornell invited him to return to New York to co-star with her in Macbeth and Antony and Cleopatra, though nothing came of this.|$|E
5|$|RKO {{has long}} been celebrated for its series of musicals {{starring}} Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers in the mid-to-late 1930s. Actors Katharine Hepburn and, later, Robert Mitchum had their first major successes at the studio. Cary Grant was a mainstay for years. The work of producer Val Lewton's low-budget horror unit and RKO's many ventures into the field now known as film noir have been acclaimed, largely after the fact, by film critics and historians. The studio produced {{two of the most}} famous films in motion picture history: King Kong and Citizen Kane. RKO was also known for being the distributor to a significant portion of Walt Disney's animated feature films, from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs in 1937 to <b>Peter</b> <b>Pan</b> in 1953.|$|E
5|$|According to {{an insert}} in the Lady and the Tramp Diamond Edition release case, Aladdin {{was going to}} be {{released}} on Blu-ray Disc as a Diamond Edition in Spring 2013. Instead, <b>Peter</b> <b>Pan</b> was released on Blu-ray as a Diamond Edition on February 5, 2013 to celebrate its 60th anniversary. A non-Diamond Edition Blu-ray was released in a few select European countries in March 2013. The Belgian edition (released without advertisements, commercials or any kind of fanfare) comes as a 1-disc version with its extras ported over from the Platinum Edition DVD. The same disc was released in the United Kingdom on April 14, 2013. Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released the film on a Diamond Edition Blu-ray on October 13, 2015. The film was released on Digital HD on September 29, 2015. Upon its first week of release on home media in the U.S., the film topped the Blu-ray Disc sales chart and debuted at number 2 at the Nielsen VideoScan First Alert chart, which tracks overall disc sales behind the disaster film San Andreas.|$|E
5|$|American Pharoah's {{connections}} {{drew the}} number five post {{position for the}} Belmont on June 3. Pundits immediately noted {{it was the same}} slot from which Seattle Slew had won the 1977 Belmont and the Triple Crown, and that 14 other Belmont winners had started from the position. American Pharoah was the 3–5 morning line favorite in an eight-horse field that included Tale of Verve, as well as five rivals from the Kentucky Derby who had skipped the Preakness, and one horse, Madefromlucky, who had not run either of the previous Triple Crown races, but, like Tonalist the year prior, had instead won the <b>Peter</b> <b>Pan</b> Stakes at Belmont Park. American Pharoah had previously defeated every horse entered, but he was also the only horse to contest all three legs of the Triple Crown and had run four races in the preceding eight weeks.|$|E
5|$|In early 1950, Disney {{produced}} Cinderella, his studio's first animated {{feature in}} eight years. It was popular with critics and theater audiences. Costing $2.2million to produce, it earned nearly $8million {{in its first}} year. Disney was less involved {{than he had been}} with previous pictures because of his involvement in his first entirely live-action feature, Treasure Island (1950), which was shot in Britain, as was The Story of Robin Hood and His Merrie Men (1952). Other all-live-action features followed, many of which had patriotic themes. He continued to produce full-length animated features too, including Alice in Wonderland (1951) and <b>Peter</b> <b>Pan</b> (1953). From the early to mid-1950s, Disney began to devote less attention to the animation department, entrusting most of its operations to his key animators, the Nine Old Men, although he was always present at story meetings. Instead, he started concentrating on other ventures.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy Plaza, in {{downtown}} Providence, {{serves as a}} transportation hub for local public transit {{as well as a}} departure point for <b>Peter</b> <b>Pan</b> and Greyhound bus lines. Public transit is managed by Rhode Island Public Transit Authority (RIPTA). Through RIPTA alone Kennedy Plaza serves over 71,000 people a day. The majority of the area covered by RIPTA is served by traditional buses. Of particular note is the East Side Trolley Tunnel running under College Hill, the use of which is reserved for RIPTA buses. RIPTA also operates the Providence LINK, a system of tourist trolleys {{in downtown}} Providence. From 2000 to 2008, RIPTA operated a seasonal ferry to Newport between May and October. In 2016 SeaStreak began operating the Providence – Newport ferry route. RIPTA began a rapid bus service called the R Line in June 2014.|$|E
5|$|Production of {{full-length}} animated features {{was temporarily}} suspended {{after the release}} of Bambi. Given the financial failures of some of the recent features and World War II cutting off much of the overseas cinema market, the studio's financiers at the Bank of America would only loan the studio working capital if it temporarily restricted itself to shorts production. Then in-production features such as <b>Peter</b> <b>Pan,</b> Alice in Wonderland, and Lady and the Tramp were therefore put on hold until after the war. Other issues affecting the studio at the time included the drafting of several Disney animators to fight in World War II, and the necessity for the studio to focus on producing wartime content for the U.S. Army, particularly military training, and civilian propaganda films. From 1942 to 1943, 95 percent of the studio's animation output was for the military. During the war, Disney produced the live-action/animated military propaganda feature Victory Through Air Power (1943), and a series of Latin culture-themed shorts resulting from the 1941 Good Neighbor trip were compiled into two features, Saludos Amigos (1942) and The Three Caballeros (1944).|$|E
5|$|The {{company also}} began a close working {{relationship}} with Ida Lupino of Four Star International. She starred in two suspense films with Robert Ryan—Nicholas Ray's On Dangerous Ground (1952, though shooting had been completed two years earlier) and Beware, My Lovely (1952), a coproduction between RKO and Lupino's company, The Filmakers. Of more historic note, Lupino was Hollywood's only female director during the period; of the five pictures The Filmakers made with RKO, Lupino directed three, including her now celebrated The Hitch-Hiker (1953). Exposing many moviegoers to Asian cinema for the first time, RKO distributed Akira Kurosawa's epochal Rashomon in the United States, sixteen months after its original 1950 Japanese release. The only smash hits released by RKO in the 1950s came out during this period, but neither was an in-house production: Goldwyn's Hans Christian Andersen (1952) was followed by Disney's <b>Peter</b> <b>Pan</b> (1953).|$|E
5|$|Birth by Sleep is a prequel to {{the first}} Kingdom Hearts game, taking place ten years prior. Like the other games in the series, the player {{progresses}} through a collection of various worlds, based on various locales from the Disney animated features canon: Dwarf Woodlands from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Enchanted Dominion from Sleeping Beauty, Castle of Dreams from Cinderella, Olympus Coliseum from Hercules, Deep Space from Lilo & Stitch, Neverland from <b>Peter</b> <b>Pan</b> and Mysterious Tower from Fantasia. The game also features various new worlds specially created for the series by Square Enix such as the Land of Departure and Radiant Garden. Disney Town, which is the town that surrounds the castle grounds of Disney Castle, serves as the game's minigame world. Worlds such as Destiny Islands and Castle Oblivion also appear {{in the form of}} cutscenes, while the 100 Acre Wood from the Winnie the Pooh franchise, which had appeared in most other games of the series, only appears as a Command Board in Birth by Sleep. The staff first chose the worlds based on the game's scenario, leading to the inclusion of Princesses' worlds. They then added the worlds of Neverland and Deep Space to add variety to the game, while Olympus Coliseum was selected to reflect the game's earlier setting compared to the original Kingdom Hearts.|$|E
