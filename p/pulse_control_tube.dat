40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the electrical properties of a commonly used stress <b>control</b> <b>tube</b> for medium voltage heat-shrink joints using non-destructive methods in laboratory. The electrical {{properties of the}} tube were determined by use of dielectric spectroscopy while changing the temperature, AC electric field and humidity level. In order to characterize the material, both differential scanning calorimetry and water uptake measurements was performed on samples of stress <b>control</b> <b>tube.</b> Two similar test objects were used {{in order to obtain}} a higher electric field strength at the same applied AC voltage. A Raychem stress <b>control</b> <b>tube</b> was shrunk on the outside of a cylindrical shape consisting of two metal electrodes and a PTFE rod separating them. The length of the PTFE rod was 100 mm for Object L, while only 20 mm for Object S providing a higher field strength. Water uptake measurement was performed {{in order to determine the}} stress <b>control</b> <b>tube</b> s ability to diffuse water. Measurement results imply that the water uptake is dependent of both the degree of shrinkage and the temperature. The highest water content is observed for a virgin stress <b>control</b> <b>tube</b> kept at 90 ℃, with a concentration of 8 % after 105 days. None on the test samples reached saturation during the experimental work. Differential scanning calorimetry measurement was performed in order to examine if the stress <b>control</b> <b>tube</b> had any phase transitions changing the electrical properties of the stress <b>control</b> <b>tube.</b> Samples of stress <b>control</b> <b>tube</b> were examined in the temperature range of 20 ℃ to 200 ℃. Results indicate that the stress <b>control</b> <b>tube,</b> independent of the degree of shrinkage, has an endothermic melting transition in the temperature range of 94 ℃ to 114 ℃. Dielectric response measurements show that the thermal transition of the stress <b>control</b> <b>tube</b> will provide an increased conductivity. This is likely caused by a change from semi-crystalline to amorphous state, releasing trapped charge carriers and providing the material to become more electrical conductive. Dielectric spectroscopy was performed on both test objects in the electric field range from 0. 025 1. 0 kVpeak/mm for Object S and 0. 005 0. 01 kVpeak/mm for Object L. Frequency was varied from 100 Hz to 1 mHz. A temperature dependence was observed for dielectric loss tangent, in addition to large values up to 1000. At higher temperatures, the dielectric loss tangent was observed independent of the electric field. For measurements at 40 ℃, an electric field dependence is observed for field strengths above 0. 5 kVpeak/mm. The results show that the conductivity is dependent of the temperature. After exposed to 150 ℃, the temperature is decreased to 40 ℃ and a new measurement is performed. Hysteresis effect is then observed as the conductivity attains a higher value than before exposed to high temperatures. The conductivity is found independent at the electrical field at high temperatures. At low temperatures, the electrical field dependence is observed for field strengths above 0. 5 kVpeak/mm. Observations made imply that the conductivity is strongly dependent of the humidity level. When performing dielectric response measurement on a wet test object, the conductivity experienced a significant increase from 10 - 11 to 10 - 5 S/m. Wet stress <b>control</b> <b>tube</b> was dissected after complete dielectric response measurement.

40|$|Optimization {{of water}} use in {{agriculture}} and quantification of percolation from landfills and watersheds require reliable estimates of vadose-zone water fluxes. Current technology is limited primarily to lysimeters, which directly measure water flux but are expensive and may {{in some way}} disrupt flow, causing errors in the measured drainage. We report on design considerations and field tests of an alternative approach, passive-wick fluxmeters, which use a <b>control</b> <b>tube</b> to minimize convergent or divergent flow. Design calculations with a quasi-three-dimensional model illustrate how convergence and divergence can be minimized {{for a range of}} soil and climatic conditions under steady-state and transient fluxes using <b>control</b> <b>tubes</b> of varying heights. There exists a critical recharge rate for a given wick length, where the fluxmeter collection efficiency is 100 % regardless of height of the <b>control</b> <b>tube.</b> Otherwise, convergent or divergent flow will occur, especially when the <b>control</b> <b>tube</b> height is small. While divergence is eliminated in coarse soils using <b>control</b> <b>tubes,</b> it is reduced but not eliminated in finer soils, particularly for fluxes 60 % annual precipitation) from gravel surfaces and least (no drainage) from silt loam soils. In Oregon and New Mexico, USA, and in New Zealand, drainage showed substantial spatial variability. The New Mexico tests were located in semiarid canyon bottom terraces, with flash-flood prone locations having extremely high drainage/precipitation ratios. In the wettest environments, drainage was found to be closely linked to the rate and duration of precipitation events. JRC. H. 5 -Rural, water and ecosystem resource...|$|R

40|$|The {{electrical}} properties of a widely used stress <b>control</b> <b>tube</b> for medium voltage heat-shrink joints are {{examined in this}} master thesis by using non-destructive laboratory methods. They were determined by use of time domain dielectric response test while changing the DC electric field, temperature and level of humidity. In {{order to determine the}} physical and mechanical characteristics of the material at different aging stages and conditions, both differential scanning calorimetry and tensile test measurements were performed on stress <b>control</b> <b>tube</b> samples. Two types of test samples were prepared. For dielectric response tests, Raychem JSCR 42 / 16 stress <b>control</b> <b>tube</b> was shrunk on a cylindrical rod, consisting of two metal electrodes, separated by a PTFE (Teflon) insulating rod. For differential scanning calorimetry and tensile tests, the stress <b>control</b> <b>tube</b> was shrunk on a cylindrical PTFE rod only, with the same diameter as for the dielectric response tests without the presence of metal electrodes. Tensile test measurements were performed in order to characterize and compare the mechanical properties of the stress <b>control</b> <b>tube</b> material at different aging stages. Differential scanning calorimetry measurements were used to estimate aging degree by assessment of thermal resistivity of the material and antioxidants consumption when exposed to high temperatures for a certain period of time. To calculate the conductivity, dielectric response measurements were performed in time domain at different voltage levels up to 20 kV and charging and discharging time duration of 10800 s. They were conducted by placing the test object in a climate chamber in order to examine the influence of temperature and humidity. The measurements were performed on unaged and thermally aged heat shrinkable stress <b>control</b> <b>tubes.</b> The aging process was obtained in heat cabinets at 98 °C dry air, 98 °C wet air and 150 °C dry air conditions. Results from the analysis show that conductivity has not significant dependency of the electric field up to 0. 2 kV/mm at different temperatures, aging degree and humidity. It was revealed that conductivity is more temperature dependent, as a significant increase was observed when the temperature was elevated at higher values. Conductivity was found out to be strongly dependent on humidity, especially when combined with high aging degree. <br/...|$|R
