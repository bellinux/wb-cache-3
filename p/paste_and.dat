40|$|Abstract. Characterization of liquids, <b>pastes,</b> <b>and</b> melts is {{nowadays}} {{becoming increasingly}} important for industrial applications. The thermal conductivity of a heat-transfer paste is, for example, {{one of the}} crucial parameters {{for the application of}} the material, and characterization of polymers in the liquid range is important for the analysis and optimization of the production processes. A new container system has been developed allowing flash measurements to be carried out on liquids, <b>pastes,</b> <b>and</b> molten polymers. Technical details of the container and the data on processing techniques are presented. Reliability tests (on water) have also been carried out and the results are compared with literature values. Various application examples for liquids, <b>pastes,</b> <b>and</b> polymers, through the melt stage are reported. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{behaviour}} {{of different}} superplasticizers admixtures was assessed for hydrated lime <b>pastes</b> <b>and</b> mortars. Sometimes, air lime <b>pastes</b> <b>and</b> mortars were modified with two supplementary cementing materials (SCMs), namely nanosilica (NS) and metakaolin (MK). Two different polycarboxylate ethers, a lignosulfonate and a naphthalene condensed sulfonate superplasticizer {{were added to}} lime <b>pastes</b> <b>and</b> mortars and their effects on fresh-state properties {{as well as on}} the mechanical strengths were evaluated. A close relationship was found between the molecular architecture of the plasticizers and the flowability of the pastes. Zeta potential assessment allowed us to elucidate the main action mechanisms for these admixtures. In the case of polycarboxylate ethers, the large specific surface area of nanosilica led to a large SPs consumption as compared with metakaolin with lower surface area. However, polycarboxylate ethers in MK-lime samples were attached favourably to the C-S-H and aluminate hydrates, so that the dispersing action was greater with respect to NS-lime suspensions...|$|R
5|$|Molten salts will solidify on cooling {{to below}} their {{freezing}} point. This is sometimes {{used for the}} solid-state synthesis of complex ionic compounds from solid reactants, which are first melted together. In other cases, the solid reactants {{do not need to}} be melted, but instead can react through a solid-state reaction route. In this method the reactants are repeatedly finely ground into a <b>paste,</b> <b>and</b> then heated to a temperature where the ions in neighbouring reactants can diffuse together during the time the reactant mixture remains in the oven. Other synthetic routes use a solid precursor with the correct stoichiometric ratio of non-volatile ions, which is heated to drive off other species.|$|E
5|$|Since the Restoration, {{there have}} been many {{additions}} and alterations to the regalia. A new set of regalia was commissioned in 1685 for Mary of Modena, the first queen consort to be crowned since the Restoration, CharlesII having been unmarried when he took the throne. Another, more elaborate set had to be made four years later when MaryII was crowned as joint sovereign with her husband WilliamIII. After the Acts of Union 1707 joined England and Scotland together, the Scottish Crown Jewels were locked away in a chest, and the English Crown Jewels continued to be used by British monarchs. Starting with Queen Anne, gemstones were hired for coronations and replaced with <b>paste</b> <b>and</b> crystals for display in the Jewel House, a practice which continued until the early 20thcentury.|$|E
5|$|The {{site had}} a long and {{continuous}} settlement history, with the period of principal occupation stretching from the Middle Preclassic down to the Postclassic. The earliest known occupation at Takalik Abaj dates {{towards the end of}} the Early Preclassic, ca. 1000 BC. However, it was not until the Middle to Late Preclassic that its first real florescence began with a noted surge in architectural constructions. From this period onwards a continuity of culture and population settlement is in evidence, as represented by the persistence of a local ceramic style (called Ocosito) that remained in use until the Late Classic. The Ocosito style was typically made with red <b>paste</b> <b>and</b> pumice and extended westwards at least as far as Coatepeque, southwards to the Ocosito River and eastwards to the Samalá River. By the Terminal Classic, pottery associated with a highland K'iche' ceramic style had begun to appear intermixed with Ocosito ceramic complex deposits. Ocosito ceramics were replaced entirely by the K'iche' ceramic tradition by the Early Postclassic period.|$|E

5|$|Although it is {{recorded}} that the Han Dynasty (202 BC– AD 220) court eunuch Cai Lun (50 AD– AD 121) invented the pulp papermaking process and established {{the use of}} new materials used in making paper, ancient padding and wrapping paper artifacts dating to the 2nd century BC {{have been found in}} China, the oldest example of pulp papermaking being a map from Fangmatan, Tianshui; by the 3rd century, paper as a writing medium was in widespread use, replacing traditional but more expensive writing mediums such as strips of bamboo rolled into threaded scrolls, strips of silk, wet clay tablets hardened later in a furnace, and wooden tablets. The earliest known piece of paper with writing on it was discovered in the ruins of a Chinese watchtower at Tsakhortei, Alxa League, where Han Dynasty troops had deserted their position in AD 110 following a Xiongnu attack. In the paper making process established by Cai in 105, a boiled mixture of mulberry tree bark, hemp, old linens and fish nets created a pulp that was pounded into <b>paste</b> <b>and</b> stirred with water; a wooden frame sieve with a mat of sewn reeds was then dunked into the mixture, which was then shaken and then dried into sheets of paper that were bleached under the exposure of sunlight; K.S.

40|$|Components of starch {{granules}} {{were investigated}} {{to reveal the}} roles of components in the overall rheology of starch <b>pastes</b> <b>and</b> gels. In a reconstitution study, replacement of insoluble starch with soluble starch decreased the viscosity of <b>pastes</b> <b>and</b> reduced the stickiness of gels. Rice amylopectin fine structure was found to significantly correlate with paste breakdown. Proportion of long chains of amylopectin was negatively correlated and proportion of short chains positively correlated with paste breakdown. Influences of starch granule-bound starch synthase (GBSS) and other granule-associated proteins on rheological properties of starch <b>pastes</b> <b>and</b> gels were studied using a normal and three isogenic waxy (a waxy null and two GBSS-containing waxy mutants) maize starches. Starch granule-associated proteins, especially GBSS, reduced <b>paste</b> breakdown <b>and</b> viscosity of starch pastes. The viscoelasticity of <b>pastes</b> <b>and</b> gels was greatly reduced as more starch-granule-associated proteins were removed. Light microscopy of pastes suggested that starch granule-associated proteins influence the rheology of pastes through increasing the rigidity of gelatinized starch granules. The study indicated that starch granule-associated proteins, especially GBSS, can significantly change the rheological properties of starch <b>pastes</b> <b>and</b> gels despite its low concentration in starch pastes. Location of starch granule-associated proteins was revealed using a protein specific dye with confocal laser scanning microscopy. Starch granule-associated proteins {{were found to be}} concentrated in internal concentric rings in potato, maize, and wheat starches. Observation of granule proteins at different optical depths of field showed that proteins were distributed in discrete spheres. Amylose-free potato and waxy corn starch granules showed no internal protein spheres, indicating that the protein spheres are composed of GBSS and are likely associated with location of amylose. GBSS was also found to be strongly associated with isolated gelatinized granule remnants of normal potato, maize and wheat starches while virtually no protein was found in remnants of amylose-free potato and waxy maize starch. Starch granule-associated proteins, including GBSS, were found to be partially lost during alkaline extraction of rice starch. Variation in amount of loss in GBSS and other granule-associated proteins was found among different rice lines. Starch damage caused by ball milling was shown to reduce the viscosity and elastic nature of starch pastes. The study showed that soluble starch, amylopectin, and starch granule-associated proteins have their unique functions and contribute to the overall rheology of starch <b>pastes</b> <b>and</b> gels. Confocal microscopy of starch granule-associated proteins provided the structural/locational basis for the rheological function of GBSS in starch pastes. ...|$|R
