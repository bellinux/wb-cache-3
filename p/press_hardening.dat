40|$|<b>Press</b> <b>hardening</b> {{is widely}} {{utilized}} to form ultra-high-strength steels {{characterized by a}} high strength-to-weight ratio for automotive components. <b>Press</b> <b>hardening</b> processes include heating boron–manganese steels to austenite phase, forming the steels at a high temperature, and cooling the formed blanks until the martensite phase is reached. However, <b>press</b> <b>hardening</b> processes lead to severe contact conditions between the blank and the tools including contact pressure, relative sliding, and high temperatures, which result in tool wear and increased maintenance cost. The contact conditions {{that occur in the}} stamping tool are difficult to study on site. Additionally, simplified tests, such as pin on disc and ball on disc, are insufficient to reproduce <b>press</b> <b>hardening</b> conditions in laboratory environments. The aim of this study includes developing a tribological test with <b>press</b> <b>hardening</b> conditions in which tool steel pins continuously slide on fresh and hot boron–manganese steel strips. The test programme mimics <b>press</b> <b>hardening</b> conditions with respect to sliding distance, sliding velocity, contact pressure, and surface temperature that were studied based on finite element (FE) simulations of a <b>press</b> <b>hardening</b> experiment. Furthermore, a FE simulation of the tribological test is established and it provides contact temperature in the pin tip with a high accuracy. A tribological test is used to study friction and mass loss with variational pressures and velocities that represented typically variational contact conditions in the <b>press</b> <b>hardening.</b> The tribological test is also used to obtain correlations between the tribological behaviours and process parameters in <b>press</b> <b>hardening</b> including pressure and sliding velocity.

40|$|Implementation {{of press}} {{hardened}} parts in automobile {{responses to the}} requirement of reduced carbon dioxide emission because the press hardened part has very high ratio of strength to weight. Furthermore, ultra high-strength steels (press hardened parts) increases the vehicle safety. The <b>press</b> <b>hardening</b> processes are prevalently applied in global automotive industries. However, the <b>press</b> <b>hardening</b> processes corresponding to heating, forming, and cooling processes result in harsh contact conditions such as cyclic pressures, high temperatures and complex reactions between coatings and tool steels. Consequently, these harsh contact conditions increase the tool maintenance due to abrasive wear and adhesive wear. In order to study tribological behaviours in the <b>press</b> <b>hardening,</b> two kinds of the tribological experiments have been developed and used. Firstly, a reciprocating test, also called SRV test, is performed at elevated temperatures to study the wear mechanisms under <b>press</b> <b>hardening</b> conditions. However, {{the discrepancy between the}} <b>press</b> <b>hardening</b> and SRV test is obvious. To overcome the disadvantage, a sliding tribometer, also called tribolgoical test, is used as the second tribological test. A unidirectional sliding process is running under the corresponding pressures, temperatures, velocities and sliding distances. These test parameters are based on <b>press</b> <b>hardening</b> simulations. According to the present study, the abrasive wear is the predominant wear mechanism in the uncoated interface of the <b>press</b> <b>hardening</b> processes. When Al-Si coated workpieces are applied in the <b>press</b> <b>hardening,</b> severe adhesive wear, also called galling, substantially occurs in the stamping tool. The modelling of the abrasive and adhesive wear is derived from the Archard wear model in which the specific coefficients for the wear are calibrated by the tribological tests. The wear predictions implemented in the <b>press</b> <b>hardening</b> simulation have been validated by a <b>press</b> <b>hardening</b> experiment, which represents a typical geometry of vehicle components...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{conventional}} clinching of steels {{is currently}} limited to tensile strength less than 800 N/mm and to {{elongation at fracture}} more than 14 %. To realise the clinching of high-strength steels, the sheet can be heated locally at the joint, to improve ductility. Thereby the material characteristics outside the joint should be maintained. This could be achieved by means of short-time laser heating. The short-time tempering behaviour of <b>press</b> <b>hardened</b> steel 22 MnB 5 has been analysed. The mechanical properties during a short-time heat treatment were investigated by thermo-mechanical analysis in a deformation dilatometer.

40|$|AbstractUltrahigh {{strength}} steels like <b>press</b> <b>hardened</b> 22 MnB 5 and S 1100 QL {{make good}} construction materials, however when fusion welded they bring {{the disadvantage of}} softening in heat affected zones (HAZ). State of the art research of Laser welding ultrahigh strength steels shows that neither increasing the welding velocity, nor {{post weld heat treatment}} {{have an effect on the}} strength and hardness drop in the HAZ. The key to improving these material characteristics is to increase heat dissipation out of the workpiece. To do so, the cooling conditions while laser welding <b>press</b> <b>hardened</b> 22 MnB 5 and S 1100 QL were dramatically increased. Experiments were carried out at subzero temperatures down to - 98 °C by using a mixture of liquid and gaseous nitrogen. To further improve heat dissipation, the clamping jaws were entirely made of copper. Hardness measurements and tensile tests were conducted to compare joints welded at room temperature with those welded at - 98 °C. Whilst an improvement of the hardness values could be achieved for the <b>press</b> <b>hardened</b> 22 MnB 5 and the S 1100, no change in the mechanical behavior regarding tensile tests could be observed. Thus, it can be noticed that there is no possibility to improve the strength levels of martensitic steels throughout varying process parameters (like welding velocity) or utilizing an active cooling, even if subzero temperatures down to - 98 °C are applied. A further improvement at lower temperatures is unlikely because heat dissipation in the work piece itself is the limiting factor...|$|R

40|$|The {{demand for}} weight {{reduction}} of cars {{has increased the}} number of <b>press</b> <b>hardened</b> sheet metal parts used in the automotive industry. This leads to an increased demand on the precision of simulations of <b>press</b> <b>hardened</b> sheet metals. An accurate prediction of the post-necking behaviour of materials is therefore needed to increase the precision of computer simulations with large deformations, as for example in forming simulations and crash simulations. Especially fracture simulations of <b>press</b> <b>hardened</b> steel parts with tailored properties have a huge demand on precise material models. Inverse modelling is a common engineering tool to characterize the elasto-plastic behaviour of materials.   Taking experimental data, such as force and displacement data, the material model parameters are optimised until the simulated output reaches a target function.   Then inverse modelling is highly time demanding and needs nonlinear hardening material models.   Lately a new fast method for post necking characterisation of sheet metals, called the Stepwise Modelling Method (SMM), was presented. This method uses full field measurements to obtain the strain field on the surface of sheet metal tensile specimens.  Furthermore, the stepwise modelling method models an experimental hardening curve in a stepwise process.   This hardening curve is a piecewise linear curve and not restricted to any specific material model. In this paper SMM is used to characterize the hardening behaviour for thermally treated boron steel.   These results are compared with the results of inverse modelling. Three different material models are used. The comparison shows a minor deviation in the resulting hardening relations between stepwise modelling and inverse modelling. Since the efficiency {{is an important factor in}} product development calculation times are taken into account.   Comparing calculation time using SMM is considerably more efficient than using inverse modelling. Furthermore another advantage of SMM is shown in the fact that the piecewise linear hardening curves can be fitted to almost any material model without computational costs...|$|R

The effect of deformation at the relevant high temperatures and strain rates on the workability and microstructure of the materials was assessed. The artificial age hardening response subsequent to hot deformation was investigated for the 6082 rolled material. The flow stress and workability of all investigated materials was highly favorable for forming at all temperatures relevant to <b>press</b> form <b>hardening.</b> These properties were most favorable at the solution heat treatment temperatures of the respective alloys. Materials that do not recrystallize during solution heat treatment appeared to give an advantageous grain structure in the finished parts. The extruded materials in this work did not recrystallize in bulk during solution heat treatment nor hot deformation, however recrystallization in the surface layers was not assessed. No disfavor of the fibrous grain structure associated with extruded materials was observed regarding workability at the relevant temperatures, thus extruded materials could be particularly suitable as base materials for <b>press</b> form <b>hardening.</b> The AA 7021. 50 extruded material appeared especially suitable for <b>press</b> form <b>hardening</b> due to a particularly high workability and low flow stress at the relevant forming conditions.

Currently, the challenges in <b>press</b> <b>hardening</b> are not only limited to some single process steps.

Investigations on direct contact heating technology show new prospects regarding fast and flexible austenitization of blanks at compact device dimensions.

40|$|High {{strength}} steels enable new {{solutions for}} weight optimized car bodies without sacrificing crash safety. However, cold forming of these steels is limited {{due to the}} need of high press capacity, increased tool wear, and limitations in possible geometries. One can compensate for these drawbacks by local heat treatment of the blanks. In high-deformation areas {{the strength of the}} material is reduced and the plasticity is increased by diode laser irradiation. Local heat treatment with diode laser radiation could also yield key benefits for the applicability of <b>press</b> <b>hardened</b> parts. High strength is not desired all over the part. Joint areas or deformation zones for requested crash properties require locally reduced strength. In the research project "LOKWAB" funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), heat treatment of high strength steels was investigated in cooperation with Audi, BMW, Daimler, ThyssenKrupp, Fraunhofer- ILT, -IWU and others. A diode laser with an output power of 10 kW was set up to achieve acceptable process speed. Furthermore a homogenizing zoom-optics was developed, providing a rectangular focus with homogeneous power density. The spot size in x- and y-direction can be changed independently during operation. With pyrometer controlled laser power the surface temperature is kept constant, thus the laser treated zone can be flexibly adapted to the needs. Deep-drawing experiments show significant improvement in formability. With this technique, parts can be manufactured, which can conventionally only be made of steel with lower strength. Locally reduced strength of <b>press</b> <b>hardened</b> serial parts was demonstrated...|$|R

The manganeseboron steel 22 MnB 5 have been implemented in sheet <b>press</b> <b>hardening</b> owing to their excellent hot formability, high hardenability, and good temperability even at low cooling rates. However, press-hardened components have shown poor ductility and cracking at relatively small strains. A possible solution to this problem is a selective increase of steel sheet ductility by <b>press</b> <b>hardening</b> process design in areas where the component is required to deform plastically during crash tests. To this end, process designers require information about microstructure and mechanical properties {{as a function of the}} wide spectrum of cooling rates and sequences and austenitizing treatment conditions that can be encountered in production environments. In the present work, a Continuous Cooling Transformation (CCT) diagram with corresponding material properties of sheet steel 22 MnB 5 was determined for a wide spectrum of cooling rates. Heating and cooling programs were conducted in a quenching dilatometer. Motivated by the importance of residual elasticity in crash test performance, this property was measured using a micro-bending test and the results were integrated into the CCT diagrams to complement the hardness testing results. This information is essential for the process design of <b>press</b> <b>hardening</b> of sheet components with gradient material properties...|$|E

40|$|Medium-Manganese (MMn) third {{generation}} advanced {{high strength steel}} (AHSS) was joined using laser welding. The effects of rapid heating and cooling thermal cycles imposed by laser welding on MMn steel was investigated. Microhardness profiles of large heat input diode laser bead-on-plate (BoP) welds found that the steel was not susceptible to heat affected zone (HAZ) softening. The peak temperature above the upper critical temperature (A 3) was determined {{to have a significant}} effect on the microstructure and morphology of austenite in the HAZ. The solidification mode of the diode laser fusion zone (FZ) was primarily columnar dendritic in nature and microsegregation of Mn to the inter-dendritic spaces was observed. Higher energy density fiber laser welding was used to produce laser welded blanks (LWB) containing MMn steel, high strength low alloy (HSLA) and dual-phase (DP) steel. Columnar dendritic solidification was also observed in fiber laser welds of MMn steel. Dissimilar welds containing HSLA and DP 980 were found to produce a martensitic FZ with a fraction of stable austenite. HAZ softening was also absent from microhardness profiles of fiber laser welded MMn steel due to the absence of pre-existing martensite and austenite grain growth. Sub-sized similar MMn steel laser welded tensile blanks were observed to exhibit high joint efficiency with respect to the BM. Tensile testing conducted on dissimilar blanks of HSLA and DP 980 were observed to fracture in their respective BM due to a difference in yield and ultimate tensile strength. Formability of similar MMn steel LWB was limited, but welding to HSLA or DP 980 improved the LWB formability. LWBs of MMn steel were investigated for potential as a new <b>press</b> <b>hardened</b> steel (PHS) chemistry. Standard size tensile geometries of MMn steel LWB showed that the FZ was sensitive to loading conditions where large strains begin to accumulate. Heat treating and quenching a LWB at an inter-critical annealing temperature showed that the austenite reverse transformation can occur in the laser weld FZ. Laser weld joint ductility was determined to significantly improve by heat treating at a lower temperature (700 °C) and a shorter time (3 - 4 minutes) compared to conventional boron <b>press</b> <b>hardened</b> steels...|$|R

Using this <b>press</b> <b>hardening</b> technology, the original material strength of 500 MPa can be increased to between 1200 and 1900 MPa, depending on the chosen material.

40|$|Due to the {{requirements}} of higher strength components and lower carbon dioxide emission, <b>press</b> <b>hardening</b> becomes prevalent in the automotive industry. Heating a boron alloyed steel blank to obtain the austensite phase at high temperature and quenching it to martensitic phase enhances the strength of the products and still allows complex shapes. However, the stamping tool has to endure severe temperature changes, impacts of the counterpart and sliding processes. The wear including material transfer, surface scuffing and complicated reactions between coatings and superficial oxide layers not only shortens the service-life of tools but also decreases the productivity {{and the quality of the}} manufacturing process. Furthermore, the harsh contact conditions between the stamping tools and the work-piece, regarded as the reason for the wear, are difficult to measure in situ. The fundamental study on the tool wear in the <b>press</b> <b>hardening</b> receives insufficient attention. The present work aims at establishing an understanding of tribological characteristics in <b>press</b> <b>hardening</b> and at developing a predictive wear model by establishing a relationship between the contact conditions and the wear process. Based on these results, the extension of the service life of stamping tools through adjustment of process parameters can be possible. Sliding wear, as the dominant wear phenomenon taking place during <b>press</b> <b>hardening</b> processes, causes formation of wear particles and transfer of material fragments to the tool surface. Since the wear process is dependent on the contact conditions, finite element (FE) simulations based on thermo-mechanical calculations are used to investigate the contact conditions in a given <b>press</b> <b>hardening</b> process. Based on the results from the FE [...] simulations, reciprocating tests and tribolgical tests are conducted respectively under <b>press</b> <b>hardening</b> conditions to evaluate the wear coefficients of the Archard's wear model. A modified wear model is implemented in the FE [...] simulations to predict wear depths on the stamping tools. It is noted that most wear concentrates on the tool radius and that it correlates with the sliding distance. The correlation between the experimental set-ups and the wear predictions are analysed.

40|$|In {{the last}} decade, <b>press</b> <b>hardening</b> {{has become a}} fully {{established}} technology in both science and industry {{for the production of}} ultra-high-strength structural components, especially in the automotive industry. Beside the improvement of the car performance such as safety and lightweight design, the production process is also one focus of technology development trends in <b>press</b> <b>hardening.</b> Because of the additional process parameter of temperature, the energy and resource efficiency of such processes {{is one of the most}} important challenges. This includes alternative process steps and process chains as well as zero defect manufacturing by intelligent process control. Beside the high energy effort for heating up the blanks to austenitization temperature, the production floor space requirement is also comparably high, especially for heating devices. Due to the growing product variety in automobile production, combined with shorter product life cycles, the flexibility of production processes becomes more and more significant, which is also true for <b>press</b> <b>hardening.</b> This includes production organization as well as flexibility of production devices. Another topic is part complexity. A trend in automobile car body design is to reduce the number of parts by increasing the complexity – to combine an assembled component to a single part with locally varying properties. By using tailored tempering, the <b>press</b> <b>hardening</b> technology enables a selective approach of material strength in one single component. There are different solutions in production, but the technical effort to create components with tailored properties is relatively high. The article will give an overview about alternative approaches for optimized process chains of <b>press</b> <b>hardening</b> and also includes pre- and post-processing in addition to the actual forming and quenching process. Investigations on direct contact heating technology show new prospects regarding fast and flexible austenitization of blanks at compact device dimensions. By application of high speed impact cutting (HSIC) for trimming of press hardened parts, an alternative technology is available to substitute the slow and energy intensive laser trimming in today’s <b>press</b> <b>hardening</b> lines. Combined with stroke to stroke control based on measuring of process-relevant parameters, a readjustment of the production line is possible in order to produce each part with individual, optimal process parameters to realize zero defect production of property-graded press hardened components with constant high part quality. The significant research in the field of <b>press</b> <b>hardening</b> was carried out at the Fraunhofer IWU, in the hot forming model process chain which enables the running of experiments under conditions similar to an industrial scale. All practical tests where prepared by design of experiments and assisted by thermo-mechanical FE simulations...|$|E

Rotating the screw or micrometer pushes the platform forward. A spring provides restoring force to keep the platform {{in contact with the}} actuator. This provides more precise motion of the stage. Stages designed to be mounted vertically use a slightly different arrangement, where the actuator is attached to the movable platform and its tip rests on a metal pad on the fixed base. This allows the weight of the platform and its load to be supported by the actuator rather than the spring.|$|R
40|$|Growing {{demands for}} {{passenger}} safety, vehicle performance and fueleconomy is a continuous driving {{force for the}} increase in use of advancedhigh strength steels (AHSS) in the automotive industry. Thesesteels area characterised by improved formability and crash worthinesscompared to conventional steel grades. An important prerequisite of theapplication of new material grades is the characterization of its mechanicalproperties. Post-localization and fracture predictive technologiesgreatly facilitate the design of components which make optimal use ofthese steel grades. In this thesis, <b>press</b> <b>hardened</b> boron alloyed steelsubjected to differential thermo-mechanical processing is characterized. Fracture properties {{in relation to the}} different microstructures obtainedis studied. Furthermore a dual phase (DP) cold forming steel is chosenfor evaluation of ductility limit in shear loading. throughout thiswork a strategy for modelling post-localization response and predictingductility limit using shell elements larger then the typical width of thelocalized neck is used. The studied material is assumed to be in a stateof plane stress. Mesh dependency is alleviated by the introduction of aelement size dependent parameter into the constitutive description. Thisparameter acts as a hardening parameter, controlling the evolution ofthe yield surface depending on loading, strain history and shell elementsize. Model calibration relies on a full field measurement technique, DigitalSpeckle Photography (DSP), to record the plane deformation field oftensile specimens. Quantitative measurements of the severely localizeddeformation preceding crack initiation are feasible. With the proposedstrategy, mesh sensitivity in terms of post localization load responseand fracture elongation predictions is reduced significantly compared toresults obtained without the element size dependent parameter. It wasfound that high strain hardening favours strain localization of shear band type, and accelerates the formation of a localized neck. The hardeningcharacteristics is determinant to which deformation mode dissipates theminimum energy. For the DP steel, the Tresca yield surface more accuratelydescribes the yielding point compared to the von Mises planestress elipse. Furthermore, the exponential ductility function dependenton the stress triaxiality parameter agrees well with experimental fracturedata in the ductile loading regime for both DP and boron steel. In shear loading, the maximum shear (MS) stress criterion successfullydescribes the ductility limit. Due to the significantly different ductilityof the various microstructures obtainable by the thermo-mechanicalprocessing of boron alloyed steel, a modelling strategy is needed. It wasfound that in ductile loading, local equivalent fracture strain can be relatedto the hardness of that material point. An exponential decrease inductility with increased hardness describes experimental data collectedfor five different microstructures.

500|$|The {{institution}} of the draft and the arrest of outspoken anti-administration Democrat Clement Vallandigham further incensed Pierce, who gave an address to New Hampshire Democrats in July 1863 vilifying Lincoln. [...] "Who, I ask, has clothed the President with power to dictate {{to any one of}} us when we must or when we may speak, or be silent upon any subject, and especially in relation to the conduct of any public servant?", he demanded. Pierce's comments were ill-received in much of the North, especially as his criticism of Lincoln's aims coincided with the twin Union victories at Gettysburg and Vicksburg. Pierce's reputation in the North was further damaged the following month when the Mississippi plantation of the Confederate president, Jefferson Davis, was seized by Union soldiers. Pierce's correspondence with Davis, all pre-war, revealing his deep friendship with Davis and predicting that civil war would result in insurrection in the North, was sent to the <b>press.</b> Pierce's words <b>hardened</b> abolitionist sentiment against him.|$|R
