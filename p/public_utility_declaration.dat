40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} <b>public</b> <b>utility</b> land equipping, <b>public</b> <b>utility</b> fee. Both the {{calculation}} and allocation of <b>public</b> <b>utility</b> fee for certain areas are analysed. The <b>public</b> <b>utility</b> fee calculation, {{which is in}} accordance with the ordinance on equipping the building plots in areas of the municipal spatial plan of the Municipality of Kamnik (example 1), is presented within the thesis. The actual costs of <b>public</b> <b>utility</b> land equipping which are based on the physical indicators of the ordinance on the equipping programme and the <b>public</b> <b>utility</b> fee following the instruction for the <b>public</b> <b>utility</b> fee calculation (Official Gazette No. 4 / 99) are both calculated and strictly comply with the principle of contribution and counter - contribution (example 2). Activities in the areas of municipal elaborated spatial plans show different consumption of potable water, therefore, based on an assumption on potable water consumption in <b>public</b> <b>utility</b> land equipping, we have calculated the <b>public</b> <b>utility</b> fee according to estimated or actual potable water consumption (example 3). We have determined that the existing calculation and distribution of the <b>public</b> <b>utility</b> fee method and distribution of the urban contribution (example 1) complies the least with the principle of contribution and counter - contribution. The results in the other two examples are similar, since both take into account the principle of contribution and counter - contribution, as demonstrated by the structural fractions of the distributed <b>public</b> <b>utility</b> fee among taxpayers. ...|$|R

40|$|Most <b>public</b> <b>utilities</b> {{depend on}} {{electric}} power to function, so it is paramount that a constant power source is available. These <b>public</b> <b>utilities</b> get their supply from the public mains {{and in the case}} where the public mains fails a back-up power source is necessary to ensure the continuous operation of the <b>public</b> <b>utilities.</b> Switching the <b>public</b> <b>utilities</b> from the mains to the back-up power creates a period of time when the utilities will be without power and the longer the time delay the lesser the efficiency of the <b>public</b> <b>utilities.</b> The stress of manual switching also makes the utilities inefficient. Examples of these <b>public</b> <b>utilities</b> are street lights, traffic lights, water pumps and traffic sign indicators. A device that completely eliminates the stress of manually switching <b>public</b> <b>utilities</b> from the mains supply to the back-up supply is the Automatic Mains and Phase Changer (AMPC). It also greatly reduces the power outage time delay experience during the switching. This paper reports a research that evaluates the relationship between the stress levels during manual load switching and the stress levels using the AMPC for automatic load switching. It also evaluates the relationship between the time lag experienced {{with the use of the}} AMPC and the time lag experienced when the switching is done manually...|$|R

50|$|In the United States, <b>public</b> <b>utilities</b> {{are often}} natural {{monopolies}} because the infrastructure {{required to produce}} and deliver a product such as electricity or water is very expensive to build and maintain.

5000|$|A <b>public</b> <b>utilities</b> {{commission}} is a governmental agency {{in a particular}} jurisdiction that regulates the commercial activities related to associated electric, natural gas, telecommunications, water, railroad, rail transit, and/or passenger transportation companies. For example, the California <b>Public</b> <b>Utilities</b> Commission (or CPUC) [...] and the <b>Public</b> <b>Utility</b> Commission of Texas regulate the utility companies in California and Texas, respectively, {{on behalf of their}} citizens and ratepayers (customers). These <b>public</b> <b>utility</b> commissions (PUCs) are typically composed of commissioners, who are appointed by their respective governors, and dedicated staff that implement and enforce rules and regulations, approve or deny rate increases, and monitor/report on relevant activities. Over the years, various changes have dramatically re-shaped the mission and focus of many <b>public</b> <b>utility</b> commissions. Their focus has typically shifted from the up-front regulation of rates and services to the oversight of competitive marketplaces and enforcement of regulatory compliance.|$|R
5000|$|The {{traditional}} {{definition of}} the term <b>public</b> <b>utility</b> is [...] "an infrastructural necessity for the general public where the supply conditions are such that the public may not be provided with a reasonable service at reasonable prices because of monopoly in the area." [...] Conventional <b>public</b> <b>utilities</b> include water, natural gas, and electricity. In order to secure the interests of the <b>public,</b> <b>utilities</b> are regulated. <b>Public</b> <b>utilities</b> can also be seen as natural monopolies implying that the highest degree of efficiency is accomplished under one operator in the marketplace.Public Utility regulation has been largely criticized because people believe it produces undesirable and indirect effects. However, others argue that truly effective government regulation is valuable.Social media as a <b>public</b> <b>utility</b> can be crucial debate because utilities get regulated, so marking social media websites as utilities would require government regulation of various social media websites and platforms such as Facebook, Google, and Twitter.|$|R
