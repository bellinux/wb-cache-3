40|$|In this issue, Potts and Reichenstein {{describe}} {{features of}} U. S. <b>savings</b> <b>bonds</b> and discuss their evaluation. The article {{can serve as}} a reference for busy practitioners who may not follow changes in the <b>savings</b> <b>bond</b> market closely, especially those who tend to rely on productrelated education for updates on financial instruments. <b>Savings</b> <b>bonds</b> remain an important investment for individuals; on March 31, 1994, individuals held $ 174. 9 million in U. S. <b>savings</b> <b>bonds,</b> a 7 % increase from one year prior (Williams, 1994). Further, as Table 1, “Demographic Characteristics of Individual <b>Savings</b> <b>Bond</b> Holders, ” indicates, the holding of <b>savings</b> <b>bonds</b> is not exclusive to any particular age group or income level (Federal Reserve Bulletin, 1994). I. POTENTIAL CHANGES The recently (November 1994) passed General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) included provisions that gave theTreasury Department full authority over interest rate setting on U. S. <b>savings</b> <b>bonds.</b> The Agreement removes the 4 % guarantee previously set by Congress for bonds held for less than five years and enables the Treasury to index the <b>savings</b> <b>bond</b> rate to that of the six-month T-bill. Peter Hollenbach, a spokesman for the Bureau of Public Debt, indicated in December 1994 that changes will not be retroactive and “an announcement of any change is some months away ” (Lazzareschi, 1994 b). While details are not finalized, changes expected are: l Pegging the rate for <b>savings</b> <b>bonds</b> held for less than live years to 85 % of the six-month T-bill rate, eliminating the 4 % rate guarantee. Bonds held for 5 years or more will continue to earn 85 % of the average rate paid by Treasury notes with five years left to maturity, with a minimum of 4 %. l Changing interest accrual from a monthly to a semiannual basis. Those individuals who sell just before the six-month or one-year anniversary will forego the partial period of interest...|$|R

One month later, the first Series A <b>savings</b> <b>bond</b> proceeded to be issued with a face value of $25. At first, the main purpose was to help finance World War II, these were referred to as Defensive Bonds. On April 30, 1941 Roosevelt purchased the first bond from Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau, Jr.. The next day, they were made available to the public. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, Defensive Bonds were informally known as War <b>Savings</b> <b>Bonds,</b> citizens could buy the bonds for a dime. All the revenue coming in from the bonds went directly to support the war. Even after the war ended, <b>savings</b> <b>bonds</b> became popular with families. Unlike before, people started to just wait to cash them so the bonds would grow in value. To help sustain post-war sales, they were advertised on television, films, and commercials. When John F. Kennedy was president, he encouraged Americans to purchase them, which stimulated a large enrollment in <b>savings</b> <b>bonds.</b> By 1976, President Ford helped celebrate the 35th anniversary of the U.S. <b>Savings</b> <b>Bond</b> Program. The film, [...] "An American Partnership" [...] honored the role of citizens in financing the nation's growth. In 1990, Congress created the Education <b>Savings</b> <b>Bond</b> program which helped Americans finance a college education. A bond purchased on or after January 1, 1990, is tax-free (subject to income limitations) if used to pay tuition and fees at an eligible institution.|$|R

40|$|<b>Savings</b> <b>bonds</b> {{have always}} served {{multiple}} objectives: funding the U. S. government, democratizing national financing, and enabling families to save. Increasingly, the authors write, that last goal has been ignored. A series of efficiency measures introduced in 2003 make these bonds less attractive and less accessible to savers. Public policy {{should go in}} the opposite direction: U. S. <b>savings</b> <b>bonds</b> should be reinvigorated to help low- and moderate-income (LMI) families build assets. More and more, those families’ saving needs are ignored by private-sector asset managers and marketers. With a few relatively modest changes, Tufano and Schneider explain, the <b>savings</b> <b>bonds</b> program can be reinvented to help those families save, while still increasing {{the efficiency of the}} program as a debt management device. <b>Savings</b> <b>bonds</b> provide market-rate returns, with no transaction costs, and are a useful commitment savings device. The authors’ proposed changes include (a) allowing federal taxpayers to purchase bonds with tax refunds; (b) enabling LMI families to redeem their bonds before 12 months; (c) leveraging private-sector organizations to market savings bonds; and (d) contemplating a role for <b>savings</b> <b>bonds</b> in the life cycles of LMI families...|$|R

50|$|<b>Savings</b> <b>bond</b> {{interest}} is tax deferred. This {{means that you}} pay tax only when the bond is cashed (or stops earning interest after 30 years).

50|$|<b>Savings</b> <b>bonds</b> come {{in eight}} denominations: $25, $50, $75, $100, $200, $500, $1,000, and $5,000. After purchase, the holder must wait at least twelve months before cashing it in, {{when they will}} receive the capital plus some interest. The {{maturity}} periods can vary. For example, {{if you buy a}} bond with a value of $50 for $25, you'll have to wait at least 17 years to get back your investment from the government, depending on the interest rate. The longer you wait, the greater interest you earn, however <b>savings</b> <b>bonds</b> have a 30-year maximum of interest accrual. After that the bond no longer accrues interest. <b>Savings</b> <b>bonds</b> are protected because they are secured by the U.S. government. The principal and earned interest are registered with the Treasury Department, so if a bond is lost, stolen, or destroyed they can be replaced at no cost. <b>Savings</b> <b>bonds</b> can also have value as a collectible since the government stopped issuing them in paper form.|$|R
40|$|The Bank of Canada first {{introduced}} Canada <b>Savings</b> <b>Bonds</b> during the First and Second World Wars.

Canada <b>Savings</b> <b>Bonds</b> proved to be very popular, providing investors with a convenient, flexible and safe investment. Over time the bonds failed to remain competitive with other low-risk investment options, and {{the high cost of}} administering the program called into question its relevance.
