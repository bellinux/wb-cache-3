25|$|In tubular reactors, {{feed protein}} {{solution}} and the precipitating reagent are contacted in {{a zone of}} efficient mixing then fed into long tubes where precipitation takes place. The fluid in volume elements approach <b>plug</b> <b>flow</b> as they move though the tubes of the reactor. Turbulent flow is promoted through wire mesh inserts in the tube. The tubular reactor does not require moving mechanical parts and is inexpensive to build. However, the reactor can become impractically long if the particles aggregate slowly.|$|E
25|$|High solids (dry) digesters are {{designed}} to process materials with a solids content between 25 and 40%. Unlike wet digesters that process pumpable slurries, high solids (dry – stackable substrate) digesters {{are designed}} to process solid substrates without the addition of water. The primary styles of dry digesters are continuous vertical <b>plug</b> <b>flow</b> and batch tunnel horizontal digesters. Continuous vertical <b>plug</b> <b>flow</b> digesters are upright, cylindrical tanks where feedstock is continuously fed {{into the top of}} the digester, and flows downward by gravity during digestion. In batch tunnel digesters, the feedstock is deposited in tunnel-like chambers with a gas-tight door. Neither approach has mixing inside the digester. The amount of pretreatment, such as contaminant removal, depends both upon the nature of the waste streams being processed and the desired quality of the digestate. Size reduction (grinding) is beneficial in continuous vertical systems, as it accelerates digestion, while batch systems avoid grinding and instead require structure (e.g. yard waste) to reduce compaction of the stacked pile. Continuous vertical dry digesters have a smaller footprint due to the shorter effective retention time and vertical design. Wet digesters can be designed to operate in either a high-solids content, with a total suspended solids (TSS) concentration greater than ~20%, or a low-solids concentration less than ~15%.|$|E
25|$|Primary {{clarifier}} effluent {{was discharged}} directly to eutrophic natural wetlands for decades before environmental regulations discouraged the practice. Where adequate land is available, stabilization ponds with constructed wetland ecosystems {{can be built}} to perform secondary treatment separated from the natural wetlands receiving secondary treated sewage. Constructed wetlands resemble fixed-film systems more than suspended growth systems, because natural mixing is minimal. Constructed wetland design uses <b>plug</b> <b>flow</b> assumptions to compute the residence time required for treatment. Patterns of vegetation growth and solids deposition in wetland ecosystems, however, can create preferential flow pathways which may reduce average residence time. Measurement of wetland treatment efficiency is complicated because most traditional water quality measurements cannot differentiate between sewage pollutants and biological productivity of the wetland. Demonstration of treatment efficiency may require more expensive analyses.|$|E

50|$|In {{a second}} approach, more {{realistic}} and coming from experimental observations on blood flows, according to Thurston, {{there is a}} plasma release-cell layering at the walls surrounding a <b>plugged</b> <b>flow.</b> It is a fluid layer in which at a distance δ, viscosity η {{is a function of}} δ written as η(δ), and these surrounding layers do not meet at the vessel centre in real blood flow.

25|$|Measures {{creating}} uniform wastewater loadings tend {{to reduce}} the probability of upsets. Fixed-film or attached growth secondary treatment bioreactors are similar to a <b>plug</b> <b>flow</b> reactor model circulating water over surfaces colonized by biofilm, while suspended-growth bioreactors resemble a continuous stirred-tank reactor keeping microorganisms suspended while water is being treated. Secondary treatment bioreactors may {{be followed by a}} physical phase separation to remove biological solids from the treated water. Upset duration of fixed film secondary treatment systems may be longer because of the time required to recolonize the treatment surfaces. Suspended growth ecosystems may be restored from a population reservoir. Activated sludge recycle systems provide an integrated reservoir if upset conditions are detected in time for corrective action. Sludge recycle may be temporarily turned off to prevent sludge washout during peak storm flows when dilution keeps BOD concentrations low. Suspended growth activated sludge systems can be operated in a smaller space than fixed-film trickling filter systems that treat the same amount of water; but fixed-film systems are better able to cope with drastic changes in the amount of biological material and can provide higher removal rates for organic material and suspended solids than suspended growth systems.|$|E
50|$|In {{terms of}} {{trajectory}} through the reactor, the ideal flow condition for a continuous reactor is <b>plug</b> <b>flow</b> (since this delivers uniform residence time within the reactor). There is however {{a measure of}} conflict between good mixing and <b>plug</b> <b>flow</b> since mixing generates axial as well as radial movement of the fluid. In tube type reactors (with or without static mixing), adequate mixing can be achieved without seriously compromising <b>plug</b> <b>flow.</b> For this reason, these types of reactor are {{sometimes referred to as}} <b>plug</b> <b>flow</b> reactors.|$|E
50|$|In fluid mechanics, <b>plug</b> <b>flow</b> is {{a simple}} model of the {{velocity}} profile of a fluid flowing in a pipe. In <b>plug</b> <b>flow,</b> the velocity of the fluid {{is assumed to be}} constant across any cross-section of the pipe perpendicular to the axis of the pipe.

50|$|Real <b>plug</b> <b>flow</b> {{reactors}} do {{not satisfy}} the idealized flow patterns, back mix flow or <b>plug</b> <b>flow</b> deviation form ideal {{behavior can be}} due to channeling of fluid through the vessel, recycling of fluid within the vessel or due {{to the presence of}} stagnant region or dead zone of fluid in the vessel.

50|$|With {{respect to}} batch and <b>plug</b> <b>flow</b> {{reactors}} (PFRs), the dispersities {{for the different}} polymerization methods are the same. This is largely because while batch reactors depend entirely on time of reaction, <b>plug</b> <b>flow</b> reactors depend on distance traveled in the reactor and its length. Since time and distance are related by velocity, <b>plug</b> <b>flow</b> reactors can be designed to mirror batch reactors by controlling the velocity and length of the reactor. Continuously stirred-tank reactors (CSTRs) however have a residence time distribution and cannot mirror batch or <b>plug</b> <b>flow</b> reactors, which can cause {{a difference in the}} dispersity of final polymer.|$|E

40|$|A {{system of}} hard spheres (with {{negligible}} Brownian motion) is suspended in a viscous fluid, and a macroscopic shear rate s is imposed. In the resulting steady state, the probability p for one sphere {{to be exactly}} in contact with another sphere is finite (p > 0) and independent of s. When the concentration ϕ of spheres increases, they progressively become associated in clusters. We postulate that, when ϕ exceeds a certain critical value ϕc, an infinite cluster appears, in analogy with percolation problems. The hydrodynamics must then include two macroscopic velocity fields, and leads naturally to <b>plug</b> <b>flows,</b> in qualitative agreement with experimental observations; however, the model predicts an anomaly in the plot of apparent viscosity versus concentration, which {{has not yet been}} observed...|$|R

40|$|Present day {{microfluidics}} widely uses electrokinetic effects like eletrosmosis and electrophoresis {{to achieve}} flow control. These methods require extensive micromachining processes. Also, the fabrication of valves and valve-seats is difficult, which frequently leads to leakages and eventual {{breakdown of the}} system. This paper introduces the use of ferrofluids as an alternative for flow control in microchannels. Numerical simulation of flow through a microchannel using a ferrofluid {{in the presence of}} an external magnetic field is performed by coupling the flow and magnetic phenomena. An additional term calculated from the ferrofluid magnetization equations, is introduced in the Navier-Stokes equations to account for the magnetic force. The maximum velocity in a magnetically driven flow is shown to be a linear function of magnitude of magnetization of the permanent magnet. Further, the insertion of micron-size magnetic particles (referred here as magnetic <b>plugs)</b> in the <b>flow</b> field has been discussed. These plugs can be used to provide appropriate barriers to the flow by controlling their movement externally. Using the combination of ferrofluid and magnetic <b>plugs,</b> <b>flow</b> control can be achieved by the variation of external magnetic field alone...|$|R

The key assumption is that as a <b>plug</b> <b>flows</b> through a PFR, the fluid is perfectly mixed in the radial direction but not in the axial direction (forwards or backwards). Each plug of differential volume is considered as a separate entity, effectively an infinitesimally small continuous stirred tank reactor, limiting to zero volume.

50|$|A Continuous Oscillatory Baffled Reactor (COBR) is a {{specially}} designed reactor to achieve <b>plug</b> <b>flow</b> under laminar flow conditions. Achieving <b>plug</b> <b>flow</b> has previously been limited to either {{a large number of}} continuous stir tank reactors (CSTR) in series or conditions with high turbulent flow. The technology incorporates annular baffles to a tubular reactor framework to create eddies when liquid is pushed up through the tube. Likewise, when liquid is on a downstroke through the tube, eddies are created {{on the other side of}} the baffles. Eddy generation on both sides of the baffles creates very effective mixing while still maintaining <b>plug</b> <b>flow.</b> By using COBR, potentially higher yields of product can be made with greater control and reduced waste.|$|E
40|$|International audienceA plug of wetting {{liquid is}} driven at {{constant}} pressure through a bifurcation in a microchannel. For a plug advancing {{in a straight}} channel, {{we find that the}} viscous dissipation in the bulk may be estimated using Poiseuille's law while Bretherton and Tanner's laws model the additional dissipation occurring at the rear and front interfaces. At a second stage, we focus on the behavior of the <b>plug</b> <b>flowing</b> through a T-junction. Experiments show the existence of a threshold pressure, below which the plug remains blocked at the entrance of the junction. Above this required pressure, the plug enters the bifurcation and either ruptures or splits into two daughter plugs, depending on the applied pressure and on the initial length of the plug. By means of geometrical arguments and the previously cited laws, we propose a global model to predict the transitions between the three observed behaviors. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.
