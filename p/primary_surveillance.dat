50|$|Radar {{directly}} {{measures the}} range and bearing of an aircraft from a ground-based antenna. The <b>primary</b> <b>surveillance</b> radar is usually a pulse radar. It transmits a continuous high power sequence of pulses. Bearing {{is measured by the}} position of the rotating radar antenna when it receives the reflected beam that comes from the body aircraft; and range is measured by the time it takes for the radar to receive the reflected beam.|$|E
50|$|A Primary radar (PSR <b>Primary</b> <b>Surveillance</b> Radar) is a {{conventional}} radar sensor that illuminates {{a large portion}} of space with an electromagnetic wave and receives back the reflected waves from targets within that space. The term thus refers to a radar system used to detect and localize potentially non-cooperative targets. It is specific to the field of air traffic control where it is opposed to the secondary radar which receives additional information from the target's transponder.|$|E

50|$|The AeroVironment RQ-20 Puma is a small, battery powered, American hand-launched {{unmanned}} aircraft system produced by AeroVironment based in California. <b>Primary</b> mission is <b>surveillance</b> and intelligence gathering using an electro-optical and infrared camera.|$|R
50|$|<b>Primary</b> <b>surveillance</b> radar {{does not}} require any {{cooperation}} from the aircraft. It is robust {{in the sense that}} surveillance outage failure modes are limited to those associated with the ground radar system. Secondary surveillance radar depends on active replies from the aircraft. Its failure modes include the transponder aboard the aircraft. Typical ADS-B aircraft installations use the output of the navigation unit for navigation and for cooperative surveillance, introducing a common failure mode that must be accommodated in air traffic surveillance systems.|$|E
5000|$|The system {{consists}} of transponders, installed in aircraft, and secondary surveillance radars (SSRs), installed at {{air traffic control}} facilities. The SSR is sometimes co-located with the <b>primary</b> <b>surveillance</b> radar, or PSR. These two radar systems work in conjunction to produce a synchronized surveillance picture. The SSR transmits interrogations and listens for any replies. Transponders that receive an interrogation decode it, decide whether to reply, and then respond with the requested information when appropriate. Note that in common informal usage, the term [...] "SSR" [...] is sometimes {{used to refer to}} the entire ATCRBS system, however this term (as found in technical publications) properly refers only to the ground radar itself.|$|E
5000|$|ADS-B, which {{consists}} of two different services, [...] "ADS-B Out" [...] and [...] "ADS-B In", could replace radar as the <b>primary</b> <b>surveillance</b> method for controlling aircraft worldwide. In the United States, ADS-B is an integral component of the NextGen national airspace strategy for upgrading and enhancing aviation infrastructure and operations. The ADS-B system can also provide traffic- and government-generated graphical weather information through TIS-B and FIS-B applications. ADS-B enhances safety by making an aircraft visible, realtime, to air traffic control (ATC) and to other appropriately equipped ADS-B aircraft with position and velocity data transmitted every second. ADS-B data can be recorded and downloaded for post-flight analysis. ADS-B also provides the data infrastructure for inexpensive flight tracking, planning, and dispatch.|$|E

40|$|International audienceBackground:In <b>primary</b> care <b>surveillance</b> systems {{based on}} {{voluntary}} participation, biased results may arise fromthe lack of representativeness of the monitored population and uncertainty regarding the population denominator,especially in health systems where patient registration is not required. Methods:Based on {{the observation of}} a positive association between number of cases reported and number ofconsultations by the participating general practitioners (GPs), we define several weighted incidence estimatorsusing external information on consultation volume in GPs. These estimators are applied to data reported in aFrench <b>primary</b> care <b>surveillance</b> system based on voluntary GPs (theSentinellesnetwork) for comparison. Results:Depending on hypotheses for weight computations, relative changes in weekly national-level incidenceestimates up to 3 % for influenza, 6 % for diarrhea, and 11 % for varicella were observed. The use of consultation-weightedestimates led to bias reduction in the estimates. At the regional level (NUTS 2 level -Nomenclature of Statistical TerritorialUnits Level 2), relative changes were even larger betweenincidence estimates, with changes between - 40 % and + 55 %. Using bias-reduced weights decreased variation in incidence between regions and increased spatial autocorrelation. Conclusions:Post-stratification using external administrative data may improve incidence estimates in surveillancesystems based on voluntary participatio...|$|R

5000|$|Today other radars {{share the}} spacetracking duties, but the AN/FPS-85 {{is still the}} <b>primary</b> <b>surveillance</b> radar in the US Space Surveillance Network due to its high power and good coverage, {{reportedly}} handling 30% of the SSN workload. The Air Force claims {{it is the only}} phased array radar that can track spacecraft in deep space, can detect an object the size of a basketball out to geosynchronous orbit, 35,700 km in space, and is the most powerful radar in the world. [...] However its aging legacy technology, which uses vacuum tubes, gives it high maintenance costs. [...] Its maintenance crew must repair an average of 17 of its 5000 modular transmitter units daily, at an annual cost of $2 million.|$|E
5000|$|An ATC {{ground station}} {{consists}} of two radar systems and their associated support components. The most prominent component is the PSR. It is {{also referred to as}} skin paint radar because it shows not synthetic or alpha-numeric target symbols, but bright (or colored) blips or areas on the radar screen produced by the RF energy reflections from the target's [...] "skin." [...] This is a non-cooperative process, no additional avionic devices are needed. The radar detects and displays reflective objects within the radar's operating range. Weather radar data is displayed in skin paint mode. The <b>primary</b> <b>surveillance</b> radar is subject to the radar equation that says signal strength drops off as the fourth power of distance to the target. Objects detected using the PSR are known as primary targets.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, the {{aircraft}} has other mission capabilities like {{identification friend or foe}} (IFF), electronic and communication support measures, C-band line-of-sight and Ku-band SATCOM datalinks, etc., {{similar to those}} on the AWACS and CAEW systems. The important modes of operation of the primary radar system are the surface surveillance and the air surveillance. The sensor has the abilities to search, track-while-scan, priority tracking, high performance tracking, etc. In priority tracking, the targets will be placed in full track mode even if these cross the <b>primary</b> <b>surveillance</b> area. In high performance tracking, additional measurements will be made to improve the tracking accuracy. Utilising active aperture technology, the radar provides a fast-beam agile system that can operate in several modes concurrently. Inter-operability with AWACS, other AEW&C aircraft, fighters and ground-exploitation stations is ensured using the data-links with voice and data channels. The aircraft cabin houses five operator work stations to adequately meet requirements of the operational mission tasks.|$|E

40|$|Background: In many European countries, <b>primary</b> care <b>surveillance</b> {{networks}} {{play a role}} {{in public}} health surveillance. Objectives: To update an inventory of surveillance networks, to describe them and report on their organization and function in a standardized way. To investigate whether and under what conditions their information can contribute to surveillance at a European level. Methods: Surveillance networks were defined as 'A network of practices or community based primary care physicians who monitor one or more specific illness problems on a regular and continuing basis. For the inventory questionnaires were sent out, followed by site visits to seven networks using a standardized audit checklist. Results: We sent out 75 questionnaires and received 57 back (73 % response rate), with 33 (58 % of responders) fitting our selection criteria. National surveillance networks were identified in 11 countries. Many had an infectious disease surveillance component, particularly for influenza. Most were funded by the Ministry of Health, some by research funds. The median number of general practitioners was 120, comprising a stable group of general practitioners and covering a representative sample of the general population. The frequency of reporting varied from daily to annually, depending on the purpose of the network. Conclusions: A large number of <b>primary</b> care <b>surveillance</b> networks exist in Europe. Their value has been shown with the surveillance of influenza, but the challenge is now to extend their use to other diseases. When fulfilling identical minimal criteria they can provide comparable estimates of morbidity, ultimately leading to improved national and European surveillance. (aut. ref. ...|$|R

40|$|Nonviable Mycobacterium {{tuberculosis}} strain Jamaica {{suspended in}} oil-droplet emulsions {{was used to}} enhance resistance of mice against encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV). The mycobacteria-injected mice were significantly resistant to 50, 000 50 % lethal doses of EMCV. Similar concentrations of virus in plasma of normal and mycobacteria-injected mice from 1 to 120 min after injection of EMCV showed that resistance was not a result of rapid elimination of virus from the circulation.
