Feral pigs have long been implicated as vectors in the spread of this introduced {{plant pathogen}} due to their contact with infested soil and foraging habits. This study aimed to investigate the potential for feral pigs to disseminate P. cinnamomi and to determine {{their role in the}} spread of dieback. Feral <b>pigs</b> <b>trapped</b> in three sampling areas within the northern jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) forest of south-west Western Australia were sampled for the presence of P. cinnamomi.

The joint number of yearly caught male and female individuals and also separately the samples of females were summarised for each observing station. The change of female individual number as a function of total individual number was determined from the coherent pairs of value. The connection can be described by linear function. The proportion of females is 38 %. The relative frequency of females was also determined in the function of the individual number. The shown point-mass is similar to the damped vibration known at technical systems. It was established that the female proportion was higher than the average if the individual number is low, but it showed average value when the individual number was high.

40|$|Increased {{emphasis}} on energy management has helped sites reduce system cost through {{the diagnosis and}} repair of ?Leaking? or ?Blowing? steam traps (?Leakage Failures?). Timely maintenance response is a significant action to lower energy use and GHG emissions generated by steam production. But, what action should be taken with Cold Traps? In every steam trap survey to determine the steam trap population?s current state of health, there are usually {{a significant amount of}} steam traps determined to be ?Cold? or ?Low Temp? (?Drainage Failures? or ?Cold Traps?). It seems that site personnel commonly assign a lower response priority to these Drainage Failures traps, and sometimes actually implement a practice to intentionally convert Leaking traps into Cold Traps by closing the inlet stop valve to immediately stop energy leakage. Subsequently, they may label those traps as ?Valved- Out? or ?Out of Service,? but those <b>trap</b> <b>stations</b> were originally designed as needed to drain retained condensate from the system. So, the correct designation for such a <b>trap</b> <b>station</b> is ?Cold,? regardless of the current intention. If the <b>trap</b> <b>station</b> does not drain condensate and is not hot, it is ?Cold. ? It can be astounding that many sites are not convinced of what actions or priority to take to repair Cold Traps, even while intrinsically understanding that {{there is something wrong with}} having Cold Traps that cannot drain condensate from a steam system. It often is simply because sites may not be fully aware of the potential dangers of uncorrected Cold Traps or the significant safety, reliability, and energy benefits of addressing them. Although safety is always the main priority, it cannot be overstated that there are huge reliability and energy benefits to prioritized repair of Cold Traps. Unfortunately, proactive response to repair Cold Traps in a steam system is not always achieved, often because the real benefits of such a response are not understood. Therefore, further review of ?WHAT TO DO ABOUT COLD TRAPS?AND WHY?? is warranted for safe, reliable, and energy-efficient management of the condensate discharge locations (CDLs).

However, whilst Apis mellifera displayed a strong preference for glucose-fructose- sucrose over an equicaloric sucrose solution, AHB displayed no preference between equicaloric solutions of sucrose, glucose-fructose and glucose-fructose-sucrose.

40|$|Purpose of study: Three {{sympatric}} {{species of}} white-footed mice, Peromyscus boylii, P. maniculatus and P. truei {{occur in the}} northern Coast Range of California. Closely related, coexisting species present useful opportunities to investigate niche resource partitioning. Previous {{research has indicated that}} a variety of factors can influence the niche separation in Peromyscus. The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine the role of spatial segregation, and habitat association in the niche partitioning in northern California Peromyscus. Procedure: Prior to field work, museum specimens from the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco, and the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology, U. C. Berkeley, were examined to: 1) develop a key to the identification of Peromyscus on the basis of external morphology 2) obtain historical information on the distribution and sympatry of the Peromyscus in the study area. New collections were vouchered and a key to the live identification of P. boylii, P. maniculatus and P. truei was developed. Live-trapping and vegetation-habitat sampling were used in combination to determine the spatial segregation and habitat association of the three Peromyscus spp. on 10 habitat sampling grids in Lake, Mendocino, and Sonoma Counties. Trapping grids consisted of 24 <b>trap</b> <b>stations</b> set at 20 -meter intervals with the grids being 8 <b>trap</b> <b>stations</b> long and three wide. A total collection effort of 5, 544 trap nights was conducted from June 1982 to Aug. 1983. Vegetation was sampled with line intercept methods on four 10 meter line transects at each <b>trap</b> <b>station.</b> Physical features, slope, slope exposure, substrate and non-plant cover were also recorded. Findings: The three Peromyscus species were found to be 'macro-sympatric' and 'micro-allotopic', spatially partitioning the available habitats. P. truei was the most abundant species captured in the study area and occurred in the greatest variety of habitats. P. truei was most strongly associated with short chamise chaparral slopes where low ground cover was available. P. boylii was found to associate strongly with taller vegetation on north-facing slopes. P. maniculatus was found to 1 inhabit chaparral edge locations where large amounts of grass were present. f: [...] maniculatus also associated with rocks and logs on the ground. Conclusions: The prominence of a patchy 'mosaic' vegetation pattern in California has resulted in a spatial segregation of the macro-sympatric Peromyscus species. This segregation has not been previously described for the California Coast Range because the vegetation patterns and the Peromyscus species are closely intermingled. P. truei inhabits the widest range of habitats and occurs in all habitats that are not occupied by P. boylii or P. maniculatus. P. maniculatus inhabits ecotone areas where vegetation disturbance is present and where grass seeds are available. The most likely hypothesis to account for P. boylii's preference for taller chaparral is that this species exhibits more arboreal activity, perhaps giving it resource advantages over P. truei. The relative needs for water, and the different temperatures of the different chaparral stands cannot be excluded as potential modes of habitat partitioning...|$|R

40|$|Streamside {{management}} zones (SMZs), composed {{primarily of}} hardwoods {{in the southeastern}} United States, provide habitat diversity within intensively managed pine (Pinus spp.) plantations. However, effects of SMZ width and adjacent plantation structure on riparian wildlife communities are poorly understood. Therefore, during 1990 - 1995, we examined small mammal communities within 5 SMZ width classes (1 - 20 to> 100 m) embedded within three types of pine plantations (young, open canopy; closed canopy: and thinned) and three natural riparian stands in the Ouachita Mountains of Arkansas, USA. We captured small mammals for 10 consecutive days each February using four to six traplines each consisting of nine <b>trap</b> <b>stations</b> with three snap <b>traps</b> at each <b>station.</b> We estimated relative abundance [catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) ], species richness, species diversity, and species evenness for all captures and captures just along the stream course. Within the SMZlplantation settings and three natural stands, we captured 1701 small mammals of 11 species in 114, 285 trapnights. Golden mice (Ochrotomys nuttalli), southern short-tailed shrews (Blarina carolinensis), and Perornyscus spp. comprised 88 % of all captures. Our study suggests that narrow (520 m wide) SMZs in managed pine forests tend to have higher small mammal abundance and species richness than wider SMZs. Additionally, species richness and CPUE was greater in SMZs within young, open canopy and thinned plantation...|$|R
