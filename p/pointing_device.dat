25|$|The WIMP {{style of}} {{interaction}} uses a virtual input device {{to represent the}} position of a <b>pointing</b> <b>device,</b> most often a mouse, and presents information organized in windows and represented with icons. Available commands are compiled together in menus, and actions are performed making gestures with the <b>pointing</b> <b>device.</b> A window manager facilitates the interactions between windows, applications, and the windowing system. The windowing system handles hardware devices such as pointing devices, graphics hardware, and positioning of the pointer.|$|E
25|$|The Xerox PARC user {{interface}} consisted of graphical {{elements such as}} windows, menus, radio buttons, and check boxes. The concept of icons was later introduced by David Canfield Smith, who had written a thesis on the subject {{under the guidance of}} Kay. The PARC {{user interface}} employs a <b>pointing</b> <b>device</b> along with a keyboard. These aspects can be emphasized by using the alternative term and acronym for windows, icons, menus, <b>pointing</b> <b>device</b> (WIMP). This effort culminated in the 1973 Xerox Alto, the first computer with a GUI, though the system never reached commercial production.|$|E
40|$|Since the {{introduction}} of graphical user interfaces (GUI), input control devices have {{become an integral part}} of desktop computing. When interfacing with GUI s, these input control devices have become the human s primary means of communicating with the computer. Although there have been a number of experiments conducted on <b>pointing</b> <b>devices</b> for desktop machine, there is little research on <b>pointing</b> <b>devices</b> for wearable computer technology. This is surprising because <b>pointing</b> <b>devices</b> are a major component of a wearable computer system, allowing the wearer to select and manipulate objects on the screen. The design of these <b>pointing</b> <b>devices</b> will have a major impact on the ease with which the operator can interact with information being displayed (Card, English, and Burr, 1978). As a result, this research is the first in a series to investigate design considerations for <b>pointing</b> <b>devices</b> and visual displays that will support wearable computer users. Twenty soldiers participated in an experiment using target acquisition software with five <b>pointing</b> <b>devices</b> and two visual displays. The findings of the research strongly support the use of a relative mode-pointing device with rotational characteristics (i. e. trackball or thumbwheel) over other designs. Furthermore, the results also suggest that there is littl...|$|R
5000|$|A {{wide variety}} of <b>pointing</b> <b>devices</b> are {{available}} to provide mouse functionality. Many keyboards include <b>pointing</b> <b>devices</b> such as a small trackball, touch pad, joy stick (Hulapoint), or pointing stick. Similar <b>pointing</b> <b>devices</b> are available as stand-alone modules and can be installed separately from the keyboard. In a lay-flat design, there is sufficient height in a 1U design to install a larger 1-1/2" [...] trackball and larger trackballs in the KVMs which are 2U in height. Some manufacturers have made provision for using a true mouse by providing a location for storage and a flat surface to use it on.|$|R
50|$|Prolonged use of laptops {{can cause}} {{repetitive}} strain injury because of their small, flat keyboard and trackpad <b>pointing</b> <b>devices,.</b> Usage of separate, external ergonomic keyboards and <b>pointing</b> <b>devices</b> is recommended to prevent injury when working {{for long periods of}} time; they can be connected to a laptop easily by USB or via a docking station. Some health standards require ergonomic keyboards at workplaces.|$|R
25|$|A {{computer}} mouse is a <b>pointing</b> <b>device</b> (hand control) that detects two-dimensional motion {{relative to a}} surface. This motion is typically translated into the motion of a pointer on a display, which allows a smooth control of the graphical user interface.|$|E
25|$|Classed {{as small}} {{form-factor}} PCs, Chromeboxes typically feature a power switch {{and a set}} of ports: local area network, USB, DVI-D, DisplayPort, and audio. As with Chromebooks, Chromeboxes employ solid-state memory and support Web applications, but require an external monitor, keyboard, and <b>pointing</b> <b>device.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{pointing}} stick is an isometric joystick {{operated by}} applied force {{and is used}} as a <b>pointing</b> <b>device</b> on laptop computers. It {{takes the form of a}} rubber cap located on top of the keyboard embedded between the 'G', 'H' and 'B' keys. The pointing stick was invented by American computer scientist Ted Selker in 1984.|$|E

25|$|In computing, a mouse is a <b>pointing</b> <b>device</b> that {{functions}} by detecting two-dimensional motion {{relative to}} its supporting surface. The mouse's motion typically translates into {{the motion of}} a pointer on a display, which allows for fine control of a Graphical User Interface. Douglas Engelbart invented the computer mouse at the Augmentation Research Center, funded by the Department of Defense's Advanced Research Projects Agency (now DARPA) in 1963. The first mouse was carved from wood and tracked motion via two wheels mounted on the bottom. Later on, a ball instead of two wheels was employed. The concept was soon overtaken by a modern and more technologically advanced optical mouse.|$|E
25|$|Arguably the {{greatest}} of these monuments is the bronze bas-relief that forms the Robert Gould Shaw Memorial on Boston Common, 1884–1897, which Saint-Gaudens labored on for 14 years; even after the public version had been unveiled, he continued with further versions. Two grand equestrian monuments to Civil War generals are outstanding: to General John A. Logan, atop a tumulus in Chicago, 1894–1897, and to William Tecumseh Sherman {{at the corner of}} Central Park in New York, 1892–1903, the first use of Robert Treat Paine's <b>pointing</b> <b>device</b> for the accurate mechanical enlargement of sculpture models. The depictions of the African-American soldiers on the Shaw memorial is noted as a rare example of true-to-life, non-derogatory, depictions of Afro-ancestral physical characteristics in 19th-century American art.|$|E
25|$|One {{example of}} a 2000s {{consumer}} 3D <b>pointing</b> <b>device</b> is the Wii Remote. While primarily a motion-sensing device (that is, it can determine its orientation and direction of movement), Wii Remote can also detect its spatial position by comparing the distance and position of the lights from the IR emitter using its integrated IR camera (since the nunchuk accessory lacks a camera, it can only tell its current heading and orientation). The obvious drawback to {{this approach is that}} it can only produce spatial coordinates while its camera can see the sensor bar. More accurate consumer devices have since been released, including the PlayStation Move, the Razer Hydra and the controllers part of the HTC Vive virtual reality system. All of these devices can accurately detect position and orientation in 3D space regardless of angle relative to the sensor station.|$|E
40|$|Remote {{pointing}} is {{an interaction}} style for presentation systems, interactive TV, and other systems where the user is positioned an appreciable {{distance from the}} display. A variety of technologies and interaction techniques exist for remote pointing. This paper presents an empirical evaluation and comparison of two remote <b>pointing</b> <b>devices.</b> A standard mouse {{is used as a}} baseline condition. Using the ISO metric throughput (calculated from users' speed and accuracy in completing tasks) as the criterion, the two remote <b>pointing</b> <b>devices</b> performed poorly, demonstrating 32 % and 65 % worse performance than the mouse. Qualitatively, users indicated a strong preference for the mouse over the remote <b>pointing</b> <b>devices.</b> Implications for the design of present and future systems for remote pointing are discussed...|$|R

40|$|We {{have been}} proposing "Icon Throwing" {{as a new}} {{primitive}} for GUI operations. In previous papers, we have used mice as <b>pointing</b> <b>devices</b> for performance measurement, {{and the results were}} very positive. We have also found that the task performance is strongly affected by the various aspects of <b>pointing</b> <b>devices.</b> Recently, LCD tablets that use stylus pens are getting popular as <b>pointing</b> <b>devices,</b> especially for mobile PCs; thus task performance on this kind of devices are becoming important. In this paper, we have conducted an experiment to compare the performance of "Icon Throwing" operation between a mouse and a stylus pen in tablet PC, using eight subjects. As the result, a stylus pen outperformed a mouse in average task operation time, while keeping accuracy (error ratio) at the same level...|$|R
25|$|Point-and-click {{adventure}} {{games are}} those where the player typically controls their character through a point-and-click interface {{using a computer}} mouse or similar <b>pointing</b> <b>device,</b> though additional control schemes may also be available. The player clicks to move their character around, interact with non-player characters, often initiating conversation trees with them, examine objects in the game's settings or with their character's item inventory. Many point-and-click games would include a list of on-screen verbs to describe specific actions {{in the manner of}} a text adventure, but newer games have used more context-sensitive user interface elements to reduce or eliminate this approach. Often, these games come down to collecting items for the character's inventory, and figuring where is the right time to use that item; the player would need to use clues from the visual elements of the game, descriptions of the various items, and dialogue from other characters to figure this out. Later games developed by Sierra Online including the King's Quest games, and nearly all of the LucasArts adventure games, are point-and-click based games.|$|E
500|$|The Wii {{introduced}} the Wii Remote controller, {{which can be}} used as a handheld <b>pointing</b> <b>device</b> and which detects movement in three dimensions. Another notable feature of the console is the now defunct WiiConnect24, which enabled it to receive messages and updates over the Internet while in standby mode. Like other seventh-generation consoles, it features a game download service, called [...] "Virtual Console", which features emulated games from past systems.|$|E
500|$|The PowerBook100 is a {{portable}} subnotebook personal computer that was [...] designed and manufactured by Sony for Apple Computer and introduced on October 21, 1991, at the COMDEX computer expo in Las Vegas, Nevada. Priced at US$2,300, the PowerBook100 was the low-end {{model of the}} first three simultaneously released PowerBooks. Its CPU and overall speed closely resembled those of its predecessor, the Macintosh Portable. It had a Motorola 68000 16-megahertz (MHz) processor, 2-8megabytes (MB) of memory, a [...] monochrome backlit liquid crystal display (LCD) with 640400pixel resolution, and the System 7.0.1 operating system. It did not have a built-in floppy disk drive and was noted for its unique compact design that placed a trackball <b>pointing</b> <b>device</b> in front of the keyboard for ease of use.|$|E

2500|$|Users {{were often}} {{presented}} {{the option to}} purchase a pointing stick, touchpad, or trackball. [...] Combinations of the devices were common, though touchpads and trackballs were rarely included together. Since the early 2000s, touchpads have become the dominant laptop <b>pointing</b> <b>device</b> as most laptops produced during this period beyond include only touchpads, displacing the pointing stick.|$|E

2500|$|A {{touchpad}} or trackpad is a <b>pointing</b> <b>device</b> {{featuring a}} tactile sensor, a specialized surface that can translate the motion and {{position of a}} user's fingers to a relative position on the operating system that is made output to the screen. [...] Touchpads are a common feature of laptop computers, and are also used {{as a substitute for}} a mouse where desk space is scarce. Because they vary in size, they can also be found on personal digital assistants (PDAs) and some portable media players. Wireless touchpads are also available as detached accessories.|$|E
2500|$|A {{touchpad}} {{was first}} developed for Psion's MC 200/400/600/WORD Series in 1989. Olivetti and Triumph-Adler introduced the first laptops with touchpad in 1992.Cirque introduced the first widely available touchpad, branded as GlidePoint, in 1994. [...] Apple Inc introduced touchpads {{to the modern}} laptop in the PowerBook series in 1994, using Cirque’s GlidePoint technology; later PowerBooks and MacBooks would use Apple-developed trackpads. Another early adopter of the GlidePoint <b>pointing</b> <b>device</b> was Sharp. [...] Later, Synaptics introduced their touchpad into the marketplace, branded the TouchPad. Epson was an early adopter of this product.|$|E
2500|$|The trackball, {{a related}} <b>pointing</b> <b>device,</b> {{was invented in}} 1946 by Ralph Benjamin {{as part of a}} post-World War II-era fire-control radar {{plotting}} system called Comprehensive Display System (CDS). Benjamin was then working for the British Royal Navy Scientific Service. Benjamin's project used analog computers to calculate the future position of target aircraft based on several initial input points provided by a user with a joystick. Benjamin felt that a more elegant input device was needed and invented what they called a [...] "roller ball" [...] for this purpose.|$|E
40|$|Pointing {{sticks and}} touchpads {{are the leading}} {{integrated}} <b>pointing</b> <b>devices</b> for portable computers. Yet research shows that users are frustrated with these devices. With WIMP interface firmly entrenched and mobile computer use drastically rising, attention must {{be paid to the}} virtues and limitations of integrated <b>pointing</b> <b>devices.</b> This article offers a mixture of qualitative and quantitative findings that clarify the issues and the design factors that affect performance and satisfaction with integrated <b>pointing</b> <b>devices.</b> Findings indicate that the rate-control pointing stick is a more efficient and preferred pointer to the position-control touchpad device, but that other design factors such as palm rest size, LCD technology differences, and device implementation differences might account for more variance in pointer effectiveness and user satisfaction than the device type itself. Contradictory findings in the recent literature are explained in terms of differences among these other factors. Practitioner guidelines for these technologies are also discussed...|$|R
