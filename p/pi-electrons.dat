Stabilizing factors are increased delocalization of <b>pi-electrons</b> from one ring {{to the other and}} the one that tips the balance is a hydrogen - hydrogen bond between the ortho hydrogens. [...] The hydrogen bond is not without its critics. According to one the relative stability of phenanthrene compared to its isomers can be adequately explained by comparing resonance stabilizations.

The following descriptors were used in the modeling procedure: electron affinities, Mickel <b>pi-electron</b> energies, <b>pi-electron</b> energies of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals, the number of Kekule structures and the vertex-connectivity index. All models with one, two or three descriptors were considered. It was found that the <b>pi-electron</b> energies of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals E(LUMO) were participating in all the best models. A single-descriptor model based on E(LUMO) was selected for testing. The statistical parameters obtained for the test set are comparable to those of the training set.

5000|$|Undoped {{conjugated}} polymers {{state are}} semiconductors or insulators. In such compounds, the energy gap can be > 2 eV, which {{is too great}} for thermally activated conduction. Therefore, undoped conjugated polymers, such as polythiophenes, polyacetylenes only have a low electrical conductivity of around 10−10 to 10−8 S/cm. Even at a very low level of doping (< 1%), electrical conductivity increases several orders of magnitude up to values of around 0.1 S/cm. Subsequent doping of the conducting polymers {{will result in a}} saturation of the conductivity at values around 0.1-10 kS/cm for different polymers. Highest values reported up to now are for the conductivity of stretch oriented polyacetylene with confirmed values of about 80 kS/cm. Although the <b>pi-electrons</b> in polyactetylene are delocalized along the chain, pristine polyacetylene is not a metal. Polyacetylene has alternating single and double bonds which have lengths of 1.44 and 1.36 Å, respectively. Upon doping, the bond alteration is diminished in conductivity increases.

In the Wannier representation, the electronic hopping energies and the energy gap of the tubes (9, 0) and (9, 9) are calculated. Our results show that the band gap of the tubes increases in direct ratio with the scattering coefficients of sigma-orbitals and this scattering is able to enhance the localization of <b>pi-electrons...</b>|$|E

The electron fluid was taken to comprise many electron species, each characterized by a different effective mass, which {{takes into account the}} interaction with the nanotube ion lattice. A linear transport model for the <b>pi-electrons</b> was derived from the hydrodynamic equations. A transmission line model was eventually formulated to describe the propagation of an electric signal along a single-wall carbon nanotube of arbitrary chirality.

Distinct isomers of acyclic hydrocarbons (polyenes) {{are now under}} focus. The relevant total <b>pi-electron</b> energies (E) are expressed {{in the form of}} power series containing members (E_(k)) of even orders (k= 0, 2, 4, [...] .) with respect to the averaged resonance parameter of initially-single (C-C) bonds. Terms to within the sixth order (k= 6) inclusive are shown to be of importance for discrimination between similar isomers. In this connection, missing expressions for corrections E_(6) are originally derived. Conjugated paths of various lengths (i. e. linear chains consisting of C=C and C-C bonds alternately) are shown {{to be the most important}} (but not the only) fragments contributing to stabilization of any acyclic <b>pi-electron</b> system. Again, new types of fragments (substructures) are revealed (viz. the so-called composite conjugated paths) that contribute to destabilization of the system concerned. As a result, formation of the total energy of an acyclic <b>pi-electron</b> system is concluded to be governed by an interplay between stabilizing and destabilizing factors. Accordingly, the perturbative approach applied offers us an extension of the concept of conjugated paths.

Bibliography: leaves [129]- 136. v, 136, [1] leaves diagrs., tablesRecently, Belonovskaya(35) {{reported}} that anthracene and dibenzopyrene retarded the thermal polymerization of styrene, whereas naphthalene, phenanthrene, pyrene and chrysene had no effect. Among these: hydrocarbons J only dibenzopyrene is carcinogenic and possesses fairly high <b>pi-electron</b> density at its K-region. This {{would appear to}} bear out the expectation of seeking a correlation between carcinogenicity and free radical reactivity. However, the observed reactivity of anthracene destroys the possibility of seeking such a correlation as this hydrocarbon is non-carcinogenic and possesses no K-region. As will be seen later from our studies, several other non-carcinogenic hydrocarbons also retarded the polymerization of styrene. It can be implied that this chemical reactivity does not constitute a basis for differentiation between carcinogens and non-carcinogens. Thus, no correlation between carcinogenicity and their reactivity towards free radicals may be expected. Similar conclusions- may also {{be drawn from the}} studies of Szwarc(31) and Kooyman(32). However, a common feature among these compounds is that those hydrocarbons which possess a high <b>pi-electron</b> density in localized regions (K or L-regions), were also found to be reactive towards free radicals:, and as: will be seen later a correlation does exist between the <b>pi-electron</b> density of these regions and their chemical reactivity.
