In this study, we report that PTK 7 interacts with β-catenin in a yeast two-hybrid assay and mammalian cells. PTK 7 -deficient cells exhibit weakened β-catenin/T-cell factor transcriptional activity on Wnt 3 a stimulation. Furthermore, Xenopus PTK 7 {{is required for the}} formation of Spemann's organizer and for Siamois promoter activation, events that require β-catenin transcriptional activity. Using epistatic assays, we demonstrate that PTK 7 functions upstream from glycogen synthase kinase 3. Taken together, our data reveal a new and conserved role for PTK 7 in the Wnt canonical signalling pathway...|$|E
40|$|Although cell {{movements}} are vital for establishing the normal architecture of embryos, {{it is unclear}} how these {{movements are}} regulated during development in vertebrates. Inhibition of Xenopus Dishevelled (Xdsh) function disrupts convergent extension movements of cells during gastrulation, but the mechanism of this effect is unclear, as cell fates are not affected. In Drosophila, Dishevelled controls both cell fate and cell polarity but whether Dishevelled is involved in controlling cell polarity in vertebrate embryos has not been investigated. Here we show, using time-lapse confocal microscopy, that the failure of cells lacking Xdsh function to undergo convergent extension results from defects in cell polarity. Furthermore, Xdsh mutations that inhibit convergent extension correspond to mutations in Drosophila Dishevelled that selectively perturb planar cell polarity. Finally, the localization of Xdsh at the membrane of normal dorsal mesodermal cells is consistent with Xdsh controlling cell polarity. Our results show that polarized cell behaviour is essential for convergent extension and is controlled by vertebrate Dishevelled. Thus, a vertebrate equivalent of the Drosophila planar cell <b>polarity</b> <b>signalling</b> cascade may be required for normal gastrulation...|$|E
40|$|AbstractDuring planar {{polarity}} patterning of the Drosophila wing, a “core” {{group of}} planar polarity genes {{has been identified}} which acts downstream of global polarity cues to locally coordinate cell polarity and specify trichome production at distal cell edges. These genes encode protein products that assemble into asymmetric apicolateral complexes that straddle the proximodistal junctional region between adjacent cells. We have carried out detailed genetic analysis experiments, analysing the requirements of each complex component for planar polarity patterning. We find that the three transmembrane proteins {{at the core of}} the complex, Frizzled, Strabismus and Flamingo, are required earliest in development and are the only components needed for intercellular <b>polarity</b> <b>signalling.</b> Notably, cells that lack both Frizzled and Strabismus are unable to signal, revealing an absolute requirement for both proteins in cell–cell communication. In contrast the cytoplasmic components Dishevelled, Prickle and Diego are not needed for intercellular communication. These factors contribute to the cell–cell propagation of polarity, most likely by promotion of intracellular asymmetry. Interestingly, both local polarity propagation and trichome placement occur normally in mutant backgrounds where asymmetry of polarity protein distribution is undetectable, suggesting such asymmetry is not an absolute requirement for any of the functions of the core complex...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWnt {{signaling}} via the Frizzled (Fz) receptor controls cell polarity {{and movement}} during development, but the molecular nature of Wnt/Fz <b>polarity</b> <b>signal</b> transduction remains poorly defined. Here {{we report that}} in human cells and during Xenopus embryogenesis, Wnt/Fz signaling activates the small GTPase Rho, a key regulator of cytoskeleton architecture. Wnt/Fz activation of Rho requires the cytoplasmic protein Dishevelled (Dvl) and a novel Formin homology protein Daam 1. Daam 1 binds to both Dvl and Rho, and mediates Wnt-induced Dvl-Rho complex formation. Inhibition or depletion of Daam 1 prevents Wnt/Fz activation of Rho and of Xenopus gastrulation, but not of β-catenin signaling.

40|$|While many cell {{types are}} able to {{generate}} cellular movement through {{the action of the}} actomyosin cytoskeleton alone, microtubules are important for establishing and maintaining polarity, regulating the force-generating machinery and cell adhesion. Therefore, directionally persistent cell migration and neuronal pathfinding often require microtubules. The microtubule cytoskeleton itself is organised asymmetrically to allow differential regulation of the migration machinery at the front and the rear of the cell. Microtubules position organelles such as the nucleus, the centrosome and the Golgi. Transport of mRNAs, vesicles, receptors and signalling components to the cell edges occurs along microtubules. These cargoes in turn support force generation by the actin cytoskeleton, act as a source of membrane lipids and regulate <b>polarity</b> <b>signalling,</b> adhesion, cell-cell communication and chemical gradient sensing. Microtubules themselves and especially the dynamic plus ends act as signalling platforms to control adhesion turnover and membrane protrusion. The rapid turnover of microtubules allows cells to quickly adapt to extracellular signals and change migration direction in response to guidance cues. Microtubule dynamics and organisation are in turn controlled by cortical cues. These feedback mechanisms ensure robustness and adaptation to environmental influences. Given the fundamental importance of cell migration for embryonic development, the immune system and wound healing, impaired microtubule function leads to birth defects and diseases. Likewise, drugs targeting microtubules are routinely used to prevent excessive cell migration in cancer metastasis and chronic inflammatory diseases...|$|E
40|$|Background : Epidemiological studies {{indicate}} a substantial excess familial recurrence of non-syndromic Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), implicating genetic factors that remain largely unknown. The Rho induced kinase 1 gene (ROCK 1) {{is a key}} component of the planar cell <b>polarity</b> <b>signalling</b> pathway, which {{plays an important role in}} normal cardiac development. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of genetic variation in ROCK 1 on the risk of TOF. Results : ROCK 1 was sequenced in a discovery cohort of 93 non-syndromic TOF probands to identify rare variants. TagSNPs were selected to capture commoner variation in ROCK 1. Novel variants and TagSNPs were genotyped in a discovery cohort of 458 TOF cases and 1331 healthy controls, and positive findings were replicated in a further 209 TOF cases and 1290 healthy controls. Association between genotypes and TOF was assessed using LAMP. A rare SNP (c. 807 C[*]>[*]T; rs 56085230) discovered by sequencing was associated with TOF risk (p[*]=[*] 0. 006) in the discovery cohort. The variant was also significantly associated with the risk of TOF in the replication cohort (p[*]=[*] 0. 018). In the combined cohorts the odds ratio for TOF was 2. 61 (95 % CI 1. 58 - 4. 30); p[*] − 5). The minor allele frequency of rs 288979 in the controls was 0. 043, and the variant accounted for 11 % of the PAR of TOF. These association signals were independent of each other, providing additional internal validation of our result. Conclusions : Low frequency intermediate penetrance (LFIP) variants in the ROCK 1 gene predispose to the risk of TOF. </p...|$|E
40|$|Protein Kinase C iota (PKCɩ) is a serine/threonine kinase that is {{involved}} in epithelial polarity and malignancy where polarity is typically abrogated. The aim of this thesis was to characterise the role of PKCɩ in oncogenic signaling {{in the context of}} polarity loss. This work set out to identify activators, binding partners and downstream effectors of PKCɩ with a view to informing rational therapeutic design. Madin Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells, grown as polarised cysts containing a central lumen in Matrigel, developed a multiple-lumen phenotype on perturbation of PKCɩ, suggesting a threshold requirement for normal lumenogenesis. When transfected with oncogenic Ras, MDCK cells formed large spheres lacking a lumen and polarity. Upon PKCɩ inhibition with siRNA or small molecules, polarity was partially rescued indicating that PKCɩ lies downstream of Ras in this polarity loss pathway. Structural studies have enabled two distinct approaches to identify effectors of PKCɩ. A novel protein-protein interaction motif (RIPR) within PKCɩ was identified and shown here to be responsible for interaction with a subset of target proteins, including LLGL 2. MDCK cysts expressing a PKCɩ mutated in this motif developed a multiple-lumen phenotype. In a second approach, use was made of an inhibitor bound complex of PKCɩ to design a drug insensitive mutant. Expression of the resistant mutant in HEK 293 cells led to resistance to inhibitor induced dephosphorylation of LLGL 2 and protected MDCK cells from developing inhibitor induced multiple lumens and loss of polarity. This tool has been used to screen for PKCɩ substrates. In summary, PKCɩ lies downstream of H-Ras in MDCK <b>polarity</b> <b>signalling.</b> The site at which PKCɩ binds LLGL 2 is defined and shown to contribute to normal lumenogenesis. A drug insensitive PKCɩ mutant is described that can be utilised for substrate and biomarker identification...|$|E
40|$|In C. elegans, a Wnt/WG-like {{signaling}} pathway down-regulates the TCF/LEF-related protein, POP- 1, to specify posterior cell fates.

In Caenorhabditis elegans embryos, posterior polarity is induced by an unknown centrosome-dependent signal.

G. White. 2000. Dev. Biol. 222 : 55 – 70; Wallenfang, M. R., and G. Seydoux. 2000. Nature. 408 : 89 – 92; Hamill, D. R., A. F. Severson, J. C. Carter, and B. Bowerman. 2002. Dev. Cell. 3 : 673 – 684), recent work involving RNA interference knockdown of tubulin led to the conclusion that centrosomes induce polarity independently of microtubules (Cowan, C. R., and A. A.

40|$|Progressive {{development}} of pathology in neuroanatomically connected brain regions {{is a common}} feature of many neurodegenerative diseases. The spread of disease pathology is suggested {{to be dependent on}} the transmissibility of disease-associated proteins, particularly soluble aggregates of misfolded proteins. Emerging evidence suggests that many disease-associated proteins such as α-synuclein (aSyn) and tau, in certain misfolded and aggregated states convert from physiologically normal proteins into forms that lead to progression of disease pathology in a template-dependent manner, which is also known as seeding. The propagation and the proteinopathy have been suggested to occur via cell-to-cell transmission. The exact mechanisms involved in the seeding and spreading process are incompletely understood. In this thesis work, three critical steps of the seeding pathway (a process involves multiple steps), the intracellular aggregation, cellular release and uptake of aSyn and tau, were carefully studied primarily via a newly developed platform based on protein-fragment complementation assay. The main findings of this thesis are: a) Prolyl oligopeptidase (PREP) is a serine peptidase that was previously known to accelerate the process of aSyn aggregation and suppress autophagy clearance in cells and transgenic aSyn mice. The results of this thesis show that PREP directly interacts with aSyn in neuro 2 A cells and cell-free environment, and enhances aSyn dimerization, which is an early event in aSyn aggregation pathway. In addition, the PREP-mediated aSyn dimerization can be antagonized by KYP- 2047, a small-molecule PREP inhibitor. b) Late-onset Alzheimer s disease (LOAD) susceptibility genes affect the individual risk of developing Alzheimer s disease, {{which is one of the}} common tauopathies. In this work, the functional connection between selected LOAD susceptibility genes and cell-to-cell transmission of tau was studied in vitro. We observed that RNAi knockdown of CD 2 AP and FRMD 4 A reduced tau secretion, and knockdown of APOE reduced tau uptake in HEK 293 T cells. Further mechanistic studies revealed that FRMD 4 A modulates tau secretion via the FRMD 4 A-cytohesin-Arf 6 signalling pathway and the Par 6 /aPKC <b>polarity</b> <b>signalling</b> complex. This data, for the first time, demonstrates a functional connection between LOAD risk genes and cell-to-cell propagation of tau. c) Following internalization, extracellular, hyperphosphorylated tau was found to be recruited to stress granules, transient non-membraneous cytosolic structures composed of RNA and self-aggregating RNA-binding proteins. Tau recruitment was dependent on TIA- 1, an RNA-binding stress granule protein. Importantly, the stress granules induced by and containing internalized tau were resistant to normal clearance and associated with increased sensitivity of cells to other stresses. This data describe a previously unrecognized mechanism and pathological consequence of cell-to-cell propagation of tau-mediated by stress granules, which have previously been associated with the pathophysiology of various neurodegenerative diseases. Overall, the work described in this thesis provides several novel findings that improve our understanding of cellular mechanisms underlying the development and spreading of aSyn and tau-related neurodegenerative pathologies. These pieces of knowledge may be potential avenues towards the {{development of}} crucial therapeutics against aSyn and tau-related neurodegenerative diseases.

Despite their important physiological functions and implication in disease, the molecular mechanisms that dictate {{the formation of}} these projections along the anterior-posterior axis remain unknown. Here we reveal a novel requirement for Wnt/planar cell <b>polarity</b> <b>signaling</b> in the anterior-posterior organization of the monoaminergic system. We find that 5 -HT and mdDA axons express the core planar cell polarity components Frizzled 3, Celsr 3, and Vangl 2. In addition, monoaminergic projections show anterior-posterior guidance defects in Frizzled 3, Celsr 3, and Vangl 2 mutant mice. The only known ligands for planar cell <b>polarity</b> <b>signaling</b> are Wnt proteins. In culture, Wnt 5 a attracts 5 -HT but repels mdDA axons, and Wnt 7 b attracts mdDA axons. However, mdDA axons from Frizzled 3 mutant mice are unresponsive to Wnt 5 a and Wnt 7 b. Both Wnts are expressed in gradients along the anterior-posterior axis, consistent with their role as directional cues. Finally, Wnt 5 a mutants show transient anterior-posterior guidance defects in mdDA projections. Furthermore, we observe during development that the cell bodies of migrating descending 5 -HT neurons eventually reorient along the direction of their axons. In Frizzled 3 mutants, many 5 -HT and mdDA neuron cell bodies are oriented abnormally along the direction of their aberrant axon projections.

Using two three-dimensional culture models of mammary epithelial cells and an orthotopic mouse model of breast cancer, we reveal that Par 6 signaling, which is regulated directly by TGFβ, {{plays a role}} in breast cancer metastasis. Interference with Par 6 signaling blocked TGFβ-dependent loss of polarity in acini-like structures formed by non-transformed mammary cells grown in three-dimensional structures and suppressed the protrusive morphology of mesenchymal-like invasive mammary tumor cells without rescuing E-cadherin expression. Moreover, blockade of Par 6 signaling in an in vivo orthotopic model of metastatic breast cancer induced the formation of ZO- 1 -positive epithelium-like structures in the primary tumor and suppressed metastasis to the lungs. Analysis of the pathway in tissue microarrays of human breast tumors further revealed that Par 6 activation correlated with markers of the basal carcinoma subtype in BRCA 1 -associated tumors.

The preference for binding of oriented contours having same contrast polarity, over binding of opposite polarity ones (CP rule), has been used to explain several visual illusions.

Experi- ment 1 showed that the effect was indeed present only when the CP rule was satisfied, and found it to be stronger when the luminance contrast values of the elements are more similar. In experi- ment 2 the illusion was reported only with relatable edges, and its strength was modulated by the degree of relatability. The CP-rule effectiveness, thus, seems to depend on good continuation. The intensity of contrast <b>polarity</b> <b>signals</b> propagating from an oriented contour might be the less intense, the more its direction deviates from linearity. In experiment 3 we estimated the distance threshold and found it to be smaller than the one found for other illusions, arising with collinear fragments.

We show that msn acts in the Frizzled (Fz) mediated epithelial planar <b>polarity</b> (EPP) <b>signaling</b> pathway in eyes and wings. Both msn loss- and gain-of-function result in defective ommatidial polarity and wing hair formation. Genetic and biochemical analyses indicate that msn acts downstream of fz and dishevelled (dsh) in the planar polarity pathway, and thus implicates an STE 20 -like kinase in Fz/Dsh-mediated signaling. This demonstrates that seven-pass transmembrane receptors can signal via members of the STE 20 kinase family in higher eukaryotes. We also show that Msn acts in EPP signaling through the JNK (Jun-N-terminal kinase) module as it does in dorsal closure. Although at the level of Fz/Dsh there is no apparent redundancy in this pathway, the downstream effector JNK/MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) module is redundant in planar polarity generation.

The oscillations with increments are 180 degrees out of phase with those for decrements. The oscillations, much larger than the measurement error, appear to relate to the weighting function of the spatial-frequency-tuned channel detecting the broad- band signals. The ripples disappear with step maskers and become much smaller at durations below 25 ms, implying either that the site of masking has changed or that the weighting function and hence spatial-frequency tuning is slow to develop...|$|R
40|$|In modern {{sequential}} VLSI designs, clock tree {{plays an}} important role in synchronizing different components in a chip. To reduce peak current and power/ground noises caused by clock network, assigning different <b>signal</b> <b>polarities</b> to clock buffers is proposed in previous work. Although peak current and power/ground noises are minimized by <b>signal</b> <b>polarities</b> assignment, an assignment without timing information may increase the clock skew significantly. As a result, a timing-aware <b>signal</b> <b>polarities</b> assigning technique is necessary. In this paper, we propose a novel <b>signal</b> <b>polarities</b> assigning technique which can not only reduce peak current and power/ground noises simultaneously but also render the clock skew in control. The experimental result shows that the clock skew produced by our algorithm is 94 % of original clock skew in average while the clock skews produced by three algorithms (Partition, MST, Matching) [5] are 235 %, 272 %, and 283 %, respectively. Moreover, our algorithm is as efficient as the three algorithms of [5] in reducing peak current and power/ground noises. I...|$|R
