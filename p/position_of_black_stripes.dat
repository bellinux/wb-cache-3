25|$|From {{the second}} instar on, the spiderlings have a brownish-gray cephaIothorax and limbs, {{and a red}} abdomen with {{markings}} limited to the posterior portion. These consist of a pair <b>of</b> <b>black</b> <b>stripes,</b> each bearing two conspicuous white dots, separated by a light region. The light region may be gray, white, or even golden; immediately anterior to the <b>black</b> <b>stripes</b> it is enlarged into a conspicuous light dot. While the abdomen of very young spiderlings appears bronze, the red color of the abdomen is striking in later instars. In one of the later instars, the 5th or perhaps the 6th, a red cap appears in the eye region, but this marking disappears in the following molt. The light basal band and side bands of the adult are also present in immature spiders, and, in the two instars proceeding maturity, the chelicerae are also iridescent.|$|R

5000|$|Most {{prominent}} black lesbian feminists were writers {{rather than}} scholars and expressed {{their position in}} literary way.

[...] Apart from that, the <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>black</b> lesbian feminists was expressed in their interviews and public speeches. As such, Audre Lorde in her interview published in American Poetry Review in1980 states that a [...] "true feminist deals out of a lesbian consciousness {{whether or not she}} ever sleeps with women" [...] as well as that all black women whether they admit it or not are lesbians, because they are [...] "raised in the remnants of a basically matriarchal society" [...] even they are still oppressed by patriarchy.|$|R
50|$|The rummy-nose tetra is a torpedo-shaped fish, whose {{basal body}} colour is a {{translucent}} silvery colour suffused in some specimens with a greenish tint: iridescent green scales are frequently seen adorning the fish {{at the point}} where the fontanel (a part of the head roughly corresponding to the forehead in humans) meets the body. The fins are hyaline, with the exception of the tail fin, this fin being adorned with black and white horizontal stripes, variable in number, but usually comprising one central <b>black</b> <b>stripe</b> in the central portion of the tail fin, with two horizontal <b>black</b> <b>stripes</b> upon each caudal fin lobe, the spaces between the stripes being white, the total count <b>of</b> <b>black</b> <b>stripes</b> being five. The head is a deep red colour, iridescent in lustre, with the red continuing into the iris of the eye, and some red colouration extends beyond the operculum or gill plate into the anteriormost section of the body proper. Some specimens classified as Hemigrammus rhodostomus possess three <b>black</b> tail <b>stripes</b> instead <b>of</b> five, and some specimens classified as Petitella georgiae have a <b>black</b> <b>stripe</b> in the caudal peduncle extending forwards into the body, surmounted above by a thin iridescent gold line: however, whether these features are reliable determinants of species identity has yet to be fully ascertained.|$|R

25|$|The tallit gadol is {{typically}} either all white, white with <b>black</b> <b>stripes,</b> white with blue stripes, or white with twelve-colored stripes. The all-white and black-and-white varieties {{have traditionally been}} the most common, with the blue-and-white variety, in the past {{said to be in}} remembrance of the blue thread or tekhelet, becoming increasingly prevalent in recent years among non-Orthodox Jews on account of the association of blue and white with the State of Israel. The all-white variety is customary among Sepharadic communities, whereas among Ashkenazic communities the tendency is toward white tallitot with <b>black</b> <b>stripes.</b> One explanation for the significance <b>of</b> the <b>black</b> <b>stripes</b> is that their black color symbolizes the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem and the exile of the Jews from the land of Israel.|$|R

5000|$|A special Spanish-market model {{introduced}} in April 1970 was the [...] DIN 1000 GT, {{which had a}} milder version of the 1204 cc engine as found in the 1200 Coupé. This engine also powered the more luxurious 1000 Special (from 1972). In the spring of 1971 this received twin carburators and became the [...] "1000 Rallye GT", with power increased to [...] SAE. It had twin <b>black</b> <b>stripes</b> at the very rear and other sporting equipment. This version was discontinued in 1972, essentially being replaced by the 1000 Special. The more powerful French-built Simca 1000 Rallye models were not available in the Spanish market, but in February 1976 the Spanish-built Simca 1000 Rallye appeared. This has a single carburated version of the 1294 cc engine with , making it considerably less powerful than its French contemporaries. It also did not benefit from disc brakes all around.

Between 1921 and 1939 the white-red-white flag was used by the Belarusian national movement in West Belarus (part of the Second Polish Republic), both by political organizations like the Belarusian Peasants' and Workers' Union or the Belarusian Christian Democracy, and non-political organizations like the Belarusian Schools Society. The flag was also used by the Belarusian Special Battalion in the army of the Republic of Lithuania. After the invasion of Poland and the annexation of modern-day West Belarus in 1939 the flag was forbidden by the Soviet administration in the newly acquired territories as well.|$|R
