5|$|<b>Payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>dividends</b> to {{shareholders}} began in 1792, {{and over the}} next five years, tolls raised an average of £893 per year and the dividend was 3.1 per cent. At this time, George Wyndham, 3rd Earl of Egremont was buying shares and having obtained one third of them, he became chairman of the company. He then stopped the <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>dividends</b> so that the borrowed capital could be paid off more quickly. Apart from an interim payment in 1821, dividends were not reinstated until 1830. In the 1790s Wyndham was responsible for the canalisation of the River Rother which joins the Arun at Stopham, and he also promoted the Wey and Arun Canal, which was seen {{as part of a larger}} scheme to link London to Portsmouth, an idea which had been contemplated several times since 1641. He chaired a meeting held at Guildford on 1 June 1811, at which it was decided to press ahead with the canal, and put up £20,000 of the initial £90,500 estimated cost. The canal opened in September 1816, but the estimated 100,000 tons of traffic passing between London and the dockyards at Portsmouth, and the 30,000 tons of local traffic, were far too optimistic, with actual traffic averaging around 15,000 tons per year throughout its life.|$|E

40|$|Dividend {{policy is}} the set of {{guidelines}} a company uses to decide how much of its earnings it will pay out to shareholders. When a company earns profits from operations, management can do {{one of two things}} with those profits. It can choose to retain them - essentially reinvesting them into the company with the hope of creating more profits and thus further stock appreciation. The alternative is to distribute a portion of the profits to shareholders in the form <b>of</b> <b>dividends.</b> The present paper highlight different approaches <b>of</b> <b>dividend</b> policy which are residual, hybrid and stability dividend approach. Companies using the residual dividend policy choose to rely on internally generated equity to finance any new projects. As a result, dividend payments can come out of the residual or leftover equity only after all project capital requirements are met. The fluctuation <b>of</b> <b>dividends</b> created by the residual policy significantly contrasts with the certainty <b>of</b> the <b>dividend</b> stability policy. With the stability policy, quarterly dividends are set at a fraction of yearly earnings. This policy reduces uncertainty for investors and provides them with income. Using the hybrid approach; companies tend to view the debt/equity ratio as a long-term rather than a short-term goal. In this paper cash dividend and procedure for <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>dividend</b> explained. A cash dividend is money paid to stockholders, normally out of the corporation's current earnings or accumulated profits. Not all companies pay a dividend. Usually, the board of directors determines. Steps followed in the <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>dividend</b> is- Ex-dividend date, declaration date, holder <b>of</b> record date, <b>payment</b> date...|$|R
50|$|Equity {{method in}} {{accounting}} {{is the process}} of treating investments in associate companies. Equity accounting is usually applied where an investor entity holds 20-50% of the voting stock of the associate company. The investor records such investments as an asset on its balance sheet. The investor's proportional share of the associate company's net income increases the investment (and a net loss decreases the investment), and proportional <b>payments</b> <b>of</b> <b>dividends</b> decrease it. In the investor’s income statement, the proportional share of the investor’s net income or net loss is reported as a single-line item.|$|R
