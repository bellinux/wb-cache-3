40|$|Managing {{the risk}} <b>of</b> {{changing}} <b>prices</b> <b>of</b> <b>gold</b> {{is central to}} the business strategy of American Barrick Resources Corp., one of North America's largest and most successful gold-mining firms. The case contrasts this firm's hedging policies with those of its rivals that do not hedge and details the wide range <b>of</b> hedging products (<b>gold</b> loans, forwards, options, spot deferred contracts) used to manage price risk. In 1992 the management of American Barrick is pleasantly surprised by unexpected new gold finds, but this new production places demands on the firm's hedging program and tests the firm's commitment to hedging when <b>prices</b> <b>of</b> <b>gold</b> and <b>of</b> many hedging vehicles are unattractive...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between {{the value of the dollar}} and the <b>prices</b> <b>of</b> two commodities, <b>gold</b> and oil. Granger causality is used on monthly data from January of 1970 through July of 2008. The empirical results show that the hypothesis that there is no causal relation between the value of the dollar and the <b>prices</b> <b>of</b> <b>gold</b> and oil is not supported by the evidence. There are causal relations between each <b>of</b> the <b>prices,</b> and there is a negative relation between the value of the dollar and the <b>price</b> <b>of</b> each of the commodities, as predicted by standard economic theory. Also consistent with the predictions of classical economic theory is that there is a positive statistical association between the <b>prices</b> <b>of</b> <b>gold</b> and oil. The implication is that gold and oil represent safe havens from fluctuations in the value of the dollar. Dollar, Gold, Oil, Exchange Rates, Commodity Prices, Granger Causality...|$|R
5|$|On June 15, 1928, Horch {{arranged}} for the American Bond and Mortgage Company to underwrite a bond of $1,925,000 to cover costs. The bonds, which were linked to the <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>gold,</b> were certificates held under a trust mortgage with the Chatham Phenix National Bank and Trust Company.

5|$|With the {{indigenous}} groups {{closer to the}} Caribbean Coast, the people traded highly valuable sea snails. Ironically, the sea snails were worth more than the <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>gold</b> to the Muisca, due to the distance from their location far inland high in the Andes. The skilled goldworking of the Muisca {{formed the basis for}} the legend of El Dorado that became widespread among the Spanish conquistadors; this eventually drew them into the heart of Colombia—an ill-fated expedition that took almost a year and cost the lives of about 80% of their men.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of World War I, the easy-to-reach gold was {{exhausted}} and Fairbanks' population plunged as miners moved to promising finds at Ruby and Iditarod. Construction of the Alaska Railroad caused a surge of economic activity and allowed heavy equipment to be brought in for further exploitation of Fairbanks' gold deposits. Enormous gold dredges were built north of Fairbanks, and the city grew throughout the 1930s as the <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>gold</b> rose during the Great Depression. A further boom came during the 1940s and 1950s as the city became a staging area for construction of military depots during World War II and {{the first decade of}} the Cold War.|$|E

50|$|After {{developing}} {{a system which}} tracked and printed the <b>prices</b> <b>of</b> <b>gold</b> and stocks, Pope partnered with Thomas Edison in 1869, forming the company Pope, Edison & Company Electrical Engineers, and invented a one-wire telegraph in 1870.

5|$|Following the {{discovery}} of gold in California, {{a large amount of}} gold coins began appearing in American commercial channels. The influx caused the <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>gold</b> relative to silver to decrease, making silver coins worth more as bullion than as currency. They were exported abroad, or else melted locally for their bullion value. As it was profitable to export silver, little was presented at the Mint, which resulted in low mintage numbers for the silver dollar; 1,300 and 1,100 were struck in 1851 and 1852 respectively. The rarity of these dates was recognized by the late 1850s; Mint employees made surreptitious restrikes to sell to collectors.|$|E
5|$|France voiced {{concerns}} over the artificially low <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>gold</b> in 1968 and called for returns to the former gold standard. Meanwhile, excess dollars flowed into international markets as the United States expanded its money supply to accommodate the costs of its military campaign in the Vietnam War. Its gold reserves were assaulted by speculative investors following its first current account deficit since the 19th century. In August 1971, President Richard Nixon suspended the exchange of U.S. dollars for gold {{as part of the}} Nixon Shock. The closure of the gold window effectively shifted the adjustment burdens of a devalued dollar to other nations. Speculative traders chased other currencies and began selling dollars in anticipation of these currencies being revalued against the dollar. These influxes of capital presented difficulties to foreign central banks, which then faced choosing among inflationary money supplies, largely ineffective capital controls, or floating exchange rates. Following these woes surrounding the U.S. dollar, the dollar <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>gold</b> was raised to $38 USD per ounce and the Bretton Woods system was modified to allow fluctuations within an augmented band of 2.25% as part of the Smithsonian Agreement signed by the G-10 members in December 1971. The agreement delayed the system's demise for a further two years. The system's erosion was expedited not only by the dollar devaluations that occurred, but also by the oil crises of the 1970s which emphasized the importance of international financial markets in petrodollar recycling and balance of payments financing. Once the world's reserve currency began to float, other nations began adopting floating exchange rate regimes.|$|E
5|$|In 1886, 5million {{birds were}} {{estimated}} to be killed for their feathers. They were shot usually in the spring, when their feathers were colored for mating and nesting. The plumes, or aigrettes, as they were called in the millinery business, sold for $32 an ounce in 1915— the <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>gold.</b> Millinery was a $17million a year industry that motivated plume harvesters to lay in watch of nests of egrets and many colored birds during the nesting season, shoot the parents with small-bore rifles, and leave the chicks to starve. Plumes from Everglades wading birds {{could be found in}} Havana, New York City, London, and Paris. Hunters could collect plumes from a hundred birds on a good day.|$|E
50|$|There {{was a sharp}} {{shift in}} the <b>prices</b> <b>of</b> <b>gold</b> and, to a lesser extent, both silver and platinum. Prices were at or near an all-time high in late 2010 due to people using the {{precious}} metals as {{a safe haven for}} their money as both the de facto value of cash and the stock market prices became more erratic in the late 2000s.|$|R

5|$|By 301, {{however, the}} system was in trouble, {{strained}} by a new bout of inflation. Diocletian therefore issued his Edict on Coinage, an act re-tariffing all debts so that the nummus, the most common coin in circulation, would be worth half as much. In the edict, preserved in an inscription {{from the city of}} Aphrodisias in Caria (near Geyre, Turkey), it was declared that all debts contracted before 1 September 301 must be repaid at the old standards, while all debts contracted after that date would be repaid at the new standards. It appears that the edict was made in an attempt to preserve the current <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>gold</b> and to keep the Empire's coinage on silver, Rome's traditional metal currency. This edict risked giving further momentum to inflationary trends, as had happened after Aurelian's currency reforms. The government's response was to issue a price freeze.|$|E
5|$|The {{precious}} metal composition of US coins was calculated such that gold would be fifteen times as valuable per ounce as silver. By {{the turn of}} the 19th century, the <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>gold</b> in terms of silver had risen to approximately 15.75 to one. This made it profitable for merchants to buy gold coins at face value using silver coins, and export the gold to Europe. Gold vanished from circulation in the United States by 1800. By 1801, almost no bullion was being deposited at the Mint, causing the Jefferson administration to consider its closure. The eagle was especially desired by exporters, as the larger size and value made it more convenient to handle. Although the Mint remained open, on December 31, 1804, President Thomas Jefferson ordered that eagles and silver dollars no longer be struck, ending the Turban Head eagle series. Coin dealer and author Q. David Bowers suggests that while a majority of eagles remained in the United States, enough were exported to make continuing their mintage an exercise in futility.|$|E
5|$|In {{switching}} {{to what was}} essentially a gold standard, the United States joined a host of nations {{around the world that}} based their currencies on gold alone. But in doing so, these nations exacerbated the demand for gold as opposed to silver which, combined with more silver being mined, drove the cost of gold up and silver down. The result was not apparent immediately after the Coinage Act's passage, but by 1879 the ratio between the <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>gold</b> and that of silver had risen from 16.4:1 to 18.4:1; by 1896 it was 30:1. The ultimate effect was more expensive gold, which meant lower prices and deflation for other goods. The deflation made the effects of the Panic of 1873 worse, making it more expensive for debtors to pay debts they had contracted when currency was less valuable. Farmers and laborers, especially, clamored for the return of coinage in both metals, believing the increased money supply would restore wages and property values, and the divide between pro- and anti-silver forces grew in the decades to come. Writing in 1895, Sherman defended the bill, saying that, barring some international agreement to switch the entire world to a bimetallic standard, the United States dollar should remain a gold-backed currency.|$|E

In this research, the researcher was interested to study about the Kepanjen communications network of the trader <b>of</b> Market <b>gold</b> about <b>price</b> information <b>of</b> newest <b>gold.</b> Then was found by the problem of the research that is how the process of the formation of the Kepanjen communications network of the trader <b>of</b> Market <b>gold</b> about <b>price</b> information <b>of</b> newest gold; how the pattern of the Kepanjen communications network of the trader <b>of</b> Market <b>gold</b> about <b>price</b> information <b>of</b> newest <b>gold,</b> and described whoever played a role what in Kepanjen network communication of the trader <b>of</b> Market <b>gold</b> about <b>price</b> information <b>of</b> newest <b>gold.</b> To be able to answer the formulation of the problem that was raised, and then was used the analysis of the communications network as the research method. The data was gathered through observation, the questionnaire, and interview to the informant that was taken technically purposive. Afterwards the data that was received was presented with sociometry and sosiogram. The communications network according to Moekijat in his book the Theory of Communication, was a situation was compiled where people sent information in a certain pattern. According to Bambang Setiawan, essence of a communications network was relations that was homophile, that is the human trend to carry out relations with people who had the attribute that was the same as himself. But this was not significant that the communications network will only happen to people who had just the same attributed. Very much a communications network was formed then in each kind of communication relations the movement or information from someone to the other person will happen. If communication relations happened so as the transfer and acceptance of proceeding information, then this information will begin to be influential to people who were involved in this communication. Results of the research in the Kepanjen communications network of the trader <b>of</b> Market <b>gold</b> in looking for <b>price</b> information <b>of</b> newest <b>gold</b> showed that: (1) the Kepanjen Communications Network of the trader <b>of</b> Market <b>gold</b> about <b>price</b> information <b>of</b> newest <b>gold,</b> was formed because the existence of the phenomenon asked the gold trader that it was considered more knew about <b>price</b> information <b>of</b> newest <b>gold.</b> Fenoma this happened resulting from the <b>price</b> <b>of</b> unstable <b>gold.</b> So as {{to have an impact on}} the change in the process of the trade transaction in gold.

25|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that the <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>gold</b> {{is closely related}} to interest rates. As interest rates rise, the general tendency is for the gold price, which earns no interest, to fall, and vice versa. As a result, the gold price can be closely correlated to central banks via their monetary policy decisions on interest rates. For example, if market signals indicate the possibility of prolonged inflation, central banks may decide to raise interest rates, which could reduce the <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>gold.</b> But this does not always happen: after the European Central Bank raised its interest rate slightly on April 7, 2011, {{for the first time since}} 2008, the <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>gold</b> drove higher, and hit a new high one day later.
