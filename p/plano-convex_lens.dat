25|$|Spherical {{aberration}} {{occurs because}} spherical surfaces {{are not the}} ideal shape for a lens, but {{are by far the}} simplest shape to which glass can be ground and polished, and so are often used. Spherical aberration causes beams parallel to, but distant from, the lens axis to be focused in a slightly different place than beams close to the axis. This manifests itself as a blurring of the image. Lenses in which closer-to-ideal, non-spherical surfaces are used are called aspheric lenses. These were formerly complex to make and often extremely expensive, but advances in technology have greatly reduced the manufacturing cost for such lenses. Spherical aberration can be minimised by carefully choosing the surface curvatures for a particular application. For instance, a <b>plano-convex</b> <b>lens,</b> which is used to focus a collimated beam, produces a sharper focal spot when used with the convex side towards the beam source.|$|E

50|$|A basic DOF adapter {{usually has}} four {{components:}} a macro lens, an optional <b>plano-convex</b> <b>lens,</b> a translucent focusing screen, {{and finally a}} photographic lens of the user's choice. On camcorders without sufficient macro capability, a macro lens, preferably an achromatic doublet (to minimize chromatic aberration), is usually attached directly to the camcorder so that the camcorder can zoom in {{and focus on the}} focusing screen. Without the macro lens, certain camcorders would be unable to zoom in well enough to frame the entire focusing screen and still achieve sharp focus. The optional <b>plano-convex</b> <b>lens</b> is used to avoid vignetting in the image. The focusing screen is where the photographic lens image is projected. The screen must be placed at precisely the correct distance from the flange focal mount of whatever lens is being used (most popularly the Canon FD or Nikon F mount), referred to as the flange back distance. Finally, the front lens is a photographic or cinema lens that projects the image desired onto the focusing screen.|$|E

50|$|In 1851 John Benjamin Dancer invented microphotographs using a {{collodion}} {{process and}} a microscope {{converted to a}} camera. This resulted in a microphotograph about 3 mm2 in area. The main disadvantage of Dancer's method was that the viewing of the microphotographs required a microscope which {{was at the time}} an expensive instrument. In 1857 Dagron solved the problem by inventing a method of mounting the microphotographs {{at the end of a}} small cylindrical lens. Dagron modified the Stanhope lens by sectioning the normally biconvex Stanhope lens and introducing a planar section so that the plane was located at the focal length of the convex side of the cylindrical lens. This produced a <b>plano-convex</b> <b>lens,</b> where Dagron was able to mount the microscopic photograph on the flat side of the lens using Canada balsam as adhesive. This arrangement enabled the picture to be focused.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} poly(methyl methacrylate) intraocular lens shape on optical {{performance}} of pseudophakic eyes was investigated. Image quality criteria included wave aberrations, spot diagrams, longitudinal aberrations, the modulation transfer function, and an optimization procedure. For eyes with corneal asphericities encompassing {{most of the}} population, the optimum lens form for on-axis vision is close to plano-convex, with the more curved surface facing the cornea. This applies whether lenses are correctly centered, tilted, or decentered. For small off-axis angles, optimum lens shape varies with the ocular parameters. Good intraocular lens shapes range from the plano-convex to the equi-convex. <b>Plano-convex</b> <b>lenses</b> with the curved surface facing the retina are not recommended...|$|R

5000|$|At the {{beginning}} {{stages in the}} development of microfilm, microscopes were used to view the microform documents.

50|$|The {{distinctive}} lens has a 'stepped' appearance {{instead of}} the 'full' or 'smooth' appearance of other lenses. This allows the lens to have a much greater curvature than would otherwise be practical. The lens focuses the light by tilting each ring of glass slightly more towards the center as the distance is increased {{from the center of}} the lens. If the glass were completely flat, this would cause a corresponding pattern of circles of light, so Fresnel lenses are usually stippled on the flat side. This pattern of small bumps helps to break up the light passing through the lens and gives Fresnels their characteristic soft beam. This means that the intensity of the light is consistent across the spread of the beam of light, as opposed to being less intense around the edges as in an ERS. The stepped lens design causes less heat buildup than a <b>plano-convex</b> <b>lens</b> of the same angle.|$|E
5000|$|Huygens eyepieces {{consist of}} two <b>plano-convex</b> <b>lenses</b> with the plane sides towards the eye {{separated}} by an air gap.

The thermally-induced focal shift is exacerbated at low {{values of the}} beam parameter product, {{but it is possible}} to arrange the optical elements such that the focal shift and beam waist variation cancel out. Collimating and focusing low-NA beams with short focal lenses make it possible to use standard <b>plano-convex</b> <b>lenses</b> without causing appreciable spherical aberrations, but the higher power density calls for low-absorption optics in order to mitigate thermal aberrations. The use of millimeter-size optics will pave the way to lighter processing heads, and this will enable an increased cutting speed in contours at a reduced electrical consumption. It can thus be considered as an alternative to remote cutting or to the addition of local axes to conventional gantry systems...|$|R
5000|$|A {{variant of}} the Cassegrain, the Schiefspiegler {{telescope}} ("skewed" [...] or [...] "oblique reflector") uses tilted mirrors to avoid the secondary mirror casting a shadow on the primary. However, while eliminating diffraction patterns this leads {{to an increase in}} coma and astigmatism. These defects become manageable at large focal ratios — most Schiefspieglers use f/15 or longer, which tends to restrict useful observation to the moon and planets. A number of variations are common, with varying numbers of mirrors of different types. The Kutter (named after its inventor Anton Kutter) style uses a single concave primary, a convex secondary and a <b>plano-convex</b> <b>lens</b> between the secondary mirror and the focal plane, when needed (this is the case of the catadioptric Schiefspiegler). One variation of a multi-schiefspiegler uses a concave primary, convex secondary and a parabolic tertiary.

50|$|The first simple {{condensers}} {{were introduced}} on pre-achromatic microscopes in the 17th century. Robert Hooke used {{a combination of}} a salt water filled globe and a <b>plano-convex</b> <b>lens,</b> and shows in the 'Micrographia' that he understands the reasons for its efficiency. Makers in the 18th century such as Benjamin Martin, Adams and Jones understood the advantage of condensing the area of the light source to that of the area of the object on the stage. This was a simple plano-convex or bi-convex lens, or sometimes a combination of lenses. With the development of the modern achromatic objective in 1829, by Joseph Jackson Lister, the need for better condensers became increasingly apparent. By 1837, the use of the achromatic condenser was introduced in France, by Felix Dujardin, and Chevalier. English makers early took up this improvement, due to the obsession with resolving test objects such as diatoms and Nobert ruled gratings. By the late 1840s, English makers such as Ross, Powell and Smith; all could supply highly corrected condensers on their best stands, with proper centring and focus. It is erroneously stated that these developments were purely empirical - no-one can design a good achromatic, spherically corrected condenser relying only on empirics. On the Continent, in Germany, the corrected condenser was not considered either useful or essential, mainly due to a misunderstanding of the basic optical principles involved. Thus the leading German company, Carl Zeiss in Jena, offered nothing more than a very poor chromatic condenser into the late 1870s. French makers, such as Nachet, provided excellent achromatic condensers on their stands When the leading German bacteriologist, Robert Koch, complained to Ernst Abbe, that he was forced to buy a Seibert achromatic condenser for his Zeiss microscope, in order to make satisfactory photographs of bacteria, Abbe produced a very good achromatic design in 1878.|$|E

The lens separation varies between different designs, but is typically somewhere between 7/10 and 7/8 of the focal length of the eye-lens, the choice being a trade off between residual transverse chromatic aberration (at low values) and at high values running {{the risk of the}} field lens touching the focal plane when used by an observer who works with a close virtual image such as a myopic observer, or a young person whose accommodation is able to cope with a close virtual image (this is a serious problem when used with a micrometer as it can result in damage to the instrument).|$|R
