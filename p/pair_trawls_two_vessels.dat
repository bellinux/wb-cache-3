50|$|A factory {{stern trawler}} is a large stern trawler which has {{additional}} onboard processing facilities and can stay at sea for days or weeks at a time. A stern trawler tows a fishing trawl net and hauls the catch up a stern ramp. These can be either demersal (weighted bottom trawling); pelagic (mid-water trawling); or <b>pair</b> <b>trawling,</b> where <b>two</b> <b>vessels</b> about 500 metres apart together pull one huge net with a mouth circumference of 900 meters.|$|R
50|$|<b>Pair</b> <b>trawling</b> is {{effective}} on all demersal species. In shallow waters, where {{the noise from}} a single vessel may scatter fish, <b>two</b> <b>vessels</b> operating a distance apart tend to herd fish {{into the path of}} the net. Catch per vessel often considerably exceeds that attainable through standard bottom <b>trawling.</b> <b>Pair</b> trawlers targeting cod off the coast of New England have reported average per vessel catches of three to six times that from single trawls.|$|R
50|$|Pelagic <b>pair</b> <b>trawling</b> - {{operate in}} a similar method to the {{demersal}} <b>pair</b> <b>trawl</b> and again with lighter gear.|$|R
25|$|Navigational instruments, {{such as an}} {{autopilot}} and GPS, {{are used}} for manoeuvering the vessel in harbour and at sea. Radar can be used, for example, when <b>pair</b> <b>trawling</b> to keep the correct distance between the <b>two</b> <b>vessels.</b> Communication instruments range from basic radio devices to maritime distress systems and EPIRBs, as well as devices for communicating with the crew. Fish detection devices, such as echosounders and sonar, are used to locate fish.|$|R
2500|$|When two {{boats are}} used (<b>pair</b> <b>trawling),</b> the {{horizontal}} {{spread of the}} net {{is provided by the}} boats, with one {{or in the case of}} pelagic <b>trawling</b> <b>two</b> [...] attached to each boat. However, single-boat trawling is more common. Here, the horizontal spread of the net is provided by trawl doors (also known as [...] "otter boards"). Trawl doors are available in various sizes and shapes and may be specialized to keep in contact with the sea bottom (bottom trawling) or to remain elevated in the water. In all cases, doors essentially act as wings, using a hydrodynamic shape to provide horizontal spread. As with all wings, the towing vessel must go at a certain speed for the doors to remain standing and functional. This speed varies, but is generally in the range of 2.5–4.0 knots.|$|R
50|$|Because of the {{increased}} efficiency of <b>pair</b> <b>trawling,</b> vessels are able to tow their gears in mid-water at a faster speed to target species which are normally able to escape trawl nets, such as the European seabass. This has caused some controversy, due to {{the high level of}} marine mammal bycatch associated, leading to the British government introducing a ban on <b>pair</b> <b>trawling</b> for bass in UK territorial waters.|$|R
40|$|Pelagic <b>pair</b> <b>trawling</b> for tuna, Thunnus spp., and swordfish, Xiphias gladius, was {{introduced}} in U. S. Northwest Atlantic waters in 1991. During autumn (October-November) of 1992 under the authority oft he Federal Atlantic Swordfish Regulations, the National Marine Fisheries Service placed observers aboard pelagic <b>pair</b> <b>trawl</b> vessels to document the catch, bycatch, discard, and gear used in this new fishery. The fishery is conducted primarily at night along shelf-edge waters from June to November. In late 1991, revised regulations restricted swordfish to bycatch in this fishery resulting in pelagic <b>pair</b> <b>trawl</b> vessels targeting tuna throughout 1992. Analyses of 1992 data indicate that albacore, T. alalunga, was the predominant species caught, although yellowfin tuna, T. albaeares, and bigeye tuna, T. obesus, were the preferred target species. Bycatch also included swordfish, large sharks, pelagic rays and other pelagic fishes, other tunas, and marine mammals...|$|R

As {{the mouth of the}} net is kept open by the lateral pull of the individual vessels, otter boards are not required.

40|$|The {{catches in}} terms of {{landings}} and discards were monitored onboard MFV “Vertrouwen” TX 68, fishing with <b>two</b> pulse <b>trawls</b> using the Verburg-Holland system during four weeks in June-August 2009. The average fishing speed was about 5 knots. The fishing area of the four trips was east of the coast of England and fishing depth was 36 m on average with a minimum depth of 20 m and a maximum depth of 46 m. For this study the standard sampling procedure for the yearly monitoring of discards of conventional beam trawl fleet was applied (van Helmond and van Overzee, 2008). Sampled numbers of fish per haul were raised to numbers and weight per hour, for both. When compared with conventional beam trawls in previous years it seems that with the pulse trawl more sole in number and weights per unit of time was discarded and less plaice was discarded. However, the average discard percentages of as well plaice as sole for the pulse trawl {{of this study were}} within range with the average discard percentages of conventional beam trawls in 2005, 2006 and 2007 (van Keeken, 2006; van Helmond and van Overzee, 2007; van Helmond and van Overzee, 2008).
