50|$|Unlike many proteins, casein is not coagulated by heat. During {{the process}} of clotting, milk-clotting proteases act on the soluble portion of the caseins, κ-casein, thus {{originating}} an unstable micellar state that results in clot formation. When coagulated with chymosin, casein is sometimes called <b>paracasein.</b> Chymosin (EC 3.4.23.4) is an aspartic protease that specifically hydrolyzes the peptide bond in Phe105-Met106 of κ-casein, and {{is considered to be}} the most efficient protease for the cheese-making industry (Rao et al., 1998). British terminology, on the other hand, uses the term caseinogen for the uncoagulated protein and casein for the coagulated protein. As it exists in milk, it is a salt of calcium.|$|E
40|$|The {{complex of}} calcium-paracaseinate-phosphate is the matrix {{substance}} of cheese. The changes it undergoes during maturing determines many {{characteristics of the}} finished product. The preliminary studies {{of the effect of}} pH and sodium chloride on the swelling and solubility of the paracasein-complex did not reflect the actual situation in cheese. This was the result of using a diluted cheese extract or suspensions of a few grams of <b>paracasein</b> complex in a large volume of water, instead of using concentrations occurring in cheese. The experiments demonstrated that the peptizing effect of salt on the <b>paracasein</b> complex was enormously influenced by the ratio of <b>paracasein</b> complex to water. In diluted suspensions which showed significant peptization, the concentration of calcium was very much lower than in cheese. The peptization of the <b>paracasein</b> complex however was much reduced by calcium. The results of this study revealed that swelling in the reconstituted cheese was fairly limited, when pH and calcium and sodium chloride contents were similar to the actual condition in cheese, and that relatively small variations in the conditions mentioned caused no real change in the swelling...|$|E
40|$|The {{impact of}} varying the pH of whey at whey {{drainage}} (5. 9, 6. 15 or 6. 4) {{on the development}} of curd structure during the manufacture of Mozzarella cheese was investigated using scanning electron microscopy. Dramatic changes in curd structure were apparent with stage of manufacture, in particular the stretching step which aligned the protein fibers. Of additional interest is the effect of draw pH on the structure of curd at whey drainage. When whey was drained at pH 6. 4, an open poorly fused network of <b>paracasein</b> particles was observed in the cheese curd. Jn contrast, lowering the draw pH (6. 15 and 5. 9) increased fusion of <b>paracasein</b> particles producing a more continuous three dimensional network. The degree of <b>paracasein</b> fusion in curd at whey drainage may be related to overall calcium levels and particularly to the calcium/ total protein ratio...|$|E

40|$|Changes that {{occurred}} in the microstructure of low-moisture, part skim Mozzarella made with a mixed starter consisting of Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus and Lacwbacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and coagulated with fermentation -produced chymosin, were examined during 50 days of ripening at 4 °C. Im mediately after manufacture (day 3), a homogeneous and continuous phase of amorphous <b>paracasein</b> represented a three-dimensional protein network in the cheese. A large number of irregularly shaped and sized microcavi ties were present. During 50 days of aging, an increase in the porosity of the defatted <b>paracasein</b> matrix was apparent. These changes were coincidental with a fourfold increase in water-soluble nitrogen (from approximately 2 to 8 % of total N) and hydrolysis of approximately 50 % of aS 1 -casein. It is suggested that the confluence of adjoining microcavities {{that occurred}} progressively throughout storage may be due to proteolysis or C 02 production by the starter culture...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to determine the viability of Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM and Lactobacillus rhamnosus HN 001 in Edam cheese as well as the effect of probiotic bacteria on <b>paracasein</b> proteolysis and changes in the water activity during ripening. The use of probiotics L. rhamnosus HN 001 and L. acidophilus NCFM in Edam cheese slightly changed its chemical composition, but the change was not significant. The pH values were significantly correlated with the changes in Lactobacillus count (R=– 0. 807) and the level of phosphotungstic acid-soluble nitrogen compounds in total nitrogen (PTA-SN/TN) (R= 0. 775). After 10 weeks of ripening, the highest level of trichloroacetic acid-soluble nitrogen compounds in total nitrogen (TCA-SN/TN) was observed in the cheese containing L. rhamnosus HN 001 (11. 87 %) and slightly lower level in the cheese containing L. acidophilus NCFM (7. 60 %) and control cheese (6. 24 %). The highest level of PTA-SN/TN fraction was noted in cheese containing L. acidophilus NCFM (3. 48 %) but the lowest level was observed in control cheese (2. 24 %) after ten weeks of ripening. The changes in the levels of PTA-SN/TN (R=– 0. 813) and TCA-SN/TN (R=– 0. 717) fractions were signifi cantly (p< 0. 05) correlated with the viability of probiotic counts. Water activity (aw) strongly correlated with the PTA-SN/TN level (R=– 0. 824) and bacteria viability (R=– 0. 728). All of the analyzed cheeses were characterized by high counts of L. rhamnosus HN 001 and L. acidophilus NCFM during ten weeks of ripening...|$|E
40|$|International audienceGreen tea {{polyphenols}} {{are known}} for their antioxidant properties. They also interact with milk proteins, suggesting good retention in the cheese matrix. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of green tea extract (GTE) enrichment on the organoleptic and physicochemical properties of Cheddar-type cheese during storage. GTE was added to milk at concentrations of 0, 1, and 2 g. kg− 1 and cheeses were produced on a pilot scale. An average polyphenol retention coefficient of 0. 63 was obtained in cheese. Total protein, fat, micellar calcium content, and yield of cheese were not significantly affected by GTE addition (P[*]>[*] 0. 05). However, cheese moisture decreased by 1. 9 % with the addition of GTE at a concentration of 2 g. kg− 1 of milk. Enrichment with GTE significantly affected the color of Cheddar-type cheese (P[*]≤[*] 0. 05). A loss of lightness (L* value) and an increase in redness (a* value) and yellowness (b* value) were observed. Cheeses enriched with GTE showed higher hardness and a loss of cohesiveness and springiness, which is indicative of alteration of the <b>paracasein</b> matrix. Cheese sensory properties were evaluated by trained panelists using a ranking test. A decrease in the typical Cheddar flavor and an increase in the overall flavor intensity and the astringency of cheese were observed with the addition of GTE. The addition of GTE at a concentration of 1 or 2 g. kg− 1 of milk increased the antiradical activity of cheese by 25 and 44 %, respectively (P[*]≤[*] 0. 05). GTE enrichment of Cheddar-type cheese could result in new products with increased health benefits...|$|E
40|$|This study {{deals with}} the {{syneresis}} of curd. Rennet gels are primarily considered; some comparisons with acid milk gels are given. After curdling the milk, the curd tends to shrink; in other words, the network of aggregated <b>paracasein</b> micelles (PCM) will be under stress. If the curd is cut or - {{as was the case}} in our expirements - a curd surface is wetted, syneresis starts. The rate at which the whey is expelled depends on the pressure gradient in the whey and on the permeability of the network. In Chapter 2 the materials and methods generally used are described. Unless mentioned otherwise, standard conditions were used in the experiments. By standard conditions is meant: reconstituted skim milk with the saw dry matter content as the original milk, to which 500 ppm rennet was added; the temperature during the whole experiment was kept at 30 °C; no CaCl 2 was added. The endogenous syneresis pressure (Ps) appeared to be very low, about 1 Pa. In Chapter 3 two methods are described which give an order of magnitude of the stresses involved. Moreover, the weight of the network can cause an additional pressure. The maximum pressure caused by the weight (Pg) at a level hc below the interface is (ρ curd - ρ curd) ghc ≈ 75 hc Pa (hc in m). The permeability measurements are described in Chapter 4. Two methods were used; in both, the flow of whey through a vertical column of curd was measured as a function of head pressure. A problem is that the curd is deformed during the experiment. In the "tube" method, deformation is a function of the pressure gradient (d Pt /dx), the diameter of the tube holding the curd (d t), and the rigidity of the gel. In the second method the "torsionflux" method, the deformation was adjustable. 'The tube method led to the following results. - The permeability is of the order of 10 - 13 m 2 . - Permeability increases with time, which is ascribed to "microsyneresis", i. e. syneresis at local sites in the gel. The rate of increase is approximately constant. - The increase in permeability (d B /d t) is higher for a higher pressure gradient or a wider tube; both lead to larger deformation of the curd. - The change of the permeability with time in the absence of deformation (d Be /d t) was obtained by applying the head pressure at different times after addition of rennet. Shortly after clotting permeability increases fastest. Between 1 and 24 hd Be /d t was constant. - The permeability of curd made from ultrafiltered skim milk (B (i)) and its change with time (d B (i) /d t) were determined. Thisyielded the permeability as a function of concentration and time (B (i,t)). - The permeability also depends on temperature, CaCl 2 concentration, acidity, fat content and type of skim milk. - In acid milk geld permeability was of the same order of magnitude, but it hardly changed with time. The rheological behaviour of curd is discussed in Chapter 5. The dynamic measurments with the "Den Otter" rheometer show that the moduli G ' and G " kept increasing for a long time (~ 3 h) after rennet addition. From the dependence of G' and G" on the angular frequency it was deduced that G" is due to the relaxation of bonds and that the relaxation time is a few times 10 s. The instantaneous shear modulus (G 0 ) was determined as a function of protein concentration. The obtained relation can be explained in term of an only partly effective contribution of the casein to the network; this contribution being relatively smaller at lower concentrations. Also from the creep measurements it was concluded that the endogenous syneresis pressure was less than 10 Pa. If both permeability and pressure are known for all values of concentration (or relative remaining volume (i)) and time (t), the syneresis can in principle be calculated. This is in the model described in Chapter 6, in which the equation of Darcy is combined with the equation of continuity. A numerical procedure is developed, for a one dimensional case; the syneresis of a thin slab. The pressure in the whey is the sum of the endogenous syneresis pressure (Ps) and the pressure caused by the weight of the network (Pg). For Ps(i) and Pg(i) some trial functions were considered. In Chapter 7 the syneresis of slabs is studied. The results of the experiments show that initially Γ= dlogΔH/dlog t is about 0. 5. For t > 0. 5 h Γincreases to ~ 0. 78. Γis independent of the original thickness of the slab (H 0 ) during a certain period (penetration period). The length of this period depends on H 0 . After one day H did not change any more and H∞ / H 0 was about one third. The best fit between model calculations and experimental results was obtained if it was assumed that:- the permeability increases with time (t) and decreases with i, as was found in the experiments,- endogenous syneresis pressure (Ps) decreases only with shrinkage, - maximum gravitational pressure (Pbg) is constant,- P 0 s= Pbg= 1 Pa (H 0 = 10 mm). P 0 swas found to be a function of time after renneting, at first increasing, then (after 1 - 2 h) decreasing. However, the introduction of such a relation in the model did not improve the fit to the experimental results. After all, the pressure cannot relax twice, both by shrinkage and by "ageing". The effects of several parameters (pH, temperature, Ca concentration, etc.) on milk clotting, gel permeability, syneresis and curd rigidity are interrelated. A survey is given in Table 7. 2 and a tentative explanation is summarized in Table 7. 3. In Chapter 8 it is shown that external pressure has a dramatic effect m the syneresis rate. Extrapolation to zero external pressure yields, again, an endogenous syneresis pressure of about 1 Pa...|$|E
