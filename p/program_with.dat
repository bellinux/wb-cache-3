40|$|We present two {{equivalent}} {{approaches for}} defining answer sets for logic <b>programs</b> <b>with</b> arbitrary abstract constraint atoms (c-atoms). The first approach uses an immediate consequence operator for answer set checking, whose definition {{relies on the}} notion of conditional satisfaction of c-atoms w. r. t. a pair of interpretations. The second approach generalizes the notion of well-supported models of normal logic <b>programs</b> to <b>programs</b> <b>with</b> c-atoms. We prove that the newly defined semantics coincides with previously introduced semantics for logic <b>programs</b> <b>with</b> monotone c-atoms and extends the original answer set semantics for normal logic programs. We discuss different possibilities for treating negation-as-failure c-atoms and characterize situations in which they yield the same answer sets. We study some properties of answer sets of <b>programs</b> <b>with</b> c-atoms and relate our definition to several semantics for logic <b>programs</b> <b>with</b> aggregates...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Read-write locking is an {{important}} mecha-nism to improve concurrent granularity, {{but it is difficult}} to reason about the safety of concurrent <b>programs</b> <b>with</b> read-write locks. Concurrent Separation Logic(CSL) provides a simple but powerful technique for locally rea-soning about concurrent <b>programs</b> <b>with</b> mutual exclusive locks. Unfortunately, CSL cannot be directly applied to reason about concurrent <b>programs</b> <b>with</b> read-write locks due to the different concurrent control mechanisms. This paper focuses on extending CSL and present a proof-carrying code(PCC) system for reasoning about concurrent <b>programs</b> <b>with</b> read-write locks. We extend the heap model with a writing permission set, denoted as logical heap, then define "strong separation " and "weak separation " over logical heap. Following CSL’s local-reasoning idea, we develop a novel program logic to enforces weak separations of heap between different threads and support verification of concurrent <b>programs</b> <b>with</b> read-write locks...|$|R

Additionally, genetic programming using ADFs (recursive and non-recursive) outperforms genetic programming without ADFs. The scalability of these techniques is also investigated. The computational effort required to reach a solution using ADFs with recursion is shown to remain essentially constant with world size, while genetic <b>programming</b> <b>with</b> non-recursive ADFs scales linearly at best, and basic genetic programming scales exponentially. Finally, many solutions were found using genetic <b>programming</b> <b>with</b> recursive ADFs which generalized to any world siz...|$|R
