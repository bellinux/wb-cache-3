40|$|The {{process of}} {{publishing}} scientific papers {{should be based}} on universal principles of professional conduct: credibility, truth and authenticity. In academia, the inclusion of <b>policies</b> <b>on</b> <b>ethical</b> <b>standards</b> in journal instructions to authors could prevent misconduct and fraud in scientific publication. Due to the lack of attention to research ethics in the Social Sciences, in particular in Spain and Latin America, this research aims to analyze the scientific misconduct policy of the Spanish and Latin American journals in the JCR-Social Sciences Edition (2014). To achieve our goal, 104 selected journal instructions to authors were examined in relation to the following ethical principles: (1) the rights of people involved in the research; (2) the welfare of animals used in research; (3) conflicts of interest; and (4) publication issues. Our results suggest that publication issues such as unpublished research and the ban on simultaneous submission are the most frequently cited ethical issues. In spite of the efforts made by policy-making bodies to establish misconduct guidelines, very few journals adhere to ICMJE and COPE recommendations. Given the ethical heterogeneity evinced by our study, and by previous studies, it seems that the development of a uniform code of ethics in the field of Social Sciences may be required...|$|R

50|$|Many {{companies}} use {{the phrases}} ethical code and {{code of conduct}} interchangeably {{but it may be}} useful to make a distinction. A code of ethics will start by setting out the values that underpin the code and will describe a company's obligation to its stakeholders.

It will include details of how the company plans to implement its values and vision, as well as guidance to staff <b>on</b> <b>ethical</b> <b>standards</b> and how to achieve them. However, a code of conduct is generally addressed to and intended for employees alone. It usually sets out restrictions on behavior, and will be far more compliance or rules focused than value or principle focused.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Is there a {{difference}} between business ethics and social responsibility? Are the two compatible or mutually exclusive? This paper {{raises questions about the}} overlap and reciprocally supportive interface between business ethics and social responsibility, as well as about their mutual exclusivity. It isolates several specific ethical and social responsibility topics for further exploration. Finally, this paper considers some of the implications of this debate for supply management professionals. Objective: The objective {{of this paper is to}} encourage debate and exploration regarding the interface between ethics and social responsibility and to further the definition of the role that supply managers play in promoting excellence in both areas.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between decision-making and emotions has been increasingly explored {{in the past}} thirty years by physicians, psychologists and economists. Because of the impact that emotions have <b>on</b> human behaviour, <b>ethical</b> implications need to be examined if we consider that managers could use emotions to motivate employees. This paper analyses the content of the code of ethics of 278 companies listed on the Italian stock exchange in order to verify how the codes take into account the emotion of fear experienced by employees in the workplace. Research findings revealed that companies have failed to consider the word “fear” and most of the other terms expressing similar emotions. On the other hand, their codes of ethics focused <b>on</b> <b>ethical</b> <b>standards</b> that should be respected, such as the dignity of each single individual and on unethical actions that must be avoided, such as acts of physical or psychological violence...|$|R

Abuses in the field surfaced in the early 1800 s, and by the 1890 s, anti-vivisectionists were calling for laws to protect children because of the increasing numbers of institutionalised children being subjected to unethical research.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{design of}} {{clinical}} research deserves special caution {{so as to}} safeguard the rights of participating individuals. While {{the international community has}} agreed <b>on</b> <b>ethical</b> <b>standards</b> for the design of research, these frameworks still remain open to interpretation, revision and debate. Recently a breach in the consensus of how to apply these <b>ethical</b> <b>standards</b> to research in developing countries has occurred, notably beginning with the 1994 placebo-controlled trials to reduce maternal to child transmission of HIV- 1 in Africa, Asia and the Caribbean. The design of these trials sparked intense debate with the inclusion of a placebo-control group despite the existence of a 'gold standard' and trial supporters grounded their justifications of the trial design on the context of scarcity in resource-poor settings. Discussion These 'contextual' apologetics are arguably an ethical loophole inherent in current bioethical methodology. However, this convenient appropriation of 'contextual' analysis simply fails to acknowledge the underpinnings of feminist ethical analysis upon which it must stand. A more rigorous analysis of the political, social, and economic structures pertaining to the global context of developing countries reveals that the bioethical principles of beneficence and justice fail to be met in this trial design. Conclusion Within this broader, and theoretically necessary, understanding of context, it becomes impossible to justify an <b>ethical</b> double <b>standard</b> for research in developing countries. </p...|$|R
