50|$|There are two {{different}} ways to mount the pump: either directly on the truck with the vacuum drive powered by the truck motor, or on the trailer with an independent motor.

50|$|Fine-needle {{aspiration}}, or fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC), involves use of {{a needle}} attached to a syringe is to collect cells from lesions or masses in various body organs by microcoring, often with the application of negative <b>pressure</b> (<b>suction)</b> to increase yield. FNAC can be performed under palpation guidance (i.e., the clinician can feel the lesion) on a mass in superficial regions like the neck, thyroid or breast; FNAC may be assisted by ultrasound or CAT scan for sampling of deep-seated lesions within the body that cannot be localized via palpation. FNAC is widely used in many countries, but success rate {{is dependent on the}} skill of the practitioner. If performed by a pathologist alone, or as team with pathologist-cytotechnologist, the success rate of proper diagnosis is superior than when performed by a non-pathologist. This {{may be due to the}} pathologist's ability to immediately evaluate specimens under a microscope and immediately repeat the procedure if sampling was inadequate.|$|E
50|$|Blast {{injuries}} {{can result}} from various types of incidents ranging from industrial accidents to terrorist attacks. High-order explosives produce a supersonic overpressure shock wave, while low order explosives deflagrate and do not produce an overpressure wave. A blast wave generated by an explosion starts with a single pulse of increased air pressure, lasting a few milliseconds. The negative <b>pressure</b> (<b>suction)</b> of the blast wave follows immediately after the positive wave. The duration of the blast wave depends {{on the type of}} explosive material and the distance from the point of detonation. The blast wave progresses from the source of explosion as a sphere of compressed and rapidly expanding gases, which displaces an equal volume of air at a very high velocity. The velocity of the blast wave in air may be extremely high, depending on the type and amount of the explosive used. An individual in the path of an explosion will be subjected not only to excess barometric pressure, but to pressure from the high-velocity wind traveling directly behind the shock front of the blast wave. The magnitude of damage due to the blast wave is dependent on the peak of the initial positive pressure wave, the duration of the overpressure, the medium in which it explodes, the distance from the incident blast wave, and the degree of focusing due to a confined area or walls. For example, explosions near or within hard solid surfaces become amplified two to nine times due to shock wave reflection. As a result, individuals between the blast and a building generally suffer two to three times the degree of injury compared to those in open spaces.|$|E

40|$|Synopsis We {{studied the}} flow of the post-lens tear film under a soft contact lens to {{understand}} how the design parameters of contact lenses can affect ocular health. When a soft contact lens is inserted, the blinking eyelid causes the lens to stretch in order to conform to the shape of the eye. The deformed contact lens acts to assume its un-deformed shape and thus generates a <b>suction</b> <b>pressure</b> in the post-lens tear film. In consequence, the post-lens tear fluid moves; it responds to the <b>suction</b> <b>pressure.</b> The <b>suction</b> <b>pressure</b> may draw in fresh fluid {{from the edge of the}} lens, or it may eject fluid there, as the lens reassumes its un-deformed shape. In this article, we develop a mathematical model of {{the flow of}} the post-lens tear fluid in response to the mechanical <b>suction</b> <b>pressure</b> of a deformed contact lens. We predict the amount of exchange of fluid exchange under a contact lens and we explore the influence of the eye’s shape on the rate of exchange of fluid...|$|R

However, a questionable efficacy is still identified to choose <b>suctioning</b> <b>pressure</b> between 130 mmHg and 140 mmHg that is effective for patients with endotracheal tube. Objective: To compare the effectiveness of 130 mmHg and 140 mmHg <b>suctioning</b> <b>pressure</b> on oxygen saturation in patients with endotracheal tube. Methods: This research used a quasy experimental design with pretest and posttest group. The study was conducted from 31 January to 1 March 2017 in the Hospital of Panti Wilasa Citarum and Hospital of Roemani Muhammadiyah Semarang. There were 30 samples recruited using consecutive sampling, with 15 assigned in the 130 mmHg and 140 mmHg <b>suctioning</b> <b>pressure</b> group.

Results: Findings showed that there was a statistically significant effect of 130 and 140 mmHg <b>suctioning</b> <b>pressure</b> on oxygen saturation in patients with ETT with p-value < 0. 05.

40|$|LectureFor years, {{labyrinth}} shaft-end seals {{have been}} used for centrifugal compressors handling air and nonhazardous gases, and for low <b>suction</b> <b>pressure</b> compressors in hydrocarbon service. To prevent gas leakage from the hydrocarbon machines, either injection of inert gas or jet ejector systems have been applied with the seals. The ejectors were normally arranged to exhaust back to the compressor suction. Early application of labyrinth/ejector seal systems were generally on compressors with <b>suction</b> <b>pressures</b> in the 0 - 8 psig range, and the seal system operation was generally satisfactory. Many of the older machines have been uprated to higher <b>suction</b> <b>pressures.</b> The labyrinth/ejector seal systems have been applied to newer compressors with <b>suction</b> <b>pressures</b> as high as 15 psig. Many of the systems do not perform satisfactorily, and operators complain of leakage of hydrocarbons and contamination of the lube oil.

40|$|Wound {{filters are}} quite {{popular in the}} {{domestic}} water purification systems. The performance of these filters {{is based on the}} distinctive yarn and winding variables. Yarn used for filtration application is normally produced on DREF spinning system. Several researchers have reported the influence of DREF spinning variables on yarn properties.
