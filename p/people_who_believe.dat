5|$|The Moon {{has long}} been {{associated}} with insanity and irrationality; the words lunacy and lunatic (popular shortening loony) are derived from the Latin name for the Moon, Luna. Philosophers Aristotle and Pliny the Elder argued that the full moon induced insanity in susceptible individuals, believing that the brain, which is mostly water, must {{be affected by the}} Moon and its power over the tides, but the Moon's gravity is too slight to affect any single person. Even today, <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>believe</b> in a lunar effect claim that admissions to psychiatric hospitals, traffic accidents, homicides or suicides increase during a full moon, but dozens of studies invalidate these claims.|$|E

25|$|The Stephenson Mansion {{was listed}} on The National Register of Historic Places as the William H. H. Graham House in 1982. The home {{was built in}} 1889 for William H. H. Graham, who was {{associated}} with the Benjamin Harrison administration. It also served as a sorority home for Kappa Kappa Gamma students at Butler University in 1923. D. C. Stephenson acquired the home in 1923 and remodeled it to resemble a Civil War-era plantation home. The home is one of several in the neighborhood that are interesting to <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>believe</b> in haunted houses.|$|E

Most <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>believe</b> in Taoism also ascribe to Buddhism at the same time, as the differences and boundaries between the two religions are not always clear. Many residents of the area also worship the folk sea goddess Mazu, who is variously syncretized as a Taoist immortal or avatar of the bodhisattva Guanyin. Her temple on Cijin Island is the oldest in the city, with its original bamboo-and-thatch structure first opened in 1673. The area surrounding it formed {{the center of the}} city's early settlement.|$|E

Conversely, the same {{study also found that}} <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>believed</b> more in determinism tended to support less severe punishments, and instead generally recommended therapy and reform efforts. In 1961, he gained international attention when he {{published a}} paper questioning whether or not deviants should be described as [...] "sick". His 1970 book Explanations has since become commonplace in upper-level criminology and philosophy classes throughout North America.|$|R

25|$|During the 1980s and 1990s in Norway, {{there was}} {{considerable}} and intense public debate {{on the use of}} dental amalgam. The Norwegian Dental Patients Association (Forbundet Tenner og Helse), made up of <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>believe</b> they suffered health effects from amalgam fillings, was a driving force in this debate. During this time, the media often featured interviews with people claiming that their health problems were caused by amalgam fillings, and who have regained their health after replacing their amalgam fillings with a different material. Some scientific studies also reported that patients have been restored to health after having had their amalgam fillings replaced. However, these studies were heavily disputed at the time and the Norwegian Board of Health still maintain there is no scientifically proven connection between dental amalgam and health problems.|$|E
25|$|The Antambahoaka {{share their}} origins with the Antaimoro <b>people,</b> <b>who</b> <b>believe</b> {{they are the}} descendents of an Arab named Raminia who {{migrated}} from Mecca to Madagascar between the 10th and 12th centuries. Oral tradition offers two explanations for Raminia's emigration. It is commonly said that he left to escape an increasingly rigid application of Islamic law; others attribute the departure to his search for fertile land to cultivate. The Antambahoaka split off from the Antaimoro {{in the fifteenth century}} when an Antaimoro named Ravalarivo established a new community called Masindrano that later grew to become the town of Mananjary; the neighborhood of Masindrano exists to the present day. Among some Antambahoaka it is said that Ravalarivo came to be called Ratiambahoaka (beloved by his people), and the community he founded derived its name from a deformation of this title - Antambahoaka. Very little is known about their history from the 16th to the 18th centuries.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} investigated how lay {{theories about}} resisting persua-sion can affect attitude certainty. Specifically, <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>believed</b> that resistance was negative (i. e., implies close-mindedness) showed {{different levels of}} attitude certainty after resisting per-suasive messages than <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>believed</b> resistance was posi-tive (i. e., implies intelligence). When people held positive lay the-ories of resistance and overcame ostensibly strong arguments, they showed increased attitude certainty (compared to those who overcame ostensibly weak arguments). However, individuals <b>who</b> <b>believed</b> that resistance was negative did not show increases in attitude certainty when overcoming strong arguments. Exper-iment 2 suggests {{that the effect of}} lay theories and perceived argu-ment strength on attitude certainty was due to dissonance cre-ated by believing that resistance is undesirable but nonetheless resisting persuasion...|$|R
500|$|In [...] "Lisa the Skeptic" [...] (season nine, 1997), an [...] "angel skeleton" [...] is discovered, {{much to the}} {{skepticism}} of Lisa. As Lisa rants about the <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>believe</b> it is an angel, Marge informs her that she also believes it is an angel. She tells Lisa, [...] "There {{has to be more}} life than just what we see, everyone needs something to believe in." [...] In spite of her highly debatable moral stances, Marge struggles with vices, such as a gambling addiction. While Marge has learned to cope with her addiction, it has never completely disappeared and remains an underlying problem that is referenced occasionally on the show.|$|E
500|$|Public {{concern is}} {{a major issue in}} control efforts [...] as many {{advocate}} for the protection of Brumbies, including the Aboriginal <b>people,</b> <b>who</b> <b>believe</b> feral horses belong to the country. [...] Other horse interest groups resent the labelling of horses as “feral” and are completely opposed to any measures that threaten their survival. [...] While some Animal welfare groups such as the RSPCA reluctantly accept culling, other organizations such as Save the Brumbies oppose lethal culling techniques and attempt to organise relocation of the animals instead. [...] It has been argued that relocation, which often involves hours of helicopter mustering, would be more traumatic for the horses.|$|E
500|$|Although anti-Catholicism {{had been}} a {{consistent}} platform of the Klan, before leaving the organization, Evans renounced his anti-Catholicism and pronounced a [...] "new era of religious tolerance". In 1939, he said that [...] "in no other time in history has there been more need for all <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>believe</b> in the same Father and same Son to stand together." [...] That year, Evans also publicly {{expressed an interest in}} learning aspects of Judaism to better understand the Old Testament. Chester L. Quarles, a professor of criminal justice at the University of Mississippi, argues that Evans repudiated anti-Catholicism owing to his desire to fight unions and communism and his fear of having too many enemies at one time.|$|E

500|$|Many {{philosophers}} consider {{experience to}} be the essence of consciousness, and believe that experience can only fully be known from the inside, subjectively. [...] But if consciousness is subjective and not visible from the outside, why do {{the vast majority of}} people believe that other people are conscious, but rocks and trees are not? [...] This is called the problem of other minds. [...] It is particularly acute for <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>believe</b> in the possibility of philosophical zombies, that is, people who think it is possible in principle to have an entity that is physically indistinguishable from a human being and behaves like a human being in every way but nevertheless lacks consciousness. Related issues have also been studied extensively by Greg Littmann of the University of Illinois. and Colin Allen a professor at Indiana University regarding the literature and research studying artificial intelligence in androids.|$|E
500|$|Fox made no {{promises}} that his efforts {{would lead to}} a cure for cancer, but he closed his letter with the statement: [...] "We need your help. The people in cancer clinics all over the world need <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>believe</b> in miracles. I am not a dreamer, and I am not saying that this will initiate any kind of definitive answer or cure to cancer. I believe in miracles. I have to." [...] The Cancer Society was skeptical of his dedication, but agreed to support Fox once he had acquired sponsors and requested he get a medical certificate from a heart specialist stating that he was fit to attempt the run. Fox was diagnosed with left ventricular hypertrophy– an enlarged heart– a condition commonly associated with athletes. Doctors warned Fox of the potential risks he faced, though they did not consider his condition a significant concern. They endorsed his participation when he promised that he would stop immediately if he began to experience any heart problems.|$|E
