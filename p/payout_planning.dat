Individuals will need pension and other retirement income to sustain them {{over a longer period of}} time than in the past. Moreover, the continuing trend towards pension plans with individual accounts has increased participants' responsibility for managing their pension assets during retirement. As such, our objectives were to determine: (1) what benefit payout options and accompanying information pension plans make available to participants at retirement, (2) what benefit <b>payouts</b> <b>plan</b> participants receive at retirement, and (3) the actions available to help retiring participants preserve their pension and retirement savings plan assets. ...|$|R
5000|$|Investing in annuities {{may allow}} investors to realize tax {{advantages}} {{that are not}} realized through other tax-deferred retirement accounts, such as 401k and IRAs. One of the great advantages of annuities is they allow an investor to store away large amounts of cash and defer paying taxes. There is no yearly limit to contributions for annuities. This is especially useful for those approaching retirement age {{that may not have}} saved large sums throughout previous years. The total investment compounds annually without any federal taxes. This allows each dollar in the entire investment to accrue interest, which could potentially be an advantage compared to taxable investments. Additionally, upon cashing the annuity out, the investor can decide to receive a lump-sum payment, or develop a more spread out <b>payout</b> <b>plan.</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{comparing}} {{an immediate}} life annuity with a payout-equivalent investment fund <b>payout</b> <b>plan</b> (self-annuitization), research to date has focused mainly on shortfall probabilities of self-annuitization. An exception {{can be found in}} Schmeiser and Post (2005). They propose a family strategy where the chances of self-annuitization (i. e., bequests) are taken into consideration as well. In such a family strategy, potential heirs must bear shortfall risks, but in return have a chance of receiving a bequest. This paper analyzes under which conditions heirs will be willing to agree to a family strategy. The idea of a family strategy is integrated into a realistically calibrated intertemporal expected utility framework taking into account risks arising from stochastic life span, asset returns, and nontradable labor income. A family strategy is shown to be accepted for many parameter combinations, especially in families with low marginal tax rates, if the heirs are wealthy, or in a case where the retiree has an average population life expectancy. For such families, a family strategy should be seriously considered as retirement arrangement...|$|R

40|$|Private {{employers}} {{are a major}} supplier of job displacement insurance, almost wholly {{in the form of}} severance pay. The correlated risk problem is a serious one, however, and nonperformance a concern. In a typical plan, greater benefits are paid to more highly tenured workers, so the traditional last-in, first-out layoff system leads to substantial payouts only when employment cutbacks are deep. Asymmetric information problems limit third-party insurance, but cannot explain why employers do not provide reserves to support <b>plan</b> <b>payouts.</b> Evidence from both historical and current sources suggests that employers provide severance plans in response, not to ex ante insurance demand, but to ex post morale concerns. Clearly failing firms have much weaker concerns about morale than do prosperous ones and may find it efficient to dissolve severance plans in difficult times. Surprisingly, the limited data on actual severance payments indicates that, in aggregate, the share of permanently displaced workers who receive severance payouts corresponds closely with the fraction covered by formal severance plans. This does not mean that nonperformance is not a problem, because informal payments to workers in uncovered firm...|$|R
40|$|Efforts {{to insure}} long-tenured {{displacement}} workers against earnings losses from unemployment spells and lower wages on subsequent jobs {{have led to}} an array of government and employer programs. A policy typology is proposed to impose order on these programmatic efforts. The basic typology involves the familiar distinction between (i) separation benefit type 2 ̆ 013 fixed sum severance or unemployment-linked 2 ̆ 013 and (ii) financing type 2 ̆ 013 insurance or savings. In this four-way categorization, severance savings accounts are the least familiar, perhaps because they are often mislabeled as unemployment insurance savings accounts (UISA). A third policy dimension 2 ̆ 013 the job separation events that trigger <b>plan</b> <b>payouts</b> 2 ̆ 013 is also fundamental to understanding program performance and consequences. Indeed insurance plan performance converges on that of savings plans as the range of insured events and their likelihoods expand. Severance "savings" <b>plans</b> require <b>payouts</b> other than for involuntary separation, most commonly for retirement, which highlights the link with pensions. Conversely the severance properties of pension plans vary with ownership rights (vesting) and "rollover" rules. Forced savings plans that also permit fund access for house purchases and/or human capital investments (provident funds) are an obvious extension of strict severance savings plans...|$|R
40|$|Most defined {{contribution}} {{pension plans}} pay benefits as lump sums, yet the US Treasury has recently encouraged firms to protect retirees from outliving their assets by converting {{a portion of}} their plan balances into longevity income annuities (LIA). These are deferred annuities which initiate payouts not later than age 85 and continue for life, and they provide an effective way to hedge systematic (individual) longevity risk for a relatively low price. Using a life cycle portfolio framework, we measure the welfare improvements from including LIAs in the menu of <b>plan</b> <b>payout</b> choices, accounting for mortality heterogeneity by education and sex. We find that introducing a longevity income annuity to the plan menu is attractive for most DC plan participants who optimally commit 8 - 15 % of their plan balances at age 65 to a LIA that starts paying out at age 85. Optimal annuitization boosts welfare by 5 - 20 % of average retirement plan accruals at age 66 (assuming average mortality rates), compared to not having access to the LIA. We also compare the optimal LIA allocation versus two default options that plan sponsors could implement. We conclude that an approach where a fixed fraction over a dollar threshold is invested in LIAs will be preferred by most to the status quo, while enhancing welfare for the majority of workers...|$|R
40|$|Regardless of {{the strong}} {{theoretical}} justification {{for the use of}} relative performance evaluation in setting executive compensation, previous empirical results supporting relative performance evaluation are mixed. This study contributes to the existing literature by analyzing implicit relative performance evaluation in a specific form of compensation, performance share plans. Implicit relative performance evaluation is studied with the single-year relative performance evaluation model used also in the previous research, in addition to which an adjusted long-term relative performance evaluation model is developed to account for longer term (3 -year) performance and to extend the analysis also to other executives besides the chief executive officer (CEO). The proprietary and unique data cover all the performance share plans ever used (per August 2012) in Finnish companies listed on the Nasdaq OMX Helsinki stock exchange. A total of 87 companies and 543 share plan lots are included in the initial sample. The sample for the adjusted long-term relative performance evaluation analysis consists of 53 companies and 179 performance share plan lots. The sample for the single-year relative performance evaluation analysis includes a total of 167 performance share plan lots in 42 companies which correspond to 125 single-year changes. The data include observations from year 2000 to August 2012. Although the Finnish companies do not usually use explicit relative performance evaluation in their performance share plans, the empirical evidence presented in this study indicates that companies use short-term as well as long-term implicit relative performance evaluation with respect to total shareholder returns in their performance share plans. Furthermore, CEO performance {{is more likely to be}} evaluated relative to industry performance than market performance. Relative performance evaluation is used either by implicitly setting the stock market based performance targets to a level which takes industry performance into account or by adjusting the number of granted shares from year to year. Although I find that relative performance evaluation with respect to total shareholder returns is used in performance share plans, no evidence of the use of relative performance evaluation with respect to ROA is found either in the single-year analysis or the adjusted long-term analysis. The results also show that performance share <b>plan</b> <b>payout</b> ratios are positively and statistically significantly associated with company performance even when the performance is measured during three years instead of one year which is the most common earning period length...|$|R
