40|$|Sample {{attrition}} due to <b>plant</b> <b>retirements</b> {{and ownership}} transfers that eliminated data reporting creates {{a concern about}} selection bias. Plant sales are particularly an issue in retail access states, as exempt wholesale generators (EWGs) purchased plants that incumbents were required to divest during restructuring. Since EWGs are not regulated by FERC in the traditional sense, these companies {{are not required to}} report operating data on their plants, and hence drop out of the database. If the plants dropping out of the sample were systematically higher or lower in efficiency relative to their plant-epoch effect and to surviving plants, selection bias could contaminate the restructuring estimates. One could construct plausible stories that plants selected for purchase were very efficient and thus good acquisition targets, or that inefficient plants left the database due to retirements or sales that offered the new owners the opportunity for substantial gain if efficiency could be improved. Plant exits. We have performed several analyses regarding the plants that exit our sample. Figure T 1 graphs the number of plants that exit the sample in each year by restructuring status and divestiture status.

50|$|Although gold {{production}} {{on the field}} peaked in 1899 at an impressive 337,000 ounces, {{it soon became clear}} that these grades did not continue at depth and by 1920 only one mine was still operational. People, businesses and even the more portable buildings, moved away from the town. Property prices fell and the availability of large redundant buildings in a town servicing a wide area and connected to major centres by rail suggested the possibility of schools to several churches.

5000|$|Post-1949, the Plant Memorial was vandalized. There is {{some debate}} {{about the origins of}} the Plant Memorial defacement. Some say the National Red Guards in the 1960s came in an act of {{xenophobia}} to tear down what they considered to be an honor to a foreigner. The solid granite obelisk proved difficult to raze entirely and the Red Guard expressed their sentiments by chiseling out every character and letter in the inscriptions. Others have reported the defacement came during the Land Reform Movement in the 1950s. In either case, Xintan, a Chinese community of river pilots and junk owners, had been protective of the memorial and of Plant’s contributions to them and the Yangtze.

A multi-regional unit commitment model was developed to simulate {{the behavior of the}} grid. The parameters defining the system operation were gathered from several publicly available data sources including historical hourly electricity production and fuel consumption from over one hundred power plants. Factors were estimated for a baseline year of 2011 and subsequently for the year 2025 considering planned power <b>plant</b> additions and <b>retirements.</b> Future scenarios are also developed considering different wind turbine installation growth rates and policies affecting the cost of generation from coal power plants.

40|$|This paper investigates {{current and}} planned {{investments}} in {{new power plants}} in Bosnia and Herzegovina and impact of these investments on the energy sector, CO 2 emission and internationally committed targets for electricity from renewable sources up to year 2020. Bosnia and Herzegovina possesses strong renewable energy potential, in particular hydro and biomass. However, the majority of energy production is conducted in outdated power plants and based on fossil fuels, resulting in environment pollution. New major investments The Stanari Thermal plant (300 MW) and the investment in Block 7 (450 MW) at the Thermal Plant Tuzla are again focused on fossil fuels. The power sector is also highly dependent on the hydrology as 54 % of current capacities are based on large hydro power. In order to investigate how the energy system of Bosnia and Herzegovina {{will be affected by}} these investments and hydrology, the EnergyPLAN model was used. Based on the foreseen demand for year 2020 several power plants construction and hydrology scenarios have been modelled to cover a range of possibilities that may occur. This includes export orientation of Stanari plant, impact of wet, dry and average year, delayed construction of Tuzla Block 7, constrained construction of hydro power <b>plants,</b> and <b>retirement</b> of thermal units. It can be concluded that energy system can be significantly affected by delayed investments but in order to comply with renewables targets Bosnia and Herzegovina will need to explore the power production from other renewable energy sources as well...|$|R
5000|$|During {{the years}} (1939-1950) she spent in England, she did {{chromosome}} studies {{of a wide}} range of garden plants. Her studies on chromosome numbers and ploidy in many cases threw light on the evolution of species and varieties. The Chromosome Atlas of Cultivated Plants which she wrote jointly with C. D. Darlington in 1945 was a compilation that incorporated much of her own work on many species.Ammal also worked on the genera Solanum, Datura, Mentha, Cymbopogon and Dioscorea besides medicinal and other plants. She attributed the higher rate of plant speciation in the cold and humid northeast Himalayas as compared to the cold and dry northwest Himalayas to polyploidy. [...] Also, according to her, the confluence of Chinese and Malayan elements in the flora of northeast India led to natural hybridisation between these and the native flora in this region, contributing further to <b>plant</b> diversification.Following her <b>retirement,</b> Ammal continued to work focusing special attention on medicinal plants and ethnobotany. She continued to publish the original findings of her research. In the Centre of Advanced Study Field Laboratory where she lived and worked she developed a garden of medicinal plants. She also worked on cytology and ethnobotany.|$|R
40|$|Between February 2013 and December 2014, four {{communities}} {{hosting a}} nuclear power plant in the U. S. were faced with the sudden closure of the plant. These closures were largely attributable to market changes in the energy sector, driven by sustained growth in the natural gas industry. The rise of natural gas-fired plants has recently forced several of the nation 2 ̆ 7 s older coal-fired and petroleum-based power <b>plants</b> into early <b>retirement,</b> and nuclear industry analysts suspect that the nuclear closures of the past two years may be just the beginning of a similar trend. Unfortunately, the extent of nuclear power plant closure impacts has rarely been investigated until after a plant 2 ̆ 7 s closure is announced, and only at the broader multi-county scale commonly found in economic analysis and forecasting. This project attempts to provide an improvement on both fronts: assessing an existing plant, with no plans to close, at local and regional scales. This project uses Pilgrim Nuclear Power Station as its subject of study. The plant, in Plymouth, Massachusetts, is licensed to operate until 2032. After contextualizing nuclear closure and nuclear decommissioning, the project inventories the plant 2 ̆ 7 s key characteristics as a landowner and employer. It then identifies the plant 2 ̆ 7 s current socioeconomic contributions, details its operational impacts on other segments of the local and regional economy, and estimates how the plant 2 ̆ 7 s closure would affect the town and region. This project finds that the socioeconomic impacts of closure are so significant at local and regional levels that planning and economic development agencies cannot afford to wait until closure plans are announced to engage with the topic. I conclude with recommendations for the town and the region to build the knowledge, support, and momentum necessary to ensure the success of the long-term, multi-stakeholder, and cooperative approach the plant 2 ̆ 7 s eventual closure will require...|$|R
