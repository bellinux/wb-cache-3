For the practical design of most engineering control systems, it is important to explicitly consider uncertainty within the system plant. Therefore, to design the control system within the framework of matching, practical robust matching conditions are required. This report provides su±cient conditions for a robust match for systems with plants modelled as having additive, multiplicative or factored uncertainty. Both upper and lower bounds on the su±cient conditions for a match are presented. ...|$|E

Experiment results show that this 3 D measuring machine can effectively measure the 3 D solid profile of free surface. During the evaluation test for accuracy, scan a standard plane. Fit all 3 D points in one plane, and then the flatness value of this plane is obtained. The flatness value of the standard plane has been ultimately measured as: ± 0. 0462 mm, this measuring accuracy can completely satisfy the requirements of rapid prototyping or CNC machining, it as well as achieves the stated accuracy (± 0. 05 mm) ...|$|R

Although not originally designed as a research study, it was subsequently felt that the benefits of ‘cognitive pairing’ were significant enough to be promulgated. The paper briefly summarises research in the field of matching mentors and mentees by cognitive style preference and defines the principle of ‘cognitive pairing’.

The aims of the mentoring programme and its design are outlined and the results discussed with reference to Kirkpatrick’s 4 levels of training evaluation (Kirkpatrick 1979 and 1994) and Clutterbuck’s measurements of mentoring success (Clutterbuck 2003).

To alleviate the shortage of kidney donors, many advances {{have been made to}} improve the utilization of living donors deemed incompatible with their intended recipient. The most prominent of these advances is kidney paired donation (KPD), which matches incompatible patient-donor pairs to facilitate a kidney exchange. This review discusses the various approaches to matching and allocation in KPD. In particular, it focuses on the underlying <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>matching</b> and allocation approaches, the combination of KPD with other strategies such as ABO incompatible transplantation, the organization of KPD, and important future challenges.

In this light, challenges include making full use of the various modalities that are now available through integrated and optimized <b>matching</b> software, encouragement <b>of</b> transplant centers to fully participate, improving transplant rates by focusing on the expected long-run number of transplants, and selecting uniform allocation criteria to facilitate international pools. © 2013 Steunstichting ESOT...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{intends to}} provide {{theoretical}} basis for matching design of hydraulic load simulator (HLS) with aerocraft actuator in hardware-in-loop test, {{which is expected}} to help actuator designers overcome the obstacles in putting forward appropriate requirements of HLS. Traditional research overemphasizes the optimization of parameters and methods for HLS controllers. It lacks deliberation because experimental results and project experiences indicate different ultimate performance of a specific HLS. When the actuator paired with this HLS is replaced, the dynamic response and tracing precision of this HLS also change, and sometimes the whole system {{goes so far as to}} lose control. Based on the influence analysis of the preceding phenomena, a theory about matching design of aerocraft actuator with HLS is presented, together with two paired new concepts of “Standard Actuator” and “Standard HLS”. Further research leads to seven important conclusions of matching design, which suggest that appropriate stiffness and output torque of HLS should be carefully designed and chosen for an actuator. Simulation results strongly support that the proposed <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>matching</b> design can be anticipated to be one of the design criteria for HLS, and successfully used to explain experimental phenomena and project experiences...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that different providers of social welfare tend to provide complementary services at a local level, but that there is no complete task specialisation. This means that elements of complementarity theory are challenged, especially the so-called 'principle of matching', i. e. that actors only undertake tasks which match their characteristics. The aim {{of the present study was}} to explore complementarity between Swedish local authorities and voluntary organisations in their support for relatives of older people. Interviews were carried out with 55 politicians, civil servants and representatives of voluntary organisations drawn from four municipalities. These municipalities were selected from a sampling frame that ensured representation of different combinations of high and low levels of voluntary and statutory services. Qualitative analysis of interview transcripts showed that, while local authorities are seen as responsible for the support for relatives, voluntary organisations are expected to be complementary, offering 'the icing on the cake', i. e. social support and activities which are regarded as less demanding. Overall, substantial support for a norm of complementarity was found. It is argued that, if those who are active in social policy and voluntary work at a local level agree with the ideal of complementarity, this will influence their wish to arrange activities and services. Therefore, the complementarity norm – rather than the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>matching</b> – influences the outcome in terms of service provision. </p...|$|E
40|$|Non-functioning of an intensively studied relationship, the {{one between}} pistil and pollen in {{flowering}} plants, {{has generally been}} associated with incompatibility. An evolutionary study in Lycopersicon and related research demonstrated {{the existence of an}} independent second mechanism for nonfunctioning. The nature of this second mechanism is explained by a model in which the pistil-pollen relationship is based on matching genic systems. A lack of genetic information in the pollen about some relevant process in the pistil will cause non-functioning of the pistil-poIlen relationship. For this phenomenon the term incongruity is proposed. Evolution and genetics of incongruity are different from those of incompatibility. Whereas incompatibility is an exception and compatibility the rule, incongruity is the rule and congruity an exception. Reinterpretation of earlier research is necessary. It shows that in interspecific crosses incongruity plays a major role, whereas incompatibility is secondary or absent. Evolution of self-compatible species, genetics of crossability in interspecific hybrids and later generations, complex patterns of crossability between populations and S -gene polymorphism can all be reinterpreted on the same basis: the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>matching</b> genic systems. It is shown that properties have been ascribed to the S -gene, which are in fact based on other genes and other principles.
