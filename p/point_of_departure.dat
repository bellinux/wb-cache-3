5|$|At {{the end of}} the 3rd {{millennium}} BC, Erbil {{is mentioned}} in historical records of the Ur III period as Urbilum. King Shulgi destroyed Urbilum in his 43rd regnal year, and during the reign of his successor Amar-Sin, Urbilum was incorporated into the Ur III state. In the 18th century BC, Erbil appears in a list of cities that were conquered by Shamshi-Adad of Upper Mesopotamia and Dadusha of Eshnunna during their campaign against the land of Qabra. Shamshi-Adad installed garrisons in all the cities of the land of Urbil. During the 2nd millennium BC, Erbil was incorporated into Assyria.

5|$|In two years, a {{very precise}} map, drawn on six sheets at a 1/200,000 scale, was produced. In March 1829, {{a base of}} 3,500 meters had been traced in the Argolis, from one angle at the ruins of Tiryns to an angle of a house in ruins {{in the village of}} Aria. This was {{intended}} to serve as a <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>departure</b> in all the triangulation operations for topographic and geodesic readings in the Peloponnese. Pierre Peytier and Puillon-Boblaye proceeded to perform numerous verifications on the base and on the rulers used. The margin of error was thus reduced to 1 meter for every 15 kilometers. The longitude and latitude of the base point at Tiryns were read and checked, so that again the margin of error was reduced as far as possible to an estimated 0.2 seconds. 134 geodesic stations were set up on the peninsula’s mountains, as well as on Aegina, Hydra and Nafplion. Thus, equilateral triangles whose sides measured about 20km were drawn. The angles were measured with theodolites by Gambey.|$|E

40|$|<b>Points</b> <b>of</b> <b>departure</b> for {{the state}} in the Institutes of Calvin {{compared}} with <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>departure</b> <b>of</b> the South African Bill of Rights (1996) In the last chapter of his “Institutes” the reformer John Calvin (1509 - 1564) concentrates on <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>departure</b> {{for the state}} and on the task of the state government. Calvin is strongly influenced by the Bible and sees the state government as being ordained by God to exercise justice in society. For him justice and fairness should be the norm for every law created by the state.   The South African “Bill of Rights” is regarded as the highest law in the country. To prevent chaos or people exercising the law wrongly, the Constitution with the “Bill of Rights” in the final instance should be interpreted by the Constitutional Court. This makes South Africa a just state or a society governed by the constitution or law.   Although Calvin, like the “Bill of Rights”, has a feeling for justice to all, he and the Bill part company on the important issue that the state should be seen as a servant of God...|$|R
