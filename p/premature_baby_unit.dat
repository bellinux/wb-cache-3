50|$|The use of {{phototherapy}} {{was first}} discovered, accidentally, at Rochford Hospital in Essex, England. The ward sister (nurse) of the <b>premature</b> <b>baby</b> <b>unit</b> firmly {{believed that the}} infants under her care benefited from fresh air and sunlight in the courtyard. Although {{this led to the}} first noticing of jaundice being improved with sunlight, further studies only progressed when a vial of blood sent for bilirubin measurement sat on a windowsill in the lab for several hours. The results indicated a much lower level of bilirubin than expected based on the patient's visible jaundice. Further investigation led to the determination that blue light, wavelength of 420-480 nm (peak 458 nm), caused transformation of the trans bilirubin to cis bilirubin, a soluble product that does not contribute to kernicterus. Although some pediatricians began using phototherapy in the United Kingdom following Dr. Cremer's publishing the above facts in the Lancet in 1958, most hospitals only began to regularly use phototherapy ten years later when an American group independently made the same discovery.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{incidence}} of premature births {{is on the}} increase in the world. Currently there are approximately 15 million babies which are born prematurely in the world. 60 % of these births are in Africa and South-Asia. There is a higher {{incidence of}} premature births in lower income countries. Factors associated with the higher incidence of the birth of pre-term babies are: The incidence of acquired immune deficiency disorder, fertility treatment, maternal diabetes, hypertension, maternal age and an increase in caesarean sections before term. However more and smaller pre-term babies are surviving their premature birth. The premature birth of a baby presents several challenges to the parents of the <b>premature</b> <b>baby.</b> <b>Premature</b> <b>babies,</b> depending on how pre-term they are born, are cared for in intensive care units. Intensive care units are primarily focused on the physical well-being of the <b>premature</b> <b>baby</b> although some <b>units</b> make use of kangaroo care as part of the treatment plan. The highly technological environment of the intensive care unit is disruptive in terms of the bonding between parents and their <b>premature</b> <b>babies.</b> Little research has been done on how the experiences of parents of <b>premature</b> <b>babies</b> can be used to promote their mental health. The question can be asked: What are the experiences of parents with <b>premature</b> <b>babies</b> {{in the intensive care unit}} and how can the parents be supported to promote their mental health? A theory generative, qualitative, exploratory, descriptive and contextual research design was used to do this research study. Fieldwork was done by phenomenological interviewing with parents of <b>premature</b> <b>babies</b> in an intensive care unit. The findings were analysed and categorised and then contextualised when a literature control was done. Findings were validated in this way. Results obtained showed that parents of <b>premature</b> <b>babies</b> in an intensive care unit experience strong thoughts and emotions. They also experience hope for themselves and their <b>premature</b> <b>babies</b> [...] . D. Cur. (Psychiatric Nursing...|$|R

40|$|As {{a result}} of a {{clinical}} trial carried out in these hospitals (Gaisford and Jennison, 1955), which showed that the intramuscular administration of an iron-dextran complex to premature babies in the newborn period could effectively prevent the anaemia of prematurity, iron by this route was given to babies in the <b>premature</b> <b>baby</b> <b>unit,</b> whose haemoglobin levels fell below 80 % (11 7 g.) before their discharge from the unit. Early in 1960, when it was reported that the intra-muscular preparation of iron in common use might carry a risk of tumour production at the site of injection (Brit. med.

Not all babies with incipient or established respiratory failure, however, could be accepted, and those declined had unfavourable outcomes. In 1981 local intensive and ventilatory care was begun, and since then the survival of all babies has improved considerably.

The {{purpose of the study}} was to determine what effect slow baroque. music has on the heart rate, respiratory rate, saturation, blood pressure and motor movements of <b>premature</b> <b>babies.</b> The effect of slow baroque music on <b>premature</b> <b>babies</b> was investigated by means of an extensive literature study, but only limited research on <b>premature</b> <b>babies</b> was found. A preparatory study was used to determine whether slow baroque music has a positive effect on the behaviour of <b>premature</b> <b>babies.</b> Ten <b>premature</b> <b>babies</b> were then used as case studies to determine the effect of slow baroque music on their heart and respiratory rates, saturation, blood pressure and motor movements. The following conclusions were reached by statistically processing the results: • Slow baroque music had a positive and significant effect on the babies' respiratory rate and motor movements. • The heart rate, saturation and blood pressure of the babies showed a slight positive effect only. Nursing guidelines were established for playing baroque music to <b>premature</b> <b>babies</b> and recommendations were made for further research...|$|R

40|$|Background : Many of the 15 million <b>premature</b> <b>babies</b> born {{worldwide}} {{every year}} survive because of advanced medical interventions. Their parents have intense experiences when their babies {{are in the}} intensive care unit (ICU), and these have an impact on their thoughts, feelings and relationships, including their relationships with their <b>premature</b> <b>babies.</b> Objectives : The aim of the study was to explore and describe the lived experiences of parents of <b>premature</b> <b>babies</b> in an ICU. Method : Research design was qualitative, exploratory, descriptive and contextual. A purposive sample of parents with <b>premature</b> <b>babies</b> in an ICU in a private hospital in Johannesburg Gauteng in South Africa was used. Eight parents, four mothers and four fathers, married and either Afrikaans or English-speaking, were included in the study. Data were collected by conducting in-depth phenomenological interviews with them and making use of field notes. Trustworthiness was ensured by implementing the strategies of credibility, transferability, dependability and confirmability. Ethical principles such as autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence and justice were adhered to throughout the research process. Results : Thematic analyses were utilised to analyse the data. Two themes in the experiences of parents with <b>premature</b> <b>babies</b> in ICU became apparent. Parents experienced thoughts, emotions and hope while their <b>premature</b> <b>babies</b> were in the ICU as well as challenges in their relationships and these challenges influenced their experiences. Recommendations : Mindfulness of intensive care nurses should be facilitated so that intensive care nurses can promote the mental health of parents with <b>premature</b> <b>babies</b> in the ICU. Conclusion : Parents with <b>premature</b> <b>babies</b> in the ICU have thoughts and emotional experiences which include hope and they affect parents’ relationships...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, Pseudomonas pyocyanea {{and other}} Gram-negative {{bacteria}} have appeared more fre-quently as important pathogens.

40|$|SYNOPSIS Three {{cases of}} {{neonatal}} meningitis, {{two of which}} were fatal, occurred in a <b>premature</b> <b>baby</b> <b>unit</b> {{during a period of}} one week. A fourth case occurred in the same unit six nmionths later. Citrobacter koseri was isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid of all four cases. Detailed biochemical and serological examination of the organisms showed that two distinct bioserotypes were involved. The final taxonomic position of the organisms variously described as Citrobacter koseri (Frederik-sen, 1970), Citrobacter diversus (Ewing and Davis, 1972), and Levinea malonatica (Young, Kenton, Hobbs, and Moody, 1971) has yet to be determined. Their clinical importance is also uncertain, although it seems clear that such organisms occur frequently in clinical specimens.

40|$|A fatal case {{associated}} with severe hyperammonaemia {{is described in}} which no urea cycle enzyme deficiency could be found. This prompted further investigation of blood ammonia levels in neonates admitted to the <b>premature</b> <b>baby</b> <b>unit</b> at Hammersmith Hospital. 102 specimens were taken from 42 babies within the first 3 weeks of life; the babies had a variety of clinical conditions. The mean ammonia level was 94. 5 mumol/l (132. 3 micrograms/ 100 ml) (range 32 - 255 mumol/l) (44. 8 - 357 micrograms/ml), SD +/- 41. 0). These results, although higher than the range for older babies in hospital, were {{not as high as}} in the baby with severe hyperammonaemia. Serial levels in 10 babies suggested that the range of blood ammonia levels was greatest in the first 2 weeks of life and narrowed considerably after this period.

40|$|At {{the start}} of this {{interview}} Dr Beryl Corner, pioneering paediatrician and neonatologist, talks of her family and childhood in Bristol, and her decision to study medicine at the London School of Medicine for Women where she qualified with the London and conjoint degrees in 1934. House jobs at the Royal Free Hospital and Bristol Royal Infirmary and a year's employment at the Bristol Children's Hospital followed, and she gained her MD and MRCP in 1936. Dr Corner then discusses her decision to specialise in paediatric medicine, six months as a house physician at the Brompton which gave her valuable experience in chest medicine, initial difficulties in getting a position as a female doctor and her eventual appointment as honorary physician for the outpatient department at Bristol Children's Hospital. The interview then moves on to her wartime experiences with the Emergency Medical Service throughout the South West Region, and her growing reputation as a consultant and university lecturer. Dr Corner speaks of her developing interest in neonatology, developing a comprehensive service for premature and sick newborn babies across Bristol, and establishing a <b>premature</b> <b>baby</b> <b>unit</b> at Southmead Hospital in 1946. She describes her friendship with Mary Crosse (of Birmingham), treating her first case of rhesus incompatibility in a newborn baby in 1942, and the birth of the Good Quadruplets - the first quadruplets in the world born by caesarean section to survive - at Southmead. Next, Dr Corner reflects on the continued problems and hostility she faced as a female paediatrician {{in the early years of}} her career, and her work with the paediatric section at the Royal Society of Medicine and the British Paediatric Association. She summarises her views on whether paediatricians should break away or remain with the Royal College of Physicians. She then outlines the early use of penicillin during war, and more generally the impact of antibiotics on paediatric medicine and neonatology. At the end of the interview Dr Corner looks back on her international work in neonatology with the World Health Organisation. She discusses ethical dilemmas that arise in the care of neonates and premature babies, and the impact of organisations such as Women in Medicine both in the medical profession and across other areas of life...|$|E

40|$|Este estudo foi motivado pelas inquietações surgidas durante a experiência profissional da pesquisadora, no trabalho com recém-nascidos prematuros e seus familiares. Trata-se de pesquisa do tipo descritivo, com obtenção e tratamento de dados qualitativos, que teve como objetivo identificar a vivência da mãe de recém-nascido prematuro, egresso de Unidade Neonatal, e sobre o cuidado do bebê, no domicílio. O projeto foi aprovado pela Comissão de Ensino e Pesquisa do Hospital Estadual de Sumaré, campo de estudo, e pelo Comitê de Ética em Pesquisa da Universidade Estadual de Campinas (UNICAMP). Foram entrevistadas 12 mães, no retorno ambulatorial do bebê prematuro, após aproximadamente 10 dias da alta da Unidade Neonatal. Os dados foram coletados, no período de julho a outubro de 2008, por meio de entrevistas e tratados pela técnica do Discurso do Sujeito Coletivo (DSC) proposto por Fernando Lefèvre. Dos relatos obtidos, emergiram oito DSCs assim distribuídos: 1 -Vivenciando o cuidado do prematuro; 2 -Reproduzindo o que aprendeu na unidade neonatal; 3 -Tentando atender às necessidades do prematuro; 4 -Falando de aleitamento; 5 -Recebendo ajuda dos familiares; 6 -Expressando sentimentos de satisfação; 7 -Citando a Cartilha da Unidade Neonatal e 8 -Expressando dificuldade para cuidar do prematuro. Os resultados revelam a importância da Unidade Canguru que possibilita à mãe receber orientações contínuas sobre o cuidado do bebê prematuro, em Unidade Neonatal, de modo a habilitá-la para atender com segurança às demandas do filho, no domicílio. Outro dado de relevância é que as mães consultam a Cartilha de orientação oferecida pelo serviço, apenas diante de alguma dúvida sobre o cuidado a ser oferecido ao bebê prematuro, dispensando sua completa leitura. Os relatos revelam que as estratégias para a capacitação materna para o cuidado do prematuro devem ser adotadas pelas unidades neonatais desde a admissão do recém-nascido, de modo a proporcionar maior segurança no desenvolvimento de habilidades no cuidado do filho e para favorecer a criação do vínculo entre ambosThis {{study is}} the result of anxieties brought about the authors {{professional}} experience working with premature newborns and their families. This is a descriptive research, with gathering and treatment of qualitative data, aimed at identifying the experience of premature newborns mothers released from Neonatal Units with regards to the babys care at home. The project had approved of the Teaching and Research Commission of the Sumaré State Hospital, field of study, and the State University of Campinas Committee of Ethics in Research. Twelve mothers were interviewed in the follow-up visits of <b>premature</b> <b>babies</b> approximately 10 days after release from the Neonatal Unit. Data were collected between July and October of 2008 through interviews and treated with the technique of the Discourse of the Collective Subject (DCS) proposed by Fernando Lefèvre. From the descriptions emerged 8 DCSs, grouped as follows: 1 -Experiencing the care for the premature baby; 2 -Reproducing what was learned in the Neonatal Unit; 3 -Trying to fulfill the <b>premature</b> <b>babys</b> needs; 4 Speaking about breast feedind; 5 -Being helped by family members; 6 -Expressing feelings of satisfaction; 7 -Quoting the Neonatal Units guide book; and 8 -Expressing difficulty to care for the <b>premature</b> <b>baby.</b> The results reveal the importance of the Kangaroo Unit, which makes possible for mothers to receive continuous guidance regarding the care for <b>premature</b> <b>babies</b> in Neonatal <b>Units</b> so as to enable them to securely respond to their childs demands at home. Another relevant piece of information is that mothers check the guide book that the service gives them only if theres a doubt regarding the kind of care that should be given to the <b>premature</b> <b>baby,</b> rather than fully reading it. The narratives show that the strategies to build the capacity of mothers to care for <b>premature</b> <b>babies</b> should be adopted by neonatal units since the newborn is taken in, so as to provide more security in the development of abilities in the care for the child and to encourage the creation of ties between the...|$|R
