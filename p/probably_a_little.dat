5|$|Because medieval Scotland {{lacked the}} {{intrusive}} government and growing bureaucracy {{that can be}} found in contemporaneous England, there is very little evidence on which to base reliable estimates of population before the early 18th century. On the basis that it had roughly a sixth of the farmable land of England, {{it has been suggested that}} the population would have been of a similar proportion, <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> less than a million at its height before the Black Death reached the country in 1349. Although there is no reliable documentation on the impact of the plague, there are many anecdotal references to abandoned land in the following decades. If the pattern followed that in England, then the population may have fallen to as low as half a million by the end of the 15th century. Compared with the situation after the redistribution of population in the later clearances and the industrial revolution, these numbers would have been relatively evenly spread over the kingdom, with roughly half living north of the Tay. Perhaps ten per cent of the population lived in one of fifty burghs that existed at the beginning of the period, mainly in the east and south. It has been suggested that they would have had a mean population of about 2,000, but many would be much smaller than 1,000 and the largest, Edinburgh, probably had a population of over 10,000 by the end of the era.|$|E

25|$|He scored his 212 against Canterbury in 260 minutes. He {{opened the}} batting {{on the first}} day, was 103 not out at lunch, and was fourth out not long after tea with the score at 343, on a day in which Wellington scored 494 for 9 wickets off 94 eight-ball overs. So {{he is likely to}} have scored at a little under a run a ball. His 204 a few weeks later was <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> slower, but no less impressive: he came to the wicket at 18 for 1, reached his double-century in 262 minutes, and was last out in a team total of 374 off 85.1 overs.|$|E

50|$|In 1895, a Japanese firm, Hemmi, {{started to}} make slide rules from bamboo, which had the {{advantages}} of being dimensionally stable, strong, and naturally self-lubricating. These bamboo slide rules were introduced in Sweden in September, 1933, and <b>probably</b> only <b>a</b> <b>little</b> earlier in Germany. Scales were made of celluloid, plastic, or painted aluminium. Later cursors were acrylics or polycarbonates sliding on Teflon bearings.|$|R

500|$|Fink {{does not}} know how long her {{character}} will be featured on Glee. When asked about what she likes about her character, Fink said: [...] "I think what I love about Lauren is she's so strong and so confident and she knows what she wants and I feel very blessed to play a role model for people who have ever felt other or different. I remember how I used to feel watching TV and seeing Sara Rue on Popular because she was an inspiration to me. It's funny because what I love about Lauren is that she's unapologetic and she's confident and she's making Puck work for it and she's not just looking for a roll in the hay. I think that they are very sweet together, there is this vulnerability when they are both such bad asses and you put them together and I think there is something really special there. What I appreciate about Lauren is that she's like I don't need to give it to you, you're going to work for it, and I think that's a great message to send to young girls. I think that he is smitten and she is <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> smitten too but I think she has enough self esteem not to give everything up for the charming cute boy that's kind of after her." [...] Kevin Fallon, a writer for The Atlantic, reacted favorably to the casting of Fink: [...] "Glee hit the trifecta this year with its three major cast additions. First there were Darren Criss—who's exploded with popularity—and Chord Overstreet. Now there's Ashley Fink's Lauren. And while the tough-only-on-the-outside Lauren can deliciously out-sass Santana Lopez, it's her straight-talking that really has me sold." ...|$|E

Penn vs. MacDonald eventually took place on December 8, 2012 at UFC on Fox 5. [...] Penn lost the fight via unanimous decision. After the fight Dana White stated that he'd like to see B.J.

2500|$|The game's {{publication}} {{took place}} in Spencer, Indiana, and upon its release was shipped to retail chains such as Fry's Electronics, Egghead Software and CompUSA. The design of the game cover closely mimicked that of the Windows 95 packaging. During development, Parroty Interactive had planned to promote the game at the COMDEX computer expo by Fall in 1997. The presentation was to include a Bill Gates lookalike. However the staff were expelled by security from the convention and the distribution plan was shut down. Despite this setback, the company presented their product at the Macworld expo in Silicon Valley, San Francisco next January, receiving praise from Macintosh users. At the event they demoed the CEO-themed Tamagotchi spoof [...] "Billagotchi", and [...] "Windows Exploder" [...] game where players blows away error messages. CD copies of the game were sold in a booth for $20 each. Microsoft also debuted some new products at Macworld such as Office 98 and Internet Explorer 4.0.

2500|$|Unferth {{is portrayed}} by John Malkovich. Malkovich became {{involved}} in the project because one of his friends, who had worked with Zemeckis, [...] "spoke very highly of him. I had always found him a very interesting and innovative filmmaker. I liked the script very much and I liked the group involved and the process interested me a great deal also." [...] He found the experience of working with motion capture to be similar to his experiences working in the theater. He also found the process intriguing: [...] "Say you do a normal day of filmmaking. Sometimes that’s 1/8 of a page, sometimes it’s 3/8th of a page, normally let’s say it’s 2½ pages, maybe 3. Now it’s <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more {{than it used to be}} but not always. So you may be acting for a total of 20 minutes a day. In this, you act the entire day all the time except for the tiny amount of time it takes them to sort of coordinate the computer information, let’s say, and make sure that the computers are reading the data and that you’re transmitting the data. It interests me on that level because I’m a professional actor so I’d just as soon act as sit around." [...] Malkovich also recalled that he studied the original poem in high school, and that “I think we got smacked if we couldn’t recite a certain number of stanzas. It was in the Old English class and I think my rendition was exemplary." ...|$|E
2500|$|Many {{witnesses}} {{found it}} difficult to lie effectively when the Court already had enough circumstantial evidence to use in probing their answers.

The Court's notes say that Kenneth Day [...] "admits he is <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> tainted. Mind poisoned." [...] Ernest Roberts claimed he was [...] "led astray" [...] by Cyril Wilcox and that Kenneth Day, too, had been [...] "led into it by Wilcox–but not of his own free will." [...] Joseph Lumbard described parties where men danced together and others dressed in women's clothes. The Court noted: [...] "some kissing witnessed." [...] Asked why he did not leave such a party, he allowed that he [...] "stayed because he was interested." [...] He had not masturbated for 6 years. Nathaniel Wolff detailed mutual masturbation with Keith Smerage, but claimed to have ended such behavior. [...] "He was fighting hard and felt that he had overcome the habit. Says he is 90% OK." [...] Keith Smerage in turn said he had not masturbated in 9 months and in college [...] "had not slept with men in the unnatural sense." [...] Later the Court recorded that he said he had [...] "'fooled' around with the homosexual business" [...] once or twice at Harvard. Stanley Gilkey defended reading Havelock Ellis: [...] "I think a man should know everything." [...] Assistant Professor of Philosophy Donald Clark [...] "denied any connection with homosexualism, and he denied talking about it except to help some students to cure themselves."
