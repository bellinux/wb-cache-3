This content clashed with Nintendo's strict content <b>policy</b> <b>guidelines.</b> The PlayStation port was also prevented from being localized by Sony's then-current approval policy.

25|$|Details of Timesitheus' {{policies}} and achievements as the (probable) de facto {{ruler of the}} Empire {{during the reign of}} his son-in-law are sparse. There is evidence of substantial road repairs undertaken {{in many parts of the}} Roman World which would have been of economic and strategic significance. Monuments were restored in major cities which might have lifted civilian morale as well as providing employment for sculptors, stonemasons etc. It also seems that there was a thoroughgoing adjustment of the African frontier. It is not possible to tell how far such measures reflected <b>policy</b> <b>guidelines</b> issued by Timesitheus' office to provincial authorities, still less what detailed planning was carried out there. The most that can be said with any confidence is that he does not seem to have stood in the way of functionaries, such as the procurator of Mauretania, who conceived and drove forward such works.|$|E
25|$|During her {{tenure at}} ICANN from 2005-2007, and her {{service to the}} Council of the GNSO (Generic Names Supporting Organization), Bekele was {{instrumental}} in initiating policy dialogue over IDNs as well as developing the framework for leading a language group. Bekele led an active campaign to introduce IDNs under which new Internet Domain names in Arabic, Cyrillic, Russian, Chinese and non-Latin alphabets will become available, thereby providing non-English/non-Latin language native speakers an opportunity to access and communicate on the Internet in their native languages. She forged to form an IDN working group within ICANN to bring the global voices of the IDN stakeholders to ICANN. Bekele was then nominated to chair ICANN’s IDN Working Group at gNSO and was highly influential in drafting the IDN <b>policy</b> <b>guidelines.</b> As a result, Bekele was credited for successfully championing {{the inclusion of the}} global IDN community within this policy dialogue and championing the work of IDNs at ICANN. This global IDN group, which later on organized itself as the International Domain Resolution Union (IDRU) gave a testimonial to Bekele's work over IDNs.

25|$|In 2008, Barroso {{steadily}} won {{support from}} leaders {{for a second}} term as president, Nicolas Sarkozy and Silvio Berlusconi both declared their support for Barroso, though Barroso himself stated {{it is up to the}} political parties in Parliament. On 19 July 2008 Barroso stated for the first time that he was seeking a second term and was backed by the EPP for re-election. In the 2009 elections, the EPP maintained their position as largest party, though without an absolute majority even with the support of other parties to their right. Yet the second and third largest groups, the PES and ALDE, failed to put forward an alternative candidate to challenge Barroso even if they had won. Despite this, a loose red-green-yellow coalition (the PES/S and ALDE with The Greens–European Free Alliance) formed against Barroso in an attempt to gain concessions from him. They demanded Barroso set out clearly his <b>policy</b> <b>guidelines</b> for his next term and offer key posts in the Commission to their group members. They also attempted to push the vote back beyond the ratification date for the Treaty of Lisbon to have more power over his appointment.|$|E

Each of them corresponds to a constituent of the education system, but this classification or division makes the internal structures of the education system more transparent so that the assessment can be made easier and more feasible. These <b>policies</b> and <b>guidelines</b> should take the globalization into account. The establishment should be done by first collecting all the relevant information in JAIST, and then classifying into the four categories above.

Singapore Tourist Promotion Board (1997), one of the issues before the Singapore High Court was whether the Port of Singapore Authority (PSA) had fettered its discretion by applying a guideline of not allocating berths at the Singapore Cruise Centre to cruise ships unless over a three-month period 30% or fewer of the cruises in a cruise operator's schedule consisted of [...] "cruises-to-nowhere". Such cruises, which left Singapore's territorial waters and returned to Singapore without calling at any other destination port, tended to be mainly for gambling purposes.|$|E
