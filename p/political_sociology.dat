5|$|<b>Political</b> <b>sociology</b> {{has also}} moved beyond methodological {{nationalism}} and analysed {{the role of}} non-governmental organizations, the diffusion of the nation-state throughout the Earth as a social construct, {{and the role of}} stateless entities in the modern world society. Contemporary political sociologists also study inter-state interactions and human rights.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary <b>political</b> <b>sociology</b> {{includes}} {{these areas}} of research, {{but it has}} been opened up to wider questions of power and politics. Today political sociologists are as likely to be concerned with how identities are formed that contribute to structural domination by one group over another; the politics of who knows how and with what authority; and questions of how power is contested in social interactions {{in such a way as}} to bring about widespread cultural and social change. Such questions are more likely to be studied qualitatively. The study of social movements and their effects has been especially important in relation to these wider definitions of politics and power.|$|E
5|$|Weber's most {{influential}} work was on economic sociology, <b>political</b> <b>sociology,</b> and {{the sociology of}} religion. Along with Karl Marx and Émile Durkheim, he is commonly {{regarded as one of}} the founders of modern sociology. But whereas Durkheim, following Comte, worked in the positivist tradition, Weber was instrumental in developing an antipositivist, hermeneutic, tradition in the social sciences. In this regard he belongs to a similar tradition as his German colleagues Werner Sombart, Georg Simmel, and Wilhelm Dilthey, who stressed the differences between the methodologies appropriate to the social and the natural sciences.|$|E

25|$|Social network {{analysis}} {{is an example}} of a new paradigm in the positivist tradition. The influence of social {{network analysis}} is pervasive in many sociological sub fields such as economic sociology (see the work of J. Clyde Mitchell, Harrison White, or Mark Granovetter, for example), organizational behavior, historical sociology, <b>political</b> <b>sociology,</b> or the sociology of education. There is also a minor revival of a more independent, empirical sociology in the spirit of C. Wright Mills, and his studies of the Power Elite in the United States of America, according to Stanley Aronowitz.|$|E
500|$|Historically, <b>political</b> <b>sociology</b> {{concerned}} {{the relations between}} political organization and society. A typical research question in this area might be: [...] "Why do so few American citizens choose to vote?" [...] In this respect questions of political opinion formation brought {{about some of the}} pioneering uses of statistical survey research by Paul Lazarsfeld. A major subfield of <b>political</b> <b>sociology</b> developed in relation to such questions, which draws on comparative history to analyse socio-political trends. The field developed from the work of Max Weber and Moisey Ostrogorsky.|$|E

500|$|One {{reason why}} Power {{might be more}} obscure than {{competing}} texts in political philosophy {{is that it is}} written in a historical style which is not in keeping with its own theoretical goals. Willis remarked that, with hindsight, [...] "Some of the responsibility for its tepid reception... rests with the book itself. A work of <b>political</b> <b>sociology</b> rather than of political theory, it does not in fact either offer a comprehensive new social analysis or fashion new tools of social investigation applicable to the study of power in all times or places." [...] (Russell 1938:xxv) ...|$|E
500|$|In <b>political</b> <b>sociology,</b> one of Weber's most {{influential}} contributions is his [...] "Politics as a Vocation" [...] (Politik als Beruf) essay. Therein, Weber unveils {{the definition of}} the state as that entity that possesses a monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force. Weber wrote that politics is the sharing of state's power between various groups, and political leaders are those who wield this power. A politician must not be a man of the [...] "true Christian ethic", understood by Weber as being the ethic of the Sermon on the Mount, that is to say, the injunction to turn the other cheek. An adherent of such an ethic ought rather to be understood to be a saint, for it is only saints, according to Weber, that can appropriately follow it. The political realm is no realm for saints; a politician ought to marry the ethic of attitude and the ethic of responsibility (" [...] vs [...] ") and must possess both a passion for his vocation and the capacity to distance himself from the subject of his exertions (the governed).|$|E
500|$|In 1962, Ranariddh {{enrolled}} in the law faculty at the University of Provence (now part of Aix-Marseille University). He obtained his bachelor's and master's degrees in 1968 and 1969 respectively, specialising in Public Law. After completing his master's, Ranariddh took the PhD qualifying examinations in 1969. He returned to Cambodia in January 1970, and worked briefly as a secretary at the Interior Ministry. When Lon Nol staged a successful coup against Sihanouk in March 1970, Ranariddh was dismissed from his job and fled into the jungle {{where he was a}} close associate of resistance leaders. In 1971, Ranariddh was captured, along with several members of the royal family, and was held in prison for six months before being released. He was rearrested the following year, and spent a further three months in detention. In 1973, Ranariddh returned to the University of Provence, where he completed his PhD in 1975. Between 1976 and 1979, he worked as a research fellow at the CNRS, and was awarded a diploma of higher studies in air transport. In 1979 Ranariddh went back to the University of Provence [...] as an associate professor, teaching courses in constitutional law and <b>political</b> <b>sociology.</b>|$|E

2500|$|In 1990, he {{published}} an autobiography, a brief [...] "sociological biography" [...] {{rather than one}} that is intellectual or intimate. This was Daydreams and nightmares: [...] Reflections on a Harlem childhood, for which he received the National Jewish Book Award. It is an unromanticized look at growing up {{as the son of}} Russian-Jewish immigrants in the streets of predominantly black Harlem, New York City, in the 1930s. Among his most recent books are Tributes: Personal reflections on a century of social research; and Behemoth: Main currents in the history and theory of <b>political</b> <b>sociology.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Mihai Dumitru Ralea (also {{known as}} Mihail Ralea, Michel Raléa, or Mihai Rale; May 1, 1896 – August 17, 1964) was a Romanian social scientist, {{cultural}} journalist, and political figure. He debuted as {{an affiliate of}} Poporanism, the left-wing agrarian movement, which he infused with influences from corporatism and Marxism. A distinguished product of French academia, Ralea rejected traditionalism and welcomed cultural modernization, outlining the program for a secular and democratic [...] "peasant state". His ideology blended into his scholarly work, with noted contributions to <b>political</b> <b>sociology,</b> the sociology of culture, and social and national psychology. He was {{a professor at the}} University of Iași and, from 1938, the University of Bucharest.|$|E
2500|$|Over {{the several}} decades {{until his death}} Horowitz worked to develop a <b>political</b> <b>sociology</b> that can measure the extent of a society's {{personal}} freedom and State-sanctioned violence. As {{a result of his}} work, a standard for {{the quality of life in}} any particular nation or social system has been constructed based on the number of people arbitrarily killed, maimed, injured, incarcerated, or deprived of basic civil liberties. Horowitz tried to build a bridge between his current analysis of state power and authority and his earlier studies of comparative international stratification and development. He was key to introducing the phrase [...] "Third World" [...] into the lexicon of social research. Horowitz articulated the view that republication of previous publications in different formats is necessary in the social sciences to disseminate research results and make them useful to society.|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{its history}} with the West, Iran has said it {{would like to see}} a warming in relations. Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, the {{chairman}} of the Expediency Council and the Assembly of Experts, has said that Iran is not seeking enmity with the U.S. and that Iran would respond to any [...] "formal" [...] message which contained [...] "change in practice". Seyed Mohammad Marandi, a professor at Tehran University, has suggested that if the United States is serious about negotiating with Iran in the future then [...] "that the United States must take concrete steps toward decreasing tension with Iran" [...] such as reassessing Iranian sanctions, reassessing Iranian assets frozen in the United States since the Iranian revolution, and reassessing Washington's backing of Israel. Professor Hamidreza Jalaiepour, a <b>political</b> <b>sociology</b> teacher in Tehran, said if the U.S. examined these options, Iran would be likely to immediately respond in a variety of ways, including helping stabilize Afghanistan, for example.|$|E
