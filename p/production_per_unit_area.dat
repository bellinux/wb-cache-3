40|$|According to the {{official}} survey, the working hour for rice <b>production</b> <b>per</b> <b>unit</b> <b>area</b> is quite different in every farm management. This is because various factors of farm management are effecting the work processes of rice production. From the view point of our studies, these factors can be classified into two groups: {{one of them is}} the economic conditions surrounding the outside of farm management and the other is the inside conditions of farm management. Therefore, this report will be limitted only to the analysis of the latter conditions, especially of the next three, i. e., farm scale, field situation (parcellment of fields) and construction of family. As a matter of fact, our effort is devoted to clearing up of the relationship between working hour for rice <b>production</b> <b>per</b> <b>unit</b> <b>area</b> and the above mentioned three factors effecting the labor use. Our results obtained from the same basic data that were utilized in previous report, are as follows: 1) The more the area of cultivated land per farm increases, the more the working hour for rice <b>production</b> <b>per</b> <b>unit</b> <b>area</b> is decreases. More over when the area of cultivated land in above relationship is calculated by the area of one working man, this relationship becomes clearer. 2) The more the number of field lots or plots per farm increases, the more the working hour for rice <b>production</b> <b>per</b> <b>unit</b> <b>area</b> becomes longer. But, if we adopt the number of field lots or plots per unit area in above relationship instead of that per farm, this relationship becomes more proportionate. 3) It is also proved that the same relationship is existing, between the working hour per unit area for rice production and the number of family member per farm that is to say, the increase of working hour is partly caused by the increasing of working Persons of the farm which results the rising of labor input per unit area for rice production. These results seem to express not only the special feature of family farm, but also of Asiatic small farm. Thus, it becomes very important to apply these results for "labor simplification" in our small family farm...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{evaluate}} information relevant to the use and development of rootstocks from temperate fruit trees (particularly apple, pear and cherry) as an effective means of enhancing harvest index (e. g. weight of useable fruit yield relative to total plant weight). The intention is to provide information to facilitate exploration and discussion of which scientific approach(es) might best suit the future development of cocoa growing. The grafting of clonal scions onto rootstocks is an ancient practice initiated to obviate problems associated with not being able to obtain trueness-to-type from seedlings and limitations in the ability to root scions directly for vegetative propagation. Subsequently, it became apparent that many features of the scion could be beneficially influenced. In particular, these included increases in harvest index, precocity (reducing the period of the juvenile phase), yield (productivity), fruit size and quality, tolerance to climatic stress, pest and disease resistance, as well as the ability to control tree size (dwarfing). Direct rootstock advantages, such as increased anchorage and improved uptake of water and nutrients may also improve the harvest index.

Secondly, we model the effect of pathogen adaptation towards increased lesion size and analyse its consequences for spore <b>production</b> <b>per</b> lesion.

The CSP plants studied herein use thermal oil as heat transfer fluid and as storage medium in a two-tank direct thermal storage system. The performance of the CSP plants were evaluated {{on the basis of}} a 1 MW ORC unit with a conversion efficiency of about 24 % and by considering different values of solar multiple and thermal storage capacity. The comparative performance analysis of the two CSP solutions was carried out with reference to the direct solar energy availability of Cagliari, Italy (1720 kWh/m 2 y) on a yearly basis by means of specifically developed simulation models. The results of the performance assessment demonstrate that CSP plants based on linear Fresnel collectors lead to higher values of electrical energy <b>production</b> <b>per</b> <b>unit</b> <b>area</b> of occupied land. The highest specific energy production of CSP plants based on linear Fresnel collectors is about 55 - 60 kWh/y per m 2 of occupied land and it is achieved with solar multiples in the 1. 74 - 2. 5 range and storage capacities in the range of 4 - 12 hours. The highest specific production of the solutions based on parabolic trough collectors is about 45 - 50 kWh/y per m 2 of occupied land and is achieved with lower solar multiples (around 1. 5 - 2. 3).
