Through questionnaire asking their potential difficulties such as developing proposal, reviewing and revising, and writing styles and academic language uses, it intended to examine NNESs’ needs and expectations from their writing course in {{support for their}} academic writings. The results revealed {{that they were in}} need of more feedback from their peers and instructors as well as <b>proofreading</b> <b>service</b> or training. In addition, diverse aspects of challenges are examined, and potential supports through academic writing course are further discussed...|$|R

Traditional concepts of plagiarism are shifting owing to cut-and-paste technology, the world wide web, <b>proofreading</b> <b>services</b> and the adapting tolerance orf university faculties. Foundation courses have tools to spot plagiarism, but this is becoming increasingly difficult. Foundation teachers encourage important parahrasing and summarising skills, but should emphasise the cultural rationale for rules on plagiarism. The demands of the academic writing genre arenotecas possibly contributing to the problem. To compete globally, UK higher education insitutions will have to significantly modify their teaching and assessment...|$|E
40|$|The {{discussion}} {{regarding how}} to address requests for help with grammar and sentence-level concerns has been an ongoing conversation throughout writing center literature. The general consensus among administrators and tutor-scholars within {{in the field is}} to move away from a product-oriented focus towards one that is more process-oriented, preferring to prioritize writers over their writing. In response to this literature, and in an attempt {{to move away from the}} “repair center” stigma, writing centers often incorporate policies on their websites that negate editing and <b>proofreading</b> <b>services.</b> This thesis explores the messages that these policies send to students and offers a compromise in regards to how writing centers should approach requests for help with sentence-level concerns, suggesting three different grammar-based sessions. This compromise would provide students with the grammar knowledge they may be missing in order to become better writers and stronger editors...|$|E
40|$|This masters thesis {{will present}} my {{research}} on the world of Negation, {{as well as my}} attempt to apply the Negation Algorithm on a new Question Answering system which is able to accept negative input in natural language. The aim of this project is to focus on the uses of negation in natural language, and on the importance of including negative constructions in Information Retrieval processes, which for the moment treat negation as a nonexisting phenomenon in natural language. The new restricted-domain question answering system is called NotFilms, and accepts subject and object questions regarding Movies of 2005. NotFilms reads the input in natural language, produces its semantic representation, applies the IR algorithm on the semantic reading, and provides the user with the ex-act answer. It allows the existence of the negative particle ’not ’ in the input, {{and as long as the}} input can be semantically represented by the linguistic pro-cesses of the system, it answers both affirmative and negative questions with the same efficiency. Results have shown that the linguistic and IR processes of the system can give relevant answers for 75 % of the users ’ questions. i Acknowledgements Many thanks to my supervisors Bonnie and Johan for their time, my sister for her <b>proofreading</b> <b>services,</b> my family for their patience and support, and Demetris for being there for me at all times.

50|$|Proof-editing {{tends to}} exist {{outside of the}} {{traditional}} publishing realm, and usually involves a single stage of editing. It is considered preferable to have separate copy-editing and proofreading stages, so proof-editing is, by definition, a compromise but one that modern professional on-screen proofreaders and copy-editors are increasingly offering {{in order to meet}} the demand for flexible <b>proofreading</b> and editing <b>services.</b>|$|R
50|$|For {{documents}} {{that do not}} require a formal typesetting process, such as reports, journal articles and e-publications, the costs involved with making changes at the proofreading stage are no longer as relevant. This, along with the time and cost pressures felt by businesses, self-publishers and academics, has led to a demand for one-stage <b>proofreading</b> and copy-editing <b>services</b> where a professional proofreader/copy-editor - often a freelancer, sometimes now called an author editor - will be contracted to provide an agreed level of service to an agreed deadline and cost.|$|R
5000|$|As web-based on-demand <b>proofreading</b> {{and editing}} <b>services</b> have become {{increasingly}} available, the number of edit levels and editing schemes has increased in variety. For example, three cumulative levels is a common scheme, typically 1) light, 2) medium, and 3) heavy editing, although another three-level scheme appears frequently across websites: 1) proofreading and 2) light and 3) heavy editing. Four levels usually differs from a three-level scheme only by {{the inclusion of a}} mid-range level, such as 1) basic proofreading and 2) light, 3) medium, and 4) heavy editing. No matter the scheme, a level of edit defined as heavy often results in a complete rewrite. And one web-based service offers six levels of edit according to a partially cumulative scheme: ...|$|R
40|$|The {{acceptance}} rate of medical manuscripts written by researchers whose mother tongue is not English is generally lower than for native English-speaking authors [1]. Although scientific relevance and {{the validity of}} the analysis and results are the most significant factors in the decision to publish an article, the issue of language and writing clearly represents a major stumbling block for these researchers. While articles have been written offering advice on how to improve the linguistic element of articles [2, 3, 4], this paper argues that Englishspeaking language professionals offer a highly valuable service as support staff in hospitals, and that new posts should be created where there is a real need for them. Depending on the set-up and resources within the hospital environment, authors in France {{may or may not have}} access to assistance from native English speakers where manuscripts are concerned. The possibility of obtaining such assistance can be critical for researchers, particularly when submitting work to major international journals. While this type of help is readily available through local agencies offering <b>proofreading</b> or translating <b>services,</b> such assistance can be inconvenient and is not always very personal. Assistance may be available within the hospital context itself, but this is not always the case, particularly in small towns in which little research is carried out, or in sparsely populated regions where fewer native English-speaking language professionals are to be found...|$|R
