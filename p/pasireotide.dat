40|$|Purpose <b>Pasireotide</b> is a multi-receptor-targeted {{somatostatin}} analogue {{approved in}} the EU {{and in the}} US {{for the treatment of}} adults with Cushing's disease (CD). <b>Pasireotide</b> has a safety profile similar to other somatostatin analogues with the exception of hyperglycemia. In this report and literature review, the current understanding of predicting a positive treatment response to <b>pasireotide</b> in CD and the management of diabetes mellitus (DM) during <b>pasireotide</b> treatment are discussed and analyzed. Case presentation We report a case of a 55 -year-old woman with CD and DM who benefitted from long-term <b>pasireotide.</b> The patient, who was enrolled in a phase III trial of the drug, showed early clinical improvements with <b>pasireotide</b> [900 μg subcutaneously twice daily (bid) ] but was classified as a non-responder as urinary free cortisol (UFC) levels, were not normalized. Continuation of <b>pasireotide</b> for 12 months at an increased dose (1, 200 μg bid) normalized UFC levels and restored cortisol rhythm. The initial deterioration in her blood glucose was managed with insulin and metformin; however, after 12 months' treatment with <b>pasireotide</b> her DM was well controlled with oral hypoglycemic agents. Five years later, the patient is still receiving <b>pasireotide</b> (300 μg bid) with no loss of clinical or biochemical efficacy and with continued glycemic control. Conclusions This case presentation indicates that uncontrolled UFC levels during {{the first few months of}} <b>pasireotide</b> treatment as well as worsening of glycemic control in patients with CD and DM are not always predictive of the efficacy and tolerability and appears to support the long-term continuation of <b>pasireotide...</b>|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effects of subcutaneous <b>pasireotide</b> on cardiac repolarization in healthy volunteers. Healthy volunteers were randomized to one of four treatment sequences (n 112) involving four successive treatments in different order: <b>pasireotide</b> 600 mg (therapeutic dose) or 1, 950 mg (maximum tolerated dose) bid by subcutaneous injection (sc), placebo injection and oral moxifloxacin. MaximumDDQTcI occurred 2 hours post‐ dose for both doses of <b>pasireotide.</b> MeanDDQTcIwas 13. 2 milliseconds (90 %CI: 11. 4, 15. 0) and 16. 1 milliseconds (90 %CI: 14. 3, 17. 9) for the 600 and 1, 950 mg bid doses, respectively. Maximal placebo‐subtracted change in QTcI from baseline for moxifloxacin was 11. 1 (90 % CI: 9. 3, 12. 9) milliseconds. Both <b>pasireotide</b> doses caused a reduction in heart rate: maximal heart rate change compared with placebo occurred at 1 hour for <b>pasireotide</b> 600 mg bid and at 0. 5 hours for <b>pasireotide</b> 1, 950 mg bid, with heart rate reductions of 10. 4 and 14. 9 bpm, respectively. At the therapeutic dose of 600 mg, <b>pasireotide</b> has a modest QT‐ prolonging effect.

40|$|Purpose A large, randomized, double-blind, Phase III core study {{demonstrated}} that <b>pasireotide</b> LAR was significantly superior to octreotide LAR at providing GH < 2. 5 μg/L and normalized IGF- 1 after 12 months' treatment {{in patients with}} acromegaly. We report the efficacy and safety of <b>pasireotide</b> LAR and octreotide LAR after up to 26 months' treatment.

Efficacy and safety in the <b>pasireotide</b> LAR and octreotide LAR groups were evaluated for up to 26 months. Results Overall, 120 patients who completed the core study continued receiving <b>pasireotide</b> LAR (n = 74) or octreotide LAR (n = 46) in the extension. At month 25, biochemical control (GH < 2. 5 μg/L and normal IGF- 1) was achieved by 48. 6 % (36 / 74) and 45. 7 % (21 / 46) of patients in the <b>pasireotide</b> LAR and octreotide LAR arms [60. 8 % (45 / 74) and 52. 2 % (24 / 46) when including patients with IGF- 1 < LLN], respectively.

40|$|Mammary {{hyperplasia}} increases {{breast cancer}} risk. Tamoxifen prevents {{breast cancer in}} women with atypical hyperplasia, but has serious side effects. As estradiol action requires IGF-I, direct inhibition of IGF-I action theoretically might be an efficacious alternative to tamoxifen. After hypophysectomy and oophorectomy, 21 -day-old female rats were treated with GH and E₂. After 7 days all terminal end buds (TEBs) and 75 % of ducts became hyperplastic. Co-treatment with <b>pasireotide,</b> a somatostatin analog that blocks GH secretion and IGF-I action in the mammary gland, prevented hormone-induced hyperplasia. The number and size of TEBs and moderately or floridly hyperplastic ducts was reduced by <b>pasireotide</b> (P < 0. 01). In contrast, the same concentration of octreotide, which has a more selective somatostatin receptor subtype binding profile, was less effective than <b>pasireotide.</b> Tamoxifen inhibited hyperplasia when used alone with GH + E₂, but did not add to the inhibitory effect of <b>pasireotide</b> when the two treatments were combined. Both <b>pasireotide</b> and tamoxifen acted via the IGF-I receptor signaling pathway and both were found to inhibit mammary cell proliferation and stimulate apoptosis. The number of epithelial cells expressing phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate (IRS) - 1 in response to GH and E₂ was reduced by <b>pasireotide,</b> as was staining intensity. These results support the concept that IGF-I inhibition, in this case by <b>pasireotide,</b> inhibits E₂ and GH-induced mammary hyperplasia. As tamoxifen did not further increase the inhibitory effect of <b>pasireotide,</b> the peptide appears {{to be at least}} as effective as tamoxifen in preventing GH + E₂-induced mammary hyperplasia...|$|E

40|$|CONTEXT: There is {{currently}} no medical therapy for Cushing's disease that targets the pituitary adenoma. Availability {{of such a}} medical therapy would be a valuable therapeutic option {{for the management of}} this disorder. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to evaluate the short-term efficacy of the novel multireceptor ligand somatostatin analog <b>pasireotide</b> in patients with de novo, persistent, or recurrent Cushing's disease. DESIGN: We conducted a phase II, proof-of-concept, open-label, single-arm, 15 -d multicenter study. PATIENTS: Thirty-nine patients with either de novo Cushing's disease who were candidates for pituitary surgery or with persistent or recurrent Cushing's disease after surgery without having received prior pituitary irradiation. INTERVENTION: Patients self-administered sc <b>pasireotide</b> 600 microg twice daily for 15 d. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Normalization of urinary free cortisol (UFC) levels after 15 d treatment was the main outcome measure. RESULTS: Of the 29 patients in the primary efficacy analysis, 22 (76 %) showed a reduction in UFC levels, of whom five (17 %) had normal UFC levels (responders), after 15 d of treatment with <b>pasireotide.</b> Serum cortisol levels and plasma ACTH levels were also reduced. Steady-state plasma concentrations of <b>pasireotide</b> were achieved within 5 d of treatment. Responders appeared to have higher <b>pasireotide</b> exposure than nonresponders. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Pasireotide</b> produced a decrease in UFC levels in 76 % of patients with Cushing's disease during the treatment period of 15 d, with direct effects on ACTH release. These results suggest that <b>pasireotide</b> holds promise as an effective medical treatment for this disorder...|$|E
40|$|Aim: To {{gather data}} {{regarding}} factors predicting responsiveness to <b>pasireotide</b> in acromegaly. Patients and methods: SSTR 2 a, SSTR 3, SSTR 5, AIP, Ki- 67 and the adenoma subtype were evaluated in somatotroph adenomas from 39 patients treated post-operatively with somatostatin analogues (SSAs). A standardized SSTR scoring system was applied (scores 0 - 3). All patients received first-generation SSAs, and 11 resistant patients were subsequently treated with <b>pasireotide</b> LAR. Results: None {{of the patients}} with negative or cytoplasmic-only SSTR 2 a expression (scores 0 - 1) were responsive to firstgeneration SSAs, as opposed to 20 % (score 2) and 50 % of patients with a score of 3 (PZ 0. 04). None of the patients with an SSTR 5 score of 0 - 1 were responsive to <b>pasireotide,</b> as opposed to 5 / 7 cases with a score of 2 or 3 (PZ 0. 02). SSTR 3 expression did not influence first-generation SSAs or <b>pasireotide</b> responsiveness. Tumours with low AIP were resistant to first-generation SSAs (100 vs 60 %; PZ 0. 02), while they had similar responsiveness to <b>pasireotide</b> compared to tumours with conserved AIP expression (50 vs 40 %; PZ 0. 74). Tumours with low AIP displayed reduced SSTR 2 (SSTR 2 a scores 0 - 1 44. 4 vs 6. 7 %; PZ 0. 006) while no difference was seen in SSTR 5 (SSTR 5 scores 0 - 1 33. 3 vs 23. 3 %; PZ 0. 55). Sparsely granulated adenomas responded better to <b>pasireotide</b> compared to densely granulated ones (80 vs 16. 7 %; PZ 0. 04).

The current work was a planned exploratory objective of the PAOLA study that evaluated changes in levels of growth hormone (GH), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF- 1), IGF-binding proteins (IGFBP- 2, IGFBP- 3), glycated haemoglobin (HbA 1 c) and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) in each treatment arm. Responders to <b>pasireotide</b> LAR (mean GH levels < 2. 5  μg/L and normal IGF- 1 levels at 24  weeks) had lower GH and IGF- 1 levels at baseline (GH 5. 1  ng/mL, IGF- 1 519  ng/mL) than non-responders (GH 7. 9  ng/mL, IGF- 1 672  ng/mL).

MethodsIn this phase I, single-center, open-label study, 45 Chinese male HVs were evenly randomized to 1 to 9 treatment sequences: each volunteer received a single dose of 300, 600, or 900 μg of <b>pasireotide</b> SC on day 1, followed by administration of the same dose BID from day 15 to the morning of day 19, and then a single IM dose of 20, 40, or 60 mg of <b>pasireotide</b> LAR on day 33. The PK parameters were assessed with noncompartmental analysis. Statistical comparison of PK parameters, including AUC, Cmax, and CL/F from both formulations, was made for Chinese versus Western male HVs. The safety profile was also assessed. Metabolic parameters, including blood glucose, insulin, and glucagon, and measures that reflect the effects of <b>pasireotide</b> LAR on relatively long-term glucose control, lipid metabolism, and systemic concentrations of pancreatic enzymes and thyrotropin were evaluated. FindingsOf the 45 randomized HVs, 42 completed the study per protocol, 1 withdrew his informed consent for personal reasons, and 2 prematurely discontinued the study because of adverse events (AEs). Concentration-time and safety profiles of both formulations were similar to those reported in Western HVs. Mean geometric mean ratios (GMRs) of Chinese versus Western HVs ranged from 0. 79 to 1. 42. For most primary PK parameters, 90 % CIs for GMRs were within a predefined ethnic insensitivity interval (90 % CI, 0. 70 – 1. 43). After considering age and weight as covariates in the statistical model, the GMRs and 90 % CIs for other PK parameters were within the predefined interval (Cmax in single-dose SC administration) or significantly decreased (Cmin,ss in multiple BID SC doses and first peak Cmax in the single-dose LAR formulation). No serious AEs were reported. Both formulations were well tolerated; <b>pasireotide</b> SC caused transient changes in glucose metabolism. Owing to the differential binding affinity to the somatostatin receptor subtypes, <b>pasireotide</b> LAR elicited a concentration-dependent increase of fasting blood glucose, substantial reduction in triglyceride, and a mild decrease in cholesterol. The most frequently reported AEs after single-dose and multiple-dose <b>pasireotide</b> SC were injection site reaction, nausea, dizziness, and diarrhea; most HVs developed diarrhea with single-dose <b>pasireotide</b> LAR.

40|$|Long-acting <b>pasireotide</b> is an {{effective}} treatment option for acromegaly, but it is associated with hyperglycemia, which could impact its use in patients with diabetes. We present {{a case of a}} 53 -year-old man with acromegaly and type 2 diabetes mellitus (glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1 c) : 7. 5 %), who refused surgery to remove a pituitary macroadenoma and enrolled in a Phase 3 clinical trial comparing long-acting <b>pasireotide</b> and long-acting octreotide in acromegalic patients. The patient initially received octreotide, but insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF- 1) levels remained elevated after 12  months (383. 9 ng/mL; 193. 0 ng/mL; reference range: 86. 5 – 223. 8 ng/mL), indicating uncontrolled acromegaly. He switched to <b>pasireotide</b> 40 mg and subsequently increased to 60 mg. Within 6  months, IGF- 1 levels normalized (193. 0 ng/mL), and they were mostly normal for the next 62  months of treatment with <b>pasireotide</b> (median IGF- 1 : 190. 7 ng/mL). Additionally, HbA 1 c levels remained similar to or lower than baseline levels (range, 6. 7 % to 7. 8 %) during treatment with <b>pasireotide</b> despite major changes to the patient’s antidiabetic regimen, which included insulin and metformin. Uncontrolled acromegaly can result in hyperglycemia due to an increase in insulin resistance. Despite having insulin-requiring type 2 diabetes, the patient presented here did not experience a long-term increase in HbA 1 c levels upon initiating <b>pasireotide,</b> likely because long-term control of acromegaly resulted in increased insulin sensitivity.

40|$|AbstractThe {{somatostatin}} analog <b>pasireotide</b> and the 11 β-hydroxylase inhibitor osilodrostat (LCI 699) reduce cortisol {{levels by}} distinct mechanisms of action. There exists a scientific rationale {{to investigate the}} clinical efficacy of these two agents in combination. This manuscript reports {{the results of a}} toxicology study in rats, evaluating different doses of osilodrostat and <b>pasireotide</b> alone and in combination. Sixty male and 60 female rats were randomized into single-sex groups to receive daily doses of <b>pasireotide</b> (0. 3 mg/kg/day, subcutaneously), osilodrostat (20 mg/kg/day, orally), osilodrostat/pasireotide in combination (low dose, 1. 5 / 0. 03 mg/kg/day; mid-dose, 5 / 0. 1 mg/kg/day; or high dose, 20 / 0. 3 mg/kg/day), or vehicle for 13 weeks. Mean body-weight gains from baseline to Week 13 were significantly lower in the pasireotide-alone and combined-treatment groups compared to controls, and were significantly higher in female rats receiving osilodrostat monotherapy. Osilodrostat and <b>pasireotide</b> monotherapies were associated with significant changes in the histology and mean weights of the pituitary and adrenal glands, liver, and ovary/oviduct. Osilodrostat alone was associated with adrenocortical hypertrophy and hepatocellular hypertrophy. In combination, osilodrostat/pasireotide did not exacerbate any target organ changes and ameliorated the liver and adrenal gland changes observed with monotherapy. Cmax and AUC 0 – 24 h of osilodrostat and <b>pasireotide</b> increased in an approximately dose-proportional manner. In conclusion, the <b>pasireotide</b> and osilodrostat combination did not exacerbate changes in target organ weight or toxicity compared with either monotherapy, and had an acceptable safety profile; addition of <b>pasireotide</b> to the osilodrostat regimen may attenuate potential adrenal gland hyperactivation and hepatocellular hypertrophy, which are potential side effects of osilodrostat monotherapy...|$|E

The aim of our study was to clarify the possible effects of a multireceptor SRIF ligand on VEGF secretion and cell proliferation in human NFA primary cultures, we assessed SRIF receptors (SSTR 1 - 5) expression and the in vitro effects on VEGF secretion and on cell viability of SRIF and of the stable SRIF analogue <b>pasireotide</b> (SOM 230) which activates SSTR 1, 2, 3 and 5. Twenty-five NFA were examined by RT-PCR for expression of α-subunit, SSTR, VEGF, and VEGF receptors 1 (VEGF-R 1) and 2 (VEGF-R 2). Primary cultures were tested with SRIF and with pasidreotide.

40|$|Context: Biochemical control reduces {{morbidity}} and increases life expectancy {{in patients with}} acromegaly. With current medical therapies, including the gold standard octreotide long-acting-release (LAR), many patients do not achieve biochemical control. Objective: Our objective was to demonstrate the superiority of <b>pasireotide</b> LAR over octreotide LAR in medically naive patients with acromegaly. Design and Setting: We conducted a prospective, randomized, double-blind study at 84 sites in 27 countries. Patients: A total of 358 patients with medically naive acromegaly (GH > 5 mu g/L or GH nadir >= 1 mu g/L after an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and IGF- 1 above the upper limit of normal) were enrolled. Patients either had previous pituitary surgery but no medical treatment or were de novo with a visible pituitary adenoma on magnetic resonance imaging. Interventions: Patients received <b>pasireotide</b> LAR 40 mg/ 28 days (n = 176) or octreotide LAR 20 mg/ 28 days (n = 182) for 12 months. At months 3 and 7, titration to <b>pasireotide</b> LAR 60 mg or octreotide LAR 30 mg was permitted, but not mandatory, if GH >= 2. 5 mu g/L and/or IGF- 1 was above the upper limit of normal. Main Outcome Measure: The main outcome measure was the proportion of patients in each treatment arm with biochemical control (GH < 2. 5 mu g/L and normal IGF- 1) at month 12. Results: Biochemical control was achieved by significantly more <b>pasireotide</b> LAR patients than octreotide LAR patients (31. 3 % vs 19. 2 %; P =. 007; 35. 8 % vs 20. 9 % when including patients with IGF- 1 below the lower normal limit).
