5000|$|Piett was a {{creation}} of Lawrence Kasdan, the screenwriter who wrote both The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. Kasdan was aware that there was fun to be had in giving more depth and variability to his background characters, not only to help viewers identify them, but to remind his audience {{that much of the}} Empire consisted of <b>people</b> <b>just</b> <b>doing</b> their jobs. Although Admiral Piett's true first appearance in the Star Wars universe was one month prior to the release of the Empire Strikes Back in the film's novelization, he was brought to life to audiences around the world by British actor Kenneth Colley, who was cast in the role. Colley recalls that Empire Strikes Back director Irvin Kershner stated that for Piett, he was [...] "looking for someone that would frighten Adolf Hitler", and told Colley after meeting him, [...] "Yes, I think you’re it". In playing the role, Colley chose not to portray a singular attitude for the character; but instead attempted to bring forth a more true to life humanity in Piett's character, something that he believes ultimately sat quite well with audiences.|$|R
