5|$|On June 22, 2010, {{the town}} of Lyndhurst put forward a {{proposal}} to buy the station depots at both Kingsland and Lyndhurst stations. The mayor of Lyndhurst, Richard DiLascio, said that the stations have seen better days and New Jersey Transit {{has no interest in}} renovating both buildings. Design plans for Kingsland station look towards a new coffee shop, after repairing and renovating the building. The station would also be converted from its old subway tile to a newer retro look for the building, paid for by leasing the building. Because an average of 440 to over 1,000 <b>people</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> Kingsland station daily, it would look better for {{the town of}} Lyndhurst to make a good impression on the riders. Asof 2012, the station house was unoccupied. The town of Lyndhurst has requested that NJT lease the building to the municipality so that it might be renovated and brought into use as a way to revitalize the immediate vicinity.|$|E
5|$|The city is {{host to the}} European {{headquarters}} of IBM and, until 2007, the UK {{headquarters of}} Zurich Financial Services. In the city centre, shopping is centred on Commercial Road and the 1980s Cascades Shopping Centre, with over 100 high street shops between them. Approximately 185,000 to 230,000 <b>people</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> Cascades Shopping Centre each week. Recent redevelopment has created new shopping areas, including the upmarket Gunwharf Quays—a redevelopment of the HMS Vernon naval shore establishment— containing fashion stores, restaurants, and a cinema, and the Historic Dockyard, which caters to the tourist sector and holds an annual Victorian Christmas market. Ocean Retail Park sits on the north-eastern side of Portsea Island and was built on land previously occupied by a Metal Box factory in September 1985.|$|E

5|$|The list {{of names}} {{consists}} of entries from 17 Southeast and East Asian nations and the United States who have territories directly affected by typhoons. The submitted names are arranged into five lists, and each list is cycled with each year. Unlike tropical cyclones {{in other parts of}} the world, typhoons are not named after people. Instead, they generally refer to animals, flowers, astrological signs, and a few personal names. However, PAGASA retains its own naming list, which does consist of human names. Therefore, a typhoon can possibly have two names. Storms that cross the date line from the central Pacific retain their original name, but the designation of hurricane becomes typhoon. In Japan, <b>people</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> numerical designation of typhoons according to the sequence of their occurrence in the calendar year.|$|E
5|$|In {{recognition}} {{of the fact that}} many <b>people</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> towpath to exercise their dogs, dog dips have been installed at Allbrook and Shawford. These provide easy access into the water for dogs, and owners are encouraged to only allow dogs to swim at these locations, to conserve the bank in other places. The water vole surveys have followed the best practice described in the Water Vole Conservation Handbook (2006), and have also recorded evidence of otter, brown rat and American mink populations. While carrying out the work, the surveyors have also counted sightings of kingfisher, heron, moorhen and coot. The bat survey recorded common pipistrelle, soprano pipistrelle, Daubenton's, noctule and serotine bats in 2011. Bat boxes have been erected near Allbrook, and there was some evidence that they were being used. The 2009 fisheries survey recorded large numbers of young Atlantic salmon in the lower river, but although fish weirs have been provided, wild parr were not recorded near Winchester. Above there, a large population of brown trout thrives. Eels were monitored {{for the first time in}} 2009, when their distribution was found to be variable.|$|E

25|$|The {{second level}} digital divide, also {{referred}} to as the production gap, describes the gap that separates the consumers of content on the internet from the producers of content. As the technological digital divide is decreasing between those with access to the internet and those without, the meaning of the term digital divide is evolving. Previously, digital divide research has focused on accessibility to the Internet and Internet consumption.

25|$|Tāwari is a {{rich source}} of nectar, which is often so {{abundant}} that bees produce monofloral honey, that is the honey is chiefly made of nectar from Tāwari flowers. Tāwari honey is regularly for sale from food shops in New Zealand. The nectar contains a lot of fructose and much water. The honey may be thin as a consequence, but nonetheless crystallizes quickly. The honey has a light colour and tastes a bit like butterscotch. It contains relatively few pollen, and if at least 20% of the pollen is Tāwari, it can be marketed as Tāwari honey. Bark can produce a black dye that is known to be used on flax. Māori <b>people</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> flowers to make necklaces and other adornments to be worn at festivities.|$|E
