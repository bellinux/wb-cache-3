5|$|At lower Reynolds numbers, such {{as those}} seen with model aircraft, it is {{relatively}} easy to maintain laminar flow. This gives low skin friction, which is desirable. However, the same velocity profile which gives the laminar boundary layer its low skin friction also causes it to be badly affected by adverse pressure gradients. As the pressure begins to recover over the rear part of the wing chord, a laminar boundary layer will tend to separate from the surface. Such flow separation causes a large increase in the <b>pressure</b> <b>drag,</b> since it greatly increases the effective size of the wing section. In these cases, it can be advantageous to deliberately trip the boundary layer into turbulence at a point prior to the location of laminar separation, using a turbulator. The fuller velocity profile of the turbulent boundary layer allows it to sustain the adverse pressure gradient without separating. Thus, although the skin friction is increased, overall drag is decreased. This is the principle behind the dimpling on golf balls, as well as vortex generators on aircraft. Special wing sections have also been designed which tailor the pressure recovery so laminar separation is reduced or even eliminated. This represents an optimum compromise between the <b>pressure</b> <b>drag</b> from flow separation and skin friction from induced turbulence.|$|E
25|$|Due to this, wake {{formation}} takes place, which consequently {{leads to}} eddy formation and pressure loss due to <b>pressure</b> <b>drag.</b> In such situations, the airfoil is stalled and has higher <b>pressure</b> <b>drag</b> than friction drag. In this case, {{the body is}} described as a blunt body.|$|E
25|$|Therefore, {{when the}} drag is {{dominated}} by a frictional component, the body is called a streamlined body; whereas {{in the case of}} dominant <b>pressure</b> <b>drag,</b> the body is called a blunt body. Thus, the shape of the body and the angle of attack determine the type of drag. For example, an airfoil is considered as a body with a small angle of attack by the fluid flowing across it. This means that it has attached boundary layers, which produce much less <b>pressure</b> <b>drag.</b>|$|E

500|$|In {{high-performance}} designs, such as gliders {{and commercial}} aircraft, much {{attention is paid}} to controlling the behavior of the boundary layer to minimize drag. [...] Two effects have to be considered.

5000|$|For {{aircraft}} and rockets, below Mach [...]8, the nose <b>pressure</b> <b>drag</b> is essentially zero for all shapes. The major significant factor is friction drag, which is largely {{dependent upon the}} wetted area, the surface smoothness of that area, {{and the presence of}} any discontinuities in the shape. For example, in strictly subsonic rockets a short, blunt, smooth elliptical shape is usually best. In the transonic region and beyond, where the <b>pressure</b> <b>drag</b> increases dramatically, the effect of nose shape on drag becomes highly significant.

Compared to the predictions of inviscid-flow theory, in which there is no boundary layer, the attached boundary layer reduces the lift by a modest amount and modifies the pressure distribution somewhat, which results in a viscosity-related <b>pressure</b> <b>drag</b> over and above the skin-friction drag.

40|$|In this article, a new {{relationship}} for the calculation of the Zener <b>drag</b> <b>pressure</b> is described in which {{the effect of the}} size distribution of nanoscale dispersed particles is taken into account, in addition to particle radius and volume fraction, which have been incorporated in the existing relationships. Microstructural observations indicated a clear correlation between the size distribution of dispersed particles and recrystallized grain sizes in the AA 7020 aluminum alloy. However, the existing relationship to calculate the Zener <b>drag</b> <b>pressure</b> yielded a negligible difference of 0. 016 pct between the two structures homogenized at different conditions resulting in totally different size distributions of nanoscale dispersed particles and, consequently, recrystallized grain sizes. The difference in the Zener <b>drag</b> <b>pressure</b> calculated by the application of the {{new relationship}} was 5. 1 pct, being in line with the experimental observations of the recrystallized grain sizes. Mathematical investigations showed that the ratio of the Zener <b>drag</b> <b>pressure</b> from the new equation to that from the existing equation is maximized when the number densities of all the particles with different sizes are equal. This finding indicates that in the two structures with identical parameters except the size distribution of nanoscale dispersed particles, the one that possesses a broader size distribution of particles, i. e., the number densities of particles with different sizes being equal, gives rise to a larger Zener <b>drag</b> <b>pressure</b> than that having a narrow size distribution of nanoscale dispersed particles, i. e., most of the particles being in the same size range.
