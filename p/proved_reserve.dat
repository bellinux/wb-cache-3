The study focuses on the comparison between the results of the several econometric adjustment techniques (linear, non-linear techniques, linear techniques with structural change and the non-parametric methods) applied to the Tunisian oil production during the period going from 1966 to 2011. The prospective study through the econometric models has allowed us to determine the two dates scaring all energy executives, namely the peak which took place in the middle of the eighties and the finiteness of resources planned in 2028. The obtained results have shown that it remains 495 million barrels to be produced in Tunisia, bearing in mind that the data supplied by the authorities announces the figure of 420 million barrels of the remaining <b>proved</b> <b>reserve</b> in the Tunisian underground. Thereby, we have noticed a strong link between the physical models for reservoir flows and the empirical specifications based on the decline curves...|$|E

Problems of ground frost heave and soil softening belong to the important factors, that could cause serious damage and financial loss. Bayburt tuff and tuffites known as Bayburt Stone mines, located around Bayburt, play important role on economy of the Bayburt city. As a result of researches in 2005 total of 2 535 700 tons <b>proved</b> <b>reserve</b> were determined several places in Bayburt.

By recycling the waste material rejected stone was mixed with lime and used as a soil stabilizator against freezing–thawing effect. Prepared natural and stabilized soil samples were subjected to freezing–thawing cycles after curing for 28 days. After the freezing–thawing cycles, compressive strength of the samples was measured to investigate the influence of the additives on the freezing–thawing properties of soil samples. As a result of this study, it was determined that samples stabilized with Green Bayburt Stone mixtures have high freezing–thawing durability as compared to unstabilized samples. As a consequence, it was seen that those mixtures can be successfully used as an additive material to enhance the freezing–thawing effects of cohessive soils...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT] There are {{abundant}} land, Mineral and energy {{resources in the}} Great Northwest China. However, the ecological envirotiment there is also fragile. Lack of water is the key problem affecting the local economic development. The six provinces and autonomous regions in the Great Northwest China have a total area of 4. 2 million km^ 2 and a population no more than 100 million. There is a boundless stretch of land where the arable land amounts to several million hectares with enormous potential of agricultural production as long as water is supplied. This potential should present the only functional way to alleviate the grain and meat shortage in China and the over-dense population {{in the eastern part}} of China in the 21 ^ century. CoaL petroleum, natural gas and nonferrous metal resources in the Great Northwest China occupy a decisive position in China. The proved reserves of coal is 160 billion ton which is 160 times the annual coal output of whole China. According to the cooperative survey with U. S. by means of seismic exploration and analysis, the reseive of natural gas is expected to be 300 billion m^ 3, and the <b>proved</b> <b>reserve</b> of potassium, magnesium, sodium and barium salt ore ranks first in China, If the problem of water shortage can be solved, the Great Northwest China will become the bases of energy, raw materials, heavy chemical industry, petrol-chemical industry and salt chemical industiy in China. Petroleum will possibly become the major product for export and earn large amount of foreign currency for China. There exist drought, water deficit and fragile ecological environment in the Great Northwest China. If proper policy of land reclamation is not adopted, the sustainable development in that region is impossible and, as a result, the development {{in the eastern part of}} China should be affected greatly. The Yaluzangbu River in Tibet is rich in water resources and hydropower, awaiting to be exploited for water and electricity supply to turn...|$|E
40|$|Given the {{importance}} of the reserves disclosures for investors and regulators, it is surprising to them {{that there has been a}} lot of focus, which is elaborated on in Chapter 2, on how the reserves data are prepared and reported on by companies. Currently, reserves disclosures in financial statements are not audited by independent public accountants, nor are they audited by any petroleum industry-designated independent evaluators. Performing the critical “reserves evaluator” function currently does not require any recognised certification program or other mandatory industry-wide training requirements. Despite the highly technical nature of the reserves estimation process, both preparers and users of the reserves information know that reserves estimation is not an exact science. Estimates are based on limited data obtained from small regions, which are then extrapolated to the whole field. Reserves estimations are also based on expected production paths over long periods of time. Many alternative procedures are often available and widely used for making similar technical or economic determinations. These factors make reserves disclosures inherently subject to information quality problems. Estimates of <b>proved</b> <b>reserve</b> quantities may often be imprecise and change over time as new information, for example, through new technologies becomes available. Accurate reserves data are extremely important to investors to value and assess the performance of energy companies, and are equally important to regulators and the public given the critical role of the energy sector in the economy. It is clear, then, that reserves data should be disclosed in a way that minimizes the credibility gap that afflicts the current disclosures. Key problem in structuring information about reserves is that relatively objective estimates of reservoir characteristics must be combined with subjective forecasts of project feasibility and commerciality. In this thesis, the Dynamic Reserves Estimation Model (DREM) is considered as a new method to estimate reserves. This model is based on complex parameters; however it has the capability to simplify many problems concerned with reserves estimations...|$|E

40|$|The world's total {{estimated}} <b>proved</b> <b>reserve</b> {{of conventional}} oil is one trillion bbl {{and the world}} average of the reserves-to-production ratio is only 46 years at 1990 production levelsl'l. This excludes the reserves of heavy oil, tar sands and bitumen that amounts to 6 trillion barrels of oil in place which are not economically recoverable with present technologies. If the proper technology is developed for extracting these resources it can supply the fuel demand {{for the next few}} centuries. Heavy oil and bitumen have high viscosity and low API gravity. In some reservoirs, such as Athabasca, the oil viscosity is in millions of mPa. s at reservoir conditions making conventional recovery impossible. Flooding techniques cannot enhance recovery substantially, due to the adverse mobility ratio. The viscosities of the heavy oil and bitumen decrease drastically with increase in temperature. Among the thermal recovery processes applied to produce these crudes, the Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage 12] proved to be very successful. In this process steam is injected through a horizontal well and the hot oil being less viscous drains by gravity to the horizontal production well. Using long horizontal wells, very high production rates can be achieved in this process. In steam processes the energy efficiency is poor due largely to heat losses to the underburden and overburden (specially in thin reservoirs). Enormous amount of effluent is to treated, a huge source for the supply of fresh water is required, clay swelling due to contact with fresh water from the condensed steam causes formation damage. However, instead of steam, if solvent is used to dilute bitumen some of these problems can be eliminated. Butler and Mok~ys [~] studied the extraction of bitumen with toluene in a line source Hele-Shaw cell. On the basis of the magnitude of different physical properties affecting the production rates, it was concluded that the solvent leaching would be slower than the thermal processes. It was anticipated that vaporized solvent in combination with deasphalting may enhance the rate considerably...|$|E
