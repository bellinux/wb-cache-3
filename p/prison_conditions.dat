5|$|In 1946, {{the year}} of Shaw's ninetieth birthday, he {{accepted}} the freedom of Dublin {{and became the first}} honorary freeman of the borough of St Pancras, London. In the same year the government asked Shaw informally whether he would accept the Order of Merit. He declined, believing that an author's merit could only be determined by the posthumous verdict of history. 1946 saw the publication, as The Crime of Imprisonment, of the preface Shaw had written 20 years previously to a study of <b>prison</b> <b>conditions.</b> It was widely praised; a reviewer in The American Journal of Public Health considered it essential reading for any student of the American criminal justice system.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{the riot}} {{appeared}} to increase {{public support for}} radical reform of the present degrading prison system. Some of that goodwill will have been eroded by the antics of the rioters {{in the last two}} weeks, and may be further eroded once details emerge during the forthcoming criminal prosecutions. But this must not deflect Home Office ministers from the road down which they had belatedly begun to travel. A change in <b>prison</b> <b>conditions</b> is crucial if good order is to be restored to the system.|$|E

5000|$|Very few women, {{black or}} white, were imprisoned in the antebellum South. But for {{those women who}} did come {{under the control of}} Southern <b>prisons,</b> <b>conditions</b> were often [...] "horrendous," [...] {{according}} to Edward L. Ayers. Although they were not made to shave their heads like male convicts, female inmates in the antebellum South did not live in specialized facilities—as was the case in many antebellum Northern prisons—and sexual abuse was common.|$|R
5|$|She {{published}} articles and books {{on her work}} and her lobbying {{was instrumental in the}} passage of several educational acts in the mid-nineteenth century. She was the first woman to have a paper published by the Statistical Society of London. She addressed many conferences and meetings and became {{known as one of the}} foremost public speakers of her time. Carpenter was active in the anti-slavery movement; she also visited India, visiting schools and prisons and working to improve female education, establish reformatory schools and improve <b>prison</b> <b>conditions.</b> In later years she visited Europe and America, carrying on her campaigns of penal and educational reform.|$|E
5|$|From 1967 onwards, <b>prison</b> <b>conditions</b> improved; black {{prisoners were}} given {{trousers}} rather than shorts, games were permitted, {{and the standard}} of their food was raised. In 1969, an escape plan for Mandela was developed by Gordon Bruce, but it was abandoned after the conspiracy was infiltrated by {{an agent of the}} South African Bureau of State Security (BOSS), who hoped to see Mandela shot during the escape. In 1970, Commander Piet Badenhorst became commanding officer. Mandela, seeing an increase in the physical and mental abuse of prisoners, complained to visiting judges, who had Badenhorst reassigned. He was replaced by Commander Willie Willemse, who developed a co-operative relationship with Mandela and was keen to improve prison standards.|$|E
5|$|St Briavels Castle was {{originally}} built between 1075 and 1129 as a royal administrative centre for the Forest of Dean. During the 13th century the castle became first a favourite hunting lodge of King John, {{and then the}} primary centre in England for the manufacture of quarrels, large numbers of which were required for crossbows in medieval warfare. The castle was transferred many times between royal favourites in the 14th and 15th centuries and slowly declined in appearance and importance. St Briavels Castle became used primarily as a court and as a notorious debtors' <b>prison,</b> <b>conditions</b> being documented by the prison reformer John Howard in 1775. Following local riots and a parliamentary investigation in the 1830s, reforms in the 19th century brought {{an end to the}} castle's use as a prison.|$|E

50|$|The poem {{uses the}} image of {{loneliness}} and solitude throughout. The narrator is forced to stay behind, but he is glad that his friends, especially Lamb, are able to enjoy the walk. The narrator is able to relax and be accepting of his situation and of nature, and the experience shows that his <b>prison</b> <b>condition</b> is perfectly tolerable because it is physical and not mental. The image of the solitary bee is used to represent the poet continuing his work in a world overcome by peace and harmony. The final moments of the poem contain a religious element and works like an evening prayer.|$|R

25|$|In 1841, Dorothea Dix {{discovered}} that <b>prison</b> <b>conditions</b> were, in her opinion, inhumane. Prisoners were chained naked, whipped with rods.

While focusing on the insane, her comments also resulted in changes for other inmates.|$|E
25|$|<b>Prison</b> <b>conditions</b> {{often are}} poor and life-threatening; in many facilities, extreme overcrowding, poor nutrition, {{inadequate}} medical and psychological treatment, inadequate sanitation, limited family visits, and frequent inhuman and degrading treatment are common, according to various reports by human rights organizations and research centers.

25|$|The Japanese embassy {{hostage crisis}} began on 17 December 1996, when {{fourteen}} MRTA militants seized {{the residence of}} the Japanese ambassador in Lima during a party, taking hostage some four hundred diplomats, government officials, and other dignitaries. The action was partly in protest of <b>prison</b> <b>conditions</b> in Peru. During the four-month standoff, the Emerretistas gradually freed all but 72 of their hostages. The government rejected the militants' demand to release imprisoned MRTA members and secretly prepared an elaborate plan to storm the residence, while stalling by negotiating with the hostage-takers.|$|E
25|$|The {{involvement}} {{of the military in}} politics has historically led to regular, if infrequent, arbitrary arrest and detention, use of excessive force, torture, and extra-judicial killing by security forces and police. The judiciary has historically suffered from poor jail and <b>prison</b> <b>conditions,</b> prolonged pretrial detention, and executive interference in the judiciary. While all these have improved dramatically since the return to civilian rule, international human rights organizations continue to report sporadic incidents of all these abuses. Post-1999 there has been a marked improvement of civilian control of security forces, with the United States State Department contending every year since 2001 that the military was under civilian control.|$|E

25|$|The Eighth Amendment (1791) protects {{people from}} having bail or fines set at an amount {{so high that}} it would be {{impossible}} for all but the richest defendants to pay and also protects people from being subjected to cruel and unusual punishment. Although this phrase originally was intended to outlaw certain gruesome methods of punishment, it has been broadened over the years to protect against punishments that are grossly disproportionate to or too harsh for the particular crime. This provision has also been used to challenge <b>prison</b> <b>conditions</b> such as extremely unsanitary cells, overcrowding, insufficient medical care and deliberate failure by officials to protect inmates from one another.|$|E
25|$|Mass incarceration {{cannot be}} {{remedied}} {{in a short}} length of time, because each prisoner serves a separate sentence, {{the average length of}} sentences has risen over the last 35 years and public support for prison reform is still relatively low. Decriminalizing drugs has been suggested by libertarians and advocated for by socialists, but remains a remote political option. Additional parole and probation can be facilitated with enhanced electronic monitoring, though monitoring is expensive. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld prisoner releases to relieve California's unconstitutional <b>prison</b> <b>conditions</b> in Brown v.

When Judy Zimmet traveled to Israel and asked to visit him in prison, prison authorities said they could only meet in the presence of prison officials and with them separated by a glass barrier. Vanunu rejected these conditions, demanding he be allowed to meet her face to face. He also filed three appeals to the Israeli Supreme Court protesting his conditions, which were rejected.

Most of the French and American dead were buried on nearby Deadmans Island. James Brooke suggests a burial rate of one per week. The war ended in December 1814, but news of this did not reach Melville until March 1815, during which time about fifty prisoners died. The prisoners were released to [...] "quit Halifax at their own expense", though some {{were able to find}} berths on trade ships. All but 120 had left by mid-April; most of those remaining were hospital patients, who were sent to the Naval Hospital in Halifax in early May.
