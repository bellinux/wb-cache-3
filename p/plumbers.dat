5|$|Labour {{comprised}} skilled volunteers, engineers, {{designers and}} supervisors, who were paid and treated well, second came volunteer workers, often skilled technicians, such as carpenters, <b>plumbers,</b> electricians and metal workers, again these workers were paid, took holidays and were well treated. Next came unskilled forced labour, paid very little and treated quite harshly, lastly came effective slave labour, paid so little, badly fed and treated very harshly. The OT ran training courses to improve labour skills.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the work}} inside the church was done by volunteers under the {{direction}} of paid <b>plumbers,</b> electricians, and craftsmen. In addition, all of the pattern-makers and mechanics who worked on the building did so without pay. There was also a group of women who shined marble and granite until the pieces were full of luster.|$|E

5|$|The various nicknames {{associated}} with prepatellar bursitis {{arise from the}} fact that it commonly occurs among those individuals whose professions require frequent kneeling, such as carpenters, carpet layers, gardeners, housemaids, mechanics, miners, <b>plumbers,</b> and roofers. The exact incidence of the condition is not known; it is difficult to estimate because only severe septic cases require hospital admission, and mild non-septic cases generally go unreported. Prepatellar bursitis is more common among males than females. It affects all age groups, but is more likely to be septic when it occurs in children.|$|E
5|$|While Playford {{was known}} for his use of price {{controls}} to restrain the price of living and therefore attract blue-collar workers to settle in the state and fuel industrialisation, South Australia was slow to introduce consumer protection laws in regards to quality control. It was believed that he was opposed to compulsory pasteurisation and other quality standards on milk to avoid offending his rural support base. Playford's reluctance to introduce regulations for tradesmen such as builders, electricians and <b>plumbers</b> were often seen to have resulted from his being a keen do-it-yourself handyman.|$|E
5|$|While other {{refineries}} {{would keep}} the 60% of oil product that became kerosene, but dump the other 40% in rivers and massive sludge piles, Rockefeller remained as thrifty and efficient as ever, using the gasoline to fuel the refinery, and selling the rest as lubricating oil, petroleum jelly and paraffin wax, and other by-products. Tar was used for paving, naphtha shipped to gas plants. Likewise, Rockefeller's refineries hired their own <b>plumbers,</b> cutting the cost of pipe-laying in half. Barrels that cost $2.50 each ended up only $.96 when Rockefeller bought the wood and had them built for himself.|$|E

5|$|While traveling, Einstein wrote {{daily to}} his wife Elsa and adopted stepdaughters Margot and Ilse. The letters were {{included}} in the papers bequeathed to The Hebrew University. Margot Einstein permitted the personal letters to be made available to the public, but requested that it not be done until twenty years after her death (she died in 1986). Einstein had expressed his interest in the plumbing profession and was made an honorary member of the <b>Plumbers</b> and Steamfitters Union. Barbara Wolff, of The Hebrew University's Albert Einstein Archives, told the BBC that there are about 3,500 pages of private correspondence written between 1912 and 1955.|$|E
5|$|After {{his playing}} career ended, Blake {{went on to}} become a plumber. He spent nearly 50 years in the {{plumbing}} business and was formerly the president of <b>Plumbers</b> Local 360. Blake was married to his wife, Carol Jean, for 47 years before her death. With Carol, he had a son, Ed, and a daughter, Peggy. His son, also named Ed Blake, was a former pitcher who played in the Baltimore Orioles' farm system from 1970 to 1973, playing for the AA affiliate Asheville Orioles at the peak of his career. His grandson, Ed Blake III, has continued in the footsteps of his father and grandfather as a pitcher in high school. Blake died in Swansea, Illinois at the age of 83 after a long illness, and is interred at Mount Carmel Cemetery in Belleville, Illinois.|$|E
5|$|Super Mario Bros. 3 {{centers on}} <b>plumbers</b> Mario and Luigi who {{embark on a}} quest to save Princess Toadstool and the rulers of seven {{different}} kingdoms from the antagonist Bowser and his children, the Koopalings. The player, as Mario or Luigi, is able to defeat enemies by stomping them or using items that bestow magical powers. Mario and Luigi are given {{a wider range of}} abilities than in previous Super Mario games, including flying or sliding down slopes. In addition, Super Mario Bros. 3 introduces numerous elements, such as new enemy characters and the use of a world map to transition between levels, that have reappeared in or have influenced subsequent Mario games.|$|E

50|$|A <b>plumber's</b> snake is a slender, {{flexible}} auger used {{to dislodge}} clogs in plumbing. The <b>plumber's</b> snake is often reserved for difficult clogs that cannot be loosened with a plunger. It is also sometimes called a toilet jack.|$|R
5|$|The Lost Levels is a side-scrolling, {{platformer}} action game {{similar in}} style and gameplay to the original 1985 Super Mario Bros., save {{for an increase in}} difficulty. As in the original, Mario (or Luigi) venture to rescue the Princess from Bowser. The player jumps between platforms, avoids enemy and inanimate obstacles, finds hidden secrets (such as warp zones and vertical vines), and collects power-ups like the mushroom (which makes Mario grow), the Fire Flower (which lets Mario throw fireballs), and the Invincibility Star. Unlike the original, there is no two-player mode but at the title screen, the player chooses between the twin <b>plumbers,</b> who are differentiated for the first time: Luigi, designed for skilled players, has less ground friction and higher jump height, while Mario is faster.|$|E
5|$|The {{convention}} center was plagued {{from the start}} by budget problems and construction blunders. City regulations forbid a general contractor having final authority over the project, so architects and program manager Richard Kahan had to coordinate the wide array of builders, <b>plumbers,</b> electricians, and other workers. The forged steel globes {{to be used in}} the space frame came to the site with hairline cracks and other defects; 12,000 were rejected. These and other problems led to media comparisons with the disastrous Hancock Tower. One New York City official blamed Kahan for the difficulties, indicating that the building's architectural flourishes were responsible for delays and financial crises. The Javits Center opened on 3 April 1986, to a generally positive reception. During the inauguration ceremonies, however, neither Freed nor Pei was recognized for their role in the project.|$|E
5|$|In adults, {{occupational}} exposure {{is the main}} cause of lead poisoning. People can be exposed when working in facilities that produce a variety of lead-containing products; these include radiation shields, ammunition, certain surgical equipment, developing dental x-ray films prior to digital x-rays (each film packet had a lead liner to prevent the radiation from going through), fetal monitors, plumbing, circuit boards, jet engines, and ceramic glazes. In addition, lead miners and smelters, <b>plumbers</b> and fitters, auto mechanics, glass manufacturers, construction workers, battery manufacturers and recyclers, firing range instructors, and plastic manufacturers are at risk for lead exposure. Other occupations that present lead exposure risks include welding, manufacture of rubber, printing, zinc and copper smelting, processing of ore, combustion of solid waste, and production of paints and pigments. Parents who are exposed to lead in the workplace can bring lead dust home on clothes or skin and expose their children. Occupational exposure to lead increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, in particular: stroke, and high blood pressure.|$|E
50|$|The new Omnitrix also {{functions}} as a <b>Plumber's</b> badge which {{is used in the}} series as a communicator, a detector of other <b>Plumber's</b> badges, an alien-language translator, and as a key for accessing the Extranet, an intergalactic Internet.|$|R
50|$|<b>Plumber's</b> putty {{is a type}} of putty used as a sealant in plumbing. It is a pliable {{substance}} used to make watertight seals around faucets and drains. The putty is a {{basic component}} of a <b>plumber's</b> toolkit and is often used when replacing plumbing fixtures. <b>Plumber's</b> putty formulations vary but commonly include powdered clay and linseed oil. Other formulas use limestone, talc, or fish oil. RTV silicone or epoxy sealants may be used in place of putty.|$|R

5|$|The {{design of}} the new defences was {{probably}} carried out by Rogers and resembled his earlier work near Calais, although the King probably also made some decisions on the project personally. Sir Richard Long and Michael Stanhope were instructed to oversee {{the construction of the}} defences, with Thomas Aldred acting as the project's paymaster and William Reynolds in the role of master mason. Initial estimates suggested that 530 workers would be needed, including masons, carpenters and <b>plumbers,</b> but more may have been required in practice. Some of the building materials were taken from monastic institutions, which had recently dissolved by Henry; stone and lead was taken from the nearby Meaux Abbey, further stone from the friaries in Hull and probably also from St Mary's Church in Hull, which had recently collapsed. At least some of the bricks needed were made in a series of ten kilns beside the site itself. The land needed for the buildings had been seized during the dissolution of the monasteries. By December 1543, £21,056 had been spent on the project.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half of the 18th century, Britain, and later {{continental}} Europe and the United States, experienced the Industrial Revolution. This was the first time during which production rates exceeded those of Rome. Britain was the leading producer, losing this status by the mid-19th century with the depletion of its mines and the development of lead mining in Germany, Spain, and the United States. By 1900, the United States was the leader in global lead production, and other non-European nations—Canada, Mexico, and Australia—had begun significant production; production outside Europe exceeded that within. A great share of the demand for lead came from plumbing and painting—lead paints were in regular use. At this time, more (working class) people were exposed to the metal and lead poisoning cases escalated. This led to research into the effects of lead intake. Lead was proven to be more dangerous in its fume form than as a solid metal. Lead poisoning and gout were linked; British physician Alfred Baring Garrod noted a third of his gout patients were <b>plumbers</b> and painters. The effects of chronic ingestion of lead, including mental disorders, were also studied in the 19th century. The first laws aimed at decreasing lead poisoning in factories were enacted during the 1870s and 1880s in the United Kingdom.|$|E

25|$|His belief {{led to the}} {{development}} of procedures for collective bargaining and contracts between labor and management which are still in use today. In practice, AFL unions were important in industrial cities, where they formed a central labor office to coordinate the actions of different AFL unions. Issues of wages and hours were the usual causes of strikes, but many strikes were assertions of jurisdiction, so that the <b>plumbers,</b> for example, used strikes to ensure that all major construction projects in the city used union <b>plumbers.</b> In this goal they were ideally supported by all the other construction unions in the AFL fold.|$|E
