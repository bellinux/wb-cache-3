In the 1970s, employers began to scale back their investments in production, and there was enormous political pressure on the state to curb wage increases and reduce price inflation, bringing the long post-war boom to an end. Orthodox Marxists however argued that the main cause of falling profits was the rising organic composition of capital, and not wage rises. On this view, the falling average rate of profit on production capital in the end choked off the growth of the total mass of profit, leading to a stagnation of business investment and rising unemployment.|$|E

As a response to this <b>profit</b> <b>squeeze,</b> the firm might tend to reduce the remuneration of its workers in the upper tail of the distribution to re-gain its initial profit level.

40|$|The {{macroeconomic}} principles {{behind the}} Swedish model {{were developed by}} two trade union economists, Gösta Rehn and Rudolf Meidner, shortly after World War II. The model’s economic and wage policy represents a unique third way between keynesianism and monetarism in its approach to combine full employment and growth with price stability and equity. This essay describes the content and economic foundation of the Rehn-Meidner model and evaluates its validity {{in the light of}} later theoretical and empirical work. With some exceptions, the model is either in harmony with or a serious challenge to current thinking about employment, inflation and growth. The model’s main contribution to economics is its dynamic description of wage formation, giving room for both competitive forces, X-inefficient firms and wage setting phenomena such as relative wage preferences, labour market policy and a wage policy of fairness. The model also makes a valuable contribution to modern growth economics by incorporating the idea that structural change and company productivity can be promoted by <b>profit</b> <b>squeezes</b> induced by wage and economic policy.

40|$|This {{paper offers}} a {{macroeconomic}} model which can consistently explain the following facts of Japan's lost decade: {{the fall in}} growth rate, the rise in Marshall's k, the rise in consumption propensity, the near-zero interest rate, and the rise in labor share. Our starting point is the <b>profit</b> <b>squeeze</b> caused by the weak governance of Japanese firms. Reacting to this problem, Japanese households flee from productive capital to non-productive money. This reaction is indeed rational {{from the standpoint of}} the individual household, but it may also produce a damaging macroeconomic consequence. Specifically, the reaction is supported by the near-zero interest rate but simultaneously supports it. In fact, when the <b>profit</b> <b>squeeze</b> goes beyond a critical level, this positive feedback can severely depress capital accumulation, which may have trapped the Japanese economy in a prolonged stagnation. 本稿は 1990 年代の日本経済の長期停滞において観察された事実を互いに整合的に説明する動学的マクロ経済モデルを提示する．問題となる事実は，実質成長率の低下，マーシャルの k の上昇，消費性向の上昇，ゼロ名目金利，そして労働シェアの上昇である．議論の出発点は， 90 年代の日本企業における統治空白がもたらした利潤圧縮である．この問題に反応して，日本の家計は，生産的な資本から非生産的な貨幣へと資産蓄積手段の代替を進めた．この反応は個々の家計から見れば確かに合理的な行動だが，マクロ的には弊害をもたらす行動でもあった．とくに，その反応はゼロ金利状態における資本と貨幣の高い代替性によって支えられるだけでなく，貨幣需要増大によるデフレを通じてゼロ金利を支えるものでもあった．実際，利潤圧縮がある水準を超えて進行すると，この正のフィードバックは資本から貨幣への代替を加速し資本蓄積を激しく抑圧する．本稿はこの蓄積レジームの転換が日本経済を長期停滞に陥れた可能性を論じる...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{incorporates}} a post-Marxian view {{of investment in}} an overinvestment theory of cyclical economic crises. The Marxian crisis theory based on the tendency for the profit rate to fall (because of overmechanization) is replaced with a theory of overaccumulation of fixed capital, while the high employment <b>profit</b> <b>squeeze</b> is restated {{in terms of this}} overinvestment. Historical conditions determine overinvestment's results: when labor power is potentially scarce (precapitalist or agricultural labor reserves are largely gone), overinvestment means rising costs, falling profit rates, and crisis. Also, the resulting slump can cause either a recovery or lasting stagnation. Finally, post- 1949 U. S. data are presented to argue the theory's plausibility. ...|$|E

40|$|Specifying {{the labour}} theory {{of value in}} a way that distinguishes both {{productive}} from unproductive labour, and production workers from supervisory workers, this paper considers distributive shares in the US economy between 1964 and 2001. Trends in productive and unproductive labour are explored in full-time equivalents, hours and money. After 1979, there was a large shift of money value (not matched by a shift in either hours or employment) from the wages paid to productive labour to those paid to supervisory labour. Since the wage share in money value added of non-supervisory labour in unproductive sectors was approximately constant, the 1980 s and 1990 s also saw the <b>profits</b> share <b>squeezed</b> by the rising wage share of supervisory workers. Some implications of this are explored in the construction of a class rather than a factor approach to distributive shares. Copyright 2006, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R

40|$|Trade-related {{characteristics}} {{have only}} been recently started {{to be included in}} empirical studies analysing the determinants of the financial constraints faced by firms. A result broadly shared by these studies is that exporting firms tend to be those less financially constrained. In this paper we test this result using panel data built up from quarterly balance sheet information for 74 Argentinean big firms covering the years of the currency board regime (1992 - 2001). We estimate an investment equation splitting up the sample between exporters and non-exporters. Using three alternative econometric models (random effects, fixed effects and instrumental variables) we find that, contrary to what is commonly stressed in the literature, exporting firms are the ones facing larger financial constraints on investment. We propose an explanation for this original result based on the currency appreciation that follows financial liberalisation processes in emerging countries, particularly in Argentina, which triggers a <b>profit</b> <b>squeeze</b> phenomenon for exportable firms, reducing their investment capacity. financial constraint,investment,foreign trade,Argentine...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} {{the change in}} unemployment in 12 OECD countries over the period 1970 - 83 in terms of underlying aggregate supply and demand shifts. Earlier evidence on wage gaps (given by Brunoand Sachs) is revised and extended. For most European countries a process of reduction in gaps {{is taking place in}} the 1980 's, but the average absolute levels, when weighted by country size, are still sizeable, thus a 'classical' element of unemployment remains. However, most of the large additional increase in unemployment after 1980 (as well as the <b>profit</b> <b>squeeze</b> and investment slowdown) is ascribed to the contractionary stance of macropolicy in Europe, in contrast to the subsequent expansion and sharp fall of unemployment in the U. S. The large U. S. deficit coupled with monetary restraint and the resulting dollar appreciation also account for the sharp difference in the behavior of import prices in the U. S. and Europe which in turn may explain the considerably slower inflation deceleration in Europe and the reluctance to expand activity more rapidly. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{are in a}} {{new phase}} of the global crisis: the {{struggle}} to distribute {{the costs of the}} crisis. This crisis has been an outcome of a global process of increased exploitation and inequality, since the post- 1980 s. Neoliberalism tried to solve the crisis of the golden age of capitalism through a major attack on labour. The outcome was a dramatic decline in labour’s bargaining power and labour’s share in income across the globe in the post- 1980 s period. However, the decline in the labour share has been the source of a potential realisation crisis for the system. The decline in the purchasing power of workers limited their potential to consume. Demand deficiency and financial deregulation reduced investments despite increasing levels of profitability. Thus neoliberalism only replaced the <b>profit</b> <b>squeeze</b> and the over-accumulation problems of the 1970 s with the realisation problem. Financial innovations and debt-led consumption seemed to offer a short-term solution to this potential realisation crisis. Since summer 2007 this solution has also collapsed. The crisis was tamed through major banking rescue packages and fiscal stimuli. Now the financial speculators and corporations are relabelling the crisis a ‘sovereign debt crisis’ and pressurising the governments in a variety of countries ranging from Greece to the UK to cut spending to avoid taxes on their profits and wealth...|$|E
