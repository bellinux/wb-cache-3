5|$|The bitter {{rivalry between}} Georgia Tech and the University of Georgia flared up in 1919, when UGA mocked Tech's {{continuation}} of football during the United States' involvement in World War I. Because Tech {{was a military}} training ground, it had a complete assembly of male students. Many schools, such as UGA, lost all of their able-bodied male students to the war effort, forcing them to temporarily suspend football during the war. In fact, UGA did not <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> from 1917 to 1918.|$|E

Knowing that losing isn’t the mistress’s forte, she deliberately gives up her game. This gesture, in turn, eventually secures her the landlady’s mentorship, first in music and then in dance. Vanaja excels at these art forms {{and seems to be}} on a steadily ascending path until the arrival of Shekhar (Karan Singh), the landlady's 23-year-old son, from the United States. Shekhar is a handsome, muscular young man who is running for an office in the local government.

5|$|Although Engen did not <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> {{with the}} {{national}} team in 2012, she traveled and trained extensively with the team throughout the year. Engen trained {{with the national}} team during the first training camp of 2012 from January 7 to 15. She was not named to the 20-player roster for the 2012 CONCACAF Women's Olympic Qualifying tournament but joined the team following the tournament for a training camp in Frisco, Texas. On February 17, Engen was named to a 23-player roster that would travel to Portugal for the 2012 Algarve Cup. She was subsequently named to the roster of 21 players that would suit up for the matches of the tournament but did not make an appearance during the tournament.|$|E
5|$|Bertie the Brain was {{an early}} {{computer}} game, {{and one of the}} first games developed in the early history of video games. It was built in Toronto by Josef Kates for the 1950 Canadian National Exhibition. The four meter tall computer allowed exhibition attendees to <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> of tic-tac-toe against an artificial intelligence. The player entered a move on a lit keypad in the form of a three-by-three grid, and the game played out on a grid of lights overhead. The machine had an adjustable difficulty level. After two weeks on display by Rogers Majestic, the machine was disassembled at the end of the exhibition and largely forgotten as a curiosity.|$|E
5|$|Chess {{strategy}} {{consists of}} setting and achieving long-term positioning advantages during the game– for example, {{where to place}} different pieces– while tactics concentrate on immediate maneuver. These {{two parts of the}} chess-playing process cannot be completely separated, because strategic goals are mostly achieved through tactics, while the tactical opportunities are based on the previous strategy of <b>play.</b> <b>A</b> <b>game</b> of chess is normally divided into three phases: opening, typically the first 10 moves, when players move their pieces to useful positions for the coming battle; then middlegame; and last the endgame, when most of the pieces are gone, kings typically take a more active part in the struggle, and pawn promotion is often decisive.|$|E

He played as Brown University's catcher for the 1893 and 1894 seasons. In 1894, the team had a 23–8 record and were selected as national champions by Harper's Weekly. The night of his senior dinner, Tenney received a telephone message from Frank Selee, {{the manager of the}} Beaneaters, asking him to <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> for the team at catcher, due to the injuries of other players.|$|E
5|$|In 1972, the ferret-legging record {{stood at}} 40 seconds. A few years later, the record {{had risen to}} over one minute, and {{eventually}} to 90 minutes. In 1977, Edward Simpkins from the Isle of Wight set the new world record of five hours and ten minutes, although he only had one ferret in his trousers during the first four hours and two for the last seventy minutes. Simpkins sustained two large bites during his record-breaking attempt, but continued to <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> of darts undeterred.|$|E
5|$|In a {{retrospective}} Virtual Console review, IGN's Lucas M. Thomas commended the gameplay depth and the detailed visual presentation. He acknowledged the difficulty, even on easy, but praised {{the game as}} one of the best examples of the niche shooting gallery genre. Mat Allen of Nintendo Life found the game to be an excellent example of what the Virtual Console is for: providing gamers chances to experience quality games that were overlooked in their time. He highlighted the release as providing a cheap option to <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> which has become an expensive collector's item.|$|E

5|$|In the 1980s, Scott Armstrong {{attempted}} to convince Edward Bennett Williams, then {{the owner of}} the Baltimore Orioles, to <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> of Cuban All-Stars against his Orioles. Williams declined, as he had a position on an advisory board in the Reagan Administration, which opposed having any business with Cuba. Armstrong discussed the idea with MLB Commissioner Bart Giamatti and MLB Players Association (MLBPA) chair Donald Fehr. Though Giamatti was interested, he died before he could pursue the idea. Fehr visited Cuba during the 1994-95 MLB strike, but could not secure an antitrust exemption.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, a {{game show}} {{is a type of}} radio, television, or {{internet}} program in which contestants, television personalities or celebrities, sometimes as part of a team, <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> which involves answering trivia questions and/or solving puzzles, usually for money and/or prizes. Game shows are usually distinguishable from reality television competition shows, in which the competition consumes an entire season of episodes; in {{a game show}}, prizes can typically be won in a single match (in some cases, particularly in the ones that offer record-setting prizes, contestants can play multiple matches and accumulate a larger total).|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, at the Dunder Mifflin office, Charles Miner (Idris Elba) is {{revealed}} {{to have an}} obsession with soccer, {{and the rest of}} the employees pretend to feel the same way about it. When Jim (John Krasinski) tries claiming to be an experienced soccer player, Dwight (Rainn Wilson), attempting to humiliate Jim, suggests that the staff <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> after work in the parking lot. During the game, when Charles kicks the ball towards Jim, he ducks and the ball hits Phyllis (Phyllis Smith) in the face. Charles berates Jim for ducking, and Dwight mocks him.|$|E

5|$|After being demoted back to Buffalo, the Indians traded Robertson on August 3 to the Montreal Expos for Pierre-Luc Marceau. He {{pitched in}} seven {{games for the}} Edmonton Trappers to end the season, {{finishing}} with a 1–3 record and a 5.73 ERA. He was on the Expos' 40-man roster for September, but did not <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> for them, and in October he {{was removed from the}} roster. In November, the Cincinnati Reds signed him to a minor league contract with an invitation to spring training. During spring training in 2005, Robertson competed with Aaron Harang, Brandon Claussen, Luke Hudson, and Josh Hancock for two spots in the Reds' rotation. At the end of spring training, he was assigned to the Reds' minor league squad, the Louisville Bats. Robertson spent the season there, pitching in 28 games, 18 of them starts, and ended the year with a 5–11 record and a 5.46 ERA. After the season ended, Robertson was released, becoming a free agent.|$|E
5|$|Finally {{reaching}} Gruntilda's fortress at Cauldron Keep, Banjo and Kazooie {{confront the}} witch {{and her sisters}} in a trivia quiz show named the Tower of Tragedy Quiz in which losing competitors will be flattened under one-tonne weights. Mingella and Blobbelda lose to Banjo and Kazooie, getting crushed, but Gruntilda escapes.

The two return to Bottles' house with their remaining friends (Jamjars, Mumbo, and Wumba) to find that everyone else has celebrated without them, much to their disappointment.
