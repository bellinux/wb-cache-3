With the production capacity of China's iron and steel industry continues to expand, the amount of coke continued to rise. Coking process is current still in coking coal (coking coal, fat coal, fat gas coal, gas coal, 1 / 3 coking coal, lean coal, etc.). Although coking coal is the full range in our country, it is a relatively small species, especially the quality of coking coal is scarce varieties. It is mainly distributed in the Permian and Carboniferous, Permian coal-bearing strata in Southern China. In the international market coking coal supply is tight, and the foreign monopoly on coking coal trend is clearly.

Electrostatic sensor arrays and data fusion algorithms are combined to provide a non-intrusive solution to the measurement of fuel particle velocity, relative solid concentration and flow stability under pneumatic conveying conditions.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to experimentally investigate the performance of steam gasification of chars of <b>pure</b> <b>coal</b> (lignite, sub-bituminous), <b>pure</b> biomass (radiata pine, eucalyptus nitens) and their blends. The influences of gasification temperature, types of coal and biomass, coal-biomass blending ratio, alkali and alkaline earth metal (AAEM) in lignite, on specific gasification characteristics (producer gas composition and yield, char reactivity) were studied. In addition, synergistic effects in co-gasification of coal-biomass blend char were also investigated. This project is in accordance with objectives of the BISGAS Consortium. In this study, experiments were performed in a bench-scale gasifier at gasification temperatures of 850 °C, 900 °C and 950 °C, respectively. Two types of coals (lignite and sub-bituminous) and two kinds of biomass (radiata pine and eucalyptus nitens) from New Zealand were selected as sample fuels. From these raw materials, the chars with coal-to-biomass blending ratios of 0 : 100 (<b>pure</b> <b>coal),</b> 20 : 80, 50 : 50, 80 : 20 and 100 : 0 (pure biomass), which were derived through the devolatilization at temperature of 900 °C for 7 minutes, were gasified with steam as gasification agent. During the gasification tests, the producer gas composition and gas production were continuously analysed using a Micro gas chromatograph. When the gas production was undetectable, the gasification process {{was assumed to be}} completed and the gasification time was recorded. The gasification producer gas consisted of three main gas components: hydrogen (H 2), carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO 2). The results from gasification of chars of individual solid fuels (coal or biomass) confirmed that biomass char gasification was faster than coal char gasification. The influences of gasification temperatures were shown as: when gasification temperature increased, the H 2 yield increased in coal char gasification but decreased in biomass char gasification. In the meantime, CO yields increased while CO 2 yields decreased in both coal char and biomass char gasification. In addition, the char reactivity of all the pure fuel samples increased with elevated gasification temperatures. The results from co-gasification of coal-biomass blend char exhibited that the syngas production rate, which is defined as the total gas production divided by the gasification completion time, was enhanced by an increase in gasification temperatures as well as an increase in the biomass proportion in the blend. The AAEM species played a significant catalytic role in both gasification of <b>pure</b> <b>coal</b> chars and co-gasification of coal-biomass blend chars. The presence of AAEM increased the producer gas yield and enhanced the char reactivity. The positive synergistic effects of the coal-biomass blending char on syngas production rate only existed in the co-gasification of lignite-eucalyptus nitens blend chars. The other blend chars showed either insignificant synergistic effects or negative effects on the syngas production rate...|$|R

Cofiring coal with animal waste, termed dairy biomass (DB), is the proposed thermo-chemical method to address this concern. DB is evaluated as a cofired fuel with Wyoming Powder River Basin (PRB) sub-bituminous coal in a small-scale 29 kW_(t) low NO_(x) burner (LNB) facility. Fuel properties, of PRB and DB revealed the following: a higher heating value of 29590 kJ/kg for dry ash free (DAF) coal and 21450 kJ/kg for DAF DB. A new method called Respiratory Quotient (RQ), defined as ratio of carbon dioxide moles to oxygen moles consumed in combustion, used widely in biology, was recently introduced to engineering literature to rank global warming potential (GWP) of fuels. A higher RQ means higher CO_(2) emission and higher GWP. PRB had an RQ of 0. 90 and DB had an RQ of 0. 92. For comparison purposes, methane has an RQ of 0. 50. For unknown fuel composition, gas analyses {{can be adapted to}} estimate RQ values. The LNB was modified and cofiring experiments were performed at various equivalence ratios (phi) with <b>pure</b> <b>coal</b> and blends of PRB-DB. Standard emissions from solid fuel combustion were measured; then NO_(x) on a heat basis (g/GJ), fuel burnt fraction, and fuel nitrogen conversion percentage were estimated. The gas analyses yielded burnt fraction ranging from 89 % to 100 % and confirmed an RQ of 0. 90 to 0. 94, which is almost the same as the RQ based on fuel composition.

Despite the advantages of biomass in reducing carbon emissions from the electricity sector, the co-firing of high percentages of biomass can potentially aggravate ash related problems in the boiler. In order to develop mitigation strategies for the formation of deposits, an understanding of the ash behaviour during the combustion of high percentages of biomass is required. In this work, ash samples from El Cerrejon coal and pine biomass were characterised for their inorganic composition by X-ray fluorescence and wet chemical methods. Relationships between these two methods were found. Furthermore, the melting behaviour of ashes from <b>pure</b> <b>coal,</b> pine, and their blends were studied through ash fusion tests (AFT) and via a method using a simultaneous thermal analyser coupled to mass spectrometer (STA-MS) for the evolved gas analysis. Pine ash has lower slagging potential than El Cerrejon coal ash and results show that for 20 : 80 and 80 : 20 pine:coal ash belends the characteristic ash fusion temperatures increase with increasing pine ash content. There is unusually higher slagging potential (lower ash fusion temperatures) at a 50 : 50 blend ratio. Viscosity models produced sensible results for coal and coal/pine blends, but further refinement is required for modelling the viscosity of pure biomass ash.
