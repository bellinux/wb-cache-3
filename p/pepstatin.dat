The statyl residue of <b>pepstatin</b> {{is thought to be}} responsible for <b>pepstatin</b> inhibition of pepsin; statine is a potential analog of the transition state for catalysis by pepsin and other acid proteases. <b>Pepstatin</b> does not covalently bind pepsin and inhibition of pepsin by <b>pepstatin</b> is therefore reversible. 1-bis(diazoacetyl)-2-phenylethane reversibly inactivates pepsin at pH 5, a reaction which is accelerated by the presence of Cu(II).|$|E
5000|$|<b>Pepstatin</b> is {{a potent}} {{inhibitor}} of aspartyl proteases. It is a hexa-peptide containing the unusual amino acid statine (Sta, (3S,4S)-4-amino-3-hydroxy-6-methylheptanoic acid), having the sequence Isovaleryl-Val-Val-Sta-Ala-Sta (Iva-Val-Val-Sta-Ala-Sta). [...] It was originally isolated from cultures of various species of Actinomyces due to its ability to inhibit pepsin at picomolar concentrations. <b>Pepstatin</b> A is well known to be an inhibitor of aspartic proteinases such as pepsin, cathepsins D and E. Except for {{its role as a}} proteinase inhibitor, however, the pharmacological action of <b>pepstatin</b> A upon cells remain unclear. <b>Pepstatin</b> A suppresses receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclast differentiation. <b>Pepstatin</b> A suppresses the formation of multinuclear osteoclasts dose-dependently. This inhibition of the formation only affected osteoclast cells, i.e., not osteoblast-like cells. Furthermore, <b>pepstatin</b> A also suppresses differentiation from pre-osteoclast cells to mononuclear osteoclast cells dose-dependently. This inhibition seems to be independent of the activities of proteinases such as cathepsin D, because the formation of osteoclasts was not suppressed with the concentration that inhibited the activity of cathepsin D. Cell signaling analysis indicated that the phosphorylation of ERK was inhibited in <b>pepstatin</b> A-treated cells, while the phosphorylation of IκB and Akt showed almost no change. Furthermore, <b>pepstatin</b> A decreased the expression of nuclear factor of activated T cells c1 (NFATc1). These results suggest that <b>pepstatin</b> A suppresses the differentiation of osteoclasts through the blockade of ERK signaling and the inhibition of NFATc1 expression.|$|E

50|$|<b>Pepstatin</b> was {{the first}} {{synthetic}} renin inhibitor. It is of microbial origin and is an N-acyl-pentapeptide, more accurately: isovaleryl-L-valyl-L-valyl-statyl-L-alanyl-statine. <b>Pepstatin</b> {{was found to be}} a potent competitive inhibitor of most aspartic proteases, but a weak inhibitor of renin. Originally, it was thought to be effective in the treatment of duodenal ulcers, and went through clinical trials, but had no success. Statine, an amino acid, is thought to be responsible for the inhibitory activity of <b>pepstatin,</b> because it mimics the tetrahedral transition state of the peptide catalysis. Because of hydrophobic properties of statine, <b>pepstatin</b> has very low solubility in physiological media. Since it had low potency and poor solubility, it did not enter in vivo studies.|$|E

50|$|<b>Pepstatin,</b> {{which was}} {{described}} in 1972, was the first synthetic renin inhibitor, but poor pharmacokinetic properties prevented it from entering in vivo investigations. The first generation of renin inhibitors, such as H-142, were peptide analogues of angiotensinogen. However, these inhibitors had also limited drug-like properties. Hopes of breakthrough appeared in 1982 when development of the second generation renin inhibitors began. This generation consisted of peptide-like compounds, such as remikiren, enalkiren and zanikiren. They had more drug-like rather than substrate-like properties, and in 1990 they went to clinical trials. The second generation had its limitations and never completed clinical trials.|$|E
50|$|Research {{aimed at}} {{development}} of renin inhibitors as potential antihypertensive agents {{had led to}} the discovery of compounds that blocked the action of this peptide cleaving enzyme. The amino acid sequence cleaved by renin was found to be fortuitously the same as that required to produce the HIV peptide coat. Structure-activity studies on renin inhibitors proved to be of great value for developing HIV protease inhibitors. Incorporation of an amino alcohol moiety proved crucial to inhibitory activity for many of these agents. This unit is closely related to the one found in the statine, an unusual amino acid that forms part of the <b>pepstatin,</b> a fermentation product that inhibits protease enzymes.|$|E
50|$|A solvated ligand {{that binds}} the protein of {{interest}} is likely to exist as an equilibrium mixture of several conformers. Likewise the solvated protein also exists as several conformers in equilibrium. Formation of protein-ligand complex includes displacement of the solvent molecules that occupy the binding site of the ligand, to produce a solvated complex. Because this necessarily means that the interaction is entropically disfavored, highly favorable enthalpic contacts between the protein and the ligand must compensate for the entropic loss. The design of new ligands is usually based on the modification of known ligands for the target proteins. Proteases are enzymes that catalyze hydrolysis of a peptide bond. These proteins have evolved to recognize and bind the transition state of peptide hydrolysis reaction which is a tetrahedral intermediate. Therefore, the main protease inhibitors are tetrahedral intermediate mimics having an alcohol or a phosphate group. Examples are saquinavir, ritonavir, <b>pepstatin,</b> etc.|$|E

Prior exposure of neutrophils to <b>pepstatin</b> A before {{the addition of}} CB, suppressed, in a time-dependent fashion, the subsequent production of O 2 - and exocytotic response. The rate and amount of enzymes released and O 2 - generated by <b>pepstatin</b> A-activated neutrophils were significantly enhanced {{in the presence of}} extracellular calcium. <b>Pepstatin</b> A-elicited degranulation and O 2 - production were suppressed by the intracellular calcium antagonist, 8 -(N,N-diethylamino) -octyl-(3, 4, 5 -trimethoxy) benzoate hydrochloride (TMB- 8). Granule exocytosis and O 2 - generation by <b>pepstatin</b> A-treated neutrophils were suppressed by the sulphydryl reagents, N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) and iodoacetic acid (IA), and by the glycolytic inhibitor, 2 -deoxy-D-glucose (2 -DG). Sodium cyanide was inactive.

The peptide-coupling reagent we used, benzotriazolyloxytris(dimethylamino) phosphonium hexafluorophosphate, allowed us to obtain readily pure <b>pepstatin</b> homologues with high yields (60 - 83 %). Pepstatylarginine methyl ester and pepstatylglutamic acid were about one order of magnitude more water-soluble than <b>pepstatin.</b> The four homologues and <b>pepstatin</b> were tested in vitro as inhibitors for highly purified pig and human renins acting on the N-acetyltetradecapeptide substrate. The 50 % inhibitory concentrations (IC 50) of the homologues were ranged from 0. 01 to 1 microM against porcine renin at pH 6. 0 (<b>pepstatin</b> IC 50 approximately 0. 32 microM) and from 5. 8 to 41 microM against human renin at pH 6. 5 (<b>pepstatin</b> IC 50 approximately 17 microM). By three different graphical methods we showed that <b>pepstatin</b> and the four homologues behaved as competitive inhibitors for porcine renin.

40|$|<b>Pepstatin</b> A, a pentapeptide {{with the}} {{molecular}} weight of 686, is a naturally occurring inhibitor of aspartyl proteases secreted by Streptomyces species. Above a critical concentration of 0. 1 mM at low ionic strength and neutral pH, it can polymerize into filaments which may extend over several micrometers. After negative staining, these filaments show a helical substructure with characteristic diameters ranging from 6 to 12 nm. Selected images at higher magnification suggest the filaments {{are composed of}} two intertwined 6 nm strands. This is {{in agreement with the}} optical diffraction analysis which additionally established a periodic pitch of 25 nm for the helical intertwining. Rotary shadowing of the <b>pepstatin</b> A filaments clearly demonstrated the right-handedness of the helical twist. In physiological salt solution or at higher concentrations of <b>pepstatin</b> A, a variety of higher order structures were observed, including ribbons, sheets and cylinders with both regular and twisted or irregular geometries. <b>Pepstatin</b> A can interact with intermediate filament subunit proteins. These proteins possess a long, alpha-helical rod domain that forms coiled-coil dimers, which through both hydrophobic and ionic interactions form tetramers which, in turn, in the presence of physiological salt concentrations, polymerize into the 10 nm intermediate filaments. In the absence of salt, <b>pepstatin</b> A and intermediate filament proteins polymerize into long filaments with a rough surface and a diameter of 15 - 17 nm. This polymerization appears to be primarily driven by nonionic interactions between <b>pepstatin</b> A and polymerization-competent forms of intermediate filament proteins, resulting in a composite filament. Polymerization-incompetent proteolytic fragments of vimentin, lacking portions of the head and/or tail domain, failed to copolymerize with <b>pepstatin</b> A into long filaments under these conditions. These peptides, as well as bovine serum albumin, were found to stick to the surface of <b>pepstatin</b> A filaments, ribbons and sheets. Independent evidence for direct association of <b>pepstatin</b> A with intermediate filament subunit proteins was provided not only by electron microscopy but also by UV difference spectra. <b>Pepstatin</b> A loses its ability to inhibit the aspartyl protease of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 following polymerization into the higher order structures described here. The amazing fact that <b>pepstatin</b> A can spontaneously self-associate to form very large polymers seems to be a more rare event for such small peptides. The other examples of synthetic or naturally occurring oligopeptides discussed in this review which are able to polymerize into higher order structures possess a common property, their hydrophobicity, often manifested by clusters of valine or isoleucine residues...|$|E
40|$|<b>Pepstatin</b> A, a pentapeptide aspartyl {{protease}} inhibitor, {{can interact}} with intermediate filament (IF) subunit proteins and induce their polymerization {{in the absence}} of salt into long filaments with a rough surface and a diameter of 15 – 17 nm.

Pretreatment of neutropenic mice with the aspartic protease inhibitor <b>pepstatin</b> A by intraperi-toneal injection afforded strong dose-dependent protection against a subsequent lethal intranasal dose of an aspartic protease-producing strain (ATCC 32354) of C. albicans. Administration of 0. 6 mg of <b>pepstatin</b> A kg of body weight 21 prior to challenge and on days 1 to 4 postchallenge resulted in 100 % survival at day 15 post-challenge, whereas 100 % of animals receiving saline had died by day 6. This effect was comparable to the dose-dependent protection obtained with amphotericin B, which resulted in 100 % survival when administered at 0. 1 mg kg 21. The reduction in mortality afforded by <b>pepstatin</b> A correlated with its dose-dependent blockade of C. albicans numbers in the lungs, liver, and kidneys. By sharp contrast, no protection by <b>pepstatin</b> A was observed in mice challenged intravenously, and protection was markedly attenuated in mice given <b>pepstatin</b> A after intranasal challenge only.

40|$|Insertion of {{fluorine}} into {{organic molecules}} is well-known {{to affect the}} molecule's electronic distributions and conformational properties in ways that can be beneficial in drug development. However, the effects of fluorination have not been widely investigated {{in the context of}} peptides, which limits the development of peptide-based drugs. In this project, stereoselective fluorination was employed to (i) control the conformations of peptides; and (ii) enhance the potency of a peptide-based enzyme inhibitor. Difluorinated GABA analogues, which are known to adopt different conformations depending on the fluorine stereochemistry, were synthesised through a new synthetic route which improved on the yield and stereoselectivity in comparison to the previously published method. The anti- and syn-difluorinated GABA analogues were then incorporated into γ-peptides through solid-phase peptide synthesis, and it was found through NMR and modelling studies that anti-difluoro-GABA could stabilise certain helical and ribbon-like secondary structures, while syn-difluoro GABA destabilised them. To investigate the effect of fluorine substitution on the biological activity of peptides, analogues of <b>pepstatin</b> A were synthesised. <b>Pepstatin</b> A is a potent inhibitor of aspartic proteases and contains a statine residue which mimics the tetrahedral intermediate of peptide hydrolysis. Docking studies revealed that fluorinated <b>pepstatin</b> analogues should provide close mimics of the tetrahedral intermediate, thus giving more potent enzyme inhibitors.

40|$|Background: Candida albicans, a {{commensal}} organism, {{is a part}} of {{the normal}} flora of healthy individuals. However, once the host immunity is compromised, C. albicans opportunistically causes recurrent superficial or fatal systemic candidiasis. Secreted aspartic proteases (Sap), encoded by 10 types of SAP genes, have been suggested to contribute to various virulence processes. Thus, it is important to elucidate their biochemical properties for better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that how Sap isozymes damage host tissues. Methodology/Principal Findings: The SAP 7 gene was cloned from C. albicans SC 5314 and heterogeneously produced by Pichia pastoris. Measurement of Sap 7 proteolytic activity using the FRETS- 25 Ala library showed that Sap 7 was a <b>pepstatin</b> A-insensitive protease. To understand why Sap 7 was insensitive to <b>pepstatin</b> A, alanine substitution mutants of Sap 7 were constructed. We found that M 242 A and T 467 A mutants had normal proteolytic activity and sensitivity to <b>pepstatin</b> A. M 242 and T 467 were located in close proximity to the entrance to an active site, and alanine substitution at these positions widened the entrance. Our results suggest that this alteration might allow increased accessibility of <b>pepstatin</b> A to the active site. This inference was supported by the observation that the T 467 A mutant has stronger proteolytic activity than the wild type.

40|$|The {{fluorescence}} of pepsin-bound 2 -p-toluidinylnaphthalene- 6 -sulfonate (TNS) decreases {{upon the}} binding of Streptomyces pepsin inhibitor (SPI) with the enzyme. Equilibrium dialysis experiments showed this decrease to {{arise from the}} release of TNS from pepsin due to the binding of SPI in a molar ratio of 1 : 1. The results of stopped-flow kinetic study on the concentration dependence of the apparent rate constant for the binding reaction between pepsin and SPI using the fluorescence decrease of TNS as a probe {{were consistent with the}} interpretation that the binding reaction consists of at least two steps, including a fast bimolecular step followed by a slow unimolecular step. It was found that a fluorescence decrease occurred in both steps. The rate-pH profile sug-gested the participation of some ionizable group(s) (possibly a carboxyl group) in the binding. Studies of interactions between an enzyme and substrate analogs offer useful information on the. structure of the active site and the reaction mech-anism of the enzyme. <b>Pepstatin</b> (/), a pentapeptide from Streptomyces, is regarded as a substrate analog for pepsin and several other acid proteinases. Marciniszyn et al. suggested, based on their studies with <b>pepstatin</b> and its derivatives, that <b>pepstatin</b> can be regarded as a transition state analog (2). Streptomyces pepsin inhibitor (SPI) (3, 4), which was isolated by Murao and Satoi (5), has a molec-ular structure very similar to that of <b>pepstatin</b> (6) ...|$|E
40|$|H- 189, a {{synthetic}} human renin inhibitor, and <b>pepstatin</b> A, a naturally occurring inhibitor of aspartic proteinases, have been co-crystallized with the fungal aspartic proteinase endothiapepsin (EC 3. 4. 23. 6). H- 189 [Pro-His-Pro-Phe-His-Sta-(statyl) -Val-Ile-His-Lys] is an analogue of human angiotensinogen. <b>Pepstatin</b> A [Iva(isovaleryl) -Val-Val-Sta-Ala-Sta] is a blocked pentapeptide which inhibits many aspartic proteinases. The {{structures of the}} complexes have been determined by X-ray diffraction and refined to crystallographic R-factors of 0. 15 and 0. 16 at resolutions of 0. 18 nm (1. 8 A) and 0. 2 nm (2. 0 A) respectively. H- 189 is in an extended conformation, in which the statine residue is a dipeptide analogue of P 1 and P' 1 {{as indicated by the}} conformation and network of contacts and hydrogen bonds. <b>Pepstatin</b> A has an extended conformation to the P' 2 alanine residue, but the leucyl side chain of the terminal statine residue binds back into the S' 1 subsite, and an inverse gamma-turn occurs between P' 1 and P' 3. The hydroxy moiety of the statine at P 1 in both complexes displaces the solvent molecule that hydrogen-bonds with the catalytic aspartate residues (32 and 215) in the native enzyme. Solvent molecules originally present in the native structure at the active site are displaced on inhibitor binding (12 when <b>pepstatin</b> A binds; 16 when H- 189 binds) ...|$|E
