40|$|Abstract. The {{influence}} of strongly absorbing N 2 laser radiation on <b>pores</b> <b>formation</b> on a surface of Si single crystal {{has been investigated}} using optical microscope, atomic force microscope and photoluminescence. After irradiation by the laser and subsequent electrochemical etching in HF acid solution morphological changes of the irradiated parts of a surface of Si were not observed. At the same time, <b>pores</b> <b>formation</b> on the non-irradiated parts of Si surface took place. The porous part of the Si surface is characterized by strong photoluminescence in red part of spectra with maximum at 1. 88 eV and intensity of photoluminescence increases with current density. Suppression of the <b>pores</b> <b>formation</b> by the laser radiation is explained with inversion of Si type conductivity from p-type to n-type. This fact is explained by Thermogradient effect – generation and redistribution of the intrinsic defects in gradient of temperature. It was shown that the depth of n-Si layer on p-Si substrate depends on intensity of laser radiation and it increases with intensity of laser radiation.

In the insect gut, which is {{alkaline}} with a pH >9.5, the protein is solubilized and activated by gut proteases.

25|$|Anthrax toxin is a three-protein {{exotoxin}} secreted by virulent {{strains of}} the bacterium, Bacillus anthracis—the causative agent of anthrax. The toxin was first discovered by Harry Smith in 1954. Anthrax toxin is composed of a cell-binding protein, known as protective antigen (PA), and two enzyme components, called edema factor (EF) and lethal factor (LF). These three protein components act together to impart their physiological effects. Assembled complexes containing the toxin components are endocytosed. In the endosome, the enzymatic components of the toxin translocate into the cytoplasm of a target cell. Once in the cytosol, the enzymatic components of the toxin disrupts various immune cell functions, namely cellular signaling and cell migration. The toxin may even induce cell lysis, as is observed for macrophage cells. Anthrax toxin allows the bacteria to evade the immune system, proliferate, and ultimately kill the host animal. Research on anthrax toxin also provides insight into the generation of macromolecular assemblies, and on protein translocation, <b>pore</b> <b>formation,</b> endocytosis, and other biochemical processes.|$|E
25|$|The {{formation}} of the β-barrel pore is facilitated with a drop in pH. To form the barrel when the pH drops, PA63 domain 2 must undergo the greatest conformation change. Upon examination {{of the structure of}} domain 2 (Fig. 7), one can see that this domain contains a Greek-key motif (the gold portion in Fig. 7). A general schematic of a Greek-key motif is shown in Fig. 8. Attached to the Greek-key in domain 2 is a large disordered loop. The necessity of this loop in <b>pore</b> <b>formation</b> is shown through using mutagenesis and proteolysis of the loop with chymotrypsin. Additional electrophysiological measurements of cysteine substitutions place the amino acids of this loop inside the lumen of the membrane inserted pore. The disordered loop in domain 2 also has a pattern of alternating hydrophobic and hydrophilic amino acids, which is a pattern conserved in the membrane-spanning portions of porins. The only problem is that the loop is not large enough to span a membrane in a β-barrel. This membrane insertion could only occur with additional conformational changes. A large conformational change takes place where the Greek-key motif unfolds, forming a β-hairpin that projects downward into the membrane and forms a β-barrel with the other 6 monomers of the complex (figures 9a and 9b). The final pore has a diameter of 12 Å (1.2nm), which fits the theoretical value of this model.|$|E

2500|$|Alterations {{occur in}} Lipid A. Salmonella species reduce the {{fluidity}} of their outer membrane by increasing hydrophobic interactions between an {{increased number of}} Lipid A acyl tails by adding myristate to Lipid A with 2-hydroxymyristate and forming hepta-acylated Lipid A by adding palmitate. The increased hydrophobic moment is thought to retard or abolish antimicrobial peptide insertion and <b>pore</b> <b>formation.</b> The residues undergo alteration in membrane proteins. In some Gram-negative bacteria, alteration {{in the production of}} outer membrane proteins correlates with resistance to killing by antimicrobial peptides. Nontypeable Hemophilus influenzae transports AMPs into the interior of the cell, where they are degraded. And H. influenzae remodels its membranes to make it appear as if the bacterium has already been successfully attacked by AMPs, protecting it from being attacked by more AMPs. ATP-binding cassette transporters import antimicrobial peptides and the resistance-nodulation cell-division efflux pump exports antimicrobial peptides. Both transporters have been associated with antimicrobial peptide resistance. Bacteria produce proteolytic enzymes, which may degrade antimicrobial peptides leading to their resistance. Outer membrane vesicles produced by Gram-negative bacteria bind the antimicrobial peptides and sequester them away from the cells, thereby protecting the cells. The outer membrane vesicles are also known to contain various proteases, peptidases and other lytic enzymes, which may have a role in degrading the extracellular peptide and nucleic acid molecules, which if allowed to reach to the bacterial cells may be dangerous for the cells. Cyclic-di-GMP signaling had also been involved in the regulation of antimicrobial peptide resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa ...|$|E

50|$|Once the tetramer is {{inserted}} into the cell membrane, two mechanism of actions can occur. First, insertion may lead to <b>pore</b> <b>formation</b> and possibly other effects, and second, the receptor may be activated, which leads to intracellular signaling. The four heads of the tetramer form a bowl surrounding the pore, which is restricted at one point to 10 Å. Millimolar concentrations of Ca2+ and Mg2+ strongly catalyses tetramer formation, suggesting that the tetrametric state is divalent cation-dependent, while EDTA favours formation of the dimer. Research also shows that concentrations of La3+ higher than 100 µM also block tetramerisation. <b>Pore</b> <b>formation</b> can occur in pure lipid membranes, but reconstituted receptors greatly increase <b>pore</b> <b>formation.</b> Biological membranes block <b>pore</b> <b>formation</b> when no α-LTX receptors are present (neurexin, latrophilin, PTPσ). It is also known that the three highly conserved cysteine residues are involved with α-LTX receptor binding, because mutants containing serine instead of cysteine residues did not induce toxicity. The N-terminal domain needs to fold properly, in which the disulfide bonds need to be functional. The α-LTX toxin is bound by a small protein, LMWP or latrodectin. It has been observed that <b>pore</b> <b>formation</b> in lipid bilayers is impossible when latrodectin is unavailable. Lactrodectin {{has no effect on}} α-LTX toxicity.|$|E
