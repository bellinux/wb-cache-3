Table 5 shows the selectivity of O 2 /N 2, CO 2 /N 2, and CO 2 /CH 4 for the PIM- 1 and f-MWCNTs/PIM- 1 MMM, measured at 2 bar. At 0.5 to 2 wt.% f-MWCNTs loading the selectivity of CO 2 /N 2 and O 2 /N 2 {{was found to be}} higher than for pure PIM- 1. The high selectivity values of O 2 /N 2 at 0.5 to 2 wt.% f-MWCNTs loading might have resulted due to the intimate interface interaction of f-MWCNTs-polymer chain. In contrary, the CO 2 /CH 4 selectivity of the f-MWCNTs MMM is worse compared with the pure PIM- 1 membrane. The functional groups on the MWCNTs have a significant role in gas selectivity. The PEG group, confirmed by FTIR in Figure 4, has stronger interaction with a <b>polar</b> <b>gas,</b> such as CO 2 than a nonpolar gas, e.g., N 2. In that case the <b>polar</b> <b>gas</b> solubility can be enhanced and the gas permeability be increased which facilitates the improvement of the total CO 2 /N 2 selectivity. However, there is no improvement in the CO 2 /CH 4 selectivity as f-MWCNTs loading increased from 0.5 to 3 wt.% in the polymer matrix.|$|E

The method developed here is compatible with theories referring to a curved space (e. g. general relativity), and is achieved at a purely classical (non-quantified) level, in spite of an analogy with the quantum theories. An approximate method of calculation, which is derived almost automatically from the definition of macroscopic quantities, is also developed. By using a spherical approximation, an approximate calculation is carried out on three classical examples, namely: the evaluation of the conductivity of an emulsion, the calculus of the dielectric permeability of a <b>polar</b> <b>gas,</b> and the derivation of the properties of a `cold plasma' in the general relativity theory.

It is shown that during pyrolysis the methyl ligand is replaced with hydroxyl groups, some of which condense into siloxane linkages. The retained hydroxyl groups are thought to provide adsorption sites throughout the material onto which <b>polar</b> <b>gas</b> molecules (such as CO 2) can adsorb, and diffuse under a pressure gradient.

40|$|Electrostatically charged aerosol {{nanoparticles}} strongly attract surrounding <b>polar</b> <b>gas</b> molecules {{due to a}} charge-dipole interaction. In humid air, {{the substantial}} electrostatic attraction and acceleration of surrounding water vapour molecules towards charged combustible nanoparticles cause intense electrostatic hydration and preferential oxidation of these nanoparticles by accelerated water vapor molecules rather than non-polar oxygen molecules. In particular, electrostatic acceleration, acquired by surrounding water vapour molecules {{at a distance of}} their mean free path from the minimally charged iron metal nanoparticle can increase an oxidative activity of these polar molecules with respect to the nanoparticle by a factor of one million. Intense electrostatic hydration of charged metal nanoparticles converts the nanoparticle's oxide based shells into the hydroxide based electrolyte shells, transforming these nanoparticles into metal/air core-shell nanobatteries, periodically short-circuited by intra-particle field and thermionic electron emission. Partially synchronized breakdowns within trillions of nanoparticles-nanobatteries turn a cloud of charged nanoparticles-nanobatteries - ball lightning - into a powerful radio-frequency aerosol generator. Electrostatic hydration and charge-catalyzed oxidation of charged combustible nanoparticles also contribute to a self-oscillating thermocycling process of evolution and periodic auto-ignition of inflammable gases near to the nanoparticle's surface. The described effects might be of interest for the improvement of certain nanotechnological processes and to better understand ball lightning phenomenon. Comment: 58 pages, 18 figure...|$|E

According to DSC experiments, the melting temperature for PEO phase in Pebax 1074 /PEG 1500 blend membranes increases {{with the increase}} of PEG 1500 content, which will influence the gas transport properties. Compared with Pebax 1074 membrane, the gas transport through Pebax 1074 /PEG 1500 blend membranes can be divided into crystalline, transition and amorphous regions due to the temperature dependence of PEO thermal transition. And the gas permeability can be described by two different Arrhenius equations in crystalline and amorphous regions. For Pebax 1074 /PEG 1500 blend membranes in crystalline region, the gas permeability is lower than that for Pebax 1074 membrane, which decreases with the increasing PEG 1500 content. But in amorphous region, the gas permeability is higher than that for Pebax 1074 membrane, which also increases with the increasing PEG 1500 content. For N- 2, H- 2 and CH 4, the gas permeation behavior is mainly influenced by the hydrostatic pressure at high temperature, but for the <b>polar</b> <b>gas</b> CO 2, it is dominated by CO 2 -induced plasticization effect and the hydrostatic pressure simultaneously.

30|$|The {{dependence}} of ideal selectivity of selected gas pairs on {{the concentration of}} PDA-TiNT in PBI (Fig.  6 c) and PPO (Fig.  6 d), respectively, is presented in Fig.  6. As the plots indicate PDA-TiNTs influence mainly the gas selectivity of PBI based MMMs. Addition of 9 wt.% PDA-TiNT to PBI resulted in an increase of 112 and 63  % in the selectivity of CO 2 /N 2 or CO 2 /CH 4, respectively. Similarly, the selectivity of H 2 /N 2, H 2 /O 2, and O 2 /N 2 increased by 57, 40, and 12.50  %, respectively. The high selectivity values for CO 2 /N 2 and CO 2 /CH 4 {{can be explained by}} the polar functional groups of PDA on the TiNTs, confirmed by FTIR. Those polar groups usually exhibit a stronger interaction with polar gases, such as CO 2, than with nonpolar gases, e.g. N 2 or CH 4. Thus, the <b>polar</b> <b>gas</b> solubility can be enhanced and the gas permeability can be increased which facilitates the improvement of the total CO 2 /N 2 or CO 2 /CH 4 selectivity [12]. Ideal selectivities of the other gas pairs further demonstrate that gases with a smaller kinetic diameter, e.g. H 2 permeate easily through the intimately connected PBI matrix with PDA-TiNT than bigger gas molecules, e.g. N 2 or O 2, resulting in higher selectivity ratio.|$|E
30|$|The present work {{reports on}} the gas {{transport}} behavior of mixed matrix membranes (MMM) which were prepared from multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and dispersed within polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIM- 1) matrix. The MWCNTs were chemically functionalized with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) for a better dispersion in the polymer matrix. MMM-incorporating functionalized MWCNTs (f-MWCNTs) were fabricated by dip-coating method using microporous polyacrylonitrile membrane as a support and were characterized for gas separation performance. Gas permeation measurements show that MMM incorporated with pristine or functionalized MWCNTs exhibited improved gas separation performance compared to pure PIM- 1. The f-MWCNTs MMM show better performance in terms of permeance and selectivity in comparison to pristine MWCNTs. The gas permeances of the derived MMM are increased to approximately 50 % without sacrificing the selectivity at 2 wt.% of f-MWCNTs' loading. The PEG groups on the MWCNTs have strong interaction with CO 2 which increases the solubility of <b>polar</b> <b>gas</b> and limit the solubility of nonpolar gas, which is advantageous for CO 2 /N 2 selectivity. The addition of f-MWCNTs inside the polymer matrix also improved the long-term gas transport stability of MMM in comparison with PIM- 1. The high permeance, selectivity, and long term stability of the fabricated MMM suggest that the reported approach can be utilized in practical gas separation technology.|$|E

The hybrid simulation {{results show that the}} adsorption energy, Mulliken charge and band gap of analytes (CO 2 and H 2 O) in polyaniline are relatively sensitive to the position and the amounts of –SO 3 −Na+, and these parameters would affect the sensitivity of Na-SPANI/EB-PANI towards CO 2. The sensitivity of Na-SPANI (III) /EB-PANI towards CO 2 can be greatly improved by two orders of magnitude, which is in agreement with the experimental study. In addition, we also demonstrate that introducing –SO 3 −Na+ groups at the rings can notably affect the gas transport properties of polyaniline. Comparative studies indicate that the effect of ionizable group on polyaniline as gas sensing materials for the <b>polar</b> <b>gas</b> molecule (H 2 O) is more significant than that for the nonpolar gas molecule (CO 2).
