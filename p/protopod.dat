40|$|Morphological {{and size}} {{dimorphism}} between genders of the benthopelagic shrimp Pasiphaea sivado are {{reported for the}} first time in the present work. All five pleopod <b>protopods</b> of females are thinner and more elongated than the male pleopod <b>protopods,</b> which in turn are anteriorly rounded and have robust shapes. The shape variability of the second pleopod <b>protopods</b> was also analysed using geometric morphometrics techniques which clearly differentiated between the thinner, elongated shape of the females and the robust shape of males. An important application of the observations of sexual dimorphism in pleopod shape in adult P. sivado is, from now on, the ability to quickly assess the gender of individuals when fisheries and population biology studies are carried out in the field unaided by a magnifying. A critical size from which the population sex ratio biases changed from female to male dominance was found in all studied western Mediterranean populations of P. sivado. This critical size different and became progressively smaller from populations in the Alboran Sea to populations in the Catalan Sea. Concerning sex ratio, no significant tendency of gender segregation was found across the bathymetric distribution range of the species, suggesting that this species does not perform differential depth distribution by gender...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT We {{examined}} {{the formation of}} motile, chemotactically active, anucleate fragments from human blood polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN, granulocytes), induced by the brief application of heat. These granule-poor fragments are former <b>protopods</b> (leading fronts, lamellipodia) that become uncoupled from {{the main body of}} the cell and leave it, at first with a connecting filament that breaks and seals itself. The usual random orientation of such filaments can be controlled by preorientation of cells in a gradient of the chemotactic peptide, N-formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine (F-Met-Leu-Phe) (2 X 10 - 9 M- 1 X 10 - 8 M). Cytochalasin B, 2. 5 - 5 #g/ml, prevents fragment formation; colchicine, 10 - 5 M, does not. In scanning electron micrographs, fragments are ruffled and the cell body rounded up and rather smooth. In transmission electron micrographs, fragments contain microfilaments but lack centrioles and microtubules. Like intact cells, both bound and free fragments can respond chemotactically to an erythrocyte destroyed by laser microirradiation (necrotaxis); the free, anucleate fragments may do so repeatedly, even after having been held overnight at ambient temperatures. We propose the name cytokineplast for the result of this self-purification of motile apparatus. The exodus of the motile machinery from the granulocyte requires anchoring of the bulk o...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{motility}} and deformability of lymphokine-activated killer cells, purified {{by their}} adherence to plas-tic (A-LAK cells), {{was investigated in}} vivo and in vitro. In vitro, A-LAK cells were observed as intrinsically mo-tile cells. They continuously changed their shape while forming <b>protopods</b> or pseudopods and crawled over the culture surface. A-LAK cells were able to migrate across micropores of 3 sm diameter, which was three times smaller than the average diameter of an A-LAK cell. Even {{in the absence of}} serum factors and of interleukin- 2 (IL- 2), {{more than half of the}} inoculated cells migrated across such micropore membranes within 18 h. Electron microscopic examination of these micropore membranes showed that the A-LAK cells were highly deformable. A-LAK cells also migrated across a confluent monolayer of endothelium-like 1 OT 1 / 2 cells. After 24 h incubation on the monolayers, about 20 % of the A-LAK cells were found underneath the monolayer. There, they actively moved in the narrow space between the monolayer and the bottom of the culture dish. In vivo IL- 2 -activated cells showing the large granular lymphocyte morphology accumulated in the hepatic microvasculature. Electron microscopic observations indicate that these cells did not accumulate by mechanical entrapment due to rigidity and size but rather by adherence to the endothelial lining of the sinusoidal capillaries. This also appeared to be the case for adoptively transferred A-LAK cells, which were seen to be attached to the capillary wall. These observa-tions stress the importance of adhesive entrapment to cx-plain the accumulation of intravenously transferred LAK cells in the vascular beds. J. Leukoc. Biol. 51 : 214 - 219...|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} {{the formation of}} motile, chemotactically active, anucleate fragments from human blood polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN, granulocytes), induced by the brief application of heat. These granule-poor fragments are former <b>protopods</b> (leading fronts, lamellipodia) that become uncoupled from {{the main body of}} the cell and leave it, at first with a connecting filament that breaks and seals itself. The usual random orientation of such filaments can be controlled by preorientation of cells in a gradient of the chemotactic peptide, N-formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine (F-Met-Leu-Phe) (2 x 10 (- 9) M- 1 x 10 (- 8)). Cytochalsin B, 2. 5 - 5 μg/ml, prevents fragment formation; colchicine, 10 (- 5) M, does not. In scanning electron micrographs, fragments are ruffled and the cell body rounded up and rather smooth. In transmission electron micrographs, fragments contain microfilaments but lack centrioles and microtubules. Like intact cells, both bound and free fragments can respond chemotactically to an erythrocyte destroyed by laser microirradiation (necrotaxis); the free, anucleate fragments may do so repeatedly, even after having been held overnight at ambient temperatures. We propse the name cytokineplast for the result of this self-purification of motile apparatus. The exodus of the motile machinery from the granulocyte requires anchoring of the bulk of the cell to glass and uncoupling, which may involve heat-induced dysfunction of the centrosome. In ultrastructural studies of the centrosomal region after heat, centriolar structure remains intact, but pericentriolar osmiophilic material appears condensed, and microtubules are sparse. These changes are found in all three blood cell types examined: PMN, eosinophil, and monocyte. Of these, the first two make fragments under our conditions; the more sluggish monocyte does not. Uncoupling is further linked to centrosomal dysfunction by the observation that colchicines-treated granulocytes (10 (- 5) M, to destroy the centrosome’s efferent arm) make fragments after less heat than controls. If motive force and orientation are specified mainly from the organelle-excluding leading front, then endoplasmic streaming in PMN is a catch-up phenomenon, and microtubules do not provide the vector of locomotion but rather stabilize and orient the “baggage” (nucleus, granuloplasm) —i. e., they prevent fishtailing. Moreover, constraints emanating from the centrosome may now be extended to include, maintenance of the motile machinery as an integral part of the cell...|$|R

40|$|Study of the {{mechanical}} properties of leukocytes is useful to understand their passage through narrow capillaries and interaction with other cells.
