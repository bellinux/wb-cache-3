5|$|Efforts {{to control}} the spread of malaria {{suffered}} a major setback in 1930: entomologist Raymond Corbett Shannon discovered imported disease-bearing Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes living in Brazil (DNA analysis later revealed the actual species to be A. arabiensis). This species of mosquito is a particularly efficient vector for malaria and is native to Africa. In 1938, the introduction of this vector caused the greatest epidemic of malaria ever seen in the New World. However, complete eradication of A. gambiae from northeast Brazil and thus from the New World was achieved in 1940 by the systematic application of the arsenic-containing compound <b>Paris</b> <b>green</b> to breeding places, and of pyrethrum spray-killing to adult resting places.|$|E

25|$|<b>Paris</b> <b>green</b> (copper(II) acetate triarsenite or copper(II) acetoarsenite) is an {{inorganic}} compound. It is {{a highly}} toxic emerald-green crystalline powder {{that has been used}} as a rodenticide and insecticide, and also as a pigment, despite its toxicity. It is also used as a blue colorant for fireworks. The color of <b>Paris</b> <b>green</b> is said to range from a pale blue green when very finely ground, to a deeper green when coarsely ground.|$|E
25|$|It {{combines}} with {{arsenic trioxide}} to form copper acetoarsenite, a powerful insecticide and fungicide called <b>Paris</b> <b>Green</b> or Schweinfurt Green.|$|E
25|$|Scheele's {{green is}} a {{chemically}} simpler, less brilliant, and less permanent, synthetic copper-arsenic pigment {{used for a}} rather short time before <b>Paris</b> <b>green</b> was first prepared, which was approximately 1814. It was popular as a wallpaper pigment and would degrade, with moisture and molds, to arsine gas. <b>Paris</b> <b>green</b> may have also been used in wallpaper to some extent and may have also degraded similarly. Both pigments were once used in printing ink formulations.|$|E

25|$|The ancient Romans {{used one}} of them, {{possibly}} conichalcite, as a green pigment. The <b>Paris</b> <b>green</b> paint used by the Impressionists {{is said to have}} been composed of relatively coarse particles. Later, the chemical was produced with increasingly small grinds and without carefully removing impurities; its permanence suffered. It is likely that it was ground more finely for use in watercolors and inks, too.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} {{applications}} exploit arsenic's toxicity, {{including the use}} of the oxide as a wood preservative. Copper arsenates, which are derived from arsenic trioxide, are used on a large scale as a wood preservative in the US and Malaysia, but such materials are banned {{in many parts of the}} world. This practice remains controversial. In combination with copper(II) acetate arsenic trioxide gives the vibrant pigment known as <b>Paris</b> <b>green</b> used in paints and as a rodenticide. This application has been discontinued.|$|E

25|$|Before DDT, {{eliminating}} mosquito {{breeding grounds}} by drainage or poisoning with <b>Paris</b> <b>green</b> or pyrethrum was sometimes successful. In {{parts of the}} world with rising living standards, the elimination of malaria was often a collateral benefit of the introduction of window screens and improved sanitation. A variety of usually simultaneous interventions represents best practice. These include antimalarial drugs to prevent or treat infection; improvements in public health infrastructure to diagnose, sequester and treat infected individuals; bednets and other methods intended to keep mosquitoes from biting humans; and vector control strategies such as larvaciding with insecticides, ecological controls such as draining mosquito breeding grounds or introducing fish to eat larvae and indoor residual spraying (IRS) with insecticides, possibly including DDT. IRS involves the treatment of interior walls and ceilings with insecticides. It is particularly effective against mosquitoes, since many species rest on an indoor wall before or after feeding. DDT is one of 12 WHO–approved IRS insecticides.|$|E
500|$|It {{seems likely}} the British {{would have used}} poison gas against troops on beaches. General Brooke, in an {{annotation}} to his published war diaries, stated that he [...] "...had every intention of using sprayed mustard gas on the beaches".

50|$|Lead(II) {{chromate}} {{may also}} be known as chrome yellow, chromic acid lead(II) salt, canary chrome yellow 40-2250, chrome green, chrome green UC61, chrome green UC74, chrome green UC76, chrome lemon, crocoite, dianichi chrome yellow G, lemon yellow, king's yellow, Leipzig yellow, lemon yellow, <b>Paris</b> yellow, pigment <b>green</b> 15, plumbous chromate, pure lemon chrome L3GS, and various other names. The mineral crocoite, occurring as orange-yellow prismatic crystals, is a moderately rare mineral known from the oxidation zones of such Pb ore beds, that were affected by chromate-bearing solutions, coming from the oxidation of primary Cr minerals (chromite) of the nearby (ultra)mafic rocks.|$|R

In a paper she wrote, Catherine Dasté explains that Denyse Benoit was a hard working women and that she achieved her objectives with diligence and competence. After this internship she decided to continue working as a stage director for a while in Europe. In Belgium she took part in shows designed for children as an actress, host and stage director.|$|R
500|$|Ukiyo-e artists {{often made}} both prints and paintings; some {{specialized}} {{in one or}} the other. [...] In contrast with previous traditions, ukiyo-e painters favoured bright, sharp colours, and often delineated contours with sumi ink, an effect similar to the linework in prints. [...] Unrestricted by the technical limitations of printing, {{a wider range of}} techniques, pigments, and surfaces were available to the painter. [...] Artists painted with pigments made from mineral or organic substances, such as safflower, ground shells, lead, and cinnabar, and later synthetic dyes imported from the West such as <b>Paris</b> <b>green</b> and Prussian blue. [...] Silk or paper [...] kakemono hanging scrolls, makimono handscrolls, or byōbu folding screens were the most common surfaces.|$|E
500|$|The first {{pesticide}} {{used for}} indoor residual spraying was DDT. Although it was initially used exclusively to combat malaria, its use quickly spread to agriculture. In time, pest control, rather than disease control, came to dominate DDT use, and this large-scale agricultural use {{led to the}} evolution of resistant mosquitoes in many regions. The DDT resistance shown by Anopheles mosquitoes can be compared to antibiotic resistance shown by bacteria. [...] During the 1960s, awareness of the negative consequences of its indiscriminate use increased, ultimately leading to bans on agricultural applications of DDT in many countries in the 1970s. Before DDT, malaria was successfully eliminated or controlled in tropical areas like Brazil and Egypt by removing or poisoning the breeding grounds of the mosquitoes or the aquatic habitats of the larva stages, for example by applying the highly toxic arsenic compound <b>Paris</b> <b>Green</b> to places with standing water.|$|E
500|$|In 2002, Green had {{her film}} debut, when {{director}} Bernardo Bertolucci cast {{her for the}} role of Isabelle in The Dreamers (2003), which involved her in extensive full frontal nude scenes and graphic sex scenes. [...] Green told The Guardian that her agent and her parents begged her not to take the role, concerned that the film would cause her career to [...] "have the same destiny as Maria Schneider", because of Schneider's traumatic experience during the filming of Bertolucci's Last Tango in <b>Paris.</b> <b>Green</b> said that with Bertolucci's guidance she felt comfortable during the filming of the nude and sex scenes but was embarrassed when her family saw the film. Her performance was well-received, and some compared her to Liv Tyler. Green expressed surprise when a minute was cut from the film for the American market, stating, [...] "here is so much violence, both on the streets and on the screen. They think nothing of it. Yet I think they are frightened by sex." [...] Her next film was Arsène Lupin (2004), in which she portrayed Lupin's love interest. She enjoyed the light-hearted role, although she has stated that she generally prefers more complex characters.|$|E
