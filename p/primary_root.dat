25|$|Arabidopsis thaliana is {{an annual}} (rarely biennial) plant, usually growing to 20–25cm tall. The leaves form a rosette {{at the base}} of the plant, with a few leaves also on the {{flowering}} stem. The basal leaves are green to slightly purplish in color, 1.5–5cm long and 2–10mm broad, with an entire to coarsely serrated margin; the stem leaves are smaller and unstalked, usually with an entire margin. Leaves are covered with small, unicellular hairs (called trichomes). The flowers are 3mm in diameter, arranged in a corymb; their structure is that of the typical Brassicaceae. The fruit is a siliqua 5–20mm long, containing 20–30 seeds. Roots are simple in structure, with a single <b>primary</b> <b>root</b> that grows vertically downward, later producing smaller lateral roots. These roots form interactions with rhizosphere bacteria such as Bacillus megaterium.|$|E
25|$|Taíno {{groups in}} the more {{developed}} islands, such as Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, and Jamaica, relied more on agriculture (farming and other jobs). Fields for important root crops, such as the staple yuca, were prepared by heaping up mounds of soil, called conucos. This improved soil drainage and fertility as well as delaying erosion, allowing for longer storage of crops in the ground. Less important crops such as corn were raised in simple clearings created by slash and burn technique. Typically, conucos were three feet high and nine feet in circumference and were arranged in rows. The <b>primary</b> <b>root</b> crop was yuca/cassava, a woody shrub cultivated for its edible and starchy tuberous root. It was planted using a coa, a kind of hoe made completely from wood. Women processed the poisonous variety of cassava by squeezing it to extract the toxic juices. Then they would grind the roots into flour for baking bread. Batata (sweet potato) was the next most important root crop.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to determine if gibberellic acid (GA) and/or abscisic acid (ABA) are necessary for graviresponsiveness by <b>primary</b> <b>roots</b> of Zea mays. To accomplish this objective we measured the growth and graviresponsiveness of <b>primary</b> <b>roots</b> of seedlings in which the synthesis of ABA and GA was inhibited collectively and individually by genetic and chemical means. Roots of seedlings treated with Fluridone (an inhibitor of ABA biosynthesis) and Ancymidol (an inhibitor of GA biosynthesis) were characterized by slower growth rates but not significantly different gravicultures as compared to untreated controls. Gravicurvatures of <b>primary</b> <b>roots</b> of d- 5 mutants (having undetectable levels of GA) and vp- 9 mutants (having undectable levels of ABA) were not significantly different from those of wild-type seedlings. Roots of seedlings in which the biosynthesis of ABA and GA was collectively inhibited were characterized by gravicurvatures not significantly different for those of controls. These results (1) indicate that drastic reductions in the amount of ABA and GA in Z. mays seedlings do not significantly alter root graviresponsiveness, (2) suggest that neither ABA nor GA is necessary for root gravicurvature, and (3) indicate that root gravicurvature is not necessarily proportional to root elongation...|$|R
