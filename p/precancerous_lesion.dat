It takes an average of a year, but {{can take up to}} four years, for a person's immune system to control the initial infection. Screening during this period may show this immune reaction and repair as mild abnormalities, which are usually not associated with cervical cancer, but could cause the patient stress and result in further tests and possible treatment. Cervical cancer usually takes time to develop, so delaying the start of screening a few years poses little risk of missing a potentially <b>precancerous</b> <b>lesion.</b> For instance, screening people under age 25 does not decrease cancer rates under age 30.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Background. Pituitary tumor {{transforming}} gene (PTTG 1) is overexpressed in {{many types}} of human cancers and is involved in late-stage tumor progression. The role of PTTG 1 in initiating tumorigenesis is unclear. Methods. PTTG 1 expression was assessed in <b>precancerous</b> <b>lesions</b> and squamous cell carcinomas of the oral cavity (OSCC). The association between the protein expression and clinicopathologic parameters was analyzed. The expression level of PTTG 1 upon carcinogen treatment was also investigated. Results. PTTG 1 was overexpressed in both <b>precancerous</b> <b>lesions</b> and OSCC. The expression of PTTG 1 was associated with carcinogen exposure in vivo and in vitro. PTTG 1 over-expression was an independent factor for oral cancer develop-ment in <b>precancerous</b> <b>lesions.</b> Conclusions. This study provides the first evidence that PTTG 1 {{is involved in the}} early stages of oral tumorigenesis. Carcinogen exposure may cause the initial induction of PTTG 1 expression in oral <b>precancerous</b> <b>lesions.</b> PTTG 1 overexpres-sion is a potential prognosticator for malignant progression of oral <b>precancerous</b> <b>lesions.</b> VC 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|R
40|$|Topical 5 -aminolevulinic acid-mediated {{photodynamic}} therapy (ALA-PDT) is effective {{for treatment of}} human oral <b>precancerous</b> <b>lesions.</b> This animal study aimed to assess whether topical methotrexate (MTX) pretreatment could enhance the therapeutic effect of topical ALA-PDT on hamster buccal pouch <b>precancerous</b> <b>lesions.</b> Methods: Twenty hamster buccal pouch <b>precancerous</b> <b>lesions</b> were treated with either topical ALA-PDT with topical MTX pretreatment (topical MTX-ALA-PDT group, n =  10) or topical ALA-PDT alone (topical ALA-PDT group, n =  10). The intracellular protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) level in another 12 <b>precancerous</b> <b>lesions</b> (n =  6 for either the topical MTX-ALA or topical ALA group) was monitored by fluorescence spectroscopy. Results: The intracellular PpIX reached its peak level in <b>precancerous</b> <b>lesions</b> 6. 5 hours and 2. 5 hours after topical ALA application for the topical MTX-ALA group (5. 63 -fold higher in the lesion than in the normal mucosa) and topical ALA group (2. 42 -fold higher in the lesion than in the normal mucosa), respectively. The complete response rate of <b>precancerous</b> <b>lesions</b> was 80 % for the topical MTX-ALA-PDT group and 70 % for the topical ALA-PDT group. In addition, the topical MTX-ALA-PDT group required a significantly lower mean treatment number (2. 1  ±  0. 6) to achieve complete response than the topical ALA-PDT group (4. 4  ±  1. 3, p <  0. 001)). Moreover, the topical MTX-ALA-PDT group had a lower recurrence rate (12. 5 %) than the topical ALA-PDT group (28. 6 %). Conclusion: We conclude that topical MTX-pretreatment can increase intracellular PpIX production in hamster buccal pouch <b>precancerous</b> <b>lesions</b> and significantly improves the outcomes of the <b>precancerous</b> <b>lesions</b> treated with topical ALA-PDT...|$|R

40|$|Survivin is a {{recently}} described apoptosis inhibitor selectively over-expressed in most tumors.

40|$|Abstract: Oral cancers are {{malignancies}} {{that have}} high metastasis potential and thus survival {{rate of the}} patients is low. Today, epidemiological studies are being widely conducted on <b>precancerous</b> <b>lesions,</b> defined as predecessor lesions. In order to investigate the prevalence of oral <b>precancerous</b> <b>lesions</b> among Turkish people, 2000 consecutive outpatients who referred to our clinic for routine dental treatment, were examined. The proportion of lesions with potential to transform into cancer was 4. 0 %. It was concluded that leukoplakia and lichen planus were the most commonly observed <b>precancerous</b> <b>lesions.</b> All lesions had male propensity and the most affected site was the buccal mucosa.

40|$|Objective. To {{assess the}} {{prevalence}} and identified associated {{risk factors for}} <b>precancerous</b> cervical cancer <b>lesions</b> among HIV-infected women in resource-limited settings in Kenya. Methods. HIV-infected women attending the ART clinic at the Nazareth Hospital ART clinic between June 2009 and September 2010. Multivariate logistic regression model with odds ratios and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were estimated after controlling for important covariates. Result. A total of 715 women were screened for cervical cancer. The median age of the participants was 40 years (range 18 – 69 years). The prevalence of <b>precancerous</b> <b>lesions</b> (CINI, CINII, CIN III, ICC) was 191 (26. 7 %). After controlling for other variables in logistic regression analysis, cervical <b>precancerous</b> <b>lesions</b> were associated with not being on ART therapy; whereby non-ART were 2. 21 {{times more likely to}} have <b>precancerous</b> <b>lesions</b> than ART patients [(aOR) = 2. 21, 95 % CI (1. 28 – 3. 83) ].

40|$|A worldwide-accepted histologic, {{classification}} of the gastric carcinomatous and <b>precancerous</b> <b>lesions</b> {{is a prerequisite}} for a consistent recording of epidemiologic data and for both developing and evaluating primary and secondary preventive efforts. Different nomenclatures have been proposed for gastric <b>precancerous</b> <b>lesions</b> in eastern countries and in Japan. This article presents a {{classification of}} gastric <b>precancerous</b> <b>lesions</b> resulting from an international consensus conference involving pathologists of different countries. Five main diagnostic categories are identified. To allow comparisons with the nomenclature proposed by the Japanese Research Society for Gastric Cancer, each category was also assigned a numeric identification: 1 = normal, 2 = indefinite for dysplasia, 3 = noninvasive neoplasia, 4 = suspicious for invasive cancer, and 5 = cancer. The interobserver reproducibility of the histologic classification was tested in a series of 46 cases. By collapsing benign alterations (categories 1 + 2) versus noninvasive neoplasia (category 3) versus suspicious for invasive cancer and fully appearing carcinomatous lesions (categories 4 + 5), the general agreement value was 77. 7 %, whereas kappa coefficient was 0. 63. By examining gastric <b>precancerous</b> <b>lesions</b> from diverse populations, the authors agreed that the gastric precancerous process is universal and the differences in nomenclatures are merely semantics.
