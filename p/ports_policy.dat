Analysing the changing aspects of the sectoral socio-economic context and the alterations of the institutional setting, the paper explains the slow start towards a European <b>Port</b> <b>Policy</b> (EPP), that lasted more than three decades, and then assesses why, and how, policy actors involved in the EU policy making have succeeded in carving out elements of a policy framework. The study chronicles the stages by which the EU has moved into the <b>port</b> <b>policy</b> field. Grounding on the analysis of the changing sectoral environment, the paper analyses the complex sequence of events, which have led either to legislative and political decisions or to output failures. As demonstrated by the historical analysis (1957 - 2004), policy integration is a dynamic, seemingly irreversible, process, which marked by the searching for a balance between liberalisation and harmonisation. <b>Port</b> economics, <b>port</b> <b>policy,</b> European integration...|$|R

40|$|AbstractSince early 2000 s, China's major ports {{developed}} {{port facilities}} rapidly. Within {{a very short}} period, China succeeded to construct independent port system which does not rely on the nearby countries ports. To the contrary, neighboring countries' major ports with China confronted new challenge due to the Chinese progressive <b>ports</b> <b>policy.</b> Various measures are being introduced and practiced {{to cope with the}} challenge. However, the future prospect of the neighboring countries' major ports with China is not bright. In this paper, the anticipated prospect of the competition between Chinese ports and neighboring countries' major ports is to be suggested. For the appraisal criteria on the prospect toward Premier Port status, four elements, which are composed of geographical advantages, scale of container volumes, cost advantage, and national port policy, were selected, and used. As the result of the assessment, the port of Shanghai was evaluated as holding the highest probability toward Premier Port rather than any other East Asian major ports. Finally, it was recommended that the neighboring countries major ports with China which are confronted with the challenge from the Chinese ports, would be better to transform their strategies from current competition and quantity oriented policy to cooperation and value oriented policy...|$|E
40|$|The European Parliament, in its {{resolution}} on a European <b>ports</b> <b>policy</b> (2008 / 2007 INI), has stated “marinas {{are not only}} a showcase for their hinterland, and {{a powerful tool for}} promoting the exploitation of the port and its environs, but also an essential supply service for local businesses” (paragraph 46). Likewise, harmonious development of ports and their mutual cooperation benefit regional development provided that ports are both interconnected and connected to land and air transportation networks. Such connection and interconnection are necessary prerequisites to ensure that marinas are more than just self-contained landmarks and tourist attractions with purely local benefits. This brings up an issue of scale: to maximise their regional potential and contribution, marinas should to be regarded as nodes of networks that must be planned and managed at the regional level, the most appropriate for re-organising existing transport networks or localising new marinas. Effective regional planning and management requires precise and up-to-date information, not only concerning each marina’s intrinsic characteristics (e. g. ports type, dimensions, berth supply, facilities), but primarily defining their relative positioning and location within wider networks including distance from the nearest city or from other transport nodes, time travel to the closest airport, or types of services available within a given distance. The collection of such information, both spatial and non spatial, is challenging for planners, as it is not available readily in a single document. Rather, various sources are needed allowing the collation of ready-to-use data or building new layers of knowledge. Different sources are not always readily compatible, as they often represent a single object in different – sometimes conflicting - ways, which may cause improper integration. This paper, proposes the “domain ontology” concept as a possible means to reconcile this planning data, as a mechanism to map different kinds of meanings related to place connectivity, and hence solving the issue of generating effective information to help make marinas drivers of regional development, by looking at a specific case-study, the island of Sardinia (Italy) ...|$|E
40|$|MM - P&DMIn March 2002, the Department of Transport {{published}} the <b>Ports</b> <b>Policy</b> with {{the objectives of}} ensuring affordable, internationally competitive, efficient and safe port services and of restructuring port governance and operations and subsequently regulating them. The 2005 Ports Act officially separated operations from a landlord function within ports and further established the Ports Authority to own, manage, control and administer ports to ensure their efficient economic functioning. The Ports Act also established the Ports Regulator to exercise economic regulation of the ports system as well as monitor {{the activities of the}} Ports Authority. In addition, the Ports Regulations were developed, setting out the BEE targets that the Ports Authority should achieve in order to promote the economic participation and empowerment of historically disadvantaged groups in port operations. The Regulations further mandated the Ports Regulator to monitor and enforce implementation of the BEE targets when the Ports Authority would be issuing licences or granting concessions in port operations. This monitoring and enforcement function would be exercised through annual reports to be submitted by the Ports Authority, and through hearings that may be conducted by the Ports Regulator from time to time. This study found that the reasons for entrusting the Ports Regulator with the BEE monitoring and enforcement mandate, although not known to everybody, could have been orchestrated by Transnet because the Ports Regulator was seen to be less powerful than the Maritime BEE Charter Council. In addition, Transnet also developed guidelines for granting concessions, licences and permits for ‘auxiliary port services’ and not port operations. These would test the regulatory capability of the Ports Regulator hence it would require preventative enforcement measures in addition to harm-based enforcement measures that are in place (namely, annual reports and hearings). This study also established that having departmental officials on the Board of the Ports Regulator appeared to be in the latter’s best ii interests although it has to strengthen measures meant to curb the financial interests of board members and develop independent capacity for informationgathering, since implementing its mandate of monitoring and enforcing BEE will indeed be an intractable affair...|$|E
