40|$|Selective {{estrogen}} receptor modulators (SERMs), anti-estrogens and aromatase inhibitors {{are prohibited}} in human sports doping. However, they also present {{a risk of}} being used illegally in animal husbandry for fattening purposes. A method was developed and validated using UHPLC-MS/MS for the determination and confirmation of SERMs, anti-estrogens and aromatase inhibiters in bovine and porcine urine.

In 18 out of 103 porcine urine samples (17 %) and two out of 114 bovine samples (2 %) formestane, an aromatase inhibitor, was detected. None of the other compounds was detected. From human doping control it is known that formestane can, in some cases, be of natural origin. Analyses of reference samples from untreated bovine and <b>porcine</b> <b>animals</b> demonstrated the presence of formestane in bovine animals, but not yet in <b>porcine</b> <b>animals.</b> Future research will focus on whether the detected formestane in porcine and bovine urine is from endogenous or exogenous origin, using GC-c-IRMS...|$|E

40|$|A genetic {{variant of}} {{foot-and-mouth disease virus}} lacking the leader proteinase coding region (A 12 -LLV 2) is {{attenuated}} in both cattle and swine and, in contrast to wild-type virus (A 12 -IC), does not spread from the initial site of infection after aerosol exposure of bovines. We have identified secondary cells from susceptible animals, i. e., bovine, ovine, and <b>porcine</b> <b>animals,</b> in which infection with A 12 -LLV 2, in contrast to A 12 -IC infection, does not produce plaques; this result indicates that this virus cannot spread {{from the site of}} initial infection to neighboring cells. Nevertheless, A 12 -LLV 2 can infect these cells, but cytopathic effects and virus yields are significantly reduced compared to those seen with A 12 -IC infection. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis demonstrates that both A 12 -LLV 2 and A 12 -IC induce the production of alpha/beta interferon (IFN-α/β) mRNA in host cells. However, only supernatants from A 12 -LLV 2 -infected cells have significant antiviral activity. The antiviral activity in supernatants from A 12 -LLV 2 -infected embryonic bovine kidney cells is IFN-α/β specific, as assayed with mouse embryonic fibroblast cells with or without IFN-α/β receptors. The results obtained with cell cultures demonstrate that the ability of A 12 -IC to form plaques is associated with the suppression of IFN-α/β expression and suggest a role for this host factor in the inability of A 12 -LLV 2 to spread and cause disease in susceptible animals...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — High {{frequency}} transducers are desired for usage in catheter-based IVUS (intravascular ultrasound) imaging, {{which is}} the cross-sectional visualization of the interior of {{blood vessels in the}} human body. High frequency intravascular imaging benefits from the use of high sensitivity and broad bandwidths as they allow for high resolution imaging at increased depth of field. The 40 MHz piezo-composite micromachined ultrasound transducer (PC-MUT) technique developed by the authors in the past years demonstrated that the limitations of traditional dice-and-fill methodology for the fabrication of 1 - 3 composites could be overcome by the application of deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) of PMN-PT single crystals [1, 2, 3]. In this work, the fabrication and testing of higher frequency transducers and prototype catheters is presented. 1 - 3 PC-MUT composites were characterized and transducer devices with a target frequency of 60 MHz were prototyped and incorporated into functional catheters for imaging using a <b>porcine</b> <b>animal</b> model.

40|$|Tissue {{engineering}} {{has made}} considerable {{progress in the}} past decade, but advances have stopped short of clinical application for most tissues. We postulated that an obstacle in engineering human tissues is the limited replicative capacity of adult somatic cells. To test this hypothesis, the effectiveness of telomerase expression to extend cellular lifespan was assessed in a model of human vascular tissue engineering. Telomerase expression in vascular cells isolated from elderly patients enabled the successful culture of engineered autologous blood vessels. Engineered vessels may one day provide a source of bypass conduit for patients with atherosclerotic disease. Tissue-engineered autologous arteries have been grown and implanted successfully in <b>porcine</b> <b>animal</b> models. 1 For elderly patients {{who do not have}} a suitable conduit for revascularisation, tissue-engineered arteries could provide autologous grafts for bypass operations.

40|$|SummaryThe {{generation}} of tissue-specific cell types from {{human embryonic stem}} cells (hESCs) is critical {{for the development of}} future stem cell-based regenerative therapies. Here, we identify CD 13 and ROR 2 as cell-surface markers capable of selecting early cardiac mesoderm emerging during hESC differentiation. We demonstrate that the CD 13 +/ROR 2 + population encompasses pre-cardiac mesoderm, which efficiently differentiates to all major cardiovascular lineages. We determined the engraftment potential of CD 13 +/ROR 2 + in small (murine) and large (<b>porcine)</b> <b>animal</b> models, and demonstrated that CD 13 +/ROR 2 + progenitors have the capacity to differentiate toward cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, smooth muscle, and endothelial cells in vivo. Collectively, our data show that CD 13 and ROR 2 identify a cardiac lineage precursor pool that is capable of successful engraftment into the porcine heart. These markers represent valuable tools for further dissection of early human cardiac differentiation, and will enable a detailed assessment of human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiac lineage cells for potential clinical applications...|$|R

The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop a high-resolution, near-field-optimized 14 -MHz, 24 -element broad-bandwidth forward-looking array for {{integration}} on a steerable 9 F electrophysiology (EP) catheter. Methods. Several generations of prototype imaging catheters with bidirectional steering, termed microlinear (ML), were built and tested as integrated catheter designs with EP sensing electrodes near the tip. The wide-bandwidth ultrasound array was mount-ed on the very tip, equipped with an aperture of only 1. 2 by 1. 58 mm.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Performing a {{surgical}} procedure in weightlessness {{has been shown}} not to be any more difficult than in a 1 g environment if the requirements for the restraint of the patient, operator, and surgical hardware are observed. The feasibility of performing a laparoscopic surgical procedure in weightlessness, however, has been questionable. Concerns have included the impaired visualization {{from the lack of}} gravitational retraction of the bowel and from floating debris such as blood. METHODS: In this project, laparoscopic surgery was performed on a <b>porcine</b> <b>animal</b> model in the weightlessness of parabolic flight. RESULTS: Visualization was unaffected due to the tethering of the bowel by the elastic mesentery and the strong tendency for debris and blood to adhere to the abdominal wall due to surface tension forces. CONCLUSIONS: There are advantages to performing a laparoscopic instead of an open surgical procedure in a weightless environment. These will become important as the laparoscopic support hardware is miniaturized from its present form, as laparoscopic technology becomes more advanced, and as more surgically capable crew medical officers are present in future long-duration space-exploration missions...|$|R
40|$|Accurate {{knowledge}} of biomechanical characteristics of tissues {{is essential for}} developing realistic computer-based surgical simulators incorporating haptic feedback, {{as well as for}} the design of surgical robots and tools. As simulation technologies continue to be capable of modeling more complex behavior, an in vivo tissue property database is needed. Most past and current biomechanical research is focused on soft and hard anatomical structures that are subject to physiological loading, testing the organs in situ. Internal organs are different in that respect since they are not subject to extensive loads as part of their regular physiological function. However, during surgery, a different set of loading conditions are imposed on these organs as a result of the interaction with the surgical tools. Following previous research studying the kinematics and dynamics of tool/tissue interaction in real surgical procedures, the focus of the current study was to obtain the structural biomechanical properties (engineering stress-strain and stress relaxation) of seven abdominal organs, including bladder, gallbladder, large and small intestines, liver, spleen, and stomach, using a <b>porcine</b> <b>animal</b> model.

Here, we evaluate the feasibility, procedural safety and efficacy of the novel endovascular occlusion system (EOS) in the arterial system in a porcine model. Thirteen devices were deployed in the iliac and femoral arteries (diameter: 4 - 5 mm) of five adult swine. Post-deployment angiography was performed at 1, 5 and 10 min and 6 h. All devices (n = 13) could be successfully delivered without any complications, such as dissection, perforation or rupture. The devices could be easily advanced to the target vessel segment, deployed at the intended target location and produced immediate and complete vessel occlusion which was confirmed to be maintained after 6 h. No leaks, recanalization or device migration was observed. In this pilot study, we demonstrate the feasibility, safety and efficacy of immediate vessel occlusion with the EOS device in the peripheral arterial system in a <b>porcine</b> <b>animal</b> model. Our data indicate that this novel device allows precise delivery without the occurrence of cardiovascular complications.

40|$|Dermal {{wound healing}} is a {{biochemical}} and cellular process critical to life. While {{the majority of}} the population will only ever experience successful wound healing outcomes, some 1 - 3 % of those aged over 65 years will experience wound healing delay or perpetuation. These hard-to-heal wounds are comprised of degraded and dysfunctional extracellular matrix, yet the integrity of this structure is critical in the processes of normal wound healing. As such, extracellular matrix replacements have been devised that can replace dysfunctional extracellular matrix in hard-to-heal wounds with the aim of restoring normal wound healing processes. Here we evaluated a novel synthetic matrix protein for its ability to act as an acellular scaffold that can replace dysfunctional extracellular matrix. In this regard the synthetic protein demonstrated an ability to rapidly adsorb to the dermal surface, permit cell attachment and facilitate the cellular functions essential to wound healing. When applied to deep partial thickness wounds in a <b>porcine</b> <b>animal</b> model the matrix protein also demonstrated the ability to reduce wound duration. These data provide evidence that the synthetic matrix protein has the ability to function as an acellular scaffold for wound healing purposes...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this study is to explore the effect of lateral tension as a {{survival}} factor for retinal explants in vitro. The central nervous system (CNS) resides in a highly mechanical milieu. However, the importance of biomechanical homeostasis for normal CNS function has not been extensively explored. Diseases in which normal mechanical forces are disrupted, such as retinal detachment of the eye, are highly debilitating and the mechanisms underlying disease progression are not fully understood. METHODS: Using a <b>porcine</b> <b>animal</b> model, we developed a novel technique of culturing adult retinal explants under stretch for up to 10 days in vitro (DIV). These were compared to standard (no stretch) and free-floating cultured explants. Cell survival was analysed using immunohistochemistry, and retinal architecture using hematoxylin and eosin staining. RESULTS: Compared to unstretched specimens, which at 10 DIV degenerate into a gliotic cell mass, stretched retinas display a profound preservation of the laminar retinal architecture as well as significantly increased neuronal cell survival, with no signs of impending gliosis. CONCLUSIONS: The results confirm that biomechanical tension is a vital factor in the maintenance of retinal tissue integrity, and suggest that mechanical cues are important components of pathological responses within the CNS...|$|R
40|$|Surgical {{intervention}} is sometimes {{needed to create}} a conduit from the abdominal wall to the bladder for self-catheterization. We developed a method for tissue engineering a conduit for bladder emptying without in vitro cell culturing as a one-step procedure. In a <b>porcine</b> <b>animal</b> model bladder, wall tissue was excised and the mucosa was minced to small particles. The particles were attached to a tube in a 1 [*]:[*] 3 expansion rate with fibrin glue and transplanted back by attaching the tube to the bladder and through the abdominal wall. Sham served as controls. After 4 - 5 weeks, conduits were assessed in respect to macroscopic and microscopic appearance in 6 pigs. Two pigs underwent radiology before termination. Gross examination revealed a patent conduit with an opening to the bladder. Histology and immunostaining showed a multilayered transitional uroepithelium in all cases. Up to 89 % of the luminal surface area was neoepithelialized but with a loose attachment to the submucosa. No epithelium was found in control animals.

Methods: Fifteen minipigs received 30 carbon-coated self-expandable nitinol stents in iliac arteries. Explants were carried out at 7 (3 animals), 30 (4 animals), 90 (4 animals) and 180 (4 animals) day FU, for evaluation of acute, sub-acute and chronic biological response to the implanted devices. Histological, immunohistochemical, histomorphometric and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses were performed to assess inflammatory reaction, endothelialization process, neointimal growth and cellular composition. Results: Thirty stents were successfully implanted. No mural thrombi were observed at gross examination or by angiography. Histologically no significant inflammatory reaction was detected: the stents appeared covered by a thin monolayer of endothelial cells even at 7 day FU. The neointima presented homogeneous growth and moderate thickness after 30, 90 and 180 days explants (0. 38 +/- 0. 36 mm, 0. 33 +/- 0. 30 mm, 0. 27 +/- 0. 25 mm respectively). Internal and external elastic laminae were intact in 95 % of stented arteries. Histological data validations of vessel endothelialization was obtained with SEM for the seven day follow-up group.

Materials and methods: We conducted this investigation using a <b>porcine</b> <b>animal</b> model. Bilateral oophorectomy was performed in eight sows. The ovarian tissues were divided into two parts; one part was immediately fixed while the other was cryopreserved. The cryopreserved specimens were subsequently thawed and then fixed. All the specimens were sectioned, fixed and stained with H&E. The ovarian follicles were counted, histologically categorized as healthy and atretic and evaluated for the presence of apoptosis. Then, in situ examination of apoptosis was performed using TUNEL assay. Results: In the cryopreserved tissues: 1) the count of the primordial follicle was significantly reduced as compared to freshly- fixed samples (4. 9 ± 5. 3 vs. 7. 2 ± 5. 4, p= 0. 03 respectively) and 2) the mean values of apoptosis were insignificantly higher when compared to the freshly-fixed group (p= 0. 74). Moreover: 1) apoptosis was found in the atretic, but not in the healthy follicles (primordial, primary and secondary); 2) the nuclei of the granulosa cells, but not those of theca or stromal cells, were TUNEL positive; 3) some cells with histological features of necrosis and apoptosis were TUNEL negative, and 6) The distribution of apoptosis was not different between cryopreserve...|$|R

40|$|Objectives. The transvascular {{closure of}} patent foramen ovale (PFO) with self-expanding devices carries {{the risk of}} left atrial {{thrombus}} formation related to material protruding into the left atrium. Thus, we developed a novel device with flat left atrial disc geometry. We evaluated feasibility, handling, and biocompatibility in a <b>porcine</b> <b>animal</b> model. Methods. Implantation of an Occlutech Figulla PFO device was performed in 10 mini pigs using fluoroscopy and intra-cardiac ultrasound after transseptal puncture of the interatrial septum. Angiographic follow-up was performed after six and twelve weeks. Results. Implantation was successful in 100 %. There were no further implant related complications. One procedure related death occurred, as one animal died of ventricular tachycardia due to mispunture of the interatrial septum. Angiographic studies showed no residual shunt during follow-up. Histopathological evaluation could demonstrate partial neoendothelialization after 6 weeks with completion after 12 weeks. The devices were incorporated into connective tissue containing fibro muscular cells. An only mild inflammatory reaction was detected locally related to the polyester fibers. Conclusion. In terms of feasibility and handling, the new device {{does not seem to}} be inferior to other presently used implantation systems.

40|$|AIMS The aim of {{the study}} was to report {{preclinical}} safety and feasibility of a new transcatheter direct mitral annuloplasty intervention in an acute animal model. METHODS AND RESULTS Twenty healthy pigs underwent Cardioband (Valtech Cardio, Or Yehuda, Israel) transcatheter implantation under intracardiac echocardiographic and fluoroscopic guidance. Through a neo inferior vena cava approach, transseptal access was arranged. The device was delivered into the left atrium using a multi-steerable catheter and fixed to the mitral annulus with multiple helix anchors. Following device cinching, reduction of annular size was evaluated. In all animals the device could be successfully implanted and displayed 100 % function, with the average procedure duration and fluoroscopy times being 78 ± 23 minutes and 27 ± 9 minutes, respectively. In total, 246 anchors (average 12. 3 per device) were delivered and optimal anchor placement was achieved in 95. 1 %, while inadequate anchor position (4 %) and injury of the coronary sinus or atrium (0. 8 %) occurred in the rest. Following maximal cinching, diastolic transmitral flow velocity and coaptation lengths were markedly increased (p< 0. 001), whereas septolateral and intercommissural distances were significantly decreased (p< 0. 001), when compared to pre-contraction baseline, demonstrating efficient annular reduction by the device.

40|$|The {{immunosuppressive}} therapy still {{remains the only}} therapeutic strategy to control excessive immune activation following renal transplantation, but remain the problems related to excessive immunosuppression {{and in particular the}} toxicity due to high doses of immunosuppressive drugs such as calcineurin inhibitors. The present study has the aim of documenting, in a <b>porcine</b> <b>animal</b> model, the histological damage from calcineurin inhibitors using incremental doses of Tacrolimus, achieved in a limited amount of time, until it reaches toxic blood concentrations. We perform the study under different condition, like oral administration, intravenous infusion and with or without kidney transplant. It is noted that the damage is early, predominantly vascular and that affects different organs in addition to the kidneys. We also observe that the functional damage underestimates the structural damage. The search for non-invasive methods for the identification of biomarkers of nephrotoxicity and rejection, and to better characterize the inflammation status, led us to conduct analysis of the exosomal content, allowing us to observe the presence of serum cytokines which, although in low amounts, suggest a possible role of these in the inflammatory process mediated by exosomal vesicles.

40|$|The menisci of the {{mammalian}} {{knee joint}} balance the incongruence between femoral condyle and tibial plateau and thus menisci absorb and distribute high loads. Degeneration {{processes of the}} menisci lead to pain syndromes in the knee joint. The origin of such degenerative processes on meniscal tissue is rarely understood and may be described best as an imbalance of anabolic and catabolic metabolism. A standardized animal model of meniscal degeneration is needed for further studies. The aim {{of the current study}} was to develop a <b>porcine</b> <b>animal</b> model with early meniscal degeneration. Resection of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACLR) was performed on the left knee joints of eight Göttingen minipigs. A sham operation was carried out on the right knee joint. The grade of degeneration was determined 26 weeks after the operation using histology and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Furthermore, the expression of 14 genes which code for extracellular matrix proteins, catabolic matrix metalloproteinases and inflammation mediators were analyzed. Degenerative changes were detected by a histological analysis of the medial meniscus after ACLR. These changes were not detected by MRI. In terms of their gene expression profile, these degenerated medial menisci showed a significantly increased expression of COL 1 A 1.

40|$|Summary: Throughout {{much of the}} world, Trichinella spp. {{are found}} to be the causative agents of human trichinellosis, a disease that not only is a public health hazard by {{affecting}} human patients but also represents an economic problem in <b>porcine</b> <b>animal</b> production and food safety. Due to the predominantly zoonotic importance of infection, the main efforts in many countries have focused on the control of Trichinella or the elimination of Trichinella from the food chain. The most important source of human infection worldwide is the domestic pig, but, e. g., in Europe, meats of horses and wild boars have played a significant role during outbreaks within the past 3 decades. Infection of humans occurs with the ingestion of Trichinella larvae that are encysted in muscle tissue of domestic or wild animal meat. Early clinical diagnosis of trichinellosis is rather difficult because pathognomonic signs or symptoms are lacking. Subsequent chronic forms of the disease are not easy to diagnose, irrespective of parameters including clinical findings, laboratory findings (nonspecific laboratory parameters such as eosinophilia, muscle enzymes, and serology), and epidemiological investigations. New regulations laying down rules for official controls for Trichinella in meat in order to improve food safety for consumers have recently been released in Europe. The evidence that the disease can be monitored and to some extent controlled with a rigorous reporting and testing system in place should be motivation to expand appropriate programs worldwide...|$|R

40|$|Malabsorptive {{bariatric surgery}} is an {{effective}} treatment option for morbid obesity, but {{may be associated with}} complications and side effects. We have developed a new experimental approach to creating a gastric bypass through an intraluminal access. The goal is to reduce postoperative complications and to reduce mid-term side-effects of malabsorptive bypass food passage and to allow easy reversion of the procedure. The new procedure is based on an implantable gastric bypass device, installed by combined transoral flexible and minimally invasive abdominal access. The newly developed device and procedure were studied in a pilot experimental trial in the <b>porcine</b> <b>animal</b> model (n= 8). Endpoints were the feasibility of the technical procedure, the ability of the animal to eat and digest food, the implant functionality over the survival period and the absence of major complications over a short-term follow-up (one week). The procedure was technically successful in all eight animals. Animals were able to take in food and water till sacrifice. Four animals had major complications (one abdominal wall dehiscence, one invagination ileus of the small bowel, one dehiscence of the gastro-jejunal anastomosis and one myocardial infarction) and did not complete follow-up. In two cases migration of the device into the stomach was observed. The difference between our experimental technique and the gold standard surgical methods for gastric bypass consists of the endoluminal approach by implanting an intraluminal gastric bypass device. This concept avoids gastric transsection and an additional anastomosis and enables an adjustable food passage between the bypass and the natural duodenal passage. Further long-term follow-up studies are required...|$|R
40|$|In {{patients}} with severe illness, such as aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), a physiologic stress response is triggered. This includes {{activation of the}} hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the sympathetic nervous system. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the very early responses of these systems. A <b>porcine</b> <b>animal</b> model of aneurysmal SAH was used. In this model, blood is injected slowly to the basal cisterns above the anterior skull base until the cerebral perfusion pressure is 0 mm Hg. Sampling was done from blood and urine at - 10, + 15, + 75 and + 135 minutes from time of induction of SAH. Analyses of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, aldosterone, catecholamines and chromogranin-A were performed. Plasma ACTH, serum cortisol and plasma aldosterone increased in the samples following induction of SAH, and started to decline after 75 minutes. Urine cortisol also increased after SAH. Urine catecholamines and their metabolites were found to increase after SAH. Many samples were however below detection level, not allowing for statistical analysis. Plasma chromogranin-A peaked at 15 minutes after SAH, and thereafter decreased. The endocrine stress response after aneurysmal SAH was found to start within 15 minutes in the HPA axis with early peak values of ACTH, cortisol and aldosterone. The fact that the concentrations of the HPA axis hormones decreased 135 minutes after SAH may suggest that a similar pattern exists in SAH patients, thus making it difficult to catch these early peak values. There were also indications of early activation of the sympathetic nervous system, but the small number of valid samples made interpretation difficult...|$|R
40|$|Trauma, {{congenital}} defects, and tumor resections {{can result}} in discontinuity bone defects, which are typically treated through bone grafting. Potential limitations, such as donor site morbidity, make the development of synthetic implants with similar success to current techniques an attractive alternative for the repair of these structural defecits. Due to its chemical similarity, porous hydroxyapatite (HA) remains a candidate biomaterial for synthetic bone grafting. This thesis investigates a potential method to improve osteointegration of these hydroxyapatite bone scaffolds, the delivery of recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein- 2 (rhBMP- 2). The objective {{of this study is}} to evaluate the effect of rhBMP- 2 addition on scaffold osteointegration and degradation in a <b>porcine</b> <b>animal</b> model. Scaffolds were prepared and inserted into surgically induced defects in the mandibles of Yorkshire pigs in order to compare the addition of rhBMP- 2 -containg hydroxyapatite scaffolds to empty hydroxyapatite control scaffolds and hydroxyapatite scaffolds with empty gelatin microspheres at 6, 12, 24, and 48 weeks after insertion. Macroscale analysis of bone infiltration and scaffold degradation using micro-computed tomography indicated limited differences in bone and scaffold amounts between treatments. However, on the microscale, significant increases in bone infiltration into scaffold micropores with the rhBMP- 2 treatment were observed through histological and scanning electron microscope analysis. In addition, significant degradation of the scaffold due to the physiological environment could be observed. We conclude that addition of rhBMP- 2 into a porous hydroxyapatite scaffold may be advantageous to bone ingrowth due to improved osteointegration on the microscale...|$|R
30|$|These are {{specifically}} recommended {{for treatment of}} obese children with Blount’s disease. A number of experimental animal studies have been published {{on the use of}} the tension band plating technique. In one animal study, rabbit hind limbs were allocated to either lateral stapling, lateral tension band plating, sham surgery or no surgery. Staple migration was observed after 2  weeks of treatment. No results from the histological analysis were reported apart from the growth plate appearing disturbed between the staple legs. Interestingly, staple hemiepiphysiodesis produced a larger valgus deformity when compared to the tension band plating technique. A similar result was observed in another study on rabbits but better grasp in bone was reported for the implants used for tension band plating. In their histological analysis, cellular disorganisation was reported around implants in 9 preparations from a total of 34 femurs. No differences were found between implant types and implant related injuries to the growth plate were not observed. Two <b>porcine</b> <b>animal</b> studies compared stapling with tension band plating in paired setups similar to the study presented were also reported [19, 20]. Medial hemiepiphysiodesis induced a varus deformity using both techniques but the angulation created was larger using the tension band plating technique. Signs of early loosening of staples as well as failure of implanted staples were reported. No histological analysis was included in these studies. A recent study investigated the effect of screw length on the rate of creation of the deformity but found no difference between short and long screws. However, guided growth using the tension band plating technique was found to be more efficient overall than staples [21].|$|R
