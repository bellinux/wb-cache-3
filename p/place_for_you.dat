2500|$|Medwin {{rebelled against}} his father's wish that he become a lawyer, causing a quarrel, {{the result of}} which was Thomas' {{omission}} from his father's will, executed in 1829. There {{was a period of}} drift in Medwin's life, in which he attempted to live beyond his means as a gentleman. Considerable debts appear to have been paid by his family. These activities involved much carousing and gambling at his club in Brighton and generally spending money on collecting art. Shelley recalled Medwin as painting well and [...] "remarkable, if I do not mistake, for a particular taste in, and knowledge of the belli arti – Italy is the <b>place</b> <b>for</b> <b>you,</b> the very place – the Paradise of Exiles... If you will be glad to see an old friend, who will be glad to see you... come to Italy." [...] Medwin's financial situation could not continue as it was, and by 1812 he had accepted a military commission in the 24th Light Dragoons, a regiment where he could pursue his social pretensions.|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} day a pro-Syrian demonstration {{set a new}} record when Hezbollah amassed 400–500 thousand protestors at Riad Solh square in Beirut, most of them bussed in from the heavily Shi'ite south Lebanon and eastern Beka'a valley. [...] The show of power demonstrated Hezbollah's influence, wealth and organization as the sole Lebanese party allowed to hold a militia by Syria. [...] In his speech Nasrallah blasted UN Security-Council Resolution 1559, which calls for Hezbollah's militia to be disbanded, as foreign intervention. [...] Nasrallah also reiterated his earlier calls {{for the destruction of}} Israel saying [...] "To this enemy we say again: There is no <b>place</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> here and there is no life for you among us. Death to Israel!". [...] Though Hezbollah organized a very successful rally, opposition leaders were {{quick to point out that}} Hezbollah had active support from Lebanon's government and Syria. [...] While the pro-democracy rallies had to deal with road blocks forcing protestors to either turn back or march long distances to Martyr's Square, Hezbollah was able to bus people directly to Riad Solh square. [...] Dory Chamoun, an opposition leader, pointed out that [...] "the difference is that in our demonstrations, people arrive voluntarily and on foot, not in buses". [...] Another opposition member said the pro-Syrian government pressured people to turn out and some reports said Syria had bused in people from across the border. But on a mountain road leading to Beirut, only one bus with a Syrian license plate was spotted in a convoy of pro-Syrian supporters heading to the capital and Hezbollah officials denied the charges.|$|E
