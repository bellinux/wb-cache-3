5|$|The {{film was}} adapted {{for the stage}} in 2004 as a musical, Dirty Dancing: The Classic Story on Stage. Produced by Jacobsen Entertainment in Australia for $6.5million, {{it was written by}} Eleanor Bergstein and had the same songs as the film, plus a few extra scenes. Musical {{direction}} was by Chong Lim (one of the composers for the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney), and the initial production starred Kym Valentine as Baby and Sydney Dance Company's Josef Brown as Johnny. Although reviews were mixed, the production was a commercial success, selling over 200,000 tickets during its six-month run. It has also had sellout runs in Germany and in London's West End, where it opened at the Aldwych Theatre on October 23, 2006 with the highest pre-sell in London history, earning £6million ($US12million). , over 1 million <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> the musical in London, selling out 6 months in advance. The original West End production closed in July 2011 after a five-year run, prior to a two-year national tour. The show returned to the West End at the Piccadilly Theatre and ran from July 13, 2013 to February 22, 2014 before resuming its tour of the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland.|$|E

25|$|Ralph's Wife's Lane is {{the main}} road {{connecting}} Banks with Crossens to the south.

500|$|Watership Downs {{universal}} motifs {{of liberation}} and self-determination {{have led to}} the tendency of minority groups to read their own narrative into the novel, despite the author's assurance (in 2005) that it [...] "was never intended to become some sort of allegory or parable." [...] Rachel Kadish, reflecting on her own superimposition of the founding of Israel onto Watership Down, has remarked [...] "Turns out plenty of other <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> their histories in that book...some people see it as an allegory for struggles against the Cold War, fascism, extremism...a protest against materialism, against the corporate state. [...] Watership Down can be Ireland after the famine, Rwanda after the massacres." [...] Kadish has praised both the fantasy genre and Watership Down for its [...] "motifs [...] hit home in every culture...all passersby are welcome to bring their own subplots and plug into the archetype." ...|$|E

500|$|Filming for the {{television}} pilot began {{on location in}} Los Angeles in February 1999 and took six weeks. Ultimately, the network was unhappy with the pilot and decided not to place it on its schedule. Objections included the nonlinear storyline, the ages of Harring and Watts (whom they considered too old), cigarette smoking by Ann Miller's character and a close-frame shot of dog feces in one scene. Lynch remembered, [...] "All I know is, I loved making it, ABC hated it, and I don't like the cut I turned in. I agreed with ABC that the longer cut was too slow, but I was forced to butcher it {{because we had a}} deadline, and there wasn't time to finesse anything. It lost texture, big scenes and storylines, and there are 300 tape copies of the bad version circulating around. Lots of <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> it, which is embarrassing, because they're bad-quality tapes, too. I don't want to think about it." ...|$|E
500|$|... {{was adapted}} {{for the stage}} by playwright Hugo Carrillo, and first {{performed}} in a production of the Compañía de Arte Dramático de la Universidad Popular directed by Rubén Morales at the twelfth Festival of Guatemalan Theatre in 1974. [...] It was a great popular success, with over 200 performances during its ten-month run, much longer than the two months of weekend performances that were standard for the festival, and the run broke Central American box office records. [...] The production later toured Central America and other groups have also performed it, so that over 50,000 <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> the play in over eight other countries besides Guatemala. [...] Carrillo was notably concerned about the staging of the play by others; he grew angry at a Salvadoran production that changed a few scenes, and casting differences with Joseph Papp led to the cancellation of the play at the 1987 New York Latin American Festival (this canceled production was {{the origin of the}} English translation of the play, written by Margarita Kénefic, a student of Carrillo).|$|E
500|$|Before the album's release, in December 2012, Cudi {{dedicated}} Indicud to {{the late}} Ben Breedlove and all his fans who died, continuing: [...] "My journey shall continue in your honor. Never forgotten." [...] The dedication was ultimately included in the album's liner notes. The album is upbeat and optimistic, very much unlike his previous studio album [...] (2010), which was considered darkly erratic. The positive vibe stems from Cudi's desire to always change and reinvent: [...] "I always try to push myself {{to the next level}} with everything I do. Since I've been in the business, critics have known that about me. When I started working on Indicud, I just wanted to bring more energy into my sound. Most of my old music was driven towards relaxed, chilled out smoke music. And that was my goal first coming in. Now it's like, 'What’s a side of me that people haven’t seen?' The only time <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> me on up-tempos is on remixes or some shit. So I just wanted to take the energy to the next level. That ultimately inspired the subject matter. It was a chain reaction. With the up-tempos came more positive lyrics. It just brightened up the whole shit." ...|$|E

2500|$|The film premiered in {{competition}} at the 2006 Berlin Film Festival, where Panahi was awarded with the Silver Bear Jury Grand Prix. Like The Circle and Crimson Gold before it, Offside was banned from being shown in Iran. Panahi had already set up distribution for the film all over Iran and the film was predicted to break all box office records. Two days after being banned and twenty days before the World Cup championship game, unlicensed DVD copies of the film became available all over Iran. Panahi has stated that of his films Offside is [...] "probably the one that <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> the most" [...] in Iran. After the film's release a feminist protest group in Iran called the White Scarf Girls began showing up at football matches carrying banners that read: [...] "We don't want to be Offside" [...] Sony Pictures Classics, the film's U.S. distributor, {{wrote a letter to}} the Ministry of Guidance in Iran requesting that the film be shown for at least one week in its home country so that they could launch a campaign to nominate the film for Best Foreign Language Film, but the Ministry refused.|$|E
2500|$|Jackson had {{considered}} postponing music for other career plans, but ultimately decided {{to record a}} new album. Jackson attempted several new musical styles; lyrically exploring her sexuality more explicitly and freely. A central theme of split personalities is incorporated within the content of several songs. Jackson stated [...] "It shows the different sides of me, the different characters that I feel that I display at different moments in my life" [...] "I am divulging myself a little more on this album, and it's definitely much more intimate. That's another side of myself that <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen,</b> but not to this level." [...] Comparing the process of producing to directing, Jackson searched for [...] "sensitive people who can technically express what I'm going through emotionally" [...] while seeking new collaborators. Jimmy Jam added; [...] "Her albums are always what she's thinking at the moment." [...] "Her thoughts may change six months from now. Her biggest thing is {{to be honest with}} her fans. Whatever stuff she wants to talk about, it's coming from her heart." [...] Dallas Austin said [...] "she always shows what's going on with her life through her records, reveals the phase she's in with her life and brings out that experience." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{rebellion}} in Ireland broke {{out at the}} end of May, with a friend in Ireland writing to Fitzwilliam that his Irish estate was [...] "the seat of war and {{rebellion in}} this part of the county". Fitzwilliam believed the origin of the rebellion was to be found in the spread of Jacobinism after his recall as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland and that the solution was [...] "a fundamental change of system" [...] there. Fitzwilliam voted with the Foxites in the debates on the issue and completed his progress back to joining them. The next year he also opposed the Union between Britain and Ireland and that [...] "the measure cannot be carried but by the length of the sword. It cannot be an Union of consent on the part of Ireland. On 19 March 1799 he led the opposition in the Lords and said Emancipation should be enacted without Union because: [...] "Did anyone at this time of day believe that the family of the Stuarts would be supported by the Catholics?" [...] In 1800 he spoke again, declaring that he would support a Union but only if it would really unite the two kingdoms together, and that the penal laws were [...] "framed against a particular description of persons which now ceased to exist: they were directed against superstition, bigotry and disloyalty; and therefore should not affect the liberal, the well-meaning, and the loyal Catholics of the present day". Fox wrote to a friend on 6 December 1799 that Fitzwilliam and Lord Holland were the only [...] "two who have from me every degree of good will and affection". However, in February 1800 Fitzwilliam openly disagreed with Fox's desire for peace with France because the national interest called for a prosecution of the war at least until the enemy accepted the status quo ante bellum, although he criticised the government for conduct of it. Writing to Laurence on 2 August and 26 October Fitzwilliam changed his position on the war in the light of Austria (Britain's remaining ally) making peace with France: [...] "I am ready to confess that I do not see how war without Continental alliances can tend to produce a counter-revolutionary system in France". France under the rule of Napoleon was in Fitzwilliam's view was less revolutionary: [...] "He may continue the use of revolutionary jargon, but he will check all revolutionary practices. He may gratify his lust of glory by subjugating kingdoms and nations, but he will subvert the roders of things in them no more than is necessary for his first purpose. ... <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> that, after all, revolutions are but a lottery for power, the people...are left worse than they were found, having been fleeced of everything valuable. From the result of the consideration, then, I am inclined to think peace desirable".|$|E
