In this study, a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was developed allowing the detection of Mmd, the forma specialis that is economically harmful. A set of primers and hydrolysis probe were designed based on sequence polymorphisms in the large ribosomal RNA subunit (28 S). The real-time PCR assay was optimized and performance criteria of the detection method, i. e. sensitivity, specificity, repeatability, reproducibility, and robustness, were assessed. The real-time PCR method was highly specific and sensitive and allowed the detection of one single urediniospore of Mmd in a mixture of 2 mg of urediniospores of other Melampsora species.

The {{factors associated}} with the distribution of parasitic weed Orobanche cumana Wallr. (Broomrape), limiting sunflower production in Europe and the surrounding continents of Asia and Africa, have not been adequately investigated. The goals {{of this study were}} to broaden the understanding of environmental {{factors associated with}} broomrape’ distribution in Europe, and to predict suitable habitats based on environmental factors which would be vulnerable to invasion and establishment of broomrape in North and South America. A robust agroecological database included 35 quantitative parameters associated with trials conducted by ten public research organizations from five continents. The database consisted of 117 sites (habitats), Europe (79), Africa (3), Asia (6), and Americas (29), equally distributed between invaded and non- invaded habitats. Environmental parameters analyzed using an ANOVA and PCA showed that all sunflower areas from Europe were vulnerable to broomrape attack. The parasitic weed develops in soil and climate environmental conditions similar to non-invaded areas. Its expansion to nearby areas of the Africa and Asia continents seems to indicate a broadening of the environmental conditions to which the parasitic weed can tolerate. Habitat conditions of sunflower crop areas in South America showed more similarity to invaded habitats than North America. The absence of the ability to predict actual broomrape distribution based on environmental factors enforces the need to use cultural practices of crop rotation and genetic resistance in infected areas.

Cacao black pod, particularly, is an economically serious problem {{in all areas of}} the world where cacao is grown, causing significant pod losses of up to 30 % and killing up to 10 % of the trees annually. The disease is caused by different species of the stramenopile genus Phytophthora and, once it has infected a cacao field, its control is fairly difficult. Black pod rot control strategies. Several approaches are used to manage black pod: chemical <b>control,</b> <b>phytosanitary</b> and cultural methods, genetic resistance, and biological control. Losses in yield due to black pod could be reduced through integrated management practices, although the results may vary for each cacao-growing region. Main challenges and new approaches.

This finding was provided by molecular data written in the evolutionary variable, non-coding internal transcribed spacers (ITS 1 and ITS 2) of the ribosomal DNA (rDNA). In the current paper, we analyze the nucleotide sequences and predict the secondary structures of two expansion segments (D 2, D 3) of the 28 S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) -coding gene for the plant-parasitic nematodes from the genus Ditylenchus and their related anguinids. In general, the expansion segment D 2 appeared to be more variable than the segment D 3 illustrating their different evolutionary constraints. Comparative analysis of the aligned sequences and predicted secondary structures revealed similar trend showing the tight relationships between the stem nematodes (D. dipsaci, D. gigas, D. weischeri) and gall-forming nematodes from the subfamily Anguininae. Phylogeny reconstructions disjoined the family Anguinidae into two monophyletic clusters (Clade 1 and 2).

The main dissemination pathways within Europe include: (1) natural adult dissemination; (2) adult hitchhiker behaviour; and, to a lesser extent, (3) transportation of larvae in fresh fruits. R. completa host plants are widely distributed in Europe, either as isolated wild trees or in orchards, favouring the probability of fly establishment in currently fly-free areas. In addition, the European territories where Juglans species are present share biogeographic similarities. In orchards where R. completa is present and uncontrolled, 100 % of walnut trees can be infested, causing losses in walnut yields of up to 80 %. The negative effect is low (< 10 % yield loss) under <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>control,</b> although additional costs {{must also be considered}} to support specific monitoring for R. completa. The information presented here underlines a strong need for better walnut husk fly monitoring across European countries, as well as for increasing efforts to develop biological methods to control this emerging pest.

40|$|Our aim was {{to examine}} the {{virulence}} of eight Phytophthora isolates belonging to three species (Phytophthora cryptogea, Phytophthora plurivora and Phytophthora quercina) obtained from diverse European ecosystems (in Bulgaria, Poland and Germany) towards three forest tree hosts – English oak (Quercus robur L.), Turkey oak (Quercus cerris L.) and European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.). All plants grown from seeds in a greenhouse conditions were artificially inoculated under the stem bark with Phytophthora cultures. The tested isolates turned to be more aggressive to Turkey oaks than to English oak trees. In case of European beech, the isolates of P. cryptogea and P. plurivora exposed various virulence. The potential hazard of the introduced foreign isolates for the oak and beech forests in Poland and Bulgaria is discussed. Amongst the tested isolates, P. quercina P 290 from German highly infected Bulgarian Turkey oaks; therefore, its negative potential impact on Bulgarian oak forests could be considered as high (if unintentionally introduced). Also, two Bulgarian isolates belonging to P. cryptogea and P. plurivora are risky for Polish beech forests, if exposed to the pathogen. The observed pathogenicity of the tested Phytophthora species proved their potential as important contributors to decline of valuable forest ecosystems dominated by oaks (Q. robur and Q. cerris) or beech (F. sylvatica), in both Poland and Bulgaria. We found that investigated Phytophthora pathogens could develop in the living plant stem tissues without causing any disease symptoms, which is another demonstration that <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>control</b> by simple observation of plant material is not effective.

O estudo foi realizado em pomar localizado no município de Faxinal-PR, e as amostragens de ramos frutíferos foram iniciadas três semanas após o início da brotação, repetidas a cada três semanas, durante 45 semanas. Foram realizadas análises químicas dos materiais coletados e determinada a extração de nutrientes ao longo do estádio de desenvolvimento. O total de macronutrientes exportados pela colheita dos frutos foram: 25, 47; 5. 72; 51. 53; 6. 76; 2. 79 e 5, 09, respectivamente, para N, P, K, Ca, Mg e S em kg por ha, para produtividade de 27. 7 toneladas por ha de fruto, e os exportados pela retirada de ramos podados para fora do pomar, por questões fitossanitárias, foram: 2, 1; 0, 3; 1, 1; 5, 8; 0, 5 e 0, 4 kg de N, P, K, Ca, Mg e S em kg por ha. There is {{no information}} supporting fertilization for persimmon crop {{as far as}} the Brazilian literature is concerned. Therefore, the goal of this paper was to study the accumulation of dry mass and micronutrient in organs that compounds the productive branch, during phenological growth stages of persimmon cv. Giombo, and to quantify the nutrient requirement for production. The study was carried out in an orchard located in Faxinal-PR. The spacing between plants was 6 x 7 meters. The sampling of fruiting branches started three weeks after budding had begun and this procedure was repeated after every three weeks during 45 weeks. Chemical analyses of the samples were performed and nutrients extractions during phenological growth stages were determinate. The total of macronutrients removed by fruit harvest was 25. 47; 5. 72; 51. 53; 6. 76; 2. 79 and 5. 09 kg per hectare, respectively for N, P, K, Ca, Mg and S.

O controle fitossanitário e tratos culturais devem ser realizados de modo a não comprometerem a qualidade do produto final, as amêndoas. Foram avaliadas nozes produzidas na safra de 2005 e oriundas de Uraí-PR, pelas cultivares Burkett, Frotscher e Moneymaker, para identificar e quantificar os microrganismos associados à amêndoas e cascas dos frutos, bem como observar diferenças entre organismos colonizadores das cultivares. Os frutos foram avaliados na pós-colheita, aos trinta dias de armazenamento em ambiente, através da metodologia do papel de filtro, sendo submetidos ou não à assepsia superficial. O fungo Cladosporium caryigenum, {{promotor}} da rancificação das amêndoas foi observado, em amêndoas e cascas, nas cultivares Burkett, Frotscher e Moneymaker; Fusarium sp., foi encontrado em porcentuais elevados, tanto em amêndoas quanto em cascas das três cultivares estudadas; Cephalothecium roseum, causador do mofo róseo em amêndoas, na cultivar Frotscher. Aspergillus sp. e Penicillium sp., causadores de emboloramento e produtores de aflotoxinas foram observados em porcentuais representativos, em amêndoas da cultivar Frotscher e em amêndoas e cascas das cultivares Frotscher, Burkett e Moneymaker, respectivamente. Os maiores porcentuais de perda do rendimento foram observados na cultivar Burkett, por causa da incidência de Colletotrichum sp., causador da antracnose em amêndoas, que acarreta escurecimento e deterioração do produto final, levando-o ao descarte. The knowledgement of {{the natural}} behavior of the main diseases of Pecan nut is of utmost importance for the stablishment of an implantation plan for that culture. The <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>control</b> and cultural treatments should be performed {{in order not to}} change the quality of the final product. Nuts harvest in 2005 from Uraí-PR of Burkett, Frotscher and Moneymaker cultivars, were evaluated in order to identify and quantify associated microorganisms in the nuts and fruit cover, as well to observe the differences among the microorganisms that colonize the different cultivars. The fruits were evaluated at post-harvest, thirty days kept in natural temperature, through filter paper method, being submitted or not to surface assepsy. The fungi Cladosporium caryigenum, rancification promoter to the almonds was observed on almonds and covers on the cultivars Burkett, Frotscher and Moneymaker; Fusarium sp., was observed in high concentration, on almonds {{as well as on the}} cover of all the studied cultivars; Cephalothecium roseum, responsible for the pink mildew, in almonds in the Frotscher cultivar.

40|$|Thesis (MScAgric (Conservation Ecology and Entomology) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2005. The South African {{table grape}} {{industry}} exports approximately 60 % {{of the table}} grapes produced. A major threat to the export of these grapes is the phytosanitary risk that insect pests pose. This {{study was conducted in}} the Hex River Valley, South Africa’s main table grape producing area. The aim {{of this study was to}} reduce the number of phytosanitary rejections from insects on table grapes from the Hex River Valley. Thus the main objectives of the study were to identify the most important phytosanitary pests in the Hex River Valley; the determination of their presence in the vineyards with possible means to control them; and to assess the possibility of using postharvest quarantine treatments in the Western Cape. Further aims were to determine the effect of different colour harvesting crates on the phytosanitary pests and whether the phytosanitary pests infested the grapes via packhouses. The most important phytosanitary pests of table grapes of the Hex River Valley are in order of importance: Phlyctinus callosus (Schonherr) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), Epichoristodes acerbella Walker (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), Planococcus ficus (Signoret) (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae), Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann) (Diptera: Tephritidae), Gonocephalum simplex Fabricius (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) and Dysdercus fasciatus Signoret (Hemiptera: Pyrrhocoridae). 12. 71 % of rejections were from species that were not identified, while a further 33 % of the rejections were possibly identified incorrectly. <b>Phytosanitary</b> <b>control</b> of P. callosus appeared to be far more effective using Plantex® than pesticides. Weather conditions appeared to affect the abundance of P. callosus, especially warm weather, while bunches harboured less P. callosus later in the day. Control of E. acerbella with DiPel® (Bacillus thuringiensis var. kurstaki) appeared to at least reduce the population within the vineyards, and so its use is recommended. P. ficus is a non-actionable species for the USA market and is not listed as a phytosanitary pest for the Israeli market and so should not be causing any phytosanitary rejections. C. capitata appeared to be successfully controlled by the fruit fly sterile release program and the cold sterilisation it currently undergoes. G. simplex caused few rejections. It is still unclear where this pest infests the grapes, as it was found in both the field and in the packhouses. D. fasciatus occurrence on grapes was probably accidental. It was shown that picking during the early and late parts of the day, when this species was less active, reduced its occurrence in bunches. Gryllus bimaculatus (De Geer) (Orthoptera: Gryllidae), although not reported as a reason for rejections in table grapes for the past two years, was an actionable species that was present in large numbers in the Hex River Valley. There was a strong correlation between increasing quantities of pesticides and higher abundances of G. bimaculatus. It appeared to be an indicator of the overuse of pesticides. Results of this study showed that infestation by the phytosanitary pests came from neighbouring vineyards. The creation of barriers to prevent the movement of these pests between vineyards is suggested. Methyl bromide is the most commonly used postharvest quarantine treatment. Owing to the ozone-depleting properties of methyl bromide, it is scheduled to be outlawed in many countries from 2005. Alternative postharvest treatments are irradiation, extreme temperatures, forced air, vapour-heat treatments and the use of controlled atmospheres. Irradiation treatments appeared to control the pests at doses that do not damage the grapes. Controlled atmosphere treatments also have a high probability of success, although more research is required on this treatment. Low temperature treatments are relatively cheap as most exported fruit already undergoes cold storage, and appears to control species in the families Pseudococcidae and Tephritidae, although further research is required for the other pest. Colour or location of the harvesting crates in the vineyards appeared not to influence the number of phytosanitary pests collected, as they were not attracted to these crates...|$|E
40|$|A Macaúba (Acrocomia aculeata) é uma é uma palmeira nativa das regiões neotropicais e comumente habita áreas abertas e com alta incidência solar. Apesar de ser encontrada em regiões com solos arenosos e baixo índice hídrico, desenvolve-se melhor em locais onde há solos férteis. Acrocomia aculeata e considerada uma planta rustica e promissora na extração e produção de óleo combustível. Os cachos estão constituídos de frutos globosos, do tipo drupa, constituídos por cerca de 20 % de epicarpo (casca), 40 % de mesocarpo (polpa), 33 % de endocarpo (tegumento) e 7 % de semente (amêndoa). Os teores de óleo são ligeiramente maiores na polpa (60 %), em relação à amêndoa (55 %). A frutificação da Macaúba é supra anual (acima de 12 meses), o amadurecimento dos frutos é lento e indetectável visualmente. O epicarpo é duro e muda de coloração aproximadamente às 14 semanas após antese (SAA) tornando difícil determinar o desenvolvimento e maturidade do fruto, o é possível em outros frutos carnosos. A comercialização de produtos vegetais como os frutos, precisa de informações detalhadas que permitam estimar o grão de desenvolvimento do órgão, diferenciação dos tecidos, acumulo de reservas e principalmente o ponto de colheita, o qual determinará a perecibilidade e período de armazenagem do produto. Em geral, todos os frutos carnosos apresentam um padrão de crescimento similar. Esse padrão de crescimento é descrito por um comportamento sigmoide simples, duplo e em alguns casos, triplo. A descrição desse padrão de crescimento, influência diretamente em algumas práticas agronómicas como, irrigação, aplicação de reguladores de crescimento, controle fitossanitário e período crítico de colheita. Este estudo teve como objetivo caracterizar o padrão de crescimento das partes constituintes do fruto e o acúmulo de reservas como amido, açúcares solúveis totais (AST), açúcares redutores (AR), açúcares não redutores (ANR) e óleo do mesocarpo de frutos de macaúba. O experimento foi realizado com plantas adultas de população nativa do município de Acaiaca, região Sudeste de Minas Gerais - Brasil, catalogado como clima {{subtropical}} úmido segundo a classificação climática de Koppen-Geiger: Cwa. Coletou-se um fruto por cacho uma semana após abertura da espata (SAAP) até a queda natural dos frutos às 62 SAA. Determinou-se a abertura da espata com base em um padrão visual da antese da flor masculina, intervalo compreendido entre 12 - 24 h horas após abertura da espata (HAAP). Para as análises estatísticas foram usados os valores médios das variáveis analisadas. O delineamento experimental foi em blocos casualizados e para cada avaliação foi estimada a equação de regressão. O teor de água dos frutos atingiu um pico máximo de 87 % às 8 SAA, posteriormente sofreu queda gradual com valor mínimo de 23 % de teor de água às 58 SAA. Os padrões de crescimento do epicarpo, do endocarpo e da amêndoa foram descritos por um comportamento sigmoide simples (uma fase de acúmulo de matéria seca), e do mesocarpo por um comportamento sigmoide duplo (duas fases de acúmulo de matéria seca). Às 6 SAA foi possível separar fisicamente o epicarpo, o endocarpo e o mesocarpo o qual, neste estádio, estava constituído por: 25 % de amido, 10, 5 % de AST, 9 % de AR e 1, 5 % de ANR. O acumulo de óleo no mesocarpo teve um comportamento linear com 10 % de teor de óleo às 34 SAA e atingindo 55 % às 62 SAA. O acúmulo de óleo no mesocarpo esteve diretamente relacionado com a queda no teor de amido. O epicarpo e o endocarpo atingiram o maior acúmulo de massa seca às 13 SAA e 24 SAA, respectivamente. O fruto de macaúba alcançaram o diâmetro externo transversal (DET) máximo (45 mm) às 13 SAA mantendo esse valor constante até a última avalição. Observou-se que os primeiros dois tecidos desenvolvidos foram o epicarpo e o endocarpo, consideradas estruturas de proteção do fruto e da semente, respectivamente. Após 13 SAA, iniciou-se o processo de amadurecimento do fruto, o qual foi separado em duas fases, física e química. The Macaúba (Acrocomia aculeata) is an {{oil palm}} native from the neotropical regions {{and it is}} often found in open areas with high solar incidence. Despite being found in regions with sandy soils and a low hydric index, it develops better in locations where there are fertile soils. Acrocomia aculeata is considered a rustic plant and promissory in the extraction and production of combustible oil. The bunches are constituted by globular fruits, drupe type, composed by nearly 20 % epicarp (shell), 40 % mesocarp (pulp), 33 % endocarp (tegument) and 7 % seed (almond). The oil contents are slightly bigger in the pulp (60 %) than in the almond (55 %). The fructification of the Macaúba is supra annual (above 12 months), the fruits maturation is slow and visually undetectable. The epicarp is rigid and it changes its color approximately at 14 weeks after antese (WAA) turning development and fruit maturity really difficult to determine, what is possible to do in other fleshy fruits. Commercialization of plant products such as the fruits, it needs detailed information that allows to estimate the degree of organ development, tissues differentiation, reservoir accumulation and mainly the harvesting point, which will determine perishability and storing period of the product. Generally, all the fleshy fruits show a growing pattern similar. That growing pattern is described by a simple sigmoid behavior, double and sometimes, triples. The description of that growing pattern, influence directly in some agronomic practices such as, irrigation, application of growing regulators, <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>control</b> and critic period of harvesting. This study had as an objective characterize the growing pattern of the constituents parts of the fruit and the reservoir accumulation such as amides, total soluble sugars, (TSS), reducing sugars (RS), no reducing sugars (NRS) and mesocarp oil of the macaúba fruit. The experiment was carried on with adult plants of the native population from the Acaiaca municipality, in the southeast of Minas Gerais Brazil, cataloged as subtropical humid weather according to the climatic classification made by Koppen-Geiger: Cwa. One fruit per bunch was collected {{one week after the}} opening of the espata (SAAP) until the natural fall of the fruits at 62 WAA. The opening of the espata was determined based on a visual pattern of the antese of the masculine flower, with an interval between 12 - 24 hours after opening of the espata (HAAP). For the statistic analyses, the averages of the analyzed variables were used. The experimental design was randomized blocks and for every evaluation a regression equation was estimated. The water content of the fruits reached a maximum pick of 87 % at 8 SAA, posteriorly, it suffered a gradual fall with a minimum value of 23 % of water content at 58 SAA. The growing patterns of the epicarp, endocarp and of the almond were described by a simple sigmoid behavior (an accumulation of dry matter phase), and of the mesocarp by a double sigmoid behavior (two phases of dry matter accumulation). At 6 SAA was possible to separate physically the epicarp, endocarp and the mesocarp which, at this stage, was constituted by: 25 % amide, 10, 5 % TSS, 9 % RS and 1, 5 % NRS. The oil accumulation in the mesocarp had a linear behavior with 10 % oil content at 34 SAA and reaching 55 % at 62 SAA. The oil accumulation in the mesocarp was directly related to an amide content fall. The epicarp and the endocarp reached the biggest dry matter accumulation at 13 SAA and 24 SAA, respectively. The Macaúba fruits obtained the transversal external diameter (TED) maximum (45 mm) at 13 SAA maintaining that constant value until the last evaluation. It was observed that the two first tissues developed were the epicarp and the endocarp, considered structures of protection of the fruit and the seed, respectively. After 13 SAA, began the maturing process of the fruit, which was separated in two phases, physical and chemical...|$|E
