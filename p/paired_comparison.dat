40|$|The use of paired-comparison psychophysical {{experiments}} is {{an important}} technique that is used widely in imaging studies.

40|$|Summary. We {{investigate}} {{by means}} of a simulation study whether standard structural equation modeling techniques are suitable for estimating an unrestricted Thurstonian model to: (a) multiple judgment <b>paired</b> <b>comparisons</b> data, and (b) ranking data. We point out that Thurstone's (1927) original model is not a proper model for multiple judgment <b>paired</b> <b>comparisons</b> data as it assigns zero probability to all intransitive <b>paired</b> <b>comparisons</b> patterns. To fit multiple judgment <b>paired</b> <b>comparisons</b> data one must employ Takane's (1987) extension of Thurstone's original model, or alternatively, a Thurstonian correlation structure model, which we introduce. We found that for some models as few as 100 observations suffice to obtain accurate parameter estimates, standard errors and goodness of fit tests when 7 stimuli are modeled (21 binary variables). For other models, however, sample sizes of 1000 observations are needed. All in all, the procedure investigated appears to be an attractive choice to estimate these models...|$|R

50|$|Pairwise {{comparison}} {{generally is}} any process of comparing entities in pairs to judge which of each entity is preferred, {{or has a}} greater amount of some quantitative property, {{or whether or not}} the two entities are identical. The method of pairwise comparison is used in the scientific study of preferences, attitudes, voting systems, social choice, public choice, requirements engineering and multiagent AI systems. In psychology literature, it {{is often referred to as}} <b>paired</b> <b>comparison.</b> Prominent psychometrician L. L. Thurstone first introduced a scientific approach to using pairwise comparisons for measurement in 1927, which he referred to as the law of comparative judgment. Thurstone linked this approach to psychophysical theory developed by Ernst Heinrich Weber and Gustav Fechner. Thurstone demonstrated that the method can be used to order items along a dimension such as preference or importance using an interval-type scale.|$|E

40|$|Zermelo’s 1928 {{paper on}} {{measuring}} participants ’ playing strengths in chess tournaments {{is a remarkable}} work {{in the history of}} <b>paired</b> <b>comparison</b> modeling. Apart from several contemporary papers by Thurstone (1927 a, 1927 b, 1927 c), Zermelo’s paper was an isolated excursion into <b>paired</b> <b>comparison</b> methods that was far ahead of its time. After this paper, the field remained mostly dormant for about 25 years until seminal publications by Bradley and Terry (1952) and Mosteller (1951 a, 1951 b, 1951 c) led to increased interest in <b>paired</b> <b>comparison</b> methodology. Subsequently, work in <b>paired</b> <b>comparison</b> methods has remained an active area of research since the 1950 ’s, and with <b>paired</b> <b>comparison</b> applications to large data sets including marketing research problems involving choice preference among consumers, the field continues to be active. Scholarly work in this area arguably led to popularizing <b>paired</b> <b>comparison</b> methods in the form of competitor rating systems. For example, in the United States, a rating system due to Elo (1978) for chess players was implemented in the early 1960 s (supplanting a fairly crude system developed in the 1950 s) which had as a basis the model appearing in Zermelo’s paper.

The listeners also rated their confidence in judging each testing stimulus on a seven-point EAI scale. The results showed that the <b>paired</b> <b>comparison</b> method specifically improved the inter-rater reliability in rating male rough stimuli and mildly dysphonic female stimuli.

The equivalency was corroborated by a specific substantial-psychological interpretation of the Rasch binary item response probability. Studying the relationships between the Thurstone and Rasch models from another perspective than Andrich’s, namely, from a data-theoretical point of view, it appears that the equivalency is based on an implicit assumption with respect to the subject population.
