40|$|Introduction. This paper reports {{results of}} an {{investigation}} into the needs of persons with disabilities wanting to participate in the use of virtual communities. The aim was to investigate 'how virtual communities for persons with long-term, severe physical disabilities can best be facilitated'? Method. A Grounded Theory approach was adopted to inform the investigation. In- depth interviews were conducted with twelve persons with paraplegia, quadriplegia or other severe, long-term physical or mobility disabilities and six health care professionals, service providers, information <b>personnel</b> and policy <b>advisers</b> who were involved in their well-being. Analysis. Rich explanations were derived about the information and communication technology (ICT) usage and the technologies' contributions towards restoration of sense of control over their lives. Results. The primary outcome of the investigation is a theory regarding the character of virtual communities for the disabled. The theory is represented as a Virtual Community Model. The model identifies: the need for 'a sense of control' as the foundation element of virtual communities for the disabled; the key domains in which disabled people participate in virtual communities; and the barriers and enablers to their participation. Conclusion. The model provides a framework which can be used by interest groups and other organizations to facilitate the development of virtual communities for persons with severe physical disabilities. The six key types of community need to be represented in such virtual communities if a full 'sense of control' is to be achieved by disabled persons...|$|R
40|$|INTERNATIONAL EDUCATIONAL EXCHANGE has beenI {{the subject}} of two earlier bibliographies {{published}} by the U. S. Office of Education. Prepared originally under a title slightlydifferent from the present one, the first compilation was made byThomas E. Cotner and John W. Grissom in 1951. This was re-vised and updated by Frank A. Knapp, Jr., and published in 1954. The current bibliography is greatly expanded and includes anew section on bibliographies in related fields, such as compara-tive education and English as a foreign or second language. Bothof these fields concern to some extent American and foreign ex-changees and problems of orientation, guidance, and counseling. For this reason it seemed desirable {{to have a new}} section onbibliographies in these fields, but not to duplicate their listings. An effort has been made to limit the coverage in the remainingsections of this bibliography to the international exchange andtraining of students, teachers, professors, research scholars,leaders, and specialists, and to trainees in many fields from othercountries and their American counterparts going abroad. It is believed that the publication will be useful to ForeignStudent Advisers, Fulbright Program <b>Advisers,</b> <b>personnel</b> ofpublic and private agencies, and to foundations and other organi-zations participating in exchange programs (including hospital-ity centers and international relations discussion groups).

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a field study at a large financial services firm that combines multiple methods, including two economic experiments, to measure ethical norms and their behavioral correlates. Standard survey questions eliciting ethical evaluations of actions in on-the-job ethical dilemmas are transformed into a series of incentivized coordination games in the first experiment. We use the results of this experiment to identify the actual ethical norms for financial adviser behavior held by key <b>personnel</b> - financial <b>advisers</b> and their corporate leaders - in three settings: a clash of incentives between serving the client and earning commissions, a dilemma about fiduciary responsibility to a client, and a dilemma about whistle-blowing on a peer. We also measure the beliefs of financial advisers about the ethical expectations of their corporate leaders and the beliefs of corporate leaders about financial adviser norms. In addition, we ask financial advisers about their personal normative opinions, matching a common methodology in the literature. We find, first, systematic agreements in the normative evaluations across the corporate hierarchy that are consistent with ex ante expectations, but second, we also find some measurable differences between the normative expectations of corporate leaders about on-the-job behavior and the actual norms shared among financial advisers. When there is a normative mismatch across the hierarchy we are able to distinguish miscommunication from ethical disagreement between leaders and employees. Our subjects also report their job satisfaction and take part in a second incentivized experiment in which it is costly to report private information honestly. A last finding is that a mismatch between advisers' personal ethical opinions and corporate norms - especially those of peers - strongly correlates with job dissatisfaction, and less strongly but significantly with the willingness to be dishonest...|$|R
500|$|An Albanian account {{describes}} the dispute as follows: [...] "By violating the formal Albanian-Soviet agreements signed in September 1957 an May 1959, the Soviet government did {{everything in its}} power to put under its control this Albanian base which {{at the same time}} served the defence of the socialist countries... On April 5, 1961, in a letter addressed to the governments of the Soviet Union and the East-European states it resolutely reaffirmed that it accepted only one solution of the problem: the base of Vlora belonged to Albania and all the naval means that were its property should be handed over to Albanian crew as soon as possible. Any other solution was an act which would lead to the unilateral violation {{on the part of the}} Soviet Union of the existing Albanian-Soviet agreements of the years 1957 and 1959." [...] In May 1961 the Soviets began dismantling the base and tried to seize the submarines, seizing some Albanian ships undergoing repairs at Sevastopol in the process. As the Albanian account describes it, [...] "The Soviet sailors and officers carried out numerous provocations, trying by all manner of means to create a pretext for the Soviet military intervention in Albania... On May 26, 1961 it seized in a demonstrative manner 8 submarines, the floating base 'Kotelnikov', as well as the Albanian warships that were laid for repair in the port of Sevastopol. On June 5, 1961 the <b>personnel</b> of Soviet <b>advisers</b> left the base at Vlora, too." [...] Hoxha's account is as follows: Admiral Vladimir Kasatonov of the Black Sea fleet [...] "came to Tirana with the mission of seizing not only the eight submarines... but even the submarines which we had taken over earlier. We told him bluntly: Either you hand the submarines over to us according to the agreement, or within a short time (we set the date) you must withdraw immediately from the bay... He did not hand over the submarines, but went to Vlora, boarded the command submarine and lined up the others in fighting formation. We gave orders to close the Sazan Narrows and to train the guns on the Soviet ships. Admiral Kasatonov, who had wanted to frighten us, was frightened himself. He was caught like a rat in a trap and if he attempted to implement his plan he might find himself at the bottom of the sea. In these conditions the admiral was obliged to take only the submarines with Soviet crews, and he sailed out of the bay back home with his tail between his legs." ...|$|R
40|$|This {{qualitative}} study develops {{a model of}} a virtual community for people with longterm, severe physical or mobility disabilities. The model also has implications for the wider community of people with disabilities. The study uses the Strauss and Corbin grounded theory methodology to inform the investigation from which a systematic theory has been developed. On the basis of this theory, the study proposes strategies for implementing the virtual community model. In-depth interviews were conducted with twelve Queenslanders with paraplegia, quadriplegia or other severe, long-term physical or mobility disabilities and with six health care professionals, service providers, information <b>personnel</b> and policy <b>advisers</b> involved in their well-being. The methodology used one interview question to determine their experiences and perceptions regarding virtual communities and the use of Information and Communications Technology (ICT). Each interview explored in detail the elements, enablers and barriers behind the usage of ICT and/or assistive technology. The personal responses and narratives of the people with disabilities who use the technology and their allied health care professionals were analysed and interpreted for meaning before the transcripts were returned to these participants for validation. Rich explanations were derived. Details of the various response categories of these interviews were analysed as part of the grounded theory, constant comparison methodology, and the relationship to the literature was considered. These de-constructed meanings were compared and contrasted with those in the current literature. The central theme to emerge from these narratives is that people with long-term disabilities regain a sense of control and independence in their lives through the use of ICT, as they move towards an on-line community. Other major themes that emerged from being on-line indicated that being on-line tended to break down people's isolation, while potentially changing the work paradigm (both vexed issues for people with disabilities). Information and communications technology and on-line communities offer ways to enhance every person's inclusion, participation and empowerment in our society. The primary outcome of the study is a theory regarding the character of virtual communities for people with long-term, severe mobility impairments that stakeholders may consider whenever such a virtual community is proposed. The theory is represented as a virtual community model. The model identifies the need for "a sense of control" as the foundational element of virtual communities for the disabled, and distinguishes the key domains in which disabled people participate in virtual communities. The barriers and enablers to their participation are specified within it. The model also provides a framework within which virtual communities can be facilitated. It melds six types of e-communities or sets of well-developed discrete categories (for example, themes, concepts) that the data from this study revealed: education-oriented, fantasy-oriented, information-oriented, interestoriented, relationship-oriented and transaction-oriented, depending on the type(s) of consumer need(s) to be met. The study concludes that although the technology itself provides strategies for independence and thus facilitates self-empowerment, it is also capable of being disempowering. Many interviewees referred to this aspect as a "double-edged sword". Empowerment and dis-empowerment are intersecting processes because of digital divide and information literacy issues and this "double-edged sword", which virtual reality presents for people with physical disabilities. Based on the new knowledge and the model as the outcomes of this study, a range of recommendations are discussed that have application in the community for persons with mobility impairments...|$|R
