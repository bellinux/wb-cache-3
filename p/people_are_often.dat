5|$|In {{a pair of}} studies, high-functioning {{children}} with autism aged 8â€“15 performed equally well as, and adults better than, individually matched controls at basic language tasks involving vocabulary and spelling. Both autistic groups performed worse than controls at complex language tasks such as figurative language, comprehension and inference. As <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>often</b> sized up initially from their basic language skills, these studies suggest that people speaking to autistic individuals {{are more likely to}} overestimate what their audience comprehends.|$|E
5|$|Sexual {{dysfunction}} is a stressor in relationships. <b>People</b> <b>are</b> <b>often</b> {{as concerned}} about failing {{to keep a}} partner satisfied as they are about meeting their own sexual needs. In fact, two of the top reasons people with SCI cite for wanting to have sex are for intimacy and to keep a partner. The frequency of sex correlates with {{the desire of the}} uninjured partner.|$|E
5000|$|Sexuality for {{disabled}} <b>people</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> linked to fetishes and [...] "freakish excess." ...|$|R
50|$|In some {{instances}} house parties do not attract large crowds, and with ten or fewer <b>people</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> {{referred to as}} a 'gathering'.|$|R
5000|$|Concerts at the venue, {{which held}} up to 1,000 <b>people,</b> <b>were</b> <b>often</b> [...] "all ages" [...] events, with just over one percent {{restricted}} to patrons 21 and over.|$|R
25|$|White Americans in San Francisco are {{currently}} 48.5% {{of the population}} of San Francisco. Non-Hispanic whites are 41.9% of the population. White <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>often</b> blamed for gentrification.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the main}} themes of Eugene Onegin is the {{relationship}} between fiction and real life. <b>People</b> <b>are</b> <b>often</b> shaped by art and the work is packed with allusions to other major literary works.|$|E
25|$|However, {{this does}} not address the former issue of being able to save their money easily, keep it in {{safekeeping}} and invest it so that it grows. While post offices have tried to address this through postal savings banks, <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>often</b> lured by Ponzi schemes that promise much higher returns.|$|E
50|$|A {{relationship}} among three <b>people</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> called a triad or threesome; among four people a quad or foursome. Sometimes all groupings {{of three or}} more are called moresomes.|$|R
50|$|In medicine, the {{terminal}} drop hypothesis is a hypothesis that a sharp reduction in cognitive capacity in older <b>people</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> correlated with impending death, typically within five years.|$|R
5000|$|The Tecouanime, {{the slave}} merchants. These <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>often</b> {{referred}} to as the richest of merchants, as they {{played a central role in}} bathing the slaves used for sacrificial victims.|$|R
25|$|After the war, {{there was}} a {{resurgence}} of Russian nationalism in the mid-1950s. In Yakutia from the 1630s to 1917 (1957), published under his direction, the violence, murder, and enslavements are treated as isolated incidents in a generally peaceful movement of Russians into the territory. Leaders of the local <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>often</b> characterized as the instigators of the violence.|$|E
25|$|Immediate {{surgery is}} not {{necessarily}} required. Occasionally people may go home and follow up for surgery {{in the next few}} days. A number of surgical techniques may be used including maxillomandibular fixation and open reduction internal fixation (ORIF). <b>People</b> <b>are</b> <b>often</b> put on antibiotics such as penicillin for a brief period of time. The evidence to support this practice; however, is poor.|$|E
25|$|Recovery {{may begin}} between 7 and 14days after first symptoms. Death, if it occurs, follows {{typically}} 6 to 16 days from first symptoms {{and is often}} due to low blood pressure from fluid loss. In general, bleeding often indicates a worse outcome, and blood loss may result in death. <b>People</b> <b>are</b> <b>often</b> in a coma {{near the end of}} life.|$|E
2500|$|The Simele Massacre of the Assyrian <b>people</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> {{regarded}} as a phase of the Assyrian genocide beginning in August 1914 {{in the early days}} of what became World War I.|$|R
50|$|According to Sternhell, the Zionist views {{underlying}} the negation of the Diaspora, e.g., {{the view of}} the Jews as a parasitic <b>people,</b> <b>were</b> <b>often</b> quite similar to the views underlying modern European anti-Semitism.|$|R
50|$|Sales' view of {{the native}} <b>peoples</b> <b>was</b> <b>often</b> {{strongly}} negative, recalling the acerbity of the Jesuit Johann Jakob Baegert. However, Sales provided indispensable information about traditional subsistence activities, religion, and many other matters.|$|R
25|$|<b>People</b> <b>are</b> <b>often</b> {{fearful of}} large pythons and may kill them on sight. The African rock python {{may also be}} {{threatened}} by hunting for leather in some areas. It is also collected for the pet trade, {{although it is not}} generally recommended as a pet due to its large size and unpredictable temperament. Little information is available on levels of international trade in this species.|$|E
25|$|Anticoagulant {{therapy is}} the {{mainstay}} of treatment. Acutely, supportive treatments, such as oxygen or analgesia, may be required. <b>People</b> <b>are</b> <b>often</b> admitted to hospital {{in the early stages}} of treatment, and tend to remain under inpatient care until the INR has reached therapeutic levels. Increasingly, however, low-risk cases are managed at home in a fashion already common in the treatment of DVT. Evidence to support one approach versus the other is weak.|$|E
25|$|Lack of {{behavior}} change: Some communities have toilets, yet people prefer to defecate in the open. In some cases, these toilets {{are provided by}} the government or other organizations and the people do not like them, or do not value them. They continue to defecate in the open. Also, older <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>often</b> found to defecate in the open and they are hesitant to change their behavior and go inside a closed toilet.|$|E
50|$|In {{film and}} {{television}} productions, trafficking in <b>people</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> portrayed on-screen as involving a process of using physical force, fraud, deception, or other forms or coercion or intimidation to obtain, recruit, harbour, and transport people.|$|R
25|$|Common <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>often</b> {{restricted}} to undyed plain clothes. This everyday dress underwent relatively few changes during the Joseon period. The basic everyday dress {{was shared by}} everyone, but distinctions were drawn in official and ceremonial clothes.|$|R
50|$|In the Viking Age in particular, Norse <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>often</b> {{buried with}} a range of grave goods. It is possible, {{although}} not certain, that these artefacts were intended to accompany the dead on a journey to the afterlife.|$|R
25|$|Increased climate variability, that is {{associated}} with global warming, has brought with it periods of heavy rainfall and high tides which in turn results in stagnant water which can stay in the area for up to 4 weeks due to insufficient drainage and improper solid waste disposal. <b>People</b> <b>are</b> <b>often</b> stranded inside their homes and are exposed to water-borne diseases such as dengue and leptospirosis. Better early warning systems are needed to manage the risk associated with increased rainfall.|$|E
25|$|The {{second part}} of the book {{examines}} the nature of online social interactions, {{and the way in which}} social media has changed how people, particularly younger people, connect with one another. Turkle argues that because people in interpersonal social situations, particularly young <b>people,</b> <b>are</b> <b>often</b> distracted by their phones, they will pay insufficient attention to one another, creating increasingly shallow relationships. Turkle argues that teenagers' reliance on friends' advice prevents self-reflection, leading to less personal independence.|$|E
25|$|Many <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>often</b> nude in {{the privacy}} of their home or garden, either alone or with members of the family; naturists {{normally}} refer to them as at-home-nudists or closet-nudists. This may be occasional nudity or as a naturist lifestyle. There are differences of opinion as to whether, and if so to what extent, parents should appear naked in front of their children, and whether children should be nude within the home in the view of their family as well as visitors. This has attracted a great deal of academic study.|$|E
5000|$|Lemuelites (...) were a {{subdivision}} of Lamanites, a purported {{people of the}} ancient Americas referenced in the Book of Mormon. To save time and prevent confusion those who were sought to destroy Nephi's <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>often</b> just called Lamanites.|$|R
5000|$|The owner, {{editor and}} key {{writer for the}} {{newspaper}} was Najib Nassar, a Palestinian Arab Christian and staunch anti-Zionist, whose editorials warning of the dangers posed by Zionism to the Palestinian <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>often</b> reprinted in other Syrian newspapers.|$|R
50|$|During the Japanese {{occupation}} Menadonese, Ambonese and Indo <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>often</b> randomly arrested during raids {{and severely}} tortured by the Kempeitai. Kawilarang survived several Japanese tortures (1943 and 1944), but suffered lifelong disability {{in his right}} arm and numerous scars.|$|R
25|$|As thymomas {{are seen}} in 10% of all people with the MG, <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>often</b> given a chest X-ray and CT scan to {{evaluate}} their need for surgical removal of their thymus and any cancerous tissue that may be present. Even if surgery is performed to remove a thymoma, it generally {{does not lead to}} the remission of MG. Surgery in the case of MG involves the removal of the thymus, although in 2013 there was no clear indication of beneficial except {{in the presence of a}} thymoma. A 2016 randomized controlled trial, however, found some benefits.|$|E
25|$|The Akha <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>often</b> {{noted for}} their very {{recognizable}} sartorial practices. Akha women spin cotton into thread {{with a hand}} spindle and weave it on a foot-treadle loom. The cloth is hand dyed with indigo. Women wear broad leggings, a short black skirt with a white beaded sporran, a loose fitting black jacket with heavily embroidered cuffs and lapels. Akha women {{are known for their}} embroidery skills. While traditional clothes are typically worn for special ceremonies, one is more likely to see Akha villagers in full traditional garb in areas that have heavy volumes of tourists, particularly in Thailand.|$|E
25|$|Large bands {{also require}} {{a number of}} support staff who can move equipment, repair {{instruments}} and uniforms, create and manipulate props used in performances, and provide food, water and medical assistance. Additional staff may be utilized when the band hosts functions such as competitions and reviews. In high school bands, these activities are usually performed by volunteers, typically parents of band members or the band members of the lower grades. These <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>often</b> referred to as runners or boosters. Significant support staff for college bands and independent corps are typically paid by the university or the corps organization, respectively.|$|E
50|$|The {{appearance}} of poison ivy can vary greatly between environments, and even within a large area. Identification by experienced <b>people</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> made difficult by leaf damage, the plant's leafless condition during winter, and unusual growth forms due to environmental or genetic factors.|$|R
50|$|Semitic <b>peoples</b> came to <b>be</b> seen as {{a foreign}} {{presence}} within Aryan societies, and the Semitic <b>peoples</b> <b>were</b> <b>often</b> pointed to {{as the cause of}} conversion and destruction of social order and values leading to culture and civilization's downfall by proto-Nazi theorists such as Houston Stewart Chamberlain.|$|R
50|$|A {{permanently}} established orthography did {{not exist}} in the Middle Ages, and toward the end of this period, <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>often</b> liberal with consonants which <b>were</b> <b>often</b> doubled, as in ffonger 'fÃ¥nge' aff 'av' and hwss 'hus'. Spellings also commonly included other letters that did not correspond to the pronunciation at all.|$|R
