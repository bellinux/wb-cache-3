40|$|Fresh <b>pastas</b> <b>with</b> Shiitake {{mushroom}} flour (MF) were produced. The MF {{was produced}} by drying the mushrooms at 40, 50, and 60 ᵒC. Proportions of 5 %, 10 %, and 15 % MF were used to prepare the fresh <b>pastas</b> (FP), <b>with</b> two types of wheat flour (regular (RWF) and 30 % semolina wheat flour (SWF)). Mushroom pastas were analysed before (FP) and after cooking (CP). FP presented moisture and water acidity lower than 35 % and 0. 95, respectively. The L* and b* colour parameters were similar for <b>pasta</b> produced <b>with</b> RWF and SWF, with the major differences for <b>pastas</b> <b>with</b> mushroom flours obtained at 40 ᵒC and with the increasing of MF. Thus, with increasing of MF and high drying temperatures, pastas were redder, darker and less yellow. The CP showed high colour similarities between them. Generally, the introduction of MF changes the texture of pastas. Internal and external firmness, and adhesiveness, decreased with increasing MF and for higher drying temperatures. CP presented similar tendencies, with low firmness, high adhesiveness and high stickiness. The soluble solids were determined in CP cooking water, and range between 5. 8 and 9. 0 %, without a consistent pattern, allowing classifying the pastas as high and medium quality. Sensorial analysis revealed that consumers preferred <b>pastas</b> produced <b>with</b> high content of MF with similar profiles for all the parameters tested, {{and the influence of}} the type of wheat flour was not important. It could be concluded that MP could be used to produce alternative foods, innovative and easy to cook. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
25|$|The {{invention}} of the first tomato sauces dates from the late 18th century: the first written record of <b>pasta</b> <b>with</b> tomato sauce {{can be found in}} the 1790 cookbook L'Apicio Moderno by Roman chef Francesco Leonardi.

25|$|In the Philippines, {{spaghetti}} {{is often}} {{served with a}} distinct, slightly sweet yet flavourful meat sauce (the base {{of which would be}} tomato sauce or paste and ketchup), frequently containing ground beef or pork and diced hot dogs and ham. It is spiced with some soy sauce, heavy quantities of garlic, dried oregano sprigs and sometimes with dried bay leaf, and afterwards topped with grated cheese. Other pasta dishes are also cooked nowadays in the Filipino kitchen, like carbonara, <b>pasta</b> <b>with</b> alfredo sauce, and baked macaroni. These dishes are usually cooked for gatherings and special occasions, like family reunions or Christmas. Macaroni or other tube pasta is also used in sopas, a local chicken broth soup.|$|E

40|$|This work {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} processing faba bean flour on textural, structural and sensory properties of gluten-free pasta. Pasta was prepared using faba bean flour, starch-rich fraction of faba bean flour or faba bean flour fermented with lactic acid bacteria. The impact of cross-linking enzyme transglutaminase (TG) {{on the quality of}} faba pasta was also studied. The structure, cooking quality, starch digestibility, textural and sensory characteristics of faba pasta samples were evaluated and compared to semolina <b>pasta.</b> <b>Pasta</b> prepared <b>with</b> faba bean and fermented faba bean flours had higher cooking loss (10. 8 – 11. 5 %) and lower water absorption (130 - 160 %) than semolina pasta (6 and 193 %), but pasta prepared from fractionated faba flour had similar water absorption to semolina pasta. The texture of <b>pasta</b> made <b>with</b> faba bean flour was comparable to that of semolina pasta. Fermentation adversely affected the texture by increasing hardness, chewiness, sourness and flavour intensity. Starch hydrolysis index of <b>pasta</b> prepared <b>with</b> the three faba bean flours was similar to semolina pasta (46 - 50).

5000|$|Cuisine {{traditionally}} {{attributed to}} the poor often mixes <b>pasta</b> <b>with</b> legumes. The most popular are: pasta e fagioli (<b>pasta</b> <b>with</b> beans), sometimes enriched with pork rind (cotiche), pasta e ceci (<b>pasta</b> <b>with</b> chickpeas), pasta e lenticchie (<b>pasta</b> <b>with</b> lentils), pasta e piselli (<b>pasta</b> <b>with</b> peas). Nowadays cicerchie (Lathyrus sativus) have become very rare. Similarly to legumes, other vegetables are associated with pasta, like pasta e patate (<b>pasta</b> <b>with</b> potatoes), pasta e cavolfiore (<b>pasta</b> <b>with</b> cauliflower), pasta e zucca (<b>pasta</b> <b>with</b> pumpkin). The most traditional cooking method consists in cooking the condiments first, for instance, pan fry garlic with oil, then add steamed beans, or fry onion and celery, then add potatoes cut into little dices; then, after frying, water is added, brought to boiling temperature, salted, and pasta is added and stirred frequently. While cooking {{with all the other}} ingredients, pasta does not lose its starch, which would have lost if cooked separately in salty water and then drained. Cooking pasta together with vegetables makes the sauce more creamy ("azzeccato"), and is a way of preparing pasta distinct from the tradition of [...] "noble" [...] cuisine, which prepares similar dishes in a way more similar to broth or soups, adding pasta after cooking it separately. One more hearty dish in the cuisine of the poor is pasta simply cooked with cheese and eggs stracciatella (pasta caso e ova).|$|E
