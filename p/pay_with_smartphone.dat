40|$|International audienceSmartphones are {{changing}} the way consumers shop, even in brick-and-mortar settings. This study explores consumers’ adoption of proximity mobile payment technology (p-m-payment), which enables them to <b>pay</b> <b>with</b> their <b>smartphones</b> for purchases in a physical store. With a perceived value perspective, the authors identify utilitarian, hedonic, and social benefits and financial and privacy risks as key drivers. They also investigate differences compared with the drivers of more familiar mobile shopping usages and highlight the role of experience. The paper discusses implications for both mobile and channel research and recommendations to help retailers take advantage of p-m-payment technology...|$|R

40|$|Photography {{and video}} making have become {{entangled}} with mobility and mobile social media as experienced in everyday life. This, in turn has affected how smartphones and applications influence contemporary everyday aesthetics. Romance, memory, nostalgia, playfulness and epiphany all {{play a part}} in the desire to create evocative still and moving images that capture creative moments. Non-representational theoretical concepts provide a way to grapple with the dynamic and intricate relations between creative practices <b>with</b> <b>smartphones</b> and the corporeal messiness of everyday life. This paper aims to capture some of the more-than-representational, the more-than-textual, multi-sensory aspects of visual creative practices <b>with</b> <b>smartphone</b> cameras. It provides a braided account of the dynamic relations between smartphone assemblages and embodied mobility that contribute to current discussions in creative practice research...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} twofold. First, it aims to investigate the various values users achieve <b>with</b> <b>smartphones,</b> which is a form of user-empowering information technology (IT). The other objective is to introduce a means-end chain approach into IT-user studies. An important attraction of smartphones is their personalized environment, which is mainly provided by varied applications. The user personalization ability implies that users achieve diverse benefits with smartphones; that is, users decide what a smartphone is to them rather than adopt a given product. Thus, investigating what values users pursue <b>with</b> a <b>smartphone</b> (i. e. a value-oriented approach) will give insights into understanding the users. To investigate user values in using smartphones, we conducted a laddering interview <b>with</b> 54 <b>smartphone</b> users and analyzed the data by using a means-end chain approach to understand consumers' hierarchical value structure. This study contributes to value-oriented research on user-empowering IT by revelling how users benefit from smartphones. Furthermore, the study advances value-oriented research by showing what users actually do <b>with</b> <b>smartphones,</b> from concrete activities to abstract values. In addition, a means-end chain approach introduced in the study can be another angle for the investigation of user adoption of technology, in that it can describe IT use contexts and practices, which become an important object of analysis in the information systems research. close 0...|$|R
