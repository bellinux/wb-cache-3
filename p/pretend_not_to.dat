25|$|The {{next day}} the Czech {{authorities}} issued an international arrest warrant for Dahlgren, who, as was later revealed, had already passed through the passport control at Vienna International Airport before his name appeared in the international database. Subsequently, at around 1PM the Austrian authorities alerted the crew of Austrian Airlines flight OS93 of the arrest warrant. The flight, carrying Dahlgren, had left Vienna at 10:46AM and was at time flying over the United Kingdom. After contemplating an emergency landing or a return to Vienna, the pilots {{decided it would be}} safer to continue the flight. The cabin crew were instructed to <b>pretend</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> know anything about the suspect on the flight. Immediately after landing at Washington Dulles International Airport, the plane was stormed by U.S Customs and Border Protection Officers, who arrested Dahlgren and turned him over to the FBI.|$|E

He writes, [...] "I {{began to}} exude some kind of masculinity, in the way I tossed up and caught my eraser, for instance." [...] In another incident, Cal discusses how his penchants were masculine. While his female classmates are {{turned off by the}} blood in the Iliad, Cal is [...] "thrilled to [...] the stabbings and beheadings, the gouging out of eyes, the juicy eviscerations." [...] Cal ponders his gender identity and how males and females associate with each other, reflecting, [...] "Did I see through the male tricks because I was destined to scheme that way myself? Or do girls see through the tricks, too, and just <b>pretend</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> notice?" ...|$|E
2500|$|... "We {{who live}} abroad are {{accustomed}} to believe that almost all Eretz Yisrael is now uninhabited desert and whoever wishes can buy land there as he pleases. [...] But this is not true. [...] It {{is very difficult to}} find in the land [...] cultivated fields that are not used for planting. [...] Only those sand fields or stone mountains that would require the investment of hard labour and great expense to make them good for planting remain uncultivated and that's because the Arabs do not like working too much in the present for a distant future. Therefore, {{it is very difficult to}} find good land for cattle. [...] And not only peasants, but also rich landowners, are not selling good land so easily...We who live abroad {{are accustomed to}} believing that the Arabs are all wild desert people who, like donkeys, neither see nor understand what is happening around them. [...] But this is a grave mistake. [...] The Arab, like all the Semites, is sharp minded and shrewd. [...] All the townships of Syria and Eretz Yisrael are full of Arab merchants who know how to exploit the masses and keep track of everyone with whom they deal – the same as in Europe. [...] The Arabs, especially the urban elite, see and understand what we are doing and what we wish to do on the land, but they keep quiet and <b>pretend</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> notice anything. [...] For now, they do not consider our actions as presenting a future danger to them. … But, if the time comes that our people's life in Eretz Yisrael will develop to a point where we are taking their place, either slightly or significantly, the natives are not going to just step aside so easily.|$|E

40|$|Recent neuroimaging {{studies have}} shown the {{importance}} of the prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices in deception. However, {{little is known about the}} role of each of these regions during deception. Using positron emission tomography (PET), we mea-sured brain activation while participants told truths or lies about two types of real-world events: experienced and unexperienced. The imaging data revealed that activity of the dorsolateral, ventrolateral and medial prefrontal cortices was commonly asso-ciated with both types of deception (pretending <b>to</b> know and <b>pretending</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> know), whereas activity of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) was only associated with <b>pretending</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> know. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) increase in the ACC was positively correlated with that in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex only during <b>pretending</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> know. These results suggest that the lateral and medial prefrontal cortices have general roles in deception, whereas the ACC contributes specifically <b>to</b> <b>pretending</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> know...|$|R
