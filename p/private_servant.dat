60|$|While {{left alone}} with them, he was not long in observing some things tending to heighten his first impressions; but {{surprise}} was lost in pity, both for the Spaniards and blacks, alike evidently reduced from scarcity of water and provisions; while long-continued suffering seemed to have brought out the less good-natured qualities of the negroes, besides, at the same time, impairing the Spaniard's authority over them. But, under the circumstances, precisely this condition of things {{was to have been}} anticipated. In armies, navies, cities, or families, in nature herself, nothing more relaxes good order than misery. Still, Captain Delano was not without the idea, that had Benito Cereno been a man of greater energy, misrule would hardly have come to the present pass. But the debility, constitutional or induced by hardships, bodily and mental, of the Spanish captain, was too obvious to be overlooked. A prey to settled dejection, as if long mocked with hope he would not now indulge it, even when it had ceased to be a mock, the prospect of that day, or evening at furthest, lying at anchor, with plenty of water for his people, and a brother captain to counsel and befriend, seemed in no perceptible degree to encourage him. His mind appeared unstrung, if not still more seriously affected. Shut up in these oaken walls, chained to one dull round of command, whose unconditionality cloyed him, like some hypochondriac abbot he moved slowly about, at times suddenly pausing, starting, or staring, biting his lip, biting his finger-nail, flushing, paling, twitching his beard, with other symptoms of an absent or moody mind. This distempered spirit was lodged, as before hinted, in as distempered a frame. He was rather tall, but seemed never to have been robust, and now with nervous suffering was almost worn to a skeleton. A tendency to some pulmonary complaint appeared to have been lately confirmed. His voice was like that of one with lungs half gone--hoarsely suppressed, a husky whisper. No wonder that, as in this state he tottered about, his <b>private</b> <b>servant</b> apprehensively followed him. Sometimes the negro gave his master his arm, or took his handkerchief out of his pocket for him; performing these and similar offices with that affectionate zeal which transmutes into something filial or fraternal acts in themselves but menial; and which has gained for the negro the repute of making the most pleasing body-servant in the world; one, too, whom a master need be on no stiffly superior terms with, but may treat with familiar trust; less a servant than a devoted companion.|$|E

Ishida Mitsunari (Jun Kaname), a high-ranking samurai under Lord Hideyoshi, tried to retrieve this box to destroy it, but Goemon escaped with it, leaving behind only his calling card: a red sticker with the Japanese character [...] "Go" [...] on it.

Searching around the slums for the box, Goemon heard a scream and finds Koheita and his mother, who had just been callously murdered by cruel and petty local samurai. Goemon saved Koheita and retrieved the box, but also took Koheita under his wing.|$|E

The photographs are of Vanderbilt University {{students of the}} late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and are almost all identified. John Fulton (1837 - 1932) was born a slave at the Hermitage, Andrew Jackson's estate, and died in Nashville, Tenn. In 1885 he came to Vanderbilt University to serve the IV Club, composed of four bachelor professors who kept house together in Wesley Hall [...] William L. Dudley, Austin H. Merrill, J. T.

Fulton collected photographs from the students and literally papered all four walls with the photographs; those that would not fit on the walls were stored in trunks. In 1914, after Dudley died, he became the caretaker for Mrs. R. F. Jackson. His duties kept him at her residence during the day, but at night he returned to his room in Wesley Hall, until there was a fire there in February 1932. Fulton died shortly after in April 1932...|$|E

40|$|One {{decade after}} the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and seven years since the Coalition {{government}} first rolled out a suite of public sector cuts it described as austerity measures, public sector cuts continue to devastate communities. The contributions gathered in this book collectively present evidence showing that people most affected by austerity cuts are not only struggling under the financial strain but are becoming ill, physically and emotionally, and many are dying. As well as pointing the finger at political leaders responsible for designing the policies that target marginal and vulnerable populations, we {{focus attention on the}} assemblage of bureaucracies and institutions through which austerity policies are made real. The various chapters identify the politicians, the public and <b>private</b> <b>servants</b> and the institutions responsible for the violence of austerity and set out, in no uncertain terms, to demonstrate how these people and organisations have harmed key marginal groups whose welfare they are ultimately responsible for. Before turning our attention to this task, this introduction will explore in detail what is meant by âausterityâ and how it has been used to legitimise a political process that we argue has comprehensively reshaped our relationship with government and the public sector...|$|R

This article presents historical census data that detail trans-formations of paid reproductive labor during the twentieth century. Changes in the orga-nization of cooking and cleaning tasks in the paid labor market have led to shifts in the demographics of workers engaged in these tasks. As the context for cleaning and cooking work shifted from the dominance of <b>private</b> household <b>servants</b> to include more institu-tional forms, the gender balance of this reproductive labor workforce has been trans-formed, while racial-ethnic hierarchies have remained entrenched.
