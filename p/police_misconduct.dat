5|$|A major {{aspect of}} civil liberties {{progress}} after World War II was the undoing centuries of racism in federal, state, and local governments an effort generally associated with the Civil Rights Movement. Several civil liberties organizations worked together for progress, including the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), the ACLU, and the American Jewish Congress. The NAACP took primary responsibility for Supreme Court cases (often led by lead NAACP attorney Thurgood Marshall), with the ACLU focusing on <b>police</b> <b>misconduct,</b> and supporting the NAACP with amicus briefs. The NAACP achieved a key victory in 1950 with the Henderson v. United States decision that ended segregation in interstate bus and rail transportation.|$|E
5|$|In Herring v. United States, , Ginsburg dissented to the Court's {{decision}} not to suppress evidence due to a police officer's failure to update a computer system. In contrast to Justice Roberts' emphasis on suppression {{as a means to}} deter <b>police</b> <b>misconduct,</b> Ginsburg took a more robust view on the use of suppression as a remedy for a violation of a defendant's Fourth Amendment rights. Ginsburg viewed suppression as a way to prevent the government from profiting from mistakes, and therefore as a remedy to preserve judicial integrity and respect civil rights. She also rejected Roberts' assertion that suppression would not deter mistakes, contending making police pay a high price for mistakes would encourage them to take greater care.|$|E

During the 1930s, the ACLU started to engage in work combating <b>police</b> <b>misconduct</b> and supporting Native American rights. Many of the ACLU's cases involved the defense of Communist party members and Jehovah's Witnesses. In 1940, the ACLU leadership voted to exclude Communists from its leadership positions, a decision rescinded in 1968. During World War II, the ACLU defended Japanese-American citizens, unsuccessfully trying to prevent their forcible relocation to internment camps. During the Cold War, the ACLU headquarters was dominated by anti-Communists, but many local affiliates defended members of the Communist Party.|$|E
