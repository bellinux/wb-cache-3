40|$|This paper {{shows that}} not every scan cell {{contributes}} equally to the <b>power</b> consumption during <b>scan</b> based test. The transitions at some scan cells cause more toggles at the internal signal lines of a circuit than the transitions at other scan cells.

A verilog based approach is proposed to identify a set of <b>power</b> sensitive <b>scan</b> cells. Additional hardware is added to freeze the outputs of <b>power</b> sensitive <b>scan</b> cells during scan shifting {{in order to reduce}} the shift power consumption. when multiple scan chain is incorporated along with freezing the <b>power</b> sensitive <b>scan</b> cell,over all <b>power</b> during testing can be reduced to a larger extend.

40|$|Abstract. During {{selective}} laser sintering process, different sintering parameters have great impact {{on the performance of}} the molded parts, and the degree of influence is different. Using orthogonal test, indirect sintered 316 L stainless steel, the compressive strength and precision of the parts were measured and compared to study the influence of various sintering parameters (laser <b>power,</b> <b>scanning</b> speed, scan spacing, preheating temperature) on sintering. The greater degree of influence factors were got by range analysis. The results show that laser <b>power,</b> <b>scanning</b> speed and scan spacing have greater degree of influence on the compressive strength of the parts, and the preheating temperature have less impact.

40|$|In this paper, Laser Sintering (LS) of 90 %W– 7 %Ni– 3 %Fe (wt. %) powders {{have been}} investigated, {{with the goal}} to {{understand}} the influence of final density by laser <b>power,</b> <b>scanning</b> speed, laser trace width, {{and the number of}} scanning passes. The results suggest that the laser <b>power</b> and <b>scanning</b> speed are the most important factors influencing density; the influence of trace width and number of scanning passes are not significant. With the increase of laser power and decrease of scanning speed, higher density can be achieved. The microstructure analysis indicated that the porosity changed from open porosity to closed porosity with higher laser energy input. Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX) analysis shows that during the sintering process, W was not melted but dissolved into the Ni–Fe matrix. Contact flattening and grain accommodation of W grains have been observed. It suggests that both rearrangement and solution-reprecipitation mechanisms are responsible for the densification. The sintered density with respect to laser <b>power</b> and <b>scanning</b> speed was modeled by continuum modeling theory and compared with experimental results...|$|R

At any time, only one scan chain is active during scan test. Therefore, both average power and peak power are reduced compared with conventional full scan test methodology. This paper also proposes a tabu search-based approach to minimize test application time. In this approach we handle the information during deterministic test efficiently. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach drastically reduces both average power and peak power dissipation at a little longer test application time on various benchmark circuits...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{challenges}} in tissue engineering is to fabricate scaffolds which can mimic the natural microenvironments of cells. In a cell niche, biophysical and mechanical cues are crucial factors influencing cell functions. Given the complexity of natural extracellular matrix (ECM) engineered ECMs providing controllable biophysical and mechanical cues are appealing both in enhancing the understanding of cell-matrix interaction and in controlling cell fates in vitro. The ultimate goal of our study {{is to establish a}} platform as an engineered ECM by fabricating customized solid protein microstructures from solution using two-photon photochemical crosslinking, a novel laser-based freeform fabrication technique. In this study, protein structures varying from submicron lines, 2 D micropatterns and microporous matrices, to 3 D micropillars were successfully fabricated, demonstrating freeform fabrication capability with two-photon photochemical crosslinking. Two-photon fluorescent imaging and scanning electron microscope (SEM) -based microstructural characterization revealed that <b>power,</b> <b>scan</b> speed, total exposure time and concentrations of protein (bovine serum albumin) and photosensitizer (rose Bengal) in the solution were crucial processing parameters in this fabrication technique. Quantitative imaging analysis showed that porosity of protein matrices was highly dependent on processing parameters including <b>power,</b> <b>scan</b> speed, number of cycles in time series scan and protein concentrations in the solution. An atomic force microscopy (AFM) -based step change nano-compression test was used to measure the reduced elastic modulus of 3 D viscoelastic protein micro-pillars fabricated, as a pilot study.

40|$|The 'stiffness' {{of thermal}} {{transport}} in ELMy H-modes [edge localized high-confinement modes] is examined {{in a series}} of carefully chosen JT- 60 U plasmas, and measured temperatures are compared with the predictions of several transport models. A heating <b>power</b> <b>scan</b> with constant T(subscript ''ped''), a scan of pedestal temperature, T(subscript ''ped''), with constant heating power, and an on-axis/off-axis heating comparison are presented. In the <b>power</b> <b>scan</b> a 45 % increase in heating (and a 12 % density rise) produces an approximately fixed core temperature profile in a group of five plasmas with the same pedestal temperature. With fixed heating power, we find that a 30 - 40 % increase in T(subscript ''ped'') is associated with similar increases in core temperature. Heating in the deep core is varied by employing different groups of neutral beams that deposit their power near the magnetic axis and farther from the axis. In these plasmas, on-axis heating produces slightly more peaked temperature profiles, although they have 60 % more heating power inside r = a/ 2. Transport models are tested by solving the power balance equations to predict temperatures, which are then compared to the measurements. Predictions of the RLWB and IFS/PPPL models generally agree with the measured temperatures outside r approximately 0. 3 a, but the multimode model uniformly predicts temperatures that are too high except in the central region. Tests based on these discharges are not able to discriminate between the transport models of varying stiffness, so we conclude that larger changes are needed in the P(subscript ''heat'') and T(subscript ''ped'') scans...|$|E

40|$|Test data decompressors {{targeting}} low <b>power</b> <b>scan</b> testing introduce {{significant amount}} of correlation in the test data and thus they tend to adversely affect the coverage of unmodeled defects.

In this paper we show that both these deficiencies can be efficiently tackled by a novel pseudorandom scheme and a novel encoding method. The proposed scheme can be combined with existing low power decompressors to increase unmodeled defect coverage and almost totally eliminate control data.
