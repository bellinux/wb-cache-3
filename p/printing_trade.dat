5|$|Founding {{publisher}} Alexander {{was born}} about 1830 {{and came to}} Oregon from Illinois as a pioneer in 1852. Alexander initially worked as a farmer, supplementing his income as a surveyor and local {{justice of the peace}} before learning the <b>printing</b> <b>trade</b> working for the town's earlier pro-Southern newspapers. Although his own venture as a publisher was short and unprofitable, Alexander unwittingly was the scion of a local newspaper dynasty in Oregon, with two of his sons later themselves publishing The Guard (following the tenure of several intermediate owners), while a grandson, George L. Alexander, would one day edit another Oregon paper, the Lebanon Express.|$|E
5|$|Marquis was the {{youngest}} of four children. His mother died before he was one year old. Although his father remarried soon after, Marquis was cared for by his maternal grandmother until he was four. He then joined his father and stepmother at their home in Roscoe, Missouri. Adonijah bought a half-share in the newspaper Osceola so that his son, Birney, Marquis' elder brother, could learn the <b>printing</b> <b>trade.</b> When he was old enough, Marquis did the same and could set type {{by the time he was}} thirteen. After leaving school in 1885, Marquis was sent, along with his sister Mollie, to the Weaubleau Christian Institute in Weaubleau, Missouri. He graduated in 1887.|$|E
5|$|Gerard Anthony Francis Conroy {{was born}} in Dublin to John (Jack) and Esther Conroy, {{and was one of}} ten siblings: Alphonsus (Ollie), Laurence (Lar), John (Donny), Rita, Peter, Michael, Vincent, Paul, and Marie. Christened as Gerard, he soon became known by the name Terry as he could not {{pronounce}} 'Gerard' as a young child. His mother held two jobs: as a factory worker and an office cleaner. The family lived in the suburb of Cabra, and had very limited finances. Being one of the younger children he was indulged, and took advantage of his lack of household chores to spend the majority of his time playing football in the street. However he was arrested by a plain-clothed policeman and sentenced to probation in Children's Court for playing football in the street. He later credited his ball control skills to the many years he spent playing football with large numbers of other children in the tight streets of Cabra. His father and brothers were in the <b>printing</b> <b>trade,</b> and his brother Ollie, a talented footballer, rejected the opportunity to turn professional at Wolverhampton Wanderers in 1950 in order to remain employed in Dublin as a machine minder and play football part-time in the League of Ireland. Three more of his brothers also played in the League of Ireland, and both Ollie and Michael played in the Shelbourne team that won the FAI Cup in 1960.|$|E

25|$|Although Bailey {{occasionally}} published {{books and}} pamphlets {{on her own}} during the early years, she chose to concentrate her shop's energies on book and job printing for others as she matured. The blank forms, almanacs, annual reports, booksellers' catalogs, broadsides, and chapbooks that she printed provided steady, plentiful business, reflecting mid-century developments in the <b>printing</b> <b>trade</b> in which larger and more specialized firms replaced the small family-run general printing shops of the earlier period.|$|E
25|$|The International Typographical Union (ITU) was a US {{trade union}} for the <b>printing</b> <b>trade</b> for {{newspapers}} and other media. It {{was founded on}} May 3, 1852 as the United States as the National Typographical Union, and {{changed its name to}} the International Typographical Union at its Albany, New York convention in 1869 after it began organizing members in Canada. The ITU {{was one of the first}} unions to admit female members, admitting women members such as Augusta Lewis, Mary Moore and Eva Howard in 1869.|$|E

25|$|By 1515, Hans and Ambrosius {{had moved}} as journeymen {{painters}} {{to the city}} of Basel, a centre of learning and the <b>printing</b> <b>trade.</b> There they were apprenticed to Hans Herbster, Basel's leading painter. The brothers found work in Basel as designers of woodcuts and metalcuts for printers. In 1515, the preacher and theologian Oswald Myconius invited them to add pen drawings to the margin of a copy of The Praise of Folly by the humanist scholar Desiderius Erasmus of Rotterdam. The sketches provide early evidence of Holbein's wit and humanistic leaning. His other early works, including the double portrait of Basel's mayor Jakob Meyer zum Hasen and his wife , follow his father's style.|$|E
25|$|After {{many years}} of {{involvement}} in literary, cultural and political clubs, Griffith and the other board members were all well known in Dublin's nationalist circles. They were also influential personalities {{in their own right}} in their respective social and professional fields. Griffith was not only a pillar of the Irish-Ireland movement but also, thanks, to his father's leadership role in the <b>printing</b> <b>trade</b> and his own very substantial experience in the newspaper industry, a respected figure in Dublin's printing and typographical community. Both Thomas Kelly and the fruit trader Walter Cole were popular Dublin Corporation aldermen; John O'Mahony was a hotel proprietor; Henry Dixon was a lawyer and influential IRB veteran; and Seumas McManus, the nationalist novelist, already had a flourishing reputation {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic. From April 1906 onwards, this group actively sought a return on this social investment from their friends, family, neighbours, colleagues, and former classmates.|$|E
500|$|Later, the {{settlement}} branched out and offered services to ameliorate {{some of the}} effects of poverty. A public dispensary provided nutritious food for the sick as well as a daycare center and public baths. Among the courses Hull House offered was a bookbinding course, which was timely â€” given the employment opportunities in the growing <b>printing</b> <b>trade.</b> Hull House was well known for its success in aiding American assimilation, especially with immigrant youth. Hull House became the center of the movement to promote hand workmanship as a moral regenerative force. Under the direction of Laura Dainty Pelham their theater group performed the Chicago premiers of several plays by John Galsworthy, Henrik Ibsen, and George Bernard Shaw, and was given credit for founding the American Little Theatre Movement. [...] The success of Hull House led Paul Kellogg to refer to the group as the [...] "Great Ladies of Halsted Street".|$|E

500|$|Despite {{evidence}} of considerable academic ability, Reed {{did not follow}} his brother Charles, who went on from the school to Trinity College, Cambridge. Instead, in 1869, Reed left the school to join the family firm, known as Sir Charles Reed & Sons or informally as the Fann Street Foundry, beginning a lifelong association with the <b>printing</b> <b>trade.</b> He found time, however, to pursue many other interests, physical, artistic and intellectual. Twice he walked the [...] from London to Cambridge, each time leaving on Friday afternoon and arriving at St John's College for breakfast on Saturday. Reed was a competent swimmer, and won a Royal Humane Society medal for saving a cousin from drowning in rough seas. He was an accomplished pianist, a skilful pen-and-ink illustrator, and had an engaging style of writing. These artistic talents were put to service {{in the production of}} a family magazine, The Earlsfield Chronicle, which Reed edited (and largely wrote) from the mid-1870s. The magazine circulated only among the extended Reed family, and included serious articles ("Is total abstinence a moral duty?") alongside comic verses and cartoons.|$|E
500|$|In 1563, Day {{undertook}} {{the work}} {{for which he is}} best known, John Foxe's Actes and Monuments (also called The Book of Martyrs). Day and Foxe probably met through Cecil, and the two became close collaborators. Foxe was among those who seized on the advances in the <b>printing</b> <b>trade</b> as a tool for the spread of the Protestant Reformation. There is a tradition that Foxe, who revised and added material while the book was being set in type, actually lived at Day's shop at Aldersgate during the production of the book; he certainly received correspondence there and visited regularly. [...] Day heavily invested time and money in the production of Foxe's book, the largest publishing project undertaken in England to that time, and he took an active part in the compilation of the material. Day used changes in type sizes or fonts to distinguish Foxe's editorial insertions from texts of his sources. The resulting lavish folio filled with woodcuts was an expensive luxury item, but it sold well and Day profited from his investment.|$|E

2500|$|Josiah wanted Ben {{to attend}} school with the clergy, but only had enough money {{to send him to}} school for two years. He {{attended}} Boston Latin School but did not graduate; he continued his education through voracious reading. Although [...] "his parents talked of the church as a career" [...] for Franklin, his schooling ended when he was ten. He worked for his father for a time, and at 12 he became an apprentice to his brother James, a printer, who taught Ben the <b>printing</b> <b>trade.</b> When Ben was 15, James founded The New-England Courant, which was the first truly independent newspaper in the colonies.|$|E
2500|$|At 38, with Mary Ann {{and eight}} children, he packed up {{his family and}} moved back to New York City, hoping to market his wood-block cutting machine there.

[...] However, {{not long after the}} machine was built, the steam boiler blew up at the shop, destroying the prototype. [...] Zieber persuaded Singer to make a new start in Boston, a center of the <b>printing</b> <b>trade.</b> Singer went to Boston in 1850 to display his invention at the machine shop of Orson C. Phelps. Orders for Singer's wood cutting machine were not, however, forthcoming.|$|E

2500|$|Finally, {{delegates from}} typographers' unions in 14 cities met in Cincinnati in May 1852 and {{organized}} the National Typographical Union.
