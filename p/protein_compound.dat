50|$|Human {{chromosome}} 5 {{contains two}} nearly identical genes at location 5q13: a telomeric copy SMN1 and a centromeric copy SMN2. In healthy individuals, the SMN1 gene codes {{the survival of}} motor neuron protein (SMN) which, as its name says, {{plays a crucial role}} in survival of motor neurons. The SMN2 gene, on the other hand - due to a variation in a single nucleotide (840.C→T) - undergoes alternative splicing at the junction of intron 6 to exon 8, with only 10-20% of SMN2 transcripts coding a fully functional survival of motor neuron protein (SMN-fl) and 80-90% of transcripts resulting in a truncated <b>protein</b> <b>compound</b> (SMNΔ7) which is rapidly degraded in the cell.|$|E
50|$|In Fig. 2 {{the general}} {{design of a}} vector (a genetic vehicle to {{transform}} a yeast strain into a genetically engineered protein producer). It must contain several genetic elements:1. A selection marker, required to select a transformed strain from an untransformed background -this can be done if for instance such an element enables a deficient strain to grow under culturing conditions void of a certain compound like a particular amino acid that cannot be produced by the deficient strain).2. Certain elements to propagate and to target the foreign DNA to the chromosome of the yeast (ARS and/or rDNA sequence).3. A segment responsible {{for the production of}} the desired <b>protein</b> <b>compound</b> a so-called expression cassette. Such a cassette is made up by a sequence of regulatory elements, a promoter that controls, how much and under which circumstances a following gene sequence is transcribed and as a consequence how much protein is eventually made. This means that the segment following the promoter is variable depending on the desired product - it could be a sequence determining the amino acids for insulin, for hepatitis B vaccine or for interferon. The expression cassette is terminated by a following terminator sequence that provides a proper stop of the transcription. The promoter elements of the O. polymorpha system are derived from genes that are highly expressed, from instance from the MOX gene, the FMD gene or the TPS1 gene mentioned before. They are not only very strong, but can also be regulated by certain addition of carbon sources like sugar, methanol or glycerol.

Previous studies showed that genetic deficiency of PLTP in mice causes a substantially impaired hepatic secretion of apolipoprotein-B (apoB), the major protein of atherogenic lipoproteins. To understand whether the impaired apoB secretion is a direct result from lack of PLTP activity, in this study, we further investigated the function of PLTP in apoB secretion by using PLTP inhibitors.

The net result is an apparent shift toward lower charge state as the collision energy in the free jet region is increased. In addition, the data suggest that a mixture of heavily clustered monomers and possibly dimers and multimers are present in the expansion from ion source into vacuum, and it is this mixture which is acted on by the declustering field to produce the observed mass spectrum.
