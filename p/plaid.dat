40|$|We {{investigate}} if {{adapting to}} colored <b>plaids</b> produces a McCollough effect on <b>plaids</b> or gratings and if adapting to colored gratings produces a McCollough effect on <b>plaids.</b> We {{find that the}} answer is unambiguously yes in all cases, though the strength of the effect differs significantly depending on the inducing and testing stimuli. Furthermore, we show that <b>plaids</b> and gratings can simultaneously support opposite color aftereffects, suggesting that <b>plaids</b> drive a population of cells that are not stimulated by the same component gratings in isolation...|$|R

5|$|Warfare {{in early}} modern Scotland {{includes}} {{all forms of}} military activity in Scotland or by Scottish forces, between the adoption of new ideas of the Renaissance in the early sixteenth century and the military defeat of the Jacobite movement in the mid-eighteenth century. In the late Middle Ages, Scottish armies were assembled {{on the basis of}} common service, feudal obligations and money contracts of bonds of manrent. In 1513 these systems produced a large and formidable force, but in the mid-sixteenth century there were difficulties in recruitment. Individuals were expected to provide their own equipment, including axes and pole arms. Highland troops often brought bows and two-handed swords. Heavy armour was abandoned after the Flodden campaign. Highland lords tended to continue to use lighter chainmail and ordinary highlanders dressed in the <b>plaid.</b> The crown took an increasing role in the supply of equipment. The pike replaced the spear and the Scots began to covert from the bow to gunpowder firearms. Feudal heavy cavalry were replaced with light horse, often drawn from the Borders. James IV established a gun foundry in 1511 and gunpowder weaponry fundamentally altered the nature of castle architecture. In the 1540s and 1550s, Scotland was given a defended border of earthwork forts and additions to existing castles.|$|E

In 1513 these systems were successful in producing a large and formidable force, but there is evidence that by the mid-sixteenth century the authorities were experiencing increasing difficulty in recruitment. Individuals were expected to provide their own equipment. Heavy armour was abandoned after the Flodden campaign and noblemen became indistinguishable from the majority of troops. Highland lords tended to continue to use lighter chainmail and ordinary highlanders dressed in the <b>plaid.</b> Weapons included various forms of axes and pole arms. Highland troops brought bows and two-handed swords (claidheamh mór). The crown took an increasing role in the supply of equipment. The pike began to replace the spear or axe and the bow began to be replaced by gunpowder firearms. The feudal heavy cavalry had begun to disappear from Scottish armies and the Scots fielded relatively large numbers of light horse, often drawn from the borders. James IV brought in experts from France, Germany and the Netherlands and established a gun foundry in 1511. Gunpowder weaponry fundamentally altered the nature of castle architecture from the mid-fifteenth century. In the period of French intervention in the 1540s and 1550s, Scotland was given a defended border of a series of earthwork forts and additions to existing castles.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} whether stereoscopic slant and inclination thresholds for surfaces {{defined by}} two component <b>plaids</b> could be predicted from the interocular {{differences in their}} individual component gratings. Thresholds were measured for binocular images defined by single sinusoidal gratings and two component <b>plaids.</b> In both cases thresholds showed a marked dependence on component orientation. For absolute component orientations greater than 45 deg we found that inclination thresholds were smaller than slant thresholds. However, for absolute component orientations less than 45 deg, we found a reversal: slant thresholds were smaller than inclination thresholds. We considered three models that might account for these data. One assumed that thresholds stemmed from interocular position differences of corresponding image points. The other two assumed a combination of position, orientation and/or spatial-frequency differences. The best fits were obtained from those models that explicitly represented orientation differences. From the model combining orientation and spatial-frequency differences, we estimated the relative cue sensitivity to be 1. 7 : 1, respectively. For <b>plaids,</b> we found that thresholds obtained from the individual components {{could be used to}} predict thresholds for <b>plaids,</b> even though an additional disparity cue from the contrast beat was available...|$|R

40|$|Low-level motion {{processing}} in the primate {{visual system}} involves two stages. The first stage (in V 1) contains specialised motion sensors which respond to local retinal motion, {{and the second}} stage (in MT) pools local signals to encode rigid surface motion.

We compared MIPS induced by single grating components (Gabor patches) to MIPS induced by <b>plaids</b> created by combining pairs of components. If motion signals at the lowest level of motion analysis (V 1) influence position assignment, MIPS from <b>plaids</b> should reflect the position shift induced by each component when presented separately.

40|$|AbstractMissing-fundamental gratings, {{generated}} by subtracting the fundamental Fourier components from square-wave gratings, appear to move backward when presented in quarter-cycle jumps, {{even though their}} edges and features all move forward. We used variants of these stimuli to test current models of motion perception. We found that missing-fundamental <b>plaids,</b> constructed from orthogonal missing-fundamental gratings, also appear to move backward. Forward motion was restored to missing-fundamental gratings and <b>plaids</b> by adding back small fractions of the original fundamental. In-phase and antiphase addition of the fundamental had similar effects on the perceived motion, despite having markedly different effects on the features, appearances and zero-crossings of the stimuli. The critical amplitude of fundamental needed to restore forward motion to <b>plaids</b> {{was the same as}} that needed to restore forward motion to their isolated component gratings, indicating that the plaids’ emergent features, such as edge intersections and ‘blobs’, made little or no contribution to the perceived direction of motion in these stimuli. In two derivative experiments, missing-fundamental chromatic gratings and <b>plaids,</b> at approximate isoluminance, and missing-fundamental luminance barberpoles, also generated backward perceived motions, and these were also reversed by in-phase or antiphase addition of small amounts of fundamental...|$|R
