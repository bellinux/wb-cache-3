5|$|During his 30-year senate career, Specter {{staked out}} {{a spot in}} the <b>political</b> <b>center.</b> In 2006, he was {{selected}} by Time as one of America's Ten Best Senators. Specter lost his reelection bid in 2010 to Joe Sestak in the primary election, who then lost to Pat Toomey in the general election. Toomey succeeded Specter on January 3, 2011.|$|E
5|$|In 1835, Mexico {{operated}} {{two major}} garrisons within its Texas territory, the Alamo at San Antonio de Béxar and Presidio La Bahía near Goliad. Béxar was the <b>political</b> <b>center</b> of Texas, and Goliad laid halfway {{between it and}} the major Texas port of Copano. Military and civilian supplies and military personnel were usually sent by sea from the Mexican interior to Copano Bay and then could be transported overland to the Texas settlements.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{important}} shift was a religious one: Thebes effectively became the religious {{as well as the}} <b>political</b> <b>center</b> of the country, its local god Amun credited with inspiring Ahmose in his victories over the Hyksos. The importance of the temple complex at Karnak (on the east bank of the Nile north of Thebes) grew and the importance of the previous cult of Ra based in Heliopolis diminished.|$|E

5|$|The Abbasids were {{followed}} by the Saffarids. Zoroastrians lived {{under the leadership of}} their High Priest, since they had no king. In Iraq, the <b>political</b> <b>center</b> of the Sassanian state, Zoroastrian institutions were viewed as appendages of the royal government and family, and suffered much destruction and confiscation. Closely associated with the power structures of the Persian Empire, Zoroastrian clergy quickly declined after it was deprived of the state support.|$|E
5|$|The Forbidden City is {{a palace}} complex in central Beijing, China. The former seat of Imperial Chinese Dragon Throne from the Ming dynasty {{to the end}} of the Qing dynasty—the years 1420 to 1912, it now houses the Palace Museum. The Forbidden City served as the home of {{emperors}} and their households as well as the ceremonial and <b>political</b> <b>center</b> of Chinese government for almost 500 years.|$|E
5|$|Dennis Pennington, {{who lived}} near Lanesville, {{became one of}} the county's early leading {{citizens}} and speaker of the territory's legislature. Corydon began competing with other southern Indiana settlements to become the new capital of the territory after its reorganization in 1809. Hostilities broke out in 1811 with the Native American tribes on the frontier, and the territorial capital was moved to Corydon on May1, 1813, after Pennington suggested it would be safer than Vincennes. For the next twelve years, Corydon was the <b>political</b> <b>center</b> of the territory and subsequent state. A state constitution was drafted in Corydon during June 1816 and after statehood the town served as the state capital until 1825.|$|E
50|$|The sect can {{be traced}} back to the Yuan dynasty (1271-1368). It has been {{associated}} to the White Lotus tradition, a rebellious sect of that time, especially by anti-sect <b>political</b> <b>centers</b> and religious antagonists.|$|R

5|$|Tamil is {{the widely}} spoken language, with the {{standard}} dialect being Central Tamil dialect. Telugu, Thanjavur Marathi and Saurashtra are other languages spoken in the city. Thanjavur is the cultural and <b>political</b> <b>center</b> of the Thanjavur Marathi people. While Hindus form the majority, the city also has a substantial population of Muslims and Christians. Roman Catholics in Thanjavur are affiliated to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Tanjore and Protestants are affiliated to the Trichy–Tanjore Diocese of the Church of South India. The workforce is predominantly involved in service industry involving trade and commerce. With {{the expansion of the}} city area, the opportunities for agriculture is limited and only 7% of the population is involved in it.|$|E
5|$|The second kingdom {{appears to}} be a {{powerful}} and prosperous <b>political</b> <b>center,</b> kings held the title of Lugal, and many are attested in the city, but the most important source is the letter of king Enna-Dagan c. 2350 BC, which was sent to Irkab-Damu of Ebla, and in it, the Mariote king mentions his predecessors and their military achievements. However, the reading of this letter is still problematic and many interpretations have been presented by scholars.|$|E
5|$|West Utica (or the West Side) was {{historically}} home to German, Irish and Polish immigrants. The Corn Hill {{neighborhood in}} the city center had a significant Jewish population. East Utica (or the East Side) is a cultural and <b>political</b> <b>center</b> dominated by Italian immigrants. North of downtown is the Triangle neighborhood, home to the city's African American and Jewish populations. Neighborhoods formerly dominated {{by one or more}} groups saw other groups arrive, such as Bosnians and Latin Americans in former Italian neighborhoods and the Welsh in Corn Hill. Bagg Commemorative Park and Bagg's Square West (Utica's historic centers) are in the northeastern portion of downtown, with Genesee Street on the west and Oriskany Street on the south.|$|E

25|$|For a {{brief period}} in the 16th-17th centuries, Japanese {{overseas}} activity and presence in Southeast Asia {{and elsewhere in the}} region boomed. Sizeable Japanese communities, known as Nihonmachi, could be found in many of the major ports and <b>political</b> <b>centers</b> of the region, where they exerted significant political and economic influence.|$|R
50|$|Oral traditions gives {{at least}} {{glimpses of the}} proud history of Vangteh as {{being one of the}} once <b>political</b> <b>centers</b> of the ruling Guite or Nwite (Vuite, Nguite {{pronunciation}} in Vangteh, Gwete, Gwite) family in the region,that its sovereignty in the region was lasted {{for more than half a}} millennium (c.

5|$|After Alexander's {{death in}} 323BC, the ensuing {{wars of the}} Diadochi, and the {{partitioning}} of Alexander's short-lived empire, Macedonia remained a Greek cultural and <b>political</b> <b>center</b> in the Mediterranean region along with Ptolemaic Egypt, the Seleucid Empire, and the Kingdom of Pergamon. Important cities such as Pella, Pydna, and Amphipolis were involved in power struggles {{for control of the}} territory. New cities were founded, such as Thessalonica by the usurper Cassander (named after his wife Thessalonike of Macedon). Macedonia's decline began with the Macedonian Wars and the rise of Rome as the leading Mediterranean power. At the end of the Third Macedonian War in 168BC, the Macedonian monarchy was abolished and replaced by Roman client states. A short-lived revival of the monarchy during the Fourth Macedonian War in 150–148BC ended with the establishment of the Roman province of Macedonia.|$|E
5|$|China's newly commercialized {{society was}} evident in the {{differences}} between its northern capital and the earlier Tang capital at Chang'an. A center of great wealth, Chang'an's importance as the <b>political</b> <b>center</b> eclipsed its importance as a commercial entrepôt; Yangzhou was the economic hub of China during the Tang period. On the other hand, Kaifeng's role as a commercial center in China was as important as its political role. After the curfew was abolished in 1063, marketplaces in Kaifeng were open every hour of the day, whereas a strict curfew was imposed upon the two official marketplaces of Tang era Chang'an starting at dusk; this curfew limited its commercial potential. Shopkeepers and peddlers in Kaifeng began selling their goods at dawn. Along the wide avenue of the Imperial Way, breakfast delicacies were sold in shops and stalls and peddlers offered hot water for washing the face at the entrances of bathhouses. Lively activity in the markets did not begin to wane until about the evening meal of the day, while noodle shops remained open all day and night. People in the Song era were also more eager to purchase houses located near bustling markets than in earlier periods. Kaifeng's wealthy, multi-story houses and common urban dwellings were situated along the streets of the city, rather than hidden inside walled compounds and gated wards as they had been in the earlier Tang capital.|$|E
5|$|Although Chang'an was {{the capital}} of the earlier Han and Jin dynasties, after {{subsequent}} destruction in warfare, it was the Sui dynasty model that comprised the Tang era capital. The roughly square dimensions of the city had six miles (10km) of outer walls running east to west, and more than five miles (8km) of outer walls running north to south. The royal palace, the Taiji Palace, stood north of the city's central axis. From the large Mingde Gates located mid-center of the main southern wall, a wide city avenue stretched from there all the way north to the central administrative city, behind which was the Chentian Gate of the royal palace, or Imperial City. Intersecting this were fourteen main streets running east to west, while eleven main streets ran north to south. These main intersecting roads formed 108 rectangular wards with walls and four gates each, and each ward filled with multiple city blocks. The city was made famous for this checkerboard pattern of main roads with walled and gated districts, its layout even mentioned in one of Du Fu's poems. During the Heian period, the city of Heian kyō (present-day Kyoto) of Japan like many cities was arranged in the checkerboard street grid pattern of the Tang capital and in accordance with traditional geomancy following the model of Chang'an. Of these 108 wards in Chang'an, two of them (each the size of two regular city wards) were designated as government-supervised markets, and other space reserved for temples, gardens, ponds, etc. Throughout the entire city, there were 111 Buddhist monasteries, 41 Daoist abbeys, 38 family shrines, 2 official temples, 7 churches of foreign religions, 10 city wards with provincial transmission offices, 12 major inns, and 6 graveyards. Some city wards were literally filled with open public playing fields or the backyards of lavish mansions for playing horse polo and cuju football. In 662, Emperor Gaozong moved the imperial court to the Daming Palace, which became the <b>political</b> <b>center</b> of the empire and served as the royal residence of the Tang emperors for more than 220 years.|$|E

50|$|Gazikumukh Shamkhalate was a Lak {{state that}} existed on the {{territory}} of present-day Dagestan {{in the period of}} the 8th to 17th centuries.

In the 15th century other <b>political</b> <b>centers</b> of shamkhalate were Bujnak, Tarki, Andirey and some other towns.|$|R
50|$|The {{wide and}} fertile village of Vikøyri was {{established}} in ancient times. The area must have stood out early as {{a good place to}} settle.

Vik is such an area.|$|R

25|$|Archaeological {{investigations}} {{conducted over}} the previous two decades (e.g., by Kent Flannery and Joyce Marcus) have built an emerging picture of San José Mogote as an early center of Zapotec culture, which was later supplanted or overtaken by Monte Albán. From its beginnings as a cluster of family dwellings San José Mogote grew to incorporate monumental public structures indicative of a larger and complex <b>political</b> <b>center</b> that ruled {{over a number of}} subsidiary settlements in the Valley of Oaxaca, receiving tribute and services from the region. For as-yet unclear reasons, its status diminished and it became a tributary to the new Zapotec <b>political</b> <b>center</b> and capital, Monte Albán.|$|E

50|$|The Capuchins {{generally}} {{had three}} or four missionaries {{in the whole of}} Kongo, occasionally they had as many as ten, never enough to truly take over the instruction of the people or educate more than an elite of political actors and their own staff. The Capuchins generally constructed hospices near <b>political</b> <b>centers,</b> such as São Salvador, Mbamba, and Soyo or in territory relatively far from the <b>political</b> <b>centers</b> such as the hospice at Nsuku in the north of the country. There they and their staff of freed slaves (nleke) who carried them on their annual rounds of the countryside. While travelling they stopped at centrally located villages for a few days while people from neighboring settlements came in, and then they performed the sacraments, especially baptism, to thousands. It was not uncommon for a long serving missionary to record tens of thousands of baptisms in their reports, and many fewer marriages and communions.|$|R

25|$|Garry South, Steve Westly's {{campaign}} manager, stated Angelides' {{attacks on}} Schwarzenegger {{came across as}} boastful and partisan to the electorate.

50|$|A more {{centralized}} way of ruling did evolve {{during this}} time, but only slowly and gradually.
