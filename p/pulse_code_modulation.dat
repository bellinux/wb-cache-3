40|$|Image {{and audio}} data are {{examples}} of domains in which DPCM (Differential <b>Pulse</b> <b>Coded</b> <b>Modulation)</b> is an effective method for removing much of the linear correlation between data samples. However, most simple DPCM schemes cannot simultaneously cater for smooth signals, noisy signals, and discontinuities such as edges in images. To overcome this, many adaptive DPCM schemes have been proposed, including median predictors, gradient-based switching predictors and gradient-based blending predictors. In this paper we generalize the idea of blending predictors, and describe a powerful technique for creating locally adaptive compound predictors. The result is a prediction scheme which works well over a range of data types froms smooth to noisy, and requires very few tunable parameters. We apply this scheme to greyscale image data, colour image data, and audio data, and compare results {{with some of the}} current best adaptive DPCM predictors. 1 Introduction Image and audio data {{are examples of}} dom [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} the {{investigation}} of an 8 -band sub-band coder with dynamic bit allocation at the rate of 16 Kbits/sec is presented. The band-partitioning technique adopted is the Quadrature Mirror Filtering (QMF) method and particular attention is paid to the problems involved with the use of such filters in a sub-band coder. The sub-band signals are quantized using Adaptive <b>Pulse</b> <b>Coded</b> <b>Modulation</b> (APCM) quantizers. The number of quantization levels assigned to the sub-bands is revised regularly to adapt the coder to the changes in time of the spectral properties of speech. A simple algorithm is developed for the optimal (in the mean square error sense) assignment of the bite to the sub-bands based on the relative magnitudes of the sub-band energies. The computer simulation of the coder produces fully intelligible speech of reasonably good quality. This study includes a discussion of the simulation of the coder as well as suggestions for improvements based on perceptual criteria.

A practical image coder is designed based on this approach. Two dimensional DPCM is used along with decimation and interpolation {{to reduce the number of}} transmitted samples. The decimation rate depends on the signal spectrum and the bit rate. Further bit rate reduction is achieved through adaptive entropy coding. Wiener filter is appended in the decoder for minimizing distortion caused by quantization noise. The decimation filter can be implemented using simple IIR filters. The necessary side information is low. Simulation results show that the coder is able to give good compression performance at low bit rates which is superior to conventional DPCM codec and JPEG. Subjective quality can be as good as JPEG 2000. While at very low bit rates the proposed codec is able to retain certain image characteristics better than JPEG 2000. 1...|$|R

ABTC {{is one of}} extended schemes of the original block truncation coding (BTC), but it introduces a new classifi-cation approach for adaptive <b>coding</b> and differential <b>pulse</b> <b>coding</b> <b>modulation</b> (DPCM).

One is the sample first absolute central moment (AM), which denotes the dispersion from the mean value in a 4 x 4 pixel block; another is the mean of absolute errors (MAE) between the original pixel values and their decoded data in every block image, which is computed with the simplified absolute moment block truncation coding (SAMBTC). In order to achieve a better trade-off between the image quality and computational complexity, different coding approaches are employed to compress/decompress three sorts of block images.

40|$|With the {{advancement}} of computer graphics in the recent years, {{an increasing number of}} pictures, video and 3 D content is generated by synthesis processing rather than acquired with capture devices such as cameras or scanners. Several techniques have been developed for compression of discrete (i. e. piece-wise planar) 3 D models, in the form of 3 D polygonal meshes. However, no important attempt has been made to compress the smooth surfaces of artificially generated 3 D models, that are most often represented as parametric surfaces, of which Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS) is a popular form. This paper presents a method for compressing NURBS 3 D models with a small and controllable loss. The scheme uses a differential <b>pulse</b> <b>coded</b> <b>modulation</b> (DPCM) coder with different predictors for knot values and control points, coupled with a uniform scalar quantizer, followed by a bitplane arithmetic entropy coder.
