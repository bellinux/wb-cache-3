25|$|From 2015, Irish Water became {{responsible}} for providing water and wastewater services, with the intention that the company would be funded through direct billing. The new company was set up as a subsidiary of an existing semi-state corporation, Bord Gáis (Ervia). The newly created company took on the existing local authority employees and water management facilities, pipes and infrastructure. While Irish Water initially issued bills and was funded through payment from residential users, by 2017 the scale of protest and <b>push-back</b> against charges resulted in the suspension and ultimately scrapping of the funding model.|$|E
25|$|With {{the role}} recast, and the script {{restructured}} accordingly, filming resumed in Vancouver on 24 February 2008, {{a month later}} than originally planned; this <b>push-back</b> in filming also required another film produced by Samuel Hadida, an adaptation of the video game Onimusha, to be delayed indefinitely. Exteriors required for the film's ending, featuring Christopher Plummer and Verne Troyer, were shot during this time; the location work also required the presence of Tom Waits (on the first day) and Lily Cole (on the second). All of Plummer's scenes, including exterior flashbacks shown {{early on in the}} film, had to be filmed first in the Vancouver schedule, within three weeks, as he was due to leave to begin filming on The Last Station, which was to start production in Germany on 7 April.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the {{beginning}} of the twentieth century and prior to the revolution, many women leaders emerged and demanded basic social rights for women. During the reign of Reza Shah, the government mandated the removal of the veil and promoted the education of young girls. However, the <b>push-back</b> of the Shii clerics made progress difficult, and the government had to contain its promotion of basic women's rights to the norms of the patriarchal social hierarchy in order to accommodate the clergy. After the abdication of Reza Shah in 1941, the discipline of the government decreased, and women were able to further exercise their rights, including the ability to wear the veil if they wanted. More organization of women's groups occurred in the 1960s and 70s, and they used the government’s modernization to define and advocate for women’s issues. During these decades, women became active in formerly male domains such as the parliament, the cabinet, armed forces, legal professions, and fields of science and technology. Additionally, women achieved the right to vote in 1963. Many of these achievements and rights that Iranian women had gained in the decades leading up to the revolution were reversed by the Islamic Revolution.|$|E

2500|$|In 1954 {{the look}} of the theater was modernized once again with the removal of parapets, cornices, and windows. [...] The marquee was {{replaced}} with a new porcelain one.

2500|$|Even {{though the}} {{movement}} behind inserting [...] "under God" [...] into the pledge {{might have been}} initiated by a private religious fraternity and even though references to God appear in previous versions of the pledge, author Kevin Kruse asserts that this movement was an effort by corporate America to instill {{in the minds of}} the people that capitalism and free enterprise were heavenly blessed. Kruse acknowledges the insertion of the phrase was influenced by the <b>push-back</b> against atheistic communism during the Cold War, but argues the longer arc of history shows the conflation of Christianity and capitalism as a challenge to the New Deal played the larger role.|$|E

2500|$|In 2002 the {{leadership}} of the ICEL was changed, under insistence from the Roman Congregation for Divine Worship and to obtain a translation that was {{as close as possible to}} the wording of the Latin original.

2500|$|The {{passenger}} terminal, at {{the western}} end, was closed down and a new temporary terminal was converted from the old RAF buildings, {{in preparation for the}} start of the rebuild. Check-in was in a converted hangar and adopted the now familiar layout. The main difference from today was that not just the luggage was weighed. All passengers too, were required to stand on the big Avery scales, and were charged accordingly. The departure lounge, known as the Traffic Hall, was converted from one of the big brick [...] "H" [...] blocks. Along with comfortable seating, the lounge contained a long bar, backed by a full length, brightly coloured, three-dimensional collage. On a table, in the centre of the hall, was a large display case containing an architect's model of how the new airport would look. The modernity was even taken into the toilets, which had the first warm-air hand driers. Outside, the remainder of the ex RAF buildings became the Freight Village. A new but smaller viewing enclosure was allocated adjacent to the west end of the new terminal. No cafe, no toilets, just a bare rectangle of concrete. The chain link fence was usually lined with bicycles, which were regularly blown over when the BEA and Dan-Air DC3 Dakotas opened up both engines before turning right and taxiing out. No <b>push-back</b> then. No steerable nose wheels either. Just full power and hard right rudder.|$|E

40|$|This article takes Italy’s widely-debated 2009 <b>push-backs</b> to Libya {{campaign}} {{as a point}} of reference to address whether bilateral agreements for technical and police cooperation provide the legal foundation for the forced return of intercepted refugees to countries of embarkation. Through a detailed analysis of both the facts and the texts of the published and unpublished bilateral accords, it concludes that, although <b>push-backs</b> do not have a clear legal basis, the agreements between Italy and Libya constitute a fundamental component of the multifaceted legal and political framework underpinning Italy’s practice of interdiction and return. Moreover, by entrusting a non-EU third country with the authority and legal competence for the maritime operations, bilateral agreements for migration control may distance the responsibility (for international wrongful acts) of the outsourcing state. Migrants and refugees are autonomously intercepted by the third country in international waters, or in its coastal waters, before their arrival at the EU’s gateways. By venturing into the labyrinth of state responsibility in general international law, this article considers Italy’s possible liability for ‘aiding and assisting’ Libya, in a variety of ways, in the unlawful containment of irregular migration by sea and the resulting refoulement of intercepted refugees...|$|R

40|$|The {{practice}} of ‘push-backs’ in the Mediterranean Sea, in which vessels carrying migrants are intercepted {{and forced to}} return to the State from which they departed (or from which they are presumed to have departed) raises serious issues from the perspective of international human rights law. In the wake of the spate of recent tragedies, in which innocent women, children and men attempting to traverse the Mediterranean in order to reach European shores have lost their lives, States and European institutions are finally responding to these issues. The present piece explores the legality of the {{practice of}} <b>push-backs</b> under international human rights standards, particularly the European Convention on Human Rights, and offers an assessment of the ongoing developments within the European Union. The piece offers a preliminary assessment of the Draft Regulation relating to joint migration control operations at sea under the auspices of Frontex which aims belatedly to ensure that migration control operations incorporate an element of protection of human life and other fundamental human rights...|$|R
