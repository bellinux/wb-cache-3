5|$|Lasker {{followed}} Steinitz's <b>principles,</b> <b>and</b> both {{demonstrated a}} completely different chess paradigm than the “romantic” mentality before them. Thanks to Steinitz and Lasker, positional players gradually became common (Tarrasch, Schlechter, and Rubinstein stand out.) But, while Steinitz created a new school of chess thought, Lasker’s talents were far harder for the masses to grasp; hence there was no Lasker school.|$|E

40|$|Let X be a {{homogeneous}} {{space of a}} quasi-trivial k-group G, with geometric stabilizer H, over a number field k. We prove that under certain conditions on the character group of H, certain algebraic Brauer-Manin obstructions to the Hasse <b>principle</b> <b>and</b> weak approximation vanish, because the abelian groups where they take values vanish. When H is connected or abelian, these algebraic Brauer-Manin obstructions to the Hasse <b>principle</b> <b>and</b> weak approximation are the only ones, so we prove the Hasse <b>principle</b> <b>and</b> weak approximation for X under certain conditions. As an application, we obtain new sufficient conditions for the Hasse <b>principle</b> <b>and</b> weak approximation for linear algebraic groups. Comment: 12 pages.

5|$|Conscience is an aptitude, faculty, intuition or {{judgment}} that assists in distinguishing right from wrong. Moral judgment may derive from values or norms (<b>principles</b> <b>and</b> rules).

The extent to which conscience informs moral judgment before an action and whether such moral judgments are or should be based in reason has occasioned debate through much of the history of Western philosophy.|$|E
