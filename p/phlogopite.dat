5|$|The {{sapphire}} bearing Yogo dike is a {{dark gray}} to green intrusive rock known as a lamprophyre. The lamprophyre is an unusual igneous rock that contains a low content of silica. The rock has a porphyritic texture with large crystals of orthopyroxene and <b>phlogopite</b> set in a fine grained matrix. The <b>phlogopite</b> crystals {{have been used to}} determine the age of the dike and its crystallization temperature (900°C (1,650°F)). The dike also contains fragments of other rock types. These xenoliths include pieces of limestone, clastic sedimentary rocks, and gneiss. In some locations, due to the abundance of xenoliths, the dike has the appearance of a limestone breccia in an igneous matrix. One gneiss fragment found as a xenolith contains corundum. The Yogo sapphires themselves are rimmed with a reaction layer of spinel and are etched, indicating that the sapphires were not in chemical equilibrium with their host, the lamprophyre magma. This suggests the sapphire crystals may have originated in an earlier rock, such as a corundum-bearing gneiss, later assimilated by the lamprophyre magma at depth. Earlier investigators had assumed that the sapphire had crystallized from the magma with the necessary high aluminium content provided by assimilation of clay rich shales of the Proterozoic Belt Supergroup sediments which are known to be present at depth in the region.|$|E

Based on optical and electron microscope investigations, as well as crystal chemical and structural data, the micas selected for this study were divided into two groups, the first one encompassing brownish, Fe-rich crystals (type-A <b>phlogopites,</b> hereafter referred as t-A) with 0. 68 < Mg/(Mg+Fetotal) < 0. 85 and 0. 062 < Tiapfu < 0. 199, and the other one encompassing colorless, Mg-rich crystals (type-B <b>phlogopites,</b> hereafter referred as t-B) with Mg/(Mg+Fetotal) in excess of 0. 85 and 0. 007 < Tiapfu < 0. 052. t-A <b>phlogopites</b> also show a tetrahedral ring cavity, overlapped tetrahedral hexagon area, and basal tetrahedron area greater than in the t-B <b>phlogopites.</b> From a petrological point of view, the textural and chemical variations of t-A <b>phlogopites</b> are compatible with fractional crystallization processes taking place within the magma chamber. t-B <b>phlogopites</b> show evidence of a Ti-oxy substitution mechanism, thus suggesting high fO 2 conditions.

However, in 1963 the US stopped purchasing mica, resulting in the closure of several mines and the production being cut by 2/3rds.

40|$|The {{effects of}} planar defects and {{composition}} on Ar mobility in trioctahedral micas {{have been investigated}} in samples from a small marble outcrop (~ 500 m²) in the Frontenac Terrane, Grenville Province, Ontario. These micas crystallized during amphibolite-facies metamorphism at ~ 1170 Ma and experienced a thermal pulse ~ 100 Ma later at shallow crustal levels associated with the emplacement of plutons. ⁸⁷Rb/⁸⁶Sr ages of the <b>phlogopites</b> range from ~ 950 to ~ 1050 Ma, consistent with resetting during the later thermal event. The same <b>phlogopites</b> however, give ⁴⁰Ar/³⁹Ar ages between ~ 950 and 1160 Ma, spanning the age range of the two thermal events. This result is intriguing because these micas have undergone the same thermal history and were not deformed after peak metamorphic conditions. In order to understand this phenomenon, the chemical, crystallographical, and microstructural nature of four mica samples has been characterized in detail using {{a wide range of}} analytical techniques. The scanning electron microscope (SEM), electron microprobe (EMP), and laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) data show that the micas are chemically homogeneous (with the exception of Ba) and similar in composition. The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and Mossbauer results show that the M sites for three of the micas are dominated by divalent cations and the Fe³⁺/(Fe²⁺+Fe³⁺) ratio for all four <b>phlogopites</b> ranges from 0. 10 to 0. 25. The stable-isotopic data for calcite indicate that this outcrop was not affected by hydrothermal fluids after peak metamorphism. No correlation between chemical composition and ⁸⁷Rb/⁸⁶Sr and ⁴⁰Ar/³⁹Ar age or between crystal size and ⁴⁰Ar/³⁹Ar age is observed. The only major difference among all of the micas was revealed through transmitted electron microscope (TEM), which shows that the older 1 M micas contain significantly more layer stacking defects, associated with crystallization, than the younger micas. We propose that these defect structures, which are enclosed entirely within the mineral grain may serve as Ar traps and effectively increase the Ar retentivity of the mineral. As this phenomenon has not been previously documented in micas, this may have significant implications for the interpretation of ⁴⁰Ar/³⁹Ar ages of minerals which have similar defect structures. 13 page(s...|$|R

2500|$|Minerals are {{classified}} by variety, species, series and group, {{in order of}} increasing generality. The basic level of definition is that of mineral species, {{each of which is}} distinguished from the others by unique chemical and physical properties. For example, quartz is defined by its formula, SiO2, and a specific crystalline structure that distinguishes it from other minerals with the same chemical formula (termed polymorphs). When there exists a range of composition between two minerals species, a mineral series is defined. For example, the biotite series is represented by variable amounts of the endmembers <b>phlogopite,</b> siderophyllite, annite, and eastonite. In contrast, a mineral group is a grouping of mineral species with some common chemical properties that share a crystal structure. The pyroxene group has a common [...] formula of XY(Si,Al)2O6, where X and Y are both cations, with X typically bigger than Y; the pyroxenes are single-chain silicates that crystallize in either the orthorhombic or monoclinic crystal systems.

An example is amethyst, which is a purple variety of quartz.|$|E

40|$|The {{exhumation}} of the Norwegian Lofoten eclogites, formed {{during the}} continental collision of Laurentia and Baltica, is mainly {{due to the}} reactivation of shear zones during {{the collapse of the}} Caledonian orogen. The current cooling history [temperature-time (T–t) paths] for the exhumation of these rocks as determined by ⁴⁰Ar/³⁹Ar dating and geothermometry involves a protracted period of slow cooling (c. - 1. 7 ℃ Ma⁻¹) from high T. The Sommartuva shear zone, hosted in a Palaeoproterozoic anorthosite, contains retrogressed eclogite and amphibolite-facies lenses and served as an open system for Ar with ⁴⁰Ar-rich and ⁴⁰Ar-poor hot fluid infiltration. Ca-rich amphiboles from amphibolites contain excess Ar and are mantled by <b>phlogopites</b> that yield Ar-diffusion loss profiles with plateau ages of 413 - 400 Ma associated with an extensional event in Lofoten. Locally, the zone was intruded in its late-stage history (c. 333 Ma) by a granitoid rock crystallizing annite and muscovite, previously inferred to be injected synchronously with amphibolite-facies metamorphism. An alternative cooling path related to the exhumation of the eclogites was determined by a combination of i) ⁴⁰Ar/³⁹Ar ages in minerals that grew during different thermal events, ii) thermal modelling of the Ar systematics in these minerals and iii) exploration of the thermal effects caused by the superposition of each event on pre-existing mineral phases. The best-fit T–t path as constrained by the Ar data reveals that, in order to preserve Ar (radiogenic and excess) within the minerals, the ambient T must have been relatively low (≤ 300 ℃) over 80 Ma (413 - 333 Ma). Likewise, the associated intrusion of the granitoid and the hot fluid that percolated the shear zone and crystallized the <b>phlogopites</b> were likely to have been short-lived (c. 100 - 25 ka) and at relatively moderate T (500 ℃). In contrast to previous thermal models where the thermal events are represented as simple inflexions in a T–t curve, our cold-crust model incorporates short-lived thermal disturbances (including estimates of the magnitude of their maximum temperature and duration) superimposed on protracted periods of slow cooling from high T. A new proposed T–t path obtained for the exhumation of this terrane indicates that the eclogites resided for 80 Ma (413 - 333 Ma) at relatively cool ambient temperatures (c. 300 ℃), highlighting the enormous potential of coupling geochronological data from multiple isotopic systems with thermal modelling to identify and constrain the duration of short-lived events. 19 page(s...|$|R
