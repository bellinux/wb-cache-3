40|$|Single-story precast {{structures}} {{with the}} <b>pinned</b> <b>connections</b> between the columns and the beams have been frequently used in Europe. However, a similar structural solution {{has been extended}} to the multi-storey buildings. The aim {{of this research was}} to assess the seismic safety of multi-storey precast structures with <b>pinned</b> <b>connections.</b> On the basis of the experiments performed in the framework of the SAFECAST project, a numerical model for both the columns and the connections was calibrated. Using the calibrated models seismic risk was evaluated for the whole set of the regular multi-storey structures which are usually built in practice. The observed differences in the probability of exceeding the limit state as well as the parameters contributing to seismic safety were discussed. In buildings with masses corresponding to the normalized axial force in columns above approximately 0. 15, seismic risk increased substantially due to the possibility of the failure of standard <b>pinned</b> <b>connections...</b>|$|R
40|$|Aluminium truss girders {{are widely}} used in the {{entertainment}} industry. The loads on these girders, representing systems for sound and lighting, are standardised in uniform loads and/or concentrated loads. Focusing on larger spans, standard connections, i. e. welded joints between chords and braces and mechanical fasteners between girder sections, may limit the design strength of these girders. In this publication the experimental research on <b>pinned</b> girder section <b>connections,</b> which allow for an easy assembly and disassembly of the truss girders, is described and discussed. The experiments {{have been carried out}} using two different boundary conditions as well as two different securing methods. The results show a design strength which is not limited by the shear and bearing mechanism of the <b>pinned</b> <b>connection.</b> Failure is induced by cracking of a centerpoint, which is applied for easy welding procedures.

50|$|Some {{facilities}} feature 60 or 100 ampere circuits {{which have}} larger {{versions of the}} stage pin connector to match the higher current rating. Since it is unusual to require more than 20 amperes on a single circuit with modern lighting equipment, adapters may be made to convert a single 60 or 100 ampere stage <b>pin</b> <b>connection</b> to three to five 20 ampere stage pin connections. However, each downstream connection must be independently protected by a fuse or breaker to avoid exceeding the current rating of downstream cables and connectors.|$|E
50|$|Handsets {{and often}} {{headsets}} {{for use with}} telephones commonly use a 4P4C connector. The two center pins are commonly used for the receiver, and the outer pins connect the transmitter, so that a reversal of <b>pin</b> <b>connection</b> is unaffected. Standard handset receivers functions normally when their polarity is reversed, but the electret microphone transmitter used in most modern handsets may not. Many telephones include polarity protection, so that the polarity may be reversed without affecting operation. Handsets manufactured before 1985 using a carbon microphone transmitter are not sensitive to polarity. Some hands-free headsets also may have a 4P4C connector, but the wiring may differ from the above diagram.|$|E

This allows the machines, including the [...] "bridges" [...] between the two known simply as conveyors, to communicate that they are busy, or awaiting a circuit board. The communication only goes sequentially, {{as there is no}} addressing. Instead the machine's SMEMA cables connect to each other's upstream or downstream plug. The plugs and wires are multimate connectors and receptacles consisting of 14 wire connections. However, only 4 wires are used for data, while the 8th <b>pin</b> <b>connection</b> is the shielding.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In <b>pinned</b> <b>connections,</b> the {{presence}} of an initial clearance increases the lug stress concentration with respect to a neat fit configuration. By employing a recently proposed loading parameter Φ valid for plane models, the applied load and initial clearance effects on the stress concentration are normalised for a straight-shanked, round-ended, longitudinally loaded pin-lug connection of fixed outer to inner radius ratio. Results are obtained with a Mitchell-type, Fourier series solution and with commercial Finite Elements. The applicability of the loading parameter Φ to <b>pinned</b> <b>connections</b> with small to relevant initial clearances is explored. Two preliminary design charts are presented, which quantify the lug stress concentration factor versus the loading parameter Φ for two lug geometries defined by inner to outer radii ratios of 0. 376 and 0. 77...|$|R

50|$|The Polish WT-4 plug {{is adopted}} in Russia as ШТР-IV and has four metal pins and an {{additional}} fourth dielectric pin. The corresponding socket comes in two variants. The GTN-4 socket (РТШ-IV in Russia) provides a 4 <b>pin</b> <b>connection</b> (in most cases, the two rightmost pins are used for connecting a single line). The GTNC-4 (РТШК-IV) is a GTN-4 socket that has an additional circuit. The 5th plastic pin of the inserted plug disconnects a 1μF capacitor that otherwise closes the circuit of the telephone line when the plug is not inserted. This feature allows testing the line when the phone is not plugged in. The usage of a capacitor is mostly obsolete and GTN-4 sockets produced later reuse the capacitor compartment for an additional RJ11 socket.|$|E
50|$|The bar {{frames of}} the rear engine unit and its {{high-pressure}} cylinders were rigidly attached to the boiler with the engine’s wide firebox extending over the coupled wheels. The front engine unit and its low-pressure cylinders were not rigidly attached to the boiler barrel, but carried the boiler on a single sliding bearing which was placed between the leading and intermediate coupled wheels. The underside of the smokebox was flattened to provide clearance {{between it and the}} cylinder assemblies of the front engine unit. The two engine units were coupled together by a single vertical <b>pin</b> <b>connection,</b> arranged at a point on the centre-line of the high-pressure cylinder saddle casting. This arrangement gave the locomotive a short rigid wheelbase of 8 ft which made it capable of traversing curves of short radius.|$|E
50|$|The {{longitudinal}} expansion and lateral sway {{movement of the}} deck are {{taken care of by}} expansion and articulation joints. There are two main expansion joints, one at each interface between the suspended span and the cantilever arms, and there are others at the towers and at the interface of the steel and concrete structures at both approach. There are total 8 articulation joints, 3 at each of the cantilever arms and 1 each in the suspended portion. These joints divide the bridge into segments with vertical <b>pin</b> <b>connection</b> between them to facilitate rotational movements of the deck. The bridge deck has longitudinal ruling gradient of 1 in 40 from either end, joined by a vertical curve of radius 4,000 ft. The cross gradient of deck is 1 in 48 between kerbs.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. An {{innovative}} dissipative (INERD <b>Pin)</b> <b>connection</b> system, {{which was}} previously developed for seismic resistant X-braced steel frames, {{was applied to}} retrofit existing precast industrial buildings designed only for gravity loads. Nonlinear dynamic analyses were carried out {{and the effectiveness of}} the dissipative connection system was evaluated. The INERD <b>Pin</b> <b>connection</b> system increased both the deformation capacity and the stiffness of the buildings, reducing damage of the structural elements. In case of low seismic actions, the INERD <b>Pin</b> <b>connection</b> system especially enhanced the stiffness of the structure, causing only small reductions of column rotations and top displacements. In case of severe seismic actions, the addition of the dissipative connections showed all its effectiveness particularly for low rotation capacity at column base, increasing the energy dissipation capacity and reducing the displacements of the structure. The results of the numerical investigations demonstrated the possibility to reduce the seismic vulnerability of existing precast buildings by means of dissipative connection systems...|$|E

The performance requirements of the key connection pair in weak rigidity combination planetary disc were analyzed. A structure connected by pins was designed. The analysis model which described the backlash in <b>pin</b> <b>connection</b> pair was established. The calculation formula of backlash was derived.
