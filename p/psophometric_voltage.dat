5000|$|<b>Psophometric</b> <b>voltage</b> is {{a circuit}} noise voltage {{measured}} with a psophometer that includes a CCIF-1951 weighting network.|$|E
50|$|<b>Psophometric</b> <b>voltage</b> readings, V, in millivolts, are {{commonly}} converted to dBm(psoph) by dBm(psoph) = 20 log10V - 57.78.|$|E
5000|$|... "Psophometric voltage" [...] {{should not}} be {{confused}} with [...] "psophometric emf," [...] i.e., the emf in a generator or line with 600 Î© internal resistance. For practical purposes, the psophometric emf is twice the corresponding <b>psophometric</b> <b>voltage.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{methods of}} the {{harmonic}} analysis of the rectified voltage at the m-pulse rectifier outlet has been developed, the norm of the <b>psophometric</b> <b>voltage</b> at the outlet of the smoothing filters has been justified, the methods of selection of the diagrams and parameters of the smoothing filters have been offered. The introduction of the developments in the existing systems of the electric supply allows to ensure the normal functioning of the communication lines, layed along the electric railways of direct current, and the devices of automatic blocking, to reduce the losses of the electric energy and labour expenditures for adjustment of the smoothing filters, to obtain {{the economy of the}} electrotechnical materials.
