5000|$|... #Subtitle level 2: Ejector Pin (<b>Pilot</b> <b>Pin)</b> for Broach Cutters ...|$|E
50|$|The <b>pilot</b> <b>pin</b> {{is located}} in the centre of main contact circle on 4- and 5-pin connectors. On 3-pin (2P+E) connectors, it is located on the contact circle {{opposite}} the ground pin. The other connectors are located 105° {{on either side of the}} earth pin, rather than 120° as in the smaller variants, to make room for the <b>pilot</b> <b>pin.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{ejector pin}} or also called as the <b>pilot</b> <b>pin</b> has 3 major {{functions}} {{to use with}} broach cutters: ...|$|E
50|$|The signal {{pins and}} their {{function}} were defined in SAE J1772-2001, which {{was included in}} IEC 61851. All plug types of IEC 62196-2 have the two additional signals: the control <b>pilot</b> (CP; <b>pin</b> 4) and proximity <b>pilot</b> (PP; <b>pin</b> 5) over the normal charging power pins: line (L1; pin 1), line or neutral (N, or L2; pin 2), and protective earth (PE; pin 3).|$|R
50|$|Before {{the main}} {{invasion}} force arrived in Panama City, Panama, two MH-6s supported by two AH-6s landed at Torrijos-Tocumen Airport to insert a beacon and combat controllers. Four other AH-6s conducted pre-assault {{attacks on the}} Panamanian Defense Force (PDF) Headquarters, La Comandancia, adjoining the heavily populated El Chorrillo neighborhood in downtown Panama City. One of the AH-6s was damaged by ground fire and crashlanded in the Comandancia compound. The two <b>pilots,</b> <b>pinned</b> down by small-arms fire for two hours, eventually made {{their way back to}} friendly forces, taking a PDF soldier prisoner along the way.|$|R
5000|$|After The Brothers McMullen, Britton {{was cast}} as Heather in a {{recurring}} {{role in the}} ABC sitcom Ellen, and starred as Cammie Barbash in the unsold Fox <b>pilot</b> <b>Pins</b> and Needles. In 1996, she began co-starring as Nikki Faber in the ABC sitcom Spin City opposite Michael J. Fox. [...] Her character was written out of the show when Charlie Sheen replaced Fox. She also appeared in the romantic comedy-drama No Looking Back (1998) and the mystery comedy-drama Looking for Kitty (2004), both directed by Edward Burns. In 2001, she co-starred opposite Chris Eigeman and Jamie Harris in the romantic comedy The Next Big Thing. She later co-starred in the independent films The Life Coach, Special Ed, The Lather Effect and The Last Winter.|$|R
50|$|The cooling of annular cutters is {{internal}}. The internal lubrication {{is provided}} {{through a hole}} {{with the help of}} a <b>pilot</b> <b>pin.</b> Internal lubrication makes the annular cutter faster and more efficient for deep hole drilling.|$|E
5000|$|The {{proposal}} of the Mennekes connector initiated by RWE and Daimler {{has been added}} as a [...] "Type 2" [...] implementation to IEC 62196 (IEC Type 2) providing a single and three phase coupler. The connector was specified in the VDE-AR-E 2623-2-2 standard - this connector specifies up to 63 A three-phase (at 400 V in Central Europe) which makes for a maximum of 63 A × 400 V × √3 = 43.6 kW. Additionally the IEC 62196-2 standard specifies a [...] "Type 3" [...] connector providing a single and three phase coupler with shutters. All plug types - including Type 1 (SAE), Type 2 (VDE) and Type 3 - share the same specifications for the <b>pilot</b> <b>pin</b> taken from the IEC 61851-1 standard.|$|E
5|$|C-5 (Summer Training): Worn {{during summer}} {{training}} at a CTC. No medals, medal ribbons, <b>pilot</b> wings, or <b>pins</b> are worn with this order of dress.|$|R
25|$|As {{he himself}} {{described}} it {{in a magazine}} article he penned for Nel Cielo, his airfield was attacked by ten enemy bombers. He shot {{down one of the}} bombers in flames at 9AM. He then dueled with another for twenty minutes before it crashed. The observer leapt from the wreckage and lit it on fire to deny its capture. Unfortunately, the observer managed to catch his own clothing on fire in the process. Still more unfortunately, the <b>pilot</b> was still <b>pinned</b> under the debris and burned to death. Meanwhile, Scaroni's squadron-mates shot down six more of the raiders. Scaroni capped off the day by downing another, even larger, bomber at 12:35. He thus ended the year with nine wins.|$|R
