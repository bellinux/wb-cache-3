40|$|The present work {{attempts}} to solve pollution problems in watery surroundings by aromatic compounds {{such as the}} phenol and the benzoic acid. Several ways of elimination of these compounds were the object of different research among which {{is the use of}} bacteria. In this framework, <b>Pseudomonas</b> aeruginosa <b>bacterium</b> is used to eliminate phenol and the benzoic acid. This made it possible to isolate the <b>Pseudomonas</b> aeruginosa <b>bacterium</b> directly on the nourishing environment containing phenol and benzoic acid as source of energy then the bacteria is incubated at 37 ℃ during a minimal duration of four days. Furthermore, we studied the influence of the <b>Pseudomonas</b> aeruginosa <b>bacterium</b> on the deterioration of an area exposed to a phenol and the benzoic acid concentration. Results obtained {{at the time of the}} different experimentations clearly show that phenol and the benzoic acid were eliminated by the <b>Pseudomonas</b> aeruginosa <b>bacterium.</b> However, it was noted that during the various investigations the <b>bacterium</b> <b>Pseudomonas</b> aeruginosa develops better in a phenol milieu and therefore degrades phenol more than benzoic acid...|$|R

5000|$|The Catabolite {{repression}} control (Crc) protein {{participates in}} suppressing expression of several genes involved in utilization of carbon sources in <b>Pseudomonas</b> <b>bacteria.</b> Presence of organic acids triggers activation of Crc and {{in conjunction with}} the Hfq protein genes that metabolize a given carbon source are downregulated until another more favorable carbon source is depleted.

40|$|Fluorescent <b>Pseudomonas</b> <b>bacteria</b> {{produce a}} wide variety of {{antimicrobial}} metabolites, including soap-like compounds referred to as biosurfactants. The results of this thesis showed that biosurfactant-producing <b>Pseudomonas</b> <b>bacteria</b> are effective in controlling Phytophthora foot rot disease of black pepper in Vietnam and promote root and shoot development of the ‘King of Spices’. Biosurfactant-producing P. fluorescens strain SS 101 was also effective in controlling tomato late blight caused by Phytophthora infestans. Current and future studies focus on how to implement these biocontrol agents in an integrated management practice to control Phytophthora diseases. The broad-spectrum activity of these antagonistic <b>Pseudomonas</b> <b>bacteria</b> and their biosurfactants also provide new opportunities to apply these agents for the protection and growth promotion of other crops. ...|$|E
40|$|<b>Pseudomonas</b> <b>bacteria</b> are {{ubiquitous}} Gram-negative and aerobic microorganisms {{that are}} known to harbor metal resistance mechanisms such as efflux pumps and intracellular redox enzymes. Specific <b>Pseudomonas</b> <b>bacteria</b> have been quantified in some metal-contaminated environments, but the entire Pseudomonas population has been poorly investigated under these conditions, and the link with metal bioavailability was not previously examined. In the present study, quantitative PCR and cell cultivation were used to monitor and characterize the Pseudomonas population at 4 different sediment sites contaminated with various levels of metals. At the same time, total metals and metal bioavailability (as estimated using an HCl 1 m extraction) were measured. It {{was found that the}} total level of Pseudomonas, as determined by qPCR using two different genes (oprI and the 16 S rRNA gene), was positively and significantly correlated with total and HCl-extractable Cu, Co, Ni, Pb and Zn, with high correlation coefficients (> 0. 8). Metal-contaminated sediments featured isolates of the Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas lutea and Pseudomonas aeruginosa groups, with other bacterial genera such as Mycobacterium, Klebsiella and Methylobacterium. It is concluded that <b>Pseudomonas</b> <b>bacteria</b> do proliferate in metal-contaminated sediments, but are still part of a complex community...|$|E
40|$|Background: The present {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} study the antibacterial effect of aqueous, ethanolic and ethyl acetate extracts of Teucrium polium plant on the bacteria isolated from urine samples of those with UTI and to compare it with the effect of commonly used antibiotics in treating UTIs. Materials and Methods: The antibiotic resistance of 147 strains of bacteria causing UTIs to the antibiotics selected through Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method was determined. In the meantime, the aqueous, ethanolic and ethyl acetate extracts of T. polium plant were prepared. The antibacterial activity of these extracts was examined using Disk Diffusion Method. Finally, Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) of antibacterial were determined using serial dilution method. Results: T. polium extracts were merely effective in enterococcus and <b>pseudomonas</b> <b>bacteria.</b> In general, the MIC rate of aqueous extract in enterococcus was 1. 25 - 5 mg/ml. The MIC rate of ethanolic extract for enterococcus was calculated as 10 mg/ml. The MIC of aqueous and ethyl acetate extracts for <b>pseudomonas</b> <b>bacteria</b> were achieved as 5 and 20 mg/ml, respectively. The MBC contents of aqueous and ethyl acetate extracts of teucrium for <b>pseudomonas</b> <b>bacteria</b> was 10 mg/ml in aqueous and 20 mg/ml in ethyl acetate extracts. The MBC content of extracts for enterococcus bacteria were 10 mg/ml in aqueous extract and 20 mg/ml in ethanolic extract. Conclusion: T. polium extract can be effective in some bacteria causing urinary tract infection, especially enterococcus...|$|E
