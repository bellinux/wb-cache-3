40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the use of}} FRP EBR for the flexural strengthening of continuous beams. With respect {{to this type of}} beams, few research has been reported. By means of an experimental and analytical study the non-linear behaviour of 2 -span reinforced concrete beams, strengthened with externally bonded FRP laminates, has been analyzed. It is demonstrated that FRP strengthened cross-sections restrict the rotation of a plastic hinge at that location, and allow additional <b>plasting</b> hinge formation in unstrengthened cross-sections. In addtion, the bond behaviour between the FRP and the concrete in the dase of flexural strengthening of continuous beams has been studied, it is shown that the debonding mechanisms are also governed by the shear force and moment redistribution occurring in multi-span beams...|$|E

2500|$|After {{the fall}} of the Soviet Union, in {{addition}} to Ukraine, <b>Plast</b> units were formed in Poland, Slovakia, Lithuania, Latvia, Kazakhstan and the Czech Republic.

40|$|Passage of gonococcal cells {{through a}} Ribi cell {{fractionator}} produced {{a mixture of}} protoplasm and cell particulates, the latter being separable in sucrose solutions. Separation of these particulates resulted in the detection of objects identified as cell walls and “plasts. ” The latter objects had an average diameter of 1. 00 ± 0. 05 μm and consisted of spatially oriented granules surrounded by a membrane-like structure only. Cell wall structures were not observed with these <b>plasts.</b> <b>Plasts</b> were morphologically stable in distilled water and at low pH values. Although 50 % more pressure was required to rupture <b>plasts</b> than whole cells, <b>plast</b> morphology was destroyed by organic solvents. Whole cell and <b>plast</b> morphology was examined by electron and phase microscopy, and certain correlations were made between structure and morphological stability. Cell wall antiserum reactivities were quantitatively different for <b>plasts</b> and cell walls. Serological reactivities of <b>plasts</b> were separable by sonic oscillation and differential centrifugation of the sonically treated material...|$|R
2500|$|In August 1997, <b>Plast</b> Ukrainian Scouting {{celebrated the}} 85th anniversary {{since the first}} Scouting units {{appeared}} in Ukraine in 1911, with a <b>Plast</b> Jamboree at the renamed Sokil <b>Plast</b> Museum-Camp, attended by 700 Scouts from 34 units throughout Ukraine. [...] Highlights of this Jamboree included the inauguration the third Nachalniy Plastun (Chief Scout) in <b>Plast's</b> history, and the first ever inaugurated in Ukraine, Dr. Lubomyr Romankiw on 10 August 1997; {{the opening of the}} Museum at this historic campsite, donated by Metropolitan Andrey Sheptytsky, which had been used by <b>Plast</b> from 1924–1944; and the attendance of several Scouts from the First Era of Ukrainian Scouting, including the 93-year-old composer Mykola Kolessa.|$|R
500|$|Another {{musical work}} {{has also been}} discovered, with {{identical}} or near-identical music, that long predates Alexandrov's 1943 involvement with the Anthem of the USSR. A Ukrainian Scouting (<b>Plast)</b> anthem from c. 1912, with music composed by Yuriy Piasećkiy (Юрій Пясецький) known as [...] "Plastovy Obit" [...] (Пластовий Oбіт - The <b>Plast</b> Oath), to lyrics by <b>Plast</b> founder Oleksander Tysovsky (Oлександр Тисовський) has been noted by <b>Plast</b> members to bear an extremely close or identical resemblance to the later Russian/Soviet anthem. The music and words are found in various <b>Plast</b> handbooks and songbooks, and a performance of this song in 2012 can be viewed on YouTube. The first line reads: [...] "V pozhezhakh vsesvitnykh, u lunakh kryvavykh" [...] - [...] "В пожежах всесвітних, у лунах кривавих". The Piasetsky-Tysovsky anthem actually glorifies the Ukrainian independence movement, which {{had the support of}} the <b>Plast</b> organization.|$|R
