40|$|Illegal Parking {{has become}} a serious problem in major cities of China, but the {{features}} and causes of illegal parking are seldom studied; hence, no effective solutions have been proposed to solve this problem. This study is a case study on one provincial capital city of China, Hefei, Anhui. With an on-site observation and a self-designed questionnaire survey, this study is able to reveal the general background {{of the study area}} where illegal parking is prevalent due to great parking shortage. After analyzing all the data obtained from the surveys, this study also brings to light the main characteristics of illegal-parking participants, including age, gender, income, perception on punishments and parking difficulty, as well as the distributions of illegal-parking activities temporally and spatially. Through these, this study gives a comprehensive picture of what illegal-parking phenomenon is like. The reasons leading to illegal parking vary. This study uses a combination model of PEST and Cause and Effect Diagram (CED) to comprehensively explain the illegal parking causes from four aspects: policy & regulation, economic, social and technique. Aiming at solving illegal parking problem, this study looks deeply into the externalities produced by and the costs of illegal-parking activity. A microeconomic analysis is adopted to compare the external cost, generalized cost and perceived cost of illegal parking. Lastly, a series of recommendations are proposed accordingly. Increasing generalized cost is then considered as an effective and efficient way to solve illegal parking problem by not only reducing illegal parking demand but also internalizing the externality. Besides, carrying out supportive policies, increasing parking supply, educating drivers and updating <b>parking</b> <b>facilities</b> and <b>management</b> methods are also recommended based on the analysis of illegal parking causes. published_or_final_versionTransport Policy and PlanningMasterMaster of Arts in Transport Policy and Plannin...|$|R

40|$|Parking problem {{becomes one}} of major issues in the city {{transportation}} management since the spatial resource of a city is limited and the parking cost is expensive. Lots of {{cars on the road}} should spend unnecessary time and consume energy during searching for parking due to limited parking space. To cope with these limitations and give more intelligent solutions to drivers in the selection of <b>parking</b> <b>facility,</b> this study proposes a smart parking guidance algorithm. The proposed algorithm supports drivers to find the most appropriate <b>parking</b> <b>facility</b> considering real-time status of <b>parking</b> <b>facilities</b> in a city. To suggest the most suitable <b>parking</b> <b>facility,</b> several factors such as driving distance to the guided <b>parking</b> <b>facility,</b> walking distance from the guided <b>parking</b> <b>facility</b> to destination, expected parking cost, and traffic congestion due to parking guidance, are considered in the proposed algorithm. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, simulation tests have been carried out. The proposed algorithm helps to maximize the utilization of space resources of a city, and reduce unnecessary energy consumption and CO 2 emission of wandering cars since it is designed to control the utilization of <b>parking</b> <b>facility</b> efficiently and reduce traffic congestion due to parking space search. close 0...|$|R
