50|$|Battens were {{originally}} made from wood, {{but have been}} replaced by steel pipe. In the United States they are typically fabricated from 21 ft sections of 1.5 in nominal diameter, 1.9 in outside diameter, schedule 40 steel pipe that are spliced together (with internal <b>pipe</b> <b>sleeves</b> and bolts) to provide a continuous member that stretches the width of a stage. Schedule 80 pipe is also used. Standard pipe battens are typically designed to support 15 to 30 lb of live load per foot of length.|$|E

50|$|LPS {{comprises}} a loose {{sleeve of}} polyethylene that completely wraps the pipe, including the bells of any joints. The sleeving inhibits corrosion {{by a number}} of mechanisms. It physically separates the pipe from soil particles, preventing direct galvanic corrosion. By providing an impermeable barrier to ground water, the sleeve also inhibits the diffusion of oxygen to the ductile iron surface and limits the availability of electrolytes that would accelerate corrosion. It provides a homogeneous environment along the pipe surface so that corrosion occurs evenly over the <b>pipe.</b> The <b>sleeve</b> also restricts the availability of nutrients which could support sulfate-reducing bacteria, inhibiting microbially induced corrosion. LPS is not designed to be completely water-tight but rather to greatly restrict the movement of water to and from the pipe surface. Water present beneath the sleeve and in contact with the pipe surface is rapidly deoxygenated and depleted of nutrients and forms a stable environment in which limited further corrosion occurs. An improperly installed sleeve that continues to allow the free flow of ground water is not effective in inhibiting corrosion.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the performance of}} the proposed grouted sleeve connector with and without steel spiral as transverse reinforcement under incremental tensile load until failure. The connector utilized mild steel <b>pipe</b> as <b>sleeve</b> where the sleeve consists of external and internal sleeve with the diameter of the external sleeve is larger than internal sleeve. The mild steel pipe and the steel spiral are used to confine and reinforce the grout and the two discontinued bars spliced end-to-end configuration in the sleeve. The test shows that, there are two modes of failure which were bar slipped and bar fractured outside the sleeve. Eleven specimens out of fourteen shows satisfactory results as it failed due to bar fractured outside the sleeve and achieve satisfactory ultimate tensile capacity. The stiffness and the ductility of the connectors also satisfy. Grouted sleeve connectors with steel spiral perform better compared to connectors without a steel spiral. The test shows that {{the performance of the}} grouted sleeve connector with or without steel spiral was governed by grout-bar bond, anchorage length and confinement action provided by the sleeve and the steel spiral. The connectors have a potential to be used in connecting precast concrete structure...|$|R
40|$|In {{the buried}} natural gas pipelines, many defects can occur by {{construction}} faults, corrosion, third-party interference and ground movement. Nowadays, selection of proper repair method on in-service natural gas pipeline {{is a matter}} of primary concern of Korea Gas Corporation (KOGAS). Therefore, the systematic study has been required for the repair methods of API 5 L X 65 main pipeline operating under the internal pressure of 6. 9 MPa whose diameter is 762 mm and thickness is 17. 5 mm. The objective of this work is to investigate the fracture behavior of repaired pipe using full scale burst test and to select the appropriate repair method of in-service gas pipelines. We performed a series of full scale burst test for damaged pipe and each repaired pipe and analyzed the fracture behavior on API 5 L X 65 grade gas pipelines (diameter 762 mm, thickness 17. 5 mm) with mechanically machined defects. Tested specimens are damaged pipe and repaired <b>pipes</b> with <b>sleeve</b> welding, epoxy sleeve, composite material rapping (clock-spring) and direct deposit welding method for damaged pipe with same shape. From the study for merits and demerits, safety and reliability of each repair methods, we confirmed the efficiency and safety of proper in-service pipeline repair methods for various defec...|$|R
60|$|While thus engaged, an old sailor on a chest {{just under}} me was puffing out volumes of tobacco smoke. My supper finished, he brushed {{the stem of}} his sooty <b>pipe</b> against the <b>sleeve</b> of his frock, and politely waved it toward me. The {{attention}} was sailor-like; as for the nicety of the thing, no man {{who has lived in}} forecastles is at all fastidious; and so, after a few vigorous whiffs to induce repose, I turned over and tried my best to forget myself. But in vain. My crib, instead of extending fore and aft, as it should have done, was placed athwart ships, that is, at right angles to the keel, and the vessel, going before the wind, rolled to such a degree, that-every time my heels went up and my head went down, I thought I was on the point of turning a somerset. Beside this, there were still more annoying causes of inquietude; and {{every once in a while}} a splash of water came down the open scuttle, and flung the spray in my face.|$|R
40|$|During summer 1996, {{low-pressure}} permeation grouting {{was performed}} inside portions of four unlined, shallow waste disposal trenches at a radioactive waste burial ground that was opened in 1951 at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). The {{objective was to}} selectively control sources that release about 25 percent of all strontium 90 (90 Sr) discharged from the ORNL complex. A unique grouting methodology was adapted to control interaction of wastes with natural runoff at this humid site. Driven <b>sleeve</b> <b>pipes</b> were injected 4 to 5 times with multiple formulae of type III portland cement- based grouts, ultra fine cement-based grouts, and acrylamide grouts. Multiple-hole grout injection was monitored continuously using real time monitoring equipment. Apparent Lugeon values were calculated during grouting operations and grout formulae were continually adjusted during injection to maximize permeation, durability, and economy. Over 500 cubic meters of combined grout types were emplaced. At the completion of production grouting, the effectiveness of grout spread and in situ hydraulic conductivity of the grouted mass were assessed. The average residual hydraulic conductivity measured in more than 20 check pipes was less than I x 10 ` cm/sec. Hydrologic monitoring has been established to determine the overall effectiveness of the project for 9 OSr control...|$|R
50|$|Although the {{external}} furnace {{area of the}} kiln has at some stage been dismantled and filled in, it can be located {{on the eastern side}} where ground subsidence reveals a round flue outlet. This is 1.5m from the northern edge of the building with 4.18m between the top of the brick wall and the top of the outlet. The diameter of the outlet is approximately 30 cm. The corrugated roof sheeting at the centre of the eastern wall has been cut back in two places and the metal in between bent down, indicating the former position of the chimney. A flat piece of iron attached to the left of this is probably the remains of a holding bracket for the chimney. Looking inside through the broken bricks on the western wall, it is possible to see a second matching flue outlet at a corresponding distance from the southern edge of the building. At a lower level, between these round outlets and the northern and southern walls, are two square holes indicating the flue inlets. Although no longer attached to the inlets and outlets, the remains of two iron flues still lie on the dirt floor, running across the barn and back again. They appear to be made out of iron sheeting fashioned into round <b>pipes</b> with telescopic <b>sleeves</b> joined together to form the returns. Some remnants of timber tiers are also evident, mainly along the northern wall. These tiers are made of bush saplings.|$|R
40|$|Risers in {{offshore}} operations {{are subjected to}} corrosion during their service life cycle. The use of relatively inexpensive, high strength to weight ratio fibre reinforced polymer composite (FRPC) as a load bearing <b>pipe</b> repair <b>sleeve</b> is an emerging technology that is becoming common for offshore applications. Risers experience complex loading profiles and experimental investigations often incur substantial time, complicated instrumentation and setup costs. The main aim {{of this research is}} to develop a design tool for the repair of offshore riser that suffers from external corrosion damage on its surface using FRPC material. The simplest configuration of a fixed platform riser {{in the form of a}} vertical single-wall pipe is being considered. Characterization of the stress-strain behaviour of the FRPC laminate in the composite repair system subjected to various load profiles of a common riser is performed. The means of composite repair takes into account the ease of automated installation. The final repair method considers the use of unidirectional pre-impregnated (prepreg) FRPC that is assumed to be helically wounded around the riser. Finite element models of the composite repair system were developed via ABAQUS. Global analysis of the entire length of the riser was omitted as external corrosions usually occurs in a localised manner on the surface of the riser. Instead, local analyses were conducted where boundary conditions were applied to mimic an infinitely long cylindrical structure such as the riser. The local analyses FEA models were made to capture the stress-strain behaviour of the FRPC laminate subjected to different load profiles including static loadings such as internal pressure, tensile load and bending load. The design loads were calculated based on a limit analysis known as Double-Elastic Curve method developed by Alexander (2008). Proper element selection and mesh convergence were carried out to determine the FE model that can minimize the time and CPU memory needed for the simulation without compromising the accuracy of the results. The second part of this research integrated experimental tests to validate the FE model developed using the ABAQUS general purpose code. Due to constraints on cost and supply of materials and equipment, small-scale tests were conducted. Similitude relations were used to determine the scale properties between the model and the prototype. The final results showed that the FE model can represent the real-life tests of corroded riser repaired with off-axis FRPC laminate with great accuracy of more than 85...|$|R
