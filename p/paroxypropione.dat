50|$|<b>Paroxypropione</b> is a manufactured, nonsteroidal {{estrogen}} {{that has}} been used medically as an antigonadotropin in Spain and Italy. <b>Paroxypropione</b> was first synthesized in 1902. Its antigonadotropic properties were discovered in 1951 and it entered clinical use shortly thereafter.|$|E

5000|$|Estrogens: benzestrol, bifluranol, estrobin (DBE), {{diethylstilbestrol}} (stilbestrol), dienestrol, erteberel, fosfestrol, hexestrol (dihydroxystilbestrol), methallenestril, methestrol, methestrol dipropionate, <b>paroxypropione,</b> prinaberel, and triphenylethylene, {{as well as}} many xenoestrogens ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Paroxypropione</b> {{is closely}} related {{structurally}} to p-hydroxybenzoic acid and parabens such as methylparaben, and also bears a close resemblance to diethylstilbestrol (which, in fact, produces <b>paroxypropione</b> as an active metabolite) and alkylphenols like nonylphenol, {{all of which are}} also estrogens. The drug possesses relatively low affinity for the estrogen receptor and must be given at high dosages to achieve significant estrogenic and antigonadotropic action, for instance, 0.8 to 1.6 g/day. It possesses 0.1% of the estrogenic activity of estrone and less than 0.5% of the antigonadotropic activity of estrone.|$|E
50|$|Estrogens {{closely related}} to the stilbestrols include <b>paroxypropione</b> (a {{metabolite}} of diethylstilbestrol) and the anise and fennel-derived compounds anol, dianol, anethole, dianethole, and photoanethole (from which the stilbestrol estrogens were actually originally derived). The triphenylethylene group of estrogenic drugs that includes triphenylethylene itself, estrobin, chlorotrianisene, broparestrol, ethamoxytriphetol, clomifene, tamoxifen, and more recently developed derivatives is also very closely related structurally to the stilbestrols.|$|E
