5|$|A {{favourite}} of {{the ruling}} Ngô family, Đính received rapid promotions ahead of officers who were regarded as more capable. He converted to Roman Catholicism to curry favour with Diệm, and headed the military wing of the Cần Lao party, a secret Catholic organisation that maintained the Ngôs' grip on <b>power.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> age of 32, Đính became the youngest ever ARVN general and {{the commander of the}} II Corps, but he was regarded as a dangerous, egotistical and impetuous figure with a weakness for alcohol and partying.|$|E
5|$|A {{photovoltaic}} power station, {{also known}} as a solar park, is a large-scale photovoltaic system (PV system) designed for the supply of merchant power into the electricity grid. They are differentiated from most building-mounted and other decentralised solar power applications because they supply <b>power</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> utility level, rather than to a local user or users. They are sometimes also referred to as solar farms or solar ranches, especially when sited in agricultural areas. The generic expression utility-scale solar is sometimes used to describe this type of project.|$|E

5|$|During Hurricane Sandy in October 2012, {{parts and}} {{remnants}} of the storm reached Presque Isle. The park was closed in preparation of the storm and waves for 14 – 18 feet were called for, along with high winds. The storm {{was expected to be}} severe, but luckily was not. Only 8 foot waves were recorded and not as high of winds either. The park made it out with only minor flooding, a few downed trees, and the loss of <b>power</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> park marina.|$|E
5|$|During its {{formative}} stages, the typhoon brought high {{waves to}} Guam, resulting in one death. Twelve families were also left homeless. After passing near Taiwan, Andy brought strong winds, {{which resulted in}} 13deaths. Government offices, schools and airports were closed. At least 60 fishing boats in harbors were badly damaged or wrecked due to strong winds. A total of 300poer poles were brought down; consequently, {{nearly a quarter of}} Taiwan residents lost <b>power</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> height of the storm. After moving ashore in China, Andy brought heavy rains to nearby Hong Kong.|$|E

A large landslide occurred {{in the capital of}} Fort-de-France due to excessive soil saturation, prompting some 40 families to evacuate the area.

5|$|One {{person was}} killed and another was injured in Taipei after a 20m (65ft) high {{scaffolding}} in a construction site collapsed. At least 495mm (19in) of rain fell {{in the mountains of}} Taiwan, triggering flooding which damaged about 24hectares of crops, leaving NT$7.8million (US$236,300) in losses. A total of 8,795 residences were left without <b>power</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> height of the storm. Several roads and bridges were also washed out from flooding. Officials in Taiwan recorded 29 landslides, mostly in northern areas, and urged residents to evacuate due to the possibility of more.|$|E
5|$|The Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB), {{charged with}} {{investigating}} the accident, examined the wreckage at Long Island MacArthur Airport.

5|$|The {{array of}} a {{photovoltaic}} power system, or PV system, produces direct current (DC) power which fluctuates with the sunlight's intensity.

President Hastings Banda, {{who was in}} <b>power</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time, responded with several small-scale prevention initiatives and created the National AIDS Control Programme, {{a division of the}} Ministry of Health, to manage the growing epidemic. Banda believed that issues relating to sex, including HIV transmission, should not be addressed in the public sphere; during this time, it was illegal for Malawian citizens to discuss the epidemic openly. In 1989, Banda introduced a five-year World Bank Medium Term Plan to combat the epidemic, but HIV prevalence had already increased drastically at this point.|$|E

5|$|Voyager 1 {{has three}} {{radioisotope}} thermoelectric generators (RTGs) {{mounted on a}} boom. Each MHW-RTG contains 24 pressed plutonium-238 oxide spheres. The RTGs generated about 470 W of electric <b>power</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time of launch, with the remainder being dissipated as waste heat. The power output of the RTGs declines over time (due to the 87.7-year half-life of the fuel and degradation of the thermocouples), but the craft's RTGs will continue to support some of its operations until 2025.|$|E

50|$|In {{computation}} {{of radiation}} performance of multi-port antennas especially in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antenna systems total active reflection coefficient, TARC, relates the total incident {{power to the}} radiated power.The total active reflection coefficient (TARC) is the square root of {{the sum of all}} incident <b>powers</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> ports minus radiated power, divided by the sum of all incident <b>powers</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> ports of an N-port antenna. The TARC is a function of frequency. With this definition we can characterize the multi-port antenna’s frequency bandwidth and radiation performance. TARC can be computed directly from the scattering matrix for different excitations.|$|R

5|$|After Alexander's {{death in}} 323BC, the ensuing {{wars of the}} Diadochi, and the {{partitioning}} of Alexander's short-lived empire, Macedonia remained a Greek cultural and political center in the Mediterranean region along with Ptolemaic Egypt, the Seleucid Empire, and the Kingdom of Pergamon. Important cities such as Pella, Pydna, and Amphipolis were involved in power struggles {{for control of the}} territory. New cities were founded, such as Thessalonica by the usurper Cassander (named after his wife Thessalonike of Macedon). Macedonia's decline began with the Macedonian Wars and the rise of Rome as the leading Mediterranean <b>power.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> end of the Third Macedonian War in 168BC, the Macedonian monarchy was abolished and replaced by Roman client states. A short-lived revival of the monarchy during the Fourth Macedonian War in 150–148BC ended with the establishment of the Roman province of Macedonia.|$|E
5|$|After his dismissal, {{his successors}} {{reversed}} his policy of reconciliation, {{resulting in a}} large-scale anti-Arab rebellion among the Soghdians. Another major defeat against the Turgesh in the Battle of the Defile {{was followed by the}} almost complete collapse of the Arab position in Trasoxiana and the outbreak of a major rebellion in Khurasan itself, led by al-Harith ibn Surayj. Appointed for a second time to govern Khurasan in late 734, Asad brought fresh troops into the province and managed to suppress Harith's uprising in 735–736, although the rebel leader himself escaped capture. An expedition in Khuttal in 737 brought about the intervention of the Turgesh khagan at the head of an army. Despite initial Arab setbacks and the Turgesh invasion of Khurasan, Asad succeeded in inflicting a defeat upon the khagan in person at the Battle of Kharistan, turning back the Turgesh army. Despite Asad's death a few months later, this success was instrumental in preserving Muslim rule in Central Asia, as the blow to the khagans prestige led to his murder soon after and the collapse of Turgesh <b>power.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> same time, Asad's conciliatory policy towards the native population laid the foundations for its eventual acceptance of Muslim rule and the Islamization of Central Asia.|$|E
