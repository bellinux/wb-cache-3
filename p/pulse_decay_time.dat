40|$|Superconducting tunnel {{junctions}} (STJs) {{offer the}} capability of photon counting with intrinsic energy resolving power. This resolving power is ultimately limited by the variance {{on the number of}} charge carriers generated in the photon absorption process (Fano limit) and the variance on the number of tunnelled charge carriers (tunnel limit). In addition, the performance can be degraded by electronic noise related to the read-out of the devices and by spatial non-uniformities in the response across the detector area. The present generation of our Ta-Al STJs is such that their spectroscopic performance in the UV/visible is limited by tunnel noise. This noise contribution is usually considered a device constant, (which may only vary marginally with bias conditions) and evaluated for infinite integration time. It can be shown, however, that the tunnel noise contribution is strongly time dependent and can be reduced by almost an order of magnitude for a properly chosen integration time. In this paper we present the experimental demonstration and numerical simulations of this time dependence on a series of Ta-Al STJs with different <b>pulse</b> <b>decay</b> <b>times.</b> The experimental results are in qualitative agreement with the simulations, but do not quite achieve the predicted performance.

40|$|Atmospheric Čerenkov Technique is an {{established}} methodology to study TeV energy gamma rays. However the challenging problem {{has always been}} the poor signal to noise ratio due to the presence of abundant cosmic rays. Several ingenious techniques have been employed to alleviate this problem, most of which are centred around the Čerenkov image characteristics. However there are not many techniques available for improving the signal to noise ratio of the data from wavefront sampling observations. One such possible technique is to use the Čerenkov photon arrival times and identify the species dependent characteristics in them. Here we carry out systematic monte carlo simulation studies of the timing information of Čerenkov photons at the observation level. We have parameterized the shape of the Čerenkov shower front as well as the pulse shapes in terms of experimentally measurable quantities. We demonstrate the sensitivity of the curvature of the shower front, pulse shape parameters as well as the photon arrival time jitter to primary species and show their efficiency in improving the signal to noise ratio.

The POST consists of multiple absorbers thermally coupled {{to one or}} more transition-edge sensor (TES). Each absorber element has a different thermal coupling to the TES. This results in a distribution of different pulse shapes and enables position discrimination between the absorber elements. POST'S are motivated by the desire to achieve the largest possible focal plane area with the fewest number of readout channels and are ideally suited to increasing the Constellation-X focal plane area, without comprising on spatial sampling. Optimizing the performance of POST'S requires careful design of key parameters such as the thermal conductances between the absorbers, TES and the heat sink. as well as the absorber heat capacities.

40|$|Soil {{emissions}} {{have been}} identified as a major source (~ 15 %) of global nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions. Parameterizations of soil NOx emissions (SNOx) for use in the current generation of chemical transport models were designed to capture mean seasonal behaviour. These parameterizations do not, however, respond quantitatively to the meteorological triggers that result in pulsed SNOx as are widely observed. Here we present a new mechanistic parameterization of SNOx implemented into a global chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem). The parameterization represents available nitrogen (N) in soils using biome specific emission factors, online wet- and dry-deposition of N as well as fertilizer and manure N derived from a spatially explicit dataset distributed using seasonality derived from data obtained by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer. Moreover, it represents the functional form of emissions derived from point measurements and ecosystem scale experiments including pulsing following soil wetting by rain or irrigation, and emissions that are a smooth function of soil moisture. This parameterization yields global above-soil SNOx of 10. 7 Tg N yr− 1 , including 1. 8 Tg N yr− 1 from fertilizer N input (0. 68 % of applied N) and 0. 5 Tg N yr− 1 from atmospheric N deposition. Over the United States Great Plains, SNOx are predicted to comprise 15 – 40 % of the tropospheric NO 2 column and increase column variability by a factor of 2 – 4 during the summer months due to chemical fertilizer application and warm temperatures. SNOx enhancements of 50 – 80 % of the simulated NO 2 column are predicted over the African Sahel during the monsoon onset (April–June). In this region the day-to-day variability of column NO 2 is increased by a factor of 5 due to pulsed-N emissions.

We also show that the OMI mean (median) NO 2 on the overpass following first rainfall over the Sahel is 49 % (23 %) higher than in the five days preceding.

30|$|Each of the {{aforementioned}} recent methods has its advantage and disadvantage. First, crushed sample method is the simplest method where only two chambers of known volumes are needed and gas is allowed to expand into the crushed sample chamber from a reference chamber (Cui et al. 2009; Zamirian et al. 2014). Using pressure and time data, one can calculate the permeability. However, crushed samples do not allow for permeability measurements under variable stress conditions. Second, the <b>pulse</b> <b>decay</b> technique requires sending a pressure pulse from the upstream volume, which will permeate through the sample to a downstream volume (Brace et al. 1968; Hsieh et al. 1981; Dicker and Smits 1988; Jones 1997). The pressure decay response is continuously recorded with time, and then, sample permeability is estimated by interpretation of pressure decay curve. The benefit from the <b>pulse</b> <b>decay</b> is the <b>time</b> reduction in obtaining permeability of tight samples. However, as will be discussed thoroughly in this paper, the current models do not accurately deal with <b>pulse</b> <b>decay</b> experiments at pressure ranges when gas behaves non-ideally. Third, pore pressure oscillations method was proposed in order to tackle the problem of getting noisy signal from the <b>pulse</b> <b>decay</b> technique. In this method, sinusoidal pore pressure pulse is sent from the upstream of the sample {{and based on the}} retardation of the signal and phase change at the downstream, permeability can be calculated (Fischer 1992; Jin et al. 2015). However, recent pressure transducers do not cause noisy signals that require a new modification on enhancing the signal, especially when the signal is clear from a simpler measurement technique like the <b>pulse</b> <b>decay.</b> Finally, complex pore pressure oscillations method is similar to the pore pressure oscillations methods, but instead of sending a sinusoidal pore pressure pulse from the upstream, different pore pressure pulses that are more distinct are sent (Boitnott 1997). This method has an advantage over the pore pressure oscillations that it can take measurements for high permeability samples; however, it still adds complexity that is unneeded as the same measurements can be taken in a simpler manner. Therefore, it was found in this work that the <b>pulse</b> <b>decay</b> is a method that offers a good degree of accuracy and speed with the minimum amount of work needed.|$|R

For the vv special {{case in which the}} nonstationary noise is the product of frt a modulation function and a stationary noise, it is shown that ^■ ^ the problem can often be reduced to an equivalent stationary problem and solved in a well kvown way. The two-dimensional power spectrum is used to compute the optimum bandwidth of an RC filter for detection of a rectangular <b>pulse</b> in exponentially <b>decaying</b> white noise. Curves showing that the optimum bandwidth as a function of time and the product of <b>pulse</b> length and <b>decay</b> <b>time</b> constant are developed. The results are compared with the results obtained for a stationary noise. Finally, the problem of computing the response of an RLC band-pass filter to volume reverberation is studied. An asymptotic expansion is derived which provides sufficient accuracy for most engineering work. Bounds on the error are obtained...|$|R
30|$|Among {{the methods}} described, the pseudo-pressure and pseudo-time {{approach}} {{would be the most}} accurate way for analyzing the <b>pulse</b> <b>decay</b> experiments with gases because the pseudo-pressure approach is based on the compressible flow equation; therefore, the method can accurately describe the behavior of gases in general. The only method that attempted to apply the pseudo-pressure approach (Haskett et al. 1988) has some limitations. Those limitations, as mentioned previously, had to do with converting the difference in pressure between the upstream and downstream to pseudo-pressures and the significant amount of work for the type curve matching. Therefore, {{there is a need to}} accurately and efficiently treat compressible fluids <b>pulse</b> <b>decay</b> experiments to estimate the permeability. In this work, a pseudo-pressure and pseudo-time straight-line approach is proposed to resolve the treatment of gas viscosity and compressibility in the estimation of gas permeability from <b>pulse</b> <b>decay</b> experiments.|$|R
40|$|International audienceVery low {{permeability}} geomaterials (order of nanoDarcy (10 − 21 m 2)), such as clay rocks, {{are of interest}} for many industrial applications including production from unconventional reserves of oil and gas, CO 2 geological storage and deep geological disposal of high-level long-lived radioactive waste. In these last two applications, the efficiency of clay, as a barrier, relies on their very {{low permeability}}. Yet, laboratory measurement of low permeability to water (below 100 nD (10 − 19 m 2)) remains a technical challenge. Some authors (Hsieh et al., 1981, Int. J. Rock Mech. Min. Sci. Geomech. Abstr. 18, 245 - 252) argue that steady state methods are irrelevant due to {{the time required to}} stabilize water fluxes in such low permeability media and prefer a transient technique called <b>pulse</b> <b>decay.</b> This study aims to perform and compare transient and steady state techniques on three samples. Regarding the steady state method, a high precision pump was used to measure water flow rate through the sample. We show that with a suitable set-up, the steady state method enables us to measure a very low permeability of 0. 8 nD (8 × 10 − 22 m 2) over a period of three days and 2. 6 nD (2. 6 × 10 − 21 m 2) over a period of one day. While the <b>pulse</b> <b>decay</b> test provides only an average estimate of the permeability for a comparable duration. Many issues are raised in <b>pulse</b> <b>decay</b> tests: determination of the reservoirs storage factor, micro leakage effects, determination of the initial pulse pressure, 2 D mechanical effect. Contrary to the widespread belief that transient techniques are required to measure very low permeability, we show that direct steady state measurement of water permeability, with suitable equipments, can be much faster and more accurate than measurement by <b>pulse</b> <b>decay.</b> In fact, low water and rock compressibilities result in fast propagation of pressure wave and it cannot be argued that steady state conditions are not reachable in a reasonable amount of <b>time.</b> Still, <b>pulse</b> <b>decay</b> remains an interesting alternative to steady state methods when permeability is higher than 50 nD (5 × 10 − 20 m 2) ...|$|R

Using numerical code RFPA 2 D (dynamic version), spallation processes of rock-like medium induced by reflection of stress wave with different rise <b>time</b> and <b>decay</b> <b>time</b> are simulated, {{and based on}} description and discussion on the failure area in the document [1], {{the influence of the}} rise <b>time</b> and <b>decay</b> <b>time</b> of stress wave on spalling process of rock-like material are numerically analyzed and discussed. Results indicate that the comminution zone is affected little by the duration of stress wave regardless of the rise <b>time</b> or <b>decay</b> <b>time,</b> and the fracture zone is affected to a greater extent by the rise <b>time</b> than the <b>decay</b> <b>time,</b> and the spalling zone is affected to some extent by the duration of stress wave regardless of the rise <b>time</b> or <b>decay</b> <b>time,</b> also, the stability of specimen is affected by the duration of stress wave regardless of the rise <b>time</b> or <b>decay</b> <b>time,</b> and the specimen loses stability at a certain <b>decay</b> <b>time</b> earlier than that at the same rise time. Furthermore, the effects of rise <b>time</b> and <b>decay</b> <b>time</b> on the number of failure elements are also investigated. Results show that a shorter rise and <b>decay</b> <b>time</b> increase the number of radial cracks. At longer rise <b>time</b> and <b>decay</b> <b>time,</b> the number of cracks is reduced and the cracks extend longer. In addition, the spalling increases to some extent as the rise <b>time</b> or <b>decay</b> <b>time</b> decreases...|$|R

40|$|Silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) are {{expected}} to replace photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) in several applications that require scintillation detectors with excellent timing resolution, such as time-of-flight positron emission tomography (TOF-PET). However, the theory about the timing resolution of SiPM-based detectors is not yet fully understood. Here we propose a comprehensive statistical model to predict the timing resolution of SiPM-based scintillation detectors. It incorporates the relevant SiPM-related parameters (viz. the single cell electronic response, the single cell gain, the charge carrier transit time spread, and crosstalk) {{as well as the}} scintillation <b>pulse</b> rise and <b>decay</b> <b>times,</b> light yield, and energy resolution. It is shown that the proposed model reduces to the well-established Hyman model for timing with PMTs if the number of primary triggers (photoelectrons in case of a PMT) is Poisson distributed and crosstalk and electronic noise are negligible. The model predictions are validated by measurements of the coincidence resolving times (CRT) for 511 keV photons of two identical detectors as a function of SiPM bias voltage, for two different kinds of scintillators, namely LYSO:Ce and LaBr 3 : 5 %Ce. CRTs as low as 138 ps +/- 2 ps FWHM for LYSO:Ce and 95 ps +/- 3 ps FWHM for LaBr 3 : 5 %Ce were obtained, demonstrating the outstanding timing potential of SiPM-based scintillation detectors. These values were found to be in good agreement with the predicted CRTs of 140 ps FWHM and 95 ps FWHM, respectively. Utilizing the proposed model, it can be shown that the CRTs obtained in our experiments are mainly limited by photon statistics while crosstalk, electronic noise and signal bandwidth have relatively little influence...|$|R
