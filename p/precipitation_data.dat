40|$|Due to the {{complexity}} of monsoon systems and random behaviors of isotope tracers, conventional methods are not adequate for uncovering detailed information about monsoon activities from typically limited <b>precipitation</b> isotope <b>data.</b> We developed a new approach based on the entropy theory to analyze such data with a focus on the monsoon systems in China, dealing with {{the complexity}} of these systems and <b>data</b> deficiency. Using <b>precipitation</b> isotope <b>data</b> from 42 selected stations in and around China within the GNIP network, we computed entropies associated with D and O- 18.

The spatial variations of the D and O- 18 entropy in the study area revealed the origins, extents and pathways of the Chinese monsoon systems, as well as their interactions.

25|$|Opinions have {{differed}} as to {{the precise}} mechanism by which water had built up in such quantity and then had suddenly been released with such devastating consequences. For many years the accepted explanation was that proposed by Joseph Vallot. It was believed that meltwater had drained through the glacier and become trapped as an intraglacial cavity, i.e. as an underground lake within a crevasse which itself had then become enlarged and widened by the water. However, recent re-analysis of historic photographs, accounts and contemporary meteorological <b>precipitation</b> <b>data</b> and field measurements, including radar analysis and magnetic resonance imaging, has presented an alternative and more plausible mechanism in which meltwater collected {{much closer to the}} surface (as a supraglacial lake) in a period when the glacier had a negative mass balance (i.e. was experiencing year-on-year melting and retreat). Prior to 1878 the glacier would not have been well-visited, so any surface lake could have gone unnoticed, and after 1878 the glacier experienced a positive mass balance (i.e. year-on-year accumulation of snow and ice) which would have hidden the lake from view until the eventual outburst flood in 1892.|$|E

We simulate the limited spatial representation {{of light to}} moderate oceanic precipitation rates along ship tracks with respect to areal passive microwave satellite estimates using data from a subtropical island-based radar. The radar data serves to estimate the discrepancy between point-like and areal precipitation measurements. From the spatial discrepancy, two statistical adjustments are derived so that along-track <b>precipitation</b> ship <b>data</b> better represents areal precipitation estimates from satellite sensors. The first statistical adjustment uses the average duration of a precipitation event as seen along a ship track and the second adjustment uses the median-normalized along-track precipitation rate.
