5|$|Kačićs and Omiš {{citizens}} made a <b>peace</b> <b>treaty</b> <b>with</b> Venice in 1208, and {{the brothers}} Desislav, Radoš, Dragan, Bogdan and Sinko were mentioned by knez Sebena in the document. However, in February 1215, Kačićs were, for first time, cited for piracy. In 1220, the Hungarian-Croatian king Andrew II threatened retaliation with the royal army against knez Malduč and his relatives unless the piracy and heresy ended. In May 1221, Pope Honorius III sent legate Aconcius {{to the citizens}} of Split, among other cities, to prevent piracy and defend the Crusaders. In 1222, the pope sought help from residents of Dubrovnik against the activity of Bosnian heretics and Omiš pirates. His efforts, {{as well as those of}} Guncel, Archbishop of Split, resulted in a temporary <b>peace</b> <b>treaty</b> <b>with</b> Kačići Omišani (Cacecli Almesiani).|$|E
5|$|The Babonići and the Kőszegis made an {{alliance}} with the Dukes of Austria in January 1336. John of Bohemia, who claimed Carinthia from the Habsburgs, invaded Austria in February. CasimirIII of Poland came to Austria to assist him in late June. Charles soon joined them at Marchegg. The dukes sought reconciliation and signed a <b>peace</b> <b>treaty</b> <b>with</b> John of Bohemia in July. Charles signed a truce with them on 13December, and launched a new expedition against Austria early the next year. He forced the Babonići and the Kőszegis to yield, and the latter were also compelled to hand over to him their fortresses along the frontier in exchange for faraway castles. Charles's <b>peace</b> <b>treaty</b> <b>with</b> Albert and Otto of Austria, which was signed on 11September 1337, forbade both the dukes and Charles to give shelter to the other party's rebellious subjects.|$|E

5|$|The {{first known}} knez of Omiš, Nikola, was mentioned, {{along with his}} {{relatives}} and everyone under his lordship, in a <b>peace</b> <b>treaty</b> <b>with</b> Kotor from 1167. Knez Nikola's power and independence {{was strong enough to}} have Rogerije, the Archbishop of Split, executed in 1180. Family political influence at that time included Brač and Hvar, Breueco (Brenti, Brevko, Brečko)also of genus Kačićas well as the previous Šibenik iupanus (župan). Archbishop Rogerije, who also served Byzantine Emperor Manuel I Komnenos as representative governor of Croatia, had become involved in a dispute about an estate around Mosor. A conte Nicola Aprico, who was identified in two dispute settlements of Split during 1178–79, is considered to be the same knez Nikola. In 1190, Nikola established a <b>peace</b> <b>treaty</b> <b>with</b> Dubrovnik. Like the 1167 treaty with Kotor, the 1190 treaty granted safe and free navigation to Dubrovnik ships from Molunat to Orebić (Trstenica).|$|E

5|$|Although he {{was stopped}} at Kőszeg {{and failed to}} conquer Vienna, Suleiman {{additionally}} secured his possession in Hungary by conquering several forts, since Ferdinand and Charles evaded an open field battle. Immediately after the Ottoman withdrawal, Ferdinand reoccupied devastated territory in Austria and Hungary. Nevertheless, Suleiman concluded a <b>peace</b> <b>treaty</b> <b>with</b> Ferdinand in 1533, in Constantinople. The treaty confirmed the right of John Zápolya as a king of all Hungary, but recognised Ferdinand's possession of {{that part of the}} country that enjoyed the status quo.|$|E

5|$|Matthias convoked the Diet to make {{preparations}} for an anti-Ottoman campaign in 1466. For the same purpose, he received subsidies from Pope Paul II.
