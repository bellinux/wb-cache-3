RTC buried <b>piping</b> and <b>components</b> involve both active <b>piping</b> and <b>components</b> from currently operating nuclear facilities, such as the Advanced Test Reactor (ATR), and inactive lines from facilities undergoing D&D activities. The issue exists as to the proper methods to analyze and control hazards associated with D&D activities on facilities collocated with existing operating nuclear facilities, or future collocated facilities being considered with the resurgent nuclear industry. During initial characterization activities, it was determined that residual radioactive material in several inactive RTC lines and components could potentially exceed hazard category (HC) 3 thresholds. In addition, concerns were raised as to how to properly isolate active nuclear facility <b>piping</b> and <b>components</b> from those inactive lines undergoing RCRA actions, and whether the operating facility safety basis could be impacted. Work was stopped, and a potential inadequacy in the safety analysis (PISA) was declared, even though no clear safety basis existed for the inactive, abandoned lines and equipment. An unreviewed safety question (USQ) and an occurrence report resulted. A HC 3 or greater Nuclear Facility/Activity for the buried <b>piping</b> and <b>components</b> was also declared in the occurrence report. A qualitative hazard assessment was developed to evaluate the potential hazards associated with characterization activities, and any potential effects on the safety basis of the collocated RTC operating nuclear facilities.

Critical to this approach is that the assessment is implemented with frequency based formulations.

The approach relies on internationally recognized standards as the core technology, in particular the IEC 60534 - 8 - 3 control valve aerodynamic noise prediction standard and the fatigue assessment in design codes, such as the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel code.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to develop an analysis program which can accurately simulate ratcheting in <b>piping</b> <b>components</b> subjected to seismic or other cyclic loads. Ratcheting is defined as the accumulation of deformation in structures and materials with cycles.

The design and analysis methods in the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code for ratcheting of <b>piping</b> <b>components</b> are not well accepted by the practicing engineering community. This research project attempts to understand the ratcheting-fatigue failure mechanisms and improve analysis methods for ratcheting predictions. In the first step a state-of-the-art testing facility is developed for quasi-static cyclic and seismic testing of straight and elbow <b>piping</b> <b>components.</b> A systematic testing program to study ratcheting is developed. Some tests have already been performed an d the rest will be completed by summer' 99. Significant {{progress has been made in}} the area of constitutive modeling. A number of sophisticated constitutive models have been evaluated in terms of their simulations for a broad class of ratcheting responses. From the knowledge gained from this evaluation study two improved models are developed. These models are demonstrated to have promise in simulating ratcheting responses in <b>piping</b> <b>components.</b> Hence, implementation of these improved models in widely used finite element programs, ANSYS and/or ABAQUS, is in progress.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the estimation of}} the reliability levels associated with a cracked pipe found acceptable as per the failure assessment diagram (FAD) based acceptance criteria of ASME Section XI, Appendix H. This acceptance criterion is built on the concepts of fracture mechanics. The parameters which enter the acceptance criteria are piping geometry, applied loading, crack size, and the material properties (tensile and fracture). Most of these parameters are known to exhibit uncertainty in their values. The FAD used also has an associated modeling bias. The code addresses these uncertainties by providing a factor of safety on the applied load. The use of a common factor of safety {{for a variety of}} pipe sizes, crack configuration, load combination, and materials may not ensure consistent level of safety associated with the <b>piping</b> <b>component</b> being evaluated.

The realistic assessment of reliability also requires the assessment of modeling bias associated with the FAD.

A key feature of qualified fatigue monitoring is the measurement of realistic loads based on plant instrumentation and/or local temperature measurement.

The subsea structures, components and pipelines have to stand such high external hydrostatic pressure which becomes in some cases the governing design criteria rather than the well pressure and temperature. This study focuses on pipe induction bends, which is a vital element in any ultra deep water subsea system. Bends are mainly used in the tie-in spools to connect pipeline end structures to manifolds or to well head trees. A significant amount of work has been conducted to study the behaviour of pipe bends under internal pressure in the last 150 years for its widely used applications in power plants, processing facilities and generic industrial use, however, minimal work has been conducted for pipe bends under external pressure for its rare applications. Oil and gas explorations and developments started to increase the demand of better understanding the pipe bend behaviour under high external pressure.
