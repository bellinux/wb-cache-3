5|$|In the Period II, the finds {{excavated}} {{revealed that}} people had moved out from pit dwelling to structures built at the ground level. However, the <b>pits</b> <b>and</b> its associated chambers formed the base floor of the superstructure, which was made up by filling the <b>pits</b> <b>and</b> covering it with mud plaster, and occasionally painted in red ochre. Post-holes around the pits revealed that the superstructures were made of wood built over compacted Karewa soil floors.|$|E

5|$|Antlion larvae require loose soil, not {{necessarily}} but often sand. The larvae prefer dry places {{protected from the}} rain. When it first hatches, the tiny larva specialises in very small insects, but as it grows larger, it constructs larger <b>pits,</b> <b>and</b> thus catches larger prey, sometimes much larger than itself.|$|E

5|$|From the 12th century onwards, large mansions {{lined the}} Strand {{including}} several palaces and townhouses inhabited by bishops and royal courtiers, {{mainly on the}} south side, with their own river gates and landings directly on the Thames. The road was poorly maintained, with many <b>pits</b> <b>and</b> sloughs, and a paving order was issued in 1532 to improve traffic.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1941, a WPA crew {{excavated}} a number of lodges, cache <b>pits,</b> <b>and</b> graves at the site. Some testing and surface collecting were conducted in 1943. More recently, a magnetic survey was conducted over {{a portion of the}} village in 1982, and some testing was carried out in 1987.|$|E
5|$|The ore {{was easily}} located and worked from shallow <b>pits</b> <b>and</b> shafts, {{but once the}} usable upper {{deposits}} were removed, or if a mine shaft entered the bed too far below the surface, only unusable unconverted pyritic deposits were found.|$|E
25|$|The {{line between}} the George <b>Pit</b> <b>and</b> the NBR main line was laid in mixed gauge track, so that the output of George <b>Pit</b> <b>and</b> Alice <b>Pit</b> could be sent either to St David's or to the main line railway.|$|R

5|$|Despite its name, the Valley of the Kings also {{contains}} the tombs of favorite nobles {{as well as}} the wives and children of both nobles and pharaohs. Therefore, only about 20 of the tombs actually contain the remains of kings. The remains of nobles and of the royal family, together with unmarked <b>pits</b> <b>and</b> embalming caches, make up the rest. Around the time of Ramesses I (ca. 1301 BC) construction commenced in the separate Valley of the Queens.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{its life}} the site {{consisted}} of a single ditch encompassing an area of about , with two gateways, one in the south-west and another in the east; two more rings of ditches were added later. The north part of the fort was occupied by four-post structures, probably granaries, which were later replaced by storage <b>pits,</b> <b>and</b> in the south part, there were roundhouses in between granaries and storage pits. When Danebury {{was built in the}} 6th century BC, it coincided with the construction of several other hillforts in the Wessex region, all of a similar size and layout.|$|E
5|$|In 1992 {{an attempt}} was made to extract a {{mitochondrial}} DNA sequence from the skeletal remains of C.d.guildayi to compare its relationship to other Canis species. The attempt was unsuccessful because these remains had been removed from the LaBrea <b>pits</b> <b>and</b> tar could not be removed from the bone material. In 2014 an attempt to extract DNA from a Columbian mammoth from the tar pits also failed, with the study concluding that organic compounds from the asphalt permeate the bones of all ancient samples from the LaBrea pits, hindering the extraction of DNA samples.|$|E
5000|$|The term <b>pit</b> <b>and</b> gallows or furca and fossa, {{refers to}} the 'high justice' rights of a feudal baron, etc., {{including}} the capital penalty. The right is described in full as <b>pit</b> <b>and</b> gallows, sake and soke, toll, team, and infangthief.|$|R

50|$|What {{aspects of}} <b>pit</b> <b>and</b> mounds can be {{generalized}} and what effects they exert of the dynamism {{of the forest}} can be generalized is a currently evolving narrative. As more scientific literature crops up from around the world, it becomes more apparent what aspects of the <b>pit</b> <b>and</b> mounds occur in most any biome they are found in. As it is, {{there is not enough}} scientific data to allow much extrapolation from forest to forest in regard to <b>pit</b> <b>and</b> mound knowledge.|$|R
5|$|Military {{units are}} {{produced}} at specific buildings {{relevant to their}} area. All sea units are created at the docks. Walls and towers are defensive fortifications (Age of Empires {{was one of the}} first real-time strategy games to include walls strong enough to form a feasible means of defense). Farms are used to produce food. Granaries, storage <b>pits,</b> <b>and</b> the Town Center are used to store resources deposited by the villagers.|$|E
5|$|Morchella importuna is {{a species}} of fungus in the family Morchellaceae {{described}} from North America in 2012. It occurs in gardens, woodchip beds, and other urban settings of northern California and the Pacific Northwest region of the United States and Canada. The fungus has also been reported from Turkey, Spain, France, Switzerland, Canada and China, although it is unknown {{whether this is a}} result of accidental introductions. It is considered a choice edible mushroom. The fruit bodies develop a distinctive ladder-like pattern of <b>pits</b> <b>and</b> ridges on the surface of their conical caps.|$|E
5|$|The Prospect Park Zoo {{closed to}} the public in June 1988. Over the next six months, new homes were found for the {{displaced}} animals in other zoos throughout the US. Demolition was managed by the Parks Department and began in June 1989, commencing what became nearly a five-year, $37 million effort, overrunning initial estimates by two years and $19 million. The exteriors of the Aymar Embury buildings were preserved, but badly deteriorated interiors were gutted, <b>pits</b> <b>and</b> cages were demolished, and new structures were built. The facilities were turned over to the NY Zoological Society in April 1993.|$|E
40|$|Caries {{is defined}} as one of {{microbiological}} disease on hard tissue that is indicated by demineralization  of non organic and decomposition of organic material that is cause pain on teeth. One of the preventive treatment that is effectively avoid caries is application of <b>pit</b> <b>and</b> fissure sealant. Material for application of <b>pit</b> <b>and</b> fissure sealant is Bis-GMA. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine differences fluoride contains in saliva before and after application of <b>pit</b> <b>and</b> fissure sealant. This research is a quasi experimental. Pre and post test with control group design was employed in the experimental design in this research. The subject of the research are pediatric patients which are treated in one of the dental clinic in Makassar. The patients are proposed and meet criteria for the measurement of fluoride concentration in their saliva. Fluoride concentrations in saliva were measured by using spectrophotometer (in ppm). The data was analyzed by using Wilcoxon Comparison in SPSS computer program. Mean levels of fluoride in the saliva before application of <b>pit</b> <b>and</b> fissure sealant in ppm (0. 085), and after application of <b>pit</b> <b>and</b> fissure sealant in ppm (0. 113). The results of Wilcoxon test indicated that there is a significant difference of fluoride concentration (p< 0. 05) before and after application of <b>pit</b> <b>and</b> fissure sealant. Application of <b>pit</b> <b>and</b> fissure sealant can be effectively used in increasing of fluoride concentration in saliva...|$|R

5|$|The basin {{entrance}} and passage were sited {{so that their}} foundations rested on hard rock. After the tide had been excluded, <b>pits</b> <b>and</b> borings were made to determine {{the nature of the}} bottom. A much narrower dock had been planned, but it was decided to move the south wall further south. A mole was added running along the middle of the dock, which increased the length of the quays.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} team began site excavation on March 3. Workers excavated artifacts {{dating to}} around 1150 AD. Fire <b>pits</b> <b>and</b> broken pieces of ceramic pans {{were found in}} the ground below what would be left field. Archaeologists believe the area was the site of a Native American settlement and that the artifacts were the remnants of a workshop where mineral water from underground sulfur-bearing springs was boiled to collect salt. The artifacts are on permanent display in the Tennessee State Museum's Mississippian Period exhibit. A portion of the property was used as a city cemetery in the 1800s. The interred were relocated.|$|E
5|$|The osteoderms (scutes) {{covering}} {{the back of}} Deinosuchus were unusually large, heavy, and deeply pitted; some were of a roughly hemispherical shape. Deep <b>pits</b> <b>and</b> grooves on these osteoderms served as attachment points for connective tissue. Together, the osteoderms and connective tissue would have served as load-bearing reinforcement to support the massive body of Deinosuchus out of water. These deeply pitted osteoderms {{have been used to}} suggest that, despite its bulk, Deinosuchus could probably have walked on land much like modern-day crocodiles.|$|E

The Cove {{has been shown to be}} around one thousand years older than the stone circles, so dating from 4000-3000 BCE. A variety of myths and legends about the stone circles have been recorded, including one about dancers at a celebration who have been turned to stone.|$|E
5|$|The {{trading area}} is {{surrounded}} by desks allowing workers to support transactions. In the early days, the desks served as a relay point between the <b>pits</b> <b>and</b> those wishing to buy or sell. When trade orders and information began to be communicated by telegraph, Morse code operators were employed, later replaced by phone operators. In the late 20th century, electric display boards lined {{the walls of the}} trading hall and the advent of electronic trading resulted in computers being placed on desktops.|$|E
5|$|After roll call, the Kommando, or work details, {{walked to}} {{their place of}} work, five abreast, wearing striped camp fatigues, no underwear, and ill-fitting wooden shoes without socks. A prisoner's {{orchestra}} (such as the Women's Orchestra of Auschwitz) was forced to play cheerful music as the workers left the camp. Kapos {{were responsible for the}} prisoners' behavior while they worked, as was an SS escort. The working day lasted 12 hours during the summer and a little less in the winter. Much of the work took place outdoors at construction sites, gravel <b>pits,</b> <b>and</b> lumber yards. No rest periods were allowed. One prisoner was assigned to the latrines to measure the time the workers took to empty their bladders and bowels.|$|E
