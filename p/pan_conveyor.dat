40|$|The U. S. Bureau of Mines in {{cooperation}} with Jim Walter Resources, Inc. (JWR), Brookwood, AL, evaluated the use of sheathed explosive charges in breaking up large stones that can jam the feeder 2 or <b>pan</b> <b>conveyor</b> on longwalls and halt operations. Use of the sheathed charge reduced the downtime of the longwall panel to 15 to 30 min {{as compared with the}} 1 to 2 h required to drill and shoot the stone. Firing the sheathed charge at the face caused no significant damage to Iongwall equipment. Use of the sheathed charge also represented an improvement in safety by eliminating the exposure of miners to the inherent hazards of the face for extended periods of time. Another benefit, which is difficult to quantify, is the elimination of the temptation to shoot mudcaps or adobes, which is illegal in U. S. underground coal mines...|$|E
5000|$|A Vibrating Conveyor is {{a machine}} {{with a solid}} {{conveying}} surface which is turned up on the side to form a trough. They are used extensively in food grade applications where sanitation, washdown, and low maintenance are essential. Vibrating conveyors are also suitable for harsh, very hot, dirty, or corrosive environments. They {{can be used to}} convey newly cast metal parts which may reach upwards of [...] Due to the fixed nature of the conveying <b>pans</b> vibrating <b>conveyors</b> can also perform tasks such as sorting, screening, classifying and orienting parts. Vibrating conveyors have been built to convey material at angles exceeding 45° from horizontal using special pan shapes. Flat pans will convey most materials at a 5° Incline from horizontal line.|$|R
40|$|Cost effective, safe, and technologically sound {{applications}} of automation technology to underground coal mining were identified. The longwall analysis commenced {{with a general}} search for government and industry experience of mining automation technology. A brief industry survey was conducted to identify longwall operational, safety, and design problems. The prime automation candidates resulting from the industry experience and survey were: (1) the shearer operation, (2) shield and <b>conveyor</b> <b>pan</b> line advance, (3) a management information system to allow improved mine logistics support, and (4) component fault isolation and diagnostics to reduce untimely maintenance delays. A system network analysis indicated that a 40 % improvement in productivity was feasible if system delays associated {{with all of the}} above four areas were removed. A technology assessment and conceptual system design of each of the four automation candidate areas showed that state of the art digital computer, servomechanism, and actuator technologies could be applied to automate the longwall system...|$|R
