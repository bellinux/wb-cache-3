5|$|Horses have a {{great sense}} of balance, due <b>partly</b> <b>to</b> their ability to feel their footing and <b>partly</b> <b>to</b> highly {{developed}} proprioception—the unconscious sense of where the body and limbs are at all times. A horse's sense of touch is well developed. The most sensitive areas are around the eyes, ears, and nose. Horses are able to sense contact as subtle as an insect landing anywhere on the body.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} songs written by Mendelssohn's sister Fanny {{originally}} appeared under her brother's name; {{this may have}} been partly due to the prejudice of the family, and <b>partly</b> <b>to</b> her own retiring nature.|$|E
5|$|Because with Calcraft's methods the {{condemned}} took several minutes to die, to hasten death Calcraft would sometimes dramatically pull on legs or climb on shoulders {{in an effort}} to break a victim's neck. It has been speculated that Calcraft used these methods <b>partly</b> <b>to</b> entertain the crowds, sometimes numbering 30,000 spectators or more.|$|E
500|$|This may be <b>partly</b> due <b>to</b> lack of {{attention}} paid to clinical application by Bowlby himself and <b>partly</b> due <b>to</b> broader meanings of the word 'attachment' used amongst practitioners. It may also be <b>partly</b> due <b>to</b> the mistaken association of attachment theory with the pseudoscientific interventions misleadingly known as [...] "attachment therapy".|$|R
50|$|Lituya Mountain is {{not often}} climbed, <b>partly</b> due <b>to</b> its {{proximity}} to the higher and better-known Mount Fairweather, and <b>partly</b> due <b>to</b> difficult access and bad weather in the Fairweather Range.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the modern}} period, Jewish ethics sprouted many offshoots, <b>partly</b> due <b>to</b> {{developments}} in modern ethics and <b>partly</b> due <b>to</b> {{the formation of}} Jewish denominations. Trends in modern Jewish normative ethics include: ...|$|R
5|$|His brother Eddie {{was on the}} {{football}} team, and Payton did not play <b>partly</b> <b>to</b> avoid competing with him.

5|$|In September 1833, Governor Irwin sailed for London, <b>partly</b> <b>to</b> {{give his}} own account of the {{events leading up to}} the killing. This was an unusual measure, {{especially}} given his regiment was about to leave for a tour of duty in India. The Colonial Office indicated satisfaction with Irwin's administration of the colony.|$|E
50|$|Mount Salisbury is {{not often}} climbed, <b>partly</b> due <b>to</b> its {{proximity}} to the higher and better-known Mount Fairweather, and <b>partly</b> due <b>to</b> difficult access and the typically bad weather that this range ironically possesses.|$|R

50|$|The name NADS arose <b>partly</b> due <b>to</b> referee {{comments}} on the original article (ADS is already used widely in Astronomy, the authors should use a different acronym), and <b>partly</b> due <b>to</b> tongue-in-cheek discussions over coffee.|$|R
5|$|In late 1928, Auden left Britain {{for nine}} months, going to Berlin, <b>partly</b> <b>to</b> rebel against English repressiveness. In Berlin, he first {{experienced}} {{the political and}} economic unrest that became one of his central subjects.|$|E
5|$|In the 1920s Thomas Graham Jackson {{redesigned}} the Norman Chapel into a War Memorial Chapel, now Gethsemane Chapel, {{and added}} a cloister. New quire screens were installed in 2004, <b>partly</b> <b>to</b> improve the acoustics, topped with 12 carved angels playing musical instruments.|$|E
5|$|Dave Pear, the Buccaneers' first Pro Bowl {{selection}} and most popular player, {{was traded to}} the Oakland Raiders for two draft picks. This was <b>partly</b> <b>to</b> get extra help in what was expected to be a strong offensive draft, but also because Pear had requested that he be traded if his contract could not be renegotiated. Dave Green, the punter and kicker through the first three seasons, had to be replaced when he tore his achilles tendon stepping over a tackling dummy in training camp.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{the visit}} came <b>to</b> nothing, <b>partly</b> due <b>to</b> {{the very high}} cost of coal, and <b>partly</b> due <b>to</b> the discontent about mechanisation, which would culminate in the later Luddite Movement. A letter in 1785 from Thomas states ...|$|R
50|$|However, as {{indicated}} by the charts below, household income has still increased significantly since the late 1970s and early 80s in real terms, <b>partly</b> due <b>to</b> higher individual median wages, and <b>partly</b> due <b>to</b> increased opportunities for women.|$|R
50|$|The {{assembly}} {{was conducted}} in Norwegian, <b>partly</b> due <b>to</b> Norwegian-speaking guests, and <b>partly</b> due <b>to</b> the difference between the Northern Sami and Southern Sami languages.

5|$|Furthermore, the {{political}} climate {{in the aftermath of}} Elagabalus' reign, as well as Dio's own position within the government of Alexander likely influenced the truth of this part of his history for the worse. Dio regularly refers to Elagabalus as Sardanapalus, <b>partly</b> <b>to</b> distinguish him from his divine namesake, but chiefly to do his part in maintaining the damnatio memoriae and to associate him with another autocrat notorious for a dissolute life.|$|E
5|$|In March 1965, a NOTAM {{was issued}} of changes {{had been made}} into the {{arrangements}} for light aircraft crossing the Channel. These changes were <b>partly</b> <b>to</b> avoid conflict with traffic flying into Lydd (Ferryfield). Non-radio aircraft could use the route between Hythe and Ambleteuse. Non-radio aircraft were advised to call at Lympne before crossing. On 11 July, one of Skyways Coach Air's Avro 748s crashed on landing at Lympne.|$|E
5|$|None of {{the three}} telescopes was constructed, {{although}} several design {{studies were carried out}} and some scale models were made. This was partly due to the changing political climate over the time (the period was from a Labour Party government under Harold Wilson to a Conservative Party one under Margaret Thatcher), and <b>partly</b> <b>to</b> the financial constraints of astronomical research in the UK at the time. Also, at a vital time, it became necessary to upgrade the Lovell Telescope to the Mark IA, which subsequently overran in terms of cost.|$|E
5000|$|The jus civile and the jus gentium are {{distinguished}} as follows. All people {{ruled by}} statutes and customs use a law <b>partly</b> peculiar <b>to</b> themselves, <b>partly</b> соmmon <b>to</b> all men. The law each people has settled on for itself is peculiar {{to the state}} itself, and is called jus civile, as being peculiar to that very state. The law {{that has come to}} be generally accepted among all men—the law that is guarded among all peoples quite alike—is called the jus gentium, [...] "and all nations use {{it as if it were}} the law.

50|$|Graeme Lee, the National Party MP for Matakana, {{left his}} party in 1994, <b>partly</b> due <b>to</b> policy {{disputes}} with its leadership and <b>partly</b> due <b>to</b> having lost his Cabinet post in a reshuffle.

5|$|On 27 November 1213 Norreis was {{appointed}} the prior of Penwortham Priory, a dependent priory of Evesham, <b>partly</b> <b>to</b> compensate {{him for the}} loss of the abbacy and <b>partly</b> <b>to</b> keep him from abandoning monastic life entirely. Norreis was deposed five months later owing to his continued bad morals and behaviour and again went to Rome in a bid to be restored to office. On this occasion he was unable to secure his reinstatement, but in 1218 or 1219 he was restored to Penwortham through the influence of the papal legate Pandulf Verraccio. Norries died on 16 July or 19 July, but there is disagreement over the year of his death. The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography states that he died in 1223, but the editors of Heads of Religious Houses: England and Wales, 940–1216 state he died in either 1224 or 1225. He was buried at Penwortham.|$|E
5|$|On September 7, 2004 the {{monument}} closed for a $15 million renovation, which included numerous security upgrades and redesign of {{the monument}} grounds by landscape architect Laurie Olin. The renovations were due <b>partly</b> <b>to</b> security concerns following the September 11 attacks {{and the start of}} the War on Terror. The monument reopened April 1, 2005, while the surrounding grounds remained closed until the landscape was finished later that summer.|$|E
5|$|On {{the evening}} of 4 December 1979, 22-year-old Teresa DeSimone had been working as a {{part-time}} barmaid in the Tom Tackle public house (now called The Encore public house) in Commercial Road, Southampton. By day she was employed as a full-time clerk for the Southern Gas Board. She had been employed at the pub {{for less than a}} month, working two evenings each week, <b>partly</b> <b>to</b> widen her social circle and <b>partly</b> <b>to</b> supplement her income to pay for the Ford Escort car that she had bought three months previously. The pub was located centrally in the city, only 50yards (46metres) from the police station and law courts, and near the city's central train station and the Gaumont Theatre (now The Mayflower). When her shift at the Tom Tackle ended at 23:00 (11:00p.m.) she went on to a night club in nearby London Road, in the company of her friend Jenni Savage. Although the discothèque was a relatively short distance from the public house, they travelled in Savage's car, leaving DeSimone's Ford Escort in the pub car park.|$|E

25|$|A {{range of}} new characters, {{who had been}} {{introduced}} in the storyline connected to Iris's move, also moved to the new series. To accommodate Texas, Another World went back to 60 minutes, and was moved from 2:30PM to 2:00PM. Two million viewers defected from AW, <b>partly</b> due <b>to</b> McKinsey's departure, <b>partly</b> due <b>to</b> the time change, and <b>partly</b> due <b>to</b> the influx of new characters who then moved to Texas. Because of the audience erosion, the move to 90-minute installments is generally regarded as a failure.|$|R
500|$|Nelson accused Orr of profligate spending, {{noting that}} the state budget had {{increased}} by 40% {{during the first three}} years of her governorship. [...] Orr's campaign responded that the steep increase was <b>partly</b> due <b>to</b> essential spending deferred during the nationwide recession of the early 1980s and the farm recession of the mid-80s; <b>partly</b> due <b>to</b> the state takeover of the welfare system, which had previously received some of its funding from the counties; and <b>partly</b> due <b>to</b> a 65% increase in Medicaid costs.|$|R
5|$|The 1980s and 1990s {{were a very}} unsafe {{time for}} bulk carriers. Many bulkers sank during this time, 99 were lost between 1990 and 1997 alone. Most of these sinkings were sudden and quick, making it {{impossible}} for the crew to escape: more than 650 sailors were lost during this same period. Due <b>partly</b> <b>to</b> the sinking of , a series of international safety resolutions regarding bulkers were adopted during the 1990s.|$|E

Accordingly, Secretariat's last race was against older {{horses in the}} Canadian International Stakes over one and five-eighths miles on the turf at Woodbine Racetrack in Toronto, Ontario, Canada on October 28, 1973. The race was chosen {{in part because of}} long-time ties between E.P. Taylor and the Chenery family, and <b>partly</b> <b>to</b> honor Secretariat's Canadian connections, Laurin and Turcotte. Unfortunately, Turcotte missed the race with a five-day suspension: Eddie Maple got the mount.|$|E
5|$|After {{learning}} more about Devarakota and Sashi's tyranny, Harsha announces that he will adopt the village and develop it. While he works to improve conditions in the village, Ratnam asks Sashi also to develop the village, <b>partly</b> <b>to</b> win in the upcoming elections, but he remains silent regarding his intention to gain credit for doing so. At the same time, Harsha comes to know from Rao that, as a young man, Ravikanth, wishing, as Harsha does now, to see the village developed, established a dairy farm for the locals' welfare. After the farm was set up, Ratnam and Sashi set it on fire, causing the death of many, and Ravikanth was blamed for the fire, insulted, and arrested. He {{walked out of the}} village, moved to the city, and went on to acquire much wealth.|$|E
