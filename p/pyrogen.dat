25|$|A <b>pyrogen</b> is a {{substance}} that induces fever. These can be either internal (endogenous) or external (exogenous) to the body. The bacterial substance lipopolysaccharide (LPS), present in the cell wall of gram-negative bacteria, {{is an example of}} an exogenous <b>pyrogen.</b> Pyrogenicity can vary: In extreme examples, some bacterial pyrogens known as superantigens can cause rapid and dangerous fevers. Depyrogenation may be achieved through filtration, distillation, chromatography, or inactivation.|$|E
25|$|Temperature is {{ultimately}} regulated in the hypothalamus. A trigger of the fever, called a <b>pyrogen,</b> causes {{a release of}} prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). PGE2 then in turn acts on the hypothalamus, which generates a systemic response back {{to the rest of}} the body, causing heat-creating effects to match a new temperature level.|$|E

[...] Wood was an early participant in the Army Epidemiological Board. [...] He was part of a group that published an early paper on penicillin in 1943. [...] He worked on the mechanism of recovery from pneumonia and was noted for early work on surface phagocytosis, research into the pathogenesis of fever, and endogenous <b>pyrogen</b> (now known as interleukin-1).|$|E

40|$|In {{experiments}} {{designed to}} elucidate the {{mechanism by which}} tolerance to bacterial <b>pyrogens</b> is developed, the following observations were made: 1. Animals whose febrile reactions to bacterial <b>pyrogens</b> were markedly diminished, {{as a result of}} repeated injections, showed increases in response following R-E blockade. 2. Pyrogenic substances disappeared from the circulating blood more rapidly in rabbits rendered pyrogen-tolerant than in normal animals. Lack of specificity was shown by the fact that rabbits previously injected with Eberthella typhosa bacterial vaccine were able to remove the <b>pyrogens</b> of Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa from their blood more rapidly than normal animals. 3. R-E blockade-retarded the speed of disappearance of <b>pyrogens</b> from the circulating blood of animals which had been rendered relatively tolerant by previous injections of these substances.

2500|$|In essence, all {{endogenous}} pyrogens are cytokines, {{molecules that}} {{are a part of}} the immune system. [...] They are produced by activated immune cells and cause the increase in the thermoregulatory set point in the hypothalamus. Major endogenous pyrogens are interleukin 1 (α and β) and interleukin 6 (IL-6). Minor endogenous pyrogens include interleukin-8, tumor necrosis factor-β, macrophage inflammatory protein-α and macrophage inflammatory protein-β as well as interferon-α, interferon-β, and interferon-γ. Tumor necrosis factor-α also acts as a <b>pyrogen.</b> It is mediated by interleukin 1 (IL-1) release.|$|E
2500|$|The {{primary role}} of TNF {{is in the}} {{regulation}} of immune cells. TNF, being an endogenous <b>pyrogen,</b> is able to induce fever, apoptotic cell death, cachexia, inflammation and to inhibit tumorigenesis and viral replication and respond to sepsis via IL1 & IL6 producing cells. [...] Dysregulation of TNF production has been implicated {{in a variety of}} human diseases including Alzheimer's disease, cancer, major depression, psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Though controversial, studies of depression and IBD are currently being linked to TNF levels. [...] Recombinant TNF is used as an immunostimulant under the INN tasonermin. TNF can be produced ectopically in the setting of malignancy and parallels parathyroid hormone both in causing secondary hypercalcemia and in the cancers with which excessive production is associated.|$|E

50|$|Electric matches {{consist of}} two parts, a bridgewire and a <b>pyrogen.</b> The bridgewire is a heating element, {{typically}} {{in the form}} of a loop or coil of thin wire, which is encased in the <b>pyrogen,</b> which is a quantity of readily ignited pyrotechnic initiator composition. If the <b>pyrogen</b> is sufficiently conductive, it can act as the bridgewire as well. Electric matches also come with provisions for attaching an electric current source, and they may be provided with a protective cover and/or a means to attach them to the device to be ignited.|$|E
50|$|To operate an {{electric}} match, {{a source of}} electricity of appropriate voltage and current is needed to provide current to the match.

5000|$|A [...] {{is defined}} as any {{substance}} that can cause a fever. Bacterial <b>pyrogens</b> include endotoxins and exotoxins, although many <b>pyrogens</b> are endogenous to the host. Endotoxins include lipopolysaccharide (LPS) molecules found {{as part of the}} cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria, and are released upon bacterial cell lysis. Endotoxins may become pyrogenic when released into the bloodstream or other tissue where they are not usually found. Although the colon contains Gram-negative bacteria in abundance, they do not cause a pyrogenic effect as the bacteria are not undergoing gross lysis, and the immune system is not exposed to free endotoxin while the colonic wall is intact.|$|R

It was found that nonstimulated human PBMC proliferate under in vitro conditions and produce IL- 6, TNF-α, IL- 10 and finally also IL- 1 β. Productions of IL- 12 and INF-γ are not changed. Proliferation of PBMC is potentiated after incubation with LPS or live Borrelia.

40|$|<b>Pyrogens</b> are {{heterogeneous}} {{group of}} fever-inducing substances derived from Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, fungi, and viruses. They incite immune response by producing endogenous <b>pyrogens</b> such as prostaglandins and other proinflammatory cytokines like IL- 1 β, IL- 6, and TNF-α. The {{present study was}} to analyze the influence of cryopreservation in IL- 1 β release, a marker for inflammatory response from human lymphocytes, in response to exogenous pyrogenic stimulants. Lymphocytes isolated from pooled blood of multiple healthy individuals were cryopreserved in DMSO and glycerol for periods of 7, 14, 30, and 60 days and were challenged with LPS and LTA in vitro. The inflammatory cytokine, IL- 1 β release, was measured by ELISA method. It was observed that the release of IL- 1 β increases instantaneously after the initiation of incubation and reaches a maximum at 3 to 5 hours and then gradually decreases and gets stabilized for both <b>pyrogens.</b> Moreover it was also observed that the effect of cryoprotectants, DMSO (10 %) and glycerol (10 %), showed almost similar results for short-term storage, but DMSO-preserved lymphocytes yielded a better viability for long-term storage. Thus, the isolated cryopreserved lymphocytes system can be a promising approach for the total replacement/alteration to animal experimentation for pyrogenicity evaluation...|$|R
40|$|The {{intravenous}} injection of the PR 8 strain of influenza A virus, the Lee strain of influenza B, and the "B" strain of Newcastle disease virus produces fever in rabbits. This phenomenon {{has been studied}} in relation to certain in vitro properties of these viruses. Saline suspensions of virus prepared by centrifugation or elution from chicken erythrocytes produced fever. Fluids from {{which most of the}} virus particles had been removed were non-pyrogenic. Exposure to temperatures which destroyed the infectivity of the virus for chick embryos did not prevent fever. However, heating sufficient to destroy the hemagglutinin also rendered virus non-pyrogenic. The injection of erythrocytes onto which virus had been adsorbed produced fever. Heated virus adsorbed onto erythrocytes, which failed to elute, produced no elevation of temperature, although heated virus alone was pyrogenic. Neutralization of virus with specific immune serum prevented fever. Antipyrine was capable of abolishing the febrile response to virus. Certain differences between the febrile response in rabbits to the injection of viruses and that following bacterial <b>pyrogens</b> were noted. The period between injection and beginning of temperature rise is longer with virus than with bacterial <b>pyrogens.</b> Relatively low temperatures inactivate the fever-producing capacity of viruses, whereas bacterial <b>pyrogens</b> withstand prolonged autoclaving, and the neutralization of viral fever by specific immune serum contrasts sharply with the failure of antibody to affect the response to bacterial <b>pyrogens.</b> Certain previous observations on the lymphopenia produced in rabbits by the injection of influenzal viruses were confirmed. The capacity of virus preparations to induce fever in rabbits closely parallels their capacity to induce lymphopenia. It was concluded that the fever-producing property of influenzal viruses is closely associated with the capacity to agglutinate erythrocytes...|$|R
