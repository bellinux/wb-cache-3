This functionality is organized into four abstraction layers which classify all related protocols {{according to the}} scope of networking involved. From lowest to highest, the layers are the link layer, containing communication methods for data that remains within a single network segment (link); the internet layer, providing internetworking between independent networks; the transport layer handling host-to-host communication; and the application layer, which provides process-to-process data exchange for applications.|$|E

2500|$|These {{standards}} {{are used for}} transmission of uncompressed, unencrypted digital video signals (optionally including embedded audio and time code) within television facilities; {{they can also be}} used for <b>packetized</b> data. Coaxial variants of the specification range in length but are typically less than [...] Fiber optic variants of the specification such as 297M allow for long-distance transmission limited only by maximum fiber length or repeaters. SDI and HD-SDI are usually available only in professional video equipment because various licensing agreements restrict the use of unencrypted digital interfaces, such as SDI, prohibiting their use in consumer equipment. Several professional video and HD-video capable DSLR cameras and all uncompressed video capable consumer cameras use the HDMI interface, often called clean HDMI. There are various mod kits for existing DVD players and other devices, which allow a user to add a serial digital interface to these devices.|$|E

40|$|Packetization {{is used in}} {{a variety}} of {{commercial}} multicomputers because of its potential performance advantages: higher throughput and a better distribution of message latencies. However, packetization has two significant drawbacks, 1) fragmentation and reassembly overhead and 2) increased traffic volume for routing and sequencing information. In this paper, we examine the performance benefits of packetization in existing dimension-order routed networks and in likely future router designs including adaptive routing and virtual lanes. Our studies show that packetization has a mixed effect on performance in dimension-order routers. <b>Packetizing</b> uniform-sized traffic reduces network throughput dramatically. However, if the traffic is a bimodal distribution of sizes, packetization reduces the variance of latencies for short messages, and increases the network's overall throughput. On the other hand, packetization has no significant impact on the performance of advanced networks with adaptive routing and virtual lanes. Advanced routers without packetization give nearly identical performance to the corresponding <b>packetizing</b> networks under uniform-sized or bimodal traffic. Packetization may be unnecessary in such networks. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—We {{study the}} problem of <b>packetizing</b> {{embedded}} multimedia bitstreams to improve the error resilience of source (compression) codes. This problem is important because of the increasing popularity of embedded compression methodology [1]–[7] and its suitability for scalable streaming media [8], [9] over IP or/and mobile IP. We study various packetization schemes against packet erasure at both low and high bit rates. Maximizing packetization efficiency for embedded bitstreams is formulated as a discrete optimization problem and globally optimal packetization (OP) algorithms are proposed under different settings. Suboptimal packetization algorithms are also devised to reduce {{the complexity of the}} OP algorithms. In order to assess their effectiveness, the proposed packetization algorithms are used to <b>packetize</b> embedded image and video bitstreams with simulated packet loss. Experimental results show that our OP algorithms slightly outperforms suboptimal ones. In addition to confirming the superiority of the OP algorithms, these results also provide justification of heuristic packetization methods published in the literature [10], [11].

On best-case data the system offered about 2:1 compression, but in general terms about 1.6:1 was typical, at least on text. As a result a 2400 bit/s modem would appear to transfer text at ~4000 bit/s.|$|R
