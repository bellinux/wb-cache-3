5|$|The {{presence}} {{of sexual activity}} between women as necessary to define a lesbian or a relationship continues to be debated. According to feminist writer Naomi McCormick, women's sexuality is constructed by men, whose <b>primary</b> <b>indicator</b> of lesbian sexual orientation is sexual experience with other women. The same indicator {{is not necessary to}} identify a woman as heterosexual, however. McCormick states that emotional, mental, and ideological connections between women are as important or more so than the genital. Nonetheless, in the 1980s, a significant movement rejected the desexualization of lesbianism by cultural feminists, causing a heated controversy called the feminist sex wars. Butch and femme roles returned, although not as strictly followed {{as they were in the}} 1950s. They became a mode of chosen sexual self-expression for some women in the 1990s. Once again, women felt safer claiming to be more sexually adventurous, and sexual flexibility became more accepted.|$|E

40|$|When {{evaluating}} entrepreneurship at {{the national}} level, the influence of {{small and medium-sized enterprises}} (SMEs) on the state economic development is analyzed. Also, the impact of significant factors (goods and services competitiveness, innovations, diversification, clusterization, creating social value, etc.) on SMEs working effectiveness (respectively improving the entrepreneurial efficiency) is investigated. When focused on the national economic competitiveness as a general criterion, the principles and models for consolidated quantitative estimation of national entrepreneurship development level are applicable for newly admitted EU countries (on account of some of their specific factors). The results of assessing the entrepreneurship level in 2009 - 2010 and the nearest future are presented in this study using Lithuania’s data as a typical case. The multicriteria estimation process includes the identification and expert examination, in addition to quantifiable assessment of essential <b>primary</b> <b>indicators.</b> Moreover, the pillar indexes underlying them and entrepreneurship development index using the significance parameters of <b>primary</b> <b>indicators</b> are determined by the authors. The relative impact of the different primary and partial criteria is taken into account by calculation of the integrated criterion–level index, which allows us to evaluate more adequate differences in newly EU countries. To improve the (World Economic Forum) WEF methodology, the authors are using various, not predetermined, weights of <b>primary</b> <b>indicators,</b> also indexes of performance and propose a more adequate differentiation of significances for the pillars. The complex evaluation of the <b>primary</b> <b>indicators</b> influencing business may be used for the strategic solutions reasoning...|$|R

25|$|Conspicuous leisure, or the {{non-productive}} use of {{time for}} the sake of displaying social status, is used by Veblen as the <b>primary</b> <b>indicator</b> of the leisure class. To engage in conspicuous leisure is to openly display one's wealth and status, as productive work signified the absence of pecuniary strength and was seen as a mark of weakness. As the leisure class increased their exemption from productive work, that very exemption became honorific and actual participation in productive work became a sign of inferiority. Conspicuous leisure worked very well to designate social status in rural areas, but urbanization made it so that conspicuous leisure was no longer a sufficient means to display pecuniary strength. Urban life requires more obvious displays of status, wealth, and power, which is where conspicuous consumption becomes prominent.|$|E
25|$|After {{the split}} with the Western World and {{synthesis}} with Nestorianism, the Church of the East expanded rapidly due to missionary works during the Medieval period. During {{the period between}} 500–1400 the geographical horizons of the Church of the East extended well beyond its heartland in present-day northern Iraq, north eastern Syria and south eastern Turkey. Communities sprang up throughout Central Asia, and missionaries from Assyria and Mesopotamia took the Christian faith as far as China, with a <b>primary</b> <b>indicator</b> of their missionary work being the Nestorian Stele, a Christian tablet written in Chinese script found in China dating to 781 AD. Their most important conversion, however, was of the Saint Thomas Christians of the Malabar Coast in India, {{as they are now}} the largest group of non ethnically Assyrian Christians on earth, with around 10 million followers when all denominations are added together and their own diaspora is included. The St Thomas Christians were believed by tradition to have been converted by St Thomas, and were in communion with the Church of the East {{until the end of the}} medieval period.|$|E

500|$|According to many academics, the Court of Chancery {{really began}} {{to expand its}} {{caseload}} during the 15th century; Margaret Avery reports a massive increase in cases during the 1440s, while Nicholas Pronay suggests that the real expansion came during Yorkist rule (1461–85), {{when the number of}} cases submitted each year quadrupled. He gives complaints about the perversion of justice in the common law courts, along with growing mercantile and commercial interests, as the main reason for the growth, arguing that this was the period when the Chancery changed from being an administrative body with some judicial functions to [...] "one of the four central courts of the realm... the {{growth in the number of}} [...] is a <b>primary</b> <b>indicator</b> of the changing position of Chancery". This increasing role was assisted by the changing function of the court: until the late 14th century, private parties could not bring cases to the Chancery as they could to the other courts, while by the 15th century the number of private cases had increased to the point where there were many complaints in Parliament. Marsh writes that another reason for the Chancery's growing influence was the remedies available; through orders of specific performance and injunctions, the Court could not only rectify previous wrongs but prevent future wrongs from occurring, while the common law courts were limited to awarding damages.|$|E

This itself {{is often referred to as}} the [...] "checked" [...] or [...] "entering" [...] tone, following Chinese nomenclature. It can be realised as a geminate of a following stop, although this is purely allophonic and optional as the difference between the sequence /VʔtV/ and /VtːV/ is only in the catch, and thus barely audible.

40|$|The River Values Assessment System (RiVAS) {{was applied}} to the river value ‘water use for {{domestic}} purposes’ in Gisborne District, to identify rivers of relatively higher and lower importance for this value. Two national level experts in the field assisted with identifying an initial list of <b>primary</b> <b>indicators</b> that best describe the value – this list was subsequently revised by the local expert value and indicators attached. The final list of six <b>primary</b> <b>indicators</b> is: 1. Number of residents supplied; 2. Quantity and reliability of supply; 3. Chemical/ physical; 4. Microbiological; 5. Climate change; and 6. Cost. Ten rivers were assessed by an expert panel: two, the Te Arai and the Mangapoike Dams stream complex are of national significance mainly because they are the principal water supply for Gisborne city. Three rivers were assessed for their restoration potential via RiVAS+, namely the Waiapu, Mangahauini and Waitakeao. The same two interventions were identified for each, i. e., •	Improve riparian habitat - Pest control •	Enhance water quality - Remove/fence out stock. ‘Investing’ in these interventions would improve the score for each river but not move them out of their local significance classification...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to present an {{approach}} for an integrated evaluation of the sustainability of pig farming systems, taking into account the three classical pillars: economy, environment and society. Eight sustainability themes were considered: Animal Welfare (AW), Animal Health (AH), Breeding Programmes (BP), Environment (EN), Meat Safety (MS), Market Conformity (MC), Economy (EC) and Working Conditions (WC). A total of 37 <b>primary</b> <b>indicators</b> were identified and used for the evaluation of 15 much contrasted pig farming systems in five EU countries. The results show that the eight themes were not redundant and all contributed to the observed variation between systems. The tool was very robust for highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of the systems along the eight themes that were considered. The number of <b>primary</b> <b>indicators</b> could be reduced from 37 to 18 with limited impact on the strengths/weaknesses profile of the individual systems. Integrating the eight theme evaluations into a single sustainability score is based on hypotheses or presumptions on the relative weights that should be given to the eight themes, which are very dependent on the context and on the purpose of the users of the tool. Therefore, the present paper does not have the ambition to provide a ready-for-use tool, rather to suggest an approach for the integrated evaluation of the sustainability of pig farming systems...|$|R
