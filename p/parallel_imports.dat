25|$|Patents {{have been}} criticized in the {{developing}} world, as they are thought to reduce access to existing medicines. Reconciling patents and universal access to medicine would require an efficient international policy of price discrimination. Moreover, under the TRIPS agreement of the World Trade Organization, countries must allow pharmaceutical products to be patented. In 2001, the WTO adopted the Doha Declaration, which indicates that the TRIPS agreement should be read {{with the goals of}} public health in mind, and allows some methods for circumventing pharmaceutical monopolies: via compulsory licensing or <b>parallel</b> <b>imports,</b> even before patent expiration.|$|E
2500|$|Vardenafil was co-marketed by Bayer Pharmaceuticals, GlaxoSmithKline, and Schering-Plough {{under the}} trade name Levitra. As of 2005, the co-promotion rights of GSK on Levitra have been {{returned}} to Bayer in many markets outside the U.S. In Italy, Bayer sells vardenafil as Levitra and GSK sells it as Vivanza. [...] Thus, because of European Union trade rules, <b>parallel</b> <b>imports</b> might result in Vivanza sold next to Levitra in the EU.|$|E

40|$|Investigations {{into the}} causes and effects of <b>parallel</b> <b>importing</b> have {{concentrated}} on price discrimination but arbitrage can also occur on non-price dimensions. Using a natural experiment in the New Zealand film distribution industry between May 1998 and November 2001 we {{examine the effect of}} <b>parallel</b> <b>importing</b> on quality {{as it relates to the}} timing of the availability of film media. We demonstrate that a) cinema revenues were undermined as consumers substituted viewing films on <b>parallel</b> <b>imported</b> DVDs for thecinema format and b) that studios responded to the threat of <b>parallel</b> <b>imported</b> DVDs by bringing forward the release of films into New Zealand cinemas. The reduced delay between US and New Zealand cinematic release dates is shown to be consistent with the introduction of competition when timing is a dimension of quality and choice. We conclude that parallel importation of DVDs almost certainly resulted in a net increase in welfare in New Zealand...|$|R
