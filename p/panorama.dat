5|$|Although {{this portion}} of NY441 is {{surrounded}} by woodlands, it is actually located in a largely developed area of Penfield known locally as <b>Panorama.</b> The woods cease as NY441 approaches an interchange with <b>Panorama</b> Trail (NY153), the lone limited-access junction along the divided highway. East of NY153, NY441 crosses over Irondequoit Creek and downgrades to a four-lane undivided highway at a junction with Penfield Road.

40|$|Image <b>panoramas</b> are of {{importance}} for virtual navigation in remote or synthetic environments. To process these <b>panoramas,</b> different representations have been proposed; this paper presents a study of cubic <b>panoramas.</b> Standard projective geometry concepts are adapted to cubic <b>panoramas</b> to derive the notions of fundamental matrix, essential matrix and the equivalent of stereo rectification. Methods and results are presented which could be very helpful in obtaining solutions to disparity estimation, pose estimation and view interpolation problems {{in the context of}} cubic <b>panoramas.</b> ...|$|R

5|$|Archaeologists have mapped 268 {{structures}} {{clustered in}} 53 groups around approximately 68 patios in the site core. Residential structures were {{concentrated in the}} area surrounding the ceremonial centre, especially on {{the north and west}} sides near to the reservoir. Residences tended to be larger the closer they were to the reservoir. The residential area of El Chal was extensive and archaeologists have divided it into four sectors. Municipal consists of the area occupied by the modern village, El Arrepentimiento is the northeastern portion of the site, <b>Panorama</b> is the northwestern area, and Central is the site core. Central El Chal contains 25 groups, Arrepentimiento contains 40 groups, <b>Panorama</b> contains 53 groups and Municipal contains 18 groups. <b>Panorama</b> was an area of chert production while Municipal is associated with the ritual complex of the city.|$|E

40|$|A new {{approach}} to computing a panoramic (360 degrees) depth map is presented in this paper. Our approach uses a large collection of images taken by a camera whose motion has been constrained to planar concentric circles. We resample regular perspective images to produce a set of multiperspective <b>panoramas</b> and then compute depth maps directly from these resampled <b>panoramas.</b> Our <b>panoramas</b> sample uniformly in three dimensions: rotation angle, inverse radial distance, and vertical elevation. The use of multiperspective <b>panoramas</b> eliminates the limited overlap present in the original input images and, thus, problems as in conventional multibaseline stereo can be avoided. Our approach differs from stereo matching of single-perspective panoramic images taken from different locations, where the epipolar constraints are sine curves. For our multiperspective <b>panoramas,</b> the epipolar geometry, to the first order approximation, consists of horizontal lines. Therefore, any traditional stereo algorithm {{can be applied to}} multiperspective <b>panoramas</b> with little modification. In this paper, we describe two reconstruction algorithms. The first is a cylinder sweep algorithm that uses a small number of resampled multiperspective <b>panoramas</b> to obtain dense 3 D reconstruction. The second algorithm, in contrast, uses a large number of multiperspective <b>panoramas</b> and takes advantage of the approximate horizontal epipolar geometry inherent in multiperspective <b>panoramas.</b> It comprises a novel and efficient 1 D multibaseline matching technique, followed by tensor voting to extract the depth surface. Experiments show that our algorithms are capable of producing comparable high quality depth maps which can be used for applications such as view interpolation...|$|R
