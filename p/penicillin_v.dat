Sulfhydryl-containing compounds were required for activity. Dithiothreitol, dithioerythritol, mercaptoethanol, and glutathione served as activators. The acyltransferase was purified threefold by adsorption on calcium phosphate gel at pH 6 and elution at pH 8. The partially purified enzyme showed maximal activity at pH 8. The enzyme was stable at 25 C for at least 30 min at pH 8. Dissociable inhibitors or activators, other than the sulfhydryl-containing compounds, could not be demonstrated in the enzyme preparation. An apparent Michaelis constant of 1. 5 ± 0. 5 mm was determined for penicillin G at a 6 -APA concentration of 5 mm. The enzyme {{did not appear to}} possess penicillin amidase activity.

Between October 1991 and April 1993, a surveillance survey of antimicrobial resistance was performed at two fever hospitals in Egypt; nasopharyngeal swab and blood specimens obtained from 1, 635 children with pneumonia were cultured for these organisms. Susceptibility testing of these organisms was performed.

Dr. Sheehan's research on synthetic penicillin paved the way for the development of customized forms of the lifesaving antibiotic that target specific bacteria. Over the four decades he worked at M.I.T., Sheehan came to hold over 30 patents, including the invention of ampicillin, a commonly used semi-synthetic penicillin that is taken orally rather than by injection.

5000|$|The {{side effects}} of {{penicillin}} [...] are bodily responses to penicillin and related antibiotics that do not relate directly to its effect on bacteria. A side effect is an effect that is not intended with normal dosaging. [...] Some of these reactions are visible and some occur in the body's organs or blood. Penicillins are a widely-used group of medications that are effective {{for the treatment of}} a wide variety of bacterial infections in human adults and children as well as other species. Some side effects are predictable, of which some are common but not serious, some are uncommon and serious and others are rare. The route of administration of penicillin can have an effect on the development of side effects. An example of this is irritation and inflammation that develops at a peripheral infusion site when penicillin is administered intravenously. In addition, penicillin is available in different forms. There are different penicillin medications (penicillin G benzathine, penicillin G potassium, penicillin G procaine, and <b>penicillin</b> <b>V)</b> as well as a number of β-lactam antibiotics derived from penicillin (e.g. amoxicillin) generally also referred to as [...] "penicillin".|$|E

5000|$|At the time, it {{was known}} that the {{molecular}} weight of penicillin was around 350 g/mol, which was {{within the range of}} molecules that had already been chemically synthesized. The problem was the making the chemically unstable beta-lactam ring that was crucial to the antibiotic properties of the molecule. Beta-lactam antibiotics inhibit the formation of the peptidoglycan layer of the cell walls of Gram-positive bacteria. Most of the scientists experienced failure after failure because [...] "the appropriate techniques and reactions for putting together the penicillin molecule simply had not yet been discovered." [...] In the words of Sheehan, using traditional methods at the time was like [...] "placing an anvil on top of a house of cards."

During the process, he had also produced an intermediate, 6-aminopenicillanic acid, which was later used as a foundation for preparing a variety of penicillins. This allowed researchers to combat the resistance that certain bacteria had developed to particular forms of the drug. Sheehan later published his involvement in the synthesis of penicillins in The Enchanted Ring: The Untold Story of Penicillin, which noted a complex legal skirmish over his patents on penicillin synthesis involving M.I.T. and Beecham, a British industrial research laboratory that was also working on penicillins.|$|E

This study aimed to assess the efficacy of ceftriaxone and doxycycline/tetracycline in treating early syphilis relative to that of penicillin, and thereby to determine which antibiotic is a better replacement for penicillin. By searching literature from PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, the Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials. gov and systematically screening relevant studies, eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies on treatments with penicillin, doxycycline/tetracycline, and ceftriaxone for early syphilis were identified and combined in this systematic review.

At 12 -month follow up, serological response rates were compared by a direct meta-analysis and network meta-analysis (NMA), while treatment failure rates were compared with a direct meta-analysis. Three RCTs and seven cohort studies were included in this research.
