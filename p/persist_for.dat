5|$|Deaths usually occur from {{respiratory}} failure or ventricular fibrillation secondary to ongoing seizure activity; fatalities have occurred {{within a few}} hours of ingestion. Poisoned people who recover usually regain consciousness and seizures cease within 24 to 48hours of poisoning, although seizures may <b>persist</b> <b>for</b> up to 96 hours. There are occasional long-term effects such as retrograde amnesia of the events leading to intoxication and the intoxication itself. Other ongoing mild effects may include restlessness, muscle weakness, twitching, and anxiety. Complete resolution of symptoms may take a number of days or, in some cases, these ongoing symptoms may <b>persist</b> <b>for</b> months after poisoning.|$|E
5|$|Final {{outcomes}} {{for people with}} SCSFLS remain poorly studied. Symptoms may resolve {{in as little as}} two weeks, or <b>persist</b> <b>for</b> months. Less commonly, patients may suffer from unremitting symptoms for many years. People with chronic SCSFLS may be disabled and unable to work. Recurrent CSF leak at an alternate site after recent repair is common.|$|E

5|$|By {{the early}} morning hours of August4, the NHC {{upgraded}} Tropical Depression Eight-E to Tropical Storm Felicia, the seventh named storm of the season. Located within an area of low wind shear and high sea surface temperatures, averaging between 28 and 29°C (82 and 84°F), the storm quickly developed, with deep convection persisting around the center of circulation. These conditions were anticipated to <b>persist</b> <b>for</b> at least three days; however, there was an increased amount of uncertainty due to possible interaction with Tropical Storm Enrique. Several hours later, the storm began to undergo rapid intensification, following the formation of an eye. Around 2:00pm PDT (2100UTC), Felicia intensified into a hurricane.|$|E
5|$|Gastroenteritis {{typically}} involves both {{diarrhea and}} vomiting, or less commonly, presents {{with only one}} or the other. Abdominal cramping may also be present.

5|$|In 2016, Cassini {{found the}} first {{evidence}} of fluid-filled channels on Titan, {{in a series of}} deep, steep-sided canyons flowing into Ligeia Mare. This network of canyons, dubbed Vid Flumina, range in depth from 240 to 570m and have sides as steep as 40°. They are believed to have formed either by crustal uplifting, like Earth's Grand Canyon, or a lowering of sea level, or perhaps a combination of the two. The depth of erosion suggests that liquid flows in this part of Titan are long-term features that <b>persist</b> <b>for</b> thousands of years.|$|E
5|$|Neptune's {{dark spots}} {{are thought to}} occur in the {{troposphere}} at lower altitudes than the brighter cloud features, so they appear as holes in the upper cloud decks. As they are stable features that can <b>persist</b> <b>for</b> several months, they are thought to be vortex structures. Often associated with dark spots are brighter, persistent methane clouds that form around the tropopause layer. The persistence of companion clouds shows that some former dark spots may continue to exist as cyclones even though they are no longer visible as a dark feature. Dark spots may dissipate when they migrate too close to the equator or possibly through some other unknown mechanism.|$|E
5|$|Reflections in {{more complex}} scenarios, such as {{found on a}} network of cables, can result in very {{complicated}} and long lasting waveforms on the cable.

Approximately 10% of patients experience a notable protracted withdrawal syndrome, which can <b>persist</b> <b>for</b> many months or in some cases a year or longer. Protracted symptoms tend to resemble those seen during the first couple of months of withdrawal but usually are of a sub-acute level of severity.

5|$|The hairpin banksia's {{infructescence}} is {{a typical}} Banksia cone-like structure, with up to 100 crowded embedded follicles which are 1–2.4centimetres (⅓–1in) in diameter; these generally remain closed until burnt by bushfire. The nonlignotuberous subspecies cunninghamii is killed by fire and regenerates from seed, while the others regenerate from buds {{around the base of}} the lignotuber. Old flower spikes fade to brown, then grey with age. Old flower parts usually <b>persist</b> <b>for</b> a long time, giving the infructescence a hairy appearance. In Central and North Queensland, old cones of both var.spinulosa and var.collina are generally bare.|$|E
50|$|Intermediate-term memory (ITM) is a {{stage of}} memory {{distinct}} from sensory memory, working memory/short-term memory, and long-term memory. While sensory memory <b>persists</b> <b>for</b> several milliseconds, working memory <b>persists</b> <b>for</b> up to thirty seconds, and long-term memory persists from thirty minutes {{to the end of}} an individual's life, intermediate-term memory <b>persists</b> <b>for</b> about two to three hours. This overlap in the durations of these memory processes indicates that they occur simultaneously, rather than sequentially. Indeed, intermediate-term facilitation can be produced in the absence of long-term facilitation. However, the boundaries between these forms of memory are not clear-cut, and they can vary depending on the task. Intermediate-term memory is thought to be supported by the parahippocampal cortex.|$|R

5|$|The {{intrinsic}} green luminescence of the cookiecutter shark is {{the strongest}} known of any shark, and {{has been reported to}} <b>persist</b> <b>for</b> three hours after it has been taken out of water. The ventrally positioned photophores serve to disrupt its silhouette from below by matching the downwelling light, a strategy known as counter-illumination, that is common among bioluminescent organisms of the mesopelagic zone. The individual photophores are set around the denticles and are small enough that they cannot be discerned by the naked eye, suggesting they have evolved to fool animals with high visual acuity and/or at close distances.|$|E
5|$|The {{life cycle}} of Chirocephalus diaphanus is {{extremely}} fast. The typical duration of a full life cycle is not known, but a figure of around 3 months has been suggested. The eggs are tolerant to drying out; when their habitat fills with water again, some of the eggs will hatch, while others remain dormant. This enables the species to continue to survive in an unpredictable habitat, since some eggs remain in case the habitat does not <b>persist</b> <b>for</b> {{long enough for the}} animals to mate and produce offspring. Dispersal between bodies of water can occur through the movements of animals such as cattle, deer and horses.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} {{ventricular}} fibrillation duration in humans on defibrillation efficacy {{as it pertains}} to the time of intervention of an automatic implantable defibrillator is unknown. If a difference in defibrillation efficacy exists in the early period after ventricular fibrillation onset, it may affect algorithms used by antiarrhythmic devices for arrhythmia detection and therapy. Therefore, a prospective, randomized evaluation was performed of the effect of ventricular fibrillation durations of 10 s and 20 s on defibrillation thresholds in 10 survivors of sudden cardiac arrest undergoing implantation of an automatic cardioverter defibrillator. The initial duration of ventricular fibrillation was chosen randomly. Subsequently, each patient served as his or her own control for the alternate duration of ventricular fibrillation to that chosen initially. The mean leading edge defibrillation threshold voltage was 411 ± 114 V when ventricular fibrillation <b>persisted</b> <b>for</b> 10 s and 419 ± 125 V when it <b>persisted</b> <b>for</b> 20 s (p = 0. 73). The mean defibrillation threshold current was 11. 4 ± 2. 8 A when ventricular fibrillation <b>persisted</b> <b>for</b> 10 s and 11. 4 ± 3. 2 A when it <b>persisted</b> <b>for</b> 20 s (p = 0. 97). The delivered energy defibrillation threshold was 11. 5 ± 5. 9 J when ventricular fibrillation <b>persisted</b> <b>for</b> 10 s and 12. 0 ± 6. 9 J when it <b>persisted</b> <b>for</b> 20 s (p = 0. 67). These findings show that the defibrillation threshold does not change between 10 and 20 s of ventricular fibrillation in out-of-hospital survivors of cardiac arrest at the time of surgical implantation of an automatic defibrillator. The data may have influence on the programming of defibrillator detection algorithms...|$|R

5|$|As {{a result}} of {{breaches}} in flood defenses around Ise Bay, seawater continued to pour into inundated areas after Vera's passage, slowing down repair efforts. One breach spanning 150km (93mi) across required 5,000personnel, 32,000sandbags, and bulldozers dispatched by the Japanese Ministry of Defense to relieve water flow. In Aichi's Ama District, reconstruction efforts for levees, roadways, and infrastructure lasted {{until the end of}} December1959. Due to losses sustained by the pearl industry as {{a result of}} the typhoon, Japanese pearl production in 1959 was expected to decrease by 30% in 1959, with production losses of 40% expected in 1960. Monetary losses to the industry were expected to eclipse US$15million, causing Japanese pearl costs to hike up by 20%. Furthermore, the effects of Vera on the country's pearl industry were expected to <b>persist</b> <b>for</b> two to three years.|$|E
5|$|Conditions on Titan {{could become}} far more {{habitable}} {{in the far}} future. Five billion years from now, as the Sun becomes a red giant, its surface temperature could rise enough for Titan to support liquid water on its surface, making it habitable. As the Sun's ultraviolet output decreases, the haze in Titan's upper atmosphere will be depleted, lessening the anti-greenhouse effect {{on the surface and}} enabling the greenhouse created by atmospheric methane to play a far greater role. These conditions together could create a habitable environment, and could <b>persist</b> <b>for</b> several hundred million years. This is proposed to have been sufficient time for simple life to spawn on Earth, though the presence of ammonia on Titan would cause chemical reactions to proceed more slowly.|$|E
