Further congestion {{led to another}} reconstruction in 1923. Numerous improvements were made {{as part of the}} New Works Programme and as a flood <b>protection</b> <b>measure.</b> To accommodate additional passengers on the Victoria line, a new ticket hall was built. The Victoria line station opened on 7 March 1969, including cross-platform interchange with the Bakerloo line.|$|E
5|$|Pushing {{their way}} across the Bunga and Buiem Rivers, the 2/23rd fanned out through Apo village while {{maintaining}} contact with the 2/17th Infantry Battalion by signal cable. Around the Burep River, the 2/23rd was held up by the terrain and as a result the commander decided to halt and form a battalion defensive position. A platoon under Sergeant Don Lawrie was pushed forward near the mouth of the river as a <b>protection</b> <b>measure</b> to provide early warning. On 6 September, a company of Japanese attacked the 2/23rd's main defensive position south of the Singaua Plantation on the western side of the Buiem River, alongside a company from the 2/24th Battalion. Having been alerted by Lawrie's platoon who had sent back two runners, the battalion was able to repel the attack, although numerous casualties were inflicted on the 2/23rd and the 2/17th by Japanese mortars. The Japanese company, numbering about 60 men, subsequently fell back towards Lawrie's platoon near the Bunga. Positioned on the Japanese line of retreat, the Australian platoon was subjected to six attacks. These were fended off {{over the course of the}} afternoon, and by evening, as heavy rain began to fall, the Australian platoon was able to break contact and withdraw back to the 2/23rd's main defensive position.|$|E
5|$|The Delhi Metro has won {{awards for}} {{environmentally}} friendly practices from organisations including the United Nations, RINA, and the International Organization for Standardization, becoming the second metro in the world, after the New York City Subway, to be ISO 14001 certified for environmentally friendly construction. Most of the Metro stations on the Blue Line conduct rainwater harvesting {{as an environmental}} <b>protection</b> <b>measure.</b> It is also the first railway project {{in the world to}} earn carbon credits after being registered with the United Nations under the Clean Development Mechanism, and has so far earned 400,000 carbon credits by saving energy through the use of regenerative braking systems on its trains. To reduce its dependence on non-renewable sources of energy, DMRC is looking forward to harness solar energy and install solar panels at the Karkardooma, Noida Sector-21, Anand Vihar and Pragati Maidan Metro stations and DMRC's residential complex at Pushp Vihar. As of March 2017, the DMRC has commissioned 20 MWp (megawatt peak) of solar power plants across 21 locations on the metro network. This is planned to increase to 31 MWp by March 2018, and 50 MWp by 2021.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this letter is to provide the California State Board of Forestry and Fire Protection (BOF) NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service's (NMFS) {{technical}} assistance regarding the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking "Class II-L Identification Methods, 2012 " (proposed rule). We appreciate the opportunity to comment. NMFS expects that existing Class II-L <b>protection</b> <b>measures</b> (Table 1) will adequately protect listed anadromous salmonids from most timber operations. However, we remain concerned that Class II-S <b>protection</b> <b>measures</b> may {{not be sufficient to}} reduce adverse impacts to listed anadromous salmonids from timber operations. The goal ofthe proposed rule isnot to change these <b>protection</b> <b>measures</b> but rather clarify the methods for which a Registered Professional Forester (RPF) distinguishes the difference between a Class II-L and a Class II-S. Table 1 and Table 2 summarize the watercourse <b>protections</b> <b>measures</b> that are required in the California Forest Practice Rules (CFPRs) 916. 9 (g) (2) et seq. Changes to these <b>protection</b> <b>measures</b> are not being considered in this proposed rule change. However, NMFS is available to assist BOF in developing appropriate revisions to Class II-S <b>protections</b> <b>measures</b> to address our concerns of sediment delivery to Class II-S watercourses, thence Class I watercourses...|$|R

2500|$|The Product Liability Directive 1985 was {{the first}} {{consumer}} <b>protection</b> <b>measure.</b> It creates strict enterprise liability for all producers and retailers for any harm to consumers from products, {{as a way to}} promote basic standards of health and safety. Any producer, or supplier if the ultimate producer is insolvent, of a product is strictly liable to compensate a consumer for any damage caused by a defective product. A [...] "defect" [...] is anything which falls below what a consumer is entitled to expect, and this essentially means that products should be safe for their purpose. A narrow defensive is available if a producer can show that a defect could not be known by any scientific method, thought this has never been successfully invoked, because it is generally thought a profit making enterprise should not be able to externalise the risks of its activities.|$|E
2500|$|A {{fire hydrant}} {{is an active}} fire <b>protection</b> <b>measure,</b> {{and a source of}} water {{provided}} in most urban, suburban and rural areas with municipal water service to enable firefighters to tap into the municipal water supply to assist in extinguishing a fire. Before the existence of fire hydrants, a primitive fire suppression system known as [...] "fire plugs" [...] consisted of burying a wooden water pipe (often no more than a hollowed out log) along the streets for teams of bucket brigades to form and fight fires. Wooden pegs would then need to be hammered over fire plugs in order to stop the flow of water. The invention of a post or pillar type fire hydrant is generally credited to Frederick Graff Sr., Chief Engineer of the Philadelphia Water Works around the year 1801. It had a combination hose/faucet outlet and was of [...] "wet barrel" [...] design with the valve in the top. It is said that Graff held the first patent for a fire hydrant, but this cannot be verified {{due to the fact that}} the patent office in Washington D.C. was burned to the ground in 1836 where all patent records from that time period were destroyed in the process. In 1863, Birdsill Holly invented the modern version of the fire hydrant. While Holly was only one of many involved in the development of the fire hydrant, innovations he introduced are largely responsible for the fire hydrant taken for granted today. In 1869, Holly was issued U.S. patent #94749, for an [...] "improved fire hydrant".|$|E
