5|$|<b>Pruritus,</b> {{commonly}} known as itchiness, is a sensation exclusive to the skin, and characteristic of many skin conditions.|$|E
5|$|The major {{side effects}} include dilated pupils, blurred vision, dryness of the mouth, extreme alertness, <b>pruritus,</b> confusion, agitation, tremor, {{extrapyramidal}} symptoms (dystonia, akathisia), headache, dizziness, anxiety, insomnia, vomiting, chest pain, hallucinations, paresthesia, tachycardia, hypertension, palpitations, collapse, hyperventilation, sweating, hyperthermia and problems with urine retention. The more severe toxic effects include psychosis or adverse psychiatric events, renal toxicity, respiratory failure, hyperthermia, serotonin syndrome, rhabdomyolysis and seizure. Blood benzylpiperazine concentrations have been measured either to confirm clinical intoxication or {{as part of}} a medicolegal death investigation.|$|E
25|$|In Germany, {{chlorpromazine}} still carries label indications for insomnia, severe <b>pruritus,</b> and preanesthesia.|$|E
25|$|After {{the tick}} is removed <b>pruritus</b> may recur {{at the site}} of {{attachment}} at intervals over some weeks, and a small firm lump usually forms within a day or so of the tick's removal. This again may persist for many weeks. There may be some discoloration of the area of the bite. In other cases the skin reactions may be severe with marked <b>pruritus</b> and considerable erythema, oedema and induration. People also report headaches.|$|E
25|$|Anaphylaxis: Sometimes {{cases of}} {{anaphylaxis}} consisting of diffuse erythema, <b>pruritus,</b> conjunctival injection, fever, abdominal pain, edema, hypotension and bronchospastic reactions are observed.|$|E
25|$|Skin reactions: Rash, <b>pruritus,</b> and {{photosensitivity}} {{have all}} been noticed. Toxic epidermal necrolysis (Lyell's syndrome) may also be encountered and may be life-threatening.|$|E
25|$|Other {{side effects}} include nausea and vomiting, anorexia, sideroblastic anemia, skin rash, urticaria, <b>pruritus,</b> dysuria, {{interstitial}} nephritis, malaise; rarely porphyria, and fever.|$|E
25|$|Chronic {{excessive}} {{alcohol abuse}} {{is associated with}} a wide range of skin disorders including urticaria, porphyria cutanea tarda, flushing, cutaneous stigmata of cirrhosis, psoriasis, <b>pruritus,</b> seborrheic dermatitis and rosacea.|$|E
25|$|Although {{capsaicin}} creams {{have been}} used to treat psoriasis for reduction of itching, a review of six clinical trials involving topical capsaicin for treatment of <b>pruritus</b> concluded there was insufficient evidence of effect.|$|E
25|$|Primary sclerosing cholangitis. PSC is a {{progressive}} cholestatic disorder presenting with <b>pruritus,</b> steatorrhea, fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies, and metabolic bone disease. There {{is a strong}} association with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), especially ulcerative colitis.|$|E
25|$|Hyperhydrosis, hypotension, burning eyes, {{increased}} appetite, {{changes in}} libido, hallucinations, faintness, nystagmus, vomiting, <b>pruritus,</b> gastrointestinal disturbances, nightmares, palpitation and paradoxical reactions including restlessness, aggression, violence, overstimulation and agitation have been reported, but are rare (less than 0.5%).|$|E
25|$|Morphine induced <b>pruritus</b> {{syndrome}} {{may also}} be caused by release of histamine from mast cells in the skin (Gunion et al. (2004). Paus et al. (2006) report that opioid μ-receptors and opioid κ-receptors are located in skin nerves and keratinocytes.|$|E
25|$|Attachment {{of a few}} larvae to a non-sensitised host provokes {{little or}} no response, even though the contact is {{prolonged}} over several days. However, {{towards the end of}} feeding some <b>pruritus,</b> erythema and localised oedema may develop at the site of attachment.|$|E
25|$|Hydroxyzine {{can also}} be used for the {{treatment}} of allergic conditions, such as chronic urticaria, atopic or contact dermatoses, and histamine-mediated <b>pruritus.</b> These have also been confirmed in both recent and past studies to have no adverse effects on the liver, blood, nervous system or urinary tract.|$|E
25|$|The oral {{formulations}} of doxepin are -approved {{for the treatment}} of depression and sleep-maintenance insomnia and its topical formulations are FDA-approved the short-term management for some itchy skin conditions. Whereas in Australia and the United Kingdom, the only licensed indication(s) is/are in the treatment of major depression and <b>pruritus</b> in eczema, respectively.|$|E
25|$|Itch (<b>pruritus)</b> {{has many}} causes. Allergies and {{inflammatory}} skin disease all produce itch as a symptom. Pathophysiologically, {{the sensation of}} the itch is poorly understood. Nevertheless, there are many known inducers of itch. Histamine is wildly known as an inducer of the itch sensation. Other substances known to induce itch are substance P, cytokines, and proteases.|$|E
25|$|Less {{common side}} effects may include: Hypotension, faintness, palpitation, rash or <b>pruritus,</b> {{gastrointestinal}} disturbances, {{and changes in}} libido are less common. Very infrequently, paradoxical reactions may occur, for example, excitement, stimulation, hallucinations, hyperactivity, and insomnia. Also, depressed or increased dreaming, disorientation, severe sedation, retrograde amnesia, headache, hypothermia, and delirium tremens are reported. Severe liver toxicity has also been reported.|$|E
25|$|Primary biliary cholangitis (also {{known as}} primary biliary cirrhosis). The bile ducts become damaged by an {{autoimmune}} process, leading to secondary liver damage. Patients may be asymptomatic or have fatigue, <b>pruritus,</b> and non-jaundice skin hyperpigmentation with hepatomegaly. There is prominent alkaline phosphatase elevation {{as well as}} elevations in cholesterol and bilirubin and usually positive anti-mitochondrial antibodies.|$|E
25|$|Atopic {{dermatitis}} (AD) is {{a chronic}} inflammatory skin disorder, in which patients suffer from eczema, often severe <b>pruritus</b> on the affected skin, {{as well as}} complications and secondary infections. AD surfaces from an upregulation of Th2-modified immune responses, therefore a novel AD approach using DNAzymes targeting GATA-3 is a plausible treatment option. The topical DNAzyme SB011 is currently in phase II clinical trials.|$|E
25|$|Beyond initial first aid, antihistamines such as {{diphenhydramine}} (Benadryl) may control {{skin irritation}} (<b>pruritus).</b> Ice or fresh water {{is not usually}} applied to stings, since they may cause nematocysts to continue to release toxin. Immunobased antivenins have been available since the 1970s; administration requires medical personnel and refrigeration and are used in extreme cases as {{with regard to the}} box jellyfish, Chironex fleckeri.|$|E
25|$|Mirtazapine {{and other}} {{antidepressants}} may cause a discontinuation syndrome upon cessation. A gradual and slow reduction in dose is recommended to minimize discontinuation symptoms. Effects of sudden cessation of treatment with mirtazapine may include depression, anxiety, panic attacks, vertigo, restlessness, irritability, decreased appetite, insomnia, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, flu-like {{symptoms such as}} allergies and <b>pruritus,</b> headaches and sometimes hypomania or mania.|$|E
25|$|Azelastine {{nasal spray}} is {{indicated}} {{for the local}} treatment of the symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis and perennial allergic rhinitis, such as rhinorrhea, sneezing and nasal <b>pruritus</b> in adults and children 5 {{years of age and}} older. In some countries, it is also indicated for the treatment of vasomotor rhinitis in adults and children ≥ 12 years old. Azelastine eyes drops are indicated for the local treatment of seasonal and perennial allergic conjunctivitis.|$|E
25|$|Food allergy is a non-seasonal {{disease with}} skin and/or {{gastrointestinal}} disorders. The main complaint is excessive scratching (<b>pruritus)</b> {{which is usually}} resistant to treatment by steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The exact prevalence of food allergy in cats remains unknown. In 20 to 30% of the cases, cats have concurrent allergic diseases (atopy/flea-allergic dermatitis). A reliable diagnosis can only be made with dietary elimination-challenge trials. Allergy testing {{is necessary for the}} identification of the causative food component(s). Therapy consists of avoiding the offending food component(s).|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} adverse effects are {{flushing}} (e.g., warmth, redness, itching or tingling), headache, pain, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting, rhinitis, <b>pruritus</b> and rash. These can be minimized by initiating therapy at low dosages, increasing dosage gradually, and avoiding administration {{on an empty}} stomach. High doses of niacin often temporarily reduce blood pressure {{as a result of}} acute vasodilation. In the longer term, high-dose niacin use may persistently lower blood pressure in individuals with hypertension, but {{more research is needed to}} determine the extent of this effect.|$|E
25|$|RNA {{interference}} of BRAF {{stops the}} multiplication of melanoma tumor cells. This suggests that BRAF inhibitors such as sorafenib, PLX4720, PLX4032, GDC-0879, GSK2118436, or AZ628 may be affective in treating melanoma. These {{have been tested}} and proven {{to slow down the}} production of melanoma due to BRAF mutation but PLX4032 and GSK2118436 show the most promise because they worked the most aggressively in early stages of cell development. Although this drug helps slow down or shrink the tumors, there are many serious side affects to using these drugs that were found in the trials including arthralgia, rash, nausea, phosphosensitivity], fatigue, <b>pruritus</b> and palmo-plantar dysesthesia.|$|E
25|$|Food allergy is a non-seasonal {{disease with}} skin and/or {{gastrointestinal}} disorders. The main complaint is <b>pruritus.</b> The exact prevalence of food allergy in cats remains unknown. There is no breed, sex or age predilection, although some breeds are commonly affected. Before {{the onset of}} clinical signs, the animals have been fed the offending food components {{for at least two}} years, although some animals are less than a year old. In 20 to 30% of the cases, cats have concurrent allergic diseases (atopy / flea-allergic dermatitis). A reliable diagnosis can only be made with an elimination diet. Challenge–dechallenge–rechallenge is necessary for the identification of the causative food component(s). Therapy consists of avoiding the offending food component(s).|$|E
25|$|Symptoms can be {{directly}} or indirectly related {{to the loss of}} bowel control. The direct (primary) symptom is a lack of control over bowel contents which tends to worsen without treatment. Indirect (secondary) symptoms, which are the result of leakage, include <b>pruritus</b> ani (an intense itching sensation from the anus), perianal dermatitis (irritation and inflammation of the skin around the anus), and urinary tract infections. Due to embarrassment, people may only mention secondary symptoms rather than acknowledge incontinence. Any major underlying cause will produce additional signs and symptoms, such as protrusion of mucosa in external rectal prolapse. Symptoms of fecal leakage (FL) are similar, and may occur after defecation. There may be loss of small amounts of brown fluid and staining of the underwear.|$|E
25|$|Obstructive {{lung disease}} in adults; liver {{cirrhosis}} during childhood; when a newborn or infant has jaundice that lasts {{for an extended}} period of time (more than a week or two), an enlarged spleen, ascites (fluid accumulation in the abdominal cavity), <b>pruritus</b> (itching), and other signs of liver injury; persons under 40 years of age that develops wheezing, a chronic cough or bronchitis, is short of breath after exertion and/or shows other signs of emphysema (especially when the patient is not a smoker, has not been exposed to known lung irritants, and when the lung damage appears to be located low in the lungs); when you have a close relative with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency; when a patient has a decreased level of A1AT.|$|E
25|$|Repeated {{infestation}} {{with the}} larva, as occurs in rural and wooded suburban areas where bandicoots are common, rapidly {{leads to the}} development of hypersensitivity. Dramatic local erythema, hypoesthesia and oedema and <b>pruritus</b> may develop within 2–3 hours of attachment of even one larva if a person has been sensitised by a previous bite. In this case attachment of the larvae leads to formation of intra-epidermal blebs and eventually vesicles. These eventually rupture and the larvae detach and are lost. Frequently, a tick embedded over an eyelid will result in gross facial and neck swelling within a few hours. The person can go on to develop very severe signs of tracheopharyngeal compression within 5–6 hours after the first onset of symptoms.|$|E
25|$|ADRs {{can include}} {{enlargement}} of the gums, convulsions, peptic ulcers, pancreatitis, fever, vomiting, diarrhea, confusion, hypercholesterolemia, dyspnea, numbness and tingling particularly of the lips, <b>pruritus,</b> high blood pressure, potassium retention possibly leading to hyperkalemia, kidney and liver dysfunction (nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity), burning sensations at finger tips, and an increased vulnerability to opportunistic fungal and viral infections. In short, it is nephrotoxic, neurotoxic, {{increases the risk of}} squamous cell carcinoma and infections, and often causes hypertension (due to renal vasoconstriction and increased sodium reabsorption). The latter may result in serious adverse cardiovascular events; thus it is recommended that prescribers find the lowest effective dose for people requiring long term treatment. Ciclosporin also causes {{enlargement of the}} gums and increased hair growth which is not seen with tacrolimus (another calcineurin inhibitor).|$|E
25|$|Mirtazapine is a {{very strong}} H1 {{receptor}} inverse agonist and, as a result, it can cause powerful sedative and hypnotic effects. A single 15mg dose of mirtazapine to healthy volunteers has been found to result in over 80% occupancy of the H1 receptor and to induce intense sleepiness. After a short period of chronic treatment, however, the H1 receptor tends to desensitize and the antihistamine effects become more tolerable. Many patients may also dose at night to avoid the effects, and this appears to be an effective strategy for combating them. Blockade of the H1 receptor may improve pre-existing allergies, <b>pruritus,</b> nausea, and insomnia in afflicted individuals. It may also contribute to weight gain, however. In contrast to the H1 receptor, mirtazapine has only low affinity for the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, although anticholinergic side effects like dry mouth, constipation, and mydriasis are still sometimes seen in clinical practice.|$|E
25|$|Between {{the time}} of Cortez Jr.'s death and the {{announcement}} of his toxicology tests in late April, The Dallas Morning News published {{the results of a}} lengthy analysis of autopsy results between 2005 and 2007, conducted in concert with the Dallas County medical examiner's office, which suggested that as many as 17 deaths among adolescents during that period were attributable to cheese heroin, not including the Cortez death. The conclusion was based in part on the presence of both heroin and diphenhydramine in the blood of the deceased; additionally, the families of 11 victims confirmed the deceased had used cheese heroin. Some toxicologists questioned the results due to the absence of acetaminophen. Other experts argued that acetaminophen has a shorter half-life and might have been metabolized by the body prior to death. Susan Dalterio, a University of Texas at San Antonio pharmacology expert, insisted that the combination was unlikely to be a coincidence, as a person sleepy from diphenhydramine would be unlikely to be abusing heroin at the same time. It is common for users of heroin and other opioid drugs to take diphenhydramine-containing medications as an attempt to alleviate side effects resulting from histamine release induced by opioid administration, such as <b>pruritus,</b> as well as potentiate the sedative effects of the drug.|$|E
500|$|Notalgia paresthetica (hereditary {{localized}} <b>pruritus,</b> posterior pigmented pruritic patch, subscapular <b>pruritus)</b> ...|$|E

500|$|Both the interferons and glatiramer acetate are {{available}} only in injectable forms, and both can cause skin reactions at the injection site, specially with subcutaneous administration. Skin reactions vary greatly in their clinical presentation and may include bruising, erythema, pain, <b>pruritus,</b> irritation, swelling and in the most extreme cases cutaneous necrosis. [...] They usually appear within {{the first month of}} treatment albeit their frequence and importance diminish after six months of use. Mild skin reactions usually do not impede treatment whereas necroses appear in around 5% of patients and lead to the discontinuation of the therapy. Also over time, a visible dent at the injection site due to the local destruction of fat tissue, known as lipoatrophy, may develop.|$|E
500|$|Life with SU can be difficult. Patients {{are subject}} to {{constant}} itching and pain, as within minutes of the initial exposure to UV radiation a rash will appear. The urticarial reaction begins {{in the form of}} <b>pruritus,</b> later progressing to erythema and edema in the exposed areas of the skin. If vast areas of the body are affected, the loss of fluid into the skin could lead to light-headedness, headache, nausea, and vomiting. Extremely rarely, patients have been reported to experience an increase in heart rate that can cause a stroke or heart attack due to the body cavity swelling. Other rare side effects can be [...] bronchospasm and glucose instability issues. Also, if a large area of the body is suddenly exposed the person may be subject to an anaphylactic reaction. Once free of exposure, the rash will usually fade away within several hours; rare and extreme cases can take a day or two to normalize depending on severity of the reaction.|$|E
