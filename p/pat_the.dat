5|$|Emergency centers were prepped {{across the}} {{northern}} Cook Islands on February8. The Cook Islands Chapter of the Red Cross took early action with Cyclone Pat and began stockpiling relief supplies on February9. Volunteers {{from the organization}} assisted elderly residents with preparation and evacuation on Aitutaki. Anticipating high winds, residents tied down homes with rope and wire and boarded up windows with shutters. Similar preparations took place on Rarotonga, though the main concern there was storm surge. Government offices and schools there were closed on February11. Most residents and all tourists along the coast in Aitutaki evacuated inland to designated shelters. Authorities later announced that they were under-prepared for Cyclone <b>Pat.</b> <b>The</b> lack of an official process during an emergency was cited as a core issue.|$|E
5|$|In 1889, Pilcher married Kathleen Mary Gonne, {{daughter}} of Colonel Thomas Gonne of the 17th Lancers; her sister, Maude Gonne, {{later became a}} prominent Irish nationalist and mother of the politician and Nobel laureate Seán MacBride, {{as well as a}} close associate and muse of W. B. Yeats. Pilcher disapproved of his sister-in-law, particularly after her marriage to John MacBride, and relations were frequently strained; however, the two sisters remained close. The couple would have a daughter, Thora, and three sons – Toby, Tommy, and <b>Pat.</b> <b>The</b> elder son, Gonne ("Toby", to his family), became a Judge of the High Court of Justice, while Tommy would be killed at the Battle of Neuve Chapelle in 1915, aged 21.|$|E
5|$|The richer {{lands of}} Mexico engaged the main {{attention}} of the Conquistadors for some years, then in 1526 Francisco de Montejo (a veteran of the Grijalva and Cortés expeditions) successfully petitioned the King of Spain {{for the right to}} conquer Yucatán. On 8 December of that year he was issued with the hereditary military title of adelantado and permission to colonise the Yucatán Peninsula. In 1527 he left Spain with 400 men in four ships, with horses, small arms, cannon and provisions. One of the ships was left at Santo Domingo as a supply ship to provide later support; the other ships set sail and reached Cozumel, an island off the east coast of Yucatán, {{in the second half of}} September 1527. Montejo was received in there in peace by the lord Aj Naum <b>Pat.</b> <b>The</b> ships only stopped briefly before making for the mainland, making landfall somewhere near Xelha in the Maya province of Ekab.|$|E
