40|$|Abstract [...] Gearboxes {{are used}} in almost every {{industry}} right from power to marine, and also include agriculture, textile, automobiles, aerospace, shipping etc. A gearbox is a gear or a hydraulic system responsible for transmitting mechanical power from a prime mover (an engine or electric motor) into some form of useful output. It is referred to the metal casing in which a number of gears are sealed. <b>Pivot</b> <b>pin</b> fitted in lever of gearbox which is used for engaging the gears in gearbox. It is seen that the component <b>Pivot</b> <b>Pin</b> has failed in few Vehicles after completion of certain Kms. In the proposed work, design of <b>pivot</b> <b>pin</b> of gearbox is studied {{and with the help}} of design, the component studied in detail on this particular failure and by considering different manufacturing processes, suitable results will be calculated. Later on, design modifications are done on <b>Pivot</b> <b>pin.</b> This technical paper is on failure diagnosis and modification in design of <b>pivot</b> <b>pin</b> gearbox used in vehicle. ANSYS is used for stress analysis. The main objective for carrying out this analysis was to improve the life of the <b>pivot</b> <b>pin.</b> After the analysis of <b>pivot</b> <b>pin</b> from existing gearbox the reason for failure was found. The reason for failure of the <b>pivot</b> <b>pin</b> was due to fatigue failure. This is caused due to Breaking of all the Pins is in the same manner at the same cross section near the Relief Groove. To relieve these stress concentration modifications in the design of <b>pivot</b> <b>pin</b> were done and after that again stress analysis of the modified <b>pivot</b> <b>pin</b> carried out.

50|$|The bogies {{consist of}} the two lateral main beams, and the two cross beams at each end; there is no middle welded cross beam. The {{transfer}} of pulling and braking power from bogie to locomotive takes place via two rods, which connect the locomotive via pivot pin to the bogie. The <b>pivot</b> <b>pins</b> are mounted with a slight slant to enable {{the formation of a}} right angle to the also slightly slanted rods. The rods are spring mounted at about 40 mm to the pivot pin, so that the movement of the bogie could be balanced.|$|E
5000|$|In {{a rolling}} block action the {{breechblock}} {{takes the form of}} a part-cylinder, with a <b>pivot</b> <b>pin</b> through its axis. The operator rotates or [...] "rolls" [...] the block to open and close the breech; it is a simple, rugged and reliable design. Rolling blocks are most often associated with firearms made by Remington in the later 19th century; in the Remington action the hammer serves to lock the breech closed at the moment of firing, and the block in turn prevents the hammer from falling with the breech open. An interesting variation of the rolling block was the Austrian M1867 Werndl-Holub, in which the <b>pivot</b> <b>pin</b> was parallel to the barrel and the block rotated sideways.|$|R

50|$|The tow-ball {{is popular}} for lighter loads, readily {{allowing}} swivelling and articulation of a trailer.

50|$|A {{basin wrench}} {{consists}} of a long shaft {{with a pair of}} asymmetrical jaws at one end and a transverse handle at the other end. The two jaws form an assembly in which the jaws are joined with a <b>pivot</b> <b>pin.</b> One of the jaws is fixed relative to the shaft, and the other is curved and spring-loaded relative to the fixed jaw so that it will automatically close and grip the fastener. When the shaft is turned in the direction that causes the curved jaw to trail the <b>pivot</b> <b>pin,</b> the jaws will increase their grip on the fastener as shaft torque increases, thereby allowing the operator to apply torque to the fastener without slippage. The transverse handle passes through a loosely fitting hole in the shaft {{so that it can be}} shifted to conform to tight spaces or to elongate it so as to increase leverage.|$|R
50|$|The trigger assembly, which {{includes}} the trigger, hammer, sear, and trigger body with guard, can be removed by pushing out one retaining pin and pulling downwards on the guard (if a pistol grip is installed, it usually must be removed first as virtually all such grips obstruct {{the removal of the}} trigger body). The elevator can be removed by putting the gun on safety and squeezing the sides together, freeing the <b>pivot</b> <b>pins</b> from the receiver. The fore-end can then be moved to the rear, allowing the bolt and bolt carrier to drop out, and then the forend can be removed by moving it forward. The cartridge stop and interrupter will then fall free, leaving just the ejector and the safety in the receiver, held in by screws. The magazine spring and follower may be removed by unscrewing the tube from the receiver (this may be difficult on some new 500s). This level of field stripping is sufficient to allow all components to be cleaned.|$|E

5000|$|The {{figure was}} {{loosely based on}} the artist's mannequins still {{available}} today; the basic figure had multiple points of articulation, previously not found in any children's toy. The advertising claimed [...] "21 points of articulation", however, if one actually counts each individual pivot contact point, there are 19; head-to-neck, neck-to-torso, shoulder-to-torso (2), biceps-to-shoulder (2), elbow (2), wrist (2), torso-to-pelvis, hipball-to-pelvis (2), thigh-to-pelvis (2), knee (2) and ankle (2).The figure was held together by means of elastic, wire hooks and metal rivets. <b>Pivot</b> <b>pins</b> were made of a ribbed plastic, which was pressed into the adjacent limb section, allowing the limbs to rotate as well as hinge at pivot point. Even this specific method of attaching the appendages was patented as a [...] "Connection For Use In Toy Figures" [...] (patent , October 28, 1969).The hip balls were made of a softer vinyl that allowed movement while retaining the surface friction required to maintain a pose. This level of attention to detail was of course costly to manufacture, and had caused product development no end of grief to devise, as simple as the end result seemed. The {{fact that so many}} still exist intact after more than forty years {{is a testament to the}} production quality that Hasbro demanded of its manufacturing plants. Cheap imitations of Hasbro's product did not bother with such detail, resulting in figures that lacked anything like the poseability and longevity of G.I. Joe.|$|E
50|$|The {{effect of}} wear on {{a roller chain}} is to {{increase}} the pitch (spacing of the links), causing the chain to grow longer.

40|$|On {{level with}} plastic {{deformations}} an elastic interaction between elements of rolling equipment and rolled metal takes important place in sheet steel rolling. Contacts between work roll and rolled band, {{between work and}} backup rolls are examples of such interactions. In contrast to the work roll and rolled band contact interaction, which {{is the subject of}} many detailed theoretical and experimental investigations, the work roll and backup roll contact is considered only {{from the point of view}} of rolling load redistribution in multirolled systems. However, wide application of profiled rolls’ axial shifting in unscheduled rolling technology demands further investigations of elastic interaction with slippage. Inconstancy of distances between rolls’ <b>pivot</b> <b>pins</b> and contact surfaces leads to local mismatch between peripheral speeds of work and backup rolls. This effect is a reason of slippage. Later on it leads to uneven wear of work rolls. It must be necessarily taken into account while developing roll contours for axial shifting and algorithms for unscheduled rolling technology with automatic profile and flatness control for ensuring of rolled band’s profile which satisfies consumer’s demands. In the article there is formulated target setting of elastic contact of two osculating half-planes under speed asymmetry and compressive load. Principle of virtual work was used. There are obtained approximate solutions for completely elastic earth describing deflected mode without relative speed (Hertzian problem) and under speed asymmetry, which leads to appearance of slip zones on a contact surface. Influence of acting load, speed asymmetry, constant of friction and Poisson's ratio on slip zones‘ lengths is shown. In the article there are presented dependencies for correction of wear factors of work rolls, which are used in finishing train’s stands of wide-strip hot rolling mill with equipment for axial shifting. These dependencies are used to determine wear values of profiled work and backup rolls...|$|E
