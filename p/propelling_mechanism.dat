Furthermore, other geometric parameters, like the length-radius aspect ratio, exert great impact on the velocity.

40|$|Abstract—Recent {{studies have}} been carried out for {{rotating}} single flexible flagellum: a possible <b>propelling</b> <b>mechanism</b> that has been adopted by several artificial microswimmers due to its relatively simple structure yet considerable propulsive force generation. In this paper, we introduce a miniature swimming robot design with multiple flexible artificial flagella that benefits from the increased number of flagella. The characteristic length of the robot body is less than 1 mm. Experimental characterization of swimming of the robot shows that swimming speed can be linearly improved solely by increasing the number of attached flagella, suggesting a new way for speed enhancement besides flagellum geometry optimization. In addition, a numerical model modified from the single, straight flexible flagellum case is further established to study propulsive force generation by nonstraight, flexible flagellum. A robot with multiple, sinusoidal flagella design is fabricated to demonstrate the capability of the proposed two-step photolithography-based microfabrication method to handle more complex flagella designs, which may enhance swimming performance.

This thesis deals with a systematic experimental investigation of the density distribution of bacterial solutions of different concentration.

The experimental set up consisted of two glass plates separated by spacers which define the confinement region. The separation distance ranged from 100 to 250 microns. The two plates were functionalized with bovine serum albumin (BSA) to avoid bacterial adhesion to the glass. The bacterial suspension was subjected to adjustment of buoyancy by addition of a density matching fluid like Percoll. In agreement with previous studies, we found a significant enhancement of density close to the walls for both bacteria. This effect does not seem to be affected by either the separation distance or the solution concentration. These results were compared with those obtained by numerical simulations of self-propelled rod like particles which do not interact with each other apart from steric interactions. The preliminary data support the experimental outcome suggesting that steric interactions alone are sufficient to produce the observed enhancement effect...|$|E

All subjects performed a maximal exercise test on a wheelchair ergometer. Exercise bouts with an intensity of 30 to 50 % and 60 to 80 % of the maximal power output were analyzed. Effectiveness of force application, defined as the ratio of the effective force and the total force, was considerably lower in TP, compared with PP. Effectiveness of force application in the plane of the wheel was comparable between TP and PP. TP showed a significantly lower effectiveness of force application in the frontal plane and applied the forces in a more lateromedial direction to the hand rim. The ratio power output/energy expenditure, calculated as an indication of gross mechanical efficiency, was considerably lower in TP and was associated with the effectiveness of force application (r = 0. 64; P < 0. 01). Timing parameters showed that TP positioned their hands in a more backward position on the hand rim. Comparing the different intensity conditions revealed that force was applied more effectively, and the ratio power output/energy expenditure was higher at the higher intensity condition. Push time, relative to cycle time, increased, and beginning angle showed a forward shift with a higher load. TP tended to decrease, whereas PP showed a tendency for an increase in stroke angle with a higher load. The low effectiveness and different pattern of force application in TP should be taken into account when developing other wheelchair <b>propelling</b> <b>mechanisms</b> and training programs for this population...|$|R

40|$|A {{number of}} {{attempts}} have been made to fabricate microswimmers that possibly navigate in vivo including the artificial magnetic bacteria flagella, chemical microswimmers and natural organism based microswimmers. This paper presents another <b>propelling</b> <b>mechanism</b> in micron scale that works by oscillating microbubbles in acoustic field. First of all, the propulsion mechanism is proven by two-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. Then, the microswimmer device is made on a parylene structure by photolithography. The underwater propulsion in one-dimensional is demonstrated and the propulsion mechanism is also confirmed by experiments. The relation of the propulsion speed/bubble oscillation amplitude and the input acoustic signal is measured. It is shown that the propulsion will happen when the bubble oscillation amplitude (or Reynolds number) gets large enough which is close to the system acoustic resonance. Around this resonance frequency (about 11 kHz), the measured propulsion speed is up to 45 mm/s and payload-carrying ability is realized. The one-directional rotation acoustic turbo is also made with a speed of about 75 rpm. This acoustic frequency dependence also becomes the foundation for two-dimensional propulsion. Then, the bi-directional motion and two-dimensional steering motion are realized by microbubbles with different lengths based on their different acoustic resonances. First of all, the frequency behavior for long (about 760 μm average length) and short (about 300 μm average length) bubbles at about 6 kHz and 11 kHz are measured, including oscillation amplitude and generated microstreaming. By adjusting input acoustic frequency, specific bubbles could be activated selectively. Then, when the different microbubbles are arranged into opposite directions, the bi-directional propulsion can be realized, including back/forth motion and clockwise/counter-clockwise rotation. The bi-directional motion mechanism is also confirmed by three-dimensional CFD simulations and the net force is calculated. The concept is further developed into two-dimensional propulsion by arranging long and short bubbles into orthogonal directions on the same device. By switching the input acoustic frequency, the controlled steering propulsion is illustrated on a two-dimensional plane. Carrying of objects in a T-junction microchannel is shown as well. The last part of this thesis is focused on developing the microswimmer into a biodegradable device, including long- and short-tem. The long-term biodegradable device is fabricated by polycaprolactone (PCL) by a simple dipping method, and propulsion in a minitube is shown. The short-term biodegradable device is fabricated by rolling up magnesium film based on building stress mismatch mechanically with help of a stretcher. The method could also be applied to aluminium and parylene film rollups. At last, the propulsion and biodegradable abilities of magnesium microtube are demonstrated...|$|E

40|$|A {{comparison}} of present tomb {{conditions of the}} Royal Tomb of Seti I in the Valley of the Kings with Burton's photographs (1921 – 1928) reveals that the rock structure and tomb decoration have undergone severe deterioration. In fact, several other Royal Tombs in the Valley of the Kings have shown similar decay features. Most of the Royal Tombs in the Valley of the Kings and the West Valley were excavated into the marls of the middle and lower part of Member I, the lowermost unit of the Thebes Formation. However, several tombs penetrate into the underlying interbedded shales and marls of the Esna Formation. All of them show severe, irreversible rock structure deterioration originating from swelling and shrinkage. Since the burial of Seti I, 3300 years ago, water and debris from flash floods had minor impacts on wall decoration of the uppermost chambers and on wall structure in the lower chambers. Historic flooding since {{the discovery of the}} tomb has caused major destruction of walls and pillars by repeated swelling and shrinkage of the shale. Moreover, accelerated humidity changes over the past 70 years have contributed to increasing deterioration of the rock structure. Rock mechanic analyses were done on samples from the tomb of Seti I {{in order to understand the}} <b>propelling</b> <b>mechanism</b> of deterioration. Marls and limestones of the Thebes Formation are predominantly composed of calcite, with 10 – 40 % clay minerals and minor amounts of quartz and anhydrite. Sepiolite and palygorskite are the dominant clay minerals in the Thebes Formation, with subordinate amounts of kaolinite and illite/smectite mixed layers. The shales of the Esna Formation contain more than 70 % clay minerals, which are composed of illite/smectite mixed layers, with high swelling capacity, kaolinite and subordinate palygorskite and sepiolite. The marls of the lower Thebes Formation showed dry compressive strength values between 48 MPa (7000 psi) and 78 MPa (11 300 psi) before violent failure, with a maximum elastic deformation of 0. 4 – 0. 5 %. The Esna Shale samples had maximum stress loads of 60 MPa (8500 psi) and 74 MPa (10 800 psi) with a maximum deformation of more than 2 %. The deformation character changed with increasing pressure from an elastic to an inelastic mode. Long-term swell tests on Esna Shale samples revealed an enormous water absorption and swelling capacity. Swell heaving is between 50 and 80 %, most of which takes place within the first hour. The swell pressure exceeds 5 MPa (700 psi) and 13 MPa (1900 psi) with a deformation of 1. 5 and 3. 3 %, respectively. The swell pressure increases to its maximum over a period of 7 – 12 days. The rock tests showed that the swell pressure capacity of the Esna shales might exceed the strength of the brittle and highly jointed marls of Member I, into which most of the tombs are hewn. The swell and water intake tests demonstrated that water absorption of the Esna shales is immediate. Mineralogical analyses showed that mixed-layer clay minerals are able to release enormous pressure, which may be ‘compensated’ through ductile deformation by the shales or may result in brittle failure of the marls...|$|E

However, addiction to oncogenes {{is not the}} only drive to lymphoid tumor pathogenesis. Dependence on non-oncogenes, which act by <b>propelling</b> basic <b>mechanisms</b> of cell proliferation and survival, has also been recognized in the pathobiology of lymphoid leukemias, lymphomas and multiple myeloma. Among the growing number of molecules that may uphold non-oncogene addiction, a key place is increasingly being recognized to the serine-threonine kinase CK 2. This enzyme is overexpressed and overactive in B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia, multiple myeloma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and non-Hodgkin lymphomas, such as mantle cell, follicular, Burkitt's and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas. In these tumors, CK 2 may serve the activity of oncogenes, similar to BCR-ABL and c-MYC, control the activation of critical signaling cascades, such as NF-κB (nuclear factor-κB), STAT 3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) and PTEN/PI 3 K/AKT (phosphatase and tensin homolog protein/phosphoinositide 3 -kinase/AKR thymoma), and sustain multiple cellular stress-elicited pathways, such as the proteotoxic stress, unfolded protein and DNA-damage responses. CK 2 has also been shown to have an essential role in tuning signals derived from the stromal tumor microenvironment. Not surprisingly, targeting CK 2 in lymphoid tumor cell lines or mouse xenograft models can boost the cytotoxic effects of both conventional chemotherapeutics and novel agents, similar to heat-shock protein 90, proteasome and tyrosine kinases inhibitors.

After a 60-second (nominal) electronic time delay, a piston actuator in the Safe and Arm mechanism is electrically fired, moving a slider to align the detonator with an explosive lead in the slider. At the same time, seven sensor triplines are released. Approximately three or four triplines will deploy up to 20 feet from the mine, depending upon the at-rest position of the mine. The remaining triplines may be hindered due to their proximity to the resting surface. After an additional 10-second electronic time delay, allowing the munition to return to equilibrium, the mine is fully armed electronically. Disturbance of a tripline, or the mine itself, now triggers a switch which completes an electronic firing circuit. The S&A electric detonator initiates the S&A firing train which initiates a detonating cord which the initiates {{a thin layer of}} liquid propellant, which by gravity rests under the kill mechanism, shattering the plastic mine body and <b>propelling</b> the kill <b>mechanism</b> upwards from 6 inches to 8 feet above the ground where it detonates. The kill mechanism is a spheroid internally embossed and loaded with 21 grams of Comp A5 and when detonated, propels fragments in a high velocity spherical pattern.|$|R
