40|$|Abstract:-With {{the rapid}} growth of {{electronic}} technology and industry, heat flux generated in a chip of the integrated circuit nowadays becomes so large that reliable operation needs faster cooling rate than ever. Comparatively high thermal capacity in liquid makes it more attractive as a coolant than just to increase the flowing rate of the cooling air. Water definitely has the advantage but also has the disadvantage of non-dielectric property. Thus, a cold plate has to be used to contain the cooling water inside. Channels have been cut within the cold plate in order to increase the flowing passages of water within the limited space defined {{by the size of the}} IC chip. Further heat transfer enhancement could be attained by roughing the surface of the channel wall, changing the configuration of the channels in to pin structure for water flow. In the present study, the effects of swirling inflow of the cooling water on the heat transfer have been studied in order to further increase the heat transfer rate of the water cooled cold <b>plate.</b> Key-Words:-Swirling flow, <b>liquid</b> <b>cooler,</b> mini channel 1...|$|R

40|$|This master {{thesis is}} {{supported}} by Ericsson to conduct research on immersed <b>liquid</b> <b>cooling</b> of electronics. By this technology, the liquid will be {{in direct contact with}} the electronics. The research begins with investigations in industrial background, literature review and theory in heat transfer. According to the knowledge from those investigations, different <b>liquid</b> <b>cooling</b> systems including indirect, direct and immersed <b>liquid</b> <b>cooling</b> systems are introduced. The experiment consists of three parts: air cooling, single-phase and two-phase <b>liquid</b> <b>cooling.</b> Those three parts are with the same test board with adjustable heat resources in the same geometry. In the first part, an air flow channel is used for testing air cooling, by which immersed <b>liquid</b> <b>cooling</b> can be compared to traditional technology. In the second part, an immersed <b>liquid</b> <b>cooling</b> system is designed and constructed with detailed explanation. Liquid NovecTM 7200 is used as working liquid. In the third part, a huge number of data has been collected during the whole process of boiling, through which a boiling curve for NovecTM 7200 has been acquired. Then comparisons between those three technologies have been made. The feasibility of immersed <b>liquid</b> <b>cooling</b> on an industrial scale has also been discussed. Based on the experiments and analyses, a careful conclusion that electronics with <b>liquid</b> <b>cooling</b> has a larger heat flux limit than with today’s air cooling but with some practical problems can be drawn...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Three-dimensional (3 D) {{circuits}} reduce communication de-lay in multicore SoCs, {{and enable}} efficient integration of cores, memories, sensors, and RF devices. However, vertical integration of layers exacer-bates {{the reliability and}} thermal problems, and cooling efficiency becomes a limiting factor. <b>Liquid</b> <b>cooling</b> is a solution to overcome the accelerated thermal problems imposed by multi-layer architectures. In this paper, we first provide a 3 D thermal simulation model including <b>liquid</b> <b>cooling,</b> supporting both fixed and variable fluid injection rates. Our model has been integrated in HotSpot to study the impact on multicore SoCs. We design and evaluate several dynamic management policies that complement <b>liquid</b> <b>cooling.</b> Our results for 3 D multicore SoCs, {{which are based on}} 3 D versions of UltraSPARC T 1, show that thermal management approaches that combine <b>liquid</b> <b>cooling</b> with proactive task allocation are extremely effective in preventing temperature problems. Our proactive management technique provides an additional 75 % average reduction in hot spots in comparison to applying only <b>liquid</b> <b>cooling.</b> Furthermore, for systems capable of varying the coolant flow rate at runtime, our feedback controller increases the improvement to 95 % on average.
