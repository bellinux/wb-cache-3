25|$|The next {{appearance}} of the denomination was in the reign of George IV, when it was produced in 1826 and 1829. The obverse shows the left-facing bust of the king with the legend GEORGIUS IV DEI GRATIA date, while the reverse shows a crowned shield within a mantle cape with the legend BRITANNIARUM REX FID DEF. The 1826 coin has the edge inscription DECUS ET TUTAMEN ANNO REGNI SEPTIMO, while the 1829 coin has a <b>plain</b> <b>edge.</b>|$|E
500|$|Despite their unpopularity in transactions, Anthony dollars saw {{heavy use}} in over 9,000 stamp-dispending {{machines}} situated in United States Postal Service buildings {{across the country}} beginning in 1993. Additionally, the coins saw use with mass transit authorities. Various propositions were discussed in Congress since the last dollars were produced in 1981, but no action was taken to issue a new coin until the Treasury's Anthony dollar stores became depleted in the 1990s. In February 1996, the stores totaled approximately 229,500,000, but that number was reduced to approximately 133,000,000 {{by the end of}} 1997. Faced with the necessity of striking more Susan B. Anthony dollars to fill the demand, the Treasury supported legislation authorizing a new dollar coin that would not be confused with the quarter. Legislation authorizing a dollar coin in a gold-colored composition and with a <b>plain</b> <b>edge</b> was introduced to the House and Senate in 1997, where it eventually received approval with a provision calling for it to depict Native-American guide Sacagawea. On December 1, 1997, President Bill Clinton signed the 50 States Commemorative Coin Program Act into law. The Act, which authorized the creation of the 50 State Quarters program, included a section entitled [...] "United States $1 Coin Act of 1997". That section officially authorized what became the Sacagawea dollar.|$|E

500|$|During {{the nineteenth}} century, Mint {{employees}} produced unauthorized copies of medals and coins, sometimes backdated. Although coin restrikes were created openly at the Philadelphia Mint from the 1830s, the practice became clandestine {{by the end}} of the 1850s. In the decades after the first 1804 dollars were produced, collectors became aware of their existence and desired to obtain them. Several were struck at the Mint in 1858. Those coins, which became known as [...] "Class II" [...] 1804 dollars, had plain, unlettered edges, as opposed to standard issue Draped Bust dollars and those struck as diplomatic gifts, all of which had edge lettering applied by the Castaing machine. In 1859, James Ross Snowden unsuccessfully requested permission from the Treasury Secretary to create patterns and restrikes of rare coins for sale to collectors, and in that year, dealers began offering <b>plain</b> <b>edge</b> 1804 dollars to the public. At least three were offered for sale by various dealers in 1859, and coin dealer Ebenezer Locke Mason claimed that he was offered three by Theodore Eckfeldt, a Mint employee and nephew of Adam Eckfeldt (who had died in 1852). After the public became aware that Mint officials had permitted restrikes, there was a minor scandal which resulted in a Congressional investigation and the destruction of outdated coinage dies. [...] The controversy prompted William E. DuBois, Mint Assayer, to try, in 1860, to recall the examples of the 1804 dollar in private hands. According to DuBois, five coins were known to be privately owned, of which four were recovered. He stated that three were destroyed in his presence, and one was added to the Mint's coin cabinet (of which he was curator, and which is today the National Numismatic Collection), where it remains today. The coin, which is the sole known Class II specimen in existence, was struck over an 1857 Swiss shooting thaler minted for a shooting festival in the Canton of Bern. The fifth coin, alluded to by DuBois, is not currently accounted for, although its edge may have been lettered after its recovery in an attempt to pass it as an original. Coins with added lettering are known as [...] "Class III" [...] 1804 dollars. The obverse coinage die used to strike the Class II and Class III 1804 dollars was deposited in safekeeping in 1860, and the reverse die was destroyed in that year. The obverse die was defaced in 1869.|$|E
2500|$|Knives are {{sharpened}} {{in various}} ways. Flat ground blades have a profile that tapers from the thick spine to the sharp edge {{in a straight}} or [...] line. Seen in cross section, the blade would form a long, thin triangle, or where the taper does not extend {{to the back of}} the blade, a long thin rectangle with one peaked side. Hollow ground blades have , beveled edges. The resulting blade has a thinner edge, so it may have better cutting ability for shallow cuts, but it is lighter and less durable than flat ground blades and will tend to bind in deep cuts. Serrated blade knives have a wavy, scalloped or saw-like blade. Serrated blades are more well suited for tasks that require aggressive 'sawing' motions, whereas <b>plain</b> <b>edge</b> blades are better suited for tasks that require push-through cuts (e.g., shaving, chopping, slicing).|$|E

2500|$|In the reigns of Kings Edward VII, George V, (Edward VIII), and George VI, five pound coins {{were only}} issued in proof sets {{in the first}} year of their reign (only {{prepared}} for approval in the case of Edward VIII, which is why his coin is valued at around £175,000!). All these reigns used the Pistrucci George and Dragon obverse, with the 1902 and 1911 coins having milled edges, though at least some of the 1937 coins have <b>plain</b> <b>edges.</b> The 1902 Edward VII coin was also minted at Sydney, being identified by an [...] "S" [...] above the centre of the date.|$|R
5000|$|On January 1, 1961 the {{currency}} was revalued again {{at a rate}} of 10:1, but this time a new coinage was introduced in denominations of 1, 2, 3 and 5 kopecks in aluminium-bronze, and 10, 15, 20 and 50 kopecks and 1 ruble in cupro-nickel-zinc. Like previous issues, the front featured the state arms and title while the back depicted date and denomination. The 50 kopeck and 1 ruble coins dated 1961 had <b>plain</b> <b>edges,</b> but starting in 1964, the edges were lettered with the denomination and date. All 1926-1957 coins were then withdrawn from circulation and demonetized, with the majority melted down.|$|R
2500|$|Also, John Adams Presidential dollars {{have been}} {{discovered}} with <b>plain</b> <b>edges.</b> They are fewer in quantity than George Washington plain-edge dollars, making them rarer, thus more expensive. A more frequently encountered edge lettering error for the John Adams dollar is a coin with doubled edge lettering. This error occurs when a coin passes through the edge lettering machine twice. Most examples of the doubled-edge-letter John Adams dollar are from the Philadelphia Mint (Denver Mint issues are comparatively scarce). They are seen in two varieties: 1) with both edge lettering inscriptions reading in the same direction, called [...] "overlapped", and 2) with the two inscriptions running in opposite directions—i.e., inverted or upside-down relative to one another—called [...] "inverted".|$|R

The family Gryllotalpidae includes several similar species.|$|R
50|$|This {{design was}} more {{successful}} {{and it was}} continued into 1796. In 1795, planchets became too thin for the edge lettering because of a weight reduction, so the mint stopped edge lettering on the cent, {{and the rest of}} these coins were made with a <b>plain</b> <b>edge.</b> Four coins from 1795 are known to have a reeded edge.|$|E

2500|$|In 1965, {{a second}} issue of coins, made by John Pinches, was carried out. These were a [...] {{to commemorate the}} 40th anniversary of Martin Coles Harman's {{purchase}} of Lundy. The coins are of the same design as the 1929 issue coins, but have <b>plain</b> <b>edges</b> and the 1965 date. They were struck in Proof sets, in bronze, nickel-brass, and gold. They were issued in a special case of which at least two varieties exist. 3000 of the base metal sets were issued and 25 of the gold sets. Apart from the sets, 25 each of the proof gold denominations were also issued for presentation purposes. It {{has been reported that}} Lundy puffin forgeries may exist. This seems unlikely {{and it may be that}} confusion with the 'pattern coins' or between the 1929 and 1965 issues has resulted in an erroneous interpretation. [...] Unlike the 1929 issues, which did circulate, these are generally not considered numismatic items.|$|R
50|$|The next {{appearance}} of the denomination was in the reign of George IV, when it was produced in 1826 and 1829. The obverse shows the left-facing bust of the king with the legend GEORGIUS IV DEI GRATIA date, while the reverse shows a crowned shield within a mantle cape with the legend BRITANNIARUM REX FID DEF.

50|$|Cuts {{made with}} a {{serrated}} blade are typically less smooth and precise than cuts {{made with a}} smooth blade. Serrated blades can {{be more difficult to}} sharpen using a whetstone or rotary sharpener than a non-serrated, however, they can be easily sharpened with a diamond. Serrated blades tend to stay sharper and longer than a similar straight edged blade. A serrated blade has a faster cut but a <b>plain</b> <b>edge</b> has a cleaner cut. Some prefer a serrated blade on a pocket knife.|$|E
50|$|Because of its {{similarity}} {{in size and}} weight to the 50-cent piece, the ten-cent piece was redesigned with a <b>plain</b> <b>edge</b> from 1982. The portrait of Queen Elizabeth II by Arnold Machin, introduced to the coins of the pound sterling in 1968, {{was placed on the}} obverse. On 1 January 1984 the old ten-cent coin was demonetised. In 1985 the portrait of the Queen by Machin was replaced by the portrait sculpted by Raphael Maklouf, used until 1992 and the launch of Hong Kong coins without the portrait of a reigning British Monarch.|$|E

40|$|Airborne sound {{insulation}} {{index of the}} noise barrier panel and the sound absorption coefficient of the barrier surface are the acoustic parameters that are usually determined in specialized laboratories, however they can be also determined in situ. Acoustic characteristics of a barrier include also the diffraction index difference determined from comparison of barriers with <b>plain</b> top <b>edges</b> and barriers with added devices installed on the top edge. The index is determined from the impulse response values determined for the acoustic wave propagation path from the sound source {{to a set of}} properly distributed measurement points. By means of the same method, one can also determine the difference in a barrier’s acoustic effectiveness between the plain top barrier structure and its version with added devices mounted on the top. The paper presents measurement results for three types of added devices mounted on the top edge of the barrier. The diffraction index differences have been determined for each added device type and the acoustic effectiveness for each device has been compared with the <b>plain</b> top <b>edge</b> acoustic barrier...|$|R
50|$|In 1976, {{corresponding}} {{with its}} slated independence, Tuvalu's first coins {{were introduced in}} denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50 cents and 1 dollar. The set, designed by John Donald features an aquatic theme. The bronze 1 and 2 cents and the cupro-nickel 5, 10 and 20 cents were the same size, weight, and composition as the corresponding Australian coins they were set to constitute. However, the cupro-nickel 50 cent piece was distinct from the dodecagonal (twelve sided) Australian 50 cent coin {{in that it was}} round with <b>plain</b> <b>edges.</b> The nonogonal (nine sided) cupro-nickel 1 dollar piece was unique not only by its odd shape, but it also predated the Australian 1 dollar coin by eight years. It was also issued long before the trend toward larger denomination coins became much more widespread in many countries. The nine sides on the dollar are meant to represent each of the nine islands and atolls composing the Tuvalu chain.Each of the coins depicts a sea animal that is native to the area, with the only exception to that being the 1 cent, which depicts an empty spider conch shell washed up on the shore.|$|R
50|$|In 1948 a new coin {{was issued}} for this denomination: a nickel-brass coin 20.57 mm in diameter, {{weighing}} 4.54 g {{and with a}} thickness of 1.85 mm and a <b>plain</b> <b>edge.</b> From 1948 to 1951, it bore the portrait of George VI on its obverse, without his title of Emperor of India, lost in 1947. In 1955, despite succeeding in 1952, the portrait of Queen Elizabeth II was first minted on the obverse. From 1937, onwards the coin featured a reeded security edge; this changed to a reeded edge in 1971.|$|E
