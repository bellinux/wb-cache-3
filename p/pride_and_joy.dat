5|$|The King {{was fascinated}} by astronomy; his {{personal}} association with the science was illustrated {{by the fact that}} the sundial was not only his personal <b>pride</b> <b>and</b> <b>joy</b> but was also designed to serve as a symbol of the Stuart family. It had glass portraits mounted on it, depicting Charles, Queen Catherine, the Duke of York, the Queen Mother and Prince Rupert. A watchman was posted to guard it against the kind of vandalism that had wrecked the earlier sundial, but in June 1675 it was severely damaged when it was attacked by John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester, much to the king's fury. The fate of the ruined dial is unknown; it was last recorded standing at Buckingham House (later Buckingham Palace) in 1710.|$|E

25|$|At {{the first}} Estonian Song Festival, in 1869, an {{important}} rallying {{event of the}} Estonian clans, two poems were set to music with lyrics by Lydia Koidula: Sind Surmani (Till Death) and Mu isamaa on minu arm (My Country is My Love), which became the unofficial anthem during the Soviet occupation when her father's Mu isamaa, mu õnn ja rõõm (My Country is My <b>Pride</b> <b>and</b> <b>Joy),</b> the anthem of the Estonian Republic between 1921 and 1940, was forbidden. Koidula's song always finished every festival, with or without permission. The tradition persists to this day.|$|E

On September 25, 1990, Epic released Family Style, an LP the Vaughan brothers cut at Ardent Studios in Memphis, Tennessee. The label released several promotional singles and videos for the collaborative effort. In November 1990, CMV Enterprises released <b>Pride</b> <b>and</b> <b>Joy,</b> a collection of eight Double Trouble music videos. Sony signed a deal with the Vaughan estate to obtain control of his back catalog, as well as permission to release albums with previously unreleased material and new collections of released work. On October 29, 1991, The Sky Is Crying was released as Vaughan's first posthumous album with Double Trouble, and featured studio recordings from 1984–1985. Other compilations, live albums, and films have also been released since his death.|$|E

Special liberty calls serve to reward Navy personnel with a trip {{to other parts of}} the U.S. and provides Americans who would normally never see warships and planes an up close look at life in the United States Navy. CAPT Pieno being a native of New Orleans, Louisiana, decided that New Orleans, during her Mardi Gras celebration, would be the perfect location to show off his <b>pride</b> <b>and</b> <b>joy.</b> During her trip to New Orleans Forrestal broke another record by becoming the largest ship to sail on the Mississippi River.

The house, a Victorian pseudo-Gothic {{pastiche}} described as architecturally [...] "devoid of interest" [...] by a local guide book and [...] "ugly" [...] by his wife, but is Tony's <b>pride</b> <b>and</b> <b>joy.</b> Entirely content with country life, he is seemingly unaware of Brenda's increasing boredom and dissatisfaction, and of his son's developing waywardness. Brenda meets John Beaver and, despite acknowledging his dullness and insignificance, she begins an affair with him. Brenda starts spending her weeks in London, and persuades Tony to finance a small flat, which she rents from John's mother, Mrs Beaver, an unscrupulous property developer. Although the Brenda–Beaver liaison is well known to their London friends, Tony remains uxorious and oblivious; attempts by Brenda and her friends to set him up with a mistress are absurdly unsuccessful.|$|E

I think that no foreigner can report its interior--its soul, its life, its speech, its thought.

His parents appointed two sailors from the Imperial Navy: Petty Officer Andrei Derevenko and his assistant Seaman Klementy Nagorny, to serve as nannies and to follow him about so he would not hurt himself. He was prohibited from riding a bicycle or playing too roughly, but was naturally active.|$|E

To Wetzel this was bitter as gall. To be led a wild goose chase! His fierce heart boiled with fury. His dark, keen eyes sought the grass and moss with terrible earnestness. Yet {{in spite of the}} anger that increased to the white heat of passion, he became aware of some strange sensation creeping upon him. He remembered that the Delawares had offered his life. Slowly, like a shadow, Wetzel passed up and down the ridges, through the brown and yellow aisles of the forest, over the babbling brooks, out upon the golden-flecked fields--always close on the trail.|$|R
2500|$|Baudelaire had {{no formal}} musical training, and knew little of composers beyond Beethoven and Weber. Weber {{was in some}} ways Wagner's precursor, using the leitmotif and conceiving {{the idea of the}} [...] "total art work" [...] ("Gesamtkunstwerk"), both of which gained Baudelaire's admiration. Before even hearing Wagner's music, Baudelaire studied reviews and essays about him, and {{formulated}} his impressions. Later, Baudelaire put them into his non-technical analysis of Wagner, which was highly regarded, particularly his essay [...] "Richard Wagner et Tannhäuser à Paris". Baudelaire's reaction to music was passionate and psychological. [...] "Music engulfs (possesses) me like the sea." [...] After attending three Wagner concerts in Paris in 1860, Baudelaire wrote to the composer: [...] "I had a feeling of <b>pride</b> <b>and</b> <b>joy</b> in understanding, in being possessed, in being overwhelmed, a truly sensual pleasure like that of rising in the air." [...] Baudelaire's writings contributed to the elevation of Wagner and to the cult of Wagnerism that swept Europe in the following decades.|$|E

The buildings, funded in part through federal funds obtained by Hague, are known for their Art Deco details, including marble walls, terrazzo floors, etched glass, and decorative moldings. Even at the time the Medical Center was too large to operate cost-effectively. In 2005 the 14 acre complex (much of which had fallen into disuse) was sold to a private developer who began converting two towers into a luxury condominium complex called the Beacon.|$|E

He tells Bertha, that she should have married a man full of <b>pride</b> <b>and</b> <b>joy.</b> [...] He complains, [...] "Oh Bertha, how she lied to me, that woman!" [...] Bertha points out that Ondine was no woman, [...] "you married a creature of another world. You must forget her." [...] Hans remembers the day that Ondine left and asks, [...] "But why does she proclaim to the world that she deceived me with Bertram?" [...] In addition to being preoccupied with Ondine, Hans is worried because the servants are starting to speak in poetry and there is a Wittenstein legend that this always happens just before misfortune strikes. Two fishermen arrive. The second fisherman is the Old One. They have caught Ondine. Two judges from the inquisition are summoned and immediately put her on trial. Ondine is brought in draped in the net in which she was caught. [...] She does not deny being an Ondine and proclaims to all who will listen that she deceived Hans with Bertram. The judge asks Hans to clearly state the exact nature of his complaint. Hans says, [...] "My complaint? [...] My complaint is the complaint of all mankind. [...] I claim the right to be left in peace {{in a world that is}} free of intrusions by these creatures. [...] Has there never been an age when they did not afflict us?" [...] The judge answers, [...] "An age? [...] There has never been a moment." [...] But the other judge says, [...] "Yes, there was once a moment.

40|$|Positive {{emotions}} {{are crucial to}} social relationships and social interaction. Although smiling is a frequently studied facial action, investigations of positive emotional expressions are underrepresented in the literature. This may be {{partly because of the}} assumption that all positive emotions share the smile as a common signal but lack specific facial configurations. The present study investigated prototypical expressions of four positive emotions—interest, <b>pride,</b> pleasure, <b>and</b> <b>joy.</b> The Facial Action Coding System was used to microcode facial expression of representative samples of these emotions taken from the Geneva Multimodal Emotion Portrayal corpus. The data showed that the frequency and duration of several action units differed between emotions, indicating that actors did not use the same pattern of expression to encode them. The authors argue that an appraisal perspective is suitable to describe how subtly differentiated positive emotional states differ in their prototypical facial expressions.

With the perfect and unconscious selfishness of a woman in love, she gauged everything in life just as it affected Luke. She even contrived to like Lord Radclyffe. He trod on every one of her moral and spiritual corns, it is true; he had that lofty contempt for the entire feminine sex which pertains to the Oriental, more than to the more civilized Western races; he combated her opinions, both religious and political, without any pretence at deference; he smoked very strong cigars in every room in the house, without the slightest regard for the feelings of his lady visitors; he did or left undone a great many other things which would tend to irritate and even to offend a woman accustomed to the conventional courtesies of daily social life; but when Luke entered a room, where, but a moment ago, Lord Radclyffe had been venting his chronic ill-humour on an offending or innocent subordinate, the old man's dour face would become transfigured, irradiated with a look of <b>pride</b> <b>and</b> of <b>joy</b> at sight of the man on whom he had lavished all the affection of which his strong nature was capable.|$|R

Emotions are often linked to actions, for example, gestures, posture, and facial movements, which enable respondents to manage their behaviors (Hakkak et al., 2016; Lewis et al., 2012). Consequently, behaviors could be positive (for example love, <b>pride,</b> happiness, <b>joy,</b> <b>and</b> warmth) or negative (for example guilt, greed, sadness, fear, and anger) (Roozen and Claeyes, 2009; Saad, 2011; Hakkak et al., 2016).|$|R
