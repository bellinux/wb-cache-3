40|$|Interactive <b>projected</b> <b>displays</b> are an {{emerging}} class of computer interface {{with the potential}} to transform interactions with surfaces in physical environments. They distinguish themselves from other visual output technologies, for instance LCD screens, by overlaying content onto the physical world. They can appear, disappear, and reconfigure themselves to suit a range of application scenarios, physical settings, and user needs. These properties have attracted significant academic research interest, yet the surrounding technical challenges and lack of application developer tools limit adoption to those with advanced technical skills. These barriers prevent people with different expertise from engaging, iteratively evaluating deployments, and thus building a strong community understanding of the technology in context. We argue that creating and deploying interactive <b>projected</b> <b>displays</b> should take hours, not weeks. This thesis addresses these difficulties through the construction of a toolkit that effectively facilitates user innovation with interactive <b>projected</b> <b>displays.</b> The toolkit’s design is informed by a review of related work and a series of in-depth research probes that study different application scenarios. These findings result in toolkit requirements that are then integrated into a cohesive design and implementation. This implementation is evaluated to determine its strengths, limitations, and effectiveness at facilitating the development of applied interactive <b>projected</b> <b>displays.</b> The toolkit is released to support users in the real-world and its adoption studied. The findings describe a range of real application scenarios, case studies, and increase academic understanding of applied interactive <b>projected</b> <b>display</b> toolkits. By significantly lowering the complexity, time, and skills required to develop and deploy interactive <b>projected</b> <b>displays,</b> a diverse community of over 2, 000 individual users have applied the toolkit to their own projects. Widespread adoption beyond the computer-science academic community will continue to stimulate an exciting new wave of interactive <b>projected</b> <b>display</b> applications that transfer computing functionality into physical spaces...|$|R

40|$|Front {{projection}} is an economical {{method to}} produce large displays. However, the twin problems of occlusions, which create {{shadows on the}} screen, and light projected onto users near the screen, potentially blinding them, makes front projection a poor fit for large upright interactive surfaces. Virtual Rear Projection (VRP) uses multiple redundant front projectors to provide the user experience of using a rear <b>projected</b> <b>display.</b> By using a projector-camera system to mitigate shadows and blinding light, a virtual rear <b>projected</b> <b>display</b> significantly improves upon the user experience of a traditional front <b>projected</b> <b>display,</b> allowing it to replace a rear <b>projected</b> <b>display.</b> In this thesis we characterize the problems caused by shadows and occlusions and develop projection technologies that mitigate shadows and blinding light. We also present a laboratory performance evaluation, and a user evaluation of the technology showing that VRP improves the user experience with respect to traditional front projection. Ph. D.

'The Christmas Song' is a bit overdramatic, but still likeable. 'Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas' is gentle and sweeping. Evancho’s voice has matured quite nicely and those piercing high notes that she navigates so effortlessly serve her well on this collection." [...] Randy Lewis of the Los Angeles Times commented that Evancho [...] "shows off a remarkably mature voice on her classically rooted Christmas outing. The music is at its most gorgeously formal in her duets with superstar tenor Placido Domingo, but she also delivers a nicely down-to-earth version of" [...] the title track.|$|E

40|$|This study aims {{to expand}} Weick and his colleagues' (2005) {{sensemaking}} framework by exploring prospection, work role identity, and emotion in the sensemaking process. It adopts a qualitative case study approach and examines the sensemaking of employees (both professional and non-professional) during a multi-skilling project. The study reveals three forms of sensemaking, namely 'wide sensemaking', 'narrow sensemaking' and 'ambivalent sensemaking', {{depending on the}} dynamics among prospection, work role identity, emotion in sensemaking. The study finds that people's sensemaking {{is affected by the}} disparity between the core attributes in their initial work role identity and those in the newly designed role of a multi-skilling project. Moreover, this study extends theories of prospection in sensemaking, arguing that people experiencing different disparity between their original work role identity and the work role identity associated with the <b>Project</b> <b>display</b> different patterns of prospective sensemaking. In addition, the thesis considers emotion in sensemaking, which was induced from the data. Emotions elicited in sensemaking affect the selection of anomalies as sensemaking cues, and indicate the need for identity work. Furthermore, in making sense of a multi-skilling project the valence and intensity of emotions elicited are determined by the level of difficulty to restore to one’s acceptable work role identity...|$|E
40|$|Piloting {{helicopters}} in degraded visual environments (DVE) {{remains one}} of the major challenges for the next years. While some research concentrated on the specialized problem of brownout landing, low visibility conditions in general cover a broader range of scenarios that further includes night, glare, fog and mist, as well as combinations of those. Project ALLFlight is DLR's initiative to diminish the problems of piloting helicopters under such circumstances. A possible solution comprises the use of sensors that are able to sense the environment even if the pilot cannot effectively see anything. As part of the <b>project</b> <b>display</b> symbologies are being developed to enable the pilot {{to make use of the}} rather abstract and noisy sensor data. In a first stage sensor data from very different sensors is fused. This step contains a classification of points into ground points and obstacle points. In a second step the result is augmented with ground data bases. Based on an earlier implementation of a synthetic head-down display an implementation for a head-tracked, helmet-mounted system is being developed. Since color is presently not yet an option for head-up displays, alternative symbologies have to be considered, including variations in transparency, density of terrain displays and size and shape variations for obstacle representation. In this paper we present the basic techniques used for obstacle and ground separation. We choose a set of possibilities for the pilot display and detail the implementation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Late Oligocene shallow glacimarine {{sequences}} {{recovered from}} western Ross Sea, Antarctica by the Cape Roberts (drilling) <b>Project</b> <b>display</b> orbitally-influenced cycles of advance and retreat of a laterally-extensive ice sheet across the continental shelf, {{in concert with}} changes in contemporary water-depth. During interglacial periods, when the glacier terminated on land, the coastline was largely ice-free and wave-influenced, and sediments accumulated in hydrodynamic equilibrium with the contemporary wave-climate. Here, we present estimates of paleobathymetry from intervals of three Milankovitch-duration glacimarine sequences (9, 10 and 11) that accumulated in open ocean conditions. We utilize an approach where the percentage of mud (3 ̆c 63 μm fraction) in bulk sediment {{is related to the}} wave-induced bed shear stress, and for a given wave climate, water depth (e. g. Dunbar, G. B. and Barrett, P. J., 2005. Estimating paleobathymetry of wave-graded continental shelves from sediment texture. Sedimentology 52, 253 – 269.). Particle size-derived changes in paleobathymetry for the three late Oligocene sequences were between 20 – 40 and 60 – 90 m. These water depth changes are consistent with the magnitude of contemporary global eustatic sea-level changes of 30 – 40 m estimated from far-field continental margin and deep-marine ocean proxy records. On the basis of our bathymetric constraints we contribute to a conceptual stratigraphic model for shallow glacimarine sequences, whose depositional architecture is controlled by a combination glacier advance and retreat and changes in relative sea-level...|$|E
