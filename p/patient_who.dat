5|$|Britain's Sir Ronald Ross, an army surgeon {{working in}} Secunderabad India, proved in 1897 that malaria is {{transmitted}} by mosquitoes, an event now commemorated via World Mosquito Day.

He continued his research into malaria by showing that certain mosquito species (Culex fatigans) transmit malaria to sparrows and he isolated malaria parasites from the salivary glands of mosquitoes that had fed on infected birds.

5|$|Use of an {{automated}} external defibrillator on a patient in a metal underwire bra can cause burns, and the bra should be removed by the first responder before the AED is applied.

5|$|As {{early as}} 1945, the ACLU {{had taken a}} stand {{to protect the rights}} of the mentally ill, when it drafted a model statute {{governing}} mental commitments. In the 1960s, the ACLU opposed involuntary commitments, unless it could be demonstrated that the person was a danger to himself or the community. In the landmark 1975 O'Connor v. Donaldson decision the ACLU represented a non-violent mental health <b>patient</b> <b>who</b> had been confined against his will for 15 years, and persuaded the Supreme Court to rule such involuntary confinements illegal. The ACLU has also defended the rights of mentally ill individuals who are not dangerous, but who create disturbances. The New York chapter of the ACLU defended Billie Boggs, a mentally ill woman who exposed herself and defecated and urinated in public.|$|E
30|$|Risk of {{bleeding}} {{and risk of}} infection had the highest relative contributions to treatment preferences but depending on the subgroup, their order in the treatment preferences differed. For example, risk {{of bleeding}} had numerically higher relative contribution to treatment preferences among <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> were younger (relative contribution 0.36 for age 18 – 49  years vs. 0.27 for patients 50 and older); were diagnosed with SAA more recently (relative contribution 0.33 for SAA diagnosis ≤ 2  years ago vs. 0.28 for SAA diagnosis 3 or more years ago), experienced bleeding since diagnosis (relative contribution 0.34 among <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> experienced bleeding vs. 0.26 among <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> did not), and experienced infection requiring hospitalization (relative contribution 0.35 among <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> experienced infection vs. 0.26 among <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> did not). Risk of infection had numerically higher relative contribution to treatment preferences among <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> were older (relative contribution 0.21 for age 18 – 49  years vs. 0.32 for patients 50 and older), were diagnosed with SAA longer ago (relative contribution 0.30 for SAA diagnosis ≤ 2  years ago vs. 0.26 for SAA diagnosis 3 or more years ago), did not experience bleeding since diagnosis (relative contribution 0.23 among <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> experienced bleeding vs. 0.33 among <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> did not), and did not experience infection since diagnosis (relative contribution 0.25 among <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> experienced infection vs. 0.30 among <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> did not). While the result that risk of bleeding had higher relative contribution than infection among <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> experienced infection may seem counter-intuitive, 10 out of 16 <b>patients</b> (62.5 %) <b>who</b> had infection also experienced bleeding. Similar to the overall analysis, fatigue and frequency of transfusion generally had lower but meaningful relative contribution (fatigue relative contribution ranged from 0.21 among patients diagnosed 3 or more years ago and <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> did not experience bleeding to 0.24 among <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> experienced bleeding). Among <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> {{did not have any}} transfusions in the past 3  months (proxy for transfusion independence), the relative contribution of the frequency of transfusions (0.25) was numerically higher than among <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> had transfusions in the past 3  months (0.14). While risk of bleeding had the highest relative contribution to preferences among patients without transfusion in the past 3  months (0.28), frequency of transfusion had a relative contribution, which was similar to that of risk of infection (0.25) and higher than that for fatigue (0.22).|$|R

5|$|In 1848, German anatomist Johann Heinrich Meckel {{recorded}} black-brown pigment granules in {{the blood}} and spleen of a <b>patient</b> <b>who</b> {{had died in a}} mental hospital. Meckel was thought to have been looking at malaria parasites without realizing it; he did not mention malaria in his report. He hypothesized that the pigment was melanin. The causal relationship of pigment to the parasite was established in 1880, when French physician Charles Louis Alphonse Laveran, working in the military hospital of Constantine, Algeria, observed pigmented parasites inside the red blood cells of malaria sufferers. He witnessed the events of exflagellation and became convinced that the moving flagella were parasitic microorganisms. He noted that quinine removed the parasites from the blood. Laveran called this microscopic organism Oscillaria malariae and proposed that malaria was caused by this protozoan. This discovery remained controversial until the development of the oil immersion lens in 1884 and of superior staining methods in 1890–1891.|$|E
