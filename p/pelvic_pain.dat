40|$|Objective: To {{estimate}} {{associations of}} progestin-only contraceptives with persistent <b>pelvic</b> girdle <b>pain</b> 18 months after delivery. Methods Prospective population based cohort study {{during the years}} 2003 – 2011. We included 20, 493 women enrolled in the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study who reported <b>pelvic</b> girdle <b>pain</b> in pregnancy week 30. Data were obtained by 3 self-administered questionnaires and the exposure was obtained by linkage to the Prescription Database of Norway. The outcome was <b>pelvic</b> girdle <b>pain</b> 18 months after delivery. Results: <b>Pelvic</b> girdle <b>pain</b> 18 months after delivery was reported by 9. 7 % (957 / 9830) of women with dispense of a progestin-only contraceptive and by 10. 5 % (1114 / 10, 663) of women without dispense (adjusted odds ratio 0. 93; 95 % CI 0. 84 – 1. 02). In sub-analyses, long duration of exposure to a progestin intrauterine device or progestin-only oral contraceptives was associated with reduced odds of persistent <b>pelvic</b> girdle <b>pain</b> (Ptrend = 0. 021 and Ptrend = 0. 005). Conversely, long duration of exposure to progestin injections and/or a progestin implant was associated with modest increased odds of persistent <b>pelvic</b> girdle <b>pain</b> (Ptrend = 0. 046). Early timing of progestin-only contraceptive dispense following delivery (≤ 3 months) was not significantly associated with persistent <b>pelvic</b> girdle <b>pain.</b> Conclusions: Our findings suggest a small beneficial effect of progestin intrauterine devices and progestin-only oral contraceptives on recovery from <b>pelvic</b> girdle <b>pain.</b> We cannot completely rule out an opposing adverse effect of exposure to progestin injections and/or progestin implants. However, the modest increased odds of persistent <b>pelvic</b> girdle <b>pain</b> among these users could {{be a result of}} unmeasured confounding...|$|R

40|$|Background: <b>Pelvic</b> girdle <b>pain</b> is {{commonly}} observed among pregnant women. Lack {{of knowledge about}} the condition is still an obstacle for developing effective interventions for this group of women. The aim of our study was to discover associations between pregnancy related <b>pelvic</b> girdle <b>pain</b> and various risk factors with main focus on the psychosocial area. In addition, our twenty-year-old data presented an interesting opportunity to investigate the possibility of a change in the prevalence over time. Method: The study population included 3346 women. With data from a clinical examination and two questionnaires, we performed two logistic regression analyses in order two test four hypotheses and answer our research question Can psychosocial stress explain variation in the prevalence of pregnancy related <b>pelvic</b> girdle <b>pain?</b> Results: 802 women, 24 %, of our study population, had experienced <b>pelvic</b> girdle <b>pain</b> in pregnancy. Due to large diversity in the definition of the condition, it was hard to find good comparisons that could verify a stable prevalence over time. Despite that, little evidence was found of an increase in the occurrence. One of the hypotheses concerning the existence of an association between <b>pelvic</b> girdle <b>pain</b> and emotional stress was supported. Neck pain, physician visits, headache and perceived health were predictors that contributed to support the hypothesis. In addition were parity, education, working shifts, social contact, fruit consumption and cohabitation significant explanatory variables in our models.

40|$|Background: The {{relationship}} between {{activation of the}} stabilizing muscles of the lumbopelvic region during the Active Straight Leg Raise test and <b>pelvic</b> girdle <b>pain</b> remains unknown. Therefore, {{the aim was to}} examine automatic contractions in relation to pre-activation in the muscles of the pelvic floor and the lower lateral abdominal wall during leg lifts, performed as the Active Straight Leg Raise test, in women with and without persistent postpartum <b>pelvic</b> girdle <b>pain.</b> Methods: Sixteen women with <b>pelvic</b> girdle <b>pain</b> and eleven pain-free women performed contralateral and ipsilateral leg lifts, while surface electromyographic activity was recorded from the pelvic floor and unilaterally from the lower lateral abdominal wall. As participants performed leg lifts onset time was calculated as the time from increased muscle activity to leg lift initiation. Findings: No significant differences were observed between the groups during the contralateral leg lift. During the subsequent ipsilateral leg lift, pre-activation in the pelvic floor muscles was observed in 36 % of women with <b>pelvic</b> girdle <b>pain</b> and in 91 % of pain-free women (P = 0. 01). Compared to pain-free women, women with <b>pelvic</b> girdle <b>pain</b> also showed significantly later onset time in both the pelvic floor muscles (P = 0. 01) and the muscles of the lower lateral abdominal wall (P amp;lt; 0. 01). Interpretation: We suggest that disturbed motor activation patterns influence womens ability to stabilize the pelvis during leg lifts. This could be linked to provocation of pain during repeated movements. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

40|$|Background: To {{examine the}} {{association}} among <b>pelvic</b> girdle <b>pain</b> (PGP), urinary incontinence (UI) and pelvic floor muscle (PFM) function in pregnant women in {{second and third}} trimester. Methods: 300 pregnant women who admitted for standard pregnancy care {{were enrolled in the}} study. Urinary incontinency was measured via the international consultation on incontinence questionnaire short form. <b>Pelvic</b> girdle <b>pain</b> was diagnosed according to existing guidelines. Vaginal examination assessed pelvic muscles contract- relax patterns and muscle strength. The software stata version 13 (Stata Corp., TX, USA) was used for data analysis. Results: Overall 300 women (150 with PGP and 150 without PGP) were included in final analyses. There was not significant differences between the demographic data including, body mass index before pregnancy, maternal age, mode of delivery. Prevalence of urinary incontinence in women with <b>pelvic</b> girdle <b>pain</b> was 41. 5 percent (CI 95 %: 32. 01 - 51. 48) while the prevalence of urinary incontinence in women without pain was 21. 9 percent (CI 95 %: 14. 99 - 30. 03). Using logistic regression, the relationship between urinary incontinence and <b>pelvic</b> girdle <b>pain</b> was significant. (CI 95 %: 1. 07 - 3. 31, P= 0. 02). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the relationship between PGP and pelvic floor muscle function and results showed that pelvic floor muscle strength in women with PGP was significantly lower than women without PGP.

30|$|<b>Pelvic</b> girdle <b>pain</b> (PGP) is a {{term used}} to {{describe}} pregnancy-related pain in the sacroiliac joint (SIJ), lumbosacral region, pubic symphysis, or in any combination of these joints. PGP is widespread, affecting {{nearly half of all}} pregnant women (Vleeming et al. 2008; Wu et al. 2004). PGP can be distinguished from pregnancy related low back pain (PLBP) by its character, intensity, and location; PLBP is mainly described as a “dull ache” in the lumbar region while PGP is mostly described as pain between the posterior iliac crest and gluteal fold that may radiate into the thigh (Gutke et al. 2008; Vermani et al. 2010). While PGP will resolve in most women within 4  months after giving birth, approximately 20  % of women will experience persistent symptoms, regardless of culture or economic condition (Aldabe et al. 2012; Björklund and Bergström 2000; Ostgaard and Andersson 1992). <b>Pelvic</b> girdle <b>pain</b> that begins during pregnancy and does not resolve, or pain that develops soon after pregnancy is termed postpartum <b>pelvic</b> girdle <b>pain</b> (PPGP) (Vermani et al. 2010).|$|R

40|$|Purpose We {{describe}} exercise {{level in}} mid-pregnancy, associated sociodemographic variables, and investigate {{the association between}} exercise in mid-pregnancy and subsequent low-back <b>pain,</b> <b>pelvic</b> girdle <b>pain</b> and depression at 32  weeks of pregnancy. Material and methods The study included 3482 pregnant women participating in the Akershus Birth Cohort study (response rate 80. 5 %). Data were collected by a questionnaire in pregnancy weeks 17 – 21, pregnancy week 32 and electronic birth journal. The results were analysed by logistic regression and are presented as crude (cOR) and adjusted OR (aOR) with 95 % CI. Results Only 14. 6 % of the respondents followed the current exercise prescription for exercise during pregnancy (≥ 3 times a week, > 20  min at moderate intensity). One-third of the study sample exercised less {{than once a week}} at pregnancy weeks 17 – 21. Women exercising either 1 – 2 times or ≥ 3 times a week at mid-pregnancy were more often primiparous, higher-educated and had less often prepregnacy body mass index > 30  kg/m 2 compared with women exercising less than once a week.
