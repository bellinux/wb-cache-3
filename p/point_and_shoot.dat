25|$|Bond's book {{of street}} {{photography}} <b>Point</b> <b>and</b> <b>Shoot,</b> {{was published by}} German fine arts publisher Hatje Cantz Verlag, in 2000; many of the images included imitate forms of photography that are derided or taboo, such as voyeurism and paparazzi photojournalism; other images are grainy and suggest surveillance or CCTV images—the photographer is either an intrusive, prying, nuisance, or else reduced to an automaton-like spectator on daily life.|$|E
25|$|Bond's {{visual art}} tends to {{appropriation}} and pastiche; he has exhibited work made collaboratively with YBA artists including a photograph made with Sam Taylor-Wood and the Documents Series, made with Liam Gillick. In the 1990s, Bond was a photojournalist working for British fashion, music, and youth culture magazine The Face. In 1998, his photobook of street fashions in London The Cult of the Street was published. His <b>Point</b> <b>and</b> <b>Shoot</b> (Cantz, 2000), explored the photo-genres of surveillance, voyeurism and paparazzi photojournalism.|$|E
500|$|The suit {{claimed that}} Thompson {{had been told}} by a sheriff's deputy that the game and a Sony PlayStation 2 were found at the ranch. The suit also claimed that the game taught Posey [...] "how to <b>point</b> <b>and</b> <b>shoot</b> a gun in a fashion making him an {{extraordinarily}} effective killer without teaching him any of the constraints or responsibilities needed to inhibit such a killing capacity." [...] Gary Mitchell, Posey's attorney, said Thompson contacted him [...] "numerous times" [...] before the trial, urging him to highlight the game in Posey's defense, but Mitchell said he [...] "just didn't find it had any merit whatsoever." ...|$|E

2500|$|Characterizing his {{conception}} of street photography, in a 1998 interview, Bond said: [...] " [...] {{is parallel to the}} psychoanalytic session, in that anything can be mentioned." [...] Bond began his street photography in the late-1990s and continued for approximately ten years concluding with his Interiors in 2005. Monograph books of Bond's street photography include two published in Germany – <b>Point</b> <b>and</b> <b>Shoot</b> (Ostfildern: Cantz) and La vie quotidienne (Essen: 20/21).|$|E
2500|$|Bond's {{follow up}} to <b>Point</b> <b>and</b> <b>Shoot,</b> Interiors Series was {{published}} in Belgium, in 2005, by Fotomuseum Antwerp. The photographs included in the book appear to explicitly and deliberately invade {{the privacy of the}} subjects, who are captured—unaware of the presence of a photographer—at leisure, in their private dwellings. Writing in an essay accompanying the photographs, Bond said, [...] "for me voyeuristic 'fixation' and the 'photographic act' have become inseparable. It is the sense of 'the illicit' that these photographs are leveraging. I must not be caught taking them, and in a way, the viewer of the photograph is included in my anti-social activity, they too are looking when they should not be." ...|$|E

5000|$|A combo {{guard is}} a {{basketball}} player who combines the attributes of a <b>point</b> guard (1) <b>and</b> <b>shooting</b> guard (2), but does not necessarily fit the standard description of either position. Such guards are usually within the 6' 2" [...] (1.88 m) and 6' 4" [...] (1.93 m) height range. Most combo guards tend to be between <b>point</b> <b>and</b> <b>shooting</b> guards in terms of height although some possess height of a point or shooting guard specifically which effects how each guard plays (taller guards tend to go inside more and get more rebounds, for instance.) ...|$|R
