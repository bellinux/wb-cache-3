2500|$|The [...] "iconic" [...] {{flying saucer}} {{of the film}} has been {{variously}} identified as a <b>paper</b> <b>plate</b> or a hubcap. According to the documentary Flying Saucers Over Hollywood, The Plan 9 Companion (1991) {{it was actually a}} recognizable model kit produced in 1956 by toy manufacturer Paul Lindberg. Lindberg Line model kits had introduced a flying saucer kit, roughly matching the popular image of UFOs of the time: [...] "a silver disc-shaped craft with a clear dome on top." [...] Inside the plastic dome was a little green man. Both a regular version of the assembled model and a modified version appear in the film.|$|E
2500|$|California, {{the largest}} state by {{population}} {{and number of}} registered vehicles, is unusual among the states in not requiring any form of temporary license plate. Newly-purchased vehicles typically drive around {{for a month or}} more with nothing but a dealer's advertisement or logo on a <b>paper</b> <b>plate</b> insert where the license plate would go; some drivers keep this and some remove it. This makes the new vehicle essentially [...] "untraceable," [...] both by plain visual observation by persons, and by automated means such as license-plate reading systems, red light cameras, and automatic number plate recognition. This has led to an epidemic of drivers of newly-purchased vehicles cheating tolls on bridges and toll roads where a transponder system is used instead of toll booths, causing the state to lose $15–19 million per year. Because of this, new state legislation was adopted in 2016 that will require temporary license plates in California beginning in 2019. This law was inspired by the hit-and-run death of a pedestrian who was struck by a car with dealer paper inserts: because it had no temporary plates, it was impossible to trace the suspect. California's lack of a temporary plate requirement has been jokingly known as the [...] "Steve Jobs loophole" [...] due to the former Apple CEO's habit of keeping rolling six-month leases on a series of Mercedes-Benz SL55 AMGs specifically to avoid having to put license plates on the cars. California's unusual lack of temporary plates is also taken advantage of by criminals, who know that a car driving with a dealer ad paper insert is both untraceable and will not raise suspicion.|$|E

40|$|Dynamic {{measurement}} of surface pressure {{is of particular}} interest in the field of Langmuir monolayers, where the change in surface pressure throughout an experiment can provide information on the properties of the monolayer forming material, or on the reaction kinetics of the monolayer’s interaction with other materials. One of the most common methods for the {{measurement of}} dynamic surface pressure is the Wilhelmy plate method. This method measures changes in the forces acting upon a thin plate of material at the air-water interface; this measurement is then converted to surface pressure. One version of this method, which uses filter <b>paper</b> <b>plates</b> at the air-water interface, is particularly popular due to their relatively low cost. However, it has been seen that the use of filter <b>paper</b> <b>plates</b> attached to a Wilhelmy balance requires an initial stabilisation period lasting several hours, during which the readings drift from the original baseline. Here the cause of this drift is explored, considering how changes in the weight of the plate over time influence the assumptions on which the surface pressure is derived from the measurements made by the Wilhelmy balance. A simple method for preventing this drift through pre-soaking of the filter <b>paper</b> <b>plates</b> is presented...|$|R
