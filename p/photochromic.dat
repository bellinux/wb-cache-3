5|$|<b>Photochromic</b> lenses include silver halides, so that {{ultraviolet}} light in natural daylight liberates metallic silver, darkening the lenses. The silver halides are reformed in lower light intensities. Colourless silver chloride films {{are used in}} radiation detectors. Zeolite sieves incorporating Ag+ ions are used to desalinate seawater during rescues, using silver ions to precipitate chloride as silver chloride. Silver is also used for its antibacterial properties for water sanitisation, but the application of this is limited by limits on silver consumption. Colloidal silver is similarly used to disinfect closed swimming pools; while it {{has the advantage of}} not giving off a smell like hypochlorite treatments do, colloidal silver is not effective enough for more contaminated open swimming pools. Small silver iodide crystals are used in cloud seeding to cause rain.|$|E
25|$|The dithienylethenes {{are also}} of {{interest}} {{for the fact that}} their isomerization requires very little change of shape. This means that their isomerization in a solid matrix can take place much more quickly than with most other <b>photochromic</b> molecules. In the case of some analogs, <b>photochromic</b> behavior can even be carried out in single crystals without disrupting the crystal structure.|$|E
25|$|Color {{in glass}} may be {{obtained}} by addition of electrically charged ions (or color centers) that are homogeneously distributed, and by precipitation of finely dispersed particles (such as in <b>photochromic</b> glasses).|$|E
25|$|Dithienylethene {{derivatives}} {{have shown}} {{different types of}} photochemical side reactions, e.g., oxidation or elimination reactions of the ring-closed isomer and formation of an annulated ring isomer as a byproduct of the <b>photochromic</b> reaction. In order to overcome the first, the 2-position of the thiophenes is substituted with a methyl group, preventing oxidation of the ring closed form. Also often the two free Î±-positions on the double bond are connected in a 5 or 6-membered ring in order to lock the double bond into the cis-form. This makes the dithienylethene undergo only open-closed ring isomerization, unconfused by E-Z isomerization. More recently, based on recent findings showing that by-product formation most likely occurs exclusively from the lowest singlet excited state, a superior fatigue resistance of dithienylethenes upon visible-light excitation has been achieved by attaching small triplet-sensitizing moieties to the diarylethene core via a -conjugated linkage.|$|E
25|$|Typically, the open-ring isomers are colorless compounds, {{whereas the}} closed-ring isomers have colors {{dependent}} on their chemical structure, due to the extended conjugation along the molecular backbone. Therefore, many diarylethenes have <b>photochromic</b> behavior both in solution and in solid state. Moreover, these two isomers differ from one another not only in their absorption spectra but also in various physical and chemical properties, such as their refractive indices, dielectric constants, and oxidation-reduction potentials. These properties can be readily controlled by reversible isomerization between the open- and closed-ring states using photoirradiation, and thus they have been suggested for use in optical data storage and 3D optical data storage in particular. The closed form has a conjugated path {{from one end of}} the molecule to the other, whereas the open form has not. This allows for the electronic communication between functional groups attached to the far ends of the diarylethene to be switched on and off using UV and visible light.|$|E
2500|$|Sunglasses provide {{improved}} {{comfort and}} protection against bright light and often against ultraviolet (UV) light. <b>Photochromic</b> lenses, which are photosensitive, darken when struck by UV light. [...] The dark tint of the lenses {{in a pair}} of sunglasses blocks the transmission of light through the lens.|$|E
50|$|Many {{inorganic}} substances also exhibit <b>photochromic</b> properties, often with much better resistance to fatigue than organic photochromics. In particular, silver chloride is extensively {{used in the}} manufacture of <b>photochromic</b> lenses. Other silver and zinc halides are also <b>photochromic.</b> Yttrium hydride is another inorganic material with <b>photochromic</b> properties.|$|E
50|$|<b>Photochromic,</b> thermochromic, solvatochromic and {{electrochromic}} {{characteristics of}} spiropyrans make them {{especially important in}} the technology area. Most of their applications are based on their <b>photochromic</b> properties.|$|E
50|$|The glass {{version of}} these lenses achieve their <b>photochromic</b> {{properties}} through the embedding of microcrystalline silver halides (usually silver chloride) {{in a glass}} substrate. Plastic <b>photochromic</b> lenses use organic <b>photochromic</b> molecules (for example oxazines and naphthopyrans) to achieve the reversible darkening effect. These lenses darken when exposed to ultraviolet light of the intensity present in sunlight, but not in artificial light.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{requirement}} of photochromism is two {{states of the}} molecule should be thermally stable under ambient conditions for a reasonable time. All the same, nitrospiropyran (which back-isomerizes in the dark over ~10 minutes at room temperature) is considered <b>photochromic.</b> All <b>photochromic</b> molecules back-isomerize to their more stable form at some rate, and this back-isomerization is accelerated by heating. There is therefore a close relationship between <b>photochromic</b> and thermochromic compounds. The timescale of thermal back-isomerization is important for applications, and may be molecularly engineered. <b>Photochromic</b> compounds considered to be [...] "thermally stable" [...] include some diarylethenes, which do not back isomerize even after heating at 80 C for 3 months.|$|E
5000|$|Because <b>photochromic</b> {{compounds}} fade back {{to their}} clear state by a thermal process, the higher the temperature, the less dark <b>photochromic</b> lenses will be. This thermal effect is called [...] "temperature dependency" [...] and prevents these devices from achieving true sunglass darkness in very hot weather. Conversely, <b>photochromic</b> lenses will get very dark in cold weather conditions. Once inside, away from the triggering UV light, the cold lenses take longer to regain their transparency than warm lenses.|$|E
50|$|Another {{group of}} spiropyrans which contain {{indoline}} or nitrogen heterocycles and the indolinospirothiapyrans found their application in film forms of <b>photochromic</b> materials using polyester resins. Those resins {{with a high}} refractive index were used to make <b>photochromic</b> lenses. Moreover, spiropyrans are being used in cosmetics.|$|E
5000|$|A {{spiropyran}} {{is a type}} {{of organic}} chemical compound, known for <b>photochromic</b> properties that provide this molecule with the ability of being used in medical and technological areas. Spiropyrans were discovered in the early twentieth century. However, it was in the middle twenties when Fisher and Hirshbergin observed their <b>photochromic</b> characteristics and reversible reaction. In 1952, Fisher and co-workers announced for the first time photochromism in spiropyrans. Since then, there have been many studies on <b>photochromic</b> compounds that have continued up to the present.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Photochromic</b> {{units have}} been {{employed}} extensively in supramolecular chemistry. Their ability {{to give a}} light-controlled reversible shape change means {{that they can be}} used to make or break molecular recognition motifs, or to cause a consequent shape change in their surroundings. Thus, <b>photochromic</b> units have been demonstrated as components of molecular switches. The coupling of <b>photochromic</b> units to enzymes or enzyme cofactors even provides the ability to reversibly turn enzymes [...] "on" [...] and [...] "off", by altering their shape or orientation in such a way that their functions are either [...] "working" [...] or [...] "broken".|$|E

50|$|<b>Photochromic</b> lenses are {{optical lenses}} that darken on {{exposure}} to {{specific types of}} light of sufficient intensity, most commonly ultraviolet (UV) radiation. In the absence of activating light the lenses return to their clear state. <b>Photochromic</b> lenses may be made of glass, polycarbonate, or another plastic. They are principally used in eyeglasses that are dark in bright sunlight, but clear in low ambient light conditions. They darken significantly within about a minute of exposure to bright light, and take somewhat longer to clear. A range of clear and dark transmittances are available.|$|E
50|$|The Automobile Association and the Federation of Manufacturing Opticians have {{produced}} guidance for selection of sunglasses for driving. Variable tint or <b>photochromic</b> lenses increase their optical density {{when exposed to}} UV light, reverting to their clear state when the UV brightness decreases. Car windscreens filter out UV light, slowing and limiting {{the reaction of the}} lenses and making them unsuitable for driving as they could become too dark or too light for the conditions. Some manufacturers produce special <b>photochromic</b> lenses that adapt to the varying light conditions when driving.|$|E
50|$|The <b>photochromic</b> {{parts and}} metal parts {{are so close}} that they can affect each other's {{molecular}} orbitals. The physical properties of these compounds shown by parts of them (i.e., chromophores or metals) thus can be controlled by switching their other sites by external stimuli. For example, photoisomerization behaviors of some complexes can be switched by oxidation and reduction of their metal parts. Some other compounds can be changed in their luminescence behavior, magnetic interaction of metal sites, or stability of metal-to-ligand coordination by photoisomerization of their <b>photochromic</b> parts.|$|E
50|$|Typically, <b>photochromic</b> lenses darken {{substantially}} {{in response to}} UV light in less than one minute, and continue to darken a little more over the next fifteen minutes. The lenses begin to clear {{in the absence of}} UV light, and will be noticeably lighter within two minutes, mostly clear within five minutes, and fully back to their non-exposed state in about fifteen minutes. A report by the Institute of Ophthalmology at the University College London suggested that at their clearest <b>photochromic</b> lenses can absorb up to 20% of ambient light.|$|E
50|$|Another {{collection}} of spiropyrans characterized for their sensitivity to UV radiation are detectors {{for the protection}} of organs, for the production of light filters with modulated transmission, or <b>photochromic</b> lenses.|$|E
5000|$|In spirocyclic compounds, the two rings share {{only one}} single atom, the spiro atom, {{which is usually}} a {{quaternary}} carbon. An example of a spirocyclic compound is the <b>photochromic</b> switch spiropyran.|$|E
