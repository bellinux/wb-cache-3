25|$|Opposition to the {{agreement}} has been centered with two main groups: <b>Protect</b> <b>Our</b> Water and Environmental Rights (POWER), an environmental organization, and local farmers from the Imperial Valley. POWER has argued for traditional methods of water conservation, such as reuse and recycling in urban areas {{in place of a}} transfer of water from the Salton Sea. The salinity of the lake has increased substantially, and conservationists argue that this has damaged the surrounding ecosystem. Restoration efforts have been championed by local politicians, as the Salton Sea is prominent for being the largest man-made lake in California.|$|E

25|$|Continuing {{with the}} {{knowledge}} obtained by the HERMES project (EC FP6), which contributed significantly {{to our understanding of}} deep-sea ecosystems, the HERMIONE project investigates ecosystems at critical sites on Europe's deep-ocean margin, aiming to make major advances in knowledge of their distribution and functioning, and their contribution to ecosystem goods and services. HERMIONE places special emphasis on human impact on the deep sea and on the translation of scientific information into science policy for the sustainable use of marine resources. To design and implement effective governance strategies and management plans to <b>protect</b> <b>our</b> deep seas for the future, understanding the extent, natural dynamics and interconnection of ocean ecosystems, and integrating socio-economic research with natural science, are important. To achieve this, HERMIONE uses a highly interdisciplinary and integrated approach, engaging experts in biology, ecology, biodiversity, oceanography, geology, sedimentology, geophysics and biogeochemistry, who will work alongside socio-economists and policy-makers.|$|E
