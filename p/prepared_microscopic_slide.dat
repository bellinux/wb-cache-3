25|$|Amateur Microscopy is the {{investigation}} and observation of biological and non-biological specimens for recreational purposes. Collectors of minerals, insects, seashells, and plants may use microscopes as tools to uncover features that help them classify their collected items. Other amateurs {{may be interested in}} observing the life found in pond water and of other samples. Microscopes may also prove useful for the water quality assessment for people that keep a home aquarium. Photographic documentation and drawing of the microscopic images are additional tasks that augment the spectrum of tasks of the amateur. There are even competitions for photomicrograph art. Participants of this pastime may either use commercially <b>prepared</b> <b>microscopic</b> <b>slides</b> or engage in the task of specimen preparation.|$|R

40|$|The European Consortium of Microbial Resource Centres (EMbaRC, www. embarc. eu) is a {{research}} infrastructure project gathering together major microbial Biological Resource Centres (BRCs) in Europe. These culture collections have a long and respected tradition in training people {{that are involved in}} microbial taxonomy, preservation and management. Advanced and bespoke courses on related topics add high value to the European educational community and create a knowledge-based training network. Under the framework of EMbaRC, the training programmes offered by the consortium were surveyed and schemes were proposed to establish an educational community to create a knowledge-based training network. This would implement lifelong educational and continuing professional development (CPD) schemes for those working within microbial resource centres (MiRC). In parallel, a European Masters Course on MiRC was designed to address the formal education path for strengthening competences in (1) Microbial Preservation Technologies, (2) MiRC: Organisation and Management, (3) QC Standards and International Regulations, (4) Microbial Biosafety and Biosecurity, and (5) IT Technologies and Database Management. Finally, to support these actions, materials for e-learning activities were developed such as videos related to microbial preservation techniques, the Gram-staining technique and, <b>preparing</b> <b>microscopic</b> <b>slides</b> of fungi. All activities developed under this EMbaRC task will support the MIRRI and other EU ESFRI-BMS and EMTRAIN projects...|$|R
40|$|Solar flare protons {{share many}} {{radiological}} health {{characteristics of the}} inner Van Allen Belt protons, and both types of radiation pose serious dangers {{to a number of}} missions planned. It is appropriate to evaluate crew dose determination procedures in terms of the type of radiation responsible for the major part of the projected exposure, i. e., protons in the neighborhood of 100 MeV. Monitoring chromosome abnormalities in peripheral lymphocytes is one method to determine an individual's accumulated radiation dosage. Cell culture and harvest is a relatively simple procedure and is well within the capabilities of a station health facility, but the evaluation of <b>prepared</b> <b>microscopic</b> <b>slides</b> is a time consuming and subjective procedure. This project is {{part of an effort to}} demonstrate the utility of automated image processing and evaluation procedures in expediting dose evaluation. The initial goal of this project is to produce a set of reference chromosome spreads produced from control lymphocytes and from lymphocytes exposed in whole blood to protons or gamma rays. The results of manual and automated aberration scoring will ultimately be compared to test for systematic differences between the two evaluation procedures and between the two radiation qualities. Proton irradiations are performed at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston Cyclotron Facility. Proton dosimetry is supplemented by TLD packets from and by assay of short-lived proton activation products in the irradiation blood samples...|$|R
40|$|Wood {{anatomy of}} five Cola species was {{investigated}} {{to identify and}} describe anatomical features in search of distinctive characters that could possibly {{be used in the}} resolution of their taxonomy. Transverse, tangential and radial longitudinal sections and macerated samples were <b>prepared</b> into <b>microscopic</b> <b>slides.</b> Characteristic similarity and disparity in the tissues arrangement as well as cell inclusions were noted for description and delimitation. All the five Cola species studied had essentially the same anatomical features, but the difficulty posed by the identification of Cola acuminata and Cola nitida when not in fruit could be resolved using anatomical features. Cola acuminata have extensive fibre and numerous crystals relative to Cola nitida, while Cola hispida and Cola millenii are the only species having monohydric crystals. Cola gigantica is the only species that have few xylem fibres while other species have extensive xylem fibre. These features have proved very functional and strongly of diagnostic value in the classification and delimitation of the studied Cola species. </span...|$|R
40|$|Background and Aim: Stress {{increasing}} {{which is}} a consequence of technological development can complicate the function of body organs and tissues. Regarding the role of the cerebellum in harmonizing physical movements, the present study was conducted to assess the effects of chronic stress on cerebella cortex of rats. Materials and Methods: Eighteen Wistar rats were randomly divided into two equal groups. One was the control group, and the other was the stress group (the experimental group). The stress group were exposed to different types of stress such as food deprivation, water deprivation, imposed restraint in 4 degrees C temperature, forced swimming, and isolation for 10 days while the animals in the control group were kept in their cages without any interventions. After the exposure time, the animals were anesthetized and their cerebellums were removed and weighed. After <b>preparing</b> <b>microscopic</b> <b>slides</b> of the right lobe and staining them with Hematoxiline and Eosin, the number and the size of Purkinje cells, and the thickness of the molecular layer of cerebella cortex were determined using Image Tool software. Finally, the obtained data was statistically compared and P< 0 / 05 was taken as the significant level. Results: The present study showed that mean number and mean size of Purkinje cells in the stress group significantly decreased (6. 17 ± 1. 87 and 89. 75 ± 14. 7, respectively) compared to those (8. 43 ± 1. 65 and 96. 68 ± 17. 25, respectively) of the control group (P< 0. 001, P< 0. 004), but the thickness of molecular layer of cerebellum in the stress group indicated no significant difference compared to the control group. Conclusion: The present study showed that chronic multiple sequential stresses can have negative effects by reducing the size and number of Purkinje cells in rat cerebella cortex...|$|R
40|$|Diagnostic {{methods in}} the case of the {{interesting}} group of Pycnogonida have so far altered in the last thirty vears, that it needs no apology on my part for attempting a revision of the descriptions of Australian Pycnogonida published by Professor Haswell in the early eighties. This revision has been made possible by the courtesy of the trustees and curator of the Australian Museum, who placed the holotypes at my disposal, and to whom I tender my best thanks. I have also to thank Professor S. J. Johnston of Sydney for the loan of other specimens collected for the use of his department. In the following description the specimens from the Australian Museum are indicated by the collection number. It is necessary to state that the holotypes have been preserved as microscope slides, and while this is a convenient method of preservation it has its disadvantages {{in the case}} of subsequent examinations. It is sometimes impossible, for example, to make out with any degree of certainty the arrangement and structure of the spines of the ovigers or even of its joints when, as is often the case, it is tucked under the body of the Pycnogonid on a microscope slide. Further, while every care has been taken with the measurements it must be remembered that the flattening of the specimen necessary in <b>preparing</b> a <b>microscopic</b> <b>slide,</b> alters very definitely the relation of breadth to length...|$|R
40|$|This is a karyotypic {{study of}} the masked palm civet, Paguma lavata (Carnivora, Viverridae). Blood samples were taken from one male and two females kept in Khao Khiew Open Zoo. After the {{standard}} whole blood lymphocyte culture at 37 ºC for 72 h. in presence of colchicine, metaphase spreads were <b>prepared</b> on <b>microscopic</b> <b>slides</b> and air-dried. Conventional staining and G-banding method were applied to stain the chromosome. The {{results showed that the}} number of diploid chromosomes of masked palm civet was 2 n = 44, the fundamental number (NF) was 72 in the male and female. The type of autosomes were 2 large metacentric, 6 large submetacentric, 6 large acrocentric, 2 large telocentric, 2 medium metacentric, 2 medium submetacentric, 2 medium acrocentric, 8 medium telocentric, 2 small metacentric, 2 small submetacentric, 2 small acrocentric and 6 small telocentric chromosomes. In addition, there was a pair of chromosome 17 with clearly observable satellite chromosome. X-chromosome is a large submetacentric and Y chromosome is the smallest submetacentric chromosome. From the G-banding technique, the number of bands and locations of G-band in masked palm civet was 141 and each chromosome pair could be clearly differentiated. The karyotype formula for the male and female masked palm civet is as follows: 2 n (44) = Lm 2 +Lsm 6 +La 6 + Lt 2 +Mm 2 +Msm 2 +Ma 2 +Mt 8 +Sm 2 +Ssm 2 +Sa 2 +St 6 + Sex-chromosom...|$|R
40|$|Fluoride {{intrusion}} into enamel surface {{is one of}} the important factors of success in topical fluoridation. Objective: to compare EDX and fluorescence measurement methods of fluoride {{intrusion into}} enamel surface after anchovy application. Methods: 5 extracted impacted third molars were  immersed in sterile saline solution for 24 hours. The buccal surfaces of teeth were painted with nail varnish, and a window of 5 mm 2 at the center of each surface was left unpainted. Dried anchovies from the market were heated and powdered, and 5 g of this anchovy powder was diluted in 100 ml deionized distilled water to prepare an anchovy solution. The teeth were immersed in the anchovy solution for 5 min twice a day with 3 hours intervals. Immersions were repeated for 9 days. After immersion, the teeth were cut transversally through the window. The occlusal portions of the specimens were <b>prepared</b> for <b>microscopic</b> <b>slides</b> at ± 40 µm thickness. The cervical portions of the teeth were used as EDX specimens. Olympus BX 41 TF Fluorescence microscope was used to measure fluorescence bandwith. LEO scanning electron microscope with micro analyzer was used to measure fluoride intrusion. Increment steps of 5 µm from outer edge of the enamel to inner side were used as the points of EDX analysis. Paired t-test was used to analyze the intrusion results. Results: Fluoride intrusion depth measured using the fluorescence method was 11. 49 ± 0. 71 µm, while from the results of EDX analysis the average depth of fluoride intrusion was 20. 24 ± 0. 57 µm. Statistical analysis showed significant difference between the two methods. Conclusion: Intrusion measurement using EDX analysis gives higher fluoride intrusion than the fluorescence method...|$|R

From X-ray diffraction analysis it was revealed that the thin films had good polycrystalline nature with highly preferred c-axis orientation along (0 0 2) plane. The optical characterization done by UV-Vis spectrometer showed that all the films had high transparency of 83 % to 96 % in the visible region and sharp cut off at ultraviolet region of electromagnetic spectrum. The band gap of the films decreased as their thickness increased. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) showed the presence of zinc and oxygen elements in the films and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) revealed the chemical composition of ZnO in the film...|$|R
