40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{investigate}} and report the relationship of intercollegiate sport participation to personal and professional benefits as perceived by selected graduates of Huntington College. The population for the study consisted of all four year graduates from 1972 through 1979 who received at least one varsity award. The population was divided by sex and academic college major. Thirteen tables were constructed to report data pertaining to: 1. aesthetic values 2. social skills and relationships with others 3. funding of programs and program encouragement 4. professional benefits 5. effect upon personal conduct and development 6. sports participation. The Galloway Inventory was adapted and used as a questionnaire. The data were obtained from one hundred-sixty questionnaires or a 78 percent rate of return. Some of the findings of the study were: 1. Intercollegiate sport participation is considered more important than informal competition. 2. More <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> <b>majors</b> are active in team sports activities than the non <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> <b>majors.</b> 3. One hundred percent of the male and female <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> <b>majors</b> disagreed expenditure of funds for a sports program is unnecessary and wasteful. 4. More men, majors and non majors, participate regularly in individual sports than do female majors or non majors. Based on the data some of the conclusions were: 1. Male and female <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> <b>majors</b> believe intercollegiate sport participation contributes to professional development. 2. Male and female non physical education major athletes do not agree intercollegiate sport participation contributes to providing skills necessary for vocational association. 3. Male and female <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> <b>majors</b> believe intercollegiate sport participation contributes to personal development. 4. Male and female non physical education athletes believe intercollegiate sport participation contributes to personal development. The following recommendations are based on the findings of the study: 1. A study should be conducted to determine the opinion of athletes participating in individual sports versus team sports. 2. A study should be conducted to determine if differences of opinion exist among athletes receiving a different number of awards. 3. A study should be undertaken to determine the perceptions of non athletes toward intercollegiate sport participation. Department of Educational LeadershipThesis (D. Ed. ...|$|E

Subjects were selected from students attending California State University, Northridge, in the Spring semester of 1974. Four groups: Freshman <b>Physical</b> <b>Education</b> <b>Majors,</b> Graduate <b>Physical</b> <b>Education</b> <b>Majors,</b> Freshman Psychology students, and Graduate Guidance and Counseling students, were given a Semantic Differential test instrument constructed by the investigator. There were twenty students in each group; ten male and ten female. The resulting data were analyzed by three methods: 1) A cross-group principal components analysis; 2) An analysis of variance for each concept; 3) Group profile analysis to measure attitudes involving the total test. The evaluation or "attitudinal??? dimension of the Semantic Differential was used for the analyses of variance and the profile analyses. The results of the analyses of variance showed that significant differences in attitudes were found for the main effect of academic interest classification on six of the thirteen concepts. Significant differences were found for the main effective of sex on two concepts, and {{no significant differences were found}} for the main effect of academic level. The interaction level of academic interest classification by sex on the concept of Sport as a Business was the only interaction to reach significance. [See more in text...|$|E

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study was to produce a {{videotape}} program utilizing the basic instructional aids for beginners in archery. Provisions for progression in competence in the sport geared to the students' interests was also an important consideration. Furthermore, the program was to be tested to determine if the students, after viewing the videotape, would reach certain predetermined levels of knowledge. [...] I An Introduction to Archery,' the title of the program, was produced at St. Clare's Mercy Hospital, in St. John's, Newfoundland, and dealt with a comprehensive body of knowledge that a beginning archer would require. [...] The participants of the study were twenty Grade Ten students from Gander, Newfoundland, and twenty <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> <b>majors</b> from Memorial University of Newfoundland. The pretest was administered to the students from Gander and they were then permitted to view the videotape production in total. For the Gander students the viewing was immediately followed by the posttest. In lieu of this test, the <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> <b>majors</b> at Memorial University of Newfoundland were given a reaction questionnaire to subjectively analyze the contents of the videotape and their reactions were tabulated. [...] Evaluation was attempted in three ways: (i) a t-test of dependent means, (ii) a Percentage Analysis, and (iii) an Item Analysis. [...] On the basis of the evaluative data a significant improvement from the pretest to the posttest period was evident in all students tested. Also, other investigative techniques, such as, the questionnaire and informal conversation gave further evidence which strongly suggested that demonstration by a skilled instructor on videotape resulted in (i) teaching beginning motor skills, (ii) providing uniformed-controlled presentation, and (iii) in arousing student interest in archery. The results of the project tended to suggest, then, that when live demonstrations by a skilled instructor are not available, video demonstrations are recommended. ...|$|E
