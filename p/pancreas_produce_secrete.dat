Hence, the phrase [...] "curing diabetes type 1" [...] means [...] "causing a maintenance or restoration of the endogenous ability of the body to produce insulin in response to the level of blood glucose" [...] and cooperative operation with counterregulatory hormones.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Introduction The granulocyte-colony {{stimulating}} factor-producing {{tumor was}} first reported in 1977, however, anaplastic pleomorphic type {{carcinoma of the}} <b>pancreas</b> <b>producing</b> granulocyte-colony stimulating factor is still rare. Case presentation A 63 -year-old man was admitted to our hospital with body weight loss (- 10 kg during months) and upper abdominal pain from 3 weeks. Abdominal computed tomography demonstrated a pancreatic tumor 10 cm in size and multiple low-density areas in the liver. On admission, the peripheral leukocyte count was elevated to 91, 500 /mm 3 and the serum concentration of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor was 134 pg/mL (normal, Conclusion This is a rare case report of anaplastic pleomorphic-type carcinoma of the <b>pancreas</b> <b>producing</b> granulocyte-colony stimulating factor and confirmed by immunohistochemistry. </p...|$|R

50|$|Acetohexamide lowers {{blood sugar}} by {{stimulating}} the pancreas to secrete insulin {{and helping the}} body use insulin efficiently.

The pressor effect of F 4 showed {{no difference between}} SHR and normal rats. Vascular lesions of the mesentery and <b>pancreas</b> <b>produced</b> by renal extracts were examined light microscopically and electron microscopically to compare the vascular necrotizing effects of renal extracts.

500|$|The men {{knew that}} the <b>pancreas</b> <b>produces</b> {{digestive}} juices in response to increased acidity in the duodenum and jejunum, because of the arrival of chyme there. By severing the duodenal and jejunal nerves in anaesthetized dogs, while leaving the blood vessels intact, then introducing acid into the duodenum and jejunum, they discovered that the process is not mediated by a nervous response, but by {{a new type of}} chemical reflex. They named the chemical messenger secretin, because it is secreted by the intestinal lining into the bloodstream, stimulating the pancreas on circulation. In 1905 Starling coined the term hormone—from the Greek hormao [...] meaning [...] "I arouse" [...] or [...] "I excite"—to describe chemicals such as secretin that are capable, in extremely small quantities, of stimulating organs from a distance.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Globally, {{more than}} 30 million people suffer from {{diabetes}} mellitus type 1 (T 1 DM) characterized by <b>pancreas</b> <b>producing</b> {{little or no}} insulin hormone to facilitate glucose entering cells for energy production. T 1 DM patients tend to suffer a higher overall rate of atherosclerosis, cancer, and end-stage renal failure. No drug or surgical therapy seems to halt its annual upward trend amongst children and young adults. Consequently, {{a significant number of}} sufferers turn to complementary or alternative therapies for help to arrest this chronic endocrine condition. This paper discusses how a well-designed evidence-based dietary and nutritional therapy with some lifestyle modifications might offer a solution for this highly complex autoimmune disorder.
