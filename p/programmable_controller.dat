They included a <b>programmable</b> <b>controller</b> that made the lights change colour and move in different patterns. However, the lights proved controversial; they cost the city $462,000, which was almost twice the city's original estimate. They also broke down frequently, fueling further complaints from the public about their high price tag.|$|E

50|$|Each {{thyristor}} module {{consists of}} a connection of 11 thyristors, to which there are parallel connections from a capacitaor and a resistor. The energy for the steering circuits of the thyristors is taken from the capacitator and resistor. As the thyristors and their steering electronics are on high voltage potential, the transmission of the ignition impulses from the control electronic on ground potential takes place via fibreoptical cables. A second optical waveguide cable allows the transmission of data from the thyristor module to the main control electronics on ground potential. A <b>programmable</b> <b>controller</b> of the system SIMATIC S5 is used for controlling this system.|$|E
50|$|Ladder logic {{has evolved}} into a {{programming}} language that represents a program by a graphical diagram based on the circuit diagrams of relay logic hardware. Ladder logic is used to develop software for programmable logic controllers (PLCs) used in industrial control applications. The name is based on the observation that programs in this language resemble ladders, with two vertical rails and a series of horizontal rungs between them. While ladder diagrams were once the only available notation for recording <b>programmable</b> <b>controller</b> programs, today other forms are standardized in IEC 61131-3 (For example, {{as an alternative to the}} graphical ladder logic form, there is also a more assembly language like format called Instruction list within the IEC 61131-3 standard.).|$|E
40|$|This {{project work}} {{is divided into}} two parts. The first part deals with the history and {{development}} of <b>Programmable</b> Logic <b>Controllers</b> and its subsequent applications in different industries. In The second part PLC was implemented to control 3 different processes namely lift car controller, Liquid level controller, Temperature controller. Automation of many different processes, such as controlling machines or factory assembly lines, is done through the use of small computers called a <b>programmable</b> logic <b>controller</b> (PLC). This is actually a control device that consists of a programmable microprocessor, and is programmed using a specialized computer language. Before, a <b>programmable</b> logic <b>controller</b> would have been programmed in ladder logic, which is similar to a schematic of relay logic. A modern <b>programmable</b> logic <b>controller</b> is usually programmed in any one of several languages, ranging from ladder logic to Basic or C. Typically, the program is written in a development environment on a personal computer (PC), and then is downloaded onto the <b>programmable</b> logic <b>controller</b> directly through a cable connection. The program is stored in the <b>programmable</b> logic <b>controller</b> in on-volatile memory. The <b>programmable</b> logic <b>controller</b> has made a significant contribution to factory automation. Earlier automation systems had to use thousands of individual relays and cam timers, but all of the relays and timers within a factory system can often be replaced with a single <b>programmable</b> logic <b>controller.</b> Today, <b>programmable</b> logic <b>controllers</b> deliver a wide range of functionality, including basic relay control, motion control, process control, and complex networking, as well as being used in Distributed Control Systems. There are several different types of interfaces that are used when people need to interact with the <b>programmable</b> logic <b>controller</b> to configure it or work with it. This may take the form of simple lights or switches or text displays, or for more complex systems, a computer of Web interface on a computer running a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system. <b>Programmable</b> logic <b>controllers</b> were first created to serve the automobile industry, and the first <b>programmable</b> logic <b>controller</b> project was developed in 1968 for General Motors to replace hard-wired relay systems with an electronic controller. The lift controller controls the movement of the lift. The program is designed to make the lift car move to the correct floor based on floor request. The temperature controller controls the temperature of the fluid based on a set point. The level controller controls the level of a liquid in a tank...|$|R

5000|$|More recently, PLCs are {{programmed}} using {{application software}} on personal computers, which now represent the logic in graphic form instead of character symbols. The computer {{is connected to}} the PLC through USB, Ethernet, RS-232, RS-485, or RS-422 cabling. The programming software allows entry and editing of the ladder-style logic. In some software packages, it is also possible to view and edit the program in function block diagrams, sequence flow charts and structured text. Generally the software provides functions for debugging and troubleshooting the PLC software, for example, by highlighting portions of the logic to show current status during operation or via simulation. The software will upload and download the PLC program, for backup and restoration purposes. In some models of <b>programmable</b> <b>controller,</b> the program is transferred from a personal computer to the PLC through a programming board which writes the program into a removable chip such as an EPROM ...|$|E
