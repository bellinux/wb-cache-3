2500|$|In 1811, Gay-Lussac and Thénard {{are thought}} to have {{prepared}} impure amorphous silicon, through the heating of recently isolated potassium metal with silicon tetrafluoride, but they did not purify and characterize the product, nor identify it as a new element. Silicon was given its present name in 1817 by Scottish chemist Thomas Thomson. He retained part of Davy's name but added [...] "-on" [...] because he believed that silicon was a nonmetal similar to boron and carbon. In 1823, Jöns Jacob Berzelius prepared amorphous silicon using approximately the same method as Gay-Lussac (reducing <b>potassium</b> <b>fluorosilicate</b> with molten potassium metal), but purifying the product to a brown powder by repeatedly washing it. As a result, he is usually given credit for the element's discovery. The same year, Berzelius became the first to prepare silicon tetrachloride; silicon tetrafluoride had already been prepared long before in 1771 by Carl Wilhelm Scheele by dissolving silica in hydrofluoric acid.|$|E

50|$|A. Scacchi first {{discovered}} cryptohalite in 1873. It {{appeared in a}} volcanic sublimate from the Vesuvian eruption of 1850. In 1926, W.A.K. Christie reported his own chemical study. A microscope was used to pick out enough material for analysis. Distilling with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) produced ammonia (NH3). The anions of hexafluorosilicic acid (H2SiF6) precipitated as <b>potassium</b> <b>fluorosilicate</b> (K2SiF6). Barium sulfate (BaSO4) was thrown into the filtrate, and then calcium fluoride (CaF2). Christie found 20.43% (NH4)+ and 78.87% (SiF6)2−.|$|E
5000|$|In 1787 Antoine Lavoisier {{suspected}} that silica {{might be an}} oxide of a fundamental chemical element. After an attempt to isolate silicon in 1808, Sir Humphry Davy proposed the name [...] "silicium" [...] for silicon, from the Latin silex, silicis for flint, and adding the [...] "-ium" [...] ending because he believed it was a metal. In 1811, Gay-Lussac and Thénard {{are thought to have}} prepared impure amorphous silicon, through the heating of recently isolated potassium metal with silicon tetrafluoride, but they did not purify and characterize the product, nor identify it as a new element.

40|$|The availability, low toxicity, {{and high}} degree of {{technological}} development make silicon the most likely material {{to be used in}} solar cells, the cost of solar cells depends entirely on cost of high purity silicon production. The present work was conducted to electrodeposite of silicon from K 2 SiF 6, an inexpensive raw material prepared from fluorosilicic acid (H 2 SiF 6) produced in Iraqi Fertilizer plants, and using inexpensive graphite material as cathode electrode. The preparation of <b>potassium</b> <b>fluorosilicate</b> was performed at (60 oC) in a three necks flask provided with a stirrer,while the electro deposition was performed at 750 oC in a three-electrodes configuration with melt containing in graphite pot. High purity <b>potassium</b> <b>fluorosilicate</b> (99. 25 %) was obtained at temperature (60 oC), molar ratio-KCl/H 2 SiF 6 (1. 4) and agitation (600 rpm). Spongy compact deposits were obtained for silicon with purity not less than (99. 97 %) at cathode potential (− 0. 8 V vs. Pt), K 2 SiF 6 concentration (14 % mole percent) with grain size (130 µm) and level of impurities (Cu, Fe and Ni) less than (0. 02 %) ...|$|E
40|$|By {{analogy with}} ketones, the name {{silicone}} {{was given in}} 1901 by Kipping to describe new compounds of the generic formula R 2 SiO. These were rapidly identified as being polymeric and actually corresponding to polydialkylsiloxanes, with the formulation: The name silicone {{was adopted by the}} industry {{and most of the time}} refers to polymers where R = Me (polydimethylsiloxane). The methyls along the chain can be substituted by many other groups, e. g., phenyl, vinyl or trifluoropropyl. The simultaneous presence of “organic ” groups attached to an “inorganic ” backbone gives silicones a combination of unique properties and allows their use in fields as different as aerospace (low and high temperature flexibility), electronics (high electrical resistance), medical (excellent bio-compatibility) and construction (resistance to weathering). The principal steps in the development of silicone chemistry are 1, 2 : • The discovery of silicon by Berzelius in 1824 from the reduction of <b>potassium</b> <b>fluorosilicate</b> with potassium: 4 K + K 2 SiF 6 → Si + 6 KF Reacting silicon with chlorine gave a volatile compound later identified a...|$|E
