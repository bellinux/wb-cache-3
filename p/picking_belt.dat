25|$|The winding {{engine was}} the source of power for hauling miners, {{equipment}} and coal up and down the shaft in a cage, the top of the shaft being in the adjacent heapstead, which encloses the frame holding the wheel around which the hoist cable travels. Inside the Heapstead, tubs of coal from the shaft were weighed on a weighbridge, then tipped onto jigging screens, which sifted the solid lumps from small particles and dust - these were then sent along the <b>picking</b> <b>belt,</b> where pickers, often women, elderly or disabled people or young boys (i.e. workers incapable of mining), would separate out unwanted stone, wood and rubbish. Finally, the coal was tipped onto waiting railway wagons below, while the unwanted waste sent to the adjacent heap by an external conveyor.|$|E
50|$|The {{new plant}} also {{included}} two elevators of steel construction and a 30 feet by 4 feet <b>picking</b> <b>belt.</b> The <b>picking</b> <b>belt</b> {{was used to}} facilitate the removal, by hand, of rock from the coal. Oversized pieces of coal could also be manually crushed with hammers. Elsewhere, skip haulage and hand-picking became obsolete but at Acland these methods continued to be used until the mine's closure. The elevators were used to convey the processed coal {{to the top of}} the hoppers for loading into train wagons. The <b>picking</b> <b>belt</b> and elevators survive intact at the mine.|$|E
50|$|The <b>picking</b> <b>belt</b> {{consists}} of a long conveyor belt. A raised deck runs {{the length of the}} southern side of the belt. Workers stood on this deck when sorting rocks from the coal. The gear mechanism and electric motor is located at the northern end of the belt. An electric control panel for the belt is located next to the deck opposite the belt. A second belt is located underneath the <b>picking</b> <b>belt.</b> This conveys the coal back towards the pithead.|$|E

50|$|The pithead, loading gantry and <b>picking</b> <b>belt</b> form a large, {{multi-level}} {{timber and}} corrugated iron structure that dominates the site. The structure contains {{most of the}} coal handling machinery. The tramway travels up an embankment and enters a large opening {{to the south of}} the structure, the railway siding passes underneath the western end and the loading gantry and <b>picking</b> <b>belt</b> project from the northern side. The floor of the pithead is wooden. Short wooden slats are fastened to the floor between the rails and on the northern side to provide purchase for feet when pushing the skips into position.|$|E
50|$|It {{is also a}} rare {{example of}} a mine demonstrating a {{transitional}} phase between hand and fully mechanised mining. The mine has an intact <b>picking</b> <b>belt</b> used to separate rock from coal and to crush oversized pieces of coal by hand {{before the advent of}} mechanical washing plants.|$|E
50|$|From the <b>picking</b> <b>belt,</b> {{the coal}} is carried to an {{elevator}}. The elevator {{consists of a}} chain loop to which is attached a series of metal buckets. The coal falls into the buckets and is conveyed via the chain {{to the top of}} the loading gantry. From here, the coal spills into the hopper that feeds the rail wagons parked on the siding.|$|E

50|$|Edwards fought {{once more}} for a title in January 2009 this time moving back down to {{flyweight}} to challenge once more for the still vacant British and Commonwealth flyweight titles. The fight in Edwards' home town of Stoke against fellow challenger Wayne Bloy saw Edwards <b>pick</b> up both <b>belts</b> when Bloy retired hurt in the fourth round. On 29 May 2009, Edwards made the first defence of his new title with a 12-round decision over a man he had defeated previously, Derby's Usman Ahmed. Edwards lost the title, fighting in Bolton to Shinny Bayaar, a Mongolian fighter who had recently gained British nationality making him eligible to the fight for the belt.|$|R
50|$|After {{crossing}} the weighbridge, the tramlines enter two tipplers. The tipplers comprise {{a section of}} track located between two metal hoops. The whole assembly pivots so when a skip is parked in the tippler, it can be tipped onto its side so the contents can be emptied. The first tippler empties via the space formerly occupied by the screening plant onto the <b>picking</b> <b>belt.</b> The second tippler, located at {{the western end of}} the pithead empties via a hopper into a wagon parked on the railway siding.|$|E
50|$|The mine is also {{important}} in demonstrating the development of mining technology insofar that it illustrates a transitional phase between hand mining methods and full mechanisation. The practise of sorting and sizing of coal by hand, commonly at the coalface, ceased {{with the introduction of}} aboveground screening plants and picking belts. These were used at Acland No 2 Colliery where the <b>picking</b> <b>belt</b> and part of the screen assembly remain intact. Picking belts, in turn, were rendered obsolete by mechanical washing plants such as jigs.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} {{research}} picking prototype related to our company's industrial waste sorting application. The {{goal of the}} prototype is to be as autonomous as possible and it both calibrates itself and improves its picking with minimal human intervention. The system learns to pick objects better based on a feedback sensor in its gripper and uses machine learning to choosing the best proposal from a random sample produced by simple hard-coded geometric models. We show experimentally the system improving its picking autonomously by measuring the pick success rate as function of time. We also show how this system can <b>pick</b> a conveyor <b>belt</b> clean, depositing 70 out of 80 objects in a difficult to manipulate pile of novel objects into the correct chute. We discuss potential improvements and next steps in this direction. Comment: 6 pages, 8 figure...|$|R

500|$|A breaker boy was a coal-mining {{worker in}} the United States and United Kingdom whose job was to {{separate}} impurities from coal by hand in a coal breaker.

50|$|That Sunday at The Great American Bash, Hawkins and Ryder won the WWE Tag Team Championship in a Four-Way Tag Team match. However, during Edge's WWE Championship {{match against}} Triple H, Fox {{attempted}} to hand Edge the WWE Championship belt {{to use as}} weapon, but was stopped with a clothesline by Vickie. Vickie then <b>picked</b> up the <b>belt</b> and prepared to use it, but Fox started fighting with her again and while the referee tried to separate the two women Edge attempted to spear the referee, who {{fell to the ground}} with Fox just beforehand resulting in Edge spearing Vickie. Triple H used this distraction to recover and hit a Pedigree to retain his title. The following week on SmackDown, Edge tried to apologize to all the members of La Familia, though after Bam Neely was unsure whether Edge wanted to apologize or wanted Vickie to apologize to him when reiterating the story. Edge closed the show in the ring, asking for forgiveness and blaming it all on Fox. Vickie came out and teased forgiveness, but at that moment, Vickie laughed evilly after she revealed that she had reinstated The Undertaker and booked the two in his specialty match, the Hell in a Cell, at SummerSlam.|$|R
60|$|The sun was {{two hours}} {{above the horizon}} when he got up, gaunt, dirty, white-faced, {{and looked at it}} with his red-rimmed eyes. His limbs obeyed him slowly, as if full of lead, yet without tremor; and the effect of that {{physical}} condition gave to his movements an unhesitating, deliberate dignity. He acted as if accomplishing some sort of rite. He descended into the gully; for the fascination of all that silver, with its potential power, survived alone outside of himself. He <b>picked</b> up the <b>belt</b> with the revolver, that was lying there, and buckled it round his waist. The cord of silence could never snap on the island. It must let him fall and sink into the sea, he thought. And sink! He was looking at the loose earth covering the treasure. In the sea! His aspect was that of a somnambulist. He lowered himself down on his knees slowly and went on grubbing with his fingers with industrious patience till he uncovered one of the boxes. Without a pause, as if doing some work done many times before, he slit it open and took four ingots, which he put in his pockets. He covered up the exposed box again and step by step came out of the gully. The bushes closed after him with a swish.|$|R

Breaker boys worked 10 hours a day for six days a week. The work was hazardous. Breaker boys were forced to work without gloves so that they could handle the slick coal better. The slate, however, was sharp, and boys would leave work with their fingers cut and bleeding. Many breaker boys lost fingers to the rapidly moving conveyor belts, while others, moving about the plant, had their feet, hands, arms, and legs amputated when they moved among the machinery and accidentally slipped under the belts or into the gears. Many died when they fell into the gears of the machinery, their bodies only retrieved {{at the end of the}} working day. Others were caught in the rush of coal, and crushed to death or smothered. The [...] "dry" [...] coal kicked up so much dust that the breaker boys sometimes wore lamps on their heads to see, and asthma and black lung disease were common.|$|R
40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 7 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Turkey, 19 - 21 July, 2010. One {{of the most important}} problems in ceramic industrial processes is the atomized slip conveying. Currently conveyor <b>belts</b> <b>pick</b> up the material from the bottom of spray dryer and they rise up it to stocking silos. By conveyor belts, the atomized slip crosses the working environment, so fine particles spread out causing dust pollution and generating dangers for workers' health (silicosis). The paper describes an innovative atomized slip pneumatic conveying to solve this problem. The software simulator "TPSimWin" is able to foresee thermo-hygrometric and fluid-dynamical parameters that give the characteristics request by the specific working process. The attention of this paper will be focused on fluid­-dynamical characteristics of the pneumatic conveying: both solid maximum conveying speed and speed gradient (i. e. the variation of solid's speed, in m/s, for unit length of pipe), need to be limited to guarantee wholeness of product. So the TPSimWin Software gives the necessary solid dynamic information to design correctly the pneumatic conveying plant. The outputs it gives are diagrams that show, step by step along the pipeline, the behaviour of air speed, solid speed, solid speed gradient and air pressure. The main goal {{of this paper is to}} introduce an innovative solution for the transport of atomized slip, taking in consideration the critical problem of material degradation and showing a solution to solve it. A method to ensure and to monitor thermo-hygrometric characteristics will be described in a second following paper. ej 201...|$|R
50|$|While Strychnine was away, she {{challenged}} for the GCW Light Heavyweight Championship numerous times, eventually <b>picking</b> up the <b>belt</b> in May 2003 in a three way dance against Makaze {{and former}} Ministry of Hate companion OuTtKaSt. She defended the title regularly, including a {{two out of}} three falls match against Sydal. During her tenure as champion she mentored the tag team of Nightbreed (Jackal and Cabal) and used them to continue to wage war on Greenpeace and Haze. Strychnine soon returned and by July 2003 was engaged in a feud with Diabolic Khaos, using his GCW Championship to compete against Delirious {{as a way to get}} to MsChif. At Adults Only 22 MsChif successfully defended her belt against Haze and later in the evening Strychnine and Delirious had a rematch over the GCW Championship. During the match powder was used as a weapon making it hard to see and MsChif swung her title belt accidentally knocking Delirious out with it before hitting Strychnine, but he fell over Delirious to pin him, regaining the championship. After several other meetings (in tag team matches and through managers) Strychnine finally had his chance to take revenge on MsChif when he was booked in a champion versus champion match at Challenge of Champions III. MsChif mocked Strychnine's former affections, hugging him but slapping him straight after and fetching the ring announcer's table which she soon found herself going through with a crucifix powerbomb; Strychnine feigned sympathy by pretending to carry her back to the dressing room only to tombstone piledrive her to win the match and take both belts.|$|R
50|$|During this time, the Taskmaster (frustrated by the humiliating defeat he had suffered) {{attempted}} to kill X by firing an incendiary arrow {{at him from}} underneath the ring in which he and Wolverine were fighting. Wolverine's enhanced senses alerted him to Taskmaster's presence and allowed him to anticipate the attack, which would have harmed him as well, and allowed {{him to get out}} of the way before it hit. To Wolverine's surprise, X also moved out of harm's way, as though he had also sensed the danger. As the fire from the arrow spread across the ring, temporarily separating the two combatants, Wolverine recalled X telling him that he had been able to feel a girl die when he was younger. Reminded of how Jean Grey had learned of her powers (by reading the mind of her childhood friend Annie when Annie was killed in a car accident in front of her), Wolverine surmised that X must have telepathic abilities enabling him to predict his opponent's moves. The natural solution to such a talent is not to think while fighting; to slip into a berserker fury as he had done during their second fight. He allowed himself to slip into a berserker rage and the tide immediately changed. Despite his skill, X was unable to predict Wolverine's moves. Wolverine, who is a highly skilled martial artist himself, soon had the advantage. The ring eventually collapsed but not before Wolverine had knocked X into one of the corners containing the championship <b>belt.</b> X <b>picked</b> up the <b>belt</b> and declared that he had won the match, which was technically true according to the rules of the tournament. Despite this, Wolverine was poised to deliver the death blow but Blok, once again, saved X's life.|$|R
5000|$|When he {{was home}} from England on a {{furlough}} last year, slight, dark-haired Private Clarence V. Bertucci relaxed with his family on Dryades Street in New Orleans. But when he left he mystified his kinfolk with a legend he penciled on the doorsill: [...] "Live & let live." [...] One evening last week Private Bertucci, stationed at Salina, Utah, abandoned his motto. First {{he had a few}} beers in town. He chatted with some Salina girls, stopped off at a cafe for coffee, strolled out to the temporary camp at Main Street's east end, where 250 German prisoners of war slept. A cooling breeze rustled through the tents and the dusty town. At midnight Private Bertucci climbed a tower, relieved the guard. Below him lay the silent tent-city whose occupants, next morning, would be out in the fields, thinning beets. A [...]30-caliber machine gun pointed into the sky. Private Bertucci <b>picked</b> up a <b>belt</b> of cartridges, carefully threaded it into the gun. He had never been in action, but he knew how to work a machine gun. He lowered the muzzle and, aiming carefully, pressed the trigger. Methodically he swept the 43 tents, from left to right and back again. Screams and strangled shouts came from the tents. Above the screams, Private Bertucci heard an officer shouting at him. A corporal panted up to take Bertucci off the tower. As the Army buried eight prisoners at Fort Douglas last week, and treated 20 more for wounds, Bushnell General Hospital psychiatrists examined Private Bertucci. Ninth Service Command officers admitted that Bertucci's record already showed two courts-martial, one in England. His own calm explanation seemed a little too simple: he had hated Germans, so he had killed Germans.|$|R
