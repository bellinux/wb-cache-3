40|$|Abstract Background Pulsed wave (<b>PW)</b> <b>Doppler</b> {{echocardiography}} {{has become}} a routine non invasive cardiac diagnostic tool in most species. However, evaluation of intracardiac blood flow requires reference values, which are poorly documented in goats. The {{aim of this study}} was to test the repeatability, the variability, and to establish the reference values of PW measurements in healthy adult Saanen goats. Using a standardised <b>PW</b> <b>Doppler</b> echocardiographic protocol, 10 healthy adult unsedated female Saanen goats were investigated three times at one day intervals by the same observer. Mitral, tricuspid, aortic and pulmonary flows were measured from a right parasternal view, and mitral and aortic flows were also measured from a left parasternal view. The difference between left and right side measurements and the intra-observer inter-day repeatability were tested and then the reference values of <b>PW</b> <b>Doppler</b> echocardiographic parameters in healthy adult female Saanen goats were established. Results As documented in other species, all caprine <b>PW</b> <b>Doppler</b> parameters demonstrated a poor inter-day repeatability and a moderate variability. Tricuspid and pulmonary flows were best evaluated on the right side whereas mitral and aortic flows were best obtained on the left side, and reference values are reported for healthy adult Saanen goats. Conclusions <b>PW</b> <b>Doppler</b> echocardiography allows the measurement of intracardiac blood flow indices in goats. The reference values establishment will help interpreting these indices of cardiac function in clinical cardiac cases and developing animal models for human cardiology research. </p...|$|E
40|$|Pulsed Wave (<b>PW)</b> <b>Doppler</b> is a ow imaging {{modality}} {{in which the}} velocity distribution of the blood ow in a spatial region is displayed over time. In this work, methods for improvement of the conventional <b>PW</b> <b>Doppler</b> technique are evaluated using mathemathical models, in vitro and in vivo studies. The rst part of the thesis is {{an evaluation of the}} use of sparse sequences for simultaneous <b>PW</b> <b>Doppler</b> and Bmode imaging, the second part investigates properties of the recently proposed 2 -D Tracking Doppler method, and in particular the feasibility of this method for cardiac applications. In conventional PW Doppler/B-mode duplex ultrasound, packets of B-mode and Doppler transmissions are interleaved, producing undesirable gaps in the Doppler data. In this context, several sparse sequence methods have been proposed in which <b>PW</b> <b>Doppler</b> spectra are generated from observation windows containing missing samples. In this work we show that sparse sequence methods have two signi cant weaknesses. Firstly, it is shown that long reverberation times lead to discontinuities in the signal from stationary clutter after each B-mode interruption. Secondly, using frequency analysis, it is shown that clutter ltering of non-uniformly sampled data may introduce artifacts in the velocity spectrum. Methods are presented for quanti cation of these e ects, and their severity in clinical applications are shown using in vivo examples. Two-dimensional (2 -D) tracking Doppler is a proposed alternative to <b>PW</b> <b>Doppler,</b> in which the sample volume follows the trajectory of the blood scatterers over time. Compared to <b>PW</b> <b>Doppler,</b> 2 -D tracking Doppler has longer observation time of individual scatterers and therefore reduced transit time broadening. An extensive signal model is presented and is, in addition to in vitro and in vivo recordings, used to evaluate properties of the 2 -D tracking Doppler technique. It is shown that the spectra have lowest bandwidth and maximum power when the tracking angle is equal to the beam-to- ow angle, which may be used for automatic angle correction. In vitro studies and simulations indicate that automatic angle correction using tracking Doppler may be more accurate than manual angle correction, especially for high beamto- ow angles. The feasibility of using 2 -D tracking Doppler for maximum velocity estimation in cardiac jet ow was investigated using simulations, in vitro and in vivo recordings. The results indicate that the - 6 dB relative broadening of tracking Doppler spectra is smaller than 5...|$|E

40|$|Much of {{the current}} {{knowledge}} of human cardiovascular pathologies and treatment strategies has been gained from understanding the cardiac physiologies and functions in small animal models, such as mice, rats, and zebraflsh. In this paper, we present {{the development of a}} high-frame-rate duplex ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) capable of B-mode imaging and pulsed-wave (<b>PW)</b> <b>Doppler</b> measurement for in vivo cardiovascular investigation in small animals. A frame rate of 200 frames per second (fps) was accomplished at a view of 5 mm times 8 mm, using a novel highspeed sector probe and specially designed lightweight transducers. In a reduced lateral view of 1. 2 mm, a frame rate of 400 fps was achieved to examine more detailed cardiac motion. The UBM utilized transducers with different center frequencies (40 - 75 MHz) and geometries, which made it useful for various applications in small animal cardiac imaging. The highest spatial resolution the UBM achieved was 25 mum times 56 mum. In addition, the image-guided <b>PW</b> <b>Doppler</b> implemented in the UBM demonstrated the detection of the velocity of a moving wire as low as 0. 1 mm/s, and flow in a polyimide tube as small as 200 mum in diameter. Furthermore, the UBM achieved a 15 -muV minimal detectable signal and a 60 -dB dynamic range using a low-cost PCB-based design. Finally, sample in vivo cardiac images of mouse and zebraflsh hearts were given.

Since endothelial dysfunction is generalized, we hypothesized that carotid artery (CA) reactivity would also be altered in hypertension. Purpose To compare (CA endothelium-dependent vasodilation {{in response to}} mental stress in normal and hypertensive subjects. Methods We evaluated CA reactivity to mental stress in 10 young healthy human volunteers (aged 23 Â± 4 years), 20 older healthy volunteers (aged 49 Â± 11 years) and in 28 patients with essential hypertension (aged 51 Â± 13 years). In 10 healthy volunteers and 12 hypertensive subjects, middle cerebral artery (MCA) <b>PW</b> transcranial <b>Doppler</b> was performed before and 3 minutes after mental stress. Results Mental stress by Stroop color word conflict, math or anger recall tests caused CA vasodilation in young healthy subjects (0. 61 Â± 0. 06 to 0. 65 Â± 0. 07 cm, p Conclusion Mental stress produces CA vasodilation and is accompanied {{by an increase in}} CA and MCA blood flow in healthy subjects. This mental stress induced CA vasodilation and flow reserve is attenuated in subjects with hypertension and may reflect cerebral vascular endothelial dysfunction.

BACKGROUNDPulsed Doppler parameters have limited accuracy for the estimation of Pw because they are determined by left atrial pressure and other parameters such as ventricular relaxation. Recently, a good correlation has been found between the rate of ventricular relaxation (Ï, tau) and FPV measured by color M-mode Doppler echocardiography. METHODSWe studied 20 patients who underwent invasive hemodynamic monitoring. By multilinear regression analysis, the relationships between <b>Pw</b> and <b>Doppler</b> parameters, FPV, and a noninvasive estimate (Pest) based on the Weissâ equation (substituting tau for 1 /FPV) were determined. A simplified index based on the results obtained was then tested in an additional group of 34 patients. RESULTSBy multiple regression analysis only isovolumic relaxation time (IVRT) (p = 0. 0096) and Pest(p = 0. 0043) were related to Pw. A derived empirical index, 103 /([2 Â·IVRT]+FPV), was strongly correlated with Pw in the entire group according to the regression equation Pw = 4. 5 Â·(103 /[{ 2 Â·IVRT} + FPV]) â 9 (r = 0. 89, p 15 mm Hg were 90 % and 100 %, respectively.

Disintegration of the endothelial monolayer was quantitatively analyzed by counting intercellular gaps in light microscopy. No gaps were observed in CA application without sonication. Only few gaps appeared at sonication without CA application in 2 DE at MI= 1. 6 and in PW- and Power Doppler at TIS >= 0. 4 and MI >= 0. 4. The number of gaps increased significantly with the gradual increase of US output and to a comparably lesser but also significant extent with CA concentrations. Diagnostic contrast echocardiography may induce endothelial disintegrations dependent on US output {{as well as on}} CA concentrations.

In this study, we aimed to analyse left ventricular systolic and diastolic functions using tissue Doppler imaging (TDI). 30 patients with ASp and 30 healthy volunteers having the similar demographic characteristics were included. Left ventricular systolic and diastolic functions were assessed by using two dimensional (2 D) echocardiography, M-mode, pulsed-wave (<b>PW)</b> and tissue <b>Doppler</b> echocardiography. The peak systolic velocity (Sm), early diastolic myocardial peak velocity (m), late diastolic myocardial peak velocity (Am), isovolumic acceleration (IVA), myocardial precontraction time (PCTm), myocardial contraction time (CTm), myocardial relaxation time (RTm), and myocardial performance index (MPI) were measured at septal and lateral mitral annulus. In conventional echocardiography, end-diastolic interventricular septum and posterior wall diameters were higher in patients with ASp than the control group.

Right and left cardiac catheterization were performed in 20 patients within 24 hours before ED. Mitral area obtained by Doppler method (Hatle's formula) correlated highly with both echo- 2 dimensional and hemodynamic area (r = 0. 93, p less than 0. 001; r = 0. 95, p less than 0. 001 respectively). It was possible to calculate systolic pulmonary pressure, in patients with tricuspid incompetence, (43. 9 +/- 14. 9 mmHg, range 25 - 80) which correlated significantly (r = 0. 95, p less than 0. 001) with hemodynamic data (40. 2 +/- 12. 7 mmHg, range 20 - 70). The left atrial-left ventricular pressure gradient was 15. 6 +/- 6. 9 mmHg, range 6 - 32; the mean pressure gradient was 8. 4 +/- 3. 7 mmHg, range 3 - 17; the pressure half time 170. 2 +/- 62. 3 ms, range 83 - 330. We observed different types of direction of transmitral jets: centrally directed (n = 34); forward antero-lateral wall (n = 28); toward interventricular septum (n = 5).

40|$|Purpose: Ultra-fast cardiac imaging (frame rate (FR) ~ 500 Hz for a 90 Â° sector) can be {{achieved}} by transmitting a plane wave (PW) instead of a focused beam. This increased temporal resolution is at the expense of spatial resolution, reducing 2 D image quality. However, for functional imaging, temporal resolution gain might outbalance reduced spatial resolution. We aimed to, at an initial stage of development, test the feasibility of PW imaging for myocardial motion estimation in normals. Methods: The septum was imaged in 10 healthy volunteers from the apex by <b>PW</b> and Colour <b>Doppler</b> Myocardial Imaging (CDMI), both with 2. 5 MHz transducers. A PW transmit combined with 4 parallel receive beams was implemented on an Epsilon Ultra DCI 5000, using B-mode imaging at FR of 212 Hz. CDMI data were obtained with a GE Vivid E 9. A similar FR was achieved by adjusting the opening angle. Mid-septal velocity profiles were extracted from both datasets. The Sum of Absolute Differences was used to obtain the velocity trace from the RF data from the PW system and a commercial software package (GE EchoPac) was used to extract it from the CDMI data. The peak systolic (S') and early (E') /late (A') diastolic velocities were extracted from the PW and CDMI traces. Results: Peak velocity values were comparable between the two modalities: CDMI S' 5. 4 Â± 0. 8, PW S' 5. 7 Â± 1. 9, CDMI E' â 8. 5 Â± 2. 3, PW E' â 7. 6 Â± 2. 2, CDMI A' â 5. 11 Â± 1. 5 PW A' â 4. 4 Â± 1. 6, all cm/s, P> 0. 05. Figure 1 shows positive correlations between PW and CDMI values. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate the feasibility of PW in functional cardiac imaging. The available hardware allowed for a 4 x increase in acquisition rate which could be increased with multiple beamformers.

40|$|Ultrasound imaging {{of blood}} flow is in {{widespread}} use for assessment of atherosclerotic disease. Imaging of the carotid arteries is of special interest, as blood clots from atherosclerotic plaques may follow the blood stream {{to the brain}} with fatal consequences. Color flow imaging and <b>PW</b> <b>Doppler</b> are important tools during patient examination, providing {{a map of the}} mean velocities in an image region and the full velocity spectrum in a small region of interest respectively. However they both suffer from limitations which may hamper patient diagnostics. Recent technological advances have enabled an increased acquisition rate of ultrasound images, providing possibilities for further improvement in robustness and accuracy of color flow and <b>PW</b> <b>Doppler</b> imaging. Based on these advances, we aimed to utilize the high acquisition rate to enable robust vector Doppler imaging, where both velocity magnitude and direction is estimated. Additionally, we wanted to incorporate information from several parallel receive beams in spectral Doppler, which is currently limited to velocity estimation in a limited region of a single beam. Two limitations in conventional <b>PW</b> <b>Doppler</b> are especially considered, namely the trade-off between temporal and spectral resolution, and the increased spectral broadening in situations of high velocity or large beam-to-flow angles. By utilizing information from several parallel receive beams, we show that by applying adaptive spectral estimation techniques, it is possible to obtain high quality <b>PW</b> <b>Doppler</b> spectra from ensembles similar to those found in conventional color flow imaging. A new method to limit spectral broadening is also presented, and we show spectra with improved resolution and signal-to-noise ratio for a large span in beam-to-flow angles. Plane wave vector Doppler imaging was investigated using both realistic simulations of flow in a (diseased) carotid artery bifurcation, and in vivo studies. It was found that the plane wave approach could provide robust vector velocity estimates at frame rates significantly higher than what is found in conventional blood flow imaging. The technique was implemented in a research ultrasound system, and a feasibility study was performed in patients with carotid artery disease. Promising results were found, showing an increased velocity span and the successful capture of complex flow patterns. All together, the proposed techniques may provide more efficient clinical tools for vascular imaging, as well as quantitative information for research into new markers for cardiovascular disease.

It is defined as the sum of isovolumetric contraction and relaxation times divided by ventricular ejection time. The interval âaâ is from the cessation to onset of mitral or tricuspid inflow. The interval âbâ is derived from the duration of the left or right ventricular outflow. The Tei index is then calculated by the formula (a-b) / b. It was originally described from pulsed wave <b>Doppler</b> (<b>PW).</b> Many human medical studies have used different echocardiographic techniques for comparisons of this index, resulting in inconsistent interpretation; little information can be obtained for canine echocardiography. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether measurement of the Tei index using M-mode is comparable to that using PW. M-mode and PW measurements of the left ventricular Tei index (LVTX) were performed in thirty-six clinically healthy dogs. The reference values for LVTX-M-mode and LVTX-PW were 0. 24 Â± 0. 08 and 0. 34 Â± 0. 16 (mean Â± SD), respectively. Significant different results were detected (p< 0. 05) between the two methods. Such difference can be explained by the distinction of âaâ interval, which was significantly shorter using M-mode (219 Â± 18 ms) than PW (229 Â± 27 ms) (p< 0. 05). Moreover, the LVTX-M-mode (0. 69) showed smaller variance than the LVTX-PW measurement (2. 5). There were no significant correlations between the LVTX obtained from either method and body weight and heart rate, respectively. M-mode, the simplest echocardiographic modality and universally available, thus offers a highly accurate means of assessing valve motions. Because of the difficulty in clearly defining the borders of PW waves, these time intervals were relatively easier to obtain by using M-mode. Conclusively, this is the first report of the LVTX simultaneously obtained from M-mode and PW in canine echocardiography. More importantly, the LVTX measurements are independent of patients' body conditions. Adding it up, our perspective is that M-mode can provide a reliable alternative method for measuring the LVTX in the objective evaluation of canine ventricular functions. ä¸­ææè¦ [...] . i è±ææè¦ [...] ii ç®é [...] . iii è¡¨æ¬¡ [...] . v åæ¬¡ [...] vi ç¸®å¯«å°ç§ [...] . vii ç¬¬ä¸ç«  ç·è¨ [...] 1 ç¬¬äºç«  æç»æ¢è¨ [...] 3 ç¬¬ä¸ç¯ ä»¥è¶é³æ³¢è©ä¼°å¿èåè½ [...] 3 ä¸ãæ¶ç¸®åè½çè©ä¼° [...] . 3 äºãèå¼µåè½çè©ä¼° [...] . 4 ç¬¬äºç¯ Tei index ä¹æ¢è¨ [...] 5 ä¸ãTei index å®ç¾©åæ¸¬éèè¨ç®æ¹å¼ [...] . 5 äºãå·¦å¿å®¤ Tei index èè¡æ¶²ååå­¸çéä¿ [...] 7 ç¬¬ä¸ç¯ æ¢è¨å½±é¿å·¦å¿å®¤ Tei index çå ç´  [...] . 8 ä¸ãå¹´é½¡ [...] . 8 äºãå¿è·³æ¬¡æ¸ [...] . 9 ä¸ãè² è·çæ³ (loading condition) [...] 10 (ä¸) åè² è· (preload) çæ¹è®å°å·¦å¿å®¤ Tei index çå½±é¿ [...] . 10 (äº) å¾è² è· (afterload) çæ¹è®å°å·¦å¿å®¤ Tei index çå½±é¿ [...] . 11 åãæ¶ç¸®å (contractility) [...] 13 ç¬¬åç¯ å·¦å¿å®¤ Tei index æ¼å¿èç¾ççè¨åºæç¨ [...] 13 ä¸ãé¬±è¡æ§å¿è¡°ç«­ (congestive heart failure) [...] 13 äºãç£èç¾ç (valvular disease) [...] . 15 (ä¸) äºå°ç£éæµ (mitral regurgitation) [...] 15 (äº) ä¸»åèç£éæµ (aortic regurgitation) [...] 16 ä¸ãæ´å¼µæ§å¿èç (dilated cardiomyopathy) [...] . 17 åãAnthracycline ç¸éä¹å¿æ¯æ§ (cardiotoxicity) [...] . 18 ç¬¬äºç¯ æ¯è¼ä¸åæ¸¬éæ¹å¼æå¾ä¹å·¦å¿å®¤ Tei index [...] . 18 ç¬¬ä¸ç«  ææèæ¹æ³ [...] . 25 ç¬¬ä¸ç¯ å¯¦é©ç ç©¶ç¬é» [...] . 25 ç¬¬äºç¯ éè¦åå¨åè¨­å [...] . 25 ç¬¬ä¸ç¯ å¯¦é©æ¹æ³ [...] . 25 ä¸ãçå­¸æª¢æ¥ [...] 25 (ä¸) åºç¤è³æå»ºç« [...] . 25 (äº) åºç¤ççæ¸å¼ [...] . 25 (ä¸) åè¨º [...] . 26 (å) è¦è¨º [...] . 26 (äº) è§¸è¨º [...] . 26 (å­) è½è¨º [...] . 26 äºãè¡å£æª¢æ¥ [...] 26 ä¸ãå¿çµ²è²æè²æåæª¢æ¥ [...] 26 åãè¸èæ¾å°ç·å­¸æª¢æ¥ [...] 27 äºãå¿é»åæª¢æ¥æ¥ [...] 27 å­ãå¿èè¶é³æ³¢æª¢æ¥ [...] 27 ä¸ãçµ±è¨åæ [...] 28 ç¬¬åç«  çµæ [...] . 36 ç¬¬ä¸ç¯ ç ç©¶ç¬é»ä¹åºæ¬è³æ [...] . 36 ç¬¬äºç¯ çµæèçµ±è¨åæ [...] . 36 ä¸ãä»¥ M-mode å PW æ¸¬é a interval [...] . 36 äºãä»¥ M-mode å PW æ¸¬é b interval [...] . 37 ä¸ãä»¥ M-mode å PW æ¸¬éå·¦å¿å®¤ Tei index [...] 37 åãå¿è·³æ¬¡æ¸è®ç° (heart rate variability) ä¹åæ [...] 37 äºãå¥åº·ç¬é»å¿èè¶é³æ³¢åèå¼å»ºç« [...] 37 å­ãé«éåå¿è·³æ¬¡æ¸è M-mode æ¹å¼æ¸¬éå¼ç¸éæ§ä¹åæ [...] 37 ä¸ãé«éåå¿è·³æ¬¡æ¸è PW æ¹å¼æ¸¬éå¼ç¸éæ§ä¹åæ [...] 38 ç¬¬äºç«  è¨è« [...] . 50 åèæç» [...] 5...|$|R

We analysed echocardiographic findings of patients operated on for AoCo in the University Hospital for Children in Riga {{during the first}} year of life to evaluate the long-term findings. Fifty-nine children underwent surgical correction of AoCo at the age of 55 Â± 61 days. The methods of surgical correction were anastomosis end-to-end (ETE) in 29 % (n = 17), subclavian flap aortoplasty (SFA) in 64 % (n = 38) and extended anastomosis end-to-end (EETE) in 7 % (n = 4). Recoarctation developed in 15 patients (25 %) with no difference between surgical techniques (P > 0. 05). The recoarcation patients had left ventricle hypertrophy (left ventricle mass index (LVMi) 76 Â± 19 g/m 2. 7) normalising after angioplasty (LVMi 42 Â± 7 g/m 2. 7).

40|$|The {{commonly}} used simulation method Field II, {{which is based}} on the spatial impulse response approach, has excellent accuracy in linear domain. However the computational time can be up to many days for one simulation. One of the solutions to this problem is a convolution-based methodology called COLE. It is much faster than Field II and has very good approximation. It generates the data by reducing multi-dimensional convolution model to multiple single-dimensional convolutions. This thesis is about implementing COLE on the FieldSim 3 platform and using it for blood flow imaging. This platform is written in MATLAB with object-oriented programming and it is now under development at department of circulation and medical imaging. Both Field II and real scanner have been used to compare with COLE. The simulated phantom for both simulators was a straight tube with scatterers moving inside, whereas a string phantom was used to get the data from the scanner. The computational time of COLE with 2 D Doppler mode scan in FieldSim 3 achieved 85 times faster than Field II. The plotted <b>PW</b> <b>Doppler</b> spectra and the 2 D power spectra showed that the velocity resolutions of both simulators were at the same level.

A steady flow loop model was used to test the infiuence of the presence of a concentric obstruction of 84 % area reduction positioned at a distance of lo, 20 and 30 tube diameters, either proximal or distal to the stenosis under study. The stenosis under evaluation was either concentric or eccentric and had a percentage of area reduction ranging from 20 % to 91 %. An ultrasound color Doppler system was used to perform both pulsed-wave (<b>PW)</b> <b>Doppler</b> and color-flow vekity measure-ments. VRs were computed by dividing the maxhnum velocity of the jet by the velocity at 6 and 10 diameters both proximal and distal to the stenosis under study. A strong correlation was obtuiued between VR computed using color flow and <b>PW</b> <b>Doppler</b> velocities (r = 0. 99).

From a curve fit model, the measured percentages of stenosis were calculated from the VR data and compared to the true percentages. The correlation coefficient, r, was 0. 95. When the proximal and distal stenoses were at 10 diameters of the stenosis investigated, r was 0. 91, while it increased to 0. 98 when the distance was 20 diameters or more.

40|$|Left atrial electrocardiographic (ECG) {{abnormalities}} {{have been}} reported as common findings in hypertension; however, their relationships with atrial anatomy are still uncertain. In addition, in arterial hypertension several studies demonstrated an abnormal left ventricular filling. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the relationships of the ECG signs of left atrial abnormality to atrial anatomy and left ventricular filling as evaluated by pulsed-wave (<b>PW)</b> <b>Doppler</b> in a group of patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension. To this end, 53 untreated essential hypertensive patients (age 44 +/- 8 years; blood pressure 160. 5 +/- 21. 5 / 104. 7 +/- 13. 5 mm Hg) underwent a complete 12 -lead ECG and a <b>PW</b> <b>Doppler</b> study of the transmitral flow velocities. The ECG criteria of left atrial abnormality were: P wave wider than 0. 12 (or 0. 10) second or higher than 0. 25 mV in lead II; P wave/PR segment ratio (Macruz index) greater than 1. 6 in lead II; and P wave terminal forces in lead V 1 equal to or more negative than 0. 04. Echocardiographic measurements were made according to American Society of Echocardiography (ASE) convention. Doppler parameters of left ventricular filling were measured as E and A peak velocity, A/E ratio, and the ratio between the velocity-time integral under the E peak and that of the whole diastolic flow, which represents the rapid filling fraction (RFF). At least one ECG sign of atrial abnormality was present in 34 patients (64 %); the Macruz index gave the most common ECG index of atrial abnormality (31 patients...|$|E
40|$|Ultrasound imaging {{of blood}} {{flow in the}} heart and blood vessels has become an {{essential}} part of diagnosing diseases related to the circulatory system. By using different Doppler methods, the blood flow may be visualized or quantified. In this work we take advantage of the opportunities given by the introduction of parallel processing of ultrasound data to develop new quantitative Doppler methods. Pulsed wave (<b>PW)</b> <b>Doppler</b> is a technique for measuring blood velocities, providing the full velocity spectrum in a specific region of interest. The maximum velocities may be found by delineation of the spectral envelope, and may be used to estimate the severity of stenoses or valve leakages. However, <b>PW</b> <b>Doppler</b> suffers from several challenges, which makes quantitative analysis problematic. To limit spectral broadening, we created a new method called 2 -D tracking Doppler, which incorporates information from several parallel receive beams. Spectra with improved resolution and signal-to-noise ratio were produced for a large span of beam-to-flow angles. The new method was tested using in vitro and in vivo recordings. A signal model was derived and the expected Doppler power spectra were calculated, showing good agreement with experimental data. Experiments were performed to investigate how the 2 -D tracking Doppler method depends on the tracking angle. It was shown that the spectra have lowest bandwidth and maximum power when the tracking angle is equal to the beam-to-flow angle. This may facilitate new techniques for velocity calibration. It was shown that the velocity calibration errors may be lower for the 2 -D tracking Doppler method than for a conventional <b>PW</b> <b>Doppler</b> approach, and especially for large beam-to-flow angles. In heart disease, the quantification of valve regurgitation is a remaining challenge. In this thesis, we have investigated a new technique to estimate the size of regurgitant jets using spectral Doppler and parallel beamforming. A modality that uses high pulse repetition frequency 3 -D Doppler was devised, to isolate the backscattered signal power from the vena contracta, that is the narrowest flow region of a regurgitant jet. A simulation study was performed to test and optimize the new method, suggesting a feasible setup for the transmit- and receive beams. Cross-sectional power Doppler images of simulated regurgitations of various sizes were generated, and the regurgitant volumes were accurately estimated. Since the velocity-time integral and the orifice area are extracted from a single recording, the proposed method may give more robust volume estimates than methods where the velocities and the area are measured from separate recordings.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundTransmitral {{pulse wave}} (<b>PW)</b> <b>Doppler</b> and annular tissue Doppler {{velocity}} measurements provide valuable diagnostic and prognostic information. However, {{they depend on}} an echocardiographer manually selecting positions to make the measurements. This is time-consuming and open to variability, especially by less experienced operators. We present a new, automated method to select consistent Doppler velocity sites to measure blood flow and muscle function. MethodsOur automated algorithm combines speckle tracking and colour flow mapping to locate the septal and lateral mitral valve annuli (to measure peak early diastolic velocity, Eâ²) and the mitral valve inflow (to measure peak inflow velocity, E). We also automate peak velocity measurements from resulting <b>PW</b> <b>Doppler</b> traces. The algorithm-selected locations and time taken to identify them were compared against a panel of echo specialists â the current âgold standardâ. ResultsThe algorithm identified positions to measure Doppler velocities within 3. 6 Â± 2. 2 mm (mitral inflow), 3. 2 Â± 1. 8 mm (septal annulus) and 3. 8 Â± 1. 5 mm (lateral annulus) of the consensus of 3 specialists. This was less than the average 4 mm fidelity with which the specialists could themselves identify the points. The automated algorithm could potentially reduce the time taken to make these measurements by 60 Â± 15 %. ConclusionsOur automated algorithm identified sampling positions for measurement of mitral flow, septal and lateral tissue velocities as reliably as specialists. It provides a rapid, easy method for new specialists and potentially non-specialists to make automated measurements of key cardiac physiological indices. This could help support decision-making, without introducing delay and extend availability of echocardiography to more patients...|$|E

Conventional Pulsed Wave (<b>PW)</b> <b>Doppler</b> analysis of diastolic function sometimes fails to distinguish physiological from pathological LVH. The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate the role of Pulsed Wave Tissue Doppler Imaging in differentiating pathological from physiological LVH in the middle-aged population. Methods we selected a group of 80 master athletes, a group of 80 sedentary subjects with essential hypertension and an apparent normal diastolic function at standard <b>PW</b> <b>Doppler</b> analysis. The two groups were comparable for increased left ventricular wall thickness and mass index (134. 4 Â± 19. 7 vs 134. 5 Â± 22. 1 gr/m 2; p >. 05). Diastolic function indexes using the PW technique were in the normal range for both. Results Pulsed Wave TDI study of diastolic function immediately distinguished the two groups. While in master athletes the diastolic TDI-derived parameters remained within normal range (E' 9. 4 Â± 3. 1 cm/sec; E/E' 7. 8 Â± 2. 1), in the hypertensive group these parameters were found to be constantly altered, with mean values and variation ranges always outside normal validated limits (E' 7. 2 Â± 2. 4 cm/sec; E/E' 10. 6 Â± 3. 2), and with E' and E/E' statistically different in the two groups (p Conclusion Our study showed that the TDI technique can be an easy and validated method to assess diastolic function in differentiating normal from pseudonormal diastolic patterns and it can distinguish physiological from pathological LVH emphasizing the eligibility certification required by legal medical legislation as in Italy. </p...|$|E

BACKGROUNDFeasibility of contrast-enhanced transthoracic Doppler recording (in both second harmonic and fundamental mode) of blood flow velocity in the LAD has not been assessed. Adenosine has a greater vasodilator potency and more favorable kinetics than dipyridamole and thus it can be more suitable for assessing CFR in conjunction with this method. METHODSSixty-one patients with angiographically patent LAD underwent CD (both in fundamental and harmonic mode) as well as color-guided pulsed wave (<b>PW)</b> <b>Doppler</b> recording of blood flow velocity in the distal LAD before and after intravenous contrast injection. A second group of patients (n = 77), undergoing coronary angiography, was submitted to transthoracic contrast-enhanced <b>PW</b> <b>Doppler</b> recording of blood flow velocity in the LAD using harmonic CD as a guide, at rest and during adenosine-induced hyperemia. RESULTSHarmonic CD along with echo contrast consistently improved blood flow detection in the LAD; the success rate in detecting flow of optimal quality was 88 % with this approach, whereas it was 11 % and 16 % with CD in fundamental mode, respectively, before and after contrast. Pulsed wave Doppler results paralleled those of harmonic CD (p 75 % stenosis in 34 patients (group III). There was a significant difference in CFR among the three groups of patients; CFR for peak diastolic velocity was (mean Â± SD) : 2. 88 Â± 0. 7 (group I), 2. 09 Â± 0. 5 (group II) and 1. 51 Â± 0. 5 cm/s (group II) (p < 0. 05 group I vs. both group II and group III; p < 0. 05 group II vs. group III). The whole examination took less than 10 min. CONCLUSIONSContrast-enhanced second harmonic Doppler recording of blood velocity in the LAD is highly feasible and in combination with adenosine it is a rapid, safe and effective method for assessing CFR ratio...|$|E

This paper presents the development of a real-time compact and open system for customized ultrasound bio-microscope studies. The system design was based on high speed FPGA embedded in compact printed circuit board (PCB) to achieve B-mode imaging and pulsed-wave (<b>PW)</b> <b>Doppler</b> imaging. Instead of hardware circuitries, most of functions were achieved with FPGA programs such as filter, envelope detector, digital scan converter (DSC), and complex fast Fourier transform (CFFT). The system structure could easily be modified by the user for customized applications. Testing results showed that the system could offer a minimum detectable signal of 25 Î¼V, allowing a 51 dB dynamic range at 47 dB gain. PCI interface included in the system allowed fast radio frequency (RF) data transfer and real-time imaging (over 500 frames per second). Phantom and in vivo imaging experiments were conducted and results showed good performance of system. Department of Health Technology and InformaticsRefereed conference pape...|$|E
