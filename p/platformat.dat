The results showed that the inhibition effectiveness {{is a function of the}} nature and the families â€™ contents of hy products on one hand and of the physicochemical properties such as: solubility and concentration (cmc) on other hand. It increases in the direction: <b>platformat,</b> kerosene, gasoil and crude oil. The examination of the isotherms showed that adsorption verifies the model of Temkin for the crude and the model of Frumkin in the other cases.
