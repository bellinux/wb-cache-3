5|$|Smith {{reported}} in his autobiography, during one run from Omaha to Cheyenne, {{that he had}} had to ditch into a pasture, landing on a cow. He sent a laconic telegram to his division supervisor at headquarters in College Park, Maryland, reporting the mishap. Crashes were <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>job.</b> Engines were unreliable, and pilots were using road maps. Unpredictable, bad weather was a constant risk. In {{the first five years of}} US Post Office air mail service the average forced landing was every 800 miles and a pilot was killed about every 80,000 miles. Thirty-five pilots died during the Postal Service's operation of air mail flights; most deaths were between 1920 and 1925.|$|E
5|$|MT 87 {{begins at}} the MontanaIdaho state line, {{traveling}} through Raynolds Pass. The highway proceeds northward, intersecting a small road before entering rural areas within Gallatin National Forest. The route continues northeast, intersecting several forest roads before bending northwestward. The route intersects several small roads while it runs parallel to a small creek. It crosses over the Madison River after passing several small buildings. The highway continues northwestward to its northern terminus, an at-grade intersection with US 287. The highway is maintained by the Montana Department of Transportation (MDT). <b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> of the MDT is to measure traffic along the highway. These counts are taken using a metric called annual average daily traffic (AADT). This is a statistical calculation of the average daily number of vehicles that travel along {{a portion of the}} highway. In 2011, the highway had an AADT count of 583 vehicles. No portion of the highway is listed as part of the National Highway System (NHS), a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility.|$|E

Butter makers started sculpting their products at the fair as far back as 1898, although the head-sculpting tradition didn't begin until 1964.|$|E

They have to act this way, because of the co-operative relationships they necessarily have to work with in the division of labour. People have to conform to them, whether they like it or not.

50|$|Although <b>the</b> {{division}} <b>of</b> {{labor is}} {{often viewed as}} inevitable in a capitalistic society, several specific problems may arise.

25|$|Juin was {{promoted}} to Général d'armée. He was given a tumultuous welcome from the populace when he entered Tunis after the Allies captured the city in May. De Gaulle appointed Mast as Resident-General in Tunisia, but Mast was injured in an air crash, and Juin was asked to fill in for him. In this role, Juin joined General Dwight D. Eisenhower, Général d'armée Henri Giraud, Admiral Sir Andrew Cunningham, Air Chief Marshal Sir Arthur Tedder and Lieutenant General Kenneth Anderson on the review stand for the victory parade on 20 May. A less savoury <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> was informing the Muhammad VII al-Munsif, the Bey of Tunisia, {{that he was being}} deposed.

500|$|They {{sought to}} make Enterprise more {{character}} driven than the previous series in the Star Trek franchise, and hoped that this would gain viewers who had watched The Next Generation but had lost interest with Deep Space Nine and Voyager. It was intended to link the series directly into The Original Series by having T'Pau as a main character, who had previously appeared in the episode [...] "Amok Time". Instead, this character was developed into an original Vulcan character, T'Pol. Berman explained his vision for the series at launch, saying that [...] "we'll be seeing humanity when they truly are going where no man has gone before. We are seeing people who don't take meeting aliens as just another <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>job.</b> It's not routine. Nothing is routine. Also, by bringing it back 200 years from Voyager, we're making the characters closer to the present, and by doing {{that they can be}} a little bit more accessible and a little bit more flawed and a little bit more familiar to you and me." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{highway is}} {{maintained}} by the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT). <b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> of the TxDOT is to measure traffic along the highway. These counts are taken using a metric called annual average daily traffic (AADT). This is a statistical calculation of the average daily number of vehicles that travel along {{a portion of the}} highway. The TxDOT usually measures AADT near an intersection. In 2011, the highway's AADT was 530 vehicles, taken at a point just north of the intersection with TX 72. This was an increase from the previous year, when the count was just 330 vehicles, which was taken at the same point. This was a decrease from 2009, when the AADT for the route was 390 vehicles. No portion of the roadway is listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility. RE8 is currently the only route in the Recreational Road system to deviate from the system criteria. The TxDOT defines a Recreatonal Road as a route which travels [...] "to a recognized recreational area", while RE8 serves Choke Canyon State Park.|$|E

2500|$|Over the {{following}} weeks, Zucker grew weary with O'Brien's performance {{and what he}} regarded as a booking of the wrong stars. When a controversy erupted over a joke Letterman told regarding politician Sarah Palin's family, Zucker eagerly pushed the O'Brien camp to bring her on their show, eyeing an opportunity to regain viewers and perhaps make it {{a turning point for}} a show not doing particularly well. O'Brien disliked the idea, finding it pandering to viewers that would alienate fans and the press, as well as hurt his relationship with Letterman. [...] "This reaction drove Zucker nuts", wrote Bill Carter in The War for Late Night. [...] "As a producer, he knew how to manipulate audiences—that was simply what you did as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>job.</b> [...] As a boss, he couldn’t believe Conan would {{stand in the way of}} what was obviously the smart business move—for him and his network." [...] Meanwhile, Letterman continued to score higher ratings than O'Brien with regularity; his fall interview with President Barack Obama topped The Tonight Show by over 2.6 million viewers, and the next week, a scandal involving attempted extortion and personal affairs made him the talk of the country. By August, The Tonight Show was still losing to Letterman in total viewers, but, owing to O'Brien's appeal to a young audience, maintained its lead in the touted demographics.|$|E
