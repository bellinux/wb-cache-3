50|$|Civilians, under Colonel Bradford, {{conducted}} much of {{the business}} of the arsenal until October 25, 1865, when the first permanently assigned detachment of enlisted men were stationed here.

These new recruits of the regular army were quickly trained by Bradford to receive the large amount of arms and equipment being turned in by Ohio regiments rapidly being deactivated. Civilian employees were retained to repair, in the main building, the Springfield and Enfield rifle muskets turned in by either cannibalizing or by adding new parts shipped in from the Springfield Armory. The rule was, if a piece could be made serviceable for fifty cents or less, to do so; if not, utilize only the unworn parts.|$|R
5000|$|Marines {{address all}} enlisted {{personnel}} by rank, and all commissioned officers with [...] "sir" [...] or [...] "ma'am".

During recruit training, recruits are indoctrinated to address all superiors as [...] "sir" [...] or [...] "ma'am". Addressing a commissioned officer (or any rank) as [...] "Mister" [...] has long been considered a grievous insult towards the individual.

5|$|Denzel Washington is an American {{actor who}} made his feature film debut in Carbon Copy (1981). In 1982, Washington made his first {{appearance}} in the medical drama St. Elsewhere as Dr. Philip Chandler. The role {{proved to be the}} breakthrough in his career. He starred as <b>Private</b> <b>First</b> <b>Class</b> Melvin Peterson in the drama A Soldier's Story (1984). The film was an adaptation of the Off-Broadway play A Soldier's Play (1981–1983) in which Washington had earlier portrayed the same character. In 1987, he played Steve Biko, an anti-apartheid activist in the Richard Attenborough-directed drama Cry Freedom, for which he received his first nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Two years later, Washington won the award for playing Trip, a former slave-turned-soldier in Civil War film Glory (1989). In 1990, he played the title character in the play The Tragedy of Richard III, and starred in Spike Lee's comedy-drama Mo' Better Blues.

From a hill at 12:00, after the fog had lifted, the men looked down on the Battle of Yongsan which was then in progress.
