40|$|Lignin, elemental, {{and stable}} carbon isotope {{compositions}} are reported for local plants and for coarse (> 63 pm) and fine (~ 63 pm) suspended particulate materials collected along a 1, 950 -km {{reach of the}} lower Amazon River during four contrasting stages of the 1982 - 1983 hydrograph. Fluxes of chemically recognizable lignin in the two size classes generally parallel each other along the mainstem with the fine fraction usually predominating. Particulate organic matter transported in the coarse size fraction of the mainstem and its major tributaries is composed of recently formed and well <b>preserved</b> <b>tree</b> leaf debris along with some wood. Organic matter in the fine size fraction is comparatively old, degraded, and rich in immobilized nitrogen and derives primarily from soils. C- 4 grasses, which are abundant in the mainstem floodplain (varzea), are not major components of either the coarse or fine particulate material in the river. Particulate organic matter in both size fractions is introduced largely from upstream sources within the Rio Solimoes and Rio Madeira drainage basins. Most of this organic matter is unreactive and is transported conservatively with mineral particles along the Amazon mainstem. However, some downstream compositional trends are seen in both size fractions which reflect the additio...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{the large}} size and highly {{heterogeneous}} spatial distribution of deadwood, the time scales involved in the coarse woody debris (CWD) decay of Picea abies (L.) Karst. and Larix decidua Mill. in Alpine forests have been poorly investigated and are largely unknown. We investigated the CWD decay dynamics in an Alpine valley in Italy using the five-decay class system commonly employed for forest surveys, based on a macromorphological and visual assessment. For the decay classes 1 to 3, most of the dendrochronological samples were cross-dated to assess the time that had elapsed since tree death, but for decay classes 4 and 5 (poorly <b>preserved</b> <b>tree</b> rings) and some others not having enough tree rings, radiocarbon dating was used. In addition, density, cellulose and lignin data were measured for the dated CWD. The decay rate constants for spruce and larch were estimated {{on the basis of}} the density loss using a single negative exponential model. In the decay classes 1 to 3, the ages of the CWD were similar varying between 1 and 54 years for spruce and 3 and 40 years for larch with no significant differences between the classes; classes 1 – 3 are therefore not indicative for deadwood age. We found, however, distinct tree species-specific differences in decay classes 4 and 5, with larch CWD reaching an average age of 210 years in class 5 and spruce only 77 years. The mean CWD rate constants were 0. 012 to 0. 018 yr⁻¹ for spruce and 0. 005 to 0. 012 yr⁻¹ for larch. Cellulose and lignin time trends half-lives (using a multiple-exponential model) could be derived {{on the basis of the}} ages of the CWD. The half-lives for cellulose were 21 yr for spruce and 50 yr for larch. The half-life of lignin is considerably higher and may be more than 100 years in larch CWD...|$|E

40|$|Due to {{the large}} size (e. g. {{sections}} of tree trunks) and highly heterogeneous spatial distribution of deadwood, the timescales involved in the coarse woody debris (CWD) decay of Picea abies (L.) Karst. and Larix decidua Mill. in Alpine forests are largely unknown. We investigated the CWD decay dynamics in an Alpine valley in Italy using the chronosequence approach and the five-decay class system {{that is based on}} a macromorphological assessment. For the decay classes 1 – 3, most of the dendrochronological samples were cross-dated to assess the time that had elapsed since tree death, but for decay classes 4 and 5 (poorly <b>preserved</b> <b>tree</b> rings) radiocarbon dating was used. In addition, density, cellulose, and lignin data were measured for the dated CWD. The decay rate constants for spruce and larch were estimated {{on the basis of the}} density loss using a single negative exponential model, a regression approach, and the stage-based matrix model. In the decay classes 1 – 3, the ages of the CWD were similar and varied between 1 and 54 years for spruce and 3 and 40 years for larch, with no significant differences between the classes; classes 1 – 3 are therefore not indicative of deadwood age. This seems to be due to a time lag between the death of a standing tree and its contact with the soil. We found distinct tree-species-specific differences in decay classes 4 and 5, with larch CWD reaching an average age of 210 years in class 5 and spruce only 77 years. The mean CWD rate constants were estimated to be in the range 0. 018 to 0. 022  y⁻¹ for spruce and to about 0. 012  y⁻¹ for larch. Snapshot sampling (chronosequences) may overestimate the age and mean residence time of CWD. No sampling bias was, however, detectable using the stage-based matrix model. Cellulose and lignin time trends could be derived on the basis of the ages of the CWD. The half-lives for cellulose were 21 years for spruce and 50 years for larch. The half-life of lignin is considerably higher and may be more than 100 years in larch CWD. Consequently, the decay of Picea abies and Larix decidua is very low. Several uncertainties, however, remain: ¹⁴C dating of CWD from decay classes 4 and 5 and having a pre-bomb age is often difficult (large age range due to methodological constraints) and fall rates of both European larch and Norway spruce are missing...|$|E
