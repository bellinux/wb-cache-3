5|$|It {{is thought}} that boron plays several {{essential}} roles in animals, including humans, but the exact physiological role is poorly understood. A small human trial published in 1987 reported on <b>postmenopausal</b> women first made boron deficient and then repleted with 3 mg/day. Boron supplementation markedly reduced urinary calcium excretion and elevated the serum concentrations of 17 beta-estradiol and testosterone.|$|E
5|$|Clear cell {{carcinoma}} is a Type II endometrial tumor {{that makes up}} less than 5% of diagnosed endometrial cancer. Like serous {{cell carcinoma}}, it is usually aggressive and carries a poor prognosis. Histologically, it {{is characterized by the}} features common to all clear cells: the eponymous clear cytoplasm when H stained and visible, distinct cell membranes. The p53 cell signaling system is not active in endometrial clear cell carcinoma. This form of endometrial cancer is more common in <b>postmenopausal</b> women.|$|E
5|$|Serous {{carcinoma}} is a Type II endometrial tumor {{that makes}} up 5–10% of diagnosed endometrial cancer and is common in <b>postmenopausal</b> women with atrophied endometrium and black women. Serous endometrial carcinoma is aggressive and often invades the myometrium and metastasizes within the peritoneum (seen as omental caking) or the lymphatic system. Histologically, it appears with many atypical nuclei, papillary structures, and, in contrast to endometrioid adenocarcinomas, rounded cells instead of columnar cells. Roughly 30% of endometrial serous carcinomas also have psammoma bodies. Serous carcinomas spread differently than most other endometrial cancers; they can spread outside the uterus without invading the myometrium.|$|E
5|$|Transvaginal {{ultrasound}} {{to examine}} the endometrial thickness in women with <b>postmenopausal</b> bleeding is increasingly being used {{to aid in the}} diagnosis of endometrial cancer in the United States. In the United Kingdom, both an endometrial biopsy and a transvaginal ultrasound used in conjunction are the standard of care for diagnosing endometrial cancer. The homogeneity of the tissue visible on transvaginal ultrasound can help to indicate whether the thickness is cancerous. Ultrasound findings alone are not conclusive in cases of endometrial cancer, so another screening method (for example endometrial biopsy) must be used in conjunction. Other imaging studies are of limited use. CT scans are used for preoperative imaging of tumors that appear advanced on physical exam or have a high-risk subtype (at high risk of metastasis). They {{can also be used to}} investigate extrapelvic disease. An MRI can be of some use in determining if the cancer has spread to the cervix or if it is an endocervical adenocarcinoma. MRI is also useful for examining the nearby lymph nodes.|$|E
25|$|The estrogen-alone substudy of the WHI {{reported}} {{an increased risk}} of stroke and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in <b>postmenopausal</b> women 50 years of age or older and {{an increased risk of}} dementia in <b>postmenopausal</b> women 65 years of age or older using 0.625mg of Premarin conjugated equine estrogens (CEE). The estrogen-plus-progestin substudy of the WHI {{reported an}} increased risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, invasive breast cancer, pulmonary emboli and DVT in <b>postmenopausal</b> women 50 years of age or older and an increased risk of dementia in <b>postmenopausal</b> women 65 years of age or older using PremPro, which is 0.625mg of CEE with 2.5mg of the progestin medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA).|$|E
25|$|Clinical medical {{practice}} changed based upon two parallel WHI studies of <b>postmenopausal</b> HRT. Prior studies were smaller, {{and many were}} of women who electively took hormonal therapy. The WHI studies were the first large, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials of HRT in healthy, <b>postmenopausal</b> women.|$|E
25|$|Current {{research}} that has examined the impact of menopause on women’s self-reported sexual satisfaction indicates that 50.3% of women experience some sexual disturbance in one of five domains, and 33.7% experience disturbances {{in two of the}} domains. Of these were desire, orgasm, lubrication, and arousal disturbances. With regards to arousal, they found a significant negative association between age and arousal, in that as women aged {{they were more likely to}} report lower arousal scores. In the desire and orgasm domains, 38% of women reported a disturbances in their desire, and 17% reported a disturbance in their orgasm capabilities; of the 17%, 14% were premenopausal, 15.2% were <b>postmenopausal</b> and taking a form of HRT, and 22% were <b>postmenopausal</b> not on a form of HRT. Eight percent of women reported disturbances lubricating during sexual activity; 14.3% in the premenopausal group, 30% in the <b>postmenopausal</b> group not using a HRT, and 11.7% among those <b>postmenopausal</b> women using HRT. Lastly, 21% of women reported pain as a disturbance in their sexual satisfaction— the premenopausal group at 14.3%, the <b>postmenopausal</b> women using HRT at 13.3% and the group with the highest rates, similarly to the other results, was the <b>postmenopausal</b> women not taking HRT at 34%. This study concluded that there was a significant decline in sexual function related to menopause in the pain and lubrication domains.|$|E
25|$|Hypoestrogenism and {{melatonin}} supplementation increase cortisol {{levels in}} <b>postmenopausal</b> women.|$|E
25|$|In 1960, DES {{was found}} to be more {{effective}} than androgens in the treatment of advanced breast cancer in <b>postmenopausal</b> women. DES was the hormonal treatment of choice for advanced breast cancer in <b>postmenopausal</b> women until 1977, when the FDA approved tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator with efficacy similar to DES but fewer side effects.|$|E
25|$|The first {{carpometacarpal joint}} is a {{frequent}} site of osteoarthritis in <b>postmenopausal</b> women.|$|E
25|$|Aromatase inhibitors are {{typically}} given to <b>postmenopausal</b> women {{to lower the}} amount of bioavailable estrogen in their systems.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{medications}} like alendronate, etidronate, risedronate, raloxifene and strontium ranelate can {{be helpful}} for the preventing of osteoporotic fragility fractures in <b>postmenopausal</b> women with osteoporosis.|$|E
25|$|A major {{complaint}} among <b>postmenopausal</b> {{women is}} decreased libido, and many may seek medical consultation for this. Several hormonal changes take {{place during the}} menopausal period, including a decrease in estrogen levels {{and an increase in}} follicle-stimulating hormone. For most women, the majority of change occurs during the late perimenopausal and <b>postmenopausal</b> stages. Decrease in other hormones such as the sex hormone-binding globulim (SHBG) and inhibin (A and B) also take place in the <b>postmenopausal</b> period. Testosterone, a hormone more commonly associated with males, is also present in women. It peaks at age 30, but declines with age, so there is little variation across the lifetime and during the menopausal transition. However, in surgically induced menopause, instead of the levels of estrogens and testosterone slowly declining over time, they decline very sharply, resulting in more severe symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Fluoride supplementation {{does not}} appear to be {{effective}} in <b>postmenopausal</b> osteoporosis, as even though it increases bone density, it does not decrease the risk of fractures.|$|E
25|$|A study {{published}} in 2001 found higher levels of monounsaturated fatty acids MUFAs (especially oleic acid) in the erythrocyte membranes of <b>postmenopausal</b> women who developed breast cancer.|$|E
25|$|Treatment of {{osteoporosis}} in <b>postmenopausal</b> women. Although they have previously {{been approved for}} this indication, AAS saw very little use for this purpose due to their virilizing side effects.|$|E
25|$|This {{conclusion}} was partially contradicted by a latter study, which showed a direct relation between very high consumption of omega-6 fatty acids (PUFAs) {{and breast cancer}} in <b>postmenopausal</b> women.|$|E
25|$|Hormonal {{vaginitis}} includes atrophic vaginitis {{usually found}} in <b>postmenopausal</b> or postpartum women. Sometimes it {{can occur in}} young girls before puberty. In these situations the estrogen support of the vagina is poor.|$|E
25|$|Sexual desire {{has been}} related to three {{separate}} components: drive, beliefs and values, and motivation. Particularly in <b>postmenopausal</b> women, drive fades {{and is no longer}} the initial step in a woman's sexual response (if it ever was).|$|E
25|$|In low doses as a {{component}} of hormone replacement therapy for <b>postmenopausal</b> and transgender women, for instance to increase energy, well-being, libido, and quality of life, as well as to reduce hot flashes. Testosterone is usually used for this purpose, although methyltestosterone is also used.|$|E
25|$|Adding {{testosterone}} to {{hormone therapy}} {{has a positive}} effect on sexual function in <b>postmenopausal</b> women, although it may be accompanied by hair growth, acne and a reduction in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. These side effects diverge depending on the doses and methods of using testosterone.|$|E
25|$|At a {{high dosage}} of 1,600mg/day orally for 4weeks, {{treatment}} of <b>postmenopausal</b> women with prasterone {{has been found}} to increase serum levels of DHEA by 15-fold, testosterone by 9-fold, DHEA-S, androstenedione (A4), and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) all by 20-fold, and estrone and estradiol both by 2-fold.|$|E
25|$|Hormone {{replacement}} therapy consisting of systemic treatment with estrogen {{alone or in}} combination with a progestogen, has well-documented and considerable beneficial effects on the skin of <b>postmenopausal</b> women. These benefits include increased skin collagen content, skin thickness and elasticity, and skin hydration and surface lipids. Topical estrogen {{has been found to}} have similar beneficial effects on the skin. In addition, a study has found that topical 2% progesterone cream significantly increases skin elasticity and firmness and observably decreases wrinkles in peri- and <b>postmenopausal</b> women. Skin hydration and surface lipids, on the other hand, did not significantly change with topical progesterone. These findings suggest that progesterone, like estrogen, also has beneficial effects on the skin, and may be independently protective against skin aging.|$|E
25|$|Urine {{contains}} {{proteins and}} other substances that {{are useful for}} medical therapy and are ingredients in many prescription drugs (e.g., Ureacin, Urecholine, Urowave). Urine from <b>postmenopausal</b> women is rich in gonadotropins that can yield follicle stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone for fertility therapy. One such commercial product is Pergonal.|$|E
25|$|A 2011 review {{reported}} a small benefit of physical exercise on bone density of <b>postmenopausal</b> women. The chances {{of having a}} fracture were also slightly reduced (absolute difference 4%). People who exercised had on average less bone loss (0.85% at the spine, 1.03% at the hip).|$|E
25|$|Gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs cause {{temporary}} {{regression of}} fibroids by decreasing estrogen levels. Because {{of the limitations}} and side effects of this medication, it is rarely recommended other than for preoperative use to shrink {{the size of the}} fibroids and uterus before surgery. It is typically used for a maximum of 6 months or less because after longer use they could cause osteoporosis and other typically <b>postmenopausal</b> complications. The main side effects are transient <b>postmenopausal</b> symptoms. In many cases the fibroids will regrow after cessation of treatment, however, significant benefits may persist for much longer in some cases. Several variations are possible, such as GnRH agonists with add-back regimens intended to decrease the adverse effects of estrogen deficiency. Several add-back regimes are possible, tibolone, raloxifene, progestogens alone, estrogen alone, and combined estrogens and progestogens.|$|E
25|$|Weight-bearing {{endurance}} exercise and/or {{exercises to}} strengthen muscles improve bone strength {{in those with}} osteoporosis. Aerobics, weight bearing, and resistance exercises all maintain or increase BMD in <b>postmenopausal</b> women. Fall prevention can help prevent osteoporosis complications. There is some evidence for hip protectors specifically {{among those who are}} in care homes.|$|E
25|$|The most typical {{symptoms}} {{of ovarian cancer}} include bloating, abdominal or pelvic pain or discomfort, back pain, irregular menstruation or <b>postmenopausal</b> vaginal bleeding, pain or bleeding after or during sexual intercourse, loss of appetite, fatigue, diarrhea, indigestion, heartburn, constipation, nausea, feeling full, and possibly urinary symptoms (including frequent urination and urgent urination).|$|E
25|$|Studies in mice {{suggest that}} the pineal-derived {{melatonin}} regulates new bone deposition. Pineal-derived melatonin mediates its action on the bone cells through MT2 receptors. This pathway could be a potential new target for osteoporosis treatment as the study shows the curative effect of oral melatonin treatment in a <b>postmenopausal</b> osteoporosis mouse model.|$|E
25|$|The {{extent of}} the {{reduction}} in bone density in most studies is 10–20%. The clinical manifestations on bone differ depending on {{the age of the}} patient. <b>Postmenopausal</b> woman are most sensitive to accelerated bone loss from thyrotoxicosis. Accelerated bone growth in growing children can increase ossification in the short term, but generally results in short-stature adults compared with the predicted heights.|$|E
25|$|In 1978, the FDA removed {{postpartum}} lactation suppression {{to prevent}} breast engorgement from their approved indications for DES and other estrogens. In the 1990s, the only approved indications for DES were treatment of advanced prostate cancer {{and treatment of}} advanced breast cancer in <b>postmenopausal</b> women. The last remaining U.S. manufacturer of DES, Eli Lilly, stopped making and marketing it in 1997.|$|E
25|$|Non-government organisations in Europe {{have made}} their own recommendations. The German Society for Nutrition {{recommends}} 20µg. The European Menopause and Andropause Society recommends <b>postmenopausal</b> women consume15µg (600 IU) until age 70, and 20µg (800 IU) from age 71. This dose should be increased to 100µg (4,000 IU) in some patients with very low vitamin D status or in case of co-morbid conditions.|$|E
25|$|The {{labeling}} of estrogen-only {{products in the}} U.S. includes a boxed warning that unopposed estrogen (without progestogen) therapy {{increases the risk of}} endometrial cancer. Based on a review of data from the WHI, in 2003 the FDA changed the {{labeling of}} all estrogen and estrogen with progestin products for use by <b>postmenopausal</b> women to include a new boxed warning about cardiovascular and other risks.|$|E
25|$|Caffeine can {{increase}} {{blood pressure and}} cause vasoconstriction. Long-term consumption at sufficiently high doses {{has been associated with}} chronic arterial stiffness. Coffee and caffeine can affect gastrointestinal motility and gastric acid secretion. Caffeine in low doses may cause weak bronchodilation for up to four hours in asthmatics. Caffeine increases basal metabolic rate in adults. In <b>postmenopausal</b> women, high caffeine consumption can accelerate bone loss.|$|E
25|$|Adult granulosa cell {{tumors are}} {{characterized}} by later onset (30+ years, 50 on average). These tumors produce high levels of estrogen, which causes its characteristic symptoms: menometrorrhagia; endometrial hyperplasia; tender, enlarged breasts; <b>postmenopausal</b> bleeding; and secondary amenorrhea. The mass of the tumor can cause other symptoms, including abdominal pain and distension, or symptoms similar to an ectopic pregnancy if the tumor bleeds and ruptures.|$|E
25|$|Testosterone {{may prove}} to be an {{effective}} treatment in female sexual arousal disorders, and is available as a dermal patch. There is no FDA approved androgen preparation for the treatment of androgen insufficiency; however, it has been used off-label to treat low libido and sexual dysfunction in older women. Testosterone may be a treatment for <b>postmenopausal</b> women {{as long as they are}} effectively estrogenized.|$|E
