5|$|Articles 41 and 68 of the {{constitution}} empower the sovereign to withhold royal assent from bills adopted by the Legislative Assembly.

Nonetheless, this does not preclude an independent royal decision to exercise a right of veto. In November 2011, the assembly adopted an Arms and Ammunitions (Amendment) Bill, which reduced the possible criminal sentences for the illicit <b>possession</b> <b>of</b> <b>firearms.</b> The bill was adopted by ten votes to eight. Two members of the assembly had recently been charged with the illicit <b>possession</b> <b>of</b> <b>firearms.</b> The Prime Minister, Lord Tuʻivakanō, voted in favour of the amendment. Members of the opposition denounced the bill and asked the King to veto it, which he did in December.|$|E
