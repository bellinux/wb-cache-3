5|$|Brooks & Dunn is an American {{country music}} duo {{consisting}} of Kix Brooks and Ronnie Dunn, both vocalists and songwriters. The duo {{was founded in}} 1990 through the suggestion of Tim DuBois. Before the foundation, both members were solo recording artists. Brooks wrote number one singles for John Conlee, Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, and Highway 101; both he and Dunn also charted two solo singles a <b>piece</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1980s, with Brooks also releasing an album for Capitol Records in 1989. However, they began hitting the charts together in 1991.|$|E
5|$|Congress {{began the}} task of {{restoring}} federal coins to circulation in 1864 with a two-cent piece in bronze, and by authorizing a three-cent piece in copper-nickel the following year. In 1866, it authorized a five-cent <b>piece</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> latter alloy, the nickel, as {{it has come to}} be known. With the three-cent silver effectively replaced by base-metal pieces, it did not share in the increased mintage of silver coins that began in 1868. The three-cent silver was struck at the rate of a few thousand per year into the 1870s.|$|E
50|$|Because {{the board}} is triangular, the two armies are set up asymmetrically. One player sets their pieces near a base of the {{triangle}} on light-colored cells in three rows: 7 <b>pieces</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> front row, 6 <b>pieces</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle row, 5 <b>pieces</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> third row; the back row is left empty. The other player sets their pieces {{at the opposite end}} of the triangle on dark-colored cells in four rows: 6 <b>pieces</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> front row, 5 <b>pieces</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second row, 4 <b>pieces</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> third row, 3 <b>pieces</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fourth row; the two back rows are left empty. Each player's two captains are placed in their front row, one cell inward from the left and right sides. An empty row separates the armies.|$|R

5|$|Fauré did {{not intend}} the eighth nocturne to appear under that designation.

5|$|In the {{newspaper}} articles, Cope attacked Marsh for plagiarism and financial mismanagement, and attacked Powell for his geological classification errors and misspending of government-allocated funds. Marsh and Powell were each able to publish their own {{side of the}} story, filing their own charges against Cope. Ballou's articles were poorly researched, written, and read, and Cope himself was smarting from a <b>piece</b> <b>in</b> <b>The</b> Philadelphia Inquirer which suggested the University of Pennsylvania trustees would ask Cope to step down unless he provided proof for his charges against Marsh and Powell. Marsh himself kept the Herald story alive with a fiery rebuttal, {{but by the end}} of January the story had faded from all {{the newspaper}}s, and little changed between the bitter rivals.|$|E

5|$|Ketèlbey {{wrote an}} intermezzo—A Birthday Greeting—in 1932, {{on the sixth}} {{birthday}} of Princess Elizabeth (later Queen Elizabeth II). His connection to royalty continued in 1934, when his march A State Procession was played to accompany the arrival of King George V at a Royal Command Performance; the king requested that the march should be played again during the interval, and he and the queen stayed in the royal box {{to listen to the}} <b>piece.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> following year Ketèlbey wrote the march With Honour Crowned for the King's silver jubilee; the work was played for the royal family at Windsor Castle before Ketèlbey conducted its first public performance at Kingsway Hall. The work was played at that year's Trooping the Colour and at the Jubilee Thanksgiving Service at St Paul's Cathedral.|$|E
5|$|The {{chessboard}} {{on the top}} of {{the cabinet}} was thin enough to allow for a magnetic linkage. Each <b>piece</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> chess set had a small, strong magnet attached to its base, and when they were placed on the board the pieces would attract a magnet attached to a string under their specific places on the board. This allowed the director inside the machine to see which pieces moved where on the chess board. The bottom of the chessboard had corresponding numbers, 1–64, allowing the director to see which places on the board were affected by a player's move. The internal magnets were positioned in a way that outside magnetic forces did not influence them, and Kempelen would often allow a large magnet to sit at the side of the board in an attempt to show that the machine was not influenced by magnetism.|$|E
5|$|The exact date of {{construction}} is not known, but {{is believed to have}} started in the 15th century and was definitely before 1574, when the initials of the owner George Perceval, the father of Richard Percivale, were added to the chimney <b>piece</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> library. One of his descendants Richard Percivale (or Perceval) contributed to the English response to the plans for invasion by the Spanish Armada by deciphering Spanish documents for Queen Elizabeth. Perceval sold the estate to the Bristol merchant and member of parliament Richard Cole in 1582 and it was passed down to his descendants.|$|E

5|$|The next Gilbert and Sullivan opera, Patience, {{opened at}} the Opera Comique in April 1881 and was another big success, usurping Pinafore's {{position}} as the longest running <b>piece</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> series with the second-longest run in musical theatre history. Patience satirised the self-indulgent aesthetic movement of the 1870s and '80s in England. To popularise the opera in America, in 1882 Carte sent one of the artistes under his management, the young poet Oscar Wilde, on a lecture tour to explain to Americans what the aesthetic movement was about. Carte told an interviewer {{at that time that}} he had fifteen theatrical companies and performers touring simultaneously in Europe, America and Australia.|$|E
5|$|The porch {{leads into}} the great hall which has a Minton tile floor and a large stone chimney <b>piece.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> east wing is the long gallery which has oak panelling, a chimney-piece and a {{panelled}} ceiling. Behind the long gallery is an irregularly-shaped billiard room and the drawing room. To the south {{of these is the}} library. Behind the great hall is the main staircase. The circular tower at the north-west corner contains the octagonal dining room with a Minton tile floor, two fireplaces, and a vault of eight radial ribs running to a central boss. The room contains an oak sideboard with a carved Green Man. Below the dining room is a wine cellar. On the fifth floor of the circular tower is a room designed for playing rackets, which is approached by a stone spiral staircase.|$|E
5|$|After the {{surprise}} gains of the flamboyant Jelinčič {{in the first}} round, the campaigns of both candidates opted for more concrete political statements in public campaigning and debates. Peterle replaced {{the head of his}} campaign, and concentrated on questioning Türk's role in the 1991 secession from Yugoslavia. Peterle alleged that at the time when he, as Prime Minister, struggled for Slovenia's independence, Türk continued to act as an official representative of Yugoslavia in international institutions. The campaign was backed by the Prime Minister Janša and the Foreign Minister Dimitrij Rupel who {{went so far as to}} confirm Peterle's claims on the Foreign Ministry's official website. Türk denied the allegations, pointing to his opinion <b>piece</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> International Herald Tribune advocating international recognition of Slovenia, and the fact that it was Rupel himself who in 1992 appointed Türk as the Ambassador to the UN and praised him for his service to the country. Peterle's new strategy appeared to backfire, and the polls before the runoff predicted that Türk would win between 63% and over 70% of the vote.|$|E

5|$|In July 1972 Peter Cormack signed from Nottingham Forest equaling {{the record}} £110,000 fee Liverpool paid for John Toshack. Shankly {{described}} Cormack's signature as, 'The final <b>piece</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> jigsaw' of that team. In the 1972–73 season they duly won the League and the club's first European trophy, the UEFA Cup. Cormack and Keegan scored in a 2-0 Easter Monday showdown with title rivals, Don Revie's Leeds United. Fellow title contenders Arsenal only drew at Southampton the same day. Liverpool needing a final game draw {{for the title}} drew 0-0 at home versus Leicester City. Their eighth League title equalled the record held by Arsenal and was their first captained by a non-Scot, Tommy Smith. A 1973 UEFA Cup Final downpour meant the home first leg was abandoned after 27 minutes. Shankly in those 27 minutes felt the Borussia Mönchengladbach defence was suspect in the air. Shankly started tall forward, John Toshack, in the re-arranged game demoting the small build of Brian Hall to a substitute appearance in a 3-0 win. Toshack headed assists for two Keegan strikes with Lloyd also heading a goal. A 2–0 second leg, away loss meant Liverpool won 3–2 on aggregate. They were the first English team to win the League and a UEFA competiton in the same season.|$|E
5|$|The Aboriginal group {{forms the}} inner centre <b>piece</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tondo of both bowls. As {{the same image}} was used for both bowls, the {{implication}} is that the Chinese ceramic painters were copying from the same drawing and finishing them at the same place and time. The image is of a group of four Aboriginal men with club, shield and spears, one woman with a baby on her shoulders – standing and turned slightly away {{from the rest of the}} figures – and another woman cowed by the men. This is thought to depict a preliminary marriage ceremony. As with the Museum bowl's Sydney Cove image, no directly related, surviving, version is known that would have been used by the ceramic artists to paint the Aboriginal group. The closest match is a drawing after an apparently now-lost original sketch by Nicolas-Martin Petit, artist on the 1800–1803 French expedition to Australia led by Nicolas Baudin. Research made around 2009–2012, indicated that during Baudin's expedition, a report was prepared for Emperor Napoleon on the feasibility of capturing the British colony at Sydney Cove. As this expedition progressed around coastal Australia, Petit began to specialise in the drawing of portraits of indigenous peoples. The French expedition arrived at Port Jackson on 25April 1802. Petit's drawing was copied for publication as plate 114 in the Voyage autour du monde : entrepris par ordre du roi (Paris, 1825) , regarding a voyage around the world (1817–1820) led by Louis-Claude de Saulces de Freycinet. The engraving is entitled Port Jackson, Nlle Hollande. Ceremonie preliminaire d'un mariage, chez les sauvages (ceremony before a marriage among the natives, Port Jackson, New Holland). Port Jackson aborigines are from the Eora group of indigenous people living in the Sydney Basin.|$|E
