50|$|One of the {{advantages}} of stereolithography is its speed; functional parts can be manufactured within a day. The length of time it takes to produce a single part depends upon the complexity of the design and the size. <b>Printing</b> <b>time</b> can last anywhere from hours to more than a day. Many 3D printers can produce parts with a maximum size of approximately 50×50×60 cm (20×20×24 in) and some printers are capable of producing single parts more than 2 meters in length. 3D printed prototypes and designs are strong enough to be machined and {{can also be used to}} make master patterns for injection molding, thermoforming, blow molding, and various metal casting processes.|$|E
5000|$|Dobson did {{not approve}} of {{door-to-door}} sales, which had been used by his contemporary Parson Weems to sell William Guthrie's New System of Modern Geography and Oliver Goldsmith's History {{of the earth and}} Animated Nature. The door-to-door approach also seemed impractical, given the Encyclopædia's price and the long <b>printing</b> <b>time</b> of nine years. Instead, Dobson conducted an all-out advertising blitz, unlike any before seen in North America, to secure subscriptions; his advertisements appeared in newspapers, on magazine wrappers, in spare book leaves, and in pamphlets distributed to all the major book-sellers of his day. Dobson also appealed strongly to the patriotic pride of the newly independent Americans; he used only American materials and craftspeople and his announcement of the first [...] "American" [...] encyclopedia was timed to match George Washington's selection as the first President under the new Constitution. His first advertisements appeared on 31 March 1789 in three newspapers: the Pennsylvania Mercury, the Pennsylvania Packet, and the Federal Gazette.|$|E
40|$|In this work, the replication-based {{microcontact}} printing method {{has been presented}} to study the deformation effect of different printing times and printing pressures on the microcontact printed structures. Cost-effective {{microcontact printing}} channels of self-assembled monolayers of alkanethiol have been prepared on gold surface. The alkanethiol inking the polydimethylsiloxanes stamp effectively forms the self-assembled monolayers on the noble gold surface that protects the metal against etchant solution and thereby forms channel-like structures. To address the deformation issue, variations in the <b>printing</b> <b>time</b> {{in the range of}} 30  s– 60  min and the printing pressure ranging from 840 to 4200  Pa have been studied.

40|$|Layered {{manufacturing}} inherently {{suffers from}} staircase defects along surfaces that are gently slopped {{with respect to}} the build direction. Reducing the slice thickness improves the situation but never resolves it completely as flat layers remain a poor approximation of the true surface in these regions. In addition, reducing the slice thickness largely increases the <b>print</b> <b>time.</b> In this work we focus on a simple yet effective technique to improve the print accuracy for layered manufacturing by filament deposition. Our method works with standard three-axis 3 D filament printers (e. g. the typical, widely available 3 D printers), using standard extrusion nozzles. It better reproduces the geometry of sloped surfaces without increasing the <b>print</b> <b>time.</b> Our key idea is to perform a local anti-aliasing, working at a sub-layer accuracy to produce slightly curved deposition paths and reduce approximation errors. This is inspired by Computer Graphics anti-aliasing techniques which consider sub-pixel precision to treat aliasing effects. We show that the necessary deviation in height compared to standard slicing is bounded by half the layer thickness. Therefore, the height changes remain small and plastic deposition remains reliable. We further split and order paths to minimize defects due to the extruder nozzle shape, avoiding any change to the existing hardware. We apply and analyze our approach on 3 D printed examples, showing that our technique greatly improves surface accuracy and silhouette quality while keeping the <b>print</b> <b>time</b> nearly identical.

40|$|We propose an {{optimization}} {{framework for}} 3 D printing {{that seeks to}} save <b>printing</b> <b>time</b> and the support material required to print 3 D shapes. Three-dimensional printing technology is rapidly maturing and may revolutionize how we manufacture objects. The total cost of printing, however, is governed by numerous factors which include not only {{the price of the}} printer but also the amount of material and time to fabricate the shape. Our PackMerger framework converts the input 3 D watertight mesh into a shell by hollowing its inner parts. The shell is then divided into segments. The location of splits is controlled based on several parameters, including the size of the connection areas or volume of each segment. The pieces are then tightly packed using optimization. The optimization attempts to minimize the amount of support material and the bounding box volume of the packed segments while keeping the number of segments minimal. The final packed configuration can be printed with substantial time and material savings, while also allowing printing of objects that would not fit into the printer volume. We have tested our system on three different printers and it shows a reduction of 5 – 30 % of the <b>printing</b> <b>time</b> while simultaneously saving 15 – 65 % of the support material. The optimization time was approximately 1 min. Once the segments are printed, they need to be assembled...|$|E
