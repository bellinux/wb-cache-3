On experimental farm ‘De Marke’, a coherent set of simple measures at farm level has been implemented, which {{has resulted in a}} drastic reduction in input of nutrients without affecting production intensity (milk production; kg milk per ha). To promote adoption of these measures in commercial dairy farming, the project ‘Cows & Opportunities’ was initiated in which 16 commercial <b>pilot</b> <b>farms</b> participated. Data were collected over a 6 -year period (1998 – 2003). This paper describes and analyses the different farm management strategies adopted on these farms, using two classifications of the farms {{at the start of the}} project (the base situation), one based on nitrogen (N) surplus (kgha− 1), the other on production intensity. In both classifications, the farms were split in two equal groups. Changes over time in farm characteristics (farm development) were described through linear regression for each group and the variance among farms within a group was used to test for differences between groups. Under the influence of economic driving forces, the <b>pilot</b> <b>farms,</b> on average, expanded land area and increased their milk quota. However, the most intensive farms could comply with regulations only by reducing production intensity. From 1998 to 2002, average nutrient surpluses on the <b>pilot</b> <b>farms</b> decreased by 33 % for N and 53 % for phosphorus (P). Important measures were reducing the use of inorganic fertilizer, optimizing the use of home-produced organic manure, reducing grazing time, reducing the number of replacement stock and lowering crude protein content in the ration. Over the years, variation in N surpluses among farms (inter-farm variation) remained almost constant. Differences in farm management strategy could not unequivocally be related to farm typology (high/low N surplus; high/low production intensity). It was concluded that decisions by individual farmers on farm development are not always based on ‘rational’ arguments, but are co-determined by ‘emotional’ perceptions...|$|R

Before {{entering}} this industry, most farmers spend time observing {{the operation of}} <b>pilot</b> <b>farms.</b> This stage is important to master essential techniques and judge the profitability and risk associated with shrimp farming. Learning is a complex process that leads to misconceptions {{about the nature of}} short-term and long-term risks. This paper uses computer simulation to illuminate the dynamic nature of the learning processes, land conversion, shrimp production and environmental contamination. The model is based on conditions of the Dai Hoa Loc Commune in the Mekong Delta of Vietnam. Initial simulations match statistical data by revealing the high risk: high initial profits from the <b>pilot</b> <b>farms</b> followed by conversion from rice land to shrimp farms. When rapid conversion occurs, the region is vulnerable to excessive accumulation of nutrients, a decline in shrimp yields and financial failure. In contrast, low stock densities deliver a lower profit which is insufficient to stimulate mass land conversion. The paper concludes with testing recovery strategies for farmers who have suffered the longer term impacts of high stocking density. Results show that yield recovery is possible by improving the channel and imposing regulatory control over stocking density. intensive shrimp farming; stock density; learning process; recovery strategy; Mekong Delta...|$|R

Pedological investigations under the above title were carried out within the theme „Investigations of complex agrotechnical practices on heavy soils in the Upper Save Valley - the Ježevo locality“. Their purpose was to determine: a) the basic parameters and changes in the consistence, depending on the moisture dynamics in the soil, b) potential and actual changes in volume, total porosity and air content in the soil, and c) their significance for the agriotechnical practice and, generally, for the exploitation of hydroarneliorated soils of the Farm. The investigations were carried out on the production plots 8, 19 and 17 with pipe drainage of various intensity (spaces 15, 20 and 25 m, depths 1. 1 and 1. 25 m). According to the marked oder of production plots, they are former: noncalcareous, vertic, humous, amphigley soils, mineral variety of amphigley soils, also noncalcareous and vertic, and - browned meadow soils. Standard methods (JDPZ, 1971) were used in the field and laboratory experiments, as well as more recent experiences of foreign authors (See Literature), The results are presented in Tables 1 - 5 and Graph 1. The lay-out of the Farm is shown in Figure 1. The following conclusions were drawn: 1. Heavy vertic soils of the <b>Pilot</b> <b>Farm</b> Ježevo have very unfavourable mechanical properties. In addition to other characteristics of plasticity, this is also confirmed by the unfavourable relation between the lower plasticity limit and the field water capacity (0. 8 - 0. 9).

In the described conditions to soil consistence, mechanical tillage is practically unfeasible. This is also the main reason for the delayed seedbed preparation and sowing of maize in spring on most arable areas of ahe Farm. 3. Other physical properties of these soils are also unfavourable due to greater changes in the volume, depending on the moisture dynamics in the soil.

40|$|Although Mexico aims to be {{self-sufficient}} in milk, domestic prices for milk are low due to trade liberalization, {{which resulted in}} imports of large amounts of milk powder, mainly from the United States. This situation threatens the livelihoods of smallholder dairy farmers. With varying success, farmers have tried to increase revenues by intensifying production through increased purchase of concentrates and production per cow, but this also resulted in substantial environmental problems. In this paper we combine a whole-farm model with data from representative <b>pilot</b> <b>farms</b> to explore alternative intensification options that more adequately can support the multi-objective setting of smallholders. <b>Pilot</b> dairy <b>farms</b> were defined in two categories: family-based (FB) and semi-specialized (SS), each at three levels of intensification: extensive (E, - 1), medium-intensive (M, > 0. 8 and - 1), and intensive (I, > 1. 2 LU ha - 1). We aimed to explore management alternatives that enhance farm economic performance, while improving resource use efficiency and reducing negative environmental impacts. For {{each of the six}} <b>pilot</b> <b>farms</b> a large set of Pareto-optimal farm configurations was generated using the whole farm model in combination with an evolutionary algorithm. Applying a multivariate analysis, the sets of alternatives were classified in three functional groups that respectively aimed to: a) maximize profitability ('economic'), b) maximize organic matter (OM) balance ('environmental'), and c) minimize labor used, N balance and feeding costs ('integrated'). Intensive (FBI, SSI) and large (SSM) farms had the widest ranges of opportunities for change, mainly to maximize profitability and/or OM balance, and to minimize N balance. Synergies were found between maximizing profitability and minimizing feed costs, and for minimizing both feed costs and N balance; trade-offs occurred for OM balance with feed costs and N balance. When comparing the current farm performance with the sets of alternatives, farms performed already well in terms of N and labor balances, whereas the largest scope for improvement was found for increasing OM balances. The results showed that just re-allocating the current resources might by itself lead to economic, social and/or environmental improvements for smallholder dairy farms. </p...|$|R
40|$|To be sustainable, {{livestock}} production systems {{not only have}} to meet environmental objectives, as described in EU directives, but they also have to provide adequate income to the farmer. A dairy farming system is complex with regard to nutrient flows. Results of an experimental <b>farm</b> and <b>pilot</b> <b>farms</b> show that even on farms with a high milk production per hectare, and related high applications of manure, nutrient flows can be managed in a way that environmental quality can be guaranteed. Improved nutrient management should be based on farm-specific conditions. It is the most cost effective way to reduce nutrient losses, but only if farmers are skilful. The Dutch government stimulates such farm specific nutrient management by adjusting legislation and educatio...|$|R
