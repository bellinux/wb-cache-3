The battalion was deployed to Egypt in 1936 and returned in December 1937.

5|$|Following the {{theatrical}} release of Miracle at St. Anna, Spike Lee and the Italian production company On My Own Produzioni Cinematografiche brought {{a lawsuit against}} TF1, alleging that the company failed in its contractual agreement with On My Own to distribute the film in international markets, excluding the United States, Canada and Italy. In its defense, TF1 refused to distribute Miracle at St. Anna, claiming that Lee had made a different film than the one promised, and refused to <b>pay</b> <b>On</b> My Own the €11 million advance needed to distribute the film internationally.|$|E
5|$|Conley was cross-examined by {{the defense}} for 16 hours over three days, but the defense failed to break his story. The defense then moved to have Conley's entire {{testimony}} concerning the alleged rendezvous stricken from the record. Judge Roan noted that an early objection might have been upheld, but since the jury could not forget what it had heard, he allowed the evidence to stand. The prosecution, to support Frank's alleged expectation of a visit from Phagan, produced Helen Ferguson, a factory worker who first informed Phagan's parents of her death. Ferguson testified that {{she had tried to}} get Phagan's <b>pay</b> <b>on</b> Friday from Frank, but was told that Phagan would have to come in person. Both the person behind the pay window and the woman behind Ferguson in the pay line disputed this version of events, testifying that in accordance with his normal practice, Frank did not disburse pay that day.|$|E

5|$|In May 1952 he {{resigned}} from the RAF for the second time. Braham decided he {{could not afford to}} pay for his three sons' private education on a wing commander's salary in Britain. He joined the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) with the rank of wing commander and on much better <b>pay.</b> <b>On</b> 6 June 1952 the Brahams sailed to Canada. Braham was immediately appointed staff officer for operations and training at Air Defence near Montreal. He taught aircrew how to fly, carry out interceptions and fight in all types of weather. He flew the fast Avro Canada CF-100 Canuck on 39 occasions and North American F-86 Sabre as well as the Lockheed T-33. Altogether he flew 193 times with the RCAF. His next appointment was 200 miles north of Toronto at the All-Weather Fighter Operational Training Unit.|$|E
5|$|Solidarity lending is a {{cornerstone}} of microcredit, and the system is now used in more than 43 countries. Although each borrower must belong to a five-member group, the group {{is not required to}} give any guarantee for a loan to its members. Repayment responsibility rests solely on the individual borrower. The group and the centre oversee that everyone behaves responsibly and none gets into a repayment problem. No formal joint liability exists, i.e. group members are not obliged to <b>pay</b> <b>on</b> behalf of a defaulting member. But, in practice the group members often contribute the defaulted amount with an intention to collect the money from the defaulted member at a later time. Such behaviour is encouraged because Grameen does not extend further credit to a group in which a member defaults.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} African nations {{did not show}} up in time, for various reasons such as {{difficulties}} flying through Istanbul, and finalisation of monetary arrangements (teams must pay first, and then get reimbursed later). Former Kenyan Olympic participant and owner of the website Kenya Chess Masala said that the issue just paints Africa in bad image. On 5 September, the organisers confirmed at a press-conference that the host-nation was ready to pay for the poorer nations to travel. Bhari confirmed that the travel expenses were the main problem and wrote that 116 out of the planned 187 federations were on a travel subsidy, including his native Kenya whose players had not shown in the first rounds, though. He also explained that one of the biggest issues was the timing of the funding and that the teams were expected to <b>pay</b> <b>on</b> their own and be reimbursed upon arrival. Finally, Bhari had already reminded other federations to start planning their travel expenses for the 43rd Chess Olympiad in Batumi in 2018. In the end, 10 African nations did not arrive (Kenya, Cameroon, Mali, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Burundi, Liberia, Seychelles, Senegal, Central African Republic).|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. This thesis examines the effects special <b>pays</b> have <b>on</b> retention in the Medical Service Corps (MSC). The research utilized special pay guidance and {{data from the}} Bureau of Medicine Information System (BUMIS) on officers who entered the MSC between 1997 and 2006. Four basic and refined probit models using demographics and specialties were constructed {{to determine the effects}} of special <b>pays</b> <b>on</b> retention.

The basic model estimated the effect of special <b>pays</b> <b>on</b> all specialties that receive a special pay. The refined models estimated the effects of special <b>pays</b> <b>on</b> retention for individual specialties, specifically psychologists, pharmacists, and optometrists. Findings showed that when special pays are implemented, specialties that receive them have a decreased probability of leaving the service. Individually, pharmacists and psychologists had a decreased probability of leaving when their respective special pays were implemented. Optometrists had an increased probability of leaving when their special pay was implemented, a result that requires further research...|$|R
