25|$|Here then De Morgan {{had made}} a great advance by {{introducing}} quantification of the terms. At that time Sir William Hamilton was teaching in Edinburgh a doctrine of the quantification of the predicate, and a correspondence sprang up. However, De Morgan soon perceived that Hamilton's quantification was of a different character; that it meant for example, substituting the two forms The whole of A is the whole of B, and The whole of A {{is a part of}} B for the Aristotelian form All A's are B's. Hamilton thought that he had placed the keystone in the Aristotelian arch, as he <b>phrased</b> <b>it.</b> Although {{it must have been a}} curious arch which could stand 2000 years without a keystone. As a consequence he had no room for De Morgan's innovations. He accused De Morgan of plagiarism, and the controversy raged for years in the columns of the Athenæum, and in the publications of the two writers.|$|E

500|$|Connotations was {{received}} negatively upon its premiere for its harmonic assertiveness and compositional style. The overall impression {{at the time}} was that, as critic Alex Ross later <b>phrased</b> <b>it,</b> [...] "Copland was no longer in an ingratiating mood." [...] The composer was accused by some critics of betraying his role as a tonal, populist composer to curry favor with younger composers and give the impression that his music still held contemporary relevance. Copland denied this accusation; he asserted that he had written Connotations as a twelve-tone work to give himself compositional options not available had he written it as a tonal one.|$|E

500|$|In 138 BC, Minyue {{invaded the}} Eastern Ou, {{prompting}} Eastern Ou to request {{the intervention of}} Han forces. The Han court was divided over offering military support. The campaign was opposed by the Han commander-in-chief Tian Fen, who argued that warfare between the Yue tribes occurred frequently and the affairs of Yue were not {{the responsibility of the}} Han government. The concept of Chinese centrality among nations persuaded the court to dispatch an army. In accordance with Chinese political philosophy, the ruler or Son of Heaven held a mandate that obligated the emperor to help smaller countries in need.

VanDerWerff singled out Rory's reading from the bible, which was, as Canning <b>phrased</b> <b>it,</b> [...] "ripped from A Charlie Brown Christmas" [...] when Linus reads the same passage, as one that [...] "irks" [...] him most, [...] "because it takes a perfectly beautiful little moment from a nearly perfect TV special" [...] and makes it a [...] "cutaway gag".|$|E
500|$|The Liberals did {{not return}} to office until 1892. Lord Rosebery was {{eventually}} persuaded to enter government, becoming once again Foreign Secretary serving under Gladstone as Prime Minister. In 1894 on Gladstone's retirement he achieved his wife's ambitions and became Prime Minister, but by then Lady Rosebery was dead. Without her, Rosebery was a shadow of his former self, taking huge doses of morphine to combat insomnia and nerves. His Prime Ministership lasted barely a year, marred by problems and difficulties. For the remainder of his life and without his wife, as Queen Victoria <b>phrased</b> <b>it,</b> [...] "to hold him back", he became more and more eccentric and controversial in his decisions. His final years were blighted by ill health and a self-enforced seclusion in Scotland. He died in 1929.|$|E

500|$|During the 1570s Leicester built {{a special}} {{relationship}} with Prince William of Orange, who held him in high esteem. The Earl became generally popular in the Netherlands. Since 1577 he pressed for an English military expedition, led by himself (as the Dutch strongly wished) to succour the rebels. In 1584 the Prince of Orange was murdered, political chaos ensued, and in August 1585 Antwerp fell to the Duke of Parma. An English intervention became inevitable; {{it was decided that}} Leicester would go to the Netherlands and [...] "be their chief as heretofore was treated of", as he <b>phrased</b> <b>it</b> in August 1585. He was alluding to the recently signed Treaty of Nonsuch in which his position and authority as [...] "governor-general" [...] of the Netherlands had only been vaguely defined. The Earl prepared himself for [...] "God's cause and her Majesty's" [...] by recruiting the expedition's cavalry from his retainers and friends, and by mortgaging his estate to the sum of £25,000.|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} the Rights of Woman Wollstonecraft {{promised her}} readers a second part to the work. Rather than giving them another {{philosophical}} treatise, however, she offered them a novel tinged with autobiography, appropriately titled The Wrongs of Woman. In her [...] "Preface", she writes that the novel should be considered the story of [...] "woman" [...] and not the story of an [...] "individual". Wollstonecraft attempts to detail, as the scholar Anne K. Mellor has <b>phrased</b> <b>it,</b> [...] "the wrongs done to women and the wrongs done by women" [...] (emphasis Mellor's). The wrongs done to women include stifling and sexually repressed marriages, which Wollstonecraft describes using the language of slavery, while the wrongs done by women include a false sense of self-worth generated through the language of sensibility. Unlike Wollstonecraft's first novel, [...] (1788), The Wrongs of Woman offers solutions to these problems, namely an empowering female sexuality, a purpose-filled maternal role, and the possibility of a feminism that crosses class boundaries.|$|E
500|$|News of {{the pending}} {{marriage}} became public in late November 1582, {{but it was}} still unclear what Gebhard would do. Precedent suggested he would resign prior to his marriage, but rumors abounded that he would convert the Electorate to Protestantism, perhaps forcibly. Throughout the Electorate, and on its borders, his supporters and opponents gathered their troops, armed their garrisons, stockpiled food, and prepared for war. On 19December 1582, Gebhard announced his conversion, from, as he <b>phrased</b> <b>it,</b> the [...] "darkness of the papacy to the Light" [...] of the Word of God. His proclamation of the Reformation from the Cathedral pulpit in the Imperial City of Cologne established Calvinism as a religious option in the Electorate. He also intended to convert the electorate into a dynastic property generated an uproar among the other Prince-electors. The transformation of an important ecclesiastical territory into a secular, dynastic duchy would then bring the principle of cuius regio, eius religio into play in the Electorate. Under this principle, all of Gebhard's subjects would be required to convert to his faith: his rule, his religion.|$|E

500|$|The mere {{possibility}} of Gebhard's conversion caused consternation in the Electorate, in the Empire, {{and in such}} European states as England and France. Gebhard considered his options, and listened to his advisers, chief among them his brother Karl, Truchsess von Waldburg (1548–1593), and Adolf, Count von Neuenahr (1545–1589). His opponents in the Cathedral Chapter enlisted external support from the Wittelsbachs in Bavaria and from the Pope. Diplomats shuttled from court to court through the Rhineland, bearing pleas to Gebhard to consider {{the outcome of a}} conversion, and how it would destroy the Electorate. These diplomats assured him of support for his cause should he convert and hold the Electorate and threats to destroy him if he did convert. The magistrates of Cologne vehemently opposed any possible conversion and the extension of parity to Protestants in the archdiocese. His Protestant supporters told Gebhard that he could marry the woman and keep the Electorate, converting it into a dynastic duchy. Throughout the Electorate, and on its borders, his supporters and opponents gathered their troops, armed their garrisons, stockpiled foodstuffs, and prepared for war. On 19December 1582, Gebhard announced his conversion, from, as he <b>phrased</b> <b>it,</b> the [...] "darkness of the papacy to the Light" [...] of the Word of God.|$|E

[...] To another who blurred the rhythm in Liszt's Gnomenreigen (usually done by playing the piece too fast in the composer's presence): [...] "There you go, mixing salad again."

Although the Treaty was endorsed by the majority of TDs of the Second Dáil, republican legitimatists argue that the vote was invalid as all TDs had, prior to their election, taken a solemn oath to defend the Irish Republic, and that people could not possibly express their true desires on the treaty, as the British had threatened a massive escalation, [...] "immediate and terrible war" [...] as they <b>phrased</b> <b>it,</b> if it was not accepted.|$|E
