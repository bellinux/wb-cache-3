40|$|Abstract: Clear tidal forcing of {{earthquakes}} {{has recently}} observed by several {{local and global}} studies. Using tidal amplitudes in addition to tidal phase the stress level required for tidal forcing is determined. Cochran et al. (2004) find that natural faults are highly responsive to relatively small stress changes and faults behave more weakly than would be expected from laboratory rate and state friction and stress corrosion measurements. Stress changes {{on the order of}} a tenth of a bar can cause modulation of the timing of earthquakes, similar to that measured for aftershock sequences. In addition, recent geodetic and seismologic studies suggest that faults are not simple <b>planes</b> <b>of</b> <b>slip,</b> but zones <b>of</b> highly damaged, sheared rock. These damage zones are highly compliant and may result in higher stress concentration in the fault than in the surrounding intact rock. Thus, fault zone compliance may reduce the stress loads required for rupture. 1...|$|R

30|$|According to M’Pandou and Siffert [40], {{the main}} reason for the zeta {{potential}} lowering in the anionic polymer presence is the occurrence of charged groups (negative carboxyl ones) of the polymer macromolecules in the area <b>of</b> <b>slipping</b> <b>plane.</b> The shift <b>of</b> <b>slipping</b> <b>plane</b> due to the presence of polymeric adsorption layer is the second reason for the zeta potential decrease. This effect is dominant under the conditions in which polymer macromolecules assume more extended conformations on the solid surface (i.e., at higher PAA concentrations). The third phenomenon is associated with the blockade of active sites on the solid surface by the adsorbed macromolecules. Such behavior is caused by flat conformation of polymeric chains on the activated carbon surface. Thus, the experimentally obtained value of electrokinetic potential of solid particles covered with polymer depends on the contributions of these effects.|$|R

40|$|The crystallographic micromechanical model (CMM) for {{prediction}} of yield stress of semicrystalline polymers, {{based on the}} thermally activated nucleation of screw dislocations at the boundary of lamellar crystals, is employed to interpret the yield behavior by effect of uniaxial drawing of some isotactic copolymers of propylene with different comonomeric units such as ethylene, 1 -butene, 1 -pentene, 1 -hexene, and 1 -octadecene (iPPEt, iPPBu, iPPPe, iPPHe and iPPOc, respectively). The samples are characterized by a random distribution of the comonomeric units. The CMM predicts that the values of stress at yield depend on {{the thickness of the}} lamellar crystals and relies on two parameters, i. e. the critical value of the free energy needed for nucleation and activation of a screw dislocation in crystallographic planes parallel to the chain axes, and the shear modulus relative to the <b>planes</b> <b>of</b> <b>slip</b> for the dislocations, whereas the role of the interlamellar amorphous phase is neglected. The aim {{of this study is to}} analyze to which extend the thickness of the lamellar crystals influences the yield stress for a series of propylene-based copolymers having a well-defined chain microstructure and crystallized in the α and/or γ forms, but possessing different degree of crystallinity, thickness of the lamellar crystals, stability of the crystals and also intrinsic flexibility of the portions of chains belonging to the amorphous regions, in relation with the degree of inclusion (exclusion) of the co-monomers in (from) the crystals. It is shown that, in the case of copolymers with a comonomer concentration lower than a threshold, the yield stress increases with increasing the lamellar thickness regardless of type of comonomer, the relative amount of the two polymorphs (α and γ forms), and the degree of inclusion, in good agreement with the predictions of the CMM approach. For copolymers with comonomer concentration higher than a threshold and bulky side groups, which are excluded from the crystals, the thickness of the lamellar crystals becomes low and the role of the chains in the amorphous regions becomes not negligible. In the case of copolymers with high butene concentration, instead, the stress at yield decreases with increasing the thickness of the lamellar crystals, because the high degree of inclusion of butene units in the crystals induces not only an increase in the thickness of the lamellar crystals, but also a decrease in the stability of the crystals, and the role of the chains located in the interlamellar amorphous layers acting as tie-molecules may not be disregarded...|$|R

40|$|The 5. 1 M_L Santa Barbara {{earthquake}} of 13 August 1978 {{occurred at}} 22 h 54 m 52. 8 s UTC. The epicenter was located 3 km southeast of Santa Barbara at 34 ° 23. 9 ′N latitude and 119 ° 40. 9 ′W longitude with a focal depth of 12. 7 km. The main shock was followed between 13 August and 30 September by 373 aftershocks that were located with the Caltech-USGS array. The aftershock zone extended 12 km WNW from the epicenter and was 6 km wide in the N-S direction, {{and it had}} a very clear temporal development. During the first 20 min of activity, all the aftershocks were located in a cluster 7 km WNW of the main shock epicenter. During the next 24 hr, the aftershock zone grew to 11 km in the WNW direction and 4 km in the N-S direction. During succeeding weeks, the zone extended to 12 by 6 km. This temporal-spatial development relative to the main shock epicenter may indicate that the initial rupture propagated 7 km unilaterally to the WNW, and the initial rupture plane may have been considerably smaller than the eventual aftershock zone. This smaller area suggests that the stress drop may have been significantly greater than that derived from the final aftershock zone. In cross section, the aftershock hypocenters outline a nearly horizontal plane (dipping 15 ° or less) at 13 km depth. The main shock focal mechanism indicates NNE-SSW compression and vertical extension. The preferred fault plane strikes N 80 °W and dips 26 °NNE, indicating north-over-south thrusting with a component of left-lateral movement. Focal mechanisms for 40 aftershocks also indicate compression in the general N-S direction. For most of these events, the north-dipping nodal plane dips between 7 ° and 45 °, with most dipping 25 ° or more, which is significantly steeper than the plane delineated by the hypocenters themselves. These observations are consistent with a tectonic model in which much <b>of</b> the <b>slip</b> during the Santa Barbara earthquake occurred on a nearly horizontal plane. The after shocks then might represent movement on a complex series of imbricate thrust faults that flatten into the <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> primary <b>slip.</b> Hence, the Santa Barbara earthquake may be taken as evidence for mid-crustal horizontal shearing in the western Transverse Ranges...|$|R

40|$|Gross {{features}} of the rupture mechanism of the 1979 Imperial Valley earth-quake (ML [...] 6. 6) are inferred from qualitative analysis of near-source ground motion data and observed surface rupture. A lower bound on the event's seismic moment of 2. 5 x 1025 dyne-cm is obtained by assuming that the average slip over the whole fault plane equals the average surface rupture, 40. 5 cm. Far-field estimates of moment suggest an average slip over the fault <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> 105 cm, from which a static stress drop of 11 bars is obtained.
