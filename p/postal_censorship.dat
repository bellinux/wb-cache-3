25|$|During the 1939–1945 Emergency {{extensive}} <b>postal</b> <b>censorship</b> {{took place}} {{under the control of}} the Department of Defence whose powers were conferred by the Emergency Powers Act 1939. Civilian mail was controlled by the approximately 200 censors who worked in Dublin's Exchequer Street and who had all been vetted by the G2 Directorate of Intelligence and the Gardaí. Using the Black List and White List to target certain mail, the small staff were unable to effect 100% censorship; however, continental European mail was all reviewed, as was all incoming and outbound airmail. Following the overthrow of France and the Low Countries in May 1940, the British instigated full terminal mail censorship but the Irish were unable to look at more than about 10% due to the enormous staff this would have required. Covert censorship of mail between Northern Ireland and the south was effected by warrants obtained by G2, who also obtained warrants from the Minister for Justice for internal mail oversight.|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1993 During World War I, {{editions of}} five Irish-American {{newspapers}} were {{banned from the}} mails by the United States Post Office. One newspaper and a magazine were forced out of business. These actions were ostensibly taken {{in the name of}} national security. This dissertation suggests, however, that the <b>postal</b> <b>censorships</b> were the culmination of a larger debate about American identity and the limits of pluralism during wartime. The dissertation examines two aspects of the press: First, how Irish-American newspapers gave voice to immigrant aspirations and helped sustain a sense of identity among the immigrant Irish and their offspring; second, how loyalty to Ireland and anger toward Great Britain produced a backlash against the Irish-American press once the U. S. entered the War. The first part of the study discusses the role of Irish-American newspapers within the national Irish-American community. The Irish-American press served {{as an alternative to the}} mainstream press. Irish-American newspapers offered an Irish interpretation of events and reinforced Irish identity, the central component of which was hatred of Britain. When the U. S. joined the War as Britain's ally, the unrelenting anglophobia of the Irish-American press came into conflict with mainstream opinion. The next section discusses role of the mainstream press in fomenting anti-Irish sentiment. The commercial daily press [...] with the exception of the Hearst papers [...] looked with suspicion upon Irish-American agitation against England. After the U. S. entered the War, the mainstream press encouraged vigilante activity and gave credence to unsubstantiated rumors of Irish/German plots. Some papers equated Irish-American nationalism with treason to the U. S. The final section examines the subsequent censorship of the Irish-American press. Postal documents reveal that officials and volunteers at the New York City Post Office were more often motivated by a desire to silence dissent than by a legitimate concern for national security. In the hysteria of the times, criticism of Great Britain and expressions of Irish-American support for national self-determination in Ireland became synonymous with disloyalty to the United States...|$|R

Initially all news was released to the press through the Ministry, but from 9 October 1939 government departments resumed responsibility for the release and censorship of news on subjects within their particular spheres, while central authority {{and the provision of}} common information services was committed to a Press and Censorship Bureau. A News Division, staffed by journalists, was established to issue news to home and overseas press, news agencies and the BBC. In April 1940 the Ministry took over the <b>Postal</b> and Telegraph <b>Censorship</b> sections previously under the War Office, which later became the <b>Postal</b> and Telegraph <b>Censorship</b> Department, and the powers of the Secretary of State for War under defence regulations were transferred to the minister. The Ministry, through its Home Intelligence Division, collected information relating to civilian morale and took over the Social Survey Organisation, previously undertaken by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. Overseas, in allied and neutral countries, the Ministry was responsible for information policy and output of material, absorbing the recently formed Foreign Publicity Department of the Foreign Office and much of the work of its News Department. Overseas publicity was organised geographically. American and Empire Divisions continued throughout the war, other areas being covered by a succession of different divisions. Divisions were represented overseas by bureaux and representatives, and through British missions. The Ministry was not intended to continue in existence after the war. In September 1945 its censorship work largely ceased and in March 1946 the Ministry was dissolved, its remaining functions passing to the Central Office of Information...|$|R

This was effected on 18 September 1939. In October 1939 responsibility for the censorship of the press went to the Minister for Information. Films were subject to the same censorship in November. On 3 November 1939 State Publicity Censors were established, initially in Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane and Adelaide, and District Publicity Censors in Perth, Hobart and Darwin with the office of the Chief Publicity Censor remaining in Melbourne. In March 1940 broadcasting censorship became the responsibility of the Minister for Information. The State Publicity Censor's office was transferred to the control of the Minister for Defence Co-ordination in 1942, and subsequently to the Minister for Defence until October 1943, when it was transferred back to the Minister for Information. Control of the <b>Postal</b> and Telegraph <b>Censorship</b> section of the Army District Censor became the responsibility of the State Publicity Censor in April 1942, as well as all censorship except that of mail.
