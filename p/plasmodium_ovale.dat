5|$|Three {{possible}} {{mechanisms of}} relapse were proposed by Marchoux in 1926 (i) parthenogenesis of macrogametocytes: (ii) persistence of schizonts in small {{numbers in the}} blood where immunity inhibits multiplication, but later disappears and/or (iii) reactivation of an encysted body in the blood. James in 1931 proposed that sporozoites are carried to internal organs, where they enter reticuloendothelial cells and undergo a cycle of development, based on quinine's lack of activity on them. Huff and Bloom in 1935 demonstrated stages of avian malaria that transpire outside blood cells (exoerythrocytic). In 1945 Fairley et al. reported that inoculation of blood from a patient with P. vivax may fail to induce malaria, although the donor may subsequently exhibit the condition. Sporozoites disappeared from the blood stream within one hour and reappeared eight days later. This suggested the presence of forms that persist in tissues. Using mosquitoes rather than blood, in 1946 Shute described a similar phenomenon and proposed {{the existence of an}} 'x-body' or resting form. The following year Sapero proposed a link between relapse and a tissue stage not yet discovered. Garnham in 1947 described exoerythrocytic schizogony in Hepatocystis (Plasmodium) kochi. In the following year Shortt and Garnham described the liver stages of P. cynomolgi in monkeys. In the same year a human volunteer consented to receive a massive dose of infected sporozoites of P. vivax and undergo a liver biopsy three months later, thus allowing Shortt et al. to demonstrate the tissue stage. The tissue form of <b>Plasmodium</b> <b>ovale</b> was described in 1954 and that of P. malariae in 1960 in experimentally infected chimpanzees.|$|E
25|$|Plasmodium {{was first}} {{identified}} when Charles Louis Alphonse Laveran described parasites {{in the blood}} of malaria patients in 1880. He named the parasite Oscillaria malariae. The fact that several species may be involved in causing different forms of malaria was first recognized by Camillo Golgi in 1886. Soon thereafter, Giovanni Batista Grassi and Raimondo Filetti named the parasites causing two different types of human malaria Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium malariae. In 1897, William Welch identified and named Plasmodium falciparum. This was followed by the recognition of the other two species of Plasmodium which infect humans: <b>Plasmodium</b> <b>ovale</b> (1922) and Plasmodium knowlesi (identified in long-tailed macaques in 1931; in humans in 1965). The contribution of insect hosts to the Plasmodium life cycle was described in 1897 by Ronald Ross and in 1899 by Giovanni Batista Grassi, Amico Bignami and Giuseppe Bastianelli.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A semi-nested, {{multiplex}} polymerase {{chain reaction}} (PCR) based on the amplification of the sequences of the 18 S small subunit ribosomal RNA (ssrRNA) gene was tested in a field trial in Equatorial Guinea (a hyperen-demic focus of malaria in west central Africa). The method uses a primary PCR amplification reaction with a universal reverse primer and two forward primers specific for the genus Plasmodium and to mammals (the mammalian-specific primer was included as a positive control to distinguish uninfected cases from inhibition of the PCR). The second amplification is carried out with the same Plasmodium genus-specific forward primer and four specific reverse primers for each human Plasmodium species. The PCR amplified products are differentiated by fragment size after electro-phoresis on a 2 % agarose gel. Four villages from three regions of the island of Bioko (Equatorial Guinea) and two suspected <b>Plasmodium</b> vivax-P. <b>ovale</b> infections from the hospital of Malabo were tested by microscopy and PCR.

40|$|Aim: To {{present a}} case of {{uncomplicated}} mixed <b>Plasmodium</b> falciparum and <b>ovale</b> malaria requiring treatment with artemether-lumefantrine and primaquine. Clinical features: A 40 -year-old female presented with a mixed infection of uncomplicated P. falciparum and ovale. Treatment was commenced with oral quinine sulphate 600 mg, 8 -hourly which was changed to artemether-lumefantrine and primaquine. A glucose- 6 -phosphate-dehydrogenase test revealed deficiency, necessitating an alteration of the primaquine regimen. Discussion: Malaria infections are often initially treated with quinine if the infective species is not known or if the infection is mixed. Oral quinine remains useful {{in the treatment of}} uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria, however the six-dose regimen of artemether-lumefantrine is an effective alternative. Conclusion: This case highlights the benefits of artemether-lumefantrine for mixed-uncomplicated malaria and the use of primaquine for eradication of liver stages for P. ovale infections. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|A TaqMan-based {{real-time}} PCR qualitative assay for {{the detection}} of three species of malaria parasites— <b>Plasmodium</b> falciparum, P. <b>ovale,</b> and P. vivax—was devised and evaluated using 122 whole-blood samples from patients who had traveled to areas where malaria is endemic and who presented with malaria-like symptoms and fever. The assay was compared to conventional microscopy and to an established nested-PCR assay. The specificity of the new assay was confirmed by sequencing the PCR products from all the positive samples and by the lack of cross-reactivity with Toxoplasma gondii and Leishmania infantum DNA. Real-time PCR assay showed a detection limit (analytical sensitivity) of 0. 7, 4, and 1. 5 parasites/l for P. falciparum, P. vivax, and P. ovale, respectively. Real-time PCR, like nested PCR, brought to light errors in the species identification by microscopic examination and revealed the presence of mixed infections (P. falciparum plus P. ovale). Real-time PCR can yield results within 2 h, does not require post-PCR processing, reduces sample handling, and minimizes the risks of contamination.

40|$|Introduction Relapses are {{important}} contributors to illness and morbidity in <b>Plasmodium</b> vivax and <b>ovale</b> infections. Relapse prevention (radical cure) with primaquine {{is required for}} optimal management, control and ultimately elimination of Plasmodium vivax malaria. A review was conducted with publications in English, French, Portuguese and Spanish using the search terms "P. vivax" and "relapse". Areas covered Hypnozoites causing relapses may be activated weeks or months after initial infection. Incidence and temporal patterns of relapse varies geographically. Relapses derive from parasites either genetically similar or different from the primary infection indicating that some derive from previous infections. Malaria illness itself may activate relapse. Primaquine is the only widely available treatment for radical cure. However, it is often not given because of uncertainty over the risks of primaquine induced haemolysis when G 6 PD deficiency testing is unavailable. Recommended dosing of primaquine for radical cure in East Asia and Oceania is 0. 5 mg base/kg/day and elsewhere is 0. 25 mg base/kg/day. Alternative treatments are under investigation. Expert commentary Geographic heterogeneity in relapse patterns and chloroquine susceptibility of P. vivax, and G 6 PD deficiency epidemiology mean that radical treatment should be given much {{more than it is}} today. G 6 PD testing should be made widely available so primaquine can be given more safely...|$|R
40|$|This work {{investigated}} the permeation of primaquine across full-thickness excised human skin from two acrylate transdermal adhesives. Primaquine base was formulated with National Starch 387 - 2516 and 387 - 2287 to provide aluminium foil-backed 1 -cm diameter patches, each loaded with 10 mg drug. Other patches were prepared that included Migliol 840 {{as a potential}} penetration enhancer. The patches were applied to cadaver skin in Franz-type diffusion cells and the permeation of primaquine determined over a 24 -h period. Relatively high fluxes were found, the highest being from those formulations lacking the Migliol 840 : 5. 68 ± 0. 30 × 10 − 2 mg cm− 2 h− 1 from 387 - 2516; 4. 94 ± 0. 20 × 10 − 2 mg cm− 2 h− 1 from 387 - 2287.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Most studies {{dealing with}} {{automated}} hematology analyzers (HAs) and malaria diagnosis are conducted in endemic countries. METHODS: We retrospectively studied cell blood counts (CBCs) performed with Sysmex XE- 2100 and XE- 5000 HAs in our center (Angers, France) regarding 67 patients returning from endemic areas and infected with various Plasmodium species. RESULTS: In 83 % of infected samples with <b>Plasmodium</b> vivax (Pv), <b>ovale</b> (Po), or malariae (Pm), extra clouds of dots {{were present in}} neutrophil and/or eosinophil area(s) on routine differential (DIFF) scattergrams. In contrast, samples infected with Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) failed to show such DIFF scattergrams, or any other suggesting malaria infection (0 / 49 pts). Abnormal areas from DIFF scattergrams {{were related to the}} presence of mature schizonts and gametocytes, undestroyed by lysis agent, the latter not observed in Pf-infected patients from our series. The internal parameter WBC[DIFF] - WBC[BASO] raised in parallel to parasitemia in Pv, Po, and Pm samples but could not be used as a surrogate for parasitemia. In Pf infection, reticulocyte/ immature reticulocyte fraction (IRF) ratio showed a significant correlation with parasitemia (P <  0. 05). A diagnostic model developed for Pf in endemic countries showed sensitivity of 77 %. CONCLUSION: Using SYSMEX analyzers, Pv, Po, and Pm infections are easy to ascertain as DIFF scattergrams are almost specific (specificity =  99. 9 %). Pf infection diagnosis by CBC may be a more promising tool...|$|R
