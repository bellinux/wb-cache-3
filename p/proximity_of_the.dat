5|$|The {{formation}} of Bertha in close <b>proximity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> East Coast of the United States prompted residents {{to stock up}} on emergency supplies and monitor the storm. The Maritimes Weather Center and National Hurricane Center began to issue warnings for Nova Scotia and most of Atlantic Canada on July31 and August1. By the following day, all warnings and advisories for Atlantic Canada were dropped as Bertha dissipated.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} of MacIntyres in Scotland {{to those in}} Ireland is not entirely clear. Given the <b>proximity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two countries and the similarity of their languages, some Scottish MacIntyres undoubtedly settled in Ireland, mainly in Ulster.|$|E

5|$|The {{school was}} part of the East Bay Athletic League (EBAL) for its first year, but has since moved to the Diablo Foothill Athletic League (DFAL). Dougherty's main rival is {{considered}} to be Dublin High School, due to the close <b>proximity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two schools and past controversy between the schools' respective coaches. In 2016, Dougherty returned {{as a member of the}} East Bay Athletic League.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{distinct}} local weather phenomena, marked downslope lee winds {{caused by the}} <b>proximity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pennines, leading to super geostrophic winds which can reach in excess of 60KT (70mph), most commonly in winter and spring. In the winter {{the presence of a}} subsidence inversion between the Pennines and the North York Moors can allow dense, persistent fog to form which can last for several days.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the weather}} had been mostly rainy {{up to this point}} in the campaign, a snow storm arrived the night of February 13, with strong winds that brought {{temperatures}} down to 10–12°F (−12°C) and deposited 3inches (8cm) of snow by morning. Guns and wagons were frozen to the earth. Because of the <b>proximity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> enemy lines and the active sharpshooters, the soldiers could not light campfires for warmth or cooking, and both sides were miserable that night, many having arrived without blankets or overcoats.|$|E

5|$|Cassel was {{annexed to}} France the {{following}} year {{under the terms of}} the Treaty of Nijmegen, which ended the war. The annexation led to the town's defences being dismantled; it was considered indefensible, as it was within easy firing range of the nearby Mont des Récollets, and it would have cost far too much to fortify both hills. In addition, the revised frontier following the treaty was now a significant distance from Cassel and without the <b>proximity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> border, the town was no longer seen as having much strategic significance.|$|E
5|$|Despite the <b>proximity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city centre, the Žirmūnai {{bank of the}} River Neris {{is covered}} with a strip of dense {{deciduous}} forest that begins at the Žirmūnai Bridge and continues upstream (northeasterly). The forested strip is largely uninterrupted, with gaps near bridges. At the approximate centrepoint of the Žirmūnai shoreline, the forest surrounds a backwater, which had been used to park disused passenger ferries. The forest's northernmost section is part of a botanical nature reserve within Verkiai Regional Park.|$|E
5|$|Despite the <b>proximity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two schools, the 2009 Chick-fil-A Bowl {{was only}} their eighth {{football}} meeting. Tennessee held a 5-2 {{advantage in the}} series, but before 1994, the last meeting between them was in 1937. The 1994 meeting was in the 1994 Gator Bowl, which the Volunteers won 45-23. Each school rapidly sold its allotment of 17,000 tickets, and publicly available tickets were sold out before the matchup was announced. This gave the Chick-fil-A Bowl its 13th consecutive sellout.|$|E

5|$|Due to the <b>proximity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Roman road, entrenchments and relics {{it seems}} that the {{earliest}} settlement at Northallerton was some form of Roman military station. There is evidence that the Romans had a signal station on Castle Hills just {{to the west of the}} town as part of the imperial Roman postal system and a path connecting Hadrian's Wall with Eboracum (York) ran through what is now the neighbouring village of Brompton.|$|E
5|$|During {{the height}} of the typhoon at Cabras Island on Guam, a {{gasoline}} tank caught fire, believed to be from friction caused by extremely high winds running through its ventilation system. The tank exploded, sending its lid airborne and spreading the fire to other nearby tanks. The <b>proximity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tanks as well as low water pressure hampered firefighting efforts, and the fire was extinguished five days later; it resulted in three destroyed gasoline tanks with two more caught on fire. While the fire was burning, transportation of gasoline from the port to the rest of Guam was suspended resulting in a halt in gasoline sales for the general public.|$|E
5|$|Further afield, {{the club}} has a rivalry with Bristol City, known as the Severnside derby, {{and to a lesser}} extent, Bristol Rovers. There is also a lesser rivalry with Welsh {{neighbours}} Newport County due to the <b>proximity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two Welsh cities. However, they have rarely played against each another since the 1980s due to Cardiff being in higher leagues. In total they have only ever played 20 football league games against each other. A survey by Football Fans Census in 2003 saw Swansea, Bristol City and Newport listed as Cardiff's main three rivalries, with Stoke City matching Newport in third.|$|E

5|$|In a contest, a row {{of small}} cages, each housing a single male finch, is lined up {{approximately}} six feet apart along a street. The close <b>proximity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cages increases the number of calls, as the birds sing for mates and to establish territory. A timekeeper begins and ends the contest with a red flag. Every time a bird sings a correct terminating flourish to their callmost often transcribed as susk-e-wieta tally mark in chalk is made on a long wooden stick. The bird singing its song the most times during one hour wins the contest. Champion finches regularly sing hundreds of calls in contests.|$|E
5|$|Later on, {{being told}} by his brother, Jerome, of some gossip overheard by a waiter between British {{officers}} at lunch at the 'King of Spain' inn in Genappe that the Prussians were to march over from Wavre, Napoleon declared that the Prussians would need at least two days to recover and would {{be dealt with by}} Grouchy. Surprisingly, Jerome's overheard gossip aside, the French commanders present at the pre-battle conference at Le Caillou had no information about the alarming <b>proximity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Prussians and did not suspect that Blücher's men would start erupting onto the field of battle in great numbers just five hours later.|$|E
5|$|Ohioans post-war {{career was}} {{relatively}} uneventful until 8 October 1936, {{when she ran}} aground near Seal Rock at the Golden Gate, the entrance to San Francisco Bay. Attempts to free the ship were unsuccessful and, because of the close <b>proximity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wreck to San Francisco, the grounded Ohioan drew large crowds to watch salvage operations. Angelo J. Rossi, the mayor of San Francisco, toured the wreck on 19 October. Ohioans hulk caught fire in March 1937, and the wreck broke into two pieces in a storm in December. As late as 1939, some of Ohioans rusty steel beams were still visible on the rocks.|$|E

5|$|On 9 July, a group {{representing}} Pakistani madrasahs, {{headed by}} Maulana Salimullah Khan, {{called for an}} immediate cessation of the Lal Masjid operation. Finland also temporarily closed its embassy in Islamabad on 9 July due to the deteriorating security situation and the <b>proximity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> embassy to the mosque compound. By 10 July, the Pakistani government reported that 100 militants and between 300 and 400 women and children remained inside the mosque.|$|E
5|$|<b>Proximity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{peninsula}} to the Gulf Stream {{leads to}} unusually high temperatures in winter, resulting in significant temperature variations between {{land and the}} Barents Sea and in fluctuating temperatures during high winds. Cyclones are typical during the cold seasons, while the warm seasons are characterized by anticyclones. Monsoon winds are common in most areas, with south and southwesterly winds prevailing in winter months and with somewhat more pronounced easterly winds in summer. Strong storm winds blow for 80–120days a year. The waters of the Murman Coast remain warm enough to remain ice-free even in winter.|$|E
