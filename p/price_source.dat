40|$|Yukon {{has one of}} {{the highest}} {{economic}} growth rates in Canada driven in large part by investment in the mining sector. Sustaining this growth requires a reliable and competitive <b>price</b> <b>source</b> of energy. Yukon has abundant natural gas resources. This initiative, Energy for Yukon (E 4 Y) : The Natural Gas Option, examines the feasibility of developing Yukon’s significant natural gas resources to meet Yukon’s current and future energy demands and examines what is required to develop these valuable resources. As stated in the Energy Strategy for Yukon: “The government’s strategy for oil and gas is focused on how to best develop Yukon’s resources and also meet Yukon’s energy needs. ” 1 Unless new sources of renewable energy are developed, the current alternative is diesel generation which is costly and contrary to Yukon’s Climate Change Action Plan. Reliance on diesel to meet future demand may stall proposed mining projects (due to cost) and likely increase the cost of energy for residential and commercial customers. It would also significantly increase Yukon’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This paper summarizes the findings of this initiative and suggests next steps. In doing so it presents Yukon’s requirements for energy and the available energy options to enable continue...|$|E

The measures include quantity of milk, <b>price,</b> <b>source</b> of credit, access to commercial feeds and access to breeding services. The study also considers the role of infrastructure component in enhancing the marketing system. Data for the study came from both secondary and primary sources. Milk price and quantity data came from my survey and supplemented with data from the KDB and other published sources. The study interviewed 60 farmers (using a structured questionnaire), 29 from Kapsaret division and 31 from Turbo division who were not displaced. Three officials from different milk collecting centers and one processor were interviewed. Officials from the Kenya Dairy Board (KDB), Ministry of Livestock Development (MoLD) and Ministry of Cooperative development were also interviewed. The study reveals an estimated loss of about 1. 6 million liters (due to PEV) of milk worth Kshs 36. 8 million per month (€ 368000); (€ 1 = Kshs 100 Aug 2008) delivered to the market between the months of January and March 2008. The study also found that the milk prices significantly went up after the post election violence both in formal and informal marketing systems with an average of 22 % increase. Access to services like breeding (especially AI) and quality commercial feeds has been affected in that the services are hardly available and if they are, the price is extremely high.

40|$|Water {{has become}} {{increasingly}} scarce in northwestern China due to climate change, economic growth and burgeoning population. Improving agriculture water use efficiency is of strategic significance in promoting socio-economic water productivity for arid and semi-arid inland river basins. Based on the household-level data collected in Zhangye City, which {{is located in the}} middle reaches of Heihe River Basin (HRB) in northwestern China, irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE) of maize is estimated based on stochastic frontier analysis. The impacts of influential factors, especially the participatory irrigation management (PIM) through water user associations (WUAs), on IWUE were further examined. Results show that the estimated average Technical efficiency (TE) and IWUE of maize production are 0. 74 and 0. 24, respectively. The participation level in irrigation management is very low, with only 40 % of the respondents participating in WUA meetings. In addition, most have a relatively superficial understanding of the roles and management scheme of WUAs. Empirical results show that though significantly positive, the magnitude of the impact of PIM on IWUE is relatively small. Households that participated in WUA meetings achieved only 0. 002 % higher IWUEs than those have never participated in. WUAs are not operating with their designed objectives. Consequently, reform of the traditional management form of WUAs to make them more transparent, fair, and extensively participated in among farmers is in urgently need. In addition, we also find that water <b>price,</b> <b>source</b> of irrigation water, irrigation technology adoption and famers’ education level and farming experience also have significant positive impacts on IWUE...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE OF THE STUDY In {{this thesis}} I examine non-trading and trading period returns and their {{differences}} for globally traded equity index, interest rate and commodity futures. I decompose the continuous price pattern of futures into Night and Day returns, thus close-to-open and open-to-close returns. My first {{objective is to}} determine the differences between Night and Day returns. Second, I study whether seasonal return anomalies and patterns presented in previous literature hold also during non-trading periods, thus when markets are closed. The anomalies include a day-of-the-week and weekend effect, January effect and holiday effect. DATA A data sample includes 17 futures whose underlying assets present three different asset classes: equity indices, interest rates and commodities. Data is gathered from Bloomberg and <b>price</b> <b>source</b> for each future is their primary trading exchange. The sample consists of open and close prices for over 15 years from 1997 to 2012. In total, the time period includes nearly 4 000 trading days and in total 64 428 future day observations. RESULTS I find non-trading and trading period price patterns to differ significantly. I report negative Day returns for equity index and commodity futures during the sample period. According to the study the premiums are earned solely during the Night time when markets are closed. Additionally, the volatility of Night returns is lower than volatility of Day returns. The results thus imply that there is no reward of bearing higher risk in daytime volatility. In consistence, Day time returns for interest rate futures are positive and Night returns negative. My findings supports the results of previous literature which argue that non-trading period returns outperform day returns in equity markets in the past decade. In contribution to previous literature I broaden the results across asset classes and internationally...|$|E

40|$|Version 2, draft 1. 00 Central Counterparties (CCPs) {{are widely}} {{promoted}} as {{a requirement for}} safe banking [BCB 11 a, BCB 11 b, BCB 12], with little dissent except on technical grounds (such as proliferation of CCPs) [DZ 11, Sin 12]. Whilst CCPs can have major operational positives, we argue that CCPs have many of the business characteristics of Rating Agencies, and face similar business pressures. Thus we see a risk that prices from CCPs may develop the characteristics attributed to ratings from Rating Agency pre-crisis [TE 07, BD 09, Sta 11]. Business overreliance on ratings of questionable accuracy {{is seen as a}} cause of the financial crisis [Par 08, Sta 11]. We see the potential for same situation to be repeated with prices from CCPs. Thus the regulatory emphasis on CCPs, rather than on collateralization, may create the preconditions for an avoidable repeat of the financial crisis. The outline of the paper is as follows: we first describe the functions of a CCP, highlighting how they are carried out; then we give CCP business characteristics, comparing and contrasting them with Rating Agencies; next we develop the potential consequences. We conclude by emphasising the key risk mechanism (complacency with CCP prices) and our recommendation (avoid privileging any <b>price</b> <b>source</b> or method). CCP Functions The main function of a CCP is to remove credit risk transmission by intermediating trades and by only doing collateralized trades. A CCP does not remove credit risk. CCPs only block one credit risk transmission route: direct counterparty exposure. If there is a systematic crisis, e. g. assets dropping suddenly in value, CCPs offer no protection. The issue in a systematic asset price crisis is not counterparty exposure but credit risk from asset value (or rather, the lack of it). Indeed since CCPs transform credit risk transmission into liquidity risk [Gre 12] and since they actualize market volatility on a day-to-day basis, CCPs may actually increase default risks [KS 12 b]. A CCP must set prices on all its trades in order to call, or return, collateral. In general CCPs base prices as far as possible on transaction prices from the ∗The views expressed {{are those of the authors}} only, no other representation should be attributed...|$|E

Markets allow any trade-able item to be evaluated and priced.
