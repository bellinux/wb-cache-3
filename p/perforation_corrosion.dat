Today {{used in the}} OEM automotive industry primarily {{for the purpose of}} seals against air leaks and to waterproof sheetmetal overlaps that occur in the assembly of a vehicle. Such overlaps are typically decorative rather than structurally supportive. Accordingly, they are usually only spot welded and this process results in a closure that is not air or water tight.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} zinc and zinc alloy coated steel sheets on {{cosmetic}} corrosion and <b>perforation</b> <b>corrosion</b> in actual automobiles and the relevant corrosion mecha-nisms were studied. The main factor affecting cosmetic corrosion {{on the outside}} of outer panels was the coating weight of the Zn or Zn alloy coating rather than the type of coating. Perforation occurred in 6 â€“ 7 years inside of door hems where Zn-rich primer coated steel panels were used, whereas <b>perforation</b> <b>corrosion</b> life was more than 14 years in galvanized steel sheets with a 120 g/m Zn coating weight in lapped side-sills. Measurements of the perforation depth and analysis of the composition of the iron rusts formed on automobile bodies in North America showed that the <b>perforation</b> <b>corrosion</b> process in hot-dip galvanized steel sheets can be divided into 4 stages. The period during which Zn corrosion products control corrosion of the steel substrate plays a very important role in determining the period until perfora-tion occurs in automobile bodies in regions where road deicing salt is used...|$|E
40|$|Neural {{networks}} {{were applied to}} the analysis of electrochemical noise data. Electrochemical noise is defined as the fluctuations in either current or potential with time for a metal which is immersed in a conductive solution. This data is of interest because of its relationship to particular corrosion processes. Specifically, a system which is experiencing uniform corrosion will produce a different noise signal than one which is experiencing localized (<b>perforation)</b> <b>corrosion.</b> The economic effects of corrosion are significant and methods which improve the ability to detect, measure and predict corrosion would be extremely valuable. Two series of experiments were conducted. The data for both series were collected from aluminum samples immersed in various aqueous solutions. The series differed from each other in the configuration and programming of the potentiostat which collected the data. The first series only dealt with potential noise while the second series dealt with both potential and current noise. Auxiliary parameters, such as the pH and chloride concentration of the solutions were used in the second series. The first series studied data from only two solutions, while the second series included six solutions. It was possible for neural networks to correctly categorize systems in Series 1 according to the class of corrosion being observed (uniform or perforating). Appropriate data transformation steps were required to effect these classifications and it was also observed that many of these data transformations would lead directly to categorization without the use of a neural network. The additional data collected in Series 2 allowed a more complex analysis. Neural {{networks were}} able to simultaneously predict both the propensity towards localized corrosion and the metal dissolution rate. This application demonstrated the power of neural networks. Several types of neural networks and learning algorithms were included in this study. The two systems used most were a backpropagation (multi-layer perceptron) and a radial basis system. Comparisons of the various network systems with regard to speed and accuracy were made. Department of Mathematical SciencesThesis (M. A. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The plate heat {{exchanger}} in oil cooler of unit 2 in a thermal power plant became <b>corrosion</b> <b>perforation</b> after 2 -year running, and severe pits were found on its surface. The material and scale composition of the lubricating oil cooler was analyzed, and {{it was found that}} the oil cooler was made of 304 stainless steel, instead of the 316 stainless steel provided by factory. The corrosion products on the corroded surface were composed of some characteristic elements in cooling water. The analysis suggested that the reason for <b>corrosion</b> <b>perforation</b> of the {{heat exchanger}} could be associated with its material composition, and the under scale corrosion formed under the action of scale deposition could also cause <b>corrosion</b> <b>perforation</b> and large-scale pits...|$|R

The stomach mucosa showed blackish brown discolouration and thinning of the wall; suggestive of damages caused by sulfuric acid. In a death due to acid ingestion; autopsy showed distal third oesophagus <b>perforation,</b> stomach <b>corrosion,</b> pulmonary and cerebral oedema (Amadasi et al. 2016). We also, observed similar autopsy findings.|$|R
25|$|Vitreous-lined {{tanks are}} much lower in initial cost, and often include {{one or more}} {{sacrificial}} anode rods {{designed to protect the}} tank from <b>perforation</b> caused by <b>corrosion</b> made necessary since chlorinated water is very corrosive to carbon steel. As it is very nearly impossible to apply any protective coating perfectly (without microscopic cracks or pinhole defects in the protective layer) manufacturers may recommend a periodic check of any sacrificial anode, replacing it when necessary.|$|R
50|$|Audi {{produces}} 100% galvanised cars {{to prevent}} corrosion, {{and was the}} first mass-market vehicle to do so, following introduction of the process by Porsche, c. 1975. Along with other precautionary measures, the full-body zinc coating has proved to be very effective in preventing rust. The body's resulting durability even surpassed Audi's own expectations, causing the manufacturer to extend its original 10-year warranty against <b>corrosion</b> <b>perforation</b> to currently 12 years (except for aluminium bodies which do not rust).|$|R
50|$|In September 1986, Audi {{released}} a new Typ 89 Audi 80 for the 1987 model {{year on the}} European market and introduced it elsewhere within a year. It {{was based on a}} new platform which broke the relationship between the 80 and the Volkswagen Passat, the corresponding third generation of which used the transverse-engined Volkswagen B3 platform, whilst Audi stuck with the longitudinal front wheel drive layout for the B3-series 80. Although often called the typ 89 even among knowledgeable Audi enthusiasts, the official and correct nomenclature was its production code Typ 89 from 1987 to 1989, and Typ 8A from 1990 onwards (in line with a restructuring of many VW platform designations). It introduced a new aerodynamic look and a fully galvanised bodyshell. This was the first mid-sized car to feature a fully zinc-coated body, giving it longevity and durability against <b>corrosion</b> <b>perforation.</b> This protective shield proved to be so effective that Audi extended its <b>corrosion</b> <b>perforation</b> warranty from the originally offered ten years to twelve years (during early pre-production, the body was expected to be good for only eight years). Audi still uses zinc galvanisation for all current steel-bodied models.|$|R

The method of repair welding is firstly applied {{to repair the}} <b>corrosion</b> <b>perforation</b> on the impeller, and then Belzona polymer material is applied to paint the impeller.

40|$|The rapid {{development}} of energy, electricity, and transportation industries {{has created a}} market for steel pipes; however, buried steel pipelines near high-voltage transmission lines and electrified railways often experience alternating current (AC) corrosion at the damaged coating of pipelines; such phenomenon is mostly due to the resistance between the capacitance and inductance coupling, especially for long-distance pipelines in parallel operation. AC corrosion can cause pipeline <b>corrosion</b> <b>perforation</b> and stress <b>corrosion</b> cracking (SCC) in some cases, {{which has been a}} vital threat to the pipeline safety. In this work, the influence of AC on corrosion behavior of X 80 pipeline steel was investigated in NS 4 near-neutral solution by data acquisition technique, electrochemical test, immersion tests and surface analysis techniques. Results show that with the increasing of AC density, corrosion morphology changed from uniform corrosion to localized corrosion with many pits. Under the full AC interference, X 80 steel occurred cathodic and anodic polarization which resulted in iron dissolution and hydrogen precipitation. The negative half wave AC would lead to hydrogen evolution and hydrogen induced anodic dissolution, the pits in X 80 steel surface present sharp. However, under disturbance of positive half-wave AC, only anodic dissolution occurred and the pitting appeared spill shape and smoothly. Under various AC waveform interference, the corrosion products of X 80 steel surface were different. Under full AC wave and positive half-wave interference, the corrosion products were loose, had have no alpha-FeOOH and occurred cracks; however, under negative half-wave AC interference, the corrosion products were denser and contained alpha-FeOOH which has protective effect on substrates...|$|R

The results showed that: the reason of pitting corrosion of 0 Cr 18 Ni 9 stainless steel cooling water pipes was the existence of multiple Cl-and easily fouling Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + in water, with the corrosion products mainly the oxides of Fe and Cr; the economic measures to prevent pitting corrosion were to increase the pH of water and decrease the content of Ca 2 + and Mg 2 +...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} numerical {{results of}} stress concentration factors for plates perforated by corrosion. Evidence from 25 plates with <b>corrosion</b> <b>perforation</b> considered show that typical shapes may {{be characterized as}} a deviation from an ellipse or from a circle. In order to model typical perforations created by this type of corrosion, holes with non-circular boundaries have been considered {{in the form of}} cosine shape and variations from it. Two load cases are investigated: uniaxial and shear stress fields in an elastic plane stress problem. The influence of the amplitude of deviation with respect to an ellipse or circle and the local curvature of the internal boundary of the hole are studied. A simplified model of an equivalent ellipse originally proposed by Nishida is shown to provide good estimates for stress concentration factors for a range of shapes induced by corrosion...|$|R
40|$|Casing {{coupling}} location signals {{provided by}} the magnetic localizer in retractors are typically used to ascertain the position of casing couplings in horizontal wells. However, the casing coupling location signal is usually submerged in noise, which {{will result in the}} failure of casing coupling detection under the harsh logging environment conditions. The limitation of Shannon wavelet time entropy, in the feature extraction of casing status, is presented by analyzing its application mechanism, and a corresponding improved algorithm is subsequently proposed. On the basis of wavelet transform, two derivative algorithms, singular values decomposition and Tsallis entropy theory, are proposed and their physics meanings are researched. Meanwhile, a novel data mining approach to extract casing status features with Tsallis wavelet singularity entropy is put forward in this paper. The theoretical analysis and experiment results indicate that the proposed approach can not only extract the casing coupling features accurately, but also identify the characteristics of <b>perforation</b> and local <b>corrosion</b> in casings. The innovation of the paper is in the use of simple wavelet entropy algorithms to extract the complex nonlinear logging signal features of a horizontal well tractor...|$|R
