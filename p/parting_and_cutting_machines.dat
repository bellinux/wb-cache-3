40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{two-level}} model {{by using a}} nonlinear integer programming model and queuing theory with the Kendall-Lee A/B/C/D/E/F notation to assist garment manufacturers to evaluate their existing combinations of spreading <b>and</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>machines</b> installed in the cutting floor. The first level is a nonlinear integer programming model to determine the optimal number of spreading <b>and</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>machines</b> constrained by a given arrival rate of jobs and the service rate of the machines. The second level is {{used to determine the}} total cost of delay with the proposed number of machines which is given by the first model. In order to obtain the solution of this two-level model, M/M/ 1 /GD/c/∞ and M/M/s/GD/c/∞ queuing theory models are applied on the second-level model and case studies are used to illustrate its application. The proposed approach is worthwhile for those manufacturers who intend to make a big investment in automation on their cutting floor.

40|$|Purpose: Manufacturing systems {{include a}} {{complicated}} combination of resources, such as materials, labors, and machines. Hence, when the manufacturing systems {{are faced with}} a problem related to the availability of resources it is difficult to identify {{the root of the problem}} accurately and effectively. Managers and engineers in companies are trying to achieve a robust production line based on the maximum productivity. The main goal of this paper is to design a robust production line, taking productivity into account in the selected manufacturing industry. Design/methodology/approach: This paper presents the application of Taguchi method along with computer simulation for finding an optimum factor setting for three controllable factors, which are a number of welding <b>machines,</b> hydraulic <b>machines,</b> <b>and</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>machines</b> by analyzing the effect of noise factors in a selected manufacturing industry. Findings and Originality/value: Based on the final results, the optimal design parameter of welding unit of in the selected manufacturing industry will be obtained when factor A is located at level 2 and B and C are located at level 1. Therefore, maximum productive desirability is achieved when the number of welding <b>machines,</b> hydraulic <b>machines,</b> <b>and</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>machines</b> is equal to 17, 2, and 1, respectively. This paper has a significant role in designing a robust production line by considering the lowest cost and timely manner based on the Taguchi method. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
