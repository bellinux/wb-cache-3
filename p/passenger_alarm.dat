50|$|Each car was 62 ft {{long and}} 10 ft wide. The chairs {{could be turned}} around in order that the {{passengers}} were always looking in the travel direction. The cars had electric lighting powered by axle driven generators. 3rd class passengers did not have reserved seats. Punkah fans were provided only in 1st and 2nd class. The cars were fitted with vacuum brake and <b>passenger</b> <b>alarm</b> signal.|$|E
50|$|These two fleets, {{were called}} the New Technology Test Trains (NTTTs), and would test {{features}} {{that would be}} implemented on future mass-production orders, specifically the New Technology Trains. The R110A tested new technology including AC propulsion with regeneration, microprocessor-controlled doors and brakes, roof-mounted hermetic air-conditioning units, and fabricated trucks with air bags suspension. Passenger emergency intercoms for contacting train crews, <b>passenger</b> <b>alarm</b> strips to press {{in case of an}} emergency, improved lighting, glass to see into the next cars and the platform, and computerized announcements were all implemented.|$|E
50|$|The trains have closed-circuit {{television}} and <b>passenger</b> <b>alarms</b> for public safety, visual and audible door indicators, LCD screens for travel information and advertising, and line maps with lights that indicate the next stations. SEC Lighting provided the semi-recessed fluorescent saloon lighting for the trains.|$|R
5000|$|Yellow Emergency <b>Alarm</b> (formerly <b>Passenger</b> Assistance <b>Alarm)</b> strips on all {{subway and}} RT cars since 1977 {{and on the}} Flexity Outlook streetcars since they were {{introduced}} in 2014.|$|R
50|$|On {{the fourth}} {{evening of the}} voyage, a steward found the ships hair salon ablaze, with flames {{spreading}} quickly toward the <b>passenger</b> cabins. <b>Alarms</b> sounded too softly to be heard by most people on board.|$|R
60|$|The <b>passengers</b> became <b>alarmed.</b> The {{commercial}} traveller {{was rather}} less rubicund. Billy still tried to joke, but his efforts were not well received. The officer in his blue uniform at once {{took his place}} as rightful leader in a crisis. They all looked to him and appealed to him.|$|R

50|$|Bravo, Bravo, Bravo, {{used by many}} {{cruise lines}} to alert crew to a fire or other serious {{incident}} on board without <b>alarming</b> <b>passengers.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 2004 a {{group of}} Syrian musicians boarded Northwest Airlines Flight 327. Some <b>passengers</b> were <b>alarmed</b> by the men, {{including}} Annie Jacobsen who brought the flight to national attention. She described the group of men's behavior as consistent with a dry run. Investigating authorities including the FBI concluded there was no terrorist threat.|$|R
50|$|Beginning in 1989, {{all of the}} 43 8-car trains {{were taken}} to Acton Works, where they were fitted with <b>passenger</b> <b>alarms,</b> a public address system and other safety related features. The {{original}} hydraulic parking brakes were replaced by a new spring-operated brake. Following these changes, two units were selected for refurbishment, which was undertaken by Tickford Rail of Rosyth Royal Dockyard and Vic Berry of Leicester. The work included replacement of the seats, lighting, panelling and grab rails. The transverse seating in the centre section was replaced by longitudenal seating, reducing the seating capacity by 4, but increasing standing room. Externally, the cars were painted in a red, white and blue livery. The two units resumed service on 9 October 1989, and in June 1990, a rolling programme to update all of the cars was awarded to Tickford Rail. The work was completed in 1995.|$|R
30|$|A safety {{management}} system was established to achieve modular security management. The system includes eight modules: train operation, <b>passenger</b> transport, fire <b>alarm,</b> equipment, and facilities, construction operations, external environment, social security management, and ticketing revenue.|$|R
50|$|In September 2010, it was {{reported}} that <b>passengers</b> were experiencing <b>alarming</b> 'wobbles' on tunnel sections. The problem was described by Southeastern as non-dangerous, and trains were fitted with dampers to prevent the problem from recurring.|$|R
5000|$|On 13 December 2013, the Toronto Police {{were called}} in after gun shots were fired on board a subway train at the station. The <b>Passenger</b> Assistance <b>Alarm</b> was pressed, and the station was {{evacuated}} soon after. A man in his 20s was shot and was rushed to nearby St. Michael's Hospital in life-threatening condition, but stable on the day after. The station continued to be closed on 14 December 2013, with subway service from Bloor to Union stations being replaced by shuttle bus service.|$|R
5000|$|In the Time Out review, John Pym saw Jet Storm as, [...] "A British {{prototype}} for the Airport disaster {{movies of the}} 60s and 70s." [...] He went on to note, [...] "... like its later supersonic counterparts, Endfield's film is naive and contrived, but not without interest as the <b>alarmed</b> <b>passengers</b> soon divide into groups: reactionary (advocating torture) and liberal (patience and persuasion)." ...|$|R
5000|$|An {{incident}} of the voyage will illustrate {{the perils of}} those days, as well as Morrison's fortitude. After a terrible spell of storm, the <b>passengers</b> were <b>alarmed</b> to hear the clanking of swords and the explosion of firearms. They soon learned that a mutiny had broken out among the seamen, who were wretchedly paid, and who had taken possession of the forepart of the vessel, {{with the intention of}} turning the cannon there against the officers of the ship. It was a critical moment. At the height of the alarm, Morrison calmly walked forward among the mutineers, and, after some earnest words of persuasion, induced the majority of them to return to their places the remainder were easily captured, flogged, and put in irons.|$|R
5000|$|CSL {{was found}} {{responsible}} for the disastrous September 1949 fire and destruction of its ship the [...] in Toronto Harbour. The fire swept through the ship killing 118 to 139 passengers (many as they slept), but no members of the crew. Inadequate <b>alarm,</b> <b>passenger</b> evacuation plans, and neglected extinguishing systems are found at fault. The captain was suspended one year for abandoning the ship before ensuring crew and passengers were safe. She was demolished in 1950.|$|R
60|$|It was an {{armament}} fitted out by M'Tavish, who {{had with}} him Mr. J. Stuart, another partner of the Northwest Company, together with some clerks, and sixty-eight men--seventy-five souls in all. They {{had heard of the}} frigate Phoebe and the Isaac Todd being on the high seas, and were on their way down to await their arrival. In one of the canoes Mr. Clarke came as a <b>passenger,</b> the <b>alarming</b> intelligence having brought him down from his post on the Spokan. Mr. M'Kenzie immediately determined to return with him to Astoria, and, veering about, the two parties encamped together for the night. The leaders, of course, observed a due decorum, but some of the subalterns could not restrain their chuckling exultation, boasting that they would soon plant the British standard on the walls of Astoria, and drive the Americans out of the country.|$|R
50|$|The {{equipment}} list was generally sparse, with budget models having drivers airbag, seat belt pre-tensioners, cassette player, heated rear screen and tinted windows, and early MK1s with keypad immobilisers and a clock {{in place of}} a tachometer and 3 stud wheels, much like the AX. Further up the list sunroofs, PAS, Electric windows, ultrasonic <b>alarm,</b> <b>passenger</b> airbag, CD player, tachometer, front fog lights, bodykits, colour-coded mirror caps and alloy wheels were added, to name a few. Although MK2 Saxos were generally better equipped than their older counterparts, the interiors were still dated in comparison to other small hatchbacks of the time, such as the Vauxhall Corsa, with many of the center console controls originating from the older Citroën AX model.|$|R
5000|$|Dowd grew {{concerned}} when Osbon made comments such as [...] "We {{need to take}} a leap of faith", [...] "We're not going to Vegas", and [...] "I can't be held responsible when this plane crashes." [...] Osbon began giving what the first officer described as a sermon. Dowd tricked Osbon into going to the passenger compartment, then locked the cockpit door and changed the security code. Osbon railed at passengers about Jesus, Al-Qaeda, countries in the Middle East, and a possible bomb on board. <b>Alarmed</b> <b>passengers</b> tackled him and tied him up with seat belt extenders. An off duty JetBlue pilot who was travelling as a passenger joined Dowd in the cockpit and the plane landed about 20 minutes later. Osbon {{was arrested and charged with}} [...] "interference with a flight crew." ...|$|R
500|$|On 26 May 2015, EVA Air flight BR12 (Boeing 777-300ER B-16718, Delivered May 2014) from Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport to Los Angeles landed safely at Los Angeles International Airport at 15:40 (3:40 pm). It {{departed}} from Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport at 18:57 (6:57 pm) Taiwan time with 305 passengers, 3 pilots and 15 flight attendants on board. Approximately 20 {{minutes before the}} flight landed, the FAA received a telephone call that the flight {{was the target of}} a security threat. As soon as the aircraft landed, authorities took it to a secure area in a cargo bay. FBI agents, the Los Angeles Police Bomb Squad and other officials continued their investigation. After a thorough investigation, the FBI, Los Angeles Police Department Bomb Squad and airport officials have confirmed that the security threat against EVA Air BR12 flight from Taipei to Los Angeles was a false <b>alarm.</b> <b>Passengers</b> began getting off of the aircraft for security screenings at 17:15 (5:15 pm PDT) and, now, authorities have ...|$|R
50|$|Curtis built ships at Medford, and later, after 1852, at East Boston, {{except for}} the {{occasional}} ship that he built elsewhere like the extreme clipper Witchcraft that he built at Chelsea, Massachusetts in 1850 with Mr. Taylor, and the Golden Fleece that he built in Boston in 1852. Also after 1852 he still occasionally built a ship in the shipyards at Medford. To illustrate {{the quality of his}} work a lady related this experience:She was returning from Europe with husband and family on the ship John Elliot Thayer. They encountered an unusually severe gale lasting three days, with constantly increasing violence. The <b>passengers</b> became so <b>alarmed</b> that the captain was appealed to for assurances of safety. While he admitted the storm to be the worst he had ever known, he called the ladies to the cabin and asked them to notice the builder's name in golden letters on the white enamelled panel. They read this: ‘Paul Curtis, builder.’ He assured them that no ship of Curtis’s had ever foundered,—no ships had so high a record for low insurance rates,—no timber or bolt was introduced unless free from all defect. ‘I assure you, ladies,’ he said, ‘I think she will ride this terrible storm safely.’ The ship came safely through the storm.|$|R

The aircraft was initially scheduled to operate as EVA flight BR11 scheduled to depart from Los Angeles to Taipei at 17:15 (5:15 pm PDT). EVA used another from a later flight to use on flight BR11 due to the time needed for thorough security checks. EVA BR11 was delayed by 2 hours 15 minutes and took off at 19:30 (7:30 pm PDT) with 298 passengers on board.|$|R
