2500|$|In the 3rd century BCE, the Greek {{mathematician}} Archimedes of Syracuse ( [...] (287–212 BCE)– {{generally considered}} to be the greatest mathematician of antiquity and one of the greatest of all time– laid the foundations of hydrostatics, statics and calculated the underlying mathematics of the lever. A leading scientist of classical antiquity, Archimedes also developed elaborate systems of pulleys to move large objects with a minimum of effort. The Archimedes' screw underpins modern hydroengineering, and his machines of war helped to hold back the armies of Rome in the First Punic War. Archimedes even tore apart the arguments of Aristotle and his metaphysics, pointing out {{that it was impossible to}} separate mathematics and nature and proved it by converting mathematical theories into practical inventions. Furthermore, in his work On Floating Bodies, around 250 BCE, Archimedes developed the law of buoyancy, also known as Archimedes' principle. In mathematics, Archimedes used the method of exhaustion to calculate the area under the arc of a parabola with the summation of an infinite series, and gave a remarkably accurate approximation of pi. He also defined the spiral bearing his name, formulae for the volumes of surfaces of revolution and an ingenious system for expressing very large numbers. He also developed the <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>equilibrium</b> states and centers of gravity, ideas that would influence the well known scholars, Galileo, and Newton.|$|E
2500|$|The French {{mathematician}} Lazare Carnot {{proposed in}} his 1803 paper Fundamental <b>Principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>Equilibrium</b> and Movement {{that in any}} machine the accelerations and shocks of the moving parts represent losses of moment of activity. In other words, in any natural process there exists an inherent tendency towards the dissipation of useful energy. Building on this work, in 1824 Lazare's son Sadi Carnot published Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire which posited that in all heat-engines, whenever [...] "caloric" [...] (what {{is now known as}} heat) falls through a temperature difference, work or motive power can be produced from the actions of its fall from a hot to cold body. He made the analogy with that of how water falls in a water wheel. This was an early insight into the second law of thermodynamics. Carnot based his views of heat partially on the early 18th century [...] "Newtonian hypothesis" [...] that both heat and light were types of indestructible forms of matter, which are attracted and repelled by other matter, and partially on the contemporary views of Count Rumford who showed (1789) that heat could be created by friction as when cannon bores are machined. Carnot reasoned that if the body of the working substance, such as a body of steam, is returned to its original state {{at the end of a}} complete engine cycle, that [...] "no change occurs in the condition of the working body".|$|E

6000|$|D'Alembert was {{the natural}} son of Madame de Tencin, by {{whom he had}} been barbarously exposed {{immediately}} after his birth. [...] "The true ancestors of a man of genius," [...] says Condorcet finely upon this circumstance, [...] "are the masters who have gone before him, and his true descendants are disciples that are worthy of him." [...] He was discovered on a November night in the year 1717, by the beadle, in a nearly dying condition {{on the steps of}} the church of St. John the Round, from which he afterwards took his Christian name. An honest woman of the common people, with that personal devotion which is less rare among the poor than among the rich, took charge of the foundling. The father, who was an officer of artillery and brother of Destouches, the author of some poor comedies, by and by advanced the small sums required to pay for the boy's schooling. D'Alembert proved a brilliant student. Unlike nearly every other member of the encyclopædic party, he was a pupil not of the Jesuits but of their rivals. The Jansenists recognised the keenness and force of their pupil, and hoped that they had discovered a new Pascal. But he was less docile than his great predecessor in their ranks. When his studies were completed, he devoted himself to geometry, for which he had a passion that nothing could extinguish. For the old monastic vow of poverty, chastity, and obedience, he adopted the manlier substitute of poverty, truth, and liberty--the worthy device of every man of letters. When he awoke in the morning, he thought with delight of the work that had been begun the previous day and would occupy the day before him. In the necessary intervals of his meditations, he recalled the lively pleasure that he felt at the play: at the play between the acts, he thought of the still greater pleasure that was promised to him by the work of the morrow. His mathematical labours led to valuable results in the <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>equilibrium</b> and the movement of fluids, in a new calculus, and in a new solution of the problem of the precession of the equinoxes.[99] ...|$|E

Timing without observability affects both bargaining and coordination, but only weakly.

50|$|In 2014 {{a concept}} of hybrid scale has been introduced, the elastically {{deformable}} arm scale, which is a combination between a spring scale and a beam balance, exploiting simultaneously both <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>equilibrium</b> and deformation. In this scale, the rigid arms of a classical beam balance (for example a steelyard) are replaced with a flexible elastic rod in an inclined frictionless sliding sleeve. The rod can reach a unique free of sliding equilibrium when two vertical dead loads (or masses) are applied at its edges. Equilibrium, which would be impossible with rigid arms, is guaranteed because configurational forces develop at the two edges of the sleeve {{as a consequence of}} both the free sliding condition and the nonlinear kinematics of the elastic rod. This weight measuring device can also work without a counterweight.|$|E
50|$|In 1803, {{mathematician}} Lazare Carnot {{published a}} work entitled Fundamental <b>Principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>Equilibrium</b> and Movement.

Lazare Carnot saw through {{all the details of}} the mechanisms to develop a general discussion on the conservation of mechanical energy. Over the next three decades, Lazare Carnot's theorem was taken as a statement that in any machine the accelerations and shocks of the moving parts all represent losses of moment of activity, i.e. the useful work done. From this Lazare drew the inference that perpetual motion was impossible. This loss of moment of activity was the first-ever rudimentary statement of the second law of thermodynamics and the concept of 'transformation-energy' or entropy, i.e. energy lost to dissipation and friction.|$|E

50|$|Due to the {{fundamental}} nature of fluids, a fluid cannot remain at rest under {{the presence of a}} shear stress. However, fluids can exert pressure normal to any contacting surface. If a point in the fluid is thought of as an infinitesimally small cube, then it follows from the <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>equilibrium</b> that the pressure on every side of this unit of fluid must be equal. If this were not the case, the fluid would move {{in the direction of the}} resulting force. Thus, the pressure on a fluid at rest is isotropic; i.e., it acts with equal magnitude in all directions. This characteristic allows fluids to transmit force through the length of pipes or tubes; i.e., a force applied to a fluid in a pipe is transmitted, via the fluid, to the other end of the pipe. This principle was first formulated, in a slightly extended form, by Blaise Pascal, and is now called Pascal's law.|$|E
5000|$|Pareto {{was born}} of an exiled noble Genoese family in 1848 in Paris, {{the centre of the}} popular {{revolutions}} of that year. His father, Raffaele Pareto (1812-1882), was an Italian civil engineer and Ligurian marquis who had left Italy much like Giuseppe Mazzini and other Italian nationalists. His mother, Marie Metenier, was a French woman. Enthusiastic about the 1848 German revolution, his parents named him Fritz Wilfried, which became Vilfredo Federico upon his family's move back to Italy in 1858. In his childhood, Pareto lived in a middle-class environment, receiving a high standard of education, attending the new created Istituto Tecnico Leardi where Fernando Pio Rosellini was his mathematics professor. In 1869, he earned a doctor's degree in engineering from what is now the Polytechnic University of Turin (then the Technical School for Engineers).
