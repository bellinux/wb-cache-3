5|$|Chitinozoa (singular: chitinozoan, plural: chitinozoans) are a taxon of flask-shaped, organic walled marine microfossils {{produced}} by an as yet unknown animal. Common from the Ordovician to Devonian periods (i.e. the mid-Paleozoic), the millimetre-scale organisms are abundant {{in almost all}} types of marine sediment across the globe.

5000|$|Ge Hong's (c. 320 CE) Daoist classic Baopuzi {{contains}} {{some of the}} earliest and most detailed descriptions <b>of</b> the <b>Paces</b> <b>of</b> Yu, in which [...] "each pace comprises three steps, and the movement thus appears like the waddle of a three-legged creature" [...] (Andersen 2008:237). The three <b>paces</b> <b>of</b> Yubu were associated with the performer's movement through the three levels of the cosmos, the Santai 三台 [...] "Three Steps; stars within Ursa Major" [...] (ι UMa through 61 UMa) in Chinese astronomy, and the Three Steps of Vishnu across earth, air, and heaven in the Rigveda.The fact that already in the early Han dynasty, the steps seem to have been connected with the three pairs of stars that are situated under the Northern Dipper and referred to as the Three Steps (santai 三台), or the Celestial Staircase (tianjie 天階), would seem to support this. It would appear, in other words, that even in this early period the <b>Paces</b> <b>of</b> Yu constituted a close parallel to the three Strides Viṣṇu in early Vedic mythology, which are thought to have taken the god through the three levels of the cosmos (thereby establishing the universe), and which indeed, just like the <b>Paces</b> <b>of</b> Yu in Taoist ritual, are known to have been imitated by Vedic priests as they approached the altar—and in the same form as the <b>Paces</b> <b>of</b> Yu, that is, dragging one foot after the other.

Phinney took fifth place in the stage 10 individual time trial, {{a minute and a half}} off the <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> the day's winner Tony Martin. Frank rode to fourth from a breakaway in the next stage, again a minute and a half off the <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> the day's winner, this time David Moncoutié. All the team had to show for itself from the second half of the Vuelta was a seventh place from Van Avermaet in the field sprint finish to stage 12. Six BMC riders reached the Vuelta's finish, with Van Avermaet in 83rd place being their highest overall finisher.|$|E
