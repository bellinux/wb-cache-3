For one thing, {{there was very}} little consistency in the <b>organisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>Switzerland</b> at the federal level at this time, and for another the organisation was hindered by political and confessional arguments. Also, Switzerland's neutrality and the existence of the International Committee of the Red Cross as an institution in Swiss civil-society posed further difficulties.|$|R
25|$|Advances in {{experimental}} and theoretical {{studies have shown}} that folding can be viewed in terms of energy landscapes, where folding kinetics is considered as a <b>progressive</b> <b>organisation</b> <b>of</b> an ensemble of partially folded structures through which a protein passes {{on its way to the}} folded structure. This has been described in terms of a folding funnel, in which an unfolded protein has a large number of conformational states available and there are fewer states available to the folded protein. A funnel implies that for protein folding there is a decrease in energy and loss of entropy with increasing tertiary structure formation. The local roughness of the funnel reflects kinetic traps, corresponding to the accumulation of misfolded intermediates. A folding chain progresses toward lower intra-chain free-energies by increasing its compactness. The chain's conformational options become increasingly narrowed ultimately toward one native structure.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} evaluation outcomes from an externally funded {{research project}} involving the online clinical assessment of practical skills (eCAPS) using web-based video technologies within a university medical programme. eCAPS was implemented to trial this web-based approach for promoting {{the efficacy of}} practical skills assessment in knee joint examinations for a pre-clinical cohort of second year medical students. eCAPS involves a <b>progressive</b> <b>organisation</b> <b>of</b> online video experiences and task expectations for formative and summative assessments of selected competencies. Data are presented from semi-structured interviews with the medical students (N= 40). eCAPS successfully supported students 2 ̆ 7 skill development in knee joint examinations on fellow students and allowed remote assessment of candidates 2 ̆ 7 performances by clinicians experienced in musculoskeletal examinations. An indicative standard 2 ̆ 7 paradigm, involving formative assessment of one randomly selected performance from the submission of all students 2 ̆ 7 responses within a small group, offered an efficient and efficacious avenue for providing consolidated feedback to students and promoted desirable learning behaviours. Overall, there was evidence of reciprocal learning benefits to the blending 2 ̆ 7 of an online learning and assessment approach with an existing face-to-face environment. The medical {{students were able to}} successfully engage online with high quality and consistent practical skill-based materials in a flexible, independent and individual manner...|$|R
40|$|According to {{landscape}} theory proteins do not fold by localised pathways, {{but find}} their native conformation by a <b>progressive</b> <b>organisation</b> <b>of</b> an ensemble of partly folded structures down a folding funnel. Here, we use kinetics and protein engineering {{to investigate the}} shape of the free-energy profile for two-state folding, which is the macroscopic view of the funnel process for small and rapidly folding proteins. Our experiments are based mainly on structural changes of the transition state of chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 (CI 2) upon destabilisation with temperature and GdnHCl. The transition state ensemble of CI 2 is a localised feature in the free-energy profile that is sharply higher than the other parts of the activation barrier. The relatively fixed position of the CI 2 transition state on the reaction coordinate makes it easy to characterise but contributes also to overshadow the rest of the free-energy profile, the shape of which is inaccessible for analysis. Results from mutants of CI 2 and comparison with other two-state proteins, however, point at the possibility that the barrier for folding is generally broad and that localised transition states result from minor ripples in the free-energy profile. Accordingly, variabilities in the folding kinetics may not indicate different folding mechanisms, but could be accounted for by various degrees of ruggedness on top of very broad activation barriers for folding. The concept is attractive since it summarises a wide range of folding data which have previously seemed unrelated. It is also supported by theory. Consistent with experiment, broad barriers predict that new transition state ensembles are exposed upon extreme destabilisation or radical mutations...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to assess the {{importance}} <b>of</b> <b>Switzerland</b> in the life and writings of Edward Gibbon. Whereas the choice of Lausanne as a place of exile for Gibbon to undo his youthful conversion to Roman Catholicism was largely accidental, the society and intellectual resources of that city, perched on its hills overlooking the shores of Lake Geneva, proved to be of lasting influence for the rest of his life. During his period of exile, he began to write in French his first work to be published, the Essai sur lâÃ©tude de la littÃ©rature, and the subject <b>of</b> <b>Switzerland</b> was his preferred choice of research until his Grand Tour, in which he renewed his residence in Lausanne for a further eleven months, stimulated the idea of writing a history of Rome. Eventually he decided to retire to Lausanne at the end of his parliamentary career to finish the last three volumes of The Decline and fall of the Roman Empire. Brian Norman shows that the liberalism of Gibbonâs political philosophy in his criticism of Lausanneâs subjection to the aristocratic rule of Berne surprised the patriots of the new canton of Vaud when his Letter on the Government of Berne, which is here established as a youthful work of the late 1750 s, was posthumously published at the end of the eighteenth century. The author then proceeds to examine Gibbonâs other early writings relating to Switzerland, his letters and journals, The Decline and fall of the Roman Empire and his Memoirs in order to show the abiding effect of the society, language, history, constitution and military <b>organisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>Switzerland</b> on his beliefs and assumptions.

60|$|By {{keeping this}} {{question}} {{before the public}} for some thirty years, Lyell, though the keenest and most formidable of the opponents of the transmutation theory, as it was formulated by Lamarck, was of the greatest possible service in facilitating the reception of the sounder doctrines of a later day.

40|$|This thesis summarises {{research}} {{focused on}} the requisites required to implement improvement initiatives successfully. Processes used to enhance supply chain performance initiatives are examined. The core hypothesis is that a preconditioning programme provides support for <b>progressive</b> <b>organisations,</b> irrespective <b>of</b> size or position in the supply chain. An interpretation matrix developed {{as a result of}} action research with M E Ltd was tested with NP Ltd and its suppliers. During search conferences the matrix was found to add value by serving as a common platform to record then compare observations and agree a common understanding between participants. Based on qualitative descriptions of training and learning in organisations from the 1950 s to the 1970 s, Barrington's model has three levels: 'systematic approach' predominating in the 1950 s, 'appraisal approach' developed extensively in the 1960 s and an 'attitude to continuous improvement' that was promoted after the 1970 s fuel crises. This model was used as the basis for selecting collaborating establishments. The literature review concludes that conventional supplier development has the attributes of the systematic approach, which is considered the least effective level. M E Ltd was considering introducing appraisal, had few attributes of the systematic approach, and had an attitude for continuous improvement. A company specific survey was undertaken that led to a series of remedial actions which were identified as a preconditioning programme prior to supplier development. NP Ltd selected leaders by attitude, had institutionalised appraisals and once the core group was established, trained employees with systematic techniques. AAP Ltd had the attitude and systematic techniques, yet did not have appraisal systems. Principal conclusions of this are: · These case studies suggest companies can have any two of Barrington's levels. As a result, an alternate depiction of Barrington’s model is suggested. · The cases indicate that preconditioning can occur within a company, from customer to suppliers and from suppliers to customer. · The cases suggest product development roadmap stability as a root cause for negative effects to the relationship between customer and supplier...|$|R
