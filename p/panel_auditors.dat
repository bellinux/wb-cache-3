40|$|The Leveson Report on the Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press {{proposed}} a system {{under which the}} independence and effectiveness of a self-regulator {{set up by the}} press could be assured through a process of independent “audit” or “recognition”. The Royal Charter on Self-Regulation of the Press establishes an independent Recognition Panel, which does not regulate the press, but decides whether a self-regulator meets pre-set criteria for regulatory independence and effectiveness. The Recognition Panel is independently appointed and protected from political interference by the terms of the Royal Charter and by a statutory requirement that a two-thirds majority of both Houses of Parliament is required to amend that Charter. There is a “double lock” on political interference with the recognition system. Under the system proposed by Leveson the press remains in operational control of its own regulation and politicians are excluded from any role in the process. The Recognition <b>Panel</b> is an <b>auditor,</b> not a regulator...|$|R
