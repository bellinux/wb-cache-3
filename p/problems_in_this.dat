When one attempts to solve <b>problems</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> class, it makes no difference whether ZF or ZFC is employed if the only question is the existence of a proof.

One area of research on this topic involves [...] "doctor-centered" [...] or [...] "patient-centered" [...] consultations. Doctor-centered consultations are generally directive, with the patient answering questions and playing less of a role in decision-making. Although this style is preferred by elderly people and others, many people dislike the sense of hierarchy or ignorance that it inspires. They prefer patient-centered consultations, which focus on the patient's needs, involve the doctor listening to the patient completely before making a decision, and involving the patient in {{the process of}} choosing treatment and finding a diagnosis.|$|E
2500|$|In {{mathematical}} psychology, antimatroids {{have been}} used to describe feasible states of knowledge of a human learner. Each element of the antimatroid represents a concept that is to be understood by the learner, or a class of problems that he or {{she might be able to}} solve correctly, and the sets of elements that form the antimatroid represent possible sets of concepts that could be understood by a single person. The axioms defining an antimatroid may be phrased informally as stating that learning one concept can never prevent the learner from learning another concept, and that any feasible state of knowledge can be reached by learning a single concept at a time. The task of a knowledge assessment system is to infer the set of concepts known by a given learner by analyzing his or her responses to a small and well-chosen set of <b>problems.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> context antimatroids have also been called [...] "learning spaces" [...] and [...] "well-graded knowledge spaces".|$|E
2500|$|One {{motivation}} for equitable coloring suggested by [...] concerns scheduling <b>problems.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> application, the vertices of a graph represent {{a collection of}} tasks to be performed, and an edge connects two tasks {{that should not be}} performed at the same time. A coloring of this graph represents a partition of the tasks into subsets that may be performed simultaneously; thus, the number of colors in the coloring corresponds to the number of time steps required to perform the entire task. Due to load balancing considerations, it is desirable to perform equal or nearly-equal numbers of tasks in each time step, and this balancing is exactly what an equitable coloring achieves. [...] mentions a specific application of this type of scheduling problem, assigning university courses to time slots in a way that spreads the courses evenly among the available time slots and avoids scheduling incompatible pairs of courses {{at the same time as}} each other.|$|E

2500|$|In the past, {{physicians}} have traditionally hand-written or verbally communicated orders for patient care, {{which are then}} transcribed by various individuals (such as unit clerks, nurses, and ancillary staff) before being carried out. [...] Handwritten reports or notes, manual order entry, non-standard abbreviations and poor legibility lead to errors and injuries to patients, [...] A follow up IOM report in 2001 advised use of electronic medication ordering, with computer- and internet-based information systems to support clinical decisions. Prescribing errors are the largest identified source of preventable hospital medical error. A 2006 report by the Institute of Medicine estimated that a hospitalized patient is exposed to a medication error each day {{of his or her}} stay. While further studies have estimated that CPOE implementation at all nonrural hospitals in the United States could prevent over 500,000 serious medication errors each year. Studies of computerized physician order entry (CPOE) has yielded evidence that suggests the medication error rate can be reduced by 80%, and errors that have potential for serious harm or death for patients can be reduced by 55%, and other studies have also suggested benefits. Further, in 2005, CMS and CDC released a report that showed only 41 percent of prophylactic antibacterials were correctly stopped within 24 hours of completed surgery. The researchers conducted an analysis over an eight-month period, implementing a CPOE system designed to stop the administration of prophylactic antibacterials. Results showed CPOE significantly improved timely discontinuation of antibacterials from 38.8 percent of surgeries to 55.7 percent in the intervention hospital. CPOE/e-Prescribing systems can provide automatic dosing alerts (for example, letting the user know that the dose is too high and thus dangerous) and interaction checking (for example, telling the user that 2 medicines ordered taken together can cause health <b>problems).</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> way, specialists in pharmacy informatics work with the medical and nursing staffs at hospitals to improve the safety and effectiveness of medication use by utilizing CPOE systems.|$|E
6000|$|From the {{instances}} already cited it {{is apparent}} that Browning's interest centered, not in abstract or theoretical discussions of human problems, but in the individuals who face the <b>problems.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> point Browning is sharply distinguished from his poetic contemporaries as a class. They felt deeply [...] "all the weary weight of this unintelligible world," [...] so deeply that while they gave much thought to ideals of social amelioration, few of them presented individuals with any dramatic distinctness. Browning stands practically by himself in the nineteenth century as the poet who gives us both the [...] "doubter and the doubt," [...] who is able to join with an impressive statement of the hopes and fears of man, an equally impressive sequence of individual men and women. In this he harks back to the broad inclusiveness of the Elizabethan dramatists. In contemporary literature, his nearest congeners are in fiction, not in poetry.|$|E
