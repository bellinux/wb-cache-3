The legend {{explained}} the later walling up of the gate as a Turkish precaution against this prophecy.|$|E

LeMond received intense criticism in 2001 when he publicly expressed doubts about the legitimacy of Lance Armstrong's Tour success after learning {{of his relationship with}} Dr. Michele Ferrari.

5|$|After Roger's birth, James and Henriette {{had three}} more children: two daughters {{who died in}} infancy and a second son, Alfred, born in 1839. The {{marriage}} was unhappy, and the couple spent much time apart, he in England, she in Paris with Roger. As a consequence of his upbringing, Roger spoke mainly French, and his English was heavily accented. In 1845 James decided that Roger should complete his education in England and <b>placed</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> the Jesuit boarding school Stonyhurst College, where he remained until 1848. In 1849 he sat the British army entrance examinations and then took a commission in the 6th Dragoon Guards, in which he served for three years, mainly in Ireland.|$|E
5|$|Chad was {{represented}} by one male athlete at the 2016 Games in athletics – Bachir Mahamat in the 400 metres. Mahamat competed on 12 August in the second heat. He placed seventh, {{with a time of}} 48.59 seconds, some 3.44 seconds behind the winner, Bralon Taplin of Grenada. The only runner he placed ahead of in his heat was Anas Beshr of Egypt, who had been disqualified for exiting his lane on the track. Only the first three athletes from each heat progressed to the next round, and so Mahamat's Olympics ended after that single run. His time <b>placed</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> 48th place out of 50 athletes overall, based on times in the first round.|$|E

5|$|In Greek mythology, Auriga {{is often}} {{identified}} as the mythological Greek hero Erichthonius of Athens, the chthonic son of Hephaestus who was raised by the goddess Athena. Erichthonius was generally credited to be {{the inventor of the}} quadriga, the four-horse chariot, which he used in the battle against the usurper Amphictyon, the event that made Erichthonius the king of Athens. His chariot was created {{in the image of the}} Sun's chariot, the reason Zeus <b>placed</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> the heavens. The Athenian hero then dedicated himself to Athena and, soon after, Zeus raised him into the night sky in honor of his ingenuity and heroic deeds.|$|E
5|$|In Halifax he {{was sent}} to Wellington Barracks, the city's peacetime barracks, where he {{wrestled}} freight onto large army vehicles and dug ditches. Tired of the work, Babcock took the opportunity to volunteer for the Royal Canadian Regiment when fifty recruits were called on, claiming that his age was 18. Officials quickly discovered that he was only 16, however, and they <b>placed</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> a reserve battalion known as the Boys (or Young Soldiers) Battalion in August 1917. Babcock then undertook an ocean voyage to England and, in Liverpool, he was stationed with the 26th Reserve and sent to Bexhill-on-Sea where he trained with about 1,300 others, about a third of whom were veterans from battles in France.|$|E
5|$|Iwata's {{proficiency}} with programming quickly <b>placed</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> high esteem among fellow programmers and gamers alike. He {{would often}} {{continue to work}} on weekends and holidays because of his passion. With the company on the verge of bankruptcy, Iwata was promoted to president of HAL in 1993 at the insistence of Nintendo's then-President, Hiroshi Yamauchi. With assistance from Nintendo, Iwata helped turn the company around from its ¥1.5billion debt and stabilize its finances within six years. Lacking experience in management, Iwata put a lot of effort into learning how to better himself, often reading books on the topic and seeking advice from others.|$|E

5|$|The coffin match, {{in which}} The Undertaker faced Kamala, came next. Kamala began the match by running in fear from The Undertaker. He gained the early advantage, however, by {{suddenly}} {{turning around and}} attacking The Undertaker. Kamala bodyslammed The Undertaker three times and performed three splashes. In an attempt to revive The Undertaker, Paul Bearer, his manager, held up an urn that {{was said to be}} the source of The Undertaker's power. Kim Chee, one of Kamala's handler's attacked Bearer. The Undertaker picked up the urn, which had rolled into the ring, and hit Kamala with it. The Undertaker pinned Kamala to win the match, <b>placed</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> a coffin, and nailed the lid shut.|$|E
5|$|The {{first case}} against Acton, before Mr. Baron Carter, {{was for the}} murder in 1726 of Thomas Bliss, a {{carpenter}} and debtor. Unable to pay the prison fees, Bliss had been left with so little to eat that {{he had tried to}} escape by throwing a rope over the wall, but his pursuers severed it and he fell 20feet into the prison yard. Wanting to know who had supplied the rope, Acton beat him with a bull's pizzle, stamped on his stomach, <b>placed</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> the hole (a damp space under the stairs), then in the strong room.|$|E

5|$|With {{the peace}} treaty concluded, Macrinus took {{measures}} to control the expenditures of Rome, by reversing Caracalla's changes and thus effectively reinstating the fiscal policies of Septimius Severus. This included a reduction in pay and benefits for Legionnaires, which was not popular with the Army who had <b>placed</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> command. These policies applied only to new recruits, but the enlisted soldiers saw this as setting precedent for further changes to the fiscal policies brought in by Caracalla. The sullen behaviour of new recruits, who entered service committing to greater labour for less payment, only furthered discontent among the soldiers. Gibbon suggests that from here only a small spark was required to ignite a rebellion.|$|E
5|$|Æthelbert, was {{the teacher}} and {{intimate}} friend of Alcuin, whose poem on the saints and prelates of the Church of York, Versus de Patribus Regibus et de Sanctis et Pontificibus Ecclesiæ Eboracensis, is the principal source of information concerning Æthelbert's life. He was a kinsman of his predecessor Ecgbert, who was brother to Eadberht, King of Northumbria. Æthelbert's family <b>placed</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> a monastery as a young child, {{where he was a}} pupil in the school founded at York by Ecgbert. Ecgbert ordained Æthelbert as a priest put him in charge of the school.|$|E
5|$|A special {{group was}} {{established}} under Teller in March 1944 {{to investigate the}} mathematics of an implosion-type nuclear weapon. It too ran into difficulties. Because of {{his interest in the}} Super, Teller did not work as hard on the implosion calculations as Bethe wanted. These too were originally low-priority tasks, but the discovery of spontaneous fission in plutonium by Emilio Segrè's group gave the Super increased importance. In June 1944, at Bethe's request, Oppenheimer moved Teller out of T Division, and <b>placed</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> charge of a special group responsible for the Super, reporting directly to Oppenheimer. He was replaced by Rudolf Peierls from the British Mission, who in turn brought in Klaus Fuchs, who was later revealed to be a Soviet spy. Teller's Super group became part of Fermi's F Division when he joined the Los Alamos Laboratory in September 1944. It included Stanislaw Ulam, Jane Roberg, Geoffrey Chew, Harold and Mary Argo, and Maria Goeppert-Mayer.|$|E

While he pre-dates Buddha, it is unclear which century he lived in, with some suggesting 6th-century BCE. Others <b>place</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> the 7th century BCE. This <b>places</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> the late Vedic period (1500 BCE to 500 BCE), and he has been called a Vedic sage.|$|R
