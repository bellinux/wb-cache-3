5|$|The {{cover was}} created by graphic artist Margo Nahas. It was not {{specifically}} commissioned; Nahas {{had been asked to}} create a cover that featured four chrome women dancing, but declined due to the creative difficulties. Her husband brought her portfolio to the band anyway, and from that material they chose the painting of a <b>putto</b> stealing cigarettes that was used. The model was Carter Helm, who was the child of one of Nahas' best friends, whom she photographed holding a candy cigarette.|$|E
5|$|On {{the five}} pendentives along each {{side and the}} two at either end, Michelangelo painted the largest figures on the ceiling: twelve people who prophesied or {{represented}} {{some aspect of the}} Coming of Christ. Of those twelve, seven were Prophets of Israel and were male. The remaining five were prophets of the Classical World, called Sibyls and were female. The prophet Jonah is placed above the altar and Zechariah at the further end. The other male and female figures alternate down each side, each being identified by an inscription on a painted marble panel supported by a <b>putto.</b>|$|E
5|$|The balcony is {{topped by}} a niche {{consisting}} of allegorical figures of Justice and Truth, as well as triumphal sculptures of a winged female figure and a <b>putto.</b> Some parts of the sculptures, such as the scales held by Lady Justice, are now missing. The empty spaces between these figures contained Pinto's bust and coat of arms, but they were removed during the French occupation of Malta or in the early 19th century. It is not known how the bust of Pinto looked like, however {{it may have been}} either sculpted similar to the bust on the façade of Auberge de Castille or an original work. In either case it was probably made of bronze, and stood on a marble plinth which is still there. Similar to other busts of the time, {{it may have been the}} work of Jacques Saly. The triumphal figures are similar to those found on the 17th century funerary monument of Nicolas Cotoner sculpted by Domenico Guidi, but it is unknown who worked on the replica of the Castellania.|$|E
50|$|<b>Puttos</b> and sirens stucco reliefs {{are mounted}} on the facade.|$|R
50|$|On the left, two <b>puttoes</b> {{are playing}} with Pegasus, Perseus' winged horse.|$|R
50|$|Perseverance shows {{a virtuous}} warrior to whom Bacchus is {{offering}} fruit from a wagon pulled by <b>puttoes.</b> It {{has been described}} also as an allegory of lust. The Fortune, or Inconstancy, shows a woman on an unstable boat, surrounded by <b>puttoes,</b> holding a sphere. The Prudence depicts a naked woman pointing out a mirror; it has been differently interpreted as Vanity also.|$|R
25|$|Cherubim {{have become}} erroneously {{associated}} with the <b>putto</b> and the Greco-Roman god Cupid/Eros, resulting in the misconception that cherubim are small and plump winged boys.|$|E
25|$|A chancel memorial—in {{the shape}} of a tombstone, with <b>putto</b> head, scrolling, and foliate devices below a pediment—is that to Edmund Weaver of Frieston (1683–1748), the astronomer, local land surveyor, and author of The British Telescope ephemerides.|$|E
25|$|The {{third floor}} balcony is reached through French doors (framed with slit windows) as well. It {{features}} a low balustrade of turned granite interrupted by pedestals, which {{are decorated with}} variegated marble panels. The placement of the pedestals mimics the pillars and pilasters below. The two bay windows {{on either side of}} the balcony feature the same torches, swag, putti, panels, and molding similar to the rest of the third floor. Above the French doors is a large oval estucheon with fruit-and-drapery swag which mimics the estucheon over the doors to the loggia. A standing <b>putto</b> over each slit window supports the swag.|$|E
50|$|The painted {{decoration}} {{consists of}} a series of panels with allegorical representations, <b>puttos,</b> flowers, vegetable motifs and arabesques. At the centre is the bust of Cosimo II de' Medici.|$|R
5|$|The {{cover was}} censored in the UK {{at the time}} of the album's release. It {{featured}} a sticker that obscured the cigarette in the <b>putto's</b> hand and the pack of cigarettes.|$|R
50|$|The {{exhibition}} includes {{among many}} other artworks the famous gothic Morris dancers, created by Erasmus Grasser for the festival hall of the Old Town Hall, and the original <b>puttos</b> of the Mary's Column.|$|R
25|$|Originally {{the project}} was {{designed}} by Giacomo della Porta, then by Cortona; but ultimately Pozzo won a public contest to design the altar. A canvas of the Saint receives the monogram {{with the name of}} Jesus from the celestial resurrected Christ attributed to Pozzo. The urn of St. Ignatius is a bronze urn by Algardi that holds the body of the saint; below are two groups of statues where Religion defeats heresy by Legros (with a <b>putto</b> - on the left side - tearing pages from heretical books by Luther, Calvin and Zwingli), and Faith defeats idolatry by Jean-Baptiste Théodon.|$|E
25|$|Different sources give {{conflicting}} {{information as to}} the physical appearance of cherubim. An early, traditional Jewish notion supposes that cherubim had youthful, human features (although some early midrashic literature conceives of the cherubim as non-corporeal). In the Book of Ezekiel and (at least some) Christian icons, the cherub is depicted as having a number of wing pairs, and four faces: that of a lion (representative of all wild animals), an ox (domestic animals), a human (humanity), and an eagle (birds). Their legs were straight, the soles of their feet like the hooves of a bull, gleaming like polished brass. In Western Christian tradition, cherubim have become associated with the <b>putto</b> and the Greco-Roman deity Cupid/Eros, resulting in the misconception that cherubim are small and plump winged boys.|$|E
25|$|The {{first floor}} {{exterior}} wall consists of limestone quoins {{at the corner}} and stone coursing. A string course with Greek decorative carving is set {{between the first and}} second floors, and acts as the window sill for the second floor windows and as the balustrade for the entrance loggia. The second and third floor exterior walls have stone quoins as well. Between each window on the second floor is a panel inlaid with variegated marble and surrounded by egg-and-dart moldings. The base of the panel is decorated with scrollwork, and the top by a bas-relief urn. Five fruit-shaped clusters decorate the outside frame of the furthermost window on this floor (the lowest cluster supported by a tiny <b>putto),</b> while above each window is a false pediment topped by an escutcheon flanked by drapery. Variegated marble panels are set between each window on the third floor as well, the bottom of each decorated with scrollwork and a small dramatic mask. The sill of each third floor window is of scrollwork, while the window is topped by scrollwork and a torch. Circular medallions with pendants decorate the outside frame of the furthermost window on the third floor. A bas-relief <b>putto</b> stands atop each medallion and panel, supporting fruit swags. Between the third and fourth (or attic) floors is a molding decorated with repetitive small eggs which serves as the sill for the fourth floor windows. The truncated hipped roof slightly overhangs the walls. The cornice is decorated with dentils and acanthus carvings beneath the roofline. The roof, originally red tile, was changed at some point to asbestos roof shingles with copper flashing. There are seven chimneys on the roof, and about five skylights on the flat section.|$|E
50|$|Ducal Palace (15th century)- Commissioned by Alessandro Sforza, the façade has a portico {{with six}} arcades {{supported}} by six heavy pilasters and an upper floor with five windows crowned by coats of arms, festoons and <b>puttoes.</b>|$|R
5000|$|N°17 {{breaks the}} symmetry, with thicker bossage {{lines on the}} ground level {{and the absence of}} {{architectural}} details present at N°13 and 15. Still noticeable is the main gate with a transom light, flanked by pilasters topped by floral and <b>puttoes</b> motif. Tenement at N°19, corner with Śniadecki Street ...|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} {{is on the}} Latin cross plan, with a nave and two aisles covered with cross vaults, and a dome at the crossing. The structure {{is similar to the}} nearby cathedral's. The grooved piers are Renaissance elements of classical inspiration. In the nave is a frieze by Correggio and his workshop (c. 1522-1524). Is ia long strip with monochrome paintings (with few red details) on a dark blue background, including also some tondoes with portraits of Benedictine popes, cardinals and monks. The main feature is a series of <b>puttos</b> in actions symbolizing the importance of the Christian mess and sacrifice. The grotesque decorations on the semi-piers and the vault decoration (with candelabra, <b>puttos</b> and symbols of St. John the Evangelist) were also from Correggio's pupils, in particular Michelangelo Anselmi (c. 1520).|$|R
25|$|At Judenplatz 11 is the {{building}} of the Austrian Administrative Court of Justice (Verwaltungsgerichtshofs) beside the Austrian Constitutional Court of Justice (Verfassungsgerichtshofs) in the former Bohemian Court Chancellery, (Böhmische Hofkanzlei). The building was erected from 1709 to 1714 to the designs of Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach. After 1749, the remaining lots of the block were bought up and Matthias Gerl was put in charge of the expansion of the palace from 1751 to 1754, symmetrically doubling the construction westward. Further rebuilding took place in the 19th century, the palace essentially received its present-day look at that time. The façade on Judenplatz was originally the back of {{the building}}, only since changes in the 20th century has the main entrance gate been found there. The female figures over the gates of this building represent the Cardinal virtues (moderation, wisdom, justice and bravery), and above are the coats of arms of Bohemia and Austria. In the middle of the attic line, an angel stands with trombone, at whose feet a <b>Putto</b> crouches. Four vases and two male figures who are presumably Bohemian Kings Wenceslaus I and Wenceslaus II are at the angel's sides.|$|E
500|$|The five-bay arcades {{are carried}} on square columns with angled corners and have foliated capitals. The chancel is paved with Minton encaustic tiles. The marble reredos dates from 1888, and the {{alabaster}} altar rails from 1900; both were {{donated by the}} daughter of RevJohn Barclay, a former vicar of the church who died in 1866. Mural tablets, {{some of which were}} moved from the old church, commemorate members of the Brooke family and previous vicars of the parish. [...] Also brought from the old church was [...] "a curiously designed table said to have been used as a communion table", two sanctuary chairs (one in Jacobean style), and a chest. [...] In addition, a royal coat of arms of GeorgeIII, and a benefaction board dating from about 1700 were moved from the old church. [...] The oldest memorial is to two women described as [...] "both good wives" [...] who died in 1672. The next in age is a large tablet to the memory of Thomas Brooke, who died in 1737. Two memorials are by John Bacon; one to SirRichard Brooke (died 1792) features a <b>putto</b> unveiling an urn and the second, to another SirRichard Brooke (died 1796), shows a female figure by an urn. The memorial to Thomas Brooke (died 1820) is by B.F.Hardenburg of London. A memorial to another SirRichard Brooke (died 1865) is a brass {{in the form of a}} cross. In the nave are a number of Georgian tablets including one to John Bankes (died 1817), by T.Grindrod. The RevJohn Barclay has a memorial by Williams and Clay of Warrington containing his portrait in relief. The stained glass in the chancel includes two windows with depictions of the Annunciation and the Resurrection. In the south aisle is a memorial to J.R.Hughes, who died at sea in 1874; [...] "he is shown in the water wearing nothing but mutton-chop whiskers and a crown proffered by an angel". [...] The three-manual organ was installed in 1908 and carries a plate saying it was [...] "assisted by Andrew Carnegie". [...] There is a ring of eight bells cast in 1851 by Charles and George Mears, the tenor weighing 153-3-15 in cwts-qtrs-lbs or around 800kg, having a diameter of [...] and tuned to the note E.|$|E
2500|$|The baptismal font of 1695 {{consists}} of a sandstone bowl carried by a <b>putto</b> statue. The congregation still owns {{one of the rare}} mediaeval oaken chests (early 15th century), once containing its precious belongings.|$|E
50|$|The {{room behind}} Mary is {{rendered}} in wide angle perspective. It opens on another room, with St. Joseph's workshop, while a city landscape appears from a window. The {{upper part of}} the scene is populated by angels: some holds Mary's floating crown, while other are spreading incense from thuribles. The side panels also contain numerous <b>puttoes</b> in the background. Their style difference could indicate the intervention of assistants.|$|R
50|$|The {{scene is}} similar to another Perseus Freeing Andromeda by Rubens now in the Hermitage Museum of St. Petersburg. It depicts the Greek mythology hero Perseus {{in the act of}} freeing Andromeda, after {{defeating}} the sea monster which kept her as prisoner. Perseus, wearing helmet, cuirass and cloak, is sided by two <b>puttoes,</b> {{and one of them is}} helping him in removing the ropes that tie Andromeda to the rock.|$|R
5000|$|The work {{is based}} on a socle from which two {{composite}} columns start. They support a round arch with side pendentives decorated by chamfered pilasters and tondo reliefs. At the top is the cusp, in Gothic style with, at the centre, a relief tondo of [...] "Christ Redeemer" [...] and two statues of <b>puttos</b> with trumpets (an allusion to the biblical Apocalypse and the resurrection of the dead).|$|R
2500|$|... (2) Sir Henry Spelman, in his Concina … printed the Canones ad Wulsinum episcopum and {{suggested}} Ælfric Putta or <b>Putto,</b> Archbishop of York, as the author, adding some note of others bearing the name. The identity of Ælfric the grammarian with Ælfric archbishop of York was also discussed by Henry Wharton, in Anglia Sacra.|$|E
2500|$|The {{church of}} St. Mary at Charlton Marshall is {{attributed}} the brothers. The church {{which was built}} in 1713 has a distinctive tower topped by four obelisk pinnacles. Charlton Marshall was {{the home of the}} Horlock-Bastard family, where they had been country gentlemen since the time of the brother' s grandfather Thomas Bastard. Thus the interior of the church contains memorials to members of the Bastard family, including a sculpture dedicated Thomas Bastard who died in 1791 which depicts a <b>putto</b> standing by an urn. [...] The early 18th century nave of the Church of St Mary at Almer in Dorset is attributed to them as Stepleton House at Iwerne Stepleton, and the church of St. Giles in Wimborne St Giles was rebuilt by the brothers in 1732.|$|E
2500|$|Significant {{memorials}} {{are those}} to the Hussey baronets: Sir Charles (1626–1664), {{and his wife}} Elizabeth; and Sir Edward (c. 1661–1725), and his wife Elizabeth (died 1750). Both memorials are at the east wall of the nave. Sir Charles’s, immediately {{to the south of}} the crossing arch, is of a bust set between columns with hanging foliate relief below brackets, these supporting a broken and scrolled pediment with a decorative scrolled cartouche [...] bearing coat of arms at its centre. Below, and part of the monument, is a plaque with inscriptions beneath a pediment and inside vertical volutes. The monument is ascribed to W. Palmer, and Pevsner gives its date as c. 1730. [...] Sir Edward’s, {{to the north of the}} crossing arch, comprises a plaque inscription between pilasters on which is set a pediment broken into three sections topped with an urn on each side. A split garland above the plaque leads to a <b>putto</b> head beneath the central section of the pediment, upon which is a painted coat of arms surrounded by scrolled relief decoration. All parts of both memorials are marble.|$|E
50|$|The work {{depicts the}} theme of the Assumption of Mary with two registers: the lower one shows the apostles of Jesus {{crowding}} around Mary's empty sepulcher, looking at her while she ascends to heaven in a cloud in the upper part, surrounded by happy <b>puttoes.</b> Andrea del Sarto painted two kneeling apostles in the middle, according to the traditional pyramidal composition of holy Conversations, joining them to a circle of other apostles which can be seen, for example, in Raphael's Oddi Altarpiece.|$|R
5000|$|The church's {{main feature}} is its facade, which was {{inspired}} by Giovanni Antonio Amadeo's Certosa di Pavia. It is made of white stone from Saltrio and Viggiù and of Carrara marble, and is divided in three sectors by four false columns supporting the entablature. In the middle sector is the main portal and a large rose window with decoration of cherubs executed after 1578. The decorations of the portals' frames are of high quality, with figures of <b>puttoes,</b> birds and lion-protomes. The central portal, called the [...] "Saints Portal", has five medallions with reliefs, depicting four saints and, in the middle, the Virgin with Child. Between the portal's frame and the entablature are two angels carrying torches, resembling the decoration of the Roman triumphal arches.|$|R
50|$|Correggio {{executed}} five frescoes groups. The first {{includes the}} lunette with St. John and the Eagle (c. 1520), {{followed by the}} dome, with the Ascension of Christ and the drum and the four pendentives decoration. The third work was the decoration of the vault and the apse ceiling of the Cappella Maggiore, partially destroyed in 1586 when the choir was prolonged: today the central fragment with the Coronation of the Virgin (now at the Galleria nazionale di Parma) has survived. The fourth intervention was in the choir's walls, which were totally destroyed during its reconstruction. Finally, Correggio added a painted frieze which runs for the whole internal perimeter. Preparatory drawings show that also the parts executed by his pupils were designed by Correggio, such as the candelabra in the presbytery's vault and the <b>puttos</b> on the cross-vaults.|$|R
2500|$|An {{important}} sketch {{from the}} collection is the so-called Reconciliation of King Henry III and Henry of Navarre – a significant event for Henry IV's ascent to the throne. After {{the death of the}} duke of Anjou, brother of the childless King Henry III, the apparent heir was to be [...] Henry of Navarre (the future King Henry IV). However, when a papal bull denied him the throne and excommunicated him, Henry of Navarre protested, starting the War of the Three Henrys. When Henry III was also ostracized from Paris for initiating the murder of the duke of Guise, he met with Henry of Navarre to make peace and recognize him as rightful heir. Although Rubens depicted this reconciliation as taking place in a throne room, contemporary reports recorded that it was actually in a garden full of spectators. The sketch shows Henry of Navarre bowing down in Henry III's presence, which eyewitness accounts confirm was accurate. Rubens represented a <b>putto</b> taking the crown of Henry III, with the intention of placing it on the willing future Henry IV, although the actual transfer of power didn't occur until Henry III's assassination several months later (August 1, 1589). A page stands behind Henry of Navarre holding his personal badge: a white plumed helmet, while the dog at his feet represents fidelity. The two ominous figures behind Henry III most likely represent personifications of Fraud and Discord.|$|E
50|$|A <b>putto</b> is {{the main}} {{character}} in the 2010 webcomic The Sorrowful <b>Putto</b> of Prague by James Stafford and A. J. Bernardo.|$|E
50|$|During the Middle Ages, the <b>putto</b> {{disappeared}} and was revived during the Quattrocento.The {{revival of the}} figure of the <b>putto</b> is generally attributed to Donatello, in Florence in the 1420s, although there are some earlier manifestations (for example the tomb of Ilaria del Carretto, sculpted by Jacopo della Quercia in Lucca). Since then, Donatello has been called the originator of the <b>putto</b> because of the contribution to art he made in restoring the classical form of <b>putto.</b> He gave <b>putto</b> a distinct character by infusing the form with Christian meanings and using it in new contexts such as musician angels. Putti also began to feature in works showing figures from classical mythology, which became popular in the same period.|$|E
5000|$|The castle is {{surrounded}} by a park, established in the late 17th century. It originally encompassed an orchard on the slope below the castle, and four fishponds on the plain below that, with a walking path with benches leading from the castle. The layout has not significantly changed, though only one of the ponds remains. The current arrangement includes an access path, which ascends the slope toward a square walled courtyard behind the castle. The wall is decorated with baroque female figures and <b>puttos</b> by Angelo PuttaPozzi, originally from the garden of the defunct Zalog (Wartenberg) manor by Moravče, but relocated here in the 1960s along with his Atlas statues at the northerm entrance steps. On {{the opposite side of the}} courtyard, the path descends toward a nearby road. Between the access paths there is an informal park, with an artificial lake and non-native trees.|$|R
50|$|The right apse has ceiling frescoes of Stories of the Life of St. John of Parma by Anselmi. The altarpiece {{with the}} Miracle of Sy. John was painted by Emilio Taruffi (1674). At {{the walls are}} two groups by Begarelli, portraying St. Felicita with Saint Vitalis and St. Benedict. The presbytery has {{grotesque}} decorations attributed to Correggio, while the <b>puttos</b> were added around 1588 by Innocenzo Martini; a fresco from 1587 replicates the original by Correggio, of which only the central part remains, now at the Galleria Nazionale di Parma. The altarpiece is a Transfiguration by Bedoli (c. 1556). The carved wooden choir is from 1513-1538. The portal leading to the sacristy has a fresco by Correggio in the lunette, depicting St. John and the Eagle and generally considered his first work in the church, although similarities with the dome decoration could imply that it dates from a later period. The inscription ALTIUS CAETERIS DEI PATEFECIT ARCAN around the painting refers to the nocturnal prayers of the monks. The sacristy was frescoed in 1508 by Cesare Cesariano.|$|R
50|$|Work on Šibenik cathedral {{inspired}} Nicola for {{his work}} on the expansion of chapel of Blessed John from Trogir in 1468. Just like Šibenik cathedral, it was composed out of large stone blocks with extreme precision. In cooperation with disciple of Juraj - Andrija Aleši, Nicola has achieved unique harmony of architecture and sculpture according to antique ideals. From inside, there is no flat wall. In the middle of chapel, on the altar, lies the sarcophagus of blessed John of Trogir. Surrounding are reliefs of <b>puttos</b> carrying torches that look like they were peeping out of doors of Underworld. Above them there are niches with sculptures of Christ and apostles, amongst them are putties, circular windows encircled with fruit garland, and a relief of Nativity. All is ceiled with coffered ceiling with image of God in the middle and 96 portrait heads of angels. With so many faces of smiling children the chapel looks very cheerful and there is not anything similar in European art of that time.|$|R
