5|$|As the {{reputation}} of the Mars Works grew, so too did the demand for its products. After a few years the Mars Works began exporting its engines inland. Oliver Evans's son George was the first such order, having moved to <b>Pittsburgh</b> in 1809 to operate the <b>Pittsburgh</b> Steam Flour Mill. George and the mill were highly successful, and generated a great deal of interest in Evans's engines across the interior. However exporting engines to western Pennsylvania, Kentucky or Ohio was challenging and expensive from a logistical perspective. In 1811 Evans and George, as well as another successful steam miller and engineer Luther Stephens, founded the <b>Pittsburgh</b> Steam Engine Company, which in addition to engines would, like the Mars Works, produce heavy machinery and castings in <b>Pittsburgh,</b> Pennsylvania. With high demand for industrial products and relatively little industrial capacity, the <b>Pittsburgh</b> works added to its repertoire the capacity for brasswork, as well as producing finer products for domestic purposes like hinges and fittings.|$|E

And <b>Pittsburgh,</b> even though {{it has a lot of}} hills, it can be Indianapolis. We just have to find a couple of flat streets.|$|E

5|$|Georgia Tech {{had entered}} into {{the main part of}} its {{schedule}} after three dominating wins. Upcoming engagements with Vanderbilt, <b>Pittsburgh,</b> and Centre were said to determine the season's outcome. <b>Pittsburgh</b> and Centre–but <b>Pittsburgh</b> especially, were the biggest opponents.
