5|$|The peak random write {{performance}} on an SSD {{is driven by}} plenty of free blocks after the SSD is completely garbage collected, secure erased, 100% TRIMed, or newly installed. The maximum speed will depend upon the number of parallel flash channels connected to the SSD controller, {{the efficiency of the}} firmware, and the speed of the flash memory in writing to a page. During this phase the write amplification will be the best it can ever be for random writes and will be approaching one. Once the blocks are all written once, garbage collection will begin and the <b>performance</b> <b>will</b> be gated by the speed and efficiency of that process. Write amplification in this phase will increase to the highest levels the drive will experience.|$|E

25|$|IOPS {{performance}} of a ZFS storage pool can suffer if the ZFS raid is not appropriately configured. This applies to all types of RAID, {{in one way or}} another. If the zpool consists of only one group of disks configured as, say, eight disks in RAIDZ2, then the IOPS <b>performance</b> <b>will</b> be that of a single disk (write speed will be equivalent to 6 disks, but random read speed will be similar to a single disk). However, there are ways to mitigate this IOPS performance problem, for instance add SSDs as L2ARC cache— which can boost IOPS into 100.000s. In short, a zpool should consist of several groups of vdevs, each vdev consisting of 8–12 disks, if using RAIDZ. It is not recommended to create a zpool with a single large vdev, say 20 disks, because IOPS <b>performance</b> <b>will</b> be that of a single disk, which also means that resilver time will be very long (possibly weeks with future large drives).|$|E
25|$|Public {{transportation}} {{also provides}} an arena to test environmentally friendly fuel alternatives, such as hydrogen-powered vehicles. Swapping out materials to create lighter public transportation vehicles {{with the same}} or better <b>performance</b> <b>will</b> increase environmental friendliness of public transportation vehicles while maintaining current standards or improving them. Informing {{the public about the}} positive environmental effects of using public transportation in addition to pointing out the potential economic benefit is an important first step towards making a difference.|$|E
25|$|Expectancy theory posits {{employee}} satisfaction to be {{an outcome}} of performance rather than the cause of performance. However, if a pattern is established whereas an employee understands his <b>performance</b> <b>will</b> lead to certain desired rewards, an employee's motivation can be strengthened based on anticipation. If the employees foresee a high probability that they can successfully carry out a desired behavior, and that their behavior {{will lead to a}} valued outcome, then they will direct their efforts toward that end.|$|E

30|$|The {{performances}} of the three newly proposed estimators are evaluated in this section. Since both DOA-BB-MUSIC and DOA-P-BB-MUSIC estimators are capable of decoupling the polarization estimation from the direction finding, their direction finding <b>performances</b> <b>will</b> be compared with two other polarization decoupled estimators, namely the DOA-LV-MUSIC and ESPRIT [23].

25|$|In higher education, {{linguistic}} profiling {{has been found}} to impede student comprehension. In a 1992 study, D. Rubin found that undergraduate university students would comprehend material more poorly if they heard a non-accented lecture presented with a picture of an Asian female. When the same non-accented lecture was presented with a European American teaching assistant, students had a greater ability to comprehend the material. This suggests that face identification may be enough to make students believe that language <b>performance</b> <b>will</b> be accented, which corresponded with a belief that comprehension would be reduced.|$|E
25|$|When {{there is}} a high {{temperature}} differential (e.g., when an air-source heat pump is used to heat a house with an outside temperature of, say, 0°C (32°F)), it takes more work to move the same amount of heat to indoors than on a milder day. Ultimately, due to Carnot efficiency limits, the heat pump's <b>performance</b> <b>will</b> decrease as the outdoor-to-indoor temperature difference increases (outside temperature gets colder), reaching a theoretical limit of 1.0 at −273°C. In practice, a COP of 1.0 will typically be reached at an outdoor temperature around −18°C (0°F) for air source heat pumps.|$|E
25|$|A {{lighting}} designer (LD) {{is familiar}} with the various types of lighting instruments and their uses. In consultation with the director, the DSM (deputy stage manager) and the scenic designer, and after observing rehearsals, the LD creates an instrument schedule and a light plot as well as informing the DSM where each LX (lighting) cue is designed to be triggered in the script, which the DSM notes down in his plot book. The schedule is a list of all required lighting equipment, including color gel, gobos, color wheels, barndoors and other accessories. The light plot is typically a plan view of the theatre where the <b>performance</b> <b>will</b> take place, with every luminaire marked. This typically specifies the approximate lighting focus and direction, a reference number, accessories, and the channel number of the dimmer system or lighting control console.|$|E

25|$|According to the JCT, an {{organization}} that provides workers with sufficient levels of skill variety (using different skills and talents in performing work), task identity (contributing to a clearly identifiable larger project), and task significance (impacting the lives or work of other people) {{is likely to have}} workers who feel their work has meaning and value. Sufficiently high levels of autonomy (independence, freedom and discretion in carrying out the job) will inspire the worker to feel responsibility for the work; and sufficiently high levels of Task Feedback (receiving timely, clear, specific, detailed, actionable information about the effectiveness of his or her job <b>performance)</b> <b>will</b> inspire the worker to feel the organization is authentically interested in helping to foster his/her professional development and growth. The combined effect of these psychological states results in desired personal and work outcomes: intrinsic motivation, job satisfaction, performance quality, low absenteeism, and low turnover rate.|$|E
25|$|If {{older adults}} have fewer attentional {{resources}} than younger adults, {{we would expect}} that when two tasks {{must be carried out}} at the same time, older adults' <b>performance</b> <b>will</b> decline more than that of younger adults. However, a large review of studies on cognition and aging suggest that this hypothesis has not been wholly supported. While some studies have found that older adults have a more difficult time encoding and retrieving information when their attention is divided, other studies have not found meaningful differences from younger adults. Similarly, one might expect older adults to do poorly on tasks of sustained attention, which measure the ability to attend to and respond to stimuli {{for an extended period of}} time. However, studies suggest that sustained attention shows no decline with age. Results suggest that sustained attention increases in early adulthood and then remains relatively stable, at least through the seventh decade of life. More research is needed on how normal aging impacts attention after age eighty.|$|E
25|$|All robots {{contain some}} level of {{computer}} programming code. A program is how a robot decides when or how to do something. In the caterpillar track example, a robot that needs to move across a muddy road may have the correct mechanical construction and receive the correct amount of power from its battery, but would not go anywhere without a program telling it to move. Programs are the core essence of a robot, it could have excellent mechanical and electrical construction, but if its program is poorly constructed its <b>performance</b> <b>will</b> be very poor (or it may not perform at all). There are three different types of robotic programs: remote control, artificial intelligence and hybrid. A robot with remote control programing has a preexisting set of commands that it will only perform if and when it receives a signal from a control source, typically a human being with a remote control. It is perhaps more appropriate to view devices controlled primarily by human commands as falling in the discipline of automation rather than robotics. Robots that use artificial intelligence interact with their environment on their own without a control source, and can determine reactions to objects and problems they encounter using their preexisting programming. Hybrid {{is a form of}} programming that incorporates both AI and RC functions.|$|E
