40|$|AIm: To {{improve the}} {{strength}} of stabilization systems currently used in osteoporotic spinal fractures, essentially by increasing the fixation force of <b>pedicle</b> <b>screws.</b> mATERIAL and mETHods: Six human cadaveric vertebrae were used. Bone mineral densities of the specimens were measured with Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry {{in order to assess}} the osteoporosis. All vertebrae were found to be severely osteoporotic. Standard <b>pedicle</b> <b>screws</b> were applied to left pedicles of vertebrae. <b>Pedicle</b> <b>screws</b> reinforced by fixing plugs “Dubel ” were applied to right pedicles of vertebrae. Afterwards the vertebrae were embedded in acrylic casts to prevent possible fracture of the osteoporotic vertebrae and to obtain a correct vertical pull-out vector. The biomechanical pullout tests were performed with biomechanical testing machine. Pullout forces in each group were recorded and compared with Mann-Whitney U test. REsuLTs: The <b>pedicle</b> <b>screws</b> strengthened by “Dubel ” were found to be four times stronger than the standard <b>pedicle</b> <b>screws,</b> in the osteoporotic human cadaveric vertebrae. CoNCLusIoN: “Dubel”-augmented <b>pedicle</b> <b>screws</b> may contribute to developing better stabilization systems for osteoporotic thoracolumbar fractures needing surgery and in the revision of the previous fusion surgeries of the spine...|$|R

40|$|Expansive <b>pedicle</b> <b>screws</b> {{significantly}} improve fixation {{strength in}} osteoporotic spines. However, the previous literature does not adequately address {{the effects of}} the number of lengthwise slits and the extent of screw expansion on the strength of the bone/screw inter-face when expansive screws are used with or without cement augmentation. Herein, four designs for expansive <b>pedicle</b> <b>screws</b> with different numbers of lengthwise slits and different screw expansion levels were evaluated. Synthetic bones simulating severe osteoporosis were used to provide a comparative platform for each screw design. The prepared speci-mens were then tested for axial pullout failure. Regardless of screw design, screws with cement augmentation demonstrated significantly higher pullout strength than <b>pedicle</b> <b>screws</b> without cement augmentation (p 0. 05). Taken together, our results show that <b>pedicle</b> <b>screws</b> combined with cement augmentation may greatly increase screw fixation regardless of screws with or without expansion. An increase in both the number of slits and the extent of screw expansion had little impact on the screw-anchoring strength. Cement augmentation is the most influential factor for improving screw pullout strength...|$|R

40|$|Objectives:To {{evaluate}} the accuracy and the operative complications of implanting <b>pedicle</b> <b>screws</b> in the thoracic and lumbar spine, using computer-assisted surgery {{compared to the}} implantation technique using fluoroscopy. Methods:A retrospective study was conducted at the Hospital Universitário Cajuru PUC-PR from January 2000 to January 2009. Two groups of patients undergoing implant <b>pedicle</b> <b>screws</b> were analyzed (n= 80). Group I received implant <b>pedicle</b> <b>screws</b> through fluoroscopy technique and group II, through neuronavigation technique. The accuracy of positioning of <b>pedicle</b> <b>screws</b> was evaluated using rating scales. Results:The accuracy was higher in group II, where 77. 5 % of the screws were correctly positioned, whereas there were only 28. 5 % in group I (p= 0. 001). There was a reduction of 95 % (CI: 80 - 97 %) {{in the risk of}} screws misplacement in group II. The average operation time was 312. 2 ± 78. 1 minutes in group I and 270. 3 ± 41. 4 in group II (p= 0. 004). Blood transfusion was needed in 28 patients in group I and 10 patients in group II (p= 0. 005), resulting in 64 % risk reduction of blood transfusion in group II. Eight patients in group I underwent revision surgery whereas only one patient in the group II, that is, 75 % of surgical revision risk reduction.

50|$|Spinal fusion is {{the most}} widely {{performed}} surgery for scoliosis. In this procedure, bone harvested from elsewhere in the body (autograft) is grafted to the vertebrae so when they heal, they form one solid bone mass and the vertebral column becomes rigid. This prevents worsening of the curve, {{at the expense of}} some spinal movement. This can be performed from the anterior (front) aspect of the spine by entering the thoracic or abdominal cavities, or more commonly, performed from the back (posterior). A combination may be used in more severe cases, though the modern <b>pedicle</b> <b>screw</b> system has largely negated the need for this.|$|E

5000|$|Minimally {{invasive}} {{procedures are}} a more common alternative {{due to the}} decreased risk of damaging significant muscle tissue. The difference between invasive and minimally invasive spinal surgeries is that minimally invasive procedures involves {{a series of small}} incisions. Minimally invasive procedures can be performed anywhere along the spine, and have been used to treat various abnormalities. The percutaneous <b>pedicle</b> <b>screw</b> fixation technique allows for a procedure that presents minimal risk to the patient. Fluoroscopic image guided navigation through these portals allows for surgeons to perform more efficient procedures. Minimally invasive procedures often yield a much faster recovery time than fully invasive surgeries, making them more appealing to patients. Laminectomies have always been the gold standard when treating lumbar spinal stenosis, but recently, less invasive surgeries have emerged as a safer alternative treatment that helps maintain the postoperative structural integrity of the spine.|$|E
40|$|The {{incidence}} of <b>pedicle</b> <b>screw</b> breech varies based on anatomic location, body habitus, surgeon experience, spinal deformity, and surgical technique. Pedicle breeches {{have been reported}} to occur in up to 40 % of screws. The purpose of this retrospective study was to compare the rates of revision of <b>pedicle</b> <b>screw</b> placement when using intraoperative C-arm vs O-arm (Medtronic, Memphis, Tennessee) assessment of pedicle screws. An economic analysis was also performed based on the estimated cost of <b>pedicle</b> <b>screw</b> revision. Four (1 %) of 386 control patients required <b>pedicle</b> <b>screw</b> revision for a breeched <b>pedicle</b> <b>screw</b> not identified with intraoperative C-arm fluoroscopy. In the study group, none of the 331 patients returned to the operating room when O-arm was used to assess <b>pedicle</b> <b>screw</b> placement. Based on the 1 % rate of returning to the operating room in the control group, the annual rate of cases nationwide requiring <b>pedicle</b> <b>screw</b> revision would be approximately 2300, with a cost of approximately $ 40, 595, 000. These results suggest that the use of intraoperative O-arm can reduce the need for revision of a breeched <b>pedicle</b> <b>screw.</b> This can potentially lead to a major cost savings...|$|E

METHODS: Finite element methods were utilised to investigate the biomechanical comparison of the four posterior short segment <b>pedicle</b> <b>screw</b> fixation techniques (S 4 + 2 : traditional short-segment 4 <b>pedicle</b> <b>screw</b> fixation [SPSF]; M 4 + 2 : mono-segment <b>pedicle</b> <b>screw</b> fixation; I 6 + 2 : intermediate bilateral <b>pedicle</b> <b>screw</b> fixation; and I 5 + 2 : intermediate unilateral <b>pedicle</b> <b>screw</b> fixation). RESULTS: The range of motion (ROM) in flexion, axial rotation, and lateral bending was the smallest in the I 6 + 2 fixation model, followed by the I 5 + 2 and S 4 + 2 fixation models, but lateral bending was {{the largest in the}} M 4 + 2 fixation model. The maximal stress of the upper <b>pedicle</b> <b>screw</b> is larger than the lower <b>pedicle</b> <b>screw</b> in S 4 + 2 and M 4 + 2. The largest maximal von Mises stress was observed in the upper <b>pedicle</b> <b>screw</b> in the S 4 + 2 and M 4 + 2 fixation models and in the lower <b>pedicle</b> <b>screw</b> in the I 6 + 2 and I 5 + 2 fixation models. The values of the largest maximal von Mises stress of the pedicle screws and rods during all states of motion were 263. 1 MPa and 304. 5 MPa in the S 4 + 2 fixation model, 291. 6 MPa and 340. 5 MPa in the M 4 + 2 fixation model, 182. 9 MPa and 263. 2 MPa in the I 6 + 2 fixation model, and 269. 3 MPa and 383. 7 MPa in the I 5 + 2 fixation model, respectively. Comparing the stress between different spinal loadings, the maximal von Mises stress of the implants were observed in flexion in all implanted models. CONCLUSION: Additional bilateral pedicle screws {{at the level of the}} fracture to SPSF may result in a stiffer construct and less von Mises stress for pedicle screws and rods. The largest maximal von Mises stress of the pedicle screws during all states of motion were observed in the mono-segment <b>pedicle</b> <b>screw</b> fixation technique...|$|E

Furthermore, we evaluated the benefits of using the Renaissance robotic system in <b>pedicle</b> <b>screw</b> placement and postoperative evaluations. Finally, we examined the factors affecting the accuracy of <b>pedicle</b> <b>screw</b> implantation. Through use of the Renaissance robotic system, the accuracy of Kirschner-wire (K-wire) placements deviating < 3 mm from the planned trajectory {{was determined to be}} 98. 74 %. According to our classification system, the robot-guided <b>pedicle</b> <b>screw</b> implantation attained an accuracy of 94. 00 % before repositioning and 98. 74 % after repositioning. However, the malposition rate before repositioning was 5. 99 %; among these placements, 4. 73 % were immediately repositioned using the robot system and 1. 26 % were manually repositioned after a failed robot repositioning attempt. Most K-wire entry points deviated caudally and laterally. The Renaissance robotic system offers high accuracy in <b>pedicle</b> <b>screw</b> placement. Secondary registration improves the accuracy through increasing the precision of the positioning; moreover, intraoperative evaluation enables immediate repositioning.
