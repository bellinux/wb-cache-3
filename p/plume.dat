5|$|Although {{some of the}} seamounts in the Kodiak-Bowie Seamount chain {{appear to}} follow the {{expected}} age progression for a mantle <b>plume</b> trail, others, such as Denson Seamount, are older than that hypothesis would suggest. As a result, the Kodiak-Bowie Seamount chain has also been proposed by geoscientists to be a mix of ridge and mantle <b>plume</b> volcanism.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} two days of the fire, the high thermal energy made the <b>plume</b> highly buoyant; this, {{together}} with settled weather conditions, allowed the <b>plume</b> to rise to a great height with little cross-mixing. When the fire was reduced in intensity it was reported to be possible that the <b>plume</b> would be less buoyant and that ground-level smoke concentrations could then rise significantly. By 12 December, it was reported that the smoke cloud had reached northern France; it was expected to arrive in northern Spain by the weekend.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the impacts}} of deep sea mining, {{sediment}} <b>plumes</b> could have the greatest impact. <b>Plumes</b> are caused when the tailings from mining (usually fine particles) are dumped back into the ocean, creating a cloud of particles floating in the water. Two types of <b>plumes</b> occur: near-bottom <b>plumes</b> and surface <b>plumes.</b> Near-bottom <b>plumes</b> occur when the tailings are pumped {{back down to the}} mining site. The floating particles increase the turbidity, or cloudiness, of the water, clogging filter-feeding apparatuses used by benthic organisms. Surface <b>plumes</b> cause a more serious problem. Depending {{on the size of the}} particles and water currents the <b>plumes</b> could spread over vast areas. The <b>plumes</b> could impact zooplankton and light penetration, in turn affecting the food web of the area.|$|R

5|$|Jovian Europa Orbiter was an ESA Cosmic Vision concept {{study from}} 2007.

30|$|The {{scale of}} vapor <b>plumes</b> in LPV {{experiments}} is ~ 10 − 3 – 10 − 4 m while that of asteroidal and cometary impacts on surfaces of planets is typically up to 106 m. Quenching temperature of chemical reactions within vapor <b>plumes</b> decreases as {{the scale of}} vapor <b>plumes</b> increases. For example, quenching temperature {{is estimated to be}} ~ 3000 K for laboratory-scale <b>plumes</b> and ~ 2000 K for <b>plumes</b> produced by impacts of projectiles several kilometer in diameter (Gerasimov, 1998). In previous theoretical studies of impact-induced vapor <b>plumes,</b> silicate components are removed from calculations because those components are thought to be condensed completely because of low quenching temperature.|$|R

5|$|Astronomers may {{be close}} to solving this mystery. They noticed a large <b>plume</b> of gas {{extending}} at least six times its stellar radius indicating that Betelgeuse is not shedding matter evenly in all directions. The plume's presence implies that the spherical symmetry of the star's photosphere, often observed in the infrared, is not preserved in its close environment. Asymmetries on the stellar disk had been reported at different wavelengths. However, due to the refined capabilities of the NACO adaptive optics on the VLT, these asymmetries have come into focus. The two mechanisms that could cause such asymmetrical mass loss, were large-scale convection cells or polar mass loss, possibly due to rotation. Probing deeper with ESO's AMBER, gas in the supergiant's extended atmosphere has been observed vigorously moving up and down, creating bubbles {{as large as the}} supergiant itself, leading his team to conclude that such stellar upheaval is behind the massive <b>plume</b> ejection observed by Kervella.|$|E
