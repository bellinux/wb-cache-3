50|$|A furrow <b>profilometer</b> is {{used for}} the {{measurement}} of the cross-sectional geometry of furrows and corrugations, and is important in furrow assessments. For each furrow, the cross-sectional geometry should be measured at two to three locations before and after the irrigation. A <b>profilometer</b> for determining the cross-sections of furrows is shown in Figure. Individual scales located on the horizontal rod of the <b>profilometer</b> provide data to plot furrow depth {{as a function of the}} lateral distance and the data can be numerically integrated. This gives geometric relationships such as area verses depth, wetted perimeter versus depth and top-width verses depth.|$|E
40|$|A {{method of}} {{adaptive}} signal processing {{has been proposed}} {{as the basis of}} a new generation of interferometric optical <b>profilometers</b> for measuring surfaces. The proposed <b>profilometers</b> would be portable, hand-held units. Sizes could be thus reduced because the adaptive-signal-processing method would make it possible to substitute lower-power coherent light sources (e. g., laser diodes) for white light sources and would eliminate the need for most of the optical components of current white-light <b>profilometers.</b> The adaptive-signal-processing method would make it possible to attain scanning ranges of the order of decimeters in the proposed <b>profilometers...</b>|$|R

50|$|A {{major issue}} with the {{profilers}} {{has to do with}} their contact areas compared to the footprint of a tyre. The latter is much larger than any of the static/slow speed Class 1 priofilers or a typical laser <b>profilometer.</b> This has been addressed more recently through the use of scanning lasers which create a 3D model of the pavement surface. An example of this is the Pavemetrics system which has been adopted by many different OEM suppliers of <b>profilometer</b> equipment around the world. In addition to measuring roughness this system also measures other key pavement attributes such as cracking, rut depth and texture.|$|E

40|$|We present {{our results}} of the {{development}} of some schemes for nondestructive optical profilometry of cylindrically shaped surfaces by using spatially matched conical light beams. A theoretical model is elaborated which describes <b>profilometers</b> with Bessel beams. A special feature of the <b>profilometers</b> proposed is the possibility to control their sensitivity and resolution. To this end, a scheme of tuning the cone angle of the Bessel beam over a wide range is incorporated. The operation regime of the <b>profilometers</b> is characterized by a nonzero spatial frequency of output signal. It allow us to apply a new algorithm for the interpretation of the output signal. This algorithm consists in the calculation of the azimuth spectrum which characterizes the deviation of tested profiles from the circular ones...|$|R

50|$|While the {{historical}} {{notion of a}} <b>profilometer</b> was a device similar to a phonograph that measures a surface as the surface is moved relative to the contact profilometer's stylus, this notion is changing {{with the emergence of}} numerous non-contact profilometery techniques.|$|E

50|$|A {{diamond stylus}} is moved {{vertically}} {{in contact with}} a sample and then moved laterally across the sample for a specified distance and specified contact force. A <b>profilometer</b> can measure small surface variations in vertical stylus displacement {{as a function of}} position. A typical <b>profilometer</b> can measure small vertical features ranging in height from 10 nanometres to 1 millimetre. The height position of the diamond stylus generates an analog signal which is converted into a digital signal, stored, analyzed, and displayed. The radius of diamond stylus ranges from 20 nanometres to 50 Î¼m, and the horizontal resolution is controlled by the scan speed and data signal sampling rate. The stylus tracking force can range from less than 1 to 50 milligrams.|$|E

40|$|Optical <b>profilometers</b> can in {{principle}} {{be used to}} measure the roughness of surfaces that are not accessible for mechanical <b>profilometers.</b> Optical measurements can be performed through a transparent layer because of the noncontacting nature of the measuring principle. In this article the properties of a focus error detection system are given for the general case of scanning free surfaces and for the particular case of a glass plate lying on the scanned surface. Tests show that scanning through a glass plate is possible, but there are some limitations. The conditions under which proper measurements can be performed are described. Some examples of scanning through a transparent layer will be presented in part II of this paper...|$|R
