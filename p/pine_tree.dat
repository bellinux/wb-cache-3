A golden book, symbolizing learning, sits open at {{the centre of the}} cross. In each of the four compartments is an emblem of the university's Canadian and British origins: a <b>pine</b> <b>tree</b> for Canada, a thistle for Scotland, a rose for England, and a shamrock for Ireland. The border is decorated with eight gold crowns, symbolic of Queen Victoria and the university's Royal Charter.|$|E
5|$|The Sea of Monsters is a fantasy-adventure novel {{based on}} Greek mythology written by Rick Riordan and {{published}} in 2006. It is the second novel in the Percy Jackson & the Olympians series and the sequel to The Lightning Thief.

30|$|Among the {{afforested}} lands, afforestation of <b>pine</b> <b>trees</b> and deciduous afforestation {{gained more}} from the losses in other LCTs. However, there were instances where deciduous afforestation also lost to afforestation of <b>pine</b> <b>trees</b> (Table  4). While other LUTs were changing to afforestation (mixed forest), afforestation often lost to afforestation of <b>pine</b> <b>trees</b> and deciduous tree afforestation. In Schlabendorf Nord, 23.81 ha and 15.69 ha of afforestation was replaced by afforestation of <b>pine</b> <b>trees</b> in the first segment and second segments. In Schlabendorf Süd, however, replacement of afforestation by afforestation of <b>pine</b> <b>trees</b> occurred {{in the first and}} last segments. In the first segment 97.05  ha of afforestation was replaced by afforestation of <b>pine</b> <b>trees</b> (Figures 6 and 8) in the last segment the coverage was 49.68  ha (Table  4).|$|R
40|$|We {{studied the}} spatial {{distribution}} pattern of surviving Japanese black <b>pine</b> <b>trees</b> and those killed by pine wilt disease in 2008 and 2009 in a sparsely growing, young {{stand on a}} lava field in Sakurajima, Kagoshima Prefecture, southern Japan. <b>Pine</b> <b>trees</b> were distributed aggregately and formed loose colonies occupying an area of 16 - 25 m 2. <b>Pine</b> <b>trees</b> killed by <b>pine</b> wilt disease in 2008 and 2009 also occurred in loose colonies of 16 - 25 m 2 in area. However, the spatial distribution pattern of <b>pine</b> <b>trees</b> killed in 2009 was exclusive to that in 2008, and killed trees in 2009 occurred in colonies of <b>pine</b> <b>trees</b> where no killed <b>pine</b> <b>trees</b> occurred in 2008. Asymptomatic carrier trees might not have any significant impacts on the spatial pattern of killed trees.

5|$|In 1876, Dr. Don Gregorio Chil y Naranjo {{discovered}} several incisions in some mummies that he speculated {{may have}} been used to remove the internal organs. Don Brothwell's work in 1969 confirmed that evisceration was a method used by the Guanche. Along with a team of other scientists, Brothwell conducted a pathological examination of a Guanche mummy. The examination revealed that the body had been eviscerated, then the abdominal and thoracic cavities had been packed with a mud-like substance that contained the bark of a <b>pine</b> <b>tree.</b> Some sort of packing was also applied subcutaneously, but the exact make-up of this particular embalming substance is unknown.|$|E
5|$|The Australian magpie prefers open {{areas such}} as grassland, fields and {{residential}} {{areas such as}} parks, gardens, golf courses, and streets, with scattered trees or forest nearby. Birds nest and shelter in trees but forage mainly {{on the ground in}} these open areas. It has also been recorded in mature pine plantations; birds only occupy rainforest and wet sclerophyll forest in the vicinity of cleared areas. In general, evidence suggests the range and population of the Australian magpie has increased with land-clearing, although local declines in Queensland due to a 1902 drought, and in Tasmania in the 1930s have been noted; the cause for the latter is unclear but rabbit baiting, <b>pine</b> <b>tree</b> removal, and spread of the masked lapwing (Vanellus miles) have been implicated.|$|E
5|$|In recent times, local bodies {{such as the}} {{municipality}} of Castellar del Riu or Berga or the local branch of the Catalan National Assembly, have adopted the practice of presenting a young three-branched <b>pine</b> <b>tree</b> or sapling {{claimed to be a}} descendant of Pi de les Tres Branques to other bodies, as symbols of solidarity. Early examples include presentations to the Castle of Gallifa in 1986, and the Castle of St. Ferran in Berga in 1992 (along with a sapling of the Tree of Guernica). The practice gained momentum following the February 2014 presentation of a young tree to the town of Folgueroles, to commemorate Jacint Verdaguer who was born there; that tree has since been vandalised. Subsequent 2014 recipients have included Andorra la Vella, Sant Hipòlit de Voltregà, and Saldes. The Forest Museum in Sant Celoni also claims to have five descendants of Pi de les Tres Branques in its grounds.|$|E

5|$|Most ants are univoltine, {{producing}} {{a new generation}} each year. During the species-specific breeding period, new reproductives, females, and winged males leave the colony in {{what is called a}} nuptial flight. The nuptial flight usually takes place in the late spring or early summer when the weather is hot and humid. Heat makes flying easier and freshly fallen rain makes the ground softer for mated queens to dig nests. Males typically take flight before the females. Males then use visual cues to find a common mating ground, for example, a landmark such as a <b>pine</b> <b>tree</b> to which other males in the area converge. Males secrete a mating pheromone that females follow. Males will mount females in the air, but the actual mating process usually takes place on the ground. Females of some species mate with just one male but in others they may mate with as many as ten or more different males, storing the sperm in their spermathecae.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{its effects}} in the {{northern}} Gulf of Mexico, only one person was directly killed from the storm there; a man drowned off the coast when he fell off his sailboat near Fort Morgan, Alabama. One indirect casualty also occurred in the area, when a man {{had a heart attack}} while trying to secure a boat off the Alabama coast during the storm. Numerous roads became flooded and impassable for several days, south and along I-10 in Mobile, south and central Choctaw, and Baldwin counties. Along the Fowl and Fish rivers, in Mobile and Baldwin counties respectively, significant damage to homes occurred due to flooding. Most roads on Dauphin Island were flooded in over a foot of water. A few homes were close to falling into Mobile Bay, and one home had to be moved backwards towards land to prevent its destruction. At the peak of the storm in Alabama, at least 44,000people were without power in Mobile and Baldwin counties. In rural Choctaw County, north of Mobile, several families were rescued from flooded roads and trapped cars. The majority of houses and businesses on Dauphin Island and buildings from the western shore of Mobile Bay, and from Fort Morgan east to Orange Beach, had roof damage. $ (1997USD, $ USD) in total property damage occurred in Alabama, in addition to pecan and <b>pine</b> <b>tree</b> damage costing $ (1997USD, $ USD).|$|E
5|$|Typically, ice traders hired {{vessels to}} ship ice as freight, {{although}} Frederic Tudor initially purchased his own vessel and the Tudor Company later bought three fast cargo ships {{of its own}} in 1877. Ice was first transported in ships {{at the end of}} the 18th century, when it was occasionally used as ballast. Shipping ice as ballast, however, required it to be cleanly cut in order to avoid it shifting around as it melted, which was not easily done until Wyeth's invention of the ice-cutter in 1825. The uniform blocks that Wyeth's process produced also made it possible to pack more ice into the limited space of a ship's hold, and significantly reduced the losses from melting. The ice was typically packed up tightly with sawdust, and the hold was then closed to prevent warmer air entering; other forms of protective dunnage used to protect ice included hay and <b>pine</b> <b>tree</b> cuttings. This requirement for large quantities of sawdust coincided with the growth in the New England lumber industry in the 1830s; sawdust had no other use at the time, and was in fact considered something of a problem, so its use in the ice trade proved very useful to the local timber industry.|$|E
