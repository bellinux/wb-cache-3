5|$|The methods {{through which}} {{tropical}} cyclones are forecast have {{changed with the}} passage of time. The first known forecasts in the Western Hemisphere were made by Lt. Col. William Reed of the Corps of Royal Engineers at Barbados in 1847. Reed mostly utilized barometric <b>pressure</b> <b>measurements</b> as the basis of his forecasts. Benito Vines introduced a forecast and warning system based on cloud cover changes in Havana during the 1870s. Before the early 1900s, though, most forecasts were done by direct observations at weather stations, which were then relayed to forecast centers via telegraph. It wasn’t until the advent of radio {{in the early twentieth century}} that observations from ships at sea were available to forecasters. The 1930s saw the usage of radiosondes in tropical cyclone forecasting. The next decade saw the advent of aircraft-based reconnaissance by the military, starting with the first dedicated flight into a hurricane in 1943, and the establishment of the Hurricane Hunters in 1944. In the 1950s, coastal weather radars began to be used in the United States, and research reconnaissance flights by the precursor of the Hurricane Research Division began in 1954.|$|E

40|$|Objective To {{identify}} {{prevalence of}} previous blood <b>pressure</b> <b>measurement</b> and analyze some associated factors in adolescents. Methods This cross-sectional study included 6, 077 adolescents aged 14 to 19 years. Demographic characteristics included (sex, age, period of study, region of residence, work, skin color, and economic) status, history of blood <b>pressure</b> <b>measurement</b> within last 12 months, local of blood <b>pressure</b> <b>measurement,</b> and reading obtained. To assess associations between previous blood <b>pressure</b> <b>measurement</b> with demographic characteristics {{and high blood}} pressure we used descriptive statistics and logistic regression analysis. Results Out of the adolescents, 56. 8 % reported no blood <b>pressure</b> <b>measurement</b> within the last 12 months. The health centers and the physician&# 8217;s office were most mentioned places for blood <b>pressure</b> <b>measurement</b> (28. 3 % and 36. 9 %, respectively). Boys (odds ratio of 1. 64 95 %CI: 1. 46 - 1. 84) aged 14 to 16 years (odds ratio of 1. 12; 95 %CI: 1. 01 - 1. 25), whose economic status was unfavorable (odds ratio of 1. 48; 95 %CI: 1. 32 - 1. 67) were significantly associated with no blood <b>pressure</b> <b>measurement.</b> Working was a protective factor for was not blood <b>pressure</b> <b>measurement</b> (odds ratio of 0. 84; 95 %CI: 0. 73 - 0. 97). Conclusion Most of adolescents did not have their blood pressure measured within the last 12 months.

25|$|<b>Pressure</b> <b>measurement</b> {{systems are}} an {{additional}} {{way to measure}} gait by providing insights into pressure distribution, contact area, center of force movement and symmetry between sides. These systems typically provide more than just pressure information; additional information available from these systems are force, timing and spatial parameters. Different methods for assessing pressure are available, like a <b>pressure</b> <b>measurement</b> mat or walkway (longer in length to capture more foot strikes), as well as in-shoe <b>pressure</b> <b>measurement</b> systems (where sensors are placed inside the shoe). Many <b>pressure</b> <b>measurement</b> systems integrate with additional types of analysis systems, like motion capture, EMG or force plates to provide a comprehensive gait analysis.|$|R

Each stack had an intermediate distance of 500feet. The stacking was regulated by the air traffic control of Metropolitan Zone. Any aircraft entering the stack had to follow orders from air traffic control, which indicated their altitudes and route, and issued gates allowing the aircraft to enter and leave. Air traffic control issued atmospheric <b>pressure</b> <b>measurements</b> (QFE), allowing the aircraft to synchronise their altimeters.|$|E

These feature a long upwind section to accurately represent the wind speed and turbulence profile acting on the structure. Wind tunnel tests provide the necessary design <b>pressure</b> <b>measurements</b> in use of the dynamic analysis and control of tall buildings.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if ambulatory blood <b>pressure</b> <b>measurement</b> predicted total and cardiovascular mortality over and beyond clinic blood <b>pressure</b> <b>measurement</b> and other cardiovascular risk factors; 5292 untreated hypertensive patients referred to a single blood pressure clinic who had clinic and ambulatory blood <b>pressure</b> <b>measurement</b> at baseline were followed up in a prospective study of mortality outcome. Multiple Cox regression was used to model time to total and cause-specific mortality for ambulatory blood <b>pressure</b> <b>measurement</b> while adjusting for clinic blood <b>pressure</b> <b>measurement</b> and other risk factors at baseline. There were 646 deaths (of which 389 were cardiovascular) during a median follow-up period of 8. 4 years. With adjustment for gender, age, risk indices, and clinic blood pressure, higher mean values of ambulatory blood pressure were independent predictors for cardiovascular mortality. The relative hazard ratio for each 10 -mm Hg increase in systolic blood pressure was 1. 12 (1. 06 to 1. 18...|$|R
25|$|A few {{isolated}} outcropping seamounts that pierce {{through more}} than 200 m of impermeable sediments, are conduits that allow hydrologic exchange between the open ocean and the upper oceanic crust—the largest aquifer of the planet. The Cascadia Basin site {{is placed in the}} vicinity of several circulation obviation retrofit kit (CORK) borehole observatories, which are designed to study the hydrology, geochemistry and microbiology of the upper oceanic crust. CORKs are also being used to investigate changes in regional plate strain that are caused by earthquakes on the plate boundaries. The seafloor <b>pressure</b> <b>measurements</b> of the CORK borehole observatories constitute the center of a “tsunami-meter”, a network of several high precision, rapid sampling bottom pressure recorders (BPRs), that allows precise determination of deep water tsunami amplitude, direction of propagation, and speed.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, as {{the inaugural}} effort, the theme was simply ‘Awareness of high blood {{pressure}}’. The 2006 theme was ‘Treat to goal’, {{with a focus}} on keeping blood pressure under control. The recommended blood pressures are less than 140/90 mmHg for the general population and for the hypertensive population without any other complications, and less than 130/80 mmHg for those with diabetes mellitus or chronic kidney disease. These are the cut-off values recommended by international and Canadian guidelines. The 2007 WHD theme was ‘Healthy diet, healthy blood pressure’. Through such specific themes, the WHL intends to raise awareness not only of hypertension, but also of factors contributing to an increase in the incidence of hypertension and on ways to prevent it. In an effort to empower the public, the theme for 2008 was ‘Measure your blood pressure…at home’. Recent reports confirm the ease, accuracy and safety of blood <b>pressure</b> <b>measurements</b> using home monitors.|$|E

These criteria also require that the lumbar puncture is performed with patient lying sideways, as a lumbar puncture performed in the upright sitting position can lead to artificially high <b>pressure</b> <b>measurements.</b> Friedman and Jacobson also do not insist on MR venography for every patient; rather, this is only required in atypical cases (see [...] "diagnosis" [...] above).|$|E
