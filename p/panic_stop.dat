50|$|A {{rear-end}} collision (often called simply rear-end {{or in the}} UK a shunt) is a traffic accident wherein a vehicle (usually an automobile or a truck) crashes into the vehicle in front of it. Common {{factors that contribute to}} {{rear-end collision}}s include by driver inattention or distraction, tailgating, <b>panic</b> <b>stops,</b> and reduced traction due to weather or worn pavement. It may also be a rail accident wherein a train runs into the rear of a preceding train.|$|R

5000|$|Under extreme braking (like for {{instance}} in a <b>panic</b> <b>stop),</b> the already front heavy layout further reduces traction to the rear wheels. This results in disproportionate gripping forces focused at the front while the rear {{does not have enough}} weight to effectively use its brakes.

5000|$|The {{standard}} CLK chassis is used, {{and while}} the current version {{is not based on}} the new C-Class platform, the AMG version of the CLK offers some special undercarriage components. The four-wheel independent suspension is basically the same as the lesser CLK versions, but AMG fits higher-rated springs, tighter shock valving, larger diameter anti-roll bars and stiffer suspension bushings. The resulting firmer, more controlled ride is made even tighter by its high-performance ZR-rated low-profile tires. The brakes have been enhanced as well. The huge four-wheel discs are larger and thicker than the other CLKs, and the rear discs are specially vented to enhance cooling. An anti-lock braking system (ABS) is standard, while Brake Assist applies full braking force in <b>panic</b> <b>stop</b> faster than a driver could. It rides on AMG Monoblock alloy wheels, 7.5" [...] front and 8.5" [...] rear, shod with 225/45ZR17 and 245/40ZR17 Michelin Pilot Sport tires.|$|E

40|$|A new {{approach}} to high-speed, off-road navigation is presented. The interrelatedness of sensing horizon, prior map resolution, speed and efficiency is investigated over the space of off-road navigation. From this analysis, the space of off-road navigation is partitioned into three regimes (efficiency-limited, stoplimited and swerve-limited). Safeguarding through pre-planning and swerving emerges as an approach to achieve greater performance than possible with panic-stopping. The swerve-limited regime is characterized by high speeds that are achieved using plans derived in part from prior maps. Within the swerve-limited regime, sensing horizon is linearly proportional to robot speed. Thus an autonomous robot can operate at speeds beyond {{the point at which}} <b>panic</b> <b>stopping</b> is viable if it is safe to avoid obstacles by swerving. Navigating safely within this regime therefore explicitly requires some prior knowledge or assumption. The efficiency-limited regime is characterized by low speeds. Onboard sensing horizon is fixed given a specified prior map resolution and desired navigation efficiency. Typical applications include planetary exploration and mine-mapping For operation between the efficiency-limited and swerve-limited regimes, robot stopping distance limits speeds. In this stop-limited regime, sensing horizons increase quadratically as speed rises to ensure robot safety. Algorithms designed for navigation within the stop-limited regime generally require some cognizance of vehicle dynamics. Two implemented approaches to off-road navigation, one relevant for highspeed, long duration driving, and the other for planetary exploration, are contrasted and described in detail. These particular implementations exemplify the efficiency-limited and swerve-limited regimes and represent the state-of-theart in planetary exploration and high-speed navigation...|$|R
5000|$|In 2010, Edmunds.com {{also tested}} the {{stopping}} distances of a Toyota Camry SE V6 with a purposely stuck wide-open throttle. Their tests {{found that the}} car's brakes could override a stuck accelerator and bring the car to a stop. Although the transmission downshifted and the engine continued to propel the car, stopping distance compared [...] "favorably to a normal <b>panic</b> <b>stop</b> on wet asphalt." [...] Edmunds.com did note that switching to neutral was the best option, given that average drivers may not press the brakes as firmly, and lighter presses will simply wear the brakes down. The German Commission on Technical Compliance (TÜV) of Rheinland also tested the stopping distance of Toyota iQ, Aygo, Yaris, Auris, Verso, Avensis and RAV4 models. With the accelerator purposely jammed to 80% of maximum speed, each vehicle was able to brake safely to a halt. The TÜV findings indicated that each model met the legal requirements for deceleration and stopping distances, and that all Toyota models tested had brakes which could override a stuck accelerator.|$|E

50|$|Prior to the Panic of 1837, {{the banking}} system across the nation was {{expanding}} and greatly contributed to economic growth and development.

A bill to recharter the Second Bank of the United States failed to pass, after which the United States also faced a period of high inflation and deep depression. Two major legislative efforts attempted to reform the American banking system. New York passed a free banking system in 1838 that undertook long-term credit interest while the Louisiana Bank Act of 1842 passed the Forstall System. Edmund Forstall {{was the president of}} Citizens Bank of New Orleans, a legislator, and an agent of Baring Brothers. In 1842 he influenced Louisiana to require all banks to hold short-term self-extinguishing assets similar to the real bills principle in Britain.

50|$|Kommandant van Heerden, who {{has risen}} to Chief of Police of Piemburg through family {{connections}} rather than merit, is called out {{to deal with a}} strange murder case involving the eccentric British spinster, Miss Hazlestone. It appears that Miss Hazlestone has obliterated her black cook with a quadruple-barreled elephant gun. As a great believer in apartheid South Africa, van Heerden is initially willing to brush the incident under the carpet, until Miss Hazlestone reveals that she and the cook were former lovers who engaged in some extremely unseemly fantasies. In his <b>panic</b> to <b>stop</b> the truth getting out, van Heerden resorts to placing Miss Hazlestone under house arrest, calling in all the reinforcements he can to quarantine the area and placing his assistant, the profoundly stupid and bloodthirsty Konstabel Els, on guard with the elephant gun.

5000|$|Mustang Challenge: Reverse Flick: After Andrew reiterates {{the harsh}} {{penalties}} {{that a person}} would face for actually carrying out this trick while on the road (though adding that such techniques are an effective tool when done in safe conditions), the drivers each get a lesson from Philippe in how to unbalance the car's steering and then spin it around 180 degrees. They then have to spin the Mustang around in a confined space, with each driver getting five attempts. Daniella is first-up, and on her first attempt she <b>panics</b> and <b>stops</b> before ever reaching the turning area. On her second turn she crashes into the barrier leading into the turning area, but on her third attempt she manages to pass, earning only her second challenge pass for the season. Krystal, who is accompanied by Andrew in her run, after she and Steven had a physical altercation between challenges, passes on her first go, despite steering a little erratically while reversing, leaving Andrew {{more than a little}} concerned that Krystal might end up being the only viable graduate this episode. Tyler nearly passes on his first attempt, spinning the car around without hitting anything, but pushing the footbrake in the process. He's therefore made to carry out a second run, which this time he passes. Lou's first run ends in disaster, as she takes the turn too slowly and then panics and mistakenly hits the gas instead of the brake. She then fails her second run by hitting the entry lane barrier, but just barely passes on her third run, making this a rare challenge with a 100% success rate.|$|R
25|$|In the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, the {{military}} police took both combat and supporting positions. In May 1948, the service was divided into regional fronts. The northern front, headed by future chief officer Yosef Pressman, consisted of 15 military policemen, most of them former Notrim, and was based in the police compound in Afula. It moved to Nazareth when the city was conquered from Arab forces. Among others, the northern front's job was to deliver the Napoleonchik cannons, which turned the tide of several battles on the front. During Operation Brosh, a military police soldier managed to shoot down a Syrian plane using a Sten gun mounted on a jeep. The plane crashed near Ayelet HaShahar. The unit was also charged with <b>stopping</b> <b>panicked</b> Jewish residents of the Galilee from fleeing their homes, and Pressman personally stopped buses leaving Afula and Yavne'el, returning the men and evacuating {{the women and children}} to Haifa.
