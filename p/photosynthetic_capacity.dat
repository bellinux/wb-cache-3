25|$|The {{specialized}} {{structures of}} the plant reveal a very interesting coevolution and symbiosis between these two species. A recent study performed by Céline Leroy et al. (2008) revealed many characteristics that the plant has adapted to support the ants. First, the domatia are located next to the stems that the ants use for hunting. Second, they contain extrafloral nectaries and food bodies to feed the ants {{if they do not}} have other sources of food. Third, there are less chloroplasts found inside of the domatia, which means that it has a lower <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>capacity.</b> Fourth, stomata were found inside of the domatia, although at a lower density, possibly to capture the carbon dioxide from the ants’ respiration taking place inside. Finally, there was a greater deposit of cellulose found in the domatia, which would result in a thicker cell wall and a more rigid surface to support the weight of the ants. These findings show that the areas destined to become domatia are inherited and a result of coevolution; they were solely produced to support this specific species of ant.|$|E

The Apicomplexa, a phylum of obligate parasitic protozoa including the causative agents of malaria (Plasmodium spp.), toxoplasmosis (Toxoplasma gondii), and many other human or animal diseases also harbor a complex plastid (although this organelle has been lost in some apicomplexans, such as Cryptosporidium parvum, which causes cryptosporidiosis).

Rodermel, M. S. Abbott, L. Bogorad [1988] Cell 55 : 673 - 681). In this report {{we examine the}} impact of Rubisco loss on photosynthesis during tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) leaf development. <b>Photosynthetic</b> <b>capacities</b> are depressed in the antisense leaves, but the patterns of change in photosynthetic rates during the development of these leaves are similar to those in wild-type plants: after attaining a maximum in young leaves, <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>capacities</b> undergo a prolonged senescence decline in older leaves. The alterations in <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>capacities</b> in both the wild type and mutant are closely correlated with changes in Rubisco activity and content. During wild-type leaf development, Rubisco accumulation is regulated by coordinate changes in RbcS and rbcL transcript accumulation, whereas in the antisense leaves, Rubisco content is a function of RbcS, but not rbcL, transcript abundance. This indicates that large subunit protein production is controlled posttranscriptionally in the mutants. The antisense leaves accumulate near-normal levels of chlorophyll and representative photosynthetic proteins throughout development, suggesting that photosynthetic gene expression is not feedback regulated by Rubisco abundance. Considered together, the data in this paper indicate that leaf developmental programs are generally insensitive to sharp reductions in Rubisco content and emphasize the metabolic plasticity of plant cells in achieving optimal photosynthetic rates...|$|R

2500|$|When {{molecular}} oxygen is the substrate, {{the products of}} the oxygenase reaction are phosphoglycolate and 3-phosphoglycerate. Phosphoglycolate is recycled through a sequence of reactions called photorespiration, which involves enzymes and cytochromes located in the mitochondria and peroxisomes (this is a case of metabolite repair). In this process, two molecules of phosphoglycolate are converted to one molecule of carbon dioxide and one molecule of 3-phosphoglycerate, which can reenter the Calvin cycle. Some of the phosphoglycolate entering this pathway can be retained by plants to produce other molecules such as glycine. At ambient levels of carbon dioxide and oxygen, the ratio of the reactions is about 4 to 1, which results in a net carbon dioxide fixation of only 3.5. [...] Thus, the inability of the enzyme to prevent the reaction with oxygen greatly reduces the <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>capacity</b> of many plants. Some plants, many algae, and photosynthetic bacteria have overcome this limitation by devising means to increase the concentration of carbon dioxide around the enzyme, including [...] carbon fixation, crassulacean acid metabolism, and the use of pyrenoid.|$|E
2500|$|Light {{provides}} the solar energy required {{to drive the}} process of photosynthesis, the major energy source of lentic systems.

Here, we present data on the water transport properties of Chusquea ramosissima and Merostachys claussenii, monocarpic bamboo grasses native to the subtropical Atlantic forests of Argentina. C. ramosissima and M. claussenii differed in their growth form and exhibited contrasting strategies of water transport. Maximum xylem hydraulic conductivity of C. ramosissima culms was 2 -fold higher than that of M. claussenii. C. ramosissima cavitated at relatively high water potentials (50 % loss of conductivity at ≥ 1 MPa), whereas M. claussenii was more drought tolerant (50 % loss at ≤ 3 MPa). Both species exhibited significant loss of hydraulic conductivity during the day, which was reversed overnight due to the generation of root pressure. The <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>capacities</b> of both bamboo species, estimated based on electron transport rates, were moderate, reflecting both the large amount of leaf area supported by culms and diurnal loss of hydraulic conductivity due to cavitation. Leaf hydraulic conductance was also relatively low for both species, congruent with their modest <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>capacities.</b> Within its native range, C. ramosissima is highly invasive due to its ability to colonize and persist in both forest gaps and land cleared for agriculture.

We characterized variations in the carbon isotope composition (C- 13) of leaves, current year wood and holocellulose (as proxies for water use efficiency, WUE) among six poplar genotypes in a short-rotation plantation. Values of C- 13 (wood) and C- 13 (holocellulose) were tightly and positively correlated, but the offset varied significantly among genotypes (0. 79 - 1. 01). Leaf phenology was strongly correlated with C- 13, and genotypes with a longer growing season showed a higher WUE. In contrast, traits related to growth and carbon uptake were poorly linked to C- 13. Trees growing on former pasture with higher N-availability displayed higher C- 13 as compared with trees growing on former cropland. The positive relationships between C- 13 (leaf) and leaf N suggested that spatial variations in WUE over the plantation were mainly driven by an N-related effect on <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>capacities.</b> The very coherent genotype ranking obtained with C- 13 in the different tree compartments has some practical outreach. Because WUE remains largely uncoupled from growth in poplar plantations, there is potential to identify genotypes with satisfactory growth and higher WUE.

40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} shown that {{temperate}} and boreal forests are limited by nitrogen (N) availability. However, few studies have provided a detailed account of how carbon (C) acquisition of such forests reacts to increasing N supply. We combined measurements of needle-scale biochemical <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>capacities</b> and continuous observations of shoot-scale photosynthetic performance from several canopy positions with simple mechanistic modelling to evaluate the photosynthetic responses of mature N-poor boreal Pinus sylvestris to N fertilization. The measurements were carried out in August 2013 on 90 -year-old pine trees growing at Rosinedalsheden research site in northern Sweden. In spite of a nearly doubling of needle N content in response to the fertilization, no effect on the long-term shoot-scale C uptake was recorded. This lack of N-effect was due to strong light limitation of photosynthesis in all investigated canopy positions. The effect of greater N availability on needle <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>capacities</b> was also constrained by development of foliar P deficiency following N addition. Thus, P deficiency and accumulation of N in arginine appeared to contribute towards lower shoot-scale nitrogen-use efficiency in the fertilized trees, thereby additionally constraining tree-scale responses to increasing N availability. On the whole our study suggests that the C uptake response of the studied N-poor boreal P. sylvestris stand to enhanced N availability is constrained by the efficiency with which the additional N is utilized. This efficiency, in turn, depends on the ability of the trees to use the greater N availability for additional light capture. For stands that have not reached canopy closure, increase in leaf area following N fertilization would be the most effective way for improving light capture and C uptake while for mature stands an increased leaf area may have a rather limited effect on light capture owing to increased self-shading. This raises the question if N limitation in boreal forests acts primarily by constraining growth of young stands while the commonly recorded increase in stem growth of mature stands following N addition is primarily the result of altered allocation and only to a limited extent the result of increased stand C-capture...|$|R
40|$|We {{analyzed}} {{the importance of}} shoot structural and leaf physiological characteristics in determining interspecific differences in whole-shoot carbon gain in a tallgrass meadow. Canopy structure, aboveground mass, leaf nitrogen content, and leaf photosynthesis were determined for individual shoots of the dominant grass Miscanthus sinensis (a C. species) and for four forb species (all C- 3). These data were used to calculate net daily carbon gain of individual shoots in absolute terms, per unit leaf area, and per unit aboveground biomass (P-mass). P-mass in turn, {{is an important component}} of growth per unit mass (relative growth rate, RGR). Miscanthus shoots had a higher total carbon gain and a higher P-mass than shoots of the other species. The greater P-mass of Miscanthus shoots was not because they captured more light per unit mass (Phi(mass)), but because they achieved higher rates of photosynthesis per unit of absorbed light (P-light, P-mass = Phi(mass) x P-light). The latter was mainly due to the higher leaf <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>capacities</b> per unit nitrogen associated with the C, pathway of this species. Among the forbs, Potentilla freyniana had the highest P-mass, even though it was the shortest, most shaded species in the stand. This high P was because its shoots had relatively high leaf-area-to-mass ratios (resulting in high and low rates of dark respiration (resulting in high P-light). Sensitivity analysis of our model showed that relative to the other species these traits enable Potentilla to achieve high carbon gain in the shade but not at high light. It also showed that the traits of Miscanthus enable it to achieve relatively high carbon gain at high light but not at low light. Another sensitivity analysis revealed that an increase in leaf area and associated light capture of shoots, while keeping their total canopy nitrogen constant and thus reducing their leaf N content and associated <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>capacities,</b> reduced the estimated carbon gain for most of the shoots in the stand. These results indicate that interspecific differences in carbon gain per unit mass in this stand were more closely associated with differences in leaf physiology than with structural differences that determine light capture...|$|R

We assessed these contributions at the branch and tree scales in two apple cultivars (Malus x domestica Borkh. 'Fuji' and 'Braeburn') with contrasting architectures, by estimating their branch and tree capacities and comparing them with outputs from a radiation absorption, transpiration and photosynthesis (RATP) functional-structural plant model (FSPM). The structures of three 8 -year-old trees of each cultivar were digitized to obtain 3 -D representations of foliage geometry. Within-tree foliage distribution was compared with shoot demography, number of leaves per shoot and mean individual leaf area. We estimated branch and tree light interception from silhouette to total leaf area ratios (STAR), transpiration from sap flux measurements and net photosynthetic rates by the branch bag method. Based {{on a set of}} parameters we previously established for both cultivars, the outputs of the RATP model were tested against STAR values, sap fluxes and photosynthetic measurements. The RATP model was then used to virtually switch foliage distribution or leaf functions (stomatal and photosynthetic properties), or both, between cultivars and to evaluate the effects on branch and tree light interception, transpiration and <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>capacities</b> in each cultivar. 'Fuji' trees had a higher proportion of leaf area borne on long shoots, fewer leaves per unit shoot length and a larger individual leaf area than 'Braeburn' trees.

Transpiration and photosynthetic rates were significantly higher in 'Fuji' than in 'Braeburn'. Branch heterogeneity was greater in 'Braeburn' than in 'Fuji'. An analysis of the virtual switches of foliage distribution or leaf function showed that differences in leaf spatial distribution and functions had additive effects that accounted for the lower transpiration and photosynthetic rates of branches and trees of 'Braeburn' compared with 'Fuji'.
