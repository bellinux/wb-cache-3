50|$|Papain is a {{protease}} {{obtained from}} the latex of {{the fruit of the}} <b>papaya</b> <b>tree.</b> It has been used (without regulation) for wound debridement for many years, but in the USA in 2008 it was brought under regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and removed from sale for this purpose, following reports of adverse effects. On the other hand, recent research has been exploring new ways of administering papain for wound debridement.|$|E
50|$|Papain {{is usually}} {{produced}} as a crude, dried material by collecting the latex from {{the fruit of}} the <b>papaya</b> <b>tree.</b> The latex is collected after scoring the neck of the fruit, where it may either dry on the fruit or drip into a container. This latex is then further dried. It is now classified as a dried, crude material. A purification step is necessary to remove contaminating substances. This purification consists of the solubilization and extraction of the active papain enzyme system through a government-registered process. This purified papain may be supplied as powder or as liquid.|$|E

40|$|The giant African snail (Achatina fulica) is {{a widely}} {{introduced}} invasive land snail species, and is considered an important agricultural pest in several {{regions of the world}} including in the south Pacific. In Samoa, A. fulica is a major pest that feeds on various crops of economic importance, including papaya. This study investigated the feeding strategies of A. fulica and the damage caused to papaya through field and laboratory trials in Samoa. Unripe mature fruits were sampled to assess snail damage. Results showed heavy snail infestation; on average more than two snails were recovered per <b>papaya</b> <b>tree.</b> The mean number of snails per plant decreased with the height of the plant. Snails inflicted primary damage through feeding that led to abrasions on more than 80 % of fruits and indirectly caused fungal contamination through their faeces (93 %) and slimy marks. Snail feeding damage induced premature ripening of papaya fruits. In the host choice tests, the snails preferred to feed on papaya than tomatoes; however, they showed equal preference to papaya and cabbage in the field trails. Smaller snails were voracious and ate more papaya leaves per unit of body weight compared with larger snails. Snails were found to be good climbers, and 60 % of the snails released near the <b>papaya</b> <b>tree</b> trunk were able to reach the papaya fruits on the tree.

40|$|Entre os fatores que limitam a produtividade do mamoeiro, destacam-se a disponibilidade de água e nutrientes minerais. Assim, o ajuste de uma lâmina de irrigação adequada para a cultura exige também o monitoramento do estado nutricional das plantas. O objetivo desse trabalho foi avaliar a resposta das diferentes lâminas de irrigação (0; 40; 80; 120; 160; 200 e 240 % da ETo) sobre os teores de nutrientes nas folhas do mamoeiro 'Improved Sunrise Solo 72 / 12 '. As avaliações dos teores de nutrientes no mamoeiro foram {{realizadas}} em junho de 1999, retirando-se amostras de duas plantas de cada tratamento, das quais foram analisados, separadamente, o limbo e o pecíolo foliar. Os resultados indicam que os teores de N, P, K, Ca, Mg, B, Na, Fe e Cu, no limbo, e os teores de N, P, Ca, Mg, S, B, Na e Fe, no pecíolo, variaram significativamente com a lâmina de água aplicada. A concentração desses nutrientes em função das lâminas de irrigação foi explicada, na maioria dos casos, por regressões lineares, decrescentes para N, K e Fe, e crescente para os demais nutrientes. A variação significativa dos teores de nutrientes, em função da irrigação, mostra a necessidade de estudos que permitam o ajuste da adubação à lâmina de irrigação empregada. Among {{the factors}} that limit the productivity of the <b>papaya</b> <b>tree,</b> stand out the availability of water and mineral nutrients. Therefore, the adjustment of the appropriate irrigation depth for the culture also demands the accompaniment of the state nutritional of the plants.

The evaluations of the amounts of nutrients in the <b>papaya</b> <b>tree</b> were accomplished in June of 1999, by removing samples of two plants of each treatment, from which were analyzed, separately, the leaf blade and the petiole leaf. The results showed that the amounts of N, P, K, Ca, Mg, B, Na, Fe and Cu in the leaf blade, and the amounts of N, P, Ca, Mg, S, B, Na and Fe in the petiole leaf, varied significantly with the depth of applied water. The concentration of those nutrients, as a function of irrigation depths, was explained, in most of the events, by linear regressions, decreasing for N, K and Fe, and increasing for the other nutrients. The significant variation of the amounts of nutrients, as a function of irrigation, shows the need of studies that allow the adjustment of the manuring to the employed irrigation depth...|$|E

40|$|A 22. 137 kDa protein {{constituent}} {{of fresh}} latex was isolated {{both from the}} latex of regularly damaged <b>papaya</b> <b>trees</b> and from a commercially available papain preparation. The protein was purified up to apparent homogeneity and was shown to be absent in the latex of <b>papaya</b> <b>trees</b> {{that had never been}} previously mechanically injured. This suggests that the protein belongs to pathogenesis-related protein family, as expected for several other protein constituents of papaya latex. The protein was identified as a thaumatin-like protein (class 5 of the pathogenesis-related proteins) {{on the basis of its}} partial amino acid sequence. By sequence analysis of the Carica genome, three different forms of thaumatin-like protein were identified, where the latex constituent belongs to a well-known form, allowing the molecular modeling of its spatial structure. The papaya latex thaumatin-like protein was further characterized. The protein appears to be stable in the pH interval from 2 to 10 and resistant to chemical denaturation by guanidium chloride, with a Δ Gwater 0 of 15. 2 kcal/mol and to proteolysis by the four papaya cysteine proteinases.

In the microsporogenesis, the microspore mother cells or the meiocytes underwent meiosis giving rise to the tetrads that were enclosed by the calose. Later, the tetrads were released by the dissolution of the calose by calase activity and microspores underwent mitosis. Microgametogenesis was characterized by asymmetrical mitotic division of each microspore giving rise to bi-nucleate pollen grains.

40|$|Among the {{different}} experimental agents that act upon the endochondral growth of laboratory animals. crude papain {{seems to be}} one of the most powerful (Hulth 1958). Papain acts rapidly on the cartilage and, when injected repeatedly, causes premature ossification of the epiphysial lines. Other factors that retard the longitudinal growth are endocrine disorders, such as those caused by hypophysectomy or thyroidectomy, and administration of cortisone. Younganimals fed on diets that are generallyor specificallydeficient also show retarded growth. PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS Papain is a proteolytic enzyme obtained from the latex of the carica <b>papaya</b> <b>tree.</b> It is available commercially as an impure powder (crude papain) and at present several chemical laboratories produce it in purified crystalline form. The enzyme requires free sulphydryl groups for activity-that is, it is active in reduced form. Typical activators are hydrogen sulphide, hydrocyanic acid, cysteine and versene. The activation is reversed by typical thiol-combining agents like iodo-acetate, p-chloromercuribenzoate, and by oxidising agents (iodine, hydrogen peroxide and metals) (Kimmel and Smith 1954).

40|$|The {{effects of}} routine {{mechanical}} wounding for latex collection from unripe {{fruits of the}} tropical Carica <b>papaya</b> <b>tree</b> were investigated.

Repeated mechanical wounding was found to profoundly affect the protein content of the latex inducing, among others, activation of papain. Regularly tapped latexes also accumulated several low molecular weight proteins not yet identified, as well as three proteins identified as a trypsin inhibitor, a class-II chitinase and a glutaminyl cyclase on the basis of their enzymatic or inhibitory activities and chromatographic elution profiles. This latter was found here, for the first time, to be a wound-induced protein. The roles of these proteins in the plant defense mechanism are discussed. Journal ArticleResearch Support, U. S.
