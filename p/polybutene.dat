40|$|In {{this chapter}} tree {{squirrels}} {{are divided into}} three groups: large tree squirrels, pine squirrels, and flying squirrels. Large tree squirrels include fox (Sciurus niger), eastern gray (Sciurus carolinensis), western gray (Sciurus griseus), and tassel-eared (Sciurus aberti) squirrels. Fox squirrels (Fig. 1) measure 18 to 27 inches (46 to 69 cm) from nose to tip of tail. They weigh about 1 3 / 4 pounds (787 g) to 2 1 / 4 pounds (1, 012 g). Color varies greatly, from all black in Florida to silver gray with a white belly in Maryland. Georgia fox squirrels usually have a black face. Ohio and Michigan fox squirrels are grizzled gray-brown above with an orange underside. Sometimes several color variations occur in a single population. Eastern gray squirrels are also variable in color. Some have a distinct reddish cast to their gray coat. Black ones are common in some northern parts of their range. Eastern gray squirrels measure 16 to 20 inches (41 to 51 cm). They weigh from 1 1 / 4 pounds (567 g) to 1 3 / 4 pounds (794 g). The western gray squirrel is gray above with sharply distinct white underparts. Size {{is similar to that}} of the eastern gray squirrel. Tassel-eared squirrels are similar in size to gray squirrels and have several color phases. The most common is gray above with a broad reddish band down the back. Black tufted ears are their most distinguishing characteristic (the tufts are larger in winter, about 1 inch [2. 5 cm]). There are two species of pine squirrels: the red squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) and Douglas pine squirrel (Tamiasciurus douglasii). Pine squirrels are 10 to 15 inches (25 to 38 cm) in total length and weigh 1 / 3 to 2 / 3 pounds (151 to 303 g). Red squirrels are red-brown above with white underparts. Douglas squirrels are gray-brown above with yellowish underparts. Both species have small ear tufts and often have a black stripe separating the dark upper color from the light belly. Two species of flying squirrels occur in North America. The southern flying squirrel (Glaucomys volans) is 8 to 10 inches (20 to 25 cm) long. The northern flying squirrel (Glaucomys sabrinus) averages 2 inches (5 cm) longer. It can be difficult to distinguish between the two; both may be various shades of gray or brown above and lighter below. A sharp line of demarcation separates the darker upper color from the lighter belly. The most distinctive characteristics of flying squirrels are the broad webs of skin connecting the fore and hind legs at the wrists, and the distinctly flattened tail. Exclusion:Install sheet metal bands on isolated trees to prevent damage to developing nuts. Close external openings to buildings to stop damage to building interiors. Place an 18 -inch (46 -cm) section of 4 -inch (10 -cm) diameter plastic pipe or a one-way door over openings to allow squirrels to leave and prevent them from returning. Plastic tubes on wires may prevent access to buildings. Cultural Methods: Remove selected trees or their branches to prevent access to structures.

50|$|Unlike copper, {{aluminium}} has {{a tendency}} to creep or cold-flow under pressure, so older plain steel screw clamped connections could become loose over time. Newer electrical devices designed for aluminum conductors have features intended to compensate for this effect. Unlike copper, aluminium forms an insulating oxide layer on the surface.

The property is very valuable for a variety of applications. For smoke inhibition in two stroke engine fuels, the lubricant can degrade at temperatures below the combustion temperature. For electrical lubricants and carriers which might be subject to overheating or fires, <b>polybutene</b> does not result in increased insulation (accelerating the overheating) or conductive carbon deposits.|$|E

50|$|The largest {{commercial}} {{application of}} cationic polymerization {{is in the}} production of polyisobutylene (PIB) products which include <b>polybutene</b> and butyl rubber. These polymers have a variety of applications from adhesives and sealants to protective gloves and pharmaceutical stoppers. The reaction conditions for the synthesis of each type of isobutylene product vary depending on the desired molecular weight and what type(s) of monomer(s) is used. The conditions most commonly used to form low molecular weight (5-10 x 104 Da) polyisobutylene are initiation with AlCl3, BF3, or TiCl4 at a temperature range of −40 to 10 °C. These low molecular weight polyisobutylene polymers are used for caulking and as sealants. High molecular weight PIBs are synthesized at much lower temperatures of −100 to −90 °C and in a polar medium of methylene chloride. These polymers are used to make uncrosslinked rubber products and are additives for certain thermoplasts. Another characteristic of high molecular weight PIB is its low toxicity which allows it {{to be used as a}} base for chewing gum.

Some researchers have criticized the UL listing/tests for this wire connector, and there have been reported problems with tests (without pre-twisting) and installations. However, it is unknown if the reported installation problems were associated with unqualified persons attempting these repairs, or not using recommended special installation procedures (such as abrading and pre-twisting the wires as recommended by the CPSC for older aluminum wire, or at least pre-twisting the wires as recommended by Ideal for their connectors).|$|E
40|$|The {{field of}} {{centrifugal}} microfluidics {{has evolved over}} the last several decades to allow implementation of complex biological and chemical assays on Lab-on-Disc (LOD) platforms. Present study describes the use of polymer <b>polybutene</b> for tuning hydrophobic siphons and for liquid volume definition on a centrifugal microfluidic platform. Both the siphon tuning and the volume definition steps are carried out by generating negative pressure that results from the volume expansion caused by the transfer of <b>polybutene</b> from a dedicated chamber into a secondary reservoir via a connecting siphon. The hydrophobic valve of the chamber that holds <b>polybutene</b> bursts open at specific angular velocities that depend on the height and density of the liquid column. Thus, the parameters of siphon activation can be adjusted by tuning the burst angular velocity of the valve that is driven by filling the tuning reservoir with a specific volume of <b>polybutene.</b> The same disc construction can be utilized to provide volume definition functionality to transfer liquids from one reservoir to another reservoir in as many fractions as there are immiscible liquids of different densities in the tuning chamber. The presented work also demonstrates the use of <b>polybutene</b> in sealing fluidic chambers to improve heating efficiency and to minimize evaporation during thermal cycling required for applications such as PCR amplification.

40|$|International audienceThe {{rheological}} behavior of two series of model suspensions containing the same glass fibers in a Newtonian <b>polybutene</b> {{and in a}} Boger fluid has also been investigated. The steady-state shear viscosity of both supensions increased with fiber content, but the suspensions in the Boger fluid became shear thinning. Both types of suspension exhibited non-negligible normal stresses. The steady-state viscosity and normal stress difference of the supensions in the <b>polybutene</b> are well predicted by the Lipscomb ~ 1987 ! equation coupled with the Folgar–Tucker ~ 1984 ! model. Both types of fiber suspensions were shown to exhibit shear and normal stress overshoots in stress growth experiments. Under flow reversal, a shear stress overshoot was observed at a larger deformation compared to the primary overshoot. The reverse overshoot {{has been attributed to}} tumbling of fibers that are not totally aligned in the flow direction even after a very long time. When the flow was reversed, the normal stress difference took initially mimimum values ~negative values in the <b>polybutene</b> case! and then depicted a smaller positive overshoot before reaching a steady-state value. The normal stress undershoot has been attributed to a transient fiber-oriented structure. The shape and the magnitude of these overshoots depend on the fiber content, nature of the matrix, and time delay between consecutive experiments...|$|E
40|$|Numerous {{models have}} been {{developed}} to describe the viscosity and rheology of lubricants in elastohydrodynamic (EHD) lubrication, but little experimental and theoretical work has been done on the flow of lubricants. Due to the high pressures in a tribological contact it is likely that lubricants may undergo structural changes, which would significantly affect their flow. Photobleached-fluorescence imaging velocimetry was applied to a glass-glass EHD contact, lubricated with the oligomer <b>polybutene,</b> which was doped with fluorescent dye. The technique involved tagging a volume inside the contact, by making it dark compared to its surroundings. A model was developed to solve for the through-thickness velocity profile using the experimental data and the technique was validated experimentally using a parallel plate Couette setup. Velocity profiles of <b>polybutene</b> in an EHD contact were measured under various conditions. Three distinct rheological responses could be observed. At low pressures, the velocity profile was mostly linear. At a critical pressure, a low shear rate plug formed in the centre of the film, possibly due to pressure-induced glass transition of the lubricant. The application of a low surface energy coating caused the lubricant to slip at the interface, depending on the applied pressure. The velocimetry studies were supported by film thickness and friction measurements. Laser-induced fluorescence was used to measure the film thickness, showing that the plug flow of <b>polybutene</b> coincided with an anomalous increase in film thickness, while the occurrence of boundary slip resulted in reduced film thickness. Friction measurements showed that plug flow had negligible effects on friction. Boundary slip however caused a decrease in friction (up to 70...|$|E

Comparison of the images with Connolly surfaces enabled identification of which plane was observed in the AFM images, with greater accuracy than conclusions drawn {{on the basis of}} surface feature measurement alone. In particular, the results from the experiments with <b>polybutene</b> show that for samples aged sufficiently so that the stable phase is expected in the bulk, this phase is also stable on the surface. The samples were aged sufficiently to ensure that the bulk would be in the stable phase. It is found that this phase is also stable on the surface. Additionally, the annealing behaviour of once folded crystals of the long-chain alkane, C sub 1 sub 6 sub 2 H sub 3 sub 2 sub 6, is examined in situ, in real time, by atomic force microscopy. Regions of thickening material can be clearly seen in the height images. The formation of dendritic patterns is observed and holes are often formed at the growth front. These holes do not form after comparable treatment of initially extended chain crystals of the same material. The heating of the extended chain crystals shows a highly mobile phase just before melting. The fact that no holes or dendritic patterns emerge before the melting of the extended chain crystal leads us to attribute this phenomenon to the thickening process. The holes are formed at the growth front as a means of relieving the strain. The formation of the dendritic structures is also a result of strain: as the strain builds up in the current growth direction, so the growth changes to an alternate crystallographic direction...|$|E
40|$|Viscosity in {{particles}} {{consisting of}} secondary organic material (SOM) has recently become {{an area of}} research focus, since information on viscosity is needed to predict {{the environmental impacts of}} SOM particles. Recently Renbaum-Wolff et al. (2013 a) developed a poke-flow technique that was combined with simulations of fluid flow to constrain the viscosities of SOM samples of 1 – 5 mg mass, roughly the maximum that may be collected from environmental chambers or flow tubes on a reasonable timescale. The current manuscript expands on the initial validation experiments carried out by Renbaum-Wolff et al. First, the poke-flow technique combined with simulations of fluid flow was used to determine the viscosity of sucrose–water particles over a relatively wide range of relative humidities (RHs). The lower and upper limits of viscosity at 59 % RH were 1. 0 × 10 1 and 1. 6 × 10 4 Pa s, whilst at 37 % RH the corresponding values were 7. 2 × 10 4 and 4. 7 × 10 6 Pa s, respectively. The results are in good agreement with recent measurements by Quintas et al. (2006) and Power et al. (2013). Second, the approach was used to determine the viscosity of two <b>polybutene</b> standards. The simulated lower and upper limits of viscosity for standard # 1 was 2. 0 × 10 2 and 1. 2 × 10 4 Pa s, whilst for standard # 2 the corresponding values were 3. 1 × 10 2 and 2. 4 × 10 4 Pa s. These values are in good agreement with values reported by the manufacturer. The results for both the sucrose–water particles and the <b>polybutene</b> standards show that the poke-flow technique combined with simulations of fluid flow is capable of providing both lower and upper limits of viscosity that are consistent with literature or measured values when the viscosity of the particles are in the range of ≈ 5 × 10 2 to ≈ 3 × 10 6 Pa s...|$|E

These polymeric bijels (bicontinuous interfacially jammed emulsion gels) were composed of polystyrene oligomer, <b>polybutene</b> and fluorescent hydrophobic silica nanoparticles. A micron-sized cocontinuous morphology was stabilized by a monolayer of silica nanoparticles at the interface. Real-time observation of coalescence dynamics in co-continuous polymer blends stabilized by interfacial particles was {{for the first time}} achieved via laser scanning confocal microscopy. We demonstrated that suppression of coalescence arises from coverage of interfaces by nanoparticles. Furthermore, by combining confocal microscopy with rheology, we correlated the rheological response of a cocontinuous structure with its morphology change. We found that the rheological behavior can be attributed to competition between interface shrinkage and particle network formation. In addition, we showed that a particle scaffold is maintained even after the remixing of two polymer phases above the spinodal point.

Diblock copolymers were synthesized using methoxy poly(ethylene glycol) 1100 as the hydrophilic block and poly(propylene oxide), <b>poly(butene</b> oxide), and poly(hexene oxide) as the hydrophobic moieties. The ratios of hydrophile to hydrophobe were 1 : 2, 1 : 1, and 2 : 1. In the cases of tri- and tetrablock copolymers, the total hydrophile to hydrophobe ratio was kept constant, at 1 : 1, and the same hydrophilic block was used each time. The ratios of hydrophobicmoieties were varied among the tri- and tetrablock copolymers (which contained two and three types of hydrophobic units respectively). These products self-assemble in aqueous solution to give micelles or irregular aggregates with very broad size distributions. Dynamic light scattering and small-angle X-ray scattering were used as tools to determine the size and structure of these self-assembled micelles.
