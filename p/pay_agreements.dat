40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} wage and price setting {{behaviour}} of Lithuanian firms {{on the basis}} of an ad hoc survey “On Price and Wage Setting” undertaken by the Bank of Lithuania. The paper provides survey evidence on the frequency of wage and price changes. The frequency of wage changes turns out to be higher in firms that apply collective <b>pay</b> <b>agreements,</b> while the frequency of price changes appears to be positively affected by the market competition. Labour cost share is not found to be significant in making the impact on the frequency of price changes. This paper also investigates the role of certain technological, institutional and other factors in shaping firms’ responses to a negative demand shock, an intermediate input cost shock and a wage shock. A higher labour cost share is found to increase the likelihood of a price increase following a wage shock. Flexible wage components mitigate firms’ responses to a slowdown in demand and an intermediate input cost increase. The behaviour of firms following the investigated shocks is also affected by the level of competition. The role of collective <b>pay</b> <b>agreements</b> appears to be rather limited in shaping responses of firms to the shocks.

30|$|These {{ideas were}} {{developed}} more fully {{in a study}} of the use of separate zones of operation for different workplace institutions gives workers voice while still protecting employers’ interests by stabilising the distribution of control (Marsden 1978). Empirical corroboration for this division of responsibilities can be found in Hübler and Jirjahn (2003) in which they show that works councils in firms that are covered by a collective <b>pay</b> <b>agreement</b> increase productivity but not wages, whereas those in firms without a collective agreement raise wages.|$|R
30|$|Furthermore, we {{find that}} the {{probability}} of applying for short-time work significantly increases with the shares of both full-time and part-time permanent contracts vis-à-vis fixed-term contracts (the reference group in the regression), a result also reported for German establishments by Boeri and Bruecker (2011) and Crimmann et al. (2010). However, unlike these two studies, we also find that in Luxembourg, firms are more likely to apply for STW if they are bound by collective <b>pay</b> <b>agreements.</b> Taken together, we interpret this as a sign that firms with less flexible contractual arrangements are more constrained in carrying out adjustments through the extensive margin and therefore more likely to apply for short-time work. This is also consistent with the probability of applying for short-time work being lower among multi-establishment firms or firms with a lower share of permanent employees, indicators that can be interpreted as mirroring the internal flexibility of such firms.|$|E
30|$|Using {{the same}} dataset, Crimmann et al. (2010) {{turn to the}} {{question}} of firm selection into short-time work, or the extensive margin of participation. They find that, unlike in 2003, firms taking up short-time work in 2009 were less likely to have high shares of qualified or university-trained employees. They point to the specific nature of the 2008 – 2009 recession as a possible explanation, since it hit exporting manufacturing firms particularly hard and presumably these had large shares of non-specialised, blue-collar workers. Most of their other evidence also confirms Boeri and Bruecker’s (2011) findings on the intensive margin of take-up. These include a positive effect of establishment size and deteriorating performance (past profitability, future expectations) on the likelihood of using short-time work. In addition, flexible arrangements, such as part-time, fixed-term and agency contracts, tend to reduce the probability of participation. Exporting establishments {{are also more likely to}} participate in short-time work, even after controlling for other factors. Finally, they find no significant impact from the application of collective <b>pay</b> <b>agreements.</b>|$|E
30|$|Short-time work in Luxembourg is {{concentrated}} in the manufacturing sector, in which 1.5 % to 4.9 % of total jobs were saved through short-time work, {{depending on the size}} class and period. The likelihood that a Luxembourg firm applied for or used short-time work is higher for single establishment firms and firms reporting negative impact of demand volatility/uncertainty and customers’ ability to pay on their activity. In addition, the likelihood of the use of short-time work increases with the share of permanent employees and the degree of export orientation. Taken at face value, the results suggest that STW is primarily requested and used by firms facing demand fluctuations or uncertainty rather than a demand level shock. Furthermore, STW is used by firms with high levels of firm-specific human capital and firms constrained by collective <b>pay</b> <b>agreements,</b> and thereby helps to avoid costly and inefficient separations of employees. Altogether, this suggests that, in Luxembourg, STW is used as intended; we do not find evidence pointing towards STW use impeding structural adjustments to lasting negative demand shocks.|$|E

30|$|There is some {{literature}} analyzing {{the relationship between}} education attainment and wages with particular focus {{on the role of}} cohort size (e.[*]g. Freeman 1979; Welsh 1979; Berger 1983; Fertig and Schmidt 2004; Morin 2015; Moffat and Roth 2016). The key assumption of the studies is that workers of different ages or experiences are only imperfectly substitutable; therefore, an increase in the size of a specific experience-education group will mainly affect the wages of workers in this group. Empirical evidence in favor of this hypothesis is given by, e.[*]g. Freeman (1979), Wright (1991) or Morin (2015) besides others. However, for Germany the effects may be less clear due to opposing effects of wage rigidities and the bargaining process between employer associations and unions as noted by Fertig and Schmidt (2004). While changes in cohort size may result in education-experience specific unemployment in face of rigid wages, larger cohorts may possess a greater bargaining power, which mitigates the expected negative effect of cohort size. The decreasing level of collective <b>pay</b> <b>agreements</b> in the German economy overall and particularly for higher-skilled workers over the years of analysis may therefore point towards lower wages due to larger relative cohorts.|$|E

30|$|Next, in {{line with}} the {{descriptive}} results shown in Table  2, foreign-owned firms seem to be affected less by rises in the minimum wage and are less likely to find any of the adjustment channels relevant, especially the prices, non-labour costs and productivity channels. Institutional features of the labour market, {{such as the use of}} a collective <b>pay</b> <b>agreement,</b> tend to increase the relevance of certain adjustment channels, but only in the full country sample (Table  6). The significance is mainly driven by the strong effect in Hungary and Romania. Binding terms in collective agreements can pose additional restrictions on activity and force firms to compensate for rises in the minimum wage by raising prices and cutting non-labour costs and employment in these countries. However, if all the channels are included in the estimation, and so the sample is restricted to the Baltic countries and Poland (Table  5), the marginal effect of collective agreements becomes statistically insignificant.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{provides}} {{an analysis of}} pay developments in the heritage sector since the introduction of delegated pay in 1996. The research conducted was based upon the study of documentary sources (<b>pay</b> <b>agreements)</b> and qualitative interviews with full-time and lay union representatives and personnel managers in three non-departmental public bodies within the heritage sector: the British Museum, the Science Museum, and the Tate Gallery. The main theme of the research was {{an examination of the}} extent to which differences in pay levels had emerged within the heritage sector since pay delegation, through a comparison of the pay of warder grades. The main findings of the research are that, despite a variety pay determination methods, the salaries for warding staff on the top of their pay scales are very similar across all three of the heritage sector bodies. Indeed, it is argued that pay delegation has increased the complexity and cost of pay determination within the heritage sector without dramatically altering pay levels. Nevertheless, personnel managers (and some union representatives) maintain strong support for delegated pay bargaining raising important questions about the role of such delegation with regards to the delivery of other important managerial objectives...|$|E
30|$|Boeri and Bruecker (2011) also {{investigate}} how short-time work schemes interact with labour market institutions. They find that EPL strictness and bargaining centralisation indices have {{positive effects on}} national short-time work take-up rates, supporting the hypotheses presented in the previous section. They also investigate the impact of firm business conditions, structural characteristics, human capital investment and labour force composition on firm take-up rates. Using German establishment data for 2009, they find that both a fall in past sales and low expectations for future revenue negatively affect the take-up rate, while high competitive pressures induce firms to increase it. The authors conclude that short-time work “take-up rates are mainly affected by contemporaneous or anticipated shocks rather than by long-lasting structural problems”. Furthermore, the intensity of short-time work use increases with firm size, export share and share {{of research and development}} activities. Interestingly, the share of employees with higher educational attainment is associated with lower take-up, and the negative impact increases with the level of education. The share of employees on part-time or fixed-term contracts appears to reduce the share of firm employment in short-time work, supporting the hypothesis that permanent employees provide stronger incentives for firm participation. Finally, collective <b>pay</b> <b>agreements</b> do not have a clear effect on firm participation, although the impact may be negative.|$|E
30|$|Firm size {{is taken}} into account through the dummy {{variables}} indicating the size class. The base category is firms employing 1 – 4 employees, complemented by classes for 5 – 19, 20 – 49, 50 – 199 and 200 +[*]employees. Since we expect that collective <b>pay</b> <b>agreements</b> might matter, we also include a dummy variable if a collective pay agreement of any kind (firm-level or outside the firm) was applied in 2013. Further, firm-specific variables include the share of permanent full-time employees and the share of permanent part-time employees in 2007. The share of fixed-term/temporary employees {{in that same year}} serves as base category. Multi-establishment firms can shift work and employees between plants, so we expect them to be less likely to be applying for short-time work. Firing costs for permanent employees, full-time or part-time, are expected to be higher than for temporary workers or agency workers. To maintain their firm-specific human-capital, firms with higher shares of employees with at least 5 years of tenure are expected to be more likely to apply for short-time work. Firms with more skilled employees and firms reporting hiring costs to be relevant obstacles to hiring new employees are also expected to be more likely to apply for short-time work.|$|E
