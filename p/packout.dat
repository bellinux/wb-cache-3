5000|$|Rosy Glow and Lady in Red {{have been}} {{accepted}} by APAL and Pink Lady America into the Pink Lady business model, allowing fruit of the improved variety, which meets the Pink Lady quality criteria, to be sold as Pink Lady brand apples. In general, the improved selections produce apples with a larger area of blush. [...] The benefit of higher colour is the potential of higher <b>packouts,</b> and better fruit colour in hotter growing areas. The earlier-maturing strains also allow growing regions to expand, as crops can be grown without fear of losing the crop to winter freeze. Pink Lady America has also accepted the early clones listed as PLMAS98 (Maslin) and PLBAR B1 (Barnsby) as well as Ruby Pink and PLFOG99 into their business model for the Pink Lady brand.|$|R
40|$|The Food and Drug {{administration}} has {{expressed concern that}} Onions (Allium cepa) irrigated with water contaminated with high rates of Escherichia coli could harbor E. coli on their surface or interior. On the other hand, since onions contain antimicrobial compounds and field conditions may not be conducive to E. coli survival, the E. coli population {{on the surface of}} onions might become negligible through the course of field curing. Further, the relationship between the E. coli in the irrigation water to the E. coli on onion bulbs after field curing, harvest, and <b>packout</b> has not been studied. To determine if E. coli should be of concern in onion production, we sought to measure the die-off of E. coli on onions between the last irrigation and harvest and the presence of E. coli on onions after <b>packout.</b> Well water was tested and had no E. coli; ditch water intentionally run across a pasture prior to use had 218 to > 2400 MPN of E. coli/ 100 ml. Onions were sampled from those furrow irrigated (ditch water) and those drip irrigated (well water) starting at lifting 3 September 2013 for four consecutive weeks. At 0 and 28 days after lifting, both interior and exterior of the onions were tested for E. coli. At 7, 14, and 21 days after lifting, only the exterior of the onions was tested. None of the onions contained E. coli internally at 0 or 28 days after lifting. At lifting E. coli was present on the exterior of both the drip and furrow irrigated onions and seemed to be largely unrelated to the irrigation water. The exterior E. coli contamination decreased rapidly after lifting. After harvest and <b>packout</b> on 14 October 2013, no E. coli was detected on the onion bulb exteriors from either irrigation treatment. E. coli introduced into the onion field through furrow irrigation was not present on or in the packed out onion bulbs. 201...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Best {{practice}} guidelines {{have been}} developed in recent years for application of low volume, concentrated pesticide sprays to avocado orchards. Oil sprays, {{an important component of}} spray programmes on avocado orchards, have been excluded from the concentrate programme because of the risk of damage to the crop. Two unreplicated trials were undertaken on commercial orchards, one each in Northland and Bay of Plenty, from December 2012 -December 2013. Each plot consisted of a single orchard block (ca 1 ha) per treatment. Dilute (0. 5 % oil) high volume sprays (up to 3000 litres/ha) were compared with concentrated (1. 5 % oil) low-volume sprays (up to 1000 litres/ha) containing a horticultural superspreader adjuvant. Monitored pest populations were comparable in both treatments throughout the year with no detrimental impacts of concentrate oil sprays on either export <b>packout</b> rates or storage quality of fruit after harvest. Safe use of concentrate oil sprays on avocados is practical using a horticultural superspreader adjuvant...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. A two–sided {{mechanical}} harvester {{was developed to}} remove apples grown on narrow–inclined trellises. Units were essentially mirror images. On each unit the harvester operator used joysticks to position and engage a rapid displacement actuator (RDA) on main scaffolds to effect fruit removal. Catching conveyors were designed to intercept falling fruit without damage and elevate the fruit to a collecting conveyor. Cushioned catcher pans on each unit were used to seal around the trunk and connect the two units. Fruit removal was 95 % or better, and 86 to 95 % of all the fruit on the trees were recovered. Tests on eight cultivars of apples yielded 59 to 84 % Extra Fancy <b>packout.</b> Cuts and punctures were the biggest factor preventing the harvester from harvesting {{a higher level of}} fresh–market quality fruit. Stempulls with this harvesting technique ranged from 20 to 57 %, depending on cultivar, and may create a decay problem.

The objectives of this experiment, conducted during 2000 - 2003, were to i) {{determine the effects}} of N rate and fertigation frequency for microsprinkler-irrigated navel oranges on tree N status, and crop yield and quality; and ii) develop Best Management Practices which promote optimum tree growth and production while minimizing nitrate leaching. The trees were equipped with a microsprinkler irrigation system. The experiment was a randomized complete block factorial with N rates of 0, 0. 15, 0. 30, and 0. 45 lb N/tree/year, and fertigation frequencies of weekly, monthly, and three times per year. Each of the ten treatments was replicated five times. The trees were harvested in December or January of each growing season. Fruit were processed through an automatic fruit sizer, and fruit from each plot were further evaluated for fruit quality. Leaf N concentration and fruit yield of 4 - 6 year old trees were responsive to N rate, but not to fertigation frequency. Fruit quality and <b>packout</b> were not significantly affected by either N rate or fertigation frequency. Fruit yield was optimized at annual N rates of 0. 25 lb/tree (four-year-old trees) to 0. 35 lb/tree (six-year-old trees) during this experiment.

40|$|The {{original}} publication {{is available}} at [URL] production is concentrated in the central zone of the country (32 º- 36 ° 33 ’ S), under temperate climatic conditions. Pear is the fifth largest fruit crop in the Chilean export basket, representing 5 % of the planted area of fruit trees (approximately 10 000 ha), 200 000 t of total production in 2003 and a 60 % <b>packout</b> for the export market, valued at US $ 65 207 000. Chile’s pear exports comprise 7 % of the world’s pear exports and 22 % of the Southern Hemisphere’s exports (average for the years 2001 - 2002). Fruit is exported mostly to Europe, USA and Latin America. However, because of lower crop profitability, the planted area and total yield have been decreasing since 1991 to an estimated 7 700 ha for the 2003 / 2004 season, of which 94 % are European pear and 95 % are mature, bearing orchards. The main cultivar has been ‘Packham’s Triumph’, which represented 55 % of the total Chilean pears exported in 2003, followed by ‘Beurre Bosc’ (11 %) and other minor cultivars such as ‘Coscia’, ‘Abate Fetel’, ‘D’Anjou’ and ‘Bartlett’. The main problems facing commercial pear production in Chile are low orchard productivity, poor precocity and some quality problems that are being detected in the export market.

Field experiments were conducted at the University of Arizona Citrus Agricultural Center in separate blocks of ‘Newhall’ and ‘Fukumoto’ navel oranges, both on ‘Carrizo’ rootstock. In each block, ten treatments, consisting of all possible combinations of 5 N rates (0, 0. 2, 0. 4, 0. 6, and 0. 8 lb N/tree/yr) and 2 P rates (0, 0. 2 lb P/tree/year) were applied to five replicate trees per treatment. The maximum predicted yields for both varieties during all three seasons occurred at N rates of 0. 4 to 0. 55 lb N tree- 1 yr- 1. There were no significant effects of P application on fruit yield or quality. There were few significant effects of N or P fertilization on <b>packout</b> or fruit quality. The amounts of N removed in harvested fruit at the yield-maximizing N rates were equivalent to 50 - 84 % of the N applied.

40|$|Thesis (MScAgric (Horticulture)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2007. Most {{nectarine}} orchards in South Africa {{are currently}} planted {{at a distance}} of 4 x 1. 5 m (2 500 trees/ha). These trees are mainly sylleptically trained to a central leader, although many producers also use the proleptic route. The former produces relatively high yields early in the lifetime of the orchard. A problem with nectarine production in South Africa is the lack of efficient rootstocks in terms of aspects such as size-control and the use of nematode-resistant rootstocks. The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate different training systems for nectarine production and to investigate the role of three rootstocks that play a dominant role in the peach industry in South Africa. ‘Alpine’ nectarines were planted in the winter of 2002 at Lushof near Ceres, Western Cape, South Africa (33 º 18 ’S, 19 º 20 ’E). The trees were trained according to four different training systems: a four-leader system (5 x 3 m; 667 trees/ha), a two-leader system (5 x 1. 5 m; 1 333 trees/ha), a proleptically trained central leader (5 x 1 m; 2 000 trees/ha), and a sylleptically trained central leader (5 x 1 m; 2 000 trees/ha). The trees were planted on three different rootstocks: GF 667; SAPO 778; Kakamas seedling. The time spent per tree on pruning, thinning and picking was recorded. During harvest, the number of fruit and fruit mass per tree were recorded. Light measurements were recorded annually after summer pruning. The measurements were taken at different heights and at different depths in the canopy. To compare the training systems on an economic basis, the data from the trial together with projected data gathered from farmers and advisors were used to calculate the net present value (NPV) and internal rate of return (IRR) for each training system. The results showed that rootstock only played a significant role when it came to fruit mass (fruit size). Fruit from trees on SAPO 778 were heavier, indicating bigger fruit, than fruit from trees on Kakamas seedling rootstocks and this can play a role in <b>packout</b> percentage and income. In terms of the training system, the four-leader system took the most time to manage per tree. However, this system took the least time to manage per hectare during the initial years. No differences were found between the two central leaders. They both took the longest time to manage per hectare. The four-leader system produced significantly less fruit than any of the other systems during the first two years of production. In the third year of production, there was no significant difference found between the systems. Light penetration seemed to be the poorest at the middle and bottom of the canopy for trees trained to a central leader. Because of the open centre of the four-leader system, light penetration into the middle of these trees was good, but poor light penetration occurred in the upper and outer parts of the canopy underneath the scaffold branches. Poor light penetration occurred in the parts lower than 1. 5 m from the ground for all the systems. This was the area that was measured in this study. The result of an economic comparison showed that according to the IRR rating, the fourleader system should be preferred. The final decision should however be made according to the NPV rating. Results obtained from NPV calculations did not lead to the same conclusions as could be made from the IRR calculations. According to the rating of the NPV at five percent discounting rate, the two-leader should be the preferred system, while the proleptically trained central leader system should be preferred at a ten percent discounting rate. This implies that when the opportunity cost is low, the two-leader system should be preferred, and when the opportunity cost is high, the proleptically trained central leader system should be preferred...|$|E
40|$|The New Zealand {{flower thrips}} (Thrips obscuratus (Crawford)) is an {{important}} pest of stonefruit during flowering and at harvest in New Zealand. The biology and control of this species {{formed the basis for}} this study. A simple method for laboratory rearing is described that facilitated studies on the bionomics of T. obscuratus. Aspects of reproduction, fecundity, requirements for oviposition and development, development rates, temperature thresholds, thermal constants, and lifespan are detailed. T. obscuratus has been reported from at least 223 endemic and introduced plant species. Larvae were taken from 49 species around Canterbury. Adults were usually found on flowers but were also common on leaves and fruits. All larvae were on flowers except for two records from the fruit of stonefruit. The number and species of thrips infesting sprayed and unsprayed stonefruit flowers and fruit were determined. Adults and larvae were almost all T. obscuratus and adults were mostly female. Adults and larvae of thrips were found in stonefruit flowers from pink to shuck fall. Adults were found in similar numbers throughout flower development. Larvae were almost entirely absent at pink; numbers were small at full bloom and peaked at or just after petal fall. Thrips adults, eggs and larvae were all common on peaches, nectarines and apricots. Thrips were most numerous on ripe fruit, although they were found on fruit for the local market up to three weeks before harvest. Thrips numbers were highest on stonefruit varieties ripening during December and January and lowest on varieties ripening during February, March and April, and were higher on peaches than apricots and nectarines. Sources of T. obscuratus infestations were probably from flowers {{in the vicinity of the}} orchard. Pupation sites for T. obscuratus were established as including the soil and litter beneath a flowering cabbage tree (Cordyline australis). Female T. obscuratus were parasitised and sterilised by a nematode thought to be Howardula aptini. Flying thrips were sampled inside and outside stonefruit blocks from September 1984 to August 1987. Several species including T. obscuratus, Thrips tabaci, Limothrips cerealium and Haplothrips niger were common. A broad pattern of the seasonal abundance of T. obscuratus was apparent from water trap samples. Thrips numbers were lowest in winter and low in spring, but increased gradually during summer. Numbers peaked in midsummer but declined suddenly in mid to late January. Numbers remained moderate to low throughout late summer and autumn. Seasonal abundance could be largely explained by the interrelationship of temperature, soil moisture and availability of host plants. Flight take-off thresholds of 15 °C were established from weekly water trap samples for both male and female T. obscuratus adults. Both adults and larvae of T. obscuratus were found on hosts throughout the year, but were most common in early summer. There was no reproductive diapause for T. obscuratus females collected from the field in winter. In field experiments T. obscuratus males and females showed a preference for white without U. V., and to a lesser extent yellow, compared to green, blue, black and red. Traps baited with ethyl nicotinate caught significantly more T. obscuratus males and females than traps baited with anisaldehyde, benzaldehyde, peach juice, peach fruit and unbaited traps. An insecticide trial investigated the protection of nectarine flowers from thrips infestation and damage, using the insecticides fluvalinate or phosalone (low toxicity to bees) applied at full bloom as supplements to the current recommended spray programme. Thrips numbers were reduced, and export <b>packout</b> (based on russet only) was 10 % higher for trees treated at full bloom than for those treated only with the recommended spray programme. Several varieties of ripe stonefruit picked at maturity for the local market and which had received only periodic applications of carbaryl were infested with adults, eggs and larvae. The application of low rates of fluvalinate for preharvest control of thrips on peach fruit was investigated. Peaches were sampled for thrips at local market maturity ('Redhaven') and export market maturity ('Flamecrest'). Low rates of fluvalinate (20 % to 5 % of field rates) reduced thrips infestation on both varieties. On 'Flamecrest' one application of fluvalinate at 10 % field rate, 15 days before harvest, was more effective at reducing thrips infestation than the current recommended spray programme.. The management of T. obscuratus on stonefruit in Canterbury is reviewed in relation to previous research and knowledge gained from this study...|$|E
