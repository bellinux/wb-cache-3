40|$|Background: Tissue {{microarray}} (TMA) is a {{novel and}} useful tool to efficiently analyze gene expression in histological tissues. Aim: Cost-efficient {{and easy to use}} automated tissue arrayers will provide a better instrumentation to generate TMAs. Thus, we designed and produced our tissue microarrayer to meet these needs. Materials and Methods: The HT- 1 tissue microarrayer we designed and manufactured consists primarily of four parts, including an instrument to make array pores for the recipient paraffin blocks, a <b>punch</b> <b>needle,</b> an instrument for negative-pressure embedding, and a special manipulator. By using the HT- 1, 14 different TMAs were made to accommodate 312 cases of tissues and TMA sections were tested by hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining, in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemistry. Results: Expand: Hematoxylin and eosin staining showed that the tissue cylinders were similar, even, and in order on the slides. Most importantly, the HT- 1 microarrayer can make array pores in the recipient paraffin block with a single application in seconds. The HT- 1 also contains a unique negative pressure system for embedding TMA blocks. In addition, HT- 1 can make tissue cylinders with the same levels and depth for equally embedded and sectioning. Conclusions: The HT- 1 tissue microarrayer is a device that is simple, economical and easy to use...|$|E

The effects of areal density, <b>needle</b> <b>punching</b> depth, and fiber blending {{ratio of the}} composites on delamination, cushioning, hardness, support factor, and hysteresis loss were inves-tigated, and the relevant mechanisms were elucidated. Experimental {{results indicated that the}} hybrid composites exhibit high cushioning properties under multidrop-weight impact. The factors studied considerably influenced the cushioning {{properties of}} the composites. Hardness and support factor improved with increasing areal density and <b>needle</b> <b>punching</b> depth but decreased with increasing crimp hollow fiber ratio because of compression stress relaxation. Hybrid com-posites with various areal densities exhibited contrasting effects on the hysteresis behaviors of compression and inden-tation force deflections; these effects are attributed to the dissipation of support and energy in the materials surrounding the indentation. Instantaneous compression and recovery processes yielded no significant effects on fiber slippage; however, hysteresis loss was slightly affected by compression stress relaxation. The high-resilience thermal-bonding hybrid composites proposed in this work exhibited high cushioning and compression resistance properties...|$|R

30|$|Bursting {{strength}} (Roy and Ray 2009 b) of {{nonwoven fabric}} increases with increase in fabric weight, <b>needle</b> <b>punch</b> density {{and depth of}} needle penetration and for a further increase in the optimum value of needle density and depth of needle penetration, reduction in bursting strength observed. With the increase in fabric weight (Roy and Ray 2009 a), bending modulus of nonwoven fabric increases, {{on the other hand}} bending modulus achieves maximum value with the increase in punch density and depth of needle penetration, but further increase in such density and depth of needle penetration reduces bending modulus. For fabric weight (Madhusoothanan et al. 1998), the study also shows the same trend for jute/viscose blend <b>needle</b> <b>punched</b> nonwoven fabric, but as the proportion of viscose, the fibre proportion increases with blend proportion the decrease in bending modulus observed.|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} {{laboratory}} tests {{have been conducted}} with Port Hills loess from the Ahuriri quarry. Tests have been conducted to obtain a theoretical basis for suggestions of good design practice for retaining wall filtration/drainage systems. The study has concentrated on investigation of geotextiles as filtration options, with granular filters being tested for comparison. Two of the tests (stage 1 test and gradient ratio test) are designed to provide comparative information on filter performance with specific soil types. The third test {{is a series of}} three laboratory scale retaining wall simulations. Information from these tests provides evidence of potential problems with commonly used retaining wall filtration/drainage systems. In conjunction with laboratory testing, field observations have been carried out to assess {{the current state of the}} practice, and identify additional areas of concern. Results from both the gradient ratio and stage 1 tests indicate good performance of a range of <b>needle</b> <b>punched</b> nonwoven geotextiles for filtering the specific soil tested (Ahuriri quarry loess). Scanning Electron Microscope investigation of the soil and geotextile filter structures formed during testing indicate bridging to be the dominant filter network, with one example of a vault network for the <b>needle</b> <b>punched</b> range. Small amounts of clogging observed within the geotextile structure have not resulted in significant reductions in permeability. Gradient ratio values for a selection of the <b>needle</b> <b>punched</b> range support evidence from the stage 1 test that satisfactory filter performance is provided. Gradient ratio values of greater than 3. 0 are recorded for two heat bonded nonwoven geotextiles, indicating a concerning level of clogging. Observations of tested heat bonded samples under the SEM show a degree of "blocking" (a specific form of clogging). These observations are supported by lower permeability values in both tests, comparative to the <b>needle</b> <b>punched</b> range, suggesting the <b>needle</b> <b>punched</b> range is better suited to filtering this specific soil type. Indications from the retaining wall simulations suggest a need for impermeable drain channels under drainage pipes to prevent erosion of loess resulting from water flow under the drain pipes. Also indicated by these tests is the presence of salts on the backfill material obtained from a local quarry. Although further investigation is recommended, the potential exists for corrosion of steel reinforcing where adequate water proofing is not placed. The need for adequate surface drainage (particularly during construction) in combination with good retaining wall design is emphasised. As a culmination of the testing and field work, a number of suggestions are put forward as aspects of good design practice for filtration/drainage systems for use in retaining walls on the Port Hills. Selection of an appropriate geotextile for a specific filtration project should ideally follow an in-depth design process, and should not be controlled by budget constraints, as is sometimes the case. Numerical design criteria, based on site specific soil properties and geotextile properties, as well as compatibility tests (such as the gradient ratio test, or the stage 1 test) are available to aid in the design process...|$|R

40|$|Now-a-days, {{abrasive}} wear {{of engineering and}} agricultural machine components caused by the abrasive particles is a major industrial problem. Therefore, {{a full understanding of}} the effects of all system variables on the {{abrasive wear}} rates is necessary in order to undertake appropriate steps {{in the design of the}} machinery and the choice of materials to reduce/control wear. The need for the use of newer materials to combat wear situations has resulted in the emergence of polymer based system. Polymers and their composites form a very important class of tribo engineering materials and are invariably used in mechanical components where wear performance in non-lubricated condition is a key parameter for the material. The advantages of these materials are light weight, excellent strength to weight ratios, resistance to corrosion, non-toxicity, easy to fabricate, design flexibility, self-lubricating properties, better coefficient of friction, and wear resistance. The present research work is undertaken to study the physical, mechanical and three body abrasive wear behaviour of jute fiber reinforced polymer composites.
