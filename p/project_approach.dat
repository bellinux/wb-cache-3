2500|$|The Kaufman Best Practices <b>Project</b> <b>approach</b> {{did not use}} an EBP {{category}} per se, {{but instead}} provided a protocol for selecting the most acceptable treatment {{from a group of}} interventions intended to treat the same problems. To be designated as [...] "best practice", a treatment would need to have a sound theoretical base, general acceptance in clinical practice, and considerable anecdotal or clinical literature. This protocol also requires absence of evidence of harm, at least one randomized controlled study, descriptive publications, a reasonable amount of necessary training, and the possibility of being used in common settings. Missing from this protocol are the possibility of nonrandomized designs (in which clients or practitioners decide whether an individual will receive a certain treatment), the need to specify the type of comparison group used, the existence of confounding variables, the reliability or validity of outcome measures, the type of statistical analysis required, or a number of other factors required by some evaluation protocols.|$|E
2500|$|KfW. The German government-owned {{development}} Bank KfW has {{a series}} of water and sanitation projects in Jordan with a total commitment of Euro 245m in 2009. The currently largest project supports the extension of sewer networks {{and the construction of}} a wastewater treatment plant in Irbid through a Euro 62.95m loan approved in 2000. The treated wastewater is to be reused for irrigated agriculture. Other projects approved around 2000 include a Water Loss Reduction project for Irbid and Jerash (EUR 18.2 m loan), a Water Loss Reduction project for the Northern Governorates (EUR 21.7 m loan and EUR 3.5 m grant), a Water Loss Reduction project in Karak (EUR 16.2 m loan and EUR 2.24 m grant) and a sanitation project in Karak and Kofranjah (EUR 15m loan and EUR 1.45m in grants). In 2006, KfW approved another series of loans, including for a third project supporting the reduction of distribution losses in Amman in partnership with other donors through a 11m Euro loan with the objective of saving 2.5 million m3 of water per year, enough to provide 70,000 beneficiaries with water. Other projects approved around 2006 include a project for water transmission in the Northern Governorates (EUR 15 m loan) and a project for water management in the Middle Governorates (EUR 5.3 m loan). In 2009, KfW modified its cooperation with Jordan from a <b>project</b> <b>approach</b> to a program approach, bundling its new funding in a single [...] "Water Resources Management Program" [...] (2009–2014) that covers water loss reduction, sanitation and the use of reclaimed water from Irbid for irrigation in the Northern Jordan Valley. The new program approach is expected to allow flexible responses to changing circumstances.|$|E

40|$|High power {{white light}} {{emitting}} diodes (HPWLEDs), with advantages in terms of luminous efficacy, energy saving, and reliability, have become a popular alternative to conventional luminaires as white light sources. Like other new electronic products, HPWLEDs must also undergo qualification testing before being released to the market. However, most traditional qualification tests, which require all devices under testing to fail, are time-consuming and expensive. Nowadays, as recommended by the Illuminating Engineering Society (IES, IES-TM- 21 - 11), many LED manufacturers use a <b>projecting</b> <b>approach</b> based on short-term collected light output data {{to predict the future}} lumen maintenance (or lumen lifetime) of LEDs. However, this <b>projecting</b> <b>approach,</b> which depends on the least-square regression method, generates large prediction errors and uncertainties in real applications. To improve the prediction accuracy, we present in this paper a nonlinear filter-based prognostic approach (the recursive Unscented Kalman Filter) to predict the lumen maintenance of HPWLEDs based on the short-term observed data. The prognostic performance of the proposed approach and the IES-TM- 21 - 11 <b>projecting</b> <b>approach</b> are compared and evaluated with both accuracy- and precision-based metrics.

40|$|AbstractProject {{management}} methodology {{is usually}} {{defined as a}} set of methods, techniques, procedures, rules, templates, and best practices used on a project. It is commonly based on a specific <b>project</b> management <b>approach,</b> that defines a set of principles and guidelines which define the way a project is managed. With the growing trend of usage of agile project management on different projects, it is clear that two opposite sides exist – traditional and agile <b>project</b> management <b>approach,</b> and that there exists a need to combine both approaches. So, the question is if it is and how it is possible to combine both approaches in a single project management methodology?The paper covers thorough literature review and starts with the definition of the <b>project</b> management <b>approach</b> and of the project management methodology. It provides overview of different <b>project</b> management <b>approaches</b> and defines <b>project</b> management methodologies. The literature review shows what is considered as part of project management methodology in a wider or narrower sense, and what the main characteristics of a methodology are. The need for combining <b>project</b> management <b>approaches</b> is shown on the case of software development project. The paper provides basis for further research on application of different <b>project</b> management <b>approaches</b> and methodologies. Further research could build on an idea of creating unique methodology for project, based on different <b>project</b> management <b>approaches.</b> In that way it is possible to create project management methodologies that have high possibility of customization to projects and to project environments...|$|R
