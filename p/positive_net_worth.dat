It describes the importance of sufficient cash as an asset in the business for short term operations, purchases and acquisitions.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of credit market {{imperfections}} on unemployment, vacancy posting and wages. We develop and simulate a new-Keynesian DSGE model, integrating sticky prices in goods market and frictions in labor and credit markets. A search and matching process {{in the labor market}} and a costly state verification framework in the credit market are introduced. Capital spending, vacancies costs and wage bill need to be paid in advance of production and thus require external financing in a frictional credit market. The theoretical model demonstrates how the procyclicality of the risk premium impacts the vacancy posting decisions, the wage and unemployment levels in the economy. Higher credit market frictions are the source of lower posting vacancies and higher unemployment level. Asymmetric information in the signing of a loan pushes up wholesale firms' marginal costs, as well as hiring costs by a financial mark-up charged by financial intermediaries. This financial mark-up is then transmitted by these firms on prices. Thus, it affects their hiring behavior, the wage and employment levels, as well as inflation in the economy. Then, the theoretical model is simulated by using quarterly United-States (US) data for the sample period 1960 :Q 1 to 2007 :Q 4. We find that employment rates and vacancy posting increase following <b>positive</b> credit, <b>net</b> <b>worth</b> and uncertainty shocks.

40|$|Our {{knowledge}} remains limited {{about why}} there are large racial/ethnic differences in wealth among the middle class in the United States. Owning a home and having <b>positive</b> <b>net</b> <b>worth</b> (i. e., more assets than debts) are important aspirations {{for the middle class}} because they signify wealth. This study uses a social-psychological perspective and data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth to explore whether the effects of psychological dispositions on these indicators of wealth differ for Blacks, Hispanics, and Whites. Results reveal that having a stronger sense of personal control over life and higher self-esteem significantly increase the odds of achieving <b>positive</b> <b>net</b> <b>worth</b> and homeownership, independent of demographics, educational attainment, current employment, income, and the socioeconomic status of the family of origin. Moreover, interaction effects indicate that the influence of internal locus of control on wealth is stronger for Whites than Blacks. Overall, this study’s findings suggest that the journey between social origins and destinations does not simply need socioeconomic resources, but also psychological resources that come from within the self-concept of the individual. The public policy and mental health implications for the Black middle class are discussed...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – An {{effective}} bank resolution regime requires {{taking action}} while the bank still has <b>positive</b> <b>net</b> <b>worth</b> and shareholder claims still have economic value. Such actions raise {{a number of}} legal issues {{with respect to the}} rights of shareholders. This paper aims to consider how {{to strike a balance between}} the need to protect the legitimate rights of shareholders and the need for a prompt and rapid action and a failure resolution mechanism that minimizes disruptions to the financial system and preserves market discipline. Design/methodology/approach – The paper examines the nature of the shareholders' rights and the legal protection afforded to them. In the European context, the relevant sources of law are the European Convention on Human Rights and the applicable community legislation. It considers different options for resolution within this framework ranging from a pre-packaged resolution decided by the shareholders ex ante to the outright divestiture of the shareholders once certain regulatory thresholds are breached while the bank still has <b>positive</b> <b>net</b> <b>worth.</b> Findings – The curtailment of shareholder rights should seek to generate appropriate incentives for shareholders and other stakeholder and achieve broad objectives of enhancing predictability and maintaining public goods, while at the same time providing for due process, proportionality and adequate compensation. Practical implications – The paper presents options on how to reform existing frameworks in order to facilitate bank restructurings in a crisis. Originality/value – The paper discusses key elements that policy makers need to consider in the design of a regulatory framework for early intervention and resolution.

The EITC offers low-income families a clearcut opportunity to accumulate assets and to build <b>positive</b> <b>net</b> <b>worth.</b> The USA-IDA legislation hopes to build on this motivation and to assist financially and logistically to meet these goals.
