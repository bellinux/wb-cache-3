40|$|Prefetching of data is {{frequently}} discussed candidate technology for mitigation of negative effects caused by low-bandwidth and high-delay connections especially common in mobile wireless scenarios. An inevitable side-effect of prefetching is increased overall transferred data volume. In this paper this side-effect is investigated {{and set in}} relation to the achieved reduction in user waiting time. Simulations on request/response level have been performed to investigate the distinct influence of prefetching in circuit-switched and <b>packet-switched</b> <b>networks</b> on network costs.

Results show that while prefetching can achieve the desired reduction of waiting time for both circuit-switched and <b>packet-switched</b> <b>networks</b> these gains are coupled with pronounced increase in <b>network</b> cost for <b>packet-switched</b> <b>networks</b> but with slight decrease in network costs for circuit switched networks...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Large {{industrial}} {{control and}} automation applications require reliable com-munication with strict timing constraints between distributed communication equip-ment. <b>Packet-switched</b> <b>networks</b> {{are widely used}} as a high-speed, deterministic, and low-cost solution to handle these types of distributed real-time systems. Although research on guaranteeing timing requirements in <b>packet-switched</b> <b>networks</b> has been done, communication reliability is still an open problem for hard real-time applica-tions. In this paper, a framework for enhancing the reliability in multihop <b>packet-switched</b> <b>networks</b> is presented. Moreover, an admission control mechanism using a real-time analysis is suggested to provide deadline guarantees for hard real-time traf-fic.

40|$|A novel {{bandwidth}} regulation {{mechanism is}} proposed which improves {{the ability of}} a <b>packet-switching</b> <b>network</b> to cope with multiple real-time and non-real-time traffic classes. The mechanism achieves regulation of link bandwidth at two levels. At the first level, bandwidth is dynamically regulated between different traffic classes. The concept of `inter-class regulation' is introduced which enforces that the bandwidth left unused by a traffic class is divided among traffic classes with high bandwidth demands. At the second level, bandwidth regulation is enforced on end-to-end traffic streams, so-called flows, such that flows from the same class with identical routes have the same throughput constraints. This concept is referred to as `intra-class regulation'. A simple distributed protocol is presented that achieves intra-class and inter-class regulation in a general internetwork.
