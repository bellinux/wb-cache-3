40|$|Some {{functional}} and retrogradation properties of native and heat-moisture treated potato and <b>wheat</b> <b>starches</b> {{were examined in}} the presence of hydroxypropyl ß-cyclodextrin (HPß-CD). HPß-CD increased swelling factor, amylose leaching, and solubility of both native and heat-moisture treated <b>wheat</b> <b>starches</b> but it had less impact on corresponding potato starches. Gelatinization enthalpy of native <b>wheat</b> <b>starch</b> wasdecreased {{in the presence of}} HPß-CD but was increased in potato starch with increasing concentration. Reduction of amylose-lipid complex endotherm in both native and heat-moisture treated <b>wheat</b> <b>starch</b> was observed in the presence of HPb- CD. Heat-moisture treatment did not change the transition parameters of amylose-lipid complex showing its resistance to hydrothermal treatment. HPß-CD greatly decreased the pasting temperature of <b>wheat</b> <b>starch.</b> Cold paste viscosity of both native and heatmoisture treated <b>wheat</b> <b>starch</b> was increased by HPß-CD {{to a greater extent than}} corresponding potato starch. Amylopectin retrogradation of all the starches was unaffected in the presence of HPß-CD but heat-moisture treatment slightly decreased retrogradationof potato starch. These results suggest that HPß-CD can disrupt the amylose-lipid complex within the starch granule in both native and heat-moisture treated <b>wheat</b> <b>starch</b> but has no influence on amylopectin retrogradation. However, greatly increased <b>wheat</b> <b>starch</b> setback with HPß-CD indicates its greater effect on <b>wheat</b> <b>starch</b> amylose retrogradation. © 2010 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The influences of these plasticisers and of granular remnants (ghosts) on recrystallisation were determined by using X-ray diffraction. Recrystallisation of potato starch samples {{in the presence of}} plasticisers resulted in crystallinity indices of 0. 5. The largest reduction in potato starch recrystallisation is found for threitol (4 OH) and xylitol (5 OH). In the plasticiser range examined, the crystallisation inducing effect of granular potato starch remnants is reduced better when the plasticiser contains more OH groups. <b>Wheat</b> <b>starch</b> recrystallises to a lesser extent than potato starch, resulting in crystallinity indices of 0. 4. The results for <b>wheat</b> <b>starch</b> do not show clear trends for the influences of plasticiser size and of ghosts. The difference in behaviour of the two starches is probably caused by <b>wheat</b> <b>starch</b> having shorter amylopectin chains. Resulting from these shorter amylopectin chains, the remaining structure in <b>wheat</b> <b>starch</b> ghosts may resemble A-type crystallinity, making it more difficult to form B-type crystals. Alternatively, the trends as found for potato starch may occur, but are less manifest for <b>wheat</b> <b>starch,</b> due to the lower total extent of recrystallisation. Solid state CP/MAS NMR spectra of the <b>wheat</b> <b>starch</b> samples containing ethylene glycol were obtained, in order to compare completely and partly gelatinised systems. The spectra were identical, confirming that the ghost structures do not influence <b>wheat</b> <b>starch</b> recrystallisation. Apparently, <b>wheat</b> <b>starch</b> ghosts do not act as nuclei for crystallisation. Similarly, the influence of various malto-oligosaccharides in combination with granular remnants (ghosts) was investigated on <b>wheat</b> <b>starch</b> ageing. Gelatinised and partly gelatinised <b>wheat</b> <b>starch</b> were plasticised with maltose, maltotriose, maltotetraose, maltopentaose or maltohexaose. This resulted in crystallinity indices of 0. 2, with the largest reduction in recrystallisation for maltotriose and maltotetraose. No trend was found for the influence of ghosts. The presence of ghosts did not influence the 13 C solid state HP/DEC NMR spectra. Less recrystallisation took place than with the previously mentioned smaller plasticisers that resulted in crystallinity indices of 0. 4.

40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>wheat</b> <b>starch</b> {{components}} on the filtration characteristics of <b>wheat</b> <b>starch</b> hydrolysates were investigated with a model-based approach. The filtration rate was {{not affected by}} {{the removal of the}} pentosans or by altering the conformation of the protein. On the other hand, the filtration rate increased when a hydrolysate was defatted with chloroform or butanol. Some commercially available enzymes also increased the filtration rate. The filtration rate of potato starch hydrolysates decreased when gluten, pentosans, solubles, or propanol extract from defatted <b>wheat</b> <b>starch</b> were added. The latter had by far the largest effect. The composition of this extract was 65 % lipid and 11 % protein. The main lipid in <b>wheat</b> <b>starch</b> is lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC). This single-chain lipid forms micelles above a concentration of 0. 025 g/kg. The filtration rate decreased when LPC was added to potato starch hydrolysates or glucose solutions at concentrations above the critical micelle concentration. This effect of LPC on glucose solutions proves that the filtration characteristics are not related to the formation of amylose-lipid complexes. Therefore, micelle formation must be responsible for the effect of LPC on the filtration rate. The critical micelle concentration is only 2. 5 % of the amount of lysophospholipids in <b>wheat</b> <b>starch</b> hydrolysates. Thus, almost all of these lipids have to be removed from <b>wheat</b> <b>starch</b> hydrolysates to increase the filtration rate...|$|R

HHP has been known to affect high molecular weight polymers causing phase change. Starch has been gelatinized on the order of 600 - 700 MPa, at 25 C. Gelatinized starch recrystallizes during storage affecting the texture and shelf life of food products. HHP was applied to corn and <b>wheat</b> <b>starch</b> to study the effects of storage temperature and time on recrystallization of starch in HHP induced starch gels and on the stability of aqueous suspensions of starch. The effect of storage temperature on re-crystallization kinetics of gelatinized corn and <b>wheat</b> <b>starch</b> were evaluated using a differential scanning calorimeter. The textural properties of gelatinized corn and <b>wheat</b> <b>starches</b> during storage were monitored as a function of time using a rheometer. The rate of retrogradation depended on the storage temperatures (23 C and 4 C) and the botanical origin of starch. The corn and <b>wheat</b> <b>starch</b> stored at 23 C exhibited characteristics of strong gels {{for a longer period of}} time than that of the starches stored at 4 C. Pregelatinizing starch is a method used to modify native starch in order to improve several characteristics including increased solubility. Currently pregelatinized starches are prepared by thermal processing. Thermal and HHP processed pregelatinized corn and <b>wheat</b> <b>starch</b> were compared to native corn and <b>wheat</b> <b>starch</b> to determine the settling characteristics of the starches. The settling characteristics were determined by measuring the turbidity of the corn and <b>wheat</b> <b>starch</b> as a function of time with a spectrophotometer, and by measuring the amount of solid separation and suspension after 24 hours of settling.

Swelling factor of both starches slightly increased up to 20 % sucrose and glucose but decreased at 40 % concentration (sucrose > glucose). Glycerol did not affect swelling factor of <b>wheat</b> <b>starch</b> even at 40 % concentration but decreased it in potato starch. Amylose leaching of <b>wheat</b> and potato <b>starches</b> tends to decline above 5 % and 1 % concentration of sucrose and glucose, respectively. However, similar to swelling factor the extent of amylose leaching in <b>wheat</b> <b>starch</b> was unaffected {{in the presence of}} glycerol. Gelatinization temperature and enthalpy of both starches were increased by sucrose, glucose and glycerol in the order of sucrose > glucose > glycerol.

Effect of HPβ-CD on amylose-lipid complexes in native and acetylated potato starches synthesized using α-lysophosphatidylcholine was also studied. Acetylation increased swelling factor, amylose leaching, peak viscosity and susceptibility to α-amylase hydrolysis, but decreased gelatinization temperature and enthalpy and gel hardness in all starches. HPβ-CD markedly increased swelling factor and amylose leaching in native and acetylated <b>wheat</b> <b>starches</b> but {{had little or no}} impact on other <b>starches.</b> <b>Wheat</b> <b>starch</b> gelatinization enthalpy decreased in the presence of HPβ-CD but gelatinization temperature of all the starches was slightly increased. HPβ-CD had no influence on enzymatic hydrolysis. Melting enthalpy of amylose-lipid complex in both native and acetylated <b>wheat</b> <b>starches</b> was decreased by HPβ-CD. Acetylation also decreased the melting enthalpy of amylose-lipid complex in <b>wheat</b> <b>starch.</b> Similar trend of thermal transitions was observed in the presence of HPβ-CD for the amylose-lipid complexes synthesized in potato starch. Acetylation reduces the complex formation ability of the amylose polymer.

Higher swelling and amylose leaching, and decreased gelatinization temperature and enthalpy resulting from acetylation of <b>wheat</b> <b>starch</b> is consistent with its influence on starch hydration.
