40|$|Since 1 December 2002, the New Zealand Exchange’s (NZX) {{continuous}} disclosure listing {{rules have}} operated with statutory backing. To test {{the effectiveness of}} the new corporate <b>disclosure</b> <b>regime,</b> we compare the change in quantity of market announcements (overall, non-routine, non-procedural and external) released to the NZX before and after the introduction of statutory backing. We also extend our study in investigating whether {{the effectiveness of the}} new corporate <b>disclosure</b> <b>regime</b> is diminished or augmented by corporate governance mechanisms including board size, providing separate roles for CEO and Chairman, board independence, board gender diversity and audit committee independence. Our findings provide a qualified support for the effectiveness of the new corporate <b>disclosure</b> <b>regime</b> regarding the quantity of market disclosures. There is strong evidence that the effectiveness of the new corporate <b>disclosure</b> <b>regime</b> was augmented by providing separate roles for CEO and Chairman, board gender diversity and audit committee independence, and diminished by board size. In addition, there is significant evidence that share price queries do impact corporate disclosure behaviour and this impact is significantly influenced by corporate governance mechanisms. Our findings provide important implications for corporate regulators in their quest for a superior <b>disclosure</b> <b>regime...</b>|$|R
40|$|This brief {{response}} {{to the work of}} Professors Omri Ben-Shahr and Carl Schneider on mandated <b>disclosure</b> <b>regimes</b> investigates the normative criteria underlying their claim that those regimes are failures. Specifically, it unpacks the pieces of those authors 2 ̆ 7 implicit cost-benefit analysis, revealing inherently normative judgments about desert and responsibility at the core of their (or any) critique of <b>disclosure</b> <b>regimes.</b> <b>Disclosure</b> <b>regimes</b> may aim to improve human decisionmaking behaviors, but those behaviors are influenced in non-deterministic ways by cognitive capacities that are heterogeneously distributed among subjects of the regimes. Accordingly, any claim regarding the normative desirability of <b>disclosure</b> <b>regimes</b> (or any other regulatory regime that seeks to channel and improve decisionmaking) implicitly rests on judgments regarding individuals 2 ̆ 7 responsibility for their own capacities. I argue that in evaluating such regulatory regimes, focusing on efficiency through cost-benefit analysis distracts from inescapable and logically prior distributive questions regarding desert and responsibility...|$|R
40|$|Information {{disclosure}} requirements are a relatively common feature of consumer protection regimes generally. In {{the case of}} retail investment products such requirements {{have been in place}} since the late 1980 s. Now the European Distance Marketing of Financial Services Directive will impose a similar <b>disclosure</b> <b>regime</b> wherever a contract is concluded at a distance. But, despite the popularity of <b>disclosure</b> <b>regimes</b> with policy makers, the available evidence suggests that such regimes may not be particularly effective. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to discuss first, the extent to which <b>disclosure</b> <b>regimes</b> are underpinned by a solid understanding of consumer decision-making behaviour, and secondly, the implications the development of the internet as a delivery channel for retail investment products might have for their effectiveness. The paper concludes that, despite the indeterminacy of consumer decision-making research such that it fails to provide a ready model on which to (re) design <b>disclosure</b> <b>regimes,</b> the development of the internet as a delivery channel both compounds the challenges for the regulator in devising an effective <b>disclosure</b> <b>regime,</b> but also provides the regulator with an opportunity to explore the potential to deliver interactive capabilities which would enhance the potential to better influence consumer decision making. As such, the paper should be of interest to regulators, the industry (which has expressed doubts about the cost-effectiveness of such regimes) as well as academics interested in regulatory policy...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the role of}} market transparency in repeated first-price auctions. We consider a setting with private and independent values across bidders. The values {{are assumed to be}} perfectly persistent over time. We analyze the first-price auction under three distinct <b>disclosure</b> <b>regimes</b> regarding the bid and award history. Of particular interest is the minimal <b>disclosure</b> <b>regime,</b> in which each bidder only learns privately whether he won or lost the auction {{at the end of each}} round. In equilibrium, the winner of the initial auction lowers his bids over time, while losers keep their bids constant, in anticipation of the winner’s lower future bids. This equilibrium is efficient, and all information is eventually revealed. Importantly, this <b>disclosure</b> <b>regime</b> does not give rise to pooling equilibria. We contrast the minimal disclosure setting with the case in which all bids are public, and the case in which only the winner’s bids are public. In these settings, an inefficient pooling equilibrium with low revenues always exists with a sufficiently large number of bidders.

40|$|In January 2010 the New Zealand Government {{introduced}} a continuous <b>disclosure</b> <b>regime</b> for State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) modelled on the regime applying to publicly-listed companies (PLCs). The government sees continuous disclosure increasing the transparency of SOEs {{and that this}} will lead to improved financial performance by SOEs. We analyse the traditional rationales for continuous disclosure in PLCs and find {{that it is not}} axiomatic that a continuous <b>disclosure</b> <b>regime</b> designed for PLCs overlaid onto an SOE will offer the same incentives for performance improvement. The differences in owner identity and governance relationships in SOEs and the absence of a market for the trading of shares substantially weaken the performance improvement effect of the disclosure instrument in SOEs. In the absence of share trading {{it is not clear how}} a failure to disclose by SOE managers could be detected. Furthermore under the New Zealand arrangements the sanctions for SOE failure to disclose are very weak. This suggests that it is both easier for and more likely that SOE managers will withhold material information relative to their PLC counterparts.

40|$|Although {{the past}} few decades have seen {{numerous}} cases of human rights violations within corporate supply chains, companies are frequently not held accountable for the abuses because there is a significant governance gap in the regulation of corporate activity abroad. In response, governments have begun to pass mandatory disclosure laws that require companies to release detailed information on their supply chains in the hopes that these laws will create pressure that will improve corporate accountability. In this paper, we argue that supply chain <b>disclosure</b> <b>regimes</b> are unlikely to have a large effect on consumer behavior, and as a result, their effectiveness at reducing human rights abuses will likely be limited. This is not only because scholarship on mandatory <b>disclosure</b> <b>regimes</b> in other areas has suggested that these regimes are frequently unsuccessful, but also because these problems are likely to be exacerbated in the human rights context. We argue that {{this is due to the}} fact that supply chain disclosures do not provide information on actual products, the information in the disclosures only provides weak proxies for human rights outcomes, and the risks associated with supply chains vary dramatically across industries. In order to test our argument, we engaged a leading market research firm to field a series of experiments that were designed to test how well consumers understand supply chain disclosures. In our experiments, the nationally representative sample of respondents consistently rated disclosures reporting low levels of due diligence almost as highly as disclosures that reported a high level of due diligence. Based on these results, we argue that consumer-oriented supply chain <b>disclosure</b> <b>regimes</b> designed to improve corporate human rights behavior should be reconsidered...|$|R
40|$|It {{is widely}} {{recognised}} that disclosure-based regulation {{is useful for}} developed securities markets where dominant investors are sophisticated, regulators are experienced, and market infrastructures are improved. The disclosure philosophy proves unworkable absent an environment conducive to {{a level playing field}} for the players in the market for initial public offerings. In the market economy age, the regulators of many emerging and pre-emerging securities markets have been importing this regulatory philosophy without any study being conducted on the usefulness of the new regime. As a result, savers are putting their savings into banks, leaving corporations more dependent on loan capital than on equity in developing countries.

Concomitant with increased value is the expansion of new legal obligations to protect {{personal information}}. Mandatory data breach notification laws are an important new development in this regard.

Regulators may also need to be notified. Australia currently does not have a mandatory data breach notification law but this may be about to change. The Australian Law Reform Commission has suggested that a data breach notification scheme be implemented through the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth). However, the notification of data breaches may already be required under the continuous <b>disclosure</b> <b>regime</b> stipulated by the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) and the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) Listing Rules.

40|$|Although {{most of the}} {{developed}} securities markets, such as Australia, have already {{for a long time}} implemented statutory backing to their continuous disclosure listing rules, Hong Kong only enacted this law effective in January 2013. Before that day, Hong Kong relied solely on its Listing Rules to impose limited sanctions to those corporations breaching this disclosure requirement. Continuous disclosure regulations define what, how and when price-sensitive information (PSI) should be disclosed. These regulations, together with other disclosure regulations, are fundamental to preserving the integrity and efficiency of securities markets and a balance between allowing firms to raise funds and providing investors with protection. This article highlights a number of issues related to continuous disclosure regulations. A continuous <b>disclosure</b> <b>regime</b> for listed corporations with statutory backing is more effective in protecting investors than that without such backing, as a continuous <b>disclosure</b> <b>regime</b> relying solely on its listing rules without statutory backing may encounter difficulty in enforcing its disclosure. One major reason for this difficulty is the limited resources available to a stock exchange even it is eager to enforce its disclosure requirement stipulated in its listing rules. Hong Kong is a good example for illustrating this difficulty. Effective enforcement, in turn, is more likely to deter future non-compliance. Secondly, the difficulty in reaching consensus among all market participants could be a major hurdle for the passage of giving statutory backing to continuous disclosure in Hong Kong, indicating that enactment of continuous disclosure law in particular, and securities law in general, is a political power struggle between regulators and regulated entities. Thirdly, Hong Kong is particularly in need of a continuous <b>disclosure</b> <b>regime</b> backed with statute to reduce the information asymmetry problems under its institutional settings...|$|R

We consider a multifirm setting in which the variance of each firm's future cash flow is uncertain. A manager can disclose, at a cost, this variance before offering the firm for sale in a competitive stock market with risk‐averse investors. In our partial disclosure equilibrium, managers voluntarily disclose if their firm has a low variance of future cash flows, but withhold the information if their firm has highly variable future cash flows. We establish how the manager's discretionary risk disclosure affects the firm's share price, expected stock returns, and beta, {{within the framework of}} the Capital Asset Pricing Model. We show that whereas one manager's discretionary disclosure of his firm's risk does not affect other firms' share prices, it does affect the other firms' betas. Also, we demonstrate that a disclosing firm has lower risk premium and beta ex post than a nondisclosing firm. Finally, we show that ex ante, the expected risk premium and expected beta of each firm are higher under a mandatory risk <b>disclosure</b> <b>regime</b> than in the partial disclosure equilibrium that arises under a voluntary <b>disclosure</b> <b>regime...</b>|$|R
