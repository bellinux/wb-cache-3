5|$|On September 25, 1989, several Republicans from Ohio {{filed an}} ethics {{complaint}} against Glenn, charging {{that he had}} improperly intervened on Keating's behalf. The initial charges against the five Senators were made on October 13, 1989, by Common Cause, a <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> <b>group,</b> who asked for the U.S. Justice Department and the Senate Ethics Committee to investigate {{the actions of the}} senators relative to Lincoln and the contributions received from Keating and whether they violated the rules of the Senate or federal election laws. But the most public attention came from the House Banking Committee, whose new chair Henry B. Gonzalez held 50hours of hearings into the Lincoln failure and associated events.|$|E
5|$|The {{baguette}} sandwiches {{were introduced}} to Europe starting in the UK in 2003, with several new varieties designed to cater to the population mix of the country. While the baguette sandwiches were well received {{and continue to be}} sold, several red flags have been raised by the British government and private groups in regards the healthiness of these and other products sold by the fast food industry. In 2005, British Food Standards Agency (FSA) cited large levels of fats and salt in the company's beef-based Monterey Melt baguette and chided BK for backing out of an agreement to help make the company's products healthier. In 2007 the private <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> <b>group</b> Consensus Action on Salt and Health, abbreviated to CASH, cited Burger King and other fast food chains over the continued levels of sodium contained in these types of foods. The group specifically claimed that the Chicken BLT Baguette sandwich, when paired with fries and a Coca-Cola, was one of the three saltiest fast food products in the UK.|$|E

In February 2004, the Green Party of Canada Living Platform was initiated by the Party's former Head of Platform and Research, Michael Pilling.

It also made it easy for candidates to share their answers to <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> <b>group</b> questionnaires, find the best answers to policy questions, and for even rural and remote users, and Canadians abroad, to contribute to Party policy intelligence.|$|E

500|$|K. Eric Drexler is {{generally}} considered to have written the first scholarly paper {{on the topic of}} nanotechnology, and was a key figure in popularizing these concepts through several publications and advocacy work. [...] Trained as an engineer, Drexler was inspired by a then-obscure 1959 talk by physicist Richard Feynman called There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom, which posited that it should be physically possible to manipulate individual atoms using top-down engineering methodologies. Drexler was also inspired by recent advances in molecular biology such as recombinant DNA technology. In a 1981 publication in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, considered to be the first journal article on nanotechnology, he argued that biological systems such as the ribosome were already capable of building molecules atom-by-atom, and that artificial machines with this capability could also be constructed. Drexler went on to publish two books on nanotechnology: Engines of Creation in 1986, which was intended for the public, and the technical work Nanosystems in 1992. He also co-founded the Foresight Institute, a <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> <b>group</b> devoted to increasing public awareness and information about molecular nanotechnology.|$|E

40|$|Investment {{arbitration}} {{decisions are}} often inconsistent. In particular, {{complaints about the}} unpredictability of NAFTA Chapter 11 jurisprudence and the difficulties in balancing foreign investors’ <b>interest</b> and <b>public</b> policy are common and unresolved. An examination {{of the role of}} <b>interest</b> <b>groups</b> may shed important light on the resolution of that problem as they are involved in the social construction of the meaning and use of NAFTA Chapter 11 through arbitration and public debate. This work discusses the extent to which amici curiae empower <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> <b>groups</b> that seek to protect citizen-consumers. It argues that currently amici curiae provides an extremely narrow list of participation rights to <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> <b>groups</b> that, coupled with economic and political disadvantages in many cases, result in censoring the views of such groups and playing the political role of symbolic accountability. This work proposes an expansive view of amici curiae for <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> <b>groups</b> in light of the potential of the latter to counter the influence of corporate <b>interest</b> <b>groups</b> and to contribute to both minimize NAFTA Chapter 11 inconsistencies and strike a more realistic balance between the <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> and foreign investors’ interest. The overall impact of such expansive amici curiae will probably be the defragmentation of NAFTA Chapter 11, that is to say, <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> <b>groups</b> will be empowered to introduce <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> considerations such as human rights, environmental protection and public health into NAFTA analysis, that are likely to protect the interest of local citizen-consumers. However, that requires not only greater legal powers for <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> <b>groups,</b> but also favorable financial and political conditions for an effective participation of <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> <b>groups</b> in NAFTA disputes. The argument is illustrated with a brief discussion of amici curiae in the context of anti-smoking groups and tobacco policies in Canada affecting particularly vulnerable groups with high rates of tobacco consumption such as aboriginal communities and low-income groups...|$|R

40|$|This article {{explores the}} role of US <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> <b>groups</b> in the {{promotion}} of government transparency, {{as part of a}} broader agenda on civil liberties. Drawing on a set of declassified documents, and extensive oral testimony from protagonists, it is argued that such groups occupy a significant position as facilitators of intelligence accountability in the United States. <b>Public</b> <b>interest</b> <b>groups</b> represent a tradition of pluralism that lies at the heart of the American conception of democracy. A survey of the tactics deployed by <b>interest</b> <b>groups</b> to support liberal democratic principles demonstrates that these groups always rely on government institutions to carry out their oversight function. By virtue of this, <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> <b>groups</b> support intelligence accountability rather than hold to account the US government and its intelligence agencies...|$|R
2500|$|Before Quebecor withdrew its {{mandatory}} {{access request}} for Sun News (see above), the <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> <b>group</b> Friends of Canadian Broadcasting issued a briefing to the CRTC recommending that Sun News' application be rejected, believing that Sun's mandatory access request was [...] "highly unfair" [...] to other licence applicants. However, Friends recommended that if Sun News did win licence approval, Quebecor {{should be required}} to commit revenue to Canadian programming (equal to that of CTV News Channel and CBC News Network) as well as adhere to the Canadian Association of Broadcasters Code of Ethics for balanced news coverage and programming. The CRTC's November 26 approval specifically included requirements that Sun News would adhere to the RTNDA Code of Journalistic Ethics and the Journalistic Independence Code {{as a member of the}} Canadian Broadcast Standards Council. Sun News was regarded to be a possible benefactor of a proposal by the CRTC to give licensed broadcast stations more leeway to broadcast false and misleading news (the CRTC dropped the proposal in February 2011).|$|E

50|$|These {{groups do}} not {{necessarily}} advance the <b>public's</b> <b>interest</b> but are intertwined with corporations and lobbying efforts to advance the interest that benefit their clients and result in financial gain for them. Since their inception, the role in <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> <b>groups</b> in politics has increased drastically, with many of them funding political action committee (PACs) {{with the purpose of}} advancing or inhibiting campaigns based on the candidate's stance on important issues. <b>Public</b> <b>interest</b> <b>groups</b> {{on both sides of the}} aisle have expanded their roles tremendously and can even be attributed to the divisive political arena that exist today.

We examine the evidence by assessing the behavior of 50 child advocacy groups that seek to influence public policy at the state level.
