25|$|Some {{challenge}} the perceived 'whiteness' of camp aesthetics, noting barriers for gender exploration in queer black communities relative to white LGBT communities. Uri McMillan identifies Nicki Minaj as a contemporary black icon of camp. Minaj's flamboyant performances and aesthetics increase her notoriety. She invokes multiple personalities or accents in her music to assert <b>personal</b> <b>autonomy</b> in the patriarchal musical industry. Such performances challenge {{racial and gender}} politics, while interrupting the male gaze. Nicki Minaj, thus, dismisses and dismantles notions of black sexual morality and normativity.|$|E
25|$|In the {{scenario}} favoured by David Erdal and Andrew Whiten, primate-style dominance provoked equal and opposite coalitionary resistance— counter-dominance. During {{the course of}} human evolution, increasingly effective strategies of rebellion against dominant individuals led to a compromise. While abandoning any attempt to dominate others, group members vigorously asserted their <b>personal</b> <b>autonomy,</b> maintaining their alliances to make potentially dominant individuals think twice. Within increasingly stable coalitions, according to this perspective, status began to be earned in novel ways, social rewards accruing to those perceived by their peers as especially cooperative and self-aware.|$|E

40|$|The {{greatest}} {{contribution in}} "Die Nationaltaetenfrage und die Sozialdemokratie" by Otto Bauer" is {{the explanation of}} generation and development of nation including "waking of peoples without history". The contents which should be called the renovation (or reconstruction) of the historical materialism by Bauer are developed. The logic of development of nation is making the nation essence theory in a wide sense with the nation essence theory in a narrow sense (= "definition of nation"). The conventional researches took only "definition of nation" without referece to others,and abandande themselves to inquiry of definitions. Such attitudes should be reconsiderd. Although Bauer included the logic of national development in historical materialism,he did not necessarily succeed in adjusting it to the Marxian historical materialism centering on class struggle. Since the logic of class struggle was restraining the logic of national development from the outside in Bauer's explantaion, he could not solve an actural complicated tangle of class and nation. There {{is a problem in}} connection with the limit of Marxism which understands history centering on class struggle. By taking out the logic of national development, Bauer could show the limit of Marxism clearlier than anyone. In spite of including <b>personal</b> national <b>autonomy</b> policy which Karl Renner proposed, Bauer's national policy is ecletic and also includes the territorial national autonomy policy of "Brünner Programm". In grounding the <b>personal</b> national <b>autonomy</b> policy Bauer also followed Renner, and his originality is not found. Bauer's ecletic position corresponds to the disregard to Renner's view of law and state. Such theoretical background of Bauer has relevance to his prompt abandonce of <b>personal</b> national <b>autonomy</b> policy during the World War. We cannot ask for theoretical grounding of a <b>personal</b> national <b>autonomy</b> policy in Bauer. It will be necessary to reconsider Austrian national theory in a broader perspective...|$|R
25|$|Another key {{aspect of}} Reform {{doctrine}} is the <b>personal</b> <b>autonomy</b> of each adherent, who may formulate his own understanding and expression of his religiosity. Reform is unique among all Jewish denominations in placing {{the individual as}} the authorized interpreter of Judaism. This position was originally influenced by Kantian philosophy and the great weight it lent to personal judgement and free will. This highly individualistic stance also proved one of the movement's great challenges, for it impeded the creation of clear guidelines and standards for positive participation in religious life and definition of what was expected from members.|$|E
25|$|Reform Judaism and Reconstructionist Judaism permit total <b>personal</b> <b>autonomy</b> in {{interpretation}} of Jewish Law, and intermarriage is not forbidden. Reform and Reconstructionist rabbis {{are free to}} take their own approach to performing marriages between a Jewish and non-Jewish partner. Many, but not all, seek agreement from the couple that the children will be raised as Jewish. In other words, Judaism does not exist as a Law, but as a voluntary lifestyle, to be tweaked as desired. This allows for any form of marriage to be officiated at by a Reform rabbi, so long as all parties involved label their lifestyle as Jewish.|$|E

500|$|The {{boundaries}} {{between art and}} pop music became increasingly blurred throughout {{the second half of}} the 20th century. In the 1960s, pop musicians such as John Lennon, Syd Barrett, Pete Townshend, Brian Eno, and Bryan Ferry began to take inspiration from their previous art school studies. [...] Frith states that in Britain, art school represented [...] "a traditional escape route for the bright working class kids, and a breeding ground for young bands like the Beatles and beyond". In North America, art pop was influenced by Bob Dylan and the Beat Generation, and became more literary through folk music's singer-songwriter movement. Before progressive/art rock became the most commercially successful British sound of the early 1970s, the 1960s psychedelic movement brought together art and commercialism, broaching the question of what it meant to be an [...] "artist" [...] in a mass medium. Progressive musicians thought that artistic status depended on <b>personal</b> <b>autonomy,</b> and so the strategy of [...] "progressive" [...] rock groups was to present themselves as performers and composers [...] "above" [...] normal pop practice.|$|E
500|$|The {{music was}} {{developed}} immediately following {{a brief period}} in the mid 1960s where creative authenticity among musical artists and consumer marketing coincided with each other. Before the progressive pop of the late 1960s, performers were typically unable {{to decide on the}} artistic content of their music. Assisted by the mid 1960s economic boom, record labels began investing in artists, giving them freedom to experiment, and offering them limited control over their content and marketing. The growing student market serviced record labels with the word [...] "progressive", being adopted as a marketing term to differentiate their product from [...] "commercial" [...] pop. Music critic Simon Reynolds writes that beginning with 1967, a divide would exist between [...] "progressive" [...] pop and [...] "mass/chart" [...] pop, a separation which was [...] "also, broadly, one between boys and girls, middle-class and working-class."

500|$|The {{relationship}} between Johnson and Chinn shows the contradictions within slavery at the time. For one, {{not only does}} it indicate that even then that [...] "kin could also be property," [...] but it is an interesting case because Johnson was open about his relationship with Chinn, calling her [...] "my bride" [...] on at least one occasion, with both of them acting like a married couple, and oral tradition recalling that other slaves at Great Crossings worked on their wedding. As part of their relationship, Chinn gained more responsibilities. As she spent much of her time in the [...] "plantation's big house," [...] a two-story brick home, she managed Johnson's estate for at least half of each year, with her purview later expanding to all of his property, even acting as [...] "Richard's representative" [...] and allowing her to handle money. This gave, as historical scholar Christina Snyder argues, some independence, since Johnson told his white employees that Chinn's authority must be respected, and her role allowing her children's lives to be different from [...] "others of African descent at Great Crossings," [...] giving them levels of privileged access within the plantation. This was further {{complicated by the fact that}} Chinn was still enslaved but supervised the work of slaves, with the Chinn family never sold or mortgaged off, but she did not have the power to [...] "challenge the institution of slavery or overturn the government that supported it," [...] she only had the power to gain some <b>personal</b> <b>autonomy,</b> with Johnson never legally emancipating her. This may have been because, as Snyder says, liberating her from human bondage would erode [...] "ties that bound her to him" [...] and keeping her enslaved supported his idea of being a [...] "benevolent patriarch." ...|$|E

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} if manipulation of two basic psychological needs, autonomy and relatedness, each had independent effects on inducing state authenticity. Participants {{were randomly assigned to}} a condition where their autonomy need was either fulfilled or unfulfilled and their relatedness need was met or not. The autonomy need was manipulated as follows, a participant was asked to write an essay in accord with their <b>personal</b> beliefs (<b>autonomy</b> fulfilled) or against their <b>personal</b> beliefs (<b>autonomy</b> unfulfilled). The participant was accept or rejected for a future interaction {{on the basis of this}} essay by a bogus interaction partner. Potential mediators were also examined which included self-esteem, positive affect, negative affect, private self-consciousness and public self-consciousness. Analysis of the results using ANOVAs and ANCOVAs revealed a lack of effect of relatedness manipulation on state authenticity and a lack of effect of the autonomy manipulation on two domains of state authenticity as measured by the Wood, Linley, Maltby, Balisousis and Joseph’s (2008) adapted state authenticity scale, authentic living and accepting external influence; possible explanations for this failure to find effects are described. This study found that manipulation of support for autonomy caused variation in levels of self alienation a third subscale of the Wood et al. (2008) authenticity scale. This effect was partially mediated by negative affect. Implications for theory regarding authenticity, and possible therapeutic methods are discusse...|$|R

[...] It states that [...] "if anyone were {{to attempt to}} answer these two questions authoritatively for all Reform Jews, that person's answers {{would have to be}} false. [...] Why?

[...] Reform Judaism affirms [...] "the fundamental principle of Liberalism: that the individual will approach this body of mitzvot and minhagim in the spirit of freedom and choice. [...] Traditionally Israel started with harut, the commandment engraved upon the Tablets, [...] which then became freedom. [...] The Reform Jew starts with herut, the freedom to decide what will be harut - engraved upon the personal Tablets of his life."
