25|$|The first {{synthesis}} of atorvastatin at Parke-Davis {{that occurred during}} drug discovery was racemic followed by chiral chromatographic separation of the enantiomers. An early enantioselective route to atorvastatin made use of an ester chiral auxiliary to set the stereochemistry {{of the first of}} the two alcohol functional groups via a diastereoselective aldol reaction. Once the compound entered pre-clinical development, <b>process</b> <b>chemistry</b> developed a cost-effective and scalable synthesis. In atorvastatin's case, a key element of the overall synthesis was ensuring stereochemical purity in the final drug substance, and hence establishing the first stereocenter became a key aspect of the overall design. The final commercial production of atorvastatin relied on a chiral pool approach, where the stereochemistry of the first alcohol functional group was carried into the synthesis—through the choice of isoascorbic acid, an inexpensive and easily sourced plant-derived natural product.|$|E

40|$|Most of {{the high}} school {{students}} have an aversion to the subject of chemistry. This fact is, probably, due to the complexity of the phenomena involved in chemical transformations and little interdisciplinarity and /or transdisciplinarity in relation to the daily life of students and with other subjects. Therefore, the teacher must find ways to assist the pedagogical teaching-learning <b>process</b> in <b>chemistry.</b> The development of modern and simple strategies, using experiments, games and other teaching resources, is recommended to streamline the <b>process</b> of learning <b>chemistry.</b> The aim of this work was to employ a game as a didactical resource to facilitate the teaching-learning <b>process</b> in <b>chemistry.</b> The game used was Sudoku, and the version employed was called Sudokímica. The material was applied in three high school classes of a public school in Natal-RN, Brazil. The didactical resource was successful in the sense of facilitating and integrating the scientific and daily life knowledge of the students. It can be concluded that the game, Sudokímica can be considered good alternative to supplementary material in the teaching-learning <b>process</b> in <b>chemistry</b> through for resolution of problems. ...|$|R
