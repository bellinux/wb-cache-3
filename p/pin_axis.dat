The {{normal stress}} {{distributed}} in the mid-bondline of the adhesively bonded joint under cleavage loading was investigated using the elastic finite element method (FEM) and the strain gauges method to reveal the real normal stresses distribution in the metal-to-metal joint while the load was increased. The results from the finite element analysis (FEA) showed that {{there is always a}} peak stress of the normal stress Sy in the mid-bondline occurred at a point close to the loading <b>pin</b> <b>axis.</b> When the load was increased from 0. 5 kN to 3 kN, there was also a point located at about x = 16 mm along the length of specimen where there is without any normal stress at all. The result of stress Sy from the FEA is nearly the same as that one obtained from the strain gauges method. It was also found that there was a evidently hardness change in the bonded zone of the adherend made from structural steel or pure copper, which can be used to explain the procedure of the joint and discuss the distribution model of the normal stress Sy in the joint under the cleavage loading...|$|E

50|$|The MGL grenade {{launcher}} {{consists of a}} lightweight, progressively rifled steel barrel, sight assembly, frame with firing mechanism, spring-actuated revolving cylinder magazine, and a folding stock. The weapon has a fire selector safety switch just above the rear pistol grip which can be operated from either side. The launcher cannot be accidentally discharged if dropped.The launcher is loaded by releasing the cylinder <b>axis</b> <b>pin</b> and swinging the steel frame away from the cylinder. The rear of the cylinder (including the pistol grip) is unlatched and pivoted counter-clockwise to expose the chambers during reloading. By inserting the fingers into the empty chambers and rotating the aluminium cylinder it is then wound against its driving spring. The grenades are then inserted into the chambers, one-by-one (because the cylinder cannot be removed), the frame closed, and the <b>axis</b> <b>pin</b> re-engaged to lock. When the trigger is pressed a double-action takes place and the firing pin is cocked and released to fire the grenade. Gas pressure on a piston unlocks the cylinder and allows the spring to rotate it until the next chamber is aligned with the firing pin, whereupon the next round can be fired. If a misfire occurs the trigger can be pulled repeatedly.|$|R

Characteristics of the crankcase maximum pressure variations were made for the start-up speed and for selected rotational speeds of the 359 compression-ignition engine crankshaft as well as micrometric measurements of the cylinder liner and pistons and rings wear. The engine was operated under normal traction conditions while pressure analyses and cylinder liner micrometric measurements were made, respectively, after an operational run of 204864 km. Crankcase exhaust gas maximum pressure measurements were made both with air vent open and closed for a cold (lubricating oil temperature of 285 K) and a warm engine (333 K).

The model is applicable to both conventional mono-piston assemblies and also to articulated piston assemblies. The modeling approach involves treating the piston assembly as a set of independent rigid bodies, and formulating and solving the equations of motion for each body. The hydrodynamic skirt-liner interaction force is computed by solving the Reynolds equation for the oil film and integrating the computed pressure. This essentially one dimensional calculation is performed at several circumferential locations on the piston, and the results are integrated to yield a single force in the main thrust-anti thrust direction. The model is first developed with a basic form of this hydrodynamic calculation, which is later improved to include a solution for the wetted region and a complete pressure distribution on the piston. Results using both forms of the model are compared and analyzed, and the final model is used to perform several parametric studies involving various engine operating parameters. by Conor P. McNally.

40|$|The {{activity}} of the Retinoblastoma protein, the master regulator of the cell cycle, is finely regulated by phosphorylation.

40|$|Friction stir welding (FSW) is a {{relatively}} new process being applied for joining of metal alloys. The process was initially developed by The Welding Institute (TWI) in Cambridge, UK. The FSW process is being investigated at NASA/MSEC as a repair/initial weld procedure for fabrication of the super-light-weight aluminum-lithium shuttle external tank. The FSW investigations at MSFC were conducted on a horizontal mill to produce butt welds of flat plate material. The weldment plates are butted together and fixed to a backing plate on the mill bed. A pin tool is placed into the tool holder of the mill spindle and rotated at approximately 400 rpm. The pin tool is then plunged into the plates such that the center of the probe lies at, one end of the line of contact, between the plates and the shoulder of the pin tool penetrates the top surface of the weldment. The weld is produced by traversing the tool along the line of contact between the plates. A lead angle allows {{the leading edge of the}} shoulder to remain above the top surface of the plate. The work presented here is the first attempt at modeling a complex phenomenon. The mechanical aspects of conducting the weld process are easily defined and the process itself is controlled by relatively few input parameters. However, in the region of the weld, plasticizing and forging of the parent material occurs. These are difficult processes to model. The model presented here addresses only variations in the radial dimension outward from the <b>pin</b> tool <b>axis.</b> Examinations of the grain structure of the weld reveal that a considerable amount of material deformation also occurs in the direction parallel to the <b>pin</b> tool <b>axis</b> of rotation, through the material thickness. In addition, measurements of the axial load on the pin tool demonstrate that the forging affect of the pin tool shoulder is an important process phenomenon. Therefore, the model needs to be expanded to account for the deformations through the material thickness and the forging affect of the shoulder. The energy balance at the boundary of the plastic region with the environment required that energy flow away from the boundary in both radial directions. One resolution to this problem may be to introduce a time dependency into the process model, allowing the energy flow to oscillate across this boundary. Finally, experimental measurements are needed to verify the concepts used here and to aid in improving the model...|$|R

40|$|Biodegradable {{polymeric}} particles {{have been}} widely used in the biomedical fields such as drug carriers, tissue engineering, and medical imaging. It has been recognized that the physical properties of particles, such as size and shape, have a profound influence on their functions. However, {{it is not easy to}} prepare non-spherical particles by the conventional emulsion-based method because the minimization of interfacial energy leads to the spontaneous formation of spherical emulsions and it is difficult to control the uniformity and size. In order to solve this problem, we developed a direct method to fabricate non spherical polylactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) particles with uniform size. This method employed a common agent, phosphate buffer saline (PBS), as the deformation initiator and combined the premix membrane emulsification technique with the solvent evaporation method to prepare uniform non-spherical particles of various shapes with aspect ratios from 2 to 40 and various sizes ranging from 800 nm to 60 <b>pin</b> (long <b>axis).</b> We found that the external driving force of stirring and the interfacial tension of the droplet dictated by the constitution of PBS and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) have synergistic effects on the deformation.

Such incongruence often results in morbidity and secondary procedures. In a recent prospective study of hinged external elbow fixation, 19 % of patients had elbow incongruence resulting from fixator malalignment, and these patients all required secondary procedures for fixator realignment or replacement [6].|$|R
