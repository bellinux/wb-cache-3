Namely, for any positive integer k, a <b>positional</b> <b>representation</b> with the symbols for 1, 2, [...] ., k is given that retains all the essential properties of the usual <b>positional</b> <b>representation</b> of base k (over symbols for 0, 1, 2 [...] ., k- 1). Moreover, in this zero-free representation, a sequence of symbols identifies the number that corresponds to the order number that the sequence has in the ordering where shorter sequences precede the longer ones, and among sequences of the same length the usual lexicographic ordering of dictionaries is considered.

Existing deep models rely on a single sentence representation or multiple granularity representations for matching. However, such methods cannot well capture the contextualized local information in the matching process. To tackle this problem, we present a new deep architecture to match two sentences with multiple <b>positional</b> sentence <b>representations.</b> Specifically, each <b>positional</b> sentence <b>representation</b> is a sentence representation at this position, generated by a bidirectional long short term memory (Bi-LSTM). The matching score is finally produced by aggregating interactions between these different <b>positional</b> sentence <b>representations,</b> through $k$-Max pooling and a multi-layer perceptron. Our model has several advantages: (1) By using Bi-LSTM, rich context of the whole sentence is leveraged to capture the contextualized local information in each positional sentence representation; (2) By matching with multiple <b>positional</b> sentence <b>representations,</b> it is flexible to aggregate different important contextualized local information in a sentence to support the matching; (3) Experiments on different tasks such as question answering and sentence completion demonstrate the superiority of our model.

40|$|Henson (1996) {{provided}} {{a number of}} demonstrations of error patterns in serial recall that contradict chaining models. One such error pattern concerned when participants make intrusions from prior lists: Rather than originating from random positions in the prior list, intrusions tend to be recalled {{in the same position}} as their position in the prior list, a finding which led to the endorsement of positional models of serial recall. However, all of the demonstrations of positional intrusions occurred in designs in which relatively small sets of items were repeatedly employed as stimuli. In recent years, a number of investigations have found evidence for chaining in designs in which large sets of items are employed and items are never reused across trials (open sets). We conducted 2 experiments using open sets of items to test whether a pure chaining model is a viable model for open-set conditions. Both experiments revealed that intrusions from the immediately preceding list exhibited a strong tendency to be output in the same position as their position in the prior list, suggesting the usage of <b>positional</b> <b>representations</b> in open-set designs.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this chapter is to discuss several {{critical}} issues in early mathematics education, particularly the use of manipulatives to teach <b>positional</b> <b>representation</b> of numbers. For our prehistoric ancestors, the representation of numbers larger than the ones that {{could be counted on}} their fingers and toes represented a significant challenge. This problem was solved by a brilliant insight of using position to represent and distinguish large numbers. Some tools have been extremely useful in performing math operations on large numbers. In the history, the abacus and the pascaline played a part in implementing and improving the <b>system</b> of <b>positional</b> <b>representation</b> of numbers. These tools can also {{play a significant role in}} helping young children understand the role of position. This chapter discusses and provides examples of how teachers can facilitate young children acquiring strategies for using these tools to represent numbers and to make arithmetical operations. A point worth noting is that the use of these tools is not intrinsically helpful in promoting children's learning. Their effectiveness depends largely on how thoughtfully and intentionally they are used, shaping classroom practices. In other words one simply cannot give children a set of blocks or any other tool and expect that learning is produced from access to those tools. Teachers must think carefully about what it is they want children to do and how they might benefit and then structure their environment and guide children so that these outcomes are likely to be achieved...|$|R

40|$|Ausgangspunkt dieser Dissertation ist die Frage: „Was ist {{fundamental}}er als die Raum-Zeit?“ Nach Immanuel Kant sind aber Raum & Zeit als reine Formen der sinnlichen Anschauung „a priori“ aller Erfahrung und allen Denkens und konstituieren somit die „Bedingungen, unter denen Erfahrung erst möglich ist“. Im Jahre 1941 hat Konrad Lorenz diese Apriori biologisch interpretiert und damit das Konzept einer Evolutionären Erkenntnislehre formuliert. Deren Hauptthese lautet: „Unser Erkenntnis-Apparat ist ein Ergebnis der Evolution. Die Subjektiven Erkenntnisstrukturen passen auf die Welt, weil sie sich im Laufe der Evolution in Anpassung an eben diese reale Welt herausgebildet haben. Sie stimmen mit den realen Strukturen (teilweise) überein, weil nur eine solche Übereinstimmung das Überleben ermöglichte. “ Wendet man dies auf die Erfahrung von Raum & Zeit an, so gelangt man zur Kognitionswissenschaft von Raum & Zeit. Das Ergebnis der Analyse der Kognition von Raum & Zeit lässt sich wie folgt zusammenfassen. Im Kognitiven System des Menschen gibt es mehrere Informationsrepräsentationssysteme. Ein Sprachlichlogisches Repräsentationssystem, ein Nonverbales Repräsentationssystem zur Speicherung von Multimodalen Spatiotemporalen Informationen und ein Internes Repräsentationssystem zur Speicherung von Subjektiven Informationen über interne Körperzustände. Das Multimodal-Spatiotemporale Repräsentationssystem lässt sich dann weiter in Modalitätsspezifische Repräsentationssysteme für die einzelnen Sinnesmodalitäten und ein Amodales Repräsentationssystem für Spatiotemporale Information untergliedern. Letzteres ist weiter in Amodale Repräsentationssysteme für Reinräumliche Informationen, Spatiotemporale Informationen & Reinzeitliche Informationen untergliedert. Mit dem Reintemporalen Repräsentationssystem hat dieses Amodale Repräsentationssystem auch Anteil am Internen Körperrepräsentationssystem. Für die Kognition der Zahlen kommt nur noch ein Zahlenrepräsentationssystem für die Zahlen 1 - 3 als eigenständiges Repräsentationssystem hinzu. Alle anderen Zahlenrepräsentationen benutzen das Räumliche oder das Sprachlichlogische Repräsentationssystem. Alle diese Repräsentationssysteme sind das Ergebnis von Phylogenetischen, Ontogenetische & Psychogenetischen Entwicklungsprozessen. Aus diesen Erkenntnissen wird anschließend untersucht, naturphilosophische Konsequenzen für die Raum-Zeit-Physik ergeben. Insbesondere geht es um die Frage von Gerhard Vollmer, die lautet: „Nach der Evolutionären Erkenntnistheorie sind die subjektiven Strukturen des Erkenntnis-Apparates für die Erkenntnis konstitutiv. Gilt dies für alle Stufen des Erkenntnis-Prozesses?“ Das Ergebnis dieser Analyse ist, dass das Visuospatiotemporale Informationsrepräsentationssystem die Kognitive Basis der Physikalischen Theorien mit Klassischem Materiekonzept bildet, mit dessen Hilfe das Visuell-Nonverbale Sensomotorische System diese Theorien mit Hilfe von Kognitionsprozessen aus Interaktionen mit der Physikalischen Außenwelt konstruiert hat. Darüber hinaus beruhen diese Theorien auch auf dem Sprachlichlogischen Informationsrepräsentations-System als Kognitiver Basis und sind das Produkt von Kognitiven Math. Basisfähigkeiten, mit deren Hilfe sie ebenfalls aus Interaktionen mit der Physikalischen Außenwelt abgeleitet wurden. Dabei dominiert das Visuospatiotemporale Informationsrepräsentationssystem in der Kognitiven Basis gegenüber dem Sprachlichlogischen Informationsrepräsentationssystem eindeutig! Auch die Quantenmechanik hat diese beiden Informationsrepräsentationssysteme als Kognitive Basis. Allerdings dominiert hier das Sprachlichlogische Informationsrepräsentationssystem gegenüber dem Visuospatiotemporalen Informationsrepräsentationssystem! Da das Sprachlichlogische Informationsrepräsentationssystem aber ein Symbolisches Informationsrepräsentationssystem ist, bedarf es zu seiner Funktionsfähigkeit der Abbildung seiner Symbole auf Informationsstrukturen des Multimodalen Spatiotemporalen Informationsrepräsentationssystems, damit die mit seiner Hilfe repräsentierten Sprachlichlogischen Informationen überhaupt Teil des Informationellen Modells der Außenwelt des Kognitiven Systems sein können. Damit lässt sich die oben gestellte Frage wie folgt beantworten: Ja, diese Kognitiven Strukturen sind nicht nur für die Ebenen der Wahrnehmungs- & Erfahrungserkenntnis konstitutiv, sondern für alle Stufen des Erkenntnisprozesses. Das heißt: „Auch die Wissenschaftliche Erkenntnis ist biologisch/genetisch determiniert!“Starting {{point of}} this thesis is the question: „What is more fundamental than space time?“ However, after Immanuel Kant space & time are pure forms of cognitive evidence and therefore as "a priori" of all experience and all thinking constitute the „conditions under which experience is only possible“. In 1941 Konrad Lorenz gives a biological interpretation of this apriori and by this formulates {{the idea of an}} evolutionary epistemology at first time. The main thesis of the evolutionary epistemology is: „Our cognitive apparatus is a result of evolution. Our subjective knowledge structures fit on the world because they have developed in the course of evolution in adaptation to just this real world. They are matching with the structures of the real world (as least partially) because only such a correspondence allowed the survival. “ Applying this to cognition of space & time, one reaches to Cognitive Science of space & time. The result of analysis of cognition of space & time can be summarised as follows. In the human cognitive system exist at least two different information <b>representation</b> <b>systems.</b> A linguistic-propositional <b>representation</b> <b>system</b> for storage of linguistic information and a non-verbal <b>representation</b> <b>system</b> for storage of multi-modal spatio-temporal information. In addition, there is one more internal <b>representation</b> <b>system</b> for storage of subjective information about internal body states as for example feelings, pains, etc. The multi-modal-spatio-temporal <b>representation</b> <b>system</b> by itself is subdivide further in modality-specific <b>representation</b> <b>systems</b> for each modal type of information and an amodal <b>representation</b> <b>system</b> for spatio-temporal information. And then the latter by itself is subdivided further again in amodal <b>representation</b> <b>systems</b> for pure spatial information, spatio-temporal information & pure temporal information. The pure temporal <b>representation</b> <b>system</b> also contains chronobiological rhythms & the “internal clocks". In form of the pure temporal <b>representation</b> <b>system</b> the amodal <b>representation</b> <b>system</b> also participates in the internal body <b>representation</b> <b>system.</b> In addition there is only one independent <b>representation</b> <b>system</b> for the <b>representation</b> of the three numbers 1 - 3. All the other number representations use the spatial or the linguistic-propositional <b>representation</b> <b>system.</b> And all these cognitive <b>representation</b> <b>systems</b> are the result of phylogenetic, ontogenetic & psychogenetic development processes. Then the discourse is running further from cognition of space & time to space-time physics and afterwards philosophical implications for space-time physics, arising from cognitive science and evolutionary epistemology are examined. In particular the question of Gerhard Vollmer is examinated, which is: „After the evolutionary epistemology the subjective structures of our cognitive apparatus are constitutive for experience. Does this be valid for all steps of the cognitive process ?“ (Die Natur der Erkenntnis, p. 53) The result of this analysis is the visuo-spatio-temporal information <b>representation</b> <b>system</b> forms the cognitive base of physical theories with classical matter concept. With whose help the visual-non-verbal senso-motoric system has constructed these theories with the help of cognition processes from interactions with the physical outside world. In addition, these theories are also based on the linguistic-propositional information <b>representation</b> <b>system</b> as their cognitive base and are the product of the cognitive fundamental mathematical abilities with whose help they were also derived from interactions with the physical outside world. Besides, the visuo-spatio-temporal information <b>representation</b> <b>system</b> dominates in the cognitive base compared with the linguistic-propositional information <b>representation</b> <b>system</b> unambiguously! Also quantum mechanics has these both information <b>representation</b> <b>systems</b> as its cognitive base. Indeed, here the linguistic-propositional information <b>representation</b> <b>system</b> dominates compared with the visuo-spatio-temporal information <b>representation</b> <b>system!</b> Because the linguistic-propositional information <b>representation</b> <b>system</b> is, however, a symbolic information <b>representation</b> <b>system,</b> it requires to its effectiveness of the mapping of his symbols on information-structures of the multi-modal spatio-temporal information <b>representation</b> <b>system,</b> so that the linguistic-propositional information represented with its help can {{become a part of the}} informational model of the outside world of the cognitive system. With it the question put on top can be answered as follows: Yes, these cognitive structures are constitutive not only for the levels of sensual perception & every day experience, but for all steps of the cognitive process. That is: „Also scientific knowledge is determined biologically/genetically!...|$|R

40|$|With the {{introduction}} of readily available technology, the subject of physical representations of mathematical concepts has become more of an issue for mathematics educators (Kaput, 1989). How technology {{is to be used}} for student learning may depend on the choice of representations inherent in the particular technological tools used. In discussing the idea of reflective abstraction and representations Steffe said: Our operationalization of reflective abstraction is compatible in its general outline with Kaput's (1988) view of how mathematical representational systems arebuilt in computer learning environments. (1989, p. 7) The {{purpose of this paper is}} to explore one example of Kaput's model of multiple linked <b>representation</b> <b>systems</b> and how that example is compatible with constructivism. Kaput's Representational Systems James Kaput (1989) has stated that mathematical meaning-building can come from essentially four sources, grouped in two categories: Referential Extension Via translations between mathematical <b>representation</b> <b>systems</b> Via translations between mathematical <b>representation</b> <b>systems</b> and non-mathematical systems [...] .; Consolidation Via pattern and syntax learning through transformations within and operations on the notations of a particular representation system; Via mental entity building through reification of actions, procedures, and concepts into phenomenological objects which can serve as the basis for new actions, procedures, and concepts at a higher level of organization [...] . [i. e. ] reflective abstraction (p. 168) For the purposes of this paper, we will consider only the processes of translations between groups of mathematical <b>representation</b> <b>systems.</b> According to Kaput, the translations occur in two different areas (See figure 1), the mental world and the physical world. The mental world is the " [...] . essentially private world of mental events and state changes [...] . " 1989, p. 169) and the physical world is the " [...] . public world of characters and lines in some physical medium [...] . " (1989, p. 169).
