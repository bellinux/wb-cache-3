5000|$|According to Reynolds, a <b>pioneering</b> <b>wave</b> of avant-funk artists came in {{the late}} 1970s, when post-punk artists (including Public Image Ltd, James Chance, Cabaret Voltaire, Talking Heads, The Pop Group, D.A.F., A Certain Ratio, and 23 Skidoo) embraced black dance music styles such as funk and disco. Reynolds noted these artists' preoccupations with issues such as alienation, {{repression}} and the technocracy of Western modernity. The artists of the late 1970s New York no wave scene also explored avant-funk, influenced by figures such as Ornette Coleman.|$|R

40|$|I {{begin to}} write this thesis {{at a time of}} great {{excitement}} in the field of cosmology and particle physics. The aim of this thesis is to study and search for beyond the standard model (BSM) physics in the cosmological and high energy particle fields. There are two main questions, which this thesis aims to address: 1) what can we learn about the inflationary epoch utilizing the <b>pioneer</b> gravitational <b>wave</b> detector Adv. LIGO?, and 2) what are the dark matter particle properties and interactions with the standard model particles?. This thesis will focus on advances in answering both questions...|$|R
500|$|The {{practice}} {{of listening to}} distant stations in the medium wave AM broadcast band was carried over to the shortwave bands. [...] Frank Conrad, an early <b>pioneer</b> of medium <b>wave</b> broadcasting with KDKA in Pittsburgh, instituted {{some of the first}} shortwave broadcasts around 1921. Stations affiliated with General Electric and Crosley followed shortly after.|$|R
50|$|The Promise Ring is an American {{rock band}} from Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

5000|$|Dzeltenie Pastnieki are a Latvian band {{formed in}} 1979 in Riga, Latvia. Their name means [...] "the yellow postmen" [...] in Latvian, and is {{sometimes}} abbreviated to DzP.

The music has ranged from guitar/bass/drums-based post-punk to minimal synthpop to experimental tape manipulation.|$|R
40|$|Several {{thousand}} impulsive {{whistler mode}} noise bursts were detected by the <b>Pioneer</b> Venus <b>wave</b> instrument {{during the first}} 10 seasons with nightside traversals at low altitudes. The altitude distribution for these events shows that essentially all of the bursts were detected when the orbiter was less than 2000 km above the planet, suggesting that the varying plasma conditions could not maintain coherent whistler mode field-aligned guidance over greater distances. Within the 2000 -km range, {{the distribution of the}} number of events versus altitude shows that there are two distinct subregions. These results are interpreted in terms of two types of whistler mode propagation from sources below the ionosphere...|$|R
50|$|In {{the latter}} days of symphonic rock, {{a great number}} of new groups started poppingseemingly out of nowhere. In reality, these were bands {{influenced}} by post-punk, new wave from the US and Britain, and by the more symphonic and less progressive side of Argentine rock. Patricio Rey y sus Redonditos de Ricota, who had started in 1977, were growing a larger following on a monthly basis. In 1979 in La Plata, Federico Moura would form a <b>pioneering</b> new <b>wave</b> band called Virus. In Buenos Aires, three young men influenced by the advent of post-punk in Britain started exchanging ideas, and decided to form a band with the name Soda Stereo.|$|R
5000|$|Richard Barbieri ( [...] ; born 30 November 1957, in London, England) is an English {{synthesizer}} player, keyboardist and composer. Originally {{coming to}} {{prominence in the}} late-1970s and early-1980s {{as a member of}} new <b>wave</b> <b>pioneers</b> Japan (and their brief 1989-1991 reincarnation as Rain Tree Crow), more recently he is known as the keyboard player in the progressive rock band Porcupine Tree, which he joined in 1993.|$|R
40|$|The <b>Pioneer</b> Venus plasma <b>wave</b> {{instrument}} is described {{with a discussion}} of wave observations throughout the typical near-noon and near-midnight orbits. This is followed by a comparison of the bow shock turbulence characteristics at earth and at Venus. The wave-particle interactions detected near the dayside ionopause are analyzed showing that the whistler mode Landau damping develops when the B field direction changes so that the whistler becomes oblique...|$|R
25|$|The {{traditionally}} Gaelic-speaking {{areas of}} Scotland (the Highlands and Hebrides) are still {{referred to in}} the Gaelic language as a' Ghàidhealtachd ("the Gaeldom"). Irish monks, and the Celtic church, <b>pioneered</b> a <b>wave</b> of Irish emigration into Great Britain, and continental Europe (and they were possibly the first inhabitants of the Faroe Islands and Iceland). Throughout early Medieval times Britain and continental Europe experienced Irish immigration of varying intensity, mostly from clerics and scholars who are collectively known as peregrini. Irish emigration to western Europe, and especially to Great Britain, has continued at a greater or lesser pace since then. Today, the ethnic-Irish are the single largest minority group in both England and Scotland, most of whom eventually made it back to Ireland.|$|R
5000|$|Quando Quango remain {{best known}} for the dance singles [...] "Love Tempo," [...] which reached number four on the US Billboard Dance Chart, and [...] "Atom Rock." [...] Their sound was the result of an eclectic mix of Latin, jazz, reggae and disco, all in a <b>pioneering</b> new <b>wave</b> context. Hillegonda Rietveld said, {{describing}} the group's music, [...] "...Fela Kuti meets Kraftwerk somewhere between Manchester and Rotterdam, part of a new wave of post-punk electronica, with a whole lot of Mike Pickering's admirably broad knowledge of soul, disco, reggae and pop to stuff the gaps". Bernard Sumner of Joy Division and New Order, who with Donald Johnson of A Certain Ratio produced early Quando Quango recordings, was a major influence on the group.|$|R
40|$|A strong interplanetary shock was {{detected}} by the Pioneer 8 magnetometer, plasma probe, and wave instrument at 0048 UT, on June 11, 1968. During {{the rest of this}} day the interplanetary medium was highly disturbed as seven well-defined current layers or D sheets, {{as well as a number}} of other localized interaction regions, swept past the spacecraft. The local plasma characteristics that were best correlated with passage of the D sheets appeared to involve changes in the suprathermal electron population. Changes in the 400 -Hz wave levels were also detected near the discontinuities during periods when the local ion plasma frequency was near 400 Hz, but the limited measurement capability of the <b>Pioneer</b> 8 <b>wave</b> instrument does not allow an unambiguous identification of the wave-particle interactions associated with these measurements...|$|R
