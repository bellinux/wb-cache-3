40|$|Introduction Electives and selectives in {{developing}} countries {{are an important part}} of student learning experiences. During 2013, Bond University on the Gold Coast of Queensland in Australia piloted final year undergraduate medical student placements (n= 33) at Kirakira Hospital, on Makira Island in the Solomon Islands. The placement was evaluated that year. Methods The clinical placement in Kirakira Hospital required 12 months of planning by the Faculty of Health Sciences and Medicine of Bond University in 2012. The evaluation of 2013 placements included a literature review; semi-structured interviews with <b>participating</b> <b>Bond</b> University and Kirakira Hospital staff, and with community members (n= 16); an electronic survey (n= 18); a focus group with participating students (n= 9); and a written report with recommendations. Results All groups that participated in the evaluation – the students, Bond University faculty, Kirakira Hospital staff and community members – found that this was an extremely valuable, personally safe, clinically fascinating and professionally life changing student experience, which was greatly appreciated by, and contributes to, the local Kirakira community. The greatest strength of the program was the peer mentoring and supervision model – whereby four students worked in pairs supported by nurses, the doctor and local community. The main challenges were the supervision arrangements and available resources. Conclusions Placements {{in developing}} countries can be career highlights for all students. This placement now has a solid foundation, is philosophically sound and provides multidisciplinary Australian students with a great experience, and leaves a long term legacy to the community...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{deals with}} use of public debt {{mezzanine}} instruments, which include <b>participating</b> <b>bonds,</b> subordinated bonds, convertible bonds and bonds with warrants, by non-financial corporations and financial corporations in the Czech Republic. It aims to analyse and evaluate use of mezzanine financing instruments {{in the form of}} public debt mezzanine by selected economic entities in the Czech Republic in 2006 – 2012, and identify factors affecting the scope of their utilization. The performed research implies that public debt mezzanine instruments are used in the Czech Republic marginally only. Within the monitored period, these instruments were issued in the total volume of CZK 13. 43 bn (i. e. about EUR 0. 49 bn), where subordinated bonds got a share of CZK 13. 26 bn (i. e. about EUR 0. 48 bn). The share of newly issued public debt mezzanine instruments in the total financial sources of non-financial corporations and financial corporations within the monitored period was on the top in 2009, when it amounted to 0. 08 %. Wider utilization of public debt mezzanine instruments is particularly prevented by the fact that potential issuers are afraid of high costs relating to the process of issuance, but also to the life cycle of such an issue, and they are also afraid of lack of interest of investors (in the case of subordinated <b>bonds</b> and <b>participating</b> <b>bonds),</b> the owners’ fear of extension of control (in the case of convertible bonds and bonds with warrants), or {{the fact that it is}} difficult to estimate the cost of capital (in the case of <b>participating</b> <b>bonds)</b> ...|$|R

50|$|Esters {{are more}} polar than ethers but less polar than alcohols. They <b>participate</b> in {{hydrogen}} <b>bonds</b> as hydrogen-bond acceptors, but cannot act as hydrogen-bond donors, unlike their parent alcohols. This ability to <b>participate</b> in hydrogen <b>bonding</b> confers some water-solubility. Because of {{their lack of}} hydrogen-bond-donating ability, esters do not self-associate. Consequently, esters are more volatile than carboxylic acids of similar molecular weight.|$|R

Both single bondCOOH and phenolic single bondOH (OHph) groups, predicted in several experimental studies {{to be present}} in o-SWNTs, were considered at the tips of armchair and zigzag tubes with varying diameters. Hydrogen bonding, where carbonyl oxygen acts as proton acceptor while phenolic OH donates the proton, leads to the most stable isomers, with a H-bond energy of 9 – 12 kcal/mol, almost double that of simpler systems. Vibrational frequencies of <b>participating</b> <b>bonds</b> are significantly red-shifted, which is not reflected in experimental spectra, and which leads to the conclusion that phenolic OH is likely not present at the tips of o-SWNTs...|$|R

50|$|Bond {{length is}} related to bond order: when more {{electrons}} <b>participate</b> in <b>bond</b> formation the bond is shorter. Bond length is also inversely related to bond strength and the bond dissociation energy: all other factors being equal, a stronger bond will be shorter.

50|$|A quintuple bond in {{chemistry}} {{is an unusual}} type of chemical bond, first reported in 2005 for a dichromium compound. Single bonds, double bonds, and triple bonds are commonplace {{in chemistry}}. Quadruple bonds are rarer but are currently known only among the transition metals, especially for Cr, Mo, W, and Re, e.g. Mo2Cl84− and Re2Cl82−.
