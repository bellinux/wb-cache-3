50|$|Goodsell Amplifiers is an Atlanta, Georgia (U.S. state) based {{boutique}} guitar amplifier company. The {{owner and}} founder of the company is Richard Goodsell. The company originally began as an organ repair service before making its transfer to the guitar market. Owning an organ repair business had a large influence on Goodsell's amp design. His famous Goodsell 17 (now referred to as the Super 17), was originally made by leftover Hammond Organ components. Using this unusual combination of left over organ components and a Class-A EL-84 vacuum tube combo amplifier, Goodsell created his signature sound. What guitar players favor about Goodsell amplifiers is how simple the amplifiers are designed, with a very simple circuit. As a result, there is a <b>pure</b> <b>signal</b> in the amp which is not filtered therefore the amplifiers are much quieter. Nothing extra has been added the amplifier that will alter the guitars natural signal that is going to the amp.|$|E
5000|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 1990s, poor sales relegated many of the {{existing}} stock of Prosonics to closeout sale status. Theories abound as to why it was never a great success with players; foremost was its high price. It was simply perceived as too much money despite innovative design and glowing reviews. The Prosonic also suffered from something of an identity crisis; the cosmetics suggested classic Fender tones, and many players desiring an amp for blues or country playing, for example, were put off by the over-the-top lead channel. Conversely, the demographic for high-gain amplifiers, generally the domain of practitioners of heavy metal and the fledgling nu metal genre, and dominated by products from Marshall and Mesa Boogie, had long written off Fender as incapable of producing amplifiers catering to their style. The combo's 10-inch speakers, though specially designed and voiced for the Prosonic to handle huge amounts of power, were seen as too small by players favoring 12-inch speakers. The mechanical relay-based channel switching, designed to provide a more <b>pure</b> <b>signal</b> path, produced a large pop upon channel switching at low volumes, unlike other electronically buffered designs—this deliberate design choice was nonetheless perceived as the premier [...] "design flaw" [...] among players. Several of the Prosonic's other quirkier design elements, such as the shared EQ and line-level effects loop, were designed for studio use and weren't ideal for live playing. Understandably, buyers were attracted to the amp's flexibility and, when used on-stage, these studio-friendly features were perceived as design flaws. Like with many other high-powered combo amplifiers, the Prosonic's weight, at 60 lbs, was another less-than-popular characteristic.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Gas chromatography-mass {{spectrometry}} (GC-MS) is {{a widely}} used analytical technique for the identification and quantification of trace chemicals in complex mixtures. When complex samples are analyzed by GC-MS {{it is common to}} observe co-elution of two or more components, resulting in an overlap of signal peaks observed in the total ion chromatogram. In such situations manual signal analysis is often the most reliable means for the extraction of pure component signals; however, a systematic manual analysis over a number of samples is both tedious and prone to error. In the past 30 years a number of computational approaches were proposed to assist in the process of the extraction of <b>pure</b> <b>signals</b> from co-eluting GC-MS components. This includes empirical methods, comparison with library spectra, eigenvalue analysis, regression and others. However, to date no approach has been recognized as best, nor accepted as standard. This situation hampers general GC-MS capabilities, and in particular has implications for the development of robust, high-throughput GC-MS analytical protocols required in metabolic profiling and biomarker discovery. Here we first discuss the nature of GC-MS data, and then review some of the approaches proposed for the extraction of <b>pure</b> <b>signals</b> from co-eluting components. We summarize and classify different approaches to this problem, and examine why so many approaches proposed in the past have {{failed to live up to}} their full promise. Finally, we give some thoughts on the future developments in this field, and suggest that the progress in general computing capabilities attained in the past two decades has opened new horizons for tackling this important problem. </p...|$|R

40|$|Bush-crickets (Orthoptera: Tettigoniidae) {{generate}} sound using tegminal stridulation. Signalling {{effectiveness is}} affected by the widely varying acoustic parameters of temporal pattern, frequency and spectral purity (tonality). During stridulation, frequency multiplication occurs as a scraper on one wing scrapes across a file of sclerotized teeth on the other. The frequency with which these tooth–scraper interactions occur, along with radiating wing cell resonant properties, dictates both frequency and tonality in the call. Bush-cricket species produce calls ranging from resonant, tonal calls through to non-resonant, broadband signals. The differences are believed to result from differences in file tooth arrangement and wing radiators, but a systematic test of the structural causes of broadband or tonal calls is lacking. Using phylogenetically controlled structural equation models, we show that parameters of file tooth density and file length are the best-fitting predictors of tonality across 40 bush-cricket species. Features of file morphology constrain the production of spectrally <b>pure</b> <b>signals,</b> but systematic distribution of teeth alone does not explain pure-tone sound production in this family...|$|R
