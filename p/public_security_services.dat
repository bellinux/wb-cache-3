50|$|With {{the move}} of the Federal Capital in 1960, the DFSP moved to Brasília, {{providing}} Guanabara State with their <b>public</b> <b>security</b> <b>services</b> and personnel. Due to {{the shortage of}} staff, the DFSP had to be restructured, merging its staff with another local security agency from Brasila, called the Special Guard of Brasilia (GEB). Afterwards, the DFSP was refurbished with an attempt to improve the Agency structure to mimic {{the model of the}} United States FBI and police forces in England and Canada, as well as to expand operations throughout the whole Brazilian territory. From November 16, 1964, day edition of the Law No. 4483 and up to date now celebrated as its largest. Also in 1967, the new Brazilian Constitution changed the agency name to Departamento de Policia Federal (Department of Federal Police) through art.210 of Decree-Law No. 200 of February 25, 1967. As a federal investigation agency, the mainly government idea (after the 1960s) was to mold the Federal Police with the shape and effectiveness of the American FBI. Accordingly, in the year of 1996, all position applications in the Federal Police required a bachelor's degree.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis article {{analyzes}} the technical efficiency, the Total Factor Productivity (TFP) and the technological gap in <b>public</b> <b>security</b> <b>services</b> in Brazilian States. The order—m frontier {{is used for}} results estimation. The TFP variation is built by decomposing the Malmquist productivity index into technical efficiency, scale efficiency and technological variation. More than 50 % of the federative units were considered technically inefficient. Out of the 27 federative units, 12 presented a positive total productivity while all others suffered total productivity losses. Productivity gains in public security are more related to scale aspects than to efficiency improvements and technological progress...|$|E

50|$|The {{numbers of}} the Garde mobile had been reduced along with the army by the exigencies of the armistice. Accordingly a law was passed on 23 April 1941 to tackle the {{maintenance}} of order, mandating {{the creation of the}} GMR. According to a subsequent decree of 7 July they would be attached to the regional <b>public</b> <b>security</b> <b>service</b> and answerable to the police intendent (a position established by the law of 19 April 1941) under the authority of the regional prefect.These police units were assembled in the zone libre from autumn 1941 onwards, and deployed throughout occupied France by the end of 1942. The law of 17 April established centrally a leadership of the GMT, and, regionally, area instructions. This civil paramilitary force was original envisaged to maintain order in an urban setting. However, from autumn 1943, it was involved in operations against the French Resistance, in which it often proved much more zealous than the Garde mobile.|$|R
40|$|Mieczysław Moczar was {{a member}} of the International Organization for Helping Rewolutionists before 1939. During the World War II he was a {{district}} commander of Gwardia Ludowa (People’s Guard) and Armia Ludowa (People’s Army) in Łódź, Lublin and Kielce. He became a chief of the Provincial Office for <b>Public</b> <b>Security</b> (WUBP) of Łódź in January 1945 and then he served in Ministry of <b>Public</b> <b>Security</b> (MBP) for a short time. In the summer of 1948 he was linked with the case of Władysław Gomułka and the so-called rightist-nationalist deviation and finally the communist party reprimended him and debared from central authorities. In September 1948 he started his activity as a voivode and then as a chairman of Województka Rada Narodowa (People’s Provincial Council) in Olsztyn. In April 1952 he took the same post in Białystok and in 1954 in Warsaw, and he was active there to April 1956. The <b>public</b> <b>security</b> <b>service</b> as well as local PZPR (Polish United Workers’ Party) organizations treated him with distrust all this time. He realised all directions of his authorities very actively to save his position in Stalinist elite of power. Such actions as a veryfication of autochthons, showed his attempting to probe his usefulness. The period since September 1948 to April 1956 is poor-known in Moczar’s biography. Although ha was not at the top of power then, his activity generated controversial opinions. Zadanie pt.

5000|$|Overall, in {{the years}} 1944-1956 around 300,000 Polish {{citizens}} had been arrested, of whom many thousands were sentenced to long-term imprisonment. There were 6,000 death sentences pronounced, {{the majority of them}} carried out [...] "in the majesty of the law". A special disciplinary legislation had been introduced, which allowed for the sentencing of civil persons before military tribunals including young people and children. The courts were concerned with the alleged crimes, not the age and the maturity of its victims. For many years, the public prosecutors and judges as well as functionaries of the Ministry of <b>Public</b> <b>Security,</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Service</b> of the Ministry of Internal Affairs (SB) and Main Directorate of Information of the Polish Army (GZI WP) engaged in acts recognized by international law as crimes against humanity and crimes against peace. The so-called [...] "Cursed soldiers" [...] of the anti-communist resistance, who opposed the new occupiers and attacked the Stalinist strongholds, were eventually hunted down by MBP <b>security</b> <b>services</b> and assassination squads. The underground structures had been destroyed, and most members of the Armia Krajowa and WiN who remained opposed to communism, were executed after kangaroo trials (staged by Wolińska-Brus and Zarakowski among others), or deported to the Soviet GULAG system.|$|R
50|$|An actual Swiss Railway Police did {{not exist}} until the late 1990s. Prior to this, a number of train attendants were sworn in, {{equipped}} with a sidearm and ordered to provide <b>security</b> <b>services</b> {{in addition to their}} main duties. In the early 1990s, internal employees were recruited into a security force called Bahnpolizei (Bapo) or Railway Police, responsible for the safety on the S-Bahn, the public suburban railway network in Zurich. Its officers were equipped with a baton and a pepper spray but were not allowed to carry a firearm and had very limited authority. In the meantime, the Swiss Federal Railways SBB and Securitas AG established the <b>Public</b> Transport <b>Security</b> <b>Services</b> Securitrans AG, where the Bapo was subsequently embedded in. With the passage of the Federal Act on the <b>Security</b> Units of <b>Public</b> Transport Companies in 2010, the Railway Police returned under SBB’s umbrella and was renamed to Transport Police for legal reasons. In 2012, the Ordinance on the <b>Security</b> Units of <b>Public</b> Transport Companies was issued that extended the Transport Police's authority and allowed its officers to carry a sidearm. Today, the Transport Police and Securitrans coexist with different fields of duty.|$|R
40|$|When {{implementing}} <b>public</b> key <b>security</b> <b>services</b> {{in mobile}} ad hoc networks (MANETs), multiple certificate authority (CA) servers are usually adopted {{to increase the}} security of the system, with each CA node holding only one share of the private key. To prevent an adversary from collecting a large enough number of shares {{over a long period of}} time to compromise the system, the shares will be periodically updated. However, it is not trivial how this update procedure can be done efficiently in a MANET. In this paper, we devise an efficient distributed secret key share update scheme for MANETs based on the cluster architecture. In our scheme, the secret shares are updated first by a small group of server nodes. With the assistance of the cluster head in each cluster, the updated servers then refresh the shares in the remaining servers. We evaluate our scheme by simulation and show that our scheme can expedite the share update process. © 2007 IEEE. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

5000|$|Upon {{the death}} of General Gomez on December 17, 1935, Lopez Contreas became President. The next year, as Commander in Chief of the armed forces, he ordered the raising of a National Frontier Police to protect the {{national}} borders and raised mounted security units to protect the peace in the Venezuelan plains. On that same year a Spanish military mission arrived to help form and train a fully national police force, led by Captain Cecillo Suarez of the Civil Guard. The Technical Services School's Special Classes, by that year moved to Caracas, became independent and on September 16, 1935, was disbanded.
