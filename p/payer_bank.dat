50|$|From the 1970s, {{banks have}} sought to reduce {{operating}} costs by adopting new technologies. The use of the Bank State Branch (BSB) identifier {{was introduced in the}} early 1970s with the introduction of MICR on cheques to mechanise the process of data capture by the banks as well as for mechanical sorting and bundling of the physical cheques for forwarding to the <b>payer</b> <b>bank</b> branch for final cheque clearance. Since then, BSBs have been used in electronic transactions (but is not in financial card numbering). The rollout of automated teller machines (ATMs) commenced in 1969.|$|E
5000|$|Following the {{introduction}} in the United Kingdom in the 1960s of a [...] "sort code", a comparable BSB identifier system {{was introduced in}} Australia in the early 1970s to streamline cheque clearance through the banking system in Australia. At the time the clearance systems were open only to financial institutions registered as banks. The BSB and account number was printed on cheques in MICR format to streamline the process of data capture {{as well as for}} mechanical sorting and bundling of the physical cheques for forwarding to the <b>payer</b> <b>bank</b> branch for final cheque clearance. Other financial institutions had to use banks as intermediaries to access the clearance of their [...] "payment orders", which were the non-banking equivalents of cheques.|$|E
5000|$|... "Float {{is money}} in the banking system that is counted twice, for a brief time, because of delays in {{processing}} checks or any transfer of cash", {{as defined by the}} Reserve Banks of United States. It is most obvious in the time delay between a cheque being written and the funds to cover that cheque being deducted from the payer's account. Once the payee or recipient of a cheque deposits it in a bank account, the bank provisionally credits the account and thus increases the payee's account in demand deposit, assuming that the <b>payer's</b> <b>bank</b> will ultimately send the funds to cover the cheque. Until the <b>payer's</b> <b>bank</b> actually sends the funds, both payer and payee have the [...] "same" [...] money in both of their accounts. Once the payee's <b>bank</b> notifies the <b>payer's</b> <b>bank</b> by presenting the cheques, the [...] "duplicate" [...] funds will be removed from the payer's account, and the cheques will be considered to have [...] "cleared" [...] the bank.|$|R
50|$|In Poland, {{direct debit}} is {{operated}} by KIR (Krajowa Izba Rozliczeniowa) and participating banks {{as one of}} the functionalities of the Elixir clearing system. The payer has to authorize the payee by filling, signing and submitting a standarized paper form in two copies. One copy, after filling in payee details and a customer identification number, is sent by the payee to the <b>payer's</b> <b>bank,</b> which verifies the signature. From now on, the payee may debit the payer's account. Since 24 Oct 2012 it is also possible to submit such authorization through the <b>payer's</b> <b>bank,</b> often also online.|$|R
50|$|In recent years, a new {{variant of}} {{friendly}} fraud, involving bank transfers {{as opposed to}} credit card payments, has been documented in Europe.

But, it is undeniable that the state frequently has difficulties to collect it due to the great numbers of tax payers who do not obedient in making the tax payments. The tax payers less aware of the important meaning of tax, {{in which they are}} often in delinquent tax until their tax debts become accumulated.

50|$|Under the {{guarantee}} a payer {{is entitled to}} a full and immediate refund {{in the event of}} an error in the payment of a Direct Debit from their account.

5000|$|A {{direct debit}} {{requires}} the payer authorize the payee take a direct debit for any amount at any time, or to instruct {{the bank to}} honour direct debit requests from a specified payee. The payee has full control over the payments. They can vary the amount and frequency of payments without further authorisation from the customer (subject to providing the customer with the required advance notice). [...] The payer has no direct control over these payments, but can cancel the direct debit at any time, with no reason required, and require the return of disputed payments. It {{is not possible to}} authorise an individual to take direct debits; only organisations that have a contract with the <b>payer's</b> <b>bank,</b> or have been vetted by it, can do this.|$|R

40|$|From 1 November 2009 {{came into}} force Emergency Ordinance No. 113 / 2009, which {{introduced}} into Romanian legislation the Directive on Payment Services (PSD "Payment Services Directive") applicable in the European Union (EU) and European Economic Space (EES). These regulations are intended transparency of banking information for payment services {{to create a}} single legal framework at the European Union and European Economic Space {{in the field of}} payment services and the protection of consumers of these services. The regulations of the Directive on payment services are applied to all payment transactions in the currency of each Member State of the European Union and European Economic Space, provided that the two <b>banks</b> - the <b>payer's</b> <b>bank</b> and the beneficiary's bank – are located in a Member State. Payment services coming under the impact of new legislation are: payment by bill of exchange, electronic payments, payments by credit card, payments made by direct debit, cash transactions, provided the payment and transfer of funds (the giving of money) under conditions of transparency and information to users and to comply with a set of laws and obligations on the part of all those involved in this operation...|$|R
50|$|In Germany, Austria, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Scandinavia, cheques {{have almost}} {{completely}} vanished {{in favour of}} direct bank transfers and electronic payments. Direct bank transfers, using so-called giro transfers, have been standard procedure since the 1950s to send and receive regular payments like rent and wages and even mail-order invoices. In the Netherlands, Austria, and Germany, all kinds of invoices are commonly accompanied by so-called acceptgiros (Netherlands) or Überweisungen (German), which are essentially standardized bank transfer order forms preprinted with the payee's account details and the amount payable. The payer fills in his account details and hands the form to a clerk at his bank, which will then transfer the money. It is also very common to allow the payee to automatically withdraw the requested amount from the payer's account (Lastschrifteinzug (German) or Incasso (machtiging) (Netherlands)). Though similar to paying by cheque, the payee only needs the <b>payer's</b> <b>bank</b> and account number. Since the early 1990s, this method of payment has also been available to merchants. Due to this, credit cards are rather uncommon in Germany, Austria and the Netherlands, and are mostly used to give access to credit {{rather than as a}} payment mechanism. However, debit cards are widespread in these countries, since virtually all Austrian, German and Dutch banks issue debit cards instead of simple ATM cards for use on current accounts. Acceptance of cheques has been further diminished since the late 1990s, because of the abolition of the Eurocheque. Cashing a foreign bank cheque is possible, but usually very expensive.|$|R
40|$|Payment systems come in many forms, {{but their}} purpose {{is always the}} same - namely, to enable people to {{transfer}} funds from an account at one bank to an account at another bank. The alternative for the payer and the payee would be to settle their transaction either using cash or by barter. Banks themselves also use payment systems to transfer funds {{as a result of their}} own transactions (as distinct from their customers’). Whatever its particular form, a payment system can be seen as comprising three main elements or processes: A means of authorising and initiating the payment ie the means by which the payer gives authority to his bank for funds to be transferred. A means of transmitting and exchanging the payment instruction between the banks involved - usually referred to as clearing. A means of settlement between the banks involved - ie the <b>payer’s</b> <b>bank</b> has to compensate the payee’s bank, either bilaterally or through accounts that the banks hold at a third-party settlement agent, usually (but not always) the central bank. This Handbook considers these processes in more detail, and in particular the risks and policy issues that they present. A recurring theme is that, while there are a number of common risks and problems to be addressed, there is no single ideal way of addressing them. Solutions adopted in one country may not necessarily be appropriate in another. Another important message is that, in developing a new payment system or modifying an existing one, the emphasis must be on agreement and co-operation - both between central bank and commercial banks as the operators of the system, and between the system operators and its customers. This handbook is also available in Arabic and Spanish. Payment Systems...|$|R

Also, these entities tend more mature, larger, and have higher debt ratio relative to entities with lower dividend average...|$|R
50|$|Medical Banking {{involves}} the use banking systems to improve healthcare industry. It is the involvement of banks into the healthcare value chain to reduce costs,increase access and simplify delivery of healthcare. Medical banking integrates various stakeholders (providers, <b>payers,</b> clearing houses, <b>banks</b> and specialized firms). Processes like payment of premiums by consumers, claims submission by the provider, claim status checking etc. can be time consuming and involves a lot of paperwork. The Medical Banking concept proposes the handling such processes electronically by leveraging current banking systems. Medical Banking can also help safeguard medical records related to a consumer electronically under the custody of a bank. Medical Banking can also provide support to Consumer Directed Health Plans. CDHPs offer accounts like Health Savings Account (HSA), Flexible Savings Account (FSA) which, being tax-free, help consumers save money for their future medical needs.|$|R
5000|$|In the United Kingdom and {{in other}} {{countries}} the term giro may refer to a specific system once operated by the post office. In the UK, the giro service was originally known as National Giro. In due course [...] "giro" [...] {{was adopted by the}} public and the press as a shorthand term for the girocheque, which was a cheque and not a credit transfer. Meanwhile there were Bank Giro Credits, which were instructions to credit a particular bank account: these were not instructions to debit another account, so they had to be accompanied with cash or cheques, and they could be used both for bill payments and as paying-in slips; when used for paying bills they were often free-of-charge to the payer when used at the <b>payer's</b> or payee's <b>bank</b> but with an administration charge at other banks.|$|R
50|$|The {{participants}} in the swaption market are predominantly large corporations, banks, financial institutions and hedge funds. End users such as corporations and banks typically use swaptions to manage interest rate risk arising from their core business or from their financing arrangements. For example, a corporation wanting protection from rising interest rates might buy a <b>payer</b> swaption. A <b>bank</b> that holds a mortgage portfolio might buy a receiver swaption to protect against lower interest rates {{that might lead to}} early prepayment of the mortgages. A hedge fund believing that interest rates will not rise by more than a certain amount might sell a payer swaption, aiming to make money by collecting the premium. Major investment and commercial banks such as JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America Securities and Citigroup make markets in swaptions in the major currencies, and these banks trade amongst themselves in the swaption interbank market. The market making banks typically manage large portfolios of swaptions that they have written with various counterparties. A significant investment in technology and human capital is required to properly monitor the resulting exposure. Swaption markets exist in most of the major currencies in the world, the largest markets being in U.S. dollars, euro, sterling and Japanese yen.|$|R
40|$|Demand deposit is {{a banking}} {{term for the}} method of payment which is mostly {{reversed}} to checking system; it is an order to transfer a sum of money from one account to another as specified in the order. After a check {{is given to the}} payee who saves it in his bank account, while demand deposit is given by a payer to a payee 2 ̆ 7 s bank and will transfer it to the payee 2 ̆ 7 s bank account. The difference lies on the ‘push and pull 2 ̆ 7 system. A check is a ‘pull 2 ̆ 7 transaction; by showing a check, the bank that receives the payment will find its fund in the payer 2 ̆ 7 s bank and will draw the money if it is available. If it is unavailable, the check will be ‘bounced 2 ̆ 7 and will be returned by informing that the fund is insufficient. On the other hand, a demand deposit is a ‘push 2 ̆ 7 transaction; a <b>payer</b> orders his <b>bank</b> to transfer his money in his account to the payee 2 ̆ 7 s account so that the latter can withdraw it. Therefore, a demand deposit cannot be bounced since the bank only processes the order from the payer if there is enough fund in his account...|$|R
