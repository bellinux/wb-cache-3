5|$|The {{mathematical}} {{concept of}} a Hilbert space, named after David Hilbert, generalizes the notion of Euclidean space. It extends the methods of vector algebra and calculus from the two-dimensional Euclidean plane and three-dimensional space to spaces with any finite or infinite number of dimensions. A Hilbert space is an abstract vector space <b>possessing</b> <b>the</b> structure of an inner product that allows length and angle to be measured. Furthermore, Hilbert spaces are complete: there are enough limits in the space to allow the techniques of calculus to be used.|$|E
5|$|Khandoba (IAST: Khaṇḍobā), Martanda Bhairava or Malhari, is a Hindu deity worshipped as {{a manifestation}} of Shiva mainly in the Deccan plateau of India, {{especially}} in the states of Maharashtra and Karnataka. He is the most popular Kuladaivat (family deity) in Maharashtra. He is also the patron deity of select warrior, farming, herding and Brahmin (priestly) castes as well as several of the hunter/gatherer tribes that are native to the hills and forests of this region. The cult of Khandoba has linkages with Vaishnava and Jain traditions, and also assimilates all communities irrespective of caste, including Muslims. The worship of Khandoba developed during the 9th and 10th centuries from a folk deity into a composite god <b>possessing</b> <b>the</b> attributes of Shiva, Bhairava, Surya and Karttikeya (Skanda). He is depicted either {{in the form of a}} Lingam, or as an image of a warrior riding on a bull or a horse. The foremost centre of Khandoba worship is Jejuri in Maharashtra. The legends of Khandoba, found in the text Malhari Mahatmya and also narrated in folk songs, revolve around his victory over demons Mani-malla and his marriages.|$|E

On 6 March 1967, the Air Force released {{a request for}} information to 21 defense contractors for the A-X. The objective {{was to create a}} design study for a low-cost attack aircraft. In 1969, the Secretary of the Air Force asked Pierre Sprey to write the detailed specifications for the proposed A-X project; Sprey's initial involvement was kept secret due to his earlier controversial involvement in the F-X project. Sprey's discussions with Skyraider pilots operating in Vietnam and analysis of aircraft used in the role indicated the ideal aircraft should have long loiter time, low-speed maneuverability, massive cannon firepower, and extreme survivability; <b>possessing</b> <b>the</b> best elements of the Ilyushin Il-2, Henschel Hs 129, and Skyraider. The specifications also demanded that each aircraft cost less than $3million. Sprey required that the biography of World War II Luftwaffe attack pilot Hans-Ulrich Rudel be read by people on the A-X program.|$|E

When Elspeth learns that Snow White is still alive, she prepares a poisoned apple and transforms into Josephine, Snow White's deceased mother, with the magic mirror the Green-Eyed One gave her. Aided by Monday, who is turned into a garden gnome afterward, Elspeth, disguised as Josephine, finds her and convinces her to eat the enchanted and poisoned apple, which seemingly kills Snow White.|$|E

5|$|White's kicking {{accuracy}} was {{of particular}} note for a ruckman—his goal-kicking accuracy finished at {{slightly less than}} 60%. He was a consistent exponent of the spectacular mark, preferring to take chest marks high over packs. He was nominated on several occasions for the Mark of the Year, but he never won the award. His ball-skills and work around the ground remained one of his greatest strengths throughout his career. He effected 5000 hit-outs in his AFL career, the most by any one player since records began in 1987, with a career-high game total of 47 during a resounding round-22 win over West Coast Eagles in 2000. Testament to his durability and consistency, he was {{ranked in the top}} five in the AFL in total number of hit-outs for nine consecutive seasons from 1999. At 195cm, White is relatively short for a ruckman, and operated more as a ruck-rover than as a traditional ruckman. He was noted for his athleticism and vertical-leap, which helped him overcome his lack of height in comparison to other ruckmen. His approach to ruck-work—with greater emphasis on <b>possessing</b> <b>the</b> ball and working around the ground—helped him adapt to the changed centre-circle rules, and compensated for his lack of height and diminished ability at stoppages. Following the departure of Jim Stynes from Melbourne, White later worked on his game with former ruckman Sam Newman. Percy Johnson, Stynes and finally Newman guided and influenced White's ruck-work during his career.|$|E
