40|$|This {{study in}} Public Administration uses {{feminism}} and historical institutionalism to analyze a highly debated contemporary policy problem that concerns gender {{equality in the}} policy of parental leave. The <b>parental</b> <b>insurance</b> was introduced in 1974 with the governmental goal of gender equality. In 1974 only 0, 5 percent {{of the number of}} days of parental benefit was paid to men. Today, 40 years later, the goal remains the same and the numbers of days of parental benefit paid to men are 24, 8 percent. The debate that has characterized the Swedish policy of <b>parental</b> <b>insurance</b> and specifically the design of the parental benefit is the debate of freedom of choice versus quota. Our study focuses on ideas and arguments that influence the policy of parental benefit. The study assumes, with basis in the theories of feminism and historical institutionalism, that a policy like parental benefit is slow-moving and that path dependency has lead to a slow development of gender equality...|$|E
40|$|Over {{six million}} insured {{children}} belong to families where {{the parents in}} their household lack health insurance. Studies have indicated insured low-income children with uninsured parents {{are less likely to}} have physician visits and well-child visits than their counterparts with insured parents. However, self-selection may be responsible for the relationship found between <b>parental</b> <b>insurance</b> and well-child visits. No studies have been undertaken to examine the impact of <b>parental</b> <b>insurance</b> on the utilization of children with chronic conditions.

The objectives of the study are to estimate the effect of health insurance for the primary parent on (1) insured children 2 ̆ 7 s well-child visits and (2) physician visits for asthma in insured children. This study used a cross-sectional design. The data source was the 2007 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey-Household Component. The sample consisted of children 17 years or less who were insured through the same source(s) for the entire year and had a primary parent who was either insured or uninsured the entire year. The dependent variable for the entire sample was whether or not the child had at least one well-child visit during the year. The dependent variables for the subsample of children with asthma were (1) whether or not the child had at least one asthma-related physician visit and (2) whether or not the child had at least two asthma-related physician visits. The independent variables were the same for the three analyses and were selected to represent the Social Cognitive Theory determinants. These included parent (insurance, sex, worry, education, language, employment, health use, health, risk aversion, and self care expectation), child (source of coverage, age, health, race, and oldest child), and household (Metropolitan Statistical Area, region, number of children, number of parents, and income) variables. Probit and bivariate probit models were estimated for each dependent variable.

However, {{little is known about}} whether the type of <b>parental</b> <b>insurance</b> matters. This study attempts to determine whether the type of <b>parental</b> <b>insurance</b> affects the access to health care services of children. I used data from the 2009 – 2013 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey and estimated multivariate logistic regressions (N= 26, 152). I estimated how family insurance coverage affects the probability that children have a usual source of care, well-child visits in the past year, unmet medical and prescription needs, less than 1 dental visit per year, and unmet dental needs. Children in families with mixed insurance (child publicly insured and parent privately insured) were less likely to have a well-child visit than children in privately insured families (odds ratio= 0. 86, 95 % confidence interval 0. 76 – 0. 98). When restricting the sample to publicly insured children, children with privately insured parents were less likely to have a well-child visit (odds ratio= 0. 82, 95 % confidence interval 0. 73 – 0. 92), less likely to have a usual source of care (odds ratio= 0. 79, 95 % confidence interval 0. 67 – 0. 94), and more likely to have unmet dental needs (odds ratio= 1. 68, 95 % confidence interval 1. 10 – 2. 58). Children in families with mixed insurance tend to fare poorly compared to children in publicly insured families. This may indicate that children in these families may be underinsured.

40|$|Sweden was {{the first}} country to {{introduce}} paid parental leave also to fathers in 1974, and this legislation has since then continuously been reformed {{in order to bring}} about a more equal parenthood. This study sets out to discuss the Swedish parental leave system and identify achievements, policy dilemmas and reform alternatives in a European perspective. The structure of <b>parental</b> <b>insurance</b> legislation, with earnings-related benefits and a long leave period, is often seen as a main explanation why Sweden has been able to combine relatively high fertility levels with high female labour force participation rates and low child poverty. In the perspective of changing demographic structures in Europe, with declining fertility levels {{and a growing number of}} elderly, the strengthening of dual earner family policies, including <b>parental</b> <b>insurance</b> legislation, may mitigate macro-economic and demographic problems by increasing gender equality and decreasing the work-family conflict. Despite the positive consequences, unresolved questions exist in the present parental leave legislation. The flexibility of the Swedish system, which still has extensive transferable leave rights, has the consequence that the lion’s share of parental leave days is still taken by mothers, among other things making it difficult for women to compete on equal terms with men in the labour market. Consequently, the gender-based division of parental leave may contribute to a preservation of traditional gender roles and inequalities. Another problem in the Swedish system is the work requirement for eligibility that excludes students and others with weak labour market attachment from the earnings-related benefits, possibly inflicting on the postponement of parenthood. Raising the minimum benefit could be one solution to enable childbearing among persons with weak labour market attachment, but this would also affect the economic incentives for paid work, and thus weaken the dual earner model.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{hitherto}} under-developed relationship between population policy, nationalism and nation-building. It considers {{how and why}} the concepts of demography, population and population policy come into play in a sub-state national jurisdiction where the administration of social policy interacts with nation-building objectives as well as other social and political agendas such as support for the family, reduction of poverty, equal opportunities and employment protection. The thesis is designed to provide readers with general observations and preliminary analyses regarding the social and political role of population policy and public discussions thereof in the context of sub-state nationalism in Québec, federal-provincial relations in Canada, and the judicial process that led to the eventual legislation and implementation of Bill 140 An Act Respecting <b>Parental</b> <b>Insurance</b> in Québec. Bill 140, which {{has come to be known}} as the Québec <b>Parental</b> <b>Insurance</b> Plan, is a parental leave policy that was legislated in the National Assembly of Québec by two different substate national political parties between the years of 2000 and 2006. It had its origins in the Parti Québécois’ 1996 white paper policies. These family policies, which included affordable day care and the reduction of poverty, especially among women and children, were social democratic in their objectives and were informed by various interest groups. As Bill 140 evolved it developed the explicit objectives of encouraging potential and existing Québécois parents to have children and of providing Quebecers with a provincial parental leave scheme separate from that already administered by the Canadian federal government under the Employment Insurance Act. These objectives, it is argued, differed from those initially set in the province’s 1996 white paper. Bill 140 ’s attempted implementation in 2001 by the sovereigntist Parti Québécois failed because of unresolved jurisdictional battles with the Canadian federal government but was successfully legislated in 2005 by the federalist Parti Libérale du Québec, after an administrative agreement was struck between the provincial and federal governments. It is the contention of this thesis that the relationship between population policies, nationalism and nation-building objectives is made much more explicit in a sub-state nation where the legislative and administrative boundaries of a political jurisdiction are often contested and jurisdictional battles can serve to highlight issues around national identity and cultural distinctiveness. In Québec, national identity and cultural distinctiveness are most often claimed in the form of linguistic ‘difference. ’ This ‘difference,’ furthermore, is often granted public credence in the form of provincially administered social policies that are designed for the purpose of ensuring Québec’s ‘national survival. ’ In the context of these broad nation-building objectives, many of which have been the subject of the literature on nations and nationalisms, this thesis explores the extent to which the concepts of population and demography have tended to be overlooked in scholars’ discussions of the reproduction of nationhood. The thesis suggests, therefore, that not only should the reproduction of nations and nationalisms concern us but so too should the policies that concern the reproduction of the nation’s members within a particular national boundary. The thesis concludes by justifying the need for further case studies in this exploratory area of sociology, politics and demography, an area that is currently ripe for further academic investigation...|$|E

The aim of this work is to give a synopsis of the current financial allowances to families in several countries of the European Union and to outline the dissimilarities among them. The partial aim is to point at the inadequate solutions in the state social support system in the Czech Republic and to suggest some more suitable solutions. Diploma work was created {{by means of the}} method of the qualitative research {{with the use of the}} secondary data analysis. The main body comprises five EU member states chosen by the method of the casual selection, regarding to their family policy system (Great Britain, Sweden, Germany, Spain and Slovakia). Information was acquired from several foreign language sources, largely from web sites of the competent departments, and international sources (MISSOC, EURES). Acquiring actual information wasn't always easy because different sources provided dissimilar information. It has figured out that the most important benefit for families is the child allowance, which is paid out in all studied countries. The criteria for the calculation of its rate are different { [...] }the age of a child, the sequence of a child in a family, the income of a family (only in the Czech Republic), eventually health disability of a child. The next benefit provided is the parental allowance, which is paid out only in three surveyed countries (Germany, the Czech Republic and Slovakia), it is paid out in Sweden too, but from <b>parental</b> <b>insurance.</b> The payment of benefits in Germany depends on the monthly income of a family; however, in the Czech Republic and Slovakia a parent, that cares for a child, can support his family without a financial limit, but it is not easy to coordinate work and the care for the family in the Czech Republic, because only small percentage of women has the opportunity to get part-time jobs. In my opinion, we can find the inspiration how to relieve the national budget from costs on payment of parental allowance in Swedish social insurance system, which is financed by contributions from employers, employees and taxes...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{contains}} an introductory chapter and three essays, all considering {{different aspects of}} the Swedish <b>parental</b> <b>insurance.</b> In the first two essays, different aspects of temporary parental leave (leave from work {{to take care of a}} sick child) are investigated, whereas the third essay considers parental leave (leave from work to take care of a new-born child). In the first essay, On the Sharing of Temporary Parental Leave, we study what determines the intra household sharing of temporary parental leave. We find that the sharing of temporary parental leave can be explained by a Stackelberg model with male dominance, indicating that the man first gets to choose his contribution to temporary parental leave. However, we also find that bargaining power influences sharing, and that the stronger the bargaining power, the smaller the individual's share of temporary parental leave. Thus, the inequality regarding the sharing of temporary parental leave works through two channels: firstly, due to men's positions as Stackelberg leaders and secondly, through men, in general, having stronger bargaining power than women. In the second essay, A Comparison of Single and Cohabiting Mothers? Utilization of Temporary Parental Leave, we investigate what influences the utilization of temporary parental leave by single and cohabiting women. We find that single women take more temporary parental leave than cohabiting women, ceteris paribus. We also find that single women with higher educations and incomes take less temporary parental leave than single women with lower educations and incomes, indicating that taking temporary parental leave induces signaling costs, and that single women respond to such costs by taking less temporary parental leave. In the third essay, Satisfaction and ?Comparison Sharing? ? What influences parents? satisfaction with the sharing of parental leave?, we study what induces parents to, ex post, be satisfied with the intra household sharing of parental leave. In particular, we investigate if the probability of satisfaction is influenced by how other similar couples shared parental leave, i. e. if ?comparison sharing? influences satisfaction. We find that parents are more likely to be satisfied with the sharing of parental leave if they shared more equally than similar couples. Thus, we conclude that parents? preferences are interdependent in this respect. In addition, the labor market situation of the parents and/or their financial situation largely influence the sharing of parental leave, and when it does, parents are significantly less likely to be satisfied with sharing...|$|E

30|$|There {{are strong}} {{underlying}} pressures for change. Women’s labour force participation rates are high across the country, {{and not only}} among mothers of school-aged children. While <b>parental</b> leave <b>insurance</b> enables many parents (usually mothers, with the partial exception of Quebec) {{to care for the}} very youngest children for as much as a year, non-parental care is needed by the majority of young Canadian children. As Beach et al note “of more that 70 % of children with both parents or a single parent in the paid labour force, many or most were presumed to be in family childcare provided by an unregulated family childcare provider, an in-home caregiver or a relative for at least part of their parents’ working hours” (2009, p. xi). In addition, Canada’s fertility rate at 1.5 is substantially below replacement rate. Despite the fall in fertility, women’s rising labour force participation rates together with immigration, which remains relatively high, have helped to maintain the proportion working age adults in the population as a whole. In 2003, nearly two-thirds of the population was of working age, while the proportion of senior citizens (13 %) remained lower than that of children under fifteen (18 %) (OECD, 2005, p. 37, Table 2.2).|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The {{point of}} {{departure}} in this thesis is that women live longer than men, while men have more power, influence and resources, and probably better health-related quality of life, than women. In order to judge and act from this situation, the classical idea that both facts and values are needed for conclusion is adopted. The diverse positions of the sexes are mainly assumed {{to depend on the}} gender system, i. e. the societal structure organising human activities and relations, ultimately privileges and burdens, by sex. Hence, abolition of gender is held to be associated with decreased differences in health. The handling of facts and values is divided into two principal questions: 1) how to compare women and men within a particular state of the world, and 2) how to choose from their positions between states. Aims: The overall aim is to propose a public health framework for judging fairness and change from the positions of women and men. The specific aims are to: illustrate how the choice of normative approach affects judgements on fairness and resource allocation (I), explor public health views regarding various ethical principles (II), study the relationship between aspects of gender equality in public/domestic and health (III), estimate costs, savings and health gains, associated with the Swedish <b>parental</b> <b>insurance</b> reform (IV). Methods: The methods used are: ethical analysis based on the normative theories of welfarism, extrawelfarism, egalitarianism, and feminism; and the notions of justice by separate spheres, equity as choice and attainment/shortfall principles (I), survey among public health workers regarding within-state and between-states ethical views (II), epidemiologic study on death and sickness leave among traditional, equal, and untraditional Swedish couples who had their first child in 1978 (III), cost-effectiveness analysis based on men who took paternity leave 1978 - 1979 (IV). Results: The selected normative theories are likely to claim different opinions on fairness regarding women and men, and different proposals on resource allocations (I). Most public health workers support the idea of judging fairness by separate spheres, end-points, and shortfall equity. The rejection of health maximisation, and support for equality in life span and income, are convincing; although females and males differ significantly in judging societal change (II). In comparison to being equal in the public sphere, traditional women have lower risks of death and sickness, while traditional men tend to have higher risks. Being equal in the domestic sphere seems to be associated with lower risks among both sexes (III). Men who took paternity leave run significant lower death risks than other men. Base case cost-effectiveness of the reform is 6, 000 EUR, and worst case 40, 000 EUR, per gained QALY (IV). Conclusions: A public health framework for judging fairness and reform by women and men could look as follows: 1) identify facts at present and from past, 2) ask whether the situation is fair by within-state rules, 3) claim or refuse change, 4) identify consequences from reform, 5) consider whether the change was satisfying by between-states rules. The gains from more ethical analyses of public health based on sex/gender should overcome the many tricky issues involved. Since there is no common understanding on how to judge fairness and change from female/male differences in health and wealth, added research and exchange of views are called for. At Swedish state of gender (in) equality, it seems public health relevant to support further similarity in child-care. Provided an effective fraction of 25 percent, the entitlement to paternity leave is probably approved of by common welfarist, egalitarian, and feminist goals...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} takes a {{step towards}} providing {{a better understanding of}} post-socialist welfare state development from a theoretical as well as an empirical perspective. The overall analytical goal of this thesis has been to critically assess the development of social policies in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania using them as illustrative examples of post-socialist welfare state development {{in the light of the}} theories, approaches and typologies that have been developed to study affluent capitalist democracies. The four studies included in this dissertation aspire to a common aim in a number of specific ways. The first study tries to place the ideal-typical welfare state models of the Baltic States within the well-known welfare state typologies. At the same time, it provides a rich overview of the main social security institutions in the three countries by comparing them with each other and with the previous structures of the Soviet period. It examines the social insurance institutions of the Baltic States (old-age pensions, unemployment insurance, short-term benefits, sickness, maternity and <b>parental</b> <b>insurance</b> and family benefits) with respect to conditions of eligibility, replacement rates, financing and contributions. The findings of this study indicate that the Latvian social security system can generally be labelled as a mix of the basic security and corporatist models. The Estonian social security system can generally also be characterised as a mix of the basic security and corporatist models, even if there are some weak elements of the targeted model in it. It appears that the institutional changes developing in the social security system of Lithuania have led to a combination of the basic security and targeted models of the welfare state. Nevertheless, as the example of the three Baltic States shows, there is diversity in how these countries solve problems within the field of social policy. In studying the social security schemes in detail, some common features were found that could be attributed to all three countries. Therefore, the critical analysis of the main social security institutions of the Baltic States in this study gave strong supporting evidence in favour of identifying the post-socialist regime type that is already gaining acceptance within comparative welfare state research. Study Two compares the system of social maintenance and insurance in the Soviet Union, which was in force in the three Baltic countries before their independence, with the currently existing social security systems. The aim of the essay is to highlight the forces that have influenced the transformation of the social policy from its former highly universal, albeit authoritarian, form, to the less universal, social insurance-based systems of present-day Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. This study demonstrates that the welfare–economy nexus is not the only important factor in the development of social programs. The results of this analysis revealed that people's attitudes towards distributive justice and the developmental level of civil society also play an important part in shaping social policies. The shift to individualism in people’s mentality and the decline of the labour movement, or, to be more precise, the decline in trade union membership and influence, does nothing to promote the development of social rights in the Baltic countries and hinders the expansion of social policies. The legacy of the past has been another important factor in shaping social programs. It can be concluded that social policy should be studied as if embedded not only in the welfare-economy nexus, but also in the societal, historical and cultural nexus of a given society. Study Three discusses the views of the state elites on family policy within a wider theoretical setting covering family policy and social policy in a broader sense and attempts to expand this analytical framework to include other post-socialist countries. The aim of this essay is to explore the various views of the state elites in the Baltics concerning family policy and, in particular, family benefits as one of the possible explanations for the observed policy differences. The qualitative analyses indicate that the Baltic States differ significantly with regard to the motives behind their family policies. Lithuanian decision-makers seek to reduce poverty among families with children and enhance the parents’ responsibility for bringing up their children. Latvian policy-makers act so as to increase the birth rate and create equal opportunities for children from all families. Estonian policy-makers seek to create equal opportunities for all children and the desire to enhance gender equality is more visible in the case of Estonia in comparison with the other two countries. It is strongly arguable that there is a link between the underlying motives and the kinds of family benefits in a given country. This study, thus, indicates how intimately the attitudes of the state bureaucrats, policy-makers, political elite and researchers shape social policy. It confirms that family policy is a product of the prevailing ideology within a country, while the potential influence of globalisation and Europeanisation is detectable too. The final essay takes into account the opinions of welfare users and examines the performances of the institutionalised family benefits by relying on the recipients’ opinions regarding these benefits. The opinions of the populations as a whole regarding government efforts to help families are compared with those of the welfare users. Various family benefits are evaluated according to the recipients' satisfaction with those benefits as well as the contemporaneous levels of subjective satisfaction with the welfare programs related to the absolute level of expenditure on each program. The findings of this paper indicate that, in Latvia, people experience a lower level of success regarding state-run family insurance institutions, as compared to those in Lithuania and Estonia. This is deemed to be because the cash benefits for families and children in Latvia are, on average, seen as marginally influencing the overall financial situation of the families concerned. In Lithuania and Estonia, the overwhelming majority think that the family benefit systems improve the financial situation of families. It appears that recipients evaluated universal family benefits as less positive than targeted benefits. Some universal benefits negatively influenced the level of general satisfaction with the family benefits system provided in the countries being researched. This study puts forward a discussion about whether universalism is always more legitimate than targeting. In transitional economies, in which resources are highly constrained, some forms of universal benefits could turn out to be very expensive in relative terms, without being seen as useful or legitimate forms of help to families. In sum, by closely examining the different aspects of social policy, this dissertation goes beyond the over-generalisation of Eastern European welfare state development and, instead, takes a more detailed look at what is really going on in these countries through the examples of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. In addition, another important contribution made by this study is that it revives ‘western’ theoretical knowledge through ‘eastern’ empirical evidence and provides the opportunity to expand the theoretical framework for post-socialist societies...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{probability}} of being uninsured peaks in early adulthood, with {{one third of}} young adults uninsured in their early 20 s. The increase in uninsurance begins in the late teenage years, driven {{by the loss of}} <b>parental</b> health <b>insurance</b> and, for men, the loss of public coverage. Rates of uninsurance decline several years later when young adults begin to obtain employer-sponsored coverage on their own. But the gap between losing childhood coverage and gaining one’s own coverage means that the median young adult will be uninsured at some point in his or her late teens or early twenties. Employment instability explains a significant fraction of the high rate of uninsurance among the young. When combined with other factors (marital status, parenthood, family income), observable characteristics can explain about half of the spike in uninsurance in young adulthood. This suggests that uninsurance in early adulthood is related to the more general lack of financial maturity that characterizes young adults, but is not entirely explained by it. Whether the residual excess insurance coverage is due to adverse selection in insurance The years between age 16 and age 34 are typically marked by a series of important milestones: finishing school, finding stable employment, leaving the parental nest, and establishing a home of one’s own. It is a time of transition to financial adulthood. ...|$|R

Utilizing secondary data, this research sought to report HPV vaccination rates among a racially diverse population and to identify potential barriers to vaccination. The ACHA-NCHA survey provided a large sample size (N= 68, 193) in which to perform a binary logistic regression analysis. Demographic characteristics were analyzed as potential barriers to HPV vaccination. Additionally, lack of certain health behaviors were explored as potential barriers to HPV vaccination. In this study, White/non-Hispanic women had a higher HPV vaccination rate when compared to minority women. The binary regression analysis demonstrated that minority women were less likely to receive the HPV vaccine. Furthermore, it was determined that as the age of the respondents increased, the likelihood of receiving the vaccine decreased. Health behaviors that were predictive of receiving the HPV vaccine included receiving the Hepatitis B and Influenza vaccine, number of sexual partners and receiving sexually transmitted disease information. Women who received a gynecological exam were almost twice as likely to receive the vaccine, as were women who had <b>parental</b> health <b>insurance</b> coverage. One aim of The Affordable Care Act (2010) is to decrease disparities in health care. Drawing attention to potential barriers to HPV vaccination allows policy makers to make informed decisions regarding future activities to reduce disparities. Health promotion activities should be targeted to specific populations in an effort to increase HPV vaccination rates...|$|R

This study assesses the association between an adult’s insurance continuity and the coverage status of their children. We used data from a subgroup of participants in the Oregon Health Care Survey, a three-wave, 30 -month prospective cohort study (n = 559). We examined the relationship between the length of time an adult had health {{insurance coverage}} and whether or not all children in the same household were insured {{at the end of the}} study. We used a series of univariate and multivariate logistic regression models to identify significant associations and the rho correlation coefficient to assess collinearity. A dose response relationship was observed between continuity of adult coverage and the odds that all children in the household were insured. Among adults with continuous coverage, 91. 4 % reported that all children were insured at the end of the study period, compared to 83. 7 % of adults insured for 19 – 27 months, 74. 3 % of adults insured for 10 – 18 months, and 70. 8 % of adults insured for fewer than 9 months. This stepwise pattern persisted in logistic regression models: adults with the fewest months of cov-erage, as compared to those continuously insured, reported the highest odds of having uninsured children (adjusted odds ratio 7. 26, 95 % confidence interval 2. 75, 19. 17). <b>Parental</b> health <b>insurance</b> continuity is integral to main-taining children’s insurance coverage.

40|$|An {{extensive}} {{literature has}} documented a robust correlation between socioeconomic status—measured {{in a variety}} of ways—and health outcomes; however, much uncertainty remains regarding what causal processes underlie this association. The present paper builds on a growing literature that seeks to better document how and why wealth and SES are related. Specifically, we ask the extent to which health shocks affect net worth—a less-studied dimension of socioeconomic status. Given a lack of instruments that meet the exclusion restriction, we use data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics to pursue a first-differences identification strategy. We estimate a parameter for acute illnesses (which should have a causal effect on wave-to-wave wealth changes) and compare this coefficient to a counterfactual parameter for the presence of chronic illnesses (which we argue should be less causally related to wealth differences year-to-year). Additionally, we interact these health indicators with insurance status as a further test that the health-wealth relationship is likely causal net of covariates. Results show that the onset of an acute illness has a negative effect on family wealth levels and that the onset of chronic illnesses only makes an impact when it occurs for those uninsured. In intergenerational models, <b>parental</b> health <b>insurance</b> status also seems to matter. When parents suffer from chronic illness and have no health insurance, adult children’s net worth declines. Adult children in white families also face a greater likelihood of falling into debt (excluding wealth from home equity) when parental medical expenses increase. Together, these findings suggest that health dynamics {{play an important role in}} intergenerational stratification processes—at least under the current health regime of the United States. ...|$|R
40|$|Using nationally {{representative}} {{data from the}} US, this study provides evidence {{on the relationship between}} early life conditions and cognition, human capital accumulation, labor market outcomes, and health status in adulthood. We find that poor health at birth and limited parental resources (including low income, lack of health insurance, and unwanted pregnancy) interfere with cognitive development and health capital in childhood, reduce educational attainment, and lead to worse labor market and health outcomes in adulthood. These effects are substantial, and they are robust to the inclusion of sibling fixed effects and an extensive set of controls. The results reveal that low birth weight ages you by 12 years, increases the odds of dropping out of high school by one-third, lowers labor force participation by 5 percentage points, and reduces labor market earnings by roughly 15 percent. Not only are socioeconomic factors determinants of poor birth outcomes, but they also influence the lasting impacts of poor infant health when it occurs. In particular, the negative long-run consequences of low birth weight are larger among children whose parents did not have health insurance. While poor birth outcomes reduce human capital accumulation, this consequence explains only 10 % of the total effect of low birth weight on labor market earnings. The study also finds that racial differences in adult health can be explained by a few early life factors: birth weight, parental income, and <b>parental</b> health <b>insurance</b> coverage. Finally, the paper sheds light on the well known strong relationship between education and health outcomes; we find that sibling models that account for time-invariant family factors reduce the effects of education on health substantially, but the remaining effects are large. Taken together, the evidence is consistent with a negative reinforcing intergenerational transmission of disadvantage within the family; parental economic status influences birth outcomes, birth outcomes have long reaching effects on health and economic status in adulthood, which in turn leads to poor birth outcomes for one’s own children...|$|R
40|$|The {{recession}} has wreaked havoc on America's workforce, {{putting pressure on}} states to make difficult budgetary choices. As the perennial concern of balancing the budget takes hold of state government, recessionary spending cuts further jeopardize the health and economic security of families. An increasing number of Americans face a large gap between their resources and their expenses, and the safety net is splintering just when workers need it the most. Nowhere is this {{more evident than in}} Mississippi, where the unemployment rate in 2009 was 10 percent, significantly higher than the national unemployment rate. More troubling, however, is the precipitous rise in statewide child poverty rates {{since the start of the}} recession. In 2009, 30 percent of Mississippi's children lived in poor families versus 28 percent in 2008. In a sluggish economic environment, where costs are rising faster than wages, Mississippians struggle to cover basic needs, such as food, shelter, health care, and child care. For those who can find work, employment alone is not enough. The Family Resource simulator shows that even with full-time employment, low-wage workers in Mississippi cannot cover the cost of basic necessities without the help of work supports, such as food stamps, EITC, public health insurance, and child care subsidies. However, for many Mississippians, these work supports do not adequately support families as they move towards economic security. One of the biggest challenges facing Mississippians is the limited public health care provisions for parents. Medicaid is restrictively low with eligibility levels at 46 percent of the Federal Poverty Level. Outside of Medicaid, Mississippi has no state health insurance program for parents. Moreover, the continual decline of employer-sponsored health insurance and the prohibitive costs of private health insurance have led many Mississippians to forego health coverage altogether. More than 500, 000 Mississippians went without health insurance in 2009. This situation has negative consequences not only for the health of parents, but for their family's economic security and well-being. This brief uses results from the Family Resource Simulator to analyze Mississippi's work support policies. It also identifies gaps in <b>parental</b> health <b>insurance</b> coverage and recommends policy reforms that could expand coverage among Mississippi's working parents...|$|R
30|$|To give {{estimates}} of the ATT a causal interpretation, one needs to assume: i) that P(X)[*]<[*] 1; ii) that program participation {{does not affect the}} earnings of other individuals and; iii) conditional on the covariates in X, that the mechanisms behind enrolment decisions are independent of potential future earnings changes under non-treatment. The crucial assumption is iii because {{it is not possible to}} rule out that there are remaining unobserved factor(s) which may correlate with both participation and future earnings. 6 The DID-PSM estimator adjusts for time invariant unobserved heterogeneity affecting earnings. Our balancing tests encompass a rich set of covariates that include age, regional employment levels, dummies for region of residence (23 categories), employment sector (seven categories), prior education level (six categories) and educational track (six categories), number of children at home (six categories), age of children (6 categories), indicators of marital status or divorce, pre-treatment annual earnings trajectories for 1990 – 1995 (1996 with our extended model, see below), and four different types of social insurance benefits in 1990 – 1995 (1996) related to unemployment <b>insurance,</b> <b>parental</b> leave, sick-leave and social welfare, applying both dummy variables (zero earnings, incidence of the various benefits) and continuous measures of amounts. We further balance on days registered as unemployed each year in 1992 – 1995 (1996) and on indicator variables if either zero days or the maximum number of days (365 / 366). In total, our balancing tests encompass at least 132 variables.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the extent to}} which antidepressant use among adolescents varies across racial and ethnic subgroups. Using a representative sample of U. S. adolescents, we find that non-Hispanic White adolescents are over twice as likely as Hispanic adolescents, and over five times as likely as non-Hispanic Black adolescents to use antidepressants. Results from a decomposition analysis indicate that racial/ethnic differences in characteristics, including household income, <b>parental</b> education, health <b>insurance,</b> and having a usual source of care explain between one half and two thirds of the gap in antidepressant use between Hispanics and non-Hispanic Whites. In contrast, none of the gap between Whites and Blacks in antidepressant use is explained by differences in observed characteristics. Further analysis suggests that there are large racial/ethnic differences in {{the extent to which}} behavioral and mental health problems prompt antidepressant use and that this may, in part, account for the large differences across race/ethnicity observed in our study. Keywords adolescents, antidepressant, race and ethnicity The number and proportion of adolescents taking prescription antidepressants in the United States increased rapidly during the 1990 s, even faster than for adults (Hunkeler et al., 2005; Olfson, Shaffer, Marcus, & Greenberg, 2003; Zito et al., 2002).

Further, differences in delivery systems may {{be reflected in}} variation between the component dimensions of satisfaction. AIM: The {{aim of this study}} was to compare perceptions of satisfaction with care provided by the School Dental Service (SDS) and private dentists. DESIGN: A three-stage cross-sectional survey was conducted during 1993 - 94. This analysis is based on Stage 2 of the study (n= 2, 792 participants, response rate= 78. 0 %). SETTING: Schools in metropolitan Adelaide, South Australia. PARTICIPANTS: Parents and schoolchildren. INTERVENTIONS/METHODS: Mailed self-complete questionnaires. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The Dental Satisfaction Index (DSI) and component subscales. RESULTS: Overall satisfaction using the DSI showed no significant difference between SDS users and users of private dental care. Parents of children using the SDS had lower satisfaction scores for 'general satisfaction', 'quality', 'access', and 'continuity', but had higher satisfaction scores for the dimensions of 'cost' and 'availability' (OLS regression; P< 0. 01). These patterns of satisfaction with dental care by provider group persisted after controlling for time since last visit, <b>parental</b> education level, <b>insurance</b> status, occupation and language spoken (OLS regression; P< 0. 05). This may reflect a counter-balancing of dimensions of satisfaction across provider groups resulting in no significant difference in the DSI.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} impact of {{educational}} enrolment on family formation in Sweden. The aim is to identify factors that are important for students’ childbearing and to find potential explanations as to why so few students have children while enrolled in education. Three independent studies are carried out, two quantitative and one qualitative. Study I examines the associations between age, earnings, a student financial aid reform, and female students’ first, second and third birth risks. Study II takes a gender perspective and compares the influence of mothers’ and fathers’ enrolment and earnings on parental couples’ propensities {{to have a second}} or a third child. In both these studies the analyses are performed using longitudinal register data. Study III explores male and female students’ childbearing intentions, and the motivations behind them, through individual in-depth interviews with childless students. Several findings point towards the significance of economic factors. The results in Study I show that earnings have a clear impact on female students’ birth risks, and in Study III economic security is found to be an important motive behind the students’ childbearing intentions. However, the student financial aid reform investigated in Study I had no noticeable impact on students’ childbearing behaviour. The negative effect of educational enrolment on childbearing risks, as well as the significance of earnings and economic security, is clearly weakened by age. In addition to economic security, the interview accounts indicate that non-material aspects, such as the biological risks of postponement, knowing one’s future prospects and being content with life, are also important for the timing of childbearing. The implications of educational enrolment for family formation are also found to be largely dependent on gender, as in Study II mothers’ educational enrolment had a much stronger negative impact on couples’ continued childbearing than fathers’ enrolment. Further, compared to the males, the female respondents in Study III had much more knowledge about the parental leave system, and parental leave and their benefit level were also things they took into account to a much larger extent when discussing their childbearing intentions. The gender differences are likely associated with the Swedish earnings-related <b>parental</b> leave <b>insurance</b> and mothers still taking the largest part of the leave. The fact that both economic security and the biological risks associated with postponement are seen as crucial factors for timing of family formation implies that some students, particularly females above age 30, find themselves in a difficult situation.

40|$|Presentation made at Latinos in the Heartland (9 th : 2011 : Columbia, Mo.) and {{published}} in the annual conference proceedings. Using data from the 2007 - 2009 Annual Social and Economic (ASEC) supplement of the Current Population Surveys (CPS), this study explores the relationship between poverty and health of children from various racial/ethnic minority and immigrant families in the Midwest. Findings show that: (1) Racial/ethnic minority children experience poorer health than non-Hispanic White children; (2) Increased poverty among children predicts poorer children's health; (3) Immigrant children have poorer health than natives; and (4) Second-generation immigrant children have poorer health than first and third-generation immigrant children. This study demonstrates the health disadvantages of Mid-western children from racial/ethnic minority families faced by poverty. The gap in children's health between non-Hispanic White and minority children persists even after accounting {{for the effects of}} immigrant status, poverty, family structure, <b>parental</b> education, health <b>insurance</b> coverage, and metropolitan/ nonmetropolitan residence. Improving the economic well-being of all racial/ethnic and immigrant families would improve children's health. Studies have shown the harmful influence of poverty on child health and development. Poverty has been linked to numerous negative outcomes for children, including physical health; educational achievement and development; emotional and behavioral problems and depression; and other consequences, such as teenage out-of-wedlock birth, child abuse and neglect, and violent crime (Aber, Bennett, Conley, & Li., 1997; Brooks-Gunn & Duncan, 1997; Duncan & Brooks-Gunn, 1997, 2000; Duncan, Brooks-Gunn, & Klebanov, 1994; Lichter, 1997; Malat, Oh, & Hamilton, 2005; McLeod & Shanahan, 1996; Petterson & Albers, 2001). Race and ethnicity also continues to be a strong determinant of variations in health status (Williams & Collins, 1995). Health outcomes usually have multiple causes that can be either direct or indirect and are often interrelated and interactive (Kaplan & Bennett, 2003; Williams, 1997). Both racial/ethnicity and social class influence health through complex pathways (Geronimus, 2000; Kaplan & Bennett, 2003; Krieger, 2000; Williams, 1997, 2002; Williams & Collins, 2001). Much of previous health studies research conducted with immigrants consistently found that acculturation is detrimental to health (Cho, Frisbie, Hummer, & Rogers, 2004; Hummer, Powers, Pullum, Gossman, & Frisbie, 2007; Landale, Oropesa, & Gorman, 2000). The basic premise of those studies is that culturally-based behaviors change over time and deteriorate as a result of acculturation (Ebin et al., 2001; Hummer et al., 1999; Landale, Oropesa, Llanes, & Gorman, 1999; Rumbaut, 1997). The main objective {{of this study is to}} determine the main, relative, and combined influences of poverty, race/ethnicity, and immigrant/generation status on children's health in the Midwest. This study addresses three main research questions: (1) What is the influence of poverty on children's health? (2) What are the influences of race/ethnicity and immigrant/generation status on children's health? (3) To what extent does poverty account for racial/ethnic and immigrant/generation status gaps in children's health...|$|R
