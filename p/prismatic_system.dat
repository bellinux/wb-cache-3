Thus the overall stress level during loading was determined primarily by the <b>prismatic</b> slip <b>systems.</b> The <b>prismatic</b> slip <b>systems</b> were hardly activated during unloading because the stress level was of course lower than that during loading. On the other hand, because the strength of the basal slip systems was much lower than that of the <b>prismatic</b> slip <b>systems,</b> the basal slip systems would be easily activated under the stress level during unloading in the opposite direction when their Schmid’s resolved shear stresses changed signs because of the inhomogeneity of the material. These results indicated that one explanation for the inelastic behavior during unloading was that the basal slip systems were primarily activated owing to their low strengths compared to that of the <b>prismatic</b> slip <b>systems.</b> Numerical tests using the sheets with random orientations and with the more pronounced texture were conducted to further examine the mechanism...|$|R

Slip on the 〈a〉 <b>prismatic</b> <b>system</b> was activated by selecting the crystal orientation of α-phase in the cantilevers. The critical resolved shear stresses (CRSSs) were determined via an inverse process of fitting a crystal plasticity finite element model to the experimental load-displacement data. Cantilevers had an equilateral triangular cross-section and cantilevers with widths w of 10, 5, 2 and 1 μm were tested. For each material the increase in CRSS τ with reducing cantilever width w is represented well by the expression τ= τ 0 +Aw, where τ 0 is the CRSS for an infinite sample and A is a constant. Such a variation of CRSS with beam size is well {{accounted for by the}} increased back stress generated by dislocations piling up at the neutral axis.

40|$|Although the VSEPR {{model has}} {{a central role}} in {{structural}} chemistry of main group compounds, it has become clear by theoretical and experimental works, that many transition metal complexes favour other structures than those predicted by this model. The geometry of high-valent transition metal complexes depends {{on the nature of the}} ligands. Electronegative, p -donating ligands favour the octahedron, whereas s -bonding ligands, like methyl groups, prefer non-octahedral structures. From this point of view it is of interest to synthesize and to examine novel homoleptic methyl compounds of molybdenum and some derivatives. This work covers the preparation and characterization of the hexacoordinated, neutral molybdenum compounds Mo(CH 3) 6, Mo(CH 3) 5 OCH 3, Mo(CH 3) 4 (OCH 3) 6 and of the tungsten compound W(CH 3) 3 Cl 3. The structures of all of these molecules were determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. They all have a distorted trigonal prismatic coordination geometry with overall C 3 v -symmetry. The idea behind these syntheses was to create a transition between the trigonal prism and octahedral geometries. Beginning with trigonal prismatic Mo(CH 3) 6 every methylgroup was exchanged by p -donorligands, to observe when the trigonal <b>prismatic</b> <b>system</b> beginns to distort towards on octahedral system. In this context Mo(OCH 3) 6 was chosen as the octahedral reference system, synthezised and structurally investigated. The heptacoordinated anion [Mo(CH 3) 7] - was also prepared and structurally determined by X-ray diffraction. The anion has a capped octahedral geometry with overall C 3 v -symmetry, which is influenced by the contact of the lithium ion to the three basal methyl groups. Mo(CH 3) 5 has also been prepared. Single crystal structure determination gives a full account of the molecular structure. Mo(CH 3) 5 has a square pyramidal C 4 v -geometry. Pentamethylmolybdenum(V) is paramagnetic and gives a very weak e. p. r. signal which is in full agreement with its structure. Molecular orbital calculations confirm that the trigonal prismatic, the capped octahedron and the square pyramid are favoured structures, which avoid 180 ° arrangements of ligands. The same predictions were obtained by the extended VSEPR model, which consideres the core electrons. The core electrons are polarized by the covalent M-CH 3 -bonds and it appears impossible for the ligands to occupy an 180 ° arrangement. This corresponds to Pauling ýs valence bond theory which predicts that in case of sd n -hybridization, angles of 180 ° do not exist. Even if the capped octahedron of [Mo(CH 3) 7] - and the square pyramid in d 1 -Mo(CH 3) 5 are the structures with the lowest mutual ligand repulsion, it can be concluded that the VSEPR model is not the definitive model for the geometry of homoleptic methyl compounds. </body...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the prediction of}} the contours of plastic work for an AZ 31 magnesium alloy sheet in the first quadrant of the stress space using a rate-dependent crystal plasticity finite-element method. The contour of plastic work was initially rather flat {{in the vicinity of}} equi-biaxial tension, but bulged severely thereafter. Evidently, the shapes of the contours changed as the plastic work increased, exhibiting a differential work-hardening behavior. The variation of the relative activity of each family of slip systems was examined to investigate the mechanism of the differential work-hardening behavior. During uniaxial tension, the work-hardening was determined mainly by the basal slip in the very beginning, whereas it was determined by both the prismatic and the basal slip in the subsequent deformation. On the other hand, during equi-biaxial tension, the relative activity of the <b>prismatic</b> slip <b>systems</b> was much smaller than that under uniaxial tension, whereas the relative activity of the basal slip systems played a dominant role in the work-hardening throughout the deformation. A simple analysis revealed that it was more difficult to activate the <b>prismatic</b> slip <b>systems</b> for equi-biaxial tension than uniaxial tension in rolled magnesium alloy sheets because the two biaxial stresses tended to cancel each other thus decreasing the relative activity as the biaxial stress ratio approached unity. On the other hand, the basal slip systems were much easily activated than the <b>prismatic</b> slip <b>systems</b> although their Schmid factors were small because the shear stress required for the activation of the basal slip systems was much lower than that of the <b>prismatic</b> slip <b>systems.</b> We concluded that such differences in the activities of the slip systems eventually resulted in the differential work-hardening behavior of the contour of plastic work...|$|R

40|$|International audienceTensile {{tests on}} commercially pure alpha-titanium show a three-stage {{behavior}} {{giving rise to}} a well on the strain dependence of the work hardening. An opposite strain rate effect on the well depth is found whether specimens are elongated along the rolling or the transverse direction. Slip lines analysis reveals an initial predominance of prismatic slip, particularly pronounced in specimens strained along the rolling direction. The relative activity of prismatic slip is then observed to decrease with the samples deformation. These results provide grounds for elaboration of an elasto-viscoplastic self-consistent model based on the translated field method and an affine linearization of the viscoplastic flow rule, and capable of explaining such peculiar work hardening behavior. The model considers crystal plasticity and deals separately with mobile dislocation density and dislocation velocity. It assumes lower strain rate sensitivity as well as higher dislocation multiplication rate for <b>prismatic</b> <b>systems.</b> Based on these assumptions, the model reproduces correctly the stress strain curves and gives sound estimates of Lankford coefficients, prismatic slip activity and textures evolution.

40|$|ALM-based {{production}} of Titanium components shows great promise in supplying cost-effective products within {{industries such as}} energy, chemical processing and aerospace. In common for all is high quality demands. This necessitates extensive research into the intricacies of this production process. Complex microstructures comprised of columnar remnants of directionally solidified &# 946;-Titanium, with interior inhabited by colonies of finer &# 945;-plate structures were found in samples produced by layered plasma welding of alloy Ti- 6 Al- 4 V. Utilising the powerful characterisation tool of in-situ tensile tests combined with EBSD analysis allowed qualitative correlation between microstructural features and deformation characteristics. Non-uniform deformation occurs due to a strong variation of strain response between colonies. Prismatic and basal slip systems are active, with the <b>prismatic</b> <b>systems</b> contributing to the most severe deformation through coarse, widely spaced slip bands. Certain colonies behave as microstructural units, with easy slip transmission across the entire colony. Other colonies show significant deformation mismatch, with local build up of strain gradients and stress concentration.

Load-displacement data from displacement hold tests, in both experiment and simulation, have enabled determination of the rate-dependent slip rule within the crystal plasticity model. Slip system SRS has been obtained, via micro-pillars orientated for single basal and prismatic slip. Crystal plasticity modelling explicitly captures micro-pillar geometry, crystal orientation, {{as well as the}} stiffnesses of components of the experimental testing frame and sample mounting. Consideration of the stiffness of the adhesive and load frame is shown to be essential for extraction of the intrinsic rate-dependent material response, rather than the structural response, even in single phase micro-pillar compression experiments. We find that the intrinsic SRS of basal slip is stronger than that for prismatic slip.

This innovative connection system is composed of a triangular prismatic connection designed to improve the anti-rotational properties of the implant, and to seal any gap between the abutment and the fixture. Methods: The mechanical performances of the dental implant system were investigated by means of static mechanical strength tests, which allowed {{the identification of the}} bending, torque and compression resistance of the system, and fatigue testing, according to the practice standard - ISO 14801.

40|$|International audienceA salient {{feature of}} the {{rheology}} of isotropic polycrystalline ices is the decrease of the strain rate by more than 2 orders of magnitude during transient creep tests to reach a secondary creep regime at a strain which is systematically of ∼ 1 %. We use a recent (so-called “affine”) version of the self-consistent mean-field theory to model the elastoviscoplastic behavior of ice. The model aims at bridging scales between the rheology of single grain and the one of polycrystals by evaluating the intergranular interactions. It {{takes into account the}} long-term memory effects, which manifests itself by the fact that local stress and strain rate in grains depend on the whole mechanical history of the polycrystal. It is shown that the strong hardening amplitude during the transient creep is entirely explained by the stress redistribution within the specimen, from an almost uniform stress distribution upon instantaneous loading (purely elastic response) to strong interphase and intraphase heterogeneities in the stationary regime (purely viscoplastic response). The experimental hardening kinetic is much too slow to be explained by the same process; it is attributed to the hardening of hard glide slip <b>systems</b> (<b>prismatic</b> slip) in the transient regime. Moreover, the model very well reproduces the permanent creep rate of several highly anisotropic specimens of the Greenland Ice Core Project ice core (pronounced crystallographic textures), when accounting for a single-grain rheology that well matches the experimental one.

40|$|Two phase alpha/beta {{titanium}} alloys {{are used in}} a wide variety of applications such as aerospace, biomedical, gas turbine engine, sport and energy. These alloys have high specific strength and specific modulus as compared to magnesium and aluminium alloys as well as excellent corrosion resistance. The Ti- 6 Al- 4 V (α+β) alloy is the most widely used and the best known of all the Ti alloys. Although there are a number of observations in the literature reporting the mechanical responses of these two phase alloys, there exists very little understanding of the mechanisms of the individual phases and the alpha/beta interface’s role in strengthening. Additionally, it has often been reported in the literature that ‘smaller is stronger’ for different metals due to the presence of a size effect. There is no real understanding of the mechanism of the size effect in the alpha-beta titanium and HCP and its dependence on orientation. Single alpha, beta and alpha-beta colony micro-pillars have been manufactured from a polycrystalline commercial Ti- 6 Al- 4 V sample using Focused Ion Beam (FIB). Alpha/beta pillar contained two alpha lamellae separated by a thin fillet of beta phase. A nano-indenter was then used to conduct uniaxial micro-compression tests on Ti alloy single crystals, using a diamond flat tip as a compression platen. By controlling the crystal orientation along the micro-pillar using Electron Back Scattering Diffraction (EBSD) different slip systems have been selectively activated. The advantage of the micro-compression method over conventional mechanical testing techniques is the ability to localize a single crystal volume which is characterisable after deformation. This study makes a contribution to knowledge in several key areas, including an understanding of the mechanical response of different crystals at micro/submicro-scale, the effect of phase interfaces on deformation, and an understanding of the strengthening mechanism in two-phase Ti alloys, the orientation size effect in HCP metals and the CRSSs for each phase in Ti- 6 Al- 4 V. Therefore, in order to evaluate the behaviour of these alloys for future applications, it is imperative that the microstructural features and characteristics be quantified and examined on a small scale. The results showed that the beta phase in between alpha lamellae caused strengthening deformation. When the surface normal is parallel to the [0001] of the single alpha crystal, the material deforms with difficulty in the [0001] direction of the single alpha phase. The mechanical responses of the alpha, beta, and alpha/beta crystals not only depended on the size of the pillars, but also on the crystallographic orientation, the initial dislocation density and the relationship between the two phases in the case of α/β crystals. Extensive electron microscopy investigation revealed that the anisotropy in basal and <b>prismatic</b> slip <b>systems</b> can be directly correlated with the transmission of dislocations across the single crystal, the beta laths, and the accumulation of residual dislocation content near the interfaces and in the single beta phase. This information is essential in order to better model mechanical deformation in these materials. In addition, dislocation analysis indicated that the deformation of individual grains conformed to the Schmid factor (SF) analysis where slip primarily occurs on those slip systems where the resolved shear stress (SF) values are highest. The results presented in this thesis bring to light several concerns for designing with {{titanium alloys}} and identify a number of phenomena of strong scientific interest. They will allow for the development of realistic models for the mechanical behaviour and provide a comprehensive analysis that can contribute to the theoretical development of the design and enhancement of the titanium allows. Moreover, the role of crystallography in plastic deformation provides a novel insight into the nature of the orientation size effect in HCP. This work points towards the need for further investigations into the higher and lower temperature deformation behaviour of Ti- 64 to fully understand the phenomena identified within this study...|$|R
40|$|In Ti- 6 Al- 4 V, fatigue cracks can {{nucleate}} internally {{instead of}} at the surface. Internal or subsurface cracks in titanium alloys are found to initiate at faceted features, which {{can be seen on}} the fracture surface after failure. These facets are fractured primary α (hcp) grains, which have broken in a very planar manner. The main purpose of this work is to study internal fracture in drawn Ti- 6 Al- 4 V wires, which has not been done before, since all published studies use forged or rolled samples. Fatigue tests with load ratio R= 0. 1 and a frequency of 60 Hz have been performed on wires with average α grain sizes of approximately 1, 2, 5 and 10 µm. In total, 50 samples were successfully tested. Four samples broke due to an internally initiated crack after testing at a maximum stress of 750 MPa: three samples with average alpha grain size 5 μm, which failed after 2. 6 x 10 ^ 7, 5. 7 x 10 ^ 7 and 9. 6 x 10 ^ 7 cycles, and one sample with average alpha grain size 10 μm, which failed after 7. 6 x 10 ^ 6 cycles. In general, an increase in grain size resulted in lower fatigue lives. In the four samples with internal crack initiation, a cluster of facets was observed at the initiation site on the fracture surface. The projected area size of the facet-containing area was not related to the fatigue life, and the estimated threshold stress intensity factor range was between 6 and 8 MPa√m. The actual surface area, taking into account the roughness, was correlated to the fatigue life. The facets were not smooth, but showed some nano-roughness with linear markings. As a result of the crystallographic texture, the facets were highly inclined, at angles mostly between 50 ° and 70 °. Nearly all facets were parallel to a prismatic lattice plane. The linear markings on these facets were parallel to the direction of the <b>prismatic</b> slip <b>system,</b> which means that facet formation most likely occurred by a prismatic slip band mechanism. One anomalous facet was observed in the sample with an average grain size of 10 µm. This facet coincided with a near-basal plane, and displayed a fan-shaped pattern instead of linear markings, which indicates that a cleavage mechanism took place. These observations suggest that both a slip-based and a cleavage-based mechanism are possible, depending on the grain size, local texture and possibly other parameters. A local comparison of Taylor factors showed that the Taylor factor of each faceted grain had a tendency towards being higher than the Taylor factors of its corresponding neighbouring grains. It is suggested that the Taylor factor may be used to distinguish between plastically hard and soft grain orientations, and therefore could be capable of explaining the stress distribution between grains, which is the root cause for facet formation. Fracture surface cross-sections revealed secondary facets, which in some cases extended through more than one grain. Short crack growth through a grain boundary occurred when two compatible slip systems were present in these grains. This compatibility could be expressed by calculating misalignment factors. Additionally, a limited number of dwell fatigue tests have been performed, with a hold time of 30 or 120 s at maximum load. Introducing a hold time at maximum load drastically reduced the amount of cycles to failure by two to three orders of magnitude compared to regular fatigue tests, and promoted surface crack initiation. This was caused by strain accumulation due to cold creep, which occurred during each maximum load hold. A recovery process took place during each minimum load hold, which caused an increased initial strain rate during each following maximum load hold.
