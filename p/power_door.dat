25|$|VAM {{originally}} intended the Rally SST to include as standard equipment only the same accessories as the 1981 Rally GT and the optional equipment {{list of the}} 1981 Rally AMX except for its own share of exclusive and not available accessories. However, the same story as the 1980 Rally GT repeated itself for the 1981 Rally SST. The need to stress differences between not just the three-version Rally line but also the new Spirit-based Lerma model forced VAM to act any way it could. Once again, the company's sales department determined that virtually all Rally SST units included all optional convenience accessories available in the Rally line from the factory. The final list of equipment for the Rally SST consisted of a tinted windshield, intermittent wipers, rear defroster, electric antenna, full light group including reading dome light, AM-FM stereo radio, quartz clock, center console with compartment and armrest with rear ashtray, lighted vanity mirror, side armrest safety reflectors, cigarette lighter, front ashtray, locking glove box, leather wrapped sports steering wheel, inside hood release, air conditioning, parcel shelf, <b>power</b> <b>door</b> locks, power windows, power trunk release, dual remote-controlled mirrors, reclining bucket seats, retractable seatbelts, and removable trunk cover.|$|E
25|$|Despite the Rally's {{outstanding}} performance {{on both the}} street and in the market, it was affected {{by a series of}} unexpected problems. Internally, VAM suffered problems with several customer's confusing the Rally SST and the three-door Lerma models and became undecided on which car to buy. Also, the Lerma's high price and relatively plain looks for a high-end luxury model (intended to become VAM's new flagship since the departure of the Matador-based Classic line) meant poor sales that ended way below VAM's expectations for the year. In terms of luxury, VAM gave priority to the Lerma and the high trim American (Concord) models over the Rally line. The Lerma for 1982 was changed from being a single version to two different versions to create a price difference. The final flagship of the company was available as the semi-equipped Lerma 610 and the fully equipped Lerma 620, both in three and five doors. Externally, a set of misguided moves from the Mexican government took their toll on the whole auto industry. First, the legal exemption of up to 500 automobile engines without emission certification was revoked, affecting directly the high performance 4.6/X engine of the Rally GT models. This was followed by a decree banning the importation of automotive luxury accessories affected the whole auto industry. The only way for the auto makers to keep on offering those accessories was to have them either produced or sourced locally, some found a replacement while others did not. In the VAM Rally's case, the list of accessories that were lost included the bullet-shaped sports remote mirrors, <b>power</b> <b>door</b> locks, power windows, electric trunk release, rear spoiler, analog tachometer, rear defroster, the Quartz digital clock, and the center console with armrest and rear ashtray.|$|E

5000|$|Some {{commuter}} rail stations, mostly newer stations {{and those in}} larger cities, do have full-length high-level platforms that allow for accessible boarding on all cars. (The standard MBTA high-level side platform is 12 feet wide and 800 feet long, capable of fully handling a 9-car train - longer than any trainset currently in service. Some stations, including Forest Hills and Route 128, have Amtrak-style 1050-foot 12-car platforms.) The MBTA builds full-length high-level platforms at most new stations, and ultimately plans to build full-length high-level platforms at most stations except those requiring clearance for freight trains. Full-length platforms allow automatic <b>power</b> <b>doors</b> to be used, which allows passengers to board at all doors and thus speeding boarding times. High-level platforms are in place at all stations on the Greenbush Line, Plymouth/Kingston Line, and the Middleborough/Lakeville Line (all three of which have <b>power</b> <b>doors</b> in use), {{as well as all}} stations on the Fairmount Line except Fairmount and Readville. Other stations with full-length high-level platforms include: ...|$|R
