25|$|<b>Psychogenic</b> <b>amnesia</b> is {{supposed}} to differ from organic amnesia {{in a number of}} ways; one being that unlike organic amnesia, <b>psychogenic</b> <b>amnesia</b> is thought to occur when no structural damage to the brain or brain lesion is evident. Psychological triggers are instead considered as preceding <b>psychogenic</b> <b>amnesia,</b> and indeed many anecdotal case studies which are cited as evidence of <b>psychogenic</b> <b>amnesia</b> hail from traumatic experiences such as World War II. As aforementioned however, aetiology of <b>psychogenic</b> <b>amnesia</b> is controversial as causation is not always clear (see above paragraph), and both elements of psychological stress and organic amnesia may be present among cases. Often, but not necessarily, a premorbid history of psychiatric illness such as depression is thought to be present in conjunction to triggers of psychological stress. Lack of psychological evidence precipitating amnesia doesn't mean there isn't any, for example trauma during childhood has even been cited as triggering amnesia later in life, but such an argument runs the risk of <b>psychogenic</b> <b>amnesia</b> becoming an umbrella term for any amnesia of which there is no apparent organic cause. Due to organic amnesia often being difficult to detect, defining between organic and <b>psychogenic</b> <b>amnesia</b> is not easy and often context of precipitating experiences are considered (for example, if there has been drug abuse) as well as the symptomology the patient presents with. <b>Psychogenic</b> <b>amnesia</b> {{is supposed}} to differ from organic amnesia qualitatively in that retrograde loss of autobiographical memory while semantic memory remains intact is said to be specific of <b>psychogenic</b> <b>amnesia.</b> Another difference that has been cited between organic and <b>psychogenic</b> <b>amnesia</b> is the temporal gradient of retrograde loss of autobiographical memory. The temporal gradient of loss in most cases of organic amnesia is said to be steepest at its most recent premorbid period, whereas for <b>psychogenic</b> <b>amnesia</b> the temporal gradient of retrograde autobiographical memory loss is said to be quite consistently flat. Although there is much literature on <b>psychogenic</b> <b>amnesia</b> as dissimilar to organic amnesia, the distinction between neurological and psychological features is often difficult to discern and remains controversial.|$|E
25|$|The {{atypical}} clinical syndrome of {{the memory}} disorder (as opposed to organic amnesia) is that a person with <b>psychogenic</b> <b>amnesia</b> is profoundly unable to remember personal information about themselves; {{there is a lack}} of conscious self-knowledge which affects even simple self-knowledge, such as who they are. <b>Psychogenic</b> <b>amnesia</b> is distinguished from organic amnesia in that it is supposed to result from a nonorganic cause; no structural brain damage or brain lesion should be evident but some form of psychological stress should precipitate the amnesia, however <b>psychogenic</b> <b>amnesia</b> as a memory disorder is controversial.|$|E
40|$|A case of pure {{retrograde}} amnesia following mild head injury is reported. Neuropsychological, psychodynamic and statistical approaches {{are employed in}} an attempt to disentangle the clinical picture presented by the patient. Focal retrograde <b>amnesia,</b> <b>psychogenic</b> retrograde <b>amnesia</b> and simulated amnesia are all taken into account. From a public events questionnaire and an inquiry about famous people, consistency analyses showed that the patient was able implicitly to use information she denied having, but at the same time, made us lower the probability of a simulated amnesia. Moreover, psychodynamic analysis showed that the patient's personality structure was compatible with hysterical patterns and we suggest that the patient's memory defect may be related to her personality. It seems less likely, though still possible, that the case may be explained in terms of deliberate simulation. In this case we conclude that the classification along the conscious/unconscious dimension seems more informative than the contrast between psychogenic and organic genesis...|$|R
50|$|These {{terms are}} used to {{describe}} a pure form of RA, with an absence of anterograde amnesia (AA). In addition, Focal RA in particular, has also been used to describe a RA situation {{in which there is}} a lack of observable physical deficit as well. This could be described as a <b>psychogenic</b> form of <b>amnesia</b> with mild anterograde and retrograde loss. A case study of DH revealed that the patient was unable to provide personal or public information, however there was no parahippocampal or entorhinal damage found. Individuals with focal brain damage have minimal RA.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper has}} been {{inspired}} by the processes of preparing for ethical scrutiny and seeking ethical approval {{for a series of}} studies examining causal mechanisms that might facilitate sexual revictimisation. The focus here is on just four of the issues that arose {{in the context of the}} first study: a web-based survey. One of the aims of the survey is to test whether victims of child sexual abuse who experienced a period of <b>psychogenic</b> or dissociative <b>amnesia</b> demonstrate an exaggerated risk for adolescent/adult sexual assault during this amnesic phase. That is, cases where survivors report ‘suddenly remembering’ in adulthood that they were abused as children, but state that prior to this ‘remembering’ they had no prior knowledge of their abuse. The study design is considered to be the first ethical issue. To enhance the methodological robustness a strategy has been employed to reduce the erroneous inclusion of currently amnesic participants in the non-abused comparison group. Secondly, consideration is given to the likely harms and benefits that might be incurred or bestowed upon the participants. Thirdly, problems of both re-traumatisation and vicarious traumatisation in relation to the researcher are contemplated and juxtaposed against the possibility of the facilitation of post-traumatic growth and a personal shift towards wisdom and generativity. Finally, the survey title was originally criticised as negating ‘fully’ informed consent and a defence is therefore offered that ultimately gained ethical approval. It is hoped that these deliberations and insights may prove useful to others in planning their own research and ethics proposals...|$|R
25|$|<b>Psychogenic</b> <b>amnesia</b> {{is defined}} by the {{presence}} of retrograde amnesia (the inability to retrieve stored memories leading up to the onset of amnesia), and an absence of anterograde amnesia (the inability to form new long term memories). Access to episodic memory can be impeded, while the degree of impairment to short term memory, semantic memory and procedural memory is thought to vary among cases. If other memory processes are affected, they are usually much less severely affected than retrograde autobiographical memory, which is taken as the hallmark of <b>psychogenic</b> <b>amnesia.</b> However the wide variability of memory impairment among cases of <b>psychogenic</b> <b>amnesia</b> raises questions as to its true neuropsychological criteria, as despite intense study {{of a wide range of}} cases there is little consensus of which memory deficits are specific to <b>psychogenic</b> <b>amnesia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Past {{literature}} has suggested <b>psychogenic</b> <b>amnesia</b> can be 'situation-specific' or 'global-transient', the former referring to memory loss {{for a particular}} incident, and the latter relating to large retrograde amnesic gaps of up to many years in personal identity. The most commonly cited examples of global-transient <b>psychogenic</b> <b>amnesia</b> are 'fugue states', of {{which there is a}} sudden retrograde loss of autobiographical memory resulting in impairment of personal identity and usually accompanied by a period of wandering. Suspected cases of <b>psychogenic</b> <b>amnesia</b> have been heavily reported throughout the literature since 1935 where it was reported by Abeles and Schilder. There are many clinical anecdotes of psychogenic or dissociative amnesia attributed to stressor ranging from cases of child sexual abuse to soldiers returning from combat.|$|E
25|$|Variations in consciousness, {{including}} forgetting {{traumatic events}} (i.e., <b>psychogenic</b> <b>amnesia),</b> reliving experiences (either {{in the form}} of intrusive PTSD symptoms or in ruminative preoccupation), or having episodes of dissociation.|$|E
25|$|Because <b>psychogenic</b> <b>amnesia</b> {{is defined}} by its lack of {{physical}} damage to the brain, treatment by physical methods is difficult. Nonetheless, distinguishing between organic and dissociative memory loss {{has been described as}} an essential first-step in effective treatments. Treatments in the past have attempted to alleve <b>psychogenic</b> <b>amnesia</b> by treating the mind itself, as guided by theories which range from notions such as 'betrayal theory' to account for memory loss attributed to protracted abuse by caregivers to the amnesia as a form of self-punishment in a Freudian sense, with the obliteration of personal identity as an alternative to suicide.|$|E
25|$|<b>Psychogenic</b> <b>amnesia</b> is {{a common}} fictional plot device in many films and books and other media. Examples include Shakespeare's King Lear, who {{experienced}} amnesia and madness following a betrayal by his daughters; and the title character Nina in Nicolas Dalayrac's 1786 opera.|$|E
25|$|Treatment {{attempts}} {{often have}} revolved {{around trying to}} discover what traumatic event had caused the amnesia, and drugs such as intravenously administered barbiturates (often thought of as 'truth serum') were popular as treatment for <b>psychogenic</b> <b>amnesia</b> during World War II; benzodiazepines may have been substituted later. 'Truth serum' drugs were thought to work by making a painful memory more tolerable when expressed through relieving the strength of an emotion attached to a memory. Under the influence of these 'truth' drugs the patient would more readily talk about what had occurred to them. However, information elicited from patients {{under the influence of}} drugs such as barbiturates would be a mixture of truth and fantasy, and was thus not regarded as scientific in gathering accurate evidence for past events. Often treatment was aimed at treating the patient as a whole, and probably varied in practice in different places. Hypnosis was also popular as a means for gaining information from people about their past experiences, but like 'truth' drugs really only served to lower the threshold of suggestibility so that the patient would speak easily but not necessarily truthfully. If no motive for the amnesia was immediately apparent, deeper motives were usually sought by questioning the patient more intensely, often in conjunction with hypnosis and 'truth' drugs. In many cases, however, patients were found to spontaneously recover from their amnesia on their own accord so no treatment was required.|$|E
500|$|Early in life, Cook {{was abused}} by his father, {{who had a}} severe {{drinking}} problem. While intoxicated, Cook's father reportedly became violent towards his family.

50|$|<b>Psychogenic</b> <b>amnesia</b> is {{not part}} of Freud’s {{theoretical}} framework.
