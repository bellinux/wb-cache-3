These parts were all roughly [...] filed and [...] milled. The steel and brass were manufactured in a special workshop. The ébauche was finished by watchmakers in a finishing shop. The [...] (literally [...] "assortment" [...] in English) are the parts of a watch other than the ébauche, in particular the regulating organs and include the balance, hairspring or spiral, escape wheel, anchor lever and pallet stones or jewels. The modern ébauche is a jeweled watch movement, without its regulating organs, mainspring, dial, or hands.|$|R

We show that by tuning the inner radius of the hollow pillar, these modes can merge inside both Bragg and low frequency band gaps, deserving phononic crystal and acoustic metamaterial applications. These modes {{can be used as}} narrow pass bands for which the quality factor can be greatly enhanced by the introduction of an additional cylinder between the hollow cylinder and the plate.

40|$|We {{investigate}} theoretically {{the properties}} of phononic crystal <b>plates</b> with hollow <b>pillars.</b> Such crystals can exhibit confined whispering gallery modes around the hollow parts of the pillars whose localization can be increased by separating the <b>pillar</b> from the <b>plate</b> by a full cylinder. We discuss the behaviors of these modes and their potential applications in guiding and filtering. Filling the hollow parts with a fluid gives rise to new localized modes, which depend on the physical properties and height of the fluid. Thus, these modes can be actively controlled {{for the purpose of}} multichannel multiplexing. In particular, one can obtain localized modes associated with the compressional vibrations of the fluid along its height. They can be used for the purpose of sensing the acoustic properties of the fluid or their variations with temperature...|$|R

We have analyzed the focusing in the near field {{as the result of}} the coupling between the flexural resonant mode of the pillars and the vibration mode of the air/silicon phononic crystal. We highlight the role played by the polarization coherence between the resonant mode and the vibration of the plate. We demonstrate both numerically and experimentally the focusing behind the lens over a spot less than half a wavelength, paving a way for performance of acoustic lenses beyond the diffraction limit. Our findings can be easily extended to other types of elastic wave...|$|R
40|$|When a fluid-immersed {{array of}} {{lamellae}} or filaments that {{is attached to}} a substrate is dried, evaporation leads to the formation of menisci on the tips of the <b>plates</b> or <b>pillars</b> that bring them together. Similarly, when hair dries it clumps together due to capillary forces induced by the liquid menisci between the flexible hairs. Building on prior experimental observations, we use a combination of theory and computation {{to understand the nature of}} this instability and its evolution in both the two-dimensional and three-dimensional setting of the problem. For the case of lamellae, we explicitly derive the interaction torques based on the relevant physical parameters. A Bloch-wave analysis for our periodic mechanical system captures the critical volume of the liquid and the 2 -plate-collapse eigenmode at the onset of instability. We study the evolution of clusters and their arrest using numerical simulations to explain the hierarchical cluster formation and characterize the sensitive dependence of the final structures on the initial perturbations. We then generalize our analysis to treat the problem of pillar collapse in 3 D, where the fluid domain is completely connected and the interface is a surface with the uniform mean curvature. Our theory and simulations capture the salient features of both previous experimental observations and our own in terms of the key parameters that can be used to control the kinetics of the process...|$|R
50|$|In only a {{few decades}} the lantern clock became very popular in London, and from there its {{popularity}} spread to the entire country. This {{is evident from the}} large number of lantern clocks that still exist. Dozens of clockmakers produced great numbers of these clocks in the city of London during the 17th century. This huge productivity {{was the result of the}} high demand for this popular clock in combination with an effective guild system. In 1631 King Charles I granted a charter for a clockmaker guild in London: the Worshipful Company of Clockmakers, which exists to this day. Many of the well-known clockmakers from that era were freemen of this guild. Many small companies were established in Lothbury in London that functioned as suppliers for the clockmakers. A clockmaker could benefit from the services of brass founders who supplied cast brass clock parts, dial <b>plates,</b> finials, <b>pillars,</b> frets etc., or employ engravers who would carry out the engraving of the dial plates and frets. The guild assured the quality of the products that left the clockmakers' workshops. Before a clockmaker could become a freeman, able to set up his own shop, he had to spend 7 years as an apprentice learning the trade. This ensured independent clockmakers a plentiful supply of apprentices, who were also cheap labourers who helped to attain this high productivity.|$|R

We compared these systems with the method of our preference, using the small AO compression plate and monitoring each screw insertion fluoroscopically. The screws were directed toward the projection of the pedicles, and their length was measured individually. Radiographic analysis of the specimens and cryoplaning after implant removal and casting of the screw-plate cavities showed significant differences of the four systems with respect to effective screw length, possible and desirable screw trajectories, and risk for injuries of the facet joints, foraminal neurovascular elements, and vertebral artery, as well as mechanical conflict of the plate with adjacent facet joints...|$|R
40|$|Two {{dimensional}} phononic metamaterials, {{consisting of}} plates with resonant cylinders {{have been shown}} to attenuate waves much larger than their characteristic unit cell size by opening subwavelength band gaps. However the bandwidth of the gap correlates strongly with the resonator mass, which limits metamaterials functionality in mass sensitive applications. Trampoline phenomena have theoretically been shown to broaden the width of the first partial band gap by up to a factor 4 of the linear, resonant band gap. In this work, we provide an experimental demonstration of the trampoline phenomena in 3 D-printed <b>plates,</b> consisting of <b>pillars</b> and holes, composed of a single material. We observe the opening of significant locally resonant band gaps, ≈ 30 % normalized width, without adding any significant mass to the homogeneous plate. We show numerically and experimentally that trampoline plates increase both partial and full band gaps width, while reducing the base-plate’s mass by ≈ 30 % in the studied configurations...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- Catamaran is a dual hull ship {{which has}} many {{advantages}} then the mono hull ship. Some {{of the advantages}} are excellent stability, Cruise in shallow water, large wide deck areas, large load carrying capacity, faster and Motion comfort etc. In this paper work, design of main or strength deck and Bulkhead structural member calculations for Catamaran ship used for transport for the crane (Mantis ® 10010 mx 46 ton tele-boom crawler crane) to its place of work. Ship’s main deck or Strength deck hull structural scantlings or calculations play a very vital role in carrying the deck loads such as crane load safely against the external pressures which are acting on the deck. This can done by designing the suitable deck and hull plate thickness, and it’s strengthening stiffening. The design of main deck involves determination of scantlings of deck plate, deck <b>plate</b> stiffeners, girders, <b>pillars,</b> Bulkhead and its stiffeners against the wheel load. Scantlings of deck and Bulkhead plates, stiffeners and girders to meet the local strength requirements are to be determined {{in accordance with the}} general principles of the rules. Scantlings of hull members should contribute the longitudinal strength of the ship and to be subjected to compressive stresses. The design calculations are carried out according to Indian Register of shipping (IRS) Rules and Regulations, Construction & Classification of steel ships July 2013. This design process gives the effective & efficient solutions to the new generation ships...|$|R
