40|$|Publisher: ACS, ISSN 1520 - 6106 International audienceUnder UV irradiation, poly(vinyl cinnamate) (PVCi) films undergo {{cross-linking}} due to [2 + 2] photocycloaddition between cinnamoyl groups. Consequently, electronic {{configuration of}} lateral polymer groups changes and also {{leads to the}} drop of the refractive index in the visible range. This mechanism is studied {{with regards to the}} level of the electronic absorption of cinnamate centered at 278 nm. It acts on refractive index by shifting the absorption UV band. Most of the time, this influence vanishes in the near infrared region (NIR). It is due to antagonist phenomena acting at the expense of the index lowering. The causes analysis leads us to optimize the irradiation spectrum, providing higher index contrasts between irradiated and nonirradiated area. We show that strong index changes can be achieved in PVCi film, up to 2. 5 Ã— 10 - 2 even in the NIR, enabling us, for example, to perform optical <b>photoprinting</b> waveguides for telecommunication wavelengths (1300 - 1550 nm) ...|$|E
40|$|Photochromic {{molecules}} {{are widely}} applied in chemistry, physics, biology, and materials science. Although a few photochromic {{systems have been}} developed before, their applications are still limited by complicated synthesis, low fatigue resistance, or incomplete light conversion. Rhodamine is a class of dyes with excellent optical properties including long-wavelength absorption, large absorption coefficient, and high photostability in its ring-open form. It is an ideal chromophore {{for the development of}} new photochromic systems. However, known photochromic rhodamine derivatives, such as amides, exhibit only millisecond lifetimes in their colored ring-open forms, making their application very limited and difficult. In this work, rhodamine B salicylaldehyde hydrazone metal complex was found to undergo intramolecular ring-open reactions upon UV irradiation, which led to a distinct color and fluorescence change both in solution and in solid matrix. The complex showed good fatigue resistance for the reversible photochromism and long lifetime for the ring-open state. Interestingly, the thermal bleaching rate was tunable by using different metal ions, temperatures, solvents, and chemical substitutions. It was proposed that UV light promoted isomerization of the rhodamine B derivative from enol-form to keto-form, which induced ring-opening of the rhodamine spirolactam in the complex to generate color. The photochromic system was successfully applied for <b>photoprinting</b> and UV strength measurement in the solid state. As compared to other reported photochromic molecules, the system in this study has its advantages of facile synthesis and tunable thermal bleaching rate, and also provides new insights into the development of photochromic materials based on metal complex and spirolactam-containing dyes...|$|E
