[...] Although PayPal is not {{classified as a}} bank, the company is subject {{to some of the}} rules and regulations governing the financial industry including Regulation E consumer protections and the USA PATRIOT Act. The most analogous regulatory source of law for PayPal transactions comes from P2P payments using credit and debit cards. Ordinarily, a credit card transaction, specifically the relationship between the issuing bank and the cardholder, is governed by the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) 15 U.S.C. §§ 1601-1667f as implemented by Regulation Z, 12 C.F.R. 226, (TILA/Z). TILA/Z requires specific procedures for billing errors, dispute resolution and limits cardholder liability for unauthorized charges. Similarly, the legal relationship between a debit cardholder and the issuing bank is regulated by the Electronic Funds Transfer Act (EFTA) 15 U.S.C. §§ 1693-1693r, as implemented by Regulation E, 12 C.F.R. 205, (EFTA/E). EFTA/E is directed at consumer protection and provides strict error resolution procedures. However, because PayPal is a <b>payment</b> <b>intermediary</b> and not otherwise regulated directly, TILA/Z and EFTA/E do not operate exactly as written once the credit/debit card transaction occurs via PayPal. Basically, unless a PayPal transaction is funded with a credit card, the consumer has no recourse in the event of fraud by the seller.|$|E
40|$|Consumers {{will not}} engage in impersonal {{exchange}} unless they either trust the merchant {{they are dealing with}} and believe that everything will go alright or they can comfortably rely on a third party to effectively afford them redress if things go wrong. Trust and reliance, which are to a large extent grounded on expected compliance and effective enforcement, are two distinct components of consumer confidence. This paper discusses why traditional bases for trust and reliance are no longer effective in the electronic marketplace. It argues that new institutions will emerge to enhance trust and reliance, namely information <b>intermediaries</b> and <b>payment</b> <b>intermediaries,</b> respectively. Of these two options, reliance mechanisms that can guarantee cheap and effective enforcement of consumer rights ultimately appear to be the more efficient approach to overcome the existing lack of consumer confidence. The paper shows that some of these reliance mechanisms have developed in the market and it points out the crucial role of <b>payment</b> <b>intermediaries</b> in every online transaction. From a policy perspective it suggests to leverage this role and to consider addressing <b>payment</b> <b>intermediaries</b> by introducing comprehensive chargeback regimes that could guarantee effective consumer redress if something goes wrong in the transaction between a merchant and a consumer. In their "Framework for Global Electronic Commerce" Bill Clinton and Albert Gore have emphasized that "consumers must have confidence [...] . that they will get what they pay for, and that recourse or redress will be available if they do not. " iii Chargeback mechanisms appear to be a tool that can guarantee the latter.

40|$|The Internet has {{transformed}} the economics of communication, creating a spirited debate about {{the proper role of}} federal, state, and international governments in regulating conduct related to the Internet. Many argue that Internet communications should be entirely self-regulated because such communications cannot or should not be the subject of government regulation. The advocates of that approach would prefer a no-regulation zone around Internet communications, based largely on the unexamined view that Internet activity is fundamentally different in a way that justifies broad regulatory exemption. At the same time, some kinds of activity that the Internet facilitates undisputedly violate widely shared norms and legal rules. State legislatures motivated by that concern have begun to respond with Internet-specific laws directed at particular contexts, giving little or no credence to the claims that the Internet needs special treatment. This Article starts from the realist assumption that government regulation of the Internet is inevitable. Thus, instead of focusing on the naive question of whether the Internet should be regulated, this Article discusses how to regulate Internet-related activity {{in a way that is}} consistent with approaches to analogous offline conduct. The Article also assumes that the Internet 2 ̆ 7 s most salient characteristic is that it inserts intermediaries into relationships that could be, and previously would have been, conducted directly in an offline environment. Existing liability schemes generally join traditional fault-based liability rules with broad Internet-specific liability exemptions. Those exemptions are supported by the premise that in many cases the conduct of the intermediaries is so wholly passive as to make liability inappropriate. Over time, this has produced a great volume of litigation, mostly in the context of the piracy of copyrighted works, in which the responsibility of the intermediary generally turns on fault, as measured by the intermediary 2 ̆ 7 s level of involvement in the challenged conduct. This Article argues that the pervasive role of intermediaries calls not for a broad scheme of exoneration, premised on passivity, but rather for a more thoughtful development of principles for determining when and how it makes economic sense to allocate responsibility for wrongful conduct to the least cost avoider. The Internet 2 ̆ 7 s rise has brought about three changes that make intermediaries more likely to be least cost avoiders in the Internet context than they previously have been in offline contexts: (1) an increase in the likelihood that it will be easy to identify specific intermediaries for large classes of transactions, (2) a reduction in information costs, which makes it easier for the intermediaries to monitor the conduct of end users, and (3) increased anonymity, which makes remedies against end users generally less effective. Accordingly, in cases where intermediaries can feasibly control the conduct, this Article recommends serious attention to the possibility of one of three different schemes of intermediary liability: traditional liability for damages, takedown schemes in which the intermediary must remove offensive content upon proper notice, and 2 ̆ 7 hot list 2 ̆ 2 schemes in which the intermediary must avoid facilitation of transactions with certain parties. Part III of this Article uses that framework to analyze the propriety of intermediary liability for several kinds of Internet-related misconduct. This Article is agnostic about the propriety of any particular regulatory scheme, recognizing the technological and contextual contingency of any specific proposal. Because any such scheme will impose costs on innocent end users, selecting a particular level of regulation should depend on policymakers 2 ̆ 7 view of the net social benefits of eradicating the misconduct, taking into account the intermediaries 2 ̆ 7 and innocent users 2 ̆ 7 compliance costs associated with the regulation. Still, the analysis of this Article suggests three points. First, the practicality of peer-to-peer distribution networks for the activity in question is an important consideration because those networks undermine the regulatory scheme 2 ̆ 7 s effectiveness, thereby making regulation less useful. Second, the highly concentrated market structure of Internet <b>payment</b> <b>intermediaries</b> makes reliance on <b>payment</b> <b>intermediaries</b> particularly effective as a regulatory strategy because of the difficulty illicit actors have in relocating to new payment vehicles. Third, with respect to security harms, such as viruses, spam, phishing, and hacking, this Article concludes that the addition of intermediary liability in those cases is less likely to be beneficial because market incentives appear to be causing intermediaries to undertake substantial efforts to solve these problems without the threat of liability...|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{faces the}} theme of the {{monetary}} intermediation of the bankers in the Roman Law era. In particular, the work focuses on the receptum argentarii, the promise of payment issued by a Roman banker on account of his client and in favour of a third person. In spite of the severe scarcity of historiographical sources, Lenel’s palingenetic studies have determined a breakthrough {{in the study of the}} receptum argentarii, thus permitting some hypothesis on its concrete function in the Roman legal and economic practice. The thesis investigates the main sources and scholarly opinions about the receptum in the attempt of providing a comprehensive overview and achieving a deeper understanding ot the theme. Being the receptum always linked to a ratio (the Roman “bank account”) and owing to the extremely strict liability of the banker towards the creditors, the banker’s promise was a significantly ductile legal institute. The research shows that the promise of payment issued by a banker should be considered not only as a form of suretyship, but also as a means of fulfilment through a third party, with the argentarius acting simultaneously as a guarantor and as a <b>payment</b> <b>intermediary</b> of his customer. In conclusion, although direct archaeological and historiographical evidence is still missing, the thesis argues the receptum argentarii was probably used as a payment instrument at least in the classic and post-classic period of the Roman law era...|$|E

30|$|Behavioral {{economics}} suggests {{new directions}} for experiments with alternative incentive schemes in unemployment insurance and related programs that recognize the role of self-control in returning to work. One direction that appears promising would be to offer small, immediate, and high frequency reminders and incentives to search. So instead of tying rewards and penalties to large, distant, low frequency objectives, such as regaining employment for a significant duration of time, unemployment insurance might tie rewards and penalties to smaller, higher frequency objectives, such as making a specific number of active employer contacts in a week. Other candidates for testing are incentives that trigger avoidance of anticipated regret, and rewards with lottery-like characteristics, which have been effective {{in the presence of}} self-control problems in other contexts (Volpp et al. [2008]). Another direction for experimentation entirely would be to test the possibility of overcoming imperfect self-control by creating a principal-agent relationship in which placement agents receive the bonuses. Key issues that will need to be addressed in the design of such policies using employment intermediaries are limiting cream skimming incentives (which arise if the intermediaries can “choose” their clients) and making sure that <b>payments</b> to <b>intermediaries</b> are tied to longer-term employment and earnings outcomes rather than only to short-term reemployment rates and use of services (Autor and Houseman [2010]; Heinrich and Choi [2007]).|$|R

40|$|Policymakers {{typically}} {{assume that}} trade liberalization and foreign aid ultimately reduce international migration - that is, that trade and aid are substitutes for migration. In the Heckscher-Ohlin framework, too, trade liberalization (by reducing international price differentials between factors) {{leads to a}} decline in international migration. The author's model shows that trade liberalization in either the sending or the receiving country is likely to increase migration in the long run. In the short run, the effect is ambiguous. The author maintains the Heckscher-Ohlin framework but adds two features found in developing economies of the south and east that affect migration: migration costs and imperfect capital markets. He assumes that migration costs may be a constraint on migration, especially when combined with imperfect capital markets. Poor migrants without collateral may have trouble getting loans at reasonable rates, especially if they plan to emigrate. And for most migrants, the cost of migration is not negligible. They must pay for transportation and for living expenses until they find a job in the new country, and illegal immigrants must make <b>payments</b> to <b>intermediaries</b> for services and information (to reduce the chance of being caught). Trade liberalization in a labor-abundant economy, foreign aid, and remittances will increase income from labor and improve workers'ability to cover the costs of migration. As a result, migration will increase. (Following trade liberalization, female migrants have increasingly been employed in the textile, garment, light electronics, and agricultural processing industries in Asia, Latin America, and North Africa, for example, and their higher income has helped finance the migration of men.) What about the combined effect of trade liberalization and foreign aid, a frequent combination associated with bilateral and multilateral aid? The lower the labor income and the higher the costs of migration, the more likely trade liberalization, foreign aid, and remittances are to complement each other and lead to increased migration. (This is particularly applicable for south-north and east-west migration, as incomes in the sending countries are often low relative to migration costs.) If trade liberalization in either country is too weak to positively affect migration, adding either foreign aid or remittances is likely to increase migration. If trade liberalization is significant enough to increase migration, adding foreign aid is likely to dampen that effect, and remittances will have no effect. Migration is also affected by geography, by migration laws (in either sending or receiving countries), and by transport technology. Future workwill deal with the welfare consequences of migration, including losses in social capital.

What kind of privacy enhancing technologies (PET) can be used to ensure privacy without degrading service quality? The study is divided into two parts: in the former part, an extensive analysis of online privacy threats with a focus on Web based systems will be performed. Thiswill be followed by the real-world design and implementation of a privacy-preserving Web based application that supports service personalization and customization without privacy compromises.

Risks both on the international front and domestically appear well within {{the capacity of the}} banks to manage them. The pensions sector, though still sensitive to significant equity price reversals, is in a rebuilding stage, underpinned by firm supervisory action.

5000|$|The {{first of}} the backers Orson managed to find in Paris was a Spanish {{acquaintance}} of his from the international film community who enthusiastically agreed to kick in $350,000, {{a little less than}} half of what Orson and Oja had already invested. Shortly thereafter an equivalent sum was pledged by a French-based Iranian group headed by Mehdi Bushehri, the brother-in-law of the Shah … Dominique Antoine, a Frenchwoman, made the deal with Orson on behalf of the Iranians … Orson left France with the understanding that the Spanish partner would act as intermediary with the Iranians in Paris …But no sooner were Orson and Oja in Spain than trouble started. [...] "We were perfectly all right as long as I was using Oja's money and mine," [...] says Orson, [...] "but the moment we got associates!" [...] The Iranians appeared not to be living up to their end of the deal. Orson heard from the Spaniard who had flown in from Paris, that the Iranians had not given him the money they had promised. There were heavy rains and flooding in Spain, so Orson and Oja were basically cooped up in their hotel, where they worked on a new script together. The Spaniard returned to Paris to try again. [...] "In a minute they're going to have it," [...] he told Orson later. [...] "It looks all right." [...] In lieu of the Iranian funds, he gave them very small sums of money, which he said were part of the investment he had agreed to make. Not until afterward did Orson discover that the Iranians had indeed been giving the Spaniard the promised money, which had come from Iran in cash, and that, instead of bringing it to Spain, the sly fellow was pocketing it. Says Orson: [...] "We just sat, month after month, while he went to Paris, received the money, and came back and told us that they wouldn't give him any money. He was very convincing to us, and very convincing with them in Paris. He kept flying back and forth extracting money from them. We didn't know them, you see. We knew him." [...] The small sums of money he had been giving Orson as if from his own pocket actually came out of the Iranian funds. His constant reassurance to Orson that the Iranians were about to come through was calculated to keep Orson in Spain out of contact with them. On his part, Orson did not want to interfere in what he presumed were his emissary's delicate negotiations with them. It simply never occurred to him that the fellow was lying—and had never any money of his own to invest in the first place...Meanwhile, on account of the foul weather, Orson had decided to abandon Spain for Arizona, where John Huston {{and a host of other}} faithfuls joined him. … The swindler continued his game of collecting cash from the Iranians who, having heard only from him, still did not know that anything was wrong. When they received a telex purportedly from John Huston's agent to ask for a $60,000 advance, Dominique Antoine did ask for further verification. But this did not deter the swindler, who sent her a Screen Actor's Guild form with a bogus Social Security number and signature from the States. The Iranians dispatched the $60,000, which was pocketed by the Spaniard rather than Huston, who, out of friendship for Orson, was actually working for much less. After having sent the money, Dominique Antoine had second thoughts about it. Until now she had deliberately left Orson alone because she sensed he preferred it that way. But now something told her there was a problem. [...] "I think I have to go there," [...] she told Bushehri, [...] "even if Orson isn't pleased." [...] Since Orson had yet to receive a penny from the Iranians, their French representative was the last person he expected to see in the Arizona desert. He could not have been happy to see her. When almost instantly he asked her where the money was, she nervously told him that she had been making regular <b>payments</b> to the <b>intermediary,</b> who obviously hadn't passed them on to him, he broke down.|$|R
