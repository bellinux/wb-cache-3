30|$|The {{input from}} Anoto pen is {{transmitted}} to the PC via Bluetooth as a packet of data. The data gets pattern analysis using handwritten-character-recognition SDK which Microsoft has published, and a dataset including written characters, note number, and input area is created. In addition, the control PC and clip-shaped devises are connected via Arduino board, and serial communications can be performed at anytime. The dataset {{is linked to the}} ID number of the clip device. Thus, the pieces of information such as written contents and ID number of the clip device are unified. If the dataset’s actuating condition is satisfied, the control <b>PC</b> <b>switches</b> <b>on</b> the actuator placed on the tip of the clip device.|$|R
50|$|The PC Energy report {{revealed}} {{that nearly half}} of all corporate PCs in the US are not regularly switched off at night. This adds up to approximately 108 million work <b>PCs</b> being left <b>switched</b> <b>on</b> overnight costing US businesses in the region of $2.8 billion in energy costs. In terms of carbon emissions this equates to approximately 20 million tons, roughly the equivalent impact of 4 million cars.|$|R
40|$|Observations of teleseismic {{events at}} remote sites necessitated the develop-ment of a {{portable}} digital recorder that {{is capable of}} continuously recording the output of a three-component set of long-period transducers. A PC is used as a file management facility, operating in an intermittant or "sleeper mode. " Each of the three components are digitized and stored in separate, intelligent A to D cards. When 28 K samples have been generated, a trigger is initiated, and on the transition of the next real time second the real time is latched and power is applied to the PC. The sample count between the trigger and the latched acknowledgment of the trigger provides an absolute time correlation. After the PC has powered up, the data are down-loaded from the three acquisition cards to a PC hard disk and the latched real time forms the header label of the data file. Power is then removed from the PC. Sampling at about 15 samples per second, the <b>PC</b> is <b>switched</b> <b>on</b> every 33, 45 minutes. Boot-up and data down-loading uses approximately 5 watts average power. The associated long-period transducers (Guralp CMG 3) consume about 3 watts and the remain-ing electronics 2 watts. All the electronics are housed in a steel cabinet, and the system uses four solar panels charging two 1 OSAH batteries. Data transfer to an internal 60 MByte tape streamer neccessitates a visit to the station every 24 days...|$|R

50|$|In {{contrast}} to bipolar transistors, MOSFETs {{do not require}} constant power input, {{as long as they}} are not being <b>switched</b> <b>on</b> or off. The isolated gate-electrode of the MOSFET forms a capacitor (gate capacitor), which must be charged or discharged each time the MOSFET is <b>switched</b> <b>on</b> or off. As a transistor requires a particular gate voltage in order to <b>switch</b> <b>on,</b> the gate capacitor must be charged to at least the required gate voltage for the transistor to be <b>switched</b> <b>on.</b> Similarly, to <b>switch</b> the transistor off, this charge must be dissipated, i.e. the gate capacitor must be discharged.|$|R
40|$|In {{a series}} of {{experiments}} the peak current during <b>switch</b> <b>on</b> of a fast switching valve, which {{was found to be}} out of tolerances with respect to some armature dimensions, was varied to realize different <b>switch</b> <b>on</b> times.
