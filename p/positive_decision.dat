500|$|To {{cut down}} on costs, the network also {{pressured}} Levinson to relocate filming to California rather than Baltimore, which would reduce costs for travel, lodging and meals. Maryland Governor William Donald Schaefer sent a telegram to Levinson encouraging him {{to remain in the}} city: [...] "I wanted you to know that we are proud of having this exceptional series shot in your native state and stand ready to help toward a <b>positive</b> <b>decision</b> for additional production of the series." [...] Levinson and Fontana considered leaving Baltimore not only for the cost savings, but also because of the letters of outrage by the city's detectives over [...] "See No Evil," [...] as well as a report in the Associated Press that the show was giving Baltimore a bad image by drawing attention to its murder rate. Ultimately, however, Levinson decided to remain in Baltimore. On February 15, 1994, the day the options of the cast contracts expired, NBC decided at midnight to sign for a third season, but ordered only 13 episodes instead of a full 22-episode season, opting to wait and see how the ratings performed before committing to the final nine.|$|E
500|$|On March 2, 2017, Deadline {{reported}} that Netflix {{was in the}} process of renewing the lapsed contracts of the series' eight leading actors, to keep them available until June of the same year, suggesting that a <b>positive</b> <b>decision</b> to renew Sense8 for a third season before that time passes was highly possible. In early May 2017, producer Roberto Malerba said that not all eight regulars of the cast had renewed yet, but the process was still going. He additionally disclosed the first season had an average budget of about $4.5 million per episode, and the second season $9 million per episode. Furthermore, he added that a potential third season would likely be the series' last, due to the complicated nature of the series' production, and the fact Lana Wachowski works as a filmmaker on it almost alone. On June 1, 2017, Netflix announced they had cancelled the series after two seasons. Although no official reason for the cancellation was provided in the press release by Netflix, actor Brian J. Smith, who had hinted at the cancellation a couple of days before the announcement was made, has said it was a problem of low viewership compared to the production's cost. Shortly after the cancellation, Malerba commented that it happened abruptly by Netflix without providing them an explanation, [...] "just numbers".|$|E

2500|$|The {{potentially}} severe {{consequences for}} individuals who are found to have engaged in misconduct also reflect on the institutions that host or employ them and also on the participants in any peer review process that has allowed the publication of questionable research. [...] This means that a range of actors in any case may have a motivation to suppress any evidence or suggestion of misconduct. [...] Persons who expose such cases, commonly called whistleblowers, can find themselves open to retaliation {{by a number of}} different means. These negative consequences for exposers of misconduct have driven the development of whistle blowers charters - designed to protect those who raise concerns. A whistleblower is almost always alone in their fight - their career becomes completely dependent on the decision about alleged misconduct. [...] If the accusations prove false, their career is completely destroyed, but even in case of <b>positive</b> <b>decision</b> the career of the whistleblower can be under question: their reputation of [...] "troublemaker" [...] will prevent many employers from hiring them. There is no international body where a whistleblower could give their concerns. If a university fails to investigate suspected fraud or provides a fake investigation to save their reputation the whistleblower has no right of appeal.|$|E

As to the satisfaction which the Carthaginians ought to render to the Romans for having made war upon their ally contrary to the solemn covenants of the treaty, they said that that was a question for the Carthaginians themselves to consider. They had nothing at present to say upon the subject. The deputies returned to Carthage with this reply, which, of course, produced great uneasiness and anxiety.|$|E

The field they were in enabled him to get up to her side, and now if ever was his opportunity. It was a long straggling meadow which he knew well, with the Dill running by it all the way,--or rather two meadows with an open space where there had once been a gate. He had ridden through the gap a score of times, and knew that at the further side of the second meadow they would come upon the high road. The fields were certainly much better for his purpose than the road. [...] "Don't you think, Mary, you could say a kind word to me?" ...|$|E
60|$|Admiral Bluewater's line, full, blue eye, lighted with an {{expression}} approaching irony; but he made no other answer than a slight inclination of the head. In point of fact, he was a Jacobite: though no one was acquainted with the circumstance but his immediate commanding officer. As a seaman, he was called on only to serve his country; and, as often happens to military men, {{he was willing to}} do this under any superior whom circumstances might place over his head, let his private sentiments be what they might. During the civil war of 1715, he was too young in years, and too low in rank to render his opinions of much importance; and, kept on foreign stations, his services could only affect the general interests of the nation, without producing any influence on the contest at home. Since that period, nothing had occurred to require one, whose duty kept him on the ocean, to come to a very <b>positive</b> <b>decision</b> between the two masters that claimed his allegiance. Sir Gervaise had always been able to persuade him that he was sustaining the honour and interests of his country, and that ought to be sufficient to a patriot, let who would rule. Notwithstanding this wide difference in political feeling between the two admirals--Sir Gervaise being as decided a whig, as his friend was a tory--their personal harmony had been without a shade. As to confidence, the superior knew the inferior so well, that he believed the surest way to prevent his taking sides openly with the Jacobites, or of doing them secret service, was to put it in his power to commit a great breach of trust. So long as faith were put in his integrity, Sir Gervaise felt certain his friend Bluewater might be relied on; and he also knew that, should the moment ever come when the other really intended to abandon the service of the house of Hanover, he would frankly throw up his employments, and join the hostile standard, without profiting, in any manner, by the trusts he had previously enjoyed. It is also necessary that the reader should understand that Admiral Bluewater had never communicated his political opinions to any person but his friend; the Pretender and his counsellors being as ignorant of them, as George II. and his ministers. The only practical effect, therefore, that they had ever produced was to induce him to decline separate commands, several of which had been offered to him; one, quite equal to that enjoyed by Sir Gervaise Oakes, himself.|$|E
