For SV clocks, these include frequency changes due to orbit adjust-ments, and effects due to the earth’s oblateness. For example between 25 July and 10 October 2000, SV 43 occupied a transfer orbit while it was moved f rom slot F 5 to slot F 3. The fractional frequency change associated with a change da in the semi-major axis a (in meters) can be estimated as 9. 429 x 10 -”da. This yields a prediction of- 1. 77 x for the fractional frequency change of the SV 43 clock which occurred 25 July 2000.

40|$|We derive octupole-level secular {{perturbation}} equations for hierarchical triple systems, using classical Hamiltonian perturbation techniques. Our equations {{describe the}} secular {{evolution of the}} orbital eccen-tricities and inclinations over timescales that are long compared to the orbital periods. By extending previous work done to leading (quadrupole) order to octupole level (i. e., including terms of order a 3, where is the ratio of semimajor axes), we obtain expressions that are applicable to a mucha 4 a 1 /a 2 1 wider range of parameters. In particular, our results {{can be applied to}} high-inclination as well as copla-nar systems, and our expressions are valid for almost all mass ratios for which the system is in a stable hierarchical conÐguration.

The classical <b>planetary</b> <b>perturbation</b> theory, while valid to all orders in a, applies only to orbits of low-mass objects orbiting a common central mass, with low eccentricities and low relative inclinations. For triple systems containing a close inner binary, we also discuss the possible interaction between the classical Newtonian perturbations and the general relativistic precession of the inner orbit.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} unlimited The {{acceleration of the}} mean lunar longitude has a small effect on the periods of most terms in a Fourier expansion of the longitude. There are several <b>planetary</b> <b>perturbation</b> terms that have small amplitudes, but whose periods {{are close to the}} resonant period of the lunar libration in longitude. Some of these terms are moving toward resonance, some are moving away from resonance, and the periods of those terms that do not include the Delaunay variables in their arguments are not moving. Because of its acceleration of longitude, the Moon is receding from the Earth, so the magnitude of the restoring torque that the Earth exerts on the rotating Moon is gradually attenuating; thus resonance itself is moving, but at a much slower rate than the periods of the accelerating planetary perturbations. There are fiveplanetary perturbation terms from the ELP- 2000 Ephemeris (with amplitudes of 0 ". 00001 or greater) that have passed through resonance in the past two million years. One of them is of special interest because it appears to be the excitation source of a supposed free libration in longitude that has been detected by the lunar laser ranging experiment.

40|$|Characterizing a microlensing {{planet is}} done from {{modeling}} an observed lensing light curve. In this process, {{it is often}} confronted that solutions of different lensing parameters result in similar light curves, causing difficulties in uniquely interpreting the lens system, and thus understanding the causes {{of different types of}} degeneracy is important. In this work, we show that incomplete coverage of a <b>planetary</b> <b>perturbation</b> can result in degenerate solutions even for events where the planetary signal is detected {{with a high level of}} statistical significance. We demonstrate the degeneracy for an actually observed event OGLE- 2012 -BLG- 0455 /MOA- 2012 -BLG- 206. The peak of this high-magnification event (A_ max∼ 400) exhibits very strong deviation from a point-lens model with Δχ^ 2 ≳ 4000 for data sets with a total number of measurement 6963. From detailed modeling of the light curve, we find that the deviation can be explained by four distinct solutions, i. e., two very different sets of solutions, each with a two-fold degeneracy. While the two-fold (so-called "close/wide") degeneracy is well-understood, the degeneracy between the radically different solutions is not previously known. The model light curves of this degeneracy differ substantially in the parts that were not covered by observation, indicating that the degeneracy is caused by the incomplete coverage of the perturbation. It is expected that the frequency of the degeneracy introduced in this work will be greatly reduced with the improvement of the current lensing survey and follow-up experiments and the advent of new surveys.

40|$|The {{relative}} {{contributions of}} comets and asteroids to the reservoir of {{dust in the}} interplanetary medium is not well known. There are direct observations of dust released from comets and {{there is evidence to}} associate the IRAS dust bands with possible collisions of Asteroids in the main belt. It is believed that one may combine lab analysis of the physics and chemistry of captured particles with orbital data in order to identify comet and asteroid parent bodies. It is possible to use the collected orbits of the dust to connect with its source in two ways. One is to consider the long time orbit evolution of the dust under Poynting-Robertson drag. The other {{is to look at the}} prompt orbit change of dust from comets onto trajectories that intersect the earth's orbit. In order to characterize the orbits of dust particles evolved over a long period of time, a study of its orbital evolution was undertaken. Various parameters associated with these dust orbits as they cross the Earth's orbit were considered in order to see if one may discriminate between particles evolved from comets and asteroids. The method was to calculate by a numerical procedure the orbits of dust particles after they left their parent bodies. It appears that as the particles pass the Earth's orbit, asteroidal grains and cometary grains can be differentiated on the basis of their measured orbital eccentricities even after much <b>planetary</b> <b>perturbation.</b> Broad parent daughter associations can be made on this basis from measurement of their trajectories intercepted in earth orbit...|$|E

40|$|To provide {{criteria}} {{in the selection}} of target events preferable for planetary lensing follow-up observations, we investigate the variation of the probability of detecting planetary signals depending on the observables of the lensing magnification and source brightness. In estimating the probability, we consider variation of the photometric precision by using a quantity defined as the ratio of the fractional deviation of the <b>planetary</b> <b>perturbation</b> to the photometric precision. From this investigation, we find consistent result from previous studies that the probability increases with the increase of the magnification. The increase rate is boosted at a certain magnification at which perturbations caused by central caustic begin to occur. We find this boost occurs at moderate magnifications of A � 20, implying that probability can be high even for events with moderate magnifications. The probability increases as the source brightness increases. We find that the probability of events associated with stars brighter than clump giants is not negligible even at magnifications as low as A ∼ 5. In the absence of rare the prime target of very high-magnification events, we, therefore, recommend to observe events with brightest source stars and highest magnifications among the alerted events. Due to the increase of the source size with the increase of the brightness, however, the probability rapidly drops off beyond a certain magnification, causing detections of low mass ratio planets (q � 10 − 4) difficult from the observations of events involved with giant stars with magnifications A � 70.

The <b>planetary</b> <b>perturbation</b> is {{strongly}} detected, Δχ^ 2 ∼ 10, 000, because it arises from a bright (therefore, large) source passing over and enveloping the planetary caustic: a so-called "Hollywood" event. The factor ∼ 2. 5 offset in q arises because of a previously unrecognized discrete degeneracy between Hollywood events in which the caustic is fully enveloped and those in which only one flank is enveloped, which we dub "Cannae" and "von Schlieffen", respectively. This degeneracy is "accidental" in that it arises from gaps in the data. Nevertheless, {{the fact that it}} appears in a Δχ^ 2 = 10, 000 planetary anomaly is striking. We present a simple formalism to estimate the sensitivity of other Hollywood events to planets and show that they can lead to detections close to, but perhaps not quite reaching, the Earth/Sun mass ratio of 3 × 10 ^- 6. This formalism also enables an analytic understanding of the factor ∼ 2. 5 offset in q between the Cannae and von Schlieffen solutions. The Bayesian estimates for the host-mass, system distance, and planet-host projected separation are M= 0. 39 ^+ 0. 40 _- 0. 24 M_, D_L= 4. 8 ^+ 1. 5 _- 1. 8, and a_= 3. 8 ± 1. 6.
