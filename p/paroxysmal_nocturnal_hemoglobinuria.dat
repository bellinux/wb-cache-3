25|$|<b>Paroxysmal</b> <b>nocturnal</b> <b>hemoglobinuria</b> (PNH) is a rare, acquired, {{life-threatening}} {{disease of}} the blood characterized by destruction of red blood cells by the complement system, {{a part of the}} body's innate immune system. This destructive process occurs due to the presence of defective surface proteins on the red blood cell, which normally function to inhibit such immune reactions. Since the complement cascade attacks the red blood cells within the blood vessels of the circulatory system, the red blood cell destruction (hemolysis) is considered an intravascular hemolytic anemia. Other key features of the disease, such as the high incidence of blood clot formation, are incompletely understood.|$|E

25|$|There are {{currently}} more than 50 known membrane proteins, which can {{exist in a}} few hundred up to a million copies per red blood cell. Approximately 25 of these membrane proteins carry the various blood group antigens, such as the A, B and Rh antigens, among many others. These membrane proteins can perform a wide diversity of functions, such as transporting ions and molecules across the red cell membrane, adhesion and interaction with other cells such as endothelial cells, as signaling receptors, {{as well as other}} currently unknown functions. The blood types of humans are due to variations in surface glycoproteins of red blood cells. Disorders of the proteins in these membranes are associated with many disorders, such as hereditary spherocytosis, hereditary elliptocytosis, hereditary stomatocytosis, and <b>paroxysmal</b> <b>nocturnal</b> <b>hemoglobinuria.</b>|$|E

40|$|Eculizumab is an anti-complement C 5 {{monoclonal}} antibody which has greatly improved the prognosis and outcomes of <b>nocturnal</b> <b>paroxysmal</b> <b>hemoglobinuria</b> and atypical hemolytic and uremic syndromes. It {{is also known}} to be very species-specific for human C 5, despite an important degree of conservation of the targeted macroglobulin domain, MG 7, with that of other primates. However, the published eculizumab linear epitope does not explain this species specificity. Sequence analysis, in silico docking and reverse phase protein array were implemented to fully characterize the eculizumab epitope on human complement C 5. Several residues potentially involved in the species specificity were identified outside the known epitope by sequence analysis. In silico docking confirmed the implication of a beta-hairpin located between residues 913 and 922, outside the known epitope, in the binding of eculizumab to C 5. This beta-hairpin spreads from S 913 to I 922 and contains a tryptophan residue on position 917 which is unique to humans. The contribution of both this peptide and the already known one epitope, which spreads between residues C 883 and S 891, was validated by reverse phase protein assay, clearly demonstrating the discontinuous nature of the epitope. Two residues in particular, Arg 885 and Trp 917, were defined as major participants in the interaction of C 5 and eculizumab. Their important role was confirmed by the recent publication of a crystal structure of eculizumab Fab bound to C 5. The beta-hairpin not only explains the fine species specificity of eculizumab but {{is also an important}} site at the C 5 /C 5 convertase interface, revealing how eculizumab acts as a competitor of C 5 convertases...|$|R
