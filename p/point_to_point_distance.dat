5000|$|As one example, [...] "Shared taxis" [...] - {{and known}} just as that - have been {{operating}} in Mumbai, India, {{since the early}} 1970s. These are more like a point to point service that operates only during the peak hours. During off peak hours, they ply just like the regular taxis, can be hailed anywhere on the roads, and passengers are charged by the meter. But in order {{to bridge the gap}} between demand and supply, during peak hours, several of them operate as Shared Taxis, taking a full cab load of passengers to a more or less common destination. The pick-up points for these taxis are fixed, and are marked by a post that says, “Shared Taxis” and cabs line up at this point during peak hours. They display the general destination they are headed for on their windscreens, and passengers just get in and wait for the cab to fill up. As soon as this happens - which takes less than a couple of minutes - the cab moves off. Fares are a fixed amount - fixed between the Taxi Unions and the authorities for the <b>point</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>distance</b> - and are far lower than the metered fare to the same destination, but higher than the bus or train fare. Time taken is obviously much less than that by bus. These taxis are very popular because of the lack of waiting time, faster journey speeds, greater comfort, and absence of the crush loads of peak hour commuter traffic in buses and trains. Generally, the taxi drivers choose the locality that they live in, in the suburbs as the destination in the evenings, and in the mornings, the destinations are always the CBD in South Mumbai." ...|$|E

We register such automatically generated point cloud on a TLS point cloud of the same object to discuss accuracy, advantages and limitations of the iPhone generated point clouds. For the chosen example showcase, we have classified 1. 23 % of the iPhone point cloud points as outliers, and calculated {{the mean of the}} <b>point</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>distances</b> <b>to</b> the TLS <b>point</b> cloud as 0. 11 m. Since a TLS point cloud might also include measurement errors and noise, we computed local noise values for the point clouds from both sources.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a new fault location algorithm for radial MV distribution networks employing distributed travelling wave observers. Incipient fault location {{may reduce the}} risk of wild or bush fire ignition by faulty MV overhead lines. Some faults can develop over time and may exist for an extended period before the right weather conditions result in a fire. Developing faults will produce travelling voltage waves. The distributed observers are synchronized by global positioning system and use the arrival time differences to locate faults. Modal and wavelet transformation is used to detect and time stamp the travelling wave arrival time by observers. The paper first provides a brief review of fault location technology then describes the Floyd-Warshell algorithm to calculate <b>point</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>distance</b> matrix.

The study is aimed to investigate the energy transfer to the cell nucleus exposed to X-rays from low dose in the environment to high dose in radiation therapy. As an example, we adopted a water phantom (rectangular solid, 30 × 30 × 30 cm) exposed to a linac 6 MV X-ray to calculate the expected energy transfer to electrons in liquid water. Then, a track simulation of the electrons produced by the photon interactions was performed. In the track simulation, the behavior of low energy electrons below 1 keV is of particular importance to form clusters of ionization and excitation events within a nanometer scale (< 100 nm). We describe the clustering pattern in terms of aggregation index (AI), the distribution of <b>point</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>distance</b> below several nanometers between the events. By comparing the distribution {{with that of the}} Poisson configuration, the clustering effects of the events including successive radical processes are evaluated...|$|E

40|$|Laser {{scanning}} samples {{the surface}} geometry of objects efficiently and records versatile information as point clouds. However, often more scans {{are required to}} fully cover a scene. Therefore, a registration step is required that transforms the different scans into a common coordinate system. The registration of point clouds is usually conducted in two steps, i. e. coarse registration followed by fine registration. In this study an automatic marker-free coarse registration method for pair-wise scans is presented. First the two input point clouds are re-sampled as voxels and dimensionality features of the voxels are determined by principal component analysis (PCA). Then voxel cells with the same dimensionality are clustered. Next, the Extended Gaussian Image (EGI) descriptor of those voxel clusters are constructed using significant eigenvectors of each voxel in the cluster. Correspondences between clusters in source and target data are obtained according to the similarity between their EGI descriptors. The random sampling consensus (RANSAC) algorithm is employed to remove outlying correspondences until a coarse alignment is obtained. If necessary, a fine registration is performed in a final step. This new method is illustrated on scan data sampling two indoor scenarios. The results of the tests are evaluated by computing the <b>point</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>distance</b> between the two input point clouds. The presented two tests resulted in mean distances of 7. 6  mm and 9. 5  mm respectively, which are adequate for fine registration...|$|E
40|$|Brain {{surfaces}} {{provide a}} reliable representation for cortical mapping. The construction of correct surfaces from magnetic resonance images (MRI) segmentation is a challenging task, especially when genus zero surfaces {{are required for}} further processing such as parameterization, partial inflation and registration. The generation of such surfaces has been approached either by correcting a binary image {{as part of the}} segmentation pipeline or by modifying the mesh representing the surface. During this task, the preservation of the structure may be compromised because of the convoluted nature of the brain and noisy/imperfect segmentations. In this paper, we propose a combined, voxel and surfacebased, topology correction method which preserves the structure of the brain while yielding genus zero surfaces. The topology of the binary segmentation is first corrected using a set of topology preserving operators applied sequentially. This results in a white matter/gray matter binary set with correct sulci delineation, homotopic to a filled sphere. Using the corrected segmentation, a marching cubes mesh is then generated and the tunnels and handles resulting from the meshing are finally removed with an algorithm based on the detection of nonseparating loops. The approach was validated using 20 young individuals MRI from the OASIS database, acquired at two different time-points. Reproducibility and robustness were evaluated using global and local criteria such as surface area, curvature and <b>point</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>distance.</b> Results demonstrated the method capability to produce genus zero meshes while preserving geometry, two fundamental properties for reliable and accurate cortical mapping and further clinical studies...|$|E
30|$|During {{the present}} study, coal samples were {{collected}} from Derra underground coal mines following the pillar coal sampling method. Coal {{samples were collected}} from Karharbari Top seam and Karharbari Bottom seam. Their megascopic characterization was performed by using the scheme proposed by Diessel (1965) and macroscopic seam profiles were constructed. For the microscopic study coal samples were crushed to 18 mesh size (< 1  mm size particles). The polished particulate coal mounts were prepared by using cold mounting epoxy resin without pressure. The study was carried out on an advanced petrological microscope equipped with MSP 200 photometry system and fluorescence attachment. The maceral nomenclature applied, followed the ICCP system (1971, 1998, 2001). For the microlithotype analysis, a 20 point Kötter graticule was used. The line to line and <b>point</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>distance</b> was maintained 0.4  mm for both maceral and microlithotype analysis. The maceral and microlithotype counting was done simultaneously. The reflectance measurement was carried out as per the ISO standard (ISO 7404 - 5 1994). For the precise assessment of liptinite and dark vitrinite microscopic examination of macerals was carried out both under the white incident light as well as under blue light excitation. The International Committees for coal Petrology (1971) devised certain rules for the characterization of maceral association. According to which, the minimum dimension of a band {{to be called a}} microlithotype, should be 50  ×  50  mm, and the 5  % rule. The 5  % rule demonstrates that a microlithotype can have 5  % accessory macerals due to the very fact that neither the monomaceral nor the bimaceral microlithotypes are constituted exclusively of the macerals of one group or two groups respectively. Therefore, they can have 5  % accessory macerals which will have no role in their nomenclature or characterization. ICCP recommendation has been followed during the characterization of microlithotype. All the coal samples were subjected to proximate (BIS 2003) and petrographic analysis.|$|E

40|$|The {{widespread}} {{proliferation of}} portable hand held computing devices {{in the form}} of mobile phones, rivaling 6 year old desktop computers in raw computational power and outclassing them in terms of communication interfaces and interoperability, gave rise to a plethora of new geospatial applications and services. One of the many roles a modern mobile phone can provide, is the complete substitution of printed maps with added functionality as navigation aid, for self localization, or - with more semantic back-end information - complex routing queries all around the world. With the computer-based compilation {{of the majority of the}} worlds' road networks, which are freely available to everyone {{in the form of}} OpenStreetMap, vast geospatial databases are to our disposal today. One of the most fundamental questions in such a network is to compute a shortest (or quickest) path between two designated points. This problem was solved by Dijkstra in 1959 in a provably optimal way, but his algorithm, although very elegant and simple in design, does not scale well on continent sized road graphs. Therefore a multitude of alternative approaches for the single-source-single-target shortest path problem and more complicated flavors were devised in the last decade. The motivation for highly efficient algorithms in this field is twofold. On the one hand they enable a real time user experience on a mobile phone, even for complex tasks, on the other hand these approaches scale well when a server back-end is employed, whose task is to server a large number of mobile agents. If used in combination these techniques enable us to compute different shortest path related problems in the order of ten milliseconds on the complete road network of Europe. This constitutes a speedup of more than three magnitudes compared to Dijkstra's approach. This work consists of three main parts, each addressing an exemplary problem in the field of geospatial application which are outlined in the following sections. - Transit Node Constructions Revisited In the first part we reconsider the concept of transit nodes as introduced by Bast et al. Transit nodes are an offline speed up technique which enables very fast point to point shortest path distance computations and are based on a precomputed <b>point</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>distance</b> table of a small subsets of nodes - the transit nodes. For the first time we construct instance based lower bounds on the size of transit node sets by interpreting a LP formulation of the problem and its dual and, as a side product, we achieve considerably smaller access node sets which directly improve the query time for non-local queries. We devise an algorithm to construct transit node sets for this theoretic framework and verify their properties with a practical implementation. This result was also published as ''Transit Nodes - Lower Bounds and Refined Construction'' at the 14 th Meeting on Algorithm Engineering and Experiments (ALENEX) in 2012. - Applications of speedup Techniques: Path Prediction In the second chapter of this work we work on the path prediction problem - given the path a mobile user has moved along in a road network up to the current moment, predict where the user will move along in the near future. In contrast to known solutions to this problem we will compute our prediction not only based on the geometry of the known path (using extrapolation) or directional information implied by the underlying road network but make explicit use of the structure of the space of shortest paths in the network. Our proposed path prediction algorithm is equally simple but yields extremely accurate predictions at a very low computational cost. This work was published as path of the paper ''Algorithms for Matching and Predicting Trajectories'' in the 13 th Meeting on Algorithm Engineering and Experiments (ALENEX) at 2011. - Applications of speedup Techniques: Sequenced Route Queries The third and final chapter considers the problem of a sequenced route query - the problem of planning an optimal route (quickest or shortest) that visits facilities of the respective type (for example a gas station or a super market) on the way home. The proposed solution, based on the combination of a distance sensitive doubling technique and contraction hierarchies, is orders of magnitudes faster than either a naive approach or previous results. In addition it produces the answers in an instant for realistic queries without compromising guaranteed optimality. With such fast query times, this type of route query becomes feasible even on mobile devices or for high-throughput web-based route planners. This work is published as ''Sequenced Route Queries: Getting Things Done on the Way Back Home'' in the Proceedings of the 20 th International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems (SIGSPATIAL) in 2012. In dieser Arbeit bearbeiten wir drei Problemstellungen aus dem Bereich der Routenplanung und deren Anwendung auf großen Straßennetzwerken. Im ersten Kapitel haben wie eine Methode vorgestellt Transitknotenmengen auf eine bestimmte Art und Weise zu berechnen, die es uns ermöglicht instanzbasiert Aussagen über die Approximationsgüte dieser Mengen zu treffen. Wir haben dafür eine Definition von ''langen'' kürzesten Wegen gewählt, welche entweder direkt auf deren Länge oder aber dem Dijkstrarank ihrer Knoten basiert, und einen Algorithmus entwickelt, der Präfixe aller dieser Pfade effizient berechnet. Mit diesen Präfixen haben wir ein Mengenüberdeckungsproblem und das duale Mengenpackungsproblem definiert, mit denen wir aus den Resultaten der ganzzahligen linearen Optimierung eine untere Schranke für die optimale Größe einer optimalen Transitknotenmenge herleiten können. Wir haben diesen Ansatz mit anderen Konstruktionsverfahren verglichen, um zu erfahren ob diese bei gleicher Definition von ''lang'' nicht wesentlich kleiner gewählt werden könnten. Dies ist nicht der Fall. Allerdings konnten wir zeigen, dass die mit unserer Methode generierten Transitknotenmengen in wesentlich weniger Transitknoten per Knoten im Graph resultieren und damit direkt schnellere kürzeste Pfad Anfragen erlauben. Im zweiten Kapitel ging es um Pfadvorhersage als Anwendung von schnellen Routenplanungsalgorithmen. Da Straßengraphen eine stark ausgeprägte hierarchische Struktur aufweisen, konnten wir dies nutzen um gefahrene kürzeste Wege ab einer gewissen Länge mit sehr hoher Präzision vorherzusagen. Wir haben dafür die ''Reach'' Metrik von Kanten benutzt, die für jede Kante die Länge des längsten küzesten Pfades angibt, welcher durch diese Kante geht. Zusammen mit anderen komplexen Metriken wie der Anzahl an kürzesten Wegen welche in einem Knoten starten, haben wir mehrere komplett auf Vorberechnung basierende Vorhersagestrategien entwickelt. Diese haben gegenüber ihren online Gegenstücken nicht nur den Vorteil bei der eigentlichen Anfrage weniger Rechenschritte zu benötigen, als auch wesentlich weniger Vorhersagefehler zu erzeugen. Wir haben mehrere online sowie offline Strategien praktisch verglichen und eine optimale Kombination vorgestellt, welche die Anzahl von Vorhersagefehlern minimiert. Das letzte Kapitel ist eine Anwendung von ''Contraction Hierarchies''. CHs ermöglichen sehr schnell kürzeste Wege zu berechnen. Dies nutzen wir um eine Modifizierte Variante des Problems des Handlungsreisenden zu lösen, bei der zwar die Reihenfolge der Städte fixiert ist aber für jede Stadt sehr viele Alternativen zur Verfügung stehen. Wir haben dafür einen Suchalgorithmus entwickelt, der für je zwei aufeinander folgende Zielmengen einen Suchraum bildet und sich dann iterativ in größer werdenden Abständen vom Startpunkt durch diese Suchräume arbeitet. Dies erlaubt uns Optimalität bei der Länge des Weges beizubehalten und nie mehr als einen konstanten Faktor an möglichen Stadtknoten zu viel zu explorieren. Wir zeigen, dass unsere Implementierung schnell genug ist, um jede realistische Anfrage in wenigen Millisekunden optimal zu beantworten...|$|E
