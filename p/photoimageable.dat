Other types are the liquid <b>photoimageable</b> solder mask (LPSM or LPI) inks and dry film <b>photoimageable</b> solder mask (DFSM). LPSM can be silkscreened or sprayed on the PCB, exposed to the pattern and developed to provide openings in the pattern for parts to be soldered to the copper pads.

40|$|Rectangular {{waveguide}} {{is known}} for its ability to propagate microwave signals with low loss {{in a wide range of}} microwave and millimetre-wave applications. Recent developments in these applications have focussed particularly on integration of different circuits and miniaturisation of modules; rectangular waveguide requires expensive fabrication methods and is replaced wherever possible with planar transmission lines. However, these have much higher losses. This research has investigated the feasibility of several low cost methods of fabricating dielectric-filled rectangular waveguide. The methods used are based on multichip module (MCM) technology. The technologies used to fabricate the waveguides are multichip module laminate (MCM-L) and multichip module ceramic (MCM-C) processes. In the MCM-L method, a PCB milling machine technique was used with PCB laminates designed for a multilayer process. With the MCM-C technology, two material types are used to fabricate dielectric-filled waveguide using multilayer thick film processing. The materials used are the photoetchable and <b>photoimageable</b> thick film pastes. The <b>photoimageable</b> thick film process was successfully used to fabricate H-plane offset waveguide filters. LTCC processing using Green Tape materials was also investigated for the dielectric-filled rectangular waveguide fabrication. The MCM-L and photoetchable thick film dielectric filled rectangular were fabricated in- house, whilst the <b>photoimageable</b> waveguide was fabricated by Hibridas as part of a collaborative project. The performances were tested using TRL calibration on the VNA, and a range of transitions, guides, and filters have been evaluated, including a 160 - 170 GHz bandpass filter.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the performance of}} thin-film microstrip (TFMS) transmission lines and passive components fabricated using <b>photoimageable</b> thick-film technology. The fabrication of narrow conductors (down to 15 [*]μm) and small feature size via holes is made possible by adding a photoimaging process into the conventional thick-film screen-printing process. With this, thin-film microstrip (TFMS) structures can be implemented, whereas traditional thick-film technology cannot produce such narrow linewidths. TFMS is extremely attractive for {{the high levels of}} circuit integration desired in multichip modules (MCMs). Wideband characterisation of these TFMS lines has been performed over the frequency range 1 – 110 [*]GHz using the TRL calibration technique. The effects of coupling between line segments and discontinuities at bends in meandered lines have also been studied.

40|$|The {{rapidly growing}} {{wireless}} industry needs new high performance materials to build low loss, high density, thermally stable integrated packages. Applications include automotive safety, control, {{global positioning system}} (GPS) mapping and entertainment, multifunctional portable phones, home entertainment, office voice, video and data transmission through wireless local area networks (WLAN). This paper describes ceramic tapes developed to meet these needs. The GHz operating frequencies of these systems require substrate materials with lower loss, low dielectric constant (K) and good power handling characteristics which are important {{in many of these}} applications. Low loss is a critical requirement for lightweight portable devices for long battery life. The dielectric constant of 4. 2 is lower than alumina and some other ceramic materials which have been used in multilayer packages. This is important because higher dielectric constant results in slower signal velocity, and higher resistivity in thinner trace widths of transmission lines. Higher K also contributes to cross-talk problems between traces. The system described here is fired at 850 °C and thus allows the use of high conductivity precious metal conductors.

40|$|Increased {{demands for}} small circuit feature sizes have {{provided}} incentives {{to the development}} of new photoformable thick film compositions. Previously the limited applicability of such materials meant that only gold (Au) and in some cases silver (Ag) based compositions were developed. Now, with strong interest being shown by automotive and wireless markets coupled with those who want to replace thin film with a lower cost process, activity in photoformable materials development has become very significant and the definition of what is needed and its priorities are becoming clearer. This paper describes the characteristics of some newly developed photoformable materials, including Au, Ag, and Ag-Pt (platinum) conductors, capable of 30 mm lines on a 60 mm pitch, a robust Ag compatible dielectric material, based on QM 44 technology, capable of forming vias as small as 50 mm on a 100 mm pitch, and blendable low ohm resistors also capable of very small sizes (50 mm* 50 mm).

40|$|Woven glass fabric/BT (bismaleimide triazine) {{composite}} laminate (BT core), copper (Cu), and <b>photoimageable</b> solder resist (PSR) {{are the most}} widely used materials for semiconductors in electronic devices. Among these materials, BT core and PSR contain polymeric materials that exhibit viscoelastic behavior. For this reason, these materials are considered to have time-and temperature-dependent moduli during warpage analysis. However, the thin geometry of multilayer printed circuit board (PCB) film makes it difficult to identify viscoelastic characteristics. In this work, a vibration test method was proposed for measuring the viscoelastic properties of a multilayer PCB film at different temperatures. The beam-shaped specimens, composed of a BT core, Cu laminated on a BT core, and PSR and Cu laminated on a BT core, were used in the vibration test. The frequency-dependent variation of the complex bending stiffness was determined using a transfer function method. The storage modulus (E&# 39;) of the BT core, Cu, and PSR as a function of temperature and frequency were obtained, and their temperature-dependent variation was identified. The obtained properties were fitted using a viscoelastic model for the BT core and the PSR, and a linear elastic model for the Cu. Warpage of a line pattern specimen due to temperature variation was measured using a shadow Moire analysis and compared to predictions using a finite element model. The results provide information on the mechanism of warpage, especially warpage due to temperature-dependent variation in viscoelastic properties.
