50|$|Development of {{the craft}} was not straightforward, having posed several {{challenges}} and difficulties {{that needed to be}} overcome from the onset. Early on, one criticism of the Model A was that the single annular <b>peripheral</b> <b>jet</b> engine would be incapable of adequate pitch and roll stability while the diagonal stability jets featured on Cockerell's original model had been eliminated; however Saunders-Roe's aerodynamics office were confident that the design was good. In part to answer these doubts, a three-dimensional model was produced and subjected to wind tunnel tests, which revealed extreme instability. A 'stop design' order was promptly issued on the cushion system while further tests were performed, which determined that the addition of single peripheral jets remained inadequate for the original design. As the use of transverse jets, as used on the original model, was impractical, an extended planform was adopted along with an additional <b>peripheral</b> <b>jet</b> along the outside to address the stability issue. After further model testing, the bottom surface was inclined at a shallow 6-degree angle as well.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} effect of the nucleon meson cloud on {{centrality}} dependence of the jet nuclear modification factor R_pA. We find that the meson-baryon Fock components may lead to a noticeable deviation of R_pA from unity. Our results for R_pA show the same tendency as that observed by ATLAS in p+Pb collisions at √(s) = 5. 02 TeV. The meson cloud suppresses the central jet events and enhances the <b>peripheral</b> <b>jet</b> events. But quantitatively the effect is somewhat smaller than in the data.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to examine the influence of various parameters on the optimization of various blowing configurations of multiple swirling jets experimentally and numerically. This study show that the number of vanes and their inclination of the diffuser, the sense of rotation of <b>peripheral</b> <b>jets</b> relative to the central jet and their arrangement in temperatures and positions, affects the quality of the thermal homogenization of ambiance. Experiences concerning the interaction of several jets show that the resulting jet is clearly more homogenized under swirling influence. Among the studied different configuration, the one which consists of a swirling central jet controlling the behavior of tow swirling jets in counter-rotation, is shown to be the most effective in terms of thermal homogenization. The current study is carried out under uniform heat flux condition for each diffuser, the air being the working fluid and flow rate was adjusted at the Reynolds numbers Re 0 = 3. 104. In this work, the three dimensional simulations have been carried out using the finite volume CFD solver Fluent, in which the standard k-e, k-e R. N. G and the Reynolds stress turbulence model (RSM) were used for turbulence computations. Overall predictions obtained with the RSM model are in better agreement with the experimental data compared to those of the standard k-e model. The analysis of the flow features clearly demonstrate that the interaction between swirling jets induces the redistribution of temperature in the mixing zone, while allowing the spreading of the resulting jet. It appears that the central jet plays an important role in the enhancement of the thermal homogenization. The findings of this study show that a balance and an imbalance in temperature and position between the central and <b>peripheral</b> <b>jets,</b> affect the quality of the thermal homogenization of the ambiance...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMore than 300 {{epicardial}} Doppler color flow mapping {{studies on}} 23 {{different types of}} clinical and preclinical valves were performed after implantation in the mitral position in sheep. The transducers were placed directly on the heart to obtain the greatest possible resolution. Studies were performed in each animal under different hemodynamic conditions by varying heart rate and cardiac output. Eighty-six valves were studied late (20 to 52 weeks), whereas the remainder were studied early (0 to 10 days) after operation. The valves included 3 types of ball and cage valves, 3 types of disc and cage valves, 7 types of tilting disc valves, 1 type of bileaflet hemidisc mechanical valve, 13 types of porcine aortic valves and 5 types of bovine pericardial valves. The results of these studies were compared with those obtained in 40 studies of 20 native mitral valves. Doppler color velocity/flow profiles were imaged in real time with simultaneous electrocardiographic gating; the aortic flow was also displayed for the timing of velocity/flow events. Native normal mitral valves had no in-orifice flow disturbances and laminar low velocity/flow directed toward the left ventricular apex. Ball and cage and disc and cage valves had high velocity <b>peripheral</b> <b>jets</b> and vortices of velocity/flow reversals distal to the occluders. Tilting disc valves had differing velocity/flow patterns determined by their orientation in the mitral anulus. Bileaflet hemidisc valves had three jets, which decayed 1. 5 cm downstream. Porcine aortic and bovine pericardial bioprosthetic valves had high velocity, turbulent, nonaxisymmetric jets (more severe for the latter). These observations are similar and complementary to those obtained by in vitro flow visualization techniques and those obtained by laser Doppler anemometry. As such, they provide an important interface between the in vitro assessment of prosthetic valve function and the clinical utility of Doppler color velocity flow imaging technology...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} computational {{and experimental}} results {{on a new}} burner configuration with a mild combustion concept with heat release rates up to 10 MW/m 3. The burner configuration is shown to achieve mild combustion by using air at ambient temperature at high recirculation rates (250 %– 290 %) both experimentally and computationally. The principal features of the configuration are: (1) a burner with forward exit for exhaust gases; (2) injection of gaseous fuel and air as multiple, alternate, <b>peripheral</b> high-speed <b>jets</b> at the bottom at ambient temperature, thus creating high enough recirculation rates of the hot combustion products into fresh incoming reactants; and (3) use of a suitable geometric artifice—a frustum of a cone to help recirculation. The computational studies {{have been used to}} reveal the details of the flow and to optimize the combustor geometry based on recirculation rates. Measures, involving root mean square temperature fluctuations, distribution of temperature and oxidizer concentration inside the pro-posed burner, and a classical turbulent diffusion jet flame, are used to distinguish between them quanti-tatively. The system, operated at heat release rates of 2 to 10 MW/m 3 (compared to 0. 02 to 0. 32 MW/m 3 in the earlier studies), shows a 10 – 15 dB reduction in noise in the mild combustion mode compared to a simple open-top burner and exhaust NOx emission below 10 ppm for a 3 kW burner with 10 % excess air. The peak temperature is measured around 1750 K, approximately 300 K lower than the peak temperature in a conventional burner...|$|R
40|$|Problem statement: The {{extraction}} hoods {{commonly used}} as inlet {{element of the}} local ventilation systems exhibit limited emission capture over moderate distances from {{the source of the}} hazardous emissions. Proposed inclusion of a swirling <b>peripheral</b> <b>jet</b> was found to increase the effective length over which the extraction hood successfully captures harmful fumes. However information on a detailed pattern field of the vortex focused inflow was insufficient thus restricting the potential applications of the method. Approach: The numerical modeling study of the focusing by vortex inflow was accomplished to reveal the implication of the key operating parameters. In addition the visualization technique was applied to confirm the fume capturing features. Results: The simulated overall flow field patterns for an inflow of 10 m sec - 1 value under sets of 0. 5 - 1. 5 swirl numbers and 0 - 21 m sec - 1 outcome velocities of <b>peripheral</b> <b>jet</b> showed the arrangement and contour of the capture stream. Under optimum parameters the capture zone derived from the vector velocity field yielded up to 4 inlet diameters near-axis distance from the extractor entrance. The complimentary observations using laser sheet visualization technique confirmed the enhanced capturing capacity from the mist or smoke sources of emission. Conclusion: Through numerical modeling study the capacity of peripheral vortex shielding to generate the more concentrated exhaust inflow comparing with action of the conventional hood has been elucidated...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{magnitude}} and {{spatial distribution of}} normal leakage through mechanical prosthetic valves were studied in an in vitro model of mitral regurgitation. The effective regurgitant orifice was calculated from regurgitant rate at different transvalvular pressure differences and flow velocities. This effective orifice area was 0. 6 to 2 mm 2 for three tilting disc prostheses (Medtronic-Hall sizes 21, 25 and 29) and 0. 2 to 1. 1 mm 2 for three bileaflet valves (St. Jude Medical sizes 21, 25 and 33). In the single disc valves, Doppler color flow examination disclosed a prominent central regurgitant jet around the central hole for the strut, accompanied by minor leakage along {{the rim of the}} disc (central to <b>peripheral</b> <b>jet</b> area ratio 3. 3 ± 1. 2). The bileaflet prostheses showed a peculiar complex pattern: in planes parallel to the two disc axes, convergent peripherally arising jets were visualized, whereas in orthogonal planes several diverging jets were seen. Mounting the disc and bileaflet valves on a water-filled tube allowed reproduction and interpretation of this pattern: for the bileaflet valve, the jets originated predominantly from valve ring protrusions that contained the axis hinge points and created a converging V pattern in planes parallel to the leaflets and a diverging V pattern in orthogonal planes. Similar patterns were observed during transesophageal echocardiography in 20 patients with a normally functioning St. Jude prosthesis. In 10 patients with a Medtronic-Hall valve, a dominant central jet was observed with one or more smaller peripheral jets. The median central to <b>peripheral</b> <b>jet</b> area ratio was 5 to 1. In summary, in two types of mechanical valve prostheses, effective leakage orifice areas are reported and criteria proposed for the differentiation of “physiologic” and pathologic regurgitation based on the spatial configuration of the jets...|$|E

40|$|In {{relativistic}} collisions between nuclei, {{the creation}} of a strongly interacting medium, called the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP), is expected. It is expected that such a medium also existed in the early universe just after the Big Bang. The phase transition of interest is where the dense medium of free and unbound quarks and gluons cools down to form the ordinary matter consisting of hadrons. The phase transition from ordinary matter to a QGP is predicted in lattice formulations of Quantum Chromo Dynamics at energy densities well above a critical value of 1 GeV/fm 3. At present a QGP might also exist in the dense cores of neutron stars. Properties of the QGP can be probed by high-energy partons interacting with the constituents of the QGP. In this interaction the high-energy parton exchanges momentum with the medium. As a consequence, the parton loses energy by radiating gluons. This process is called jet quenching. High-energy partons are created in the early phase of a heavy-ion collision in hard scattering processes of the constituents of the colliding nucleons. They are a well calibrated probe since the initial parton production rates can be calculated with perturbative QCD. The scattered partons propagate through the medium and fragment into jets of hadrons. This process is expected to be modified in heavy-ion collisions compared to proton-proton collisions due to jet quenching. In this thesis a phenomenological study as well as an experimental observable of jet quenching is presented. A selection of parton energy loss models is studied in a simplified and a realistic medium geometry. Due to different approximations in the parton energy loss implementations of the models, the predictions of the medium energy density in heavy-ion collisions differs significantly. High-pT measurements at RHIC and LHC are compared to model calculations. All models have difficulties describing multiple observables simultaneously. The production of jets in heavy-ion collisions is measured with data collected by ALICE at the LHC at √sNN= 2. 76 TeV. For this analysis jets are reconstructed from charged particles detected in the central tracking detectors of ALICE. The charged particles are the constituents of the jets and are measured with a high efficiency down to very low transverse momenta (150 MeV/c). The challenge in heavy-ion collisions is to separate the particles originating from the hard parton and from the soft underlying event. The background from soft particle production is determined for each event and subtracted. The remaining influence of underlying event fluctuations is quantified by embedding different probes into heavy-ion data. A strong suppression of inclusive jet production is observed in central events when the energy density of the created plasma is highest. For more <b>peripheral</b> events the <b>jet</b> spectrum is less suppressed. The observed suppression for jets is found to be similar to charged hadrons, which suggests that the radiated energy captured by the jet is limited. The ratio of jets with resolution parameters R= 0. 2 and R= 0. 3 is found to be similar in pp and Pb-Pb events, indicating no strong broadening of the radial jet structure...|$|R
40|$|The spray {{characteristics}} of pneumatic atomizers are examined using hot film anemometry. Measurements of drop size distribution, concentration profile and drop frequency {{are carried out}} over wide ranges of relative position between air <b>peripheral</b> <b>jet</b> exit and the concentric water nozzle exit. The objective is to clarify the role of turbulence in producing {{a wide spectrum of}} particle sizes and numbers in the spray. The output signal from hot film contained multispikes with different amplitudes and thickness which has been correlated to the drop number density and the droplet size through the use of probability density function. Generally it is found that an increase of the guide relative position enhances the mixing process and produces finer spray. This is attributed to the utilization of high wave number eddies in shortening the liquid jet break up length. King Saud Universit...|$|E
40|$|In {{the field}} of A. C. (Air Cushion) technology, the non-dimensional power coefficient, Cp, is made rapidly high with h/t small, where h is the ground height and t is the jet thickness, and the {{theoretical}} predictions of Cp based on four familiar theories are different. Therefor, {{it is necessary to}} examine the characteristics of the hovering power by the detailed experiments, in order to find out the optimum Cp; to find out the height ratio, h/t at which Cp becomes minimum. We, hence, conducted the experiments with the two-dimensional model in the range of h/t≦ 3 and the results are summarized as follows; (a) The optimum value of h/t was 1. 1 ~ 1. 5, so h/t ＜ 1, which is used in practical A. C., must be converted. (b) Jet setting angle was reduced from 90 ° to 45 °, then the optimum Cp was improved from about 0. 7 to 0. 5. (c) Because of Cp＜ 1, hovering power is smaller than the power of ideal plenum chamber type A. C.,(Pt=Pc), so, in this range of Cp, the <b>peripheral</b> <b>Jet</b> type A. C. is superior.

40|$|A {{synoptic}} study c 8 {{number of}} hurricanes {{at the time}} of landfall is described with particular re. _rence to the thermal and wind structure in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. It is shown that the low pressure core of the mature hurricane, before recurvature, extends not only throughout the troposphere but sometimes protrudes into the lower stratosphere up to about 27 km., the upper limit of this investigation. The upper core is found to be cold above 15 km. with temperatures occasionally 8 "- 10 " C. below normal at the tropopause level. A peripheral ridge and a <b>peripheral</b> <b>jet</b> in the upper troposphere are dcscribed, and the possible role of thesc features, {{as well as of the}} cold core, in the hurricane mechanism is discussed. It is suggested that the cold core may be caused by forced ascent above the well-known warm core of the hurricane. It is also shown that a hurricane which has recurved and becomc embedded in the extratropical westerlies may not have an upper cold core and its structure closely corresponds to the classical model. Tentative schematic models of the distribution of temperature and height anomalies are indicated in the case of a mature hurricane before recurvature. 1.

40|$|The slender {{wings and}} bodies {{suitable}} for supersonic flight have, in general, relatively poor aerodynamic characteristics especially at lay speeds. In {{order to improve}} their performance the use of edge blowing has been explored. In this scheme high velocity air jets {{in the form of}} thin sheets are used to fix separation lines on the wing or body and to favourably influence the external stream. Thus the equivalent wing, called here the "Jet Wing” is composed of the wing-body itself plus the extended curved jet sheets which spring from its edges. A limited use of edge jets has been proposed in the 'Jet Flap' concept but the efficiency of this device fails off with decreasing aspect-ratio and the problem of trimming could be severe as most of the increased lift is generated near the trailing edge. At very law aspect-ratios a considerable part of the lift is contributed by the leading-edge vortices which dominate the flow field at moderate incidence. It follows therefore that leading edge blowing is particularly useful for small aspect-ratio wings and the trimming problem can be avoided by a suitable jet arrangement which does not disturb the conical nature of the flow. When sufficiently large auxiliary thrusts are available <b>peripheral</b> <b>jet</b> sheets can be deflected downwards close to the ground, the air craft becoming a Ground-Effect-Machine, with substantial reductions in both take-off and landing speeds and distances...|$|E
40|$|The {{high-pressure}} {{carbon monoxide}} (HiPco) process, developed at Rice University, {{has been reported}} to produce single-walled carbon nanotubes from gas-phase reactions of iron carbonyl in carbon monoxide at high pressures (10 - 100 atm). Computational modeling is used here to develop an understanding of the HiPco process. A detailed kinetic model of the HiPco process that includes of the precursor, decomposition metal cluster formation and growth, and carbon nanotube growth was developed in the previous article (Part I). Decomposition of precursor molecules is necessary to initiate metal cluster formation. The metal clusters serve as catalysts for carbon nanotube growth. The diameter of metal clusters and number of atoms in these clusters are some of the essential information for predicting carbon nanotube formation and growth, which is then modeled by the Boudouard reaction with metal catalysts. Based on the detailed model simulations, a reduced kinetic model was also developed in Part I for use in reactor-scale flowfield calculations. Here this reduced kinetic model is integrated with a two-dimensional axisymmetric reactor flow model to predict reactor performance. Carbon nanotube growth is examined with respect to several process variables (<b>peripheral</b> <b>jet</b> temperature, reactor pressure, and Fe(CO) 5 concentration) {{with the use of the}} axisymmetric model, and the computed results are compared with existing experimental data.
