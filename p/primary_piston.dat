5000|$|A {{reservoir}} above each {{master cylinder}} supplies the master cylinder with enough brake fluid to avoid air {{from entering the}} master cylinder (even the typical clutch uses brake fluid, {{but it may also}} be referred to as [...] "clutch fluid" [...] in a clutch applr). Each piston in a master cylinder operates a brake circuit, and for modern light trucks and passenger cars, usually a brake circuit leads to a brake caliper or shoe on only two of the vehicle's wheels, and the other brake circuit provides brake-pressure to slow down and stop the other two wheels. This is done in a diagonally split hydraulic system. If there is a hydraulic failure in the brake lines served by the master cylinder's secondary piston both pistons will move forward when the brakes are applied, but there is nothing to resist piston travel except the secondary piston spring. This lets the <b>primary</b> <b>piston</b> build up only a small amount of pressure until the secondary piston bottoms in the cylinder bore. Then the <b>primary</b> <b>piston</b> will build enough hydraulic pressure to operate the brakes served by this half of the system. In case of a hydraulic failure in the brake system served by the <b>primary</b> <b>piston,</b> the <b>primary</b> <b>piston</b> will move forward when the brakes are applied but will not build up hydraulic pressure. In this case very little force is transferred to the secondary piston through the <b>primary</b> <b>piston</b> spring until the piston extension screw comes in contact with the secondary piston. Then, pushrod force is transmitted directly to the secondary piston and enough pressure is built up to operate its brakes. Usually the 2 systems are split into left front and right rear comprising one system and right front and left rear comprising the other system. For safety, this is done so that usually only two wheels lose their braking ability {{at the same time and}} that both sides of the car have at least one braking system working and both ends of the car have at least one system working. With only 1 system working there is longer stopping distances and repairs should be done before driving again.|$|E

This study aims to study the propagation of uncertainty from <b>primary</b> standard <b>piston</b> cylinder assembly (PCA) up to 500 MPa. The hierarchy of pressure measurements at NIS is based on using large effective area PCA in defining the pressure of 1 MPa. Characterization of primary standard PCA is presented transferring the obtained results to other level pressure standard described. Uncertainty calculation method at each level was studied.

The pressure inside of the {{master cylinder}} is created by a <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>piston.</b> These are pushed by the output rod of the vacuum booster to compress fluid within its primary and secondary chambers (hydraulic pressure). The hydraulic pressure is translated through the brake lines to the brake calipers.

5000|$|The first {{examples}} of a gas turbine engine design ever considered for armoured fighting vehicles, the BMW 003-based GT 101, were tested in Nazi Germany's Panther tanks in mid-1944.The first true turboshaft engine for helicopters was built by the French engine firm Turbomeca, led by the founder, Joseph Szydlowski. In 1948, they built the first French-designed turbine engine, the 100-shp 782. Originally conceived as an auxiliary power unit, it was soon adapted to aircraft propulsion, and found a niche as a powerplant for turboshaft-driven helicopters in the 1950s. In 1950, this work was used to develop the larger 280-shp Artouste, which was widely used on the Aérospatiale Alouette II and other helicopters. This was following the experimental installation of a Boeing T50 turboshaft in {{an example of the}} Kaman K-225 synchropter on December 11, 1951, as the world's first-ever turboshaft-powered helicopter of any type to fly. The T-80 tank entered service with the Soviet Army in 1976, that was the first tank using gas turbine for the main engine. Since 1980 the US Army has operated the M1 Abrams tank. Designed and built in the late 1970s, this tank makes use of a gas turbine engine compared to most tanks using reciprocating diesels. The engine has considerably fewer parts, mechanically is very reliable, produces reduced exterior noise, and runs on virtually any fuel: petrol (gasoline), diesel fuel, aviation fuels. Similarly, the Swedish Stridsvagn 103 was the first tank to utilize a gas turbine, in this case as a secondary, high-horsepower [...] "sprint" [...] engine to augment the <b>primary</b> <b>piston</b> engine's performance.|$|E

The boost nozzle is retained by latched pistons that are mechanically secured until released by chamber pressure, which simultaneously assumes retention of the nozzle by holding the <b>primary</b> <b>piston</b> in place.

This allows the primary to be more flexible, the adaptive element to be smaller, and the supporting structure to be cheaper than if all correction were performed at a stiffly supported <b>primary.</b> <b>Piston,</b> tilt, and decenter errors of an annulus of the primary and the equations for the required corrections are considered. To verify these, the perturbations with spline functions in the lens design program are simulated. Strehl ratios used to measure image quality show that a piston error of 1 mm is fully corrected over a 5 arcmin field for an f/ 10 system with a 0. 7 n. a. primary at 30 micrometers. Limits of correction are also shown for tilt and decenter errors of segments. Tolerances are given for tilt and decenter errors of the remaining optics also...|$|E
40|$|The {{studies of}} engine {{components}} reveal {{the cause for}} the engine vibration and noise. The piston slap due {{to the impact of}} the piston in the walls of the cylinder is considered as one of the predominant source of engine noise. In the present work engine performance characteristics are considered. The variation of the torque from minimum to maximum and the corresponding values of the engine performance parameters are logged. The effect of torque on engine speed and on piston movement is studied. The duration of the piston in cylinder for these input values ore also logged. The piston lateral movement is recorded by measuring the gap between cylinder inner wall and the piston skirt for the <b>piston</b> <b>primary</b> motion from TDC to BDC and vice versa. Finite element analysis is carried for von-Mises stress and x-directional displacement for the lateral displacement. The high stress region in the piston is emphasized for the study. It is found that near TDC region the engine is experiencing the maximum impact due to high torque which is the result of combustion pressure and also corresponds to the cause for piston lateral motion in this region.

40|$|Expansion {{tubes are}} {{important}} facilities {{for the study}} of high enthalpy hypersonic flows which avoid the non-equilibrium chemical and thermal effects associated with the flow stagnation intrinsic to reflected shock tunnels. X 3 {{is one of the largest}} freepiston super-orbital expansion tube in the world with an overall length of approximately 69 m and is capable of generating reentry speed flows equivalent to those experienced during a hyperbolic re-entry trajectory. It was originally built with a twostage free-piston driver to achieve the high compression ratio of a large diameter compression tube without the high construction costs of designing the large diameter tube to be strong enough to resist peak driver pressure loads. However, this arrangement proved difficult in operation. This paper describes the upgrades to X 3, in respect to its physical layout. The facility has been recommissioned to incorporate a single-piston driver, a steady expansion nozzle and a new test section. Major changes have been made to the free-piston driver with a re-designed piston and launcher and a new end cap tube which is 200 mm thick to contain driver pressures up to 80 MPa. The re-designed piston introduces an area change at the primary diaphragm, ensuring that the maximum increase in total pressure and temperature can be gained as the driver gas undergoes unsteady expansion from sonic to supersonic conditions. The compression process steadily increases up to Mach 1 at the throat then gains of up to an order of magnitude in total temperature and pressure can be realised as the unsteady expansion process takes over. The area change will also increase test times; with a throat at the <b>primary</b> diaphragm, the <b>piston</b> mechanics can be more readily tuned to minimise reflection of waves off the piston which would otherwise reduce the test time. A new Mach 10 steady expansion nozzle has been developed which has increased the core flow and the test time for appropriate conditions. The dump tank has been replaced with a larger tank and test section giving a larger volume with greater potential for instrumentation...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} {{and limitations of}} the Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) engine concept has been experimentally investigated. The operation range, in terms of usable air/fuel ratio and engine load, and the emission characteristics have been studied. An 1. 6 litre single cylinder engine based on a heavy duty six cylinder Volvo, {{was used for the}} tests. As follows the experimental work was limited to study HCCI combustion at low speed operation in a heavy duty sized engine. The HCCI combustion process is very different compared to the Spark Ignition and Compression Ignition (Diesel) combustion processes. HCCI lacks normal flame propagation, instead the entire charge is gradually consumed in a non-flame mode almost at the same time. As almost the entire charge is involved in the combustion process at the same time, the global heat release rate is primary determined by the local heat release rate. This means that the heat release rate is controlled by the grade of charge dilution. Normally, the entire charge is consumed in 5 – 20 crank angle degrees. Due to its nature, HCCI has the potential to generate very low emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx). It is possible to operate the engine with almost zero NOx. The reason for the low NOx potential is that the HCCI concept has the capability to use ultra lean premixed mixtures, resulting in a low and uniform combustion temperature in the combustion chamber. The emissions of unburned hydrocarbons (HC) proved to be two to three times higher compared to spark ignition operation for a given engine load. The main source of unburned hydrocarbons are crevices, <b>primary</b> the <b>piston</b> topland crevice. Wall effects and bulk quenching proved to be less important. If the total crevice volume is minimized and the engine is operated rich enough, say below lambda = 2. 5, very low HC levels are possible to obtain. The emission of carbon monoxide (CO) is very dependent on the temperature history during the combustion period. Close to the rich limit and/or with early timing, CO is quite low, lower than for SI operation. HCCI combustion can be considered as smokeless when using high volatility fuels (light fuels like gasoline). With heavier fuels, like diesel fuel, smoke is very sensitive to the mixture preparation. With port injection of diesel fuel very much smoke was generated in some cases. The combination of low charge temperature and port injection of diesel fuel, resulted in smoke levels of 1 – 4 BSN units. The HCCI engine concept has superior potential for achieving high part load fuel conversion efficiency. This is due to the combination of small pumping losses, high compression ratio and short combustion period. With the present test engine, the best obtained indicated efficiency at part load conditions was about 45 %. The requirement of highly diluted mixtures limits the attainable engine load. With the present test engine the maximum IMEP was around 5 bar at unthrottled operation (naturally aspirated). However, by applying supercharging via an external air compressor, 16 bar of IMEP has been obtained. Besides the limited power density, the lack of direct ignition timing control is maybe the major disadvantage of the HCCI concept. A feedback signal from some sort of combustion sensor is necessary in order to contol the ignition timing via an indirect method. Possible control strategies are through Variable Compression Ratio (VCR), dual fuels or internal EGR. Turbulence and combustion chamber geometry proved {{to play an important role}} for HCCI combustion. Higher turbulence resultet in reduced heat release rate...|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} the Independent Orbiter Assessment (IOA) of the Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) and Critical Items List (CIL) are presented. The IOA {{approach}} features a top-down analysis of the hardware to determine failure modes, criticality, and potential critical items. To preserve independence, this analysis was accomplished without reliance upon the results contained within the NASA FMEA/CIL documentation. The independent analysis results for the Ascent Thrust Vector Control (ATVC) Actuator hardware are documented. The function of the Ascent Thrust Vector Control Actuators (ATVC) is to gimbal the main engines to provide for attitude and flight path control during ascent. During first stage flight, the SRB nozzles provide nearly all the steering. After SRB separation, the Orbiter is steered by gimbaling of its main engines. There are six electrohydraulic servoactuators, one pitch and one yaw {{for each of the}} three main engines. Each servoactuator is composed of four electrohydraulic servovalve assemblies, one second stage power spool valve assembly, one <b>primary</b> <b>piston</b> assembly and a switching valve. Each level of hardware was evaluated and analyzed for possible failure modes and effects. Criticality was assigned based upon the severity of the effect for each failure mode. Critical failures resulting in loss of ATVC were mainly due to loss of hydraulic fluid, fluid contamination and mechanical failures...|$|E
40|$|Exposure to hand-transmitted {{vibration}} (HTV) {{arising from}} hand power tools {{has long been}} associated with several disorders of the hand and arm, which are collectively termed as hand-arm vibration syndrome (HAVS). Owing to high prevalence of HAVS among the operators of the power tools, particularly the percussive tools, the desire to develop low vibration tool designs, has been widely recognized. The design of vibration isolators or assessment of vibration performance of tools necessitates development of dynamic model of the tool coupled {{with that of the}} hand-arm system (HAS) to account for energy absorption within the HAS. This dissertation research is aimed at development of dynamic model of a percussive chipping hammer together with a biomechanical model of the hand-arm system. The model could serve as an essential tool for identifying effective vibration attenuation design features. The dynamic model of the tool is formulated considering identifications of various component contact pairs and the air flows between the <b>primary</b> <b>piston</b> and the striker. A tool tip-workpiece contact model is integrated to the tool model to describe the interactions between the tool and an energy dissipator. A biomechanical model of the hand-arm system is implemented to the tool model to develop a coupled hand-tool system, which could be applied to determine the hand vibration responses {{as a function of the}} push force. The properties of different impact pairs are identified from the theory of visco-elastic collision between rigid bodies. The validity of the hand-tool model is examined on the basis of available measured data under selected levels of the hand push force. A simple model of an anti-vibration glove is further introduced to study its effectiveness in limiting the vibration exposure. The simulation results show that the percussive tool model coupled with the biomechanical hand-arm model can yield reasonably good trends in view of the hand-transmitted vibration. The results suggest that the tool vibration transmitted to the hand is more sensitive to variations in push force and the operating speed. Slight increases in the diameter of the upper chamber orifices and the weight of the tool body, together with lower the striker mass, could yield notable reductions in the magnitudes of vibration transmitted to the hand-arm system. The results further show that the anti-vibration gloves yield very minimal vibration attenuation. ...|$|E
