50|$|The {{chromium}} {{extracted from}} chromite {{is used in}} chrome plating and alloying for production of corrosion resistant superalloys, nichrome, and stainless steel.

50|$|The Great Depression {{significantly}} reduced the demand <b>for</b> <b>pigmented</b> structural <b>glass.</b> American production reached only 1000000 sq ft in 1933. By the 1950s, changing architectural tastes had vastly reduced {{the demand for}} the product. The last two American manufacturers ceased production about 1960: Libbey-Owens-Ford shut down its pigmented structural glass plant in 1958, followed by Pittsburgh Plate Glass in the early 1960s. Production continued in the United Kingdom until 1968, and in Bavaria, Germany, {{until the end of}} the 20th century.|$|R
50|$|Marrietta Manufacturing {{originally}} marketed pigmented {{structural glass}} as a lining for refrigerators. Industrial consumers quickly found new {{uses for the}} product as countertops, dados, bathroom partitions, storefront signs, and tabletops. By the early 1920s, it was advertised as an inexpensive alternative to marble or ceramic tile. The Art Deco and Steamline Moderne architectural movements vastly increased the market <b>for</b> <b>pigmented</b> structural <b>glass.</b> Its first important architectural use came in 1912, when it was used for bathroom stall partitions and dados in the Woolworth Building in New York City. By 1929, 5000000 sq ft of pigmented structural glass was being manufactured in the United States. Throughout the 1930s, the product also found a use as cladding for storefronts, entryways, lobbies, and even as ceiling material. It {{was seen as an}} inexpensive means of making a dated building look modern.|$|R
5000|$|Pigmented {{structural}} glass was originally marketed {{under the name}} [...] "Sani Onyx" [...] by Marrietta Manufacturing. The company also used the name [...] "Sani Rox", while the term [...] "vitreous marble" [...] was coined by the firm as a general descriptive. By 1906, the Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company had developed its own pigmented {{structural glass}}, which it called [...] "Carrara glass". The same year, the Penn-American Plate Company began making a pigmented structural glass which it called [...] "Novus Sanitary Structural Glass". In 1916, The Vitrolite Company began manufacturing the product under the name [...] "Vitrolite", which eventually became a generic name <b>for</b> <b>pigmented</b> structural <b>glass.</b> In time, about eight American firms made pigmented structural glass, although Carrara glass and Vitrolite dominated the market. Names used by these and other companies to market the product included [...] "Argentine", [...] "Glastone", [...] "Marbrunite", [...] "Nuralite", and [...] "Opalite". Pigmented structural glass was manufactured by Pilkington Brothers in the United Kingdom.|$|R

25|$|Lead tetraoxide is {{most often}} used as a <b>pigment</b> <b>for</b> primer paints for iron objects. Due to its toxicity, its use is being limited.

50|$|Malayaite has {{excellent}} {{thermal properties}} and stability making its host lattice ideal for ceramic pigmentation unlike its analogous mineral, titanite that undergoes phase transition {{at a higher}} temperature. This makes chromium-doped malayaite very desirable as it provides a consistent <b>pigment</b> <b>for</b> ceramics. Malayaite contains the element tin which is sometimes doped with chromium or nickel. These chromophore elements allows the mineral to produce different pigmentation. If malayaite is chromium-doped, it produces a pink-red color while with nickel, it produces a purple color. Pink chromium-doped malayaite Ca(Sn,Cr)SiO5 is among a few important minerals used in producing <b>pigments</b> <b>for</b> the ceramic industry, specifically for coloring glazes as it produces a resilient color.|$|R
