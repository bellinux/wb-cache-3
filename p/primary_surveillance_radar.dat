A radome containing <b>Primary</b> <b>Surveillance</b> <b>radar</b> (PSR) and Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR) antennae, various towers and fencing crown the summit.

50|$|Radar {{directly}} {{measures the}} range and bearing of an aircraft from a ground-based antenna. The <b>primary</b> <b>surveillance</b> <b>radar</b> is usually a pulse radar. It transmits a continuous high power sequence of pulses. Bearing {{is measured by the}} position of the rotating radar antenna when it receives the reflected beam that comes from the body aircraft; and range is measured by the time it takes for the radar to receive the reflected beam.|$|E
50|$|A Primary radar (PSR <b>Primary</b> <b>Surveillance</b> <b>Radar)</b> is a {{conventional}} radar sensor that illuminates {{a large portion}} of space with an electromagnetic wave and receives back the reflected waves from targets within that space. The term thus refers to a radar system used to detect and localize potentially non-cooperative targets. It is specific to the field of air traffic control where it is opposed to the secondary radar which receives additional information from the target's transponder.|$|E

A migration to dependent cooperative surveillance (based on ADS-B) combined with Cooperative Independent Surveillance such as SSR Mode-S and/or Wide Area Multilateration.

50|$|<b>Primary</b> <b>surveillance</b> <b>radar</b> {{does not}} require any {{cooperation}} from the aircraft. It is robust {{in the sense that}} surveillance outage failure modes are limited to those associated with the ground radar system. Secondary surveillance radar depends on active replies from the aircraft. Its failure modes include the transponder aboard the aircraft. Typical ADS-B aircraft installations use the output of the navigation unit for navigation and for cooperative surveillance, introducing a common failure mode that must be accommodated in air traffic surveillance systems.|$|E
5000|$|The system {{consists}} of transponders, installed in aircraft, and secondary surveillance radars (SSRs), installed at {{air traffic control}} facilities. The SSR is sometimes co-located with the <b>primary</b> <b>surveillance</b> <b>radar,</b> or PSR. These two radar systems work in conjunction to produce a synchronized surveillance picture. The SSR transmits interrogations and listens for any replies. Transponders that receive an interrogation decode it, decide whether to reply, and then respond with the requested information when appropriate. Note that in common informal usage, the term [...] "SSR" [...] is sometimes {{used to refer to}} the entire ATCRBS system, however this term (as found in technical publications) properly refers only to the ground radar itself.|$|E
5000|$|Today other radars {{share the}} spacetracking duties, but the AN/FPS-85 {{is still the}} <b>primary</b> <b>surveillance</b> <b>radar</b> in the US Space Surveillance Network due to its high power and good coverage, {{reportedly}} handling 30% of the SSN workload. The Air Force claims {{it is the only}} phased array radar that can track spacecraft in deep space, can detect an object the size of a basketball out to geosynchronous orbit, 35,700 km in space, and is the most powerful radar in the world. [...] However its aging legacy technology, which uses vacuum tubes, gives it high maintenance costs. [...] Its maintenance crew must repair an average of 17 of its 5000 modular transmitter units daily, at an annual cost of $2 million.|$|E
5000|$|An airport <b>surveillance</b> <b>radar</b> (ASR) is a {{radar system}} used at {{airports}} {{to detect and}} display the presence and position of aircraft in the terminal area, the airspace around airports. It is the main {{air traffic control system}} for the airspace around airports. At large airports it typically controls traffic within a radius of 60 miles (96 km) of the airport. The sophisticated systems at large airports consist of two different radar systems, the <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>surveillance</b> <b>radar.</b> [...] The <b>primary</b> radar typically consists of a large rotating parabolic antenna dish that sweeps a vertical fan-shaped beam of microwaves around the airspace surrounding the airport. It detects the position and range of aircraft by microwaves reflected back to the antenna from the aircraft's surface. In the US the primary radar operates at a frequency of 2.7 - 2.9 GHz in the S band with a peak radiated power of 25 kW and an average power of 2.1 kW. The secondary <b>surveillance</b> <b>radar</b> consists of a second rotating antenna, often mounted on the primary antenna, which interrogates the transponders of aircraft, which transmits a radio signal back containing the aircraft's identification, barometric altitude, and an emergency status code, which is displayed on the radar screen next to the return from the primary radar. [...] It operates at a frequency of 1.03 - 1.09 GHz in the L band with peak power of 160 - 1500 W.|$|R
40|$|The current Federal Radio Navigation Plan {{presents}} {{a plan that}} includes phasing out of existing radio-navigation aids {{as part of the}} transition to sole-means-GPS navigation in the United States. GPS based systems are also being envisioned as becoming the primary means of air traffic control resulting in the retirement of older <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>surveillance</b> <b>radar</b> (SSR) systems. This paper discusses the use of existing radio-navigation aids to provide a redundant navigation system alongside GPS/WAAS during the transition to a sole means GPS national airspace system. Specifically, the paper examines three such systems based on existing equipment such as Distance Measuring Equipment (DME), the Traffic and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) and LORAN. The predicted performance of these systems can be used to determine the number of the existing radionavigation aids that should be left in place to provide adequate navigation services during the transition to solemeans -GPS navigation.

5000|$|An ATC {{ground station}} {{consists}} of two radar systems and their associated support components. The most prominent component is the PSR. It is {{also referred to as}} skin paint radar because it shows not synthetic or alpha-numeric target symbols, but bright (or colored) blips or areas on the radar screen produced by the RF energy reflections from the target's [...] "skin." [...] This is a non-cooperative process, no additional avionic devices are needed. The radar detects and displays reflective objects within the radar's operating range. Weather radar data is displayed in skin paint mode. The <b>primary</b> <b>surveillance</b> <b>radar</b> is subject to the radar equation that says signal strength drops off as the fourth power of distance to the target. Objects detected using the PSR are known as primary targets.|$|E
