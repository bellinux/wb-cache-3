40|$|Objective The study aims to {{evaluate}} {{the presence of a}} correlation between visceral fat assessed by ultrasonography and the <b>plasmatic</b> <b>level</b> of lipocalin in patients diagnosed with endometrial cancer. Material and Method The study is a case-control analysis including 2 groups of patients: group I – 44 patients diagnosed with endometrial cancer, group II – 44 patients without gynecological pathology or inflammatory disorders. After the clinical examination and anthropometric measurements, these patients underwent ultrasonography (US) examination, in view of determining the visceral fat. At the patients included in this study, we also determined the plasmatic levels for lipocalin. Results At the patients diagnosed with endometrial cancer, the intraabdominal fat area evaluated by US and the <b>plasmatic</b> <b>level</b> of lipocalin is significantly larger (p< 0. 0001) compared to the control group. A correlation was also found between the intraperitoneal fat area evaluated by US and the <b>plasmatic</b> <b>level</b> of lipocalin. Conclusions The measurement of the intraperitoneal fat by US in correlation with the <b>plasmatic</b> <b>level</b> of lipocalin can be a screening method for endometrial cancer in obese patients...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Reactive {{oxygen species}} (ROS) {{have been shown}} {{to play a role in}} the {{pathophysiology}} of sepsis. The aim of this study was to investigate ROS production over time in critically ill with sepsis patients and its correlation with outcome. METHODS: This was a pilot single-centre prospective, observational study of patients consecutively admitted to our 18 - general ICU. Over a period of 6 months all the consecutive patients with recent-onset of severe sepsis or septic shock were enrolled. Clinical and demographic characteristics of all patients were recorded. ROMs (ROS metabolites), reduced sulfhydryl groups (SH) and <b>plasmatic</b> lactate <b>levels</b> were collected at enrollment in the study and then every 5 - 7 days over 28 days or until sepsis resolution or death during sepsis. ROMs were analysed spectrophotometrically by the d-ROMs test (Diacron-Italia). SH were assayed in plasma by Ellman's reaction by spectrophotometric method. Septic shock-related mortality was defined as death that occurred during the follow up period, when the signs of shock remained, and death could not be attributed to causes other than septic shock by the attending physician. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients were studied. The SOFA score and the <b>plasmatic</b> lactate <b>levels</b> significantly correlated with the ROMs <b>plasmatic</b> <b>levels.</b> The mortality rate was higher in patients whose ROMs <b>plasmatic</b> <b>levels</b> decreased during septic shock evolution.

40|$|Severe chronic {{kidney disease}} may lead to disturbances, such as hyperphosphatemia, {{increased}} secretion of fibroblast growth factor - 23 (FGF - 23) and vitamin D deficiency. These may increase <b>plasmatic</b> <b>levels</b> of parathyroid hormone, and decrease <b>plasmatic</b> <b>levels</b> of calcium. Altogether, these {{may contribute to the}} development of secondary hyperparathyroidism, and to abnormalities in mineral metabolism. Kidney transplantation is the best option to improve longevity and quality of life in end -stage {{chronic kidney disease}} patients. Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with cardiovascular disease, which is the leading cause of death in chronic kidney disease. Therefore, diagnosing this deficiency may be pivotal for minimizing mortality in chronic kidney disease, because pharmacological treatments for this deficiency may be prescribed. Calcitriol is indicated for the treatment of vitamin D deficiency, both in chronic kidney disease and in kidney transplanted patients. However, calcitriol may increase the <b>plasmatic</b> <b>levels</b> of calcium and phosphorous, which can lead to vascular calcifications, that have been associated with cardiovascular mortality. Selective vitamin D receptor activators are indicated for the treatment of vitamin D deficiency in chronic kidney disease. These have the advantage of being associated with lower increases of <b>plasmatic</b> <b>levels</b> of calcium and phosphorous. These drugs also seem to have additional effects that may minimise patient morbidity and mortality, especially due to potentially reducing cardiovascular events. Unfortunately, there are few studies about the use of these drugs in kidney transplanted patients. Here we present a review about the physiology of vitamin D, the consequences of its deficiency in chronic kidney disease and in kidney transplanted patients, and about the diagnosis and treatment of this deficiency. Finally, we discuss the new line of research about the efficacy and safety of selective vitamin D receptor activators in kidney transplanted patients...|$|R

40|$|In many reports Finsterer and Stöllberger {{reported}} a strong association between non compaction {{of the left}} ventricle and neuromuscular disorders. In the same report the authors described a neurological involvement in more than 50 %. Recently we published our personal experience, about 21 paediatric patients: only 4 patients (19 %) showed a neuromuscular disorder, and only 1 of them showed an increased <b>plasmatic</b> <b>level</b> of CK, and in particular of MM isoform, with a normal level of CK-MB.

A correlation between neuromuscular disorders and cardiac non compaction is present, even if, until today, genetic involvement has not been identified clearly. However, in our opinion, an estimated incidence of 50 % of neuromuscular disorders in this population of patients could be too exaggerated. About the prognostic value of the CK elevation, {{it is interesting to}} consider that an increasing of CK <b>plasmatic</b> <b>level</b> is an expression of muscular disorders and not of cardiac alterations.

40|$|Summary Introduction: {{several studies}} have {{evaluated}} the utilization of lipid biomarkers {{in an attempt to}} correlate them with clinical cardiovascular events. Nevertheless, the investigation of clinical conditions under specific <b>plasmatic</b> <b>levels</b> of lipoproteins for long periods presents limitations due to inherent difficulties that are related to the follow-up of individuals throughout their lives. Better understanding of the clinical response and occasional resistance to the action of hypolipidemic drugs in several clinic scenarios is also necessary. Objectives: to determine the role of evaluation of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) related to the metabolism of lipids, and its implications in different clinical scenarios. Methods: a search of the literature in English and Spanish languages was performed in Medline, Lilacs via Bireme, IBECS via Bireme, and Cochrane databases. The expected results included information regarding plasmatic lipid profile and SNPs, cardiovascular clinical outcomes and polymorphisms related to the effectiveness of statins in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. Results: in order to perform this analysis, 19 studies were included from a total of 89 identified citations. The evaluation of the results suggests that low <b>plasmatic</b> <b>levels</b> of LDL-c are associated with a reduction in the risk of heart attacks, although this was not observed for the rise of <b>plasmatic</b> <b>levels</b> of HDL-c. Conclusion: polymorphisms in different populations and clinical perspectives may bring important contributions for a better understanding and adequacy of plasmatic lipoproteins aiming at reducing cardiovascular risk...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAccording {{to several}} lines of evidence, natriuretic {{peptides}} (NP) {{are the main}} components of a cardiac-renal axis that operate in clinical conditions of decreased cardiac hemodynamic tolerance to regulate sodium homeostasis, blood pressure and vascular function. Even though {{it is reasonable to assume}} that NP may exert a relevant role in the adaptive response to renal mass ablation, evidence gathered so far suggest that this contribution is probably complex and dependent on the type and degree of the functional mass loss. In the last years NP have been increasingly used to diagnose, monitor treatment and define the prognosis of several cardiovascular (CV) diseases. However, in many clinical settings, like chronic kidney disease (CKD), the predictive value of these biomarkers has been questioned. In fact, it is now well established that renal function significantly affects the <b>plasmatic</b> <b>levels</b> of NP and that renal failure is the clinical condition associated with the highest <b>plasmatic</b> <b>levels</b> of these peptides. The complexity of the relation between NP <b>plasmatic</b> <b>levels</b> and CV and renal functions has obvious consequences, as it may limit the predictive value of NP in CV assessment of CKD patients and be a demanding exercise for clinicians involved in the daily management of these patients. This review describes the role of NP in the regulatory response to renal function loss and addresses the main factors involved in the clinical valorization of the peptides in the context of significant renal failure...|$|R

In sheep {{as in many}} vertebrates, the {{seasonal}} pattern of reproduction is timed by the annual photoperiodic cycle, characterized by seasonal changes in the daylength. The photoperiodic information is translated into a circadian profile of melatonin secretion. After multiple neuronal relays (within the hypothalamus), melatonin impacts GnRH (gonadotrophin releasing hormone) secretion that in turn controls ovarian cyclicity. The pattern of GnRH secretion is mirrored into that of LH (luteinizing hormone) secretion, whose <b>plasmatic</b> <b>level</b> can be easily measured. We addressed {{the question of whether}} there exists an endogenous circannual rhythm in a tropical sheep (Black-belly) population that exhibits clear seasonal ovarian activity when ewes are subjected to temperate latitudes. We based our analysis on LH time series collected in the course of 3 years from ewes subjected to a constant photoperiodic regime. Due to intra- and inter- animal variability and unequal sampling times, the existence of an endogenous rhythm is not straightforward. We have used time-frequency signal processing methods, and especially the Smooth Pseudo-Wigner-Ville Distribution, to extract possible hidden rhythms from the data. To further investigate the LF (low frequency) and HF (high frequency) components of the signals, we have designed a simple mathematical model of LH <b>plasmatic</b> <b>level</b> accounting for the effect of experimental sampling times. The model enables us (i) to confirm the existence of an endogenous circannual rhythm as detected by the LF signal component, (ii) to investigate the action mechanism of photoperiod on the pulsatile pattern of LH secretion (control of the interpulse interval) and (iii) to conclude that the HF component is mainly due to the experimental sampling protocol...|$|E

Recent investigations have demonstrated that low <b>plasmatic</b> <b>levels</b> of natriuretic peptides are linked with obesity. Thus, knowing the actions of these hormones in water and salt homeostasis, {{it is possible to}} establish that low levels of natriuretic peptides may be the common denominator among obesity, {{hypertension and}} heart failure. Knowledge on this topic is crucial to develop further investigation for definitive conclusions...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} preliminarily {{and compare}} the <b>level</b> of <b>plasmatic</b> biomarkers of vascular risk in patients with and without exudative age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) and to relate it to vascular resistance alterations in the ophthalmic artery (OA), central retinal artery (CRA), posterior temporal ciliary artery (PTCA), and posterior nasal ciliary artery (PNCA). Methods: Color Doppler imaging of the OA, CRA, PTCA, and PNCA was performed in 30 eyes of 30 cataract patients (control group) {{as well as in}} 30 eyes of 30 patients with naive exudative ARMD (study group), measuring the peak systolic velocity, end-diastolic velocity (EDV), and Pourcelot resistive index (RI). Likewise, in both groups, a blood test was performed to determine the <b>plasmatic</b> <b>levels</b> of homocysteine, C-reactive protein (CRP), B 12 vitamin, and folic acid. Results: A positive and significant correlation was found between the level of CRP and RI of the OA in the ARMD group (r = 0. 498, P = 0. 005), with an increased RI in all arteries compared to controls, although differences only reached statistical significance for the PTCA (P = 0. 035). Likewise, a significantly lower EDV for the CRA was found in ARMD eyes compared to controls (P = 0. 041). In the study group, significantly higher <b>plasmatic</b> <b>levels</b> of homocysteine (P = 0. 042) and CRP (P = 0. 046) were found. In contrast, {{no significant differences were found}} between groups in the levels of folic acid (P = 0. 265) and B 12 vitamin (P = 0. 520). Conclusion: The decrease of the choroidal perfusion related to hyperhomocysteinemia, and increase in the CRP <b>plasmatic</b> <b>levels</b> may play an etiological role on the exudative ARMD. This should be investigated in future studies with larger samples of patients. The author J. V.
