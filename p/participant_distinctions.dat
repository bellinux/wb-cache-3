The building design community, broadly construed, appears to remain surprisingly unaware {{of the extent to}} which prescriptive fire safety considerations impact building designs.

This paper presents outcomes from a series of mediated roundtable discussions that occurred during an international seminar aimed at reflecting on the current status of fire safety and fire protection concepts within overall building design processes.

40|$|Modern {{conceptualization}} of autobiographical memory distinguishes between episodic and personal semantic components. In essence, episodic autobiographical memory {{is the system}} that allows conscious reliving of personal experiences, a subjective ability to mentally travel {{back in time and}} recreate the unfolding of a specific event from our past. Recollecting autobiographical events is a reconstructive and subjective process, influenced by multiple factors, including the age and nature of the event and the characteristics of the individual retrieving it. In contrast, personal semantic memory refers to factual information about oneself and in this sense is not event-based. Evidence for the dissociability of episodic and semantic components has been demonstrated in neuropsychological studies of brain damaged patients and functional neuroimaging studies of healthy <b>participants.</b> The <b>distinction</b> is also of central importance in ongoing debates concerning the neural bases of long term memory storage and retrieval. However, complex interactions at all stages of memory formation and retrieval are likely and therefore episodic and semantic memory might best be considered as dimensional rather than independent or discrete systems. The role of autobiographical memory in the formation and continuity of self-identity is an emerging theme. Variability in the validity and sensitivity of autobiographical memory tests remains a major issue which has hampered attempts to resolve conflicting theoretical accounts in the literature...|$|R

Understanding of what constitutes suffering in children admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) is lacking. This study aims to assess perceptions by parents, doctors, and nurses {{of suffering}} in critically ill children. We interviewed 124 participants (parents, physicians, and PICU nurses) caring for 29 admitted children in a 20 -bed level-III PICU and performed a qualitative analysis. We found that most <b>participants</b> made a <b>distinction</b> between physical and existential suffering. Parents considered the child's suffering caused by or associated with visible signs as discomfort. Nurses linked suffering to the child's state of comfort. Physicians linked them to the intensity and impact of treatment and future perspectives of the child. Various aspects of the child's suffering and admission to a PICU caused suffering in parents. Conclusion: Parents', physicians', and nurses' perceptions of suffering overlap but also show important differences. Differences found seem to be rooted in the relation to and kind of responsibility (parental/professional) for the child. The child's illness, suffering, and hospital admission cause suffering in parents. Health-care professionals in PICUs need to be aware of these phenomena...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationships}} among self-labeled sexual orientation, sexual preferences, and sexual behaviors {{were examined in}} samples from Taiwan and the USA. Subsamples matched on gender, age, and marital status were created to reduce sexual orientation cell size discrepancies and demographic differences. Sexual orientation self-label, the Kinsey Scale of Sexual Orientation, and a modified version for preference {{were used to assess}} participants' sexual orientation, behavior, and preference, respectively. Additional measures included an adaptation of the Early Sexual Experiences Checklist, and the Hopkins Symptom Checklist for psychological distress. For both Taiwan and USA subsamples, heterosexual participants reported significantly greater congruence between sexual orientation identity and preference than did nonheterosexual participants. A high proportion of the Taiwan sample were celibate, precluding analyses of congruence between sexual orientation identity and sexual behavior. Congruence between sexual behavior and preference in the USA sample was negatively correlated with psychological distress. In a cross-cultural comparison between the Taiwan and USA women (n = 176), the two samples reported similar congruence between sexual orientation identity and preference. Exploratory analyses revealed that heterosexual participants' sexual orientation label was more &# 8220;public, &# 8221; (more categories of people who knew the participants' sexual orientation), than was nonheterosexuals' in both Taiwan and the USA. In Taiwan, heterosexual and nonheterosexual participants reported similar proportions who were celibate. A gender difference within the USA subsample included that men reported significantly greater congruence than did women regarding sexual orientation identity and congruence between behavior and preference. Analyses comparing self-labeled sexual orientation groups on unwanted childhood sexual experiences and age of earliest voluntary sexual activity were not significant.

40|$|Learners can extract {{transitional}} {{information from}} speech {{and use it}} to infer word boundaries and linguistic regularities. Critically, studies suggest that statistical language learning may benefit from the presence of high-frequency marker words (Bortfeld et al., 2005) that may act as anchors around which speech segmentation can occur, while also assisting with grammatical categorisation (Monaghan & Christiansen, 2010). To address these claims, we familiarised adults with a continuous stream of language comprising sequences of 8 bisyllabic target words, and compared learning to the same language but with high-frequency monosyllabic marker words preceding target words, and distinguishing them into two distributionally-defined categories. Participants completed a 2 AFC testof segmentation, and a similarity judgement categorisation test containing word-pairs from the same versus different categories.

As {{contemporary}} societies are undergoing a demographic change, spurred in great part by international immigration, living in diversity continues {{to remain a}} topical issue. Moving away from the nation, considered as a site of discrimination and exclusion, geographers and social scientist more broadly have focused on alternative socio-spatial formations. Over {{the last two decades}} or so, the local place, particularly the city or the neighbourhood within the city, has attracted considerable attention. Imbued with transnational and cosmopolitan traits, these local places have been narrated as progressive and empowering in contrast to a nation perceived as to embodying opposite dimensions. The present study critically interrogates this local/national divide. Drawing on narratives of Italians with foreign background talking and writing about their individual experiences of living and growing up in Italy, the article offers empirical evidence which challenges the local/national divide in two ways. First, <b>participants</b> blurred the <b>distinction</b> between these two scales, as identification and attachment to local places were narrated by also mobilizing national markers. Second, the sense of local rootedness of the participants was not cast against the nation, but it was strategically deployed to claim a place in the nation.

40|$|Introduction: Non-invasive brain imaging {{techniques}} often contrast experimental conditions across {{a cohort of}} <b>participants,</b> obfuscating <b>distinctions</b> in individual performance and brain mechanisms that are better characterised by the inter-trial variability. To overcome such limitations, we developed topographic analysis methods for single-trial EEG data [1]. So far this was typically based on time-frequency analysis of single-electrode data or single independent components. The method's efficacy is demonstrated for event-related responses to environmental sounds, hitherto studied at an average event-related potential (ERP) level. Methods: Nine healthy subjects participated to the experiment. Auditory meaningful sounds of common objects were used for a target detection task [2]. On each block, {{subjects were asked to}} discriminate target sounds, which were living or man-made auditory objects. Continuous 64 -channel EEG was acquired during the task. Two datasets were considered for each subject including single-trial of the two conditions, living and man-made. The analysis comprised two steps. In the first part, a mixture of Gaussians analysis [3] provided representative topographies for each subject. In the second step, conditional probabilities for each Gaussian provided statistical inference on the structure of these topographies across trials, time, and experimental conditions. Similar analysis was conducted at group-level. Results: Results show that the occurrence of each map is structured in time and consistent across trials both at the single-subject and at group level. Conducting separate analyses of ERPs at single-subject and group levels, we could quantify the consistency of identified topographies and their time course of activation within and across participants as well as experimental conditions. A general agreement was found with previous analysis at average ERP level. Conclusions: This novel approach to single-trial analysis promises to have impact on several domains. In clinical research, it gives the possibility to statistically evaluate single-subject data, an essential tool for analysing patients with specific deficits and impairments and their deviation from normative standards. In cognitive neuroscience, it provides a novel tool for understanding behaviour and brain activity interdependencies at both single-subject and at group levels. In basic neurophysiology, it provides a new representation of ERPs and promises to cast light on the mechanisms of its generation and inter-individual variability...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that social {{comparison}} influences individual’s fairness consideration and other-regarding behavior. However, {{it is not clear how}} social comparison affects the brain activity in evaluating fairness during asset distribution. In this study, participants, acting as recipients in the ultimatum game, were informed not only of offers to themselves but also of the average amount of offers in other allocator-recipient dyads. Behavioral results showed that the participants were more likely to reject division schemes when they were offered less than the other recipients, especially when the offers were highly unequal. Event-related brain potentials (ERPs) recorded from the participants showed that highly unequal offers elicited more negative going medial frontal negativity (MFN) than moderately unequal offers in an early time window (270 - 360 ms) and this effect was not significantly modulated by social comparison. In a later time window (450 - 650 ms), however, the late positive potentials (LPPs) were more positive for moderately unequal offers than for highly unequal offers when the other recipients were offered less than the <b>participants,</b> whereas this <b>distinction</b> disappeared when the other recipients were offered the same as or more than the participants. These findings suggest that the brain activity in evaluating fairness in asset division entails both an earlier (semi-) automatic process in which the brain responds to fairness at an abstract level and a later appraisal process in which factors related to social comparison and fairness norms come into play...|$|R

It considers those involved both in terms of age, sex, ethnic and social class characteristics as well as the <b>distinctions</b> <b>participants</b> make of one another in terms of ability, commitment and motivation. These latter differences give rise to discernable groups within the practice that I, and the participants refer to as 'athletes', 'runners' and 'joggers'. It focuses on the 'runners' as the group who comprise the. Bulk of the field in most events, yet have no readily apparent reason for their involvement since they race and train at levels far above those necessary for basic physical fitness, yet are never going to win any race. The virtually unique (amongst physically demanding sports) composition of the field, in that middle class men over thirty predominate, is then linked to the motivations of those involved. Using recent work on 'bodies' and highlighting the importance of gender to identity the study maps more recent social changes (as parts of longer term trends) that may have undermined some of the traditional grounds (some more recent 'traditions' than others) upon which masculine identities have been established. It considers the way these changes may have worked to the relative disadvantage of middle class men the 'wrong' side of thirty more than many. The thesis advanced is that {{at the heart of the}} 'urge to do it on a Sunday morning' for many, is an attempt to 'reclaim' masculinity through a particularly public demonstration of physical prowess, through and from which runners feel they derive the 'respect' and 'admiration' of others.

40|$|This interdisciplinary, {{qualitative}} {{study is the}} first to map the role of spirituality in contemporary art museum education from the educatorâs perspective. The thesis makes an original contribution to a spiritual approach to art museum education by acknowledging an interplay between worldview, core values, educational goals, learning theory, and educational practice. Based on a holistic worldview of the profound interconnectedness of all life, spirituality is proposed as a nonreligious and nonsectarian category concerned with an individualâs experiential journey in search of purpose, meaning, and connectedness with self, others, nature, and the transcendent. The case study that underpins this project focused on three significant groups of educators: art museum educators, high school visual art teachers, and prospective visual art teachers studying at university. Data from qualitative questionnaires and semistructured interviews was triangulated among the groups, to map participantsâ views about spirituality in teaching high school groups visiting art museums. My analysis of the qualitative data revealed that all <b>participants</b> made a <b>distinction</b> between spirituality and religion. However, in their teaching some used spirituality as a transcendental concept, others as nontranscendental. Further, visual art emerged as a secular field particularly well suited to engaging students with existential and spiritual questions. For example, art museum educators described art museums as places of slowing downâreferring to a state of heightened presence and concentration, fruitful for immersive experiences, and for potentially opening to spiritual questions. Another key finding is that all participants were hesitant to embrace a spiritual dimension to art education. One way to encourage more spiritual dialogue would be to clarify the contemporary, secular interpretation of âspiritualâ across art museum education, the visual arts syllabi, and teacher training. Greater clarity may inspire educators to integrate spiritual explorations into art museum education. The study concludes that art museums present a potentially powerful learning environment for young people to engage with reflective and existential questions of self and world. In this context, contemplative pedagogies, including the integration of mindfulness and bodyâmind practices, may provide novel and meaningful strategies to invite young visitors to explore the spiritual...|$|R
40|$|Stroke {{patients}} often {{report an}} increased sense of effort when using their paretic limb. Currently {{there is little}} research investigating this phenomenon and the implications {{that it could have}} for recovery. This study was an exploratory piece of work which combined quantitative and qualitative methods to investigate the role of effort in the recovery of arm function following a stroke. For the study, a new piece of equipment was designed called the assessment of perceived stiffness to provide a measure of effort that was less open to subjective bias than previous studies. In this new approach, stroke patients were asked to subjectively match the force of the grip strength being exerted by the impaired and unimpaired hand and then measures of the actual force being applied were taken using a dynamometer that was attached to the equipment. An interview schedule was also designed to examine stroke participants' experiences of effort and compare them with the performance on the assessment of perceived stiffness. Seventeen participants were recruited for the study and were divided into three groups namely, a stroke participant group, an age-matched control group and a young control group. The stroke participants? performance on the assessment of perceived stiffness was compared with that of the two control groups. The stroke participants? perception of perceived stiffness was then compared with their reports of increased effort in everyday life when they performed a movement task with their recovering arm. Furthermore, the research investigated whether stroke <b>participants</b> make a <b>distinction</b> between physical effort and mental effort. The results from the stroke sample showed that there were differences in their perception of stiffness compared to the control groups. The stroke participants? performance suggests that they were perceiving a greater stiffness on their paretic side when exhibiting the same amount of force on both sides. The results from the interview data demonstrated that the stroke participants who perceive increased stiffness on their paretic side report greater effort in everyday life. Individual differences were demonstrated when stroke participants were asked if they made a distinction between physical effort and mental effort. The results confirm the findings of previous studies and add weight to earlier research that an increased sense of effort is reported during recovery of arm function. Furthermore, this study highlights the need for additional research to investigate this area. The clinical implications of the results and areas for future research are discussed in detail...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} about {{understanding}} the birth, development {{and maintenance of}} a subcultural alternative music scene located in the unique urban socio-historic milieu of the postcolonial developing country of Bangladesh. Locally dubbed the underground, this cultural phenomenon is a youth based male dominated, non-commercial and non-professional music scene, based on international genres of metal {{as well as other}} foreign alternative music genres. This alternative music scene revolves around the activities of largely middle-class, part-time, male musicians who share particular economic, cultural and social resources that afford their participation in it. The main focus of this research is to understand these social, cultural and economic conditions of possibility of the scene that explain why it exists in its current form. Questions about the usefulness and limitations of theoretical frameworks based on alternative rock related youth cultures will be assessed by the empirical study of this local alternative music scene. These theoretical models, largely developed in Western Anglophone countries, explain distinctive configurations of symbolic, social and economic elements through which a particular scene is mobilized. Are these Western theoretical models enough to explain this local alternative music scene, or are local contextual factors of paramount importance? This is one of the notions that are explored in detail in this thesis. In the locale of post-colonial Bangladesh, the actors involved express their sentiments towards local situations with the resources available to them through the motivations of ‘local factors’ which accentuate a rather unique discourse of an alternative music scene. Studies of appropriation, impact and function of metal genres in other Asian countries like China, Japan, Nepal, Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore have been done before, but never in Bangladesh, where there is an overall lacking of music related scholarly work in English. Based upon interviews with key figures of the scene, ethnographic observation and textual analysis, this research suggests that the urban youth’s frustration towards the poor situation of the country is channeled into desires to develop an alternative liberal space of artistic autonomy through the exploration of foreign music styles and the fantasy worlds of metal. While <b>participants</b> assert aesthetic <b>distinction</b> of their music from mainstream rock, one of the main findings shows that they are not concerned about ideas of selling out to the corporate music industry if they become popular without sacrificing aesthetic integrity. Emphasis is placed on translocal connections with other alternative music scenes elsewhere. The empirical findings from this thesis raises questions {{about the extent to which}} this local scene represents Western discourses of alternative rock and whether its transnationalism is properly explained through hybridization of international cultural forms...|$|R
40|$|Multiculturalism as an {{ideology}} to manage culturally diverse societies argues that when cultural group distinctiveness is valued and promoted, positive intergroup relations would ensue (e. g. Modood, 2007; Parekh, 2001). Social psychological research has mainly looked at multiculturalism {{in terms of}} its endorsement by majority and minority group members and its implications for intergroup relations and acculturation processes. However, multiculturalism is not only about the maintenance of ethnic identities and cultures but also about the full participation of all ethno-cultural groups in society. This means that (i) individuals have to make sense of how their collective identities (e. g. ethnic, religious, national) come together and (ii) politically, multicultural societies are about equitable participation and hence inclusion, decision-making and power. The dissertation attempted to contribute to the social psychological literature on multiculturalism by looking at intergroup evaluations and also examine multiple identifications and the evaluations of (group) decision-making. The social identity approach provided the main theoretical framework from which to derive predictions. The studies were carried out in an under-researched social context of the nation as a ‘fruit salad’ (i. e. Mauritius) where multiculturalism is the predominant ideology. Mauritius is often considered as a successful polyethnic society (Eriksen, 2004). Survey data was collected among adolescent participants (age range 11 years to 19 years) of the three main ethnic groups, i. e. Hindus (n = 844), Muslims (n = 630) and Creoles (n = 310). Although the socio-historical context of Mauritius is specific, it provided a real-life equivalence to the theoretical understanding of multiculturalism. The results are thus revealing of the forms that intergroup relations can take when multiculturalism is relatively uncontested. It was found that majority and minority adolescents’ attitudes and views on the different measures were functionally similar: preferred dual identity, positive role of national identification, positive associations between national and ethnic/religious group identifications and public and private domain <b>distinctions.</b> <b>Participants</b> reported greater social distance towards out-groups in the private compared to public domain. A multiculturalism context does not necessarily means ‘group thinking’ on all grounds because across participants, representative democracy was judged as fairer than decision-making procedures that involved group considerations. That cultural groups should be recognised and respected is one thing, but that decisions should be made on a group basis is another matter. The results indicated the primacy for the adolescents of their ethnic and religious identities but these were not to the detriment of their identification with the nation. However, the findings also showed that a ‘cultural diversity’ representation of the nation does not rule out the tendency for in-group projection in terms of prototypicality and indispensability with the related unfavorable consequences for intergroup relations. It seems that in a ‘rainbow’ or ‘fruit salad’ national narrative, all components can claim to be indispensable, can view their sub-group and national identities as compatible and accept that diversity {{is part and parcel of}} public life as long as one knows where to belong...|$|R
