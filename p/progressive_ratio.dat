[...] Animals infected with a viral vector overexpressing miR-212 in the dorsal striatum produced the same initial levels of cocaine intake; however, drug consumption progressively decreased as net cocaine exposure increased. The authors of the study noted that viral-infected animals exhibited decreased operant responding during the post-infusion time-out period and proposed that this demonstrated a reduction in compulsive drug-seeking behavior.(Hollander et al.) miR-212 acts through Raf1 to enhance the CREB response; CREB-TORC is known to negatively regulate the reinforcing effects of cocaine.

50|$|Continuous reinforcement: A single operant {{response}} triggers the dispense {{of a single}} dose of reinforcer. A time-out period may follow each {{operant response}} that successfully yields a dose of reinforcer; during this period the lever used in training may be retracted preventing the animal from making further responses. Alternatively operant responses will fail to produce drug administration allowing previous injections to take effect. Moreover, time-outs also help prevent subjects from overdosing during self-administration experiments. Fixed-ratio studies require a predefined number of operant responses to dispense one unit of reinforcer. Standard fixed ratio reinforcement schedules include FR5 and FR10, requiring 5 and 10 operant responses to dispense a unit of reinforcer, respectively.Progressive ratio reinforcement schedules utilize a multiplicative {{increase in the number}} of operant responses required to dispense a unit of reinforcer. For example, successive trials might require 5 operant responses per unit of reward, then 10 responses per unit of reward, then 15, and so on. The number of operant responses required per unit of reinforcer may be altered after each trial, each session, or any other time period as defined by the experimenter. <b>Progressive</b> <b>ratio</b> reinforcement schedules provide information about the extent that a pharmacological agent is reinforcing through the breakpoint. The breakpoint is the number of operant responses at which the subject ceases engaging in self-administration, defined by some period of time between operant responses (generally up to an hour).Fixed interval (FI) schedules require that a set amount of time pass between drug infusions, regardless of the number of times that the desired response is performed. This “refractory” period can prevent the animal from overdosing on a drug.Variable interval (VI) schedules of reinforcement are identical to FI schedules, except that the amount of time between reinforced operant responses varies, making it more difficult for the animal to predict when the drug will be delivered.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Previous mesh {{compression}} techniques provide decent properties such as {{high compression}} <b>ratio,</b> <b>progressive</b> decoding, and out-of-core processing. However, {{only a few of}} them supports the random accessibility in decoding, which enables the details of any specific part to be available without decoding other parts. This paper proposes an effective framework for the random accessibility of mesh compression. The key component of the framework is a wire-net mesh constructed from a chartification of the given mesh. Charts are compressed separately for random access to mesh parts and a wire-net mesh provides an indexing and stitching structure for the compressed charts. Experimental results show that random accessibility can be achieved with competent compression ratio, which is only a little worse than single-rate and comparable to progressive encoding. To demonstrate the merits of the framework, we apply it to process huge meshes in an out-of-core manner, such as outof-core rendering and out-of-core editing.

40|$|Maternal {{obesity is}} {{becoming}} more prevalent. We used borderline hypertensive rats (BHR) to investigate whether a high-fat diet {{at different stages of}} development has adverse programming consequences on metabolic parameters and blood pressure. Wistar dams were fed a high- or low-fat diet for 6 wk before mating with spontaneously hypertensive males and during the ensuing pregnancy. At birth, litters were fostered to a dam from the same diet group as during gestation or to the alternate diet condition. Female offspring were weaned on either control or “junk food” diets until about 6 mo of age. Rats fed the high-fat junk food diet were hyperphagic relative to their chow-fed controls. The junk food-fed rats were significantly heavier and had greater fat pad mass than those rats maintained on chow alone. Importantly, those rats suckled by high-fat dams had heavier fat pads than those suckled by control diet dams. Fasting serum leptin and insulin levels differed {{as a function of the}} gestational, lactational, and postweaning diet histories. Rats gestated in, or suckled by high-fat dams, or maintained on the junk food diet were hyperleptinemic compared with their respective controls. Indirect blood pressure did not differ as a function of postweaning diet, but rats gestated in the high-fat dams had lower mean arterial blood pressures than those gestated in the control diet dams. The postweaning dietary history affected food-motivated behavior; junk food-fed rats earned less food pellets on fixed (FR) and <b>progressive</b> (PR) <b>ratio</b> cost schedules than chow-fed controls. In conclusion, the effects of maternal high-fat diet during gestation or lactation were mostly small and transient.

40|$|RATIONALE: 5 -Hydroxytryptamine 2 C (5 -HT 2 C) {{receptor}} agonists {{reduce the}} breakpoint in <b>progressive</b> <b>ratio</b> schedules of reinforcement, an effect {{that has been}} attributed to a decrease of the efficacy of positive reinforcers. However, a reduction of the breakpoint may also reflect motor impairment. Mathematical models can help to differentiate between these processes. OBJECTIVE: The effects of the 5 -HT 2 C receptor agonist Ro- 600175 ((alphaS) - 6 -chloro- 5 -fluoro-alpha-methyl- 1 H-indole- 1 -ethanamine) and the non-selective 5 -HT receptor agonist 1 -(m-chlorophenyl) piperazine (mCPP) on rats' performance on a <b>progressive</b> <b>ratio</b> schedule maintained by food pellet reinforcers were assessed using a model derived from Killeen's Behav Brain Sci 17 : 105 - 172, 1994 general theory of schedule-controlled behaviour, 'mathematical principles of reinforcement'. METHOD: Rats were trained under the <b>progressive</b> <b>ratio</b> schedule, and running and overall response rates in successive ratios were analysed using the model. The effects of the agonists on estimates of the model's parameters, and the sensitivity of these effects to selective antagonists, were examined. RESULTS: Ro- 600175 and mCPP reduced the breakpoint. Neither agonist significantly affected a (the parameter expressing incentive value), but both agonists increased delta (the parameter expressing minimum response time). The effects of both agonists could be attenuated by the selective 5 -HT 2 C receptor antagonist SB- 242084 (6 -chloro- 5 -methyl-N-{ 6 -[(2 -methylpyridin- 3 -yl) oxy]pyridin- 3 -yl}indoline- 1 -carbox amide). The effect of mCPP was not altered by isamoltane, a selective 5 -HT 1 B receptor antagonist, or MDL- 100907 ((+/-) 2, 3 -dimethoxyphenyl- 1 -(2 -(4 -piperidine) methanol)), a selective 5 -HT 2 A receptor antagonist. CONCLUSIONS: The results are consistent with the hypothesis that the effect of the 5 -HT 2 C receptor agonists on <b>progressive</b> <b>ratio</b> schedule performance is mediated by an impairment of motor capacity rather than by a reduction of the incentive value of the food reinforcer...|$|E
40|$|The <b>progressive</b> <b>ratio</b> (PR) {{schedule}} of reinforcement {{is widely used}} to assess rein-forcement strength. Rats typically complete higher ratio requirements for more pal-atable food. This effect is well characterized by the Mathematical Principles of Rein-forcement (MPR). In this experiment, either standard food pellets or amaranth grain were delivered according to PR schedules, with requirements increasing in steps of 1 (PR 1) or 3 (PR 3). Rats completed higher ratio requirements and displayed shorter pre-ratio pauses for pellets than for amaranth. Nevertheless, run-rates were similar across reinforcers. In terms of the theoretical parameters of MPR, similar values in a parameter (which indices incentive value) were obtained for amaranth and pellet reinforcers. This finding suggests that, although amaranth engenders less responding than pellets, amaranth grain is a reliable reinforcer for operant procedures. The MPR model accounted for the differences in quality of food. Key words: MPR model; <b>progressive</b> <b>ratio</b> schedules; food textures; amaranth; food pellets; rats...|$|E
40|$|Growing layers on elastic {{substrates}} {{are capable}} of creating {{a wide variety of}} surface morpholo-gies. Moderate growth generates a regular pattern of sinusoidal wrinkles with a homogeneous energy distribution. While the critical conditions for periodic wrinkling have been extensively studied, the rich pattern formation beyond this first instability point remains poorly under-stood. Here we show that upon continuing growth, the energy progressively localizes and new complex morphologies emerge. Previous studies have often overlooked these secondary bifurcations; they have focused on large stiffness ratios between layer and substrate, where primary instabilities occur early, long before secondary instabilities emerge. We demonstrate that secondary bifurcations are particularly critical in the low stiffness ratio regime, where the critical conditions for primary and secondary instabilities move closer together. Amongst all possible secondary bifurcations, the mode of period-doubling plays a central role- it is en-ergetically favorable over all other modes. Yet, we can numerically suppress period-doubling, by choosing boundary conditions, which favor alternative higher order modes. Our results suggest that in the low stiffness regime, pattern formation is highly sensitive to small im-perfections: surface morphologies emerge rapidly, change spontaneously, and quickly become immensely complex. This is a common paradigm in developmental biology. Our results have significantly applications in the morphogenesis of living systems where growth is <b>progressive</b> and stiffness <b>ratios</b> are low...|$|R

ObjectivesWe investigated the occurrence of non-specific bacteria and quality/quantity of semen of infertile and fertile control groups in Nigeria. Subjects and methodsWe investigated 162 infertile and 54 fertile men. Spermiogram, culture, bacterial isolation and characterization were conducted. ResultsWe report 114 / 162 (70. 4 %) occurrence of bacteria species, 49. 4 % of such were Gram positive and 21 % Gram negative: Staphylococcus aureus (29. 6 %) and Escherichia coli (10. 5 %) had the highest occurrence for each group respectively. On semen quality/quantity, we report 14. 2 % azoospermia, 52. 5 % oligozoospermia and 33. 3 % of normozoospermia. The mean sperm concentrations were 10 × 7 /ml and 41 × 10 6 /ml for oligo and normozoospermia respectively. Majority (52 %) of azoospermic group had no bacterial growth. S. aureus was the most implicated among the bacterial positive group. Within the ologozoospermic category, 28 % had no bacterial growth, 28 % had S. aureus and 11. 8 % E. coli. The normozoospermic patients had 18. 5 % no bacteria contamination, 33. 3 % had S. aureus, 13 % had E. coli. From the analysis, the normozoospermic group with bacterial contamination had lower sperm concentrations compared with those without contamination. It was apparent that factors other than bacterial contamination may contribute more to oligozoospermia (compare: “no bacteria” group mean sperm concentration 8. 97 × 106 /ml, Gram positive bacteria contaminated group 17. 74 × 106 /ml and Gram negative bacteria contaminated group 13. 66 × 106 /ml). The mean <b>progressive</b> motility <b>ratios</b> were lower (15. 6 [a]%+ 18. 3 [b]%) = 33. 9 %) against WHO standard (a+b=> 50 %) and control RPM (a) = 55. 3 %.

ConclusionsAlthough bacterial presence in semen reduced mean sperm concentration and viability, thereby contributed to oligozoospermia and by extension the chances of siring a child, however, factors other than bacterial presence may contribute more.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To study {{long-term}} {{changes in}} the mandibular asymmetry of patients with hemimandibular elongation (HE) treated with two-phase surgical orthodontic approach. DESIGN: Descriptive clinical study. SETTING AND SAMPLE POPULATION: Private practice setting. Seven (six females) out of 47 diagnosed and treated patients for severe mandibular asymmetry were included with the following criteria: diagnosis of HE based on clinical, radiological and single photon emission computed tomography bone scintigraphic studies, good quality orthopantomograms (OPT) available at six time-points, two-phase surgical treatment (high condylectomy, HC, and orthognathic surgery, OS) and measurements of maximal mouth opening (MMO) available. METHOD: Mandibular ramus height and corpus length were measured on OPTs at six time-points. Ratios between the affected/non-affected sides were calculated. RESULTS: All patients had progression of mandibular asymmetry before any operation, which finding together with the scintigraphy resulted to the decision to perform HC. Thereafter ramus and corpus asymmetry decreased compared with the initial measurements. After OS, stable symmetry of corpuses and alignment of skeletal and dental midlines were obtained. MMO reduced on average 50 % after HC, regained 20 % after OS and recovered almost totally at the last follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: High condylectomy to stop excessive growth and OS to correct facial asymmetry is considered successful and necessary treatment for patients with HE. MMO can well recover after surgical traumas. Orthodontists should consider mandibular asymmetry as abnormal and need for surgical treatment if asymmetry is <b>progressive</b> and the <b>ratio</b> between affected/non-affected sides approaches 10 %...|$|R

However, {{the effects of}} such access on the acceptance and reinforcing efficacy of otherwise satisfying alternatives is less known. To investigate the role of nonnutritional contributions to the hypophagia that follows removal of preferred food, male Wistar rats were fed a chow diet (Chow A/I), preferred to their regular chow (Chow), which was equally consumed under 1 -choice conditions to an even more preferred chocolate-flavored, sucrose-rich diet (Preferred). Rats then learned to obtain Chow A/I pellets under a <b>progressive</b> <b>ratio</b> schedule of reinforcement and were assigned to two matched groups. Each week, one group (n = 15) was diet-cycled, receiving Chow A/I for 5 days followed by the Preferred diet for 2 days. Controls received Chow A/I daily (n = 14). <b>Progressive</b> <b>ratio</b> sessions were performed daily during the 5 days that all subjects received Chow A/I in the home cage. Across 5 wk, diet-cycled rats progressively ate less of the otherwise palatable Chow A/I diet. Hypophagia was not due to greater prior intake or weight gain, motor impairment, or facilitated satiation and was associated with changes in <b>progressive</b> <b>ratio</b> performance that suggested a reduced reinforcing efficacy of the Chow A/I diet in diet-cycled animals. By week 4, diet-cycled animals began to overeat the preferred diet, especially during the first 6 h of renewed access, resembling a deprivation effect. The results suggest that intermittent access to highly preferred food, as practiced by many restrained eaters, may progressively decrease the acceptability of less palatable foods, and may promote relapse to more rewarding alternatives...|$|E

We recently published a study describing that the BACHD rat model of HD shows an obesity phenotype, which might affect their motivation to perform food-based behavioral tests.

In the current study, we {{followed up on}} these ideas in a longitudinal study of the rats' performance in a <b>progressive</b> <b>ratio</b> test. We also investigated the phenotype of reduced food consumption rate, which is typically seen in food-restricted BACHD rats, in greater detail.

However, video analysis of food consumption tests suggested that the reduced consumption rate found in the BACHD rats was not entirely based on differences in hunger, but likely involved motoric impairments. Thus, restriction protocols based on food consumption rates are not appropriate when working with BACHD rats. As an alternative, we suggest that studies where BACHD rats are used should investigate how the readouts of interest are affected by motivational differences, and use appropriate control tests to avoid misleading results. In addition, we show that BACHD rats display distinct behavioral changes in their <b>progressive</b> <b>ratio</b> performance, which might be indicative of striatal dysfunction...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop a {{methodology}} for measuring the reward value of food. Potentially, this methodology may help determine why people tend to regain weight after stopping a diet program. Human subjects were given aspartame-sweetened yogurt shake and non-sweet yogurt shake on continuous, or uninhibited, and <b>progressive</b> <b>ratio,</b> or inhibited for increasing intervals, schedules. It was expected that subjects would consume more of the sweet than non-sweet shake on each schedule, and that the <b>progressive</b> <b>ratio</b> schedule would amplify the difference between intake of sweet and non-sweet shake. For males and females together, intake measured reward value only on the continuous schedule. Also, males consumed significantly higher quantities of both sweet and non-sweet shake than females on the continuous schedule, indicating that males may consume markedly more than females only when the food is easily obtained. A second variable, post-meal palatability rating on a nine-point scale, measured reward value for both sexes together on the continuous schedule, and for females, also on the <b>progressive</b> <b>ratio</b> schedule. This variable predicted intake in females, suggesting that females place more emphasis on taste in determining intake than do males. On the continuous schedule, a one-point increase on the nine-point palatability scale corresponded to a 100 gram intake increase. Ultimately, the study showed that when there is no obstacle to obtaining the reinforcer, intake and post-meal palatability rating on a nine-point scale predict reward value, and that males and females stress different factors in deciding how much to consume...|$|E

However, higher baseline FGF 23 was associated with <b>progressive</b> albuminuria (odds <b>ratio</b> 1. 48 [95 % CI]: 1. 05, 2. 08) and a more rapid increase in IMT (13 μm/year, 95 % CI, 3, 24). These findings suggest a role for FGF 23 in HIV-positive populations in identifying patients at greater risk for cardiovascular and kidney disease...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Infections of male {{urogenital}} tracts {{may contribute}} to male infertility. However, the effects of bacterial presence on sperm quality and fertility are controversial. Objectives: We investigated the occurrence of non-specific bacteria and quality/quantity of semen of infertile and fertile control groups in Nigeria. Subjects and methods: We investigated 162 infertile and 54 fertile men. Spermiogram, culture, bacterial isolation and characterization were conducted. Results: We report 114 / 162 (70. 4 %) occurrence of bacteria species, 49. 4 % of such were Gram positive and 21 % Gram negative: Staphylococcus aureus (29. 6 %) and Escherichia coli (10. 5 %) had the highest occurrence for each group respectively. On semen quality/quantity, we report 14. 2 % azoospermia, 52. 5 % oligozoospermia and 33. 3 % of normozoospermia. The mean sperm concentrations were 10  ×  7 /ml and 41  ×  10 6 /ml for oligo and normozoospermia respectively. Majority (52 %) of azoospermic group had no bacterial growth. S. aureus was the most implicated among the bacterial positive group. Within the ologozoospermic category, 28 % had no bacterial growth, 28 % had S. aureus and 11. 8 % E. coli. The normozoospermic patients had 18. 5 % no bacteria contamination, 33. 3 % had S. aureus, 13 % had E. coli. From the analysis, the normozoospermic group with bacterial contamination had lower sperm concentrations compared with those without contamination. It was apparent that factors other than bacterial contamination may contribute more to oligozoospermia (compare: “no bacteria” group mean sperm concentration 8. 97  ×  106 /ml, Gram positive bacteria contaminated group 17. 74  ×  106 /ml and Gram negative bacteria contaminated group 13. 66  ×  106 /ml). The mean <b>progressive</b> motility <b>ratios</b> were lower (15. 6 [a]% +  18. 3 [b]%)  =  33. 9 %) against WHO standard (a + b = > 50 %) and control RPM (a)  =  55. 3 %. Generally, the semen quality (vol., rapid progressive motility, sperm concentration and immotility) were {{significantly lower than the}} fertile group, P =  0. 0005, < 0. 0001, < 0001 and 0. 0335, respectively. Conclusions: Although bacterial presence in semen reduced mean sperm concentration and viability, thereby contributed to oligozoospermia and by extension the chances of siring a child, however, factors other than bacterial presence may contribute more. Improved interpretative approaches of semen analyses are highlighted...|$|R
40|$|Background and purpose: Grey matter (GM) {{and white}} matter (WM) are both {{affected}} in multiple sclerosis (MS). WM is predominantly involved in inflammatory demyelination of relapsing–remitting MS (RRMS), whereas GM is predominantly involved in neurodegenerative processes of secondary progressive MS. Thus, we investigated the ratio between GM and WM volumes in predicting MS evolution. Methods: The present 10 -year retrospective cohort study included 149 patients with newly-diagnosed RRMS, undergoing {{magnetic resonance imaging}} for segmentation and brain volumetry. The ratio between GM and normal-appearing WM (NAWM) volumes was calculated for each subject. Outcome measures of interest were Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) progression, reaching EDSS 4. 0 and conversion to secondary progressive (SP) MS. Results: During a period of 10. 6 ± 2. 4 years, a median 1. 5 EDSS progression was observed (range 0 – 5. 5), 54 subjects (36. 2 %) reached EDSS 4. 0 and 30 subjects (20. 1 %) converted to SP. With ordinal logistic regression models, EDSS progression was associated with GM:NAWM ratio (coefficient, − 2. 918; 95 % CI, − 4. 739 – 1. 097). With Cox regression models, subjects with higher GM:NAWM ratio at diagnosis had a 90 % lower rate of reaching EDSS 4. 0 (hazard ratio, 0. 111; 95 % CI, 0. 020 – 0. 609) and of converting to secondary <b>progressive</b> MS (hazard <b>ratio,</b> 0. 017; 95 % CI, 0. 001 – 0. 203) compared with subjects with lower GM:NAWM ratio. Conclusions: The GM:NAWM ratio is a predictor of disability progression and of SP conversion in subjects with newly diagnosed RRMS, suggesting that GM and NAWM are variably affected in relation to disease evolution from the early phases of MS. © 2016 EA...|$|R

40|$|College {{undergraduates}} {{were given}} repeated opportunities {{to choose between}} a fixed-ratio and a progressive-ratio schedule of reinforcement. Completions of a progressive-ratio schedule produced points (exchangeable for money) and incremented that response requirement by 20 responses with each consecutive choice. In the reset condition, completion of a fixed ratio produced {{the same number of}} points and also reset the <b>progressive</b> <b>ratio</b> back to its initial value. In the no-reset condition, the <b>progressive</b> <b>ratio</b> continued to increase by increments of 20 throughout the session with each successive selection of this schedule, irrespective of fixed-ratio choices. Subjects' schedule choices were sensitive to parametric manipulations {{of the size of the}} fixed-ratio schedule and were consistent with predictions made on the basis of minimizing the number of responses emitted per point earned, which is a principle of most optimality theories. Also, the present results suggest that if data from human performances are to be compared with results for other species, humans should be exposed to schedules of reinforcement for long periods of time, as is commonly done with nonhuman subjects...|$|E
40|$|Understanding the neurobiological basis {{underlying}} {{individual differences}} in conditioned stimulus (CS) sensitivity is pertinent, given that excessive conditioned responses to CSs is a key feature of anxiety-related disorders and drug addiction. We have previously shown that behaviour of serotonin transporter knockout (5 -HTT(-/-)) rats-mimicking the common 5 -HTT promoter polymorphism in humans-is strongly driven by Pavlovian CSs. To investigate whether the knockout rats attribute greater incentive salience to CSs, we tested the 5 -HTT(-/-) rats and their wild-type counterparts in the sucrose-reinforced sign-versus goal-tracking task. We also assessed whether motivational properties of the unconditioned stimulus (sucrose pellet) {{are involved in the}} individual differences under investigation, by testing the animals in a sucrose-reinforced <b>progressive</b> <b>ratio</b> schedule of reinforcement. We found no genotype differences in sign-versus goal-tracking behavior, despite that <b>progressive</b> <b>ratio</b> responding was increased in 5 -HTT(-/-) rats. In conclusion, the high CS sensitivity in 5 -HTT(-/-) rats cannot be explained by enhanced incentive salience attribution to the CS as measured by the sign- versus goal-tracking paradigm. Rather, 5 -HTT(-/-) rats may be more sensitive to the motivational properties of the unconditioned stimulus...|$|E
40|$|AimTo {{evaluate}} {{lung disease}} on chest radiography (CR), the relative frequency of CR abnormalities, and their clinical correlates in adolescents with vertically-acquired {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV) infection. Materials and methodsCRs of 75 patients [59 inpatients (33 males; mean age 13. 7 ± 2. 3 years) and 16 outpatients (eight males; mean age 14. 1 ± 2. 1 years) ] were retrospectively reviewed by three independent observers. The overall extent of disease (to the nearest 5 %), its distribution, and the proportional extents (totalling 100 %) of different radiographic patterns (including ring/tramline opacities and consolidation) were quantified. CR features and clinical data were compared. ResultsCRs were abnormal in 51 / 75 (68 %) with “extensive” disease in 38 / 51 (74 %). Ring/tramline opacities and consolidation predominated (i. e., proportional extent > 50 %) in 26 and 21 patients, respectively. Consolidation was significantly more common in patients hospitalized primarily for a respiratory illness than patients hospitalized for a non-respiratory illness or in outpatients (p< 0. 005, χ 2 for trend); by contrast, ring/tramline opacities {{did not differ in}} prevalence across the groups. On stepwise logistic regression, predominant consolidation was associated with <b>progressive</b> dyspnoea [odds <b>ratio</b> (OR) 5. 60; 95 % confidence intervals (CI) : 1. 60, 20. 1; p< 0. 01] and was associated with a primary respiratory cause for hospital admission (OR:  22. 0; CI: 2. 7, 181. 1; p< 0. 005). Ring/tramline opacities were equally prevalent in patients with and without chronic symptoms and in those admitted to hospital with respiratory and non-respiratory illness. ConclusionIn HIV-infected adolescents, evaluated in secondary practice, CR abnormalities are prevalent. The presence of ring/tramline opacities, believed to reflect chronic airway disease, is not linked chronic respiratory symptoms...|$|R
40|$|The {{role of the}} melanocortin (MC) {{system in}} feeding {{behavior}} is well established. Food in-take is potently suppressed by central infusion of the MC 3 / 4 receptor agonist α-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH), whereas the MC 3 / 4 receptor inverse-agonist Agouti Related Peptide (AGRP) has the opposite effect. MC receptors are widely expressed in both hypo-thalamic and extra-hypothalamic brain regions, including nuclei involved in food reward and motivation, such as the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and the ventral tegmental area. This sug-gests that MCs modulate motivational aspects of food intake. To test this hypothesis, rats were injected intracerebroventricularly with α-MSH or AGRP and their motivation for su-crose was tested under a <b>progressive</b> <b>ratio</b> schedule of reinforcement. Food motivated be-havior was dose-dependently decreased by α-MSH. Conversely, AGRP increased responding for sucrose, an effect that was blocked by pretreatment with the dopamine re-ceptor antagonist α-flupenthixol. In contrast to <b>progressive</b> <b>ratio</b> responding, free intake of sucrose remained unaltered upon α-MSH or AGRP infusion. In addition, we investigated whether the effects of α-MSH and AGRP on food motivation were mediated by the NA...|$|E
40|$|Roux-en-Y gastric {{bypass surgery}} (RYGB) is an {{effective}} treatment for severe obesity. Clinical studies however have reported susceptibility to increased alcohol use after RYGB, and preclinical studies have shown increased alcohol intake in obese rats after RYGB. This could reflect a direct enhancement of alcohol’s rewarding effects in the brain or an indirect effect due to increased alcohol absorption after RGYB. To rule out the contribution that changes in alcohol absorption have on its rewarding effects, here we assessed the effects of RYGB on intravenously (IV) administered ethanol (1 %). For this purpose, high fat (60 % kcal from fat) diet-induced obese male Sprague Dawley rats were tested, 2 months after RYGB or sham surgery (SHAM) using both fixed and <b>progressive</b> <b>ratio</b> schedules of reinforcement to evaluate if RGYB modified the reinforcing effects of IV ethanol. Compared to SHAM, RYGB rats made significantly more active spout responses to earn IV ethanol during the fixed ratio schedule, and achieved higher breakpoints during the <b>progressive</b> <b>ratio</b> schedule. Although additional studies are needed, our results provide preliminary evidence that RYGB increases the rewarding effects of alcoho...|$|E
