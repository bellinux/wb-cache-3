40|$|A recent {{editorial}} by Naoki Ikegami {{has proposed}} three key lessons from Japan’s experience of achieving virtually universal coverage with primary healthcare services: {{the need to}} integrate the existing <b>providers</b> <b>of</b> <b>primary</b> healthcare services into the organised health system; the need to limit government commitments to finance hospital services {{and the need to}} empower <b>providers</b> <b>of</b> <b>primary</b> healthcare to influence decisions that influence their livelihoods. Although the context of low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) differs in many ways from Japan in the late 19 th and early 20 th centuries, the lesson that short-term initiatives to achieve universal coverage need to be complemented by an understanding of the factors influencing long-term change management remains highly relevant. ...|$|R

40|$|After the {{publication}} of some long period data on terms <b>of</b> trade <b>of</b> <b>primary</b> <b>products</b> by Grilli and Yang(1988), a new debate started- whether the terms of trade seriesfollowed a deterministic path of decline or not. This paper critically examines this debate and concludes that the new series supports thePrebisch-Singer hypothesis. The terms <b>of</b> trade <b>of</b> <b>primary</b> <b>products</b> vis-a-vis manufactures have a statistically significant declining trend over the period, 1900 - 86 and the eruption of debt crisis in the 1980 s accentuated the situation. This is a deterministic trend, not simply the permanent effect of a temporary shock. ...|$|R
40|$|The long-run {{trend in}} the ratio <b>of</b> <b>primary</b> <b>product</b> prices to those of {{manufactured}} goods is examined {{in the context of}} an error correction model. The ratio was approximately stable from 1925 to 1980, after which there was a significant drop. However, the separate component series (metals, food, nonfood 'soft'commodities) display marked dissimilarities. This casts doubt on generalizations about the relative price <b>of</b> <b>primary</b> <b>products</b> as a group and helps to explain disagreement amongst previous authors. The relationship between relative prices and the terms of trade of developing countries is examined and the policy implications discussed. Copyright 1993 by Royal Economic Society. ...|$|R
