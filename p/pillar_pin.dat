The antenna <b>pillar</b> <b>pin</b> of the PRARE {{tracking antenna}} {{was tied to}} the International GPS Service for Geodynamics (IGS) antenna reference point by relative GPS positioning, and its International Terrestrial Reference Frame 1994 (ITRF 94) coordinates were estimated as X_P= 1766500. 399 m, Y_P= 1460251. 211 m, and Z_P=- 5932214. 446 m at the epoch of 1997. 0. The total number of normal point data for range measurements attained almost 100 % (around 2500 min per week) from March to September, 1997; however, the number of received data decreased significantly thereafter. This {{may be due to}} a degraded X-band RF-cable under the cold temperature condition in the radome. Although an on-site tropospheric correction could not be made, post-processing with the surface synoptic data showed improvements of the overall root mean square (rms) range errors from about 50 cm to 30 cm. Application of the PRARE obtained precise orbits to radar altimeter and synthetic aperture radar studies will be discussed in a separate report...|$|E

40|$|We report {{results of}} a {{detailed}} experimental investigation into the drying of sessile droplets of aqueous poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) polymer solutions under various experimental conditions. Samples are prepared {{with a range of}} initial concentrations c 0 and are filtered to remove traces of undissolved PEO clusters. In typical experiments, droplets with initial volumes between 5 L and 50 L are left to evaporate while temperature and relative humidity are monitored. Droplets either form a disk-like solid “puddle” or a tall conical “pillar”. The droplet mass is monitored using a microbalance and the droplet profile is recorded regularly using a digital camera. Subsequent processing of the data allows values of droplet volume V, surface area A, base radius R, contact angle θ and height h to be determined throughout drying. From this data we identify four stages during <b>pillar</b> formation: <b>pinned</b> drying; pseudo-dewetting; bootstrap building; solid contraction and propose physical models to explain key aspects of each stage and to predict the transition from each stage to the next. The experimental parameters of relative humidity, temperature, pressure, droplet volume and initial contact angle are all systematically varied and observed to influence the drying process and consequently whether the droplet forms a pillar or a puddle. We combine these parameters into a dimensionless Péclet number Pe, which compares the relative effects of evaporation and diffusion, and show that the drying behaviour is only dependent on c 0 and Pe...|$|R

Modified surfaces having nano/micro porous features of mainly irregular shapes through anodic oxidation processes, coating of metallic and non-metallic layers, deposition of powder materials, and roughening for improving boiling heat transfer have been of research interests of many researchers. In addition, pool boiling and flow boiling studies on artificial structures, mainly fabricated on a plain surface, such as <b>pins,</b> <b>pillar</b> fins, grooves (in different shapes, i. e. rectangular, square, cylinder, etc.) for increasing the heated surface area, or cavities created on substrates for increasing bubble nucleation sites were also considered for both micro and nano scale.

40|$|Mechanical {{instability}} and large deformation are pervasive occurrences on stressed soft material surface patterns, which are normally detrimental to device performance. In this dissertation {{we show that}} these phenomena can be harnessed on structured polymeric thin films for surface patterning, strong dry adhesion and guided wettability. On dyed SU- 8 photoresist films with graded depth-wise crosslinking density, we study the swelling-induced wrinkling. We demonstrate that isotropic surface wrinkles can be aligned with low aspect ratio 1 -D channel-type pre-patterns. By varying the pitch and height ratios, defined as the pre-pattern pitch and height of the channels to the wrinkle wavelength and amplitude, respectively, we construct a morphological diagram of the confined wrinkles. For pitch ratios much larger than 1, the wrinkle morphology is predominantly isotropic. As pitch ratio decreases to ~ 1, the wrinkles arrange to out-of-phase 1 -D bumps along the mountain regions of the channels. For pitch ratio much smaller than 1, the wrinkles evolve from in-phase perpendicular (to the channels) wrinkles, coexisting perpendicular wrinkles and localized patterns back to isotropic wrinkles {{in the order of}} decreasing height ratios. In a separate material system, we utilize the buckling of high aspect ratio shape memory polymer (SMP) pillars to develop a strong interlocking dry adhesive. We engage the two identical pillar arrays together above the glass transition temperature of SMP (80 °C), where the SMP modulus drops by 3 orders of magnitude, leading to mutual buckling and deformation of the pillars when interlocked. Our finite element analysis and comparison of the calculated adhesion versus experimental data suggest that the adhesion force originates primarily from the pillar interweaving and secondarily from pillar indentation. The resultant pillar-to-pillar adhesion forces in normal (~ 54 N/cm 2) and shear (~ 72 N/cm 2) direction are found much larger than the pillar-to-flat (~ 12 N/cm 2 in normal and ~ 15 N/cm 2 in shear) and flat-to-flat contacts (~ 7 N/cm 2 in normal and ~ 16 N/cm 2 in shear). We further tune the adhesion anisotropy, designated by the ratio of shear to normal adhesion, by changing the pillar spacing. In spite of the strong adhesion, we show that the engaged adhesive can be easily separate on demand by heating to 80 °C. Using similar SMP pillars, we design a reconfigurable surface to control surface wettability. Specifically, we report that the water droplets convert from low adhesion Cassie state on the original (or recovered) straight <b>pillars</b> to fully <b>pinned</b> Wenzel state on deformed pillars. Potentially, surface with both straight and deformed pillars can be utilized as a reprogrammable water collecting surface. Employing the deformed pillars, we present an advanced patterning method based on the deformed SMP pillars to transfer nanoparticle assemblies from donor substrates onto selected locations of pillars. Finally, we show a new approach to precisely control the tilting angle of the SMP pillars by coating the deformed pillars with a layer of metal, which hinders the full recovery of SMP pillars. On the composite surface, we observe strong anisotropic liquid spreading behavior, where the liquid propagates predominantly in the opposite direction of the pillar tilting. ...|$|R
40|$|Liquid-solid {{interactions}} {{become important}} as dimensions approach mciro/nano-scale. This dissertation focuses on liquid-solid interactions in two distinct applications: capillary driven self-assembly of thin foils into 3 D structures, and droplet wetting of hydrophobic micropatterned surfaces. The phenomenon of self-assembly of complex structures {{is common in}} biological systems. Examples include self-assembly of proteins into macromolecular structures and self-assembly of lipid bilayer membranes. The principles governing this phenomenon have been applied to induce self-assembly of millimeter scale Si thin films into spherical and other 3 D structures, which are then integrated into light-trapping photovoltaic (PV) devices. Motivated by this application, we present a generalized analytical study of the self-folding of thin plates into deterministic 3 D shapes, through fluid-solid interactions, {{to be used as}} PV devices. This study consists of developing a model using beam theory, which incorporates the two competing components — a capillary force that promotes folding and the bending rigidity of the foil that resists folding into a 3 D structure. Through an equivalence argument of thin foils of different geometry, an effective folding parameter, which uniquely characterizes the driving force for folding, has been identified. A criterion for spontaneous folding of an arbitrarily shaped 2 D foil, based on the effective folding parameter, is thus established. Measurements from experiments using different materials and predictions from the model match well, validating the assumptions used in the analysis. As an alternative to the mechanics model approach, the minimization of the total free energy is employed to investigate the interactions between a fluid droplet and a flexible thin film. A 2 D energy functional is proposed, comprising the surface energy of the fluid, bending energy of the thin film and gravitational energy of the fluid. Through simulations with Surface Evolver, the shapes of the droplet and the thin film at equilibrium are obtained. A critical thin film length necessary for complete enclosure of the fluid droplet, and hence successful self-assembly into a PV device, is determined and compared with the experimental results and mechanics model predictions. The results from the modeling and energy approaches and the experiments are all consistent. Superhydrophobic surfaces, which have unique properties including self-cleaning and water repelling are desired in many applications. One excellent example in nature is the lotus leaf. To fabricate these surfaces, well designed micro/nano- surface structures are often employed. In this research, we fabricate superhydrophobic micropatterned Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) surfaces composed of micropillars of various sizes and arrangements by means of soft lithography. Both anisotropic surfaces, consisting of parallel grooves and cylindrical pillars in rectangular lattices, and isotropic surfaces, consisting of cylindrical pillars in square and hexagonal lattices, are considered. A novel technique is proposed to image the contact line (CL) of the droplet on the hydrophobic surface. This technique provides a new approach to distinguish between partial and complete wetting. The contact area between droplet and microtextured surface is then measured for a droplet in the Cassie state, which is a state of partial wetting. The results show that although the droplet is in the Cassie state, the contact area does not necessarily follow Cassie model predictions. Moreover, the CL is not circular, and is affected by the micropatterns, in both isotropic and anisotropic cases. Thus, it is suggested that along with the contact angle — the typical parameter reported in literature quantifying wetting, {{the size and shape of}} the contact area should also be presented. This technique is employed to investigate the evolution of the CL on a hydrophobic micropatterned surface in the cases of: a single droplet impacting the micropatterned surface, two droplets coalescing on micropillars, and a receding droplet resting on the micropatterned surface. Another parameter which quantifies hydrophobicity is the contact angle hysteresis (CAH), which indicates the resistance of the surface to the sliding of a droplet with a given volume. The conventional methods of using advancing and receding angles or tilting stage to measure the resistance of the micropatterned surface are indirect, without mentioning the inaccuracy due to the discrete and stepwise motion of the CL on micropillars. A micronewton force sensor is utilized to directly measure the resisting force by dragging a droplet on a microtextured surface. Together with the proposed imaging technique, the evolution of the CL during sliding is also explored. It is found that, at the onset of sliding, the CL behaves as a linear elastic solid with a constant stiffness. Afterwards, the force first increases and then decreases and reaches a steady state, accompanied with periodic oscillations due to regular pinning and depinning of the CL. Both the maximum and steady state forces are primarily dependent on area fractions of the micropatterned surfaces in our experiment. The resisting force is found to be proportional to the number of <b>pillars</b> which <b>pin</b> the CL at the trailing edge, validating the assumption that the resistance mainly arises from the CL pinning at the trailing edge. In each pinning-and-depinning cycle during the steady state, the CL also shows linear elastic behavior but with a lower stiffness. The force variation and energy dissipation involved can also be determined. This novel method of measuring the resistance of the micropatterned surface elucidates the dependence on CL pinning and provides more insight into the mechanisms of CAH...|$|R
