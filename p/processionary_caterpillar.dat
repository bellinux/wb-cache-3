5000|$|The pine <b>processionary</b> <b>caterpillar</b> is {{responsible}} for most of the defoliation of southern Europe.

40|$|Reasons for {{performing}} study: In Australia, {{there have been}} recent reports of unusual abortions in mid- to late-gestation mares. These were clinically distinct from other recognised causes of pregnancy loss and the term 2 ̆ 7 equine amnionitis and fetal loss 2 ̆ 7 (EAFL) was adopted to describe this syndrome. Initial investigations concluded that possible causal factors included the presence on affected stud farms of <b>Processionary</b> <b>caterpillars</b> (Ochrogaster lunifer). Objectives: To determine if exposure of pregnant mares to <b>Processionary</b> <b>caterpillars</b> or their shed exoskeletons can induce EAFL. Methods: <b>Processionary</b> <b>caterpillars</b> and their shed exoskeletons were collected and stored frozen. Mid-gestation mares were dosed with a slurry of caterpillars or shed exoskeleton by nasogastric intubation. Their clinical responses and times to abortion were recorded. All aborted fetuses were autopsied and samples taken for bacteriological and virological culture and histopathology. Results: Intubating mares in mid-pregnancy with preparations of either whole <b>Processionary</b> <b>caterpillars</b> or shed caterpillar exoskeletons induced abortion with few impending clinical signs. The gross pathological and bacteriological findings of the aborted fetuses {{were similar to those}} observed in field cases of EAFL. Potential relevance: Possible exposure to <b>Processionary</b> <b>caterpillars</b> should be considered when examining cases of fetal loss in the mare. The present results provide a starting point to further explore the aetiology and pathogenesis of EAFL...|$|R
50|$|The {{larval stage}} of some Thaumetopoeidae {{are known as}} <b>processionary</b> <b>caterpillars,</b> so named because they move in columns in search of food, {{resembling}} a procession. Some of the species, like the pine and oak processionaries, can constitute a health hazard.|$|R
5000|$|Note {{that the}} cutworm mode of feeding {{is only one}} version of a {{strategy}} of avoiding predators and parasitoids by day.

Some, for example Klugeana philoxalis attack low-growing forbs such as Oxalis in the dark, and drop to the ground as soon as a light is flashed on them. Others will climb trees such as species of Acacia nightly, leaving trails of silk, but they leave individual trails, not common trails like <b>processionary</b> <b>caterpillars.</b> The fruit-piercing moth Serrodes partita similarly lives under litter beneath its food plant, the tree Pappea capensis ...|$|R
50|$|Ochrogaster lunifer (the bag-shelter moth, {{also known}} as the <b>processionary</b> <b>caterpillar),</b> {{is a member of the}} family Thaumetopoeidae. Both the larval and adult forms have hairs that cause {{irritation}} of the skin (urticaria). The adult moth has a woolly appearance and its wings can grow to be about 5.5cm across. The larvae feed on Grevillea striata at night and reside in brown silken bag nest during the day.|$|E
50|$|In {{the absence}} of a radiant heat source, the body {{temperature}} of aggregated social caterpillars may be several degrees Celsius above ambient temperature. This phenomenon was first reported in 1938 in Vanessa caterpillars. Subsequently, other studies showed that the shelter of the pine <b>processionary</b> <b>caterpillar</b> Thaumetopoea pityocampa rose 2 to 3 °C when occupied by the caterpillars and cooled down when they left the structure to feed. Studies of the social caterpillars of Eriogaster lanestris showed that the internal temperature of the nest exceed ambient temperature by as much as 6.7 °C, though the average temperature gains of 2 to 3 °C were in line with those reported for other species. These thermal gains reported for these species appear attributable to the trapping of the metabolic heat generated by the caterpillars as they process food.|$|E
5000|$|When the SPSE {{mechanism}} explaining MRLS was identified, it {{was immediately}} {{apparent that the}} model might be an ancient defensive mechanism of caterpillars, and that MRLS-like syndromes might well exist and be identified elsewhere.

She put Tobin {{in touch with the}} investigating veterinarian, Dr. Nigel Perkins, who at that time understood the Kentucky MRLS outbreak to be black cherry tree/cyanide-driven. Advice to Dr. Perkins was brief and unequivocal—given the similarities between MRLS and the syndrome he was describing and the possible role of caterpillars in his syndrome, his experimental approaches should be to first test the caterpillars, any and all other abortigenic candidates, test second.

Allergic reactions may follow in susceptible individuals on subsequent exposure to the hairs.|$|R
50|$|An ant mill is an {{observed}} {{phenomenon in}} which a group of army ants, which are blind, are separated from the main foraging party, lose the pheromone track and begin to follow one another, forming a continuously rotating circle.

The phenomenon is {{a side effect of}} the self-organizing structure of ant colonies. Each ant follows the ant in front of it, which works until something goes wrong, and an ant mill forms. An ant mill was first described by William Beebe in 1921 who observed a mill 1200 ft (~370 m) in circumference. It took each ant 2.5 hours to make one revolution.

40|$|The pine <b>processionary</b> <b>caterpillar,</b> Thaumetopoea pityocampa, is {{considered}} an emerging pine pest in Mediterranean countries, with high medical relevance. In recent years, adverse reactions reports in humans following contact with T. pityocampa have been increasingly reported. Dogs living in pinewood areas are also frequently exposed to the caterpillar. This work consisted on a retrospective study of 41 cases of lepidopterism. All dogs presented drooling, dysphagia, submandibular lymphadenomegaly and clinical signs of pain. The animals were distributed in three groups, according to the time span from exposure to the caterpillar until presentation: up to 2 h (group 1), 2 - 5 h (group 2) and more than 5 h (group 3). All animals from groups 2 (n = 5) and 3 (n = 9), and eight dogs from group 1 (n = 27) developed lingual necrosis. Lepidopterism coursed through a predictable clinical pattern.

Focal hyperplastic serositis was found in the duodenum, cecum, dorsal colon, and uteri of various mares occasionally with embedded setal fragments.

40|$|Background. Pine processionary larvae produce urticating hairs (setae) {{that serve}} for {{protection}} against predators. Setae induce cutaneous reactions in animals and humans. The presence of toxic or allergic mechanisms {{is a matter}} of debate. Objectives. To detect the presence of allergens in setae and to characterize them. Materials and methods. Setae extracts were characterized by gel staining and immunoblot, with sera from patients with immediate reactions and positive prick test reactions, as well as a rabbit antiserum raised against setae. Setae proteins were fractionated by high-performance liquid chromatography. The most relevant allergen was analysed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry (MS), and its sequence was deduced from an expressed sequence tag bank. Results. Setae contained at least seven different allergens. The most intense detection corresponded to a protein of MW ∼ 14 000 that was similar to thaumetopoein, a previously described protein with mast cell-degranulating properties. MALDI-MS-based de novo sequencing provided a partial amino acid sequence {{different from that of the}} previously described allergen Tha p 1, and it was named Tha p 2.

Three control membranes and 1 control fetus and membranes were examined. Caterpillar setal fragments {{were present in the}} allantochorion of the 3 fetuses from the euthanized mares and 11 of 12 aborted fetuses (92 %) embedded in the chorion (villi or stroma) or allantois (vasculature or stroma).

40|$|There is {{increasing}} evidence that plants can react to biotic aggressions with highly specific responses. However, {{few studies have}} attempted to jointly investigate whether the induction of plant defences is specific to a targeted plant tissue, plant species, herbivore identity, and defensive trait. Here we studied those factors contributing to the specificity of induced defensive responses in two economically impor- tant pine species against two chewing insect pest herbivores. Juvenile trees of Pinus pinaster andP. radiata were exposed to herbivory by two major pest threats, the large pine weevil Hylobius abietis (a bark-fee- der) and the pine <b>processionary</b> <b>caterpillar</b> Thaumetopoea pityocampa (a folivore). We quantified in two tissues (stem and needles) the constitutive (control plants) and herbivore-induced concentrations of total polyphenolics, volatile and non-volatile resin, {{as well as the}} profile of mono- and sesquiterpenes. Stem chewing by the pine weevil increased concentrations of non-volatile resin, volatile monoterpenes, and (marginally) polyphenolics in stem tissues. Weevil feeding also increased the concentration of non-vol- atile resin and decreased polyphenolics in the needle tissues. Folivory by the caterpillar had no major effects on needle defensive chemistry, but a strong increase in the concentration of polyphenolics in the stem. Interestingly, we found similar patterns for all these above-reported effects in both pine spe- cies. These results offer convincing evidence that induced defences are highly specific and may vary depending on the targeted plant tissue, the insect herbivore causing the damage and the considered defensive compound.

40|$|Purpose To {{report on}} a child {{presenting}} with iritis and angle closure glaucoma caused by caterpillar hairs. Methods A 12 -year-old girl complained of sudden pain and visual loss in her left eye while she was playing in a pinewood. Two hours later, she developed maculo-papular rash on her limbs. On examination, left visual acuity was 1 / 10. The affected eye showed conjunctival hyperemia, corneal edema, anterior chamber flare (4 + cells). Corneal staining with fluorescein disclosed diffuse superficial punctate keratopathy. Left IOP was 55 mm Hg. Visante OCT of the affected eye showed a thin, translucent, linear foreign body into the cornea and anterior chamber up to the irido-corneal angle. Topical steroids, antibiotics, cycloplegics, hypotensive eyedrops, and intravenous mannitol were given. Results Inspection of {{the place where the}} girl was playing revealed the presence of numerous <b>processionary</b> pine <b>caterpillars.</b> On the basis of this finding and the clinical data, a diagnosis of iritis and angle closure glaucoma caused by caterpillar hairs was made.

In order to detect the GMM, specific primers were used, and a previously defined protocol for DNA isolation from bacteria colonizing pine needles was applied. The method, based on vortexing in a suspension of glass beads followed by microcolumn extractions, allowed sensitive PCR monitoring of the target transgenes.

PCR-dominance of the released bacterium in the community was extended until 21 days from release while its activity against insect larvae lasted for over 3 months. The prokaryotic epiphytic population, irrespective of any particular impact from the released strain, showed no resilience but a general successional trend, which, remarkably, appeared synchronous on all trees tested, including non-inoculated controls.

Were, we present life tables for egg batches and larval cohorts of the <b>processionary</b> <b>caterpillar</b> Ochrogaster lunifer Herrich-Schaffer, using intensive local sampling combined with extensive regional monitoring to ascertain the relative importance of different mortality factors at different localities. Extinction of entire cohorts (representing the entire reproductive output of one female) at natural localities was high, with 82 % of the initial 492 cohorts going extinct. Mortality was highest in the egg and early instar stages due to predation from dermestid beetles, and while different mortality factors (e. g. hatching failure, egg parasitism and failure to establish on the host) were present at many localities, dermestid predation, either directly observed or inferred from indirect evidence, was the dominant mortality factor at 89 % of localities surveyed. Predation was significantly higher in plantations than in natural habitats. The second most important mortality factor was resource depletion, with 14 cohorts defoliating their hosts. Egg and larval parasitism were not major mortality agents. A combination of predation and resource depletion consistently accounted for the majority of mortality across localities, suggesting that both factors are important in limiting population abundance. This evidence shows that O. lunifer is not regulated by natural enemies alone, but that resource patches (Acacia trees) ultimately, and frequently, act together to limit population growth...|$|E
40|$|Dissertação de Mestrado Integrado em Medicina VeterináriaA Thaumetopoea pityocampa, vulgarmente conhecida por processionária, é endémica no sul da Europa. A exposição aos pêlos urticantes, que surgem a partir da 3 ª fase larvar, provoca dermatite e urticária de contacto em humanos e nos animais domésticos, constituindo um problema de saúde pública. Em Medicina Veterinária não existe, até à data, nenhum trabalho sobre os seus efeitos na espécie felina. Este estudo retrospectivo relata 6 casos clínicos de felinos que contactaram com a processionária na Península de Setúbal. Tem como {{principal}} objectivo a caracterização do quadro clínico, medidas terapêuticas e evolução. Todos os animais foram presentes à consulta nos meses de Fevereiro e Março, altura em que as larvas descem dos pinheiros e formam as típicas procissões, no período decorrido entre 2007 e 2012. A amostra incluiu 3 fêmeas e 3 machos, todos da raça Doméstico de pêlo curto e com idades compreendidas entre 5 meses e 8 anos. O período de tempo decorrido desde o contacto até à consulta variou desde 1 hora a mais de 2 dias. Os sinais clínicos ocorreram de forma aguda com carácter evolutivo. Ao exame clínico observou-se: prurido facial (6 / 6), ptialismo (5 / 6), eritema facial (4 / 6), queilite (3 / 6), edema facial (3 / 6), edema lingual ou sub-lingual (3 / 6), glossite ulcerativa (3 / 6), anorexia (3 / 6), lesões ulcerativas orofaciais (2 / 6), disfagia (2 / 6), edema submandibular (1 / 6), vómito (1 / 6) e edema das extremidades dos membros anteriores (1 / 6). Foi instituída terapêutica de suporte e sintomática e todos os animais recuperaram completamente. A maioria dos gatos afectados tinha uma idade inferior a 10 meses, o que sugere que os animais jovens correm maior risco de exposição. A cabeça foi a região mais atingida, destacando-se a face e a cavidade oral. Embora alguns gatos tenham apresentado glossite e lesões ulcerativas, nunca se constatou uma evolução necrosante. O contacto com T. pityocampa em felinos é um problema subestimado, tanto na literatura científica como na prática clínica, tornando-se importante sensibilizar os clínicos para esta causa de urticária e dermatite de contacto. ABSTRACT - EFFECTS OF EXPOSURE TO THAUMETOPOEA PITYOCAMPA IN CATS : REPORT OF 6 CLINICAL CASES - The {{larval form}} of Thaumetopoea pityocampa, {{commonly known as}} pine <b>processionary</b> <b>caterpillar,</b> is endemic in southern Europe. Exposure to its urticant hairs, which appear from the third larval stage (L 5) onwards, induces dermatitis and contact urticaria in humans and animals. Most of the clinicians in small animal veterinary practice are familiar with this threat, however {{few studies have been}} published and up to date there are no works concerning its effects in cats. Based on 6 cases, the aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the evolution of the clinical manifestations of lepidopterism and therapeutic measures that should be implemented. The cases here described were observed from 2007 to 2012, during the months of February and March in the peninsula of Setúbal. The sample included 3 males and 3 females, with ages ranging from 5 months to 8 years and all animals were DSH. The period of time elapsed from exposure and consultation extended from less than 1 hour to more than 2 days. The disease course and progression of clinical signs were acute in all cases. Physical examination findings comprised: facial pruritus (6 / 6), ptyalism (5 / 6), facial erythema (4 / 6), facial oedema (3 / 6), cheilitis (3 / 6), lingual or sub-lingual oedema (3 / 6), ulcerative glossitis (3 / 6), anorexia (3 / 6), orofacial ulcerative lesions (2 / 6), dysphagia (2 / 6), submandibular oedema (1 / 6), vomit (1 / 6) and distal forelimbs oedema (1 / 6). The medical approach consisted primarily of supportive and symptomatic treatment. All cats recovered completely. All cases occurred in the period of greatest risk of contact. This time coincides with the last larval stage (L 5), when the abundance of urticating hairs is the highest and the caterpillars abandon the trees forming a typical procession in order to pupate in the soil. Most of the affected cats were less than 10 months old, suggesting that young animals may be particularly susceptible. The head was the most affected region of the body, especially the face and oral cavity. Although some cats presented glossitis and ulcerative lesions, none progressed to necrosis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study reporting several adverse reactions caused by pine <b>processionary</b> <b>caterpillar</b> contact in cats. This problem is underestimated in scientific literature and in clinical practice. It is important to raise awareness among small animal veterinarians to this cause of urticaria and contact dermatitis in cats in endemic areas...|$|E
40|$|In {{the past}} century, {{the debate over}} whether or not density-dependent factors {{regulate}} populations has generally focused on changes in mean population density, ignoring the spatial variance around the mean as unimportant noise. In an attempt to provide a different framework for understanding population dynamics based on individual fitness, this paper discusses the crucial role of spatial variability itself on the stability of insect populations. The advantages of this method are the following: (1) it is founded on evolutionary principles rather than post hoc assumptions; (2) it erects hypotheses that can be tested; and (3) it links disparate ecological schools, including spatial dynamics, behavioral ecology, preference-performance, and plant apparency into an overall framework. At the core of this framework, habitat complexity governs insect spatial variance. which in turn determines population stability. First, the minimum risk distribution (MRD) is defined as the spatial distribution of individuals that results in the minimum number of premature deaths in a population given the distribution of mortality risk in the habitat (and, therefore, leading to maximized population growth). The greater the divergence of actual spatial patterns of individuals from the MRD, the greater the reduction of population growth and size from high, unstable levels. Then, based on extensive data from 29 populations of the <b>processionary</b> <b>caterpillar,</b> Ochrogaster lunifer, four steps are used to test the effect of habitat interference on population growth rates. (1) The costs (increasing the risk of scramble competition) and benefits (decreasing the risk of inverse density-dependent predation) of egg and larval aggregation are quantified. (2) These costs and benefits, along with the distribution of resources, are used to construct the MRD for each habitat. (3) The MRD is used as a benchmark against which the actual spatial pattern of individuals is compared. The degree of divergence of the actual spatial pattern from the MRD is quantified for each of the 29 habitats. (4) Finally, indices of habitat complexity are used to provide highly accurate predictions of spatial divergence from the MRD, showing that habitat interference reduces population growth rates from high, unstable levels. The reason for the divergence appears to be that high levels of background vegetation (vegetation other than host plants) interfere with female host-searching behavior. This leads to a spatial distribution of egg batches with high mortality risk, and therefore lower population growth. Knowledge of the MRD in other species should be a highly effective means of predicting trends in population dynamics. Species with high divergence between their actual spatial distribution and their MRD may display relatively stable dynamics at low population levels. In contrast, species with low divergence should experience high levels of intragenerational population growth leading to frequent habitat-wide outbreaks and unstable dynamics in the long term. Six hypotheses, erected under the framework of spatial interference, are discussed, and future tests are suggested...|$|E
