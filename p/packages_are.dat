5|$|Debian 6.0 (Squeeze) was {{released}} in February 2011, introduced Debian GNU/kFreeBSD as a technology preview, featured a dependency-based boot system, and moved problematic firmware to the non-free area.

5|$|Unstable, always codenamed sid, is the trunk. <b>Packages</b> <b>are</b> {{accepted}} without {{checking the}} distribution as a whole. This branch is usually run by software developers {{who participate in}} a project and need the latest libraries available, and by those who prefer bleeding-edge software. Debian does not provide full Sid installation discs, but rather a minimal ISO {{that can be used}} to install over a network connection. Additionally, this branch can be installed through a system upgrade from stable or testing.|$|E

25|$|Ubuntu <b>{{packages}}</b> <b>are</b> {{based on}} packages from Debian's unstable branch. Both distributions use Debian's deb package format and package management tools (e.g. APT and Ubuntu Software). Debian and Ubuntu <b>packages</b> <b>are</b> not necessarily binary compatible with each other, however; packages {{may need to}} be rebuilt from source to be used in Ubuntu. Many Ubuntu developers are also maintainers of key packages within Debian. Ubuntu cooperates with Debian by pushing changes back to Debian, although there has been criticism that this does not happen often enough. Ian Murdock, the founder of Debian, had expressed concern about Ubuntu packages potentially diverging too far from Debian to remain compatible. Before release, <b>packages</b> <b>are</b> imported from Debian unstable continuously and merged with Ubuntu-specific modifications. One month before release, imports are frozen, and packagers then work to ensure that the frozen features interoperate well together.|$|E

25|$|Virgin Broadband {{employs a}} form of {{bandwidth}} throttling whereby customer bandwidth is reduced temporarily after a threshold is reached during peak periods. The company has experimented with and revised all parameters involved in the throttling, such as threshold size, peak period definitions, throttling percentage and duration. Separate thresholds are applied to upstream and downstream, and thresholds vary between packages. From 28 February 2014, Virgin Media announced that they were scrapping traffic management for downstream traffic on 30Mb or higher packages, which was welcomed by many customers. As a result of this, 30Mb or higher <b>packages</b> <b>are</b> only throttled on the upstream, where as 20Mb or below <b>packages</b> <b>are</b> throttled on both the upstream and the downstream.|$|E
