50|$|Holland has {{produced}} a variety of acoustic, digital, and electronic music. In the 1970s he developed a compositional technique known as integer music that features integer groups in which an integer represents a group of musical tones, each operating independently of other groups. The integer groups generally range from 1 thru 26 tones, which conveniently correlates with the English alphabet, {{making it possible to}} construct musical scores that are based on specific non-musical ideas. The player is asked to provide specific tones within each group, while the composer creates the form and structure of the work, typically supplying remarks as to how each group is to be expressed. Many of the composer’s scores, including music for solo instruments (with and without signal <b>processing),</b> <b>chamber</b> music, and music for voice, involve the use of integer notation.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new model for Cluster-tools with two load locks. Cluster-tools are widely used to {{automate}} single wafer processing in semiconductor industry. The load locks are the entry points into the vacuum of the Cluster-tool's mainframe. Usually there are two of them available. Each lot being processed, is dedicated to a single load-lock. Therefore at most two different lots (with possibly different processing times and qualification) can be processed simultaneously. This restriction {{is one of the}} major potential bottlenecks. Capacity planning is one of the possible applications for the proposed model and the paper demonstrates the integration into a more general framework that considers different tool types and different operational modes. The paper also generalizes an earlier model that is limited to three <b>processing</b> <b>chambers.</b> The proposed modeling approach is based on makespan reductions by parallel processing.

In FINCH, a 5 - 10 lpm sample air flow is introduced into the supersaturation zone at {{the upper end of}} the annular <b>processing</b> <b>chamber</b> (Figure 1). Here, supersaturation (with respect to water or ice) is produced by the mixing of particle-free warm, humidified air and cold dry air. Temperature and supersaturation are actively controlled using PID (Proportional Integral Derivative) algorithms with measurements of temperature and frost point as process variables. IN and CCN are activated and grow to macroscopic ice crystals or supercooled water droplets of 5 to 10 µm size as the sample travels along the annular <b>processing</b> <b>chamber</b> of about 1 m length. With a new developed optical detector it is possible to distinguish between supercooled droplets and ice particles, in order to obtain the number concentrations of CCN and IN.

40|$|Prognostics is {{the ability}} to predict the {{remaining}} useful life of a specific system, or component, and represents a key enabler of any effective condition-based-maintenance strategy. Among methods for performing prognostics such as regression and artificial neural networks, particle filters are emerging as a technique with considerable potential. Particle filters employ both a state dynamic model and a measurement model, which are used together to predict the evolution of the state probability distribution function. The approach has similarities to Kalman filtering, however, particle filters make no assumptions that the state dynamic model be linear or that Gaussian noise assumptions must hold true. The technique is applied in predicting the degradation of thermal processing units used in the treatment of waste gases from semiconductor <b>processing</b> <b>chambers.</b> The performance of the technique demonstrates the potential of particle filters as a robust method for accurately predicting system failure. In addition to the use of particle filters, Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) are employed to extract signals associated with the different operating modes from a multi-modal signal generated by the operating characteristics of the thermal processing unit...|$|R
40|$|A rotor that accepts and {{automatically}} processes a bulk aliquot {{of a single}} blood sample into multiple aliquots of plasma has been designed and built. The rotor consists of a central processing unit, which includes a disk containing eight precision-bore capillaries. By varying the internal diameters of the capillaries, aliquot volumes ranging 1 to 10 μl can be prepared.

40|$|Abstract—Cluster tools, each {{of which}} {{consists}} of several single-wafer <b>processing</b> <b>chambers</b> and a wafer handling robot, have been increasingly used for diverse wafer fabrication processes. Processes such as some low pressure chemical vapor deposition processes re-quire strict timing control. Unless a wafer processed at a chamber for such a process leaves the chamber within a specified time limit, the wafer is subject to quality problems due to residual gases and heat. We address the scheduling problem for such time-constrained dual-armed cluster tools that have diverse wafer flow patterns. We propose a systematic method of determining the schedulable process time range for which there exists a feasible schedule that satisfies the time constraints. We explain how to select the desir-able process times within the schedulable process time range. We present a method of determining the tool operation schedule. For more flexible scheduling under the time constraints, we propose a modification of the conventional swap operation {{in order to allow}} wafer delay on a robot arm during a swap operation. We compare the performance of the new swap strategy with that of the conven-tional swap strategy. Index Terms—Cluster tool, scheduling, swap, time constraint. I...|$|R
