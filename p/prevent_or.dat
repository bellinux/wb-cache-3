This treatment is finding modern usage in some hospitals. Recently insects have also gained attention as potential sources of drugs and other medicinal substances. Adult insects, such as crickets and insect larvae of various kinds, are also commonly used as fishing bait.|$|E
5|$|Many {{projects}} aim to <b>prevent</b> <b>or</b> slow {{this loss}} by revitalizing endangered languages and promoting education and literacy in minority languages.

A 2014 review of research concluded that there was evidence that consumption of citrus fruits and curcumin reduced risk of pancreatic cancer, while there was possibly a beneficial effect from whole grains, folate, selenium, and non-fried fish.|$|E

5|$|Both {{environmental}} factors and genetics {{are associated with}} alcoholism with about half the risk attributed to each. A person with a parent or sibling with alcoholism is {{three to four times}} more likely to be alcoholic themselves. Environmental factors include social, cultural, and behavioral influences. High stress levels, anxiety, as well as inexpensive easily accessible alcohol increases risk. People may continue to drink partly to <b>prevent</b> <b>or</b> improve symptoms of withdrawal. A low level of withdrawal may last for months following stopping. Medically, alcoholism is considered both a physical and mental illness. Both questionnaires and certain blood tests may detect people with possible alcoholism. Further information is then collected to confirm the diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|Burston {{believed}} in personal reconnaissance and {{leading from the}} front. He was {{at the forefront of}} providing the medical arrangements for Operation Compass. He attempted, in the face of equipment shortages, to anticipate medical problems and so far as possible to <b>prevent</b> <b>or</b> avoid them. He dispatched Major Ian Murray Mackerras to investigate fly breeding in order to prevent an outbreak of diarrhoea. Burston gave Mackerras a free hand to tackle hygiene problems.|$|E
5|$|Cleansing asanas {{are those}} that when practiced for {{short periods of time}} help the body <b>prevent</b> <b>or</b> correct {{internal}} imbalances and tone inner organs; while meditative asanas are those postures, either sitting or standing, that one can maintain steadily and comfortably for extended periods of time. In both, a proper posture is achieved when one can combine relaxed steadiness with deep breathing exercises. Such comfortable and stable asanas are necessary for cleansing of the Nadi (blood vessels) through the Pranayama stage of yoga. This view is shared by other yoga texts, such as in verse 5.2 of Gheranda Samhita. The Padmasana (lotus position) is esteemed for both cleansing and meditative contemplation.|$|E

5|$|Poverty can {{increase}} the risk of malaria since those in poverty do not have the financial capacities to <b>prevent</b> <b>or</b> treat the disease. In its entirety, the economic impact of malaria has been estimated to cost Africa US$12 billion every year. The economic impact includes costs of health care, working days lost due to sickness, days lost in education, decreased productivity due to brain damage from cerebral malaria, and loss of investment and tourism. The disease has a heavy burden in some countries, where it may be responsible for 30–50% of hospital admissions, up to 50% of outpatient visits, and up to 40% of public health spending.|$|E
5|$|Smallpox {{vaccination}} {{within three}} days of exposure will <b>prevent</b> <b>or</b> significantly lessen the severity of smallpox symptoms {{in the vast majority}} of people. Vaccination four to seven days after exposure can offer some protection from disease or may modify the severity of disease. Other than vaccination, treatment of smallpox is primarily supportive, such as wound care and infection control, fluid therapy, and possible ventilator assistance. Flat and hemorrhagic types of smallpox are treated with the same therapies used to treat shock, such as fluid resuscitation. People with semi-confluent and confluent types of smallpox may have therapeutic issues similar to patients with extensive skin burns.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of drugs that can help <b>prevent</b> <b>or</b> {{interrupt}} malaria in travelers to places where infection is common. Many of these drugs are also used in treatment. Chloroquine may be used where chloroquine-resistant parasites are not common. In places where Plasmodium is resistant to one or more medications, three medications—mefloquine (Lariam), doxycycline (available generically), or the combination of atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride (Malarone)—are frequently used when prophylaxis is needed. Doxycycline and the atovaquone plus proguanil combination are the best tolerated; mefloquine is associated with death, suicide, and neurological and psychiatric symptoms.|$|E

Head of the SAO Krajina civilian authorities in Dubica, Branko Dmitrović and the commander of SAO Krajina TO in Kostajnica, Slobodan Borojević, were sentenced to 15 years in prison each under the command responsibility for failing to <b>prevent</b> <b>or</b> punish the crime.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{their failure}} to score any hits, the American torpedo attacks {{achieved}} three important results. First, they kept the Japanese carriers off balance and unable to prepare and launch their own counterstrike. Second, the poor control of the Japanese combat air patrol (CAP) meant {{they were out of}} position for subsequent attacks. Third, many of the Zeros ran low on ammunition and fuel. The appearance of a third torpedo plane attack from the southeast by VT-3 from Yorktown at 10:00 very quickly drew the majority of the Japanese CAP to the southeast quadrant of the fleet. Better discipline, and the employment of a greater number of Zeroes for the CAP might have enabled Nagumo to <b>prevent</b> (<b>or</b> at least mitigate) the damage caused by the coming American attacks.|$|E
5|$|While all the {{reaction}} mechanisms {{of these species}} within the body are not yet fully understood, {{one of the most}} reactive products of oxidative stress is the hydroxyl radical (·OH), which can initiate a damaging chain reaction of lipid peroxidation in the unsaturated lipids within cell membranes. High concentrations of oxygen also increase the formation of other free radicals, such as nitric oxide, peroxynitrite, and trioxidane, which harm DNA and other biomolecules. Although the body has many antioxidant systems such as glutathione that guard against oxidative stress, these systems are eventually overwhelmed at very high concentrations of free oxygen, and the rate of cell damage exceeds the capacity of the systems that <b>prevent</b> <b>or</b> repair it. Cell damage and cell death then result.|$|E
