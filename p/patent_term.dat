His first and most successful patents concerning flour-milling proved the most problematic to defend, and Evans' battles proved influential in setting precedent for the newly established area of federal patent law. His original patent for his automated flour-mill expired in January 1805, but Evans believed that the fourteen year <b>patent</b> <b>term</b> was too brief and petitioned the Congress to extend it. In January 1808 An Act for the Relief of Oliver Evans was passed and signed by President Jefferson, a long-time admirer of Evans's work. The act took the extraordinary step of reviving to Evans his expired patent and giving it another fourteen year term— Evans was delighted, but the move was to highly problematic, particularly regarding those who had implemented Evans's designs in the intervening three year period between the patent terms, as many millers had waited for Evans's patent to expire before upgrading their mills.|$|E

40|$|Retrieving {{research}} papers and patents {{is important for}} any researcher assessing the scope of a field with high industrial relevance. However, the <b>terms</b> used in <b>patents</b> are often more abstract or creative than those used in {{research papers}}, because {{they are intended to}} widen the scope of claims. Therefore, a method is required for translating scholarly <b>terms</b> into <b>patent</b> <b>terms.</b> In this paper, we propose six methods for translating scholarly <b>terms</b> into <b>patent</b> <b>terms</b> using two synonym extraction methods: a statistical machine translation (SMT) -based method and a distributional similarity (DS) -based method. We conducted experiments to confirm the effectiveness of our method using the dataset of the Patent Mining Task from the NTCIR- 7 Workshop. The aim of the task was to classify Japanese language research papers (pairs of titles and abstracts) using the IPC system at the subclass (third level), main group (fourth level), and subgroup (the fifth and most detailed level). The results showed that an SMT-based method (SMT_ABST+IDF) performed best at the subgroup level, whereas a DS-based method (DS+IDF) performed best at the subclass level...|$|R

40|$|Terminologies are {{becoming}} more important to modern day society as technology and science continue to grow at an accelerating rate in a globalized environment. Agreeing upon which terms {{should be used to}} represent which concepts and how those terms should be translated into different languages is important if we wish to be able to communicate with as little confusion and misunderstandings as possible. Since the 1990 s, an increasing amount of terminology research has been devoted to facilitating and augmenting terminology-related tasks by using computers and computational methods. One focus for this research is Automatic Term Extraction (ATE). In this compilation thesis, studies on both bilingual and monolingual ATE are presented. First, two publications reporting on how bilingual ATE using the align-extract approach can be used to extract <b>patent</b> <b>terms.</b> The result in this case was 181, 000 manually validated English-Swedish <b>patent</b> <b>terms</b> which were to be used in a machine translation system for patent documents.

5000|$|In Canada, the Supreme Court has {{indicated}} {{that there are two}} branches of double patenting.

50|$|A {{terminal}} disclaimer is {{a process}} by which a <b>patent's</b> <b>term</b> is shortened because it duplicates the claims of another patent which expires sooner. If any claim of a pending patent application is obvious in light {{of at least one}} claim of the applicant's issued patents, the applicant may be required by the USPTO to disclaim a part of the term of the pending application. For example, an applicant's patent A expires on December 24, 2000. The applicant filed another patent application two years later. Under some conditions, the second patent might expire later than the first (based upon the respective earliest claimed priority dates). If the applicant is required to file, and does file, a terminal disclaimer in the later filed patent, then the later filed patent will expire {{at the same time as}} the earlier filed <b>patent,</b> the extra <b>term</b> having been disclaimed ("terminal disclaimer"). In filing the terminal disclaimer, the later filed patent and the earlier filed patent must be, and remain, commonly owned.|$|R
