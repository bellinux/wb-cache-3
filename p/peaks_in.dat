5|$|The {{southern}} {{section of}} the forest in the Wind River Range is the primary destination for mountain climbers. Nine of the highest 10 <b>peaks</b> <b>in</b> Wyoming are here, and the mountains are primarily of granitic rock with countless cliffs and sheer rock walls. The Cirque of the Towers is particularly popular as it has numerous peaks within a relatively short distance of each other. Two particular climbs on the <b>peaks</b> <b>in</b> the cirque are considered amongst the finest climbing adventures available in the U.S. The Absaroka Range also attracts climbers but not of a technical nature since the rocks are not considered solid enough for good anchoring points. For the tallest <b>peaks</b> <b>in</b> the Wind River Range, the entire summiting effort will take even experienced climbers many days due to the inaccessibility {{of the region and}} complexity of the climbing effort.|$|E

5|$|As {{with most}} of the northeastern United States, the number of tornadoes <b>peaks</b> <b>in</b> the summer months, {{normally}} in July or August. Hartford County has had the most tornadoes in the state, although since 1950 Litchfield County has reported the most tornadoes.

5|$|In the Northern Atlantic Ocean, a {{distinct}} cyclone season occurs from June 1 to November 30, sharply peaking from late August through September. The statistical {{peak of the}} Atlantic hurricane season is September 10. The Northeast Pacific Ocean has a broader period of activity, but in a similar time frame to the Atlantic. The Northwest Pacific sees tropical cyclones year-round, with a minimum in February and March and a peak in early September. In the North Indian basin, storms are most common from April to December, with <b>peaks</b> <b>in</b> May and November. In the Southern Hemisphere, the tropical cyclone year begins on July 1 and runs all year-round encompassing the tropical cyclone seasons, which run from November 1 {{until the end of}} April, with <b>peaks</b> <b>in</b> mid-February to early March.|$|E
5|$|Note {{that many}} optical <b>peaks</b> <b>in</b> diamond accidentally have similar {{spectral}} positions, which causes much confusion among gemologists.

5|$|Worldwide, {{tropical}} cyclone activity <b>peaks</b> <b>in</b> late summer, when {{the difference between}} temperatures aloft and sea surface temperatures is the greatest. However, each particular basin has its own seasonal patterns. On a worldwide scale, May is the least active month, while September is the most active month. November is the only month {{in which all the}} {{tropical cyclone}} basins are active.|$|E
5|$|Across Australia, {{breeding}} {{takes place}} anywhere from July to February, though <b>peaks</b> <b>in</b> October, and is generally earlier in more northern areas.

5|$|Consonants and vowel {{segments}} {{combine to}} form syllables, {{which in turn}} combine to form utterances; these can be distinguished phonetically as the space between two inhalations. Acoustically, these different segments are characterized by different formant structures, that are visible in a spectrogram of the recorded sound wave (See illustration of Spectrogram of the formant structures of three English vowels). Formants are the amplitude <b>peaks</b> <b>in</b> the frequency spectrum of a specific sound.|$|E

5|$|Crystals {{are often}} {{idealized}} as being perfectly periodic. In that ideal case, the atoms are positioned on a perfect lattice, the electron density is perfectly periodic, and the Fourier transform F(q) is zero except when q {{belongs to the}} reciprocal lattice (the so-called Bragg <b>peaks).</b> <b>In</b> reality, however, crystals are not perfectly periodic; atoms vibrate about their mean position, {{and there may be}} disorder of various types, such as mosaicity, dislocations, various point defects, and heterogeneity in the conformation of crystallized molecules. Therefore, the Bragg peaks have a finite width and there may be significant diffuse scattering, a continuum of scattered X-rays that fall between the Bragg peaks.|$|E
5|$|Dromedaries {{are mainly}} active during {{daylight}} hours. They form herds of about 20 individuals, which {{are led by}} a dominant male. This camel feeds on foliage and desert vegetation; several adaptations, {{such as the ability}} to tolerate losing more than 30% of its total water content, allow it to thrive in its desert habitat. Mating occurs annually and <b>peaks</b> <b>in</b> the rainy season; females bear a single calf after a gestation of 15 months.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{diffusion}} damping produces {{its effects}} {{independent of the}} cosmological model being studied, thereby masking the effects of other, model-dependent phenomena. This means that without an accurate model of diffusion damping, scientists cannot judge {{the relative merits of}} cosmological models, whose theoretical predictions cannot be compared with observational data, this data being obscured by damping effects. For example, the <b>peaks</b> <b>in</b> the power spectrum due to acoustic oscillations are decreased in amplitude by diffusion damping. This deamplification of the power spectrum hides features of the curve, features that would otherwise be more visible.|$|E

5|$|Indiana {{participated in}} the {{mobilization}} of the nation's economy and resources. Domestically, the state produced munitions in an army plant near Sellersburg. The P-47 fighter-plane was manufactured in Evansville at Republic Aviation. The steel produced in northern Indiana was used in tanks, battleships, and submarines. Other war-related materials were produced throughout the state. Indiana's military bases were activated, with areas such as Camp Atterbury reaching historical <b>peaks</b> <b>in</b> activity.|$|E
5|$|Since camels have a {{slow growth}} rate; they reach sexual {{maturity}} only in advanced years. The age of sexual maturity varies geographically and {{depends on the}} individual, as does the reproductive period. Both sexes might mature by {{three to five years}} of age, though successful breeding could take longer. Mating occurs once a year, and <b>peaks</b> <b>in</b> the rainy season. The mating season lasts three to five months, but may last a year for older animals.|$|E
