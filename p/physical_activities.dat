The aim was to identify predictors of <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> that were relatively consistent across three different measures of <b>physical</b> <b>activity,</b> in pre- and early adolescent South Australians.

40|$|Objective To test a {{conceptual}} model linking parental <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> orientations, parental support for <b>physical</b> <b>activity,</b> and children's self-efficacy perceptions with <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> participation. Participants and setting The {{sample consisted of}} 380 students in grades 7 through 12 (mean age, 14. 0 ± 1. 6 years) and their parents. Data collection {{took place during the}} fall of 1996. Main outcome measures Parents completed a questionnaire assessing their <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> habits, enjoyment of <b>physical</b> <b>activity,</b> beliefs regarding the importance of <b>physical</b> <b>activity,</b> and supportive behaviors for their child's <b>physical</b> <b>activity.</b> Students completed a 46 -item inventory assessing <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> during the previous 7 days and a 5 -item <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> self-efficacy scale. The model was tested via observed variable path analysis using structural equation modeling techniques (AMOS 4. 0). Results An initial model, in which parent <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> orientations predicted child <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> via parental support and child self-efficacy, did not provide an acceptable fit to the data. Inclusion of a direct path from parental support to child <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> and deletion of a nonsignificant path from parental <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> to child <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> significantly improved model fit.

5|$|Plant {{physiology}} encompasses all {{the internal}} chemical and <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> of plants associated with life. Chemicals {{obtained from the}} air, soil and water {{form the basis of}} all plant metabolism. The energy of sunlight, captured by oxygenic photosynthesis and released by cellular respiration, is the basis of almost all life. Photoautotrophs, including all green plants, algae and cyanobacteria gather energy directly from sunlight by photosynthesis. Heterotrophs including all animals, all fungi, all completely parasitic plants, and non-photosynthetic bacteria take in organic molecules produced by photoautotrophs and respire them or use them in the construction of cells and tissues. Respiration is the oxidation of carbon compounds by breaking them down into simpler structures to release the energy they contain, essentially the opposite of photosynthesis.|$|E
5|$|For {{those who}} are single when injured or who become single, SCI causes {{difficulties}} and insecurities with respect to one's ability to meet new partners and start relationships. In some settings, beauty standards cause people to view disabled bodies as less attractive, limiting the options for sexual and romantic partners {{of people with disabilities}} like SCI. Furthermore, physical disabilities are stigmatized, causing people to avoid contact with disabled people, particularly those with highly visible conditions like SCI. The stigma may cause people with SCI to experience self-consciousness and embarrassment in public. They can increase their social success by using impression management techniques to change how they are perceived and create a more positive image of themselves in others' eyes. Physical limitations create difficulties; with lowered independence comes reduced social interaction and fewer opportunities to find partners. Difficulties with mobility and the lack of disabled accessibility of social spaces (e.g. lack of wheelchair ramps) create a further barrier to social activity and limit the ability to meet partners. Isolation and its associated risk of depression can be limited by participating in <b>physical</b> <b>activities,</b> social gatherings, clubs, and online chat and dating.|$|E

40|$|<b>Physical</b> <b>activity,</b> is an {{integral}} health promoting behavior that patients should receive counseling on to improve or maintain their health. Counseling in the clinical setting is a strategy recommended to increase <b>physical</b> <b>activity.</b> Student nurses who receive appropriate education and practice related to <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> counseling can potentially impact the effort to promote <b>physical</b> <b>activity.</b> Purpose: The {{purpose of this study}} was to explore undergraduate baccalaureate nursing student’s knowledge, self-efficacy, beliefs and practices for engaging in <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> counseling. Methods: Baccalaureate undergraduate nursing students (N = 539) were surveyed to examine 1) knowledge of the current <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> guidelines, 2) self-efficacy in counseling patients on <b>physical</b> <b>activity,</b> and 3) beliefs and practices related to <b>physical</b> <b>activity.</b> Additionally, the influence of the student’s academic status, type of program in which they are enrolled and their personal engagement in <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> was explored to determine the effect on factors one through 3. Results: 48 % of the students would recommend an amount of <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> that is consistent with the current <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> guidelines. Self-efficacy for <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> counseling was moderate-to-strong despite reporting limited opportunities to engage in <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> counseling. Students (97 %) reported that <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> counseling was a role of the nurse. <b>Physical</b> <b>activity</b> counseling was ranked 4 th among 9 other lifestyle behaviors requiring counseling but was not a priority when ranked amongst 9 other nursing care responsibilities (ranked 9 th). The academic status of the student did influence the student knowledge of the guidelines, their self-efficacy, beliefs and practices. The program in which the student was enrolled influenced self-efficacy, with second degree program reporting more self-efficacy for <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> counseling than traditional nursing program. The nursing student’s personal <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> engagement did influence their self-efficacy and prioritization given to <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> counseling; however, the pattern of these findings was inconsistent. Conclusion: Modifications to nursing curricula may be required to enable the nursing student to gain better knowledge, skills and experiences related to counseling patients on <b>physical</b> <b>activity.</b> This would be important for effective <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> counseling within health care settings...|$|R

RESULTS: Combining yearly cohorts from 1999 to 2009, we found a significant trend for increased <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> levels. Weekly age and sex adjusted 3 +MET-minutes per week increased from 3023 to 3752, between 1999 and 2009 (P= 0. 02).
