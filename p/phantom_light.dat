After working for several lighting businesses, Kretzschmar moved into a steady role with Rulon Electric, a Houston-based contractor. During his time with Rulon, Kretzschmar worked on high-end residential lighting installations. This experience inspired Kretzschmar to improve on lighting technologies that were non-standardized. It was during this time that Kretzschmar invented adjustable shelving lighting technology and the contour lighting projector. In 1981, Kretzschmar founded <b>Phantom</b> <b>Lighting,</b> an art lighting supplier that provides his proprietary technologies to installers.

60|$|So it {{came about}} that one night, as they were {{sleeping}} together under their huddle, as was their custom, Thumb, who had been nibbling fruit nearly all day long, cried out in a loud and terrible voice in his sleep, till Thimble, half awakened by his raving, picked up his thick cudgel and laid it soundly across his brother's shoulders where he lay. Thumb started up out of his sleep, and in an instant the two brothers were up and at each other, wrestling and kicking, gnashing their teeth, and guzzling through their throats and noses like mere Gungas, Mullabruks, or Manquabees. Poor Nod, not knowing what {{was the cause of}} all the trouble, got a much worse drubbing than either, till at last, in their furious struggling, all three brothers rolled from under the wattles into the pale glimmering of the stars and snow. For in this valley after the sun goes moves a <b>phantom</b> <b>light</b> or phosphorescence over the snow. Brought suddenly to their senses by the chill dark air, the travellers sat dimly glaring one at another, hunched, bruised, and breathless. And Nod, seeing his brothers so enraged, and preparing to fight again, and having had half his senses battered out by their rough usage, asked what was amiss.|$|E
60|$|Naturally, {{with her}} face, position, and background, she had {{experience}} {{of young men}} who wished to marry her, and made protestations of love, but, perhaps {{because she did not}} return the feeling, it remained something of a pageant to her. Not having experience of it herself, her mind had unconsciously occupied itself for some years in dressing up an image of love, and the marriage that was the outcome of love, and the man who inspired love, which naturally dwarfed any examples that came her way. Easily, and without correction by reason, her imagination made pictures, superb backgrounds casting a rich though <b>phantom</b> <b>light</b> upon the facts in the foreground. Splendid as the waters that drop with resounding thunder from high ledges of rock, and plunge downwards into the blue depths of night, was the presence of love she dreamt, drawing into it every drop of the force of life, and dashing them all asunder in the superb catastrophe in which everything was surrendered, and nothing might be reclaimed. The man, too, was some magnanimous hero, riding a great horse by the shore of the sea. They rode through forests together, they galloped by the rim of the sea. But waking, she was able to contemplate a perfectly loveless marriage, as the thing one did actually in real life, for possibly the people who dream thus are those who do the most prosaic things.|$|E

50|$|The route {{serves as}} the main road from Morganton to Northern Burke County then on towards Newland in Avery County. The first 12 mi of the road appears as a regular back road highway, going by homes and {{shrubbery}} farms. At Brown Mountain Beach Road, the sharp bend of the highway starts the climb up through the Pisgah National Forest to Jonas Ridge. This 13 mi section of the highway features multiple curves (some tight with speed warnings), multiple passing lanes (five up, two down, one turnoff down), and mostly undeveloped wooded lands. Before Jonas Ridge is the Brown Mountain Overlook, where stories of <b>phantom</b> <b>lights</b> on the mountain {{can be seen from}} the location. After Jonas Ridge, the highway goes parallel with the Blue Ridge Park for a mile before passing over it. In Pineola, the highway overlaps with U.S. Route 221 (US 221) for almost 3 mi before splitting in Linville. The last section of the highway goes by several hills and mountains covered by Fraser firs before entering the Newland city limits and ending at NC 194 (Pineola Street).|$|R
60|$|The <b>phantoms</b> of <b>light</b> {{and sound}} {{seemed to have}} become real.

50|$|Artistic {{concerns}} motivated further {{deviations from}} historical (and physical) accuracy. For example, the boat (of the wrong model) looks {{too small to}} carry all occupants and stay afloat, but this emphasizes the struggle of the rowing soldiers. There are <b>phantom</b> <b>light</b> sources besides the upcoming sun, {{as can be seen}} {{on the face of the}} front rower and shadows on the water, to add depth. The crossing took place in the dead of night, so there ought to have been little natural light, but this would have made for a very different painting. The river is modeled after the Rhine, where ice tends to form in jagged chunks as pictured, not in broad sheets as is more common on the Delaware. Also, the Delaware at what is now called Washington Crossing is far narrower than the river depicted in the painting. It was also raining during the crossing. Next, the men did not bring horses or field guns across the river in the boats, but instead had them transported by ferries. Finally, Washington's stance, obviously intended to depict him in a heroic fashion, would have been very hard to maintain in the stormy conditions of the crossing. Considering that he is standing in a rowboat, such a stance would have risked capsizing the boat. However, historian David Hackett Fischer has argued that everyone would have been standing up to avoid the icy water in the bottom of the boat (the actual Durham boats used have higher sides).|$|E
