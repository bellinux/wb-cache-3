5|$|Pink-flowering <b>populations</b> <b>have</b> a {{relatively}} distinct genetic makeup, whereas red or white flowering <b>populations</b> <b>have</b> more evident sharing of genetic traits. Research based on DNA profiling has revealed substantial genetic diversity {{within and between}} flower colour races and site populations. This has implications for vegetation projects in that provenance material needs to be collected from a wide geographic area to maintain this diversity.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with other}} Estrildines, these species {{are thought to}} have {{originated}} in Asia. The species has been introduced {{to other parts of the}} world due to its popularity as a cage bird and <b>populations</b> <b>have</b> established in the wild.|$|E
5|$|In the Pacific Northwest, {{wild salmon}} stocks, a main {{resident}} food source, have declined dramatically in recent years. On {{the west coast}} of Alaska and the Aleutian Islands, seal and sea lion <b>populations</b> <b>have</b> also substantially declined.|$|E
50|$|Per city data, 90.5% of the <b>population</b> <b>has</b> a {{high school}} degree or higher. 43.5% of the <b>population</b> <b>has</b> a bachelor's degree or higher. 17.3% of the <b>population</b> <b>has</b> a {{graduate}} or professional degree. These are the highest education percentages of any municipality in Florida.|$|R
50|$|Population of {{the village}} has {{increased}} by 3.5% in last 10 years. In 2001 census total population here were 4209. Female population growth rate {{of the village}} is 3.8% which is 0.6% higher than male population growth rate of 3.2%. General caste <b>population</b> <b>has</b> decreased by -2.4%; Schedule caste <b>population</b> <b>has</b> increased by 14.1%; Schedule Tribe <b>population</b> <b>has</b> increased by 2.7% and child <b>population</b> <b>has</b> decreased by -11.9% in the village since last census.|$|R
50|$|Population of the sub {{district}} {{has increased by}} 17.3% in last 10 years. In 2001 census total population here were about 1.4 lakh. Female population growth rate of the sub district is 16.7% which is -1.2% lower than male population growth rate of 17.9%. General caste <b>population</b> <b>has</b> increased by 16.4%; Schedule caste <b>population</b> <b>has</b> increased by 21.9%; Schedule Tribe <b>population</b> <b>has</b> increased by 53.4% and child <b>population</b> <b>has</b> increased by 15.3% in the sub district since last census.|$|R
5|$|Wolf populations {{throughout}} Northern and Central Asia {{are largely}} unknown, but are estimated {{in the hundreds}} of thousands based on annual harvests. Since the fall of the Soviet Union, continent-wide extermination of wolves has ceased, and wolf <b>populations</b> <b>have</b> increased to about 25,000–30,000 animals throughout the former Soviet Union. In China and Mongolia, wolves are only protected in reserves. Mongolian <b>populations</b> <b>have</b> been estimated at 10,000–30,000, while the status of wolves in China is more fragmentary. The north has a declining population of an estimated 400 wolves, while Xinjiang and Tibet hold about 10,000 and 2,000 respectively.|$|E
5|$|Another {{reason for}} DNA testing was to {{determine}} the rates of hybridization between pallid and shovelnose sturgeon. The southern <b>populations</b> <b>have</b> more hybrids than are found in the middle sections of the Missouri River basin, while the northernmost <b>populations</b> <b>have</b> had few reports of hybrids. Hybrids are most common in the Atchafalaya River in Louisiana, and DNA sequencing in these hybrids showed a genetic distinction from pallid sturgeon, but based on the genetic markers assessed, they were genetically indistinguishable from shovelnose sturgeon. Because of this ability of two species to hybridize, some biologists have expressed concern that it is a violation of the Endangered Species Act to protect one species that may not be genetically isolated from another. It is not known if the hybrids are able to reproduce or not, although they appear {{to be the result of}} pallid sturgeon eggs being fertilized by shovelnose sturgeon males.|$|E
5|$|B. verticillata is {{significantly}} threatened {{by at least}} three microorganisms. Several <b>populations</b> <b>have</b> reduced or vanished from dieback (Phytophthora cinnamomi), such as those at Two Peoples Bay Nature Reserve and Gull Rock National Park. The honey fungus Armillaria luteobubalina has killed plants in Torndirrup National Park, and aerial canker (Zythiostroma) has decimated populations at Waychinicup National Park east of Albany.|$|E
50|$|In 2008, 98 {{percent of}} the <b>population</b> <b>had</b> access to an {{improved}} water source. Ninety-six {{percent of the}} <b>population</b> <b>have</b> access to improved sanitation facilities.|$|R
50|$|In 2004, 89% of the <b>population</b> <b>had</b> running water; it was {{forecast}} {{that the}} number would raise to 95% by 2006. In 2001, 63.5% of the <b>population</b> <b>had</b> basic sanitation; it was forecast {{that the number}} would raise to 80% by 2008. In 2001, 100% of the <b>population</b> <b>had</b> access to waste management services.|$|R
25|$|Palmyra {{continued}} to grow steadily through the 19th & 20th Centuries. By 1845, the settlement consisted of 160 people in about 20 dwellings. By 1875, the <b>population</b> <b>had</b> increased to 500 people in about 100 dwellings. By 1890, the <b>population</b> <b>had</b> skyrocketed in just fifteen years to 1,760 people. And by 1960, the <b>population</b> <b>had</b> reached 7,000.|$|R
5|$|In {{general the}} species is in decline, more quickly on the {{mainland}} than on the outlying islets. The Cuban mainland <b>populations</b> <b>have</b> been declining {{at a rate of}} over 1% per year for the last 10years. The Cuban iguana is no longer found on the northeastern coast of Havana, the Hicacos Peninsula, or Cayo Largo, areas where it was found in great numbers some 30 to 40years ago.|$|E
5|$|MFGM {{may also}} play a role in {{supporting}} cardiovascular health by modulating cholesterol and fat uptake. Clinical trials in adult <b>populations</b> <b>have</b> shown that MFGM could positively affect markers associated with cardiovascular disease including lowering serum cholesterol and triacylglycerol levels as well as blood pressure.|$|E
5|$|Murray cod <b>populations</b> <b>have</b> {{declined}} severely since European colonisation of Australia due to {{a number}} of causes, including severe overfishing, river regulation, and habitat degradation and are now a listed threatened species. However, they once inhabited almost the entire Murray-Darling basin, Australia's largest river system, in very great numbers.|$|E
50|$|Sanitation is a {{major factor}} in {{relation}} to infectious diseases. Although 96% of the urban <b>population</b> <b>has</b> access to improved drinking water sources, in the rural areas it is only 86% 2. Similarly with regards to sanitation facilities, 94% of the urban <b>population</b> <b>has</b> access to sanitation facilities whereas only 87% of the rural <b>population</b> <b>has</b> such access 2.|$|R
50|$|Approximately 90% of the <b>population</b> <b>had</b> {{access to}} health care services. In 2000, 70% of the <b>population</b> <b>had</b> access to safe {{drinking}} water and 21% had adequate sanitation.|$|R
50|$|Prior to the 1992 War, Georgians made {{up nearly}} half of Abkhazia's {{population}}, while less than one-fifth {{of the population was}} Abkhaz. In contrast, in 1926 the two populations were nearly balanced at around one-third each, with Russians, Armenians and Greeks constituting the remainder. Large-scale immigration of Georgians, Russians and Armenians allowed their respective populations to balloon; while the Abkhaz <b>population</b> <b>had</b> not even doubled by 1989, the Georgian <b>population</b> <b>had</b> nearly quadrupled from 67,494 to 239,872, the Armenian <b>population</b> <b>had</b> tripled and the Russian <b>population</b> <b>had</b> sextupled.|$|R
5|$|Nonetheless, {{there were}} {{continuing}} gradual economic improvements, {{among the most}} visible {{of which was the}} replacement of the traditional thatched blackhouse with accommodation of a more modern design and in recent years, with the assistance of Highlands and Islands Enterprise many of the island's <b>populations</b> <b>have</b> begun to increase after decades of decline.|$|E
5|$|Predators such as foxes {{and cats}} prey on quolls and compete {{with them for}} food. For example, both quolls and foxes catch and consume rabbits. Since the {{introduction}} of foxes, quoll <b>populations</b> <b>have</b> dropped dramatically. Foxes have been eradicated {{from many of the}} islands off the coast of Australia in an effort to protect quolls.|$|E
5|$|The {{densities of}} wood turtle <b>populations</b> <b>have</b> also been studied. In the {{northern}} {{portion of its}} range (Quebec and other areas of Canada), populations are fairly dilute, containing an average of 0.44 individuals per , while in the south, over the same area, the densities varied largely from 6 to 90 turtles. In addition to this, {{it has been found}} that colonies often have more females than males.|$|E
50|$|Population of {{the city}} has {{increased}} by 16.9% in last 10 years. In 2001 census total population here were about 52 thousand. Female population growth rate {{of the city}} is 19.5% which is 5% higher than male population growth rate of 14.5%. General caste <b>population</b> <b>has</b> increased by 18%; Schedule caste <b>population</b> <b>has</b> increased by 16.7%; Schedule Tribe <b>population</b> <b>has</b> increased by 14% and child <b>population</b> <b>has</b> increased by 9.8% in the city since last census.63% of the whole population are from general caste, 13% are from schedule caste and 23% are schedule tribes.|$|R
50|$|Fezzan's <b>population</b> <b>has</b> grown rapidly {{since the}} mid-20th century {{along with the}} overall growth in Libya's population, and the province's share of the {{national}} <b>population</b> <b>has</b> increased by half.|$|R
25|$|Access {{to water}} and {{sanitation}} services has slowly risen {{over the years in}} Guatemala. In 1990, 81% of the total <b>population</b> <b>had</b> access to improved water sources, while in 2004, 90% of the <b>population</b> <b>had</b> access. Sanitation coverage has also risen, from 62% of the total <b>population</b> <b>having</b> access to adequate sanitation in 1990, to 86% with access in 2004.|$|R
5|$|The {{tiger shark}} is {{captured}} and killed for its fins, flesh, and liver. It is caught regularly in target and nontarget fisheries. Several <b>populations</b> <b>have</b> declined {{where they have}} been heavily fished. Continued demand for fins may result in further declines in the future. They are considered a near threatened species due to excessive finning and fishing by humans according to International Union for Conservation of Nature.|$|E
5|$|There are 27 known populations {{within this}} region, but only nine of these populations contain more than 10 {{individual}} plants, and only five <b>populations</b> <b>have</b> more than 100. Ten populations are now presumed extinct. The {{total number of}} plants is estimated at around 1000.|$|E
5|$|When {{vineyards}} in the south-west Cape started letting weeds grow between vines {{to conserve}} moisture, around 1956, the Cape sparrow moved in. Cape sparrows quickly exhausted {{the seeds and}} started eating the grapes. The Cape sparrow is now a serious pest in vineyards. However, vineyards are not optimal habitat: some <b>populations</b> <b>have</b> had such a low reproductive success {{that they could not}} be maintained without immigration.|$|E
50|$|In 2004 only a {{minority}} of Russians (8% of the <b>population)</b> <b>had</b> Internet access. In May 2008, some 32.7 million users in Russia had access to the Internet (almost 30% of the population). In 2012, 75.9 million Russians (53% of the <b>population)</b> <b>had</b> access. In December 2015, most part of country, 92.8 million Russians (70% of the <b>population)</b> <b>have</b> Internet access.|$|R

5|$|Although no {{subspecies}} are recognized, {{there are}} morphological differences in wood turtles between areas. Individuals {{found in the}} west of its geographic range (areas like the Great Lakes and the Midwest United States) have a paler complexion {{on the inside of}} the legs and underside of the neck than ones found in the east (places including the Appalachian Mountains, New York, and Pennsylvania). Genetic analysis has also revealed that southern <b>populations</b> <b>have</b> less genetic diversity than the northern; however, both exhibit a fair amount of diversity considering the decline in numbers that have occurred during previous ice ages.|$|E
5|$|Banksia cuneata was {{declared}} critically endangered after a 1982 survey found only five populations comprising about 450 plants. The largest population, consisting of around 300 plants, {{was on a}} conservation reserve, but all others were on road verges, and contained only 50–70 plants each. However, since then more plants have been located, and <b>populations</b> <b>have</b> {{been found to be}} gradually increasing in response to a number of conservation measures including fencing and baiting of rabbits. In recognition of its slight recovery, it is now considered endangered but no longer critically so.|$|E
5|$|Because of its slow {{reproductive}} rate, the {{dusky shark}} is very vulnerable to human-caused population depletion. This species is highly valued by commercial fisheries for its fins, used in shark fin soup, {{and for its}} meat, skin, and liver oil. It is also esteemed by recreational fishers. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Near Threatened worldwide and Vulnerable off the eastern United States, where <b>populations</b> <b>have</b> dropped to 1520% of 1970s levels. The dusky shark is regarded as potentially dangerous to humans due to its large size, but there are few attacks attributable to it.|$|E
