With her departs the amorous illusion that had shed a temporary charm over the scene of his captivity, and he relapses into loneliness, now rendered tenfold more intolerable by this <b>passing</b> <b>beam</b> of unattainable beauty. Through the long and weary day he repines at his unhappy lot, and when evening approaches, and Phoebus, as he beautifully expresses it, had [...] "bade farewell to every leaf and flower," [...] he still lingers at the window, and, laying his head upon the cold stone, gives vent to a mingled flow of love and sorrow, until, gradually lulled by the mute melancholy of the twilight hour, he lapses, [...] "half-sleeping, half swoon," [...] into a vision, which occupies the remainder of the poem, and in which is allegorically shadowed out the history of his passion.|$|E

40|$|Accurately {{setting the}} path length around {{the machine is}} central to the proper {{operation}} of the CEBAF accelerator. The CEBAF main accelerator consists of two recirculating superconducting linacs operating at 1497 MHz fundamental frequency. The electron beam can recirculate up to five times through the two linacs before it is extracted to the experimental halls. In order to obtain maximum energy gain and minimum energy spread through the linacs, all passes should arrive {{at the beginning of the}} linacs in phase at the crest of the RF cycle. In this paper we explain how the arrival times of higher <b>pass</b> <b>beams</b> are measured with respect to the first pass to less than one degree of RF phase and how the path length around the machine is adjusted. Following a brief introduction to the CEBAF design and some local nomenclature, these topics will be discussed: differential RF phase measurements of time delay, the energy method of cresting the higher <b>pass</b> <b>beams,</b> results obtained with the measurement techniques, future plans and improvements to the devices, and finally, a set of conclusions. 3 refs., 5 figs., 1 tab...|$|R

Unfortunately the beam commissioning was curtailed by the incident in sector 34. However, measurements performed during this first commissioning period showed that the magnet model of the machine had delivered optics close to nominal and also very good performance of beam instrumentation and supporting software.

50|$|Quartz iodine lamps, using {{elemental}} iodine, {{were the}} first commercial halogen lamps launched by GE in 1959. Quite soon, bromine {{was found to have}} advantages, but was not used in elemental form. Certain hydrocarbon bromine compounds gave good results. Regeneration of the filament is also possible with fluorine, but its chemical reactivity is so great that other parts of the lamp are attacked. The halogen is normally mixed with a noble gas, often krypton or xenon. The first lamps used only tungsten for filament supports, but some designs use molybdenum - an example being the molybdenum shield in the H4 twin filament headlight for the European Asymmetric <b>Passing</b> <b>Beam.</b>|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the main}} reasons for using SRF {{cavities}} in particle accelerators is that their large apertures result in low beam impedance and higher thresholds of deleterious beam instabilities. As a charged particle beam passes through a cavity, its electromagnetic radiation field is perturbed by the sudden increase of the conducting wall diameter in the transition from the small-diameter beampipe to the large hollow RF cavity. A portion of the particle's radiation field is then [...] "clipped off" [...] upon re-entrance into the beampipe and left behind as wakefields in the cavity. The wakefields are simply superimposed upon the externally driven accelerating fields in the cavity. The spawning of electromagnetic cavity modes as wakefields from the <b>passing</b> <b>beam</b> is analogous to a drumstick striking a drumhead and exciting many resonant mechanical modes.|$|E

Over several years, these systems have been designed and bench tested to assure a desired performance level. Using data from laboratory tests and the recent single <b>pass</b> <b>beam</b> tests, attained performance will be reported.

40|$|The fast beam-ion {{instability}} (FBII) {{has been}} studied experimentally at the Pohang Light Source. As the vacuum pressure increased by turning-off all ion pumps or by injection of Helium gas into the storage ring, the FBII was spontaneously excited. The oscillation amplitude, ion frequency, and bunch size blow-up were first measured for individual bunches from the snapshots of the bunch train taken by a streak camera and a single <b>pass</b> <b>beam</b> position monitor. By measuring the bunch-by-bunch parameters along the bunch train, we obtained important parameters of the FBII: bunch size blow-up factor of 2 σy, and the amplitude of oscillation {{by a factor of}} 1. 5 σy. ...|$|R

40|$|An {{inadvertent}} or unwanted {{angular deviation}} to a <b>passing</b> <b>beam</b> can be introduced by any single optical component within an optical system. The problem arises {{due to an}} imperfect tilt alignment of the optical component or manufacturing defects which results {{in a slightly different}} response than expected from an ideally aligned/manufactured component. The resulting beam deviation can plague any well-designed optical system that assumes the use of ideal components. The problem is especially introduced by non-ideal lenses, transparent plates and optical windows. Here we present a simple method of manually introducing a deviation error angle which we assume to be constant for all beam incidence angles over the paraxial range. Comment: 6 Pages, 2 Figure...|$|E
40|$|An {{achromatic}} Interaction Region (IR) design {{concept is}} presented {{with an emphasis}} on its application at an electron-ion collider. A specially-designed symmetric Chromaticity Compensation Block (CCB) induces an angle spread in the <b>passing</b> <b>beam</b> such that it cancels the chromatic kick of the final focusing quadrupoles. Two such CCB's placed symmetrically around an interaction point (IP) allow simultaneous compensation of the 1 st-order chromaticities and chromatic beam smear at the IP without inducing significant 2 nd-order aberrations. Special attention is paid to the difference in the electron and ion IR design requirements. We discuss geometric matching of the electron and ion IR footprints. We investigate limitations on the momentum acceptance in this IR design...|$|E

40|$|Laser Diode Array (LDA) {{appears to}} be most {{efficient}} means of transferring power from Earth to satellites and between satellites, in terms of mass and size, of various laser configurations. To form large-scale-array amplifier (LSAA), element LDA's must generate well-defined diffraction-limited beams. Coherent matching of phases among LDA's enables system to generate good beam pattern in far field over thousands of kilometers. By <b>passing</b> <b>beam</b> from master laser through number of LDA amplifiers simultaneously, one realizes coherence among amplified output beams.

40|$|The {{integrated}} luminosity of LHC can {{be increased}} by improving the reliability and lifetime of the machine components, saving money at the same time. One efficient method of doing this for the high power RF system components {{is to try and}} avoid RF power transients caused by each <b>passing</b> <b>beam</b> gap. Additionally klystron power settings may be reduced under these conditions, increasing lifetime even more and saving on electricity cost. These transients can be made to disappear if the bunches of the coasting LHC beam are allowed to settle in longitudinal positions, slightly shifted with respect to the regular positions. This will cause a small jitter in the nominal interaction position and time. We will show here that even for the ultimate beam the worst resulting jitter is very small compared to the bunch-length, hence should cause no problem for the LHC experiments...|$|E
40|$|A new {{possibility}} of continuation of few-nucleon dynamics studies at medium energies has appeared {{together with a}} new facility at the Institute of Nuclear Physics PAN in Kraków — The Bronowice Cyclotron Center (CCB).

Current progress in the theoretical calculations for four-nucleon (4 N) systems is a main motivation to investigate p−^{ 3 }He scattering. Due {{to the fact that}} the beam cannot be polarized, the only possibility to study spin observables is to build a polarized ^{ 3 }He target system. A planned experiment assumes the construction of a cylindrical double Pyrex cell with separated pumping and target chambers with an additional polyamide film covering apertures for the <b>passing</b> <b>beam</b> and the reaction products.
