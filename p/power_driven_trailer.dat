50|$|The CW (Coulsdon and Wallington stock) {{units were}} built in 1923-1924, as the last {{electric}} train stock for use on the LBSCR AC overhead electrified lines in South London. This stock comprised some hundred carriages, which were used in five-car formations: <b>Driving</b> <b>Trailer</b> Third (DTT) + <b>Driving</b> <b>Trailer</b> Composite (DTC) + Motor Luggage Van (MLV) + Trailer Composite (TC) + <b>Driving</b> <b>Trailer</b> Third (DTT).|$|R

50|$|The {{individual}} coach types {{were in the}} Eastern Region carriage diagram book as Dia. 363F (<b>Driving</b> Motor), 366 (<b>Trailer)</b> and 365F (<b>Driving</b> <b>Trailer).</b> Under TOPS, {{design codes}} EB2.05.0A, EH2.04.0A and EE2.04.0A respectively were allotted.|$|R
50|$|Trailer {{coaches were}} {{originally}} fitted with Gresley bogies which were replaced on <b>Driving</b> <b>Trailer</b> (DT) and Trailer Standard Open (TSO) which was formerly Composite Trailer and B5 Bogies on Battery <b>Driving</b> <b>Trailer</b> which became Battery Composite Trailer, the refurbishment moved First class accommodation {{to a position}} over the Westinghouse CM38 main compressor which was noisy and caused vibration. The Motor Coach retained its Gresley derived bogies after refurbishment.|$|R

5000|$|The {{first attempt}} to apply TOPS to diesel {{multiple}} units saw each carriage within a unit being allocated its own unique class number. This was probably because most DMUs were not kept in permanent formations. Classes were allocated according to the following division: 100-131: Driving Motor cars 140-150: <b>Driving</b> <b>Trailer</b> cars 160-190: Trailer cars 201-203: DEMU Driving Motor cars 211-212: DEMU <b>Driving</b> <b>Trailer</b> cars 221-225: DEMU Trailer cars 251: Express DEMU Driving Motor cars 261: Express DEMU Trailer cars ...|$|R
50|$|From 1926-27 {{the first}} batch of Ringer <b>Trailer</b> to <b>Driving</b> <b>Trailer</b> {{conversions}} were made, with trailers 365 and 368-372 converted to 224D, 219D, 220D, 221D, 222D and 223D.|$|R
50|$|The Trailer First {{cars were}} later removed {{and used as}} locomotive-hauled stock, from when the driving cars were paired with former loco-hauled coaches {{converted}} to <b>Driving</b> <b>Trailer</b> Composite cars.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Driving</b> <b>trailers</b> are {{classified}} after the UIC-lettering system, adding a [...] "t,” giving Bt (second class), BDt (second class + baggage), ABt (first + second class), or Dt (baggage).|$|R
50|$|Each {{vehicle was}} {{numbered}} individually, with power car numbers running from 67 to 69, and 81 to 99. The Intermediate Trailers were numbered 761 to 780 and the <b>Driving</b> <b>Trailers</b> were numbered 731 to 756. Power cars 81 to 89 were built between 1974/1975, while 67 to 69 and 90 to 99 were built between 1978/1979. Intermediate Trailers 761 to 764 were also built between 1974/1975, with 765 to 773 being completed between 1978/1979. Likewise, the <b>Driving</b> <b>Trailers</b> were also completed in batches, with 731 to 739 built between 1974/1975 and 740 to 751 built between 1978/1979. The additional coaches were conversions from BR or old NI Railways loco-hauled coaches, {{and were not}} original Class 80 vehicles. These were <b>Driving</b> <b>Trailers</b> 752 to 756 and Intermediate Trailers 774 to 780. During the mid-1990s the surviving vehicles were all renumbered by Translink, by adding 8000 to their numbers to avoid duplication with the bus fleet operated by Ulsterbus and Citybus, also Translink subsidiaries.|$|R
50|$|Then from 1965 to 1972 all bar {{two of the}} {{remaining}} Ringer trailers (349T and 350T) were converted to full <b>Driving</b> <b>Trailers</b> and coded randomly into in the range 226D-265D.|$|R
50|$|Some of the KB-45's were {{equipped}} with Sisu Nemo hydraulic {{system for a}} hydraulically <b>driven</b> <b>trailer</b> which improved significantly the off-road capability of the combination. The system was marketed with name Two-In-One.|$|R
25|$|<b>Driving</b> <b>trailer</b> – a DBSO was {{purchased}} in 2006 {{for use with}} the train to allow {{a greater degree of}} flexibility in its use. This was finally delivered in the summer of 2009.|$|R
50|$|One S9 train-set {{consists}} of four Third Class(TC) passenger carriages, 1 <b>Driving</b> <b>Trailer</b> and one <b>Power</b> car with passenger seating. Length of a one car is 65 ft. So this one is also capable of higher passenger capacity.|$|R
50|$|The vehicle {{kerb weight}} is 8 000 kg and the payload in terrain is just 3 000 kg. The maximum weight for a normal trailer is 5 000-7 000 kg {{and for a}} <b>driven</b> <b>trailer</b> 7 000-10 000 kg.|$|R
5000|$|Type ABt : <b>Driving</b> <b>Trailer</b> Composite, Nos. 5301 to 5304. Withdrawn {{and rebuilt}} with new bodies and bogies by R+J / Raility, renumbered 341 to 344 {{as part of}} [...] "Saanenland" [...] sets 5001 to 5004 inc. (See Below) ...|$|R
50|$|When the {{conversion}} project was halted, the swingdoor fleet equalled 32 <b>Driving</b> <b>Trailers,</b> 112 regular Trailers, eight double-ended motors, six high-powered motors and {{one hundred and}} thirty regular motors. The core of the Tait fleet had also been delivered by 1927.|$|R
50|$|Two {{parts of}} the set were then sold and kept at Steamport, Southport. Meanwhile, the <b>Driving</b> <b>Trailer</b> coach (DTS) was kept at the Wirral Transport Museum. The two {{parts of the}} unit, which were sold, have been owned by the Suburban Electric Railway Association since {{purchase}} by its forerunner, the Mersey and Tyneside Electric Preservationists in 1996, and are stored at the Electric Railway Museum on the outskirts of Coventry. After transport of the <b>Driving</b> <b>Trailer</b> coach from Birkenhead, the entire unit was correctly reformed at the Coventry museum in October 2010, {{for the first time in}} over 20 years. The Driving Motor coach (DMBS) interior is open to the public during museum open days.|$|R
50|$|One {{example of}} the class has been preserved, by the Downpatrick & County Down Railway. Unit 458 Antrim Castle was moved by road from York Road Depot, Belfast, over the weekend of 27-28 September 2014. During a two-day operation, the set was split into <b>Driving</b> <b>Trailer,</b> Intermediate and <b>Power</b> Car at Belfast and then, one-by-one, the {{carriages}} were taken by lorry to Downpatrick where they were reassembled. The <b>Driving</b> <b>Trailer</b> arrived on 27 September 2014, with the Intermediate and Power Car arriving the following day. The complete 458 successfully ran under its own power on 11 October 2014, and one week later on 18 October 2014, made a surprise appearance at the Irish Traction Group's Diesel Gala—the first time the unit had carried passengers since withdrawal by NIR in 2012.|$|R
50|$|The CP (Crystal Palace stock) {{units were}} built in 1911-1913 to provide the {{electric}} train stock required for the LBSCR AC overhead electrification to Crystal Palace and the surrounding area. This stock comprised some 90 cars, which were used in three-car formations, usually (<b>Driving</b> <b>Trailer</b> Composite+Driving Motor Brake Third+Driving Trailer Composite).|$|R

25|$|Many {{attendees}} of the Sturgis Rally have families, {{bring their}} children and <b>drive</b> <b>trailers</b> and campers to the rally, and ride their motorcycles just the last few miles.

50|$|<b>Driving</b> <b>trailer</b> car D6127 {{and motor}} car N5127 were both {{involved}} in the Wentworthville train derailment on 27 December 1989, Cityrail's first major accident involving the Tangara fleet. D6127 was written off, having collided with the platform. N5127 was sent to Dunheved on the Ropes Creek line for training fire fighters, along with Sydney Trains S Set car C3866.|$|R

50|$|Each {{unit was}} formed of a Driving Motor Brake Third (seating 52); a Trailer Composite (seating 24 first class and 38 third class passengers); and a <b>Driving</b> <b>Trailer</b> Third (seating 60). Third class was redesignated Second {{across the whole}} of BR on 3 June 1956, while the first class seating of these units was declassified to second in early 1960.|$|R

5000|$|In 1959 ten {{units were}} ordered from Commonwealth Engineering. These {{differed}} from the prototypes in having sheeted stainless steel and [...] Rolls-Royce engines. In 1963 a further five were ordered, followed in 1971 by a further ten. The last four were completed as Passenger Luggage <b>Driving</b> <b>Trailers</b> with access doors at both ends instead of a streamlined front, allowing the formation of 3-car (and occasionally 4-car) trains.|$|R
