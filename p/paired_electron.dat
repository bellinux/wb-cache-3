In this dissertation, I examine two families of systems which exhibit both electron-electron correlations and lattice frustration – charge transfer solids and layered cobaltates. The half-filled band Hubbard model on the triangular lattice has been proposed by mean-field theories as the minimal model for the superconductivity in the charge transfer solids. In {{the first part of}} this dissertation, by using exact calculations, I prove the absence of superconductivity in this model.

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of antiferromagnetism in kappa-(ET) _ 2 X {{can be understood}} within an effective 1 / 2 -filled band with dimers of ET molecules containing one hole each.

40|$|We propose an {{experimental}} method {{that can be}} used generally to test whether the cuprate pseudogap involves precursor pairing that acts to gap out the Fermi surface.

We illustrate this proposal with a specific model of the pseudogap that contains a phase-incoherent <b>paired</b> <b>electron</b> and unpaired hole Fermi surfaces. We show that even a weak current tilts the paired band and reveals parts of the previously gapped electron Fermi surface in ARPES if the binding energy is smaller but close to the pseudogap. Stronger currents can also reveal the Fermi surface through direct suppression of pairing. The proposed experiment is sufficiently general such that it can be used to reveal putative Fermi surfaces that have been reconstructed from other types of periodic order and are gapped out due to pairing.

40|$|To explain superconductivities {{and make}} up for the lack of current theory, a new quantum theory of cold {{electron}} was proposed. The key point is that we accepted the concept of electron orbital rotation instead of traditional electron spin. It leads to an important conclusion that the electron at low temperature is running in a flat orbital. The physical mechanism of superconductivities is so explained preferably. Under the assumption that the electrons have their motion tracks and the tracks can be described in atoms, the situations of electron will be changed a lot. The new concept of cold electron is then established. It means that the electrons can feel temperature. The Schrödinger function is the function of ideal electron indeed. Hot electron looks like the electron of the ideal electron. As temperature goes much lower, the electron orbits will obviously depar-ture to what Schrödinger function described, and run in a flat one. The orbital shape of <b>paired</b> <b>electron</b> depends on temperature, transitioning from three- to two-dimension.

Here, I propose a new atom model integrating frame-dragging force, centrifugal force, electrostatic force, and magnetic force. In this new model, the proton group and neutron group in atomic nucleus are rotating in different direction. Thus, they provide equal and opposite frame-dragging force for orbiting electrons. The electrons are orbiting in the equator plane of nucleus. There is no net force or net acceleration for electrons to allow electrons for stable orbiting. 1.

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of superconductivity {{continues to be}} of considerable scientific and practical interest. Underlying this phenomenon is the formation of electron pairs, which in conventional superconductors do not rotate about their centre of mass ('s-wave' pairing; refs 1, 2).

This theory also indicates that {{only a fraction of the}} electrons are strongly paired and that the orientation of the square nux lattice relative to the crystal lattice will determine which parts of the three-sheet Fermi surface of this material are responsible for superconductivity.

The eigenstates of a carbon nanotube quantum dot possess an additional orbital degeneracy leading to a four-fold shell pattern. This additional degeneracy increases the possibility for the Kondo effect to appear. We revisit the Kondo problem in metallic carbon nanotubes by linear and non-linear transport measurement in this regime, in which the four-fold pattern is present. We have analyzed the ground state of CNTs, which were grown by chemical vapor deposition, at filling N = 1, N = 2, and N = 3. Of particular interest is the half-filled shell, i. e. N = 2. In this case, the ground state is either a <b>paired</b> <b>electron</b> state or a state for which the singlet and triplet states are effectively degenerate, allowing {{in the latter case}} for the appearance of the Kondo effect. We deduce numbers for the effective missmatch d of the levels from perfect degeneracy and the exchange energy J.

40|$|We {{consider}} the Eliashberg {{theory in the}} coupling region where some fundamental qualitative deviations from the conventional BCS-like behaviour begin to appear. These deviations are identified as the onset of a cross-over from BCS superconductivity to Bose condensation. We {{point out that the}} beginning of this cross-over occurs when the gap ∆g becomes comparable to the boson energies Ωph. This condition is equivalent to the condition of Ref. [20] kFξ ≈ 2 π and traduces the physical constraint that the distance the <b>paired</b> <b>electron</b> covers during the absorbtion of the virtual boson, cannot be larger than the coherence length. The frontier region of couplings is of the order of λ ≈ 3, and high-Tc materials are concerned. A clear qualitative indication of the occurence of a cross-over regime should be a dip structure above the gap in the density of states of excitations. Comparing our results with tunneling and photoemission experiments we conclude that high-Tc materials (cuprates and fullerides) are indeed {{at the beginning of a}} cross-over from BCS superconductivity to Bose condensation, even though the fermionic nature still prevails. Taking into account the analysis of Ref. [20], we predict a dip structure in heavy fermion and organic superconductors. Non-adiabatic effects beyond Migdal’s theory are considered and give insight on the robustness of Eliashberg theory in describing qualitatively this cross-over regime, although for the quantitative interpretation of the results the inclusion of non-adiabatic corrections can be important.
