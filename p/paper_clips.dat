25|$|Due {{to their}} {{relatively}} low cost, ease of manufacture, versatility, and imperviousness to water, plastics {{are used in}} an enormous and expanding range of products, from <b>paper</b> <b>clips</b> to spaceships.

25|$|On October 6, 1956, Woodcock {{was riding}} his bike around Cabbagetown {{when he picked}} up 9-year-old Gary Morris. He then drove the boy to Cherry Beach, where he strangled and beat him to death - with a coroner later {{determining}} that Morris had died from a ruptured liver.

25|$|Renewable fuses (rewirable or cartridge) allow user replacement, {{but this}} can be {{hazardous}} as {{it is easy to}} put a higher-rated or double fuse element (link or wire) into the holder (overfusing), or simply fitting it with copper wire or even a totally different type of conducting object (coins, hairpins, <b>paper</b> <b>clips,</b> nails, etc.) to the existing carrier. One form of fuse box abuse was to put a penny in the socket, which defeated overcurrent protection and resulted in a dangerous condition. Such tampering will not be visible without full inspection of the fuse. Fuse wire was never used in North America for this reason, although renewable fuses continue to be made for distribution boards.|$|E

5000|$|The post-war years saw a {{widespread}} {{consolidation of the}} <b>paper</b> <b>clip</b> as a national symbol. Authors of books and articles {{on the history of}} Norwegian technology eagerly seized it to make a thin story more substantial. They chose to overlook the fact that Vaaler's clip was {{not the same as the}} fully developed Gem-type clip. In 1989 a giant <b>paper</b> <b>clip,</b> almost 7 m high, was erected on the campus of a commercial college near Oslo in honour of Vaaler, ninety years after his invention was patented. But this monument shows a Gem-type clip, not the one patented by Vaaler. The celebration of the alleged Norwegian origin of the <b>paper</b> <b>clip</b> culminated in 1999, one hundred years after Vaaler submitted his application for a German patent. A commemorative stamp was issued that year, the first in a series to draw attention to Norwegian inventiveness. The background shows a facsimile of the German [...] "Patentschrift". However, the figure in the foreground is not the <b>paper</b> <b>clip</b> depicted on that document, but the much better known [...] "Gem". In 2005, the national biographical encyclopedia of Norway (Norsk biografisk leksikon) published the biography of Johan Vaaler, stating he was the inventor of the <b>paper</b> <b>clip.</b>|$|R

500|$|The mostly {{synthesized}} orchestral {{score of}} the season was composed by Christopher Lennertz and Jay Gruska. The pair try to base the music on the visuals of each episode, with {{about a third of}} each episode's score being newly written for the supernatural legend. For example, off-angle shots in [...] "Dead in the Water" [...] are accompanied by repetitive and discordant notes. As well, spoken words such as [...] "water" [...] and [...] "die" [...] are followed by a lower pitch because Lennertz felt it created a [...] "gurgly" [...] water sound. An electric cello and woodwinds helped to create a big emotional tone in the episode [...] "Home", with Lennertz feeling that the final cue [...] "became a very cinematic musical moment". To fit in with the episode's ambiance in [...] "Asylum", Gruska made the music very subtle; Lennertz felt that it was [...] "creepy-crawly" [...] like [...] "a snake sneaking along the ground". Conversely, Lennertz matched the theme of traveling evangelists in [...] "Faith" [...] by using a small 76-key piano that was damaged and slightly out of tune. He attached small items such as coins and <b>paper</b> <b>clips</b> to the keys to create a rattling noise, making the piano seem [...] "old and crappy". Lennertz then played [...] "bluesy gospel music" [...] during the sermon scenes involving the Reapers. Because he felt that there was also a [...] "snake-oil salesman vibe" [...] to the episode, he included an Armenian duduk due to its association with snake charming. The score of [...] "Hell House", on the other hand, had a much lighter tone to coincide with the episode's humor. For example, music for the scenes involving the [...] "professional" [...] ghost hunters used percussion instruments to slightly mimic the [...] theme.|$|E

50|$|Unlike {{certain other}} jurisdictions (notably the USA {{and much of}} Europe), UK money {{laundering}} offences {{are not limited to}} the proceeds of serious crimes, nor are there any monetary limits, nor is there any necessity for there to be a money laundering design or purpose to an action for it to amount to a money laundering offence. A money laundering offence under UK legislation need not involve money, since the money laundering legislation covers assets of any description. Technically therefore an individual who steals even a <b>paper</b> <b>clip</b> in the UK commits a money laundering offence (possession of the stolen <b>paper</b> <b>clip)</b> in addition to the predicate offence (of theft of the <b>paper</b> <b>clip).</b>|$|R

2500|$|The {{guidelines}} were also unsatisfactory {{on how to}} determine if the items were marketed for use with illegal drugs, Sprecher found. They depended heavily on the items being sold in [...] "proximity" [...] to other covered items, or [...] "literature encouraging illegal use of cannabis or drugs." [...] Since [...] "paraphernalia" [...] had such an expansive definition, he argued, anything sold near such literature could be covered. [...] "This means that <b>paper</b> <b>clips</b> sold next to Rolling Stone magazine conceivably could trigger the requirements of the ordinance." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wire {{drawing is}} a {{metalworking}} process {{used to reduce}} the cross-section of a wire by pulling the wire through a single, or series of, drawing die(s). [...] There are many applications for wire drawing, including electrical wiring, cables, tension-loaded structural components, springs, <b>paper</b> <b>clips,</b> spokes for wheels, and stringed musical instruments. [...] Although similar in process, drawing is different from extrusion, because in drawing the wire is pulled, rather than pushed, through the die. Drawing is usually performed at room temperature, thus classified as a cold working process, {{but it may be}} performed at elevated temperatures for large wires to reduce forces.|$|E

2500|$|Although Bailey {{occasionally}} {{made use}} of prepared guitar in the 1970s (he would, for example, put <b>paper</b> <b>clips</b> on the strings, wrap his instruments in chains, or add further strings to the guitar), often for Dadaist/theatrical effect, {{by the end of}} that decade he had, in his own words, [...] "dumped" [...] such methods. Bailey argued that his approach to music-making was actually far more orthodox than performers such as Keith Rowe of the improvising collective AMM, who treats the guitar purely as a [...] "sound source" [...] rather than as a musical instrument. Instead, Bailey preferred to [...] "look for whatever 'effects' I might need through technique".|$|E
2500|$|Creep {{deformation}} {{is important}} not only in systems where high temperatures are endured such as nuclear power plants, jet engines and heat exchangers, {{but also in the}} design of many everyday objects. For example, metal <b>paper</b> <b>clips</b> are stronger than plastic ones because plastics creep at room temperatures. Aging glass windows are often erroneously used as an example of this phenomenon: measurable creep would only occur at temperatures above the glass transition temperature around [...] While glass does exhibit creep under the right conditions, apparent sagging in old windows may instead be a consequence of obsolete manufacturing processes, such as that used to create crown glass, which resulted in inconsistent thickness.|$|E
2500|$|Many composers sought new timbres {{within the}} {{framework}} of traditional instruments. [...] "Composers begin to hear new timbres and new timbral combinations, which are as important to the new music of the twentieth century as the so-called breakdown of functional tonality," [...] writes music historian James McCalla. Examples are numerous: Bartók's Sonata for two pianos and percussion (1937), Schoenberg's Pierrot lunaire, Charles Ives's Quartertone Pieces for two pianos tuned a quartertone apart. Other composers used electronics and extended techniques to create new sonorities. An example is George Crumb's Black Angels, for electric string quartet (1970). The players not only bow their amplified instruments, they also beat on them with thimbles, pluck them with <b>paper</b> <b>clips</b> and play {{on the wrong side of}} the bridge or between the fingers and the nut.|$|E

50|$|A Norwegian, Johan Vaaler (1866-1910), has erroneously been {{identified}} as {{the inventor of the}} <b>paper</b> <b>clip.</b> He was granted patents in Germany and in the United States (1901) for a <b>paper</b> <b>clip</b> of similar design, but less functional and practical, because it lacked the last turn of the wire. Vaaler probably did not know that a better product was already on the market, although not yet in Norway. His version was never manufactured and never marketed, because the superior Gem was already available.|$|R
2500|$|The first Muppet {{to appear}} on the show was Big Bird, an 8-foot-tall yellow bird {{believed}} by writer Shalom M. Fisch and Dr. Lewis Bernstein to be a canary, who resides in a large nest alongside the [...] "123 Sesame Street" [...] building and represents the 6-year-old child with his tendency to question everything. Also living outside of the building is Oscar the Grouch, a trash can-dwelling creature belonging to his own unique species, who is portrayed as a habitual pessimist and was designed to give children [...] "permission to feel grouchy—and to demonstrate differing opinions". Oscar and Big Bird were specifically created for the reshooting of the [...] "Street" [...] scenes with the idea that {{they would be able to}} interact with the human characters. Big Bird's best friend is Aloysius Snuffleupagus (better known as [...] "Snuffy"), who was portrayed as the bird's imaginary friend until revealed to the human cast in 1985. For his part, Oscar has several friends of his own despite his pessimism; these include the Grouch's pet worm, Slimey, and his girlfriend Grundgetta. Two other Muppets who have appeared on the show since its beginning are Ernie and Bert, a pair of best friends with contrasting personalities; Ernie is portrayed as a free-spirited trickster who loves his rubber duck, while Bert is the world-weary foil to his friend's naïve trouble-making, and shows himself to be obsessed with things like pigeons and <b>paper</b> <b>clips.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{originator}} of the Norwegian <b>paper</b> <b>clip</b> myth was {{an engineer}} of the Norwegian national patent agency who visited Germany in the 1920s to register Norwegian patents in that country.
