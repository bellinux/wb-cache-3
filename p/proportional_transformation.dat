40|$|To {{solve the}} issue of {{segmenting}} rich texture images, a novel detection methods based on the affine invariable principle is proposed. Considering the similarity between the texture areas, we first take the affine transform to get numerous shapes, and utilize the KLT algorithm to verify the similarity. The transforms include rotation, <b>proportional</b> <b>transformation</b> and perspective deformation {{to cope with a}} variety of situations. Then we propose an improved LBP method combining canny edge detection to handle the boundary in the segmentation process. Moreover, human-computer interaction of this method which helps splitting the matched texture area from the original images is user-friendly. Comment: 6 pages, 15 figure...|$|E

Exact inference for the regression parameters and hazard ratio is derived.

They argued that the kinematics groups are perforce conformal as they preserve the quadratic form of spacetime and are akin to orthogonal transformations, though with respect to an isotropic quadratic form. The liberties of an electromagnetic field are not confined to kinematic motions, but rather are required only to be locally <b>proportional</b> to a <b>transformation</b> preserving the quadratic form. Harry Bateman’s paper in 1910 studied the Jacobian matrix of a transformation that preserves the light cone and showed it had the conformal property (proportional to a form preserver).|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn this work, {{propagation}} in multi-layered anisotropic {{media is}} numerically and experimentally investigated. Acoustic properties of pre-fractal samples constituted by {{a succession of}} orthotropic layers are studied. Complex media (periodic, disordered or fractal) {{are known for their}} remarkable properties as regards to acoustic wave propagation. Fractals appear to be between periodicity and disorder and their intrinsic <b>proportional</b> <b>transformation</b> impacts directly on waves propagation. Indeed, they represent very well natural irregularities, but they are also built from a repetitive pattern at different scales: they are self-similar. The layers orientations in the stack follow a self-similar sequence. It can be demonstrated that such pre-fractal media are similar to periodic structures with defects. The fractal type affects the introduced disorder. Bulk waves propagation in multi-layered anisotropic media is theoretically described by the stiffness matrix method (published by Rokhlin and Wang in 2002). From the resolution of Christoffel equation, stresses and displacements in each layer are connected by a matrix formalism. Pre-fractal stacks are numerically and experimentally characterized. They are also compared with classical fractal, periodic and disordered structures...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} future {{economic}} development of Kazachstan. Further, the paper intro- duces the development key parameters of development and increase of competitiveness of the national economy. The modern market economy of the world developed countries is cemented by general functi- onal-moving origin industrial capital that has transformed the commodity-money relations into the defining mechanism of economic development. lt is thought, that increase of national competitive- ness in Kazakhstan is possible only {{on the basis of}} <b>proportional</b> <b>transformation</b> of sphere of goods production, and also its database. As a result, these transformations should lead, as in all industri- ally developed countries, to the creation of mixed economy as the elements unity of the classical market and corporate structures. A state in this system is called to carry out the major function of the integrating element providing connection of the market subjects in the system whole. In Kazakhstan market formation is carried out on a way of privatization and privatization of rigidly centralized economy and its transformation to multistructural. lt demands a special approach. lt is required to add to the aforesaid that the existing technological level of the production industrial base of our country, it also imposes some peculiarities on this process. In the modern economy of Kazakhstan, formation of the competitive environment is connected with decision of some primary goals such as creation of the enterprise sector of economy, for- mation of organizational Iegal conditions to overcome monopolistic disproportions, abuse of the Ieading position in the commodity markets, the prevention of unfair competition, and, at last, the elimination of artificial administrative barriers hampering equal competition. The major value for the future {{economic development of}} Kazakhstan has a basic choice between raw and technological orientation of economy. Till now the state support of technological com- petitive advantages of the firms in Kazakhstan was carried out by means of: restructuring of the state ownership stimulation of domestic competition of economy in Kazakhstan and weakening of pressure on producers of monopolistic factors; privatization of services sphere allowing flexibility increase...|$|E
40|$|We {{show that}} the image by the Lorentz {{transformation}} of a spherical (circular) light wave, emitted by a moving source, is not a spherical (circular) light wave but an ellipsoidal (elliptical) light wave. Poincare's ellipsoid (ellipse) is the direct geometrical representation of Poincare's relativity of simultaneity. Einstein's spheres (circles) are the direct geometrical representation of Einstein's convention of synchronisation. Poincare adopts another convention for the definition of space-time units involving that the Lorentz transformation of an unit of length is directly <b>proportional</b> to Lorentz <b>transformation</b> of an unit of time. Poincare's relativistic kinematics predicts both a dilation of time and an expansion of space as well.

40|$|We {{argue that}} {{conformal}} invariance in flat spacetime implies Weyl invariance {{in a general}} curved background metric for all unitary theories in spacetime dimensions d ≤ 10. We also study possible curvature corrections to the Weyl transformations of operators, and show that these are absent for operators of sufficiently low dimensionality and spin. We find possible `anomalous' Weyl <b>transformations</b> <b>proportional</b> to the Weyl (Cotton) tensor for d > 3 (d = 3). The arguments are based on algebraic consistency conditions similar to the Wess-Zumino consistency conditions that classify possible local anomalies. The arguments can be straightforwardly extended to larger operator dimensions and higher d with additional algebraic complexity.

50|$|SMAs also display superelasticity, {{which is}} {{characterized}} by recovery of unusually large strains. Instead of transforming between the martensite and austenite phases in response to temperature, this phase transformation can be induced in response to mechanical stress. When SMAs are loaded in the austenite phase, the material will transform to the martensite phase above a critical stress, <b>proportional</b> to the <b>transformation</b> temperatures. Upon continued loading, the twinned martensite will begin to detwin, allowing the material to undergo large deformations. Once the stress is released, the martensite transforms back to austenite, and the material recovers its original shape. As a result, these materials can reversibly deform to very high strains - up to 8 percent. A more thorough discussion of the mechanisms of superelasticity and the shape-memory effect is presented by Ma et al.|$|R

The results confirmed that the gene introduction efficiency was improved with DDMC relative to DEAE-dextran. Comparative investigations {{were carried out}} using various concentrations of DDMC and DNA in the introduction of DNA encoding luciferase (pGL 3 control vector; Promega) into COS- 7 cells derived from African green monkey kidney cells. The complex formation reaction {{is thought to be}} directly <b>proportional</b> to the <b>transformation</b> rate, but the complex formation reaction between DDMC and DNA is significantly influenced by hydrophobic bonding strength along with hydrogen bonding strength and Coulomb forces due to the hydrophobicity of the grafted MMA sections. It is thought that the reaction is a Michaelis-Menten type complex formation reaction described by the following equation: Complex amount = K 1 (DNA concentration) (DDMC concentration). In support of this equation, it was confirmed that the amount of formed complex was proportional to the RLU value...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{show how the}} well-know local symmetries of Lagrangeans systems, and in {{particular}} the diffeomorphism invariance, emerge in the Hamiltonian formulation. We show that only the constraints which are linear in the momenta generate transformations which correspond to symmetries of the corresponding Lagrangean system. The nonlinear constraints (which we have, for instance, in gravity, supergravity and string theory) rather generate the dynamics of the corresponding Lagrangean system. Only in a very special combination with "trivial" <b>transformations</b> <b>proportional</b> to the equations of motion do they lead to symmetry transformations. We reveal the importance of these special "trivial" transformations for the interconnection theorems which relate the symmetries of a system with its dynamics. We prove these theorems for general Hamiltonian systems. We apply the developed formalism to concrete physically relevant systems and in particular those which are diffeomorphism invariant. The connection between the parameters of the symmetry transformations in the Hamiltonian- and Lagrangean formalisms is found. The possible applications of our results are discussed.

40|$|The {{interaction}} {{picture is}} a useful tool in quantum mechanics, allowing one to investigate slow and possibly complicated processes {{in the presence of}} fast motions whose behavior is well understood. Important examples in NMR are the rotating-Frame transformation (I) and the “togglingfi-ame ” picture used in mu ltiple-pulse NMR (2, 3) and composite pulses (4). The interaction picture is related to the laboratory frame by a timedependent unitary transformation operator. If this operator commutes with itself at different times, as in the rotating-frame transformation, the evaluation of the transformation is usually quite simple. In mu ltiple-pulse NMR, however, the pu. lses are usually applied with different phases, leading to noncommut ing transfor-mation operators. In this case the transformation is conventionally performed in a straightforward fashion which requires a number of <b>transformations</b> <b>proportional</b> to the square of the number of pulses in the sequence. In this paper we show that this method is not inherent to the transformation and demonstrate a simplification which is recursive, thereby making the number of necessary transformations linear in the number of pulses in the sequence. The Hamiltonian describing a mu ltiple-pulse sequence can be written in the lab-oratory frame as A?(t) = x 0 + 2 FRF(t), [II wlhere XRF(t) describes the effect of the radiofrequency pulses, while A? ” contains all the other interactions.
