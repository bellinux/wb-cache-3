25|$|Like {{sailplanes}} {{and hang}} gliders, <b>paragliders</b> use rising air (thermals) or ridge lift to gain height. This {{process is the}} basis for most recreational flights and competitions, though aerobatics and 'spot landing competitions' also occur. Launching is often done by jogging down a slope, but winch launches behind a towing vehicle are also used. A Paramotor is a paraglider wing powered by a motor attached {{to the back of the}} pilot, and is also known as a powered <b>paragliders.</b> A variation of this is the paraplane, which has a motor mounted on a wheeled frame rather than the pilot's back.|$|E
40|$|Key words: GPS, <b>paraglider,</b> {{performance}} curve. Time aloft {{and distance}} travelled in free flight with a <b>paraglider</b> {{is determined by}} three factors: weather conditions, pilot skill and <b>paraglider</b> performance. The latter factor can be accurately determined and represented in a performance curve using sensors (a variometer and a wind speed indicator or speed probe) calibrated by GPS receivers. A test flight was carried out with a <b>paraglider</b> which was launched to an altitude of 750 m using a stationary winch. After release, a variometer and speed probe logged horizontal velocity and vertical velocity data respectively for different angles of attack of the <b>paraglider</b> airfoil. From this data a performance curve was constructed. The performance curve is very useful to <b>paraglider</b> pilots because it allows for the correct choice of airspeed to maximize time aloft and distance travelled in particular wind and lift/sink conditions.

25|$|In a hang glider {{the shape}} of the wing is {{determined}} by a structure, and it is this that distinguishes them from the other main type of foot-launched aircraft, <b>paragliders,</b> technically Class 3. Some hang gliders have engines, and are known as powered hang gliders. Due to their commonality of parts, construction and design, they are usually considered by aviation authorities to be hang gliders, even though they may use the engine for the entire flight. Some flexible wing powered aircraft, Ultralight trikes, have a wheeled undercarriage, and so are not hang gliders.|$|E
5000|$|In 1961, NASA {{originally}} {{planned to have}} the Gemini spacecraft land on a firm, solid ground runway with a Rogallo wing airfoil, {{rather than as a}} splashdown with parachute. [...] The test vehicle became known as the <b>Paraglider</b> Research Vehicle. Development work on both Gemini's splashdown parachute and spaceplane <b>paraglider</b> began in 1963. By December 1963, the parachute was already to undergo full-scale deployment testing. On the other hand, by December 1963 the <b>paraglider</b> spaceplane concept was running into technical difficulties and subsequently became replaced by the parachute splashdown concept. Though attempts to revive Gemini's <b>paraglider</b> spaceplane concept persisted within NASA and North American Aviation as late as 1964, NASA Headquarters Gemini Chief William Schneider discontinued development as technical hurdles became too expensive.|$|R

25|$|In {{and around}} the Hesselberg area there are many trails. The two main trails have many signs {{containing}} information for the hiker. The geological nature trail, which is 3km long, leads from its starting point near Wittelshofen to the mountain's peak. The signs along the route tell of the geological history {{and structure of the}} mountain. The Hesselberg-trail forms a round-trip of Hesselberg's heights. Both trails are well combinable. The Osterwiese is meeting point for model plane pilots, the launch areas for hang-gliders and <b>paragliders</b> can be found there too. The regional gliding airfield is in nearby Irsingen. Sporting clays was prohibited by the Nature Conservation Agency due to lead exposure. The Hesselberg Tourist Office, the Bund Naturschutz in Bayern (Bavarian Nature Conservation Alliance) (Ansbach district group), and the Landesbund für Vogelschutz in Bayern (Bavarian State Bird Conservation Alliance) (Ansbach district group) organise guided excursions and walking tours. At the mountain's foot anglers can indulge their passion at the Wörnitz and Sulzach rivers. The German Alpine Association (Hesselberg section with an office in Bechhofen) have built a small hut on the northern slope in order to support winter sports.|$|E
500|$|The two {{air sports}} {{that are most}} closely related to gliding are hang gliding and paragliding. Although all three sports rely on rising air, there are {{significant}} differences which are listed in detail in [...] The main difference is that both hang gliders and <b>paragliders</b> are simpler, less sophisticated and cheaper aircraft that use the pilot's feet as the undercarriage. All <b>paragliders</b> and most hang gliders have no protective structure around the pilot. However, the dividing line between basic gliders and sophisticated hang-gliders is becoming less distinct. For example, hang gliders typically use fabric wings, shaped over a framework, but hang gliders with rigid wings and three-axis controls are also available. The lower air speeds and lower glide ratios of typical hang gliders means that shorter cross-country distances are flown than in modern gliders. <b>Paragliders</b> are more basic craft. They are also foot-launched, but their wings usually have no frames and their shape is created by the flow and pressure of air. The airspeeds and glide ratios of <b>paragliders</b> are generally lower still than the typical hang gliders, and so their cross-country flights are even shorter. Radio-controlled gliding uses scale-models of gliders mainly for ridge soaring; however thermic aeromodelling craft are also used.|$|E
