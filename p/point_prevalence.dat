MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Cumulative prevalences of wheeze and doctor diagnosed asthma and <b>point</b> <b>prevalences</b> of recurrent cough and wheeze by age and sex. RESULTS [...] There were 1422 replies (86. 2 %; 726 for boys, 696 for girls). Overall, 11. 0 % (95 % confidence interval 9. 4 % to 12. 6 %) of children had formally been diagnosed as having asthma, the cumulative prevalence in boys (12. 7 %) being somewhat higher than in girls (9. 2 %) (age adjusted odds ratio 1. 47, p = 0. 03). As expected, the cumulative prevalence of asthma increased significantly with age (7. 5 % (13 / 173) in children under 1 year, 15. 9 % (61 / 383) in children of 4 years and over; p < 0. 001). The cumulative prevalence of wheeze overall was 15. 6 % (13. 7 % to 17. 5 %), being higher in boys (17. 6 %) than in girls (13. 5 %) (odds ratio 1. 38, p = 0. 03). The overall prevalence of recurrent cough without colds was 21. 8 % (19. 6 % to 23. 9 %), with a non-significant excess in boys (23. 1 % v 20. 4 %).
