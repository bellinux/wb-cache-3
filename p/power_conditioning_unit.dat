40|$|In this paper, some of {{the aspects}} {{associated}} with the integration of renewable energy sources into smart grid power systems are investigated. The renewable energy sources under study include a photovoltaic (PV) source and a wind energy conversion system (WECS). The PV source yields a variable DC output voltage that {{is dependent on the}} solar irradiation and ambient temperature. Therefore, a <b>power</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>unit</b> (PCU) is needed to integrate its energy to the power system and track its maximum power point (MPP). The <b>power</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>unit</b> may be a controlled DC-DC boost conveter. The design and implementation of such converter is investigated in the paper. Moreover, wind generators yield an AC output voltage that has variable voltage magnitude and frequency. Hence, a complete WECS has to be developed to integrate this wind energy to the power system. The WECS involves an uncontrolled (diode) rectifier cascaded by a controlled DC-DC converter. Furthermore, the renewable energy system involves a battery storage system that in turns need a converter to control its charging/discharging process. The design and control of this converter will be presented in this paper as well. Simulation and experimental results are included to verify the ideas developed in this study...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT This paper {{describes}} {{modeling and}} simulation of microgrid connected renewable energy based Hybrid Pow-er System (HPS) in the aspect of improving power quality. Since optimal utilization of primary energy sources will increase the level of supply reliability, a dynamic control algorithm is proposed for economic energy management. In order to meet sustained load demands during varying natural conditions, different renewable energy sources and <b>power</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>units</b> are need to be integrated with each other. The paper focuses on the combination of Photo Voltaic (PV) cell, Wind Turbine (WT), Fuel Cell (FC), and Battery systems for power generation.

40|$|Public {{awareness}} has aroused {{concerns over}} the possible effects of magnetic fields on human health. While research continues to determine if magnetic fields do, in fact, affect human health, concerned individuals are requesting data on magnetic field sources in their environments to base personal decisions about limiting their exposure to these sources. Timely acceptance and implementation of photovoltaics (PV), particularly for distributed applications such as PV rooftops, windows, and vehicles, may be hampered {{by the lack of}} PV magnetic field data. To address this situation, magnetic flux density was measured around equipment at two PVUSA (Photovoltaics for Utility Scale Applications) project sites in Kerman and Davis, California. This report documents the data and compares the PV magnetic fields with published data on more prevalent magnetic field sources. Although not comprehensive, electric and magnetic field (EMF) data taken at PVUSA indicate that 60 -Hz magnetic fields (the EMF type of greatest public concern) are significantly less for PV arrays than for household applications. Therefore, given the present EMF research knowledge, PV array EMF may not merit considerable concern. The PV system components exhibiting significant AC magnetic fields are the transformers and <b>power</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>units</b> (PCUs). However, the AC magnetic fields associated with these components are localized and are not detected at PV system perimeters.
