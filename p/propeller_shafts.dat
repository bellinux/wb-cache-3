5|$|The {{ships were}} {{modified}} extensively {{in an attempt}} to rectify their machinery problems. All three ships had their <b>propeller</b> <b>shafts</b> lengthened, and their original bronze screws were replaced with larger steel propellers, though this did not improve performance. Sebenico received the most radical alteration; her stern was lengthened slightly to allow for finer hull lines, which would improve her hydrodynamic shape, though this too failed to provide a significantly higher speed. As a result of her different hull, Sebenico is sometimes not included in the Zara class. Between 1898 and 1901, all four ships were re-boilered.|$|E
5|$|Kalinin {{was one of}} the Project 26bis2 cruisers, {{the third}} pair of the s. She was larger and had a more {{powerful}} anti-aircraft armament than her half-sisters. She was assembled at the newly constructed Shipyard 199, Komsomolsk-on-Amur, from components built at the Shipyard 198 (Marti South) in Nikolayev. She was laid down on 12 August 1938, launched from drydock on 8 May 1942 and was completed on 31 December 1942 after being towed down the Amur River to Vladivostok. Her construction was prolonged by late deliveries from western factories. For example, her propellers had to be shipped from Leningrad after it had been surrounded by the Germans and her <b>propeller</b> <b>shafts</b> had to be removed from the Barrikada factory in Stalingrad in 1942 before it was destroyed by the Germans.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The <b>propeller</b> <b>shaft</b> of {{rear-wheel drive}} vehicle {{transfers}} {{power from the}} engine to rear wheels through the differential gear box. Generally the <b>propeller</b> <b>shaft</b> has a two-piece steel structure of more than 10 kg of weight. In this paper, we designed the one-piece hybrid <b>propeller</b> <b>shaft</b> using the aluminum, {{carbon fiber composite material}} and glass fiber composite material. Research on the adhesive strength of the hybrid <b>propeller</b> <b>shaft</b> with respect to roughness of aluminum surface was conducted. The one piece hybrid <b>propeller</b> <b>shaft</b> satisfying the performance standards of <b>propeller</b> <b>shaft</b> such as statistic torsion torque strength and first bending natural frequency was manufactured. The manufactured hybrid shaft was assembled with the suitable connecting parts and analyzed for performance verification. This hybrid <b>propeller</b> <b>shaft</b> satisfies all performance standards of <b>propeller</b> <b>shaft</b> for automobile application. The hybrid shaft has vibration characteristics of 237 Hz significantly higher than the standard characteristic of 150 Hz of the existing two-piece steel structure <b>propeller</b> <b>shaft...</b>|$|R

5|$|Sir Stanley V. Goodall, Director of Naval Construction (DNC), {{proposed}} {{a variety of}} designs, both open and closed hangar. On 8 October 1943, the Board of Admiralty selected a closed-hangar design with an armoured flight deck and five <b>propeller</b> <b>shafts.</b> Reports of American operations in the Pacific convinced the Board to reconsider hangar design; American experience had shown {{that the ability to}} fly off all of a carrier's aircraft in a single airstrike was vital. That required a well-ventilated, open-hangar design, which would reduce the time required to launch the aircraft by allowing them to begin the typical 15-minute engine warm-up while still in the hangar. On 15 May 1944, the Board reversed itself and ordered the DNC to produce an open-hangar design with deck-edge lifts. An unarmoured flight deck was agreed upon in June by the Controller of the Navy and the Fifth Sea Lord.|$|E
5|$|Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino (STT) of Trieste was {{selected}} for the contract to build eight vessels, ahead of one other tenderer. Despite the specifications of the contract being {{very close to the}} requirements for the coastal torpedo boat, the STT boats were classified as sea-going. The STT boats used Parsons turbines driving two <b>propeller</b> <b>shafts.</b> Another tender was requested for four more boats, but when Ganz & Danubius reduced their price by ten percent, a total of sixteen boats were ordered from them. These boats were powered by AEG-Curtiss turbines, and had two funnels rather than the single funnel of the STT boats. The third contract went to Cantiere Navale Triestino (CNT), who used Melms-Pfenniger turbines, and their boats also had two funnels. The boats of all three groups used steam generated by two Yarrow water-tube boilers, one of which burned fuel oil and the other coal.|$|E
5|$|The German UB II design {{improved}} {{upon the}} design of the UB I boats, which had been ordered in September 1914. In service, the UB I boats were found to be too small and too slow. A major problem was that, because they had a single propeller shaft/engine combo, if either component failed, the U-boat became almost totally disabled. To rectify this flaw, the UB II boats featured twin <b>propeller</b> <b>shafts</b> and twin engines (one shaft for each engine), which also increased the U-boat's top speed. The new design also included more powerful batteries, larger torpedo tubes, and a deck gun. As a UB II boat, U-43 could also carry twice the torpedo load of her UB I counterparts, and nearly ten times as much fuel. To accommodate all of these changes the boats' had larger hulls, and surface and submerged displacements more than twice those of the UB I boats.|$|E
40|$|The {{transverse}} induced vibrations of <b>propeller</b> <b>shaft</b> are studied. The stern {{section of}} a <b>propeller</b> <b>shaft</b> is modeled with a beam, resting upon nondeformable supports. An inertial force of a screw is taken into account. The resulting solution allows us to investigate both the factual frequency of the <b>propeller</b> <b>shaft</b> and the displacement of the sections of the shaft {{in the process of}} oscillations. The solution has an independent significance because it describes the process of double-bearing beam oscillation with a console supporting a concentrated mass at its free end...|$|R

A prop-shaft assembly consists of a <b>propeller</b> <b>shaft,</b> a slip joint and one or more universal joints.

She was still incomplete on this date and the official report of all work completed was not signed until 29 January 1947. Her construction was prolonged by late deliveries from western factories. For example, her propellers had to be shipped from Leningrad after it had been surrounded by the Germans in September 1941 and her <b>propeller</b> <b>shafts</b> had to be removed from the Barrikada factory in Stalingrad before it was destroyed by the Germans in 1942.

5|$|Russian {{forces were}} making {{significant}} gains into Ottoman territory during the Caucasus Campaign. In {{an attempt to}} prevent further advances by the Russian army, Yavuz rushed 429 officers and men, a mountain artillery battery, machine gun and aviation units, 1,000 rifles, and 300 cases of munitions to Trebizond on 4 February. On 4 March, the Russian navy landed a detachment of some 2,100 men, along with mountain guns and horses, {{on either side of}} the port of Atina. The Turks were caught by surprise and forced to evacuate. Another landing took place at Kavata Bay, some 5miles east of Trebizond, in June. In late June, the Turks counterattacked and penetrated around 20miles into the Russian lines. Yavuz and Midilli conducted a series of coastal operations to support the Turkish attacks. On 4 July, Yavuz shelled the port of Tuapse, where she sank a steamer and a motor schooner. The Turkish ships sailed northward to circle back behind the Russians before the two Russian dreadnoughts left Sevastopol to try to attack them. They then returned to the Bosphorus, where Yavuz was docked for repairs to her <b>propeller</b> <b>shafts</b> until September.|$|E
5|$|Turbo-electric {{propulsion}} {{was selected}} for the battlecruisers despite the fact it needed more room than geared turbines to allow for better underwater protection that wartime experience showed was essential. First used in the s, it also had several other advantages. The turbines could run at their optimum speed, without regard to propeller speed, which was economical on fuel and the machinery could be easily sub-divided which increased the ships' ability to withstand torpedo hits. The substitution of flexible electric cables for bulky steam-lines meant that the motors could be mounted further {{to the rear of}} the ship, which reduced both vibration and weight by shortening the <b>propeller</b> <b>shafts.</b> Also, the ship could go astern at full power simply by reversing the electrical polarity of the motors. Despite these factors and the fact that American companies would have struggled to produce the very large geared steam turbines needed for such big ships, the Curtis Company tried unsuccessfully to convince the Navy to reverse this decision. The Navy countered that doing so would mean a complete rearrangement of machinery spaces and a reduction in underwater protection.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{parliamentary}} {{discussion of}} the design focused less on the anticipated cost of the ships than the idea that France was being {{left behind in the}} technological arms race, particularly in regard to the innovative Parsons steam turbines used by HMS Dreadnought. In response the navy sent a technical mission to inspect the Parsons factory, several shipyards, and gun factories as well as the Barr & Stroud rangefinder factory in May 1906 and concluded that the turbines offered more power in a smaller volume than triple-expansion steam engines at a significant increase in fuel consumption at low speeds. Two ships had already been ordered from the naval dockyards three months previously when the navy decided to use the turbines in July. To further complicate things, Gaston requested a study using the heavier and more powerful 45-caliber 305-millimeter Modèle 1906 gun on 3 August while not endorsing the navy's decision to use turbines. On 6 October the director of naval construction, M. Dudebout, urgently requested a decision while recommending that three ships use steam engines and the others turbines. He felt that this would minimize delays and expense as the design needed to be modified to accommodate the turbines and their four <b>propeller</b> <b>shafts,</b> no company in France knew how to build the turbines, and the latter were three times as expensive as steam engines. Gaston was inclined to accept Dudebout's recommendation, but prevaricated until December, after parliamentary debates showed overwhelming support for turbines in all six ships. Contracts for the remaining four ships were signed on 26 December, the day after the conclusion of the debate. Gaston also delayed in deciding on which boilers to use. He sent another technical mission to Britain to look at Babcock & Wilcox's design in April 1907, but did not make a decision in favor of French-built boilers until 3 June 1908, after all the ships had been laid down.|$|E
