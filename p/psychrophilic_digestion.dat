40|$|The {{research}} {{was aimed at}} increasing the energy production efficiency of small-scale anaerobic digesters in temperate climates while quantifying their environmental impacts. Biochemical methane potential tests were used to quantify methane (CH 4) production from separated and unseparated manure during <b>psychrophilic</b> <b>digestion,</b> and compare CH 4 production when pre-incubated alternative inocula (wetland sediment (WS), landfill leachate (LL), mesophilic digestate (MD)) were used. Methanogenic and Archaeal communities were analyzed using T-RFLP and qPCR. At 24 ºC, unseparated manure produced significantly higher (40 %) quantity of CH 4 than separated manure due to higher volatile solids (VS) content, but differences were insignificant at digestion times of ≤ 16 days. At lower digestion times, farmers could digest liquid, separated manure without sacrificing CH 4 production, but at longer digestion times, the VS in unseparated manure has the time necessary for CH 4 conversion. The alternative inocula studies showed that LL inoculum after incubation for 91 days at 25 ºC produced significantly higher quantity (≥ 20 %) of CH 4 than MD and WS during digestion at the same temperature, and was not significantly different in CH 4 quantity than MD that was incubated and digested at 35 ºC (202 ± 4 L/kg VS). Methanosarcinaceae was dominant in the LL reactor, while the other reactors were abundant in Methanosaetaceae, indicating that inoculum rich in Methanosarcinaceae may be beneficial for starting digestion at lower mesophilic temperature ranges. Longer incubation time generally reduced the inoculum amount needed for batch digestion and prevention of volatile fatty acids accumulation. In batch systems with long digestion time (90 days), MD inoculum from well-established digesters, 35 % inoculum to substrate ratio, and 35 ºC operation temperature are recommended for highest CH 4 production per unit of digester volume. Additionally, life cycle assessments (LCA) were conducted to compare the sustainability of an unheated Chinese fixed-dome digester with a heated and insulated small-scale plug-flow digester in the US. The LCA showed that the US plug-flow digester was more sustainable than the Chinese fixed-dome system only in climate change category, but contributed negatively towards 17 impact categories. Digester heating and heating infrastructure were the main contributors towards the negative impacts observed in the US plug-flow digester...|$|E
30|$|Increasingly, <b>psychrophilic</b> {{anaerobic}} <b>digestion</b> {{is shown}} to be a promising and an economical process for animal manure and farm residue treatment in clod regions (Gunnigle et al. 2015; Massé et al. 2010; Safley and Westerman 1994). However, the biotechnological potential of <b>psychrophilic</b> anaerobic <b>digestion</b> is underutilized (Kasana and Gulati 2011). Psychrophilic culture could evolve from thermophilic and mesophilic cultures through adaptation and enrichment. Analogously, adaptation and enrichment of mixed anaerobic culture could be used to develop and intensify the lignocellulose (cellulose and hemicellulose) degrading activity in the culture. Although some studies reported biomethane production from lignocellulosic substrates at mesophilic and thermophilic conditions (Adl et al. 2015; Janke et al. 2015; Kang et al. 2014), very few studies (Saady and Massé 2013) have been published on <b>psychrophilic</b> anaerobic <b>digestion</b> of cellulose and hemicellulose. Little is known about the culture kinetics when integrating low temperature with feeding lignocellulose substrate.|$|R
30|$|Recently, dry {{anaerobic}} digestion (DAD) has gained more interest. The advantages of DAD {{have been demonstrated}} at mesophilic and thermophilic conditions for the organic fraction of municipal solid wastes (15  % TS) (Challen Urbanic et al. 2011; Li et al. 2011 b; Ramasamy and Abbasi 2000) and for agricultural wastes and livestock manure (15 – 20  % TS) (Ahn et al. 2010; Kusch et al. 2008; Di Maria et al. 2012). However, in cold-climate regions psychrophilic operation is desired. Obviously, heating the bioreactor to maintain mesophilic and thermophilic conditions is an energy drain. Kashyap et al. (2003) indicated that developing a <b>psychrophilic</b> anaerobic <b>digestion</b> process to convert cattle dung into biogas and meet the energy needs at cold-climate regions is still a technological challenge; since then on-farm psychrophilic WAD has been developed and deployed (Massé et al. 1996, 1997, 2007, 2010). Presently, developing and optimizing a <b>psychrophilic</b> dry anaerobic <b>digestion</b> process is of outmost importance and could fill {{a gap in the}} {{anaerobic digestion}} market.|$|R
30|$|The {{experiments}} {{assessed the}} start-up strategy {{and duration of}} cow feces and wheat straw <b>psychrophilic</b> anaerobic <b>digestion</b> at feed total solids of 35  % and an OLR of 3.0  g TCOD kg− 1 inoculum day− 1. The operation comprised of 231  days involving eleven successive cycles. The treatment cycle length (TCL) was 21  days. The cycle includes the following steps: day 1 : loading the reactor with inoculum, feeding the substrate, and mixing the inoculum and substrate; days 1 – 21 : reaction; and day 21 : unloading the digestate and starting the next cycle.|$|R
30|$|The {{main purpose}} of the R&D {{was to develop a}} novel high-rate <b>psychrophilic</b> dry {{anaerobic}} <b>digestion</b> (PDAD) for processing a mixture of cow feces and wheat straw (CFWS) in sequencing batch bioreactor (SBR) operated at high organic loading rate (OLR). The main research question was to assess the feasibility of operating the PDAD-SBR at OLR of 9.0 and 10.0  g TCOD kg− 1  inoculum day− 1.|$|R
30|$|Psychrophilic {{conditions}} {{decrease the}} rates of chemical and biological reactions compared to mesophilic and thermophilic operations. According to microbial thermodynamic, a drop in temperature increases the energy required to enable the endothermic reactions of propionate and butyrate conversion to acetate. Similarly, temperature drop decreases the energy released from spontaneous exothermic reactions except for hydrogenotrophic microorganisms (Lettinga et al. 2001). The low rate of specific growth at psychrophilic condition restricts the lower threshold limit of the microorganisms’ retention time to prevent biomass washout in continuous systems and to achieve reasonable degree of treatment in batch systems. Generally, the start-up of <b>psychrophilic</b> anaerobic <b>digestion</b> requires long time to enable retention of sufficient slow growing microbial biomass (Dhaked et al. 2010).|$|R
40|$|Animal manure {{management}} practices, principally in regions {{where there is}} a surplus of manure are often detrimental to the environment and also represent a potential hazard to human and animal health.

40|$|Degrading {{antibiotics}} discharged in {{the livestock}} manure in a well-controlled bioprocess {{contributes to a}} more sustainable and environment-friendly livestock breeding. Although most antibiotics remain stable during manure storage, anaerobic digestion can degrade and remove them to various extents depending on the concentration and class of antibiotic, bioreactor operating conditions, type of feedstock and inoculum sources. Generally, antibiotics are degraded during composting > anaerobic digestion > manure storage > soil. Manure matrix variation influences extraction, quantification, and degradation of antibiotics, {{but it has not}} been well investigated. Fractioning of manure-laden antibiotics into liquid and solid phases and its effects on their anaerobic degradation and the contribution of abiotic (physical and chemical) versus biotic degradation mechanisms need to be quantified for various manures, antibiotics types, reactor designs and temperature of operations. More research is required to determine the kinetics of antibiotics’ metabolites degradation during anaerobic digestion. Further investigations are required to assess the degradation of antibiotics during <b>psychrophilic</b> anaerobic <b>digestion...</b>|$|R
40|$|In-storage <b>psychrophilic</b> {{anaerobic}} <b>digestion</b> develops by microbial acclimation in covered swine-manure storage tanks, producing CH 4 and stabilizing organic matter. To {{optimize the}} system's performance, the process kinetics must be understood. The {{objective of this}} study was to evaluate kinetic parameters describing the major stages in the digestion process, and to investigate the effect of temperature acclimation on these parameters. Specific activity tests were performed using manure inocula and five substrates at three incubation temperatures. Extant substrate activities were determined analytically for each case, and intrinsic kinetic parameters for glucose uptake were estimated by grid search fitting to the Monod model. The results demonstrate that this acclimated microbial community exhibits different kinetic parameters to those of the mesophilic communities currently modelled in the literature, with increased activity at low temperatures, varying with substrate and temperature. For glucose, the higher uptake is accompanied by lower microbial yield and half-saturation constant. Decomposing these values suggests that active psychrophilic and mesophilic microbial populations co-exist within the community. This work also confirms that a new method of assessing microbial substrate kinetics must be developed for manure microbial communities, separating microbial mass from other suspended organics.

40|$|Covering a {{concrete}} manure storage tank with an air-tight floating membrane should induce anaerobic digestion of the stored manure. If the microbial {{community in the}} manure can acclimate to the ambient conditions, then In-Storage <b>Psychrophilic</b> Anaerobic <b>Digestion</b> (ISPAD) {{could be used by}} Canadian livestock producers to produce methane and stabilize manure. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine whether the microbial community in swine manure can successfully acclimate to the psychrophilic operating conditions in ISPAD and develop robust anaerobic digestion. This was done in the laboratory by analyzing manure from a three-year old full-scale pilot ISPAD facility located in St. Francois Xavier, Quebec, Canada, along with fresh manure and manure from an uncovered storage tank. Biochemical methane production assays performed at the three temperatures were used to quantify the performance of the microbial community and its temperature dependence. The ISPAD microbial community produced methane, in terms of VS added, at rates of 44. 6, 9. 8 and 8. 5 dm 3 kg- 1 d- 1, at 35, 18 and 80 C, respectively.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Stabilizing organic {{solid wastes}} {{economically}} is a challenge, particularly in cold and hilly regions where the temperature can be below 20 °C. Inocula sampled from psychrophilic and mesophilic environments were introduced {{and their effects}} on <b>psychrophilic</b> dry anaerobic <b>digestion</b> of cow dung for methane production at 15 °C were investigated in single-stage batch reactors for 84 days. The {{results showed that the}} specific methane yield and volatile-solid removal in the fermentation system inoculated with psychrotroph flora had been enhanced by 28. 3 % and 28. 6 %, respectively, compared to a system inoculated with mesophilic flora. Furthermore, the start up and performance of the process had been improved. The specific methane yield was greatest when the psychrophilic dry anaerobic fermentation process was inoculated with a weight of 50 % of the substrate, among the systems with psychrophilic inocula of 30 %, 50 %, and 70 %...|$|R
30|$|Batch {{reactors}} are {{a useful}} tool to improve understanding of the outcomes of anaerobic digestion processes. Masse et al. (2010) evaluated efficiency of commercial-scale <b>psychrophilic</b> anaerobic <b>digestion</b> in sequencing batch reactors, operated at 7 or 14 days hydraulic retention time and 24 °C. The authors found that the concentrations of fecal coliforms, E. coli, Salmonella, Campylobacter spp., and Y. enterocolitica were reduced to undetectable levels in pig manure. Côté et al. (2006) found nearly complete reduction of total coliforms and E. coli by anaerobic digestion at 20 °C for 20 days while Baert et al. (2010) observed a 4 log decrease of Murine Norovirus- 1 at 37 and 52 °C after 13 and 7 days, respectively. Several {{studies have focused on}} pathogen inactivation in sludge anaerobic digestion at thermophilic temperatures to achieve Class A (complete pathogen inactivation) and Class B (incomplete pathogens removal) classification (Aitken et al. 2005; Popat et al. 2010; Puchajda et al. 2006; Smith et al. 2005; Wagner et al. 2009). For example, Shin et al. (2010) used the batch process to show decreases in bacteria 16 S rRNA gene concentrations and organic removal efficiency in anaerobic digestion of secondary sludge, while Aitken et al. (2005) measured the inactivation of vaccine - strain poliovirus and eggs from helminth Ascaris suum at temperatures from 49 to 55 °C in biosolids. Popat et al. (2010) used the batch process to estimate the inactivation kinetics of Ascaris suum and poliovirus type 1 (PVS - 1) at temperatures ranging from 51 to 56 °C. Despite previous studies to determine pathogen decay under anaerobic conditions, no information exists on the performance of anaerobic digestion in reducing pathogen concentrations in dairy manure.|$|R
30|$|Zero liquid {{discharge}} is currently an objective in livestock manure management to minimize water pollution. This paper reports the start-up {{phase of a}} novel psychrophilic (20  °C) dry anaerobic digestion of dairy manure with bedding fed at 35  % total solids and an organic loading rate of 3.0  g total chemical oxygen demand kg− 1 inoculum day− 1 in anaerobic sequence batch reactors. The specific methane (CH 4) yield ranged from 165.4  ±  9.8 to 213.9  ±  13.6 NL CH 4  kg− 1 volatile solids (VS) with an overall average of 188  ±  17 NL CH 4  kg− 1 VS during 11 successive start-up cycles (231  days) and a maximum CH 4 production rate of 10.2  ±  0.6 NL CH 4  kg− 1 VS day− 1. The inoculum-to-substrate (VS-based) ratio ranged from 4.06 to 4.47. Although methanogenesis proceeded fairly well the hydrolysis {{seemed to be the}} rate limiting step. It is possible start up <b>psychrophilic</b> dry anaerobic <b>digestion</b> of cow feces and wheat straw at feed TS of 35  % within 7 – 10 successive cycles (147 – 210  days).|$|R
40|$|Swine manure {{subjected}} to in-storage <b>psychrophilic</b> anaerobic <b>digestion</b> (ISPAD) undergoes proteins degradation but limited NH 3 volatilization, producing an effluent rich in plant-available nitrogen. Accordingly, ISPAD effluent {{can offer a}} higher fertilizer value during land application, as compared to manure of similar age stored in an open tank. However, this additional nitrogen can also be lost by volatilization during land application. The objective {{of this study was}} therefore to measure NH 3 volatilization from both ISPAD and open tank swine manures when applied to 5 different soils, namely, washed sand, a Ste Rosalie clay, an Upland sandy loam, a St Bernard loam, and an Ormstown loam. This research was conducted using laboratory wind tunnels simulating land application. The five experimental soils offered similar pH values but different water holding capacity, cation exchange capacity, cation saturation, and organic matter. After 47 [*]h of wind tunnel monitoring, the % of total available nitrogen (TAN or NH 4 [*]+ and NH 3) volatilized varied with both manure and soil type. For all soil types, the ISPAD manure consistently lost less NH 3 as compared to the open tank manure, averaging 53 % less. Lower volatile solids content improving manure infiltration into the soil and a more complex ionic solution explain the effect of the ISPAD manure advantages. This was reinforced by the St Bernard sandy loam losing the same nitrogen mass for both manures, because of its higher pH and buffer pH coupled with an intermediate CEC resulting in more soil solution NH 3. Within each manure type, % TAN volatilized was highest for washed sand and lowest for the clay soil. As a result, ISPAD manure can offer up to 21 % more plant-available nitrogen fertilizer especially when the manure is not incorporated into the soil following its application...|$|R
30|$|This study {{reports for}} the first time {{successful}} operation of psychrophilic (20  °C) dry anaerobic digestion (PDAD) of cow feces with wheat straw (CFWS) at 27  % total solids and OLR of 9.0 and 10.0  g TCOD kg− 1  inoculum day− 1 (6.53  ±  0.06 and 7.27  ±  0.12  g VS kg− 1  inoculum day− 1, respectively) in relatively short treatment cycle length (21  days). The results demonstrated the feasibility of <b>psychrophilic</b> dry anaerobic <b>digestion</b> of cow feces and wheat straw in laboratory scale sequence batch reactor (SBR) with inoculum-to-substrate ratio (VS-based) between 1.34  ±  0.12 and 1.27  ±  0.09 at the examined OLRs. The average specific methane yields (SMY) were 134.0  ±  7.7 and 136.4  ±  4.9  NL CH 4  kg− 1  VS fed at OLR of 9.0 and 10.0  g TCOD kg− 1  inoculum day− 1, respectively. Volatile solids removal at ends of the treatment cycles averaged around 35  %. Volatile fatty acids concentrations measured during the operation indicated that hydrolysis, but not acetogenesis or methanogenesis, was rate limiting. High-rate PDAD of animal manure and bedding (27  % TS) is possible, promising and has a strong potential for application in cold zones.|$|R
30|$|Generally, the {{conclusions}} reported in {{literature on the}} effect of ISR on SMY are variable. For example, decreasing the ISR from 3.33 to 1.67 caused 20  % decrease in the SMY from Okra beans refuse (9.5  % TS) mesophilic batch DAD (19  days incubation time; Zhou et al. 2011). Similarly, a decrease in VS-based ISR from 3.0 to 1.0 caused 16  % reduction in SMY during 20  days of batch mesophilic AD of maize (10  % TS; Raposo et al. 2006). On the contrary, for dry grind corn ethanol plant stillage decreasing the VS-based ISR from 3.67 to 1.83, 0.92 and 0.46, respectively, increased the SMY by 1.25, 10, and 14.2  %, respectively (Eskicioglu and Ghorbani 2011). These researchers found that the rates of VS and COD removal were lower between ISR 0.46 and 0.92 compared to those at ISR of 1.83 and 3.67. However, lower ISR led to higher percentages of CH 4 in biogas which resulted in larger SMYs. Obtaining 134.0  ±  7.7 and 136.4  ±  4.9  NL CH 4  kg− 1  VS fed at ISR of 1.34  ±  0.12 and 1.27  ±  0.09 and TCL of 21  days at psychrophilic conditions (20  °C) is an important advancement in the development of <b>psychrophilic</b> dry anaerobic <b>digestion</b> compared to the SMY values reported by other studies as given in Table  6.|$|R
30|$|The {{authors of}} this study have {{recently}} published on <b>psychrophilic</b> dry anaerobic <b>digestion</b> of cow feces and wheat straw (27  % TS in feed) at OLR 3.0 – 8.0  g TCOD kg− 1 inoculum day− 1 (Massé and Saady 2015 a, b, c; Saady and Massé 2015). Nevertheless, data on performance of PDAD of cow feces and wheat straw is not available in the accessible literature; therefore, {{the results have been}} compared to the performance of mesophilic and thermophilic DAD of various substrates {{as well as to the}} data recently published by the authors on PDAD of cow feces and wheat straw at feed TS of 27  % (Table  4). Interestingly, the average SMY (187.9  ±  16.5 NL CH 4 kg− 1 VS) obtained from feed TS of 35  % applied at OLR of 3.0  g TCOD kg− 1 inoculum day− 1 was statistically not different from the SMYs (182.9  ±  16.9 and 187.3  ±  18.4 NL CH 4 kg− 1 VS) obtained from feed TS 27  % and OLR of 3.0 and 4.0  g TCOD kg− 1 inoculum day− 1, respectively. The average yield of 187.9  ±  16.5 NL CH 4 kg− 1 VS of cow feces and wheat straw (35  % TS at OLR 3.0  g TCOD kg− 1 inoculum or 2.28  ±  0.14  kg VS fed kg− 1 inoculum day− 1) obtained in this study after 21  days of psychrophilic (20  °C) incubation during the 11 successive cycles is greater than the yield 160 NL CH 4 kg− 1 VS of dairy manure, straw, and oat husk (TS 17  % at OLR of 3.4  g VS kg− 1 day− 1) reported by Schäfer et al. (2006) for Jarna biogas plant in Sweden which operates at 38  °C and retention time of 22  days. Notice that the data reported from Jarna plant is for a steady-state condition where the inoculum was adapted to the substrate and the operation condition for 3  years at the time of the study reported by Schäfer et al. (2006). The SMYs from cow feces and wheat straw at a TCL of 21  days in any of the PDAD eleven successive cycles (TS 35  %) obtained in this study were higher than 28 L CH 4 kg− 1 VS of dairy manure and switch grass (15  % TS) obtained by Ahn et al. (2010) during 62  days of thermophilic (55  °C) incubation. The difference between Ahn et al. (2010) and this study results demonstrate the importance of prolonged adaptation period and the importance of ISR. Ahn et al. (2010) used low ISR (0.2) and non-adapted inoculum in short time study while in this study the inoculum was adapted during around 36  months to stepwise increase in the feed’s total solids (data not shown) and sufficient quantity of inoculum has been used (VS-based ISR ranged between 1.7 and 3.8). The average SMY (188  ±  17 NL CH 4 kg− 1 VS) is similar to 181 L CH 4 kg− 1 VS of beef manure and straw (TS 18  % and OLR of 3.2  g VS kg− 1 day− 1) at 32  °C and retention time of 28  days reported previously (Schäfer et al. 2006) (Table  4). Compared to Schäfer et al. (2006) result, the current study demonstrated an increase of 94  % in the feed total solids and reduction in the treatment cycle length by 25  % while saving the energy consumed in heating the bioreactor (to increase the temperature from 20 to 37  °C); these improvements translate into 35 and 25  % reduction in the required volume of the bioreactor, respectively, while at the same time cutting the reactor heating expenses by operating at psychrophilic condition. Notice that the high yields (> 250 NL CH 4 kg− 1 VS fed) reported by Li et al. (2011 a) was for mesophilic anaerobic digestion of cow manure and wastewater sludge (16  % TS) in 63  days of TCL. Similarly, the yield (339 – 423 NL CH 4 kg− 1 total VS) reported by Sun et al. (1987) in Table  4 have been obtained for long retention times (156 – 198  days) and low OLR (0.35  kg TCOD kg− 1 inoculum day− 1) in mesophilic anaerobic digestion of rice straw and corn stover (TS 15 – 30  %). Interestingly, these researchers reported a very low SMY (34 NL CH 4 kg− 1 VS fed) for the same substrate and experimental conditions at TS 35  %. Achieving a stable dry anaerobic digestion of cow manure and wheat straw at psychrophilic condition and feed TS of 35  % and OLR of OLR 3.0  g TCOD kg− 1 inoculum or 2.28  ±  0.14  kg VS fed kg− 1 inoculum day− 1 over long-term start-up operation is a significant improvement given that 30  % TS has been recently identified as a threshold above which methanogenesis was strongly inhibited for cardboard batch anaerobic digestion at 35  °C (Abbassi-Guendouz et al. 2012).|$|R
