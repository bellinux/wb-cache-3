40|$|The {{mechanism}} of the selective dispersion of single-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) by polyfluorene polymers is studied in this paper. Using extensive molecular dynamics simulations, it is demonstrated that diameter selectivity {{is the result of}} a competition between bundling of CNTs and adsorption of polymers on CNT surfaces. The preference for certain diameters corresponds to local minima of the binding energy difference between these two processes. Such minima in the diameter dependence occur due to abrupt changes in the CNT's coverage with polymers and their calculated positions are in quantitative agreement with <b>preferred</b> <b>diameters,</b> reported experimentally. The presented approach defines a theoretical framework for the further understanding and improvement of dispersion/extraction processes. Comment: 22 pages, 5 figures, ACS Nano (2015...|$|R
40|$|Ceramides {{are known}} {{to play a major}} {{regulatory}} role in apoptosis by inducing cytochrome c release from mitochondria. We have previously reported that ceramide, but not dihydroceramide, forms large and stable channels in phospholipid membranes and outer membranes of isolated mitochondria. C 2 -ceramide channel formation is characterized by conductance increments ranging from 200 nS. These conductance increments often represent the enlargement and contracture of channels rather than the opening and closure of independent channels. Enlargement is supported by the observation that many small conductance increments can lead to a large decrement. Also the initial conductances favor cations, but this selectivity drops dramatically with increasing total conductance. La+ 3 causes rapid ceramide channel disassembly in a manner indicative of large conducting structures. These channels have a propensity to contract by a defined size (often multiples of 4 nS) indicating the formation of cylindrical channels with <b>preferred</b> <b>diameters</b> rather than a continuum of sizes. The results are consistent with ceramides forming barrel-stave channels whose size can change by loss or insertion of multiple ceramide columns...|$|R
40|$|It is {{established}} {{that at the}} present moment the roller screws (RS) are the most challenging mechanical transducers of rotational motion into forward motion. For that reason their field of application is being constantly enlarged. In the West one can observe the tendency of the replacement of hydraulic drive by RS-based electromechanical drive. The main RS parts are screw, thread rollers and female screw which on the load transmission interact in the contact lands located on the pitch diameters of the special thread of these parts. To exclude the edge contacts on the male screw and female screw the thread with triangular profile waps are performed, on the rollers – with convex profile. Besides the pitch diameters of the male screw, rollers and female screw thread form the closed-loop dimension chain, and the values of these diameters affect the RS axial play and its performance capabilities significantly. Therefrom in manufacturing thread pieces it is required {{to carry out the}} high-precision control of their thread pitch diameters. For the male thread this control is carried out by means of three cylindrical wires with <b>preferred</b> <b>diameter.</b> Such wires are available at the factories of the Russian Federation and are represented in AllUnion State Standard 2475 - 88 for the standard thread (metric, trapeziform and others), and they are not available for the RS pieces special thread.

The chemical thinning methods applied in the year 2001 were Ethrel (Flordimex) at 500 ml/ha, Ethrel at 1000 ml/ha, Ammonium Thiosulphate (ATS) sprayed to flowers on one year old shoots (ATS 1), Ammonium Thiosulphate (ATS) sprayed to flowers on older shoots (ATS 2), Amidthin plus Telmion, Amidthin plus Ethrel and unsprayed control. In 2002 the chemical thinning treatments applied were Azolon fluid (Urea formaldehyde), sprayed at 7. 5 li/ha and Ethrel (Flordimex) sprayed at 300 ml/ha and unsprayed control. The non-chemical thinning method which was only applied in 2002 was partial defoliation of leaves. The experimental design used was randomized complete block design with three replications. The results showed that in the year 2001 Ethrel at 1000 ml/ha had 67 % thinning effect while Ethrel at 500 ml/ha had 40 % thinning. The other treatments had no thinning effect.

40|$|An {{understanding}} of the dynamical behaviour of adsorbates on surfaces {{is essential to the}} development of materials and devices with controlled structure on the nanometre scale. In this thesis I examine two systems. The major part of the work concerns the development of a source of size selected metallic clusters, and the deposition and diffusion of silver clusters on a highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) surface. The final part of the thesis reports an investigation of electron stimulated desorption of ions from O_ 2 films on HOPG. In chapter one, I review recent work in cluster physics, concentrating mainly on experiments with deposited clusters. Chapter two is a review of techniques used to generate free cluster beams. This includes examination of the various technologies and techniques involved in cluster production, beam formation, and mass selection. This chapter also gives a detailed account of the principles of operation of a gas condensation cluster source. In chapter three, I present a detailed account of the design, characterisation and commissioning of a gas condensation cluster source. Chapter four contains the results of a series of experiments on the deposition and diffusion of silver clusters on HOPG. The results of landing clusters with controlled kinetic energy (KE) show that silver clusters deposited with a KE of 400 eV or more become pinned to the surface, whereas clusters deposited with 200 eV or less diffuse across the surface after landing and aggregate into round particles with a 'universal' diameter of #approx# 14 nm. This <b>preferred</b> <b>diameter</b> is attributed to the strain between the silver and graphite lattices. The deposition rate and the cluster impact angle are also shown to be important parameters, which strongly influence the morphology of the islands. Computer simulation results indicate that, to produce the observed island size distributions, the mobility of the particles must fall off rapidly as their size increases. In chapter five, I present results from angular resolved electron stimulated desorption studies of 0 "-, 0 _ 2 "-, and 0 _ 3 "-, produced from ordered films of 0 _ 2 on HOPG. Resonances in the yields of all products as a function of electron impact energy are attributed to dissociative electron attachment, generating 0 "- ions, which can react with neighbouring O_ 2 molecules in the film. Characteristic differences in the ion yield profiles from one product to another are explained in terms of a binary collision model, which estimates the KE of the ion products, and thus the probability of escape from the polarisation potential induced in the 0 _ 2 film. The model is consistent with the measured angular distributions of desorbed ions.

40|$|DNA-filled capsids (C capsids) of {{herpes simplex}} virus type 1 were treated in vitro with guanidine-HCl (GuHCl) and {{analyzed}} for DNA loss by sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation and electron microscopy. DNA {{was found to be}} lost quantitatively from virtually all capsids treated with GuHCl at concentrations of 0. 5 M or higher, while 0. 1 M GuHCl had little or no effect. DNA removal from 0. 5 M GuHCl-treated capsids was effected without significant change in the capsid protein composition, as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, or in its structure, as judged by electron microscopy. Electron microscopic examination of capsids in the process of emptying showed that DNA was extruded from multiple, discrete sites which appeared to coincide with capsid vertices. DNA exited the capsid in the form of thick strands or fibers that varied in diameter from approximately 4 to 13 nm with <b>preferred</b> <b>diameters</b> of 7 and 11 nm. The fibers most probably correspond to multiple, laterally aligned DNA segments, as their diameters are nearly all greater than that of a single DNA double helix. The results suggest that GuHCl treatment promotes an alteration in the capsid pentons which allows DNA to escape locally. Hexons must be more resistant to this change, since DNA loss appears to be restricted to the pentons. The ability of GuHCl to cause loss of DNA from C capsids with no accompanying change in capsid morphology or protein composition suggests that penton sites may open transiently to permit DNA exist and then return to their original state...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe spatiotemporal {{features}} of the "static" receptive field (RF), as revealed with flashing bars or spots, determine other RF properties. We examined how some of these static RF features vary with contrast and contrast adaptation in area V 1 of the anesthetized macaque monkey. RFs were mapped with light and dark flashing bars presented at three different contrasts, with the low and medium contrasts eliciting approximately 1 / 3 and 2 / 3 of the high-contrast response amplitude. The main results are as follows: 1) RF widths decreased when contrast decreased; however, the amount of decrease was less than that expected from an iceberg model {{and closer to the}} expectation of a contrast invariance of the RF width. 2) Area tuning experiments with drifting gratings showed an opposite effect of contrast: an increase in <b>preferred</b> stimulus <b>diameter</b> when contrast decreased. This implies that the effect of contrast on preferred stimulus size is not predictable from the static RF. 3) Contrast adaptation attenuated the effect of contrast on RF amplitude but did not significantly modify RF width. 4) RF subregion overlap was only marginally affected by changes in contrast and contrast adaptation; the classification of cells as simple and complex, when established from subregion overlap, appears to be robust with respect to changes in contrast and adaptation state.

This study compared a set of height-diameter models for loblolly (Pinus taeda) and shortleaf (Pinus echinata) pines from Ashley County, Arkansas. Almost 560 trees ranging in diameter at breast height (DBH) from 0. 3 cm (both species) to 91. 9 cm (for shortleaf) or 108. 2 cm (for loblolly) were chosen for measurement. Height equations were then fit to four different functions (Chapman-Richards, modified logistic, exponential, and Curtis-Arney) with weighted nonlinear least squares regression using DBH as the only predictor. Models were evaluated using a series of goodness-of-fit measures, including fit index (R 2), {{root mean square error}} (RMSE), bias, and corrected Akaike information criterion (AICc). All of the models fit the data very well, with 96 to 98 % of the variation explained for loblolly pine, and 96 to 97 % explained for shortleaf pine. Similarly, few differences were apparent in RMSE, bias, and AICc, although {{it was clear that the}} Curtis-Arney function fit both pine species slightly less well across the upper range of the diameters. Only subtle differences appeared in curve shape for small- to moderate-sized pines, with increasing departures predicted above 75 cm DBH.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{three-dimensional}} structure of proteins {{by a computer}} program that finds regions of sequence that contain module boundaries, defining a module as a segment of polypeptide chain bounded in space by a specific given distance. The program defines a set of “linker regions” that have the property that if an intron were to be placed into each linker region, the protein would be dissected into a set of modules all less than the specified diameter. We test a set of 32 proteins, all of ancient origin, and a corresponding set of 570 intron positions, to ask {{if there is a}} statistically significant excess of intron positions within the linker regions. For 28 -Å modules, a standard size used historically, we find such an excess, with P < 0. 003. This correlation is neither due to a compositional or sequence bias in the linker regions nor to a surface bias in intron positions. Furthermore, a subset of 20 introns, which can be putatively identified as old, lies even more explicitly within the linker regions, with P < 0. 0003. Thus, there is a strong correlation between intron positions and three-dimensional structural elements of ancient proteins as expected by the introns-early approach. We then study a range of module diameters and show that, as the diameter varies, significant peaks of correlation appear for module diameters centered at 21. 7, 27. 6, and 32. 9 Å.

The home ranges of males were larger than those of females (mean MCP estimates of 1. 07 +/- 0. 15 and 0. 45 +/- 0. 06 ha respectively). C. penicillatus denned primarily in fallen logs and in hollows of eucalypts and bloodwoods (Corymbia spp.).

It is commonly believed that the WZ phase is more <b>preferred</b> in small <b>diameter</b> III-V NWs due to the thermodynamically lower energy surfaces. Although the ZB phase is favored in the bulk material, when the materials are scaled down to the nanometer, there exists a transition regime where the dominant ZB phase is replaced by the WZ structure. NWs with the diameter of approximately 10 to 25 nm for GaAs and approximately 50 to 60 nm for InAs are reported as the critical diameters for this transition in the literature[11, 12, 23 – 25]. Consequently, as most of our NWs are grown in the diameter < 14 nm (mean = 9.5 nm), well below the critical diameter, it is predictable that all NWs existed in the WZ phase on amorphous substrates.|$|R
40|$|Background Three decades ago, the {{increased}} demand for sea urchin roe stimulated large scale harvesting of the green sea urchin Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis from the Gulf of Maine. Beginning in 1987, the rapid rise in harvests off the coasts of Maine and New Hampshire made urchin recruitment the second largest wild fishery operation behind lobsters with a peak of 39 million pounds in 1993 (1). Since then, the subsequent decline in harvests paralleled the reduction in urchin populations especially in locations where natural recruitment occurred at high densities. This drastic shift in ecology {{can be observed in}} the southwestern portion of Maine, where extensive areas of urchin-dominated communities have become algae-dominated and completely devoid of urchins (1, 2). The overfishing of sea urchins led to increased interest in a hatchery system for stock enhancement and replenishment of natural populations. The goal of the hatchery system is to produce commercial quantities of sea urchins for out planting into the wild as quickly and economically as possible. Currently, it appears out planting is most successful in the winter. Since spawning begins by January or February, this design allows the urchins one year from spawning to out planting at the <b>preferred</b> test <b>diameter</b> of 15 mm (1). From newly settled (0. 5 mm) to out planting (15 mm), the goal of the hatchery system is to rapidly while efficiently increase the somatic growth rate of the animals. Problem The goal of the hatchery is to produce commercial quantities of the animals in the least amount of time and with the most economical method. However, urchin feed is not well studied for its nutrient composition in relationship with somatic growth especially during the juvenile stage of the animal as it reaches the out planting test diameter of 15 mm. Therefore, current feed could be inept in providing the greatest rate of growth possible for the urchin hatchery. The nutrient composition of urchin feed is a key factor in the efficiency of the hatchery process...|$|R

Such assessment of "propensity" is important in understanding issues such as a reported under-utilisation of BCS among women for whom such treatment was not contraindicated. Using Western Australian (WA) data, we further examine the factors associated {{with the type of}} surgical treatment for breast cancer using a classification tree approach. This approach deals naturally with complicated interactions between factors, and so allows flexible and interpretable models for treatment choice to be built that add to the current understanding of this complex decision process. METHODS: Data was extracted from the WA Cancer Registry on women diagnosed with breast cancer in WA from 1990 to 2000. Subjects' treatment preferences were predicted from covariates using both classification trees and logistic regression. RESULTS: Tumor size was the primary determinant of patient choice, subjects with tumors smaller than 20 mm in <b>diameter</b> <b>preferring</b> BCS. For subjects with tumors greater than 20 mm in diameter factors such as patient age, nodal status, and tumor histology become relevant as predictors of patient choice. CONCLUSION: Classification trees perform as well as logistic regression for predicting patient choice, but are much easier to interpret for clinical use. The selected tree can inform clinicians' advice to patients...|$|R
40|$|Several ultrasound-based {{methods are}} {{currently}} {{used to assess}} aortic diameter, circumferential strain and stiffness in mice, {{but none of them}} is flawless and a gold standard is lacking. We aimed to assess the validity and sensitivity of these methods in control animals and animals developing dissecting abdominal aortic aneurysm. We first compared systolic and diastolic diameters as well as local circumferential strains obtained in 47 Angiotensin II-infused ApoE(-/-) mice with three different techniques (BMode, short axis MMode, long axis MMode), at two different abdominal aortic locations (supraceliac and paravisceral), and at three different time points of abdominal aneurysm formation (baseline, 14 days and 28 days). We found that short axis BMode was <b>preferred</b> to assess <b>diameters,</b> but should be avoided for strains. Short axis MMode gave good results for diameters but high standard deviations for strains. Long axis MMode should be avoided for diameters, and was comparable to short axis MMode for strains. We then compared pulse wave velocity measurements using global, ultrasound-based transit time or regional, pressure-based transit time in 10 control and 20 angiotensin II-infused, anti-TGF-Beta injected C 57 BL/ 6 mice. Both transit-time methods poorly correlated and were not able to detect a significant difference in PWV between controls and aneurysms. However, a combination of invasive pressure and MMode diameter, based on radio-frequency data, detected a highly significant difference in local aortic stiffness between controls and aneurysms, with low standard deviation. In small animal ultrasound the short axis view is preferred over the long axis view to measure aortic diameters, local methods are preferred over transit-time methods to measure aortic stiffness, invasive pressure-diameter data are preferred over non-invasive strains to measure local aortic stiffness, and the use of radiofrequency data improves the accuracy of diameter, strain as well as stiffness measurements...|$|R

40|$|The Northern Goshawk (Accipiter gentilis, {{henceforth}} goshawk) is {{the largest}} North American member of the genus Accipiter. Like other accipiters, the goshawk has short, broad wings and a long tail and is well adapted to hunting in woodlands (Palmer 1988). It is a sit-and-wait predator that frequently switches perches and often uses stealth and cover while hunting, and will chase prey through vegetation (Squires and Reynolds 1997). Despite its use of trees for nesting, the goshawk will hunt in open habitats. A variety of prey items is taken, including medium-sized passerines (e. g., American Robin, Turdus migratorius, and Northern Flicker, Colaptes auratus; Younk and Bechard 1994), tree and ground squirrels (e. g., red squirrel, Tamiasciurus hudsonicus, and Belding 2 ̆ 7 s ground squirrel, Spermophilus beldingi; Reynolds et al. 1994, Younk and Bechard 1994), galliformes (e. g., Ruffed Grouse, Bonasa umbellus; Bosakowski and Smith 1992), and lagomorphs (e. g., snowshoe hare, Lepus americanus; Doyle and Smith 1994, Watson et al. 1998). Typically associated with mature and old-growth conifer forests (Squires and Reynolds 1997), goshawks have been found breeding {{in a variety of}} habitats including conifer forests of the Pacific Northwest (Reynolds et al. 1982, Finn et al. 2002); ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests of the Kaibab Plateau in northern Arizona (Reynolds and Joy 1998); mixed conifer forests of east-central Arizona (Ingraldi 1998); hardwood and conifer forests of New York, New Jersey, and Wisconsin (Speiser and Bosakowski 1987, Rosenfield et al. 1998); and tundra in Alaska (Swem and Adams 1992). In northern Nevada, goshawks breed in naturally-fragmented, high-elevation aspen (Populus tremuloides) stands that are typically surrounded by sagebrush steppe habitat (Younk and Bechard 1994). Several studies have addressed goshawk nesting habitat and generally agree that goshawks <b>prefer</b> larger <b>diameter,</b> mature trees for nesting, and nest stands typically have a relatively high degree of canopy closure and an open understory with low shrub cover (Squires and Reynolds 1997). Sizes of nest stands vary depending on location, but can be ≤ 1 ha (Herron et al. 1985, Younk 1996, Squires and Ruggiero 1996). Goshawk movements are not well understood in the United States, but evidence indicates that migration occurs in some populations, but can vary from year to year (see Squires and Reynolds 1997 for a review). A few studies suggest that movements in northern populations may be related to food availability. Goshawks at Kluane, Yukon Territory, Canada exhibited increasingly nomadic behavior of unreported distances in response to declining snowshoe hare populations, being year- round residents when hare densities were high and almost completely absent during winters of low hare abundance (Doyle and Smith 1994). Goshawk populations in Wyoming exhibited local and/or altitudinal movements in winter (Squires and Ruggiero 1995). HawkWatch International migration count sites in northern Utah, eastern Nevada, and central New Mexico regularly record goshawks during fall migration through the Intermountain and Rocky Mountain west. Annual numbers range from three to 3 ̆e 200 individuals, depending on year and location (Smith and Hoffman 1997). In the late 1980 s and early 1990 s, concern increased over reported declining goshawk populations (Bloom et al. 1986, Crocker-Bedford 1990, Reynolds et al. 1992). Attempts to list the goshawk under the Endangered Species Act in both the southwestern (Federal Register 1992 a) and western United States (Federal Register 1992 b) failed (see Kennedy 1997 for a summary). The USDI Fish and Wildlife Service classified the goshawk as a Category 2 species until the elimination of that category in 1996, and currently the goshawk is considered a Sensitive Species in regions 3, 4, and 5 of the USDA Forest Service (Kennedy 1997). In northern Nevada, the Nevada Department of Wildlife and Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest voiced concern over potential impacts of surface gold mining on goshawk breeding. Because the ecological effects of gold mining on goshawks were unknown and goshawk ecology in sagebrush steppe habitat was poorly understood, a cooperative study began in 1991 in the Independence and Bull Run Mountain ranges (Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest) to document aspects of goshawk breeding ecology, habitat use, and food habits in this habitat type. Cooperators included Nevada Department of Wildlife, Independence Mining Company (now AngloGold- Meridian Jerritt Canyon Joint Venture), USDA Forest Service, and Boise State University. Although the initial study ended in 1993 (Younk 1996), researchers recognized that the population data were important because previous to the study little information was known about goshawks breeding in sagebrush steppe habitats. Therefore, Boise State University graduate students continued to collect goshawk reproduction data annually through 2002. This project is the longest-running population study of goshawks breeding in sagebrush steppe habitat. I analyzed goshawk reproductive, demographic, band recovery, and diet data from 1992 - 2002, using data I collected in 2001 and 2002, and data collected by Boise State University graduate students James V. Younk (1992 - 1994), Michael S. Shipman (1995 - 1997), and B. Heath Smith (1998 - 2000). My research goals were to (1) document long-term trends in reproductive statistics as they related to gold mining, (2) examine the relationship between weather and goshawk reproduction, (3) document natal and breeding dispersal, and (4) describe goshawk food habits in the study area. Because Younk (1996) considered 1991 a pilot study, I did not include that year in my analyses...|$|R
