40|$|Bionomics {{of malaria}} vectors {{including}} species composition, resting and biting behaviour and insecticide resistance {{are important for}} insecticide-based malaria control and interventions. The lack of data on malaria vector species composition and relative abundance, resting and biting behaviour, as well as insecticide resistance, make the development of target control measures problematic in Mutare and Mutasa Districts. It is imperative to elucidate, characterize, and identify {{all members of the}} An. funestus group and the An. gambiae complex to determine their resting and biting behaviour, host-seeking activities, disease relationships, and resistance to insecticides. A longitudinal study was carried out to investigate the bionomics of malaria vector mosquitoes in Mutare and Mutasa Districts. Anopheline larval and adult sampling was conducted from May 2013 to December 2014 using scooping, pyrethrum spray catch, prokopac aspirator, exit window trap, pit shelter, and Centers for Disease Control (CDC) light trap methods. Indoor and outdoor resting mosquitoes were collected in randomly selected houses and pit shelters, respectively. Mosquitoes sampled by light traps were divided into two cohorts. In one cohort, traps were left overnight and mosquitoes collected the following morning, while in the other set, mosquitoes were collected hourly throughout the night. Mosquito samples for insecticide resistance testing were divided into two subsamples. One subsample was used immediately for WHO susceptibility assays and the other batch was allowed to oviposit in the insectary at the National Institute of Health Research, and females from the F 1 progeny were used in further susceptibility assays. Mosquitoes were identified using morphological keys and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques. The PCR-based assays showed the presence of four sibling species: Anopheles funestus sensu stricto (90. 8 %, 267 / 294) and An. leesoni (5. 1 %, 15 / 294) of the An. funestus group and An. arabiensis (41. 9 %, 13 / 31) and An. quadriannulatus (48. 4 %, 15 / 31) of the An. gambiae complex. Of the two malaria vectors, An. funestus sensu stricto was more abundant (95. 4 %, 267 / 280) than An. arabiensis (4. 6 %, 13 / 280). Endophilic collections of the An. funestus group and the An. gambiae complex were five times greater than exophilic catches. Nearly 90 % endophilic An. funestus populations were collected on sprayable surfaces and the remainder was caught on unsprayable surfaces. Of the sprayable surfaces catches, 56 % were collected on the roofs; with 44 % on the walls. Of the gravid An. funestus caught, nearly two-thirds (218 / 330) were collected exiting recently pyrethroid-treated structures, with a 24 -hour mortality of less than 10 %. The CDC light trap catches were more abundant indoors (68 %) than outdoors (32 %). Anopheles funestus showed variable indoor and outdoor flight activity rhythms, with two peaks during the night; between 22 : 00 - 23 : 00 hours and 02 : 00 - 04 : 00 hours. Human blood index was 64. 3 %, with Plasmodium falciparum infection rate of 1. 8 %. Wild caught females showed resistance to lambda-cyhalothrin (3. 3 % mortality), deltamethrin (12. 9 % mortality), etofenprox (9. 2 % mortality), and bendiocarb (11. 7 % mortality). F 1 An. funestus females showed resistance to deltamethrin (14. 5 % mortality), lambda-cyhalothrin (6. 9 % mortality), etofenprox (8. 3 % mortality), and bendiocarb (16. 8 % mortality), but were susceptible to DDT and pirimiphos-methyl (100 % mortality). Intensity resistance assay to bendiocarb had 100 % mortality, while deltamethrin, lambda-cyhalothrin, and etofenprox had increased knockdown times with mortalities ranging between 66. 7 and 92. 7 % after 24 -hour exposures. The present work revealed important information on the behaviour of malaria vector mosquitoes in Mutare and Mutasa Districts, which if not addressed might threaten gains made in malaria control in the study area. It is imperative to change house-spraying insecticide from pyrethroids to organophosphates or DDT (organochlorine), develop an insecticide resistance management plan, provide extension lances to the house-spraying <b>programme,</b> <b>complement</b> mosquito nets with the use of mosquito repellents and long clothes, and establish a monitoring programme to determine the occurrence and distribution of An. funestus populations in Manicaland Province...|$|E

40|$|Identifying and characterising {{nanomaterials}} {{require additional}} information on physico-chemical properties and test methods, compared to chemicals in general. Furthermore, regulatory decisions for chemicals are usually based upon certain toxicological properties, and these effects may not be equivalent to those for nanomaterials. However, regulatory agencies lack an authoritative decision framework for nanomaterials that links the relevance of certain physico-chemical endpoints to toxicological effects. This paper investigates various physicochemical endpoints and available test methods {{that could be used}} to produce such a decision framework for nanomaterials. It presents an overview of regulatory relevance and methods used for testing fifteen proposed physico-chemical properties of eleven nanomaterials in the OECD Working Party on Manufactured Nanomaterials' Testing <b>Programme,</b> <b>complemented</b> with methods from literature, and assesses the methods' adequacy and applications limits. Most endpoints are of regulatory relevance, though the specific parameters depend on the nanomaterial and type of assessment. Size (distribution) is the common characteristic of all nanomaterials and is decisive information for classifying a material as a nanomaterial. Shape is an important particle descriptor. The octanol-water partitioning coefficient is undefined for particulate nanomaterials. Methods, including sample preparation, need to be further standardised, and some new methods are needed.

Later, during the 5 th century, he {{became known as}} the god of healing, and in this century the Asclepian cult of healing became established in Epidaurus. This healing cult, which was accommodated by empiric (Hippocratic) physicians of the time, endured for close on ten centuries in Asclepieia, of which there were more than 400 in the Mediterranean area and surrounding countries. The Asclepieia were of different design, but usually included a temple dedicated to the god, as well as inscriptions [iamata] with information on the patients who were healed, a sacred bath, a well and a room [abaton] for so-called incubation sleep where the patient would spend the night. Asclepius traditionally appeared to the patients in a vision {{in the course of the}} night and an immediate miraculous healing could take place, or advice was given regarding the future treatment of the patient, which was in the morning thereafter discussed by the temple personnel. It is said that the Asclepian cult, a religious healing <b>programme,</b> <b>complemented</b> secular treatment since the tempel personnel were in contact with contemporary Hippocratic medicine. The emotional impact of the incubation sleep and dreams could have had a healing impact on ailments with a psycological basis.

WP PFC addresses these critical points in order to ensure reliable and efficient use of conventional, solid PFCs in ITER (Be and W) and DEMO (W and steel) with respect to heat-load capabilities (transient and steady-state heat and particle loads), lifetime estimates (erosion, material mixing and surface morphology), and safety aspects (fuel retention, fuel removal, material migration and dust formation) particularly for quasi-steady-state conditions. Alternative scenarios and concepts (liquid Sn or Li as PFCs) for DEMO are developed and tested in the event that the conventional solution turns out to not be functional.
