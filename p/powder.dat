5|$|Another {{method of}} {{increasing}} firepower was to vary the projectile fired or {{the nature of}} the propellant. Early ironclads used black <b>powder,</b> which expanded rapidly after combustion; this meant cannons had relatively short barrels, to prevent the barrel itself slowing the shell. The sharpness of the black <b>powder</b> explosion also meant that guns were subjected to extreme stress. One important step was to press the <b>powder</b> into pellets, allowing a slower, more controlled explosion and a longer barrel. A further step forward was the introduction of chemically different brown <b>powder</b> which combusted more slowly again. It also put less stress on the insides of the barrel, allowing guns to last longer and to be manufactured to tighter tolerances.|$|E

40|$|Abstract In this study, intermediate-mixed <b>powders</b> were {{prepared}} by loading zirconia <b>powders</b> initially in a ball-mill jar and loading alumina <b>powders</b> afterward; the initial-mixed <b>powders</b> were produced by loading zirconia and alumina <b>powders</b> {{together in the}} ball-mill jar. The effect of such differences in mixing method on the mechanical properties was investigated. In intermediate-mixed <b>powders,</b> the volume fraction of large particles slightly increased and, simultaneously, zirconia particles formed agglomerates that, due to early ball-mill loading of the zirconia <b>powders</b> only, were more dispersed than were the initial-mixed <b>powders.</b> For the intermediate-mixed <b>powders,</b> zirconia agglomerates were destroyed more quickly than were initial-mixed <b>powders,</b> so the number of dispersed zirconia particles rose and the inhibitory effect of densification due to {{the addition of a}} second phase was more obvious. In the microstructure of intermediate-mixed <b>powders,</b> zirconia grains were homogeneously dispersed and grain growth by coalescence was found to occur with increasing sintering temperature. For the initial-mixed <b>powders,</b> large zirconia grains formed by localized early-densification on the inside contacts of some zirconia agglomerates were observed {{in the early stages of}} sintering. The intermediate-mixed <b>powders</b> had slightly lower hardness values as a whole but higher fracture toughness compared to that of the initial-mixed <b>powders...</b>|$|R
40|$|Tungsten carbide <b>powders</b> are {{typically}} produced either by carburization of tungsten metal <b>powders</b> (W) or by carbothermal reduction of tungsten oxide <b>powders</b> (WO 3).

5|$|Two {{competing}} {{theories have}} arisen {{about the cause}} of the explosion. The first is that the bomb detonated in or near the black <b>powder</b> magazine used for the ship's saluting guns and catapult charges. This would have detonated first and then ignited the smokeless <b>powder</b> magazines which was used for the ship's main armament. A 1944 Navy Bureau of Ships report suggests that a hatch leading to the black <b>powder</b> magazine was left open, possibly with flammable materials stocked nearby. The Naval History and Heritage Command explained that black <b>powder</b> might have been stockpiled outside the armored magazine. The alternative explanation is that the bomb penetrated the armored decks and detonated directly inside one of the starboard magazines for the main armament, but smokeless <b>powder</b> is relatively difficult to detonate. Thus the 14-inch <b>powder</b> bags required a black <b>powder</b> pad to quickly ignite the <b>powder.</b> The time elapsed from the bomb hit to the magazine explosion was shorter than experience suggested burning smokeless <b>powder</b> required to explode. It seems unlikely that a definitive answer to this question will ever be found, as the surviving physical evidence is insufficient to determine {{the cause of the}} magazine explosion.|$|E
