5|$|By late 1940 {{there were}} severe {{shortages}} of <b>pilots</b> <b>and</b> wireless operators/gunners, with 100 <b>pilots</b> <b>and</b> 200 other personnel required. In {{the short term}} the OTU course was reduced to get the crews out to operational commands faster. It now took no longer than a month compared with the {{six to eight weeks}} considered necessary. This reduced the number of fit <b>pilots,</b> <b>and</b> the quality of pilots overall. The number of unfit pilots was recorded at 374. To cope with the shortening of training, it had to have a well-stocked general training programme. Coastal Command did not possess such an administration. Only 24 pupils were graduating when the minimum requirement was 64. This was compensated by the removal of gunnery and bombing training and a reduction in night and formation flying. Still, Bomber Command received most of the 36,000 aircrew between 1940 and 1942. Entry requirements for crews were relaxed and the programmes found more recruits that way. Manpower was also supplemented by the Commonwealth with Canada providing some of the 6,500 personnel sought by the Air Ministry. By the end of 1941, the operational strength of Coastal Command increased by seven squadrons.|$|E
5|$|During {{its final}} flight, the {{aircraft}} was carrying 144 passengers, two <b>pilots,</b> <b>and</b> four {{cabin crew members}} from at least 18 countries—mostly Germany and Spain. The count was confused by the multiple citizenship status of some people on board.|$|E

5|$|Jagdgeschwader 27 and IV./Jagdgeschwader 54 (JG 27 and JG 54) {{targeted}} Melsbroek airfield. On 31 December, JG 27 {{could only}} muster the following operational <b>pilots</b> <b>and</b> aircraft: 22 (22) from I., 19 (13) from II., 13 (15) from III., and 16 (17) from IV. Gruppe. Geschwaderkommadore Wolfgang Späte had rebuilt IV./JG 54. It had only 21 <b>pilots</b> <b>and</b> 15 of its 23 Fw 190s were operational. Altogether 28 Bf 109s of JG 27 and 15 Fw 190s of JG 54 took off. Seven fighters were lost to enemy aircraft and friendly AAA fire {{before they reached}} the target.|$|E
25|$|The {{cabin was}} covered almost entirely with Plexiglas windows {{providing}} visibility {{in all directions}} except directly underneath the aircraft.

5|$|US {{intelligence}} officers believe {{the most likely}} explanation was that someone in the cockpit of Flight 370 re-programmed the aircraft's autopilot before it travelled south across the Indian Ocean.

On 2 April 2014, Malaysia's Police Inspector-General said that more than 170 interviews had been conducted as part of Malaysia's criminal investigation, including interviews with family members of the <b>pilots</b> <b>and</b> crew.|$|E
5|$|After Midway and the {{exhausting}} attrition of the Solomon Islands campaign, Japan's capacity to replace its losses in materiel (particularly aircraft carriers) and men (especially well-trained <b>pilots</b> <b>and</b> maintenance crewmen) rapidly became insufficient {{to cope with}} mounting casualties, while the United States' massive industrial and training capabilities made losses far easier to replace. The Battle of Midway, along with the Guadalcanal Campaign, is widely considered {{a turning point in}} the Pacific War.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{accident}} rate per 100 million miles for professional truckers is low, {{the high number}} of miles driven by a truck driver makes truck driving a risky occupation. Trucking transportation occupations accounted for one quarter of all work-related fatalities in 2015, more than any other U.S. job, according to the U.S. Labor Department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics' annual workplace fatality report. The fatal injury rate in 2015 was 14.7 per 100,000 full-time equivalent workers in transportation and material moving occupations (which includes both truckers and air transportation workers.) This was a significantly lower rate than for workers in farming, fishing, and forestry occupations, but high compared to most other occupation categories. The report did not break out the fatal injury rate per 100,000 full-time equivalent workers among aircraft <b>pilots</b> <b>and</b> flight engineers but did note that they had a high fatal injury rate compared to all workers. There were 57 fatalities among aircraft <b>pilots</b> <b>and</b> flight engineers in 2015.|$|E

5|$|Although {{there is}} no Olympic competition, there are the World Gliding Championships. The first event {{was held at the}} Samedan in 1948. Since World War II it has been held every two years. There are now six classes open to both sexes, plus three classes for women and two junior classes. The latest {{worldwide}} statistics for 2011 indicate that Germany, the sport's birthplace, is still a center of the gliding world: it accounted for 27percent of the world's glider <b>pilots,</b> <b>and</b> the three major glider manufacturers are still based there. However the meteorological conditions that allow soaring are common and the sport has been taken up in many countries. At the last count there were over 111,000 active civilian glider <b>pilots</b> <b>and</b> 32,920 gliders, plus an unknown number of military cadets and aircraft. Clubs actively seek new members by giving trial flights, which are also a useful source of revenue for them.|$|E
5|$|As a {{long term}} company policy, in {{addition}} to the carrier's main activities, revenues are also generated by providing aircraft maintenance to foreign airlines, and specialist training for both Ethiopian and foreign trainees. Every year, <b>pilots</b> <b>and</b> technicians graduate from both the Pilot School, inaugurated in 1964, and the Aviation Maintenance Technician School, established in 1967. The American Federal Aviation Administration accredited the airline's maintenance division with license No. ETIY 102F.|$|E
5|$|By the {{outbreak}} of the Korean War, he had gained a reputation among the others in the squadron as an experienced pilot and a capable section leader. He was well-liked among other <b>pilots</b> <b>and</b> the black stewards and support staff of the carrier. Brown did not socialize much with the other pilots, however, and was known to spend as much time as possible visiting his wife. He was able to reveal his marriage following his commissioning.|$|E

The entire squadron of 12 B-24s were shot down. The USAAF 2nd Air Division lost 28 Liberators that day, the majority to a Sturmbock attack.|$|E
