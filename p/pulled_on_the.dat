5|$|This {{match was}} {{followed}} by the Tag Team Championship match. The match started slowly, but both teams soon began brawling in the ring. The Harts focused on Pierre, but Jacques was eventually able to tag in to rescue him. After Pierre regained the advantage, Owen tagged in and took control of the match. He applied the Sharpshooter to Jacques, but Pierre broke the hold. Bret tagged in but fell out of the ring and kayfabe hurt his knee when the Quebecers' manager <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ropes. The Quebecers focused on Bret's knee until Bret regained the advantage and attempted to apply the Sharpshooter. He was not able to stand, however, so the referee stopped the match and awarded the victory to the Quebecers. After the match, Owen yelled at Bret for not tagging out of the match. He then turned on Bret by kicking his injured leg and leaving him lying in the ring.|$|E
25|$|At independence, the {{northern}} region had two functioning political parties: the SNL, representing the Isaaq clan-family that constituted a numerical majority there; and the USP, supported {{largely by the}} Dir and the Daarood. In a unified Somalia, however, the Isaaq were a small minority, whereas {{the northern}} Daarood joined members of their clan-family from {{the south in the}} SYL. The Dir, having few kinsmen in the south, were <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> one hand by traditional ties to the Hawiye {{and on the other hand}} by common regional sympathies to the Isaaq. The southern opposition party, the Greater Somalia League (GSL), pro-Arab and militantly pan-Somalist, attracted the support of the SNL and the USP against the SYL, which had adopted a moderate stand before independence.|$|E

On 11 April 2017, {{it was reported}} that Gerrard would be taking charge of the Liverpool Under-18 side ahead of the 2017–18 season after impressing Jurgen Klopp and Alex Inglethorpe with his work ethic, knowledge and attitude towards academy coaching. However, before he took the next step on the path to receive his coaching credentials, Gerrard <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Liverpool shirt one last time in a friendly against Australian club Sydney FC {{at the end of this}} Premier League campaign. On 7 September 2017, the club announced Gerrard will manage the Under-19 team in the 2017–18 UEFA Youth League.|$|E

25|$|It took {{eight to}} twenty hours in soft soil or gravel to {{excavate}} the large firing pit required {{to hold the}} halves of the base box. Six to eight hours were required to actually assemble the gun itself. Each half of the base box was maneuvered into position on rails that ran along {{each side of the}} pit and then it was jacked up off the wagon and the wagon was then removed. Each base box half was jacked down onto wheels that ran on the guide rails and then they were bolted together. The complete base box was pulled over the pit, the wheels removed and it was jacked down into the pit. Three rails were placed on top of the base box to guide the carriage wagon into position and the carriage was jacked up while the wagon was removed and it was then jacked down and bolted to the base box. The barrel wagon was guided into place using the same rails and two block and tackles were attached to the barrel clamp. The crew <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ropes and slid the barrel into the cradle. The last steps were to connect the recoil brakes' pistons to the barrel, fill and test the recoil brake and recuperator, and install the roller race. Disassembly took around six hours.|$|E
500|$|He was {{questioned}} {{several times over}} the next few days, before being taken to another location, which Thomas described as [...] "some sort of mansion house", where he was kept in a small cell {{for the next two weeks}} and questioned on a number of occasions. Initially he maintained a fabricated story, that he was a student who had been travelling in Pakistan, but he later revealed the truth, that he had been in contact with Al Qaeda in Afghanistan. He said that he was motivated to change his story by several incidents, including one in which one of the Pakistani interrogators <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> collar of his hood, so as to strangle him, and incidents in which interrogators said that he would be electrocuted and executed. According to Thomas, he was then told that his cooperation was welcome and that he would be returned home.|$|E
500|$|The {{director}} of the original investigation stated that, [...] "the towers really did amazingly well. The terrorist aircraft didn't bring the buildings down; it was the fire which followed. It was proven that you could take out {{two thirds of the}} columns in a tower and the building would still stand." [...] The fires weakened the trusses supporting the floors, making the floors sag. The sagging floors <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> exterior steel columns causing the exterior columns to bow inward. With the damage to the core columns, the buckling exterior columns could no longer support the buildings, causing them to collapse. Additionally, the report found the towers' stairwells were not adequately reinforced to provide adequate emergency escape for people above the impact zones. NIST concluded that uncontrolled fires in 7WTC caused floor beams and girders to heat and subsequently [...] "caused a critical support column to fail, initiating a fire-induced progressive collapse that brought the building down".|$|E

500|$|The opening {{sequence}} of the episode was meant to replicate the same idea of season 2's premiere [...] "Man of Science, Man of Faith", where {{what seems to be}} a flashback is instead set on a new part of the island. Director Jack Bender questioned what Jack's goal was when he <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> chain, but Lindelof told him not to worry, because [...] "Fox will sell it, and he did". Lindelof described when Jack attacks his father at the AA meeting as [...] "pot-committed... it basically means you put so much money on the bluff, you can't fold your cards". The scene with Kate in a dress was inspired by Raiders of the Lost Ark, where Belloq gives a dress for Marion Ravenwood to wear, and was intended to make [...] "tom-boyish" [...] Kate feel vulnerable. The title, inspired by Charles Dickens' eponymous novel, refers to the reveal of another [...] "city" [...] on the island with the place where the Others live, in addition to the castaways' beach camp. The episode has only three characters of the second season's main cast, Jack, Kate and Sawyer. Lindelof later described this limited scope as [...] "a mistake, when the audience is away from the show for that long, they want to see everybody", causing the following season openers to have scenes with most of the main characters.|$|E

AC Milan legend Ettore Puricelli took over as trainer for a period, and River Plate star Santiago Vernazza <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> colours of the rosanero, making an impressive record of 51 goals in 115 games which make him still today the second-best topscorer in the club history.|$|E

2500|$|In {{all of the}} dated chariot graves, {{the heads}} and hooves {{of a pair of}} horses were placed in a grave that once {{contained}} a chariot. Evidence of chariots in these graves was inferred from the impressions of two spoked wheels set in grave floors 1.2–1.6m apart; in most cases the rest of the vehicle left no trace. In addition a pair of disk-shaped antler [...] "cheekpieces," [...] an ancient predecessor to a modern bit shank or bit ring, were placed in pairs beside each horse head-and-hoof sacrifice. The inner faces of the disks had protruding prongs or studs that would have pressed against the horse's lips when the reins were <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> opposite side. Studded cheekpieces were a new and fairly severe kind of control device that appeared simultaneously with chariots.|$|E
2500|$|Shyamalan or Paramount/Nickelodeon did not {{immediately}} confirm the [...] "go-ahead" [...] or whether the plug will be <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> trilogy. While filming The Last Airbender, Shyamalan mapped out a rough draft for a second film that is [...] "darker" [...] and includes Azula, portrayed by Summer Bishil, as the main antagonist. In a July 2010 interview with New York Magazine, Shyamalan commented [...] "In {{the next few months}} we'll be able to know whether we have that opportunity or not" [...] when asked about the sequel. No such announcement was made and in a September 2010 interview when asked if he knew when the sequel will be made, he replied, [...] "I don't, {{because there are so many}} factors they take into account", adding, [...] "I guess it will get into an area where it becomes a discussion—like pros and cons." [...] In September 2015, Shyamalan confirmed to Metro UK that he may work on the sequel after completing his next thriller, which started shooting in November 2015.|$|E

Flecha and Stannard tried to break the field with around [...] left in the race, but were eventually pulled back as were several other riders {{down the road from}} their group.

Flecha <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> front to set up one of their sprinters in the race, Boasson Hagen or Sutton, and when Flecha stepped aside, it was left to Boasson Hagen to build the pace and released Sutton to the line, who won by almost a bike length.

2500|$|In 1979, Jett was in England {{pursuing}} a solo career. She recorded three songs there with Sex Pistols' Paul Cook and Steve Jones, {{one of which}} was an early version of Arrows' [...] "I Love Rock 'n' Roll". This version appears on the 1993 compilation album Flashback. Later that year, she returned to Los Angeles, where she began fulfilling an obligation of the Runaways to complete a film which was loosely based on the band's career entitled We're All Crazee Now! Three actresses stood in for the departed band members, including Rainbeaux Smith, who was also a rock drummer. While working on the project, Jett met songwriter and producer Kenny Laguna, who was hired by Toby Mamis to help Jett with writing some tracks for the film. They became friends and decided to work together. Jett relocated to Long Beach, New York, where Laguna was based. The plug was <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> project halfway through shooting after Jett fell ill, but in 1984, after she became famous, producers looked for a way to use the footage from the incomplete film. Parts of the original footage of Jett were eventually used in another project, an underground film called DuBeat-Eo, which was produced by Alan Sacks but not commercially released.|$|E

The chosen fan is strapped into a chair as Jackson proceeds to pole dance and perform a striptease and lap dance, planting {{a kiss on the}} fan for the finale. [...] "Black Cat" [...] is followed by an emotionally charged rendition of the rock-influenced [...] "What About", one of the tour's most controversial and praised renditions. Jackson narrates as four dancers demonstrate two vignettes of domestic violence in abusive relationships, including rape and physical abuse, concluding in a gun <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> abusers in self-defense. Proceeding is [...] "Rhythm Nation", in which Jackson rapidly dances using martial arts movements and nunchucks, followed by the ballad [...] "Special." [...] The tour's encore includes chandeliers and a final outfit change, performing [...] "That's the Way Love Goes", [...] "Got 'til It's Gone", and [...] "Go Deep" [...] before concluding with [...] "Together Again."

2500|$|Brian Close was {{replaced}} by Colin Cowdrey for the MCC tour of the West Indies in 1967–68, his third spell as England captain and {{he was determined to}} make a success of it. Barrington and the MCC fared poorly in the run up matches and with West Indian supporters constantly telling him [...] "Charlie's waiting for you man. He'll kill you". Barrington was so upset that told his wife that he wouldn't tour again. In the First Test at the Queen's Park Oval in Trinidad Cowdrey won the toss and batted with Boycott and Edrich adding 80 for the first wicket and Barrington coming in against the spinners at 110/2. Soon after Gary Sobers responded to the crowd and brought on Griffith, but Barrington twice called him to halt as the chanting of the crowd interfered with his concentration. Although hit with bouncers on the shoulders and back he survived the five over spell and the tired bowler was taken off. He brought up his 50 with a six off Lance Gibbs and added 134 with Cowdrey and 188 with Tom Graveney before hitting Gibbs for another six to bring up his 20th century. When he saw the ball sailing into the stands the 37-year-old Barrington took off his cap and waved his fist in triumph. He was finally caught by Griffith off Gibbs for 143, the second time that he had made a century in four successive Tests. England made 568 and the West Indies followed on (Barrington dismissing Sobers), but survived the last day on 243/8 for a draw. Barrington made 63 in the Second Test at Sabina Park, Jamaica, again stopping Griffith's run up as the crowd went wild. John Snow took 7/49 and the West Indies followed on again, but when the local favourite Basil Butcher was out at 204/5 the crowd disagreed with the decision and rioted, even though Butcher had walked. Tear gas was used by the Jamaican police to restore order and play resumed, but the England team lost their hold on the game as Sobers made 113 not out and the West indies 391/9. Needing only 159 to win England collapsed to 68/8 (Barrington 13), but somehow managed a draw. The Third Test at Bridgetown, Barbados was another draw (Barrington 17) and the Fourth back at Trinidad looked like going the same way. The West Indies had made 526/7 and England replied with 404, where Cowdrey (148) and Barrington (48) added 133 for the third wicket. Sobers, remembering the England collapse in the Second Test declared at 92/2 leaving England 215 to win in 135 minutes, a run-rate they had yet to achieve in the series [...] Cowdrey was uncertain, but Barrington convinced him to go for the win, shouting [...] "Will we go for it? Of course we'll go for it. That's what we've come all this way for, isn't it?" [...] Barrington did not bat, but England made 215/3 and won by seven wickets. Sobers was lambasted by the Caribbean press for his cavalier declaration, but responded in the Fifth Test in Georgetown, Guyana with 152 and 95 not out, Barrington taking his wicket again in the first innings, and England were struggling at 206/9 when stumps were <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> last day, but they drew the match and won the series. Barrington had made only 4 and 0, but finished with 288 runs (41.14) and 5 wickets (51.40), having dismissed Sobers and Seymour Nurse twice each and the opener Steve Camacho.|$|E
