5|$|South London was {{the setting}} for Rob Curry and Anthony Fletcher's 2012 mockumentary version of The Tempest, which used the themes arising from Shakespeare's {{connection}} {{with the discovery of}} the New World to explore contemporary multicultural Britain – <b>particularly</b> <b>with</b> <b>regard</b> <b>to</b> the London riots of 2011.|$|E
5|$|Churchmen such as Erasmus and Luther {{proposed}} {{reform to}} the Church, {{often based on}} humanist textual criticism of the New Testament. In October 1517 Luther published the 95 Theses, challenging papal authority and criticizing its perceived corruption, <b>particularly</b> <b>with</b> <b>regard</b> <b>to</b> instances of sold indulgences. The 95 Theses led to the Reformation, a break with the Roman Catholic Church that previously claimed hegemony in Western Europe. Humanism and the Renaissance therefore played a direct role in sparking the Reformation, {{as well as in}} many other contemporaneous religious debates and conflicts.|$|E
5|$|Fatalities and {{injuries}} at this race {{proved to be}} a major turning point in both the 1994 season, and in the development of Formula One itself, <b>particularly</b> <b>with</b> <b>regard</b> <b>to</b> safety. The race weekend was marked by the deaths of Austrian driver Roland Ratzenberger and of three-time world champion Ayrton Senna in separate accidents. Other incidents saw driver Rubens Barrichello injured and several mechanics and spectators injured. In terms of driver fatalities, this was Formula One's darkest weekend since two drivers were killed at the 1960 Belgian Grand Prix.|$|E

5|$|In 2009 the European {{ombudsman}} published {{statistics of}} citizens' complaints against EU institutions, {{with most of}} them filed against the Commission (66%) and concerning lack of transparency (36%). In 2010 the Commission was sued for blocking access to documents on EU biofuel policy. This happened after media accused the Commission of blocking scientific evidence against biofuel subsidies. Lack of transparency, unclear lobbyist relations, conflicts of interests and excessive spending of the Commission was highlighted {{in a number of}} reports by internal and independent auditing organisations. It has also been criticised on IT-related issues, <b>particularly</b> <b>with</b> <b>regard</b> <b>to</b> Microsoft.|$|E
5|$|The {{background}} of the Winter War covers the period before {{the outbreak of the}} Winter War between Finland and the Soviet Union in 1939–1940, stretching from Finland's Declaration of Independence in 1917 to the Soviet-Finnish negotiations in 1938–1939. Before its independence, Finland was an autonomous grand duchy inside Imperial Russia. During the ensuing Finnish Civil War, the Red Guards, supported by the Russian Bolsheviks, were defeated. Fearful of Soviet designs, during the 1920s and 1930s, the Finns were constantly attempting to align themselves with Scandinavian neutrality, <b>particularly</b> <b>with</b> <b>regard</b> <b>to</b> Sweden. Furthermore, the Finns engaged in secret military co-operation with Estonia in the 1930s.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert's {{successor}} in 1842 was Richard Harrington, who {{inherited a}} college in good shape: income was around £15,000; only Christ Church was significantly bigger in size. Academic reforms, <b>particularly</b> <b>with</b> <b>regard</b> <b>to</b> examinations– which {{were to be}} administered by the university, rather than the college– were instituted across Oxford {{in the first half}} of the century. Brasenose's proportion of first-class degrees fell sharply from its previous peak. By 1850, no matriculation exam was instituted at Brasenose, as at other colleges, although the other examinations were altered: responsions moved forward and moderations instituted. Brasenose, like the University, was yet to truly reform the range of subjects studied, however. It was only in 1849 that modern sciences were only given a separate School (and thus examination) in 1849; law and modern history a year later.|$|E

5|$|Karluk left Esquimalt on 17 June 1913, sailing north towards Alaska. The {{immediate}} destination was Nome, {{on the coast}} of the Bering Sea. There was trouble from the beginning with the steering gear and with the engines, both of which needed frequent attention. On 2 July Karluk reached the Bering Sea in mist, fog and rapidly falling temperatures; six days later she arrived at Nome where she joined Alaska and Mary Sachs. While the ships were being loaded in Nome, some of the scientists pressed for a meeting with the leader to clarify plans, <b>particularly</b> <b>with</b> <b>regard</b> <b>to</b> the Northern Party whose schedule was vague. The meeting was unsatisfactory. Stefansson's attitude offended several of the men, some of whom threatened to leave the expedition. They had read press reports in which Stefansson had apparently said that he expected Karluk to be crushed, and that the lives of the staff were secondary to the scientific work. Stefansson would not explain these matters, nor give further details of his plans for the Northern Party. Despite the scientists' alarm and dissatisfaction, none resigned.|$|E

25|$|The Laws of Burgos, 1512–1513, {{were the}} first codified set of laws {{governing}} the behavior of Spanish settlers in America, <b>particularly</b> <b>with</b> <b>regard</b> <b>to</b> native Indians.
