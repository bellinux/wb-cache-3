The phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase/Akt pathway is involved in the initiation of these events. Using flow cytometry-based single cell analysis of protein phosphorylation, we demonstrate that SAHA activates this pathway in several subpopulations of T cells, including memory T cells that are the major viral reservoir in peripheral blood. Importantly, SAHA activates HIV replication in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from individuals treated effectively with HAART. Thus SAHA, which is a Food and Drug Administration-approved drug, might be considered to accelerate the decay of the latent reservoir in HAART-treated infected humans...|$|R

40|$|HIV- 1 latency {{remains a}} {{formidable}} barrier towards virus eradication as therapeutic attempts to <b>purge</b> these <b>reservoirs</b> {{are so far}} unsuccessful. The pool of transcriptionally silent proviruses is established early in infection and persists for a lifetime, even when viral loads are suppressed below detection levels using anti-retroviral therapy. Upon therapy interruption the reservoir can re-establish systemic infection. Different cellular reservoirs that harbor latent provirus have been described. In this study we demonstrate that HIV- 1 can also establish a silent integration in actively proliferating primary T lymphocytes. Co-culturing of these proliferating T lymphocytes with dendritic cells (DCs) activated the provirus from latency. Activation did not involve DC-mediated C-type lectin DC-SIGN signaling or TCR-stimulation but was mediated by DC-secreted component(s) and cell-cell interaction between DC and T lymphocyte that could be inhibited by blocking ICAM- 1 dependent adhesion. These results imply that circulating DCs could purge HIV- 1 from latency and re-initiate virus replication. Moreover, our data show that viral latency can be established early after infection and supports the idea that actively proliferating T lymphocytes with an effector phenotype contribute to the latent viral reservoir.

After the discontinuation of therapy, activation of latent virus can rekindle infection. To <b>purge</b> this <b>reservoir,</b> {{it is necessary to}} define cellular signaling pathways that lead to activation of latent HIV. We used the SCID-hu (Thy/Liv) mouse model of HIV latency to analyze a broad array of T cell-signaling pathways and show in primary, quiescent cells that viral induction {{depends on the}} activation of two primary intracellular signaling pathways, protein kinase C or nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT). In contrast, inhibition or activation of other important T cell stimulatory pathways (such as mitogen-activated protein kinase, calcium flux, or histone deacetylation) do not significantly induce virus expression. We found that the activation of NF-κB is critical to viral reactivation; however, all pathways that stimulate NF-κBdonot reactivate latent virus. Our studies further show that inhibition of NF-κB does not prevent activation of HIV by NF-AT, indicating that these pathways can function independently to activate the HIV LTR. Thus, we define several molecular pathways that trigger HIV reactivation from latency and provide evidence that latent HIV infection is maintained by the functional lack of particular transcription factors in quiescent cells...|$|R

CDM would reactivate HIV from latency by modulating the release of IL- 6 and TNF-α, since the amount of both cytokines measured through ELISA significantly increased in U 1 treated cells. Besides, NDGA increased ROS production, which might be related to the increase on p 24 level observed in NDGA treated U 1.

CD 4 + T lymphocytes from primary blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and in blocks of human lymphoid tissue were stimulated with prostratin and infected with HIV- 1 to investigate the effects of prostratin on cellular susceptibility to the virus. The capacity of prostratin to reactivate HIV from latency was tested in CD 4 + T cells harboring preintegrated and integrated latent provirus. Prostratin stimulated CD 4 + T cells in an aberrant way. It induced expression of the activation markers CD 25 and CD 69 but inhibited cell cycling. HIV- 1 uptake was reduced in prostratin-stimulated CD 4 + T PBMC and tissues in a manner consistent with a downregulation of CD 4 and CXCR 4 receptors in these systems. At the postentry level, prostratin inhibited completion of reverse transcription of the viral genome in lymphoid tissue. However, prostratin facilitated integration of the reverse-transcribed HIV- 1 genome in nondividing CD 4 + T cells and facilitated expression of already integrated HIV- 1, including latent forms. Thus, while stimulation with prostratin restricts susceptibility of primary resting CD 4 + T cells to HIV infection at the virus cell-entry level and at the reverse transcription level, it efficiently reactivates HIV- 1 from pre- and postintegration latency in resting CD 4 + T cells...|$|R

40|$|The {{persistence}} of latently infected cells in patients under combinatory antiretroviral therapy (cART) {{is a major}} hurdle to HIV- 1 eradication. Strategies to <b>purge</b> these <b>reservoirs</b> are needed and activation of viral gene expression in latently infected cells is one promising strategy. Bromodomain and Extraterminal (BET) bromodomain inhibitors (BETi) are compounds able to reactivate latent proviruses in a positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) -dependent manner. In this study, we tested the reactivation potential of protein kinase C (PKC) agonists (prostratin, bryostatin- 1 and ingenol-B), which are known to activate NF-κB signaling pathway as well as P-TEFb, used alone or in combination with P-TEFb-releasing agents (HMBA and BETi (JQ 1, I-BET, I-BET 151)). Using in vitro HIV- 1 post-integration latency model cell lines of T-lymphoid and myeloid lineages, we demonstrated that PKC agonists and P-TEFb-releasing agents alone acted as potent latency-reversing agents (LRAs) and that their combinations led to synergistic activation of HIV- 1 expression at the viral mRNA and protein levels. Mechanistically, combined treatments led to higher activations of P-TEFb and NF-κB than the corresponding individual drug treatments. Importantly, we observed in ex vivo cultures of CD 8 +-depleted PBMCs from 35 cART-treated HIV- 1 + aviremic patients {{that the percentage of}} reactivated cultures following combinatory bryostatin- 1 +JQ 1 treatment was identical to the percentage observed with anti-CD 3 +anti-CD 28 antibodies positive control stimulation. Remarkably, in ex vivo cultures of resting CD 4 + T cells isolated from 15 HIV- 1 + cART-treated aviremic patients, the combinations bryostatin- 1 +JQ 1 and ingenol-B+JQ 1 released infectious viruses to levels similar to that obtained with the positive control stimulation. The potent effects of these two combination treatments were already detected 24 hours post-stimulation. These results constitute the first demonstration of LRA combinations exhibiting such a potent effect and represent a proof-of-concept for the co-administration of two different types of LRAs as a potential strategy {{to reduce the size of}} the latent HIV- 1 reservoirs.

Cell quiescence, by favouring HIV latency, {{reduces the risk of}} recognition and cell destruction by cytotoxic lymphocytes. Several cell-activation-based approaches have been proposed to disrupt cell quiescence and then virus latency, but these approaches have not eradicated the virus. CD 4 + CD 25 + regulatory T cells (Tregs) are a CD 4 + T-cell subset with particular activation properties.

Historically, FDCs have been characterized as ‘accessory’ cells that passively support germinal center (GC) responses. However, our recent observations suggest that FDCs actively shape humoral immunity. In this dissertation, we discuss recent findings concerning the antigen acquisition and retention functions of FDCs, and relevant implications for protective immunity. We found that FDCs acquired complement-coated immune complexes (ICs) from noncognate B cells via complement receptors 1 and 2 (CD 35 and CD 21, respectively) and rapidly internalized them by an actin-dependent pathway. ICs were retained intact within a nondegradative cycling compartment and were displayed periodically on the cell surface where they were accessible to antigen-specific B cells. Furthermore, we discuss how FDCs are involved in persistence of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) in people on antiretroviral therapy (ART). Treatment with ART substantially reduces viral load and limits disease progression in subjects with HIV infection. Despite the success of ART, it does not cure HIV and discontinuation of treatment results in viral rebound. Growing evidence implicates lymph nodes (LN) as a major site for continued infection of CD 4 T cells, but the cell sources of a persistent reservoir within LN remain unclear. We found that human FDC isolated from subjects on ART retain infectious HIV via binding to complement receptor 2 (CD 21) within a cycling compartment and transmit infectious virus to CD 4 T cells in vitro. Importantly, treatment of the HIV+ FDC with a soluble complement receptor 2 (sCD 21 -Ig) purges the FDC of HIV virions and prevents transmission of infectious virus in vitro. These results provide evidence that reservoirs are not restricted to infected cells and provide a method to <b>purge</b> one <b>reservoir</b> not targeted by conventional therapy. Our results suggest that sCD 21 -Ig could be a potential component of new therapeutic strategies to achieve functional cure or viral eradication in ART-treated HIV-infected humans. Finally, we show S. pneumonia binds only in the medulla of the LN and that a subset of dendritic cells (DC), besides B cells) are required for the transport of S. pneumoniae to FDC, independent of macrophages. A robust humoral immune response and germinal center formation requires transport of antigen to the FDC. A better understanding of this process can contribute to improvement of future vaccine design...|$|R

This review summarizes our current knowledge and understanding of the elements involved in HIV- 1 transcriptional reactivation: (1) the site of integration; (2) the transcription factor NF-kappaB, which is induced by proinflammatory cytokines (such as TNFalpha) and binds to two kappaB sites in the HIV- 1 promoter region; (3) the specific remodeling of a single nucleosome (called nuc- 1 and located immediately downstream of the HIV- 1 transcription start site under latency conditions) upon activation of the HIV- 1 promoter; (4) post-translational acetylation of histones and of non-histone proteins (following treatment with deacetylases inhibitors, which induce viral transcription and nuc- 1 remodeling); and (5) the viral trans-activator Tat, which promotes transcription by mediating the recruitment to the HIV- 1 promoter of histone-modifying enzymes and ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes required for nucleosome disruption and transcriptional processivity. Finally, this review highlights experimental therapies aimed at administrating HIV- 1 gene expression activators (such as HDAC inhibitors) combined with an effective HAART in order to reactivate and decrease/eliminate the pool of latently HIV- 1 -infected cellular reservoirsJournal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.

40|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type- 1 (HIV- 1) invades {{the central nervous}} system (CNS) during acute infection which can result in HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders in up to 50 % of patients, even in the presence of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). Within the CNS, productive HIV- 1 infection occurs in the perivascular macrophages and microglia. Astrocytes also become infected, although their infection is restricted and does not give rise to new viral particles. The major barrier to the elimination of HIV- 1 is the establishment of viral reservoirs in different anatomical sites throughout the body and viral persistence during long-term treatment with cART. While the predominant viral reservoir is believed to be resting CD 4 (+) T cells in the blood, other anatomical compartments including the CNS, gut-associated lymphoid tissue, bone marrow, and genital tract can also harbour persistently infected cellular reservoirs of HIV- 1. Viral latency is predominantly responsible for HIV- 1 persistence and is most likely governed at the transcriptional level. Current clinical trials are testing transcriptional activators, in the background of cART, in an attempt to <b>purge</b> these viral <b>reservoirs</b> and reverse viral latency. These strategies aim to activate viral transcription in cells constituting the viral reservoir, so they can be recognised and cleared by the immune system, while new rounds of infection are blocked by co-administration of cART. The CNS has several unique characteristics that may result in differences in viral transcription and in the way latency is established. These include CNS-specific cell types, different transcription factors, altered immune surveillance, and reduced antiretroviral drug bioavailability. A comprehensive understanding of viral transcription and latency in the CNS is required in order to determine treatment outcomes when using transcriptional activators within the CNS. Melissa J.

40|$|The {{receptor}} tyrosine kinase, RON, {{is expressed}} on tissue-resident macrophages. RON functions by activating genes that promote wound repair and resolve inflammation, while repressing genes that perpetuate tissue damage and cell death. Chronic HIV infection {{is associated with}} dysregulated inflammation, and we hypothesize that diminished macrophage RON expression contributes {{to the development of}} end organ diseases including HIV-associated central nervous system (CNS) inflammation. We utilized CNS tissue from a SIV macaque model to examine the temporal regulation of RON in the brain during infection. Following prolonged SIV infection, RON expression was inversely correlated with the development of CNS disease: RON was highly expressed in animals that did not develop CNS lesions and lower in SIV infected macaques that demonstrated moderate to severe inflammatory lesions. Arginase- 1 expression was low during late infection whereas expression of the inflammatory genes, IL- 12 p 40 and TNF &alpha, was elevated compared to uninfected animals. To validate a role for RON in regulating HIV, we infected human tonsillar tissue-resident macrophages. RON inhibited HIV replication in tissue-resident macrophages. Furthermore, HIV infection diminished RON in tonsil macrophages. We propose a model in which RON expression is decreased, genes that quell inflammation are repressed, and inflammatory mediators are induced to promote tissue inflammation following chronic HIV infection in the brain. 	 The cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p 21 is a factor that, like RON, negatively regulates HIV transcription. Elevated expression of p 21 in HIV+ elite controllers, or by ectopic expression in primary CD 4 + T cells, resulted in reduced HIV expression. Furthermore, these elite controllers had increased binding of factors that negatively regulate transcription elongation at the HIV long terminal repeat. RON and p 21 are examples of cellular factors that limit HIV transcription and contribute to HIV latency. Latently infected cells are not targeted by anti-retroviral therapy and permit rapid rebound of viremia following treatment interruption. Understanding intrinsic mechanisms that establish latency may provide targets for <b>purging</b> these HIV <b>reservoirs</b> or maintaining their transcriptionally silent state...|$|R

Fecha de lectura: 15 - 07 - 2014 The present work {{is composed}} of two main goals: “Identification and functional analysis of the HIV- 1 Nef PGPG motif, responsible for the interaction with the SH 2 domain of Lck, as a new potential therapeutic target” and “Study of the in vitro and ex vivo effects of bryostatin- 1 {{in combination with the}} antiretrovirals maraviroc or Atripla® on viral reactivation and the inhibition of novel infection issues”. SECTION 1 : HIV- 1 Nef affects pivotal processes in the infected host cell including T cell receptor signalling. Most of these effects involve the physical association with and alteration of subcellular localization of the host cell kinase Lck. Retargeting of Lck depends on a PxxP motif in Nef that binds to SH 3 domains. Moreover, the SH 2 domain of Lck was reported to contribute to interactions with Nef, however the identity of the HIV- 1 Nef motif responsible for this interaction has remained unknown. To search for the elusive SH 2 binding site we performed a functional alanine scanning analysis along a discrete but highly conserved region at the core of HIV- 1 Nef. We identified a PGPG motif encompassing residues 121 - 137 of HIV- 1 NL 4. 3 Nef to be required for the interaction with Lck-SH 2. The PGPG motif was critical for Lck dependent Nef functions, including CD 4 downregulation, optimal infectivity of viruses produced in T cells as well as intracellular recruitment of Lck. Unexpectedly, we found that the PGPG motif also participated in the binding to the Lck-SH 3 domain, indicative of the synergy between PxxP-SH 3 and PGPG-SH 2 interaction. In accordance, the PGPG motif also participated on Nef dependent inhibition of host cell actin dynamics and MHC-I downregulation, which are PxxP dependent activities of Nef that do not involve Lck. In conclusion, the PGPG motif can mediate interactions of Nef with SH 2 domains and supports the activity of the Nef PxxP motif. Thus, we propose the conserved PGPG motif in HIV- 1 Nef as a potential pharmacological target for interference with Nef function in HIV- 1 infection. SECTION 2 : Despite antiretroviral therapy successfully controls HIV- 1 viremia in most AIDS patients, virus latency establishment early upon infection impedes HIV- 1 eradication in HIV- 1 + patients. Bryostatin- 1 (BRYO) inhibits in vitro HIV- 1 infection of CD 4 T lymphocytes (as it downregulates CD 4 and CXCR 4, viral receptor and coreceptor, respectively) and, at the same time, reactivates virus from latency through PKC/NF-kB pathway activation. Prior to design clinical studies with BRYO to assess its real impact {{on the size of the}} HIV- 1 latent reservoirs, the potential in vitro effect of BRYO in combination with the antiretrovirals (AR) maraviroc (MVC) and Atripla® (ATP) has been determined. Jurkat-LTRGFP-R 5 cell line and two latent and reactivatable HIV- 1 -infected lymphocytic or monocytic clonal cell lines (J 89 GFP and THP 89 GFP respectively) were used as latency models. BRYO reactivated latent HIV- 1, reaching levels up to 80 % in THP 89 GFP cells, even in combination with MVC or ATP. Moreover, when AR pre-treated reporter TZM-bl cells were co-cultured with BRYO treated THP 89 GFP, new infections of reactivated HIV- 189. 6 were inhibited 50 % or 80 % for MVC or ATP pre-treated cells, respectively. Remarkably, when AR were combined with BRYO, the combinations maintained the antiviral effect of the drugs with the maximum rate of inhibition by its own. In addition, BRYO-mediated downregulation of surface CD 4 and CXCR 4 in PBMC was not affected when it was used along with other AR and no hiperactivation or high proliferation effects were observed in these cells. Significantly, we found that BRYO strongly stimulated the viral promoter (LTR) transcription by activating the transcription factor NF-κB in human primary astrocytes and in the astrocytoma cell line U 87, suggesting that the reactivation effect of BRYO could be especially important in a cellular reservoir such as astrocytes. Moreover, BRYO was also tested ex vivo for HIV- 1 induction in CD 4 T cells isolated from infected individuals receiving HAART and was found to exhibit potent induction activity. This work is the first to demonstrate that AR combination with BRYO do not interfere with BRYO activity (in terms of reactivation of latently infected cells and partial inhibition of infection) neither with AR antiviral activity. Thus, we propose BRYO as a viral latency reactivator compound appropriate to be combined with actual antiretroviral treatments in order to <b>purge</b> the viral <b>reservoirs...</b>|$|R
