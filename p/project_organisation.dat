40|$|<b>Project</b> <b>organisations</b> are {{transient}} organisations formed though {{loosely coupled}} firms (Dubois and Gadde 2002; Turner 2006). They tend to be, {{as suggested by}} Henisz, Levitt and Scott (2012 : 37), ‘one-off projects for which transactions have no strong “shadow of the future”, but where elements of relational contracting are still ubiquitous’. Past scholarship has explored {{the implications of the}} transitory nature of <b>project</b> <b>organisations</b> through supply chain and network analysis, approaching it as a process and as a constellation of formal and informal relations.

Through an analysis of Bourdieu’s key concepts—habitus, capital and field—it explores how the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) sector and the <b>project</b> <b>organisations</b> of which it largely consists may be investigated not only through its processes and interactions, but also through objective relations that exist beyond these processes and networks...|$|R

40|$|Client-side {{project manager}} face {{challenges}} in motivating <b>project</b> <b>organisations</b> to pursue exceptional {{design and construction}} performance. One approach to improving the motivation of <b>project</b> <b>organisations</b> is by offering a financial incentive reward for the achievement of voluntary performance standards above the minimum required standard. However, little investigation has been undertaken into the features of a successful incentive system {{as a part of}} an overall procurement strategy. In response to a lack of information available to client-side project managers tasked with the initial design of an incentive system, the paper explores motivation undera successful incentive and identifies key learnings for client-side project managers to consider when designing incentives. Our findings are {{based on the results of}} a large Australian case study which is interpreted against a conceptual framework based on both economic and psychological perspectives of motivation. The results suggest the motivation towards incentive goals is influenced by the value the <b>project</b> <b>organisations</b> place on the incentive reward as a commercial opportunity to increase their profit margins. However, perhaps more important are the relationship management processes that promote commitment to the project; and pride in the achievement of project goals. In the case study, these processes intensified the direct motivational effect of the incentive reward on offer. The findings also highlight the importance of ensuring that incentive goals and performance measurement processes remain relevant to the <b>organisation</b> throughout a <b>project</b> to continuously encourage motivation under changing project conditions...|$|R

40|$|Joint ventures {{can take}} many forms and can be formed for {{different}} reasons, from sharing resources to creating future business opportunities. At the same time, there is increasing interest and discussion of alternative procurement methods, moving away from traditional procurement systems to relational approaches. Business systems and strategies need to be redefined and move from a short-term project to project culture to a more strategic, long-term perspective. Joint ventures of construction organisations, global and local, have become increasingly popular to deliver large-scale infrastructure construction projects. However, successful strategic collaborations require <b>project</b> <b>organisations</b> to formulate a fit between contractual and operational arrangements for each situation. This study reviews the movement from traditional procurement methods towards relational contracting approaches in Queensland, Australia.

40|$|Summary Today's {{economic}} systems are characterised by flexible specialisation {{driven by a}} growth of service-based firms, a servicification of manufacturing firms and projectification. There is therefore {{a growing number of}} matrix organisations being co-dependent on line <b>organisations</b> and <b>projects.</b> The study aims to advance theorising on such organisations by empirically studying the assumption that tensions act as drivers for managerial action in <b>project</b> <b>organisations</b> and that they constitute a foundation upon which theories may be built. The study shows that tensions are concerns in <b>project</b> <b>organisations</b> and that sources of tensions are primarily created by the co-existence of fundamentally different organising principles, the way employees identify themselves with either the line function or with projects and by competition for limited organisational resources. The study differentiates project-oriented organisations and project-based organisations from one another.

This {{was the beginning of}} a long lasting collaboration between the turbine developer and manufacturer Multibrid, the foundation designer OWT and the fabricator WeserWind. Meanwhile, the design covers the demands of an offshore turbine foundation to sufficient extent, the fabrication was even challenging regarding size and shape of the structure. That time WeserWind was supported in terms of fabrication and assembly by its sister company IAG Industrieanlagenbau Georgsmarienhütte GmbH, a member of the Georgsmarienhütte group as well. The first operation of the turbine was accompanied by the research project IMO-Wind. The first steps in condition monitoring have been undertaken including the determination of stress curves, the so-called [...] "Hot spot" [...] Survey, in order to enable the comparison with calculation models.In 2008 Tripods were built as a substructure for six Multibrid M5000 offshore wind turbines in the Alpha Ventus project. Alpha Ventus was planned as a first test field for the exploration of offshore wind energy in German waters. The <b>project</b> <b>organisation</b> has been Deutsche Offshore-Testfeld und Infrastruktur GmbH & Co. KG, DOTI. It was founded in 2006 by EWE AG (47,5%), E.ON Climate & Renewables Central Europe GmbH and Vattenfall Europe Windkraft GmbH (each 26,25%) assisted by Stiftung Offshore Windenergie. The German Federal Ministry of Environment BMU supported a number of research projects, which were summarized in the RAVE initiative (Research at Alpha Ventus). A broad basis of experience and knowledge was gained for the construction, commissioning and operation for future offshore wind farms. The Tripods were fabricated by Aker Kvaerner in Verdal, Norway. A horizontal assembly of the Tripods was realized in accordance to the local fabrication experience of the yard, coming from large oil and gas jacket fabrication, with subsequent upending and of course upright sailing from Norway to the offshore terminal in Eemshaven. The transportation of the Tripods to the location was done by Taklift 4 from Boskalis one by one.|$|E

This paper {{is based on an}} on-going study of environmental information in project organisations. Study object is a construction project, the Tunnel Project. Methods used were in-depth interviews, on-site observations and a survey of more than 500 documents. The aim is to explore how environmental information is communicated and by whom in a <b>project</b> <b>organisation.</b> Findings show that meetings were considered as the most important and receptive channels to communicate environmental information within the <b>project</b> <b>organisation.</b> Environmental information is seldom actively searched for, and even more seldom searched for outside the sphere of the company. Most often the environmental coordinator on site is asked or they call a colleague. The environmental coordinator had also an important role as communicator of environmental information in the <b>project</b> <b>organisation.</b> As selector and interpreter of incoming environmental information he worked as a filter for environmental information. The study reveals that informational exchange between the <b>project</b> <b>organisation</b> {{and other parts of the}} company did not frequently occur, which made the <b>project</b> <b>organisation</b> members feeling isolated. Finally, in spite of good availability of a computer-based EMS and a common web-based project-platform, these recourses were not used to their full potential...|$|E

Carbon reduction strategies were proposed in previous studies. Nevertheless, contractors were often criticised for standing aloof to adopt them.

Monte Carlo simulations were conducted to examine how the priorities of strategies adoption may be affected by the CPOs. The results indicate that developers and the design consultants are influential to contractors&# 039; decision in adopting those carbon reduction strategies that may incur additional project cost. The results indicate that decisions towards the adoption of strategies may not be swayed towards their effectiveness of achieving carbon reduction.
