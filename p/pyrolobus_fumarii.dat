50|$|This article {{discusses}} the Unique properties of hyperthermophilic archaea. Hyperthermophiles are organisms that can live at temperatures ranging between 70 and 125 °C. They {{have been the}} subject of intense study since their discovery in 1977 in the Galapagos Rift. It was thought impossible for life to exist at temperatures as great as 100 °C until <b>Pyrolobus</b> <b>fumarii</b> was discovered in 1997. P. fumarii is an unicellular organism from the domain Archaea living in the hydrothermal vents in black smokers along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. These organisms can live at 106 °C at a pH of 5.5. In order to get energy from their environment these organisms are facultatively aerobic obligate chemolithoautotrophs, meaning these organisms build biomolecules by harvesting carbon dioxide (CO2) from their environment by using hydrogen (H2) as the primary electron donor and nitrate (NO3−) as the primary electron acceptor. These organisms can even survive the autoclave, which is a machine designed to kill organisms through high temperature and pressure. Because hyperthermophiles live in such hot environments, they need to have DNA, membrane and enzyme modifications in order to withstand the intense thermal energy. Such modifications are currently being studied to better understand what allows an organism or protein to survive such harsh conditions. By learning what allows these organisms to survive such harsh conditions, researchers will be better able to synthesize molecules that are harder to denature that can be used in industry.|$|E
40|$|AbstractWater-containing terrestrial, {{subterranean}} and submarine {{high temperature}} areas harbor {{a variety of}} hyperthermophilic bacteria and archaea which are able to grow optimally above 80 °C. Hyperthermophiles are adapted to hot environments by their physiological and nutritional requirements. As a consequence, cell components like proteins, nucleic acids and membranes have to be stable and even function best at temperatures around 100 °C. The chemolithoautotrophic archaeon <b>Pyrolobus</b> <b>fumarii</b> is able to grow at 113 °C and, therefore, represents the upper temperature border of life. For the first time, (vegetative) cultures of Pyrolobus and Pyrodictium are able to survive autoclaving...|$|E
40|$|In the RNA of hyperthermophiles, which grow optimally between 80 °C and 106 °C, posttranscriptional {{modification}} {{has been}} identified as a leading mechanism of structural stabilization. Particularly in the Archaeal evolutionary domain these modifications are expressed as a structurally diverse array of modification motifs, many of which include ribose methylation. Using mass spectrometric techniques we have examined the posttranscriptional modifications in unfractionated tRNA from the remarkable organism <b>Pyrolobus</b> <b>fumarii,</b> which grows optimally at 106 °C, but up to 113 °C (Blochl et al. (1997), Extremophiles, 1, 14 - 21). Twenty-six modified nucleosides were detected, 11 of which are methylated in ribose.

40|$|<b>Pyrolobus</b> <b>fumarii</b> Blöchl et al. 1997 is {{the type}} species of the genus Pyrolobus, which belongs to the crenarchaeal family Pyrodictiaceae. The species is a facultatively microaerophilic non-motile crenarchaeon. It is of {{interest}} because of its isolated phylogenetic location in {{the tree of life}} and because it is a hyperthermophilic chemolithoautotroph known as the primary producer of organic matter at deep-sea hydrothermal vents. P. fumarii exhibits currently the highest optimal growth temperature of all life forms on earth (106 °C). This is the first completed genome sequence of a member of the genus Pyrolobus to be published and only the second genome sequence from {{a member of the family}} Pyrodictiaceae. Although Diversa Corporation announced the completion of sequencing of the P. fumarii genome on September 25, 2001, this sequence was never released to the public. The 1, 843, 267 bp long genome with its 1, 986 protein-coding and 52 RNA genes is a part of the Genomic Encyclopedia of Bacteria and Archaea project...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background We {{previously}} {{found the}} first examples of splicing of archaeal pre-mRNAs for homologs of the eukaryotic CBF 5 protein (also known as dyskerin in humans) in Aeropyrum pernix, Sulfolobus solfataricus, S. tokodaii, and S. acidocaldarirus, and also showed that crenarchaeal species in orders Desulfurococcales and Sulfolobales, except for Hyperthermus butylicus, Pyrodictium occultum, <b>Pyrolobus</b> <b>fumarii,</b> and Ignicoccus islandicus, contain the (putative) cbf 5 intron. However, the exact timing of the intron insertion was not determined and verification of the putative secondary loss of the intron in some lineages was not performed. Results In the present study, we determined approximately two-thirds of the entire coding region of crenarchaeal Cbf 5 sequences from 43 species. A phylogenetic analysis of our data and information from the available genome sequences suggested that the (putative) cbf 5 intron existed in the common ancestor of the orders Desulfurococcales and Sulfolobales and that probably at least two independent lineages in the order Desulfurococcales lost the (putative) intron. Conclusion This finding is the first observation of a lineage-specific loss of a pre-mRNA intron in Archaea. As the insertion or deletion of introns in protein-coding genes in Archaea {{has not yet been}} seriously considered, our finding suggests the possible difficulty of accurately and completely predicting protein-coding genes in Archaea. </p...|$|E
40|$|A novel, irregular, coccoid-shaped archaeum was {{isolated}} from a hydrothermally heated black smoker {{wall at the}} TAG site at the Mid Atlantic Ridge (depth 3650 meters). It grew at between 90 degrees C and 113 degrees C (optimum 106 degrees C) and pH 4. 0 - 6. 5 (optimum 5. 5) and 1 %- 4 % salt (optimum 1. 7 %). The organism was a facultatively aerobic obligate chemolithoautotroph gaining energy by H 2 -oxidation. Nitrate, S 2 O 3 (2 -), and low concentrations of O 2 (up to 0. 3 % v/v) served as electron acceptors, yielding NH 4 +, H 2 S, and H 2 O as end products, respectively. Growth was inhibited by acetate, pyruvate, glucose, starch, or sulfur. The new isolate was able to form colonies on plates (at 102 degrees C) and to grow at a pressure of 25000 kPa (250 bar). Exponentially growing cultures survived a one-hour autoclaving at 121 degrees C. The GC content was 53 mol%. The core lipids consisted of glycerol-dialkyl glycerol tetraethers and traces of 2, 3 -di-O-phytanyl-sn-glycerol. The cell wall was composed of a surface layer of tetrameric protein complexes arranged on a p 4 -lattice (center-to-center distance 18. 5 nm). By its 16 S rRNA sequence, the new isolate belonged to the Pyrodictiaceae. Based on its GC-content, DNA homology, S-layer composition, and metabolism, we describe here a new genus, which we name Pyrolobus (the "fire lobe"). The type species is <b>Pyrolobus</b> <b>fumarii</b> (type strain 1 A; DSM 11204) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{microflora}} of the cryosphere {{of planet}} Earth {{provides the best}} analogs for life forms that might {{be found in the}} permafrost or polar ice caps of Mars, near the surface of the cometary nuclei, or in the liquid water beneath and the ice crusts of icy moons of Jupiter and Saturn. The importance of study alkaliphilic microorganisms for astrobiology was enhanced by the findings of abundant carbonates and carbonate globules rimmed with possibly biogenic magnetites in association with the putative microfossils in the ALH 84001 meteorite. Although the ALH 84001 "nanofossils" were to small and simple to be unambiguously recognized as biogenic, they stimulated Astrobiology research and studies of microbial extremophiles and biomarkers in ancient rocks and meteorites. Recent studies of CI and CM carbonaceous meteorites have resulted in the detection of the well-preserved mineralized remains of coccoidal and filamentous microorganisms in cyanobacterial mats. Energy Dispersive X-ray Analysis has shown anomalous biogenic element ratios clearly indicating they are not recent biological contaminants. This paper reviews microbial extremophiles in context of their significance to Astrobiology. The study of halophilic microorganisms was started from work with saline soils and lakes, and one of the record of good growth for Haloferax mediterranei was shown at 30 percent NaC 1. Although alkali-tolerant nitrifying bacteria had previously been reported, the first described alkaliphilic microorganism was the bacterium Streptococcus faecalis. Halophilic and alkaliphilic forms are relevant to conditions that might be found in closed impact basins and craters on Mars filled with evaporite deposits. The first obligately acidophilic bacterium described was Acidithiobacillus ferrooxydans (formally Thiobacillus ferrooxidans). Later thermophilic lithotrophic acidophiles were found, and the hyperacidophilic moderately thermophilic species of the genus Picrophilus were found to grow at negative pH. The epoch of study of thermophilic microorganisms starts with the discovery of Thermus aquaticus, and presently the maximum temperature for growth at 113 C was found for <b>Pyrolobus</b> <b>fumarii.</b> The microorganisms capable of growth at high temperatures and in hyperacidic environments on Earth are good analogs for life that might be able to survive in hot acidic droplets in the upper regimes of the atmosphere of Venus. The study of barophiles was made possible by engineering achievements leading {{to the development of the}} submersible crafts used to study the Black Smokers of the Deep-sea Hydrothermal vents. The first described radioresistant bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans can survive ionizing irradiation and other DNA-damaging assaults at doses that are lethal to all other organisms. These microbes are models for life that might endure high radiation environments in the ice near the surface of comets or on the icy moons of Jupiter and Saturn and in the seafloor deep beneath icy crusts Europa and Enceladus. This paper presents ESEM and FESEM images showing intact microbes preserved in the deep ice cores extracted from just above Lake Vostok, Antarctica that are considered analogs for life forms that might survive on comets and icy moons...|$|E
40|$|Most hyperthermophiles {{are capable}} of chemolithoautotrophic metabolism. However, the {{assimilation}} of CO 2 in hyperthermophiles has only been studied extensively in methanogens and {{little is known about}} the physiology, metabolism, and enzymology of this process in other hyperthermophiles. The primary purpose of this study was to characterize CO 2 assimilation in Pyrobaculum islandicum, a non-methanogenic, hyperthermophilic archaeon. The results of this study were then tested in other hyperthermophilic, autotrophic Archaea to determine whether the phenomena observed are broadly applied by these organisms. ^ P. islandicum uses the citric acid cycle in oxidative and reductive directions for heterotrophic and autotrophic growth, respectively, but the control of carbon flow in the cycle is poorly understood. P. islandicum was grown autotrophically, heterotrophically, and mixotrophically with acetate, H 2, and low amounts of yeast extract. The activities of 11 of 19 enzymes involved in the central metabolism of P. islandicum differed significantly under the three different growth conditions suggesting that they are regulated. The results suggest that citrate lyase and AMP-forming acetyl-CoA synthetase, and not ATP citrate lyase, work opposite citrate synthase to control the direction of carbon flow in the citric acid cycle. Pyruvate synthase activity, which converts acetyl-CoA to pyruvate for biosynthesis, was absent from autotrophically and mixotrophically grown cultures. ^ The key enzymes of citramalate and 3 -hydroxypropionate cycles were measured from P. islandicum cells grown autotrophically and mixotrophically to determine how acetyl-CoA is further assimilated in the absence of pyruvate synthase. The results show that it can use the citramalate cycle for acetate assimilation but not for CO 2 assimilation. The pathway for acetyl-CoA assimilation in autotrophically grown P. islandicum remains unknown. Another autotrophic organism investigated was the thermoacidophilic archaeon Acidianus brierleyi. The absence of ATP citrate lyase activity in autotrophically-grown A. brierleyi and the presence of 3 -hydroxypropionate cycle enzyme activities in a previous study led to the suggestion that this organism only uses the latter cycle for CO 2 assimilation. In this study, all of the 3 -hydroxypropionate cycle and reductive citric acid cycle enzyme activities, including ATP citrate lyase activity, were detected but the latter enzyme required covalent modification by an acetylating compound (0. 03 % acetic anhydrite) for activity. This suggests that A. brierleyi combines the reductive citric acid cycle with the 3 -hydroxypropionate cycle for CO 2 assimilation. The citric acid cycle enzyme activities were also tested for in the hyperthermophilic, autotrophic archaeon <b>Pyrolobus</b> <b>fumarii</b> whose CO 2 assimilation pathway is unknown. Most of the activities were absent; therefore, a pathway other than the reductive citric acid cycle appears to be used for CO 2 assimilation in this organism. ^ In order to better understand the citric acid cycle in Archaea and potentially provide the necessary enzyme for citrate lyase purification and characterization, malate dehydrogenase (MDH), the most common citric acid cycle enzyme found in Archaea, was purified and characterized. Kinetic analysis of recombinant MDH indicates that it is optimized for activity in the reductive direction beyond that found in other characterized archaeal MDHs. There also appears to have been very little lateral gene transfer of MDH in Archaea. The results from these studies provide further insight into primary production by hyperthermophilic Archaea, which could potentially be a vast and important process within subsurface geothermal environments in the absence of sunlight. ...|$|E
