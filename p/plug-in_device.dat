40|$|The {{trend of}} {{industrial}} networks including critical infrastructures {{to rely upon}} ubiquitous computing and the realtime collaboration of many devices, demand for more sophisticated security concepts for future electronic systems. Office- IT systems have a high dynamic and IT-security concerns can easily be implemented within the regular lifecycle. Industrial networks {{on the other hand}} undergo less change and have longer operational time, which makes them more vulnerable to security threats due to outdated hard- and software. With Ethernet and IP based protocols, as omnipresent communication technologies in industrial networks, IT-security is becoming a mandatory aspect since security considerations have not been taken into account during the initial production of many legacy systems. In this paper a concept for embedded <b>plug-in</b> <b>devices</b> is presented which secures the authenticity and integrity of communication flows between communicating network parties in such systems. An adjusted signature based Diffie-Hellman key exchange, utilizing a Trusted Platform Module, is used to establish a trusthworthy secure connection between embedded <b>plug-in</b> <b>devices.</b> The connection uses a message authentication mechanism for IP based protocols through an adapted HMAC employment without neglecting the safety aspect imperative for industrial networks. A key focus of the development is to strengthen the communication infrastructure between embedded <b>plug-in</b> <b>devices</b> whilst retaining especially the necessary realtime capabilities. Possible attack vectors and errors are discussed to argue that the developed mechanisms are secure in compliance with both: safety and security...|$|R

40|$|Miscellaneous and {{electronic}} devices consume {{about one-third of}} the primary energy used in U. S. buildings, and their energy use is increasing faster than other end-uses. Despite the success of policies, such as Energy Star, that promote more efficient miscellaneous {{and electronic}} products, much remains to be done to address the energy use of these devices if we are to achieve our energy and carbon reduction goals. Developing efficiency strategies for these products depends on better data about their actual usage, but very few studies have collected field data on the long-term energy used by a large sample of devices due to the difficulty and expense of collecting device-level energy data. This paper describes the development of an improved method for collecting device-level energy and power data using small, relatively inexpensive wireless power meters. These meters form a mesh network based on Internet standard protocols and can form networks of hundreds of metering points in a single building. Because the meters are relatively inexpensive and do not require manual data downloading, they can be left in the field for months or years to collect long time-series energy use data. In addition to the metering technology, we also describe a field protocol used to collect comprehensive, robust data on the miscellaneous and electronic devices in a building. The paper presents sample results from several case study buildings, in which all the <b>plug-in</b> <b>devices</b> for several homes were metered, and a representative sample of several hundred <b>plug-in</b> <b>devices</b> in a commercial office building were metered for several months...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} is to examine the association between residential insecticide use during pregnancy and infancy, and the development of children. Study subjects were participants in the INMA (Environment and Childhood) Project, a Spanish multicenter birth cohort study. Prenatal and postnatal use of indoor insecticides and other variables were obtained from personal interview during pregnancy and infancy. Mental and psychomotor development was assessed around 14 months using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development. The associations were analyzed by linear regression models. 54 % of women used indoor insecticides at home during pregnancy and 47 % postnatally. 34 % of women used insecticide sprays and 33 % used <b>plug-in</b> <b>devices</b> during pregnancy. During infancy, the percentage of women who used insecticide sprays decreased (22 %), but the use of <b>plug-in</b> <b>devices</b> was similar to the prenatal period (32 %).

The current systems are basically provided with protection design in terms of handling over or under voltage and current shot but after occurrence of fault scenario, the diagnosis steps to identify the fault will tend to take time.

40|$|The use of {{existing}} packaging techniques for microelectronics are studied {{in terms of}} their applicability to the packaging of optoelectronic device arrays for photonic inter-connect applications. In particular, the packaging of smart pixel arrays for free-space optical backplanes is quantitatively explored. This assessment is made from three basic perspectives: thermal management capabilities, connectivity and bandwidth, and alignment to a free-space optical system. In the assessment, a smart pixel array design space analysis is derived which shows that, by constraining the smart pixel array characteristics, the use {{of existing}} packaging technologies is possible. This leads to the derivation of expressions which relate both system and smart pixel array parameters to representative packaging parameters. It is seen in the analysis that while the thermal management imposes constraints on the window size, smart pixel density and size, the alignment imposes constraints mostly on the window size. The architectural characteristics of the smart pixel array are mostly affected by the connectivity and bandwidth of the packaging technology. The integration of packaged smart pixel arrays into optical backplane demonstrators is also discussed, and the design and implementation of an optical backplane demonstrator is presented. This is complemented by the design, implementation and characterization of an optomechanical assembly which uses the interface between a single chip carrier and a socket to provide means of alignment in three degrees of freedom.

In recent years, critical infrastructures have become increasingly dependent on ICT; more interconnected and are often, as a result, linked to the Internet. Consequently, this makes these systems more vulnerable and increases the threat of cyber-attack. In addition, the growing use of wireless networks means that infrastructures can be more susceptible to a direct digital attack than ever before. Traditionally, protecting against environmental threats was {{the main focus of}} critical infrastructure preservation. Now, however, with the emergence of cyber-attacks, the focus has changed and infrastructures are facing a different danger with potentially debilitating consequences. Current security techniques are struggling to keep up to date with the sheer volume of innovative and emerging attacks; therefore, considering fresh and adaptive solutions to existing computer security approaches is crucial. The research presented in this thesis, details the use of behavioural observation for critical infrastructure security support.

By observing subtle changes in system behaviours, an additional level of support for critical infrastructure security is provided through a <b>plug-in</b> <b>device,</b> which operates autonomously and has no negative impact on data flow.

The women were recruited {{at the beginning of their}} pregnancy between 2003 and 2008 in four regions of Spain. Socio-demographic, environmental and lifestyle information was obtained at two interviews during pregnancy, one at the first (mean: 13. 8 +/- 2. 6 weeks of gestation) and the other at the third trimester (mean: 33. 3 +/- 23 weeks of gestation). Information about prenatal use of indoor and outdoor insecticides (type, timing, place of application, place of storage) was obtained from the second interview. In a 3 rd interview (mean: 16. 2 +/- 6. 9 months of age of children), information about postnatal indoor and outdoor insecticide use was obtained. Regression models examined the association between demographic and lifestyle factors and pesticide use to determine which characteristics predicted use prenatally and postnatally. Fifty-four percent of women reported using indoor insecticides during pregnancy, 45 % in their bedroom and 47 % elsewhere in the house. <b>Plug-in</b> <b>devices</b> were the most frequent application methods used in the pregnant woman's bedroom and insecticide sprays elsewhere in the house.

Background: In 2010, 3, 092 {{people were}} killed in crashes involving a distracted driver and an estimated additional 416, 000 were injured in motor vehicle crashes involving a distracted driver. There is currently a 17 item scale that predicts the behavior of distracted driving. The {{purpose of this study is}} to model distracted driving using the least number of questions, while maintaining a high predictive value. Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed with an anonymous online survey of college-attending drivers, with a 100 % probability sample from students attending 18 different educational institutions across San Diego County, California. Regression analysis identified correlations between predictive variables and total distracted driving scale. Factor analysis assisted in the creation of a scale assessing distracted driving behavior, which served as the key outcome. Results: The four strongest predictors of distracted driving were: self-efficacy in driving while multi-tasking (?? =. 37), perception of how safe multi-tasking while driving is (?? =. 19), social norms (?? =. 29), and driving frequency (?? =. 12). The final regression equation (F (17, 4945) = 224. 31; p <. 0001; R 2 =. 44) explained 44 % of the total variance of an individuals??? total distracted driving score. The internal consistency correlation, using Cronbach???s standardized alpha coefficient, was 0. 88. Principal axis factoring was accomplished using varimax rotation. A five factor scale (eigenvalue 1. 01 - 6. 78 with 64 % variance explained) was derived. Factor loadings ranged from. 43 to. 87. Criterion validity of the brief distracted driving scale was examined by comparing with total distracted driving score. Twelve items were deleted based on inter-item (less than. 30) and item-total (less than. 55) correlations and factor loadings (less than. 45). Five factors emerged and represented behaviors relating to the frequency of talking on the phone, texting, using <b>plug-in</b> <b>devices,</b> and using non-plug-in devices while driving. Conclusions: Data from this study suggest that a distracted driving scale with five questions can be used to assess distracted driving behaviors among college students.

40|$|Many {{researchers}} {{distinguish between}} two senses of smell—orthonasal (when we inhale or sniff) and retronasal (when volatiles are pulsed {{out from the}} back of the nose during eating). Orthonasal olfactory cues are key to setting our expectations concerning the sensory and hedonic attributes of food and drink; by contrast, retronasal olfactory cues are central to the experience of taste (or, better said, flavour). Food and beverage providers are increasingly modifying the product-extrinsic olfactory cues associated with their offerings in order to try and influence our food behaviours and hopefully enhance our multisensory product experiences. One way in which this is happening is via the introduction of olfactorily enhanced product packaging into the marketplace. A second key route is via the control and modification of the olfactory ‘smellscape’ in and around chain restaurants and food/beverage outlets. A third route that is slowly starting to emerge is technology-enabled olfactory marketing via scent-emitting billboards and scent-enabled <b>plug-ins</b> for mobile <b>devices.</b> Key opportunities and concerns, ethical and otherwise, surrounding the recent growth of olfactory marketing (specifically those examples incorporating food aromas) are highlighted.

40|$|Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) {{is being}} widely adopted for VoIP, IM and other {{collaborative}} applications {{due to its}} simple yet rich functional design. However, {{one of the main}} drawbacks has been its perapplication deployment (each application using its own SIP stack), leading to narrowly focussed development of SIP based services. In this paper, we propose a client-side SIP service and supporting network infrastructure blocks that provide unified mechanisms to execute generic SIP functions. The composition of these building blocks allows for creating richer applications, e. g. a conferencing server coupled with a gaming server provides dynamic conferencing between current occupants of a game room. The main feature of our framework is its availability to all applications including the ones not inherently based on SIP. Also, the SIP service API is designed to be extensible and in addition to providing novel higher level functional primitives like adhoc conferencing and seamless transition of sessions, it also exports a low level interface for specialized applications. Another feature of the service is that it allows a user to <b>plug-in</b> an end <b>device</b> of his/her choice on a per-session basis.
