50|$|The chamber {{is filled}} with {{carefully}} chosen gas, such as an argon/methane mix, such that any ionizing particle that passes through the tube will ionize surrounding gaseous atoms. The resulting ions and electrons are accelerated by the electric field across the chamber, causing a localised cascade of ionization known as a Townsend avalanche. This collects on the nearest wire and results in a charge proportional to the ionisation effect of the detected particle. By computing pulses from all the wires, the <b>particle</b> <b>trajectory</b> can be found.|$|E

Next, an example is given which defines the concept of a wave <b>particle’s</b> <b>trajectory</b> and the method of ship manoeuvring along a trajectory.

40|$|The Bohmian {{interpretation}} {{of quantum mechanics}} adds <b>particle</b> <b>trajectories</b> to the wave function and ensures that the probability distribution of the particle positions agrees with quantum mechanics at any time. This {{is not sufficient to}} avoid contradictions with quantum mechanics.

50|$|In 2011, de Gosson and Hiley {{showed that}} when in Bohm's model a {{continuous}} observation of a trajectory is performed, the observed trajectory {{is identical to}} the classical <b>particle</b> <b>trajectory.</b> This finding puts the Bohm model in connection to the well-known quantum Zeno effect. They confirmed this finding when they showed that the quantum potential enters into the approximation for the quantum propagator only on time scales of the order of , which means that a continuously observed particle behaves classically and furthermore that the quantum trajectory converges to a classical trajectory if the quantum potential decreases with time.|$|E

50|$|When the {{electric}} fields have been obtained, the trajectories of charged particles in these fields can be calculated. <b>Particle</b> <b>trajectory</b> calculations {{are a result}} of three interdependent computations. First, electrostatic forces must be calculated at the current position of the ion. These forces are then used to compute the current ion acceleration and then by numerical integration techniques to predict the position and velocity of the ion at the next time step. Moreover, the time step itself is continuously adjusted to maximize trajectory accuracy. A standard fourth-order Runge-Kutta method is used for numerical integration of the ion trajectory in three dimensions.|$|E
