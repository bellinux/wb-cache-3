Wskazano także konsekwencje, jakie wywołuje w postępowaniu karnym przedstawienie osobie zarzutów, jak również omówiono te instytucje procesowe, które są z nim związane zarówno w sferze realizacji praw oskarżonego do obrony oraz działań organów procesowych, jak i innych uczestników postępowania karnego. *The authors {{outline the}} history of the {{institution}} of presenting charges under Polish criminal proceedings. The <b>presentation</b> of <b>charges</b> as an institution appeared in Polish proceedings already in the 1950 ’s and since then the suspects have been informed about their rights. However, the institution itself has undergone a number of subsequent amendments. Currently, presenting charges entails many actions to be taken by the person who conducts preparatory proceedings. These actions require a particular form of investigation. And so, for example, the decision of the <b>presentation</b> of <b>charges</b> must have a written form. What is more, it must be read out to the suspect. Then, the suspect is to be interrogated. The charges are subject to alteration during the preparatory proceedings. After the charges have been presented, the person involved becomes a suspect. The <b>presentation</b> of <b>charges</b> gives rise to many legal effects which are also discussed in the paper...|$|R

40|$|N-BAR domains are protein modules {{that bind}} to and induce {{curvature}} in membranes via a charged concave surface and N-terminal amphipathic helices. Recently, molecular dynamics simulations {{have demonstrated that}} the N-BAR domain can induce a strong local curvature that matches the curvature of the BAR domain surface facing the bilayer. Here we present further molecular dynamics simulations that examine in greater detail {{the roles of the}} concave surface and amphipathic helices in driving local membrane curvature. We find that the strong curvature induction observed in our previous simulations requires the stable <b>presentation</b> of the <b>charged</b> concave surface to the membrane and is not driven by the membrane-embedded amphipathic helices. Nevertheless, without these amphipathic helices embedded in the membrane, the N-BAR domain does not maintain a close association with the bilayer, and fails to drive membrane curvature. Increasing the membrane negative charge through the addition of PIP 2 facilitates closer association with the membrane in the absence of embedded helices. At sufficiently high concentrations, amphipathic helices embedded in the membrane drive membrane curvature independently of the BAR domain...|$|R
50|$|Calsequestrin is a calcium-binding protein of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The protein helps hold calcium in the {{cisterna}} of the sarcoplasmic reticulum after {{a muscle}} contraction, {{even though the}} concentration of calcium in the sarcoplasmic reticulum {{is much higher than}} in the cytosol. It also helps the sarcoplasmic reticulum store an extraordinarily high amount of calcium ions. Each molecule of calsequestrin can bind 18 to 50 Ca2+ ions. Sequence analysis has suggested that calcium is not bound in distinct pockets via EF-hand motifs, but rather via <b>presentation</b> of a <b>charged</b> protein surface. Two forms of calsequestrin have been identified. The cardiac form Calsequestrin-2 (CASQ2) is present in cardiac and slow skeletal muscle and the fast skeletal form Calsequestrin-1(CASQ1) is found in fast skeletal muscle. The release of calsequestrin-bound calcium (through a calcium release channel) triggers muscle contraction. The active protein is not highly structured, more than 50% of it adopting a random coil conformation. When calcium binds there is a structural change whereby the alpha-helical content of the protein increases from 3 to 11%. Both forms of calsequestrin are phosphorylated by casein kinase 2, but the cardiac form is phosphorylated more rapidly and to a higher degree. Calsequestrin is also secreted in the gut where it deprives bacteria of calcium ions..|$|R

In this contribution, we will capitalize on our recent development of finite supramolecular nanofibers based on the self-assembly of modularly designed cationic multidomain peptides (MDPs) and use them as a model system to investigate structure-dependent cell penetrating activity. MDPs self-assembled into nanofibers with high density of cationic charges at the fiber-solvent interface to interact with the cell membrane. However, despite the multivalent <b>charge</b> <b>presentation,</b> not all fibers led to high levels of membrane activity and cellular uptake. The flexibility of the cationic charge domains on self-assembled nanofibers {{plays a key role in}} effective membrane perturbation. Nanofibers were found to sacrifice their dimension, thermodynamic and kinetic stability for a more flexible charge domain in order to achieve effective membrane interaction. The increased membrane activity led to improved cell uptake of membrane-impermeable chemotherapeutics through membrane pore formation. In vitro cytotoxicity study showed co-administering of water-soluble doxorubicin with membrane-active peptide nanofibers dramatically reduced the IC 50 by eight folds compared to drug alone. Through these detailed structure and activity studies, the acquired knowledge will provide important guidelines for the design of a variety of supramolecular cell penetrating nanomaterials not limited to peptide assembly which can be used to probe various complex biological processes...|$|R

40|$|After {{many years}} of {{teaching}} international students, I realized there is a rather limited and reoccurring list of problems in the students’ writing. These problems seem {{to be present in}} students’ writing regardless of their country of origin or first language. While many of these problems do not constitute a “fatal flaw”, they seriously undermine effectiveness of their written communication. To put in simple words, they make it harder for a reader to understand one’s true message. And this often {{has little to do with}} one’s knowledge of English. Therefore, this poster focuses primarily on the fundamental principles of written communication that make communication more effective regardless of which language is used for communication. Written communication effectiveness is defined here as the ability to get your recipient understand your true intended message with the minimum amount of time and effort. If English is a second or third language for a student, this does not automatically put him her at a disadvantage with respect to written communication. International students can still learn how to communicate effectively in written form despite the limited vocabulary or lack of understanding of many of the nuances of English grammar.

These principles can be communicated and enforced via handouts, presentations and written communication rubrics.

The session will include hands-on experiences using an inexpensive haptic device. 3 Brief History As early as 1965, Ivan Sutherland, the father of computer graphics, defined an “ultimate display ” that consisted of visual, haptic, smell, taste, and audio displays that could eventually provide a complete virtual experience that could not distinguish the real. Indeed, the recent advancements in graphics, display, sound, and haptics technologies made it possible to create increasingly immersive and multimodal interactions between users and virtual environments. 4 The Ultimate Display (1965) “We live in a physical world whose properties we have come to know well through long familiarity … We lack corresponding familiarity with the forces on charged particles, forces in non-uniform fields, the effects of nonprojective geometric transformations, and high-inertia, low friction motion. [The ultimate display can give] us a chance to gain familiarity with concepts not realizable in the physical world. It is a looking glass into a mathematical wonderland… The force required to move a joystick could be computer controlled [...] .

What is most revealing of the frailty of today's opinion is that it relies upon nothing but that implication from a dictum, plus its own (quite irrefutable because entirely value laden) [...] "balancing" [...] of the competing demands {{of the individual and}} the State. With respect to the point at issue here, different times and different places — even highly liberal times and places — have struck that balance in different ways. Some Western democracies currently permit the Executive a period of detention without impartially adjudicated cause. In England, for example, the Prevention of Terrorism Act 1989, 14(4), 5, permits suspects to be held without <b>presentation</b> and without <b>charge</b> for seven days. 12 Halsbury's Stat. 1294 (4th ed. 1989). It was the purpose of the Fourth Amendment to put this matter beyond time, place and judicial predilection, incorporating the traditional common-law guarantees against unlawful arrest. The Court says not a word about these guarantees, and they are determinative. Gersteins approval of a [...] "brief period" [...] of delay to accomplish [...] "administrative steps incident to an arrest" [...] is already a questionable extension of the traditional formulation, though it probably has little practical effect and can perhaps be justified on de minimis grounds. [...] To expand Gerstein, however, into an authorization for 48-hour detention related neither to the obtaining of a magistrate nor the administrative [...] "completion" [...] of the arrest seems to me utterly unjustified. Mr. McLaughlin was entitled to have a prompt impartial determination that there was reason to deprive him of his liberty — not according to a schedule that suits the State's convenience in piggybacking various proceedings, but as soon as his arrest was completed and the magistrate could be procured.” ...|$|R

I doubt that a resolution by a trial would have changed it, especially since that question would not have been the most relevant issue in the trial. Those who were on the other side were also vehement on behalf of Katz and Cohen - it is equally likely that their opinion would not have been changed by a trial.This matter has been before the ACBL Board of Directors for five years. Management has been continually required to furnish information to all lawyers. Katz and Cohen, by their resignations, have not been members of the ACBL nor have they played in ACBL-sanctioned events for five years. Estimates were that the trial would take five to eight weeks. A judge in Los Angeles County, therefore, made a most strenuous effort to dispose of this case without a trial.The basic position of the ACBL through all negotiations was that Katz and Cohen should not play together as a pair. Katz and Cohen would not accept this restriction. When there was movement by Katz and Cohen toward acceptance of restriction, this basic concession made it possible to find a ground whereby they could be considered for readmission. On Feb. 23, 1982, Katz and Cohen were re-admitted, but they agreed not to play together. The Katz-Cohen lawsuit alleged a number of causes of action, all of which were terminated by this settlement. Payment of the plaintiffs’ legal fees was made by the insurance company alone, a result of negotiations between the insurance company and the plaintiffs.

40|$|This thesis {{offers a}} sociological {{explanation}} for the electoral appeal of Pauline Hanson's One Nation (PHON) by performing a discourse analysis of the parties manifesto. This manifesto is comprised of the public speeches, parliamentary speeches and media releases of PHON delivered {{during the period of}} Hanson's term in the Australian Federal Parliament 1996 - 1998. The analysis is a synthesis of methodological approaches originated by Theodor Adorn and Erving Goffrnan. These approaches are rhetorical analysis and frame analysis. The combination of these approaches augmented by the simultaneous identification of key thematic domains allows the discourse analysis to be linked to issues canvassed by the Australian Election Study 1998 (AES 1998). It is proposed in the thesis that Hanson's political style is of the populist type that is demonstrated to be increasingly prevalent in Western politics. It is the paucity of sociological explanation that focuses on the manifestos of contemporary populist politics {{in order to understand the}} mechanism of appeal of such political movements that warrants this in-depth analysis of an Australian example of the phenomena. Firstly, the work of Adorno is revisited by considering the historical climate in which he was working in the 1930 s including the development of The Frankfurt School. During this time, Adorn developed a 'Gallery of Tricks and Devices' for analysing the radio programs of the fascist Presbyterian preacher, Martin Luther Thomas. The Gallery is actually a typology of rhetorical devices that Adorn identified in the speech of Thomas. Thomas employed a populist style and is known for his emotional appeals to his audience. This typology was then applied to the manifesto of 116 documents comprised of public and parliamentary speeches and media releases produced in Hanson's name from her election to Federal Parliament in 1996 until her defeat in 1998. The objective of this step of the discourse analysis was to assess the utility of Adorno's typology. A content analysis was also performed to ascertain the weighted means of the prevalence of the devices within each of the document categories. The results suggested that the typology required some revision to enhance its suitability for the efficient analysis of contemporary populist discourse. A Revised Typology was formulated and applied. This new typology has the potential to be useful in the analysis of the manifestos of a variety of political movements. This rhetorical analysis gives insight into the potential impact on listeners of particular excerpts of speech. The impact is the transference of messages about particular issues and is frequently emotive in tone. The incidence of each rhetorical device is composed of one or more sentences. The key issues identified were grouped according to theme. Three key thematic domains are identified and are labelled Cultural, Social and Economic Sovereignty. A contemporary form of Goffman's (1974) frame analysis developed by Snow and Benford (1986) informs the scrutiny of the discourse. The purpose of this step of the analysis is to ascertain what the overall potential impact of the collective effect of the rhetorical devices is on audiences. The term applied by Snow and Benford to describe the collective impact of the meaning of a particular discourse is Master Frame. It is asserted that the Master Frame of the PHON discourse is an Identity Frame. It has been suggested that a factor lacking in frame analysis generally, is the absence of the acknowledgement of the role of emotion in attracting people to political or social movements. The incorporation into the analysis of the application of a rhetorical typology addresses this shortcoming. It also serves to identify the emotional component of the discourse that is associated with the populist political style. The thesis claims that PHON's appeal is founded on successfully communicating its master frame to the constituency via its populist style. Furthermore that that this populist style relies heavily on emotionally <b>charged</b> <b>presentations</b> by the leader. The identification of the key thematic domains of the discourse is necessary in order to establish if there is indeed a link between the master frame of the discourse and PHON's appeal to the constituency. This is achieved by the statistical analysis of the AES 1998 data set. The first step of this analysis was to create a reliable scale to measure respondents 'feelings' towards PHON's leader, Pauline Hanson. Ten items were selected from the data sets that address aspects of respondent's feelings towards Hanson. This scale was labelled the Emotional Energy Scale following Randall Collins' (1988 b) definition of this concept. The data set was then searched for items that addressed issues encapsulated by the thematic domains. Section D. Election Issues, E. Social Policy and G. Constitution, Rights and Minorities were found to contain items that corresponded to the thematic domains. Section D. related to Economic Sovereignty; Section E. related to Social Sovereignty and Section G. related to Cultural Sovereignty. Factor analysis was used to create scales from items within each of these sections that addressed issues that dominated the PHON manifesto. Regression analysis was then employed. The results indicate that high levels of positive Emotional Energy for Hanson is predictive of shared attitudes towards issues by respondents with Hanson. This suggests that there is a strong correlation between the feelings held for people towards PHON and the level of support for PHON's position on issues. These findings indicate that Hanson successfully employed populist rhetoric to achieve a remarkable level of support for her new political party. However it must be acknowledged that an audience already existed for whom the PHON message could resonate. The demographic characteristics of PHON this audience of voters has been described at length elsewhere and this work is acknowledged. It must however be appreciated that though Pauline Hanson has experienced the inevitable decline of the charismatic leader, those who demonstrated support for her still reside in the electorate. These people may still be waiting for the right 'style' of voice to emerge on the political scene to represent them. This thesis provides an innovative approach for understanding the mechanism of populist appeal in contemporary politics. It proposes a revised typology for assessing populist rhetoric and it is the first thorough, systematic analysis of PHON's manifesto...|$|R
