2500|$|In July 1986 the CB71 {{became the}} CB72 after a rather {{thorough}} facelift. The headlights were new, of the wraparound sort {{and the interior}} was changed with a new dashboard, but the main changes were under the skin: the old rear suspension was replaced with Suzuki's patented ITL suspension (Isolated Trailing Link). This three-link rigid setup considerably improved the ride. By February 1987, the Fronte became available as a three-door, with the FS Twin Cam 12 version with a [...] at 7500rpm, DOHC 12-valve F5A engine (FR in the five-door version). The engine had two horsepower more in the Alto; {{this is due to}} less stringent emissions standards for commercial vehicles. In August 1987 a three-speed automatic transmission became available, and lastly there was also a <b>pert-time</b> four-wheel drive version of the five-door CB72 Fronte (the CD72S, from January 1988). By September, the CB/CD72 was replaced. The 1988 Suzuki Cervo used the chassis, front clip and door panels from the CB/CD72 Fronte.|$|E
5000|$|In 1965, Kett {{departed}} and {{was replaced}} by Colin McAuley a brilliant drummer whose flair complemented Oloman's leads. At this time, the group shortened their name to [...] "the Black Diamonds" [...] and had become the biggest band in the New Mountains area. [...] Record companies eventually started expressing interest. Alan Oloman was working as a <b>pert-time</b> announcer at the local radio station 2LT, where he got to know programming director Bob Jolly, who arranged for the group to record demos in the radio station's broadcasting studio, and sent them to various record labels, such as Festival Records's Pat Aulton, who were particularly impressed with the demo, [...] "See the Way", written by Alan Oloman, and arranged to have the group re-record it for the release of a single. [...] "See the Way" [...] was the A-side, and it was characterized by Alan Oloman's [...] "spacey" [...] sounding guitar parts, which were put through a ape delay to get the effect. [...] Even more striking was the B-Side, for which the group had originally intended to record a cover of a Rolling Stones song. [...] But, when producer Pat Aulton heard the band members practicing a riff, he recommended that they build a song around it, which resulted in [...] "I Want, Need, Love You", an intense and groundbreaking slab of hard rock and proto-punk, that featured an overdriven instrumental interlude replete with pounding jungle rhythms and a lightning-fast guitar solo by Alan Oloman. [...] The single was released in November 1966.|$|E
