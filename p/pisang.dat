5|$|Display of British and Singapore ensigns on island. Ensigns, {{associated}} with maritime matters, are marks of nationality and not sovereignty. Singapore had also not demonstrated any sovereign intent in the flying of the British and Singapore ensigns from Horsburgh Lighthouse. The Pulau <b>Pisang</b> incident {{was not an}} acknowledgement by Malaysia of Singapore's sovereignty over Pedra Branca; {{it had been a}} matter of domestic political sensibility – Pulau <b>Pisang</b> is much larger than Pedra Branca and has a small local population.|$|E
5|$|It had {{displayed}} British and Singapore ensigns from Horsburgh Lighthouse. Furthermore, it had acceded {{to a request}} by Malaysia in 1968 to remove the Singapore flag from another island, Pulau <b>Pisang,</b> which is under Malaysian sovereignty. Malaysia had made no such request in respect of Pedra Branca.|$|E
5|$|Several Malaysian Members of Parliament {{have urged}} the Federal Government to assert {{sovereignty}} over Pulau <b>Pisang</b> {{which also has}} a lighthouse on it that is operated by Singapore, or to take over administration of the lighthouse. Concerns were also expressed for Pulau Merambong near the western boundary of Malaysia and Singapore. The Menteri Besar of Johor, Abdul Ghani Othman, assured the public that Pulau <b>Pisang</b> belongs to Johor under a 1900 agreement between Sultan Ibrahim of Johor and British administrators in colonial Singapore. Nonetheless, Malaysian agencies have taken up efforts to stake claims over a hundred islands, reefs, rocks and other features in the South China Sea, Malacca Straits, and off Sabahan waters that Malaysia could lose to China, Indonesia and Vietnam. Two of these islands are Pulau Unarang off eastern Sabah near the Indonesian border, and Pulau Perak {{to the west of}} Penang.|$|E
5|$|The current court {{complex is}} located at <b>Pisang</b> Emas Road. It {{comprises}} the High Court, the Sessions Court, and the Magistrate Court. Bintulu also has Syariah Subordinate Court, located at Tanjung Kidurong, whose area of jurisdiction covers Bintulu District and Tatau districts. The Bintulu central police station {{is located at}} Tun Hussein Onn Road, with other police stations located at Tanjung Kidurong, Tubau, and Sebauh. There is also a central prison in Bintulu, which doubles as a correctional centre.|$|E
5|$|The Court {{regarded}} as conduct à titre de souverain Singapore's investigation of six shipwrecks {{in the vicinity}} of Pedra Branca between 1920 and 1993, its exclusive control over visits to the island, the installation of the military rebroadcast station on the island in 1977, and the proposed reclamation of land around it. Malaysia was correct in asserting that the flying of an ensign was not normally a manifestation of sovereignty, and that the difference in size between Pulau <b>Pisang</b> and Pedra Branca had to be recognised. Nonetheless, some weight could be given to the fact that Malaysia had not requested for the Singapore ensign flying at Horsburgh Lighthouse to be taken down. The fact that Malaysia had referred to the lighthouse as a Singapore station in the 1959 and 1966 meteorological reports and had omitted it from the 1967 Malaysian report favoured Singapore's case.|$|E

25|$|Mahathir was a {{hard-working}} student. Discipline {{imposed by}} his father motivated him to study, and he showed little interest in sports. He started out his primary education at the Seberang Perak Malay Boys School in 1930 and studied there for two years. However, in 1933, he won a position in a selective English medium secondary school, having become fluent in English well ahead of his primary school peers. With schools closed during the Japanese occupation of Malaya during World War II, he went into business, first selling coffee and later <b>pisang</b> goreng (banana fritters) and other snacks. After the war, he graduated from secondary school by completing Senior Cambridge exams in December 1946 and enrolled to study medicine at the King Edward VII College of Medicine in Singapore (now part of National University of Singapore). There he met his future wife, Siti Hasmah Mohamad Ali, a fellow medical student. After he graduated, Mahathir worked as a doctor in government service before marrying in 1956. He returned to Alor Setar the following year to set up his own practice. The success of his practice, as the only Malay doctor in the town, allowed him to build a large house, invest in various businesses and, pointedly, employ a chauffeur to drive his Pontiac Catalina. He and Siti Hasmah had their first child, Marina, in 1957, before conceiving three others and adopting three more over the following 28 years.|$|E
500|$|The {{origin of}} the name Sabah is uncertain, {{and there are many}} {{theories}} that have arisen. One theory is that during the time {{it was part of the}} Bruneian Sultanate, it was referred to as Saba because of the presence a variety of banana called <b>pisang</b> saba (also known as <b>pisang</b> menurun), which is grown widely on the coast of the region and popular in Brunei. The Bajau community referred to it as <b>pisang</b> jaba. While the name Saba also refers to a variety of banana in both Tagalog and Visayan languages, the word in Visayan has the meaning of [...] "noisy". Perhaps due to local dialect, the word Saba has been pronounced as Sabah by the local community. While Brunei was a vassal state of Majapahit, the Old Javanese eulogy of Nagarakretagama described the area in what is now Sabah as Seludang.|$|E
500|$|Since 1978 {{the town}} of Bintulu has been {{administered}} by the Bintulu Development Authority (BDA), with offices located along Jalan Tanjung Kidurong. The town is located within the boundary of Bintulu District, {{with a population of}} 183,402 and a total area of [...] Bintulu Division was formerly a Bintulu District under the jurisdiction of Miri Division. The former Bintulu District was upgraded to Bintulu Division on 1 January 1987. At the same time, Bintulu sub-district was upgraded to the present-day Bintulu District. Both the Bintulu Resident and District offices are located inside Wisma Residen, <b>Pisang</b> Keling Street, Bintulu.|$|E
500|$|The Colony of Singapore {{became a}} self-governing state in 1959, {{and left the}} British Empire to join the Federation of Malaysia in 1963. Two years later, in 1965, Singapore became a fully {{independent}} republic. In 1959, in an official publication regarding meteorological information collected on Pedra Branca, Malaya listed Horsburgh Lighthouse as a [...] "Singapore" [...] station together with the Sultan Shoal and Raffles Lighthouses. The lighthouse on Pedra Branca was described {{in the same way}} in a joint Malaysian and Singaporean publication in 1966, the year after Singapore left the Federation. In 1967, when the two countries began reporting meteorological information separately, Malaysia ceased referring to Horsburgh Lighthouse. In maps published by the Malayan and Malaysian Surveyor General and Director of General Mapping in 1962, 1965, 1970, 1974 and 1975, the island was indicated with the word [...] "(SINGAPORE)" [...] or [...] "(SINGAPURA)" [...] under it. The same designation was used for an island that was unquestionably under Singapore's sovereignty. On the other hand, the designation was not used for Pulau <b>Pisang,</b> an island under Malaysian sovereignty on which Singapore operated a lighthouse.|$|E
500|$|A {{focus of}} Tang's {{art is the}} theme of {{national}} and cultural identities, I Was Born Japanese (1995) being an example. Tang notes that he has had four nationalities. He was issued with a Japanese birth certificate as he was born during the Japanese Occupation of Singapore. He became a British national after World War II, a Malaysian citizen when Singapore joined the Federation of Malaysia in 1963, and a Singaporean citizen when Singapore gained full independence in 1965. While living in the UK he was conscious of his Chinese identity, but later on he took the view that he might not be fully Chinese since China had been occupied by the Mongols and Manchurians: [...] "I'm not sure if I'm 100% Chinese blood. I'm sure my ancestor has got mixture of Mongolian and even Thai and Miao people [...] We are all mixed, and this is true. But I always like to think {{that there is only one}} race in the world. We are all one human race." [...] Another of Tang's performances, Jantung <b>Pisang</b> – Heart of a Tree, Heart of a People, centres around the banana tree. He was inspired by the fact that the banana is used widely in Southeast Asia as an offering to bring blessings, but is also feared as it is associated with ghosts and spirits. He also sees banana trees as a reminder of the lack of democracy in certain parts of the world: [...] "Democracy in many Asian countries and Third World countries is as shallow as the roots of a banana tree. We need to deepen [...]" ...|$|E
