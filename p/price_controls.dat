5|$|After Nixon won re-election, {{inflation}} was returning. He reimposed <b>price</b> <b>controls</b> in June 1973. The <b>price</b> <b>controls</b> became unpopular {{with the public}} and businesspeople, who saw powerful labor unions as preferable to the price board bureaucracy. The controls produced food shortages, as meat disappeared from grocery stores and farmers drowned chickens rather than sell them at a loss. Despite the failure to control inflation, controls were slowly ended, and on April 30, 1974, their statutory authorization lapsed.|$|E

Salaries above $9,000 had {{to be approved by}} Patterson and Groves.|$|E
5|$|An {{attempt by}} the Kirchner {{administration}} to impose <b>price</b> <b>controls</b> in 2005 failed as the items most in demand went out of stock and the mandatory prices were in most cases not observed.

40|$|As {{a result}} of the 1973 oil embargo and the {{subsequent}} increase of world oil prices, the oil <b>price</b> <b>control</b> program took place {{in order to reduce the}} impact of sharply higher external oil prices. In this regard, since the domestic price for oil was below that of the world market, the <b>price</b> <b>control</b> effort seemed to be regarded as successful. Did the oil <b>price</b> <b>control</b> achieve its goal? Maybe not. This study shows that the <b>price</b> <b>control</b> for the domestically produced crude oil was ineffective and enhanced the ability of external suppliers to manipulate prices.

40|$|<b>Price</b> <b>control</b> is an {{instrument}} of economic policy for correcting distortions in the relative price structure, resource allocation and income distribution caused by market imperfections. <b>Price</b> <b>control</b> legislations {{have been used by}} governments in restraining inflation and overcoming shortages of goods. Nevertheless, the issue remains whether the existing legal framework governing the <b>price</b> <b>control</b> mechanism is able to provide a comprehensive protection for consumers? This paper analyzes the legal and administrative mechanism which has been designed to manage <b>price</b> <b>control</b> in Malaysia. The mechanism used is explained by examining the provisions under <b>Price</b> <b>Control</b> and Anti Profiteering Act 2011 (Act 723). The paper also explores the legal issues associated with the existing <b>price</b> <b>control</b> legislation. This research is essentially a qualitative legal research whereby the materials used are obtained from libraries, archives and other databases. Applying a systematic inquiry or investigation of the factual data and theoretical concepts of rules and legal principles, the data is analyzed using analytical and critical analysis. The research finds that one of the aims of <b>price</b> <b>control</b> is to prevent traders and businesses from unscrupulously charging exorbitant prices for their goods and services and thus <b>price</b> <b>control</b> legislation can be seen to act as a safeguard for consumers against opportunistic profiteers. This paper concludes that in view of consumer protection, there are major improvements on managing <b>price</b> <b>control</b> under the new Act 723, however there are also limitations and weaknesses that can be considered and corrected for further improvement...|$|R

5|$|Growing {{government}} spending, large wage raises, {{and inefficient}} production created a chronic inflation that {{rose through the}} 1980s, when it briefly exceeded {{an annual rate of}} 1000%. Successive regimes tried to control inflation by wage and <b>price</b> <b>controls,</b> cuts in public spending, and restriction of the money supply. Efforts to stem the problems came to naught when in 1982 Argentina came into conﬂict with the United Kingdom over the Falkland Islands.|$|E
5|$|Not all of Diocletian's {{plans were}} successful: the Edict on Maximum Prices (301), {{his attempt to}} curb {{inflation}} via <b>price</b> <b>controls,</b> was counterproductive and quickly ignored. Although effective while he ruled, Diocletian's tetrarchic system collapsed after his abdication under the competing dynastic claims of Maxentius and Constantine, sons of Maximian and Constantius respectively. The Diocletianic Persecution (303–11), the empire's last, largest, and bloodiest official persecution of Christianity, did not destroy the empire's Christian community; indeed, after 324, Christianity became the empire's preferred religion under its first Christian emperor, Constantine.|$|E
5|$|The {{president}} {{was faced with}} the reawakening of labor-management conflicts that had lain dormant during the war years, severe shortages in housing and consumer products, and widespread dissatisfaction with inflation, which at one point hit 6% in a single month. Added to this polarized environment was a wave of destabilizing strikes in major industries. Truman's response to them was generally seen as ineffective. A rapid increase in costs was fueled by the release of <b>price</b> <b>controls</b> on most items, and labor sought wage increases. A serious steel strike in January 1946 involving 800,000 workers—the largest in the nation's history—was followed by a coal strike in April and a rail strike in May. The public was angry, with a majority in polls favoring a ban on strikes by public service workers and a year's moratorium on labor actions. For commodities where <b>price</b> <b>controls</b> remained, producers were often unwilling to sell at artificially low prices: farmers refused to sell grain for months in 1945 and 1946 until payments were significantly increased, even though grain was desperately needed, not only for domestic use, but to stave off starvation in Europe.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} is an {{analysis}} of <b>price</b> <b>control</b> in the Czech Republic from 1989 until present and identification {{of positive and negative}} effects of the control on market environment in the examined period. One fifth of the consumer basket which is used to measure inflation by Czech Statistical Office is subject to the <b>price</b> <b>control</b> of usual <b>prices.</b> Therefore, the <b>price</b> <b>control</b> influences wide variety of services and goods and thus, the analysis of this control is still very interesting and up to date. The theoretical part characterizes terms and definitions such as a theory of <b>price</b> <b>control,</b> kinds of control and a theory of price from the theoretical point of view. It also describes fields that are included in a state <b>price</b> <b>control.</b> Another important part describes views of different economical schools {{on the issue of the}} state <b>price</b> <b>control</b> and theory of ownership. The practical part deals with the analysis of <b>price</b> <b>control</b> in the Czech Republic in a time span from 1989 until present. The first part analyzes price liberalization which is one of the pillars of transformation of the Czech Republic after 1989. Other part characterizes the remaining period, in which, the most important part is the accession of the Czech Republic to the EU...|$|R

5|$|While Playford {{was known}} for his use of <b>price</b> <b>controls</b> to {{restrain}} the price of living and therefore attract blue-collar workers to settle in the state and fuel industrialisation, South Australia was slow to introduce consumer protection laws in regards to quality control. It was believed that he was opposed to compulsory pasteurisation and other quality standards on milk to avoid offending his rural support base. Playford's reluctance to introduce regulations for tradesmen such as builders, electricians and plumbers were often seen to have resulted from his being a keen do-it-yourself handyman.|$|E
5|$|In the Senate, Nixon took a {{prominent}} position in opposing global communism, traveling frequently and {{speaking out against}} it. He maintained friendly relations with his fellow anti-communist, the controversial Wisconsin senator, Joseph McCarthy, but was careful to keep some distance between himself and McCarthy's allegations. Nixon also criticized President Harry S. Truman's handling of the Korean War. He supported statehood for Alaska and Hawaii, {{voted in favor of}} civil rights for minorities, and supported federal disaster relief for India and Yugoslavia. He voted against <b>price</b> <b>controls</b> and other monetary restrictions, benefits for illegal immigrants, and public power.|$|E
5|$|Nixon ended American {{involvement}} {{in the war in}} Vietnam in 1973 and brought the American POWs home, and ended the military draft. Nixon's visit to China in 1972 eventually led to diplomatic relations between the two nations, and he initiated détente and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with the Soviet Union the same year. His administration generally transferred power from Washington D.C. to the states. He imposed wage and <b>price</b> <b>controls</b> for ninety days, enforced desegregation of Southern schools and established the Environmental Protection Agency. Nixon also presided over the Apollo 11 moon landing, which signaled the end of the moon race. He was reelected in one of the largest electoral landslides in U.S. history in 1972 when he defeated George McGovern.|$|E

5|$|Planning for the {{demobilisation}} of the Australian military {{began at}} the end of 1942 when the Department of Post-War Reconstruction was formed. The department was involved with drawing up plans for determining veterans' entitlements and the assistance which would be provided to discharged personnel to help them settle into civilian life. This included planning the delivery of training, housing and ensuring that jobs were available. An important consideration was to ensure that civilian employment opportunities were created at an appropriate rate as the size of the military was reduced. In order to achieve this, it was decided to continue many wartime economic regulations such as <b>price</b> <b>controls</b> in order to limit inflation and direct resources to where the Australian Government believed they were most needed.|$|E
5|$|Although the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System began pumping oil in 1977, it did {{not have}} a major {{immediate}} impact on global oil prices. This is partly because it took several years to reach full production and partly because U.S. production outside Alaska declined until the mid-1980s. The Iranian Revolution and OPEC price increases triggered the 1979 energy crisis despite TAPS production increases. Oil prices remained high until the late 1980s, when a stable international situation, the removal of <b>price</b> <b>controls,</b> and the peak of production at Prudhoe Bay contributed to the 1980s oil glut. In 1988, TAPS was delivering 25 percent of all U.S. oil production. As North Slope oil production declined, so did TAPS' share of U.S. production. Today, TAPS provides less than 17 percent of U.S. oil production.|$|E
5|$|By early 1934, {{the focus}} {{shifted away from}} funding work {{creation}} schemes and toward rearmament. By 1935, military expenditures accounted for 73 percent of the government's purchases of goods and services. On 18 October 1936, Hitler named Göring as Plenipotentiary of the Four Year Plan, intended {{to speed up the}} rearmament programme. In addition to calling for the rapid construction of steel mills, synthetic rubber plants and other factories, Göring instituted wage and <b>price</b> <b>controls</b> and restricted the issuance of stock dividends. Large expenditures were made on rearmament in spite of growing deficits. With the introduction of compulsory military service in 1935, the Reichswehr, which had been limited to 100,000 by the terms of the Versailles Treaty, expanded to 750,000 on active service at the start of World War II, with a million more in the reserve. By January 1939, unemployment was down to 301,800 and it dropped to only 77,500 by September.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to a labor/management impasse arising from bitter disagreements over wage and <b>price</b> <b>controls,</b> Truman instructed his Secretary of Commerce, Charles W. Sawyer, {{to take control of}} a number of the nation's steel mills in April 1952. Truman cited his authority as Commander in Chief and the need to maintain an uninterrupted supply of steel for munitions for the war in Korea. The Supreme Court found Truman's actions unconstitutional, however, and reversed the order in a major separation-of-powers decision, Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer (1952). The 6–3 decision, which held that Truman's assertion of authority was too vague and was not rooted in any legislative action by Congress, was delivered by a Court composed entirely of Justices appointed by either Truman or Roosevelt. The high court's reversal of Truman's order was one of the notable defeats of his presidency.|$|E
5|$|The {{food supply}} of the country {{depended}} on cereals produced in southern Russia, while the Finns had specialized in milk and butter production. The cessation of the cereal imports from disintegrating Russia led to food shortages in Finland. The Senate responded by introducing rationing and <b>price</b> <b>controls.</b> The farmers opposed the state control; a black market with sharply rising food prices formed and export to free market of the Petrograd area increased. Food supply, prices, {{and in the end}} the fear of starvation became emotional political issues between farmers and industrial workers, in particular the unemployed ones. The common people, their fears exploited by the politicians and the political media, took to the streets. Despite the food shortages, no large-scale starvation hit southern Finland before the civil war and the food market remained a secondary stimulator in the power struggle of the Finnish state.|$|E
5|$|The main {{shopping}} area was Jackson Square, with about 20 shops. The Army attempted to keep prices down by encouraging competition, but this met with limited success {{due to the}} captive nature of the population, and the requirements of security, which meant that firms and goods could not freely move in and out. The Army could give prospective concessionaires only vague information about {{how many people were}} in or would be in the town, and concessions were only {{for the duration of the}} war. Concessions were therefore charged a percentage of their profits in rental rather than a fixed fee. The Army avoided imposing draconian <b>price</b> <b>controls,</b> but limited prices to those of similar goods in Knoxville. By 1945, community amenities included 6 recreation halls, 36 bowling alleys, 23 tennis courts, 18 ball parks, 12 playgrounds, a swimming pool, a 9,400-volume library, and a newspaper.|$|E
