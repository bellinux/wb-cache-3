5000|$|According to the April 16, 1959 {{edition of}} the Journal and Courier, the Tippecanoe County Medical Society {{recognized}} [...] "the critical shortage of hospital facilities in Greater Lafayette, Tippecanoe County and the surrounding area, sought {{the assistance of the}} Greater Lafayette Chamber of Commerce in obtaining expansion of Home and St. Elizabeth Hospitals." [...] A report was issued by the HEALTH committee by Dr. Herman Smith and Associates - a hospital consultant - emphasizing the need for improvement and expansion at both facilities. The reason why the hospitals needed to be modernized: expansion and growth in the community, especially with new industries and a growing student population at Purdue. The more than $3 million campaign was launched with four goals in mind: to address the existing shortage of hospital beds; the greater demand for beds and other hospital facilities that would accompany population growth; the need for replacement of outmoded facilities; and the improvements necessary for the hospitals {{to keep pace with the}} continuing advancements in medical science. The HEALTH campaign went to build a new four-story wing for 100 beds, a new lobby and administrative area, new emergency department, <b>physical</b> <b>medicine</b> <b>department,</b> central medicine supply department, X-ray suite, operating rooms and laboratories at Home Hospital. In the marketing material, it recalled the history of each entity and how they were working together for the community: [...] "Together, St. Elizabeth and Lafayette Home Hospital have provided the finest possible health service to our community for a total of over 140 years. The history of each institution is a story of struggle and of heartening achievement. Now, however, as our hospitals look to the future, their ability to continue serving this expanding community, is once again, threatened. The facilities in our hospitals, just as for those in many other institutions across the land, have in recent years been severely strained by record demands for health care. The urgent need to bring our facilities up-to-date must be met now, for when emergency strikes, there must be room in our hospitals." ...|$|E

40|$|Background and Objectives: Work on the {{oncology}} {{department has}} proved to be very stressful, so the medical staff indirectly copes with it by trying to escape it through the ego-defense mechanisms. On the other hand, working on the <b>physical</b> <b>medicine</b> <b>department</b> {{does not seem to be}} so stressful. The objective of this study was to determine the main ego- defense mechanisms at oncology and <b>physical</b> <b>medicine</b> <b>department</b> and to explain the differences between their frequencies. The other part was to obtain data about socio- demographic status and working environment of the participants. Methods: General structural interview for collecting data on socio-demographic status and working environment and Life Style Questionnaire and Defense Mechanisms for obtaining data about ego-defense mechanisms were carried out among a random sample of 40 medical staff members at each department. Results: A significantly higher level (p&# 8804;. 05) of the following ego-defense mechanisms has been found at the oncology department: regression, intellectualization, projection and dislocation. Also, statistically significant difference (p&# 8804;. 05), showing higher score on oncology department is observed in following variables: death of patients, facing the patient or his family with possible death, being overloaded with number of patients, facing pain, suffering and handicap, insufficiency of medications, insufficient positive feedback from the patients and bad interpersonal relations at work as well as lack of support from the colleagues.

40|$|ObjectivesThe rupture of the {{anterior}} {{part of the}} gluteus medius tendon has remained an ill-defined entity. The objectives are to develop some specific clinical signs, to {{emphasize the importance of}} MRI and to discuss the place of surgery. Patients and methodsSix patients were treated in the <b>physical</b> <b>medicine</b> <b>department</b> (Besançon) from 2009 to 2014 for trochanteric pain, with tears of the gluteus medius tendon confirmed by MRI. They all received suture surgery. ResultsIt was 4 women and 2 men (mean age 71 years). The interrogation at diagnosis: pain lasting for 5. 4 months [3. 5 – 9], no injuries reported, visual analog scale(VAS) 7. 6 [5 – 9], sudden onset (83 %), night pain (100 %), Blazina score ≥  3 (100 %). Clinical examination: normal and symmetric range of motion except a limitation of 10 degrees of lateral rotation on the symptomatic side for 5 / 6 patients (83 %), symptomatic triad (stretching, resisted contraction, palpation) in 100 % of cases, positive Trendelenburg sign for 5 patients (83 %) and 4 / 6 patients with decrease of the gluteus medius strength (cotation 4 / 5). All patients had an MRI: partial rupture (1 case), complete rupture (5 cases) of {{the anterior}} fibers of the gluteus medius. After failure of medical treatment, conducted on average 4. 7 months [3 – 11 months], a surgical treatment was chosen for all patients. Clinical reassessment 6 months after surgery: significant improvement on pain: VAS= 2. 4 (0 to 5. 5) (P< 0. 01), disappearance of night pain in 5 / 6 cases (83 %), disappearance of lameness (4 / 5 cases) except for one patient with persistent loss of gluteus medius muscle strength (cotation 4 / 5). ConclusionTears of the gluteus medius tendons are likely to be a more common cause of pain in the greater trochanteric region than previously thought, especially if there are sudden onset, night pain, loss of muscle strength or Trendelenburg sign.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Settings- <b>Physical</b> <b>Medicine</b> and Rehabilitation <b>Department</b> among first year residents. Study Design- Educational intervention. Didactic lecture followed by active teaching method. Statistical Analysis- Analysed using SPSS- 16 package software. Initially, the first year students were subjected to a pretest, which consists of ten single responses multiple choice questions regarding - “The Carpel Tunnel Syndrome. ” This is followed by didactic lecture about the above topic. After this lecture, a post test was conducted with identical questions as the pretest. Then, an interactive session and hands on demonstration of confirming the carpel tunnel syndrome by nerve conduction studies were given. Following this, the same post test was then repeated. RESULTS The arithmetic mean value of pretest score was 3. 5, which improved to 8. 33 after the lecture session.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Botulinum toxin {{injections}} are {{an effective}} treatment for limb spasticity following stroke. Different tracking techniques {{are used for}} this purpose: palpation, electrostimulation, electromyography and ultrasound. Yet very few studies have compared these different techniques, and none has successfully proved the superior efficacy of ultrasound-guided injections compared to another tracking method. The primary objective of our study was therefore to compare the efficacy of botulinum toxin injections depending on the tracking technique used: ultrasound versus electrostimulation. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a clinical, single-centre, prospective, interventional, single-blind, crossover, randomised trial. In total, 30 patients aged between 18 and 80 years presenting with triceps surae spasticity (evaluated > 1 on the modified Ashworth scale) associated with hemiplegia sequelae due to stroke will be included. The patients will be selected among those who attend for consultation the <b>Physical</b> <b>Medicine</b> and Rehabilitation <b>Department</b> of the Clermont-Ferrand University Hospital. One group will receive the abobotulinumtoxinA (BoNT-A) injection guided by electrostimulation then ultrasound, and the second group's botulinum toxin injections will be guided by ultrasound then electrostimulation. For each patient, the duration of study participation is 5 months. The primary end point is variation in passive ankle dorsiflexion range of motion at slow and high speeds (Tardieu scale) with the knee straight.

Initial clinical and demographic data were collected retrospectively. The severity of aphasia was assessed by the Aphasia Severity Rating Scale (ASRS) and communication skills in daily life by a French communication scale (Échelle de Communication Verbale de Bordeaux). Results 20 patients have been included, mean age 44 years; acute phase aphasia was always severe. Assessment was conducted 10 to 25 years after the onset (mean 16. 8 years), 55 % of patients had mild aphasia (ASRS 4 – 5), 25 % moderate aphasia (ASRS 3) and 20 % severe aphasia (ASRS 1 – 2).
