40|$|Self-assembly of {{aromatic}} peptide amphiphiles {{is known}} to be driven by a combination of π-π stacking of the aromatic moieties and hydrogen bonding between the <b>peptide</b> <b>backbones,</b> with possible stabilisation from the amino acid side chains. Phenylalanine-based Fmoc-dipeptides have previously been reported for their characteristic apparent pKa transitions, which were shown to coincide with significant structural and morphological changes that were peptide sequence dependent. Here, phenylalanine was replaced by leucine and the effect on the self-assembling behaviour of Fmoc-dipeptides was measured using potentiometry, fluorescence and infrared spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray scattering and shear rheometry. This study provides additional cues towards the elucidation of the sequence-structure relationship in self-assembling aromatic peptide amphiphiles...|$|R

Several methods {{have also been}} developed to generate libraries of mRNA-encoded peptides and proteins for the in vitro selection of functional polypeptides. In principal, such mRNA encoding systems could be used with libraries of nonbiological polymers if the ribosome can be directed to polymerize tRNAs carrying unnatural amino acids. The fundamental problem is that current chemical aminoacylation systems cannot easily produce sufficient amounts of the numerous misacylated tRNAs required to synthesize a complex library of encoded polymers. Here, we show that bulk-aminoacylated tRNA can be transformed into N-monomethylated aminoacyl tRNA and translated. Because poly-N-methyl <b>peptide</b> <b>backbones</b> are refractory to proteases and are membrane permeable, our method provides an uncomplicated means of evolving novel drug candidates...|$|R

They may specify the location of just the C-alpha atoms if it is a reduced atom representation, or all the backbone heavy atoms (N, C-alpha, C carbonyl, O). Note that side chains are typically not modeled using the fragment library approach. To model discrete states of a side chain, one could use a rotamer library approach.|$|E
25|$|In metalloproteins, metal ions {{are usually}} coordinated by nitrogen, oxygen or sulfur centers {{belonging}} to amino acid residues of the protein. These donor groups are often provided by side-chains on the amino acid residues. Especially important are the imidazole substituent in histidine residues, thiolate substituents in cysteine residues, and carboxylate groups provided by aspartate. Given {{the diversity of}} the metalloproteome, virtually all amino acid residues have been shown to bind metal centers. The <b>peptide</b> <b>backbone</b> also provides donor groups; these include deprotonated amides and the amide carbonyl oxygen centers. Lead(II) binding in natural and artificial proteins has been reviewed.|$|E
25|$|In an {{antiparallel}} arrangement, {{the successive}} β-strands alternate directions {{so that the}} N-terminus of one strand is adjacent to the C-terminus of the next. This is the arrangement that produces the strongest inter-strand stability because it allows the inter-strand hydrogen bonds between carbonyls and amines to be planar, which is their preferred orientation. The <b>peptide</b> <b>backbone</b> dihedral angles (φ,ψ) are about (–140°,135°) in antiparallel sheets. In this case, if two atoms C and C are adjacent in two hydrogen-bonded β-strands, then they form two mutual backbone hydrogen bonds to each other's flanking peptide groups; {{this is known as}} a close pair of hydrogen bonds.|$|E

2500|$|Secondary {{structure}} {{refers to}} highly regular local sub-structures {{on the actual}} polypeptide backbone chain. Two main types of secondary structure, the α-helix and the β-strand or β-sheets, were suggested in 1951 by Linus Pauling and coworkers. These secondary structures are defined by patterns of hydrogen bonds between the main-chain peptide groups. They have a regular geometry, being constrained to specific values of the dihedral angles ψ and φ on the Ramachandran plot. Both the α-helix and the β-sheet represent a way of saturating all the hydrogen bond donors and acceptors in the <b>peptide</b> <b>backbone.</b> Some parts of the protein are ordered but do not form any regular structures.

The approach is therefore of particular value {{for the study of}} those systems for which geometric criteria and predefined interaction potentials have not yet been obtained. This is demonstrated for a DMSO-water mixture, for which the population-analysis criterion provides a simple measure for different interaction types, e. g., between water-oxygen and methyl-hydrogen atoms.

The conformational {{properties of the}} new hybrid conjugates have been assessed through molecular dynamics simulations and compared to those of their individual components Our {{results suggest that the}} free unconjugated <b>peptides</b> tend to,adopt <b>backbone</b> arrangements. which resemble a beta-hairpin shape, a conformation which has been reported to facilitate amyloid self-aggregation. The backbone conformational preferences of the unlinked peptides are maintained in the peptide-polymer hybrid.

This suggests that the conformational profile of the <b>peptides</b> <b>backbones</b> is preserved when linked to the polymer, maintaining the amyloid precursor like structure. Additionally, several hydrodynamic parameters Were computed for both the polylactic acid and for the conjugates: no significant differences were observed, which suggests that the peptide moiety of the hybrid does not significantly affect the conformational tendencies of the polymer chain. Combined, our results provide a conformational exploration of two amyloid-forming peptides and first steps toward the design of two feasible self aggregating hybrid material...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{interest}} in sulfhydryl cross-linked nonviral gene delivery systems, designed {{to trigger the}} intracellular release of DNA, has inspired studies to establish their utility in vitro. To determine if this concept can be extrapolated to in vivo gene delivery, sulfhydryl cross-linking peptides (dp 20), derivatized with either an N-glycan or polyethylene glycol (PEG), were used to generate sulfhydryl cross-linked gene formulations. The biodistribution, metabolism, cell-type targeting, and gene expression of sulfhydryl cross-linked PEG-peptide/glycopeptide DNA co-condensates were examined following i. v. dosing in mice. Optimal targeting to hepatocytes was achieved by condensing 125 I-DNA with an add-mixture of 10 mol % triantennary glycopeptide, 5 mol % PEG-peptide, and 85 mol % <b>backbone</b> <b>peptide.</b> Four <b>backbone</b> <b>peptides</b> were substituted into the formulation to examine the influence of peptide metabolism and disulfide bond strength on the rate of DNA metabolism {{and the level of}} gene expression in vivo.

At this boundary in the precursor polyprotein, the most carboxy-terminal of the structural proteins, gp 70 (E 2), is proximal to the amino terminal of the nonstructural protein p 21 (NS 2). The presence of a novel microsomal membrane-dependent cleavage site was observed at the region upstream of the amino-terminal end of p 21 (NS 2) in the precursor polyprotein.

The results presented {{focus primarily on}} the use of beta- and gamma-residues in alphaomega sequences. The insertion of additional methylene groups into <b>peptide</b> <b>backbones</b> enhances the range of accessible conformations, introducing additional torsional variables. A nomenclature system, which permits ready comparisons between alpha-peptides and hybrid sequences, is defined. Crystal structure determination of hybrid peptides, which adopt helical and beta-hairpin conformations permits the characterization of backbone conformational parameters for beta- and gamma-residues inserted into regular alpha-polypeptide structures. Substituted beta- and gamma-residues are more limited in the range of accessible conformation than their unsubstituted counterparts.

The conformation in a native state thus determined may be elucidated by mutual interactions between {{atoms in the}} molecule. There are many proteins which exist in aggregated forms in vivo, and in vitro. These aggregations arise from interactions between unit molecules, and some of proteins show reversible polymerization-depolymerization phenomena with changes in their environ-ments. On a phenomenalogical point of view, these processes are treated by thermodynamics for systems which contain reacting molecules. As a result, the equilibrium constants seem to be factors that control association and dissociation. The forces responsible for intermolec-ular interactions to bind two or more protein molecules are nothing but those of intramolec-ular interactions.

We show an age dependent decrease in T-SH levels and increase in PCO and AOPPs level. The alterations in the levels of these parameters correlated significantly with the total antioxidant capacity of the plasma.

In contrast with the kidney, the liver enzyme is inducible by some xenobiotics, {{and its relationship to}} hepatic ontogeny and carcinogenesis seems to be important. Liver GGT polypeptides were identified by immunoblot analysis in subcellular fractions (rough endoplasmic reticulum, smooth endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi membranes and plasma membranes). Rat liver GGT appeared as a series of polypeptides corresponding to different maturation steps. Polypeptides related to the heavy subunit of GGT were detected in rough endoplasmic reticulum at 49, 53 and 55 kDa, and in Golgi membranes at 55, 60 and 66 kDa. Two polypeptides related to the light subunit of GGT were also observed in Golgi membranes. In plasma membranes GGT was composed of 100 kDa, 66 kDa and 31 kDa polypeptides. The 66 kDa component could correspond to the heavy subunit of the rat liver enzyme, and if so has a molecular mass higher than that of the purified rat kidney form of GGT (papain-treated).

The P 2 X 4 subtype of ATP-gated ion channel has in its C-terminus two putative endocytic motifs: a canonical YXXPhi motif and a non-canonical YXXGPhi motif (YEQGL). We demonstrate that endocytosis of P 2 X 4 receptors is mediated preferentially by the YXXGPhi motif because the YXXPhi motif is inaccessible to AP 2 owing {{to the structure of}} the channel. The crystal structure of a complex between residues 160 - 435 of the mu 2 subunit of AP 2 and a P 2 X 4 C-terminal peptide showed that the YEQGL motif binds to mu 2 at the same site as YXXPhi motifs. Y and Phi residues are accommodated in the same hydrophobic pockets in mu 2 with the extra residue between them being accommodated by changes in the <b>peptide's</b> <b>backbone</b> configuration, when compared to YXXPhi motifs.

Fibrin is required for efficient tPA-mediated plasmin generation and thereby stimulates its own proteolysis. Several fibrin regions can bind to tPA [1], but the structural basis for this interaction is unknown. Amyloid β (Aβ) is a peptide aggregate {{that is associated with}} neurotoxicity in brains afflicted with Alzheimer's disease [2]. Like fibrin, it stimulates tPA-mediated plasmin formation [3 – 5]. Intermolecular stacking of <b>peptide</b> <b>backbones</b> in β sheet conformation underlies cross-β structure in amyloid peptides [6]. We show here that fibrin-derived peptides adopt cross-β structure and form amyloid fibers. This correlates with tPA binding and stimulation of tPA-mediated plasminogen activation. Prototype amyloid peptides, including Aβ and islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) (associated with pancreatic β cell toxicity in type II diabetes [7]), have no sequence similarity to the fibrin peptides but also bind to tPA and can substitute for fibrin in plasminogen activation by tPA. Moreover, the induction of cross-β structure in an otherwise globular protein (endostatin) endows it with tPA-activating potential. Our results classify tPA as a multiligand receptor and show that cross-β structure is the common denominator in tPA binding ligands...|$|R

Even though they contain a minor {{fraction of the total}} protein, evidence suggests that they may serve as essential precursors for the nucleation of ordered solids such as crystals, sickle-cell hemoglobin polymers, and amyloid fibrils. The cluster formation mechanism remains elusive. We use the highly basic protein lysozyme at nearly neutral and lower pH as a model and explore the response of the cluster population to the electrostatic forces, which govern numerous biophysical phenomena, including crystallization and fibrillization. We tune the strength of intermolecular electrostatic forces by varying the solution ionic strength I and pH and find that despite the weaker repulsion at higher I and pH, the cluster size remains constant. Cluster responses to the presence of urea and ethanol demonstrate that cluster formation is controlled by hydrophobic interactions between the <b>peptide</b> <b>backbones,</b> exposed to the solvent after partial protein unfolding that may lead to transient protein oligomers. These findings reveal that the mechanism of the mesoscopic clusters is fundamentally different from those underlying the two main classes of ordered protein solid phases, crystals and amyloid fibrils, and partial unfolding of the protein chain may play a significant role...|$|R
