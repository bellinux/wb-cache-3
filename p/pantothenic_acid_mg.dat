The purpose of. {{the study was to}} establish optimum enzyme treatment for liberation and assay of <b>pantothenic</b> <b>acid</b> in blood and sera. There were eight major findings. First, it was found that there was an active pantetheinase in sera, negating the need for hog kidney peptidase or pigeon liver enzyme in whole blood. The second finding (related to the first) indicated that there was significant autolysis of the peptidase bond between the <b>pantothenic</b> <b>acid</b> and cysteamine moie- ties of coenzyme A in whole blood. The third finding was that Clarase (a monoesterase) liberated equivalent amounts of <b>pantothenic</b> <b>acid</b> in fresh whole blood when compared to alkaline phosphatase, but less in frozen blood. The optimum time for enzymatic liberation of <b>pantothenic</b> <b>acid</b> from whole blood was determined in the fourth. When using alkaline phosphatase alone, or alkaline phosphatase plus a pantetheinase, maximum liberation of <b>pantothenic</b> <b>acid</b> occurred at 4 to 5 hours. The fifth find-ing was that in sera, acid or base hydrolysis and boiling increased <b>pantothenic</b> <b>acid</b> liberation by approximately lQO nanograms over and above that liberated by enzyme treatment with alkaline phosphatase and hog kidney peptidase. In whole blood, both boiling and <b>acid</b> hydrolysis increased <b>pantothenic</b> <b>acid</b> liberation by approximately 100 nanograms; however, base hydrolysis did not yield a similar increase in <b>pantothenic</b> <b>acid.</b> In the sixth, it was found that substantial autolysis of bound forms of <b>pantothenic</b> <b>acid</b> (to liberate free <b>pantothenic</b> <b>acid)</b> occurred in fresh and frozen whole blood at 37 °C and 23 °C. The autolysis did not occur in sera or in boiled blood. The results from the seventh finding indicated that blood frozen for 15 months showed less bound (released by alkaline phosphatase plus hog kidney peptidase) <b>pantothenic</b> <b>acid</b> and a greater amount of free <b>pantothenic</b> <b>acid</b> than did fresh blood. The eighth was actually a series of findings in which it was established that a protease digestion of whole blood with trypsin, chymotrypsin, papain, or pepsin increased <b>pantothenic</b> <b>acid</b> liberation from whole blood.
