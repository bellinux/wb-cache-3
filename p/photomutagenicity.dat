50|$|<b>Photomutagenicity</b> is the {{property}} of being photomutagenic, in that when irradiated by visible or UV light, a photomutagenic chemical substance (e.g., umbelliferone) - found in or on an organism - can cause mutation(s) of that particular organism. Other substances include furocoumarins and limettin.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} the <b>photomutagenicity</b> of maltol (3 -hydroxy- 2 -methyl- 4 H-pyran- 4 -one) in bacterial cells. Maltol has a caramel-butterscotch odour {{and is used}} as a food additive to impart flavour to bread and cakes. Unirradiated maltol was not mutagenic up to 5 mg/plate in the Ames test. When maltol was irradiated with either UVA (a black light, 320 – 400 nm, 230 mW/cm 2) for 5 – 30 min or UVC (a germicidal lamp, 610 mW/cm 2) for 3 min in sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7. 4) prior to the exposure of bacterial cells, it was mutagenic to Salmonella typhimurium TA 100, TA 104 and TA 97. Mutagenic activation of maltol by UVA-irradiation was more evident in neutral and alkaline conditions (pH 7. 0 – 9. 0) than in acidic conditions. On the other hand, <b>photomutagenicity</b> was not observed when maltol was irradiated with UVA in 100 mM NaCl solution or water. The mutagenic photoproduct was stable for at least 60 min after UVA-irradiation. However, addition of thiol compounds (cysteine or glutathione) to the UVA-irradiated maltol diminished the mutagenicity. Mutational spectrum analysis revealed that the pre-dominant base-substitutions induced were G:C!T:A transversions and G:C!A:T transitions. An increase of 8 -hydroxydeoxyguanosine formation in salmon sperm DNA exposed to maltol and UVA in vitro was detected by HPLC-ECD, but it was too small to explain the <b>photomutagenicity.</b> We are considering the formation of DNA adducts as the photomutagenic mechanism...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: DMBA, 7, 12 -dimethylbenz[a]anthracene, is {{a widely}} studied {{polycyclic}} aromatic hydrocarbon {{that has long been}} recognized as a probable human carcinogen. It has been found that DMBA is phototoxic in bacteria as well as in animal or human cells and photomutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium strain TA 102. This article tempts to explain the photochemistry and <b>photomutagenicity</b> mechanism. Light irradiation converts DMBA into several photoproducts including benz[a]anthracene- 7, 12 -dione, 7 -hydroxy- 12 -keto- 7 -methylbenz[a]anthracene, 7, 12 -epidioxy- 7, 12 -dihydro-DMBA, 7 -hydroxymethyl- 12 -methylbenz[a]anthracene and 12 -hydroxymethyl- 7 -methylbenz[a]anthracene. Structures of these photoproducts have been identified by either comparison with authentic samples or by NMR/MS. At least four other photoproducts need to be assigned. Photo-irradiation of DMBA in the presence of calf thymus DNA was similarly conducted and light-induced DMBA-DNA adducts were analyzed by 32 P-postlabeling/TLC, which indicates that multiple DNA adducts were formed. This indicates that formation of DNA adducts might be the source of <b>photomutagenicity</b> of DMBA. Metabolites obtained from the metabolism of DMBA by rat liver microsomes were reacted with calf thymus DNA and the resulting DNA adducts were analyzed by 32 P-postlabeling/TLC under identical conditions. Comparison of the DNA adduct profiles indicates that the DNA adducts formed from photo-irradiation are different from the DNA adducts formed due to the reaction of DMBA metabolites with DNA. These results suggest that photo-irradiation of DMBA ca...|$|E

40|$|Nanometer-sized gold, {{due to its}} {{beautiful}} and bountiful color and unique optical properties, is a versatile material for many industrial and societal applications. We have studied the effect of gold nanoparticles on Salmonella typhimurium strain TA 102. The gold nanoparticles in solution prepared using the citrate reduction method is found not to be toxic or mutagenic but photomutagenic to the bacteria; however, careful control experiments indicate that the <b>photomutagenicity</b> {{is due to the}} co-existing citrate and Au 3 þ ions, not due to the gold nanoparticle itself. Au 3 þ is also found to be photomutagenic to the bacteria at concentrations lower than 1 mM, but toxic at higher concentrations. The toxicity of Au 3 þ is enhanced by light irradiation. The photo-mutagenicity of both citrate and Au 3 þ is likely due to the formation of free radicals, as a result of light-induced citrate decarboxylation or Au 3 þ oxidation of co-existing molecules. Both processes can generate free radicals that may cause DNA damage and mutation. Studies of the interaction of gold nanoparticles with the bacteria indicate that gold nanoparticles can be absorbed onto the bacteria surface but not able to penetrate the bacteria wall to enter the bacteria...|$|E
40|$|Retinyl palmitate (RP), {{a storage}} form of vitamin A, is {{frequently}} {{used as a}} cosmetic ingredient, with more than 700 RP-containing cosmetic products on the U. S. market in 2004. There are concerns for the possible genotoxicity and carcinogenicity of RP when it is exposed to sunlight. To evaluate the <b>photomutagenicity</b> of RP in cells when exposed to ultraviolet A (UVA) light, L 5178 Y/Tk+/ mouse lymphoma cells were treated with different doses of RP alone/or {{in the presence of}} UVA light. Treatment of the cells with RP alone at the dose range of 25 – 100 mg/ml did not increase mutant frequencies (MFs) over the negative control, whereas treatment of cells with 1 – 25 mg/ml RP under UVA light (82. 8 mJ/cm 2 /min for 30 min) produced a dose-dependent mutation induction. The mean induced MF (392 3 106) for treatment with 25 mg/ml RP under UVA exposure was about threefold higher than that for UVA alone (122 3 106), a synergistic effect. To elucidate the underlying mechanism of action, we examined the mutants for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at four microsatellite loci spanning the entire chromosome 11, on which the Tk gene is located. The mutational spectrum for the RP + UVA treatment was significantly different from the negative control, but not significantly different from UVA exposure alone. Ninety four percent of the mutants from RP + UVA treatment lost the Tk+ allele, and 91 % of the deleted sequences extended more than 6 cM in chromosome length, indicating clastogenic events affecting {{a large segment of the}} chromosome. These results suggest that RP is photomutagenic in combination with UVA exposure in mouse lymphoma cells, with a clastogenic mode-of-action.
