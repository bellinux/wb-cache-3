5|$|If a Poisson <b>process</b> <b>is</b> defined with {{a single}} {{positive}} constant, then the <b>process</b> <b>is</b> called a homogeneous Poisson process. The homogeneous Poisson process (in continuous time) {{is a member of}} important classes of stochastic processes such as Markov processes and Lévy processes.|$|E
5|$|If {{the state}} space is the {{integers}} or natural numbers, then the stochastic <b>process</b> <b>is</b> called a discrete or integer-valued stochastic process. If the state space {{is the real}} line, then the stochastic <b>process</b> <b>is</b> {{referred to as a}} real-valued stochastic process or a process with continuous state space. If the state space is -dimensional Euclidean space, then the stochastic <b>process</b> <b>is</b> called a -dimensional vector process or -vector process.|$|E
5|$|The {{homogeneous}} Poisson {{process can}} be defined and generalized in different ways. It can be defined such that its index set is the real line, and this stochastic <b>process</b> <b>is</b> also called the stationary Poisson process. If the parameter constant of the Poisson <b>process</b> <b>is</b> replaced with some non-negative integrable function of , the resulting <b>process</b> <b>is</b> called an inhomogeneous or nonhomogeneous Poisson process, where the average density of points of the <b>process</b> <b>is</b> no longer constant. Serving as a fundamental process in queueing theory, the Poisson <b>process</b> <b>is</b> an important process for mathematical models, where it finds applications for models of events randomly occurring in certain time windows.|$|E
40|$|A new {{structure}} {{with the special}} property that an instantaneous reflection barrier is imposed on the ordinary birth-death <b>processes</b> <b>is</b> considered. An easy-checking criterion {{for the existence of}} such Markov <b>processes</b> <b>is</b> first obtained. The uniqueness criterion is then established. In the nonunique case, all the honest <b>processes</b> <b>are</b> explicitly constructed. Ergodicity properties for these <b>processes</b> <b>are</b> investigated. It is proved that honest <b>processes</b> <b>are</b> always ergodic without necessarily imposing any extra conditions. Equilibrium distributions for all these ergodic <b>processes</b> <b>are</b> established. Several examples are provided to illustrate our results...|$|R
50|$|The {{long-term}} scheduler, or admission scheduler, decides which jobs or <b>processes</b> <b>are</b> to {{be admitted}} to the ready queue (in main memory); that is, when an attempt is made to execute a program, its admission to the set of currently executing <b>processes</b> <b>is</b> either authorized or delayed by the long-term scheduler. Thus, this scheduler dictates what <b>processes</b> <b>are</b> to run on a system, and the degree of concurrency to be supported at any one time whether many or few <b>processes</b> <b>are</b> to be executed concurrently, and how the split between I/O-intensive and CPU-intensive <b>processes</b> <b>is</b> to be handled. The long-term scheduler is responsible for controlling the degree of multiprogramming.|$|R

5|$|After {{the cloth}} is dry, the resist is removed by boiling or {{scraping}} the cloth. The areas treated with resist keep their original colour; when the resist is removed {{the contrast between}} the dyed and undyed areas forms the pattern.

5|$|All {{citizens}} of Canada, {{as well as}} corporate bodies, may petition the Crown for an award of arms. For an individual to obtain a grant of arms, a petition must {{be sent to the}} Chief Herald, providing a biography, references, and completed application forms. If the grant is approved, the individual then consults with heralds from the Authority to work out the design of their award. Upon completion of this process, the grant documents, in the form of letters patent, are created and provided to the grantee. The entire <b>process</b> <b>is</b> subject to certain fees required by the Government of Canada to cover costs of research and artwork; the fees are not to purchase the grant of arms. For corporations and institutions the <b>process</b> <b>is</b> similar.|$|E

5|$|Biofuels are fuels {{derived from}} biomass {{conversion}}, {{as in the}} conversion of cellulose contained in corn stalks, switchgrass, and other biomass into cellulosic ethanol.

5|$|Dactyl shares many {{characteristics}} with Ida. Their albedos {{and reflection}} spectra are very similar. The small differences {{indicate that the}} space weathering <b>process</b> <b>is</b> less active on Dactyl. Its small size would make the formation of significant amounts of regolith impossible.
