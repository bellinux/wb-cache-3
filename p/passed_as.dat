Stanton, Anthony, and Truth were joined by Matilda Joslyn Gage, who later worked on The Woman's Bible with Stanton. Despite Stanton's position and the efforts of her and others to expand the Fifteenth Amendment to include voting rights for all women, this amendment also <b>passed,</b> <b>as</b> it was originally written, in 1870.|$|E

40|$|In this article, I examine racial {{narratives}} of passing {{and their relationship}} to discourses of hybridity. Rather than defining <b>passing</b> <b>as</b> inherently transgressive, or as one side of identity politics or the other, I suggest that passing must be understood in relationship to forms of social antagonism. I ask the following questions: how are differences that threaten the system recuperated? How do ambiguous or hybrid bodies get read in a way which further supports the enunciative power of those who are telling the difference? In what ways is `passing' implicated in the very discourse around tellable differences? Although to some extent all identities involve <b>passing</b> - insofar <b>as</b> the subject never `is' what it `images' itself to be - we still need to theorize the differences between <b>passing</b> <b>as</b> white and <b>passing</b> <b>as</b> black. I argue that <b>passing</b> <b>as</b> black as a white subject can function as a technique of knowledge which assumes `blackness' to be imageable and hence beable. However, for black subjects to refuse to <b>pass</b> <b>as</b> white - that is, for black subjects to <b>pass</b> <b>as</b> black - can make visible the violent histories concealed by the invisibility of the mark of passing. Such a process of <b>passing</b> <b>as</b> black subjects is tied to a politics of the collective - a coming together through the recognition of the lack that engenders passing in the first place...|$|R
5|$|However, {{the tenure}} of the Justice Party {{government}} of the Raja of Panagal is largely remembered for the introduction of caste-based reservations in 1921. In August 1921, the First communal Government Order (G.O.

40|$|Graduation date: 2011 Biracial and Multiracial {{people are}} {{one of the fastest growing}} racial groups in the United States. Individuals with a mixed {{identity}} have the ability to choose endless racial/ethnic designations that best exemplify their racial/ethnic social identity. However, people who are racially/ethnically mixed may receive criticism if their proclaimed identity does not coincide with the societal perceptions of their racial/ethnic identity. People who identify with more than one race or ethnicity and have White ancestry can be perceived as White by society. Therefore, Biracial and Multiracial people have the ability to <b>pass</b> <b>as</b> White if they have White ancestry and appear White. This study explored racially/ethnically mixed peoples' perceptions of <b>passing</b> <b>as</b> White. Qualitative surveys were conducted to find if Biracial and Multiracial people thought they could <b>pass</b> <b>as</b> White. When Biracial and Multiracial people have the ability to <b>pass</b> <b>as</b> White, they are associated with the White group. Association with the White group equates to being afforded advantages and benefits. Thus, White privilege may be afforded to racially/ethnically mixed people who <b>pass</b> <b>as</b> White. Qualitative interviews were used to explore if Biracial and Multiracial people identified with having White privilege. The research also examined the connection between Multiracial/ethnic people who can <b>pass</b> <b>as</b> White and White privilege. Findings suggest racially/ethnically people who can <b>pass</b> <b>as</b> White identified with having White privilege. Moreover, participants and a research team evaluation identified factors that contribute to <b>passing</b> <b>as</b> White. The findings presented in this study are significant as it explores the intersection between Biracial and Multiracial identity, <b>passing</b> <b>as</b> White, and White privilege. The information presented in this study implies that the phenomenon of passing is an important concept toward social justice and racial equity...|$|R

50|$|In Caucasia, the {{identity}} category of race is presented {{by raising the}} question: Who is passing for what? Passing is a term associated {{to someone who is}} not legally White but <b>passes</b> <b>as</b> White, facilitating their ability to assimilate in White culture. In Caucasia, several characters experience a loss of racial identity and the denial of self with the intention of gaining social acceptance. While Cole denounces her White heritage and <b>passes</b> <b>as</b> Black and Sandy resists the idea of <b>passing</b> <b>as</b> a wasp, Birdie {{is one of the main}} characters who experiences a complete disassociation with anything that would indicate a connection to her blackness. Consequently, Birdie is able to <b>pass</b> <b>as</b> a Jewish after her mother forces both of them to runaway.|$|R
5|$|The hurricane's intense winds, waves, {{rains and}} storm surge were {{responsible}} for at least 45deaths across ten countries and caused estimated damages of US$1.66billion. First impacting the islands of the Lesser Antilles, Dean's path through the Caribbean devastated agricultural crops, particularly those of Martinique and Jamaica. Upon reaching Mexico, Hurricane Dean was a Category5 storm, but it missed major population centers and its exceptional Category5 strength landfall caused no deaths and less damage than in the Caribbean islands it <b>passed</b> <b>as</b> a Category2 storm.|$|E
5|$|Though {{research}} suggests William Edward White {{was the first}} African-American baseball player in MLB, unlike White who <b>passed</b> <b>as</b> a white man, Walker was open about his black heritage, and often faced racial bigotry prevalent in the late 19th century. His brother, Weldy, became the second black athlete to do so later in the same year, also for the Toledo ball club. Walker played just one season, 42 games total, for Toledo before injuries entailed his release.|$|E
5|$|At {{about this}} time, Yūnagi {{detached}} from the Japanese column and reversed direction, perhaps because she {{lost sight of the}} other Japanese ships ahead of her, or perhaps she was ordered to provide a rearguard for Mikawa's force. One minute later, Japanese lookouts sighted a warship to port. This ship was the destroyer , heavily damaged the day before and now departing Guadalcanal independently for repairs in Australia. Whether Jarvis sighted the Japanese ships is unknown, since her radios had been destroyed. Furutaka launched torpedoes at Jarvis, which all missed. The Japanese ships <b>passed</b> <b>as</b> close to Jarvis as 1,100 meters, close enough for officers on Tenryū to look down onto the destroyer's decks without seeing any of her crew moving about. If Jarvis was aware of the Japanese ships passing by, she did not respond in any noticeable way.|$|E

5|$|Cleveland's {{defiance}} of political corruption won him popular acclaim, and the enmity of the influential Tammany Hall organization in New York City. Tammany, under its boss, John Kelly, had disapproved of Cleveland's nomination as governor, and their resistance intensified after Cleveland openly opposed and prevented the re-election of their point {{man in the}} State Senate, Thomas F. Grady. Cleveland also steadfastly opposed nominees of the Tammanyites, as well as bills <b>passed</b> <b>as</b> {{a result of their}} deal making. The loss of Tammany's support was offset by the support of Theodore Roosevelt and other reform-minded Republicans who helped Cleveland to pass several laws reforming municipal governments.|$|E
5|$|Cochrane {{establishes}} {{the book as}} a work of normative political theory asking to what extent animals {{should be included in the}} domain of justice. States can and do regulate human-animal relationships, whether the animals in question are used in agriculture, as companions, or in some other way. Cochrane's focus is not on why laws are passed or on comparing laws, but in exploring what kind of laws should be <b>passed.</b> <b>As</b> his focus is on political theory, he is less concerned with questions about individual moral obligations than he is with institutional arrangements. He notes, however, that questions about animals have been neglected in political theory. In the second chapter, Cochrane considers the history of thinking on the relationship between justice and animals. He argues that within ancient philosophy there was disagreement about the inclusion of animals within accounts of justice, in medieval Christian philosophy there was a consensus that they should be excluded, and in modern philosophy there has been a return to disagreement.|$|E
5|$|Concerns {{about the}} {{proposed}} measure—particularly its {{denial of the}} right to appeal—were voiced by the UK, US, and Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace. The US, UK, IMF, and World Bank threatened that if Zimbabwe implemented the law, it would forfeit foreign aid packages. Responding to the criticisms, the government removed the ban on court appeals from the bill, which was then <b>passed</b> <b>as</b> law. Over the following few years, hundreds of thousands of acres of largely white-owned land were expropriated. In April 1994, a newspaper investigation found that not all of this was redistributed to landless blacks; much of the expropriated land was being leased to ministers and senior officials such as Witness Mangwede, who was leased a 3000-acre farm in Hwedza. Responding to this scandal, in 1994 the UK government—which had supplied £44 million for land redistribution—halted its payments.|$|E

5|$|Dynamic {{balance is}} {{provided}} through the three semicircular canals. These three canals are orthogonal (at right angles) to each other. At {{the end of}} each canal is a slight enlargement, known as the ampulla, which contains numerous cells with filaments in a central area called the cupula. The fluid in these canals rotates according to the momentum of the head. When a person changes acceleration, the inertia of the fluid changes. This affects the pressure on the cupula, and results in the opening of ion channels. This causes depolarisation, which is <b>passed</b> <b>as</b> a signal to the brain along the vestibulocochlear nerve. Dynamic balance also helps maintain eye tracking when moving, via the vestibulo–ocular reflex.|$|E

Two of his pupils included the future ace and 56 Squadron colleague Geoffrey Hilton Bowman and Mick Mannock.

5|$|Stanisław August Poniatowski, King of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, was the {{commander-in-chief}} of the Polish forces, {{but in practice}} he delegated this position to his nephew, Prince Józef Poniatowski. Poniatowski had in theory at his disposal a 48,000 strong Crown army and the Lithuanian army more than half that size to confront them. In practice, Polish forces, still forming following the reforms of the Constitution of 3 May (which specified an army size of 100,000) numbered only 37,000.

5|$|The Act, finally <b>passed</b> <b>as</b> the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873, merged the Common Pleas, Exchequer, King's Bench and Court of Chancery {{into one}} body, the High Court of Justice, with the {{divisions}} between {{the courts to}} remain. The Court of Common Pleas thus ceased to exist, except as the Common Pleas Division of the High Court. The existence of the same courts under one unified head was a quirk of constitutional law, which prevented the compulsory demotion or retirement of Chief Justices. By sheer chance, both the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales and Chief Baron of the Exchequer died in 1880, allowing for {{the abolition of the}} Common Pleas Division and Exchequer Division by Order in Council on 16 December 1880, with their functions merged into the King's Bench Division, with the Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas becoming Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales.|$|E

Among the French prisoners, were discovered 12 deserters from the British Army or Royal Navy (at least 40 successfully <b>passed</b> <b>as</b> Frenchmen and were repatriated to France). These 12 were put on trial on their return to Britain: two were later hanged and five transported. Rewards were forthcoming, particularly for Bertie, who was made a baronet. This created a scandal when Admiral Drury accused Bertie of taking credit for the work of others (principally Drury himself).
