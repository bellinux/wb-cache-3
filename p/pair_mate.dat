50|$|Suckermouth minnows spawn {{in groups}} {{in late spring}} or early summer. Once the female lays her 200 to 500 eggs {{there seems to be}} no parental care. The water {{temperature}} during spawning periods is between 14 and 25 degrees Celsius. The mating system that these minnows use is polygynandrous (promiscuous), they mate with many females and males to reassure reproductive success. There are a few that have been said to <b>pair</b> <b>mate</b> but male testes are said to be larger in group spawning, suggesting group spawning or polygynandrous is the main mating system. Sexual size dimorphism varies among these two mating systems. Since most of the female suckermouths mate with many males and are iteroparous, she lays small batches of eggs throughout her spawning period, probably to allow greater survivorship among developing embryos.|$|E

50|$|Pheromonal {{suppression}} of subordinate {{male and female}} reproduction is implicated as the mechanism by which dominant breeding pairs suppress the reproduction of non-breeders in communally and cooperatively breeding species, especially {{in the absence of}} stress as an explanation. Wolves (Canis lupus), coyotes (Canis latrons) and hunting dogs (Lycaon pictus) live in packs with a dominant breeding pair that does most of the territorial urine scent marking in the group. During the breeding season the dominant male urinates over the dominant female's urine, possibly to hide the female's reproductive status from other males. Pheromones in urine are implicated as a possible mechanism to shut down the subordinate's reproductive cycle. Only the dominant <b>pair</b> <b>mate</b> and have young, producing one litter per year. Subordinate females either do not exhibit estrous hormonal changes or they occur irregularly. Occasionally a subordinate animal leaves the pack and forms a new mating pair when it then exhibits of the territorial urine marking and mating behavior that was suppressed when living {{in the presence of the}} dominant breeding pair.|$|E

40|$|Social monogamy at {{its most}} basic is a group {{structure}} in which two adults form a unit and share a territory. However, many socially monogamous pairs display attachment relationships known as pair bonds, {{in which there is a}} mutual preference for the partner and distress upon separation. The neural and hormonal basis of this response to separation from the adult <b>pair</b> <b>mate</b> is under-studied. In this project, we examined this response in male titi monkeys (Callicebus cupreus), a socially monogamous New World primate. Males underwent a baseline scan, a short separation (48 hours), a long separation (app. two weeks), a reunion with the female <b>pair</b> <b>mate,</b> and an encounter with a female stranger (with nine males completing all five conditions). Regional cerebral glucose metabolism was measured via positron emission tomography (PET) imaging using 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) co-registered with structural MRI, and region of interest analysis was carried out. In addition, plasma was collected and assayed for cortisol, oxytocin (OT), vasopressin (AVP), glucose, and insulin concentrations. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was collected and assayed for OT and AVP. We used generalized estimating equations to examine significant changes from baseline. Short separations were characterized by decreases in FDG uptake, in comparison to baseline, in the lateral septum (LS), ventral pallidum (VP), paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), periaqueductal gray (PAG), and cerebellum, as well as increases in CSF OT, and plasma cortisol and insulin. Long separations differed from baseline in reduced FDG uptake in the central amygdala (CeA), reduced whole brain FDG uptake, increased CSF OT and increased plasma insulin. The response on encounter with a stranger female depended on whether or not the male had previously reproduced with his <b>pair</b> <b>mate,</b> suggesting that transitions to fatherhood contribute to the neurobiology underlying response to a novel female. Reunion with the partner appeared to stimulate coordinated release of central and peripheral OT. The observed changes suggest the involvement of OT and AVP systems, as well as limbic and striatal areas, during separation and reunion from the <b>pair</b> <b>mate...</b>|$|E

When a sufficient multiplicity of infection (MOI) was used, the f 1 phage immediately and completely inhibited the formation of <b>mating</b> <b>pairs.</b> On the other hand, the MS 2 phage at a relatively high MOI also inhibited the formation of <b>mating</b> <b>pairs</b> significantly although not completey. The inhibitory effect of MS 2 phage was dependent {{on the time of}} addition and the MOI used. At relatively low MOI (400) MS 2 phage disrupted the <b>mating</b> <b>pairs</b> already formed.

We conclude that the tip of an F pilus is the specific attachment site for mating. The following process of <b>mating</b> <b>pair</b> formation has been formulated by deduction. (i) The sides of F pili weakly contact female cells, (ii) then the tips of F pili attach to the specific receptor sites to form initial <b>mating</b> <b>pairs,</b> and (iii) those <b>pairs</b> mature into <b>mating</b> <b>pairs</b> that are resistant to the high MOI of MS 2 phages.

40|$|Understanding the {{neurobiology}} {{of social}} bonding in non-human primates {{is a critical}} step in understanding the evolution of monogamy, as well as understanding the neural substrates for emotion and behavior. Coppery titi monkeys (Callicebus cupreus) form strong pair bonds, characterized by selective preference for their <b>pair</b> <b>mate,</b> mate-guarding, physiological and behavioral agitation upon separation, and social buffering. Mate-guarding, or the “maintenance” phase of pair bonding, is relatively under-studied in primates. In the current study, we used functional imaging to examine how male titi monkeys viewing their <b>pair</b> <b>mate</b> {{in close proximity to}} a stranger male would change regional cerebral glucose metabolism. We predicted that this situation would challenge the pair bond and induce “jealousy” in the males. Animals were injected with [18 F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), returned to their cage for 30 min of conscious uptake, placed under anesthesia, and then scanned for 1 h on a microPET P 4 scanner. During the FDG uptake, males (n = 8) had a view of either their female <b>pair</b> <b>mate</b> next to a stranger male (“jealousy” condition) or a stranger female next to a stranger male (control condition). Blood and cerebrospinal fluid samples were collected and assayed for testosterone, cortisol, oxytocin, and vasopressin. Positron emission tomography (PET) was co-registered with structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and region of interest analysis was carried out. Bayesian multivariate multilevel analyses found that the right lateral septum (Pr(b > 0) = 93 %), left posterior cingulate cortex (Pr(b > 0) = 99 %), and left anterior cingulate (Pr(b > 0) = 96 %) showed higher FDG uptake in the jealousy condition compared to the control condition, while the right medial amygdala (Pr(b > 0) = 85 %) showed lower FDG uptake. Plasma testosterone and cortisol concentrations were higher during the jealousy condition. During the jealousy condition, duration of time spent looking across at the <b>pair</b> <b>mate</b> next to a stranger male was associated with higher plasma cortisol concentrations. The lateral septum {{has been shown to be}} involved in mate-guarding and mating-induced aggression in monogamous rodents, while the cingulate cortex has been linked to territoriality. These neural and physiological changes may underpin the emotion of jealousy, which can act in a monogamous species to preserve the long-term integrity of the pair...|$|E

40|$|Laboratory {{primates}} {{are often}} housed in same-sex pairs to avoid single-housing and when breeding {{is to be}} prevented. However, pair formation is not without risks, as fights and injuries may occur. No data are available on pair formation in female common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus), a species used extensively in laboratories. Therefore, this study focuses on the pairing of unfamiliar common marmoset females, aiming to assess its success rate and whether age can predict the result. Data on the study animals and success of the pairings were extracted from laboratory back-records: a total of 28 pairings was obtained. In addition, behavioural data were collected on six of the 28 pairs. Almost 80 % of pairs were compatible beyond one week, {{and most of the}} fights occurred well within the first week after pair formation. Pairs in which one of the females was sexually immature (ie < 15 months) were significantly more compatible than pairs in which both females were post-pubertal. First encounters were characterised by sniffing of the unfamiliar monkey. Aggressive behaviours occurred frequently following pair formation but they were unidirectional, and in only two pairs was veterinary treatment required. This study shows that pairing of unfamiliar common marmoset females is a safe practice if one monkey is sexually immature, a result that supports observations of both group and pair formation in other primate species. However, given the potentially detrimental effects of removing young females from their natal groups, we argue that it is preferable to remove two sisters from their natal group when female pairs are required. However, when a single sexually mature female requires a <b>pair</b> <b>mate</b> so as to avoid single-housing and no mature sibling is available, an older, but still sexually immature, unfamiliar female that has had a normal development within the family should be considered as a <b>pair</b> <b>mate...</b>|$|E

Some participants predicted whether the dot would appear before seeing the outcome, whereas other participants were required to respond quickly if the dot appeared shortly after the display. In the prediction task, instructions guiding participants to infer which objects caused the dot to appear were necessary in order for contingencies associated with one object to influence participants ’ predictions about the object with which it had been paired. In the response task, contingencies associated with one object affected responses to its <b>pair</b> <b>mate</b> irrespective of whether or not participants were given causal instructions.

40|$|Membrane fusion {{requires}} localized destabilization of two phospholipid bilayers, but unrestrained membrane destabilization {{could result}} in lysis. prm 1 mutant yeast cells have a defect at the plasma membrane fusion stage of mating that typically results in the accumulation of prezygotes that have fingers of membrane-bound cytoplasm projecting from one cell of each <b>pair</b> into its <b>mating</b> partner {{in the direction of}} the osmotic gradient between the cells. However, some prm 1 <b>mating</b> <b>pairs</b> fuse successfully whereas the two cells in other prm 1 <b>mating</b> <b>pairs</b> simultaneously lyse. Lysis only occurs if both mating partners are prm 1 mutants. Osmotic stabilization does not protect prm 1 <b>mating</b> <b>pairs</b> from lysis, indicating that lysis is not caused by a cell wall defect. prm 1 <b>mating</b> <b>pairs</b> without functional mitochondria still lyse, ruling out programmed cell death. No excess lysis was found after pheromone treatment of haploid prm 1 cells, and lysis did not occur in <b>mating</b> <b>pairs</b> when prm 1 was combined with the fus 1 and fus 2 mutations to block cell wall remodeling. Furthermore, short (< 1 μm) cytoplasmic microfingers indicating the completion of cell wall remodeling appeared immediately before lysis.

The present study of the clonal herb Sedum album assessed direct and indirect genetic effects on performance-related traits in a 4 -year experiment with clonally replicated genotypes, grown in pairs and differing in anthocyanin pigmentation to allow separation of individuals during data collection. In agreement with the existence of indirect genetic effects, the experimentally-paired plants not only expressed their own genotype but were also affected by the genotype of their <b>pair</b> <b>mate.</b> The effect of neighbour genotype explained up to one-fourth {{of the variation in}} performance and most likely resulted from competition, imposed by the close physical contact between paired individuals and the limiting conditions used in the garden environment.

40|$|Extra-pair {{paternity}} has {{the potential}} to increase male reproductive success and in turn the potential for sexual selection to act on male traits predicting extra <b>pair</b> <b>mate</b> success. There is large variation among European populations of pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) in the extent to which male traits predict success in extra pair mating behaviour. In an Iberian population with a relatively high proportion of extra-pair young multiple male traits were involved in extra pair paternity success. Cuckolder males had larger tarsi and more attractive sex ornaments (blacker dorsal plumage and larger forehead patches) than the individuals they cuckolded, results not replicated in other populations. Previous studies in the species have shown that all traits associated with achieving success in extra pair paternity in our population are heritable and likely reliable indicators of male quality. Siring additional young was an advantageous strategy for males as it did not imply loss of paternity in their own nests. Our results, thus, suggest that this behaviour may enhance the evolution of male traits associated to success in extra-pair paternity in this population.

40|$|SummarySocial {{relationships}} are fundamental to animals living in complex societies [1 – 3]. The {{extent to which}} individuals base their decisions around their key social relationships, and the consequences this has on their behavior and broader population level processes, remains unknown. Using a novel experiment that controlled where individual wild birds (great tits, Parus major) could access food, we restricted mated pairs from being allowed to forage at the same locations. This introduced a conflict for pair members between maintaining social relationships and accessing resources. We show that individuals reduce their own access to food in order to sustain their relationships and that individual foraging activity was strongly influenced by their key social counterparts. By affecting where individuals go, social relationships determined which conspecifics they encountered and consequently shaped their other social associations. Hence, while resource distribution can determine individuals’ spatial and social environment [4 – 8], we illustrate how key social relationships themselves can govern broader social structure. Finally, social relationships also influenced the development of social foraging strategies. In response to forgoing access to resources, maintaining pair bonds led individuals to develop a flexible “scrounging” strategy, particularly by scrounging from their <b>pair</b> <b>mate.</b> This suggests that behavioral plasticity can develop to ameliorate conflicts between social relationships and other demands. Together, these results illustrate the importance of considering social relationships for explaining behavioral variation due to their significant impact on individual behavior and demonstrate the consequences of key relationships for wider processes...|$|E

40|$|Partner preference, or the {{selective}} social {{preference for a}} <b>pair</b> <b>mate,</b> is a key behavioral indicator of social monogamy. Standardized partner preference testing has been used extensively in rodents but a single test has not been standardized for primates. The goal {{of this study was}} to develop a partner preference test with socially monogamous titi monkeys (Callicebus cupreus) adapted from the widely used rodent test. In Experiment 1, we evaluated the test with pairs of titi monkeys (N[*]=[*] 12) in a three-chambered apparatus for 3 [*]hr. The subject was placed in the middle chamber, with grated windows separating it from its partner on one side and an opposite sex stranger on the other side. Subjects spent a greater proportion of time in proximity to their partners' windows than the strangers', indicating a consistent preference for the partner over the stranger. Touching either window did not differ between partners and strangers, suggesting it was not a reliable measure of partner preference. Subjects chose their partner more than the stranger during catch and release sessions at the end of the test. In Experiment 2, we compared responses of females with current partners (N[*]=[*] 12) in the preference test with other relationship types representing former attachment bonds (N[*]=[*] 13) and no attachment bond (N[*]=[*] 8). Only females from established pair bonds spent significantly more time near their partner's window compared to the stranger's indicating that this measure of preference was unique to current partners. Other measures of preference did not differentiate behavior toward a current partner and other relationship types. This test reproduces behavioral patterns found in previous studies in titi monkeys highlighting the accuracy of this new partner preference test. This test can be used as a standardized measure of partner preference in titi monkeys to quantitatively study pair bonding and evaluate factors influencing partner preference. Am. J.
