50|$|The primary {{drawback}} to the revolving cylinder, {{axial piston engine}} design is that rotating <b>piston</b> <b>assemblies</b> are subjected to centrifugal forces, which can result in significant friction losses. These centrifugal forces increase at {{the square of the}} angular velocity. So unless the engine is run at very low rotational speeds, the friction losses due to centrifugal forces acting on the <b>piston</b> <b>assemblies</b> can quickly become unacceptable.|$|R

A true triaxial apparatus {{was designed and}} fabricated to apply mechanical loading to achieve multi-axial stress states. The University of Minnesota plane strain apparatus was equipped with <b>piston</b> <b>assemblies</b> that generated intermediate principal stress σ_II up to 100 MPa. The minor principal stress σ_III was limited by the pressure vessel to 24 MPa and the major principal stress σ_I was applied by a closed-loop, servo-hydraulic load frame. Calibration tests were conducted on an isotropic, linear elastic material (aluminum 6061) to confirm {{the performance of the}} <b>piston</b> <b>assemblies.</b> Results from strength testing of Dunnville sandstone under multi-axial stress states were used to evaluate the Mohr-Coulomb (MC), Hoek-Brown (HB), and Paul-Mohr-Coulomb (PMC) failure criteria. A series of conventional triaxial compression (σ_II=σ_III) and extension (σ_I=σ_II) experiments were performed to evaluate the necessary material parameters for each failure criterion. The true triaxial apparatus was used to conduct experiments under various states of stress (σ_I≠σ_II≠σ_III) at constant mean stress (p=(σ_I+σ_II+σ_III) / 3) of 28. 3 and 56. 0 MPa. The three criteria were compared in principal stress space on a plane normal to the hydrostatic axis called the pi-plane. Even though MC and HB are independent of σ_II, the stress states at failure were reasonably predicted at p = 28. 3 MPa. This was not the case at p = 56. 0 MPa, and a plane fitting method using a failure criterion such as PMC that includes σ_II may be needed...|$|R

The first material is one (e. g., a liquid crystal elastomer) that undergoes a stiffness change and/or a dimensional change when subjected to a temperature change in the temperature range of interest. When subjected to the temperature change while in the housing, the first material is restricted to changing dimensionally along a single dimension. The second material retains its shape and size throughout the temperature range of interest. As a result, the plug moves in the housing in correspondence with the dimensional change of the first material or the plug's movement is damped by the stiffness change of the first material...|$|R

5000|$|Setting {{tools are}} used to set {{downhole}} completion elements such as production packers or bridge plugs.

Most completion packers or plugs have a specially designed shear mechanism which release the setting tool from the element allowing it to be retrieved back to surface. The packer/plug however, remains down hole as a barrier to isolate production zones or permanently plug off a well bore.|$|E

Magnetic support of the displacer assembly would require unacceptable changes {{to the design of}} the current RSSPC. However, magnetic suspension of both displacer and power piston is feasible for a relative-displacer version of the RSSPC. Magnetic suspension of the RSSPC power piston can potentially increase overall efficiency by 0. 5 to 1 percent (0. 1 to 0. 3 efficiency points). Magnetic bearings will also overcome several operational concerns associated with hydrostatic gas bearing systems. These advantages, however, are accompanied by a 5 percent increase in specific mass of the RSSPC...|$|R

50|$|Because the <b>piston</b> <b>assembly</b> only {{moves in}} one {{dimension}} (unlike {{the case in}} an engine with connecting rods), contact with the cylinder wall is minimised, which reduces wear and lubrication requirements.

40|$|This report {{presents}} {{final test}} results of two near-factory naturally-aspirated GM 502 cubic inch desplacement engines, operated on natural gas fuel. This engine {{has the potential}} for use in high output peakshaving or chiller applications. Initially, engine performance was to be measured on both engines, followed by a 100 -hour durability test of the first engine and 500 -hour durability test on the second 502 engine. Power, efficiency, blowby, oil consumption, oil degradation, plug erosion, and valve recession were recorded during durability testing. Maintenance was performed as needed and recorded. The planned 1000 -hour durability test of the first GM 502 engine was aborted due to excessive oil consumption. Prior to testing the second engine, the <b>piston</b> <b>assemblies</b> were replaced with newly designed pistons, but the engine still demonstrated high oil consumption. The oil consumption was decreased by replacing the second compression rings of the newly designed pistons with a taper-faced oil-scraper desing.

5000|$|These engines have a 90° v-block with 12 valves {{activated}} by a pushrod valvetrain. All engines have cast iron blocks and cylinder heads. The engines {{are based on}} the Chevrolet Small-Block engine, and the V6 is formed by the removal of the #3 and #6 cylinders. The V6s share the same 4.4-inch bore spacing and 9.025-inch deck height as the V8 engines. Many parts are interchangeable between the 90° V6 and the small block V8 including valvetrain components, bearings, <b>piston</b> <b>assemblies,</b> lubrication and cooling system components, and external accessories. [...] The 90-degree V6 engine uses the same transmission bellhousing pattern as the Chevrolet small-block V8 engine. The oil pan dipstick is located on the passenger side above the oil pan rail; this design was phased in on both the V6-90 and Small Block Chevrolet assembly lines (for engines manufactured after 1979) sharing the same casting dies. All the engines use a 1-6-5-4-3-2 firing order. The engines in this family are longitudinal engines, and have been used in rear-wheel drive cars and trucks, industrial, and marine applications. As of 2012, the Chevrolet 90° V6 is currently produced at the GM Powertrain Division plant in Romulus, Michigan.|$|R

This bearing consists of several small journal bearings attached to a disk which has a larger crankshaft journal bearing in the center. Each piston has one head admission valve. This valve is actuated by a variable cam on the crankshaft, and allows for the entrance of supercritical water into the cylinder. As the supercritical water enters the cylinder it flashes into steam and pushes the piston inward, thus rotating the crankshaft.|$|E
50|$|The Bourke {{engine is}} {{basically}} a two-stroke design, with one horizontally opposed <b>piston</b> <b>assembly</b> using two pistons that move {{in the same direction}} at the same time, so that their operations are 180 degrees out of phase. The pistons are connected to a Scotch Yoke mechanism in place of the more usual crankshaft mechanism, thus the piston acceleration is perfectly sinusoidal. This causes the pistons to spend more time at top dead center than conventional engines. The incoming charge is compressed in a chamber under the pistons, as in a conventional crankcase-charged two-stroke engine. The connecting-rod seal prevents the fuel from contaminating the bottom-end lubricating oil.|$|E

40|$|Lecturepg. 3 Prudhoe Bay {{produced}} water injection pumps suffered serious vibration problems and high balance piston leakage {{a few months}} after initial startup. Even though initial pump orientation at low water rates was satisfactory, time between overhauls deteriorated to as little as 700 hours as rates increased. This resulted in oil production cutbacks and significant operating problems. A high priority investigation was initiated, and with the manufacturer?s assistance, the cause of the vibration was identified as rotor instability due to abrasive wear in the pump?s wear rings and balance <b>piston</b> <b>assemblies.</b> Various solutions were evaluated. It was decided to ?	Reduce the abrasives in the {{produced water}} as much as practical ?	Increase in the hardness of the pump?s wearing parts. ?	Add a ?swirl brake? to the balance piston sleeve to increase rotor stability The changes were implemented during the fall of 1986 with encouraging results. As of fall 1987, two of the pumps had approximately 5500 hours on them and two others had about 4000 hours. Even though it is believed some wear has occurred, no additional problems with wear related vibration has been encountered since the improvements. A minimum service life of three years is desired. The pumps are being closely monitored. Additional improvements, such as alternate coatings, further improvements in water quality, etc., will be evaluated if the life target is not achieved...|$|R
