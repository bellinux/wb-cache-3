5|$|The {{motorway}} {{was planned}} concurrently with the M4 in the 1960s, and construction was complete to Eastville in northeast Bristol by 1970.

5|$|A {{scheme to}} cover the moors with ash from {{coal-fired}} power stations, and possibly municipal rubbish, was proposed in 1962, and again in 1969. Another plan of the 1960s was to build a regional airport on the moors; this proposal was revived in 1971. Further ash-tipping schemes were voiced in 1974, as was a third plan for an airport in 1976. There were also <b>plans</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the moor as a dump for colliery waste in 1978, when Thorne Colliery was upgraded and reopened.|$|E
5|$|Aang {{proposes a}} beach party {{in lieu of}} training, {{explaining}} that he has decided to challenge Fire Lord Ozai only after Sozin's Comet and its enhancement of firebending have come and gone, due to his self-perceived inability to fight the Fire Lord on equal footing. When Zuko tells the group that Ozai <b>plans</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the comet's power to burn down the Earth Kingdom and Water Tribes, Aang resolves to face him before the comet arrives. Sokka decides to have a simulation fight against a scarecrow, but Aang refuses to kill it due to his pacifistic nature and non-violent upbringing, and even berates his friends after they tell pointedly him {{that he has no}} choice but to kill Ozai.|$|E

5|$|In Lillehammer's {{bids for}} the 1992 and 1994 Winter Olympics, Balbergbakken was the {{proposed}} site of ski jumping. Lillehammer {{was awarded the}} 1994 Olympics in 1988, but a year later the <b>plans</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> Balbergbanen were abandoned. The venue was regarded as unsuitable; for instance NOK30 million {{would have to be}} spent on building a new access road. In addition, a new water and sewer system, new stands, participant facilities and a normal hill would have to be built. The available space at Balbergbakken was limited, and the organizers saw it as advantageous to have the ski stadium close to the ski jumping hills.|$|E

Work would be completed by fall 2018.|$|E
5|$|On 12 July Ward {{reported}} on the weekend's events to MI5. He told Woods that Ivanov and Profumo had met and that the latter had shown considerable interest in Keeler. Ward also stated {{that he had been}} asked by Ivanov for information about the future arming of West Germany with atomic weapons. This request for military information did not greatly disturb MI5, who expected a GRU officer to ask such questions. Profumo's interest in Keeler was an unwelcome complication in their <b>plans</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> her in a honey trap operation against Ivanov, to help secure his defection. Woods therefore referred the issue to MI5's director-general, Sir Roger Hollis.|$|E

The idea was abandoned after locals began descending on the Stax building, as were alternative <b>plans</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> either Atlantic Studios in New York or Motown's facility in Detroit.|$|E
5|$|The K Foundation {{was an art}} {{foundation}} set up by Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty (The KLF) in 1993, {{following their}} 'retirement' from the music industry. The Foundation served as an artistic outlet for the duo's post-retirement KLF income.
