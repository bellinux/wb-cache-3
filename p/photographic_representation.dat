25|$|Under the {{supervision}} of Post Office design adviser Barry Robinson, Jeffery Matthews prepared alternative essays from March 1982 pictures of the Queen by Lord Snowdon. Matthews used many different positions {{of the head and}} shoulders, from profile to full-face. Essays with the latter position were designed from the <b>photographic</b> <b>representation</b> and from a portrait drawn by his son Rory Matthews. In 1983, Robinson ordered new portraits by different artists : drawn by John Sargeant, painted by Timothy Whidborne and Brian Sanders, later engraved by Czesław Słania in 1984. Harrisons and Sons printed these essays. However, they failed to please the Stamp Advisory Committee.|$|E

60|$|I have a most {{charming and}} {{interesting}} letter, and a <b>photographic</b> <b>representation</b> of your fine head which I cannot so unrestrictedly commend, {{to thank you}} for. The portrait has its points as a memento, {{but they are not}} fine points as a likeness. I remember you, I think of you, I evoke you, much more plastically. But it was none the less liberal and faithful of you to include me in the list of fond recipients. Your letter contained all sorts of good things, but best of all the happy news of your wife's better condition. I rejoice in that almost obstreperously and beg you to tell her so with my love. The Sydney photograph that you kindly announce (of her) hasn't come, but I impatiently desire it. Meanwhile its place is gracefully occupied by your delightful anecdote of your mother's retrospective Scotch friend--the pale, penetratin' and interestin' one. Perhaps you will permit me {{to say that it is}} exquisitely Scotch; at any rate it moves altogether in the highest walks of anecdote.|$|E

40|$|The working cowboy remains {{part of the}} {{contemporary}} culture of Texas. A visual record of him appeared early in the state's history, in daguerreotypes, followed by representations in contemporary black and white as well as color photographs, film and video. Although {{the way of life}} for the Texas cowboy has changed, it remains a thriving part of the Texas economy, society, and culture. Moreover, the image of the cowboy has permeated popular culture and fine art. This paper explores what late twentieth century popular culture and fine art images of the cowboy signify, emphasizing aspects of how they signify in relation to an existing tradition of <b>photographic</b> <b>representations.</b> Using Barthes' "Myth Today," it considers how the documentary aspect of early <b>photographic</b> <b>representations</b> of cowboys is transformed in contemporary popular culture and fine art to become mythology, for example, by the exaggeration of features of dress to connote ideals allegorically...|$|R

40|$|This essay {{explores the}} {{question}} of how Brazilian photojournalist Sebastião Salgado uses his photographs to transform his viewers’ vision and provoke an ethical response. Religion, here, constitutes the ways in which people orient themselves to values and meanings both within and beyond the keepings of human society. Salgado constructs his photographs so as to facilitate a multi-sensory response, thus shattering the modern, visually-dominated mode of perception, which he considers alienating. Thus, by using his <b>photographic</b> <b>representations</b> of reality intervene in his audience’s viewing process, Salgado orients and re-orients his viewers to reality as he sees it...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{provides}} a critical appraisal of photo elicitation as a methodological tool for understanding what E. P. Thompson conceives as history from below. The discussion argues that reading <b>photographic</b> <b>representations</b> {{of other cultures}} is often structured within the flow and contestation of power. To study such representation, Manyozo contends, a scholar should construct a conversation among the circuits of culture within which such photographs were taken, were exchanged and are being made sense of. In conclusion, the chapter argues that reading ethnographic photography is a convergence of {{the experiences of the}} photographer, those photographed, the scholars reading the images and the sociocultural context in which the reading is made...|$|R

50|$|S.A. Bachman’s work {{focuses on}} socio-political critique, {{manifested}} by an uncompromising investigation of photography's claim to veracity and evidence. Through {{a confluence of}} image appropriation, language and monumental scale, her photographs interrogate the correspondence between fact and fiction and the deceptive parameters of public and private. By deftly manipulating popular media representations of suburban malaise and out-of-context advertisements, Bachman turns the seemingly innocent, but obviously offending, image against itself. Her photo-montages juxtapose texts suggesting an anonymous voice of authority with conversational artifacts to underscore the complex ways <b>photographic</b> <b>representation</b> reinscribes sexism, white privilege and conformity.|$|E
40|$|In {{this article}} we {{describe}} findings from a recent study in which we interviewed four British teenage girls about their photo display practices, online and offline, in family homes. We adopted a phenomenological approach to inquiry, with a particular interest in exploring how <b>photographic</b> <b>representations</b> of self and family signal self-development in emerging adulthood. Findings reveal how teens portrayed themselves differently to friends, online, and family, offline. Self-presentation to peers through photographs was managed separately from the family and largely free from parental control. The separate, online domain was used to explore alternative self-representations with real friends. Our findings appear to signal changing politics of photograph ownership and family representation between the generations...|$|R

Using the rod scale as a key visual metaphor for the identity of the discipline, I will argue that the increasing presence of the rod scale in published site photographs played a key part in the development of a specific scientific visual vocabulary which was driven by the contemporary culture-historical context...|$|R

The analysis that follows engages closely with {{the status of the}} photographs as images, arguing that existing critical interpretations fail to account for the particular issues and problems that the visual image presents. Through detailed reference work by Judith Butler and Susan Sontag, this paper will also interrogate the limitations of recent theoretical approaches to the Abu Ghraib photographs, and consider the extent to which discussions of gender have been excluded from these discourses...|$|R

5000|$|Although {{she often}} works in {{different}} media, Johnson expresses her frustrations with classical “straight” photography. In the Canadian Art article “7 Lessons from Sarah Anne Johnson”, she states, “My general interest in photography is showing what something looks like, {{but also what}} it feels like by altering the surface or image in any way, I can describe what a space feels like psychologically, {{what it feels like}} to be there”. By using several mediums Johnson is able to separate photography and “true” documentary <b>photographic</b> <b>representation</b> [...] by challenging the notion of photography as fact and different type of truths in capturing moments through photography.|$|E

Among the most notable of these were distinctions between human sight and <b>photographic</b> <b>representation,</b> proposals on the nature of Durer's [...] "veil," [...] and an argument that Alberti's treatise was misinterpreted due to a failure to read the original Latin.

40|$|When architects give lectures {{about their}} work they tend to show a series of {{photographs}} of their completed buildings: striking images (often devoid of human presence) taken by third-party professional photographers, which suggest a totally unproblematic relationship between design practice, physical artefacts and their <b>photographic</b> <b>representations.</b> But this is clearly not the case. Arguably indeed architects do not make buildings; they rather craft the instructions and oversee the processes that eventually lead to their completion; processes over which they have no monopoly –as they often take place even without the architects’ mediation and always involve many other ‘actors’. So why do architects insist on showing photographs of buildings? This paper will first unpack the complex {{nature of the relationship}} between architecture, buildings and photography, to then introduce the way in which DSDHA, as research-oriented architects, experiment with the photographic medium; using it to portray the ‘differential’ in value that we bring to our projects, and treating it as a design tool that contributes to, and speaks of, our approach –rather than simply fixing on glossy images the final outcomes of our endeavours. The focus will be on DSDHA’s research techniques that use photography as their starting point to investigate latent concerns, aspirations and trends of the many individuals which inhabit our sites –all aspects that often remain hidden to the generic gaze of statistics and evade the canonical artifact-focused <b>photographic</b> <b>representations</b> of architecture. The images we manufacture by means of these techniques are our starting point to map what we call ‘personal landscapes’, and understand how individual narratives relate to the urban morphology {{as well as to the}} history of a place. It is from this vantage point that we then proceed to speculate on possible future scenarios...|$|R
40|$|Perirhinal cortex {{ablation}} {{has previously}} been shown only to impair new postoperative object discrimination learning with large stimulus set sizes (> or = 40 problems). In this study, 3 cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) with bilateral perirhinal cortex ablations were impaired relative to 3 normal controls on concurrent discrimination learning tasks with only 10 problems with the objects presented in different orientations in each trial to increase the demands placed on object identification. This supports the hypothesis that perirhinal cortex damage impairs the ability to identify multiple individual objects. Fewer errors were made to digitized images of objects than toward real objects. Both groups subsequently transferred specific object-reward associations from real objects to digitized images of the respective objects and vice versa, providing evidence that cynomolgus monkeys can recognize <b>photographic</b> <b>representations</b> of objects with experience...|$|R
