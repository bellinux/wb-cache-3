Working with surgeon C. Walton Lillehei, Medtronic began to build portable and implantable cardiac pacemakers about this time.|$|E
5|$|In the {{treatment}} of diabetic foot infections, linezolid appears to be cheaper and more effective than vancomycin. In a 2004 open-label study, it was as effective as ampicillin/sulbactam and Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, and far superior in patients with foot ulcers and no osteomyelitis, but with significantly higher rates of adverse effects. A 2008 meta-analysis of 18 randomized controlled trials, however, found that linezolid treatment failed as often as other antibiotics, regardless of whether <b>patients</b> <b>had</b> osteomyelitis.|$|E

In 2011, he published , which debuted at number seven on the New York Times' Best Sellers: Hardcover Advice, How-To And Miscellaneous list. Earlier that year, Rosenthal published preliminary research on the potential influence of TM on Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.|$|E
5|$|Norving (previously Varangfly) started {{offering}} {{flights to}} the closed-down military airport in 1970 using their newly delivered Britten-Norman Islander. The background was a landing at the airfield to transport {{a baby to}} Kirkenes Hospital. The Civil Aviation Administration stated {{that they were not}} opposed to building smaller ambulance airports, but that the state's priority was constructing a network of regional airports. The service started off with a daily round trip ordered by the district physician; <b>patients</b> <b>had</b> priority, but the airline would transport other passengers as well. After a month a second daily round trip was introduced.|$|E

25|$|In November {{researchers}} {{reported on the}} use of VRX496, a gene-based immunotherapy for the treatment of HIV that uses a lentiviral vector to deliver an antisense gene against the HIV envelope. In a phase I clinical trial, five subjects with chronic HIV infection who had failed to respond to at least two antiretroviral regimens were treated. A single intravenous infusion of autologous CD4 T cells genetically modified with VRX496 was well tolerated. All <b>patients</b> <b>had</b> stable or decreased viral load; four of the five <b>patients</b> <b>had</b> stable or increased CD4 T cell counts.

30|$|A {{diagnostic}} {{dilemma is}} to distinguish concentric hypertrophy due to HT from a concentric type of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM).

25|$|Two {{patients}} initially {{diagnosed with}} fibromyalgia were subsequently {{shown to have}} myotonia congenita. Both <b>patients</b> <b>had</b> been seen by rheumatologists and diagnosed with fibromyalgia. The diagnoses were revised when electromyographic studies revealed myotonic discharges {{in some of the}} muscles. Genetic analysis of the skeletal muscle chloride channel which is the underlying cause of myotonia congenita revealed that both <b>patients</b> <b>had</b> mutations in this gene. Over 130 mutations in this gene have been described and the phenotype is very variable which may account for the difficulty in the initial diagnosis.|$|E
25|$|A {{study from}} Sweden in 2002 {{attempted}} {{to follow up}} 18 patients for approximately 2 years after having been previously diagnosed with awareness under anesthesia. Four of the nine interviewed patients were still severely disabled due to psychiatric/psychological after-effects. All of these <b>patients</b> <b>had</b> experienced anxiety {{during the period of}} awareness, but only one had stated feeling pain. Another three <b>patients</b> <b>had</b> less severe, transient mental symptoms, although they could cope with these in daily life. Two patients denied any lasting effects from their awareness episode.|$|E
50|$|BWS can {{be caused}} by a range of {{different}} genetic defects. Over five distinct errors involving 11p15 have been identified in different BWS <b>patients.</b> Some <b>patients</b> <b>have</b> maternal chromosomal rearrangements of 11p15. Other <b>patients</b> <b>have</b> paternal uniparental disomy (UPD) of chromosome 11, meaning that the maternal copy of this chromosome is replaced with an extra paternal copy. Many other <b>patients</b> <b>have</b> abnormal DNA methylation in different areas of 11p15, meaning that normal epigenetic marks that regulate imprinted genes in this region are altered. A few other <b>patients</b> <b>have</b> a single gene copy located within 11p15, instead of two copies.|$|R
40|$|Treatment of 64 <b>patients</b> <b>having</b> {{urticaria}} {{of unknown}} aetiology with antibacterial drugs for I to 2 weeks brought relief in 27.

40|$|Adrug-related problem exists when {{a patient}} {{experiences}} a disease or symptoms related to drug therapy. 1 In their model of pharmaceutical care, Strand and colleagues 1 defined 8 categories of drug-related problems: • The <b>patient</b> <b>has</b> a medical condition requiring drug therapy (a drug indication) but is not receiving a drug for that indication. • The <b>patient</b> <b>has</b> a medical condition for which the wrong drug is being taken. • The <b>patient</b> <b>has</b> a medical condition for which too little of the correct drug is being taken. • The <b>patient</b> <b>has</b> a medical condition for which {{too much of the}} correct drug is being taken. • The <b>patient</b> <b>has</b> a medical condition resulting from an adverse drug reaction. • The <b>patient</b> <b>has</b> a medical condition resulting from a drug–drug, drug–food, or drug–laboratory interaction. • The <b>patient</b> <b>has</b> a medical condition as a result of not receiving the prescribed drug. • The <b>patient</b> <b>has</b> a medical condition as a result of taking a drug {{for which there is no}} indication. Drug-related problems have become a major public health issue in North America. They are responsible for staggering annual rates of morbidity and mortality and are associated with enormous costs to the health-care system. Which health-care professionals are in the best position to influence this important problem? Can pharmacists exert an impact on the magnitude of drug-related problems?

30|$|The final {{diagnosis}} in {{the present}} case was primary PCI because surgery showed no mechanical obstruction and the <b>patient</b> <b>had</b> no history of any condition associated with PCI. The <b>patient</b> <b>had</b> previously been diagnosed as having COPD based on honeycomb-like changes seen on pulmonary CT scans. However, the fibrotic changes were limited to the pulmonary bases and the <b>patient</b> <b>had</b> no pulmonary symptoms. Asymptomatic COPD seemed unlikely to have a significant association with PCI.|$|R
25|$|There {{appears to}} be an {{association}} of autoimmune rheumatoid arthritis (ARA) both with GSE and gluten allergies. ARA in GSE/CD may be secondary to tTG autoimmunity. In a recent study in Turkey, 8 of 20 ARA <b>patients</b> <b>had</b> wheat reactivities on the RAST tests. When this allergic food and all other patient specific RAST+ foods were removed half of the <b>patients</b> <b>had</b> improved ARA by serological markers. In patients with wheat allergies, rye was effectively substituted. This may indicate that some proportion of RA in GSE/CD is due to downstream effects of allergic responses. In addition, cross-reactive anti-beef-collagen antibodies (IgG) may explain some rheumatoid arthritis (RA) incidences.|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackgroundObscure {{gastrointestinal}} bleeding is a radiological challenge where in {{almost half of}} the patients; the origin of the blood loss remains unexplained. AimTo highlight the use of dual phase CT enterography for the detection of obscured gastrointestinal bleed. Patient and methodsTwenty consecutive patients (11 men and 9 women) with OGIB were included in this study; their age ranged from 28 to 67 years (mean age 45. 6 years). CT enterography was performed first with a non-contrast scan, followed by biphasic contrast-enhanced CT at 35 and 70 s at a rate of 4 mL/s. ResultsOn CT enterography, 12 patients (60 %) were negative while 8 <b>patients</b> (40 %) <b>had</b> positive findings as follows: one <b>patient</b> (5 %) <b>had</b> celiac disease, 1 <b>patient</b> (5 %) <b>had</b> active Crohn’s disease and another <b>patient</b> (5 %) <b>had</b> ischemic bowel changes.
