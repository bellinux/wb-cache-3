5|$|There {{have been}} three patches {{distributed}} since the game's initial release. The first patch for the game was released on October 21, 2010, while the second came out on October 28, and the third appeared on December 31, bringing the game to version 1.0.5. These updates improved such elements as gameplay, graphics, and the campaign map. The developers also intended to expand <b>ProtoGalaxy</b> with new features and levels. A party celebrating the game's launch was held on October 15, 2010 at Memorial University. On February 25, 2011, Source Studio released Proto Defense, which enhanced the level editor and provided gamers with a new tower-defense-style level as downloadable content. On April 28, 2011, <b>ProtoGalaxy</b> was released on Impulse, another digital distribution platform.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: According to the Scale-Symmetric Everlasting Theory (S-SET), {{the very}} early Universe was the loop {{composed}} of <b>protogalaxies</b> built of the neutron black holes. Due to the succeeding inflows of the dark energy, there was the exit of the loop from its black-hole state and the loop transformed into the expanding sphere. The Milky-Way Galaxy {{is very close to}} the centre of the expanding Universe so we cannot see directly the first stage of evolution of the early Universe. But due to some phenomena, the early binary systems and clusters of <b>protogalaxies</b> are imprinted on the CMB. Due to the mergers of the <b>protogalaxies</b> during the unseen period of evolution, the number of observed today clusters of galaxies should be smaller than it follows from the CMB and such conclusion is consistent with the observational facts. Here, I answered following question: Why we cannot see directly the evolution of the early Universe whereas we can see the CMB with coded initial number of clusters of <b>protogalaxies?</b> Introduction and motivation Here, I answered following question: Why we cannot see directly the evolution of the early Universe whereas we can see the CMB with coded initial number of clusters of <b>protogalaxies...</b>|$|R

We explore numerically the chemical, thermal, and dynamical evolution of a shell formed by a high-energy supernova explosion (10 53 erg) in dwarf <b>protogalaxies</b> with total (dark matter plus baryonic) mass 10 7 M ⊙ at a redshift z = 12. We consider two initial configurations for the baryonic matter, one without rotation and the other having the ratio of rotational to gravitational energy β = 0. 17. The (non-rotating) dark matter halo is described by a quasiisothermal sphere. The latter choice {{is motivated by}} recently proposed mechanisms for rapid flattening of a central cuspy region in dwarf <b>protogalaxies.</b> Methods. We use a finite-difference numerical hydrodynamics code to simulate supernova explosions in dwarf <b>protogalaxies</b> with axial symmetry. The advection is treated using a third-order piecewise parabolic scheme.

2500|$|Dark matter can {{be divided}} into cold, warm and hot {{categories}}.

Primordial density fluctuations smaller than this length get washed out as particles spread from overdense to underdense regions, while larger fluctuations are unaffected; therefore this length sets a minimum scale for later structure formation. The categories are set with respect {{to the size of a}} <b>protogalaxy</b> (an object that later evolves into a dwarf galaxy): dark matter particles are classified as cold, warm, or hot according as their FSL; much smaller (cold), similar (warm), or much larger (hot) than a <b>protogalaxy.</b>|$|E
40|$|Model of {{supermassive black}} holes {{formation}} inside the clusters of primordial black holes is developed. Namely, it is supposed, that some mass {{fraction of the}} universe ~ 10 ^- 3 is composed of the compact clusters of primordial (relic) black holes, produced during phase transitions in the early universe. These clusters are the centers of dark matter condensation. We model the formation of <b>protogalaxies</b> with masses about 2 * 10 ^ 8 M_sun at the redshift z= 15. These induced <b>protogalaxies</b> contain central black holes with mass ~ 10 ^ 5 M_sun and look like dwarf spheroidal galaxies with central density spike. The subsequent merging of induced <b>protogalaxies</b> and ordinary dark matter haloes corresponds to the standard hierarchical clustering scenario of large-scale structure formation. The coalescence of primordial black holes results in formation of supermassive black holes in the galactic centers. As a result, the observed correlation between the masses of central black holes and velocity dispersion in the galactic bulges is reproduced.

40|$|Observations {{of distant}} bright quasars suggest that billion solar mass supermassive black holes (SMBHs) {{were already in}} place less than a billion years after the Big Bang. Models in which light black hole seeds form by the {{collapse}} of primordial metal-free stars cannot explain their rapid appearance due to inefficient gas accretion. Alternatively, these black holes may form by direct collapse of gas at the center of <b>protogalaxies.</b> However, this requires metal-free gas that does not cool efficiently and thus is not turned into stars, in contrast with the rapid metal enrichment of <b>protogalaxies.</b> Here we use a numerical simulation to show that mergers between massive <b>protogalaxies</b> naturally produce the required central gas accumulation with no need to suppress star formation. Merger-driven gas inflows produce an unstable, massive nuclear gas disk. Within the disk a second gas inflow accumulates more than 100 million solar masses of gas in a sub-parsec scale cloud in one hundred thousand years. The cloud undergoes gravitational collapse, which eventually leads to the formation of a massive black hole. The black hole can grow to a billion solar masses in less than a billion years by accreting gas from the surrounding disk.

2500|$|... "Cold" [...] {{dark matter}} offers the {{simplest}} explanation for most cosmological observations. It is dark matter composed of constituents with an FSL {{much smaller than}} a <b>protogalaxy.</b> This is the focus for dark matter research, as hot dark matter {{does not seem to}} be capable of supporting galaxy or galaxy cluster formation, and most particle candidates slowed early.|$|E
2500|$|... "Warm" [...] {{dark matter}} refers to {{particles}} with an FSL {{comparable to the}} size of a <b>protogalaxy.</b> Predictions based on warm dark matter are similar to those for cold dark matter on large scales, but with less small-scale density perturbations. This reduces the predicted abundance of dwarf galaxies and may lead to lower density of dark matter in the central parts of large galaxies; some researchers consider this to be a better fit to observations. A challenge for this model is the lack of particle candidates with the required mass ~ 300 eV to 3000 eV.|$|E
2500|$|... "Hot" [...] {{dark matter}} {{consists}} of particles whose FSL {{is much larger}} than the size of a <b>protogalaxy.</b> The neutrino qualifies as such particle. They were discovered independently, long before the hunt for dark matter: they were postulated in 1930, and detected in 1956. Neutrinos' mass is less than 10−6 that of an electron. Neutrinos interact with normal matter only via gravity and the weak force, making them difficult to detect (the weak force only works over a small distance, thus a neutrino triggers a weak force event only if it hits a nucleus head-on). This makes them 'weakly interacting light particles' (WILPs), as opposed to WIMPs.|$|E
40|$|The first {{generation}} of stars (commonly known as population III) are expected to form in low-mass <b>protogalaxies</b> in which molecular hydrogen is the dominant coolant. Radiation from these stars will rapidly build up an extragalactic ultraviolet (UV) background capable of photodissociating H 2, and {{it is widely believed}} that this background will suppress further star formation in low-mass systems. However, star formation will also produce an extragalactic X-ray background. This X-ray background, by increasing the fractional ionization of protogalactic gas, promotes H 2 formation and reduces the effectiveness of ultraviolet feedback. In this paper, we examine which of these backgrounds has the dominant effect. Using a simple model for the growth of the UV and X-ray backgrounds, together with a detailed one-dimensional model of protogalactic chemical evolution, we examine the effects of the X-ray backgrounds produced by a number of likely source models. We show that in several cases, the resulting X-ray background is strong enough to offset UV photodissociation in large H 2 -cooled <b>protogalaxies.</b> On the other hand, small <b>protogalaxies</b> (those with virial temperatures T vir < 2000 K) remain dominated by the UV background in all of the models we examine. We also briefly investigate the effects of the X-ray background upon the thermal and chemical evolution of the diffuse intergalactic medium...|$|R

40|$|We {{apply the}} phenomenological model {{used to explain}} the abundances of Fe and r-process {{elements}} in very metal-poor stars in the Galaxy to [Fe/H] of damped Ly alpha systems. It is assumed that the first stars formed after the Big Bang were very massive and promptly enriched the interstellar medium to [Fe/H] ~ - 3, at which metallicity formation of normal stars took over. Subsequent Fe enrichment was provided by Type II supernovae. The range of [Fe/H] at a given redshift z for damped Ly alpha systems is explained by the time t* after the Big Bang at which normal star formation started in an individual protogalactic system. The average t* is approx 80 % {{the age of the}} universe for damped Ly alpha systems at z approx 1. 5 to 4. 5, indicating a long delay between the Big Bang and the turn-on of <b>protogalaxies.</b> It is inferred that a substantial fraction of the total baryonic matter may not have been aggregated into <b>protogalaxies</b> where normal star formation had occurred down to z ~ 1. 5.
