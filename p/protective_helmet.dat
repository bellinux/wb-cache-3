25|$|The {{device on}} the cap is {{sometimes}} referred to as Australia's Cricket Coat of Arms, although it has otherwise been abandoned by Cricket Australia. It is replicated on the <b>protective</b> <b>helmet,</b> but not on any other badged item of clothing worn by the Australian team. These now feature the current logogram of Cricket Australia, being a modern distorted shield with the ubiquitous Southern Cross on a green and gold field of a rising sun and a wicket casting a shadow on a pitch.|$|E
25|$|Mark Boucher {{suffered}} a serious eye injury on 9 July 2012, after being struck {{on his left}} eye by a bail. He was not wearing a <b>protective</b> <b>helmet</b> or glasses when {{he was struck by}} the bail after leg-spinner Imran Tahir bowled Somerset's Gemaal Hussain. Following surgery to the eyeball, Boucher was ruled out {{of the rest of the}} tour. Due to the severity of the injury, Boucher—who had planned to retire at the end of the tour—retired from International Cricket on 10 July.|$|E

As {{a result of this}} Pvt Hunt's head struck the vehicle and despite wearing his drivers <b>protective</b> <b>helmet</b> Pvt Hunt sustained a serious injury from which he never recovered consciousness. He was subsequently aero-medically evacuated to the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine in Selly Oak Hospital so his family could be with him when he died.|$|E

25|$|Amiss {{made his}} Test debut for England {{in the fifth}} Test of the 1966 series with West Indies, and he proved an {{accomplished}} Test match batsman. He {{was one of the}} first batsmen to use a <b>protective</b> <b>helmet.</b> In scoring 3,612 Test runs, Amiss made eleven half-centuries and eleven centuries, including two double centuries against the West Indies. His highest Test match score, also his highest first-class score, was 262 not out against the West Indies in the 1973–74 Kingston Test, an innings that saved the Test match for England after they conceded a first innings lead of 230. The next highest score in England's innings was 38. After being dropped by England in 1975, he made a successful return against the West Indies at the Oval in the final Test of 1976, although his 203 in the first innings did not prevent England losing the match. Amiss's last Test came in 1977 when he was left out to make way for Geoff Boycott's return from self-imposed exile.|$|E
500|$|A {{second group}} {{surrounded}} PC Coombes, who sustained a five-inch-long cut to his face, and broken {{upper and lower}} jaws. In 2004 {{he said he was}} still suffering the effects of the attack, which the police regard as attempted murder, including poor hearing and eyesight, epileptic fits, and a memory so poor that he was left unable to read a book or drive. A third constable, Michael Shepherd, had his <b>protective</b> <b>helmet</b> pierced by an iron spike. Several of the officers and firemen turned and ran back toward the crowd to try to save Blakelock and Coombes. Trevor Stratford told a reporter in 2010: [...] "I remember running in with another fire officer to get Dick Coombes. I literally slid into the group, like a rugby player charging into a ruck. We dragged him out, but he was in a hell of a state": ...|$|E
500|$|The rioters removed Blakelock's <b>protective</b> <b>helmet,</b> {{which was}} never found. Rose {{writes that the}} pathologist, David Bowen, found 54 holes in Blakelock's overalls, and 40 cutting or {{stabbing}} injuries, eight of them to his head, caused by a machete, sword or axe-type instrument. A six-inch-long knife was buried in his neck up to the hilt. His body was covered in marks from having been kicked or stamped on. His hands and arms were badly cut, and he had lost several fingers trying to defend himself. There were 14 stab wounds on his back, one {{on the back of}} his right thigh, six on his face, and his jawbone had been smashed by a blow that left a six-inch gash across the right side of his head. Bowen said the force of this blow had been [...] "almost as if to sever his head," [...] which gave rise to a rumour that an attempt had been made to decapitate him (according to Rose, the autopsy photographs did not support this).|$|E
25|$|Colored dress, <b>protective</b> <b>helmets,</b> field restrictions, cricket under lights, {{became a}} {{standard}} {{part of the}} post-Packer game. Crucially, Packer drove home the lesson that cricket was a marketable game, which could generate huge revenues.|$|R
40|$|Background: <b>Protective</b> <b>helmets</b> {{in sport}} are {{important}} for {{reducing the risk of}} head and facial injury. In cricket and other sports with projectiles, national test standards control the minimum helmet performance. However, there are few field data showing if helmets are effective in reducing head injury...|$|R
50|$|Cowboy hats {{remain the}} primary {{headwear}} used. While the professional organizations permit <b>protective</b> <b>helmets</b> and masks, some riders {{continue to believe}} that this equipment can detrimentally affect balance, and many professionals still avoid wearing them. However, the trend is changing, as more champion riders begin to wear helmets for added safety.|$|R
2500|$|No {{protective}} padding is worn by players. A plastic <b>protective</b> <b>helmet</b> with a faceguard is mandatory for all age groups, including senior level, as of 2010. The game {{has been described}} as [...] "a bastion of humility", with player names absent from jerseys and a player's number decided by his position on the field.|$|E
2500|$|Australia's first innings was {{notable for}} Graham Yallop {{being the first}} batsman to wear a full <b>protective</b> <b>helmet</b> in test cricket and Bruce Yardley's knock of 74 off 48 balls. Jeff Thomson then {{delivered}} an inspiring spell of bowling which Simpsons said [...] "proved beyond question {{that he is the}} world's fastest bowler". Thomson ended up taking 6–77, limiting the West Indies lead to 38, but Australia collapsed in their second innings (despite another Yardley cameo) and the hosts had little difficulty in winning by nine wickets.|$|E
2500|$|During his {{captaincy}} Taylor {{instituted a}} pre-match ceremony for {{the awarding of}} a cap. This continued under Waugh, who introduced a refinement whereby new players would receive their [...] "baggy green" [...] from a past player of a similar discipline (batsman, spin bowler, etc.). Ponting changed it again, making the presentation himself rather than using a former player. Another tradition instituted by Taylor (but suggested by Steve Waugh, and one that has also continued) is the practice of all players wearing the cap during the first session {{in the field of}} a Test match, as a symbol of solidarity. Even Shane Warne, known for his preference for a floppy sun hat, observed this tradition without question. Modern players seldom wear the baggy green cap while batting, choosing a <b>protective</b> <b>helmet</b> instead, especially when facing faster bowlers.|$|E

2500|$|Mr. Freeze is {{featured}} in [...] Mr. Freeze's freeze gun {{can be found}} in the evidence room at the Gotham City Police Department. According to Aaron Cash, Mr. Freeze hasn't been seen or heard since Arkham City and implies that he possibly gave up his criminal life to continue his work on finding a cure for Nora Fries. There was also a mentioning that the freeze gun was used by some members of the Gotham City Police Department to make ice cream until it was confiscated from them by James Gordon. Mr. Freeze appears in the December [...] "Season of Infamy" [...] downloadable content (DLC) pack in the side misson [...] "In From The Cold". Batman discovers a frozen vessel just off the coast of Gotham and investigates finding Mr. Freeze at his wife's old cryogenic chamber. He says that the Arkham Knight's Militia took Nora after he refused to help Scarecrow and Arkham Knight with their plans to take down Batman. Freeze entrusts Batman to rescue his wife from the soldiers. After fighting through a barrage of Militia henchmen, Batman finds Nora and breaks her out of her damaged cryochamber. Much to both Batman and Freeze's surprise, she no longer wants to be frozen in ice and simply wants to spend time with Victor. It's also revealed that she could hear every word he said, despite being in suspended animation. After taking down a Militia force trying to destroy Fries' vessel, Nora and Victor meet face-to-face and Victor removes his <b>protective</b> <b>helmet.</b> As they look off at Gotham, Nora asks how long they will live, to which Victor replies [...] "merely days". They then depart Gotham City; when Batman analyses Freeze's equipment in the GCPD lockup, a recording made by Cash ponders whether this turn of events is a happy or sad outcome for the Fries'.|$|E

40|$|The hottest months {{encountered}} on northern Australian cattle {{stations are}} from September to November, where {{the climate is}} both hot and dry, and it is during these months that horseback cattle mustering occurs. Stockmen wear clothing that restricts heat loss (collared shirts and long trousers), yet <b>protective</b> <b>helmets</b> have recently been introduced into the cattle industry (AS/NZS 3838 : 2006), {{as part of the}} increasing occupational health and safety responsibilities of pastoral companies. Anecdotal evidence points to the possibility that <b>protective</b> <b>helmets</b> may increase the probability of stockmen developing heat illness, or experiencing reduced workplace performance. Herein, we describe the working and thermal environment on these cattle stations, and provide an overview of the metabolic demands, and the concurrent physiological and cognitive strain encountered during horseback mustering in a hot-dry environment, whilst stockmen wore an equestrian helmet (Taylor and Caldwell, 2007). In subsequent investigations, we evaluated heat penetration through various forms of headwear (Caldwell and Taylor, 2007), and completed laboratory-based trials in which the physiological impact of an equestrian helmet, relative to the traditional felt hat, was evaluated (Caldwell et al., 2007) ...|$|R
