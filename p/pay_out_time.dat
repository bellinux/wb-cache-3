A case study was carried out to evaluate the technical and economical feasibility of an industrial heat storage system. The study focused on integration of a heat storage system within an existing production facility of organic surfactants. Three different thermal storage systems with operating temperatures between 110 °C to 160 °C were designed to store the heat released during the exothermic reaction phase and re-use the heat for preheating of the reactants in the following batch. The first system uses a Phase Change Material (PCM) contained in metal balls with an assumed phase change temperature at 140 °C. The second system uses a concrete volume as a sensible heat storage material and the third system is also based on concrete, but with a doubling of the storage capacity. A dynamic simulation was performed of a reference cycle of a batch reactor coupled with a thermal storage system to calculate energy savings for preheating of the reactants. It was required to oversize the storage capacity of the PCM system, {{in order to obtain}} a heat transfer rate that matches with the conditions of the actual process. The calculated energy savings for heating of the batch reactors is 50 to 70 %, resulting in financial savings of 26 to 38 k€ on an annual basis.

30|$|The world {{energy demand}} is not static {{and it is}} {{forecasted}} to increase rapidly. Although the world is rapidly {{moving in the direction}} of using a mix of energy, it is expected that 53 % of the world’s energy needs will be met by oil and gas in 2040 (Ban et.al. 2016). Therefore, we can safely say that oil will be a major player for the energy market for the next 30  years at least. Carbonate reservoirs contribute more than 60 % of the world’s petroleum production. Carbonate reservoirs (limestone or dolomite) are heterogeneous and require major skills to understand and develop a detailed reservoir description. Low-permeability carbonate reservoirs have been considered uneconomical to develop because of their low flow rates and longer <b>pay</b> <b>out</b> <b>times.</b> Oil in low-permeability oil reservoirs is classified as unconventional reserves. Unconventional reserve is defined by the oil industry as ‘hard to recover’ oil. The definition ‘hard to recover’ reserve includes reservoirs having low-permeability and/or porosity. The oil recovery by waterflooding technology is not known as an effective method in low-permeability carbonate oil reservoirs. To maximize the wellbore–reservoir contact area in these low-permeability reservoirs, a number of oil companies completed horizontal wells with multiple hydraulic fracturing stages. In spite of above-mentioned technological advances, low-permeability oil reservoirs exhibit a huge variety of geological characteristics that makes the application of a single technique (completion/development) unrealistic and might lead to unfavorable economical and/or technical conditions. Therefore, an innovative exploration/exploitation strategy is required for optimal hydrocarbon recovery from low-permeability oil reservoirs. Consequently, research has been directed to develop new methods to improve oil recovery from this type of reservoirs.|$|R

40|$|CALCULATING THE <b>PAY</b> <b>OUT</b> <b>TIME</b> OF THE TRANSITION TO HIGH HEALTH PIG FARMING IN THE NETHERLANDS MAR Schyns 1, H Hogeveen, LAMG van Leengoed, A van Nes 1 1 Department of Farm Animal Health, University of Utrecht, The Netherlands Introduction Livestock {{production}} is currently under {{discussion in the}} Netherlands. There is political pressure to reduce the use of antibiotics and social anxiety for the outbreak of zoonotic diseases. A high health production system will {{reduce the incidence of}} disease and hence the use of antibiotics. Moreover, the farmer has an economic reason to switch to a high health system, because piglets are sold for a higher price. On the other hand the farmer has to make a big investment and the cash flow will be negative for a considerable time. The aim {{of this study is to}} quantify the investments, the return on investment (ROI), the payback time and the cash flow during transition of a breeding farm. Materials and Methods A model was constructed to calculate the total costs of the transition and the extra profit that is made after the transition. For estimation of the input parameters KWIN, and several experts with knowledge of high health pigs and economics of livestock production were consulted. After the model was built, it was internally validated. Afterwards, it was discussed with four farmers who made the transition to high health pig farming in the past. Timeline The calculation was performed for a period of four years. The first year was the “base” year used to calculate the standard. In the second and third year the actual transition took place. The fourth year was the new situation. Transition In order to make a good calculation it was necessary to describe exactly how the transition took place. We modelled a situation where first, the replacement rate of sows is reduced. Twenty weeks later, the insemination of sows and gilts is stopped and the sows are culled after weaning. When all the pigs are sold and the stable is completely empty, a period of five weeks is used to clean and disinfect the stable. After the five weeks the new (pregnant) gilts are introduced on the farm and farrowed 2 weeks later. In total, there is a production stop of seventeen weeks. Model In the model, sows are allocated to week groups. Therefore, it is possible to calculate the total costs every week in order to have insight into the cash flow during transition. Also, it is possible to calculate the total costs of the farm and the variable costs by the number of sows and pigs which changes week by week during the transition period. We calculated the total costs for the transition by comparing the results from year 2 and 3 with the base (year 1). The net profit of transition is the difference between year 4 and year 1. Results The model was used to calculate the cost of a transition of a 2, 000 sow breeding farm. Table 1 presents the net profit during the four modelled years. The return on investment is in the fourth year € 202, 473. The total investment was € 430, 024, so the costs of transition will be paid back in 2. 12 years (= 430, 024 / 202, 473). The liquid assets reached rock bottom at - € 351, 707. Using a sensitivity analysis, also in small farms the transition was paid back in 2. 4 years. Table 1.
