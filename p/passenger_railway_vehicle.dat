40|$|A <b>railway</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>vehicle</b> {{must ensure}} {{a high level}} of comfort, {{especially}} if it is used for the transport of passengers with reduced mobility. Comfort is a physical and psychological condition, affected by many factors, such as vibration, noise, temperature and humidity. The comfort level of a <b>railway</b> <b>vehicle</b> is particularly affected by mechanical vibrations with a frequency range of 0 to 80 Hz. This range depends on the characteristics of the track and the vehicle's suspension. The technical standards currently in use require the measurement of acceleration {{at the level of the}} floor of the vehicle, neglecting the important effects of the seat. This work, which has been developed within the Industry 2015 program "Caritas", describes the design and the experimental characterisation of an innovative test rig that allows one to test the comfort level of different types of railway seats before operation. The test bench described in the paper can appreciably help the design process of railway seat...|$|R

30|$|With the {{development}} of urban railway transportation, the metro and lower floor light rail vehicles {{have been widely used}} in many cities. Whereas, compared with the main line <b>railway</b> <b>vehicles,</b> the urban <b>railway</b> <b>vehicles</b> meet more challenges because of the limitation of circumstance [1, 2, 3], which means that the urban <b>railway</b> <b>vehicles</b> may encounter a large number of curved tracks in daily operations, especially tight curves. Therefore, urban <b>railway</b> <b>vehicles</b> require a good steering capability to negotiate the curve with small radius. However, according to the previous operation experience of urban <b>railway</b> <b>vehicles,</b> the conventional wheelset cannot provide sufficient self-steering capability to negotiate the sharp curve, which may leads to severe wheel/rail wear and noise [2, 3, 4].|$|R

40|$|To {{study the}} {{influences}} of carbody vertical stiffness on vehicle ride quality, a vertical model of <b>railway</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>vehicles,</b> which includes the carbody flexible effects and all vertical rigid modes, is built. With the model and the covariance method, the requirements for the carbody bending frequency are researched. The results show that when the stiffness of a carbody decreases to certain frequencies there are significant vibrations in the carbody, although structural damping provided by a fully equipped carbody will help attenuate the vibration to some extent. A simple way to avoid resonant vibration {{is to increase the}} bending frequencies of a carbody: the higher the vehicle running speed, the higher carbody stiffness could be required. However, there are practical limitations to such an increase and the method used in this study can readily obtain the lowest bending frequency required by vehicle ride quality. Finally, the geometric filtering phenomenon and its influences on the carbody resonant flexural vibration are analysed. Results show that it is this phenomenon rather than the natural vibrations of bogie bounce that most strongly influences the resonant flexural vibration of a railway carbody...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to study the effect of primary and {{secondary}} suspensions of a <b>railway</b> <b>vehicle</b> on stability and passenger ride comfort. The possible improvement of conventional suspension without using a controllable suspension system is investigated. A linear 17 degree-of-freedom (DOF) <b>railway</b> <b>vehicle</b> model is used to study the vibration response of the <b>railway</b> <b>vehicle</b> body. The equations of motion that represent the dynamics of the <b>railway</b> <b>vehicle</b> were derived based on Newton laws to describe the lateral, yaw and roll motions of the vehicle body, bogies and also wheel-sets. The spring stiffnesses and damping coefficients of the primary and secondary suspensions were varied incrementally in order to observe the response of the <b>railway</b> <b>vehicle</b> body. The vehicle model was simulated with lateral sinusoidal track disturbance using Matlab-SIMULINK software. The simulation results showed that the <b>railway</b> <b>vehicle</b> stability is significantly affected by the values of primary suspension...|$|R

40|$|The {{improvement}} of vibration comfort for <b>passengers</b> in aircraft, <b>railway</b> <b>vehicles</b> or cars requires comprehensive analytical and experimental investigations in structural dynamics. For analytical {{investigations of the}} vibration comfort {{it is essential to}} establish suitable computational models and to validate them. The validation requires an experimental identification of the dynamic characteristics of passenger seats and persons sitting on the seats. On the other hand it is possible to directly investigate the vibration comfort by performing tests on humans. Both aspects are described and discussed here. The paper describes first the experimental identification of transmissibility functions between the floor of a passenger cabin through a typical passenger seat to the pelvis, chest and shoulder of a sitting test dummy. The transmissibility FRF were computed by using different approaches. Also, nonlinearity investigations were performed. The measured transmissibility functions can be used to validate and verify sophisticated computational models. This may lead to strong improvements in the numerical simulation and finally in a substantial progress of vibration comfort for passengers. In a test campaign with humans typical vibration test sequences of an aircraft flight were applied. It showed that that the vibration test facility, the utilized equipment and the employed tools were able to fulfill all requirements. The test facility offers the potential to perform detailed investigations of the influence of vibrations on passenger comfort up to 100 Hz which is impossible with most standard vibration simulators...|$|R
