The problem of funding a public preschool occurs not only from limited sources but from the cost per child. As of 2007, the average cost across the lower 48 states was $6,582.

The methodology hinges on a systemic analysis of land delivery channels, which helps to show how land is initially made available for circulation, how tenure can be formalized incrementally, and the different means whereby households can access land. The analysis is applied to the area of Bamako in Mali, where information was collected through (i) interviews with key informants, (ii) a literature review on land policies, <b>public</b> <b>allocations,</b> and customary transfers of land, (iii) a press review on land disputes, and (iv) a survey of more than 1, 600 land transfers of un-built plots that The analysis finds that land is mostly accessed through an informal customary channel, whereby peri-urban land is transformed from agricultural to residential use, and through a public channel, which involves the administrative allocation of residential plots to households. The integrated analysis of land markets and land institutions stresses the complexity of procedures and the extra-legality of practices that strongly affect the functioning of formal and informal markets and make access to land costly and insecure, with negative social, economic, and environmental impacts over the long term...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT There is {{much concern}} about the {{capacity}} of the health system of Pakistan to meet its goals and obligations. Historically, the political thrust has been absent from the health policy formulation and this is reflected in the low and stagnant <b>public</b> <b>allocations</b> to health. Successive political leaderships have averred from considering healthcare is a common good rather than a market commodity and health has not been recognized as a constitutional right. Over 120 of world’s nation states have accepted health as a constitutional right but the 1973 Constitution of Pakistan does not mandate health or education as a fundamental right and the recently adopted 18 th constitutional amendment missed the opportunity to extend access to primary health care as an obligation of the State. It is argued in this communication that missing from the calculations of policy formulation and agenda setting is the political benefits of providing health and other social services to underserved populations. Across the developing world, many examples are presented of governments undertaking progressive health reforms that bring services where none existed and subsequently reaping electoral benefit. The political determinant of healthcare will be realized when the political leaders of poorly performing countries can be convinced that embracing distributive policies and successfully bringing healthcare to the poor can be major factors in their re-election...|$|E

The political de-bate is focused on some specifc issues such as: how many regions Romania must have, which cities should be the centers of those regions or what kind of institutions should be created. From this point of view, this paper presents a new perspective about the process of regionalization. The goal of this paper is to analyze the theoretical and empirical bases of the actual system of the rural localities. In Romania there are more than 2800 rural localities, but only a small part of them have the f-nancial strength to sustain the development policiesby their own. The vast majority of the communes are dependent upon the <b>public</b> <b>allocations.</b> On one hand, the most developed rural localities, situated with predilection in peripheral areas of important urban centers have important competitive advan-tages relying on the size of the population and the specifcity of the economic activities. On the other hand, communes from poor areas have a signifcant defcit of public utilities and infrastructure caused by the absence of fnancial resources. Therefore, the coordinates of the local budget of revenues and expenditures represents the main determinant in the process of development of the communes. This paper argues that a serious analysis of the regiona-lization process should take into account the reform of the actual rural administrative system...|$|E

The papers are not definitive statements about research findings, but rather reflect interests and concerns of the authors, and they highlight {{a small part of}} contemporary debates in social gerontology. As four papers given by four individuals there was, of course, no attempt to develop a unified theme. This is evident, for example, {{in the way in which}} the political dimensions of <b>public</b> <b>allocations</b> are discussed. The opening paper makes the point that if ageing is seen as a problem, it is a political problem, first and foremost, and we have not yet understood how to legitimize the claims made by elderly people and find a political resolution of allocative mechanisms. The second paper points out that allocations are the result of partisan political debate and as such are subject to uncertainty, which can breed fear among aged people whose options are limited. Jamrozik suggests as a possible solution the establishment of an Income Maintenance Commission which would operate outside party political boundaries. In the third paper, Peter Sinnett goes a step further and argues strongly for the depoliticization of provisions in health and welfare. He argues that the strongest groups, the most articulate and those able to express their interests win in the political stakes, at the expense of the most disadvantaged and also at the expense of equitable co-ordinated services. What we need, says Sinnett, is moral leadership, not political leadership. Ian Webster's paper examines the creation of dependency, and his inverse law of need again highlights the political dimension of resource allocation. The "law" states that (a) for the individual, access to services decreases with increasing needs (unmet need is compounded), (b) for communities, the number of aged persons in need is inversely proportional to services provided...|$|E

The observed faulty <b>allocations</b> of <b>public</b> expenditures, coupled with weaknesses in the budgetary process suggest major potential gains for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of public expenditure program in ANRE.

Specifically, for both regimes, we calculate wait times for citizens who pay bribes and for those who do not. Second, we use these wait times to show that bribery is profitable for citizens with a high opportunity cost of time.

Finally, we conclude with some across-citizens and across-corruption regimes observations about the value of preemption, the benefit from bribery, and a measure of resource misallocation in the economy.

More precisely, our main purpose is to identify which sort of provinces were favoured with road construction expenditures and whether tactical strategies used by parties varied over time due to the increase in political competition. Thus, this paper links concepts from three strands of literature: legislative pork-barrel, clientelism and machine politics, and electoral competition. Our key empirical finding on a panel of Spain’s provinces suggests that those provinces that elected a large share of deputies belonging to minority or opposition parties were initially punished through lower levels of road investment {{but by the end of}} the period were favoured with more resources than the rest. On the other hand, we can also observe that “senior ” deputies were more capable than other politicians to attract resources to their constituencies...|$|R
