He then completed a few years of indentured servitude and moved south to find some land of his own.|$|R
40|$|Anatomical {{differences}} in the corpus callosum {{have been found in}} various psychiatric disorders, but data on the genetic contributions to these differences have been limited. The current study used morphometric MRI data to assess the heritability of corpus callosum size and the genetic correlations among anatomical sub-regions of the corpus callosum among individuals with and without mood disorders. The corpus callosum (CC) was manually segmented at the mid-sagittal plane in 42 women (healthy, n = 14; major depressive disorder, n = 15; bipolar disorder, n = 13) and their 86 child or adolescent offspring. Four anatomical sub-regions (CC-genu, CC 2, CC 3 and CC-splenium) and total CC were measured and analyzed. Heritability and genetic correlations were estimated using a variance components method, with adjustment for age, sex, diagnosis, and diagnosis <b>x</b> age, <b>where</b> <b>appropriate.</b> Significant heritability was found for several CC sub-regions (P, 0. 01), with estimated values ranging from 48 % (splenium) to 67 % (total CC). There were strong and significant genetic correlations among most sub regions. Correlations between the genu and mid-body, between the genu and total corpus callosum, and between anterior and mid body were all. 90 %, but no significant genetic correlations were detected between ventral and rostral regions in this sample. Genetic factors {{play an important role in}} corpus callosum size among individuals. Distinct genetic factors seem to be involved in caudal and rostral regions, consistent with the divergen...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{measurements of}} equilibrium radiation {{obtained in the}} NASA Ames Research Center's EAST facility and the University of Queensland's X 2 facility. These experiments were aimed at measuring the level of radiation encountered during conditions relevant to Orion lunar return into Earth's atmosphere. The facilities have targeted the same nominal test conditions of 10 km/s and 26. 6 Pa (0. 2 Torr). In addition, variations on the nominal shock speed have also {{been the focus of}} recent testing in the EAST facility. A comprehensive comparison between the EAST data and NEQAIR is presented in this paper with preliminary <b>X</b> 2 comparisons <b>where</b> <b>appropriate.</b> Since the two facilities have different dimensions, and the tests have different shock speeds, NEQAIR simulations are used as a point of reference for the EAST and X 2 comparison. Results obtained by independently reducing the data from both facilities are compared. The present analysis endeavors to provide {{a better understanding of the}} uncertainty in the measurements, as well as provide an initial comparison between EAST and X 2. Furthermore, the present analysis explores various radiative mechanisms to determine if they are due to physical processes relevant to flight, or are just facility dependent phenomena. These phenomena include effects such as the magnitude of the background continuum. © 2010 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc...|$|R
30|$|We then {{approximate}} locally {{the distribution}} of the clusters with a p-variate Gaussian and we build confidence regions around the centers of the clusters (see [9]). Following the approach stated in [3], which is motivated by the assumption that the mean is unlikely to move outside of the computed confidence interval, we perturb x̅_h by moving it in the farthest position from x in its confidence region, while we perturb the centers of the other clusters by moving them in the closest positions with respect to x and we check if the cluster center closer to x is still x̅_h. If yes, we assign x to cluster h, we update the corresponding summary statistics and we <b>put</b> <b>x</b> in the discard set; otherwise, we <b>put</b> <b>x</b> in the retained set (RS) (see Fig. 2). If in the first comparisons the point x is closer to a point x_o of the retained set than to any cluster, we form a new secondary cluster with the two points if x_o remains the closest to x after the centers’ perturbation. In this case we add the corresponding summary statistics to the compressed set CS, and we <b>put</b> <b>x</b> and x_o in the discard set. Otherwise we <b>put</b> <b>x</b> and x_o in RS (see Fig. 3).|$|R
