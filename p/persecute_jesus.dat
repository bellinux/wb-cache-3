5000|$|In 2001, {{while playing}} for the Knicks, it was {{discovered}} that Ward had made disparaging comments about Jews during a Bible-study session, comments that were eventually leaked to the press. Among the comments made: [...] "Jews are stubborn...tell me, why did they <b>persecute</b> <b>Jesus</b> unless He knew something they didn’t want to accept...They had His blood on their hands." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Jews {{begin to}} <b>persecute</b> <b>Jesus</b> (and in some texts, the gospel {{says that they}} seek to kill him). Anglican clergyman Charles Ellicott argued that [...] "the words 'and sought to slay Him' should be omitted. They have been {{inserted}} in some manuscripts to explain the first clause of [...] (the Jews sought the more to kill him)".|$|E
5000|$|Later, Jesus {{finds the}} man in the Temple, and tells him not to sin again, so that nothing worse happens to him. The man goes away and tells the Jewish people that it was Jesus who had made him well (. The Gospel account {{explains}} that the Jews began to <b>persecute</b> <b>Jesus</b> because he was healing on the Sabbath. He responds by saying that [...] "My Father is still working, and I also am working" [...] (. This assertion makes the Jews all the more determined to kill him, because not only is he breaking the Sabbath but he is making himself equal to God by calling God his father (...) [...]|$|E
5000|$|When {{one thinks}} of the {{opinions}} held concerning Christianity by our best minds a hundred, two hundred years ago, one is ashamed to realise how little we have since evolved. I didn't know that Julian the Apostate had passed judgment with such clear-sightedness on Christianity and Christians ... the Galilean, who later was called the Christ, intended something quite different. He must {{be regarded as a}} popular leader who took up His position against Jewry ... and it's certain that Jesus was not a Jew. The Jews, by the way, regarded Him as the son of a whore—of a whore and a Roman soldier. The decisive falsification of Jesus's doctrine was the work of St. Paul ... Paul of Tarsus (his name was Saul, before the road to Damascus) {{was one of those who}} <b>persecuted</b> <b>Jesus</b> most savagely." ...|$|R
2500|$|Early Mormon leaders Jedediah M. Grant, Orson Hyde, Joseph F. Smith and Orson Pratt stated it {{was part}} of their {{religious}} belief that Jesus Christ was polygamous, quoting this in their respective sermons. The Mormons also used an apocryphal passage attributed to the 2nd-century Greek philosopher Celsus: [...] "The grand reason why the gentiles and philosophers of his school <b>persecuted</b> <b>Jesus</b> Christ was because he had so many wives. There were Elizabeth and Mary and a host of others that followed him". This {{appears to have been a}} summary of a garbled or second-hand reference to a quote from Celsus the Platonist preserved in the apologistic work Contra Celsum ("Against Celsus") by the Church Father Origen: [...] "such was the charm of Jesus' words, that not only were men willing to follow Him to the wilderness, but women also, forgetting the weakness of their sex and a regard for outward propriety in thus following their Teacher into desert places." ...|$|R
5000|$|When Marulić {{completed}} his poem, he affixed a prose appendix to the work, {{known as the}} Tropologica Davidiadis Expositio ("A Tropological Explanation of the Davidiad"). The purpose of this addendum was to stress the poet's belief that David [...] "is a prototype or prefiguration of Christ" [...] and that [...] "all {{the events of the}} New Testament lie hidden and anticipated in the Old Testament". In other words, it was the view of Marulić that his work was an allegory, wherein David represented Christ (In omnibus fere Davidem puto personam gerere Christi), and Saul represented the Jews who <b>persecuted</b> <b>Jesus</b> (Saulem autem Iudeos, qui Christum persequebantur, significare). In this section, Marulić defends his work as orthodox and non-heretical. Unfortunately, as Miroslav Marcovich argues, [...] "it is not difficult to discover that Marulić's allegoric Tropology does indeed aberrare a relgionis nostrae fide from the faith of our religion"; for instance, how could the author contend that David is the [...] "prefiguration of Christ", Marcovich asks, when David committed such sins as adultery and murder? ...|$|R
5000|$|Greg Hicks {{plays the}} role of Pilate in the 2013 {{television}} mini-series The Bible, and the theatrical release entitled Son of God in 2014, as a stern and ruthless governor determined to keep the peace in Judea. In this depiction, fearing that Tiberius Caesar would blame him for any uprisings, Pilate massacres mobs of Jewish dissenters and threatens the Jewish religious authorities that he will cancel Passover and institute martial law in Jerusalem if disturbances continue, thus pushing them to <b>persecute</b> <b>Jesus</b> in order to avoid even more bloodshed. In turn, he feels pushed to accede to the demands of Caiaphas to have Jesus crucified despite his wife's warnings of the disturbing dreams she has had which convince her that Jesus is an innocent man. While he feels Jesus has too high an opinion of himself and is shown to be both a brutal governor and rabidly bigoted against the Jews, Pilate is uneasy about the persecution of Christ. He is initially hesitant toward applying a Roman punishment to a man who has committed no crime under Roman law, and even seems perturbed that the Jews would choose to release Barabbas over the preacher.|$|E
5000|$|In Table Talk, Hitler praised Julian the Apostate's Three Books Against the Galilaeans, an anti-Christian tract from AD 362, in {{the entry}} dated 21 October 1941, stating: [...] "When one thinks of the {{opinions}} held concerning Christianity by our best minds a hundred, two hundred years ago, one is ashamed to realise how little we have since evolved. I didn't know that Julian the Apostate had passed judgment with such clear-sightedness on Christianity and Christians. ... Originally, Christianity was merely an incarnation of Bolshevism the destroyer. Nevertheless, the Galilean, who later was called the Christ, intended something quite different. He must {{be regarded as a}} popular leader who took up His position against Jewry.... and it's certain that Jesus was not a Jew. The Jews, by the way, regarded Him as the son of a whore—of a whore and a Roman soldier. The decisive falsification of Jesus's doctrine was the work of St. Paul. He gave himself to this work with subtlety and for purposes of personal exploitation. For the Galilean's object was to liberate His country from Jewish oppression. He set Himself against Jewish capitalism, and that's why the Jews liquidated Him. Paul of Tarsus (his name was Saul, before the road to Damascus) {{was one of those who}} <b>persecuted</b> <b>Jesus</b> most savagely." ...|$|R
50|$|Kelhoffer spends part of {{his book}} “Persecution, Persuasion and Power” arguing that {{persecution}} in Luke-Acts {{is used by the}} author to accomplish three things: (1) question the legitimacy of the accusers, (2) confirm the legitimacy of the faithful accused, and (3) derive legitimacy for the author’s Gentile audience who might be suffering their own persecution. For example, in the story of Stephen’s martyrdom, Stephen links his accusers to those who resisted Moses (Acts 7:51-53), and his death is paralleled with Jesus’ (Acts 7:59-60). Acts 28:25-28 also provides strong encouragement and validation for Gentiles readers, while Acts 9:4-5 makes a direct link between the <b>persecuted</b> and <b>Jesus,</b> which further indicts any critics or persecutors of Christianity. Kelhoffer sees the author of Luke-Acts as turning the dishonor of persecution into an honor, placing those who suffer “on account of the Son of Man” (Luke 6:22 NSRV) in the legacy of Old Testament and Israelite salvation history.|$|R
5000|$|In , Paul {{states that}} the Churches in Judea had been persecuted by the Jews who killed Jesus and that such people displease God, oppose all men, and had {{prevented}} Paul from speaking to the gentile nations concerning the New Testament message. Described by Hyam Maccoby as [...] "the most explicit outburst against Jews in Paul's Epistles", these verses have repeatedly been employed for antisemitic purposes. Maccoby views {{it as one of}} Paul's innovations responsible for creating Christian antisemitism, though he notes that some have argued these particular verses are later interpolations not written by Paul. Craig Blomberg argues that viewing them as antisemitic is a mistake, but [...] "understandable in light of Paul's harsh words". In his view, Paul is not condemning all Jews forever, but merely those he believed had specifically <b>persecuted</b> the prophets, <b>Jesus,</b> or the 1st-century church. Blomberg sees Paul's words here as no different in kind than the harsh words the prophets of the Old Testament have for the Jews.|$|R
6000|$|And, my friends, {{the world}} would be quite right, and reasonable, and prudent, in telling us to push, and boast, and lie, and puff {{ourselves}} and our goods, {{if it were not for}} one thing which the foolish blind world is always forgetting, and that is, that there is a God who judges the earth. If God were not our King; if He took no care of us men and our doings; if mankind had it all their own way on earth, and were forced to shift for themselves without any laws of God to guide them, then the best thing every man could do would be to fight for himself; to get all he could for himself, and leave as little as he could for his neighbours; to make himself out as great, and wise, and strong, as he could, and try to make his neighbours buy him at his own price. That would be the best plan for every man, if God was not King; and therefore the world says that that is the best plan for every man, because the world does not believe that God is King, and hates the notion that God is King, and laughs at and <b>persecutes,</b> as <b>Jesus</b> Christ said it would, those who preach the kingdom of God, and tell men, as I tell you in God's name: [...] "You were not made to be selfish; you were not meant to rise in the world by boasting and pushing down and deceiving your neighbours. For you are subjects of God's kingdom; and to do so is to break his laws, and to put yourselves under His curse; and however worldly-wise all this selfishness and boasting may seem, it is sin, whose wages are death and ruin." ...|$|R
