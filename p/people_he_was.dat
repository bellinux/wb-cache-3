5|$|Al-Muwaffaq, {{suffering}} from gout, was already visibly nearing his end; the vizier Isma'il ibn Bulbul {{and the city}} commander of Baghdad, Abu'l-Saqr, called al-Mu'tamid and his sons, including the heir-apparent al-Mufawwad, into the city, hoping to exploit al-Muwaffaq's imminent death for their own purposes.
