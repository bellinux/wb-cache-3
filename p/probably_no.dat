5|$|Archidermaptera is {{believed}} to be sister to the remaining earwig groups, the extinct Eodermaptera and the living suborder Neodermaptera (= former suborders Forficulina, Hemimerina, and Arixeniina). The extinct suborders have tarsi with five segments (unlike the three found in Neodermaptera) as well as unsegmented cerci. No fossil Hemimeridae and Arixeniidae are known. Species in Hemimeridae were at one time in their own order, Diploglassata, Dermodermaptera, or Hemimerina. Like most other epizoic species, there is no fossil record, but they are <b>probably</b> <b>no</b> older than late Tertiary.|$|E
5|$|When Lancaster {{arrived at}} the town of Boroughbridge, Harclay was already in {{possession}} of the bridge crossing the river. The rebel forces counted <b>probably</b> <b>no</b> more than 700 knights and men-at-arms, against the 4,000 or so soldiers in the royal army. Lancaster initially tried to negotiate, but Harclay could not be swayed. Since there was no realistic alternative place to cross the river, and with the royal forces in pursuit from the south, the rebels {{had no choice but}} to fight. The ensuing battle was short and one-sided.|$|E
5|$|Adherents of Heathenry can {{be found}} in Europe, North America, and Australasia. They are mostly found in those areas with a Germanic {{cultural}} inheritance, although they are present in several other regions. In 2007, the religious studies scholar Graham Harvey stated {{that it was impossible to}} develop a precise figure for the number of Heathens across the world. A self-selected census in 2013 found 16,700 members in 98 countries, the bulk of whom lived in the United States. In 2016, Schnurbein stated that there were <b>probably</b> <b>no</b> more than 20,000 Heathens globally. She noted that, while there were some exceptions, most Heathen groups were 60–70% male in their composition.|$|E

5|$|Findings {{from the}} studies of {{children}} from Eastern European orphanages indicate that persistence of the inhibited pattern of RAD is rare in children adopted out of institutions into normative care-giving environments. However, there is a close association between duration of deprivation and severity of attachment disorder behaviors. The quality of attachments that these children form with subsequent care-givers may be compromised, but they <b>probably</b> <b>no</b> longer meet criteria for inhibited RAD. The same group of studies suggests that a minority of adopted, institutionalized children exhibit persistent indiscriminate sociability even after more normative caregiving environments are provided. Indiscriminate sociability may persist for years, even among children who subsequently exhibit preferred attachment to their new caregivers. Some exhibit hyperactivity and attention problems as well as difficulties in peer relationships. In the only longitudinal study that has followed children with indiscriminate behavior into adolescence, these children {{were significantly more likely}} to exhibit poor peer relationships.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} {{record of}} a foundation myth connecting Odysseus with Italy is the lines surviving in Hesiod's Theogony (1011ff.), which report that Odysseus and Circe had two sons Agrius and Latinus, who ruled over the Etruscans (Tyrsenoi). Latinus is an important figure in many early Italian myths. The lines are not in fact Hesiodic, but they are <b>probably</b> <b>no</b> later than the 6th century BC.|$|E
25|$|Artifacts {{have been}} found in both North and South America which have been dated to 14,000 years ago, and {{accordingly}} humans have been proposed to have reached Cape Horn at the southern tip of South America by this time.

25|$|By 400AD York's {{fortunes}} {{had changed}} for the worse. The town was undergoing periodic winter floods from the rivers Ouse and Foss, its wharf-side facilities were buried under several feet of silt and the primary Roman bridge connecting the town with the fortress may have become derelict. By this time Eboracum was <b>probably</b> <b>no</b> longer a population centre, though it likely remained a centre of authority. While the colonia remained above flood levels, it was largely abandoned as well, retaining only a small ribbon of population for a time.|$|E
25|$|Shrewsbury's batting {{was marked}} by extreme patience, unfailing judgment, and a mastery over the {{difficulties}} of the ground, of which <b>probably</b> <b>no</b> other batsman would have been capable. During the innings Shrewsbury became the first cricketer to score 1,000 Test runs. He added 81 in the second innings, but rain meant {{the result was a}} draw. He had scores of 66, 12 and 19 not out {{in the rest of the}} series as England retained the Ashes. Shrewsbury was the leading run scorer in the series with 284 at 71.00.|$|E
25|$|During the Renaissance, the {{development}} of mathematics and of accounting were intertwined. While {{there is no direct}} relationship between algebra and accounting, the teaching of the subjects and the books published often intended for the children of merchants who were sent to reckoning schools (in Flanders and Germany) or abacus schools (known as abbaco in Italy), where they learned the skills useful for trade and commerce. There is <b>probably</b> <b>no</b> need for algebra in performing bookkeeping operations, but for complex bartering operations or the calculation of compound interest, a basic knowledge of arithmetic was mandatory and knowledge of algebra was very useful.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 13th century, Bishop Thomas {{became the first}} known bishop of Finland. There were several secular powers who aimed to bring the Finnish tribes under their rule. These were Sweden, Denmark, the Republic of Novgorod in northwestern Russia, and {{probably}} the German crusading orders as well. Finns had their own chiefs, but most <b>probably</b> <b>no</b> central authority. At the time there can be seen three cultural areas or tribes in Finland: Finns, Tavastians and Karelians. Russian chronicles indicate there were several conflicts between Novgorod and the Finnic tribes from the 11th or 12th century to the early 13th century.|$|E

The Austrians captured two French officers and some soldiers in the town, as well as 200 sacks of flour. Total Austrian losses were <b>probably</b> <b>no</b> more than 50 casualties. Of these, the Carlstädter battalion lost only nine wounded. One authority estimated 250 French casualties. The 75th Line reported one officer killed and seven wounded or missing. Losses in {{the rank and file}} were 16 killed, 45 wounded, and 148 captured. These figures give a total of 217. Admitted losses in the 51st Line were two killed, six wounded, and two missing.|$|E

Năsturel and Maria's first son, Mateiaș, was born in 1635; some two weeks later, Maria died, leaving the child to be adopted by his godparents, Prince Matei and Princess Elena. He was groomed by the couple as Wallachia's heir-presumptive. Udriște later remarried, to a Despa, with whom he had another son, Radu Toma, and a daughter, Măricuța. He educated his second son at home, {{arranging}} him to be tutored in Latin by a scholar Teodor of Kiev. Radu Toma was also an early scribe for his manuscript of Barlaam and Josaphat.|$|E

25|$|Since the halakhic Midrashim had {{for their}} {{secondary}} purpose the exegesis of the Bible, they were arranged {{according to the}} text of the Pentateuch. As Genesis contains very little matter of a legal character, there was <b>probably</b> <b>no</b> halakhic midrash to this book. On the other hand, to each of the other four books of the Pentateuch there was a midrash from the school of R. Akiba and one from the school of R. Ishmael, and these midrashim are still in great part extant. The halakhic midrash to Exodus from the school of R. Ishmael is the Mekilta, while that of the school of R. Akiba is the Mekilta of R. Shimon bar Yochai, most of which is contained in the Midrash ha-Gadol.|$|E
25|$|In either 1144 or 1145 Eustace {{obtained}} from Ranulf a large honour with lands mostly in Cheshire, Lancashire and Yorkshire, and gained {{the office of}} constable of Chester along with the status as chief counselor in Ranulf's dominions. Earl Ranulf's patronage also seems to have gained Eustace a grant by Roger de Mowbray (the earl's captive from the Battle of Lincoln) of fourteen knight fees worth of estates in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire, with townships along the river Humber. This was probably part of the attempts of the earl and his half-brother the Earl of Lincoln William de Roumare to tighten their family's grip on the region. Eustace's position vis-a-vis Stephen probably mirrored that of Ranulf, and like other pro-Matildans there was <b>probably</b> <b>no</b> permanent stabilisation of relations until the settlement between Stephen and Matilda {{in the winter of}} 1153. In the following year, Eustace attested a charter King Stephen issued at York in favour of Pontefract Priory.|$|E
25|$|It is {{probable}} that Hesiod wrote his poems down, or dictated them, rather than passed them on orally, as rhapsodes did—otherwise the pronounced personality that now emerges from the poems would surely have been diluted through oral transmission from one rhapsode to another. Pausanias asserted that Boeotians showed him an old tablet made of lead on which the Works were engraved. If he did write or dictate, it was perhaps {{as an aid to}} memory or because he lacked confidence in his ability to produce poems extempore, as trained rhapsodes could do. It certainly wasn't in a quest for immortal fame since poets in his era had <b>probably</b> <b>no</b> such notions for themselves. However, some scholars suspect the presence of large-scale changes in the text and attribute this to oral transmission. Possibly he composed his verses during idle times on the farm, in the spring before the May harvest or the dead of winter.|$|E
