Around 40 people, including a few young families, lived in a dispersed settlement throughout the 4 acres of woodland. They used mainly reclaimed material to build living structures, solar power to generate electricity, wood burners for heat, cultivated some vegetables and kept chickens and geese. Water was obtained from springs on the site, and the village was largely hidden from view from outside the woodland. The members called themselves [...] "Diggers" [...] after the 17th-century movement of that name. There were two unsuccessful attempts to evict the settlers {{in the first year}} of occupation; and on 30 March 2015 a further High Court trespass notice was <b>served</b> <b>by</b> <b>bailiffs</b> on behalf of the landowners, Orchard Runnymede Ltd.

Specifically, the paper investigates the interpersonal and lifespan contexts of the abuse of disabled older people in caregiving relationships. It highlights the role of social exchange and interdependency in the causal processes of abuse, {{as well as in the}} prevention of abusive behaviour. It also recognises the value of understanding the patterns of conflict and exchange behaviour in the relationship throughout the lifespan. This contextualising <b>process</b> is <b>served</b> <b>by</b> making links between the literature on the abuse of older people and other related literatures, such as the family violence and family caregiving literatures...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} two paradigms {{from the}} area of implicit learning in detail. The literature suggests that the invariance detection paradigm of McGeorge and Burton (1990) gives rise to unconscious knowledge held at a conceptual level with the decision <b>process</b> <b>served</b> <b>by</b> a 'nearest-neighbour' similarity mechanism. The experiments in this thesis suggest that several aspects of this task do indeed seem to agree with present conceptions of unconscious knowledge but no evidence could be found that this knowledge is held at a conceptual level or that specific similarity plays any role in this task. Instead the experiments in this thesis suggest that this task may be better {{understood in terms of}} an abstraction mechanism which acquires perceptual information. Using the invariance detection paradigm, this thesis examines the effect of two types of task which measure performance above an 'objective threshold' of awareness. Performance on each task was not the same, suggesting that one cannot assume all direct tests measure the same knowledge despite being similar in nature. In addition, the finding that only the more sensitive of the two tasks could elicit information in the invariance detection paradigm suggests that the knowledge is extremely difficult to elicit. This also is a property of implicit learning and points to the digit invariance task being mediated by unconscious mechanisms. The finding of robust invariance detection in laboratory tasks suggests that one might expect to find similar learning for real world invariance. No evidence for this could be found, which suggests that either implicit learning is a laboratory artefact or that real world invariance learning does not operate {{in the same way that}} laboratory experiments suggest. These results suggest that laboratory experiments are required which replicate conditions under which real world learning might occur...|$|R

From the analysis of this stability region, we derive optimal partitions of space among server stations. Some specific subclasses of policies are also studied. Wireless communication networks provides a natural field of application for this model...|$|R
5000|$|The OGC Web Processing Service (WPS) Interface Standard {{provides}} {{rules for}} standardizing how {{inputs and outputs}} (requests and responses) for invoking geospatial processing services, such as polygon overlay, as a web service. The WPS standard defines how a client can request the execution of a process, and how the output from the process is handled. It defines an interface that facilitates the publishing of geospatial processes and clients’ discovery of and binding to those processes. The data required by the WPS can be delivered across a network or they can be available at the server. WPS can describe any calculation (i.e. process) including all of its inputs and outputs, and trigger its execution as a web service. WPS supports simultaneous exposure of processes via HTTP GET, HTTP POST, and SOAP, thus allowing the client to choose the most appropriate interface mechanism. The specific <b>processes</b> <b>served</b> up <b>by</b> a WPS implementation are defined by the owner of that implementation. Although WPS was designed to work with spatially referenced data, {{it can be used}} with any kind of data.|$|R

40|$|My central {{claim is}} that {{philosophers}} of mind {{have failed to}} take adequate account of empirical evidence regarding human consciousness and vision. Experiments on split-brain patients over {{the past fifty years}} reveal consciousness in both cerebral hemispheres. I claim specifically that (a) consciousness in the right hemisphere is inherited from our animal ancestors; (b) consciousness in the left hemisphere arose during human evolution in association with language; and (c) the existence of both forms of consciousness provides the best explanation for many aspects of normal human experience. Evidence for two cortical visual pathways in the human brain has been expanding for twenty years. The ventral pathway is specialised for object identification, and the dorsal pathway for the control of actions in respect of those objects. The evidence has been challenged by those who have failed (a) to distinguish between the visual pathways themselves and <b>processes</b> <b>served</b> <b>by</b> the pathways, and (b) to recognise the specific circumstances in which actions draw on one pathway. I claim that in the left hemisphere only the ventral pathway reaches consciousness. The combination of two visual pathways with two centres of consciousness challenges traditional views about perception. I claim that (a) perception is distinct from seeing; (b) perception is limited to the left hemisphere; and (c) the parallel process in the right hemisphere is associated with the emotions. The presence of two centres of consciousness challenges traditional views on the unity of consciousness and on personhood; but it also offers an explanation for conflicting views on the emotions and the existence of self-deception. I distinguish my claims about human consciousness from the Dual Systems (or Two Minds) Theory. Although there are superficial parallels, the latter theory denies that both systems/minds are conscious, and takes no account of the specialisation of the cerebral hemispheres revealed by experiments on split-brain patients. I conclude that philosophy must incorporate empirical evidence if it is to avoid claims of irrelevance...|$|R
40|$|When {{multiple}} job <b>processes</b> are <b>served</b> <b>by</b> {{a single}} scheduler, the queueing delays of one process are often {{affected by the}} others, resulting in a timing side channel that leaks the arrival pattern of one process to the others. In this work, we study such a timing side channel between a regular user and a malicious attacker. Utilizing Shannon’s mutual information {{as a measure of}} information leakage between the user and attacker, we analyze privacy-preserving behaviors of common work-conserving schedulers. We find that the attacker can always learn perfectly the user’s arrival process in a longest-queue-first (LQF) scheduler. When the user’s job arrival rate is very low (near zero), first-come-first-serve (FCFS) and round robin schedulers both completely reveal the user’s arrival pattern. The near-complete information leakage in the low-rate traffic region is proven to be reduced by half in a work-conserving version of TDMA (WC-TDMA) scheduler, which turns out to be privacy-optimal in the class of deterministic-working-conserving (det-WC) schedulers, according to a universal lower bound on information leakage we derive for all det-WC schedulers.

40|$|The damage induced in the {{mitochondria}} of rat liver during intoxication by {{carbon tetrachloride}} is prevented {{by the administration}} of chloramphenicol early in the intoxication. The possibility that the protective ability of chloramphenicol lies in the compound's ability to inhibit mitochondrial protein synthesis was eliminated {{by the failure of}} other inhibitors of mitochondrial protein synthesis, namely Tevenel, a chloramphenicol analog, and oxytetracycline, to prevent mitochondrial damage. Conversely, the optical isomer of chloramphenicol, which is not an inhibitor of mitochondrial protein synthesis, and does not possess antibiotic activity, does prevent mitochondrial damage during intoxication by CCl 4. SKF 525 A also preserves mitochondrial integrity, albeit not as well as chloramphenicol. Chloramphenicol, early in the course of intoxication, partially prevents the characteristic loss of protein synthesis after CCl 4.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2013 A {{major concern}} in {{operations}} and {{supply chain management}} research has been to determine optimal policies to minimize costs in production and inventory systems. This dissertation consists of two applications of production-inventory systems motivated by the real world observations. The first model is motivated by a high-tech company data center server inventory control process. The firm has internalized the production process and faces server returns at the same time. There are demands for both new and used products. Returned servers {{can be used to}} serve the demand for use products directly, or be remanufactured into new condition by the same production capacity. Unmet demands are lost. The objective is to determine the optimal scheduling policy that minimizes the discounted total cost. We model the system with a production-inventory model with returns and show the optimal production inventory policy is of base stock type. Efficient heuristics are proposed and the base model is extended to scenarios that better described the real world situation. These scenarios include unmet demand are backordered, bulk demands and returns depending on the demands. The second model analyzes a model of a continuous-time production-inventory system with a shared server serving two demands. Unsatisfied demands are backordered and standard holding and penalty costs apply at each inventory location. The objective is to determine the optimal scheduling policy that minimizes the discounted total cost. The distinguishing feature of our model is that the two demand classes differ in their variability characteristics. The motivation for analyzing such a system is driven by our observations in many real-life contexts where such a difference is reported to exist. Very briefly, practical examples of why the variability of two demand <b>processes,</b> <b>served</b> <b>by</b> the same capacity, may differ include (1) inherent differences in the predictability of the demand, (2) some customers' spiky purchasing pattern influenced by low prices during promotions, (3) mixing emergency and scheduled demands, and (4) the nature of two different markets. Our results allow us to shed some light on implications for managers in such circumstances...|$|R
