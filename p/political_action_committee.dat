40|$|Empirical {{public choice}} {{literature}} and casual observation {{suggest that the}} behavior of <b>political</b> <b>action</b> <b>committees</b> is remarkably unsophisticated, meaning that <b>political</b> <b>action</b> <b>committees</b> give to those legislators who would support their interests anyway. Thus, {{it is suggested that}} contributor behavior deviates from rational behavior, which is a cornerstone of economic analysis. In this paper, a switching regression model is estimated that allows for strategies of <b>political</b> <b>action</b> <b>committees</b> to vary for different contribution recipients. The author analyzes the behavior of farm <b>political</b> <b>action</b> <b>committees</b> over three election cycles. In contrast to previous findings, he finds that contributor behavior is not inconsistent with rational behavior. Copyright 1992 by University of Chicago Press. ...|$|R
