5|$|Adams {{is home to}} {{the oldest}} {{building}} on the Gifford Pinchot National Forest, the Gotchen Creek Guard Station just south of the A. G. Aiken Lava Bed. Built in 1909, it served as the administrative headquarters of the Mount Adams District until 1916. It was built along a major grazing trail to allow for easy monitoring of the thousands of sheep grazed on the lower slopes. Later, in the 1940s, as the amount of grazing decreased, the station housed the Forest Guards responsible for the area. In 2008, it was wrapped in <b>protective</b> <b>foil</b> as a precautionary method to shield it from a large wildfire, the Cold Springs Fire, although the fire did not come near enough to burn it. Wildfires in 2012 (Cascade Creek Fire) and 2015 (Cougar Creek Fire) also required this precaution, and neither of them came close enough either.|$|E
50|$|In 2010 {{appeared}} the first non-rechargeable disposable paper-based electronic transit passes {{for a certain}} number amount of trips on trams, trolleybuses and buses. They are sold with a <b>protective</b> <b>foil</b> sticker, which should be removed prior to first use. They are not time-limited except that they expire 30 days after the countrywide or citywide fare changes, which happens usually each 1-2 years.|$|E
50|$|The EBC machine used in {{the curing}} process gives the {{finished}} HPL boards a surface that is both color-fade resistant and has a high resistance to damage. The process works by first mixing color pastes to the desired color and then applying it to a single sheet of kraft paper. This substrate is then put in the EBC machine together with a <b>protective</b> <b>foil.</b> In the machine this sheet is then shot with electrons at such high velocity that the color impregnated paper hardens almost instantly. After being stored in a temperature-controlled room for a short duration the sheets are ready to be adhered to unfinished HPL boards in a process called dry forming.|$|E
30|$|The blow film {{extrusion}} {{is the core}} process for the factory “film_extr”. Single- and multi-layer films are extruded from the granules mainly consisting of polyethylene. Similar to the profile_extr polymer they are dried before processing. There are 13 blow film extruders with one or multiple screws for the multi-layer films. The films are used for the manufacturing of the bags and <b>protective</b> <b>foils</b> in the automotive industry. The customisation is limited to roll up, cutting by welding and packaging processes.|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{the failure}} of a {{stainless}} steel (SS) pipeline supplying hydrogen to a hydro cracking reactor of a petrochemical industry is investigated. Leakage was observed in the pipeline during operation. Study revealed that the failure was by chloride stress corrosion cracking. The source of chlorine was found to be the glass wool that was wrapped on the pipeline for thermal insulation purpose. Use of SS foil beneath the thermal insulator facilitated condensation of chloride ions. The <b>protective</b> SS <b>foil</b> was destroyed by pitting corrosion followed by which the pipeline failed by stress corrosion cracking. A detailed analysis of the failure is presented in this paper...|$|R
50|$|At Gressenhall, all the {{carefully}} prepared <b>protective</b> paper, <b>foil</b> and plaster {{was removed from}} the bones. The concreted soil and sediment were removed with brushes, small dental tools, pins, scalpels and fine jets of high-pressure air containing slightly abrasive powder. All this work was done under a microscope, even on the biggest of the bones, to ensure that no damage was done to the surfaces of the bones. During this process it was discovered that the carcass of the elephant had been scavenged by spotted hyenas (shown by the teeth marks found on the bones) and also hyena droppings were identified. Some interesting pathology revealed that the elephant had a diseased and deformed right knee, which was likely to be the cause of this relatively young animal's demise.|$|R

5000|$|One of {{the main}} attractions in the {{settlement}} is the artificial Kačarevo Lake (Качаревачко језеро). It is stuated 1 km southeast {{of the center of}} Kačarevo on the location of the former cattle cemetery, colloquially called the [...] "horse graveyard". The denizens organized themselves and from 2007 began cleaning the area from the underbrush and eventually dug a lakebed. The surrounding area was adapted into the square green oasis with the forested alleys of pines, firs and deciduous trees. The benches and tables are placed between the trees. There are lawns with the rose seedlings, gazebos and a pheasant farm within the complex. The lake itself has a fountain which constantly pours the fresh water into the lake, a springboard, the showers, sunbeds, parasols and a lifeguard service. The lake was renovated in 2015 when the <b>protective</b> <b>foil</b> on the lakebed was replaced and part of the bed was concreted.|$|E
40|$|Transparent heat <b>protective</b> <b>foil</b> {{consists}} of a plastic foil and a selectively reflecting alternating layer system on an abrasion protective layer. The novelty is that the layer system {{consists of}} corrosion-resistant metal, oxide, nitride and/or oxynitride layers and the abrasion protective layer {{consists of a}}t least 1 (pref. 2 - 5) mu m thick, highly transparent and homogeneous amorphous oxide layer having a high packing density on a microhardness of at least 4 (pref. 5 - 10) GPa. Production of a transparent heat <b>protective</b> <b>foil</b> is also claimed. USE - The foil {{can be applied to}} outside surfaces of car and building windows. ADVANTAGE - The foil has high service life...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} requirements to existing heat-insulation layers in enclosure structures of wall panels has been carried out, a general principles on development of thermal insulation systems, substantiation on the necessity {{to develop a new}} wall panel design with improved thermal characteristics. The proposed design of the wall panel differs from the existing one in the fact that its external layer is made of protective sheets being perforated in their top and bottom parts with perforated aluminum foil layer placed on them. Air layer performs function of one of thermal insulation layers, and the second layer is made up in the form of several micro-modular sub-layers which are divided by perforated aluminum foil and a grid. An inner concrete layer is also separated from micro-modular layers by aluminum <b>foil.</b> <b>Protective</b> sheets and the grid can be made of aluminum or polyethylene. The arrangement of hollow micro-modular cells in the zone of negative temperatures prevents condensate accumulation. The arrangement of the perforated aluminum foil layers between micro- modular layers leads to increase in thermal resistance of the panel due to decrease of a radiant component in presence of several screens and does not interfere with a vapor permeability of thermal insulation layers from micro-modules. At the same time placement of a non-perforated foil layer on an inside panel layer interferes with penetration of water vapor from rooms in micro-modular thermal insulation layers. Technological principles lie in the arrangement of perforation slots in the top and bottom zones of protective sheets that allows to delete excess moisture from thermal insulation layers and air layer and also leads to improvement of thermo-technical characteristics, durability and reliability in construction operation as a whole. The executed calculations of heat and humidity fields in external enclosure structures confirm advantages of the presented technical solution. </p...|$|R
40|$|We {{developed}} and evaluated a user-friendly latex agglutination assay for the serodiagnosis of human brucellosis. The assay {{was obtained by}} coating colored latex beads with Brucella lipopolysaccharides and drying of the activated beads onto white agglutination cards. Individual cards were sealed in a <b>protective</b> <b>foil</b> to secure stability of the dried reagent and to obtain a test in a single assay format. The latex agglutination assay is simply performed by suspending the dried latex reagent in a drop of serum and looking for macroscopic agglutination of the latex beads by visual inspection. Results are obtained within 30 s after mixing the sample with the test reagent. The sensitivity of the assay {{was determined to be}} 89. 1 % (95 % confidence interval [CI], 76 - 96) for the initial serum samples collected from patients with culture-confirmed brucellosis and the specificity is 98. 2 % (95 % CI, 96 - 99). The assay is ideal for use as a field test in remote areas and as point-of-care test in hospitals and health care centers that lack the expertise and facilities to perform the more demanding classic serologic test...|$|E
40|$|AbstractVacuum {{insulation}} panels (VIP) combine high {{thermal performance}} with minor thickness making them fit for building retrofit. However, {{consisting of a}} fumed silica core at low air pressure (near vacuum) encapsulated by a protective aluminum containing covering, they are prone to puncturing which inadvertedly increases the internal air pressure and thus worsens the thermal performance. In addition to failure by puncturing, it remains unclear under which hygric circumstances VIPs degrade in time and how this {{is influenced by the}} Sd-value of the <b>protective</b> <b>foil</b> and thermal performance of the VIP. Therefore in this study the behavior of VIPs was monitored under various climates for measurement periods up to several years, allowing for a realistic assessment of the Sd-value of the foils and the degradation in time. Frequent gravimetric measurements were performed on 46 VIPs stored under ambient conditions and in climate chambers for periods up to 4 years. Based on EN ISO 12572 [1] the equivalent μd-values of the MF- 2 foils were determined. Comparing measurement results to literature it is found that water vapor diffusion resistances μ are in the range of 2. 66 – 7. 03. 10 ^ 7 for MF- 2 type foils. Overall, it can be concluded that hygrothermal loading for extended periods has a limited effect on the stability of the foil in time, ensuring the applicability of VIPs in building components...|$|E
