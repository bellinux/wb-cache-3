40|$|Comprehensive {{sampling}} of meiofauna {{along the northern}} continental slope in the Gulf of Mexico has revealed a diverse kinorhynch fauna of undescribed species. The present contribution includes the description of two new species of the cyclorhagid genus Echinoderes. Echinoderes augustae sp. nov. is recognized {{by the presence of}} acicular spines in middorsal <b>positions</b> <b>on</b> segments 4 to 8, and in lateroventral <b>positions</b> <b>on</b> segments 6 to 9, tubes in lateroventral <b>positions</b> <b>on</b> segments 2 and 5, midlateral <b>positions</b> <b>on</b> segment 4, and in sublateral <b>positions</b> <b>on</b> segment 8. It furthermore has glandular cell outlets type 2 in subdorsal positions of segment 2, a middorsal protuberance-like extension from the intersegmental border between segments 10 and 11, and conspicuously short and stout lateral terminal spines. Echinoderes skipperae sp. nov. has acicular spines in middorsal <b>positions</b> <b>on</b> segments 4, 6 and 8, and in lateroventral <b>positions</b> <b>on</b> segments 8 and 9, tubes in sublateral and ventrolateral <b>positions</b> <b>on</b> segment 2, in lateroventral <b>positions</b> <b>on</b> segment 5, in lateral accessory <b>positions</b> <b>on</b> segment 8, and in laterodorsal <b>positions</b> <b>on</b> segment 10. The species can furthermore be recognized by its conspicuously well-developed pachycycli at the anterior segment margins of segments 2 to 10, and margins of sternal plates facing the midsternal junctions of segments 3 to 10...|$|R

5|$|Documents {{regarding}} the artwork's commissioning survive and, unusually for a Netherlandish altarpiece, the artist, patron, place of installation and {{date of completion}} are all known. It was intended as the centrepiece for the chapel, and Rolin approached van der Weyden around 1443, when the hospital was founded. The altarpiece was ready by 1451, the year the chapel was consecrated. Painted in van der Weyden's Brussels workshop– most likely {{with the aid of}} apprentices – the completed panels were then transported to the hospice. The altarpiece is first mentioned in a 1501 inventory, when it was <b>positioned</b> <b>on</b> the high altar.|$|E
