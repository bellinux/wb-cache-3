5|$|By 1990, 52,000 black {{families}} had been settled on 6.5 million acres. This was insufficient {{to deal with}} the country's overcrowding problem, which was being exacerbated by the growth in the black population. That year, Zimbabwe's parliament passed an amendment allowing the government to expropriate land at a fixed price while denying land-owners the right of appeal to the courts. The government hoped that by doing so it could settle 110,000 {{black families}} on 13 million acres, which would require the expropriation of approximately half of all white-owned land. Zimbabwe's Commercial Farmers Union argued that the <b>proposed</b> <b>measures</b> would wreck the country's economy, urging the government to instead settle landless blacks on the half-a-million acres of land that was either unproductive or state-owned.|$|E

30|$|We have {{presented}} a novel similarity measure between two text documents. For each pairwise comparison between two documents, the term weights {{and the number}} of present terms contribute to the similarity between both related vectors. Moreover, the <b>proposed</b> <b>measure</b> satisfies preferable properties for a similarity measure. For example, the larger the number of presence-absence terms, the more dissimilar the two documents are. We also added a new property to these preferable properties: the similarity degree should increase when the number of present terms increases. This property is also satisfied by our <b>proposed</b> <b>measure.</b> To investigate the effectiveness of our <b>proposed</b> <b>measure,</b> we applied it in kNN classification, K-means clustering, and the shingling algorithm for near-duplicates detection on two real-world document collections. We also used the new similarity measure in different term weighting schemes. Our <b>proposed</b> <b>measure</b> yields better results than other popular measures of similarity.|$|R

25|$|The {{potency of}} the {{personal}} self and relational ties distinguish identity fusion from other forms of alignment with groups, such as “group identification”. In group identification, allegiance to the collective eclipses the personal self and relational ties to other group members. Because of this, the personal self and relational ties are not as involved in theories of group identification. Identity fusion theorizes that fusion measures should be more predictive of extreme pro-group behavior than previously <b>proposed</b> <b>measures</b> of identification. In fact, there is growing evidence of this. Measures of identity fusion are particularly powerful predictors of personally costly pro-group behaviors, including endorsement of extreme behaviors, such as fighting and dying for the group.|$|E

At King George V's insistence, Admiral Sir John Kelly, who was popular with the fleet, was brought out of retirement to take command of the Atlantic Fleet, and the cabinet, acting on Field's advice, hurriedly reconsidered its budget: the pay cuts were restricted to 10% rather than 25%. During the early months of this crisis, Field suffered a perforated ulcer.|$|E
25|$|On 23 March 2011, {{ten days}} after the {{hydrogen}} explosions, {{the recommendations of the}} Nuclear Safety Commission of Japan to protect the people living near the exploded Fukushima reactors were put aside by the Japanese government. The <b>proposed</b> <b>measures</b> were based on the results provided by a computer program named SPEEDI (System for Prediction of Environmental Emergency Dose Information). This program was specially designed to predict the spread of radioactive materials after a nuclear accident. The proposed measurements included evacuations and administering iodine tablets to people to minimize their intake of radioactive iodine. However, the office of the Prime Minister decided that {{ten days after}} the explosions it was too late, and did not act on the proposals. These facts came to light in the first weeks of December 2011, when a government panel examined the details about the delay in utilizing the data produced by SPEEDI.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel mechanism {{to analyze and}} summarize the statistical correlations among the attributes of a data cube. To perform the analysis and summarization, this paper <b>proposes</b> a new <b>measure</b> of statistical significance. The main reason for <b>proposing</b> the new <b>measure</b> of statistical significance {{is to have an}} essential closure property, which is exploited in the summarization stage of the data mining process. In addition to the closure property, the <b>proposed</b> <b>measure</b> of statistical significance has two other important properties. First, the <b>proposed</b> <b>measure</b> of statistical significance is more conservative than the well-known chi-square test in classical statistics and, therefore, inherits its statistical robustness. This paper does not simply employ the chi-square test due to lack of the desired closure property, which may lead to a precision problem in the summarization process. The second additional property is that, though the <b>proposed</b> <b>measure</b> of statistical significance is more conservative than the chi-square test, for most cases, the <b>proposed</b> <b>measure</b> yields a value that is almost equal to a conventional measurement of statistical significance based on the normal distribution. Based on the closure property addressed above, this paper develops an algorithm to summarize the results from performing statistical analysis in the data cube. Though the <b>proposed</b> <b>measure</b> of statistical significance avoids the precision problem due to having the closure property, its conservative nature may lead to a recall rate problem in the data mining process. On the other hand, if the chi-square test, which does not have the closure property, was employed, then the summarization process may suffer a precision problem...|$|R

The first bill proposed was the Combating Terrorism Act of 2001, which was introduced by Republican Senators Orrin Hatch (R-UT) and Jon Kyl (R-AZ) with Democratic Senators Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) and Chuck Schumer (D-NY) on September 13. Among its <b>proposed</b> <b>measures,</b> it ordered a report on the readiness of the National Guard to pre-emptively disrupt domestic acts of terrorism that used {{weapons of mass destruction and}} called for long-term research and development into terrorist attacks. It also called for a review of the authority of Federal agencies to address terrorist acts, proposed a change that would have allowed the CIA to recruit terrorist informants and proposed to allow law enforcement agencies to disclose foreign intelligence that was discovered through wiretaps and other interception methods. The amendment proposed a Sense of Congress that not enough was being done to impede and investigate terrorist fundraising, and sought to increase measures to prevent the laundering of the proceeds of terrorism.|$|E

40|$|Multiagent {{application}} systems {{must deal}} with various changes in both the system and the system environment at runtime. Generally, such changes have undesirable negative effects on the system.

This paper focuses on the design of this function and proposes a new macroscopic measure with which to observe behavioral characteristics of a runtime multiagent system. The <b>proposed</b> <b>measure</b> is designed as the variance of fluctuation of a macroscopic activity factor of the whole system, based on theoretical analysis of the macroscopic behavioral model of a multiagent system. Experiments are conducted to investigate basic characteristics of the <b>proposed</b> <b>measure,</b> using a test bed system.

Around the same time, analysis conducted by the Livermore National Laboratory and RAND Corporation at Teller's instruction found that the seismic effect of an underground test could be artificially dampened (referred to as [...] "decoupling") to the point that a 300-kiloton detonation would appear in seismic readings as a one-kiloton detonation. These findings were largely affirmed by pro-ban scientists, including Bethe. The third blow to the verification negotiations was provided by a panel chaired by Robert Bacher, which found that even on-site inspections would have serious difficulty determining whether an underground test had been conducted.|$|E
