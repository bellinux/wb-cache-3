40|$|This study {{includes}} {{an analysis of}} the trawl survey that was carried out by the Kainji Lake Fisheries Promotion Project in May, 1997. The objective of the survey was to assess the biomass and the potential yield of clupeids and the carrying capacity of the beach seine fishery in the entire Kainji Lake (Nigeria). The biomass of the beach seine by-catch was also estimated. The density (kg /km super(3)) of the clupeids was higher in the Bussa and Foge than in the other stations. The lowest density of clupeids was in the Anfani station followed by Jetty, both in the southern basin. These stations were the deepest parts of all the areas trawled, measuring between 37 - 120 m of depth. There was an inverse correlation between depth trawled and the catch rates of clupeids, though the correlation was poor. The average annual biomass of the clupeids was estimated at 36, 769. 85 Mt in the entire Lake with an MSY of 11, 705. 95 Mt. The smaller species, Sierrathrissa leonensis, made up about 97 % of the total clupeid population in the lake and occurred at a shallower depth than the larger species Pellonula afzeliusi. From the clupeid production statistics in 1996, it is estimated that the MSY is already overshot by 34 %. Therefore, about 698 beach seines instead of the present 810 would be sufficient for sustainable exploitation of the clupeid stocks. Because of the substantial by-catch in the beach seines, this fishing method was banned from Kainji Lake in 1997. An offshore open water seine net is recommended to replace the beach seines on the lake. The number of these nets should not exceed 500. The current ban on beach seine is supported by this study. Nevertheless, and since the ban may not be 100 % effective, effort should concentrate on maintaining that the number of beach seines must be kept at most at the present level. Recommendation is made against the introduction of the <b>pair</b> <b>trawling</b> <b>not</b> only from an economic point of view but also for resource conservation, legal and social reasons. The development of this fishery could pose a serious danger to continuity of stocks. It is proposed that priority be given to the development of an open water seine which is at the same level of exploitation as the beach seine and requires similar cost to acquire.

50|$|Because of the {{increased}} efficiency of <b>pair</b> <b>trawling,</b> vessels are able to tow their gears in mid-water at a faster speed to target species which are normally able to escape trawl nets, such as the European seabass.

40|$|Pelagic <b>pair</b> <b>trawling</b> for tuna, Thunnus spp., and swordfish, Xiphias gladius, was {{introduced}} in U. S. Northwest Atlantic waters in 1991. During autumn (October-November) of 1992 under the authority oft he Federal Atlantic Swordfish Regulations, the National Marine Fisheries Service placed observers aboard pelagic <b>pair</b> <b>trawl</b> vessels to document the catch, bycatch, discard, and gear used in this new fishery. The fishery is conducted primarily at night along shelf-edge waters from June to November. In late 1991, revised regulations restricted swordfish to bycatch in this fishery resulting in pelagic <b>pair</b> <b>trawl</b> vessels targeting tuna throughout 1992. Analyses of 1992 data indicate that albacore, T. alalunga, was the predominant species caught, although yellowfin tuna, T. albaeares, and bigeye tuna, T. obesus, were the preferred target species. Bycatch also included swordfish, large sharks, pelagic rays and other pelagic fishes, other tunas, and marine mammals...|$|R

50|$|<b>Pair</b> <b>trawling</b> is {{effective}} on all demersal species.

40|$|The lucrative {{external}} market for shrimp and constant {{rise in the}} mechanised <b>trawl</b> fishing fleets <b>not</b> only enhanced the marine fish production of our country but also showed {{the way for the}} growth of an organised sea food export industry and increase in employment opportunities in the subsidiary sector. In this context, a study was undertaken at nagapattinam centre of Tamil Nadu coast where the operation of ordinary trawlers and pair trawlers is common. The study indicates that pomfrets contributed to more than 50 per cent of the revenue of pair trawlers and prawns about 50 percent of the revenue of trawlers. The <b>pair</b> <b>trawling</b> further provided a new technique to fishermen of this region to harvest the hitherto underexploited valuable resources like pomfrets, rays, croakers, clupeids, carangids and perches in substantial quantity. The introduction of single and two boats high opening <b>trawl</b> nets <b>not</b> only served as diversification of the existing bottom trawling but also directed to redeploy many units to catch commercially important finfishes depending upon the seasonal abundance.
