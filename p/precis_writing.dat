40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} role of pragmatic {{macro-structure}} in writing a précis. Macro-structure is a theory of pragmatic representations for global discourse structure and its function {{is to reduce the}} propositions of a text by eliminating the unnecessary propositions and organize the propositions in order to produce an effective <b>précis.</b> <b>Writing</b> a précis requires making an intelligent gist of a long text. In order to comprehend the text, the reader should follow specific strategies and macro rules such as: Deletion, Generalization and construction...|$|E
40|$|Background {{knowledge}} and learners ' familiarity with formal schematic knowledge is of primary importance for EFL learners in writing an acceptable summary. Schema theory can help instructors {{focus on the}} discrepancy between the prior {{knowledge and}} experience that students bring to the learning task and the skills that are needed to successfully carry out and complete the particular learning task. The objective of this research is to explore the role of formal schemata in the development of EFL learners' précis writing; therefore, it is hypothesized that familiarity with the formal schematic knowledge of the texts will result in better performances of the EFL learners in <b>précis</b> <b>writing.</b> To answer the proposed question, we chose two intermediate-level classes in "Zaban Sara " language center, each comprising 30 female students, one as a control group and the other as experimental group. The control group received no special treatment, while the experimental group received the treatment which was familiarization with formal schematic knowledge of the texts. The findings of the study indicated clearly that the experimental group learners performed better in their précis than the control group. The drawn implication of this study was that not all of the writing problems of the students were {{due to the lack of}} needed formal schemata but that, the existent schemata must be activated by the help of the teacher to improve the writing process...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Previous {{studies have}} shown that the phonological deficits that characterise {{dyslexia}} persist into adulthood. There is a growing number of dyslexic students in higher education for whom sensitive diagnostic tests of their reading and reading related difficulties are required. AIMS: The main aim of this study was to compare the cognitive skills of dyslexic students with those of their non-dyslexic peers, and to ascertain the impact of cognitive difficulties on their study skills. A second aim was to produce guidelines for the assessment of dyslexia in higher education. SAMPLE: The performance of 23 dyslexic students was compared with that of a comparison group of 50 students from the same university who did not report a history of reading difficulty. METHOD: Participants completed standardised tests of IQ, reading, spelling and arithmetic and tests tapping phonological processing, verbal fluency and speed of processing. Their performance on a set of study-related tasks including proof reading and <b>précis</b> <b>writing</b> was also assessed and they completed the Brown ADD scales. RESULTS: Although dyslexic students did not differ in general cognitive ability from controls, they had deficits in reading and reading related phonological processes. Discriminant function analyses indicated that dyslexia in adulthood can be confirmed with 95 % accuracy using only four tests: spelling, nonword reading, digit span and writing speed. CONCLUSIONS: The study highlighted the difficulties of dyslexic adults. The persisting difficulties of dyslexic students that affect their study skills need to be recognised by HE institutions so that appropriate support programmes can be put in place...|$|E
40|$|To have {{a clearer}} {{idea of the}} {{problems}} students with dyslexia may face during their studies, we compared writings of 100 students with dyslexia and 100 age matched control students in higher education. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the writing of young adults with dyslexia and young adults without dyslexia. The study was carried out in Belgium with writers of Dutch. First, we studied the number and type of spelling errors, the quality of the texts produced, the use of words, and the handwriting, both in a <b>precis</b> <b>writing</b> task (writing a summary of an informative text) and in a dictation task (sentence writing). Our results showed medium to large effect sizes for spelling errors: d = 0. 93 for morphosyntactic spelling errors, d = 0. 55 for memory-related spelling errors, and a medium effect size for punctuation and capitalization errors, d = 0. 40. Second, experts who were blind to the aims of the study were asked to judge the quality of the writing of both groups based on transcriptions that were free from spelling errors. The quality of the texts produced was judged lower for students with dyslexia than for the controls, d = 0. 61 for text structure and d = 0. 56 for agreeability, even though the number and types of words used by both groups were very much the same. There was no significant difference in the quality of the handwriting, d = 0. 15. Given that remedial teaching has been shown to be effective for essay-writing skills, educational support along these lines may be helpful for students with dyslexia...|$|E

5000|$|In [...] "The Adventure of the Other Brother", {{included}} in The Papers of Sherlock Holmes Volume II by David Marcum (2011, 2013) Holmes and Watson travel to Yorkshire in 1896 to defend Holmes's older brother, Sherrinford, from {{a charge of}} murder, as first briefly mentioned {{at the conclusion of}} William S. Baring-Gould's biography, Sherlock Holmes of Baker Street. While there, they encounter Sherrinford's youngest son, 16-year-old Siger Holmes (named after his grandfather). Siger looks like a young Sherlock Holmes, and also shows a remarkable facility for deduction. After the solution of the mystery, an extended epilogue relates how Siger Holmes, with the blessing of his uncle, also became a consulting detective, and eventually chose to be called [...] "Solar Pons" [...] in order to make his own name, instead of relying on that of his famous uncle. An explanation is also given stating how the name [...] "Solar Pons" [...] was chosen, {{and a number of other}} biographical details match those listed by Derleth in a short <b>précis</b> that he <b>wrote</b> describing Pons's background.|$|R
40|$|The study aims at {{evaluating}} {{the performance of}} the grammatical and lexical abilities of Iraqi EFL undergraduates in <b>writing</b> <b>précis</b> for reading comprehension passages. (64) male and female second- year students from English Dep. College of Education-of Babylon University were chosen as the sample of the study during the academic year (2012 - 2013). A written test form was constructed to be the tool for the research study. The test form consisted of an unseen passage followed by a question to <b>write</b> a <b>précis</b> for the presented passage. The testees were provided with instructions to determine the starting and the end points of the précis. The testees were required to mention the steps to be followed to <b>write</b> their <b>précis</b> including the key words of the ideas to be included in their précis, their grammatical devices used in formulating their précis and their own vocabulary used the précis. The respodents showed low frequency use of the grammatical devices for reduction which indicates that the testees were not adequately trained to utlize their grammatical knowledge in such a productive peice of writing whereby garmmar is utilized to compress sentences for reduction. The respondents also showed low succeeeded scores in using cohesive devices to join the sentences of the required precis due to The inability of the testees to utilze their grammatical knowledge to choose the correct conjunction to join sentences and misunderstanding the ideas in the presented passage which causes the inability to discover the shared meaning among them when joining is done accordingly. Above all, the respondents showed very low succeeded results in utlizing their vocabulary store to achieve word economy which clearly indicates that the testees have poor vocabulary store that makes them less felixable to express the ideas of the presented passage in their own words. ...|$|R
