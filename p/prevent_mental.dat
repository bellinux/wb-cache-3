A preliminary version of the manual was assessed for face validity by two focus groups. The final version was evaluated for acceptability among 253 students in 10 high schools and 1 middle school in Italy. RESULTS. The manual included 18 chapters (or "units") which address skills for enabling students to cope with their daily lives: communication skills, problem-solving, assertive skills, negotiation, stress management, anger management and conflict resolution.

40|$|This chapter aims {{to explore}} the {{possibilities}} of <b>preventing</b> comorbid <b>mental</b> and physical disorders. It presents a framework of optional preventive strategies based on four explanatory models of comorbidity and six strategic dimensions. Addressing common early risk factors is discussed as one of these preventive strategies. Some examples of evidence-based prevention programs are presented that might contribute to prevention of comorbidity, needs for further research are discussed, and recommendations are presented for policy makers and practitioners to improve the perspectives for <b>preventing</b> <b>mental</b> and physical comorbidity. So far, <b>preventing</b> <b>mental</b> disorders and <b>preventing</b> physical disorders have been highly separated fields. It is recommended that both fields should broaden the range of baseline and outcome indicators and include longitudinal designs to understand the long-term broad-spectrum outcomes of preventive interventions better. Future policy plans and practices in {{physical and mental health}} should be more focused at preventing comorbidity, and enhance related expertise among policy-makers and practitioners. Finally, it is argued that the preventive approach of comorbidity should be broadened to ‘smart clusters' of highly related mental, physical and social problems, with the last possibly referring to important common risk factors...|$|R

50|$|There {{are many}} ways to <b>prevent</b> <b>mental</b> health disparities in the Filipino community. Most of the ways to prevent the disparities should start during childhood. It is {{important}} to build a positive relationship with the parents and the children. In most cases, in order for children to get better, the parent needs to get better as well. Filipino parents should take part in systematically researched parenting programs. The parenting programs must integrate Filipino cultural understanding and general parent techniques. Parenting programs would allow for parents to become comfortable with talking about issues with their children. The leaders of the programs should emphasize the importance of family and how they can all can grow as family. Because Filipinos are highly religious, it would be beneficial to put mental health care services in church based facilities. Important church leaders such as priests should reach out to Filipinos and get them to partake in mental health services. This should help with the problem of not trusting white Americans. Parents should also receive mental health care as well as the children. Parent mental health care can help decrease mental health issues for the entire family. It is essential to help parent’s mentally well-being before their children first starts school. It is also essential to make sure that school that the child is enrolled in is understanding of Filipino culture and beneficial for their mental health.|$|E
