These are the Aerodynamic Heating Facility (AHF), the Turbulent Flow Duct (TFD), the <b>Panel</b> <b>Test</b> Facility (PTF), and the Interaction Heating Facility (IHF).

2500|$|The {{magnitude}} and capacity {{of these systems}} makes the Ames Arc Jet Complex unique in the world. The largest power supply can deliver 75 megawatts (MW) for a 30-minute duration or 150 MW for a 15-second duration. This power capacity, in combination with a high-volume 5-stage steam ejector vacuum-pumping system, enables facility operations to match high-altitude atmospheric flight conditions with samples of relatively large size. The Thermo-Physics Facilities Branch operates four arc jet facilities. The Interaction Heating Facility (IHF), with an available power of over 60-MW, {{is one of the}} highest-power arc jets available. It is a very flexible facility, capable of long run times of up to one hour, and able to test large samples in both a stagnation and flat plate configuration. The <b>Panel</b> <b>Test</b> Facility (PTF) uses a unique semielliptic nozzle for testing panel sections. Powered by a 20-MW arc heater, the PTF can perform tests on samples for up to 20 minutes. The Turbulent Flow Duct provides supersonic, turbulent high temperature air flows over flat surfaces. The TFD is powered by a 20-MW Hüls arc heater and can test samples [...] in size. The Aerodynamic Heating Facility (AHF) has similar characteristics to the IHF arc heater, offering a wide range of operating conditions, samples sizes and extended test times. A cold-air-mixing plenum allows for simulations of ascent or high-speed flight conditions. Catalycity studies using air or nitrogen can be performed in this flexible rig. A 5-arm model support system allows the user to maximize testing efficiency. The AHF can be configured with either a Hüls or segmented arc heater, up to 20-MW. 1 MW is enough power to supply 750 homes.|$|E

40|$|Background: <b>Panel</b> <b>tests</b> are a {{predetermined}} group of tests commonly requested together {{to provide a}} comprehensive and conclusive diagnosis, for example, liver function test (LFT). South African HIV antiretroviral treatment (ART) guidelines recommend individual tests for toxicity monitoring over <b>panel</b> <b>tests.</b> In 2008, the National Health Laboratory Services (NHLS) request form was redesigned to list individual <b>tests</b> instead of <b>panel</b> <b>tests</b> and removed the ‘other tests’ box option to facilitate efficient ART laboratory monitoring. Objectives: This study aimed to demonstrate changes in laboratory expenditure, for individual and <b>panel</b> <b>tests,</b> for ART toxicity monitoring. Method: NHLS Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW) data were extracted for HIV conditional grant accounts to assess ART toxicity monitoring laboratory expenditure between 2010 / 2011 and 2014 / 2015. Data were classified based on the tests requested, as either panel (LFT or urea and electrolytes) or individual (alanine transaminase or creatinine) tests. Results: Expenditure on <b>panel</b> <b>tests</b> reduced from R 340 million in 2010 / 2011 to R 140 m by 2014 / 2015 (reduction of R 204 m) and individual test expenditure increased from R 34 m to R 76 m (twofold increase). A significant reduction in LFT panel expenditure was noted, reducing from R 322 m in 2010 / 2011 to R 130 m in 2014 / 2015 (60 % reduction). Conclusion: Changes in toxicity monitoring guidelines and the re-engineering of the NHLS request form successfully reduced expenditure on <b>panel</b> <b>tests</b> relative to individual tests. The introduction of order entry systems could further reduce unnecessary laboratory expenditure. Keywords: HIV;ART;Toxicity Monitoring;Expenditure</p...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectiveGenetic {{predisposition}} to ovarian cancer is well documented. With {{the advent of}} next generation sequencing, hereditary <b>panel</b> <b>testing</b> provides an efficient method for evaluating multiple genes simultaneously. Therefore, we sought to investigate the contribution of 19 genes identified in the literature as increasing the risk of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) in a BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 negative population of patients with a personal history of breast and/or ovarian cancer {{by means of a}} hereditary cancer panel. MethodsSubjects were referred for multi-gene <b>panel</b> <b>testing</b> between February 2012 and March 2014. Clinical data was ascertained from requisition forms. The incidence of pathogenic mutations (including likely pathogenic), and variant of unknown significance were then calculated for each gene and/or patient cohort. ResultsIn this cohort of 911 subjects, <b>panel</b> <b>testing</b> identified 67 mutations. With 7. 4 % of subjects harboring a mutation on this multi-gene panel, the diagnostic yield was increased, compared to testing for BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 mutations alone. In the ovarian cancer probands, the most frequently mutated genes were BRIP 1 (n= 8; 1. 72 %) and MSH 6 (n= 6; 1. 29 %). In the breast cancer probands, mutations were most commonly observed in CHEK 2 (n= 9; 2. 54 %), ATM (n= 3; 0. 85 %), and TP 53 (n= 3; 0. 85 %). ConclusionsAlthough further studies are needed to clarify the exact management of patients with a mutation in each gene, this study highlights information that can be captured with <b>panel</b> <b>testing</b> and provides support for incorporation of <b>panel</b> <b>testing</b> into clinical practice...|$|R

Methods: Medline via PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane Library databases and abstracts of international conferences proceedings were searched from January 1995 to December 2016 using the primary keywords “pepsinogens”, “gastrin”, “atrophic gastritis”, “gastric precancerous lesions”. Studies were included if they assessed {{the accuracy of the}} serum <b>panel</b> <b>test</b> for the diagnosis of atrophic gastritis using histology according to the updated Sydney System as reference standard.

The summary sensitivity was 74. 7 % (95 % confidence interval (CI), 62. 0 - 84. 3) and the specificity was 95. 6 % (95 %CI, 92. 6 - 97. 4).
