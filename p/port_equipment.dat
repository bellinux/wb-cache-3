40|$|AbstractPort {{hoisting}} equipment {{is associated with}} numerous salient characteristics like loads variation, complicated product composition and higher safety and reliability requirements. In addition to it, requirements of multiple standards are needed to be met during the entire product life cycle. There is a need of clear and thorough definition of requirements vis-à-vis design of <b>port</b> hoisting <b>equipment,</b> and at each life cycle stage, development activities are to be carried out. This paper discusses the classification of the requirement information of the {{hoisting equipment}} and defines the requirement features as well.

50|$|The modern port of Manzanillo was {{established}} in 1971. Previously, {{the administration of the}} port of Manzanillo was problematic. There was a poor relationship between the workers and the previous administration. The government of Mexico created the National Commission for Port Coordination which was in charge of organizing the workers assignments, checking that work was done on time. Also,they were in charge of obtaining <b>port</b> <b>equipment,</b> in order to increase handling speeds in the port. Over the last 40 years, the Port of Manzanillo has improved, increasing the productivity and has made the delivery process faster and more efficient.|$|E
50|$|In 1891 {{the port}} became a free port and was {{separated}} {{from the rest of}} the town by an enclosure. The status of free port, which had been previously extended to the whole city, was now being limited to this area, while the city became physically separated from it. In the period between 1901 and 1914 the works began to enlarge the Rive area (the embankment), to build the Bersaglieri Wharf, the Scalo Legnami (the timber pier) and S. Andrea port (piers V and VI). The fourth period, between 1924 and 1936, is characterised by the realisation of major public works, which were to complete the sea infrastructures, the <b>port</b> <b>equipment</b> on piers V and VI, the Silo, the Stazione Marittima (the passenger station), and the Idroscalo (the air harbour).|$|E

40|$|By {{use of the}} Markov’s {{processes}} methods, {{the subject}} under study is {{the performance of the}} logistical system "Port Terminal – Handling Equipment Stock" represented as a maintaining sys-tem with randomly varying output of servers which has the task formulated to define the optimal quantity of spare parts (SP's) to be stored to repair the failed handling machinery. The realization of the goal for the logistical system "Port Terminal – Handling Equipment Stock" is made by performing the logistical functions related to the handling, storage, <b>port</b> handling <b>equipment</b> maintenance, etc. For the above-mentioned maintaining system, the system of algebraic equations for steady-state probabilities of the introduced Markov process has been derived. The methodology for management of operational reliability of <b>port</b> handling <b>equipment</b> stock at the port terminal has been developed. It is based on determination of the SP's supply volume minimizing the mean total expenditures per unit time for SP's purchase and delivery, their storage, machinery repair works as well as for losses resulted from ship demurrage because of the handily equipment failures...|$|R

5000|$|The {{major change}} in staff working was the {{amalgamation}} of the Directorate of Equipment Management with Royal Engineers (RE), Royal Corps of Transport (RCT), Royal Army Ordnance Corps (RAOC) and Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (REME) staff branches. For {{the first time a}} single point of contact would lead on an individual item or range of equipment. This produced much needed simplification. The main drawback was that the equipment inventory was divided somewhat arbitrarily. RE (Engineer Services) took over control of equipment, principally plant, operated solely by that corps. RCT took on railway and maritime (including <b>port)</b> <b>equipment.</b> The RAOC assumed responsibility for ranges not normally subject to base repair (principally non-armoured vehicles, small arms and clothing and general stores) and the REME the base repair range (principally armoured vehicles, larger weapon systems and communications and electronic equipment).|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{technology}} of PSA(probabilistic safety assessment) based on fracture mechanics {{has been applied}} on the engineering field. However there’re few application on the port machines still with some problems. A comprehensive discuss on PSA method was {{presented in this paper}}. Firstly, the experiment of the fracture mechanics parameters of Q 345 steel used on the port machine’s structures was made to provide the parameters for PSA. Secondly, probabilistic analysis with the series of the Q 345 steel’s FAC(Failure Assessment Curve) provides the PSA criterion. By using stress analysis, defect detection and material properties, the structures safety of a RMG(Rail Mounted Gantry) of one port in service were assessed, the result show that the key points of the crane are safe in one point service.
