40|$|We {{present the}} case of a 64 -year-old woman who has {{suffered}} from pustulosis <b>palmaris</b> <b>et</b> <b>plantaris</b> for 10 years. At the first examination, many erythematous lesions with purpura, blood crusts, and blisters were present in the lower legs and dorsum of the feet. Painful swelling in the sternal region and dorsal pain were also noted. Elevation of the CRP and myogenic enzyme levels, and liver and renal dysfunctions were noted on blood testing. Histopathologically, leukocytoclastic vasculitis was noted in small blood vessels in the whole dermal layers, and deposition of IgM and C 3 in the vascular wall was detected by the direct immunofluorescence techniques. Based on these findings, cutaneous small vessel vasculitis was diagnosed. Because the patient complained of a toothache during the clinical course, an X-ray examination was performed. On pantomography, a radicular cyst and apical periodontitis were noted. The tooth symptoms changed with exacerbation and remission of the skin symptoms.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that pustulosis <b>palmaris</b> <b>et</b> <b>plantaris</b> and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) are two distinct diseases, and that the associated dermatoses are therefore also distinct diseases. METHODS: We prospectively performed clinical, radiological, biological, and bone scan investigations in 23 outpatients with pustolotic arthritis and 23 outpatients with PsA, matched by gender, age (+/- one year) and duration of arthritis (+/- two years). RESULTS: The anterior chest wall, especially the sternocostoclavicular joints, was more frequently involved in pustulotic arthritis than in PsA, both clinically (82 % v 43 %; p < 0. 001) and radiologically (47 % v 17 %; p < 0. 05). Sternocostoclavicular joints generally presented with erosive lesions in PsA, and with large ossifications in pustulotic arthritis. Peripheral joint involvement was mono- or oligoarticular, affecting proximal joints, in pustulotic arthritis (74 % v 21 %; p < 0. 01), and polyarticular, involving small distal joints, in PsA (60 % v 0 %; p < 10 (- 4)), in which condition it was also more often erosive (43 % v 8 %; p < 0. 01). The frequency of sacroiliitis and of spine involvement was similar in pustulotic arthritis and PsA. Biology and bone scan did not help distinguish between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Pustulotic arthritis and PsA are clinically and radiologically different, therefore pustulosis <b>palmaris</b> <b>et</b> <b>plantaris</b> and psoriasis are most probably distinct dermatological diseases...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Porokeratosis is a {{disorder}} of epidermal keratinization characterized clinically by a distinctive ridge-like border, and histologically by cornoid lamellae. The known clinical variants of porokeratosis are: classic porokeratosis of Mibelli, disseminated superficial (actinic) porokeratosis (DSAP), porokeratosis <b>palmaris</b> <b>et</b> <b>plantaris</b> disseminata, linear porokeratosis and punctate porokeratosis. In 1995, a seventh form {{was described as}} porokeratosis ptychotropica: a verrucous form resembling psoriasis involving the gluteal cleft presenting on the histological exam multiple cornoid lamellae. There are very few reports {{in the literature of}} this clinical variant. The present study describes the case of a healthy male presenting gluteal hyperkeratotic plaques for 22 years. He had been to several dermatologists, none of them had achieved a definitive diagnosis. We present a typical clinical presentation and its dermoscopy findings, in addition to histological examination that confirmed the diagnosis...|$|R
40|$|Porokeratosis is an {{assorted}} {{group of}} five genetic disorders. These include porokeratosis of Mibelli, DSAP, punctate porokeratosis, porokeratosis <b>palmaris</b> <b>et</b> <b>plantaris</b> disseminata, and linear porokeratosis. They are disorders of abnormal keratinization characterized {{by the appearance of}} atrophic patches. Porokeratosis of Mibelli is referred to the more localized form of this disorder usually manifesting as solitary or a small group of lesions. It was first described by Mibelli in 1893 who described atrophic patches surrounded by a clinically and histologically unique ridge like border termed the cornoid lamella. The cornoid lamella is formed by rapidly proliferating atypical keratinocytes that expands peripherally to form a raised boundary at the junction of abnormal and normal cells. These lesions are most commonly found on the extremities, but can also be found on genitalia, face, oral mucosa and cornea. Though the patches are generally asymptomatic they can often lead to ulcerative, verrucous, giant, and malignant lesions. We describe a case of Porokeratosis of Mibelli at an unusual site in a 22 yr old male. The presenting history, clinical findings, biopsy results and available literature are reviewed...|$|R
40|$|Pustulosis <b>palmaris</b> <b>et</b> <b>plantaris</b> or palmoplantar pustulosis (PPP) is a {{refractory}} pustular eruption on {{the palms}} and soles with unknown etiology. Numerous eccrine sweat pores {{exist on the}} palms and soles, suggesting the involvement of eccrine sweating in the pathogenesis of PPP. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, however, no definite abnormality in sweating has been documented in PPP. Accordingly, we analyzed the eccrine sweat duct involvement in the mechanism of vesicle formation in PPP. Dermatoscopy showed that PPP vesicles are located {{on the top of the}} ridges but not in the furrows. The sweat secretion in the lesional area was much lower than that in the nonlesional area, with or without pain stimulation to induce sweating. Immunostaining of horizontal sections of the lesions using antibodies against gross cystic disease fluid protein- 15 (GCDFP- 15) and epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) showed that these markers were localized in the cells lining the intraepidermal vesicles. Although the sweat antimicrobial peptides, dermcidin and human cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide 18 (hCAP- 18) /LL- 37, were detected in the fluid of the vesicles/pustules, neither dermcidin nor hCAP- 18 /LL- 37 were overexpressed by neighboring keratinocytes. These findings suggest that the acrosyringium may be involved as the main site of the vesicle formation in the pathomechanism of PPP...|$|R
40|$|Studies on the anti-keratin {{intermediate}} filament autoantibodies (anti-KIF-Abs) in sera from psoriasis (Pso) {{patients were}} performed by immunoblotting and {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (ELISA). According to their reactivities against keratin subunits (50, 56. 5, 58, and 63 - 68 kd), sera were divided into four groups. However, {{no significant differences in}} these reactive patterns were found between healthy volunteers and Pso patients. In the second experiment, anti-KIF-Abs in sera from Pso patients, pustulosis <b>palmaris</b> <b>et</b> <b>plantaris</b> (PPP) patients, atopic dermatitis (AD) patients, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients, and healthy volunteers were determined by ELISA, using as substrate keratins purified from normal human stratum corneum and 48 - and 50 -kd keratins purified from psoriatic stratum corneum. The serum titers of anti-KIF-Abs against 48 - and 50 -kd keratins in Pso patients were significantly higher than those in PPP patients, AD patients, SLE patients, or healthy volunteers. The elevated titers of anti-KIF-Abs against the 48 - and 50 -kd keratins in sera of Pso patients showed a significant decrease with improvement of psoriatic lesions. The above results suggest that anti-KIF-Abs against 48 - and 50 -kd keratins in sera of Pso patients have some relevance to the severity of the disease and {{can be used as a}} marker for the evaluation of the disease activity of psoriasis...|$|R

Hyper-immune response to alpha streptococci in patients with PPP was reported. On the other hand, costimulatory factors were studied on autoimmune disease. CD 28 and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated 4 (CTLA 4) participate in these factors. CD 28 take part in T-cell activation, while CTLA 4 take part in T-cell suppression. Therefore, we investigated CD 28 and CTLA 4 mRNA levels by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in tonsillar tissues and CD 3 positive lymphocytes from patients with PPP, recurrent tonsillitis (RT), and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). We also investigated the expression levels of CD 28 and CTLA 4 by flow cytometry analysis in tonsillar mononuclear cells stimulated with alpha streptococci in these patients. It was revealed that the CTLA 4 mRNA in tonsillar CD 3 positive lymphocytes from PPP patients was expressed at lower level than non-PPP patients. Then, the expression levels of CTLA 4, comparison before and after stimulation, were lower level in PPP patients than non-PPP patients. These results suggest that the lower expression level of CTLA 4 in PPP may cause hyper-immune response to alpha streptococci and abnormal regulation of T-cell activation...|$|R
40|$|L-selectin is a {{leucocyte}} {{adhesion molecule}} involved in leucocyte interactions with vascular endothelial cells. Following leucocyte activation L-selectin is endoproteolytically {{released from the}} cell surface. To assess whether psoriasis vulgaris results in systemic leucocyte activation, we examined expression levels of L-selectin on subsets of peripheral blood leucocytes from patients with psoriasis (n = 25) and normal control subjects. Serum levels of soluble L-selectin were quantified by ELISA in patients with psoriasis (n = 75), pustulosis <b>palmaris</b> <b>et</b> <b>plantaris,</b> and contact dermatitis, as well as normal control subjects. Psoriasis severity was evaluated by psoriasis area and severity index (PASI). L-selectin expression levels on CD 4 + T cells, B cells, monocytes, and neutrophils from patients with severe-type psoriasis (PASI ≥ 15) was significantly decreased compared with leucocytes from normal control subjects. Furthermore, L-selectin expression on CD 4 + T cells showed good inverse correlation with PASI scores. Monocyte L-selectin expression was restored when the skin lesions of psoriasis were remitted. The frequencies of L-selectin+ CD 4 + T cells or L-selectin+ CD 8 + T cells from patients with psoriasis were almost normal. Serum L-selectin levels in patients with severe-type psoriasis {{were significantly higher than}} those in normal control subjects. These results suggest that subsets of leucocytes may be activated in psoriasis, and that L-selectin expression levels on some leucocyte subsets, especially CD 4 + T cells, tend to correlate with disease severity of psoriasis...|$|R
