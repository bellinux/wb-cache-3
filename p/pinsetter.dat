25|$|GS-98 (1997) – Incorporated a new {{consolidated}} {{electronic system}} {{that uses a}} two control box system {{to reduce the number}} of printed circuit boards needed to operate the <b>pinsetter.</b> Also, software and hardware improvements to make the <b>pinsetter</b> more efficient and user-friendly.|$|E
25|$|GS-92 (1991) – Incorporated {{changes to}} the <b>pinsetter</b> to make it quicker to install and easier to service.|$|E
25|$|GS-96 (1995) – Incorporated {{changes in}} the {{software}} and hardware to speed up loading time of the <b>pinsetter.</b>|$|E
50|$|Free fall <b>pinsetters</b> {{are still}} in service in some bowling centres in British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec. There is one bowling center in St. Catharines, Ontario that runs Strickland <b>pinsetters</b> {{while most of the}} {{remaining}} free fall <b>pinsetters</b> are Double Diamond.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} stop on string <b>pinsetters</b> is a string tangle.|$|R

25|$|Many {{mechanical}} pinsetters {{are integrated}} with electronic scoring systems of varying sophistication. While many pinsetters have a manual reset button {{to use in}} case the <b>pinsetter</b> does not automatically activate at the correct time, other types have no automatic tracking {{of the state of}} the game – especially for the candlepin and duckpin bowling sports which use smaller balls – and are almost always manually activated.|$|E
25|$|GS-X (1999) – Incorporated {{a setting}} table and ball {{accelerator}} redesign that reduced {{the amount of}} parts, the number of adjustments, {{and the amount of}} preventive maintenance required. In 2000 the GS-X consolidated electronics was replaced with a single box electrical system called the NexGen Controller. This change reduced the overall size, weight, and number of electrical components needed to operate the pinsetters and made the setup for the machine more user-friendly. An additional modification lowered the overall profile of the <b>pinsetter,</b> allowing it to be installed in centers with low ceilings and reducing the number of parts and adjustments and the amount of preventative maintenance required.|$|E
500|$|Angie Pintero (Alex Bruhanski), {{the owner}} of a bowling alley, tells one of his employees, an autistic man named Harold Spuller (Steven M. Porter), to go home for the evening. Shortly thereafter, Angie discovers a badly-injured blond girl wedged inside of the {{automated}} <b>pinsetter.</b> The girl attempts to speak, but no words come out of her mouth. Angie notices police in a nearby parking lot and rushes outside to get help. He realizes a crowd has gathered around the dead body of the same girl he saw only moments earlier in the bowling alley. Angie relates his bizarre tale to Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson). Mulder suspects that Angie encountered the dead girl's ghost; three similar encounters, and three similar murders, were reported in the area in as many weeks. The agents discover the words, [...] "She is me" [...] written on the bowling lane where Angie saw the spirit, but its meaning remains a mystery.|$|E
50|$|A typical goal {{value for}} frames per stop is 1500 (150 lines) while well {{maintained}} <b>pinsetters</b> can run 2000 or more frames per stop. The newer Brunswick and Qubica/AMF <b>pinsetters</b> {{have been known}} to achieve over 7000 frames per stop. The busiest bowling centers can easily fit 100 lines (1000 frames) per day per lane.|$|R
5000|$|Bowling centres with {{convertible}} <b>pinsetters</b> usually {{will set}} specific hours {{as to when}} their convertible lanes will support five-pin or ten-pin. Convertible machines may support duckpin bowling instead of ten-pin when in ten-pin mode. String <b>pinsetters</b> are not sanctioned by the USBC for ten-pin play, partially because a [...] "stringsetter" [...] cannot handle an [...] "off-spot" [...] pin situation.|$|R
25|$|QubicaAMF Worldwide {{has also}} {{introduced}} many different scoring {{systems that are}} compatible with all <b>pinsetters</b> and pinspotters.|$|R
2500|$|The {{original}} {{model in}} the GS series (GS stands for Game Setter) was the GS-10, which was principally designed by Augusti Schmid in Scherzenbach, Switzerland to promote the sport of bowling throughout Europe. In 1984, Brunswick Bowling & Billiards Corporation acquired the rights to manufacture and sell the GS-10 <b>pinsetter.</b> The mechanical portion of the <b>pinsetter</b> was originally manufactured in the Brunswick plant located in Stockach, Germany. In 1999 the mechanical manufacturing was relocated to Hungary. The electronic control system is manufactured in Michigan, near the Brunswick plant located in Muskegon, Michigan. Subsequent models (year of introduction is in parentheses): ...|$|E
2500|$|In bowling, a <b>pinsetter,</b> or pinspotter, was {{originally}} {{a person who}} manually reset bowling pins to their correct position, cleared fallen pins, and returned bowling balls to players. [...] Probably {{due to the nature}} of the work (low-paid, often part-time, manual labor that most frequently took place evenings), many pinsetters were teenage boys, and thus pinboy is another name used to describe the job. In 1936, Harry Franklin invented the mechanical <b>pinsetter</b> while with the AMF firm, which largely did away with pinsetting as a manual profession, although a small number of bowling alleys still use human pinsetters. [...] While humans usually no longer set the pins, a pinchaser, or in slang 'pin monkey', often is stationed near the equipment to ensure that it is clean and working properly, and to clear minor jams.|$|E
2500|$|String pinsetters {{generally}} {{do not have a}} mechanism to place pins back on the lane exactly where they were before, during the spare clearing. [...] Since there is no table, collision damage is not possible with a string <b>pinsetter,</b> but they can suffer from string entanglement when the pins are being picked up, that prevents pins from aligning with the pickup holes.|$|E
50|$|In 2003 Qubica {{acquired}} the Mendes company, {{a maker of}} <b>pinsetters,</b> ball returns, and automated scoring systems.|$|R
50|$|QubicaAMF Worldwide {{has also}} {{introduced}} many different scoring {{systems that are}} compatible with all <b>pinsetters</b> and pinspotters.|$|R
50|$|In 1942, the Pavilion's owners leased {{the upstairs}} of the {{building}} to a gentleman who built and operated a ten-lane bowling alley. <b>Pinsetters</b> hand set the pins.|$|R
2500|$|This {{style of}} machine is {{typically}} loaded with 20 pins, though most proprietors normally put in 21 pins to facilitate quicker loading and faster {{operation of the}} <b>pinsetter,</b> especially {{in cases where the}} bowler(s) make two strikes in quick succession — on the original Model A unit, the [...] "second ball cycle" [...] used for both a second ball's delivery or a strike won't complete if the turret is not full, with the deck waiting in its elevated position until it loads a full rack of ten pins from the turret, simultaneously with the rake stopping at the rear of its travel until the filled turret drops its load of ten pins into the deck upper level. [...] Adding an extra pin does not put undue stress on the machine, but adding more than that is not advisable due to damage that can occur to the machine. [...] Other centers will only load the <b>pinsetter</b> with 19 pins. [...] Having only 19 pins in the machine will cause fewer stops from time to time but it will slow down the progress of the game if multiple strikes are thrown in succession.|$|E
2500|$|The GSX is Brunswick's current <b>pinsetter.</b> This machine uses a {{conveyor}} belt on the pit floor to move the pins to a vertical elevator system {{similar to the ones}} utilized on the AMF 82 series pinspotters, while the ball exits the pit at the side through a ball door. Pins are loaded using a combination of belts. [...] The ball return system on this machine uses an under-lane accelerator as opposed to a lift. It lowers the pin table on every cycle to determine scoring.|$|E
2500|$|The Mendes company {{produced}} a magnetic <b>pinsetter</b> {{known as the}} MM-2001. [...] It featured a flat magnetic pin table and magnets {{on the head of}} each pin. [...] It had a pit similar to the AMF and an elevator similar to the GSX. [...] Pin loading involves the combination of a carousel and magazine. [...] The company claimed this technology reduces stops in play due to table jams on out-of-range pins. [...] Mendes was bought out by Qubica, which sold the machine as the MAG3 until its partnership with AMF.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the decades}} {{leading up to}} the {{introduction}} of the fully automatic units, [...] "semi-automatic" [...] <b>pinsetters,</b> such as the [...] "B-1" [...] and [...] "B-10" [...] units made by Brunswick, basically consisting of just a manually filled [...] "table" [...] similar to those used on the fully automatic units, operating much as the later units' component of the same name operated, were used by human <b>pinsetters</b> to both speed up the manual operation, and assure accuracy of [...] "spotting" [...] the full rack of ten pins for the next frame.|$|R
2500|$|AMF {{manufactured}} candlepin <b>pinsetters</b> for a {{short time}} in the 1960s, using a Bowl-Mor style spotting table and an adapted tenpin-style sweep bar that operated [...] during its sweep.|$|R
50|$|The Bowlmor and Bowlero {{names are}} not {{exclusive}} to Bowlmor AMF and the Bowlmor, Bowl-Mor, Bowl Mor, and Bowlero bowling centers owned by {{others do not}} use Bowlmor AMF's branding concepts. The name Bowlmor was first used in a hyphenated form in the 1940s by Massachusetts attorneys Howard Dowd and R. Lionel Barrows {{in the creation of}} the firm Bowl-Mor, which first manufactured <b>pinsetters</b> for candlepin bowling, patented by Mr. Dowd, and later for duckpin bowling as well. Although the firm was defunct well before the end of the 20th century, many of its <b>pinsetters</b> are still in use.|$|R
2500|$|Soft belly or rubberband duckpin {{is played}} in Quebec. [...] Most of these bowling centers use a string type <b>pinsetter</b> similar to five pin. [...] Apart from five-pin, rubber band duckpin {{is the only}} bowling variant that {{currently}} sanctions string type pinsetters. [...] The free-fall machine for this sport features a rotating turntable in the pit floor similar to a Bowl-Mor candlepin unit, conveyor belts in the gutters as required in the regular duckpin game in the USA, an elevator similar to the Brunswick GSX, a turret similar to the A-2, and a rather flat looking pin table. [...] The sweep {{is similar to the}} candlepin Bowl-Mor.|$|E
2500|$|Correct {{calculation}} of bonus points {{can be a}} bit tricky, especially when combinations of strikes and spares come in successive boxes. In modern times, however, this has been overcome with automated scoring systems. When a scoring system is [...] "automated", the bowler only has to bowl. It keeps score and will reset the <b>pinsetter</b> after three balls are thrown or all 10 pins have been knocked down. If a scoring system is [...] "semiautomated", the bowler has to enter the score but the computer will keep track of it. The bowler needs to press a button {{at the end of the}} ball return to receive a new [...] "rack" [...] of pins.|$|E
2500|$|Five-pin bowling is {{a popular}} {{variation}} in Canada, and pinsetters fall into two categories: [...] string and free-fall. [...] String pinsetters are more prevalent, and consist of machines attached {{to the head of}} each pin, by means of a cord. [...] Essentially, the <b>pinsetter</b> is triggered by the movement of any pin by more than an inch or two. [...] With that, the machine lowers a guard, pulls up all 5 pins, and resets those that did not move. [...] There is, on average, a three-second lag from when the pins were knocked down to when the guard is lowered. [...] The pit floor is angled such that the ball is gravity-fed to a track that leads to an elevator. [...] The elevator lifts the ball to the return track.|$|E
5000|$|The Mendes {{family of}} string <b>pinsetters</b> {{is not as}} common as the PBS family. Mendes {{machines}} are easily spotted for its shield that descends on a hinge like a closing door. The machine may immediately start up if all the pins are knocked down. The early Mendes string <b>pinsetters</b> were pneumatic. They released an electrical version of the machine known as the ME90. Mendes was bought out by Qubica—now QubicaAMF Worldwide. The machine is now marketed by QubicaAMF under the TMS name [...] These machines are available for five and ten pin, {{but there is no}} convertible version.|$|R
50|$|AMF {{manufactured}} candlepin <b>pinsetters</b> for a {{short time}} in the 1960s, using a Bowl-Mor style spotting table and an adapted tenpin-style sweep bar that operated at an unusually rapid pace during its sweep.|$|R
5000|$|All modern bowling centres use {{automated}} pin-setting machines (first used in 1957) {{to reset}} the pins after each ball is thrown. In five-pin, {{two types of}} <b>pinsetters</b> are used—"string" [...] and [...] "free fall".|$|R
2500|$|A candlepin bowling lane, almost {{identical}} to a tenpin bowling lane, has an approach area of [...] for the player to bowl from, and then the lane proper, a maple surface approximately [...] wide, bounded on either side by a gutter (or [...] "channel", or trough.) The lane is separated from the approach by a [...] "foul line" [...] common to almost all bowling sports, which must not be crossed by players. At {{the far end of}} the lane are the pins, [...] from the foul line to the center of the headpin (or pin #1), placed by a machine called a <b>pinsetter</b> which occupies space both above and behind the pins. Unlike a tenpin lane, which has a level surface all the way from the foul line end of the lane's approach to the back end of the lanebed's [...] "pin deck", a candlepin lane has a hard-surfaced [...] "pin plate" [...] where the pins are set up, with the pin plate depressed [...] below the lanebed forward of it. The pin plate can be made from hard-surfaced metal, [...] "phenolic", [...] "high density plastic", or a [...] "synthetic" [...] material. Behind the pin plate area of a candlepin lane is a well-depressed [...] "pit" [...] area for the felled pins and balls to fall into. A heavy rubber backstop, faced with a black curtain, catches the flying pins and balls so they may drop into the pit. Generally there is seating behind the approach area for teammates, spectators, and score keeping.|$|E
50|$|In 1967 Brunswick {{introduced}} the automatic scorer. In 1984, Brunswick acquired the Schmid Company of Scherzenbach, Switzerland, {{and with it}} the rights to manufacture and sell its GS <b>pinsetter.</b> The GS is Brunswick’s current <b>pinsetter</b> series. The mechanical portion of the <b>pinsetter</b> was originally manufactured in the Brunswick plant located in Stockach, Germany. In 1999 the mechanical manufacturing was relocated to Hungary.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "string" [...] <b>pinsetter</b> {{is known}} for each pin having a string {{attached}} to the head. These pinsetters were first invented in 1963 and are characterized by a string being attached {{to the head of}} each pin. This type of <b>pinsetter</b> has a low operating cost, so it is the most commonly used type of <b>pinsetter.</b> There are three families of string pinsetters.|$|E
50|$|Holler House is {{a tavern}} {{that houses the}} oldest {{certified}} bowling alley in the United States. Holler House contains the two oldest sanctioned lanes in the nation, {{both of which are}} still tended by <b>pinsetters.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 2005, AMF Bowling's {{products}} {{division and}} Italian-based Qubica Worldwide formed a 50/50 joint venture, QubicaAMF Worldwide. The partnership combined Qubica's expertise in automatic scoring technology and AMF Bowling's technology in lane equipment and <b>pinsetters.</b>|$|R
25|$|Unless {{triggered}} {{into action}} by an automated scoring unit, candlepin <b>pinsetters</b> must be {{started by the}} bowler {{at the conclusion of}} a frame, by using a button or foot pedal operated switch to start the reset cycle.|$|R
