40|$|Autocrine and paracrine {{mechanisms}} modulate {{the synthesis}} and secretion of extracellular matrix (ECM); moreover, each {{component of the}} ECM is capable of modulating the synthesis and release of other ECM molecules. Therefore, the synthesis of ECM glycoprotein fibronectin and laminin was studied in the human breast cancer cell lines MCF 7 and MDA MB 23, <b>plated</b> <b>on</b> different ECM. Our {{results showed that the}} cells <b>plated</b> <b>on</b> a fibronectin substrate increased laminin synthesis: this event correlated with an increase in alpha 2 and alpha 3 integrin subunits. Staurosporine-induced apoptosis was then analyzed in the cell lines <b>plated</b> <b>on</b> different ECM. Staurosporine treatment determined the apoptosis of 35 and 33 % respectively of MDA MB 231 and MCF 7; these values increased to 60 and 64 % in cells <b>plated</b> <b>on</b> laminin, to 48 and 63 % in cells <b>plated</b> <b>on</b> fibronectin and to 64 and 69 % in cells <b>plated</b> <b>on</b> matrigel. Moreover, staurosporine treatment decreased bcl- 2 expression in the cells <b>plated</b> <b>on</b> fibronectin and laminin. Yet, staurosporine treatment determined PARP cleavage and PARP partial disappearance when the cells were <b>plated</b> <b>on</b> matrigel. Finally, a partial loss of function mutant Ras protein that activated only Raf pathway, was expressed in MCF 7, in order to identify whether the increase of apoptosis induced by extracellular matrix involved the Raf/MAP kinase pathway. The increase of apoptosis of the cells <b>plated</b> <b>on</b> matrigel suggested that the activation of the Raf pathway is probably involved in the decrease of survival on matrigel. These data demonstrate that the modification of ECM modulates the apoptotic process of breast cancer cells and suggest that it is worthwhile to dissect the role of ECM in the control of apoptotic process...|$|R

5|$|Millipede bodies may be {{flattened}} or cylindrical, and {{are composed}} of numerous metemeric segments, each with an exoskeleton consisting of five chitinous plates: a single plate above (the tergite), one at each side (pleurites), and a <b>plate</b> <b>on</b> the underside (sternite) where the legs attach. In many millipedes, these plates are fused to varying degrees, sometimes forming a single cylindrical ring. The plates are typically hard, being impregnated with calcium salts.

40|$|Abstract. Cells {{in culture}} reveal {{high levels of}} protein {{tyrosine}} phosphorylation in their focal adhesions, the regions where cells adhere to the underlying substratum. We have examined the tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins in response to <b>plating</b> cells <b>on</b> extracellular matrix substrata.

5|$|Apart {{from the}} skull, the {{skeleton}} of Istiodactylus was {{similar to those of}} other ornithocheiroid pterosaurs. The vertebral column, forelimb, and trunk bones were pneumatised by air sacs. The neural arches of the vertebrae had tall, sloping laminae. The notarium (a structure consisting of fused vertebrae in the shoulder-region of some pterosaurs and birds) consisted of six fused trunk vertebrae, with their neural spines fused into a <b>plate,</b> <b>on</b> which the shoulder blades articulated with a depression on each side. The main part of the sternum was very deep, with a bowed front edge and a shallow, triangular keel. The facets of the sternum that contacted with the coracoids were saddle-shaped and arranged asymmetrically. The humerus (upper arm bone) was stout and had a sharply curved deltopectoral crest. The forelimbs of istiodactylids were large, up to 4.5 times longer than their legs. The long wing-finger may have occupied 50 percent of the wing-skeleton. The hindlimbs were short compared to the forelimbs, and the feet were as long as the small third finger.|$|E

5|$|Juliomys anoblepas {{is similar}} to the other members of its genus in the {{configuration}} of its zygomatic plate (a bony <b>plate</b> <b>on</b> the side of the skull).

Furthermore, the incisive foramina, openings in the front part of the palate, extend to a point between the first molars, and the palate is short, with its back margin between the third molars. The living species of Juliomys differ from J.anoblepas in various characters, including shorter incisive foramina in two species and the shape of the zygomatic arch (cheekbone) in J.anoblepas. The upper molar row is 4.13mm long, which makes J.anoblepas the largest known species of Juliomys.|$|E

Many of the local houses were painted white for scenographic reasons. Glen opted to use the local slopes and olive trees for the chase scene between Melina's Citroën 2CV and Gonzales' men driving Peugeot 504s. The scene was shot across twelve days, with stunt driver Rémy Julienne – who would remain in the series up until GoldenEye – driving the Citroën.

40|$|We {{have shown}} {{previously}} that {{the expression of}} collagenase is upregulated in rabbit synovial fibroblasts cultured on a substrate of antibody to the alpha 5 chain of the alpha 5 beta 1 integrin fibronectin receptor or on the 120 -kD cell-binding chymotryptic fragment of plasma fibronectin, but remains at basal levels in cells <b>plated</b> <b>on</b> intact plasma fibronectin. We now have identified some {{of the components of}} a signaling pathway that couples the fibronectin receptor to the induction of collagenase transcription. We studied the control of collagenase gene expression in cells adhering to the 120 -kD fragment of fibronectin, to antifibronectin receptor antibody, or to plasma fibronectin by transiently introducing promoter-reporter constructs into rabbit synovial fibroblasts before <b>plating</b> cells <b>on</b> these matrices. The constructs contained segments of the human collagenase promoter regulating transcription of chloramphenicol acyl transferase. Expression of constructs containing the - 1200 /- 42 -bp segment or the - 139 /- 42 -bp segment of the collagenase promoter inserted upstream from the reporter gene was induced to similar extents in cells <b>plated</b> <b>on</b> the 120 -kD fragment of fibronectin or on anti-fibronectin receptor antibody, relative to that in fibroblasts <b>plated</b> <b>on</b> fibronectin. The expression of the construct containing the - 66 /- 42 -bp segment of the promoter was not regulated and was {{similar to that of the}} parent pBLCAT 2 plasmid, suggesting that the - 139 /- 67 region of the collagenase promoter, which contains PEA 3 - and AP 1 -binding sites, regulates the transcription of collagenase caused by integrin-derived signals. Expression of a reporter construct containing only the PEA 3 and AP 1 sites in the collagenase promoter (- 90 /- 67) also increased in cells <b>plated</b> <b>on</b> the 120 -kD fragment of fibronectin or on anti-fibronectin receptor antibody, relative to that in cells <b>plated</b> <b>on</b> fibronectin. Mutations in either the AP 1 or PEA 3 site of this minimal promoter abrogated its activity in cells <b>plated</b> <b>on</b> these inductive ligands. Expression of c-fos mRNA increased within 1 h of <b>plating</b> cells <b>on</b> the 120 -kD fibronectin fragment or on anti-fibronectin receptor antibody, relative to that in cells <b>plated</b> <b>on</b> fibronectin. c-Fos protein accumulated in the nuclei of fibroblasts within 10 min of <b>plating</b> <b>on</b> the 120 -kD fibronectin fragment. The increase in c-Fos was required for the increase in collagenase in cells <b>plated</b> <b>on</b> the 120 -kD fibronectin fragment: incubation of cells with antisense, but not sense, c-fos oligonucleotides diminished both basal and induced expression of the - 139 /- 42 collagenase promoter-reporter construct and decreased expression of the endogenous collagenase gene.

5|$|When the North American <b>Plate</b> <b>on</b> its slow journey westwards {{encountered}} the Pacific Plate approximately 250 {{million years ago}} during the Paleozoic, the latter began to subduct under the North American continent. Intense pressure underground caused some of the Pacific Plate to melt, and the resulting upwelling magma pushed up and hardened into the granite batholith that makes up much of the Sierra Nevada. Extensive layers of marine sedimentary rock that originally made up the ancient Pacific seabed were also pushed up by the rising granite, and the ancestral Merced River formed on this layer of rock. Over millions of years, the Merced cut a deep canyon through the softer sedimentary rock, eventually hitting the hard granite beneath. The encounter with this resilient rock layer caused the Merced River to mostly stop its downcutting, although tributary streams continued to widen the ancient canyon.|$|E
