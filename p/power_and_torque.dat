5|$|Toyota Australia {{planned to}} sell 50 to 70 TRD Aurion units per month with the {{majority}} of the sales coming from Australia. However, the project was unsuccessful, and as of 31 March 2009, TRD Australia halted production of the Aurion TRD (and TRD Hilux), and the division was shut down. When available, the range comprised two variants, the 3500S and 3500SL. The former features performance mufflers, 19-inch alloy wheels, red alcantara leather seats with black alcantara fabric bolsters and other high-performance upgrades. The range-topping 3500SL adds clearance and reverse parking sensors, dual-zone climate control air conditioning, a colour-coded transmission selection lever, and an eight-way adjustable driver's seat. Furthermore, the SL gains an aluminium rear bumper reinforcement addition, and is the first production car in the world to use the Eaton twin-vortices supercharger. This substantially reduces engine noise while bringing gains to <b>power</b> <b>and</b> <b>torque.</b>|$|E

25|$|In Aug 2015, Mahindra & Mahindra {{announced}} TUV300 and the microsite for {{the vehicle}} went live the same month. The vehicle was {{officially launched on}} 15 Sep 2015 in Madhya Pradesh. TUV300 is designed by Mahindra Research Valley and is built on the same platform as the Scorpio. TUV300 also carries the same engine as the XUV500 and Scorpio, but the engine displacement in the TUV300 is lower, resulting in lower engine <b>power</b> <b>and</b> <b>torque.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1999, {{fears of}} a European {{regulatory}} backlash or import ban, led to an informal agreement between the Japanese and European manufacturers to govern the top speed of their motorcycles at an arbitrary limit. The media-reported value for the speed agreement in miles per hour was consistently 186mph, while in kilometers per hour it varied from 299 to 303km/h, which is typical given unit conversion rounding errors.

40|$|International audienceStirling {{engine is}} an Environmental {{friendly}} heat engine which can reduce 2 emission through combustion process. Various criteria {{should be considered}} for designing and optimizing stirling heat engines such as <b>power,</b> <b>torque,</b> <b>and</b> pressure loss in heat exchangers of stirling engine, efficiency and so forth. In the aforementioned criteria, output <b>power</b> <b>and</b> shaft <b>torque</b> {{are the most important}} criteria which represent the performance and efficiency of the stirling engines. So, determination of output <b>power</b> <b>and</b> shaft <b>torque</b> with low uncertainty and high precision are required. In this paper, a new generation of intelligent models named “least square support vector machine (LSSVM) ” is employed to predict output <b>power</b> <b>and</b> shaft <b>torque</b> of stirling engines. To build, train and test the model, various accurate experimental data from open literature are employed. The outputs of the model are compared to experimental ones and statistical parameters of the model including correlation coefficient, average absolute relative deviation (AARD) and root mean square error (RMSE) are calculated. According to the results obtained via model, the model can predict output <b>power</b> <b>and</b> shaft <b>torque</b> of Stirling heat engine with reasonable and acceptable accuracy. Finally, the model can help us in designing of Stirling engine with low degree of uncertainty and high precision...|$|R

25|$|The 1961 Formula One season saw the {{introduction}} of radically revised engine regulations. Maximum capacity was cut from 1954-1960's 2.5 L to only , greatly reducing the <b>power</b> <b>and</b> <b>torque</b> available, but also bringing fuel economy and weight benefits. This change required Formula One chassis designers to rethink their approach to a car's whole construction as poor handling and excess weight {{could no longer be}} effectively compensated for by greater engine output. Cooper suffered their first season without a Championship race win since 1958, and finished only fourth in the World Constructors' Championship.|$|E
25|$|In 1993, the 1994 {{model year}} Thunderbird {{received}} a substantial refresh, including stylistic changes {{inside and out}} and mechanical enhancements. In particular, the Windsor 5.0 was replaced with Ford's new Modular 4.6L OHC V8 while the Super Coupe's supercharged V6 was enhanced to produce more <b>power</b> <b>and</b> <b>torque.</b> The performance increase is largely attributed to the tighter gap tolerance of the supercharger rotors allowed {{by the use of}} resin coating and a new high flow supercharger case. Simultaneously, the AOD automatic transmission was replaced by the also-new electronically controlled 4R70W 4-speed automatic in all instances where the AOD was previously used in the Thunderbird.|$|E
25|$|The Prevé has {{received}} generally favourable reviews from critics in its domestic market. Malaysian automotive journalist Danny Tan from paultan.org commended the Prevé's looks, practicality, ergonomics and NVH attributes. The ride comfort and handling characteristics were exceptionally praised, in which Danny claimed was “unrivaled in the Asian C-segment sedan class”. However, the CamPro IAFM+ variants of the Prevé {{were not as}} well received {{in comparison with the}} turbocharged CamPro CFE model. The lack of <b>power</b> <b>and</b> <b>torque</b> from the IAFM+ engine was held responsible for poor acceleration and overall performance, but nonetheless competent in normal driving conditions. Danny also criticized some design flaws on the interior, such as the poorly designed head unit and instrument panel.|$|E

25|$|A fuel with {{a higher}} octane rating is less prone to {{knocking}} (extremely rapid and spontaneous combustion by compression) and the control system of any modern car engine {{can take advantage of}} this by adjusting the ignition timing. This will improve energy efficiency, leading to a better fuel economy than the comparisons of energy content different fuels indicate. By increasing the compression ratio, further gains in fuel economy, <b>power</b> <b>and</b> <b>torque</b> can be achieved. Conversely, a fuel with lower octane rating is more prone to knocking and will lower efficiency. Knocking can also cause engine damage. Engines designed to run on 87 octane will not have any additional power/fuel economy from being operated with higher octane fuel.|$|E
25|$|Gear sets may be {{replaced}} with closer ratios to keep the engine in the power band, or, on some cars that produce enough <b>power</b> <b>and</b> <b>torque</b> to four-gear transmissions {{similar to the ones}} used in NASCAR (such as the Andrews four-speed dog box that Vaughn Gittin Jr. ran in his 2016 Mustang) with more open-ratio gears, this limits the number of shifts the driver has to do during their run. These may be coarser dog engagement straight cut gears instead of synchronised helical gears, for durability and faster shifting at the expense of noise and refinement. Wealthier drifters may use sequential gearboxes to make gear selection easier and faster, while sequential shift lever adapters {{can be used to make}} shifts easier without increasing shift time.|$|E
25|$|The main {{change for}} the 2012 models was the {{installation}} of a different engine from the Ford Duratorq engine range. Ford decided, due to cost reasons, not to modify the 2.4-litre engine introduced in 2007 to meet the upcoming Euro V emissions standards and so the engine was replaced with the ZSD-422 engine, essentially a 2.2-litre variant of the same engine. Although smaller than the existing unit the <b>power</b> <b>and</b> <b>torque</b> outputs remained unchanged and the same six-speed gearbox was used as well. The engine included a diesel particulate filter {{for the first time}} on a Defender. The only other change was the reintroduction of the soft top body style to the general market. This had been a popular option for the Land Rover Series but by the introduction of the Defender had been relegated to special order and military buyers only. Land Rover stated that the option was being brought back due to customer feedback.|$|E

25|$|Although the 200Tdi engine {{had been}} an undoubted {{technological}} and sales success, it had certain limitations and flaws {{that needed to be}} rectified. Despite the numerous differences, it was still in essence a direct-injection version of the older Diesel Turbo engine. It was also considered rather raucous and unrefined, especially for use in the Discovery and Range Rover models. A special version of the engine had to be produced to fit the Defender, and problems with weak head gasket had been identified. The British Army (and some other military buyers) had not opted for the 200Tdi because it could not be fitted with a 24-volt generator for powering radio equipment- instead the Army continued to buy vehicles with 2.5-litre naturally aspirated diesels. Upcoming European diesel emissions regulations (Euro I) meant that Land Rover would be forced to radically alter the engine anyway. The resulting development project (coded Romulus) produced the 300Tdi engine. Although externally very similar to the Discovery/Range Rover version of its predecessor, 208 changes were made. These included modifications to the block, cylinder head, fuel injector system and ancillary systems. The crankshaft, pistons and connecting rods were significantly altered over the 200Tdi. The most obvious external changes were the fitting of a rubber acoustic cover over the engine to reduce noise and the change to a single serpentine belt to drive the ancillaries instead of the multiple V-belts of the older engines. Emissions regulation included the fitting of an exhaust gas recirculation system. <b>Power</b> <b>and</b> <b>torque</b> outputs remained the same, and the engine had been specifically designed to be compatible with all the models in the Land Rover range without any changes. This meant that the Defender engines were fitted in the same tune as the Discovery/Range Rover engines. The 300Tdi was noticeably smoother and quieter than the 200Tdi, but was generally found to not be quite as economical in real-world use. It turned out that the Euro I emissions regulations were not as severe as Land Rover anticipated, and so the 300Tdi was able to remain in production until the introduction of the Euro III rules. When fitted to vehicles with an automatic transmission, power was increased to 122 horsepower {{to make up for the}} power losses in the transmission. These engines (designated 23L) had Bosch Electronic Diesel Control systems, where the mechanical injector system was controlled by a drive-by-wire electronic throttle to reduce emissions. The 300Tdi was replaced in 1998 by the 5-cylinder Td5, bringing to an end the line of Land Rover 4-cylinder engines that can be traced back to 1957. The Td5 engine was loosely based on the Rover Group's L-series diesel engine. The 300Tdi remained in production in Brazil, and was offered as an option on rest of world (non-UK/Europe) models. Following Ford's acquisition of Land Rover in 2000, the engine was used in Brazilian-built Ford pick-up trucks as well. Increasing emissions laws worldwide and falling sales led to production of the 300Tdi ending in 2006. A much-modified 2.8-litre version was built by International Engines in Brazil until 2010, and was available as an after-market fitment to Land Rovers through specialist converters. International then became MWM International Motores and a further update of the 300Tdi design was launched as the 3.0 Power Stroke. Although based around the same block and basic architecture as the 300Tdi the Power Stroke has major differences such as electronic common rail injection and new crossflow cylinder head with Overhead camshaft.|$|E

The decision to change the engine was based on engine weight and dimensions, {{as well as to}} [...] environmental emission considerations. Use of the shorter V6 engine design allowed the wheelbase of the XJ220 to be shortened and its weight to be reduced; the V12 engine was definitively ruled out when it was determined it would have difficulty at simultaneously meeting emissions legislation and producing the required <b>power</b> <b>and</b> <b>torque.</b>|$|E
