2500|$|Ole Rise {{owned the}} manor for 9 years, before his {{interest}} {{was purchased by}} John Heftye (1849–1907). Rise then settled in Stjørdal, where he bought Ree farm. During the period he owned Austrått, he also owned Sundnes distillery {{on the island of}} Inderøy. There had previously been a dairy operation on Austrått, probably from 1858, and continuing until the dairy burned down sometime in 1879 and Rise continued it. Rise's stewardship of the Austrått property has been the source of some disagreement. Andersen/Bratberg writes that [...] "Rise ... has received a bad reputation as a man who depleted the property and was only interested in making the most money possible out of it"; while local historian Terje Sørensen wrote that [...] "Ole Rise ran the property well, <b>putting</b> <b>into</b> <b>use</b> the existing buildings and building an extension to the cow barn. It was called [...] "Rise Cow Barn." [...] He received the prize for good cattle care in 1875, and was awarded prizes at exhibitions of livestock and dairy products".|$|E
6000|$|A {{superficial}} criticism {{declares that}} in the new schools children will study only [...] "what they like." [...] On the contrary, all subjects requisite for a wide culture, {{as well as for}} the ability to cope with existence in a highly complex civilization, are insisted upon. It is true, however, that the trained and gifted teacher is able to discover a method of so presenting a subject as to seize the imagination and arouse the interest and industry of a majority of pupils. In the modern schools French, for example, is really taught; pupils do not acquire a mere smattering of the language. And, what is more important, the course of study is directly related to life, and to practical experience, instead of being set forth abstractly, as something which at the time the pupil perceives no possibility of <b>putting</b> <b>into</b> <b>use.</b> At one of the new schools in the south, the ignorant child of the mountains at once acquires a knowledge of measurement and elementary arithmetic by laying out a garden, of letters by inscribing his name on a little signboard in order to identify his patch--for the moment private property. And this principle is carried through all the grades. In the Gary Schools and elsewhere the making of things in the shops, the modelling of a Panama Canal, the inspection of industries and governmental establishments, the designing, building, and decoration of houses, the discussion and even dramatization of the books read,--all are a logical and inevitable continuation of the abstract knowledge of the schoolroom. The success of the direct application of learning to industrial and professional life may also be observed in such colleges as those at Cincinnati and Schenectady, where young men spend half the time of the course in the shops of manufacturing, corporations, often earning more than enough to pay their tuition.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{construction}} {{project for the}} construction woks is the cost center of the construction enterprise and {{the standpoint of the}} cost management for the construction enterprise, strengthening the cost management is the inevitable choice of the construction enterprise to accumulate the funds and enhance the competitiveness. Since the {{construction project}} period is long, it is complex to recognize the median income and measurement of the intermediate cost, and the bidding period and the cost incurred after <b>putting</b> <b>into</b> <b>use</b> are uncertain, the traditional cost management method no longer meets the practical needs of the management for the building construction enterprise. This requires us to be innovative in the cost management mode of the construction project, and make a scientific estimation in the future level of cost and possible future trends through the objective-cost planning research of the construction project. Objective-cost Management The objective-cost management is a management concept that is objective cost-oriented, a specific form of the objective management and {{an important part of the}} enterprise objective management. It specifically refers that the enterprise extracts the cost objective from the enterprise objective system during cost operation activity to guide, plan and control the occurrence of the cost and payment o...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the degree of user {{satisfaction}} regarding the Fiji National University library services through library user surveys. The paper elaborates how these user surveys play a significant role in library service quality enhancement for students and academic to conduct their research and advance their knowledge. The FNU Library is ISO 9001 : 2008 certified and is the only library in the South Pacific holding ISO certification which therefore plays a vital role in carrying out the survey. The survey was carried out from 3 rd September to 1 st October 2015 with a vision to obtain valuable feedback from the users and to provide high quality and responsive one-stop service at all 16 FNU libraries. The paper describes these surveys, including the end results and the improvements to be adopted. Responses gathered from user surveys provide literally important information for improving library services. Through these user surveys, the library received a large amount of data to be analyzed. A summary of user surveys, including ways of doing things, and <b>putting</b> <b>into</b> <b>use</b> as well as data analysis, might offer reference and practical experience for the FNU libraries. User survey plays an important role in the library's service quality improvement. The paper provides a valuable summary and practical knowledge of the topic...|$|E
40|$|The role of {{ribonucleic acid}} (RNA) in {{molecular}} biology is shifting from a mere messenger between DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) and proteins to an im- portant player in many cellular activities. The {{central role of}} RNA molecules calls for a precise characterization of their structural and dynamical properties. Nowadays, experiments can be efficiently complemented by computational ap- proaches. This thesis deals with {{the study of the}} dynamical properties of small RNA molecules, exploiting various computational techniques. Specifically we inves- tigate two different complementary methods, elastic network models (ENMs) and Markov state models (MSMs). ENMs are valuable and efficient tools for characterizing the collective inter- nal dynamics of biomolecules. We evaluate their performance by comparing their predictions with the results of atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) sim- ulations and selective 2 ’-hydroxyl analyzed by primer extension (SHAPE) ex- periments. We identify the optimal parameters that should be adopted when <b>putting</b> <b>into</b> <b>use</b> such models. MSMs are tools that allow to probe long-term molecular kinetics based on short-time MD simulations. We make use of MSMs and MD simulations to measure the kinetics and the timescale of the stacking-unstacking motion for a collection of short RNA oligonucleotides, comparing the results with previously published relaxation experiments. We then move {{to the study of the}} process of the fraying of the terminal base pair in a helix, characterizing the different involved pathways and the sequence dependence of the process timescale...|$|E
