5000|$|During the post-World War II period, Zainichi Koreans faced {{various kinds}} of {{discrimination}} from Japanese society. Due to the San Francisco Peace Treaty, the Japanese government created laws to support Japanese citizens by giving financial support, providing shelters, etc. However, after the treaty was signed, Zainichi Koreans were no longer counted as Japanese citizens, so {{they were unable to}} get any support from the government. They were unable to get an insurance certificate from the government, so it was difficult for them to get any medical care. Without medical insurance, Zainichi Koreans were unable to go to hospital since the cost of medication was too high. Another problem caused by this treaty was that the Japanese government created a law which stated that Korean residents in Japan had to be fingerprinted since Zainichi Koreans had two names (their original name and a name given by the Japanese government). Under this law, Zainichi Koreans had to reveal their identity to the public because when they visited the city hall to provide their fingerprints, their neighbors found out that they were Zainichi Koreans. Therefore, Zainichi Koreans were forced to reveal their identity to Japanese and faced discrimination from them. This made their lives even more difficult. In order to protect themselves, many Zainichi Koreans protested against this law. Mindan and many Zainichi Koreans opposed this law, but the law wasn’t repealed until 1993. Until then, Zainichi Koreans could not escape from the social discrimination which they had faced in Japanese society. Furthermore, it was hard for the Zainichi Koreans to get a job due to discrimination. Especially, it was very hard for Zainichi Koreans to become public employees since Japan only let Japanese nationals become public employees at that time. Since many Zainichi Koreans couldn’t get a proper job, they began to get involved in illegal jobs such as [...] "illegal alcohol <b>production,</b> <b>scrap</b> recycling, and racketeering". (Min). As a result, many Zainichi Koreans ended up living in slums or hamlets since Japanese real estate agents refused to let Zainichi Koreans rent houses.Zainichi today have established a stable presence in Japan after years of activism. Through Mintohren, community support by Zainichi organizations (Mindan, Chongryon, among others), other minority groups (Ainu, Burakumin, Ryūkyūans, Uilta, Nivkhs and others), and sympathetic Japanese, they have improved the social atmosphere for Zainichi in Japan. There are also Koreans living in Japan who try to present themselves as Japanese to avoid discrimination. Most younger Zainichi now speak only Japanese, go to Japanese schools, work for Japanese firms and increasingly now marry Japanese. Most naturalization occurs among the young during the period when they seek formal employment or marriage. Those who have already established their life often choose to retain their South Korean or Joseon nationality as part of their heritage.|$|E

In the undertaken research study, reheating furnace temperature of 1050 ᴼC {{of a local}} steel bar manufacturing facility of Peshawar, Pakistan {{is found to be}} statistically significant with the help of analysis of variance (ANOVA) experimentation. The second analysed temperature level is 900 ᴼC which comes out to be insignificant. At 1050 ᴼC temperature, minimum <b>production</b> <b>scrap</b> is found and z. bench quality standard is also improved. For yield strength quality characteristic of the product the scrap level is 90 % less than the production at 900 ᴼC while the z. bench level is improved to 28 %.

40|$|Recycling plastic {{solid waste}} (PSW) is {{becoming}} more and more important, due to (i) increasing landfilling constraints and taxes and (ii) the potential recovery of energy or chemicals. Three different routes for the beneficial utilisation of PSW are primary (re-extrusion of clean <b>production</b> <b>scrap),</b> secondary (mechanical treatment of <b>production</b> <b>scrap</b> and post consumer waste) and tertiary (energy recovery through incineration and co-incineration in cement kilns) recycling. (Co-) incineration requires an extensive flue gas purification to meet the stringent emission norms, especially regarding some contaminants that are present in PSW, such as heavy metals (pigments), flame retardants (Br, Sb, P, ) and volatile organic compounds formed by incomplete combustion. A fourth PSW treatment route is therefore considered, namely the valorization of chemicals, which can be used as feedstock for the production of similar products. Recently, the research focus has shifted towards thermo-chemical conversion of PSW into chemicals and/or fuel, i. e. by pyrolysis in the absence of oxygen. Pyrolysis can overcome certain drawbacks of recycling and incineration because of (i) the low process temperature (350 - 500 °C), at which the contaminants remain in the carbonaceous char; (ii) the inert process atmosphere and (iii) the possibility to work on small scale. The doctoral research focuses on thermo-chemical valorization of PSW and includes: - evaluation of the impact of legislation on the evolution of the sector- critical literature survey to determine strengths and weaknesses of previous research, which will result in a final research strategy (methods, analysis techniques, ) - initial screening of plastic solid waste streams and their potential in the waste-to-chemicals concept: PE, PP, PS, PET, polycarbonate, rubber and bio-polymers- selection of the target polymers and/or elastomers- full characterization of decomposition (isothermal, dynamic, reactor) to obtain (i) kinetic expressions, (ii) product identification as function of varying process conditions and (iii) mass and energy balances for the processes- characterization of the formed formed and the potential and/or required further processing to enable reuse- selection of reactor types, preferably fluidized beds (in case they can meet the process condition requirements) - experimental analysis of the process conditions in these reactors- determination of the essential parameters (mixing, residence time, temperature, ) versus the required conversion- final combination of the different research topics in a practical design method together with calculation models- techno-economic evaluation with focus on product valorizationnrpages: 226 status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Despite the {{paramount}} {{importance of the}} steel rolling industry and its vital contributions to a nation’s economic growth and pace of development, production planning in this industry has not received {{as much attention as}} opposed to other industries. The work presented in this thesis tackles the master production scheduling (MPS) problem encountered frequently in steel rolling mills producing reinforced steel bars of different grades and dimensions. At first, the production planning problem is dealt with under static demand conditions and is formulated as a mixed integer bilinear program (MIBLP) where the objective of this deterministic model is to provide insights into the combined effect of several interrelated factors such as batch <b>production,</b> <b>scrap</b> rate, complex setup time structure, overtime, backlogging and product substitution, on the planning decisions. Typically, MIBLPs are not readily solvable using off-the-shelf optimization packages necessitating the development of specifically tailored solution algorithms that can efficiently handle this class of models. The classical linearization approaches are first discussed and employed to the model at hand, and then a hybrid linearization-Benders decomposition technique is developed in order to separate the complicating variables from the non-complicating ones. As a third alternative, a modified Branch-and-Bound (B&B) algorithm is proposed where the branching, bounding and fathoming criteria differ from those of classical B&B algorithms previously established in the literature.

40|$|According to the European Photovoltaic Industry Association, {{photovoltaic}} energy {{has the potential}} to contribute up to 12. 6 % to the global electricity supply by 2040. Part of the electricity produced will come from thin film technologies. Amongst other thin film technologies available on the market today, low-cost cadmium-telluride photovoltaics (CdTe-PV) is the market leader with a 5 % share of the worldwide market. However, various studies show that the availability of tellurium can limit the further growth of this tech-nology. Moreover, a possible legal ban of cadmium in photovoltaic modules threatens this technology. Effi-cient material and equipment use as well as the recovery of CdTe from production waste and end-of-life photovoltaic modules can minimize primary Te demand and prevent the release of toxic Cd emissions into the environment. This paper presents possible scenarios of Cd and Te recycling flows from PV waste, projected to the year 2040. Based on a market scenario portraying future material demand, amounts of recovered materials and material captured in installed modules are estimated. The results of this analysis show that in only 20 to 25 years significant amounts of end-of-life waste will reach the recycling market. Until this phase is reached, <b>production</b> <b>scrap</b> will dominate the waste flows.

The study was carried out under field conditions from August to November of 2014, at the Experimental Farm 'Rafael Fernandes' of the Rural Federal University of the Semi-Arid (RFUSA), in Mossoró, in the State of Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil. The experimental design was a randomised complete blocks in a 4 x 3 factorial, consisting of a combination of four different amounts of flor-de-seda biomass incorporated into the soil (20, 35, 50 and 65 t ha- 1 of dry matter) and three spatial arrangements for the crop rows (2 x 2, 3 x 3 and 4 x 4). The carrot and cowpea cultivars used were ꞌBrasíliaꞌ and ꞌBRS Itaimꞌ. The characteristics under evaluation in the carrot were total, commercial and classified root <b>production</b> (<b>scrap,</b> short, medium and long).

40|$|In {{industrial}} recycling processes secondary metals need to {{be separated}} by material grades {{before they can be}} further processed. The identification and separation into different material classes lead to higher value-added industrial feedstock and prevent downgrading processes. Secondary raw materials can be used more efficiently resulting in an increased use of waste products in resource-intensive production processes. Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) offers a contact free, multi-elemental and fast method for the inline quantitative analysis of single objects in moving particle streams. The LIBS method presented in this paper is based on a 3 D object detection combined with a scanning LIBS setup. The optical system consists of a pulsed Nd:YAG laser running at 40 Hz, delivering a 200 mJ double pulse for plasma generation. A high performance three axis galvo-scanner guides the laser beam onto single pieces moving at 3 m s- 1 through a measuring volume of 600 × 60 0 × 100 mm 3 with a precision of ± 1. 5 mm. Twenty channels of a high resolution Paschen-Runge spectrometer are simultaneously processed within a few microseconds enabling multi-elemental analysis of different aluminium (Al) alloys.

40|$|This {{position}} paper introduces {{the reader to}} the concept of solvometallurgy, the term used to describe the extraction of metals from ores, industrial process residues, <b>production</b> <b>scrap,</b> and urban waste using non-aqueous solutions. Here, non-aqueous is not used to imply anhydrous, but rather a low water content. The unit operations are as follows: solvent leaching; separation of the residue; purification of the leach solution by non-aqueous solvent extraction or non-aqueous ion exchange; and metal recovery by precipitation or electrolysis in non-aqueous electrolytes. Solvometallurgy is similar to hydrometallurgy in that both the branches of extractive metallurgy use low-temperature processes, but with solvometallurgy, there is no discrete water phase. Both branches use organic or inorganic solvents (excluding water in the case of solvometallurgy). However, for solvometallurgical processes to be sustainable, they must be based on green solvents, which means that all toxic or environmentally harmful solvents must be avoided. Solvometallurgy is complementary to pyrometallurgy and hydrometallurgy, but this new approach offers several advantages. First, the consumption of water is very limited, and so the generation of wastewater can be avoided. Second, the leaching and solvent extraction can be combined to form a single step, resulting in more simplified process flow sheets. Third, solvent leaching is often more selective than leaching with acidic aqueous solutions, leading to reduced acid consumption and fewer purification steps. Fourth, solvometallurgy is useful for the treatment of ores rich in soluble silica (e. g., eudialyte) because no silica gel is formed. In short, solvometallurgy {{is in a position to}} help develop the near-zero-waste metallurgical processes, and with levels of energy consumption that are much lower than those with the high-temperature processes. The Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of this emerging branch of extractive metallurgy is still low (TRL = 3 – 4), which is a disadvantage for short-term implementation, but offers a great opportunity for further research, development, and innovation. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Impending global environmental- and {{resource}} related problems require {{a transformation of}} the socio-economic metabolism, the inputs, processing and outputs of materials and energy in society. The environmental impacts {{and resource}} requirements of metal cycles can be reduced significantly if they approach a steady state where in-use stocks are maintained through recycling rather than primary metal. In a steady state system, linkages between metal cycles, for example through alloys, impurities and by-products, will become increasingly important due to the high share of recycled post-consumer metal. The aluminium cycle is in this regard particularly important: It is responsible for large greenhouse gas emissions and energy use, highly sensitive to alloying elements and impurities, and has a strong linkage to gallium, which is a by-product of aluminium production. In this thesis, these linkages were studied {{in the context of}} in-use stock saturation and closed-loop material cycles, to better understand their importance, and to identify strategies that can facilitate a transition towards a steady-state socio-economic metabolism. It was found that higher recycling rates are increasingly difficult to achieve in closed-loop steady state systems, due to the accumulation of impurities. A model of aluminium beverage can recycling showed that stable metal impurity concentrations are reached after 5 - 15 recycling loops with recycling rates in the range of 45 - 75 %. It is expected that similar results would apply for systems that are more complex. The increasing availability of automotive aluminium scrap represents a future challenge for recyclers due to the large variety of alloys and limited demand for mixed scrap. A global surplus of scrap may occur in the period 2020 - 2030 unless measures are taken to restructure the recycling system. Allowing recycled material in safety-relevant components, together with an improved sorting of alloys through dismantling or advanced sorting technologies, may delay the surplus with several decades. The global system of production, manufacturing, use and recycling of gallium, and gallium-containing products was described and quantified for 2011. Gallium use is currently driven by neodymium-iron-boron magnets containing gallium as an alloying element and semiconductor applications: integrated circuits, lightemitting diodes and photovoltaic panels. Large material losses occur in the fabrication of intermediate products and devices. Currently, demand is far below the supply potential. Scenario analysis showed that a low stock saturation in the aluminium cycle might cause the supply potential of gallium to fall below future demand, given an increased market penetration of gallium-containing technologies. A number of measures was identified for improving the systemwide material efficiency, among which the most effective are related to process yield improvements or collection of <b>production</b> <b>scrap.</b> The results showed that linkages between material cycles greatly complicate the transition to a steady-state socio-economic metabolism, {{and at the same time}} indicated priorities for measures that can be taken to facilitate this transition...|$|E
