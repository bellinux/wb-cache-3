25|$|Twelvers {{believe that}} Umar <b>pushed</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> into Ali's house and Fatimah, who was pregnant, was crushed behind the door. She miscarried her unborn son, whom the Shia mourn as Muhsin ibn Ali, and soon died of her injuries. Ali buried her {{secretly}} at night, {{since he did}} not want Abu Bakr or Umar (whom he blamed for her death) to attend her funeral, and the Shia blame Abu Bakr and Umar for the deaths of Muhammad's daughter and grandson.|$|E
25|$|After {{serving his}} {{apprenticeship}} in Worcestershire's Second XI {{and for the}} county's Board XI in the 38-County Cup {{for a couple of}} years, Kabir Ali made his first-class debut in a drawn game against Middlesex in September 1999. He bowled respectably enough, taking 2–36 and 1–22, but the match's lateness in the season robbed him of the chance to push for a regular place in the first team. Despite several appearances in the Benson & Hedges Cup in April 2000, including an impressive 4–29 on List A debut, Kabir spent most of the first part of that season still in the second team, although by the summer he had <b>pushed</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> into the full XI. Also in 2000, Kabir was awarded the NBC Denis Compton Award for the most promising young Worcestershire player.|$|E
2500|$|Before the performance, the Quarrymen argued amongst {{themselves}} about the set list, as rock 'n roll songs were definitely not allowed at the club, but skiffle was tolerated. After opening with a skiffle song, John Lennon {{called for the}} others to start playing an Elvis Presley song, [...] "Don't Be Cruel". Rod Davis warned Lennon that the audience would [...] "eat you alive", but Lennon ignored this and started playing the song himself, forcing the others to join in. Halfway through, Sytner <b>pushed</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> through the audience and handed Lennon a note which read, [...] "Cut out the bloody rock 'n roll". Paul McCartney's first appearance at The Cavern was with The Quarrymen on 24 January 1958. (George Harrison first played at The Cavern during a lunchtime session on 9 February 1961.) ...|$|E

2500|$|Before {{their first}} Cavern Club performance, the group argued amongst {{themselves}} about the set list, as rock 'n roll songs {{were not allowed}} at the club, but skiffle was tolerated. After starting with a skiffle song, Lennon told the others to start playing [...] "Don't Be Cruel", by Elvis Presley. Banjo-player Rod Davis warned Lennon that the audience would [...] "eat you alive", which Lennon ignored, starting the song by himself, which forced the others to join in. Halfway through, Sytner <b>pushed</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> through the audience and handed Lennon a note which read, [...] "Cut out the bloody rock 'n roll". In 1959, Sytner sold the club to an accountant, McFall, for £2,750. In 1960, the Quarrymen changed their name, initially to the Silver Beetles, and finally to the Beatles, before their initial residency in Hamburg.|$|E
