60|$|Miss Martha Puff was niece to Miss Flouncer--age {{apparently}} sixteen. It struck me, as I sat {{looking at}} her placid face, that this young lady was well named. Her pink round visage was puffed up with something so soft that I could scarcely venture to call it fat. Her round soft arms were so puffy to look at, that one could not help fearing that an accidental prick from a pin would burst the skin and let them out. She seemed so like trifle in her pink muslin dress, that I could imagine a puff of wind blowing her away altogether. She could {{not be said to}} be puffed up with conceit, poor girl; but she dined almost exclusively on <b>puff</b> <b>paste,</b> <b>to</b> the evident satisfaction of my gallant son Gildart, who paid her marked attention during dinner.|$|E
60|$|Miss Puff {{never spoke}} except when spoken to, {{never asked for}} anything, never remarked upon anything, {{did not seem to}} care for anything, (<b>puff</b> <b>paste</b> excepted), and never thought of anything, as far as I could judge from the {{expression}} of her countenance. Gildart might as well have had a wax doll to entertain.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Puff</b> <b>paste</b> {{must be made}} thus: Take {{a quarter}} of a peck of flour, and rub it into a pound of butter very fine. Make it up into a light paste, with cold water, just stiff enough to work it up. Then roll it out about as thick as a crown piece; put a layer of butter all over, then {{sprinkle}} on a little flour, double it up, and roll it out again. Double and roll it, with layers of butter three times, and it will be properly fit for use.|$|R

Moreover, I {{will say}} for thee, Susan, that thou hast bred the girl as becomes one trained in my household, and unless she have been spoiled by resort to the Scottish woman, she is like to make the lad a moderately good wife, having seen nought of the unthrifty modes of the fine court dames, who queen it with standing ruffs a foot high, and coloured with turmeric, so please you, but who know no more how to bake a marchpane, or roll <b>puff</b> <b>paste,</b> than yonder messan dog!" ...|$|R
50|$|Ancient Greeks are {{believed}} to have originated pie pastry. In the plays of Aristophanes (5th century BC), there are mentions of sweetmeats including small pastries filled with fruit. Nothing is known of the actual pastry used, but the Greeks certainly recognized the trade of pastry-cook as distinct from that of baker. (When fat is added <b>to</b> a flour-water <b>paste</b> it becomes a pastry.) The Romans made a plain pastry of flour, oil, and water to cover meats and fowls which were baked, thus keeping in the juices. (The covering was not meant to be eaten; it filled the role of what was later called <b>puff</b> <b>paste.)</b> A richer pastry, intended to be eaten, was used to make small pasties containing eggs or little birds which were among the minor items served at banquets.|$|R
