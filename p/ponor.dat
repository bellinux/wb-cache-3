25|$|In December, <b>Ponor</b> retired due {{to ongoing}} injuries.|$|E
25|$|In June 2016, <b>Ponor</b> won two bronze {{medals at}} the European Championships. On 6 July, she was {{selected}} to represent Romania at the 2016 Summer Olympics, despite Larisa Iordache's achievement of her fourth consecutive national all around title and citing injury concerns on Iordache. This announcement was made shortly after <b>Ponor</b> was named as Romania's flag bearer for the opening ceremonies, {{the first time this}} honor was given to a gymnast.|$|E
25|$|In March, <b>Ponor</b> began {{training}} {{again with}} the Romanian national team under the newly returned coaches Octavian Bellu and Mariana Bitang.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Ponors</b> {{are found}} worldwide, {{but only in}} karst regions. The entire Adriatic {{watershed}} within Bosnia and Herzegovina sits on Dinaric karst, with numerous explored and probably many more unexplored <b>ponors</b> and underground flows. There are also several places in southeast Europe (Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania, Montenegro, Slovenia) with the name [...] "Ponor" [...] due to associated karst openings. There are significant geological <b>ponors</b> in the Carpathian Mountains, the Dinaric Alps, Greece, Turkey, {{and parts of the}} southern United States.|$|R
50|$|It {{is known}} as a sinking river because {{at the end of its}} course, it flows into a series of <b>ponors</b> or swallow-holes and disappears from the surface. The Lika River rises near the village of Kukljić at the foot of the Velebit Mountains, flows in a northwesterly {{direction}} past the town of Gospić, enters and leaves Lake Krušćica, and continues to the northwest until it sinks into the karst topography at <b>ponors</b> near Lipovo Polje.|$|R
5000|$|The Cave of Kapsia is {{situated}} 1 kilometer {{from the village}} Kapsia, at the southwest edge of the plain of ancient Mantineia. It {{is part of a}} system of active and inactive sinks (<b>ponors)</b> (Greek: katavothra [...] "Καταβόθρα"). In front of the entrance are three <b>ponors.</b> Inside the cave human bone material has been found, according to some researchers from people who drowned during floods in the cave. The cave was used by man during the Neolithic, Hellenistic period and the fourth to sixth century AD.|$|R
25|$|<b>Ponor</b> was {{the first}} female gymnast since Daniela Silivaș in 1988 to win three gold medals at a single Olympics.|$|E
25|$|In June, <b>Ponor</b> competed at the World Cup {{event in}} Ghent, Belgium. She won the balance beam event final {{with a score}} of 15.025.|$|E
25|$|In September, <b>Ponor</b> {{made her}} return in {{competition}} by competing {{in a friendly}} meet between Romania and France where she helped the Romanian team place first.|$|E
25|$|Barceloneta's {{terrain is}} {{predominantly}} plain. Since {{it is located}} in the karst region, it features hills, <b>ponors,</b> and caves. Near the coast, the terrain is occupied by the Tiburones cienaga.|$|R
5|$|Karstic {{limestone}} formations, which {{comprise the}} main geological formations {{of the park}} and the plateau, are found in the park in the form of <b>ponors</b> (sinkholes) in small canyons and rock rims.|$|R
50|$|A polje, in {{geological}} terminology, is a large, flat-floored depression within karst limestone, whose {{long axis}} develops {{in parallel with}} major structural trends and can become several miles (tens of kilometers) long. Superficial deposits tend to accumulate along the floor. Drainage may be either by surface watercourses (as an open polje) or by swallow holes (as a closed polje) or <b>ponors.</b> Usually, the <b>ponors</b> cannot transmit entire flood flows, so many poljes become wet-season lakes. The structure of some poljes {{is related to the}} geological structure, but others are purely the result of lateral dissolution and planation. The development of poljes is fostered by any blockage in the karst drainage.|$|R
25|$|At {{the end of}} August, <b>Ponor</b> competed at the Romanian National Championships in Onesti, Romania. She placed {{second on}} balance beam scoring 15.775 and third on floor scoring 14.625.|$|E
25|$|On August 23, Patterson {{competed in}} the balance beam event final, where she {{received}} a score of 9.775 and won the silver medal behind Cătălina <b>Ponor</b> of Romania.|$|E
25|$|In April, <b>Ponor</b> competed at an {{international}} meet against France in Cholet, France. She contributed scores of 14.900 on vault and 15.550 on balance beam towards the Romanian team's first-place finish.|$|E
40|$|Karst {{ground water}} {{dynamics}} between the Planinsko polje and the springs of Ljubljanica (Slovenia) was studied {{based on the}} monitoring of stage and temperature of ground water in four caves. The Unica River, which flows over the Planinsko Polje, and sinks at its E and N rim, is considered as the main input to the observed system. At small flood events its role is none or questionable. At medium and large events, when the discharge of Unica exceeds 25 m  3 /s, it becomes an important and/or the dominant input to the system. When {{the capacity of the}} primary (eastern) <b>ponors</b> in the polje is exceeded, the stage in a cave, which is fed solely through these <b>ponors,</b> reaches the plateau followed by a very slow recession. The surplus flow goes towards northern <b>ponors</b> causing a fast rise of the stage in adjacent to them. In two of the northernmost caves, the stage response is almost identical, but the temperature variations are different. The uniform water level suggests a highly permeable region bounded by a low permeability barrier in the down-flow direction, while different temperature behavior indicates a different origin of the waters for each cave. </span...|$|R
5000|$|The plateau {{features}} {{several examples}} of Karst topography, including several sinkholes and <b>ponors.</b> The main ones are the Bus de la Lum, [...] Bus della Genziana and Abisso del Col della Rizza, with a deepness of, respectively, -180, -585 and -794 meters.|$|R
5|$|There are cave monasteries which functioned {{during the}} Second Bulgarian Empire as {{religious}} and cultural centres. They are located in karstic rock formations in the plateau and are difficult to access. Some of the notable caves are the Biserna Cave (Pearl Cave) and the Taynite Ponori Cave (the Secret <b>Ponors</b> Cave).|$|R
25|$|In July, <b>Ponor</b> competed at the Romanian National Championships in Ploiesti, Romania. She placed {{first on}} vault {{with a score}} of 15.062 and first on balance beam with a score of 16.500.|$|E
25|$|In September, <b>Ponor</b> competed at the 2007 World Championships in Stuttgart. She {{helped the}} Romanian team place third and {{individually}} she placed {{fourth in the}} balance beam final with a score of 15.700.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of July, <b>Ponor</b> competed at an international meet against France, Germany, and Italy in Bucharest, Romania. She contributed scores of 15.000 on vault, 15.700 on balance beam, and 15.000 on floor toward the Romanian team's first-place finish.|$|E
50|$|As the karst is developing, future {{sinkhole}} stretches {{cannot be}} accurately predicted. The underground river Danube annually removes about 7,000 tons of lime, that is 2,700 cubic meters, from the karst system. Future expansions or collapses {{in the underground}} system are conceivable, which would show above ground as sinkholes or <b>ponors.</b>|$|R
50|$|The area is {{characterized}} by numerous karst features as <b>ponors,</b> underground and intermittent watercourses so {{there are only a}} few major permanent surface watercourses. On the Livno Field permanent waterways are rivers Bistrica, Sturba and Žabljak. The entire field drains to the Cetina and through it belongs to the Adriatic basin.|$|R
50|$|A steephead valley, steephead or blind {{valley is}} a deep, narrow, flat {{bottomed}} valley with an abrupt ending. Such closed valleys may arise in limestone or karst landscapes, where {{a layer of}} permeable rock lies above an impermeable substrate such as marl. Water flowing through a steephead valley leaves via one or more <b>ponors</b> or sinkholes.|$|R
25|$|Later in April, <b>Ponor</b> competed at an {{international}} meet against Germany and the United Kingdom in Ulm, Germany. She contributed scores of 14.750 on vault, 15.100 on balance beam, and 14.900 on floor toward the Romanian team's first-place finish.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ponor</b> {{was born}} in Constanța and started {{gymnastics}} when she was four years old. In 2002, she was discovered training in Constanța by the Romanian national team coaches, Octavian Bellu and Mariana Bitang, who invited her to join the national team.|$|E
25|$|At the European Championships in Cluj-Napoca, <b>Ponor</b> competed on {{beam and}} floor. She missed the floor final because her routine lacked a front {{tumbling}} connection, a requirement. However, she qualified to the beam final {{and won a}} gold medal in front of a home crowd.|$|E
50|$|Rain and meltwater {{accumulate}} on {{the surface}} of the plain, which is made of largely impermeable sediments. The greenish ditches drain the water towards openings called <b>Ponors,</b> which are part of the karstic underground drainage system. If the karst drainage is blocked for any reason, water backs up and turns the plain into a temporary lake.|$|R
50|$|The {{mountain}} {{and its surrounding}} area {{are part of an}} area protetta provinciale (protected provincial area) established by the Provincia di Savona mainly in order to preserve environmental produced by karstic erosion as rock pinnacles, <b>ponors</b> and caves. The area also belongs to the SIC (Site of Community Importance) called Monte Ravinet-Rocca Barbena - code IT 1324011.|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{construction}} of a reservoir on the Neretva River resulted in the flooding of three springs which now function as <b>ponors</b> (swallow-holes). In the first phase, they discharged 28 m 3 s " 1 {{of water from the}} full reservoir. All the water that was lost through these <b>ponors</b> appeared some 1 km downstream from the dam in a group of springs. Most of these springs were, in the natural state, only temporary, and during the dry period their discharge was approximately 1 m 3 s " 1. In order to reduce the losses from the reservoir, some reclamation works were carried out resulting in a decrease of the losses by only 6 m 3 s " 1. Detailed hydrogeological and hydrological analyses were performed with the objective of identifying the karst system, i. e. to determine the position of the karst channels. The definition of the position and dimensions of the karst channel...|$|R
25|$|In October, <b>Ponor</b> competed at the 2011 World Championships in Tokyo. She contributed {{scores of}} 14.933 on vault, 15.166 on balance beam, and 14.633 on floor towards the Romanian team's fourth-place finish and {{individually}} she placed {{seventh in the}} balance beam final with a score of 14.241.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ponor</b> competed at the European Championships in Debrecen, Hungary, in June 2005. She placed {{first on}} balance beam {{with a score}} of 9.737 and fourth on floor with a score of 9.200. That fall, she won a bronze medal on beam (9.500) at the 2005 World Championships in Melbourne.|$|E
25|$|In March 2004, <b>Ponor</b> competed at the World Cup {{event in}} Cottbus, Germany. She placed first on balance beam, scoring 9.700, and second on floor, scoring 9.575. Later in March, she competed at the World Cup event in Lyon, France, and won silver medals on balance beam and floor, scoring 9.175 and 9.625 respectively.|$|E
25|$|Exogenous {{processes}} such as weathering, {{erosion and}} sedimentation have an important impact on modelling the land surface and creating rock formations. The exogenous processes have formed stone rivers in Vitosha; screes in the Balkan Mountains, Rila and Pirin; earth pyramids in Melnik, Stob and Katina; landslides, mainly along the Danube banks and the northern Black Sea coast; fluvial terraces; aeolian forms, such as dunes; karst forms, including numerous caves, sinkholes, <b>ponors,</b> etc.|$|R
50|$|The gypsum karst {{landscape}} with its Zechstein deposits features caves, sink-holes, dolines, <b>ponors</b> and karst springs. As well as beech woods, {{there is a}} roughly 1000-year-old cultural landscape on the steep southern slopes of the South Harz with wood pastures, calcareous grassland and meadows with scattered fruit trees (Streuobstwiesen). Near Sangerhausen there is a former mining {{landscape with}} galleries and tips. Climatically the biosphere reserve lies on the transition between the sub-atlantic and sub-continental zones.|$|R
50|$|Within {{the nature}} park there are <b>ponors,</b> karst springs, {{subsidence}} lakes and dolines {{as well as}} steep gypsum cliffs. Thanks to the many caves, numerous species of bat - including the barbastelle - live in the beech woods, where they find suitable places to roost. It {{is also home to}} the wildcat and lynx. Areas of dry grassland with orchids are the remnants of old meadows and pastures on the karst surfaces.|$|R
