25|$|For example, {{the group}} of {{projective}} geometry in n real-valued dimensions is the symmetry group of n-dimensional real projective space (the general linear group of degree , quotiented by scalar matrices). The affine group will be the subgroup respecting (mapping to itself, not fixing pointwise) the chosen hyperplane at infinity. This subgroup has a known structure (semidirect product of the general linear group of degree n with the subgroup of translations). This description then tells us which properties are 'affine'. In Euclidean <b>plane</b> <b>geometry</b> terms, being a parallelogram is affine since affine transformations always take one parallelogram to another one. Being a circle is not affine since an affine shear will take a circle into an ellipse.|$|E

40|$|The {{theory of}} topological planes (or stable planes, {{to stress the}} {{importance}} of the stability axiom) originates from the foundations of geometry. In fact, a simultaneous axiomatic treatment of the "classical plane geometries" - the euclidean, hyperbolic and elliptic plane - has to combine incidence properties with topological (or ordering) properties as well as some assumptions that nowadays are conveniently stated by means of a group action (distance, or angles, among others). The use of topology instead of an ordering makes it also possible to include, e. g., the complex <b>plane</b> <b>geometries.</b> Of course, the theory will be substantial only if one imposes some conditions on the topologies involved. It turns out that the assumption of locally compactness in combination with connectedness singles out a very manageable class of topological planes. This class includes the planes whose point space is a two-dimensional manifold; i. e., the (topologically) nearest relatives of the classical <b>plane</b> <b>geometries...</b>|$|R

25|$|Since Euclid, {{geometry}} {{had meant}} {{the geometry of}} Euclidean space of two dimensions (<b>plane</b> <b>geometry)</b> or of three dimensions (solid geometry). In {{the first half of}} the nineteenth century there had been several developments complicating the picture. Mathematical applications required geometry of four or more dimensions; the close scrutiny of the foundations of the traditional Euclidean geometry had revealed the independence of the parallel postulate from the others, and non-Euclidean geometry had been born. Klein proposed an idea that all these new geometries are just special cases of the projective geometry, as already developed by Poncelet, Möbius, Cayley and others. Klein also strongly suggested to mathematical physicists that even a moderate cultivation of the projective purview might bring substantial benefits to them.|$|E
25|$|Euclidean {{geometry}} is {{a mathematical}} system {{attributed to the}} Alexandrian Greek mathematician Euclid, which he described in his textbook on geometry: the Elements. Euclid's method consists in assuming a small set of intuitively appealing axioms, and deducing many other propositions (theorems) from these. Although many of Euclid's results had been stated by earlier mathematicians, Euclid {{was the first to}} show how these propositions could fit into a comprehensive deductive and logical system. The Elements begins with <b>plane</b> <b>geometry,</b> still taught in secondary school as the first axiomatic system and the first examples of formal proof. It goes on to the solid geometry of three dimensions. Much of the Elements states results of what are now called algebra and number theory, explained in geometrical language.|$|E

Apollonius of Perga (ca. 262 [...] 190 BC) posed and solved this famous problem in his work [...] ( [...] , [...] "Tangencies"); this work has been lost, but a 4th-century AD report of his results by Pappus of Alexandria has survived. Three given circles generically have eight different circles that are tangent to them (Figure2) and each solution circle encloses or excludes the three given circles in a different way: in each solution, a different subset of the three circles is enclosed (its complement is excluded) and there are 8 subsets of a set whose cardinality is 3, since 8=23.|$|E
