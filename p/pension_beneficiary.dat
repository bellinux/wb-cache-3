Using a hand collected data set on governance factors, the study shows that the external and internal governance mechanisms in pension plans are weak. One explanation for this weakness is the potential conflict between the <b>pension</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> and the fund’s owner, which depends on who bears the investment risk in the pension plan. Hence, different governance factors are found to be important for pension fund return on invested assets and also for its economic performance. Consequently, the overall policy conclusion is that more focus should be put on the governance of the pension funds, taking into account the different interests of the beneficiaries and owners as it may determine their performance...|$|R

However, in pension benefits for retirement the size of the effect is negligible, so the differences detected can be attributed to the large size of the sample. The causes of these differences can be attributed to the sample design (simple random sampling), to administrative errors and to a reclassification of pensioners older than 65 with permanent disability benefits, who are considered as disabled in the CSWL but as retirement <b>pension</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> in the official population statistics.|$|R

40|$|We present {{quasi-experimental}} {{evidence on}} the employment effects of an unprecedented large increase in the early retirement age (ERA).

However, workers may not be able to work longer or may choose other social support programs as exit routes from employment. We study the effects of the ERA increase on employment and potential program substitution in a regression-discontinuity framework. Germany abolished an important early retirement program for women born after 1951, effectively raising the ERA for women by three years. We analyze the effects of this huge increase on employment, unemployment, disability pensions, and inactivity rates. Our results suggest that the reform increased both employment and unemployment rates of women age 60 and over. However, we do not find evidence for active program substitution from employment into alternative social support programs. Instead employed women remained employed and unemployed women remained unemployed. The results suggest an increase in inequality within the affected cohorts...|$|R

40|$|Underfunded {{pension funds}} {{are in the}} same {{position}} as other creditors when their sponsoring firm becomes insolvent, having to join the queue claiming the remaining assets of the firm. Arguments for granting pension fund priority rights over other creditors are the same as for introducing pension benefit guarantee schemes – i. e. market failure and diversification. Arguments against such a priority position focus around the impact on other creditors and potential disruptions to capital markets. The OECD’s report on priority pension claims within bankruptcy found that pension claims (unlike wages) rarely receive priority over other creditors. More concerning, it can be difficult for pension fund creditors (being a diverse group without strong financing) to get their voice heard properly within insolvency procedures. Difficulties with providing such priority status to pension creditors stem from problems with changing bankruptcy laws and the strength of other financial creditors. The OECD’s report concludes that priority rights should be given to unpaid and due contributions from the plan sponsor and that care should be taken that <b>pension</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> be treated at least as well as other creditors in any bankruptcy or restructuring process (e. g. ensuring their representation on creditor committees) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{the study}} was is to {{evaluate}} the impact of a privately accumulated second pillar compo-nent on old-age pension. This evaluation is based on quantitative, statistical data and qualitative analysis of pension accumulation results in second pillar during the years 2004 – 2012. Three groups of different monthly wage size (low, medium, and high) earners are analyzed by calculating the accumulated amounts and old-age pension values of persons who joined and who did not join the second pillar pension funds in 2004 and who re-tired in the beginning of 2013. The pension reform success (or failure) is evaluated {{from the point of view}} of old age <b>pension</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> by comparison of gain or loss of all three groups of participants due to participation in second pillar pension funds. The results show that due to the longer life expectancy the capital accumulated by women in the second pillar does not exceed the present value of loss in the pay-as-you-go system. The com-parison of “official ” annuities exposes a more optimistic result for both genders of participants of fully funded private second pillar pension funds, but is not confirmed by commercial annuities.

40|$|With 'guarantee {{pensions}}', {{we refer}} to minimum pensions that serve the purpose of providing a minimum subsistence security for pensioners. In Finland, this role is played by the national pension, which is offset by any earnings-related pensions paid to its recipient. In the context of minimum pensions, various simulation models have proved useful tools for the forecasting of pensioner populations, of incomes and expenditures, and of the financial balance. An ag-gregate deterministic simulation model has been developed to assist in national pension projections. In many countries, the large post-war baby boom generations are about to reach old-age retirement age. In Finland, this trend will be particularly pronounced in 2010 - 2030. The retirement {{of the baby boom}} generations together with low fer-tility rates will increase the financial burden of retirement provision. Retirement projections suggest that the number of <b>pension</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> in Finland will in-crease by a factor of at least 1. 4. The cost of earnings-related retirement provi-sion is increasing as well. The cost of the Finnish national pension scheme, on the other hand, will not increase in real terms unless pension levels are raised by specific decision. Any pension calculations will be sensitive to the underlying assumptions about economic performance on which they are based. The ability to pay for future pension expenditures will be decisively influenced by realised rates of economic growth...|$|R

In this Article, I explore these and related issues that have arisen in Detroit and other recent municipal bankruptcy cases. Part I of the Article briefly compares liens and a variety of lien substitutes. In Part II, I recount the history of bankruptcy’s statutory lien provision, which honors state liens but not state priorities, and requires that the lien be good both in bankruptcy and outside of bankruptcy. My focus in Part III is the status of general obligation bonds in Detroit, a question which has turned out to have different answers for the two different types of Detroit GO bonds. In Part IV, I explore Rhode Island’s remarkable statute purporting to give a sweeping lien to GO bondholders. I then discuss the question whether pensions can be restructured in bankruptcy in Part V. I conclude that they can, and that the precise status of pension claims turns in large part on bankruptcy’s treatment of trusts...|$|R

40|$|In the United States, {{employers}} {{who have little}} formal accountability largely manage health and retirement benefits of the working class. Employers face {{an enormous amount of}} responsibility to properly manage and protect the health and retirement benefits of their employees and their families. These organizational entities, however, are not subject to similar institutional safeguards as major public pension funds. Thus, Congress enacted the Employment Retirement Income Securities Act to charge employers with fiduciary duties of care over such plans. However, the remedies for those who breach their duty by mishandling funds or arbitrarily dispensing and denying benefits are quite limited. The federal statute that governs preempts all state remedies and all common law tort actions for bad faith. Thus, disappointed policyholders and beneficiaries are limited only to the remedy of ERISA Section 502. ERISA Section 502 establishes an exclusive civil cause of action, but the federal court’s remedy is also quite narrow. Congress’s inclusion of Section 510 ’s whistleblowing, anti-retaliation provision acts as an additional safeguard to counter employers’ significant lack of transparency and accountability by encouraging employees and <b>pension</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> to bring to light any allegations of fiduciary breach. Given the limited public oversight of ERISA plans, a more expansive interpretation of ERISA Section 510 ’s whistleblowing provision is particularly important in order to allow it to be an effective, safeguarding mechanism.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine whether the {{significant}} clustering of defined benefit (DB) pension plan freeze announcements during 2001 - 2006 is motivated at least in part by accounting concerns due to the Financial Accounting Standards Board's pending adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158 (SFAS 158). Design/methodology/approach – Using logistic regression models, the paper compares 147 “freeze firms” with a matched sample of firms that did not announce a DB plan freeze. Empirical models control for other DB plan motives including as a response to stricter contribution requirements under the Pension Protection Act of 2006 and improving the firm's competitive position. Findings – The potential SFAS 158 impact is significantly associated with firms' decisions to freeze their DB plans. Firm profitability is also significantly associated with the freeze decision. However, there is no significant association between cash flow positions or pension plan contributions and the freeze decision. Research limitations/implications – It is possible that economic conditions adversely affecting the funded status of DB plans also motivate the freeze decision. While this study controls for the economic environment, economic factors could exacerbate the potential effect of SFAS 158. Originality/value – This paper considers potential effects of accounting policy by examining its influence on real management actions and has consequences for a variety of stakeholders including investors, creditors, and, importantly, <b>pension</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> and workers, as DB plans represent implicit contracts between firms and their employees.

40|$|The {{spectacular}} {{improvements in}} life expectancy documented {{over the last}} decades constitute an invaluable achievement of modern societies but pose new challenges in multiple areas, threatening in particular the financial sustainability of classic pay-as-you-go social security systems. Traditionally, actuaries have been calculating premiums and reserves using a deterministic mortality intensity, which {{is a function of}} the age only (i. e., considering moment lifetables), and a constant interest rate. This approach is simple and pragmatic but fails to account for the trends observed in mortality intensity. In this thesis, we aim to provide an integrated and systematic approach to the problem of measuring and managing mortality and longevity risks. The thesis offers a detailed review of classic and recent parametric and non-parametric methods used for graduating the mortality curve and for building moment lifetables, including the results of applying parametric methods to the actual mortality experience of life insured and <b>pension</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> in Portugal. We extensively review traditional methods used to project mortality and investigate new solutions for building dynamic or prospective lifetables. These tools were empirically tested and then used to build prospective lifetables for both the Portuguese and pensioners populations and to address the importance of adverse selection effects in the Portuguese market. We develop a dynamic and stochastic approach to longevity risk by admitting that the mortality intensity can be modelled, either by affine-jump stochastic processes, or by an affine function of latent factors whose dynamics is given by ordinary differential equations with jumps. This allows us to capture two important features of the mortality intensity: time dependency and uncertainty of the future development and provides us with closed-form solutions for the survival probability. The analytical tractability of affine processes is explored in actuarial applications. We evaluate a number of both internal and external strategies designed to hedge and transfer longevity and mortality risks, including capital markets-based solutions and the development of mortality-derivatives...|$|R
