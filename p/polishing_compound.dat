50|$|Bone ash {{is used in}} machine {{shops for}} various purposes. Examples include <b>polishing</b> <b>compounds,</b> {{protective}} powder coatings for metal tools, and as a sealant for seams and cracks. As a powder coating, bone ash has many unique characteristics. First of all, the powder has high thermal stability, so it maintains its form in extremely high temperatures. The powder coating itself adheres to metal well and does not drip, run, cause much corrosion, or create noticeable streaks. Using the bone ash is easy as well, as it comes in a powder form, is easy to clean up, and does not separate into smaller parts (therefore requiring no extra mixing).|$|R
5000|$|A {{razor strop}} (or razor strap) is a {{flexible}} strip of leather, canvas, denim fabric, balsa wood, or other soft material, used to straighten and polish {{the blade of}} a straight razor, a knife, or a woodworking tool like a chisel. In many cases stropping re-aligns parts of the blade edge that have been bent out of alignment. In other cases, especially when abrasive <b>polishing</b> <b>compound</b> is used, stropping may remove {{a small amount of}} metal. Stropping can also burnish (i.e. push metal around on) the blade.|$|E
50|$|Using a {{thin coat}} of polish can prevent tarnish from forming over these metals. Tarnish {{can be removed}} by using steel wool, sandpaper, emery paper, baking soda or a file to rub or polish the metal's dull surface.

50|$|Diving watches have {{relatively}} thick watch crystals. Sometimes domed crystals {{are used to}} enhance the pressure-resistance of the watch and to improve the watch face legibility under water. The typical materials used for crystals are acrylic glass, hardened glass and synthetic sapphire which all have their pros and cons. Acrylic glass is very resistant to breakage; it can easily be scratched, but small scratches can be buffed out with <b>polishing</b> <b>compounds.</b> Hardened glass is more scratch-resistant than acrylic glass and less brittle than sapphire. Sapphire is very scratch-resistant but less shatterproof than the other options. Anti-reflective coatings are generally applied on sapphire crystals to enhance the legibility of the watch. Some manufacturers use sapphire/hardened glass laminate crystals, where the scratch-resistance of sapphire is combined with the better shatter-resistance of hardened glass.|$|R
5000|$|Ultrasonic {{cleaning}} uses cavitation bubbles {{induced by}} high frequency pressure (sound) waves to agitate a liquid. The agitation produces high forces on contaminants adhering to substrates like metals, plastics, glass, rubber, and ceramics. This action also penetrates blind holes, cracks, and recesses. The {{intention is to}} thoroughly remove all traces of contamination tightly adhering or embedded onto solid surfaces. Water or solvents can be used, {{depending on the type}} of contamination and the workpiece. Contaminants can include dust, dirt, oil, pigments, rust, grease, algae, fungus, bacteria, lime scale, <b>polishing</b> <b>compounds,</b> flux agents, fingerprints, soot wax and mold release agents, biological soil like blood, and so on. Ultrasonic cleaning can be used for a wide range of workpiece shapes, sizes and materials, and may not require the part to be disassembled prior to cleaning.|$|R

While working in Detroit after receiving his bachelor's degree, Katz and several colleagues rented a room in a Detroit office building and used it as a laboratory. They carried out independent research from 1932 through 1939, trying to cure tuberculosis by finding a substance that could dissolve the fatty outer coating of the TB bacillus so that it would be vulnerable to being destroyed by a drug. He and a Detroit colleague published two papers on studies with the bacterium Mycobacterium smegmatis, a fast-growing and non-pathogenic bacillus with similar physical properties to the tuberculosis bacillus.|$|R
5000|$|The dopped {{stone is}} ground at precise angles and indexes on cutting laps of {{progressively}} finer grit, {{and then the}} process is repeated a final time to polish each facet. Accurate repetition of angles in the cutting and polishing process is aided by the angle readout and index gear. The physical process of polishing is a subject of debate. One commonly accepted {{theory is that the}} fine abrasive particles of a <b>polishing</b> <b>compound</b> produce abrasions smaller than the wavelengths of light, thus making the minute scratches invisible. Since gemstones have two sides (the crown and pavilion), a device often called a [...] "transfer jig" [...] is used to flip the stone so that each side may be cut and polished.|$|E
40|$|Laser-induced {{damage on}} optical {{surfaces}} is {{often associated with}} absorbing contaminants introduced by the polishing process. This is particularly the case for UV optics. Here secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) was used to measure depth profiles of finished process contamination on fused silica surfaces. Contaminants detected include the major <b>polishing</b> <b>compound</b> components (Ce or Zr from CeO 2 or ZrO 2), Al presently largely because of the use of Al 2 O 3 in the final cleaning process (Fe, Cu,Cr) incorporated during the polishing step or earlier grinding steps. Depth profile data typically showed an exponential decay of contaminant concentration to a depth of 100 - 200 nm. This depth is consistent with a polishing redeposition layers formed during the chemo-mechanical polishing of fused silica. Peak contaminant levels are typically in the 10 - 100 ppm range, except for Al with exceeds 1000 ppm. A strong correlation has been shown between the presence of a gray haze damage morphology and the use of CeO 2 <b>polishing</b> <b>compound.</b> No strong correlation was found however between high levels of Ce, or any other contaminant and the low damage threshold was observed. In fact one of the strongest indications of a correlation is between increased damage thresholds and increased Zr contamination. This suggests that the correlation between redeposition layer and laser damage threshold is not simple an absorbing contaminant issue...|$|E

5000|$|A {{very fine}} powder of ferric oxide {{is known as}} [...] "jeweler's rouge", [...] "red rouge", or simply rouge. It is used to put the final polish on {{metallic}} jewelry and lenses, and historically as a cosmetic. Rouge cuts more slowly than some modern polishes, such as cerium(IV) oxide, but is still used in optics fabrication and by jewelers for the superior finish it can produce. When polishing gold, the rouge slightly stains the gold, which contributes to {{the appearance of the}} finished piece. Rouge is sold as a powder, paste, laced on polishing cloths, or solid bar (with a wax or grease binder). Other <b>polishing</b> <b>compounds</b> are also often called [...] "rouge", even when they do not contain iron oxide. Jewelers remove the residual rouge on jewelry by use of ultrasonic cleaning.

In this report, the surface polishing experiments are conducted on silicon wafers and the polishing characteristics are examined. The following results are obtained : (1) When the clearance between the polisher and the work surface exceeds the definite value, the polishing rate decreases extremely. (2) The use of water based magnetic fluid yields lower polishing rate but smoother surface in comparison with kerosene based magnetic fluid. (3) The surface roughness of polished surface basically depends on grain size and the roughness {{of the order of}} nanometers is obtained with fine abrasive grain...|$|E
40|$|Polishing {{of silicon}} nitride has been {{conducted}} by using a newly-developed finishing setup which is able to give the polishing pressure to the workpiece.

The experimental results on the silicon wafer which is placed apart from the electrode showed that the stock removal rate increases with increasing the applied potential. Examination of the surface profile of the polished specimen indicated that the surface roughness decreases with increasing the potential. It can be said that the surface finishing characteristics are controllable by varying the current to the electrode...|$|E
40|$|Polishing {{is widely}} used as a final {{processing}} operation for many products and components. Although the level of automation increases gradually over the years, manual or semi-automatic polishing is still commonly practised. The choice of polishing process parameters is largely based on experience of polishing technicians and involves a lengthy "trial and error" iteration before reaching an acceptable level. This paper proposes to acquire successful projects and build up a case repository of polishing parameters of both products and processes. Case-based reasoning (CBR) is then applied to mimic the experience-based polishing process planning. A problem case is first well-structured and then matched against all cases in the repository. The most similar ones are retrieved for further reasoning for their potentials of being revised and adapted to form an optimal solution. This research combines Fuzzy Set Theory with CBR to address two fundamental problems in polishing process planning. One is that values of product features and process parameters such as polishing force, amount of <b>polishing</b> <b>compounds,</b> <b>polishing</b> wheels, rotating speed, and feed rate cannot be exactly measured and controlled. The other is that influencing relationships between process parameters and polishing quality indicators as measured by surface roughness (Ra) and grossness (Gu) cannot be scientifically established mathematically. A case study is conducted within the collaborating company and {{the results from the}} proposed system are generally consistent with the actual decisions. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
50|$|However, {{when the}} {{patterns}} occur from {{a difference in}} carbon content, there will be distinct indications of this near the hamon, because the steel with higher hardenability will become martensite beyond the hamon while the adjacent layers will turn into pearlite. This leaves a distinct pattern of bright nioi, which appear as bright streaks or lines that follow the layers {{a short distance away}} from the hamon and into the hira, giving the hamon a wispy or misty appearance. The patterns were most likely revealed during the polishing operation by using a method similar to lapping, without bringing the steel to a full polish, although sometimes chemical reactions with the <b>polishing</b> <b>compounds</b> may have also been used to provide a level of etching. The differences in hardness primarily appear as a difference in the microscopic scratches left on the surface. The harder metal produces shallower scratches, so it diffuses the reflected light, while the softer metal has deeper, longer scratches, appearing either shiny or dark depending on the viewing angle.|$|R
40|$|Various {{mechanical}} properties of whole endosperm, starch granules, and storage protein deposits {{were compared to}} determine whether the findings were consistent with the current theories on wheat hardness. All mechanical measurements were performed in situ without the use of solvents, resins, or <b>polishing</b> <b>compounds</b> that could alter the properties of the specimens. The results showed that the starch and protein components had elastic and creep properties. There {{were no significant differences in}} any of the {{mechanical properties}} of the starch and protein components either within a variety or among soft, hard, and durum wheat types. Tensile strength (Su), compressive strength (Smax), toughness (Wmax), modulus of elasticity (E) and strain to fracture (emax) were measured in samples of whole endosperm from various soft, hard, and durum wheats. The mean values for each parameter were highest for durum caryopses and lowest for non-vitreous caryopses of soft wheats. The hard wheat samples were intermediate. The mechanical properties of some vitreous caryopses of two soft wheat varieties were comparable to those of durum and hard wheat caryopses. These results do not support theories that suggest endosperm hardness is directly attributable to a cell product made exclusively in either hard or soft wheat varieties...|$|R
