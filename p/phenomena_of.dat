5|$|Due to {{the warm}} waters of the Great Salt Lake, lake effect snowfalls are {{frequent}} <b>phenomena</b> <b>of</b> the surrounding area. Cold north, northwest, or west winds generally blow across the lake following {{the passage of a}} cold front, and the temperature difference between the warm lake and the cool air can form clouds that lead to precipitation downwind of the lake. It is typically heaviest from eastern Tooele County east and north into central Davis County. It can deposit excessive snowfall amounts, generally with a narrow band of snow highly dependent on the direction the wind is blowing.|$|E
5|$|HeliumII is a superfluid, {{a quantum}} {{mechanical}} state (see: macroscopic quantum <b>phenomena)</b> <b>of</b> matter with strange properties. For example, when it flows through capillaries {{as thin as}} 10−7 to 10−8m it has no measurable viscosity. However, when measurements were done between two moving discs, a viscosity {{comparable to that of}} gaseous helium was observed. Current theory explains this using the two-fluid model for helium II. In this model, liquid helium below the lambda point is viewed as containing a proportion of helium atoms in a ground state, which are superfluid and flow with exactly zero viscosity, and a proportion of helium atoms in an excited state, which behave more like an ordinary fluid.|$|E
5|$|The {{lower jaw}} was slender {{and had no}} mandibular fenestra, {{a hole in the}} side of the lower jawbone {{commonly}} seen in archosaurs. The teeth were small but sharp, suited for its diet of small vertebrates and possibly other small animals, such as insects. Its frontmost teeth (those on the premaxilla) were unserrated, unlike those further back in the jaw which were flattened and more strongly recurved. Scientists have used these dental characteristics to identify Compsognathus and its closest relatives. Reisdorf and Wuttke (2012) described the taphonomical <b>phenomena</b> <b>of</b> the German specimen of Compsognathus.|$|E

40|$|The present {{treatise}} tackles the <b>phenomenon</b> <b>of</b> boredom {{by first}} providing reasons for evading the dualistic {{approach to the}} phenomenon addressed. Based on the Cartesian criticism of the oversimplified dualist approach of neuroscience, the paper delves into the phenomenological approach to the <b>phenomenon</b> <b>of</b> boredom, as could be only indirectly surmised from Husserl’s (basically Cartesian) transcendental phenomenology of time consciousness. The next chapter deals with Heidegger’s hermeneutic phenomenology as implicated in his compelling and as of yet unsurpassed analysis <b>of</b> the <b>phenomenon</b> <b>of</b> boredom. Through approaching the <b>phenomenon</b> <b>of</b> boredom via Husserl and Heidegger, the basic discontinuity between Husserl’s transcendental and Heidegger’s hermeneutic phenomenology comes clearly to the fore...|$|R
5|$|Thompson {{points out}} that all changes of form are <b>phenomena</b> <b>of</b> growth. He {{analyses}} growth curves for man, noting rapid growth before birth {{and again in the}} teens; and then curves for other animals. In plants, growth is often in pulses, as in Spirogyra, peaks at a specific temperature, and below that value roughly doubles every 10 degrees Celsius. Tree growth varies cyclically with season (less strongly in evergreens), preserving a record of historic climates. Tadpole tails regenerate rapidly at first, slowing exponentially.|$|E
5|$|Following Asilomar, new genetic {{engineering}} techniques and applications developed rapidly. DNA sequencing methods improved greatly (pioneered by Frederick Sanger and Walter Gilbert), as did oligonucleotide synthesis and transfection techniques. Researchers learned {{to control the}} expression of transgenes, and were soon racing—in both academic and industrial contexts—to create organisms capable of expressing human genes {{for the production of}} human hormones. However, this was a more daunting task than molecular biologists had expected; developments between 1977 and 1980 showed that, due to the <b>phenomena</b> <b>of</b> split genes and splicing, higher organisms had a much more complex system of gene expression than the bacteria models of earlier studies. The first such race, for synthesizing human insulin, was won by Genentech. This {{marked the beginning of the}} biotech boom (and with it, the era of gene patents), with an unprecedented level of overlap between biology, industry, and law.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we will try}} to show {{relation}} between <b>phenomenon</b> <b>of</b> kitsch and <b>phenomenon</b> <b>of</b> falling (Das Verfallen) and through that the <b>phenomenon</b> <b>of</b> forgetting in everydayness of human life. The <b>phenomenon</b> <b>of</b> kitsch we shall analyse through the work of novelist Milan Kundera (1929 –) and his novel The Unbearable Lightness of Being (1984). We will try to show, with the help of method of comparison and synthesis, that Kundera’s view on kitsch as a phenomenon that helps forgetting the face of death gets its philosophical conformation in the <b>phenomenon</b> <b>of</b> falling introduced by Martin Heidegger (1889 – 1976) in his work Being and Time (1927). Finally, {{we will try to}} explicate, on the one hand, connections and interrelations of an art piece such as novel and a philosophical system through the mentioned phenomena. On the other hand, we will try to show that the phenomenon that comes into present through kitsch and fal ling is <b>phenomenon</b> <b>of</b> forgetting death. If kitsch and falling are something in human life that is closest and nearest, as Heidegger and Kundera claim, the leading question of our investigation is throwing itself before us: is forgetting death fundamental moment of everydayness?
