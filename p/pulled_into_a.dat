5|$|The 2006–07 season saw Nolan {{take over}} from the {{departed}} Jay-Jay Okocha as club captain. His three league goals helped Bolton to again qualify for the UEFA Cup. Nolan's long throw-in set up a goal, which helped Bolton achieve a 2–2 draw away against German champions Bayern Munich, who dominated the match. Despite reaching the first knockout round, Bolton's league form suffered as they were <b>pulled</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> relegation fight, eventually finishing the season one point above the relegation zone in 16th. Nolan scored in the 2–0 win over Sunderland in May that virtually secured the club's Premier League status.|$|E

5|$|After sinking Majestic, Hersing {{took his}} {{submarine}} to refuel at a Turkish port before attempting the dangerous route through the Dardanelles to Constantinople. While transiting the straits, U-21 was nearly <b>pulled</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> whirlpool but the Germans managed to escape. After {{arriving in the}} Ottoman capital, the crew were given a large welcoming ceremony attended by Enver Pasha. U-21 required significant maintenance, and so the crew was given a month of shore leave while the repairs were carried out. Once the repair work was finished, U-21 sortied through the Dardanelles for another patrol. Hersing spotted the Allied munitions ship Carthage, which he sank with a single torpedo. Later on the patrol, a lookout on an Allied trawler spotted U-21s periscope; the Germans had to crash dive to escape from being rammed, but doing so brought them into a minefield. One mine exploded off the U-boat's stern but it caused no significant damage, and U-21 was able to withdraw to Constantinople.|$|E

25|$|The {{shape of}} Proteus {{is close to}} a sphere with a radius of about 210km, {{although}} deviations from the spherical shape are large—up to 20km; scientists believe it is about {{as large as a}} body of its density can be without being <b>pulled</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> perfect spherical shape by its own gravity. Saturn's moon Mimas has an ellipsoidal shape despite being slightly less massive than Proteus, perhaps due to the higher temperature near Saturn or tidal heating. Proteus is slightly elongated in the direction of Neptune, although its overall shape is closer to an irregular polyhedron than to a triaxial ellipsoid. The surface of Proteus shows several flat or slightly concave facets measuring from 150 to 200km in diameter. They are probably degraded impact craters.|$|E
25|$|Cash {{was very}} close to his older brother, Jack. In May 1944, Jack was <b>pulled</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> {{whirling}} head saw in the mill where he worked and was almost cut in two.

According to Cash: The Autobiography, his father was away that morning, but Johnny and his mother, and Jack himself, all had premonitions or a sense of foreboding about that day. His mother urged Jack to skip work and go fishing with his brother. Jack insisted on working since the family needed the money. On his deathbed, Jack said he had visions of Heaven and angels. Decades later, Cash spoke of looking forward to meeting his brother in Heaven.|$|E

Kon-El is later revealed to travel all across the world and train and practice various forms of meditation and inner peace of mind as indicated in Supergirl comics. He later joins the Teen Titans.|$|E

25|$|This {{left only}} three {{candidates}} {{to run in}} the Democratic primary: Osborn, Sutter and Colter. On September 10, early returns showed Sutter with a slight lead over Colter. With only 29 of 82 statewide precincts counted, Sutter had 772 votes to Colter's 755, with Osborn a distant third with 71. However. by the time 79 precincts had tallied their votes, Colter had <b>pulled</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> commanding lead, with the three final precincts to be counted being small. Colter won the Democratic primary in September 1918, garnering 44% of the total votes, 14,539 to Sutter's 10,108 and Osborn's 8,390. In doing so, he won 12 of Arizona's then 14 counties. After his winning the nomination, his eligibility was questioned due to his involvement in the state legislature in raising the salary of the office of the governor during the prior year. Attempts were made to influence Colter and the state Democratic committee to have Colter withdraw from the race, however those attempts were thwarted.|$|E
25|$|The first {{movement}} {{revolves around}} a diatonic melody that soon develops into complex pianistic figuration. The second theme opens with quiet exchanges between the orchestra and the piano before fully diving {{into the second}} theme in B major. The {{first part of the}} first theme is restated before the movement is <b>pulled</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> loud development section which opens with toccata like quavers in the piano and reaches a loud chordal section. The whole development exhibits features similar to a canon, such as an eighth note passage in the piano in which the left hand and the right hand play overlapping figures. The movement reaches a number of ferocious climaxes, especially in the cadenza. Rachmaninoff wrote two versions of this cadenza: the chordal original, which is commonly notated as the ossia, and a second one with a lighter, toccata-like style. Both cadenzas lead into a quiet solo section where the flute, oboe, clarinet and horn restate the first theme of the exposition, accompanied by delicate arpeggios in the piano. The cadenza then ends quietly, but the piano alone continues to play a quiet development of the exposition's second theme in E major before leading to the recapitulation, where the first theme is restated by the piano, with the orchestra accompanying, soon closing with a quiet, rippling coda reminiscent of the second theme.|$|E

25|$|In late October it was {{announced}} that Colter had come down with the flu. He had to curtail his campaign activities and was hospitalized in Phoenix on October 25. Supporters of Colter approached Sutter to request he write a public letter endorsing Colter. Sutter agreed, but with the provision that the letter also include his feelings towards Hunt, which were not favorable. Colter's supporters withdrew their request. A main point of the opposition to Colter's candidacy was lack of denouncing the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), which might have been due to Hunt's support for the organization. The general election, on November 5, was hotly contested and incredibly close. Two days after the election, both sides were still declaring victory. As counting continued, Campbell <b>pulled</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> slight lead of approximately 150 votes by November 9; a lead which had widened to 338 by November 13, although Colter refused to concede. With Campbell holding the slight lead, the results were set to become official on Monday, November 18. However, on the 19th the count was still continuing in Maricopa County. Finally, on November 23 it {{was announced}} that Colter had conceded the race to Campbell. While Colter won 9 of the state's 14 counties, he lost by a large margin in Maricopa. The final tally was Campbell 25,927 and Colter 25,588, with the third party socialist candidate, George D. Smith garnering 444 votes. Smith's number of votes was larger than the number of votes by which Campbell won the election. Following his defeat, Colter went back into resting, recuperating from the flu he had come down with in late October.|$|E
