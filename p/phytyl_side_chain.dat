40|$|Knowledge of {{the role}} of {{individual}} <b>side</b> <b>chains</b> in forming different secondary structures such as the alpha-helix would be useful for prediction of protein structure from sequence or de novo protein design. Experimental and theoretical studies on natural and synthetic peptides and proteins indicate that individual <b>side</b> <b>chains</b> differ in their helix-forming potential. Four aliphatic <b>side</b> <b>chains</b> occur in the standard complement of amino acids: alanine and leucine are helix stabilizing, whereas isoleucine and valine are weakly destabilizing. We have synthesized a series of helical peptides containing unnatural aliphatic <b>side</b> <b>chains</b> having two to four carbons to explore some of the factors involved in alpha-helix stabilization and the basis for selection of the natural set. We find that linear <b>side</b> <b>chains</b> with two, three, or four carbons are as strongly helix stabilizing as the single methyl in alanine and that all linear <b>side</b> <b>chains</b> are stronger helix promoters than leucine.

The incorporation and depletion of 2 R, 4 'R, 8 'R-α-tocopherol (RRR-α-T), a natural form of vitamin E, and its subsequent effect on the metabolism of arachidonic acid were conducted on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in culture. HUVECs incorporated physiological and pharmacological concentrations of RRR-α-T in a time- and dose-dependent manner.

40|$|Phylloquinone (vitamin K 1) is a bipartite {{molecule}} {{that consists}} of a naphthoquinone ring attached to a <b>phytyl</b> <b>side</b> <b>chain.</b> The coupling of these 2 moieties depends on the hydrolysis of the CoA thioester of 1, 4 -dihydroxy- 2 -naphthoate (DHNA), which forms the naphthalenoid backbone. It is not known whether such a hydrolysis is enzymatic or chemical. In this study, comparative genomic analyses identified orthologous genes of unknown function that in most species of cyanobacteria cluster with predicted phylloquinone biosynthetic genes.

The Synechocystis ortholog, encoded by gene slr 0204, was expressed as a recombinant protein and was found to form DHNA as reaction product. Unlike its homologs in the Hotdog domain family, Slr 0204 showed strict substrate specificity. The Synechocystis slr 0204 knockout was devoid of DHNA-CoA thioesterease activity and accumulated DHNA-CoA. As a result, knockout cells contained 13 -fold less phylloquinone than their wild-type counterparts and displayed the typical photosensitivity to high light associated to phylloquinone deficiency in cyanobacteria...|$|E

This protein-bound selenide was associated particularly with the mitochon-dna and smooth endoplasmic reticulum, and its presence in significant amounts in these or-ganelles was dependent {{on the presence of}} vitamin E in the diet given to the rats (4). To explain these observations we have suggested (1, 2) that the selenide may form a part of the active center of non-heme iron-containing pro-teins that have a functional role in electron transport in mitochondria and smooth endo-plasmic reticulum, and that are protected from oxidation by vitamin E or by synthetic anti-oxidants.

These samples were analyzed by gas chromatography-electron impact mass spectrometry for their phytol and 3 -methylidene- 3, 7, 11 -trimethylhexadecan- 1, 2 -diol (phytyldiol) content. The corresponding Chlorophyll <b>Phytyl</b> <b>side</b> <b>chain</b> Photodegradation Index, molar ratio of phytyldiol to phytol, was calculated and the mean amount of chlorophyll photodegraded within the euphotic zone estimated. Seasonal differences in the chlorophyll photodegradation process appear in the one-year study. The chlorophyll appeared more photodegraded in the surface water (generally more than 40 % photodegraded at 5 - 10 m) than at the deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) (40 - 50 m) observed in the summer stratified waters (about 20 % photodegraded). This difference was attributed to the healthy state of the phytoplankton community (coincidence with the highest primary production levels) and to the lower intensity of irradiance at the DCM level. On the other hand, the bulk of the detrital chlorophyll (chlorophyll associated with phytodetritus, phaeopigments) undergoes photodegradation before it sinks out of the photic zone. However, in January (winter mixed water) the pigments exported towards the sea floor were less photodegraded. This is thought to result from a shorter period of residence of the pigments in the photic zone due to vertical convection and grazing activity of macrozooplankton (salps), which are producers of rapid sinking fecal pellets...|$|E

40|$|The {{exceptional}} {{ability of}} α-tocopherol (α-TOH) for scavenging free radicals {{is believed to}} also underlie its protective functions in respiratory epithelia. Phenols, however, can scavenge other reactive species. Herein, we report that α-TOH/α-TO^− reacts with closed-shell O_ 3 (g) {{on the surface of}} inert solvent microdroplets in < 1 ms to produce persistent α-TO−O_n^−(n = 1 − 4) adducts detectable by online thermospray ionization mass spectrometry. The prototype phenolate PhO^−, in contrast, undergoes electron transfer under identical conditions. These reactions are deemed to occur at the gas/liquid interface because their rates: (1) depend on pH, (2) are several orders of magnitude faster than within microdroplets saturated with O_ 3 (g). They also fail to incorporate solvent into the products: the same α-TO−On^− species are formed on acetonitrile or nucleophilic methanol microdroplets. α-TO−O_n(= 1 − 3) ^− signals initially evolve with [O_ 3 (g) ] as expected from first-generation species, but α-TO−O^− reacts further with O_ 3 (g) and undergoes collisionally induced dissociation into a C_(19) H_(40) fragment (vs C_(19) H_(38) from α-TO^−) carrying the <b>phytyl</b> <b>side</b> <b>chain,</b> whereas the higher α-TO−O_(n≥ 2) ^− homologues are unreactive toward O_ 3 (g) and split CO_ 2 instead.

40|$|Phylloquinone (vitamin K 1) is a bipartite molecule, {{consisting}} of a naphthoquinone ring attached to a <b>phytyl</b> <b>side</b> <b>chain,</b> that is synthesized by plants and certain cyanobacteria {{to serve as an}} electron carrier in photosystem I. The coupling of the ring and isoprenyl moieties relies on the cleavage of the CoA-thioester linkage with 1, 4 -dihydroxy- 2 - naphthoate (DHNA). It has long been a mystery if this hydrolysis is an enzymatic or chemical process. Using comparative genomics, protein biochemistry, genetics and metabolic profiling, we identified a cyanobacterial thioesterase responsible for the in vivo hydrolysis of DHNA-CoA. This enzyme bears a signature domain of the 4 - hydroxybenzoyl-CoA thioesterase (4 HBT) family of Hotdog-fold proteins. Surprisingly, plants, which obtained most of their phylloquinone biosynthetic genes with the acquisition of the plastid, do not contain orthologs of cyanobacterial DHNA-CoA thioesterase. We tested all of the predicted 4 HBT Hotdog-fold proteins in Arabidopsis by functional complementation of the cyanobacterial mutant. We found two genes encoding functional DHNA-CoA thioesterases that display low percentages of identity and dissimilar catalytic motifs from their cyanobacterial counterparts. It appears that plant DHNA-CoA thioesterases originated from a horizontal gene transfer with a species of the Lactobacillales order. The cognate T-DNA knockout lines exhibit reduced DHNA-CoA thioesterase activity and phylloquinone content. Fluorescently tagging the Arabidopsis enzymes revealed that they are localized to the peroxisome. Subcellular fractionation assays confirmed this providing the first biochemical evidence for the involvement of peroxisomes in phylloquinone biosynthesis. Recent proteomics and GFP-reporter projects suggest that the two steps preceding DHNA-CoA thioesterase are also peroxisomal. Thus, the current model of phylloquinone biosynthesis reflects a split between plastids and peroxisomes, implying the movement of intermediates between the organelles. To assess the importance of the cognate transport steps, we have re-routed the peroxisomal branch of the pathway to plastids in Camelina sativa.

The major pathway of tocopherol metabolism is via <b>phytyl</b> <b>side</b> <b>chain</b> oxidation, leaving carboxyethyl-hydroxychromans (CEHC) as metabolites. Alpha and gamma CEHC are water soluble, renally excreted, with known potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties. MethodsWe examined serum alpha and gamma tocopherol and respective CEHC concentrations in 15 healthy subjects and 15 chronic hemodialysis patients. ResultsSerum alpha tocopherol levels were similar in hemodialysis patients (12. 03 ± 1. 34 μg/mL) and healthy subjects (11. 21 ± 0. 20 μg/mL), while serum gamma tocopherol levels were significantly greater in hemodialysis patients (3. 17 ± 0. 37 μg/mL) compared to healthy subjects (1. 08 ± 0. 06 μg/mL, P < 0. 0001). Serum alpha and gamma CEHC levels were tenfold and sixfold higher in hemodialysis patients compared to healthy subjects, respectively (both P < 0. 0001). Serum alpha and gamma tocopherol levels and CEHC metabolites were also measured after supplementation of alpha- or gamma-enriched mixed tocopherols in both hemodialysis patients and healthy subjects. Tocopherol administration resulted in modest or nonsignificant changes in serum tocopherol concentrations, while markedly increasing serum CEHC concentrations in both healthy subjects and hemodialysis patients. Hemodialysis resulted in {{no change in the}} serum alpha or gamma tocopherol concentrations while decreasing serum alpha CEHC and gamma CEHC levels by 63 % and 53 %, respectively (both P = 0. 001 versus predialysis). Fourteen-day administration of gamma-enriched but not alpha tocopherols lowered median C-reactive protein (CRP) significantly in hemodialysis patients (4. 4 to 2. 1 mg/L, P < 0. 02). ConclusionFirst, serum alpha and gamma CEHC accumulate in uremic patients compared to healthy subjects; second, supplementation with tocopherols dramatically increases serum CEHC levels in both healthy subjects and hemodialysis patients; and, finally, CEHC accumulation may mediate anti-inflammatory and antioxidative effects of tocopherols in hemodialysis patients...|$|E

We find that both chirality and reduced <b>side</b> <b>chain</b> flexibility lower the folding entropy significantly for globally compact conformations, suggesting that they are important properties of residues to ensure fast folding and stable native structure. This corresponds well with our finding that natural amino acid residues have reduced effective flexibility, as evidenced by analysis of rotamer libraries and <b>side</b> <b>chain</b> rotatable bonds. We further develop a method calculating the exact side-chain entropy for a given back bone structure.

40|$|We report six {{asymmetric}} alkylated anthracene-based molecules {{with different}} alkyl <b>side</b> <b>chain</b> lengths {{for use in}} organic field-effect transistors (OFETs). Alkyl <b>side</b> <b>chains</b> can potentially improve the solubility and processability of anthracene derivatives. The crystallinity and charge mobility of the anthracene derivatives may be improved by optimizing the <b>side</b> <b>chain</b> length. The highest field-effect mobility of the devices prepared here was 0. 55 cm 2 /(V s), for 2 -(p-pentylphenylethynyl) anthracene (PPEA). The moderate <b>side</b> <b>chain</b> length appeared to be optimal for promoting self-organization among asymmetric anthracene derivatives in OFETs, and was certainly better than the short or long alkyl <b>side</b> <b>chain</b> lengths, as confirmed by X-ray diffraction measurements...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a server {{that allows the}} interrogation of the Protein Data Bank for hypothetical 3 D <b>side</b> <b>chain</b> patterns that {{are not limited to}} known patterns from existing 3 D structures. A minimal <b>side</b> <b>chain</b> description allows a variety of <b>side</b> <b>chain</b> orientations to exist within the pattern, and generic <b>side</b> <b>chain</b> types such as acid, base and hydroxyl-containing can be additionally deployed in the search query. Moreover, only a subset of distances between the <b>side</b> <b>chains</b> need be specified. We illustrate these capabilities in case studies involving arginine stacks, serine-acid group arrangements and multiple catalytic triad-like configurations. The IMAAAGINE server can be accessed at [URL]...|$|R
40|$|The {{equilibrium}} conformations {{of isolated}} comb copolymer ring molecules in an athermal solution are investigated by off-lattice Monte Carlo simulations. The molecules considered {{consist of a}} closed flexible backbone densely grafted with flexible or rigid <b>side</b> <b>chains.</b> The study focuses {{on the influence of}} the length of the <b>side</b> <b>chains</b> on the conformational behavior. As a function of the <b>side</b> <b>chain</b> length the structure gradually stiffens until the size of the <b>side</b> <b>chains</b> approaches the diameter of the ring. Longer <b>side</b> <b>chains</b> do not influence the backbone conformation any further. The results are compared with the large body of knowledge available for linear cylindrical comb copolymer brushes. ...|$|R
5000|$|Normally, joint cartilages have {{proteoglycan}} complexes, {{which are}} proteins with <b>side</b> <b>chains</b> made of glycosaminoglycans such as keratan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate attached to strands of hyaluronic acid. The glycosaminoglycan <b>side</b> <b>chains</b> are polyanionic, which causes adjacent <b>side</b> <b>chains</b> to push each other away {{and create a}} [...] "bottle brush", where hyaluronic acid is the stem and the <b>side</b> <b>chains</b> are the bristles. When pressure is exerted on the joint, fluids move between the chondrocytes and synovial fluid, exchanging nutrients.|$|R
40|$|Five singly spin labeled <b>side</b> <b>chains</b> at surface {{sites in}} the C-terminal domain of RGL 2 protein have been {{analyzed}} to investigate the general relationship between nitroxide <b>side</b> <b>chain</b> mobility and protein structure. At these sites, the structural perturbation produced by replacement of a native residue with a nitroxide <b>side</b> <b>chain</b> appears to be very slight {{at the level of}} the backbone fold. The primary determinants of the nitroxide <b>side</b> <b>chain</b> mobility are backbone dynamics and tertiary interactions. On the exposed surfaces of alpha-helices, the <b>side</b> <b>chain</b> mobility is not restricted by tertiary interactions but appears to be determined by backbone dynamics, while in loop sites, the <b>side</b> <b>chain</b> mobility is even higher. For a better understanding of the changes in the EPR spectral line shape, molecular dynamics simulations were performed and found in agreement with EPR spectral data...|$|R
