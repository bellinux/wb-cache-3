5000|$|<b>Pointing</b> <b>trowel,</b> {{used for}} {{applying}} grout in flagstone, and other stone works.|$|E
5000|$|Tuck <b>pointing</b> <b>trowel</b> is {{long and}} thin, {{designed}} for packing mortar between bricks.|$|E
5000|$|Margin trowel: a flat-nosed trowel {{used to work}} mortar {{in tight}} spaces and corners where a larger <b>pointed</b> <b>trowel</b> will not fit.|$|R
50|$|The {{masonry trowel}} {{is used for}} the {{application}} of the mortar between and around the stones as they are set into place. Filling in the gaps (joints) with mortar is referred to as pointing. Pointing in smaller joints can be accomplished using tuck pointers, <b>pointing</b> <b>trowels,</b> and margin trowels, among other tools.|$|R
50|$|The MARSHALLTOWN Company, {{based in}} Marshalltown, Iowa, is a privately held American {{manufacturer}} of construction {{tools and equipment}} used for asphalt, concrete, drywall, EIFS, flooring, masonry, painting, plastering, stucco, tile and wallpaper. MARSHALLTOWN, founded in 1890, {{is one of the}} top producers of construction tools and equipment in the world, including the MARSHALLTOWN <b>pointed</b> <b>trowel,</b> a favored tool among American archaeologists.|$|R

5000|$|William Hunt and Sons or WHS is a British {{brand of}} masonry tools [...] {{and other types}} of edge tools. The WHS 4" [...] <b>pointing</b> <b>trowel</b> is well known as a {{standard}} excavation implement in British archaeology.|$|E
5000|$|In {{archaeology}} brick or pointing trowels (usually 4" [...] or 5" [...] steel trowels) {{are used}} to scratch the strata in an excavation and allow the colours of the soil to be clear, so that the different strata can be identified, processed and excavated. In the United States, there are several preferred brands of pointing trowels, including the Marshalltown trowel; while in the British Isles the WHS 4" [...] <b>pointing</b> <b>trowel</b> is the traditional tool.|$|E
50|$|Fossil {{retrieval}} {{starts with}} selecting an excavation site. Potential excavation sites are usually {{identified with the}} mineralogy of the location and visual detection of bones in the area. However, there are more ways to discover excavation zones using technology such as field portable x-ray fluorescence and Dense Stereo Reconstruction. Tools used include knives, brushes, and <b>pointed</b> <b>trowels</b> which assist in the removal of fossils from the earth.|$|R
50|$|The {{spaces between}} the beams in the upper gable still have their {{original}} clay netting forming the cores of the walls. On the outer side, three-sided holes were pressed into the still soft outer layer of clay with a <b>pointed</b> <b>trowel</b> in an artform called Schuppenputz. There is also a house, built in 1452, in Bad Hersfeld that also has this original work dating from the late Middle Ages.|$|R

5000|$|The WHS <b>pointing</b> <b>trowel</b> is prized amongst archaeologists in the United Kingdom {{who find}} its {{strength}} useful in digging heavy deposits. In his 1946 book Field Archaeology, Richard J. C. Atkinson (best known for excavating Stonehenge), [...] "unequivocally" [...] recommended {{the use of}} a trowel for archaeology; during the postwar era, WHS and a competing brand from Bowden were predominant. By 1960, archaeologist Paul Stamper was told that a WHS trowel was a [...] "prerequisite", and by 1999, he deemed it the [...] "industry standard". Current Archaeology summed up the choices: ...|$|E
5000|$|In 2005, {{the company}} {{introduced}} {{a new version of}} its 4" [...] WHS <b>pointing</b> <b>trowel.</b> The thinner and more brittle design was designed for the construction industry, and encountered resistance from archaeologists who found it inferior to its predecessor model. Oxford Archaeology indicated it might switch to the American-made Marshalltown trowel; and British Archaeological Jobs Resource received complaints of breakages on site. In response, in the summer of 2006, the firm launched a new trowel, marked [...] "Archaeologists' Trowel" [...] on the blade, the design of which took account of archaeologists' concerns and the results of field trials. It incorporated a thicker, stronger blade, higher lift for extra knuckle clearance, and a flattened tang to prevent handle rotation.|$|E
50|$|The {{challenge}} {{begins with}} Jeff {{being the only}} person not to read the instructions in the mortar, leading the team to lay dry bricks with no gap for mortar between. When he is informed by Andrew that wet bricks bond better to mortar, the team simply continues to lay bricks, with wet bricks over dry ones (as opposed to starting over and having all wet bricks). Furthermore, {{there is very little}} mortar applied, and the mortar is applied after the bricks are in place (as opposed to buttering the brick with mortar before setting the bricks in place). While Jeff, Ruth, and Candace continue to lay bricks, Jaime uses the <b>pointing</b> <b>trowel</b> to do tuck pointing while Terry adds in ventilation for the barbecue pit by leaving holes in the brickwork. When the nominators arrive to see the contestants' progress, the nominators (Sheilla in particular) do not like the contestants' work so far in the challenge - in particular Jeff had not used a level at all in the challenge (needed to ensure that each row of bricks are applied to a uniform height). Despite Jaime's last-ditch attempt to level the brickwork using said level (only to stop when he realizes that it is a pointless endeavour with multiple layers of brick already installed), when the challenge is over (after 82 minutes) and the nominators are asked to give a thumbs-up thumbs-down rating, the fire pit received five emphatic thumbs-downs.|$|E
50|$|Made by the Marshalltown Company of Marshalltown, Iowa, it {{was given}} iconic status by the American {{archaeologist}} Kent Flannery in his article 'The Golden Marshalltown', published in American Anthropology (1982). The Marshalltown trowel is made of {{a single piece of}} metal. The most popular sizes are the 5-inch and 6-inch <b>pointing</b> <b>trowels,</b> but archaeologists sometimes also use the trowels that have a squared end. It is larger and more flexible than the WHS trowel preferred by archaeologists in the United Kingdom which makes it better for cleaning sections but less well-suited to digging heavy clay and gravel deposits.|$|R
5000|$|The coarse stuff applied as {{the first}} coat is {{composed}} of sand and lime, usually in proportions approximating to two to one, with hair mixed into it in quantities of about a pound {{to two or three}} cubic feet of mortar. It should be mixed with clean water to such a consistency that a quantity picked up on the <b>point</b> of a <b>trowel</b> holds well together and does not drop.|$|R
