The idealized load response developed from single-lap <b>shear</b> <b>tests</b> is found to characterize the response of the composite in double-lap <b>shear</b> <b>tests,</b> although with a few key differences. With the double-lap <b>shear</b> <b>test,</b> load redistribution among the composite strips influences the post-peak response if debonding does not occur equally in both strips. Values of the ultimate (peak) stress determined using double-lap <b>shear</b> <b>tests</b> are generally consistent with, although slightly lower than, those determined by single-lap <b>shear</b> <b>tests</b> when the bonded length is longer than the effective bond length...|$|R

The shear modulus, yield shear stress, and failure shear stress of the keyhole-type specimen were compared to those of the standard specimen. Shear stress analysis was conducted using the finite element method (FEM).

40|$|Shear {{strength}} of soil {{is characterized by}} cohesion, {{angle of internal friction}} and dilatation. The first two parameters mentioned primarily define the soil's ability to resist shear stress underspecified load. These parameters can be determined by tests conducted either in the laboratory or the field for use in design of geotechnical structures. Some of the tests in the laboratory to determine the shear {{strength of}} soil, include triaxial, ring shear, torsional shear, direct shear and direct simple <b>shear.</b> Direct <b>shear</b> <b>test</b> is the most widely used geotechnical shear device due to its simplicity, however, the test suffers from stress inhomogeneity. Direct simple shear apparatus was developed because of the shortcomings in the direct <b>shear</b> <b>test.</b> In these two <b>tests,</b> different <b>shearing</b> conditions are applied to soil samples. For the direct <b>shear</b> <b>test,</b> <b>shearing</b> occurs at a predetermined center of the specimen which may not be the weakest plane of the soil while indirect simple shear, the entire specimen distorts without the formation of single shearing surface. The mode of shearing established in the direct simple shear device is similar to that which occurs around the shaft of a pile. In contrast to the extensive geotechnical application of direct <b>shear</b> <b>test,</b> limited information exists on direct simple <b>shear</b> <b>test.</b> This thesis endeavours to establish {{the relationship between the two}} tests by undertaking extensive testing to obtain a better understanding of direct simple <b>shear</b> <b>test</b> as used for testing local soils and to determine a correlation with the results from direct <b>shear</b> <b>tests.</b> A series of <b>shear</b> <b>tests</b> were undertaken on Klipheuwel sand, Kaolin clay and composite of the sand and clay using universal shear device. The soils were mixed with water in percentages of 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 %, and the composite with clay percentages of 10, 25, 50 and 75 %, to investigate the impact of water and clay on the shear parameters determined from the two tests. The results showed that direct <b>shear</b> <b>test</b> gives higher <b>shear</b> strength when compared to direct simple <b>shear</b> <b>test</b> under the same soil condition. The addition of water, and clay, generally reduced the internal friction angle of sand for both tests. Furthermore, increase in cohesion was observed with the addition of water to Kaolin clay for the direct simple <b>shear</b> <b>test</b> and the reverse was true in the direct <b>shear</b> <b>test.</b> The correlation factors developed in this study for the direct simple <b>shear</b> <b>test</b> could be used to refine the results from the direct <b>shear</b> <b>test...</b>|$|R
40|$|When {{the direct}} <b>shear</b> <b>test</b> is {{performed}} {{in accordance with}} ASTM guidelines, the measured shear stresses at failure estimate drained strength parameters.   We investigate the possibility of estimating undrained strength using direct <b>shear</b> <b>testing</b> at variable <b>shear</b> displacement rates on specimens composed of various combinations of kaolinite and bentonite. Even at fast displacement rates, constant volume conditions are not achieved in the direct shear device because of changes in specimen height that are large relative to allowable ASTM thresholds for constant volume simple <b>shear</b> <b>testing.</b> However, undrained strengths established by constant volume simple <b>shear</b> <b>testing</b> at slow strain rates are well approximated by direct <b>shear</b> <b>tests</b> conducted at fast shear displacement rates (time to failure < t 50 / 8, where t 50 =time to 50 % consolidation in a conventional oedometer test).

40|$|ABSTRACT: The field vane <b>shear</b> <b>test</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} common in situ tests to obtain the {{undrained}} shear strength of soft clay. Uncoupling of the torque generated by the soil resistance along the vertical and horizontal planes of the vane has been done by conducting conventional direct <b>shear</b> <b>test</b> and newly developed vertical direct <b>shear</b> <b>test</b> on the soil.
