5|$|As the {{efficiency}} {{is proportional to}} Fs3, small improvements in low frequency extension with the same driver and box volume will result in very significant reductions in efficiency. For these reasons, subwoofers are typically very inefficient at converting electrical energy into sound energy. This combination of factors accounts for the higher amplifier power required to drive subwoofers, and the requirement for greater power handling for subwoofer drivers. Enclosure variations (e.g., bass reflex designs with a port in the cabinet) are often used for subwoofers to increase {{the efficiency}} of the driver/enclosure system, helping to reduce the amplifier <b>power</b> <b>requirements.</b>|$|E
5|$|When {{radially}} broaching workpieces {{that require}} a deep cut per tooth, such as forgings or castings, a rotor-cut or jump-cut design can be used; these broaches are also known as free egress or nibbling broaches. In this design the RPT is designated {{to two or three}} rows of teeth. For the broach to work the first tooth of that cluster has a wide notch, or undercut, and then the next tooth has a smaller notch (in a three tooth design) and the final tooth has no notch. This allows for a deep cut while keeping stresses, forces, and <b>power</b> <b>requirements</b> low.|$|E

25|$|While this nozzle {{system has}} major {{drawbacks}} particularly in its <b>power</b> <b>requirements,</b> {{the possibility of}} cavitation {{in the operation of}} marine propellers is reduced considerably.

25|$|An {{approach}} {{for reducing the}} exhaust compressor parasitic power loss is as follows. After most of the steam has been condensed by spout condensers, the non-condensible gas steam mixture is passed through a counter current region which increases the gas-steam reaction {{by a factor of}} five. The result is an 80% reduction in the exhaust pumping <b>power</b> <b>requirements.</b>|$|E

25|$|Such ELF {{transmitters}} {{cannot be}} installed on submarines, {{because of the}} size of the antenna and high <b>power</b> <b>requirements.</b> So ELF communication is one-way, with a receiver in the submarine receiving orders from a shore station, but unable to reply.

They retained the 14.5 by 15 in bore and stroke of these previous engines and produced 1200 shaft horsepower at 380 revolutions per minute. These engines eventually went into the J, L-class and M-class submarines.|$|R

25|$|Experimental wind {{turbines}} were commissioned in 1978; however, high maintenance requirements and excessive power generation resulted in Diesel remaining the main power source. In 2004 a new 600kW wind-Diesel system was erected; other {{works at the}} time included upgrades to the power station and the installation of low load Diesel generators. The wind turbine delivers approximately 37% of Rottnest's <b>power</b> <b>requirements</b> and saves over 400,000 litres of Diesel fuel per year.|$|E
25|$|This, {{along with}} other rules {{pertaining}} to grade crossing signaling that the wigwag was unable to meet due to its <b>power</b> <b>requirements,</b> rendered it obsolete for new installations in 1949, but grandfathering laws allowed them to remain until upgrades to the crossings they protected were necessary. Magnetic Signal was sold to the Griswold Signal Company of Minneapolis shortly after WWII. Production of new signals continued until 1949, and replacement parts until 1960.|$|E
40|$|The pumping {{mechanism}} of the heart is pulsatile, so the heart generates pulsatile flow that enters into the compliant aorta {{in the form of}} pressure and flow waves. We hypothesized that there exists a specific heart rate at which the external left ventricular (LV) power is minimized. To test this hypothesis, we used a computational model to explore the effects of heart rate (HR) and aortic rigidity on left ventricular (LV) <b>power</b> <b>requirement.</b> While both mean and pulsatile parts of the pressure {{play an important role in}} LV <b>power</b> <b>requirement</b> elevation, at higher rigidities the effect of pulsatility becomes more dominant. For any given aortic rigidity, there exists an optimum HR that minimizes the LV <b>power</b> <b>requirement</b> at a given cardiac output. The optimum HR shifts to higher values as the aorta becomes more rigid. To conclude, there is an optimum condition for aortic waves that minimizes the LV pulsatile load and consequently the total LV workload...|$|R

25|$|The fastest {{enterprise}} HDDs spin at 10,000 or 15,000rpm, and {{can achieve}} sequential media transfer speeds above 1.6Gbit/s and a sustained transfer rate up to 1Gbit/s. Drives running at 10,000 or 15,000rpm use smaller platters to mitigate increased <b>power</b> <b>requirements</b> (as {{they have less}} air drag) and therefore generally have lower capacity than the highest capacity desktop drives. Enterprise HDDs are commonly connected through Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) or Fibre Channel (FC). Some support multiple ports, {{so they can be}} connected to a redundant host bus adapter.|$|E
