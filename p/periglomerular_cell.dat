5000|$|The {{olfactory}} bulb is, along {{with both the}} subventricular zone and the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, {{one of only three}} structures in the brain observed to undergo continuing neurogenesis in adult mammals. In most mammals, new neurons are born from neural stem cells in the sub-ventricular zone and migrate rostrally towards the main [...] and accessory [...] {{olfactory bulb}}s. Within the olfactory bulb these immature neuroblasts develop into fully functional granule cell interneurons and <b>periglomerular</b> <b>cell</b> interneurons that reside in the granule cell layer and glomerular layers, respectively. The olfactory sensory neuron axons that form synapses in olfactory bulb glomeruli are also capable of regeneration following regrowth of an olfactory sensory neuron residing in the olfactory epithelium. Despite dynamic turnover of sensory axons and interneurons, the projection neurons (mitral and tufted neurons) that form synapses with these axons are not structurally plastic.|$|E
50|$|Mitral {{cells are}} {{a key part of}} the {{olfactory}} bulb microcircuit. Mitral cells receive input from at least four cell types: olfactory sensory neurons, periglomerular neurons, external tufted cells and granule cells. The synapses made by external tufted cells and olfactory sensory neurons are excitatory, whereas those of granule cells and periglomerular neurons are inhibitory. In addition, sister mitral cells are reciprocally connected by gap junctions. The mitral to granule and mitral to <b>periglomerular</b> <b>cell</b> synapse was the first description of the rather atypical reciprocal dendrodenritic synapses (in contrast to the more common axodendritic synapse). The action of the full glomerular microcircuit is a topic that is under intense scientific investigation. Certain principles are starting to emerge. One discovery points to the idea of the microcircuit between mitral, tufted and periglomerular cells in separating the output of mitral and tufted cells in time. It appears that tufted cells receive strong olfactory nerve input, fire close to inhalation onset and their firing phase is relatively concentration insensitive, whereas mitral cells receive relatively weak olfactory nerve input and strong periglomerular inhibition, which delays their firing relative to the tufted cells. This escape from inhibition can be sped up by increasing the stimulating odorant concentration, and thus mitral cell firing phase acts as one possible way the olfactory system encodes concentration. The role of the mitral cell lateral dendrite and granule cell circuit is currently a bit more uncertain. One possible hypothesis implicates the system in forming sparse representation which enable more effective pattern separation. The action of this circuit is heavily influenced by both short term and long term plasticity and ongoing granule cell neurogenesis. The circuit requires the animal to be awake if it is to have full functionality.|$|E
40|$|Interneurons in the {{olfactory}} bulb are {{key elements of}} odor processing but their roles have not yet being fully understood. Two types of inhibitory interneurons, periglomerular and granule cells, act at two different levels within the {{olfactory bulb}} and may have different roles in coordinating the spiking of mitral cells, which are the principal output neurons of the olfactory bulb. In this work we introduce a reduced compartmental model of the <b>periglomerular</b> <b>cell</b> {{and use it to}} investigate its role on mitral cell spiking in a model of an elementary cell triad composed of these two cell types plus a granule cell. Our simulation results show that the <b>periglomerular</b> <b>cell</b> is more effective in inhibiting the mitral cell than the granule cell. Based on our results we predict that periglomerular and granule cells have different roles in the control of mitral cell spiking. The <b>periglomerular</b> <b>cell</b> would be the only one capable of completely inhibiting the mitral cell, and the activity decrease of the mitral cell through this inhibitory action would occur in a stepwise fashion depending on parameters of the periglomerular and granule cells {{as well as on the}} relative times of arrival of external stimuli to the three cells. The major role of the granule cell would be to facilitate the inhibitory action of the <b>periglomerular</b> <b>cell</b> by enlarging the range of parameters of the <b>periglomerular</b> <b>cell</b> which correspond to complete inhibition of the mitral cell. The combined action of the two interneurons would thus provide an efficient way of controling the instantaneous value of the firing rate of the mitral cell...|$|E

After acute dissociation, living dopaminergic <b>periglomerular</b> <b>cells</b> were identified by a fluorescently labeled monoclonal antibody to PLAP.

40|$|The first synapse in {{olfaction}} undergoes considerable anatomical plasticity in both early {{postnatal development}} and adult neurogenesis, yet {{we know very}} little concerning its functionalmaturation at these times. Here, we usedwhole-cell recordings in olfactory bulb slices to describe olfactory nerve inputs to developing postnatal neurons and tomaturing adult-born cells labeledwith aGFP-encoding lentivirus. In both postnatal development and adult neurogenesis, the maturation of olfactory nerve synapses involved {{an increase in the}} relative contribution of AMPAoverNMDA receptors, and a decrease in the contribution of NMDA receptors containing theNR 2 B subunit. These postsynaptic transformations, however, were notmirrored by presynaptic changes: in all cell groups, paired-pulse depression remained constant as olfactory nerve synapses matured. Although maturing cells may therefore offer, transiently, a functionally distinct connec-tion for inputs from the nose, presynaptic function at the first olfactory connection remains remarkably constant in the face of consid-erable anatomical plasticity.

40|$|The {{olfactory}} bulb (OB) {{is a highly}} plastic region of the adult mammalian brain characterized by continuous integration of inhibitory interneurons of the granule (GC) and <b>periglomerular</b> <b>cell</b> (PGC) types. Adult-generated OB interneurons are selected to survive in an experience-dependent way but the mechanisms that mediate the effects of experience on OB neurogenesis are unknown.

Using paradigms of olfactory enrichment and/or deprivation combined to BrdU injections and quantitative confocal immunohistochemical analyses, we studied the effects of olfactory experience on adult-generated PGCs at different survival time and compared PGC to GC modulation. We show that olfactory enrichment similarly influences PGCs and GCs, increasing survival of newborn cells and transiently modulating GAD 67 and plasticity-related molecules expression. However, PGC maturation appears to be delayed compared to GCs, reflecting a different temporal dynamic of adult generated olfactory interneuron integration. Moreover, olfactory enrichment or deprivation do not selectively modulate the survival of specific PGC phenotypes, supporting the idea that the integration rate of distinct PGC subtypes is independen...|$|E
40|$|Considerable {{evidence}} exists for an extrinsic cholinergic {{influence in the}} maturation and function of the main olfactory bulb. In this study, we addressed the muscarinic modulation of dopaminergic neurons in this structure. We used different patch-clamp techniques to characterize the diverse roles of muscarinic agonists on identified dopaminergic neurons in a transgenic animal model expressing a reporter protein (green fluorescent protein) under the tyrosine hydroxylase promoter. Bath application of acetylcholine (1 mM) in slices and in enzymatically dissociated cells reduced the spontaneous firing of dopaminergic neurons recorded in cell-attached mode. In whole-cell configuration no effect of the agonist was observed, unless using the perforated patch technique, thus suggesting the involvement of a diffusible second messenger. The effect was mediated by metabotropic receptors as it was blocked by atropine and mimicked by the m 2 agonist oxotremorine (10 µM). The reduction of <b>periglomerular</b> <b>cell</b> firing by muscarinic activation results from a membrane-potential hyperpolarization caused by activation of a potassium conductance. This modulation of dopaminergic interneurons may be important in the processing of sensory information and may be relevant to understand the mechanisms underlying the olfactory dysfunctions occurring in neurodegenerative diseases affecting the dopaminergic and/or cholinergic systems...|$|E

40|$|<b>Periglomerular</b> <b>cells</b> {{represent}} an important class of interneurons of the olfactory bulb, {{contributing to the}} processing of olfactory information coming from the olfactory epithelium. Despite their involvement in the glomerular circuitry, {{a larger number of}} data is required to clarify their function. To further complicate matters, several types of <b>periglomerular</b> <b>cells</b> are described in literature. The main goal of my thesis is to provide new information about two types of periglomerular cells: dopaminergic and calretinin-positive neurons. They belong to different classes of <b>periglomerular</b> <b>cells,</b> suggesting distinct roles in modulating olfactory stimuli. Using patch clamp technique, in both whole cell and perforated patch configuration, properties of these periglomerular neurons have been illustrated. Electrophysiological experiments have been performed in two transgenic mouse strains, each one specific for a distinct periglomerular class. The first part of my thesis is focused on the investigation of the properties of h-current in the dopaminergic periglomerular neurons. Most of the experiments have been carried out in perforated patch, in order to minimize the disturbance of the intracellular fluid. Biophysical properties of h-current have been described, calculating the values of the main kinetic parameters. In addition, the influence of both thermic conditions and intracellular levels of cAMP on this conductance has been analyzed. The blockage of h-current suppresses the spontaneous firing of these neurons through its effect on the resting membrane potential. Finally, only noradrenaline have been observed to act on Ih, decreasing its amplitude. The second part of the thesis regards the calretinin-positive <b>periglomerular</b> <b>cells.</b> In whole cell configuration and under voltage clamp conditions, activation protocols have been applied to the cell membrane, in order to elicit a complete set of depolarization-evoked currents. The three main conductances (a fast transient sodium current, an A-type potassium current, and an L-type calcium current) have been further isolated and analyzed, determining their voltage dependence and kinetic properties. As a whole, all the data collected contribute {{to a better understanding of}} the functional role of the <b>periglomerular</b> <b>cells</b> in the glomerular network. The characterization of h-current in the dopaminergic cells enlarges the previous body of knowledge regarding this class of interneurons.

40|$|In adult rodents, neurons are {{continually}} {{generated in the}} subventricular zone of the forebrain, from where they migrate tangentially toward the olfactory bulb, the only known target for these neuronal precursors. Within the main olfactory bulb, they ascend radially into the granule and <b>periglomerular</b> <b>cell</b> layers, where they differentiate mainly into local interneurons. The functional consequences of this permanent generation and integration of new neurons into existing circuits are unknown. To address this question, we used neural cell adhesion molecule-deficient mice that have documented deficits in the migration of olfactory-bulb neuron precursors, leading to about 40 % size reduction of this structure. Our anatomical study reveals that this reduction is restricted to the granule cell layer, a structure that contains exclusively gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) ergic interneurons. Furthermore, mutant mice were subjected to experiments designed to examine the behavioral consequences of such anatomical alteration. We found that the specific reduction in the newly generated interneuron population resulted in an impairment of discrimination between odors. In contrast, both the detection thresholds for odors and short-term olfactory memory were unaltered, demonstrating that a critical number of bulbar granule cells is crucial only for odor discrimination but not for general olfactory functions...|$|E
40|$|The {{neurotrophin}} brain-derived {{neurotrophic factor}} (BDNF) has been implicated in the generation and differentiation of new olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) and in the regulation of branching of OSN axons in their target glomeruli. However, previous reports of BDNF mRNA and protein expression in olfactory epithelium and olfactory bulb (OB) have been inconsistent, raising questions on the proposed roles for BDNF. Here, we report on b-galactosidase (b-gal) expression in adult gene-targeted mice where the BDNF promoter drives expression of the Escherichia coli lacZ gene (BDNF lacZneo mice). We find that b-gal is expressed in a small subset of OSNs with axons that reach the olfactory nerve layers throughout the OB. In the OB, we find expression of b-gal in c-aminobutyric acidergic but not dopaminergic periglomerular cells and external tufted cells and in interneurons located in the mitral cell layer. Our results are inconsistent with the regulation of generation and differentiation of new OSNs elicited by the release of BDNF from horizontal basal cells.

40|$|Adult {{neurogenesis}} occurs {{most notably}} in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the hippocampal dentate gyrus and in the olfactory bulb (OB) where new neurons are generated from neural progenitors cells produced in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the forebrain. As {{it is well known}} that gonadal steroid hormones, primarily estradiol, modulate neurogenesis in the hippocampus of adult female rodents, we wanted to determine whether estradiol would also affect the proliferation of progenitor cells in the SVZ and by consequence the rate of newly generated cells in the main OB. Thus a first group of adult female C 57 B 16 /J mice was ovariectomized and received a short term treatment with estradiol (single injection of 1 or 10 mu g 17 beta-estradiol or Silastic capsule of estradiol during 2 days) before receiving a single injection with BrdU to determine whether estradiol would modulate the cell proliferation in the SVZ. A second group of adult ovariectomized female mice was submitted to the same estradiol treatment before receiving four BrdU injections, and was sacrificed 21 days later to determine whether a modulation in cell proliferation actually leads to a modulation in the number of newborn cells in the main OB. We observed a decrease in cell proliferation in the SVZ following either dose of estradiol compared to the controls. Furthermore, 21 days after their generation in the SVZ, the number of BrdU labeled cells was also lower in the main OB, both in the granular and <b>periglomerular</b> <b>cell</b> layers of estradiol-treated animals. These results show that a short term treatment with estradiol actually downregulates cell proliferation leading to a decreased number of newborn cells in the OB. (C) 2010 IBRO.

40|$|The {{olfactory}} glomeruli represent morphological {{and functional}} units in which olfactory information is processed in specialized synaptic arrangements established between the central processes of sensory neurons, whose cell bodies {{are located in}} the olfactory epithelium, and the terminal (intraglomerular) portions of the dendrites of periglomerular, tufted, and mitral cells. The olfactory glomeruli are surrounded by distinctive glial formations in which the peripheral glia interacts with the central glia. We have studied the morphology and organization of neuroglial cells in the layer of olfactory nerves and the glomerular layer of the olfactory bulb in the insectivorous hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus) with the electron microscope, Golgi method, and immunohistochemistry by using antibodies to glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and 'rip,' a monoclonal antibody that stains oligodendrocytes and their processes in the rat (Friedman et al. : Glia 2 : 380 - 390, ' 89). The peripheral glia is represented by a special category of cells that are closely related to astrocytes and known as sheathing cells. They accompany olfactory axons to their entrance in the glomeruli where they interact with the central glia, represented by astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. The sheathing cells typically display indented nuclei and protoplasmic expansions forming laminar processes wrapping several axons together. Astrocytes surrounding the glomerular neuropil belong to the velate type. They display numerous sheet-like processes enveloping dendritic segments and <b>periglomerular</b> <b>cell</b> bodies. Oligodendrocytes were found surrounding the glomeruli and at the interstices separating different glomeruli. Myelinated dendritic segments and cell bodies were found surrounding the olfactory glomeruli. These myelin coverings probably derive from oligodendrocytes.

40|$|A {{study of}} the {{olfactory}} bulb in certain mammals by light and electron microscopy of normal and experimental material. The neurons of the glomerular layer of the rat olfactory bulb have been studied using Nissl staining and Golgi-Kopsch impregnation in light microscopy to define the size, shape, and morphological features of individual cell somata, dendrites and axons; these have been correlated with electron microscopic material in which fine structural characteristics were also noted for each cell type, particularly synaptic specialisations. Three neuron types are described: the external tufted and periglomerular cells of classical microscopy, and additional, superficial short-axon cells; {{a description of the}} glomerular arborisations of the mitral and deep tufted cells is also included. The tufted and mitral cells snow large, non-spiny glomerular dendritic arborisations, having terminal varicosities, the external tufted cells being more limited in their branching than the deeper cells. External tufted cells have large somata and abundant cytoplasm containing stacks of Nissl material; their main dendrites are characterised by pale cytoplasm and a regular array of neurotubules. Reciprocal dendro-dendritic and somato-dendritic synapses are commonly found, the tufted/mitral cells containing spherical vesicles and contacting by means of asymmetrical membrane thickenings; the other profile involved is a gemmule containing large flattened vesicles and associated with a symmetrical thickening. The periglomerular cells are smaller, with a spiny glomerular arborisation, as well as some other dendrites; all the dendrites of these cells tend to be of irregular outline. They hare a dark nucleus and very little somatic cytoplasm; somatic and dendritic appendages are common and often contain large flattened vesicles. Synapses orientated from the dendritic shaft or gemmule also show such resides, invariably associated with symmetrical thickenings. The superficial short-axon cells are characterised by the entirely periglomerular distribution of their dendrites, which are varicose and rarely branch. Of intermediate soma dimensions, but containing dispersed Nissl material, these cells and their stem dendrites show no synaptic specialisations directed from them. Features of axon initial segments, axo-somatic and axo-dendritic synapses are also described for each call, as well as some unusual glial relationships. Reasons are adduced for relating the superficial short-axon cell to the axon terminal type containing small flattened resides, as well as for considering that the external tufted and periglomerular cells show the same synaptic specialisations at their axon terminals as at their dendritic and somatic synapses. The neuropil of the glomerular layer (consisting of glomeruli and periglomerular regions) of the rat olfactory bulb was studied with the electron microscope with a view to elucidating the type of processes involved andndash; dendrites, appendages and axons andndash; their cellular identity, and the synaptic relationships they establish. The problems encountered in defining these are considered and criteria based on neuron types and from examination of serial sections are put forward. The glomeruli are large structures containing many thousands of processes and are the sole site of termination of the olfactory receptor axons. The terminals of the latter are characteristically electron-dense, allowing identification in normal material; they run through the glomeruli making many synapses by means of spherical vesicles and asymmetrical thickenings on to all types of dendritic profile. The glomerular dendritic arborisations of mitral and tufted cells, which are indistinguishable from each other, start as large, fairly regular, pale profiles but become increasingly varicose as they branch and diminish in size. They regularly show groups of spherical vesicles, often in association with asymmetrical synaptic thickenings directed from the dendrite; these are typically associated with return reciprocal synapses of the symmetrical type from profiles containing large flattened vesicles. These latter profiles are those of the dendrites and gemmules of periglomerular cells; the dendrites are of irregular outline and give rise to many appendages, mostly gemmules making synaptic contact with mitral or tufted cell dendrites. A small number of pale axon terminals containing either small or large flattened vesicles, derived from short-axon and periglomerular cells respectively, synapse with symmetrical thickenings on to the <b>periglomerular</b> <b>cell</b> dendritic processes. Close associations of particular types of axo-dendritic and dendro-dendritic synapses on interconnecting processes, termed synaptic patterns, are described and their significance considered. The nature of the glomerular interactions is discussed and then placed in the context of other, smaller glomeruli in the central nervous system; certain common principles of glomeruli are suggested. The periglomerular region of the olfactory bulb, apart from containing the somata and item dendrites of the cells contributing to the glomeruli, is the sole region of distribution of the <b>periglomerular</b> <b>cell</b> thin dendrites and the short-axon cell dendrites. It is also the major site of termination of all axons to the glomerular layer except the olfactory axons andndash; i. e. tufted cell collaterals, <b>periglomerular</b> <b>cell</b> and short-axon cell axons and centrifugal fibres. Its characteristic neuropil has been studied with the electron microscope to define the cells of origin of the types of neuronal process and their synaptic relationships. Three types of axon terminals have been found: those with spherical, large flattened and small flattened vesicles, which are deduced to derive from tufted cell collaterals or centrifugal fibres, <b>periglomerular</b> <b>cell</b> and short axon-cell axons respectively; those with spherical vesicles are consistently associated with asymmetrical membrane thickenings and those with either type of flattened vesicles with symmetrical thickenings. The thin <b>periglomerular</b> <b>cell</b> dendrites are very irregular and often have a somewhat dense cytoplasm rich in ribosomes; they may become extended into very attenuated glia-like sheets that surround the mitral or tufted cell stem dendrites, from which they may receive synaptic contacts. Such dendrites also receive some synapses from all three types of axon in the periglomerular region. The short-axon cell dendrites are thick and varicose and show no sign of synaptic specialisation orientated from them; they have few spines but receive many asymmetrical type synapses on their shafts. Both axon terminal types synapsing with symmetrical thickenings are also found on the shafts. The evidence obtained from the study of normal material is summarised and the various cellular roles considered. In the light of observations on the olfactory bulb, it is suggested that dendrites may be divided into two major classes: those that only receive synapses (Class A) and those that make synaptic contacts as well as receiving them (Class B), After a summary of the findings from normal material and a brief description of an unusual feature of the olfactory bulb in the monkey, a group of experimental studies on this site in the rat and rabbit are described. The degeneration of axon terminals in the glomerular layer of the rat olfactory bulb has been studied, concentrating particularly on the sequence of degeneration in the olfactory nerve terminals and the long-term events in the degeneration process in several terminal types. Olfactory nerve terminal degeneration is divided into five stages, representing parts of the sequential changes taking place in the terminal after fibre section. The main features in the sequence are as follows: I. Swelling of the terminal and its vesicles. II. Initial shrinkage of the terminal, while vesicles remain swollen and some are distorted. III. Further shrinkage and darkening of the terminal, distortion of many of the vesicles and some mitochondrial swelling. IV. Extreme shrinkage of the terminal and loss of cytoplasmic detail; synaptic contact still intact or partially separated. V. Disappearance of the presynaptic terminal and persistence of the post-synaptic thickening. The validity of the observation of the persistence of post-synaptic membrane thickenings is considered and evidence adduced in its favour, both qualitative and quantitative. Characteristics of the newly apposed profiles are described, including cisternae and alveolate vesicles; the extra-cellular material of the synaptic cleft is considered in the light of its association with persisting thickenings. The relevance of these associated structures is discussed in terms of function and development. Spontaneous degeneration of olfactory nerves and the degeneration of the vomeronasal nerves in the accessory olfactory bulb are described, as well as Stage V in the degeneration of other terminal types in the glomeruli, following various lesions; persistence of post-synaptic thickenings after the degeneration of terminals showing symmetrical membrane thickenings is included. Observations on the persistence of post-synaptic thickenings in various sites in the central and peripheral nervous systems are reviewed {{in the context of the}} present study; the problems arising out of the morphological identification of apposition or reinnervation are discussed. A {{study of the}} transneuronal degenerative changes in the cells of the olfactory bulb of the rabbit and rat following removal of the olfactory mucosa has also been made. The principal features of this type of change are cell shrinkage, a concentration of cytoplasmic and nuclear constituents, an alteration in the organisation of nucleic acid material, and a swelling of membrane-bound systems; some elements of cellular organisation appear unchanged, including synaptic specialisations. The changes are described for each part of the neuron andndash; soma, dendrite, axon and terminal andndash; as well as the variants found in different cells. The degree of morphological alteration appears to be related to the extent of denervation for any individual cell and does not seem to be sentential. These changes are related to findings on altered impregnation properties of the sane cells with the Golgi technique and are discussed in the context of the functional alteration produced by deafferentation. A new interpretation of some 'dark neurons' is also suggested on the basis of those findings. The termination of the centrifugal fibres running in the lateral olfactory tract to the glomerular layer of the rat olfactory bulb has been determined with the electron microscope; this has been done with material perfused at various times after section of the lateral olfactory tract, as well as after a combination of this lesion with the long-term degeneration of olfactory nerves. The axon terminals are sparse at the glomerular level, but undergo typical degenerative changes; they are distributed solely in the periglomerular region and intermediate zone. The most common post-synaptic profiles are the processes of periglomerular cellS, but a few centrifugal fibres terminate on short-axon, tufted and mitral cell dendrites. Evidence is produced to suggest that the anterior olfactory nucleus does net project as far as the glomerular layer. The findings are discussed in relation to previous studies with normal material and silver degeneration methods on similar experimental material; the functional implications of the Centrifugal pathways in the bulb are briefly discussed. Lesions have been made in the superficial layers of the dorsal surface of the rat olfactory bulb; the resulting axonal degeneration haft been studied with light and electron microscopy, in order to determine the mode and extent of interconnection of the intrinsic interneurons of the glomerular layer. Although the lesions necessarily involve extrinsic pathways, the axonal distribution of each of the intrinsic neurons may be deduced from this evidence and a knowledge of normal and experimental material. Tufted cell collaterals extend for 6 andndash; 12 glomeruli, <b>periglomerular</b> <b>cell</b> axons for 4 andndash; 5 glomeruli and superficial short-axon cell axons for 2 andndash; 3 glomeruli; these figures correspond well with observations of Golgi-impregnated material. The experimental approach to the study of intrinsic connections and its applicability to other sites is considered, and the results are discussed from the point of view of neural coding and odour specificity. In the last chapter concerned with results from this study, mention is made of the technique of combining Golgi-impregnation for light microscopy and electron microscopy of the same cell; its practical application is considered and examples are given from the study of a middle tufted cell by this technique. Finally, the general discussion brings together the results on the organisation of the olfactory bulb, particularly the glomerular layer. The discussion centres around two principal issues arising from these studies: the structure and function of individual neurons and their specialisations on the one hand, and the principles of neuronal organisation on the other; where possible, these are related to findings and function in other parts of the central nervous system, as well as to the function of the olfactory bulb in the olfactory pathway. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{capacity}} of <b>periglomerular</b> <b>cells</b> (PGc) to give fast, Na-dependent action potentials {{is a crucial}} and debated issue for the comprehension of how sensory information is processed in the olfactory bulb (OB). Using patchclamp whole cell recording in thin slices of rat OB (P 8 -P 20) we showed that fast sodium conductance is present in all the PGc studied, that this current is sufficiently large to generate action potentials and that action potentials can be evoked in these cells by direct stimulation of the olfactory nerve. A comprehensive kinetic characterization of INa is also presented...|$|R

They receive input from the receptor cells of the olfactory epithelium found {{in areas of the}} nose able to sense smell.Both tufted cells and mitral cells are called projection neurons. Projection neurons send the signals from the glomeruli deeper into the brain. The actual signal sent through these projection cells has been sharpened or filtered by a process called lateral inhibition. Both the <b>periglomerular</b> <b>cells</b> and the granule cells contribute to lateral inhibition. Projection neurons therefore transmit a sharpened olfactory signal to the deeper parts of the brain.|$|R
40|$|Postdevelopmental {{neurogenesis}} {{occurs in}} the olfactory bulb (OB), towhichnew interneurons are continuously recruited. However, only {{a subset of the}} adult-generated interneurons survives, as many undergo programmed cell death. As part of homeostatic processes, the removal of new neurons is required alongside the addition of new ones, to ensure a stable neuron number. In addition to a critical role in tissuemaintenance, it is still unclearwhether this neuronal elimination affects the functioning of adult circuits. Using focal drug delivery restricted to the OB, we investigated the significance of programmed cell death in the adult OB circuits. Cell deathwas effectively blocked by the broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp(OMe) -fluoromethylketone (zVAD). The zVAD effect differed with newborn interneuron location, either in the superficial (<b>periglomerular</b> <b>cells)</b> or in the deep (granule cells) OB layers. Furthermore, whereas sensory experience potentiated the effect of zVAD on the survival of new granule cells, it had no additional effect on the survival of new <b>periglomerular</b> <b>cells.</b> Thus, distinct mechanisms control the survival/elimination decision of newborn interneuron subtypes. However, zVADhadno effect on the olfactory sensory neurons projecting to the bulb. Remarkably, psychophysical analyzes revealed that a normal rate of new neuron elimination was essential for optimal odorant exploration and discrimination. This study highlights the importance of cell elimination for adjusting olfactory performance. We conclude that adult-generated OB interneurons are continually turned over, rather than simply added, and the precise balance between new and mature interneurons, set through active selection/ elimination processes, is essential for optimizing olfaction...|$|R

O presente trabalho {{consiste}} em construir um modelo biologicamente plausível da célula PG e investigar os efeitos dessa célula em conjunto com modelos da célula mitral e da célula granular. Esses modelos são acoplados através de conexões sinápticas inspiradas nas conexões existentes no bulbo olfatório, formando uma pequena rede simplificada. A rede é usada para analisar o efeito da inibição inicial da célula mitral por parte da célula PG e os mecanismos que podem influenciar o padrão de atividade da célula mitral. Através deste estudo, verifica-se que a célula PG pode influenciar na frequência, no tempo de disparo e gerar atrasos na propagação do potencial da célula mitral, agindo como um mecanismo de controle nas camadas iniciais do processamento de odores do bulbo olfatório.

Single cell models of these three cell types coupled by synaptic connections inspired on existing connections in the olfactory bulb, constituting a small and simple network. This network is used to investigate the effect of early lateral inhibition of the mitral cell by PG cell and the mechanisms witch can influence the output activity pattern of mitral cell. The study shows that the PG cell may influence the spike frequency and the spike timing of the mitral cell, as well as provoke delays in the propagation of action potential along this cell. Therefore, the PG cell may act as a control mechanism in the early odor processing stages in the olfactory bulb...|$|E
40|$|The {{neuropil}} of the glomeruli {{of the rat}} {{olfactory bulb}} has been studied with the electron microscope {{with a view to}} elucidating the type of processes involved- dendrites, appendages and axons- their cellular identity, and the synaptic relationships they establish. The problems encountered in defining these are considered and criteria based on the previous study of neuron types and on examination of serial sections are put forward. The glomeruli are large structures containing many thousands of processes and are the sole site of termination of the olfactory receptor axons. The terminals of the latter are characteristically electron-dense, allowing identification in normal material; they run through the glomeruli making many synapses by means of spherical vesicles and asymmetrical thickenings on to all types of dendritic profile. The glomerular dendritic arborizations of mitral and tufted cells, which are indistinguishable from each other, start as large, fairly regular, pale profiles but become increasingly varicose as they branch and diminish in size. They regularly show groups of spherical vesicles, often in association with asymmetrical synaptic thickenings directed from the dendrite; these are typically associated with return, reciprocal, synapses of the symmetrical type from profiles containing large flattened vesicles. These latter profiles are those of the dendrites and gemmules of periglomerular cells; the dendrites are of irregular outline and give rise to many appendages, mostly gemmules making synaptic contact with mitral or tufted cell dendrites. A small number of pale axon terminals containing either small or large flattened vesicles, derived from shortaxon and periglomerular cells respectively, synapse with symmetrical thickenings on to the <b>periglomerular</b> <b>cell</b> dendritic processes. Close associations of particular types of axo-dendritic and dendro-dendritic synapses on interconnecting processes, termed synaptic patterns, are described and their significance considered. The nature of the glomerular interactions is discussed and then placed in the context of other, smaller glomeruli in the central nervous system; certain common principles of glomeruli are suggested...|$|E
40|$|Neurale Stammzellen sind im adulten Säugerhirn in der Subventrikulären Zone (SVZ) der Lateralventrikel und dem Hippokampus lokalisiert. In der SVZ entstandene neurale Zellen migrieren entlang eines von Astrozyten umgebenen Pfades, dem Rostralmigratorischen Strom (RMS), zum Olfaktorischen Bulbus (OB), wo sie zu olfaktorischen Interneuronen differenzieren. Vaskuläre Wachstumsfaktoren, wie VEGF-A beeinflussen die adulte Neurogenese. Die vorliegende Arbeit beschreibt erstmalig detailliert die spezifische Expression des VEGF-Rezeptor- 1 (VEGFR- 1) in den Regionen olfaktorischer und hippokampaler Neurogenese des adulten ZNS. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass VEGFR- 1 im adulten Hirn hauptsächlich in GFAP-positiven Zellen in der SVZ, dem RMS, dem OB, dem Corpus callosum und dem Hippokampus exprimiert ist. In vivo-Analysen transgener Mäuse (Flt- 1 TK-/-), denen die Signaltransduktionsdomäne des VEGFR- 1 fehlt, demonstrieren hier erstmals eine Rolle des VEGFR- 1 in adulter Neurogenese. Flt- 1 TK-/- weisen eine erhöhte Proliferation neuronaler Vorläuferzellen der SVZ auf. Im RMS ist jedoch 6 Tage nach BrdU-Administration die Anzahl markierter Zellen im Vergleich zum Wildtyp (wt) um 47, 97 % reduziert, ohne dass es zu einer Akkumulation in der SVZ kommt. Zusammen mit der in Kulturversuchen stark erhöhten Migrationsgeschwindigkeit von Neuroblasten der Flt- 1 TK-/- und einer verminderten Abwanderung von Zellen aus dem RMS ins Corpus callosum der Flt- 1 Tk-/-, weist dies auf eine gesteigerte Migration zum OB hin. Tatsächlich war der OB der Flt- 1 TK-/-, vor allem die Plexiform- und Periglomerulärzellschicht (PGL), signifikant vergrößert. Im OB der transgenen Tiere migrieren zudem signifikant mehr BrdU-markierte Zellen in die PGL. Dort differenzieren signifikant mehr Neurone als im wt. Subtypisierungen zeigen, zudem eine erhöhte Differenzierung in dopaminerge Interneurone in der PGL der Flt- 1 TK-/-. Im Gehirn Flt- 1 TK-/- war die Konzentration von VEGF-A erhöht. Intrazerebroventrikuläre Infusion von VEGF-A in wt-Tiere erbrachte den eindeutigen Nachweis, dass die Erhöhung der VEGF-A-Konzentration im Gehirn der Flt- 1 TK-/- ursächlich für die in diesen Tieren beobachtete Reduktion der BrdU-positiven Zellen im RMS ist. Dies ist gleichzeitig der erste Nachweis einer Wirkung von VEGF-A auf Neuroblasten im RMS in vivo unter physiologischen Bedingungen. Die erhöhte VEGF-A-Konzentration könnte auch den anderen hier dargelegten Effekten zugrunde liegen. VEGFR- 1 ist somit ein regulatorischer Faktor für die adulte olfaktorische Neurogenese und spielt eine potentielle Rolle in der Differenzierung dopaminerger Interneurone. Neural {{stem cells}} in the adult {{mammalian}} brain mainly reside in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricles and in the hippocampus. SVZ-derived neural cells migrate through a glial tunnel of the rostral migratory stream (RMS) towards the olfactory bulb (OB), where they differentiate into olfactory interneurons. Vascular growth factors like VEGF-A {{have been shown to}} influence adult neurogenesis. This thesis describes {{for the first time a}} detailed expression pattern of VEGF receptor- 1 (VEGFR- 1) in regions of olfactory and hippocampal neurogenesis of the adult CNS. In the adult brain VEGFR- 1 is predominantly expressed by GFAP-positive cells of the SVZ, the RMS, the OB, the Corpus callosum (CC) and the hippocampus. In vivo-analysis of transgenic mice (Flt- 1 TK-/-), lacking the signal transduction domain of VEGFR- 1, revealed a role for VEGFR- 1 in adult neurogenesis. Flt- 1 TK-/- show enhanced proliferation of neuronal progenitor {{cells in the}} SVZ. In the RMS Flt- 1 TK-/- display a vast decrease (47, 97 %) of neuronal progenitor cells in Flt- 1 Tk-/- 6 days after BrdU application compared to control mice. However, no accumulation of BrdU-positive cells in the SVZ of Flt- 1 TK-/- was observed. In addition neural cells from Flt- 1 TK-/- in explant cultures display a significantly increased migration speed compared to controls. These date together with the decrease of BrdU-positive cells leaving the RMS towards the CC, implicate enhanced migration towards the OB of Flt- 1 TK-/-. Indeed in the plexiform (PL) and <b>periglomerular</b> <b>cell</b> layers (PGL) of the OB of Flt- 1 TK-/- contained significantly more BrdU-labelled cells. In addition in the PGL of the transgenic mice significantly more BrdU-labelled cells differentiated into neurons than in controls. Additionally, the differentiation into the dopaminergic interneuron subtype was increased in these mice. In the brain of Flt- 1 TK-/- VEGF-A protein level was higher, which lead to the hypothesis that VEGF-A is the major factor inducing the migration phenotype of VEGFR- 1 signalling-deficient mice. Intracerebroventricular infusion of VEGF-A displayed clearly that the increased VEGF-A levels are sufficient to induce the reduction in BrdU-positive neuronal progenitor cells in the RMS in control animals. This is also the first in vivo demonstration that VEGF-A influences neuroblasts migration in the RMS under physiological conditions. The higher VEGF-A levels could also account for the enhanced proliferation and neuronal differentiation. VEGFR- 1 is thereby a regulatory factor for adult olfactory bulb neurogenesis with a potential role in the differentiation of dopaminergic olfactory interneurons...|$|E

By analogy to similar {{parts of the brain}} such as the retina, many researchers have focused on how the olfactory bulb filters incoming information from receptor neurons in space, or how it filters incoming information in time.

40|$|Nitric oxide (NO) and Reelin both {{modulate}} neuronal plasticity {{in developing}} and mature synaptic networks. We recently showed a loss of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) protein in the olfactory bulb of reeler mutants and advanced {{the hypothesis that the}} Reelin and NO signalling pathways may influence each other. We now studied the distribution of NO sensitive guanylyl cyclase (NOsGC), Reelin and its receptor Apolipoprotein E 2 (ApoEr 2) in the olfactory bulb by multiple fluorescence labelling and tested whether nNOS and ApoEr 2 colocalize in this area. We also essayed the protein content of NOsGC in the reeler olfactory bulb and tested whether there are any changes in nNOS and NOsGC protein in other reeler brain areas. Olfactory bulb interneurons expressing ApoEr 2 and nNOS are only few in the glomerular layer but represent the large majority of granule cell layer interneurons. Conversely, NOsGC interneurons are rare in the granule cell layer and abundant as <b>periglomerular</b> <b>cells.</b> Reelin containing <b>periglomerular</b> <b>cells</b> almost entirely belong to the NOsGC subset. These data further support the hypothesis of a reciprocal signalling between Reelin/NOsGC and ApoEr 2 /nNOS expressing neurons to affect olfactory bulb activity. We also show that a significant rise in NOsGC content accompanies the decrease of nNOS protein in the reeler olfactory bulb. The same reciprocal changes present in the cortex/striatum and the hippocampus of reeler mice. Thus, the influence that the deficit of extracellular Reelin seems to exert on nNOS and its receptor {{is not limited to the}} olfactory bulb but is a general feature of the reeler brain...|$|R
40|$|In many brain regions, hyperpolarization-activated {{cationic}} currents (Ih) {{are involved}} in the generation of rhythmic activities, but the role of Ih in olfactory oscillations remains unclear. Knowledge of the cellular and subcellular distributions of hyperpolarization-activated and cyclic nucleotide-gated channel (HCN) subunits is necessary for understanding the role of Ih in olfactory network activities. Using light microscopic immunocytochemistry, we demonstrate strong HCN 1 labelling of the glomerular layer and moderate staining of granule cell, internal and external plexiform layers of the rat main olfactory bulb. In the glomerular layer, among many unlabelled neurons, two distinct subpopulations of juxtaglomerular cells are labelled. Approximately 10 % of the juxtaglomerular cells strongly express HCN 1. These small diameter cells are immunoreactive for GABA and comprise a subpopulation of <b>periglomerular</b> <b>cells.</b> An additional subset of juxtaglomerular cells (1 %) expresses low levels of HCN 1. They are large in diameter, GABA immunonegative but immunopositive for vesicular glutamate transporter 2, characterizing them as external tufted cells. Quantitative immunogold localization revealed that the somatic plasma membranes of <b>periglomerular</b> <b>cells</b> contain approximately four times more HCN 1 labelling than those of external tufted cells. Unlike in cortical pyramidal cells, immunogold density for HCN 1 does not significantly differ in somatic and dendritic plasma membranes of external tufted cells, indicating that post-synaptic potentials arriving at proximal and distal dendrites are modulated by the same density of Ih. Our results demonstrate a cell type-dependent expression of HCN 1 in the olfactory bulb and predict a differential contribution of distinct juxtaglomerular cell types to network oscillations...|$|R

In situ hybridisation showed that neuroligin 1 and 2 were expressed by second order mitral cells during early postnatal development but not in adults. The secreted ligand for a-neurexin, neurexophilin 1, was also expressed in the postnatal olfactory bulb. Neurexophilin 1 was detected in only <b>periglomerular</b> <b>cells</b> during the early postnatal period of glomerular formation but later was also expressed in mitral cells.
