5000|$|For networking, id Tech 3 uses a [...] "snapshot" [...] {{system to}} relay {{information}} about game [...] "frames" [...] {{to the client}} over UDP. The server attempts to omit {{as much information as}} possible about each frame, relaying only differences from the last frame the client <b>confirmed</b> <b>as</b> <b>received</b> (Delta encoding).

This presents many advantages as mod authors do not need to worry about crashing the entire game with bad code, clients could show more advanced effects and game menus than was possible in Quake II and the user interface for mods was entirely customizable. Unless operations which require a specific endianness are used, a QVM file will run the same on any platform supported by Quake III Arena. The engine also contains bytecode compilers for the x86 and PowerPC architectures, executing QVM instructions via an interpreter.|$|R

This report evaluates the Air Force's inventory control procedures for material shipped to contractors for repair or for use in repair. The Air Force and contractor personnel have not complied with DOD and Air Force inventory control procedures designed to safeguard material shipped to contractors, placing items worth billions of dollars at risk of fraud, waste, and abuse. The Air Force's three inventory control points have not restricted repair contractors' access to the specific items and quantities of government-furnished material needed to accomplish the contract. Quarterly reports {{on the status of}} shipped material have not been sent to property administration officials at the Defense Contract Management Agency. Contractors receiving shipped material have not (1) properly entered the receipt of shipments into their records and into the inventory control points' reporting systems or (2) routinely reported shipment discrepancies. Air Force procedures for following up on shipments that contractors have not <b>confirmed</b> <b>as</b> <b>received</b> are ineffective, leaving the status of the shipments uncertain. The Air Force has not provided adequate program oversight because it does not request and analyze data on contractor shipment discrepancies to identify their extent and cause so that corrective action may be taken. ...|$|R

40|$|Statistical {{analysis}} of amino acid and nucleotide sequences, especially sequence alignment, {{is one of}} Abstract the most commonly performed tasks in modern molecular biology((Author: <b>please</b> <b>confirm</b> that rewording is ok)). However, for many tasks in bioinformatics, the requirement for the features in an alignment to be consecutive is restrictive and `n-grams' have been used <b>as</b> features instead((Author: <b>please</b> <b>confirm</b> that rewording is ok)). N-grams are usually short nucleotide or amino acid sequences of length n, but the unit for a gram may be chosen arbitrarily. The n-gram concept is borrowed from language technologies where n-grams of words form the fundamental units in statistical language models. Despite the demonstrated utility of n-gram statistics for the biology domain, there is currently no publicly accessible generic tool for the efficient calculation of such statistics. Most sequence analysis tools will disregard matches {{because of the lack}} of statistical significance in finding short sequences.
