40|$|The Evolutionary Project Management method – {{abbreviated}} Evo – {{is arguably}} the best systems engineering project management method [1]. But Evo is also arguably the least known and least discussed <b>project</b> <b>management</b> <b>option.</b> This paper will attempt to {{shed some light on}} it. Evo is particularly good at dealing with complex, innovative, large systems – it does so by breaking down the project into a series of something like 50 incremental steps. Each Evo step is both an opportunity to learn something for sure, and an opportunity to deliver some useful results to the stakeholders. Principle E 1 : Decompose by performance results and stakeholders. Evolutionary project management demands that you deliver your requirements in small, for example 2 % of budget, steps. Many people initially assume that this means delivering certain components or functions. At the extreme they falsely assume we are talking about delivering a car by starting with one wheel. This is nowhere near the reality of Evo. The decomposition can follow many possible paths. The essential idea is this: • deliver real useful results to at least one stakeholder, at least one real person • deliver some of the results that were planned in the requirements specification – this can b...|$|E
40|$|In {{construction}} projects, contingency is {{the budget}} {{which is made}} available to cope with uncertainties that would incur schedule and cost overruns. Contingency estimation requires considering project cost, schedule and technology variability. The effect of dynamic <b>project</b> <b>management</b> of the decision maker should also be taken into account. Accordingly a real options approach for estimating contingency from the owner’s {{point of view is}} presented. This approach not only explicitly recognizes the uncertainty in the life cycle of a construction project, but also incorporates a dynamic <b>project</b> <b>management</b> mechanism into contingency estimation. The contingency is valued by minimizing the expected project cost via a multi‐stage stochastic model that accounts for the variability of project cost and schedule and the exercise of dynamic project crashing. The numerical results indicate that the value of the decision maker’s dynamic <b>project</b> <b>management</b> makes up an important portion of the contingency.

40|$|Information Technology (IT) <b>Project</b> <b>Management</b> methodologies are numerous, often varying from {{organization}} to organization, and sometimes from project to project {{within the same}} organization.

At times, even after due diligence has been practiced to identify the <b>management</b> <b>options</b> available for a given project, there may not be a perfect fit. At such times, or when a formal methodology does not exist in an organization or <b>project</b> <b>management</b> office, the best approach for a project may be to utilize a collective of “best practices,” instead of a concrete methodology. When tasked with the IT <b>Project</b> <b>Management</b> of the new Gary Ransdell Hall on WKU’s main campus, the IT Project Manager (PM) did not have a tried-and-true methodology to use for managing the project.
