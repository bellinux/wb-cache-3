A 55 cm long sediment core was collected from Bunnefjord (N 59. 84285, E 10. 72587), for micropaleontological and geochemical analyses. The core provided chronostratigraphical data for the past 300 years, dating back to the late 1600 s.

The natural conditions, around 1700 AD, were found to be of ecological class “Moderate”. Subsequently, the anthropogenic induced increase of organic carbon content and in turn deteriorating oxygen concentrations at the end of the 1800 s worsened the ecological status. The pollution and organic-flux maxima were in the 1970 ’s, and there has been some improvement ever since. However, the ecological status has been kept at “Very Bad”, due the slow remediation. There was established risk of ecological consequences and need of mitigating measures from 1925 until present.

40|$|The European Community Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) was {{established}} to provide guidelines for monitoring the quality of marine ecosystems. Monitoring the status of marine environments is traditionally based on macrofauna surveys, for which standardised methods have been established. Benthic foraminifera are also good indicators of environmental status because of their fast turnover rates, high degree of specialisation, and the preservation of dead assemblages in the fossil record. In spite of the growing interest in foraminiferal bio-monitoring during the last decades, no standardised methodology has been proposed until today. The aim of the FOraminiferal BIo-MOnitoring (FOBIMO) expert workshop, held in June 2011 at Fribourg, Switzerland, which assembled 37 scientists from 24 research groups and 13 countries, {{was to develop a}} suite of standard methods. This paper presents the main outcome of the workshop, a list of motivated recommendations with respect to sampling devices, sample storage, treatment, faunal analysis and documentation. Our recommendations fulfil the criteria imposed both by scientific rigour and by the practical limitations of routine studies. Hence, our aim is to standardise methodologies used in bio-monitoring only and not to limit the use of different methods in pure scientific studies. Unless otherwise stated, all recommendations concern living (stained) benthic foraminiferal assemblages. We have chosen to propose two types of recommendations. Mandatory recommendations have to be followed if a study wants to qualify as sound and compatible to the norms. The most important of these recommendations are the interval from 0 to 1 cm below the sediment surface has to be sampled, and an interface corer or box corer that keeps the sediment surface intact is to be used for offshore surveys. A grab sampler must not be deployed in soft sediments. Three replicate samples are to be taken and analysed separately. Samples are to be washed on a 63 -μm screen, and the living benthic foraminiferal fauna of the > 125 μm fraction is to be analysed. Splits are to be <b>picked</b> and <b>counted</b> entirely, and all counted foraminifera from at least one replicate per station have to be stored in micropalaeontological slides. Census data, supplementary laboratory data and microslides have to be archived. Advisory recommendations are to sample in autumn, to have a sample size of 50 cm 2 or a tube of 8 cm inner diameter, to use > 70 % ethanol as a preservative, rose Bengal at a concentration of 2 grams per litre for staining, and a staining time of at least 14 days. The split size should be defined by a target value of 300 specimens, heavy liquid separation should be avoided, and the 63 – 125 μm fraction or deeper sediment levels may be considered in some environments. We are convinced that the application of this protocol by a large number of scientists is a necessary first step to a general acceptance of benthic foraminifera as a reliable tool in bio-monitoring studies...|$|R

Day-neutral {{strawberries}} planted in May 1991 on sand loam (fine, loamy, mixed mesic, Typic Halpudoll) soil were arranged in a randomized complete block design with five replications and 3 treatments. Each block was a 100 -ft-long double row of plants with 12 -in. spacing between plants, and treatment subplots within blocks were 20 -ft segments of the double row. Data were taken only from the center 15 ft of each subplot. Timing of fungicide sprays for Botrytis fruit rot in the 2 ̆ 2 model-driven 2 ̆ 2 treatment was based on a leaf wetness-temperature model proposed by M.

Timing of insecticide sprays for tarnished plant bug in the 2 ̆ 2 modeldriven 2 ̆ 2 treatment was based on published criteria (Kovach et al. 1990. Strawberry Scouting Procedures. Bulletin No. 203, New York State IPM Program. p. 18). In the 2 ̆ 2 weekly 2 ̆ 2 treatment, insecticides and fungicides were applied at 7 -day inter-vals. No pesticide sprays were applied in either treatment until blooms appeared (5 Jul). Fungicides used (rates per 100 gal) were Ronilan FL (0. 5 pt) or Rovral 50 WP (8 oz), tank-mixed with Captan 50 WP (2 lb). The insecticide used was Sevin 50 WP (2 lb).

Day-neutral {{strawberries}} planted into plastic mulch in May 1992 on sandy loam soil (fine, loamy, mixed mesic, Typic Hapludoll) were arranged in a randomized complete block design with five treatments and four replications. Each block consisted of five 20 -ft-long double rows of plants with 12 -in spacing between plants in the double rows, and each 20 -ft segment was a treatment subplot. In three treatments (2 ̆ 2 post-infection 2 ̆ 2), timing of fungicide sprays was based on a leaf wetness-temperature model proposed by M. Ellis (pers. comm., Department of Plant Pathology, OARDC, Wooster, OH, and Bulger et al, Phytopathology 77 : 1225 - 1230) for control of Botrytis fruit rot. In the same treatments, timing of insecticide sprays for tarnished plant bug (IPB) were based on thresholds of TPB counts; a spray was applied when the mean number of TPB 2 ̆ 7 s (sum of nymphs and adults) per fruit cluster equaled or exceeded the threshold number. TPB numbers were assessed 2 x/week by beating 10 fruit clusters per plot (one cluster per sampled plant) twice over a white plastic dish and counting TPB nymphs and adults in the dish. A fourth treatment (2 ̆ 2 weekly 2 ̆ 2) was a weekly spray of fungicides and insecticides, and a fifth treatment (2 ̆ 2 unsprayed 2 ̆ 2) received no pesticide sprays. Pesticide spraying was started as berries began to ripen (14 Jul). Fungicides used (rates per 100 gal) were Ronilan FL (0. 5 pt) plus Benlate 50 WP (4 oz). After 17 Aug, when anthracnose had become severe, Captan 50 WP (2 lb) was substituted for Benlate. The insecticide used was Sevin 50 WP (2 lb).

40|$|Homology {{has been}} one of, if not the most, fecund {{concepts}} which has been used towards {{the understanding of the}} genomes of the model organisms. The evidence for this claim can be supported best with an examination of current research in comparative genomics. In comparative genomics, the information of genes or segments of the genome, and their location and sequence, are used to search for genes similar to them, known as 'homologues'. Homologues can be either within that same organism (paralogues), or among different species (orthologues). The importance in finding homologous genes within organisms or across species is that these similarities indicate the possibility of ascribing functions, mechanisms or structures which are required by a variety of species which present the same homology. The interest in structures and functions of genes and proteins common to multiple species {{is one of the main}} foci of comparative genomics. Because of this, research into the conservation of genes has been the basis of comparison with regards to homologous genes among diverse organisms. Different causal processes are involved in genetic pathways and mechanisms. Explanations of these depend upon which pathway, structure or mechanism is picked out. Each process has a different causal network to which different explanations refer. What comparative genomics explains are the different causal mechanisms which occur in processes such as differentiation, protein synthesis, and gene regulation. How these processes interact within the organism can only be understood when compared with organisms which possess homologous genes, gene sequences, similar developmental mechanisms, or those whose mechanisms for gene regulation are similar. Explanations which result from comparative genomics contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of both the complex structures and the diverse functions within the genomes of different organisms. There are two related problems which have plagued attempts to define the concept of homology. The first problem arises in clarifying what kind of similarity is involved in a homological comparison. A second problem occurs if more than one concept of homology is needed to pick out the kinds of similarity in different contexts of homological comparison. Homology is usually understood as <b>picking</b> out what <b>counts</b> as 'the same' between two or more organisms. Many of the attempts which have been made to define the concept of homology focus on which criteria are used to restrict the kinds of similarity which exist between two or more organisms or parts being compared. These are criteria which can be used reliably to infer shared ancestry. However, there have been many different attempts to define similarity which have produced a profusion of homology concepts. This profusion has led both to the conflation of what counts as 'the same' in different contexts and has also muddled the relations of comparison which various concepts use to identify homologues...|$|R

We were now important, had our Committee room in the Mansion House, and I remember that the old Mansion House butler recognised our importance so fully, that he took us into his confidence once in every week, while we sat waiting for a quorum. He had seen many Lord Mayors, and remembered those very superior Lord Mayors who lived before the extension of the municipal franchise, and spoke of his present masters with contempt. Among our persons of authority, and among the friends and followers they had brought, there were many who at that time found it hard to refuse if anybody offered for sale a pepper-pot shaped to suggest a round tower with a wolf-dog at its foot, and who would have felt it inappropriate to publish an Irish book, that had not harp and shamrock and green cover, so completely did their minds move amid Young Ireland images and metaphors, and I thought with alarm of the coming of Sir Charles Gavan Duffy; while here and there I noticed that smooth, smiling face that we discover for the first time in certain pictures by Velasquez; all that hungry, mediaeval speculation vanished, that had worn the faces of El Greco and in its place a self-complacent certainty that all had been arranged, provided for, set out in clear type, in manual of devotion or of doctrine. These, however, were no true disciples of Young Ireland, for Young Ireland had sought a nation unified by political doctrine, a subservient art and letters aiding and abetting. The movement of thought, which had in the 'fifties and 'fourties at Paris and London and Boston, filled literature, and especially poetical literature with curiosities about science, about history about politics, with moral purpose and educational fervour--abstractions all--had created a new instrument for Irish politics, a method of writing that took its poetical style from Campbell, Scott, Macauley, and Beranger, with certain elements from Gaelic, and its prose style--in John Mitchell, the only Young Ireland prose writer who had a style at all--from Carlyle. To recommend this method of writing as literature without much reservation and discrimination I contended was to be deceived or to practice deception. If one examined some country love-song, one discovered that it was not written by a man in love, but by a patriot who wanted to prove that we did indeed possess, in the words of Daniel O'Connell, [...] "the finest peasantry upon earth." [...] Yet one well-known anthology was introduced by the assertion that such love-poetry was superior to [...] "affected and artificial" [...] English love-songs like [...] "Drink to me only with thine eyes"--"affected and artificial," [...] the very words used by English Victorians who wrote for the newspapers to discourage capricious, personal writing. However, the greater number even of those who thought our famous anthology, The Spirit of the Nation, except for three or four songs, but good election rhyme, looked upon it much as certain enlightened believers look upon the story of Adam and Eve and the apple, or that of Jonah and the whale, which they do not question publicly, because such stories are an integral part of religion to simple men and women. I, upon the other hand, being in the intemperance of my youth, denied, as publicly as possible, merit to all but a few ballads translated from Gaelic writers, or written out of a personal and generally tragic experience.|$|R
