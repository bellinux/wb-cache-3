40|$|A {{precolumn}} backflush {{system based}} on capillary columns using midpoint pressure control is described. Midpoint backflush is made possible with a Capillary Flow Technology (CFT) purged union controlled by an AUX EPC channel on the Agilent 7890 A GC system. The key application discussed is prefractionation of crude oil that provides a high resolution separation of the C 4 to C 12 cut. A general backflush method using <b>Polywax</b> 500 is presented to illustrate the backflush concept...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was aimed to {{formulate}} and evaluate the Papaverine extended release tablet using polymers such as Eudragit grades like RSPO, L 100, S 100, <b>Polywax</b> and HPMC in order to decrease the dosing frequency. Papaverine extended-release tablets are the hydrochloride of an alkaloid obtained from opium or prepared synthetically. It belongs to the benzylisoquinoline group of alkaloids. The principal therapeutic action of Papaverine is its relaxant effect on smooth muscles, which leads to penile erection [...] Tablets were prepared by wet granulation method and evaluated by different parameters such as weight variation, hardness, friability, thickness, drug content uniformity and in vitro drug release study. All the tablets passed the tests. The interaction between drug and polymers were determined by using FTIR studies. The FTIR study reveals {{that there is no}} interaction between drug and polymers. Based on in-vitro drug release study F 11 - formulation showed extended release effect up t...|$|E
40|$|In this {{reporting}} period, {{a fundamental}} filtration study was continued {{to investigate the}} separation of Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis (FTS) liquids from iron-based catalyst particles. The overall focus {{of the program is}} with slurry-phase FTS in slurry bubble column reactor systems. Hydrocarbon products must be separated from catalyst particles before being removed from the reactor system. An efficient wax product/catalyst separation system is a key factor for optimizing operating costs for iron-based slurry-phase FTS. Previous work has focused on catalyst particle attrition and the formation of ultra-fine iron carbide and/or carbon particles. With the current study, we are investigating how the filtration properties are affected by these chemical and physical changes of the catalyst slurry during activation/synthesis. In this reporting period, a series of crossflow filtration experiments were initiated to study the effect of olefins and oxygenates on the filtration flux and membrane performance. Iron-based FTS reactor waxes contain a significant amount of oxygenates, depending on the catalyst formulation and operating conditions. Mono-olefins and aliphatic alcohols were doped into an activated iron catalyst slurry (with <b>Polywax)</b> to test their influence on filtration properties. The olefins were varied from 5 to 25 wt% and oxygenates from 6 to 17 wt% to simulate a range of reactor slurries reported in the literature. The addition of an alcohol (1 -dodecanol) was found to decrease the permeation rate while the olefin added (1 -hexadecene) had no effect on the permeation rate. A passive flux maintenance technique was tested that can temporarily increase the permeate rate for 24 hours...|$|E
40|$|Use of {{electron}} beam irradiation could effectively transfer energy to crude oil, resulting in improved cracking and reduction of operating temperatures. The overall {{objective is to}} crack heavy oil and make it less viscous while avoiding generation of micro-carbon residue and olefins. A flow loop system has been built to dynamically treat extra-heavy crude oils with {{electron beam}}. Operating temperature, dose rate, dose and shear rate have been identified to be the important parameters. This thesis focuses on analyzing the fluid properties and characterization of heavy crude oils pre and post treatment. Extra-heavy crude oil and bitumen with API gravity {{in the range of}} 7 - 8 ? (viscosity; order of 106 cP at 40 ?C) have been used for this study. Rheological studies and viscosity measurements have been performed using a rheometer. Existing viscosity-temperature models have been modified and utilized to obtain continuous viscosity-temperature plots. Further, blending experiments have been conducted to understand the effect of addition or loss of different yields (lighter fractions, middle distillates, heavy residue etc.) and account for discrepancies in mass balance. Oil characterization has been carried out using simulated distillation on a gas chromatograph. High temperature simulated distillation methods such as ASTM D 6352 and ASTM D 7169 have been used for the same. <b>Polywax</b> 655 has been employed to obtain the retention time calibration. Percentage weight off versus boiling point (% wt off vs BP) has been measured to obtain the % conversion post treatment. Experimental process conditions were broadly tested. Temperatures in the range of 100 - 300 ?C, dose rates of the order of 15 - 25 kGy/s and absorbed dose in the range of 20 - 1700 kGy were employed during the experiments. Initial tests yielded a reduction in viscosity of 50 % for oil # 1 (1300 kGy, 20 kGy/s) and 39 % for oil # 2 (560 kGy, 20 kGy/s) measured at 100 ?C. Simulated distillation results indicate a sample conversion of 9. 84 % and residue conversion (above 1000 ?F) of 20. 95 % for oil # 2 at conditions stated above. For oil # 1, sample conversion was 6 % and residue conversion (above 1000 ?F) was 16. 8 % at conditions stated above...|$|E
40|$|High {{molecular}} weight (HMW) hydrocarbons (defined herein as C 35 + compounds) {{are difficult to}} characterise by conventional analytical methods. Very few studies have reported precise and reproducible quantification of such compounds in fossil fuels. Nonetheless, such components have important effects on the physical and biological fate of fossil fuels in the geosphere. For example, the phase behaviour of waxy gas condensates is significantly affected by the varying proportions of HMW compounds. Similarly HMW compounds are amongst the most resistant petroleum components to biodegradation. The current study reports the development of reproducible quantitative high temperature capillary gas chromatography (HTCGC) methods for studying both these aspects of the chemistry of HMW hydrocarbons. In addition those hydrocarbons which remain unresolved when analysed by gas chromatography (so called unresolved complex mixtures UCMs) are also studied. UCMs may account for {{a large portion of}} the hydrocarbons in many fossil fuels yet very little is known about their composition. Knowledge of these compounds may be important in enhancing the prediction of phase behaviour. Oxidative degradation and GC-MS is used to elucidate the types of structures present within the UCM. The concentrations of C 3 S 4 h. ydrocarbons in two unusually waxy gas condensates from high temperature wells in the North Sea were determined by HTCGC. The whole C, 5 + fraction comprised about 20 % of the total hydrocarbons and consisted of compounds with carbon numbers extending up to and beyond Coo. By paying particular attention to sample dissolution and injection, good reproducibility and precision were obtained. For example, for authentic n-C, to n-C 60 alkanes a relative standard deviation of under 5 % for manual injection, linear response factors (1. 01 Cm to 0. 99 C 6), and a linear calibration for 5 ng to 25 ng on-column were found. Limits of detection are reported for the first time for HMW n-alkanes. The limits were found to be as low as 0. 8 ng for Cto to 1. 87 ng for C 60. Tristearin is proposed as a suitable HTCGC internal standard for quantification since the FID response factor (1. 1) was close to that of the HMW n-alkanes and response was linear. Importantly, when co-injected with the two waxy North Sea condensates, tristearin was adequately separated from the closest eluting alkanes, n-C 59 and n-C 60 under normal operating conditions. Qualitative characterisation of the HMW compounds in the waxy gas condensates and in synthetic wax blends (<b>polywax</b> 1000) using HTCGC-EI MS and HTCGC-CI MS produced molecular ions or pseudo molecular ions for n-alkanes up to n- C 6 o. The spectra of some HMW compounds contained fragment ions characteristic of branched compounds but detailed characterisation was very limited. This study has also shown, for the first time, the significance of the unresolved complex mixture in gas condensatesU.

Thesew ere found to be between 64 to 97 % unresolved after molecular sieving (5 A) and urea adduction. The UCMs were oxidised using CrO 3 /AcOHw hich produced 5 - 12 % C 02, and 55 - 83 % dichloromethane-solublep roducts. Thus 65 - 94 % of the original UCMs were accounted for as oxidation products. The remainder were thought to be water soluble acids which could not be determined in the presence of the AcOH reagent. Of the recovered oxidised products, 27 - 81 % were resolved and these comprised mainly n-monocarboxylic acids (19 - 48 %). The average chain length was found to be C 12 indicating the average length of alkyl groups. Branched acids, ketones, ketoacids, ndicarboxylic acids, branched dicarboxylic acids, lactones, isoprenoid acids, alkylcyclohexane carboxylic acids and toluic acids accounted for the majority of the remaining resolved products.

Overall, oxidation provided structural information for about half of the UCM. HTCGC was also used to measure the biodegradability of HMW alkanes in a waxy Indonesian oil. Traditional alkane isolation techniques (TLC and CC) discriminated against HMW compounds above C 40 whereas adsorption onto alumina in a warm cyclohexane slurry provided an aliphatic fraction still rich in HMW compounds and suitable as a biodegradation substrate. A waxy Indonesian oil was subjected to 136 day biodegradation by Pseudomonas fluorescens. Extraction efficiencies of over 90 % (RSD < 5 %) were obtained for n-alkanes up to C 6 o using continuous liquid-liquid extraction. Over 80 % of the oil aliphatic fraction was degraded within 14 days. After 136 days only 14 % of the original aliphatic fraction remained, yet surprisingly no decreases in the concentrations of compounds above C 45 were observed. However, the use of a rapid screening biodegradation method proved conclusively that Pseudomonasfluorescens was capable of utilising n-alkanes up to C 60 once the bacteria had acclimated to the HMW alkanes. This is the first report of bacterial utilisation of an n-alkane as large as C. ...|$|E
