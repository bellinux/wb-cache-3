5|$|A {{piece of}} a garment signed by Ivan Alexander and {{interwoven}} with gold was discovered in a noble's grave near Pirot in the 1970s; today it is preserved in the National Museum of Serbia in Belgrade. It is the first find of its kind, demonstrating a medieval tradition attested in writing according to which Orthodox rulers would <b>present</b> <b>their</b> most eminent dignitaries with a {{piece of a}} garment they had worn.|$|E

5|$|A single pair of {{long and}} slender {{antennae}} is present, the segments {{of which are}} relatively few and elongated. They were most probably used as sensory organs, with most segments possessing small setae (bristles). A pair of short lobed structures (possible antennules) are also <b>present,</b> <b>their</b> position corresponding {{to the location of}} the second pair of antennae in modern-day crustaceans. In between them is a small triangular rostral plate with a narrow and sharp central ridge.|$|E
5|$|Although Watership Down is a {{peaceful}} habitat, Hazel realizes {{there are no}} does (female rabbits), thus making {{the future of the}} warren certain to end with the inevitable death of the rabbits present. With the help of their useful new friend, a black-headed gull named Kehaar, they locate a nearby warren called Efrafa, which is overcrowded and has many does. Hazel sends a small embassy, led by Holly, to Efrafa to <b>present</b> <b>their</b> request for does.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the castle}} could be completed, however, the French attacked. Admiral Claude d'Annebault crossed the Channel and arrived off the Solent with 200 ships on 19 July, where the local {{authorities}} feared Sandown Castle might be {{the target of a}} night attack. 2,000 French soldiers men landed on the Isle of Wight and attacked Sandown, where labourers were still <b>present.</b> <b>Their</b> advance soon stalled, however, and the French retreated back to their fleet, bringing the invasion threat to an end; the castle was finally completed after their departure.|$|E

5|$|In 2010, {{the health}} of the Dry Island Albertosaurus {{assembly}} was reported upon. Most specimens showed no sign of disease. On three phalanges of the foot strange bony spurs, consisting of abnormal ossifications of the tendons, so-called enthesophytes, were <b>present,</b> <b>their</b> cause unknown. Two ribs and a belly-rib showed signs of breaking and healing. One adult specimen had a left lower jaw showing a puncture wound and both healed and unhealed bite marks. The low number of abnormalities compares favourably with the health condition of a Majungasaurus population of which it in 2007 was established that 19% of individuals showed bone pathologies.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to Yusuf Pasha's request, the Ottoman government sent its instructions to Rhodes, where {{they arrived at}} the end of April. The government would set up an official investigatory commission before which representatives of the Jewish and Greek communities were ordered to <b>present</b> <b>their</b> evidence. In mid-May, the government sent orders to release the six remaining Jewish prisoners. On May 21, they were ceremoniously called before the court (shura) and freed under the guarantees of the elders of the Jewish community.|$|E

Some museums, including the Museo Stibbert, and the Kyoto Costume Institute in Japan, <b>present</b> <b>their</b> metal bodices as fashionable late 16th-century garments. The Victoria and Albert Museum in London describes their iron corset (formerly owned by the painter Talbot Hughes) as dating from the 18th century and likely intended for orthopaedic purposes. Others, such as the iron corset in the Fashion Institute of Technology, are presented as fakes.|$|E
5|$|On 3 January 1523, the Zurich {{city council}} invited the clergy {{of the city}} and {{outlying}} region to a meeting to allow the factions to <b>present</b> <b>their</b> opinions. The bishop was invited to attend or to send a representative. The council would render a decision on who would be allowed to continue to proclaim their views.

5|$|Pemex {{disallowed}} {{release of}} specific data but let Penfield and company official Antonio Camargo <b>present</b> <b>their</b> results at the 1981 Society of Exploration Geophysicists conference. That year's conference was underattended and their report attracted scant attention.

Although Penfield {{had plenty of}} geophysical data sets, he had no rock cores or other physical evidence of an impact.|$|E

5|$|The {{decision}} to invite Bach {{was made by}} the council on 15 January 1723. The council seemed to have preferred Bach and Graupner because they were invited to show two cantatas each, while other candidates were requested to show only one. Two candidates even had to <b>present</b> <b>their</b> work in the same service. Graupner's performance took place on the last Sunday after Epiphany, 17 January 1723. Two days before the event, the town council already agreed to offer him the position.|$|E
5|$|This {{version was}} criticised {{even before the}} museum board had had time to <b>present</b> <b>their</b> own view. August Brunius, who had {{expressed}} his enthusiasm for the Gustav Vasa painting, reacted against the choice of subject, like most critics. The choice of subject was only aggravated by {{the way it was}} presented. Brunius felt the painting to be unreal, unbelievable and not very relevant for the modern Swedes of the early 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the investigation, the {{authorities}} in Britain and Gibraltar refused to provide any information or {{to comment on the}} journalists' findings. Thus, This Week were unable to <b>present</b> <b>their</b> conclusions to a member of the government and broadcast their reaction, as was the usual practice for closing such a documentary. In place of such a conclusion, Bolton approached George Carman—a leading London lawyer specialising in human rights issues—who agreed to be interviewed for the programme.|$|E

5|$|Although Panther Central, the Towers Lobby which connects {{all three}} towers, and the dining {{services}} {{located on the}} ground floor are accessible to everyone, only residents are allowed in the individual towers and must <b>present</b> <b>their</b> student ID card to a 24-hour security guard to gain entrance. Visitors to any of the Towers must be signed in by a resident of the Tower, and must present either their student ID card if they are a student or a valid form of photographic identification if they are not. Guests signed in by residents must be signed out and leave the Tower by 2:00 AM. If not, an overnight stay request must be completed, of which a student can only file a certain number each academic semester. No resident is permitted to sign in more than three people at one time.|$|E
5|$|As Zwingli {{was working}} on {{establishing}} these political alliances, Charles V, the Holy Roman Emperor, invited Protestants to the Augsburg Diet to <b>present</b> <b>their</b> views {{so that he could}} make a verdict on the issue of faith. The Lutherans presented the Augsburg Confession. Under the leadership of Martin Bucer, the cities of Strasbourg, Constance, Memmingen, and Lindau produced the Tetrapolitan Confession. This document attempted to take a middle position between the Lutherans and Zwinglians. It was too late for the Burgrecht cities to produce a confession of their own. Zwingli then produced his own private confession, Fidei ratio (Account of Faith) in which he explained his faith in twelve articles conforming to the articles of the Apostles' Creed. The tone was strongly anti-Catholic as well as anti-Lutheran. The Lutherans did not react officially, but criticised it privately. Zwingli's and Luther's old opponent, Johann Eck, counter-attacked with a publication, Refutation of the Articles Zwingli Submitted to the Emperor.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 1859, PedroII {{departed}} {{on a trip to}} provinces {{north of}} the capital, visiting Espírito Santo, Bahia, Sergipe, Alagoas, Pernambuco and Paraíba. He returned in February 1860 after four months. The trip was a huge success, with the Emperor welcomed everywhere with warmth and joy. The first half of the 1860s saw peace and prosperity in Brazil. Civil liberties were maintained. Freedom of speech had existed since Brazil's independence and was strongly defended by PedroII. He found newspapers from the capital and from the provinces an ideal way to keep track of public opinion and the nation's overall situation. Another means of monitoring the Empire was through direct contacts with his subjects. One opportunity for this was during regular Tuesday and Saturday public audiences, where anyone of any social class, including slaves, could gain admittance and <b>present</b> <b>their</b> petitions and stories. Visits to schools, colleges, prisons, exhibitions, factories, barracks and other public appearances presented further opportunities to gather first-hand information.|$|E
