5|$|Despite the {{presence}} of the de novo pathway, the salvage reactions are essential in humans; a lack of niacin in the diet causes the vitamin deficiency disease <b>pellagra.</b> This high requirement for NAD results from the constant consumption of the coenzyme in reactions such as posttranslational modifications, since the cycling of NAD between oxidized and reduced forms in redox reactions does not change the overall levels of the coenzyme.|$|E
5|$|Well-known human vitamin {{deficiencies}} involve thiamine (beriberi), niacin (<b>pellagra),</b> vitamin C (scurvy), {{and vitamin}} D (rickets). In {{much of the}} developed world, such deficiencies are rare; {{this is due to}} (1) an adequate supply of food and (2) the addition of vitamins and minerals to common foods (fortification). In addition to these classical vitamin deficiency diseases, some evidence has also suggested links between vitamin deficiency and a number of different disorders.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pellagra</b> {{developed}} {{especially among}} the vulnerable populations in institutions such as orphanages and prisons, because of the monotonous and restricted diet. Soon <b>pellagra</b> began to occur in epidemic proportions in states south of the Potomac and Ohio rivers. The <b>pellagra</b> epidemic lasted for nearly four decades beginning in 1906. It was estimated that there were 3 million cases and 100,000 deaths due to <b>pellagra</b> during the epidemic.|$|E
25|$|Though <b>pellagra</b> {{predominantly}} {{occurs in}} developing countries, sporadic cases of <b>pellagra</b> may be observed within industrialized nations, primarily in chronic alcoholics and patients living with functional absorption complications.|$|E
25|$|Between 1906 and 1940 {{more than}} 3 million Americans were {{affected}} by <b>pellagra</b> with more than 100,000 deaths. Joseph Goldberger was assigned to study <b>pellagra</b> by the Surgeon General of the United States and produced good results. In the late 1930s, studies by Tom Spies, Marion Blankenhorn, and Clark Cooper established that niacin cured <b>pellagra</b> in humans. The disease was greatly reduced as a result.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two main}} types of <b>pellagra,</b> primary and secondary. Primary <b>pellagra</b> {{is due to a}} diet that does not contain enough niacin and tryptophan. Secondary <b>pellagra</b> is due to a poor ability to use the niacin within the diet. This can occur as a result of alcoholism, long term diarrhea, carcinoid syndrome, Hartnup disease, and a number of {{medications}} such as isoniazid. Diagnosis is typically based on symptoms and may be assisted by urine testing.|$|E
25|$|Prognosis of {{deficiency}} {{is excellent}} with treatment. Without, <b>pellagra</b> will gradually progress {{and lead to}} death within 4–5 years, often a result of malnutrition from prolonged diarrhea, or complications as caused by concurrent infections or neurological symptoms. Symptoms of <b>pellagra</b> can be cured with exogenous administration of nicotinic acid or nicotinamide.|$|E
25|$|Casimir Funk, {{who helped}} {{elucidate}} {{the role of}} thiamin in the etiology of beriberi, was an early investigator {{of the problem of}} <b>pellagra.</b> Funk suggested that a change in the method of milling corn was responsible for the outbreak of <b>pellagra,</b> but no attention was paid to his article on this subject.|$|E
25|$|Niacin and {{niacinamide}} {{are used}} for prevention and treatment of <b>pellagra.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1937, Conrad Elvehjem, a {{biochemistry}} {{professor at}} the University of Wisconsin-Madison, showed that the vitamin niacin cured <b>pellagra</b> (manifested as black tongue) in dogs. Later studies by Dr. Tom Spies, Marion Blankenhorn, and Clark Cooper established that niacin also cured <b>pellagra</b> in humans, for which Time Magazine dubbed them its 1938 Men of the Year in comprehensive science.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pellagra</b> {{can develop}} {{according}} to several mechanisms, classically {{as a result of}} niacin (vitamin B3) deficiency, which results in decreased NAD production leading to most of the pathology (since NAD and its phosphorylated NADP form are cofactors required in many body processes, the pathological impact of <b>pellagra</b> is broad and results in death if not treated).|$|E
25|$|The classic {{symptoms}} of <b>pellagra</b> are diarrhea, dermatitis, dementia, and death ("the four Ds").|$|E
25|$|The {{first was}} to {{research}} the causes, effects and possible {{solution to the problem}} of <b>pellagra.</b> This disease, of the three D’s — dermatitis, diarrhoea and dementia — is caused by lack of protein-rich foods in the diet and a subsequent lack of vitamin B3. Jessie’s research into <b>pellagra</b> lasted for ten years, and her findings showed that even such simple, readily available diet supplements as two glasses of red wine per week reduced the effects of the illness.|$|E
25|$|Amino acids are reabsorbed by sodium {{dependent}} transporters in {{the proximal}} tubule. Hartnup {{disease is a}} deficiency of the tryptophan amino acid transporter, which results in <b>pellagra.</b>|$|E
25|$|Those {{afflicted with}} <b>pellagra</b> may undergo {{pathological}} alterations in the nervous system. Findings may include demylenation and degeneration of various affected {{parts of the}} brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves.|$|E
25|$|Vitamin B was {{originally}} {{considered to have}} two components, a heat-labile vitamin B1 and a heat-stable vitamin B2. In the 1920s, vitamin B2 {{was thought to be}} the factor necessary for preventing <b>pellagra.</b> In 1923, Paul Gyorgy in Heidelberg was investigating egg-white injury in rats; the curative factor for this condition was called vitamin H (which is now called biotin or vitamin B7). Since both <b>pellagra</b> and vitamin H deficiency were associated with dermatitis, Gyorgy decided to test the effect of vitamin B2 on vitamin H deficiency in rats. He enlisted the service of Wagner-Jauregg in Kuhn’s laboratory. In 1933, Kuhn, Gyorgy, and Wagner found that thiamin-free extracts of yeast, liver, or rice bran prevented the growth failure of rats fed a thiamin-supplemented diet.|$|E
25|$|If untreated, <b>pellagra</b> {{can kill}} within {{four or five}} years. Treatment is with nicotinamide, which has the same vitamin {{function}} as niacin and a similar chemical structure, but has lower toxicity. The frequency and amount of nicotinamide administered depends on {{the degree to which}} the condition has progressed.|$|E
25|$|It was {{eventually}} {{discovered that the}} indigenous Americans had learned to soak maize in alkali-water—made with ashes and lime (calcium oxide) since at least 1200–1500 BC by Mesoamericans and North Americans—which liberates the B-vitamin niacin, the lack {{of which was the}} underlying cause of the condition known as <b>pellagra.</b>|$|E
25|$|Despite {{clinical}} symptoms, blood {{level of}} tryptophan or urinary metabolites such as 2-pyridone/N-methylniacinamide ratio <2 or NAD/NADP ratio in {{red blood cells}} {{could be used to}} diagnose <b>pellagra.</b> Diagnosis could be confirmed after rapid improvements in the symptoms in patients using high doses of niacin (250–500nbsp&mg/day) or niacin enriched food.|$|E
25|$|Azathioprine {{decreases}} {{the effects of}} the anticoagulant warfarin and of non-depolarizing muscle relaxants, but increases the effect of depolarizing muscle relaxants. It can also interfere with niacin (vitamin B3), resulting in at least one case to <b>pellagra</b> and fatal medullary aplasia. It has also been reported to cause vitamin B12 deficiency.|$|E
25|$|Linguist Sterling Eisiminger, {{based on}} the {{testimony}} of informants from the Southern United States, speculated that the prevalence of <b>pellagra</b> in the region {{during the great depression}} {{may have contributed to the}} rise in popularity of the term; red, inflamed skin is one of the first symptoms of that disorder to appear.|$|E
25|$|Scurvy {{is one of}} the {{accompanying}} diseases of malnutrition (other such micronutrient deficiencies are beriberi or <b>pellagra)</b> and thus is still widespread in areas of the world depending on external food aid. Although rare, there are also documented cases of scurvy due to poor dietary choices by people living in industrialized nations.|$|E
25|$|Health {{problems}} associated with maize-based diets in modern times have usually been remedied by means of vitamin supplements and economic improvement leading to a broader diet, rather than by adoption of nixtamalization. Though <b>pellagra</b> has vanished from Europe and the United States, it remains a major public health problem in lower Egypt, parts of South Africa, and southwestern India.|$|E
25|$|Severe niacin {{deficiency}} typically {{manifests itself}} as the disease <b>pellagra.</b> Synthesis of B3 from tryptophan involves vitamin B2 and B6, so deficiencies in either of these nutrients can lead to niacin deficiency. An excess of leucine, an essential amino acid, in the diet can also interfere with tryptophan conversion and subsequently result in a B3 deficiency.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{nutritional}} {{benefits of}} nixtamalization {{arise from the}} alkaline processing involved. These conditions convert corn's bound niacin to free niacin, making it available for absorption into the body, thus preventing <b>pellagra.</b> Alkalinity also reduces {{the amount of the}} protein zein available to the body, which improves the balance among essential amino acids, although the overall amount of protein is reduced.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, European {{settlers}} did {{not always}} adopt the nixtamalization process, except {{in the case of}} hominy grits, though maize became a staple among the poor of the southern states. This led to endemic <b>pellagra</b> in poor populations throughout the southern US in the early 20th century. A more varied diet and fortification of wheat flour, the other staple food, have essentially eliminated this deficiency.|$|E
25|$|Soaking the maize in limewater is {{important}} because it makes available the B vitamin niacin and the amino acid tryptophan. When maize was brought to Europe, Africa and Asia from the New World, this crucial step was often omitted. Those whose diet consisted mostly of corn meal often became sick— {{because of the lack of}} niacin and tryptophan— with the deficiency disease <b>pellagra,</b> which was common in Spain, Northern Italy, and the southern United States.|$|E
25|$|Adoption of the nixtamalization process did not {{accompany}} the grain to Europe and beyond, {{perhaps because the}} Europeans already had more efficient milling processes for hulling grain mechanically. Without alkaline processing, maize is a much less beneficial foodstuff, and malnutrition struck many areas where it became a dominant food crop. In the nineteenth century, <b>pellagra</b> epidemics were recorded in France, Italy, and Egypt, and kwashiorkor hit parts of Africa where maize had become a dietary staple.|$|E
25|$|The nixtamalization {{process was}} very {{important}} in the early Mesoamerican diet, as unprocessed maize is deficient in free niacin. A population depending on untreated maize as a staple food risks malnourishment, and {{is more likely to}} develop deficiency diseases such as <b>pellagra.</b> Maize also is deficient in essential amino acids, which can result in kwashiorkor. Maize cooked with lime provided niacin in this diet. Beans, when consumed with the maize, provided the amino acids required to balance the diet for protein.|$|E
25|$|Victims of {{starvation}} are often {{too weak to}} sense thirst, and therefore become dehydrated. All movements become painful due to muscle atrophy and dry, cracked skin that is caused by severe dehydration. With a weakened body, diseases are commonplace. Fungi, for example, often grow under the esophagus, making swallowing painful. Vitamin deficiency is also a common result {{of starvation}}, often leading to anemia, beriberi, <b>pellagra,</b> and scurvy. These diseases collectively can also cause diarrhea, skin rashes, edema, and heart failure. Individuals are often irritable and lethargic as a result.|$|E
25|$|The {{traditional}} {{food preparation}} method of maize ("corn"), nixtamalization, by native New World cultivators who had domesticated corn, required {{treatment of the}} grain with lime, an alkali. The lime treatment {{has been shown to}} make niacin nutritionally available and reduce the chance of developing <b>pellagra.</b> When maize cultivation was adopted worldwide, this preparation method was not accepted because the benefit was not understood. The original cultivators, often heavily dependent on maize, did not suffer from pellagra; it became common only when maize became a staple that was eaten without the traditional treatment.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pellagra</b> is {{most common}} to populations within {{developing}} {{countries in which}} corn is the dietary staple. The disease has virtually disappeared from industrialized countries, yet still appears in India and parts of China and Africa. This is {{in part due to}} the bound form of niacin that unprocessed corn contains, which is not readily absorbed into the human body. The processes involved in making corn tortillas, can release the bound niacin into a more absorbable form. Pellegra is not problematic in countries which traditionally prepare their corn in this way, but is a problem in other countries where unprocessed corn is main source of caloric intake.|$|E
25|$|Medication and {{supplemental}} niacin {{are primarily}} {{used to treat}} high blood cholesterol and <b>pellagra</b> (niacin deficiency). Insufficient niacin in the diet can cause nausea, skin and mouth lesions, anemia, headaches, and tiredness. The lack of niacin may also be observed in pandemic deficiency disease, which {{is caused by a}} lack of five crucial vitamins (niacin, vitamin C, thiamin, vitamin D, and vitamin A) and is usually found in areas of widespread poverty and malnutrition. Niacin is provided in the diet from a variety of whole and processed foods, with highest contents in fortified packaged foods and meat from various animal sources. Some countries require its addition to grains.|$|E
25|$|In 1941, {{the wheat}} {{industry}} began to adopt voluntary widespread enrichment (fortification) of wheat flour with vitamins, folic acid, and iron, {{the outcome of}} a recommendation by the National Nutrition Conference for Defense, charged with investigating the causes of poor health among many World War II recruits. By 1942, some 75 percent of breads in the United States were fortified. Mandatory fortification requirements went into effect in 1943, following the publication of the first U.S. government recommended dietary allowances. The removal of naturally occurring nutrients that occurs in grain processing led to a number of diseases caused by nutritional deficiency, including beriberi, <b>pellagra,</b> neural tube defect, and iron deficiency anemia. Enrichment helped eradicate or reduce the frequency of these conditions in the United States.|$|E
25|$|Most of the niacin in mature {{cereal grains}} is present as niacytin, which is niacin {{bound up in}} a complex with {{hemicellulose}} which is nutritionally unavailable. In mature corn this may be up to 90% of the total niacin content. The preparation method of nixtamalization using the whole dried corn kernel made this niacin nutritionally available and reduced the chance of developing <b>pellagra.</b> Niacytin is concentrated in the aleurone and germ layers which are removed by milling. The milling and degerming of corn {{in the preparation of}} cornmeal became feasible with the development of the Beall degerminator which was originally patented in 1901 and was used to separate the grit from the germ in corn processing. However this process of degermination reduces the niacin content of the cornmeal.|$|E
25|$|The {{cause is}} uncertain, {{but it is}} thought to be caused by {{accumulation}} of epithelial squames and proliferation of chromogenic (i.e., color-producing) microorganisms. There may be an increase in keratin production or a decrease in normal desquamation (shedding of surface epithelial cells). Many people with BHT are heavy smokers. Other possible associated factors are poor oral hygiene, general debilitation, hyposalivation (i.e., decreased salivary flow rate), radiotherapy, overgrowth of fungal or bacterial organisms, and a soft diet. Occasionally, BHT may be caused by the use of antimicrobial medications (e.g., tetracyclines), or oxidizing mouthwashes or antacids. A soft diet may be involved as normally food has an abrasive action on the tongue, which keeps the filiform papillae short. <b>Pellagra,</b> a condition caused by a vitamin deficiency, may cause a thick greyish fur to develop on the dorsal tongue, along with other oral signs.|$|E
