The principle aim of the thesis is to assess the legality of mass cyber surveillance of the Five Eyes alliance, {{with an emphasis on}} the United States and the United Kingdom. The study also considers the growing trend among the law enforcement agencies to access data without consent located in foreign jurisdictions without recourse to the Mutual Legal Assistance arrangements. The objective of the thesis is to demonstrate that these activities breach states’ human rights obligations under the international human rights frameworks and to show the unprecedented impact that surveillance technologies continue to have on this right. The research also highlights the inadequate protection of privacy in the internet. This leads to the evaluation of a number of possible legal solutions on the international level to the problem of mass surveillance, since the internet is a global environment designed for unrestricted data flows among jurisdictions and therefore facilitates continued violation of <b>privacy</b> <b>of</b> <b>communications</b> and data privacy. The thesis finds that bearing in mind (a) the highly politicised nature of the internet governance discourse, (b) the reluctance of states to subject peacetime espionage to international law regulation through a legally binding treaty, (c) the fact that international human rights law relating to <b>privacy</b> <b>of</b> <b>communications</b> is in need of modernization, (d) the reluctance of states to commit to a legally binding cyber treaty, (e) the slow pace with which customary cyber international law rules emerge and (f) the tendencies of states on the domestic level towards the introduction of draconian surveillance legislation at the expense of privacy, any progress in this regard at this stage will be piecemeal and likely to be achieved through a combination of the updating of the existing international and regional human rights and data protection instruments and soft law agreements...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Mobile {{wireless}} networks, such as mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), {{are vulnerable}} to passive attacks that threat the <b>privacy</b> <b>of</b> <b>communications.</b> Moreover, threats can now be launched from mobile platforms and with new techniques for eavesdropping, locating and fingerprinting wireless transmis-sions. Recently many wireless anonymous schemes have been studied, and mobility often {{plays an important role}} in regards to the effectiveness of wireless anonymity. In this paper, we focus on the impact of node motion behaviors. We first illustrate the emerging anonymity threat of “venue privacy attacks ” to trace mobile wireless nodes. We then propose “motion-MIX ” as the countermeasure to defend against the threat. Motion-MIX calls for protection at all the layers of the protocol stack. We further use a new asymptotic security model to verify motion-MIX’s effectiveness against venue privacy attacks. In a scalable ad hoc network, we prove that the probability of security breach is negligible with respect to the number of network nodes. I...|$|E

40|$|Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications (DECT) is a world-wide {{wireless}} standard {{sustained by}} ETSI and {{widely used in}} cordless telephony. Whilst domestic DECT cordless phones were primarily designed {{to be used in}} connection with the Public Switched Telephone Network, their presence in Unified Communications systems has become more and more common given their reliability, flexibility and interoperability. The DECT protocol foresees the usage of authentication and encryption {{in order to protect the}} <b>privacy</b> <b>of</b> the voice <b>communications.</b> Unfortunately, the cryptographic mechanisms foreseen by the standard do not provide support for forward secrecy. As a consequence, the compromise of the long-term secret cryptographic key leads to the decryption of any previous, present and future encrypted communication.

40|$|Abstract Traffic {{analysis}} has definitely shown that encryption {{is not enough}} to protect the <b>privacy</b> <b>of</b> <b>communications</b> implemented over packet networks. The very features of packet traffic, like packet lengths statistics, inter-packet times, volumes of exchanged traffic, communication patterns, leak information. Leakage ranges from the kind of application that generates the information flow carried into the supposedly secure connection to parts of its content. We propose traffic masking as a countermeasure. Full confidentiality protection is discussed and the traffic masking framework is introduced and motivated. The optimization and performance assessment of the masking device is evaluated both through a general analytical model, mainly useful to gain basic insight, and by a real network emulation of a distributed secure multiparty computation application, where confidentiality requirements are key to the application itself. It is shown that essentially full confidentiality can be attained for a practical distributed security application by accepting an increase of the traffic volume by a factor 2. 4 and an increase of the task completion time of 30 %. Hence, (almost) full privacy appears to be more appealing for contexts where delay constraints are more valuable than bandwidth...|$|E

The right is also protected at common law- a breach of a person's privacy constitutes an iniura. E-mail communications are therefore protected by both, the common law and the Constitution. The question that this work seeks to answer is, whether the Government has the right to intercept and/or monitor private e-mail communications. The right to privacy is not absolute, case law and legislation show that this right can be limited. At common law, a valid defence will negate the unlawfulness of the invasion. In terms of the Constitution, the right to privacy can only be limited in accordance with the limitation clause-section 36. For each case, courts will have to balance, the government's interest in combating crime and that of the citizen to the privacy of their e-mail communications.

40|$|The <b>privacy</b> <b>of</b> {{wireless}} <b>communications</b> {{is becoming}} an important issue due to the open nature of wireless medium. Many research work have been proposed to address the anonymity of communicating parties, the location <b>privacy</b> <b>of</b> the message source and destination, and the <b>privacy</b> <b>of</b> the network routing paths. However, {{with the advent of}} new radio identification and localization techniques, more advanced privacy attacks are possible. We describe a new privacy attack in which the adversary tries to infer the itineraries of the nodes in the network. To protect itinerary privacy, we design an algorithm, called the ∆-mobility camouflaging algorithm, which can be applied upon any mobility model by changing the original motion segments into ∆-shaped camouflaging paths. Our analysis results show that ∆-mobility camouflaging algorithm is costeffective, which in most cases decreases more than 80 % itinerary exposure probability at a cost of less than 3 % extra travel distance. Through comparing DSR routing performance under different mobility models and their counterparts with ∆-motion, we find ∆-mobility camouflaging algorithm does not degrade network layer routing performance in terms of message delivery ratio, delivery latency and routing overhead. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{relationship}} between privacy, technology, and law is complex. Thomas Jefferson’s prescient nineteenth century observation that laws and institutions must {{keep pace with}} the times offers a vision for change. Statutory law and court precedents help to define our right to privacy, however, the development of new technologies has complicated the application of old precedents and statutes. Third party organizations, such as Google, facilitate new methods of communication, and the government can often collect the information that third parties receive with a subpoena or court order, rather than a Fourth Amendment-mandated warrant. Privacy promotes fundamental democratic freedoms, however, under current law, the digital age has diminished the right to privacy in our electronic communications data. This work explores the statutory and constitutional law protecting our right to privacy, as well as the inadequacies that have developed with the digital revolution. With commonplace use of third parties to facilitate electronic communication, our courts and lawmakers must amend current laws and doctrines to protect the <b>privacy</b> <b>of</b> <b>communications</b> in the digital age. To provide clarity and appropriate data privacy protections, the following clarifications and amendments should be made to the third party doctrine and the Stored Communications Act (SCA) : 1) third party doctrine should only apply to context data, 2) content data should be protected by the Fourth Amendment, 3) the SCA should eliminate the distinction between Remote Computing Services (RCS) data and Electronic Communication Services (ECS) data, and 4) the SCA should require warrants for all content data acquisition...|$|E

If one accepts this assumption, it follows that the level of protection against surveillance by law enforcement officers should be the same[ [...] . ] As technology continues to blur the distinction between wire and electronic communication, it becomes apparent that a new methodology must be developed in order to provide logical and consistent protection to private communications. The statutes must be revised so as to protect the <b>privacy</b> <b>of</b> <b>communications</b> while also providing a means by which law enforcement officers can obtain judicial approval to eavesdrop when necessary. Otherwise, increasing integration between data and voice communications will render the current statutory scheme arbitrary and impractical. By way of background, this article will discuss the law governing mail searches as well as the law of covert searches generally. This article will go on to discuss the regulation of pen registers, and will then trace the evolution of the relevant federal statutory and constitutional protections afforded to telephone conversations. Next, this article will discuss the statutory protections and the emerging case law addressing the privacy of email and other communication via computer. Particular emphasis will be placed on several recent federal court decisions that illustrate the problems arising from the current statutory scheme. Lastly, this article will discuss the controversial implementation of the FBI 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 Carnivore 2 ̆ 2 software for the purpose of surreptitiously intercepting email, and the recent deployment of a keystroke-logging device as another means of learning the contents of private electronic communications. This article asserts that the Fourth Amendment protections applicable to telephone conversations set out by Katz v. United States and Berger v. New York (subsequently codified and expanded by the Federal Wiretap Act) should be implemented more broadly to encompass the surreptitious surveillance of postal mail, email, and other promising forms of electronic communication.
