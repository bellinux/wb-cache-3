50|$|All waterjets {{follow the}} same {{principle}} of using high pressure water focused into a beam by a nozzle. Most machines accomplish this by first running the water through a high pressure pump. There {{are two types of}} pumps used to create this high pressure; an intensifier pump and a direct drive or crankshaft pump. A direct drive pump works much like a car engine, forcing water through high <b>pressure</b> <b>tubing</b> using plungers attached to a crankshaft. An intensifier pump creates pressure by using hydraulic oil to move a piston forcing the water through a tiny hole. The water then travels along the high <b>pressure</b> <b>tubing</b> to the nozzle of the waterjet. In the nozzle, the water is focused into a thin beam by a jewel orifice. This beam of water is ejected from the nozzle, cutting through the material by spraying it with the jet of high-speed water. The process is the same for abrasive waterjets until the water reaches the nozzle. Here abrasives such as garnet and aluminium oxide, are fed into the nozzle via an abrasive inlet. The abrasive then mixes with the water in a mixing tube and is forced out the end at high pressure.|$|E

50|$|Rod {{drawing is}} the process that draws the tube with a mandrel inside the tube; the mandrel is drawn with the tube. The {{advantage}} to this process is that the mandrel defines the ID and the surface finish and has a quick setup time for short runs. The disadvantages are that lengths are limited by {{the length of the}} mandrel, usually no more than 100 ft, and that a second operation is required to remove the mandrel, called reeling. This type of process is usually used on heavy walled or small ID tubes.

40|$|A logical {{sequence}} {{for evaluating the}} mechanical properties of N-Reactor <b>pressure</b> <b>tubing</b> in the as-received condition is similar to evaluation after reactor service. The usual difficulties associated with testing a heavy tube to failure with 300 C water are compounded after reactor service by the high gamma radioactivity of the discharged tubes. Success in testing of discharged reactor <b>pressure</b> <b>tubing</b> in a pilot underwater facility led {{to the construction of}} an Irradiated Tube Testing ·Facility (ITTF) adjacent to the Radiometallurgy Building. The ITTF consists of a 10. ft 6 in. deep, water-filled basin 15 ft long by 10 ft wide, with six test chambers placed within the basin. These chambers are stainless steel bell jars that enclose the specimen, blast shielding, and electric furnace. The vessels exclude water from the hot specimen and furnace during testing and contain the pressure surge that occurs when the hot pressurized water flashes to steam upon failure of the test specimen. The ITTF basin is connected to the Radiometallurgy Building Basin by an underwater tube containing a conveyor system. The conveyor makes it possible to transfer highly radioactive materiais with ease and safety. Remote handling tools were developed to measure the tubes, attach end closures, attach thermocouples, and load lhe specimen within the furnace containment vessels...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} work was undertaken {{to extend the}} work of previous researchers and to clarify the influence of both environmental and metallurgical conditions on the corrosion/hydriding behaviour of Zr- 2. 5 Nb nuclear reactor <b>pressure</b> <b>tubing</b> material. The service performance of the pressure tube {{is known to be}} influenced among other things by its metallurgical history and the LiOH content in the aqueous medium. In this study, the in-reactor corrosion/hydriding behavior of <b>pressure</b> <b>tubing</b> material in solutions of different LiOH concentrations (O(deionized water), 1. 2, 4. 8, 10, 25, and 50 g/l) was simulated using stainless steel autoclaves at a temperature of 300 ∘C and ∼ 9. 0 MPa pressure. Four metallurgical conditions were investigated, namely: as currently fabricated (cold-worked 2 ̆ 6 stress relieved), and as-fabricated plus a secondary heat treatment for 24 hours at a temperature of 400, 500, or 560 ∘C. The testing method was an interrupted one and was carried out for exposure times of approximately 200, 500, 2000, and 5000 hours. The degree of corrosion (loss-in-metal-thickness) was determined using metallographic techniques. The amount of hydriding was determined using chemical analysis. Optical microscopy was used to characterize the hydride morphology and distribution. It is shown that for all metallurgical conditions, the presence of LiOH in the aqueous medium causes a 2 ̆ 2 breakaway 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 breakdown 2 ̆ 2 of the initial corrosion/hydriding process (protective kinetics) to occur at an early stage, and linear post-transition stage to occur. In general, an increase in the secondary heat treatment temperature causes a decrease corrosion and hydriding rates, in the post-transitional stage. A heat treatment for 24 hours at 560 ∘C gives the highest corrosion/hydriding resistance, and is therefore recommended for <b>pressure</b> <b>tubing</b> fabricated by the current route. Metallographic studies of hydride morphology and distribution show that the hydride (plates) in the as-received material remain predominantly in the circumferential orientation. Some of the hydride (plates) in the heat-treated material are oriented in a direction at ∼ 45 degrees to both circumferential and radial directions, while the remaining plates remain circumferentially oriented.

5000|$|The pump {{does not}} {{directly}} contact the blood or fluid in the plumbing — it works by applying <b>pressure</b> to the <b>tubing,</b> then moving that pressure point around. Think of a disk with a protrusion in it. Put this into a close fitting 270 degree enclosure. Put plastic tubing between the enclosure and the disk, entering and exiting in the 90 open degrees. Now imagine the disk turning. It will put <b>pressure</b> on the <b>tubing,</b> and the <b>pressure</b> point will roll around through the 270 degrees, forcing the fluid to move (see also Peristaltic pump).

30|$|To kill a live {{closed-in}} {{gas well}} by bull-heading down the tubing, the selected pump rate should be {{high enough to}} ensure efficient displacement of the gas into the formation (i.e. to avoid the kill fluid bypassing the gas). On the other hand, the pressures that develop during bull-heading at a high rate must not exceed wellhead <b>pressure</b> rating, <b>tubing</b> or casing burst pressures or the formation breakdown gradient, since this will lead at best to a very inefficient job. Given these constraints, the optimum kill rate, required hydraulic horsepower, density, and type of kill fluids have to be selected.|$|R

40|$|Direct {{measurement}} of blood pressure using a fluid-filled catheter and an electromechanical transducer is widely accepted in clinical practice. However, errors {{associated with the}} measurement are often not appreciated and these catheter-manometer systems are frequently unable to accurately reproduce applied pressures. To assess the accuracy of catheter-manometer systems used for invasive arterial blood pressure measurements, in vitro and in vivo evaluations were performed. The frequency response (described in terms of damped natural frequency and damping factor) {{for a variety of}} cannulae, <b>pressure</b> <b>tubing</b> and stopcocks (and combinations thereof) and their dependence on various parameters (catheter length, lumen diameter, fluid temperature and catheter material) were measured using an hydraulic pressure generator. The design and construction details of the pressure generator are presented. It was found that the damped natural frequency of the catheter-manometer system is directly proportional to lumen diameter of the pressure tubing/catheter. Furthermore, damping factor is inversely related to the damped natural frequency and stiffer catheter material (for identical radius ratios) results in higher damped natural frequency. Catheter length is inversely related to damped natural frequency and the resonant frequency decreases for an increase in fluid operating temperature. It was established that all catheter-manometer systems tested were under-damped (0. 15 < β < 0. 37) and that the damped natural frequency ranged from 10. 5 Hz for 1500 mm to 27. 0 Hz for <b>pressure</b> <b>tubing</b> of 300 mm in length. Furthermore, catheter-manometer systems which had <b>pressure</b> <b>tubing</b> in excess of 300 mm in length did not comply with the bandwidth requirements for accurate dynamic blood pressure measurement. For the in vivo assessment of the catheter-manometer system, the blood pressure waveform was analysed in the time and frequency domains. It was established that in 60 percent of the cases, the systolic pressure peak was higher when measured by a narrow bandwidth catheter-manometer system compared to that measured by a wide bandwidth system. Furthermore, values of dp/dt maximum were lower for wide bandwidth catheter-manometer systems than those measured by narrow bandwidth systems for heart rates above 90 beats per minute. In the frequency domain analysis, artifact was sometimes found to occur at frequencies higher than the bandwidth of the catheter-manometer system. This high frequency artifact was found to distort the blood pressure waveform and resulted in false high dp/dt and peak systolic pressures...|$|E

Shorter columns could be coupled easily to increase the plate number but for most practical applications the separation efficiency is satis-factory. The column quality is comparable to columns packed by the equal density method but the technique has several advantages, such as shorter packing time (3 columns in 15 minutes compared to about 4 hours with the former technique); absence of toxic halogenated solvents and tedious adjustment of adsorbents.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to {{demonstrate}} that rapid prototyping can be effectively applied for fabricating test models {{to be used in}} aerodynamic experimental investigations. The present work, in particular, concerns a linear cascade of 21 / 2 -D blades, with NACA 65 - 12 (A 10) 10 profile section. Each one of the nine separate (identical) blades of the cascade has been fabricated using a stereolithography rapid prototyping technique.

40|$|Pressure {{distributions}} on {{the wings}} of the F/A- 18 A High Alpha Research Vehicle (HARV) were obtained using both flush-mounted pressure orifices and surface-mounted <b>pressure</b> <b>tubing.</b> During quasi-stabilized 1 -g flight, data were gathered at ranges for angle of attack from 5 deg to 70 deg, for angle of sideslip from - 12 deg to + 12 deg, and for Mach from 0. 23 to 0. 64, at various engine settings, and with and without the leading edge extension fence installed. Angle of attack strongly influenced the wing pressure distribution, as demonstrated by a distinct flow separation pattern that occurred between the range from 15 deg to 30 deg. Influence by the leading edge extension fence was evident on the inboard wing pressure distribution, but little influence was seen on the outboard portion of the wing. Angle-of-sideslip influence on wing pressure distribution was strongest at low angle of attack. Influence of Mach number was observed in the regions of local supersonic flow, diminishing as angle of attack was increased. Engine throttle setting had little influence on the wing pressure distribution...|$|E

40|$|Presented is a {{feasibility}} {{and error}} analysis for a hypersonic flush airdata system on a hypersonic flight experiment (HYFLITE).

Although {{this analysis is}} specifically for the HYFLITE vehicle and trajectory, the problems analyzed are generally applicable to hypersonic vehicles. A layout of the flush-port matrix is shown. Surface pressures are related airdata parameters using a simple aerodynamic model. The model is linearized using small perturbations and inverted using nonlinear least-squares. Effects of various error sources on the overall uncertainty are evaluated using an error simulation.

40|$|Poiseuille’s {{equation}} {{describes the}} relationship between fluid viscosity, <b>pressure,</b> <b>tubing</b> diameter, and flow, yet {{it is not known}} if cold organ perfusion systems follow this equation. We investigated these relationships in an ex vivo model and aimed to offer some rationale for equipment selection. Increasing the cannula size from 14 to 20 [*]Fr increased flow rate by a mean (SD) of 13 (12) %. Marshall’s hyperosmolar citrate was three times less viscous than UW solution, but flows were only 45 % faster. Doubling the bag pressure led to a mean (SD) flow rate increase of only 19 (13) %, not twice the rate. When external pressure devices were used, 100 [*]mmHg of continuous pressure increased flow by a mean (SD) of 43 (17) % when compared to the same pressure applied initially only. Poiseuille’s equation was not followed; this is most likely due to “slipping” of preservation fluid within the plastic tubing. Cannula size made little difference over the ranges examined; flows are primarily determined by bag pressure and fluid viscosity. External infusor devices require continuous pressurisation to deliver high flow. Future studies examining the impact of perfusion variables on graft outcomes should include detailed equipment descriptions...|$|E
40|$|The {{internal}} <b>pressure</b> {{strength of}} <b>tubing</b> and casing often cannot satisfy the design requirements in high pressure, high temperature and high H 2 S gas wells. Also, the practical safety coefficient of some wells {{is lower than}} the design standard according to the current API 5 C 3 standard, which brings some perplexity to the design. The ISO 10400 : 2007 provides the model which can calculate the burst strength of tubing and casing better than API 5 C 3 standard, but the calculation accuracy is not desirable because about 50 percent predictive values are remarkably higher than real burst values. So, for the sake of improving strength design of tubing and casing, this paper deduces the plastic limit <b>pressure</b> of <b>tubing</b> and casing under internal pressure by applying the twin shear unified strength theory. According to the research of the influence rule of yield-to-tensile strength ratio and mechanical properties on the burst strength of tubing and casing, the more precise calculation model of tubing-casing’s burst strength has been established with material hardening and intermediate principal stress. Numerical and experimental comparisons show that the new burst strength model is much closer to the real burst values than that of other models. The research results provide an important reference to optimize the tubing and casing design of deep and ultra-deep wells...|$|R
