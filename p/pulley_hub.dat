2500|$|The wood of Nyssa sylvatica is heavy, hard, cross-grained, and {{difficult}} to split, especially after drying. This resistance to splitting led to its use for making mauls, <b>pulleys,</b> wheel <b>hubs,</b> agricultural rollers, bowls, and paving blocks. [...] The wood is also used for pallets, rough floors, pulpwood, and firewood. Since the wood is very tough, resistant to wear, {{it has been used}} for shuttles in weaving.|$|R
