25|$|Unfortunately, {{when the}} gear was fitted to types {{such as the}} Bristol Scout and the Sopwith 1½ Strutter, which had rotary engines and their forward-firing machine gun {{in front of the}} cockpit, the long <b>push</b> <b>rod</b> linking the gear to the gun had to be mounted at an awkward angle, in which it was liable to {{twisting}} and deformation (not to mention expansion and contraction due to temperature changes). For this reason the B.E.12 and the R.E.8, not to mention Vickers' own FB 19, mounted their forward-firing machine guns on the port side of the fuselage so that a relatively short version of the <b>push</b> <b>rod</b> could be linked directly to the gun.|$|E
25|$|In any case, Warrant Officer F. W. Scarff {{worked with}} Dibovski {{to develop and}} realize the gear, which worked on the {{familiar}} cam and rider principle, the connection to the gun being by the usual <b>push</b> <b>rod</b> and a rather complicated series of levers. It was geared in order to slow the rate that firing impulses were delivered to the gun (and hence improve reliability, although not the rate of fire).|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{reliability}} of aerospace relay directly influences the {{reliability of}} the whole system. The analysis and research on the optimum position of aerospace relay's <b>pushing</b> <b>rod</b> are an important process of aerospace relay reliability design. In the past, most researches were done for electromagnetic systems and spring systems of aerospace relays. However, there was not any research on the position of the <b>pushing</b> <b>rod.</b> An analytical method for the optimum position of aerospace relay's <b>pushing</b> <b>rod</b> is presented in this paper. From four aspects, including the electromagnetic force and torque, work done by the electromagnetic force and displacement, the optimum position of a <b>pushing</b> <b>rod</b> is investigated based on the analysis of a straight spring system. The conclusions can be used to direct the optimum design and assembling of aerospace relays...|$|R

2500|$|The SPAD S.VII was {{designed}} around Marc Birkigt's Hispano-Suiza engine, {{and when the}} new fighter entered service in September 1916 it came armed with a single Vickers gun synchronized with a new gear provided by Birkigt himself for use with his engine. Unlike most other mechanical gears, the [...] "SPAD gear" [...] as it was often called, did without a <b>push</b> <b>rod</b> altogether: the firing impulses being transmitted to the gun torsionally by a moving oscillating shaft, which rotated through {{about a quarter of}} a revolution, alternately clockwise and anticlockwise. This oscillation was more mechanically efficient than the reciprocating motion of a <b>push</b> <b>rod,</b> permitting higher speeds. Officially known as the Systeme de Synchronisation pour Vickers Type II (moteurs fixes) the Birkigt gear was later adapted to control two guns, and remained in use in French service up to the time of the Second World War.|$|E
2500|$|The third {{requirement}} {{is for a}} linkage between the [...] "machines" [...] (engine and gun) to be synchronized. Many early gears used an intricate and inherently fragile bell crank and <b>push</b> <b>rod</b> linkage that could easily jam or otherwise malfunction, especially when required to work at higher speeds {{than it had been}} designed for. There were several alternative methods, including an oscillating rod, a flexible drive, a column of hydraulic fluid, a cable, or an electrical connection.|$|E
2500|$|The first French {{synchronizer}} {{was developed}} by Sergeant-Mecanicien Robert Alkan and l'Ingenieur du Maritime Hamy. It was based closely on the definitive Fokker Stangensteuerung gear: the main difference being that the <b>push</b> <b>rod</b> was installed within the Vickers gun, using a redundant steam tube in the cooling jacket. This mitigated a major drawback of other <b>push</b> <b>rod</b> gears in that the rod, being supported for its whole length, was much less liable to distortion or breakage. Vickers guns modified to take this gear can be distinguished by the housing for the push rod's spring, projecting {{from the front of}} the gun like a second barrel. This gear was first installed and air-tested in a Nieuport 12, on 2 May 1916, and other pre-production gears were fitted to contemporary Morane-Saulnier and Nieuport fighters. The Alkan-Hamy gear was standardised as the Systeme de Synchronisation pour Vickers Type I (moteurs rotatifs), becoming available in numbers in time for the arrival of the Nieuport 17 at the front in mid 1916, and synchronizing the forward-firing guns of all rotary-engined French aircraft. The exception was the Nieuport 28, which used a different gear – now known only through American documentation, where it is described as the [...] "Nieuport Synchronizing gear" [...] or the [...] "Gnome gear". A spinning drive shaft, driven by the rotating crankcase of the Nieuport's 160 CV Gnome 9N Monosoupape rotary engine, drove two separately adjustible trigger motors – each imparting firing impulses to its gun by means of its own short rod.|$|E

5000|$|As {{with the}} 265- and 283-cubic-inch [...] "Small Block" [...] engines, the W-series valve gear {{consisted}} of tubular steel <b>push</b> <b>rods</b> operating stud-mounted, stamped-steel rocker arms. The <b>push</b> <b>rods</b> also acted as conduits for oil {{flow to the}} valve gear. Due to the relatively low mass of the valve train, mechanical lifter versions of the W-series engine were capable of operating at speeds well beyond 6000 (RPM).|$|R

2500|$|Ducati {{has also}} {{manufactured}} engines with one, two, {{three or four}} cylinders; operated by pull rod valves and <b>push</b> <b>rod</b> valves; single, double and triple overhead camshafts; two-stroke and even at one stage manufactured small diesel engines, {{many of which were}} used to power boats, generators, garden machinery and emergency pumps (for example, for fire fighting). The engines were the IS series from [...] air-cooled and the larger twin DM series water- and air-cooled. The engines have been found {{in all parts of the}} globe. Wisconsin Diesel even assembled and [...] "badge engineered" [...] the engines in the USA. They have also produced outboard motors for marine use. Currently, Ducati makes no other engines except for its motorcycles.|$|E
2500|$|The gear {{used in the}} {{production}} Eindecker fighters (see diagram) replaced the oil pump's mechanical driveshaft-based system with a large cam wheel, almost a light flywheel, driven directly from the spinning rotary engine's crankcase itself. The <b>push</b> <b>rod</b> now took its reciprocating motion directly from a [...] "follower" [...] on this cam wheel. At {{the same time the}} machine gun used was also changed: an lMG 08 machine gun (the so-called [...] "Spandau") replacing the Parabellum used with the prototype gear. At this time the Parabellum was still in very short supply, and all available examples were required as observers' guns, the lighter and handier weapon being far superior in this role.|$|E
2500|$|The Fokker company {{produced}} the [...] (<b>push</b> <b>rod</b> controller), a genuine synchronisation gear. Impulses from a cam {{driven by the}} engine controlled the firing of the machine-gun so it could fire forwards without damaging the propeller. Unlike earlier proposed gears the [...] was fitted to an aircraft and proved in flight. In a postwar biography, Fokker claimed that he designed and built the gear in 48hours but this has been largely discounted. It is believed that the gear may {{have been based on}} a pre-war patent by Franz Schneider, a Swiss engineer who had worked for Nieuport and the German LVG company; the gear was probably designed by Heinrich Lübbe, a Fokker Flugzeugbau engineer.|$|E

2500|$|The Marlin, being a gas {{operated}} gun, proved less amenable to synchronization than the Vickers. It {{was found that}} [...] "rogue" [...] shots occasionally pierced the propeller, even when the gear was properly adjusted and otherwise functioning well. The problem was eventually resolved by modifications to the Marlin's trigger mechanism, {{but in the meantime}} the engineer Adolph L. Nelson, at the Airplane Engineering Department at McCook Field had developed a new, mechanical gear especially adapted to the Marlin, officially known as the Nelson single shot synchronizer. [...] In place of the <b>push</b> <b>rod</b> common to many mechanical gears, or the [...] "pull rod" [...] of the Sopwith-Kauper, the Nelson gear used a cable held in tension for the transmission of firing impulses to the gun.|$|E
2500|$|Mechanical {{efficiency}} was {{improved by}} reversing {{the action of}} the <b>push</b> <b>rod.</b> The firing impulse was generated at a low point of the cam instead of at the lobe of the cam as in Saulnier's patent. Thus the force on the rod was exerted by tension rather than compression, (or in less technical language, the trigger motor worked by being [...] "pulled" [...] rather than [...] "pushed") which enabled the rod to be lighter, minimising its inertia so that it could operate faster (at least in early versions of the gear, each revolution of the cam wheel produced two firing impulses instead of one). A single firing lever engaged the gear and fired the gun in one action, rather than the gear having to be [...] "turned on" [...] and then fired, as with some earlier gears.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most common}} cause of {{maintenance}} headaches and catastrophic failures were the engines. Although the Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone radial engines later became a trustworthy workhorse in large piston-engined aircraft, early models were beset with dangerous reliability problems. This problem was not fully cured until the aircraft was fitted with the more powerful Pratt & Whitney R-4360 [...] "Wasp Major" [...] in the B-29D/B-50 program, which arrived too late for World War II. Interim measures included cuffs placed on propeller blades to divert a greater flow of cooling air into the intakes which had baffles installed to direct a stream of air onto the exhaust valves. Oil flow to the valves was also increased, asbestos baffles installed around rubber <b>push</b> <b>rod</b> fittings to prevent oil loss, thorough pre-flight inspections made to detect unseated valves, and frequent replacement of the uppermost five cylinders (every 25 hours of engine time) and the entire engines (every 75 hours).|$|E

2500|$|Whatever its {{ultimate}} source, the initial {{version of the}} Fokker synchronization gear (see illustration) very closely followed, not Schneider's patent, as claimed by many (including Schneider himself) but Saulnier's. Like the Saulnier patent, Fokker's gear was designed to actively fire the gun rather than interrupt it, and (like the later Vickers-Challenger gear developed for the RFC) it followed Saulnier in taking its primary mechanical drive from the oil pump of a rotary engine. [...] The [...] "transmission" [...] between the motor and the gun was by a version of Saulnier's reciprocating push-rod. The main difference was that instead of the <b>push</b> <b>rod</b> passing directly from the engine to the gun, which would have required a tunnel through the firewall and fuel tank (as shown in the Saulnier patent drawings), it was driven by a shaft joining the oil pump to a small cam {{at the top of}} the fuselage. This eventually proved unsatisfactory, as the oil pump's mechanical drive spindle was insufficiently robust to take the extra load.|$|E
