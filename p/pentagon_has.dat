25|$|The {{most common}} and {{symmetric}} plane drawing of the Petersen graph, as a pentagram within a <b>pentagon,</b> <b>has</b> five crossings. However, {{this is not the}} best drawing for minimizing crossings; there exists another drawing (shown in the figure) with only two crossings. Thus, the Petersen graph has crossing number 2. Each edge in this drawing is crossed at most once, so the Petersen graph is 1-planar. On a torus the Petersen graph can be drawn without edge crossings; it therefore has orientable genus 1.|$|E
25|$|The United States Geological Survey is {{actively}} surveying southern Afghanistan for rare-earth deposits {{under the protection}} of United States military forces. Since 2009 the USGS has conducted remote sensing surveys as well as fieldwork to verify Soviet claims that volcanic rocks containing rare-earth metals exist in Helmand province near the village of Khanneshin. The USGS study team has located a sizable area of rocks in the center of an extinct volcano containing light rare-earth elements including cerium and neodymium. It has mapped 1.3 million metric tons of desirable rock, or about 10 years of supply at current demand levels. The <b>Pentagon</b> <b>has</b> estimated its value at about $7.4 billion.|$|E

50|$|The convex <b>pentagons</b> <b>have</b> all {{of their}} five angles smaller than 180° and no sides {{intersecting}} others. A common example {{of this type of}} pentagon is the regular pentagon.|$|R
25|$|On 16 October 2016, the New York Times {{reported}} that American {{officials said the}} White House had quietly broadened the president’s authority {{for the use of}} force in Somalia by allowing airstrikes to protect American and African troops as they combat fighters from al-Shabaab. About 200 to 300 American Special Operations troops work with soldiers from Somalia and other African nations like Kenya and Uganda to carry out more than a half-dozen raids per month, according to senior American military officials. The operations are a combination of ground raids and drone strikes. SEAL Team 6 has been heavily involved in many of these operations. American military officials said once ground operations are complete, American troops working with Somali forces often interrogate prisoners at temporary screening facilities, including one in Puntland, before the detainees are transferred to more permanent Somali-run prisons. The <b>Pentagon</b> <b>has</b> only acknowledged a small fraction of these operations, announcing 13 ground raids and airstrikes so far in 2016 (3 of which took place in September) — up from 5 in 2015; according to data compiled by New America (a Washington Think tank) the strikes have killed about 25 civilians and 200 people suspected of being militants. At a former Russian fighter jet base in Baledogle, U.S. Marines and private contractors are working to build up a Somali military unit designed to combat Al-Shabaab throughout the country.|$|E

25|$|On 19 December 1989, just 13 {{months after}} the <b>Pentagon</b> <b>had</b> {{disclosed}} {{the existence of the}} F-117A, it was used in combat for the first time. This was in Operation Just Cause, the invasion of Panama intended to dislodge and arrest General Manuel Noreiga.|$|R
2500|$|... "Yet the General {{claims a}} {{reduction}} in violence. That’s because, according to the New York Times, the <b>Pentagon</b> <b>has</b> adopted a bizarre formula for keeping tabs on violence. For example, deaths by car bombs don’t count." ...|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Pentagon</b> <b>has</b> also {{proposed}} to provide to Lebanon {{a contract for}} 10 EMB-314s. Six Tucanos with 2,000 advanced precision-kill weapon systems are going to Lebanon in 2015 via the US LAS program, but financed by Saudi Arabia at [...] million.|$|E

50|$|The {{full-scale}} renovation became {{necessary because}} by the mid-1990s, the <b>Pentagon</b> <b>had</b> never undergone a major renovation, and building systems had deteriorated beyond repair, requiring complete replacement. Additionally, the presence of asbestos-containing materials throughout the building made any repairs or other work to the building highly disruptive.|$|R

Having a length of [...] and design speed of , it does not carry a payload. The company received $60 million from the U.S. Department of Defense to develop the concept, resulting in a prototype named Dragon Dream which underwent systems tests and some tethered flights in late 2013. The first floating took place on January 3, 2013 at the hangar at the former Marine Corps Air Station in Tustin {{in which it was}} constructed, where it hovered indoors at a height of 12 feet for several minutes. The <b>Pentagon</b> <b>has</b> declared that the tests of the Dragon Dream were a [...] "success", with the craft meeting its demonstration objectives. The airship was rolled out of its hangar on July 4, 2013 and performed its first flight on September 11.

On 10 August, Russia claimed two servicemen were killed in clashes with Ukrainian commandos, and that Ukrainian servicemen had been captured {{with a total of}} 40kg of explosives in their possession. Ukraine denied that the incident took place. Russian accounts claimed that Russian FSB detained [...] "Ukrainian saboteurs" [...] and [...] "terrorists" [...] near Armyansk. The ensuing gunfight left one FSB officer and a suspect dead. A number of individuals were detained, including Yevhen Panov, who is described by Russian sources as a Ukrainian military intelligence officer and leader of the sabotage group. The group was allegedly planning terror attacks on important infrastructure in Armyansk, Crimea. Ukrainian media {{reported that}} Panov was a military volunteer fighting in the east of the country, however he has more recently been associated with a charitable organization. Russia also claimed that the alleged border infiltration was accompanied by [...] "heavy fire" [...] from Ukrainian territory, resulting in the death of a Russian soldier.
