Folds are commonly formed by shortening of existing layers, but may also be formed as a result of displacement on a non-planar fault (fault bend fold), at the tip of a propagating fault (fault propagation fold), by differential compaction or due to the effects of a high-level igneous intrusion e.g. above a laccolith.|$|E
25|$|According to the post-slide report {{released}} by Multiconsult and reviewed by NTNU, several potential indirect causes 'should be discussed': First of all, starting {{weeks before the}} slide, Western Norway was subjected to record-breaking precipitation and winds, which increased in strength when the remains of Hurricane Maria reached shore. The rainstorm, named Kristin by meteorologists, caused floods, traffic jams, material damage and power outages. The precipitation gradually increased <b>pore</b> <b>pressure</b> between the mountain and loose masses, adding to the damage of a process of erosion from surface water. This process may have been further hastened by the possible breach of a water pipe, indicated by a housing unit losing its water supply at around 17 o'clock the day previous to the slide. Also, what {{may have contributed to}} the incident was as a garage that was constructed in the neighbourhood on a fill-in site.|$|E

25|$|The {{slope of}} the inner trench slope of an accretionary {{convergent}} margin reflects continuous adjustments to the thickness and width of the accretionary prism. The prism maintains a ‘critical taper’, established in conformance with Mohr–Coulomb theory, with slope determined by the material properties of the sediments. A package of sediments scraped off the downgoing lithospheric plate deforms until it and the accretionary prism {{that it has been}} added to attain the maximum slope supported by the sediments. Once this critical taper is attained, the wedge slides stably along its basal décollement. Strain rate and hydrologic properties also influence the strength of the accretionary prism and the angle of critical taper. Fluid pore pressures modify rock strength. Low permeability and rapid convergence may result in pore pressures that exceed lithostatic pressure and thus a relatively weak accretionary prism with a shallowly tapered geometry, whereas high permeability and slow convergence result in lower <b>pore</b> <b>pressure,</b> stronger prisms, and steeper geometry.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: In shield {{tunnelling}} {{in loose}} and water bearing soils, a bentonite slurry {{is often used}} to help support the tunnel face. During excavation, the bentonite cake, which is intended to seal the face, is removed by the cutter bits and subsequently slurry will infiltrate the soil. This infiltration causes excess <b>pore</b> <b>pressures</b> in front of the TBM, which lower the stability of the face. The effect has been investigated using a stationary model as well as with a time-dependent groundwater flow model, linked to a limit equilibrium face stability model. This model can be used to predict the minimal required support pressure and also the build-up of excess <b>pore</b> <b>pressures</b> in front of the TBM over time.
