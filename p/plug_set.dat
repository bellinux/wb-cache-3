5000|$|Deepwater Horizon was a {{floating}} semi-submersible drilling unit — a fifth-generation, ultra-deepwater, dynamically positioned, column-stabilized drilling rig owned by Transocean and built in South Korea. The platform was 396 ft long and 256 ft wide and could operate in waters up to 8000 ft deep, {{to a maximum}} drill depth of 30000 ft. Press releases from Transocean state the platform had historically been used for deeper wells, including the deepest underwater gas and oil well in history at 35055 ft in 2009. [...] The $560 million platform was built by Hyundai Heavy Industries in South Korea and completed in 2001. It was owned by Transocean, operated under the Marshalese flag of convenience, and was under lease to BP until September 2013. At {{the time of the}} explosion, the Deepwater Horizon was on Mississippi Canyon Block 252, referred to as the Macondo Prospect, in the United States sector of the Gulf of Mexico, about 41 mi off the Louisiana coast. In March 2008, the mineral rights to drill for oil on the Macondo Prospect were purchased by BP at the Minerals Management Service's lease sale. The platform commenced drilling in February 2010 at a water depth of approximately 5000 ft. At the time of the explosion the rig was drilling an exploratory well. [...] The planned well was to be drilled to 18360 ft below sea level, and was to be plugged and suspended for subsequent completion as a subsea producer.

25|$|The relay's {{primary winding}} is {{supplied}} {{from the power}} systems current transformer via a plug bridge, which is called the <b>plug</b> <b>setting</b> multiplier (psm). Usually seven equally spaced tappings or operating bands determine the relays sensitivity. The primary winding {{is located on the}} upper electromagnet. The secondary winding has connections on the upper electromagnet that are energised from the primary winding and connected to the lower electromagnet. Once the upper and lower electromagnets are energised they produce eddy currents that are induced onto the metal disc and flow through the flux paths. This relationship of eddy currents and fluxes creates torque proportional to the input current of the primary winding, due to the two flux paths being out of phase by 90°.|$|R
40|$|The Valhall {{field is}} the largest field that BP {{operates}} on the Norwegian Continental Shelf, {{and is one of}} the most well known high porosity chalk fields in the Southern part of the North Sea. During many years of oil production, there has been compaction of the reservoir. The current casing design at Valhall has developed with time as the field has matured, and is affected by several considerations like casing shear in the overburden due to subsidence, non-uniform loading in the reservoir due to chalk production and compaction. The main objective of this thesis was to develop options that could be included in the current casing design, to guarantee a higher injection pressure than is available today at the Valhall field. The current design is limiting the maximum injection pressure in the water injectors, and the main factor is the use of 95 / 8 ” drilling liner combined with a cement squeeze job through a C-Flex port collar. This cement job is not approved as a barrier element as required by NORSOK. The injection pressure is today limited by the strength of the 133 / 8 ” casing shoe, which is lower than desired. The study involves reviewing BP’s casing design manual, the current casing design on Valhall, the special requirements for Valhall, and investigating several technologies that could provide potential solutions to the barrier challenges on Valhall. The recommended option is to include the External Sleeve Inflatable Packer Collar (ESIPC), Cement Assurance Tool and the C-Flex in the 95 / 8 ” drilling liner. The ESIPC would provide a good cement job in the liner annulus, as it would enable returns to be observed during the cement job, providing evidence that there is a cement column behind the drilling liner by a cement bond log. The C-Flex is included to make it possible to perform a cement squeeze job through the C-Flex additionally to the ESIPC or in worst case alone if the ESIPC fails. The Cement Assurance Tool is just an extra safety in case the cement around the liner would contract and make a micro-annulus, which could create a possible leak. This option would most likely provide a barrier element according to NORSOK. This barrier element is very important to be able to increase the injection pressure at a wanted level, which is approximately 6, 300 psi. At present time, the ESIPC is not strong enough to be included in a drilling liner. It has to be reinforced and tested before it could be included in the drilling liner to be able to withstand the large forces acting on the tool. The corresponding dual bottom-top wiper <b>plug</b> <b>set</b> has to be reinforced as well, because the <b>plug</b> <b>set</b> would be exposed to large forces during the losses, and when it is set inside the ESIPC...|$|E
5000|$|Setting {{tools are}} used to set {{downhole}} completion elements such as production packers or bridge <b>plugs.</b> <b>Setting</b> tools typically use the expanding gas energy from a slow burning explosive charge to drive a hydraulic piston assembly. The assembly {{is attached to the}} plug or packer by means of a setting mandrel and a sliding sleeve, which when [...] "stroked" [...] by the piston assembly, effectively squeezes the elastomer elements of the packing element, deforming it sufficiently to wedge it into place in the tubing or casing string. Most completion packers or plugs have a specially designed shear mechanism which release the setting tool from the element allowing it to be retrieved back to surface. The packer/plug however, remains down hole as a barrier to isolate production zones or permanently plug off a well bore.|$|R

This paper proposes {{a new technique}} for set-ting all Over Current (OC) relays in substations, process industries with cogeneration and distribution system with Embedded Renewable Generation. This technique is more suitable {{where there is a}} drastic change in the fault current based on the network topology and configuration.

40|$|In power systems, {{determining}} {{the values of}} time dial setting (TDS) and the <b>plug</b> <b>setting</b> (PS) for directional overcurrent relays (DOCRs) is an extremely constrained optimization problem that has been previously described and solved as a nonlinear programming problem. Optimization coordination problems of near-end faults and far-end faults occurring simultaneously in circuits with various topologies, including fixed and variable network topologies, are considered in this study. The {{aim of this study}} was to apply the Nelder-Mead (NM) simplex search method and particle swarm optimization (PSO) to solve this optimization problem. The proposed NM-PSO method has the advantage of NM algorithm, with a quicker movement toward optimal solution, as well as the advantage of PSO algorithm in the ability to obtain globally optimal solution. Neither a conventional PSO nor the proposed NM-PSO method is capable of dealing with constrained optimization problems. Therefore, we use the gradient-based repair method embedded in a conventional PSO and the proposed NM-PSO. This study used an IEEE 8 -bus test system as a case study to compare the convergence performance of the proposed NM-PSO method and a conventional PSO approach.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a new hybrid global optimization algorithm based on Chemical Reaction based Optimization (CRO) and Di¤erential evolution (DE) algorithm for nonlinear constrained optimization problems. This approach {{proposed for the}} optimal coordination and setting relays of directional overcurrent relays in complex power systems. In protection coordination problem, the objective function to be minimized {{is the sum of}} the operating time of all main relays. The optimization problem is subject to a number of constraints which are mainly focused on the operation of the backup relay, which should operate if a primary relay fails to respond to the fault near to it, Time Dial <b>Setting</b> (TDS), <b>Plug</b> <b>Setting</b> (PS) and the minimum operating time of a relay.
