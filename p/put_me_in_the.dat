500|$|Douglas was {{inducted}} into the National Wildlife Federation Hall of Fame in 1999, and the National Women's Hall of Fame in 2000. John Rothchild declared her a feminist before the word existed, but not entirely. Upon hearing that she was to be inducted, she questioned, [...] "Why should they have a Women's Hall of Fame, as I heard they wanted to <b>put</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> other day? Why not a Citizen's Hall of Fame?" [...] Douglas was included in a tribute to pioneering women when television character Lisa Simpson made a papier-mâché bust of her with Georgia O'Keeffe and Susan B. Anthony in an early episode of The Simpsons.|$|E
500|$|Stein {{says he got}} {{the role}} of Bueller's Economics teacher through six degrees of separation. [...] "Richard Nixon {{introduced}} me to a man named Bill Safire, who's a New York Times columnist. He introduced me to a guy who's an executive at Warner Brothers. He introduced me to a guy who's a casting director. He introduced me to John Hughes. John Hughes and I are among the only Republicans in the picture business, and John Hughes <b>put</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> movie", Stein said. Hughes said that Stein was an easy and early choice {{for the role of}} the teacher: [...] "He wasn't a professional actor. He had a flat voice, he looked like a teacher." ...|$|E
500|$|While Gardner {{intermittently}} {{continued to}} go to the industrial school, he met Debra Bischoff at a Salt Lake City apartment complex where his mother lived. Bischoff described him as: [...] "Very caring. He never <b>put</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rough situations he was in throughout his life. He sheltered me from that stuff." [...] Gardner had a daughter in May 1977 and a son in February 1980 with Bischoff, but was convicted of robbery and sent to Utah State Prison in the same month his son was born. Gardner successfully escaped the prison's maximum security unit on April 19, 1981, and was shot in the neck while attempting to kill a man who he believed had raped Bischoff. In February 1983, he was identified as a ringleader in a disturbance in which inmates barricaded a cell block and started fires.|$|E

5000|$|Over the drum-heavy sample, Lamar and Bobby Ray join T.I. {{in sharing}} some nostalgic stories, {{which he says}} reminds him of some of a few renowned MCs and their classic projects: [...] "We're taking turns on our story about a female that we knew years, years, years ago before we were who we are today. It kinda <b>puts</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mind of the 'Da Art of Storytellin' The Art of Storytelling from Outkast and Slick Rick. It <b>puts</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mind of that." [...] The song {{failed to make the}} album's final track listing {{probably}} due to sample clearances. On December 17, 2012 T.I. stopped by Sway Calloway's Sway <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Morning radio show to promote the album, while there he premiered [...] "Memories Back Then".|$|R
500|$|Priyanka Chopra {{was cast}} as series protagonist Alex Parrish, {{the result of}} a talent holding deal with ABC Studios which {{required}} the company to develop a starring project for her or cast her in an existing project for the 2015 television season. ABC casting executive Keli Lee had long tried to persuade Chopra to perform on television in the United States. When the actress began considering U.S. TV, Lee learned that Chopra had been approached by another studio: [...] "I said , 'No, you can't make this deal elsewhere. You're coming here. And I'm flying to India. Lee went to India and convinced Chopra to accept ABC's offer. The actress said about Lee: [...] "I told her, the only way I would do it is if you find me a show and a path which first will <b>put</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same position that I am in India".|$|E
500|$|Abrams {{contacted}} Pegg by e-mail, {{offering him}} the part. To achieve Scotty's accent, Pegg was assisted {{by his wife}} Maureen, who is from Glasgow, although Pegg said that Scotty was from Linlithgow and that he therefore wanted his accent to sound more East Coast Scottish. As a result, the accent he used {{is a mixture of}} both, although it leans more towards the West sound. He was also aided by James Doohan's son, Chris, and Tommy Gormley, the film's Glaswegian first assistant director. Pegg described Scotty as a positive Scottish stereotype, noting [...] "Scots are the first people to laugh at the fact that they drink and fight a bit", and that Scotty comes {{from a long line of}} Scots with technical expertise, such as John Logie Baird and Alexander Graham Bell. Years before, Pegg's character on Spaced joked that every odd-numbered Star Trek film being [...] "shit" [...] was a fact of life. Pegg noted [...] "Fate <b>put</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> movie to show me I was talking out of my ass." ...|$|E
500|$|The fight scene between Jack and Ethan was {{performed}} by the actors themselves. The two were given the freedom to set up how their characters would fight each other. However, stunt coordinator Michael Vendrell wanted Ethan to be [...] "as feral as possible; no school of combat, karate, kung-fu." [...] Before filming the scene where Jack finds Charlie, episode director Stephen Williams scouted for a suitable location and found [...] "what looked like a cathedral," [...] because of the layout of trees behind where Charlie was hung. Monaghan had to be harnessed to a cable for roughly four to five hours. The actor described the scene; [...] "they <b>put</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tree and I just hung there. I just hung limp. I tried to fall asleep, I tried to relax. When everything was going on, when they cut me down from the tree, when [...] was trying to revive me, when [...] was crying, I really didn't hear any of it. I just was in a semi-meditative state; however close that I could get with someone smacking me in the chest.|$|E

500|$|Bondfield {{joined a}} drapery and {{embroidery}} business in Church Road, Hove, where the young apprentices {{were treated as}} family members. Relations between customers and assistants were cordial, and Bondfield's later recollections of this period were uniformly happy. Her apprenticeship complete, {{she worked as a}} living-in assistant in a succession of Brighton drapery stores, where she quickly encountered the realities of shop staff life: unsympathetic employers, very long hours, appalling living conditions and no privacy. Bondfield reported on her experiences of living-in: [...] "Overcrowded, insanitary conditions, poor and insufficient food were the main characteristics of this system, with an undertone of danger... In some houses both natural and unnatural vices found a breeding ground". She found some relief from this environment when she was befriended by a wealthy customer, Louisa Martindale, and her daughter Hilda. The Martindales, socially conscious liberals and advocates for women's rights, found Bondfield a willing learner, and lent her books that began her lifelong interest in labour and social questions. Bondfield described Mrs Martindale as [...] "a most vivid influence on my life... she <b>put</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> way of knowledge that has been of help to many score of my shop mates".|$|E
500|$|While {{in prison}} LaRouche {{released}} {{claims that he}} was tortured {{as part of an}} assassination attempt. LaRouche ran two political campaigns from prison: for Virginia's 10th Congressional District in 1990 and for U.S. President in 1992. One of his cellmates during his incarceration at the Federal Medical Center, Rochester in Minnesota was televangelist Jim Bakker. Bakker later devoted a chapter of his book, I Was Wrong, to his experience with LaRouche. Bakker described his astonishment at LaRouche's detailed knowledge of the Bible. According to Bakker, LaRouche received a daily briefing each morning by phone, often in German, and {{on more than one occasion}} LaRouche had information days before it was reported on the network news. Bakker also wrote that his cellmate was convinced that their cell was bugged. In Bakker's view, [...] "to say LaRouche was a little paranoid would be like saying that the Titanic had a little leak." [...] LaRouche also befriended Richard Miller, a former FBI agent and fellow inmate who was imprisoned on espionage charges. LaRouche was paroled in 1994 after serving five years of the 15-year sentence, the normal schedule for parole at that time. LaRouche commented later that [...] "...in effect, George H. W. Bush <b>put</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> jug, and Bill Clinton got me out".|$|E
2500|$|After Christopher had {{performed}} this service for some time, {{a little child}} asked him to take him across the river. During the crossing, the river became swollen and the child seemed as heavy as lead, so much that Christopher could scarcely carry him and found himself in great difficulty. When he finally reached the other side, {{he said to the}} child: [...] "You have <b>put</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> greatest danger. I do not think the whole world could have been as heavy on my shoulders as you were." [...] The child replied: [...] "You had on your shoulders not only the whole world but Him who made it. I am Christ your king, whom you are serving by this work." [...] The child then vanished.|$|E
6000|$|Now, Goodloe Banks had {{a sarcastic}} way of {{displaying}} his own learning and <b>putting</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> class that was reading [...] "Poor Jane Ray, her bird is dead, she cannot play." [...] Well, I rather liked Goodloe, and I had a contempt for his college learning, and I was always regarded as good-natured, so I kept my temper. And I {{was trying to}} find out if he knew anything about May Martha, so I endured his society.|$|R
6000|$|Cargill took an easy position. [...] "I don't {{know why}} I have sized you up as {{literary}} in general effect, but I have. That's {{one reason why}} I took to you. It's so damned unusual to find a politician that has a single idea above votes. And then I'm literary myself," [...] he said, his face a mask of impenetrable gravity.

2500|$|In his 2005 {{autobiography}} Heartbreak and Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story, Michaels {{stated that}} it was Triple H's idea, while the sharpshooter spot had been suggested by Hart. [...] "We were talking things through, and Bret {{came up with this}} spot where I get him in the Sharpshooter and then he reverses it by pulling on my leg". Indirectly corroborating this assertion is Hart's own testimony in his autobiography Hitman, that [...] "Pat Patterson told me that {{he thought it would be}} a heckuva spot to let Shawn <b>put</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Sharpshooter and then reverse it on him," [...] which would indicate that Patterson had initially proposed the [...] "Sharpshooter" [...] spot to Bret. However, in the same work, Hart also states, [...] "I found myself jostling with Jerry Brisco, who I would find out later was the one who had designed the whole Screwjob for Vince." ...|$|E
2500|$|Once {{signed to}} Capitol Records, Hammer re-issued his first record (a {{revised version of}} Feel My Power) with {{additional}} tracks added and sold over 2 million copies. [...] "Pump It Up" [...] (also performed during Showtime at the Apollo on September 16, 1989), [...] "Turn This Mutha Out", [...] "Let's Get It Started" [...] and [...] "They <b>Put</b> <b>Me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Mix" [...] were the most popular singles from this album which all charted. But not quite satisfied with this first multi-platinum success, Hammer's music underwent a metamorphosis, shifting from the standard rap format in his upcoming album. [...] "I decided the next album would be more musical," [...] he says. Purists chastised him for being more dancer than rapper. Sitting in a leopard-print bodysuit before a concert, he defended his style: [...] "People were ready for something different from the traditional rap style. The fact that the record has reached this level indicates the genre is growing." ...|$|E
2500|$|On December 1, 1910, Wedge {{was arrested}} and incarcerated in the city jail on charges of battery for {{attempting}} to strike a night watchman named Gus Miller and begging after being found on Fifth Street near Market Street at 4.30am. Wedge denied the allegations and explained his alcoholic odor as due to his incarceration with drunks and [...] "wine bums", and that he possessed port wine {{given to him by}} the Hahnemann Hospital to prevent pneumonia. Wedge was given the sobriquet [...] "The Fighting Parson of the Barbary Coast". In 1917 Wedge explained its origin: [...] "I was preaching on a beer keg in a saloon on the Barbary coast in San Francisco when a couple of toughs went for me. I guess maybe I cleaned out the place then. A reporter on the San Francisco newspaper gave me the name. He said I was a fellow who, if he could not preach good into men, would knock h—l out of them. Those fellows got me, though, and <b>put</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hospital for a while". After being hospitalized after a vicious assault by several denizens of the Barbary Coast at the corner of Pacific and Montgomery avenues, by the end of 1910 Wedge decided to return to Omaha to recuperate and to attempt to reconcile with Prudence Tracy.|$|E
5|$|The overall {{theme of}} <b>the</b> song <b>puts</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{mind of a}} hit from R group Bell Biv Devoe circa 1990 that was also titled Poison, but doesn't fair the {{potential}} to be a number one song like it did close to 20 years ago. Even though the song doesn't seem like it would be a chart topper it does seem album worthy. It's something most can relate to if you've ever been in a relationship. Beyonce sings about a failed relationship that's no good, but yet is so hard to walk away from and ends up being just like Poison.|$|R

2500|$|On October 19, 2012, in an interview, West Coast rapper Kendrick Lamar {{revealed}} that he recorded a song with T.I. for the album.

[...] T.I. also chose the record for its crossover ability, which he has always been successful with <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past: [...] "It sounds like hip-hop with an international twist to it, and I'm known for taking those types of records and bridging that gap between what we do and what they do," [...] he explained, dropping in a couple of examples.
