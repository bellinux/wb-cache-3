40|$|Abstract. In {{this article}} we study the {{reclamation}} technology of alkaline <b>phenol</b> <b>formaldehyde</b> <b>resin</b> bonded sand. We find {{that there are a}} lot of evaporation components in the alkaline <b>phenol</b> <b>formaldehyde</b> <b>resin</b> bonded sand, and they can be effectively removed by drying or baking. The loss of ignition of the sand before and after the mechanical regeneration can be reduced by the baking of alkaline <b>phenol</b> <b>formaldehyde</b> <b>resin</b> bonded sand; it also can improve the stripping rate of the reclaimed sand. The acid demand value of the reclaimed sand increases with the increasing of temperature and reaches the maximum at 500 °C, when the alkaline <b>phenol</b> <b>formaldehyde</b> <b>resin</b> bonded sand is baked below 500 °C, and then the acid demand value of the regenerated sand reduces when the baking temperature increases.

This research work examined the optimization of synthesis parameters including percent substitution of phenol with lignin, formaldehyde- to-phenol ratio (F/P), and Mw of lignin to reduce the curing temperature and increase the adhesive strength of LPF. DSC analysis indicated that lignin with Mw ~ 1200 g/mol resulted in lowest curing temperature for 75 %-LPF while requiring F/P of less than 3. Highest adhesive strength of ~ 9 MPa was attained for 50 %-LPF synthesized with F/P of 3 and lignin with high Mw.

40|$|Nowadays pulps for the {{industrial}} manufacture of medium density fibre boards (MDF) are prepared {{by using the}} thermo-mechanical technique. Thermo-mechanical pulps (TMP) are mostly bonded with acid curing urea formaldehyde resins (UF-resins) and melamine modified urea formaldehyde resins (MUF-resins). During thermo-mechanical pulping wood is degraded by hydro-thermal treatment leading to formation of different chemical compounds. Evidence has been adduced that degradation products have a negative bearing on the bondability of the fibres with binders such as alkaline curing <b>phenol</b> <b>formaldehyde</b> <b>resins</b> (PF-resins) or polymers based on 4, 4 ´-diphenylmethandiisocyanat (PMDI) for making moisture resistant bonded boards.

40|$|Besides polyurethanes and polyesters, {{phenolic}} and {{epoxy resins}} {{are the most}} prominent applications for technical lignins in thermosetting materials. To evaluate the potential application of lignin raw materials in phenol formaldehyde and epoxy resins, three types of alkaline lignins were characterized {{in terms of their}} structures and thermal properties. The lignin samples analyzed were kraft lignin (LIG- 1), soda–rice straw lignin (LIG- 2), and soda-wheat straw lignin (LIG- 3). FTIR and 1 H-NMR methods were used to determine their structure. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) was used to determine the molecular weight distribution (MWD). Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to measure the glass transition temperature (Tg), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) to determine the thermal stability of lignin samples.

Resins have been prepared utilising either the whole liquid product, or a phenolics enriched fraction obtained after fractional condensation or further processing, such as solvent extraction. None of the phenolics production and fractionation techniques covered in this review are believed to allow substitution of 100 % of the phenol content of the resin without impacting its effectiveness compared to commercial formulations based on petroleum derived phenol. This survey shows that considerable progress has been made towards reaching the goal of a price competitive renewable resin, but that further research is required to meet the twin challenges of low renewable resin cost and satisfactory quality requirements.
