30|$|Seawater systems (i.e. pipelines, elbows) {{are used}} by many industries, such as onshore/offshore oil and gas production, power plants and coastal {{industrial}} plants (Antaki 2003; Yang and Cheng 2012). The main use of seawater is for cooling purposes, {{but it is also}} used for fire fighting and oilfield water injection and in desalination plants (Kehr 2003). Nayyer (2000) describes <b>pipeline</b> <b>networks</b> as the arteries and veins of the modern civilization, since <b>pipeline</b> <b>networks</b> are implemented in fluid transmission and cooling purposes of either onshore or offshore applications. The widespread use of <b>pipeline</b> <b>networks</b> and their vast applications in oil and gas industries such as crude oil and natural gas transportation from production fields to refineries, processing plants and distribution to consumers explain the necessity of continuous monitoring and diagnosis of <b>pipeline</b> <b>networks</b> (Cronin 2000) in order to avoid catastrophic failures that can lead to grave environmental impacts. Many literatures have also discussed the costly terms of production losses especially due to pipeline corrosion damages (Yang and Cheng 2012; Winkelmans and Wevers 2002; Kehr 2003; Roberge 2000).|$|R
25|$|An oil pipeline, {{the first}} in the Russian Empire, between Balkhany and Cherny Gorod near Baku (12km, 1878 complete, used by the Branobel). By 1883 the total length of Shukhov-designed, Bari-built oil {{pipelines}} in Baku exceeded 94km, transporting 30,000 barrels of oil per day. In 1894, a similar <b>pipeline</b> <b>network</b> was built in Grozny. Shukhov designed the first Trans-Caucasian kerosene pipeline between Baku and Batumi (835km long) and Grozny-Tuapse pipeline (618km long).|$|E
25|$|The Project {{was delighted}} by the RC-1 proposal, and several well-publicized stories about it followed. They were {{particularly}} interested in the way that it allowed them to have market flexibility; the RC-1 could reach pipelines in Cochrane, Ontario, any one of the existing pipe heads in Alberta, or any point between. If market demands changed, they could simply ship the gas to a different location, thereby avoiding the cycling of prices seen between the various points on the <b>pipeline</b> <b>network.</b>|$|E
25|$|Starting {{from a new}} {{compressor}} station at Felindre near Swansea the pipeline runs to Corse near Tirley, Gloucestershire, where it connects with the existing gas <b>pipeline</b> <b>network.</b> To permit the new pipeline to operate at the intended 94 barg, a Pressure Reduction Installation (PRI) is required before it joins the existing National Transmission System â€“ the 'motorway' of gas distribution in the UK. National Grid applied to Forest of Dean District Council in 2006 for planning permission to construct a PRI at Corse but this was refused by the Council and an appeal against that decision was refused by the Secretaries of State in December 2007. An application to construct a PRI on a second site, 400 metres from the first site, was lodged with Tewkesbury Borough Council in 2008 but was refused unanimously by that Council's Planning Committee on 2 February 2010. National Grid appealed against that decision.|$|E

25|$|In Finland {{district}} heating {{accounts for about}} 50% of the total heating market, 80% of which is produced by {{combined heat and power}} plants. Over 90% of apartment blocks, {{more than half of all}} terraced houses, and the bulk of public buildings and business premises are connected to a {{district heating}} network. Natural gas is mostly used in the south-east gas <b>pipeline</b> <b>network,</b> imported coal is used in areas close to ports, and peat is used in northern areas where peat is a natural resource. Other renewables, such as wood chips and other paper industry combustible by-products, are also used, as is the energy recovered by the incineration of municipal solid waste. Industrial units which generate heat as an industrial by-product may sell otherwise waste heat to the network rather than release it into the environment. Excess heat and power from pulp mill recovery boilers is a significant source in mill towns. In some towns waste incineration can contribute as much as 8% of the district heating heat requirement. Availability is 99.98% and disruptions, when they do occur, usually reduce temperatures by only a few degrees.|$|E
500|$|The Soviet Union had, at its height, a <b>pipeline</b> <b>network</b> of [...] for {{crude oil}} and another [...] for natural gas. The Soviet authorities, under Leonid Brezhnev, began {{focusing}} on the national pipeline system in the 1970s. Soviet pipelines experienced a fast growth in the 1970s; by the late 1970s the <b>pipeline</b> <b>network</b> was {{the largest in the}} world. The average moving distance for oil and natural gas increased from 80km in 1970 to 1,910km in 1980, and 2,350 in 1988. Just as with many other sectors of the Soviet economy, bad maintenance led to deterioration. By the late 1980s only 1,500km pipelines were under maintenance, half of what was minimally needed. Also, the storage facilities were inadequate to handle the growing Soviet oil supply. Failures in the pipelines network became, in the 1980s, a common feature of the system. Oil pipeline ruptures at oil fields were increasing up to an all-time high in 1990 and reached a 15 percent failure rate that year alone.|$|E

The most dominant phase {{of the life cycle}} is pipe manufacturing and fabrication process, resulting in large amounts of CO 2 emissions. The results indicate that PVC provides the best environmental savings compared to steel and DI pipes in terms of CO 2 emission and emission mitigation cost.

5000|$|Major <b>pipeline</b> <b>networks</b> {{exist at}} all latitudes and many systems are on a {{continental}} scale. <b>Pipeline</b> <b>networks</b> are constructed from steel to contain high-pressure liquid or gas and have corrosion resistant coatings. Weathering and other damage to the pipeline coating can result in the steel being exposed to moist air or to the ground, causing localised corrosion problems. Cathodic protection is used to minimise corrosion by maintaining the steel at a negative potential {{with respect to the}} ground. The operating potential is determined from the electro-chemical properties of the soil and Earth {{in the vicinity of the}} pipeline. The GIC hazard to pipelines is that GIC cause swings in the pipe-to-soil potential, increasing the rate of corrosion during major geomagnetic storms (Gummow, 2002). GIC risk is not a risk of catastrophic failure, but a reduced service life of the pipeline.|$|R
