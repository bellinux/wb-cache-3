50|$|If the {{stator winding}} is {{connected}} to the primary phase, the total voltage seen from the neutral (N) will be the sum of the voltages at both windings rotor and stator. Translating this to electric <b>phasors,</b> both <b>phasors</b> are connected. However, there is an angular shifting of α between them. Since α can be freely chosen between π, both <b>phasors</b> can be added or subtracted, so all the values in between are attainable. The primary and secondary are not isolated. Also, the ratio of the magnitudes of voltages between rotor and stator is constant; the resultant voltage varies owing to the angular shifting of the series winding induced voltage.|$|R

Considering a monochromatic plane wave of optical frequency f (light of vacuum wavelength λ has a frequency of f = c/λ where c is the speed of light), let us take the direction of propagation as the z axis.
