2500|$|The name of {{the city}} is a Native American word which roughly {{translates}} to [...] "great marsh." [...] The term <b>pocosin,</b> with its varied spellings, was a term used by the area's inhabitants to describe a low, marshy, woody place covered by water in the winter, but dry in the summer. These Native Americans were Algonquians, a tribal group affiliated through the Powhatan Confederacy, and were hostile to the early settlers. A petition to have the {{name of the}} parish and river changed was an attempt to rid the language of all vestiges of Indian terms. However, [...] "poquoson" [...] has survived through the centuries and has become a proper noun used to designate the present city.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pocosin</b> {{is a type}} of palustrine wetland with deep, acidic, sandy, peat soils. Groundwater {{saturates}} {{the soil}} except during brief seasonal dry spells and during prolonged droughts. <b>Pocosin</b> soils are nutrient-deficient (oligotrophic), especially in phosphorus.|$|E
5000|$|The White Oak <b>Pocosin</b> {{is a large}} swamp in {{northern}} Onslow County and southern Jones County, North Carolina in the United States. It provides {{the headwaters of the}} White Oak River. The word <b>pocosin</b> is a Native American word meaning [...] "swamp".|$|E
50|$|<b>Pocosins</b> {{occur in}} the {{southern}} portions of the Atlantic coastal plain of North America, spanning from southeastern Virginia, through North Carolina, and into South Carolina. However, the majority of <b>pocosins</b> are found in North Carolina. They occupy poorly drained higher ground between streams and floodplains. Seeps cause the inundation. There are often perched water tables underlying <b>pocosins.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A {{distinction}} is sometimes made between short <b>pocosins,</b> which have shorter trees (less than 20 ft), deeper peat, and fewer soil nutrients, and tall <b>pocosins,</b> which have taller trees (greater than 20 ft), shallow peat, and more nutrient-rich soil. [...] Where soil saturation is less frequent and peat depths shallower, <b>pocosins</b> transition into pine flatwoods. A loose definition of [...] "pocosin" [...] can include all shrub and forest bogs, {{as well as}} stands of Atlantic White Cedar (Chamaecyparis thyoides) and loblolly pine on the Atlantic coastal plain. A stricter definition (promulgated by A. W. Kuchler) restricts <b>pocosins</b> to shrubby [...] "short pocosins" [...] and pond pine-forested [...] "tall pocosins".|$|R
30|$|Aboveground C {{emissions}} {{based on}} vegetation class incorporated separate calculations for litter, shrub, and foliage in <b>pocosins,</b> with areas of taller, thicker vegetation (high <b>pocosins)</b> emitting {{higher rates of}} C relative {{to the other two}} vegetation types (Table 5). The ecosystem’s shrub layer contributed the highest proportion of C in dNBR classes 1 to 3.|$|R
5000|$|The word <b>pocosin</b> {{comes from}} an Eastern Algonquian word meaning [...] "swamp-on-a-hill", however, a more {{accurate}} description of a <b>pocosin</b> would be a “raised bog”. The city of Poquoson, Virginia, located in the coastal plain of Virginia (see Tidewater region of Virginia), derives its name from this geographic feature.|$|E

40|$|Carolina {{bays and}} <b>pocosins</b> are two {{distinct}} physiographic features {{found on the}} Atlantic Coastal Plain of the southeastern United States. Although <b>pocosins</b> {{have been identified in}} the literature for more than two hundred years and Carolina bays for more than one hundred, confusion frequently still exists pertaining to the definitions of both as they are often incorrectly assumed to be indistinguishable and the terms are used synonymously. This paper defines each term and illustrates how bays and <b>pocosins</b> differ. In some instances Carolina bays do possess pocosin-type vegetation, in fact, most if not all have at some time past possessed shrub bog or pocosin-type vegetation. The approach used in this paper shows that Carolina bays are landform features that now vary greatly in their land cover, while <b>pocosins</b> are unique ecological communities.

5000|$|<b>Pocosin</b> Lakes NWR was {{established}} in 1990. Originally, the 12000 acre southwestern portion of the refuge {{was established}} in 1963 as the Pungo National Wildlife Refuge, but was merged in 1990 with <b>Pocosin</b> Lakes. The National Wildlife Refuge is 110106 acre, and approximately 90000 acre were donated. This refuge is home to indigenous animals such as the black bear, alligator, two species of fox, bobcat, raccoon, coyote, opossum, beaver, river otter, mink, and red wolf.|$|E

It blooms early March to May.|$|R

50|$|It burned 41534 acre {{inside the}} <b>Pocosin</b> Lakes National Wildlife Refuge and burned for three months. The {{wildlife}} refuge {{is located in}} the Albemarle-Pamlico Peninsula, where many forest fires are prone to start because of several ecological factors. The area is densely populated by trees, which makes it easy for fires to spread quickly; a layer of shrubs and dead plant material on the ground serve as fuel for fires. Under this layer, the <b>pocosin</b> soil is high in organic material, which acts as a charcoal-like substance that helps fires start.|$|E

50|$|The main {{threat to}} the species is the loss and {{degradation}} of its habitat. Much {{of the land in}} the region has been developed, the wetlands drained and dried to create land for residential, industrial, and recreational purposes. Habitat that remains is improperly managed, becoming degraded as the natural fire regime is prevented. As fire suppression practices have been implemented, the <b>pocosins,</b> sandhills, and swamps have overgrown with brush and woody vegetation. Shrubs are not kept back and they grow to large sizes and shade out the smaller plants in the herb layer. Even where fire is prescribed or allowed to take place, <b>pocosins</b> do not burn thoroughly enough to remove the heavy organic layers that accumulate there. Activities involved with fire may also be detrimental, as firebreaks are often plowed in the very ecotone openings where the plant most often grows. Agriculture, including pine plantations, and other types of operations alter the hydrology of the wetlands, making conditions unsuitable for this and other native plants. Many of the populations are located on military bases and are vulnerable to destruction during military operations.|$|R
2500|$|... {{although}} less-common wetlands including fens, <b>pocosins,</b> and peat swamp forests also deposit peat. Landscapes {{covered in}} peat {{are home to}} specific kinds of plants including Sphagnum moss, ericaceous shrubs, and sedges (see bog {{for more information on}} this aspect of peat). Because organic matter accumulates over thousands of years, peat deposits provide records of past vegetation and climate by preserving plant remains, such as pollen. This allows humans to reconstruct past environments and study changes in human land use.|$|R
50|$|Eastern North Carolinas {{abundant}} waterfowl {{was considered}} one of its most valuable natural resources for generations. Flocks {{of hundreds of thousands of}} birds would shelter in the coastal marshes and <b>pocosins</b> and along the sounds. While the population has decreased significantly over the last century, many migratory birds still visit eastern North Carolina. As a result, the region draws many hunters and birdwatchers. This culture gave rise to a local tradition of decoy carving of which Fulcher was a notable practitioner.|$|R
