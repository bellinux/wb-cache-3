40|$|During {{the past}} quarter, several {{modifications}} {{were made to}} the TES unit and the materials handling system. The cylindrical electrodes were replaced by a set of screen electrodes to provide a more uniform electrostatic field. The problem with the recycle conveyor neutralizing the particle charge was also corrected by replacing it with a bucket elevator. In addition, problems with the turbocharger were corrected by increasing the number of charging stages from one to two. These modifications have significantly improved the separation performance and have permitted the POC-scale unit to achieve results in line with those obtained by the bench-scale separator. The testing phase of the project was continued at a rapid pace during this quarter. The test work showed that the modifications to the TES unit and the reduction in feed size from 28 mesh to 35 mesh resulted in significant overall improvement in yield and combustible recovery compared to the data reported in the last quarter. At that time, there was a significant discrepancy between the bench-scale and the pilot-scale results. The <b>pilot-scale</b> <b>test</b> work is now approaching the bench scale test results.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of more stringent environmental and occupational {{health and safety}} regulations have instigated efforts {{to reduce the amount of}} dust generated during loading of ships with dusty bulk materials. An initial study was undertaken to investigate possible methods to reduce dust emissions from wheat loading operations at the Port of Newcastle. Details of this study are contained in an industrial report by Krull [I] and articles by Wheeler et al. [2, 31. In summary, a number of alternative loading chute configurations and delivery chute profiles were examined in a <b>pilot-scale</b> <b>test</b> facility, which showed that it was not beneficial to decelerate the product stream in an effort to keep the relative velocity of the air stream over the grain below the minimum pickup velocity. Instead, it was found that concentrating the product stream and keeping the product velocity high was more beneficial in reducing dust emissions. Experimental results showed a 50 % dust reduction was possible and was subsequently achieved at the grain loading terminal. Further studies have since been conducted for Finders Ports in Port Adelaide, Australia to examine if the same approach could be used for loading ilmenite onto ships. Experimental results conducted in the <b>pilot-scale</b> <b>test</b> facility using the same chute configuration as used for wheat indicate a potential dust reduction of approximately 80 %. For both the investigated ship loading operations, similar constraints on the implementation of dust reducing methods were imposed as follows: Required modifications to the ship loaders must be undertaken in a short period of time and if possible not involve any significant structural work to the ship loader. Ability to retrofit to the existing booms of the ship loaders.
