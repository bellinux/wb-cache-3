40|$|Soybean, Glycine max (L.) Merr., is an {{important}} source of oil and protein worldwide, and soybean cyst nematode (SCN), Heterodera glycines, is among the most important yield-limiting factors in soybean production worldwide. Early detection of SCN is difficult because soybean plants infected by SCN often do not exhibit visible symptoms. It was hypothesized, however, that reflectance data obtained by remote sensing from soybean canopies may be used to detect plant stress caused by SCN infection. Moreover, reflectance measurements may be related to soybean growth and yield.;Two field experiments were conducted from 2000 to 2002 to study the relationships among reflectance data, quantity and quality of soybean yield, and SCN <b>population</b> <b>densities.</b> The best relationships between reflectance and the quantity of soybean grain yield occurred when reflectance data were obtained late August to early September. Similarly, reflectance was best related to seed oil and seed protein content and seed size when measured during late August/early September. Grain quality-reflectance relationships varied spatially and temporally.;Reflectance measured early or late in the season had the best relationships with SCN <b>population</b> <b>densities</b> measured at planting. Soil properties likely affected reflectance measurements obtained {{at the beginning of the}} season and somehow may have been related to SCN <b>population</b> <b>densities</b> at planting. Reflectance data obtained at the end of the growing season likely was affected by early senescence of SCN-infected soybeans.;Spatio-temporal aspects of SCN <b>population</b> <b>densities</b> in both experiments were assessed using spatial statistics and regression analyses. In the 2000 and 2001 growing seasons, spring-to-fall changes in SCN <b>population</b> <b>densities</b> were best related to SCN <b>population</b> <b>densities</b> at planting for both experiments. However, within-season changes in SCN <b>population</b> <b>densities</b> were best related to SCN <b>population</b> <b>densities</b> at harvest for both experiments in 2002.

5|$|Methods used {{to prevent}} malaria include medications, {{mosquito}} elimination and the prevention of bites. There is no vaccine for malaria. The presence of malaria in an area requires a combination of high human <b>population</b> <b>density,</b> high anopheles mosquito <b>population</b> <b>density</b> and high rates of transmission from humans to mosquitoes and from mosquitoes to humans. If any of these is lowered sufficiently, the parasite will eventually disappear from that area, as happened in North America, Europe {{and parts of the}} Middle East. However, unless the parasite is eliminated from the whole world, it could become re-established if conditions revert to a combination that favors the parasite's reproduction. Furthermore, the cost per person of eliminating anopheles mosquitoes rises with decreasing <b>population</b> <b>density,</b> making it economically unfeasible in some areas.|$|E
40|$|The soybean cyst {{nematode}} (SCN) is a serious, widespread pest of soybean in Iowa and most soybean-producing areas of the Midwest. The nematode infests more than 70 percent of the fields in Iowa. However, SCN usually causes no obvious aboveground symptoms for many years after being introduced into a field. Consequently, many SCN-infested fields in Iowa may go undiagnosed. The lack of symptoms and subsequent missed diagnosis are unfortunate because the key to effective management of SCN is early detection, before large nematode <b>population</b> <b>densities</b> develop. It {{is much easier to}} keep low <b>population</b> <b>densities</b> low than to drive high <b>population</b> <b>densities</b> down.

40|$|ABSTRACT <b>Population</b> <b>densities</b> of a predatory ground beetle, Pasimachus elongatus LeConte (Coleoptera: Carabidae), were {{examined}} at the Central Plains Experimental Range, Colorado. Using distance sampling theory, I analyzed density estimates dating from before {{an application of}} the insecticide methamidophos (1988) and three beetle generations afterward (1994) to address the following questions. Have <b>population</b> <b>densities</b> of p elongatus recovered to prespray levels? Are current <b>population</b> <b>densities</b> of p elongatus in areas exposed to methamidophos in 1988 equal to those not exposed in 1988 ? How do <b>population</b> <b>densities</b> of p elongatus vary with habitat type in methamidophos exposed and nonexposed areas? This work updates earlier findings that p elongatus <b>population</b> <b>densities</b> decreased after methamidophos applications. Lingering differences in p elongatus densities were found among areas differing in methamidophos exposure; these differences were also related to habitat type. Higher <b>population</b> <b>densities</b> were found in methamidophos exposed than in control areas; higher densities were also found in shrub dominated than in grass dominated sites, regardless of past methamidophos exposure.

Beds planted with sunn hemp or rapeseed had lower <b>population</b> <b>densities</b> of R. reniformis than African marigold, weeds, or pineapple plots during cover crop growth, {{and the subsequent}} pineapple-growing periods.
