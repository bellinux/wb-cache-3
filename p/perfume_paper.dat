6000|$|On {{the deck}} of a junk is always to be found a josshouse or temple, in front of which the crew keep incense, sticks, and <b>perfumed</b> <b>paper</b> {{continually}} burning. When a calm overtakes an English vessel, the sailors and passengers are always supposed to try what [...] "whistling for a wind" [...] will effect. In lieu of this method of [...] "raising the wind," [...] a Chinese sailor shapes little junks out of paper, and sets them afloat on the water as a propitiatory service to the divinity who has the welfare of seamen under his especial care.|$|R

60|$|Madeline took up her sister's {{letter with}} a strange {{sensation}} of how easily sight of a crested monogram and scent of delicately <b>perfumed</b> <b>paper</b> could recall the brilliant life she had given up. She scanned the pages of beautiful handwriting. Helen's letter was in turn gay and brilliant and lazy, {{just as she was}} herself; but Madeline detected more of curiosity in it than of real longing to see the sister and brother in the Far West. Much of what Helen wrote was enthusiastic anticipation of the fun she expected to have with bashful cowboys. Helen seldom wrote letters, and she never read anything, not even popular novels of the day. She was as absolutely ignorant of the West as the Englishman, who, she said, expected to hunt buffalo and fight Indians. Moreover, there was a satiric note in the letter that Madeline did not like, and which roused her spirit. Manifestly, Helen was reveling in the prospect of new sensation.|$|R

5000|$|Peau d'Espagne, or Spanish Skin, {{is merely}} highly-perfumed leather. Take of oil of rose, neroli, and santal sandalwood, each 1/2 ounce; oil of lavender, verbena, bergamot, each 1/4 ounce; {{oil of cloves}} and cinnamon, each 2 drachms; in this {{dissolve}} 2 ounces gum benzoin. In this steep good pieces of waste leather {{for a day or}} two, and dry it over a line. Prepare a paste by rubbing in a mortar, 1 drachm of civet with 1 drachm of grain musk, and enough gum-tragacanth mucilage to give a proper consistence. The leather is cut up into pieces about 4 inches square; two of these are pasted together with the above paste, placed between 2 pieces of paper, weighted or pressed until dry. It may then be inclosed in silk or satin. It gives off its odor for years; is much used for <b>perfuming</b> <b>paper,</b> envelopes, etc.; for which purpose 1 or 2 pieces of the perfumed leather, kept in the drawer or desk containing the paper, will impart to it a fine and durable perfume.|$|R
50|$|In August 1909, {{the famous}} Russian artistic {{periodical}} Apollon {{received a letter}} with verses on a <b>perfumed</b> <b>paper</b> with black mourning edges, signed only by a single Russian letter Ch. The verses were filled with half-revelations about its author - supposedly a beautiful maiden with dark secrets. The same day {{a woman with a}} beautiful voice phoned the journal's publisher Sergei Makovsky and arranged for publication of the verses. Over the next few months, publications of the newfound poetic star were the major hit of the magazine, and many believed that they had found a major new talent in Russian poetry. The identity of the author was slowly revealed: her name was Baroness Cherubina de Gabriak, a Russian-speaking girl of French and Polish ancestry who lived in a very strict Roman Catholic aristocratic family, who severely limited the girl's contacts with the outside world because of an unspoken secret in her past. Almost all of Apollon’s male writers fell in love with her, most of all the great poet Nikolai Gumilyov. He wrote a series of passionate love letters to her and received quite passionate answers.|$|R

Many ponies released {{in the last years of}} the line are considered rare. A number of playsets were introduced, including a mansion and a castle. Some of the licensed merchandise released in Europe included beanbag plushes, magazines, clothing, <b>perfume,</b> wrapping <b>paper</b> and coloring books. A CD-ROM game for PC, Friendship Gardens, was also released, which involved taking care of a pony and playing games along the way.|$|R
2500|$|Since P. {{carolina}} nests in sheltered areas, it commonly constructs nests {{in close}} proximity to humans, such as the open space under a roof. [...] They are also often attracted to humans due to loud noises, bright colors, and sweet smells, such as food and <b>perfume.</b> Typical <b>paper</b> wasps are relatively unaggressive, only attacking humans and animals if they or their nests are being threatened. [...] Red paper wasps are more aggressive and their stings can be more painful; however, only females have the ability to sting. Unlike bees, wasps do not lose their stingers, thus they are able to sting multiple times.|$|R

Attar narrated that Bishr had lived a life of dissipation, and one day, as he was staggering along the road drunk, he found {{a piece of paper}} on which was written, “In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate.” Bishr is said to have bought an attar of roses and <b>perfumed</b> the <b>paper</b> with it, and then deposited it reverently in his house. That night a venerable man had a dream in which he was bidden to tell Bishr: ...|$|R

40|$|Allylic alcohols, such as methyl styryl {{carbinol}} (MSC), {{are required}} as single enantiomers {{for use as}} chiral building blocks, flavor additives, and aroma compounds in <b>perfumes.</b> This <b>paper</b> investigates the use of dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) for this purpose, by determining concentration-time data for all species in the racemization, kinetic resolution (KR), and DKR of MSC in toluene. Racemization was catalyzed by ruthenium p-cymene combined {{with a number of}} different bases, while Novozym 435 catalyzed the KR. Results showed that the racemization is the rate-limiting step in MSC DKR because the hydrogenation step of the catalyst cycle is deactivated by the KR products. Furthermore, the racemization bases and ruthenium p-cymene made the KR less enantiospecific by either catalyzing nonenantiospecific allylic acetate formation or interfering with enzyme enantiospecifity. Nevertheless, DKRs using ruthenium p-cymene combined with triethylamine, trioctylamine, or P 1 -t-Oct gave enantiopure (R) -allylic acetate yields above 68 % at 80 - 97 % ee...|$|R

40|$|The {{fluctuations}} {{in the image of}} six perfumes (rose, sandalwood, lemon, eucalyptus, peppermint and lavender) associated with the menstrual cycle were analyzed using the questionnaire based on the semantic differential method. Three female undergraduates (21 - 22 yr.) smelled the <b>perfumes</b> on filter <b>paper</b> and answered to the 20 items about subjective estimates of each perfume three days a week during three or four consecutive menstrual cycles. Factor analysis on the scores of the items revealed four main factors; "Evaluation", "Potency", "Maturation" and "Passion". The combination of these factors properly explained the characteristics of perfumes. The fluctuation of the factor scores of "Evaluation", "Maturation" and "Passion" during the menstrual cycle was evident in case of rose; minimum on the second day (menstruation phase) and maximum on the 17 th day (post-ovulation phase). The perfume of peppermint and lavender also had a peak on the 17 th day. Thus the questionnaire using semantic differential method proved useful to assess the image of perfume and sensitive to detect the cyclic variation...|$|R
40|$|Advertisement, omnipresent in {{the media}} and daily life, is {{constitutive}} of a widespread cultural practice, circulating commodities as well as knowledge. While research studies have long challenged the ways in which advertising and marketing campaigns in western countries employ gendered imagery that objectify women and reinforce power differences between the sexes in order to sell their products, not much attention has been given to the images of the Orient that are adopted to create woman imagery in advertisements. This paper, by using a semiotic analysis, discusses the representation of the Orient in western women perfume advertisements—the one type of advertisement where woman images have been a focal point and most fully exploited. Through decoding the signs and discourses in the deployment of Oriental images in women <b>perfume</b> advertisements, the <b>paper</b> attempts to reveal how race and gender are combined to create and reinforce female roles and define femininity in western societies. The media explosion of the 20 th and 21 st centuries—mass-produced newspapers and magazines, radio and television broadcasts, and the all-pervasive internet—has give...|$|R
