25|$|In LiDCO, the {{independent}} calibration technique is lithium chloride dilution using the Stewart-Hamilton principle. Lithium chloride dilution uses a peripheral vein and a peripheral arterial line. Like PiCCO, frequent calibration is recommended {{when there is}} a change in Q. Calibration events are limited in frequency because they involve the injection of lithium chloride and can be subject to errors in the presence of certain muscle relaxants. The PulseCO algorithm used by LiDCO is based on <b>pulse</b> <b>power</b> derivation and is not dependent on waveform morphology.|$|E
25|$|A {{group of}} EVs and HEVs during their {{charging}} process draw very high current {{for a short}} duration of time which creates power pulsation on the grid. Power pulsation not only reduces {{the efficiency of the}} grid and cause voltage drop in the common coupling bus, but it can cause considerable frequency fluctuation in the entire system. To overcome this problem, supercapacitors can be implemented as an interface between the charging station and the grid to buffer the grid from the high <b>pulse</b> <b>power</b> drawn from the charging station.|$|E

2500|$|In December 1992, during Galileo second gravity-assist {{planetary}} flyby of Earth, another groundbreaking {{experiment was}} performed. Optical communications in space {{was assessed by}} detecting light pulses from powerful lasers with Galileo CCD. The experiment, dubbed Galileo Optical Experiment or GOPEX, used two separate sites to beam laser pulses to the spacecraft, one at Table Mountain Observatory in California and the other at the Starfire Optical Range in New Mexico. The Table Mountain site used a frequency doubled Neodymium-Yttrium-Aluminium garnet (...) laser operating at 532nm with a repetition rate of ~15 to 30Hz and a <b>pulse</b> <b>power</b> (FWHM) {{in the tens of}} megawatts range, which was coupled to a [...] Cassegrain telescope for transmission to Galileo. The Starfire range site used a similar setup with a larger, , transmitting telescope. Long exposure (~0.1 to 0.8s) images using Galileo 560nm centered green filter produced images of Earth clearly showing the laser pulses even at distances of up to [...] Adverse weather conditions, restrictions placed on laser transmissions by the U.S. Space Defense Operations Center (SPADOC) and a pointing error caused by the scan platform acceleration on the spacecraft being slower than expected (which prevented laser detection on all frames with less than 400ms exposure times) all contributed to the reduction of the number of successful detections of the laser transmission to 48 of the total 159 frames taken. Nonetheless, the experiment was considered a resounding success and the data acquired will likely be used in the future to design laser [...] "downlinks" [...] which will send large volumes of data very quickly from spacecraft to Earth. The scheme is already being studied (as of 2004) for a data link to a future Mars orbiting spacecraft.|$|E
