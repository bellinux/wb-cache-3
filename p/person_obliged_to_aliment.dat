40|$|In the Polish {{system of}} civil law {{there are three}} main regimes of {{liability}} for damages formed. Liability with or without fault and liability {{based on the principle}} of equity. It happens more and more often that the aggrieved party in the purpose of compensating the damage reaches out beyond the direct perpetrator, namely to those who by act of law or on the basis of legal relationship, are <b>obliged</b> <b>to</b> repair the damage for inadequate supervision over general safety or a particular person. However, sometimes the responsibility of such people is excluded or is not an option. For that reason it is important to examine the topic of liability for damages based on the principle of equity which is applied merely to cases specified in the Code, that is Art. 417 (2), 428 and 431 CC. Close attention should be drawn to liability for damages on the basis of Art. 428 CC. In this case, the liability is justified in the following cases: 1) supervisory is not established although there are indications for that, 2) lack of indications for establishing the supervisory, 3) a <b>person</b> <b>obliged</b> <b>to</b> supervise shirked his or her responsibility, 4) the residence of the <b>person</b> <b>obliged</b> <b>to</b> supervise cannot be established, 5) the compensation from the <b>person</b> <b>obliged</b> <b>to</b> supervise cannot be obtained due to his or her financial situation or the compensation is incomplete. If the claim of the injured party is justified by principles of social coexistence, he is entitled to demand compensation for the damage from the perpetrator. It is questionable, however, just how much compensation he can demand on the principle of equity. The determination of whether the obligation to compensate should be reduced because of contribution is made by the court in its own assessment and this is its power. In the light of the recent case law of the Supreme Court it is assumed that, “on the basis of Art. 362 CC, to reduce the compensation for a minor who is not liable due to age, it is possible to use Art. 428 CC by analogy when it is demanded by the principles of social coexistence” (judgement of the Supreme Court of 19 March 2014, file ref.

40|$|The {{principle}} of equal living standard {{has long been}} {{considered one of the}} elements defining the extent of the duty of alimony despite the fact that such a rule has never been expressly formulated in the provisions of family law acts.

It requires that the standard of living of the subject entitled to support be. similar to the living standard of the <b>person</b> <b>obliged</b> <b>to</b> grant allowances. The {{principle of}} equal living standard operates within the general provision defining the premisses delimiting the scope of alimony (art. 135 § 1 of F. G. C.). In other words, the said principle merely modifies those premisses but does not eliminate them from the process of stating the extent of the duty of alimony. The equail living standard principle should be applied to delimiting the volume of alimony between the persons constituting the family in terms of art. 23 and 27 of F. G. C, and between the parents and their dependent children (art. 133 § 1 of F. G. C). The opinions suggesting wider or narrower range of application of the said principle do not seem justified in view of the provisions of F. G. C.; moreover, they have never gained any considerable support in the light of thé Supreme Court's decisions.
