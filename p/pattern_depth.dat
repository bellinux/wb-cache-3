40|$|In this study, cell {{responses}} on micropatterned films that were changing in groove–ridge widths and <b>pattern</b> <b>depth</b> were investigated {{to compare the}} degree of size effects from X–Y and Z planes. Poly(caprolactone) films with five different groove–ridge sizes and three pattern depths were prepared by hot embossing technique. In general, the morphologies of osteoblast cell were not changed noticeably by the size changes in groove–ridges with the same depth size. However, cell morphologies were changed significantly when pattern depths were increased from 1. 35 to 4. 95 µm. Also, the cell morphology change between different groove–ridges was significant when the <b>pattern</b> <b>depth</b> was small (1. 35 µm), and these effects were diminished or masked when the <b>pattern</b> <b>depth</b> was increased to 4. 95 µm. Linear regression analysis further clarifies that unit size changes in depth may affect cell length and orientation rates 2. 4 and 4 times, respectively, in comparison to rates obtained from X–Y planes.

30|$|When you meditate {{and bring}} {{conscious}} awareness to your breathing, you are activating the neural pathways associated with conscious control and overriding those that typically cause your breathing <b>pattern</b> (<b>depth</b> {{of breath and}} rate) to be a completely unconscious process. In general, our bodies 'know' how much we should breathe {{in order to meet}} the metabolic demands of the moment (need for oxygen and the need to remove the excess carbon dioxide we are producing). An altered breathing pattern (for example, breath of fire in Kundalini yoga) is something that you are imposing on the body. This may account for the difficulty in correctly and effectively engaging in various breathing regimens while meditating. It also explains the fact that you cannot maintain an imposed, voluntary, breathing pattern indefinitely. Over time, you will ultimately revert back to the unconscious and optimal pattern (optimal in terms of metabolism, not necessarily in terms of your meditative goals). As in all things, practice improves the ability to establish and maintain an imposed voluntary breathing pattern but you will always have to engage the thinking and planning portions of the brain located in the cerebral cortex to continue breathing this way.|$|E
40|$|Low-Cost test methodologies for Systems-on-Chip are {{increasingly}} popular. They dictate which features {{have to be}} included on-chip and which test procedures have to be adopted in order to guarantee high test quality, while minimizing application costs. Consequently, Low-Cost test strategies can be run on testers offering lower performance and/or reduced features with respect to traditional Automatic Test Equipments (ATEs); these equipments are usually referred to as Low-Cost testers. This paper proposes a methodology for reducing the test data volume {{for the application of}} SoC Low-Cost test procedures. The method exploits a tester architecture organization suitable for SoCs testing, which includes a programmable device: the usage of this configurable block joined to the analysis of test pattern regularities permits minimizing the test data volume, thus improving the tester capabilities. The proposed method relies on test pattern compression at system level and it does not address core level pattern manipulation, as several other previously published works do. Case studies are proposed, which provide data about the application of the proposed methodology to the test of SoCs including self-testable processor and memory cores.

Only 8 % of stem sections survived when cut into smaller (3 to 5 cm) sections and buried at a depth of 10 cm.

40|$|International audienceDespite its {{significant}} {{functional and}} clinical interest, {{the anatomy of}} the uncinate fasciculus (UF) has received little attention. It {{is known as a}} ‘hook-shaped’ fascicle connecting the frontal and anterior temporal lobes and is believed to consist of multiple subcomponents. However, the knowledge of its precise connectional anatomy in humans is lacking, and its subcomponent divisions are unclear. In the present study, we evaluate the anatomy of the UF and provide its detailed normative description in 30 healthy subjects with advanced particle-filtering tractography with anatomical priors and robustness to crossing fibers with constrained spherical deconvolution. We extracted the UF by defining its stem encompassing all streamlines that converge into a compact bundle, which consisted not only of the classic hook-shaped fibers, but also of straight horizontally oriented. We applied an automatic-clustering method to subdivide the UF bundle and revealed five subcomponents in each hemisphere with distinct connectivity profiles, including different asymmetries. A layer-by-layer microdissection of the ventral part of the external and extreme capsules using Klingler’s preparation also demonstrated five types of uncinate fibers that, according to their <b>pattern,</b> <b>depth,</b> and cortical terminations, were consistent with the diffusion-based UF subcomponents. The present results shed new light on the UF cortical terminations and its multicomponent internal organization with extended cortical connections within the frontal and temporal cortices. The different lateralization patterns we report within the UF subcomponents reconcile the conflicting asymmetry findings of the literature. Such results clarifying the UF structural anatomy lay the groundwork for more targeted investigations of its functional role, especially in semantic language processing...|$|E

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{literature study}} was conducted to evaluate the levels of evidence (LEs) in publications on the diagnosis and staging of penile cancer. Recommendations from the available evidence were formulated and discussed by the full panel of the International Consultation on Penile Cancer in November 2008. The final grades of recommendation (GRs) were assigned according to the LEs of the relevant publications. The following consensus recommendations were accepted: physical examination of the primary penile lesion is mandatory, evaluating the morphologic and physical characteristics of the lesion (GR A). Evaluation of the primary lesion with ultrasonography is of limited value for local tumor staging (GR C); however, evaluation of the primary tumor with magnetic resonance (MRI) imaging during artificial erection induced by intracavernosal injection of prostaglandin might be more useful (GR B). Histologic or cytologic diagnosis of the primary lesion is mandatory (GR A). For accurate histologic grading and staging, a resected specimen is preferable to a biopsy specimen alone (GR B). Penile cancer should be staged according to the TNM system; however, the 1987 / 2002 TNM staging system requires revision using data from larger patient cohorts to validate the recently proposed modifications (GR B). The histopathology report should provide information on all prognostic parameters, including the tumor size, histologic type, grade, growth <b>pattern,</b> <b>depth</b> of invasion, tumor thickness, resection margins, and lymphovascular and perineural invasion (GR B). Physical examination of the inguinal and pelvic areas to assess the lymph nodes is mandatory (GR B). Ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration cytology is indicated for both palpable and nonpalpable inguinal nodes. If the findings confirm lymph node metastasis (LNM), complete inguinal lymph node dissection is indicated (GR B). In patients with nonpalpable inguinal nodes, if the ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration cytology findings are negative for tumor, dynamic sentinel node biopsy can be performed if the equipment and technical expertise are available (GR C). In patients at high risk of inguinal LNM according to the available guidelines and nomograms, surgical staging can be performed by complete, bilateral inguinal lymph node dissection, which might also be curative (GR B). In patients at intermediate risk of LNM, sentinel node biopsy or modified (limited) inguinal lymph node dissection might be performed (GR B). In patients with nonpalpable inguinal nodes, imaging with computed tomography (CT) or MRI is not indicated, because they are not useful in detecting small-volume LNM. Also, it is very unlikely that large-volume LNM (detectable by CT/MRI) would be present in the pelvic nodes (GR B). In patients with confirmed inguinal LNM, CT of the pelvis is indicated to detect iliac LNMs (GR B). Abdominal CT and chest radiography are advisable if the pelvic CT findings are positive (GR B). © 2010 Elsevier Inc. Revie...|$|E
