25|$|Brig. Gen. Judson Kilpatrick's {{division}} {{was on the}} Union right flank. The majority of his men passed through Hanover {{early in the morning}} of June 30, pausing briefly for refreshments and to receive the greetings of the jubilant townspeople. Their town had been raided three days before by Confederate Lt. Col. Elijah V. White's cavalry, attached to Maj. Gen. Jubal Early's division that had occupied York County. White's Virginians and Marylanders had followed the railroad to Hanover from nearby Gettysburg, and taken horses, food, supplies, clothing, shoes, and other desired items from the townspeople, often paying with valueless Confederate money or drafts on the Confederate government. White's raiders had destroyed the area's telegraph wires, cutting off communications with the outside world, before sacking the nearby Hanover Junction train station. The unexpected arrival of Kilpatrick's column was a <b>pleasant</b> <b>surprise</b> to the residents of Hanover, who warmly greeted the Union troopers with food and drink.|$|E

Her first release of 2011 was Anand L. Rai's Tanu Weds Manu, a romantic comedy opposite R. Madhavan, which Ranaut considers a [...] "game changer" [...] for her. Rai stated that he cast her for the role to illustrate that the actress was capable of playing other roles and that her character in the film was unlike any of those that she had played previously. Critical reaction to the film was mixed, though Ranaut's performance was praised. Rajeev Masand wrote, [...] "Kangana Ranaut is a <b>pleasant</b> <b>surprise</b> in a cheery, upbeat part that we haven't seen her take on before.

[...] Ranaut received Best Actress nominations at several award ceremonies, including Screen and Zee Cine.|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} acclaim from critics. [...] James Montgomery of MTV News {{said of the}} song, [...] "there {{are moments}} on Stairs that stop you dead in your tracks, send shivers up your spine and make you go 'Whoa'... like the first four-and-a-half minutes of 'I Will Possess Your Heart,' a propulsive whirl of stalking bass line, spindly guitars and stabbing piano." [...] Will Hermes noted in Rolling Stone that the sense of menace in the song was [...] "playing against type for a guy with one of rock's purest voices—a vibrato-less, bell-clear high tenor whose choirboy quality only throws the darkness here into relief." [...] Blender Jonah Weiner concurred, stating [...] "it's a <b>pleasant</b> <b>surprise</b> to hear Gibbard inhabit such a self-consciously creepy role, rather than play the occasionally errant, essentially good-hearted boyfriend who soft-shoes through {{so many of his}} tales." [...] In 2011, Tyler Kane of Paste included the song in a list of [...] "the 25 creepiest songs about love".|$|E

500|$|... "Alive and Schticking" [...] {{received}} positive reviews. Fort Worth Star-Telegram contributor Robert Philpot, {{who gave}} the episode a B+ rating, {{thought it was a}} <b>pleasant</b> <b>surprise</b> and an indication that there [...] "might be some life" [...] left in the show. He added that the episode feels fresher because of the [...] "rapid-fire dialogue, farcical situations and ubiquitous double-entendres. And although this live edition was inarguably a stunt, it did prove that real people — and not mere machines — laugh at the characters and the jokes." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine also noted that the episode showed that Will & Grace still had a bit of life left. He added that McCormack seemed to flourish under the pressure, and that Hayes and Mullally [...] "were given free rein to flex their Jack and Karen [...] ". Dana Stevens of Slate magazine reported that [...] "Alive and Schticking" [...] offered a chance to punch up the show with some [...] "unusually broad sight gags."

500|$|Critics {{claimed the}} film's time {{constraints}} did not capture {{the depth and}} complexity of the television serials and called Wright's adaptation [...] "obviously [...] daring or revisionist" [...] as the serial. JASNA president Joan Klingel Ray preferred the young age of Knightley and Macfadyen, saying that Jennifer Ehle had formerly been [...] "a little too 'heavy' for the role." [...] Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian, while praising Knightley for an outstanding performance [...] "which lifts the whole movie", considered the casting of the leads [...] "arguably a little more callow than Firth and Ehle." [...] He does add that [...] "Only a snob, a curmudgeon, or someone with necrophiliac loyalty to the 1995 BBC version with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle could fail to enjoy [...] performance." [...] At the time, BBC film critic Stella Papamichael considered it Knightley's [...] "best performance yet." [...] Critics were divided about Macfadyen's portrayal of Darcy, expressing <b>pleasant</b> <b>surprise,</b> dislike for his lack of gradual emotional shift as in the novel, and praise for his matching the insecure and sensitive personality of the book character better than Firth.|$|E
500|$|For {{almost a}} decade, the 1995 TV serial was {{considered}} [...] "so dominant, so universally adored, [...] it has {{lingered in the}} public consciousness as a cinematic standard". Comparing six Pride and Prejudice adaptations in 2005, the Daily Mirror gave 9/10 to the 1995 serial ("what may be the ultimate adaptation") and the 2005 film adaptation, leaving the other adaptations such as the 1940 film behind with six or fewer points. The 2005 film was [...] "obviously [...] daring or revisionist" [...] as the 1995 adaptation but the youth of the film's leads, Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen, was mentioned favourably over the 1995 cast, as Jennifer Ehle had formerly been [...] "a little too 'heavy' for the role". The president of the Jane Austen Society of North America noted in an otherwise positive review that the casting of the 2005 leads was [...] "arguably a little more callow than Firth and Ehle" [...] and that [...] "Knightley is better looking than Lizzy should strictly be". The critical reception of MacFadyen's Darcy, whose casting had proven difficult because [...] "Colin Firth cast a very long shadow", ranged from praise to <b>pleasant</b> <b>surprise</b> and dislike. Several critics did not observe any significant impact of Macfadyen's Darcy in the following years. Garth Pearce of The Sunday Times noted in 2007 that [...] "Colin Firth will forever {{be remembered as the}} perfect Mr. Darcy", and Gene Seymour stated in a 2008 Newsday article that Firth was [...] "'universally acknowledged' as the definitive Mr. Darcy".|$|E
40|$|The policy {{implications}} of this approach are threefold. First, engagement by practitioners with scholars specialising in the regions is necessary to understand what other key players want. Second, a global approach does not mean idealisation of "the other". Hand in hand with such a study may sometimes come {{a recognition of the}} red lines, and an admission of irreconciliable differences for policy. Finally, grand polarised representations may not have helped policy-makers in the past.
