50|$|The {{third and}} final <b>programme</b> <b>priority</b> is {{environment}} and risk prevention. The Alpine space is known {{all over the world}} for its rich landscapes, cultural heritage and biodiversity. The natural environment and the natural heritage as a fundament for the living conditions and the economy therefore have to be protected. Integrated approaches to plan, manage and develop these resources can contribute to this. The programme therefore wants the operations under this priority to be focused on the management and safeguard of environmental resources and cultural heritage as well as on natural and technological hazards. Furthermore, the Alps are much earlier and more strongly affected by the climate change than the rest of Europe. Coping with the various effects of climate change and its related impacts on settlement, infrastructure, cultural heritage and human life is a key challenge for the Alpine Space.|$|E
50|$|The second <b>programme</b> <b>priority</b> {{concerns}} accessibility and connectivity. The Alpine Space {{is both a}} {{centre of}} a dynamic economy and a transit area in a sensitive environment. At {{the same time it}} shows particular constraints in the fields of transport, communication and knowledge infrastructure. It faces natural constraints as regards accessibility and connectivity. The access to these public services however is crucial {{in order to meet the}} requirements of today’s labour markets. For these reasons the Alpine Space Programme aims to secure and improve fair access to public services in the Alpine regions. With this priority the programme aims to improve the quality of transport of passengers and goods while mitigating the negative effects of traffic. Moreover, sustainable solutions should be found to help the local population to be better connected to wider networks. Therefore, the programme promotes joint actions which take into consideration integrated planning of transport and mobility, or ICT-based innovative public services for citizens and economy.|$|E

50|$|One of the Alpine Space <b>Programme’s</b> <b>priorities</b> in {{the funding}} period 2007-2013 is {{to enhance the}} {{attractiveness}} and competitiveness of the alpine region. Although the Alpine area is characterised by a rich and diversified economic structure with strong links to the territory and a well-developed polycentric urban system, low internal innovation capacities of SMEs, urban sprawl and depopulation reduce its competitiveness and attractiveness. In this context the challenge lies in strengthening the innovation capabilities of SMEs, in creating good environments {{for the development of}} SMEs and in fostering stable cooperation between R&TC centers and SMEs. Development options posed by traditional sectors and the cultural heritage are to be used more intensely.|$|R
