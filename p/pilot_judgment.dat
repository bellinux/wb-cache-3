40|$|An {{analysis}} of accident statistics reveals that over 50 % of pilot-caused civil aviation acci-dent fatalities {{are the result}} of faulty <b>pilot</b> <b>judgment.</b> Although the FAA requires examiners to evaluate <b>pilot</b> <b>judgment,</b> it provides no definition or criteria against which such an evalua-tion can be made. In spite of the statistics implicating <b>pilot</b> <b>judgment</b> in many aviation fatalities, attempts to teach it are almost nonexistent. It is but a slight overstatement to say that good <b>pilot</b> <b>judgment</b> is learned by the lucky and the cautious over many years of varied flying experiences.

40|$|Pilot decisional errors {{have always}} been a {{significant}} factor in aviation accidents. <b>Pilot</b> <b>judgment,</b> however, traditionally has been viewed as an intrinsic quality or a by-product of flying experience.

Over the past 10 years, initial steps have been taken in Canada and in the United States to validate the effectiveness of <b>pilot</b> <b>judgment</b> training. In this study, the judgment skills of Canadian civilian air cadets who received judgment training both in the classroom and in flight while earning a private pilot license were compared with the skills of a control group of cadets who received conventional training. The judgment skills of all subjects were measured during short, well-structured cross-country "observation flights.

40|$|The Council of Europe's {{enlargement}} rendered {{reforming the}} European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) inevitable. The post- 1998 reforms aimed at transforming the ECtHR into a quasi- constitutional court and enhancing its efficiency. This article {{is concerned with}} one such reform, ‘the <b>pilot</b> <b>judgment</b> mechanism’, and contests the desirability of its application to gross and systematic violations. The article discusses why, contrary to opposing claims, the ECtHR’s judgment in Doğan and Others v Turkey concerning the forced eviction of Kurdish civilians by the Turkish military is a <b>pilot</b> <b>judgment.</b> It then shows why this matters, based on the Court’s İçyer decision which found a compensation law the Turkish government adopted in response to Doğan and Others {{to be an effective}} domestic remedy and rejected 800 - 1, 500 pending cases. Based on empirical research on the implementation of this law, the article argues that in applying the <b>pilot</b> <b>judgment</b> to the Kurdish cases, the ECtHR reduced the notion of ‘effective remedy’ to compensation, overlooking the victims’ demands for truth and justice, and enabled Turkey to continue to commit gross violations with impunity. It concludes that while pilot-judgments might be effective in handling repetitive cases arising from systemic legal problems in post-communist contexts, they should not be applied to conflict or post-conflict cases where the underlying problems are deeply-rooted ethno-political disputes...|$|E

Visual accommodation was continuously measured using an automatic infrared optometer. Experimental variables included approach slope angle, display magnification, visual focus demand (using ophthalmic lenses), and {{presentation of the}} display as either a real (direct view) or a virtual (collimated) image. Aimpoint judgments shifted predictably with actual approach slope and display magnification. Both <b>pilot</b> <b>judgments</b> and measured accommodation interacted with focus demand with real-image displays but not with virtual-image displays.

This came about because of his perception of the value that such a system would have, and because of the encouragement of his colleagues in the United States and England who were familiar with his initial attempts.|$|R
40|$|Situation {{and command}} head-up {{displays}} were evaluated for both standard and two segment noise abatement night visual approaches in a fixed base simulation of a DC- 8 transport aircraft. The situation display provided glide slope and pitch attitude information. The command display provided glide slope information and flight path commands {{to capture a}} 3 deg glide slope. Landing approaches were flown in both zero wind and wind shear conditions. For both standard and noise abatement approaches, the situation display provided greater glidepath accuracy in the initial phase of the landing approaches, whereas the command display was more effective in the final approach phase. Glidepath accuracy was greater for the standard approaches than for the noise abatement approaches in all phases of the landing approach. Most of the pilots preferred the command display and the standard approach. Substantial agreement was found between each <b>pilot's</b> <b>judgment</b> of his performance and his actual performance...|$|R
40|$|As a {{response}} to widespread structural or endemic human rights violations, in 2004 the European Court began to issue pilot judgments, the aim of which was not only to exert further pressure on national authorities to tackle systemic problems, but also to stop the European Court itself being inundated with {{the same types of}} cases. Fashioned out of its own case law, and underpinned by the principle of subsidiarity, the Court has broken new ground with its <b>pilot</b> <b>judgment</b> procedure, both in terms of its diagnosis of the causes of systemic human rights violations, {{and the extent to which}} it is prepared to direct states to legislate, or take other steps, to resolve them. This study (supported by the Leverhulme Trust) analyses the principal characteristics of the <b>pilot</b> <b>judgment</b> procedure and its application in key cases to date.

30|$|To {{illustrate}} how this dynamics {{is present in}} the ECHR, we provide examples of two procedures used by the court to mitigate the overburdeness of the court and that results in cases competing for merit. One procedure is the courts’ use of ‘case law guides’ 5 which is aimed at potential litigants and which sets out to explain the main content of the court’s case law. In these publications, the court refers to its own case law, another practice which may also enforce the rich-get-richer principle by reinforcing the tendency to use case law highlighted in these publications when deciding future cases. Another procedure is the so-called ‘Pilot Judgment Procedure’ 6 which allows the court to dismiss a whole group of cases at a time. Those cases that are referenced in the <b>pilot</b> <b>judgments</b> will be considered more important and will therefore feature as leading principles (Stare Dicta in Oliphant’s terminology) in the Court’s case law.|$|R

40|$|Hazardous attitudes can adverselyaffect a <b>pilot's</b> <b>judgment</b> {{and thus}} impact {{the safety of}} a flight (FAA, 1991). These {{hazardous}} attitudes are antiauthority; impulsivity; invulnerability; macho; and, resignation. Wetmore & Lu (in-press) found hazardous attitudes to be a causal or contributing factor in 86 % of the general aviation accidents involving a fatality. This study reviews certain fundamental tenets and belief systems for each of the major traditional and modern educational philosophies, ideologies and theories. A qualitative determination was made that many of the pedagogies that permeate our educational system have tenets and beliefs can actually exacerbate rather than ameliorate hazardous attitudes. One of the main conclusions of this study is for aviation teachers to constantly examine their personal pedagogical paradigms and remind themselves of four important questions: (a) Do my aviation students have hizirdous attitudes? (b) What are those hazardous attitudes? (c) Does my own personal teaching style ameliorate or exacerbate those hazardous attitudes? (d) How can I change or adapt my teaching strategies to better serve the needs of those student pilots suffering from hazardous attitudes...|$|R
40|$|Weather {{conditions}} are significant hazards impacting the safe and efficient operation of aircraft. In this study, {{a large number}} of pilots were surveyed regarding weather events, and the circumstances associated with those events. Pilots completed a web-based questionnaire containing demographic questions, a risk perception scale, a hazardous events scale, and a <b>pilot</b> <b>judgment</b> scale. The pilots who reported a flight in which they penetrated weather without authorization or were concerned about the weather also completed 53 questions regarding their weather encounter. Usable data were obtained for 364 participants: 144 who reported flying into weather, 114 who experienced a flight on which weather was a concern, and 106 who reported no flights on which weather was entered or was a major concern. Significant differences were evident between the three groups on the measures of <b>pilot</b> <b>judgment,</b> personal minimums, and hazardous events where pilots flying into weather recorded the poorest scores (least conservative minimums, most hazardous events, and poorest judgment). Significant differences were also noted between the two weather groups for a number of circumstances surrounding the events. Compared to the in-weather group, pilots in the near-weather group had acquired greater instrument hours, were older, and {{were more likely to have}} an instrument rating. Their aircraft were more likely to have an autopilot. More pilots in the in-weather group (28 %) reported that they would be much more careful in the future regarding weather, compared to 17 % of the near-weather group.

40|$|For decades, the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) {{has served}} as a bright beacon of hope in the {{international}} human rights regime. Yet, in recent years, a flood of applications threatens to drown the institution entirely. In an effort to stay afloat amid the growing tide of cases, the Court instituted the so-called “pilot judgment procedure,” which seeks to enable the Court to address systemic violations on the domestic level that give rise to large numbers of repetitive applications before the Court by adjudicating an individual case. The technique has been heralded as a bold and innovative response to the problem of repetitive applications, and has achieved a measure of success in stemming the tide of cases. As currently conceived and applied, the <b>pilot</b> <b>judgment</b> procedure is riddled with ambiguities and uncertainties, and it provides insufficient safeguards for the rights of absent applicants. Despite these problems, no one has yet articulated a proposal for ensuring the rights of absent applicants. This Article fills this gap in the literature by proposing that the ECtHR adopt the procedural safeguards enshrined in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, which governs class actions in the United States. Like pilot judgments, class actions seek to achieve a balance between individual rights and the need or judicial efficiency—and the similarities between the procedures have been acknowledged {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic. Thus, the attempts of United States federal judges to assuage the tension between the need for judicial efficiency and the rights of individuals can provide guidance and insight as to how the judges of the ECtHR can balance the need to stem the flood of repetitive applications before it with the need to safeguard the rights of individual absent applicants who will be impacted by the <b>pilot</b> <b>judgment</b> procedure. Such balance is necessary if the ECtHR is to continue vindicating individual rights, staving off systemic human rights abuses, and serving as a model human rights court for other regional and supranational human rights regimes...|$|E
40|$|The Emergency Medical Service (EMS) {{industry}} {{has been the subject}} of several television and newspaper articles (Harvey and Jensen, 1987) which emphasized the negative aspects, (e. g., fatalities and high accident rates), rather than the life saving services performed. Until recently, the accident rate of the EMS {{industry has}} been five times as high as that of other civil helicopters. This high accident rate has been coupled with the dramatic rise in the number of programs. The industry has built from a single service at its inception in 1972, to over 180 in 1987 (Spray, 1987), to the point that 93 percent of the contiguous U. S. is now covered by some type of EMS service. These factors prompted the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) to study the accidents that occurred between May 11, 1978 and December 3, 1986 (NTSB, 1988). The NTSB report concluded that 'Sound <b>pilot</b> <b>judgment</b> is central to safe flight operations. ' They further stated that ' [...] . factors unique to EMS helicopter operations [...] such as the influence of the mission itself, program competition, and EMS program management perspectives [...] can drastically influence <b>pilot</b> <b>judgment</b> during the EMS mission. ' One of the most difficult decisions that a pilot must make is whether to accept or decline a mission. A pre-flight risk assessment system (SAFE) was developed at NASA-Ames Research Center for civil EMS operations to aid pilots in making this decision objectively. The ability of the SAFE system to predict mission risk profiles was tested at an EMS facility. The results of this field study demonstrated that the usefulness of SAFE was highly dependent on the type of mission flown. SAFE is now being modified so that it can 'learn' with each mission flown. For example, after flying a mission to a particular site, an EMS pilot would input information about this mission into the system, such as new buildings, wires, or approach procedures. Then, the next time a pilot flew a similar mission or one to the same area, this additional information would be taken into account in computing a risk assessment...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Flight into {{adverse weather}} {{continues}} to be a significant hazard for General Aviation (GA) pilots. Weather-related crashes have a significantly higher fatality rate than other GA crashes. Previous research has identified lack of situational awareness, risk perception, and risk tolerance as possible explanations for why pilots would continue into adverse weather. However, very {{little is known about the}} nature of these encounters or the differences between pilots who avoid adverse weather and those who do not. Methods: Visitors to a web site described an experience with adverse weather and completed a range of measures of personal characteristics. Results: The resulting data from 364 pilots were carefully screened and subject to a discriminant function analysis. Two significant functions were found. The first, accounting for 69 % of the variance, reflected measures of risk awareness and <b>pilot</b> <b>judgment</b> while the second differentiated pilots in terms of their experience levels.

40|$|Women’s Conventions, {{endorsing}} {{and approach}} {{based on the}} recognition of structural discriminatory social patterns and cultural practices, have been adopted in the Universal System, with limited national impact, and in the Regional ones. Such systems present different structures, conditions and resources, which contribute to determine the conditions for plausibility of the rights enshrined. The Inter-­ American System adopted the Belém do Pará Convention (BdPC) back in 1994, nevertheless, it largely failed to attract attention in legal scholarship, particularly in Western countries. We argue that, given its high degree of comparability with the European System, analysis of such experience provides valuable informative material to shape a European response. Our first objective is, hence, to analyse the process of internalisation of the BdPC in the Inter-­‐American System. Analysing Inter-­‐American Institution’s case law on VAW since 1994 {{and the evolution of}} relevant national legislation in the region, we find evidence of the role of a coalition of civil society organisations and scholars’ in compensating Inter-­‐American Institutions’ lack of previous experience wit gendered analyses, enabling an incremental learning process and triggering BdPC full justiciability, initially unclear due to BdPC ambiguous wording. At the same time, the availability of authoritative precedents to hold before national governments in a relatively culturally homogeneous context enhanced national implementation of regionally constructed principles and standards, harmonised with those of the Universal System. The IACrtHR plays a crucial interpretive function, clarifying the implications of an inherently incomplete instrument in concrete cases. On the basis of the identification of early setbacks, we suggest a reform of the IACommHR filtering function, which should be limited to the evaluation of petitions’ admissibility and to coordinate the availability of crucial contextual information. This function should be performed with the support of Inter-­‐ American Commission of Women’s expertise. Such procedural reform would improve analyses of complex cases emerging from intersectionality and cultural diversity, still unsatisfactorily developed. Our second, and consequent, objective is to use our findings to identify a generalizable method to ensure women’s rights plausibility. We argue that both ECrtHR’s case law and CoE Member States’ legislations on VAW are still at an early stage. However, the Istanbul Convention does not grant the ECrtHR competence on the protection mechanism established. On the basis of our findings, we argue the need to reconsider ECrtHR role with respect to the Istanbul Convention and present a concrete proposal to guarantee the feasibility of its contentious jurisdiction, avoiding further clogging-­‐up, valorising the recently introduced <b>Pilot</b> <b>Judgment</b> Procedure and the specific expertise provided by GREVIO...|$|E
40|$|Focusing on {{establishing}} {{and maintaining a}} stabilized approach and landing {{is a great way}} to avoid experiencing a loss of control. A stabilized approach is one in which the pilot establishes and maintains a constant angle glidepath towards a predetermined point on the landing runway. It is based on the <b>pilot’s</b> <b>judgment</b> of certain visual clues, and depends on the maintenance of a constant final descent airspeed and configuration. Whether you’re a CFI, a student pilot, or anything in between the GAJSC’s Loss of Control Working Group has some teaching points to help brush up on stabilized approach and landing techniques. One area where airmen seem to be experiencing loss of control is while flying in the pattern. A key factor may be crossed flight controls exacerbated by the effect of wind during the turn from base to final. Pilots tend to over shoot the extended centerline and increase bank to realign with the runway. This bank is combined with increased back pressure which is needed to maintain the desired descent rate. The increased bank and back pressure can put the airplane dangerously close to exceeding the critial angle of attack. To prevent this there are a few things we can do. Create your own personalized guidelines for a stabilized approach based on your skill and your aircraft (i. e. approach speeds, wind limits, a predetermined point to be stabilized on final). Next, take care to note the winds around the airport and consider how they will affect your pattern and approach. Also, try to get the aircraft properly configured for landing as early in the approach as practical. Next, try to focus on making small corrections to get on and stay on final. Also, set a point on the approach by which time you should be at a predetermined speed and altitude. Finally, if something’s not right, at any time, GO AROUND!

The two-stage elicitation addressed uncertainties in both a base case VSL for a reduction in mortality risk from traumatic accidents and in benefits transferrelated adjustments to the base case for an air quality application (e. g., adjustments for age, income, and health status). Results for each expert were integrated to develop example quantitative probabilistic uncertainty distributions for VSL that could be incorporated into air quality models...|$|R
40|$|A piloted {{simulation}} {{study has}} been conducted to evaluate two methods of presenting attitude information in a helmet-mounted display (HMD) for spatial awareness in a fighter airplane. One method, the body-axis concept, displayed the information relative to the body axis of the airplane. The quantitative {{results of this study}} favored the body-axis concept. Although no statistically significant differences were noted for either the pilots' understanding of roll attitude or target position, the <b>pilots</b> made pitch <b>judgment</b> errors three times more often with the conformal display. The subjective results showed the body-axis display did not cause attitude confusion, a prior concern with this display. In the posttest comments, the pilots overwhelmingly selected the body-axis display as the display of choice...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Decision {{theory or}} {{the process of}} {{decision}} making is an approach for problem solving. In the aeronautical dimension, especially in some exact cases such as emergency {{the most important thing}} is to make decision in a short time. Ability to make good decision can be developed by training but it cannot be said that all the good decision-makers have received training. In some cases, decision-makers make good decisions in the light of their experience and observations. Naturalistic Decision-Making may be used by pilots at decision points. If a pilot carries out good decision-making process, the risk of flight will be reduced. The ability to make a good decision is based upon good judgment. Various factors may affect <b>judgment.</b> <b>Pilots</b> must be aware of the situation and changes that occur around them...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} a cockpit display of traffic {{information}} (CDTI) was developed for use in later full mission simulator evaluations of the CDTI concept. Pilots chose their preferred method of displaying air traffic information for several variables. Variables included: type of background, update rate, update type, predictor type, and history type. Each pilot designed a display he felt would be most useful in flight operations. After a series of test trials, each pilot was {{given the opportunity to}} modify the display for the experimental task. For a second day of testing, they repeated the experimental task using their display as well as displays chosen by other pilots. Results indicated a variety of individual preferences in symbology and differences in the accuracy of <b>judgments.</b> <b>Pilots</b> indicated concern for clutter of the display, relationship of the displayed symbology to physical reality, and a need to perceive the relative motion of the intruder aircraft. Analysis of data indicated that pilots were able to improve their performance with practice...|$|R
40|$|The Institute of Medicine report 2 ̆ 2 To Err is Human, 2 ̆ 2 {{released}} in late 1999, {{raised the issue}} of human error in medicine to a new level of attention. This study examines the frequency, severity, and type (FST) of errors associated with postoperative surgical complications at a tertiary care, university-based medical center, addressing the intersection of three domains: patient safety, graduate medical education, and simulation-based training. The study develops and validates a classification system for medical error that is specific to surgery, affirming reliability internally and externally. Baseline data on the FST of errors is collected over a 12 -month period. A hybrid, simulation based training session is developed, validated, and applied to a cohort of surgical residents, focusing on the three most common types of errors identified from <b>pilot</b> data, namely <b>judgment</b> error, incomplete understanding of the problem, and inattention to detail, all human factor errors. The impact of the training is evaluated by measuring the FST of errors occurring during the 6 -month period following the training sessions. The study demonstrates that there is a continuous decrement in the incidence of postoperative complications and a proportional decrease in error, which starts {{at the beginning of the}} baseline data collection and continues linearly throughout the 12 baseline months and subsequent 6 post-training months. There is no additional decrement in the rate of change following training, and no change in the rate of the index errors following the training. This study suggests that surgical error is frequent (3 ̆e 2...|$|R
