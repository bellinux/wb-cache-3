5|$|NWOBHM bands {{had been}} touring {{steadily}} in the United States, {{but had not}} yet received enough FM radio airplay there to make a significant impression on American charts. Def Leppard remedied that, releasing <b>Pyromania</b> {{at the beginning of}} 1983, an album with a more melodic and FM-friendly approach in comparison with the more aggressive sound of their earlier music. The band's goal of reaching a wider international audience, which included many female fans, was attained completely in the US, where <b>Pyromania</b> peaked at No.2 on the Billboard 200 chart behind Michael Jackson's Thriller. Thanks to a string of hit singles and the heavy rotation of their music videos on the recently launched MTV, the album had sold more than six millions copies in the US by 1984 and made Def Leppard superstars. The overwhelming international success of <b>Pyromania</b> induced both American and British bands to follow Def Leppard's example, giving a decisive boost to the more commercial and melodic glam metal and heralding the end of the NWOBHM.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pyromania</b> is {{characterized}} by impulsive and repetitive urges to deliberately start fires.|$|E
25|$|In Beavis and Butt-Head Do America, Beavis is {{reunited with}} his {{biological}} father, who seems to exhibit the same <b>pyromania</b> obsession as Beavis, {{as well as an}} overt physical resemblance. He {{is said to be a}} drifter and a one-time roadie for rock band Mötley Crüe. However, they remain oblivious of their father-son relationship and part ways before they make the connection.|$|E
25|$|Because of its nature, {{the number}} of studies {{performed}} for fire-setting are understandably very few. However studies done on children and adolescents suffering from <b>pyromania</b> have reported its prevalence to be between 2.4%-3.5% in the United States. It has also been observed {{that the incidence of}} fire-setting is more common in juvenile and teenage boys than girls of the same age.|$|E
500|$|Def Leppard's <b>Pyromania,</b> later {{certified}} 10x platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), reached {{number two}} on the Billboard 200. The singles [...] "Foolin'", [...] "Photograph", and [...] "Rock of Ages", helped {{by the emergence of}} MTV, reached the Top 40. Pyromanias style was widely emulated, particularly by the emerging Californian scene. However, remarked Leppard's Joe Elliott, [...] "I don't know how anybody could confuse us with that lot. We weren't even around when all those so-called glam bands came up. We were in fuckin' Holland making Hysteria. While they were out banging chicks or whatever, we were looking at windmills and playing pool on a table without any pockets. We were as far away from LA as any band could be." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the wake}} of the new wave of British heavy metal and Judas Priest's {{breakthrough}} British Steel (1980), heavy metal became increasingly popular in the early 1980s. Many metal artists benefited from the exposure they received on MTV, which began airing in 1981—sales often soared if a band's videos screened on the channel. Def Leppard's videos for <b>Pyromania</b> (1983) made them superstars in America and Quiet Riot became the first domestic heavy metal band to top the Billboard chart with Metal Health (1983). One of the seminal events in metal's growing popularity was the 1983 US Festival in California, where the [...] "heavy metal day" [...] featuring Ozzy Osbourne, Van Halen, Scorpions, Mötley Crüe, Judas Priest, and others drew the largest audiences of the three-day event.|$|E
500|$|... 1983 was the {{breakout}} {{year for}} glam metal: Quiet Riot's Metal Health {{was the first}} glam metal album, and arguably the first heavy metal album, to reach {{number one in the}} Billboard charts. It helped open the doors for mainstream success by subsequent metal bands. Additionally, Night Ranger's second album in 1983 Midnight Madness was also a breakthrough that included the top five single [...] "Sister Christian". Also, in 1983, a larger wave of glam metal albums began appearing; Mötley Crüe released its second album Shout at the Devil, Def Leppard released its third album <b>Pyromania,</b> [...] 'Kix released its second album Cool Kids, Lita Ford released her initial album Out for Blood, and the band Kiss released its glam-sounding Lick It Up.|$|E
500|$|Often {{categorised}} {{with the}} new wave of British heavy metal, in 1981 Def Leppard released their second album High 'n' Dry, mixing glam-rock with heavy metal, and helping to define the sound of hard rock for the decade. The follow-up <b>Pyromania</b> (1983), reached number two on the American charts and the singles [...] "Photograph", [...] "Rock of Ages" [...] and [...] "Foolin'", helped by the emergence of MTV, all reached the Top 40. It was widely emulated, particularly by the emerging Californian glam metal scene. This was followed by US acts like Mötley Crüe, with their albums Too Fast for Love (1981) and Shout at the Devil (1983) and, as the style grew, the arrival of bands such as Ratt, White Lion, Twisted Sister and Quiet Riot. Quiet Riot's album Metal Health (1983) was the first glam metal album, and arguably the first heavy metal album of any kind, to reach number one in the Billboard music charts and helped open the doors for mainstream success by subsequent bands.|$|E
500|$|The {{mounting}} {{pressure to}} appeal to a mainstream audience, the quick change of tastes in British rock fans with the decline of the NWOBHM phenomenon and the chance to have a breakthrough in the US market prompted Girlschool to change their music, starting with the album Screaming Blue Murder in 1982. Their sound, following the success of Def Leppard's album <b>Pyromania,</b> became more polished with the introduction of keyboards on Play Dirty and veered toward hard rock and glam metal, losing the raw edge of their early works. [...] "We were signed to an American label (...) there was a certain amount of pressure exerted on us to sound more American" [...] was McAuliffe explanation, speaking about the tame sound of the album Running Wild. The band appearance also changed to a more feminine and sophisticated style, imitating the successful American glam metal bands of the time and generally following the direction of the market. However, the failed attempt to create a niche for Girlschool in the USA and the rapidly changing record market behaviour made the band change their mind and go back to their original sound, which they retain to this day. Girlschool's members themselves described their music in different ways, from [...] "slapstick rock" [...] to [...] "raucous (...) heavy metal rock 'n' roll", and, even acknowledging the common origin of their music in the NWOBHM, they sometimes found it difficult to associate their songs to a single genre or subgenre of rock music.|$|E

2500|$|The role of impulsivity in the ICDs varies. [...] Research on {{kleptomania}} and <b>pyromania</b> are lacking, {{though there}} is some evidence that greater kleptomania severity is tied to poor executive functioning.|$|E
2500|$|Steve Clark (Def Leppard) Throughout his career, Clark used various Les Pauls, {{including}} a rare Les Paul XR-1 as his main instrument during his <b>Pyromania</b> years, {{as well as}} various Firebirds and EDS-1275 double-necks ...|$|E
2500|$|In addition, Dr. Richard Castillo, as {{quoted by}} Dr. C. George Boeree, {{believes}} that amok (with very similar symptoms to grisi siknis), pibloktoq, latah, [...] "falling out", [...] "indisposition", and the [...] "fits" [...] are all related to impulse control disorders, {{and thus are}} associated with trichotillomania, compulsive gambling, <b>pyromania,</b> and kleptomania in Western medicine.|$|E
2500|$|Behavioral {{interventions}} {{also have}} a fairly strong evidence base in impulse control disorders. In ADHD, the behavioral interventions of behavioral parent training, behavioral classroom management, and intensive peer-focused behavioral interventions in recreational settings meet stringent guidelines qualifying them for evidence based treatment status. In addition, a recent meta-analysis of evidence-based ADHD treatment found organization training to be a well-established treatment method. Empirically validated behavioral treatments for substance use disorder are fairly similar across substance use disorders, and include behavioral couples therapy, CBT, contingency management, motivational enhancement therapy, and relapse prevention. [...] <b>Pyromania</b> and kleptomania are understudied (due {{in large part to}} the illegality of the behaviors), though there is some evidence that psychotherapeutic interventions (CBT, short term counseling, day treatment programs) are efficacious in treating <b>pyromania,</b> while kleptomania seems to be best impacted using SSRIs. [...] Additionally, therapies including CBT, family therapy, and social skill training have shown positive effects on explosive aggressive behaviors.|$|E
2500|$|An American physician, Beard, {{described}} [...] "neurasthenia" [...] in 1869. German neurologist Westphal, {{coined the}} term [...] "obsessional neurosis" [...] now termed obsessive-compulsive disorder, and agoraphobia. Alienists created a whole new series of diagnoses that highlighted single, impulsive behavior, such as kleptomania, dipsomania, <b>pyromania,</b> and nymphomania. The diagnosis of drapetomania was also developed in the Southern United States to explain the perceived irrationality of black slaves trying to escape what {{was thought to be}} a suitable role.|$|E
2500|$|Def Leppard {{was formed}} in 1977 by vocalist Joe Elliott, bass player Rick [...] "Sav" [...] Savage, guitarist Pete Willis, and drummer Tony Kenning. They later {{released}} the EP The Def Leppard E.P. in 1979. The band signed with Mercury Records and released their debut full-length album On Through the Night. The band's follow up was High 'n' Dry, which reached number 26 in the UK and was certified platinum two times in the United States. Their next album, titled <b>Pyromania,</b> would be their big breakthrough album and would later sell more than 20'000 copies <b>Pyromania,</b> the band released Hysteria which topped the American and British album charts and is their best-selling album worldwide, selling more than 12 million copies in the United States alone and over 25 million worldwide. Adrenalize, released in 1992, debuted at {{number one on the}} UK Album Chart and the US Billboard 200 and launched several successful singles, including [...] "Let's Get Rocked" [...] and [...] "Make Love Like a Man" [...] and went on to sell 4 million albums worldwide. In 1996, the band released its sixth studio album, Slang; while successful, the album could not reach the precedent set by Def Leppard's previous albums and was certified gold in the United States. After three years, Def Leppard released Euphoria, which is the band's last certified album by the RIAA, CRIA, and BPI.|$|E
2500|$|A single manic episode, in {{the absence}} of {{secondary}} causes, (i.e., substance use disorder, pharmacologic, general medical condition) is sufficient to diagnose bipolar I disorder. Hypomania may be indicative of bipolar II disorder. [...] Manic episodes are often complicated by delusions and/or hallucinations; should the psychotic features persist for a duration significantly longer than the episode of mania (two weeks or more), a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder is more appropriate. Certain of [...] "obsessive-compulsive spectrum" [...] disorders as well as impulse control disorders share the name [...] "mania," [...] namely, kleptomania, <b>pyromania,</b> and trichotillomania. Despite the unfortunate association implied by the name, however, no connection exists between mania or bipolar disorder and these disorders.|$|E
2500|$|Impulse control {{disorder}} (ICDs) are a {{class of}} DSM diagnoses that do not fall into the other diagnostic categories of the manual (e.g. substance use disorders), and that are characterized by extreme difficulty controlling impulses or urges despite negative consequences. [...] Individuals suffering from an impulse control disorder frequently experience five stages of symptoms: compelling urge or desire, failure to resist the urge, {{a heightened sense of}} arousal, succumbing to the urge (which usually yields relief from tension), and potential remorse or feelings of guilt after the behavior is completed. Specific disorders included within this category include intermittent explosive disorder, kleptomania, pathological gambling, <b>pyromania,</b> trichotillomania (hair pulling disorder), and impulse control disorders not otherwise specified (ICD NOS). ICD NOS includes other significant difficulties that seem to be related to impulsivity but do not meet the criteria for a specific DSM diagnosis.|$|E
2500|$|During the 1970s David Bowie, {{himself of}} a father from Tadcaster in North Yorkshire, hired three musicians from Hull, Mick Ronson, Trevor Bolder and Mick Woodmansey; {{together}} they recorded Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars, an album considered by a magazine article {{as one of a}} 100 greatest and most influential of all time. In the following decade, Def Leppard, from Sheffield, achieved worldwide fame, particularly in America. Their 1983 album <b>Pyromania</b> and 1987 album Hysteria are among the most successful albums of all time. Yorkshire had a very strong post-punk scene which went on to achieve widespread acclaim and success, including; The Sisters of Mercy, The Cult, Vardis, Gang of Four, ABC, The Human League, New Model Army, Soft Cell, Chumbawamba, The Wedding Present and The Mission. Pulp from Sheffield had a massive hit in [...] "Common People" [...] during 1995; the song focuses on working-class northern life. In 21st century, indie rock and post-punk revival bands from the area gained popularity, including the Kaiser Chiefs, The Cribs and the Arctic Monkeys, the last-named holding the record for the fastest-selling debut album in British music history with Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not.|$|E
50|$|Pathological fire-setting, <b>pyromania,</b> is {{when the}} desire to set fires is {{repetitive}} and destructive to people or property. The most important difference between <b>pyromania</b> and fire-setting is that <b>pyromania</b> is a mental disorder, but fire-setting is simply a behavior and can be more easily fixed.|$|E
50|$|Early studies {{into the}} causes of <b>pyromania</b> come from Freudian psychoanalysis. Around 1850, there were many {{arguments}} about {{the causes of}} <b>pyromania.</b>|$|E
50|$|Most young {{children}} are not diagnosed as having <b>pyromania</b> but rather conduct disorders. A key feature of <b>pyromania</b> is repeated association with fire but without a real motive. <b>Pyromania</b> is a very rare disorder and only occurs in about {{one percent of the}} population. It can occur in children as young as three years old.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Pyromania</b> {{was thought}} in the 1800s to be a concept {{involved}} with moral insanity and moral treatment, but had not been categorized under impulse control disorders. <b>Pyromania</b> {{is one of the}} four recognized types of arson: for profit, to cover up an act of crime, for revenge, and <b>pyromania.</b> <b>Pyromania</b> is the second most common type of arson. Common synonyms for pyromaniacs in colloquial English include firebug (US) and fire raiser (UK), but these also refer to arsonists. <b>Pyromania</b> is a rare disorder with an incidence of less than one percent in most studies; also, pyromaniacs hold a very small proportion of psychiatric hospital admissions [...] <b>Pyromania</b> can occur in children as young as age three, though such cases are rare. Only a small percentage of children and teenagers arrested for arson are child pyromaniacs. A preponderance of the individuals are male; one source states that ninety percent of those diagnosed with <b>pyromania</b> are male. Based on a survey of 9,282 Americans using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, impulse-control problems such as gambling, <b>pyromania</b> and compulsive shopping collectively affect 9% of the population [...] A 1979 study by the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration found that only 14% of fires were started by pyromaniacs and others with mental illness [...] A 1951 study by Lewis and Yarnell, one of the largest epidemiological studies conducted, found that 39% of those who had intentionally set fires had been diagnosed with <b>pyromania.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Pyromania</b> is {{an impulse}} control {{disorder}} {{in which individuals}} repeatedly fail to resist impulses to deliberately start fires, in order to relieve tension or for instant gratification. The term <b>pyromania</b> comes from the Greek word πῦρ (pyr, fire). <b>Pyromania</b> is distinct from arson, the deliberate setting of fires for personal, monetary or political gain. Pyromaniacs start fires to induce euphoria, and often fixate on institutions of fire control like fire houses and firemen. <b>Pyromania</b> {{is a type of}} impulse control disorder, along with kleptomania, intermittent explosive disorder and others.|$|E
50|$|Even though fire {{setting and}} <b>pyromania</b> are more {{prevalent}} in children these standards are hard to apply to their age group. There {{is not a lot}} of experience in diagnosing <b>pyromania</b> mainly because of the little experience that health care professionals have with fire setting.|$|E

5000|$|There are {{specific}} symptoms that separate pyromaniacs {{from those who}} start fires for criminal purposes or due to emotional motivations not specifically related to fire.

When around fires, a person suffering from <b>pyromania</b> gains intense interest or fascination and may also experience pleasure, gratification or relief [...] Another long term contributor often linked with <b>pyromania</b> is the buildup of stress. When studying the lifestyle of someone with <b>pyromania,</b> a buildup of stress and emotion is often evident and this is seen in teens' attitudes towards friends and family [...] At times it is difficult to distinguish the difference between <b>pyromania</b> and experimentation in childhood because both involve pleasure from the fire.|$|E
