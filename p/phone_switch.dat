5|$|In 1997, TouchWave was {{a privately}} held, venture-backed startup company in Palo Alto, California, with future {{entrepreneur}} Oliver Muoto as its marketing director. Co-founded by CEO Bo Larsson, Jeff Snider, David F. Wittenkamp, and Jesper Stroe, TouchWave released its first product, WebSwitch, in 1997. WebSwitch, a Web-based <b>phone</b> <b>switch,</b> provided telephony over IP and targeted small to medium-sized businesses and branch networks of larger organizations. The WebSwitch {{was designed to}} deliver significantly lower costs for communications, ease of management and administration and offered services on a single IP-based network platform. The timing of TouchWave's late 1997 release of its <b>phone</b> <b>switch</b> product matched Level 3's development of its first softswitch, a method to connect calls from one phone line to another without a need to use traditional hardware.|$|E

50|$|However, the {{crossbar}} switch does {{so at the}} expense of using N2 (N squared) simple SPST switches. For large N (and the practical requirements of a <b>phone</b> <b>switch</b> are considered large) this growth was too expensive. Further, large {{crossbar switch}}es had physical problems. Not only did the switch require too much space, but the metal bars containing the switch contacts would become so long that they would sag and become unreliable. Engineers also noticed that at any time, each bar of a crossbar switch was only making a single connection. The other contacts on the two bars were unused. This seemed to imply that most of the switching fabric of a crossbar switch was wasted.|$|E
50|$|Lucent used Inferno in {{at least}} two {{internal}} products: the Lucent VPN Firewall Brick, and the Lucent Pathstar <b>phone</b> <b>switch.</b> They initially tried to sell source code licenses of Inferno but found few buyers. Lucent did little marketing and missed the importance of the Internet and Inferno's relation to it. During the same time Sun Microsystems was heavily marketing its own Java programming language, which was targeting a similar market, with analogous technology, that worked in web browsers and also filled the demand for object-oriented languages popular at that time. Lucent licensed Java from Sun, claiming that all Inferno devices would be made to run Java. A Java byte code to Dis byte code translator was written to facilitate that. However, Inferno still did not find customers.|$|E

40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} of this thesis is to investigate the behavioral changes regarding consumers' mobile phone switching intentions. Specifically, {{the aim is to}} identify the most important reasons determining the switch from one service platform to another and to observe longitudinal shift patterns in this behavior. Different stakeholder perspectives will be taken into account in order to form a comprehensive view on the topic. Methodology: The methodological approach has been set to a qualitative inductive format. The main strength of this approach is that it utilizes empirical findings for building theoretical contribution instead of focusing on mere theory testing. The research focuses on the Finnish consumer sector and the research data was collected during two consecutive years. Findings: The mobile <b>phone</b> <b>switch</b> is typically based on multiple reasons and selection criteria. The success of a mobile brand is not determined by the popularity gained in the technology acceptance stage. Based on the empirical evidence, functional, design, performance and usability related reasons were the most important factors influencing the selection of a mobile phone. The switch occurs most likely because of rational and inevitable reasons. With regard to longitudinal findings, changes could be observed in terms of satisfaction and dissatisfaction with devices owned and in terms of estimations of the past and future switch questions. Shifts in the longitudinal findings were not drastic, but could be expected to shed light on the future development within the industry...|$|E
40|$|For years, legal {{wiretapping}} was straightforward: {{the officer}} doing the intercept connected {{a tape recorder}} or the like to {{a single pair of}} wires. By the 1990 s, however, the changing structure of telecommunications—there was no longer just “Ma Bell” to talk to—and new technologies such as ISDN and cellular telephony made executing a wiretap more complicated for law enforcement. Simple technologies would no longer suffice. In response, Congress passed the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA) which mandated a standardized lawful intercept interface on all local phone switches. Since its passage, technology has continued to progress, and in the face of new forms of communication—Skype, voice chat during multiplayer online games, instant messaging, etc. —law enforcement is again experiencing problems. The FBI has called this “Going Dark”: their loss of access to suspects’ communication. According to news reports, law enforcement wants changes to the wiretap laws to require a CALEA-like interface in Internet software. CALEA, though, has its own issues: it is complex software specifically intended to create a security hole—eavesdropping capability—in the already-complex environment of a <b>phone</b> <b>switch.</b> It has unfortunately made wiretapping easier for everyone, not just law enforcement. Congress failed to heed experts’ warnings of the danger posed by this mandated vulnerability, and time has proven the experts right. The so-called “Athens Affair,” where someone used the built-in lawful intercept mechanism to listen to the cell phone calls of high Greek officials, including the Prime Minister, is but one example. In an earlier work, we showed why extending CALEA to the Internet would create very serious problems, including the security problems it has visited on the phone system. In this paper, we explore the viability and implications of an alternative method for addressing law enforcements need to access communications: legalized hacking of target devices through existing vulnerabilities in end-user software and platforms. The FBI already uses this approach on a small scale; we expect that its use will increase, especially as centralized wiretapping capabilities become less viable. Relying on vulnerabilities and hacking poses a large set of legal and policy questions, some practical and some normative. Among these are: (1) Will it create disincentives to patching? (2) Will there be a negative effect on innovation? (Lessons from the so-called “Crypto Wars” of the 1990 s, and in particular the debate over export controls on cryptography, are instructive here.) (3) Will law enforcement’s participation in vulnerabilities purchasing skew the market? (4) Do local and even state law enforcement agencies have the technical sophistication to develop and use exploits? If not, how should this be handled? A larger FBI role? (5) Should law enforcement even be participating in a market where many of the sellers and other buyers are themselves criminals? (6) What happens if these tools are captured and repurposed by miscreants? (7) Should we sanction otherwise illegal network activity to aid law enforcement? (8) Is the probability of success from such an approach too low for it to be useful? As we will show, these issues are indeed challenging. We regard the issues raised by using vulnerabilities as, on balance, preferable to adding more complexity and insecurity to online systems...|$|E

40|$|Why {{do people}} <b>switch</b> their mobile <b>phones?</b> What factors make them {{to stick with}} their current phones? This thesis' {{objective}} {{is to find out}} the influences behind consumer mobile <b>phone</b> <b>switching</b> behavior. Academic literature has examined mobile <b>phone</b> <b>switching</b> surprisingly little since the focus has been on mobile phone related adoption research. This thesis aims to fill that gap of lacking mobile <b>phone</b> <b>switching</b> behavior research. An inductive approach is applied on a qualitative data set that was collected from 249 university students from three different continents to determine the consumer expressed reasons to switch and not to <b>switch</b> mobile <b>phones.</b> The results are organized based on consumer responses and examined in the light of PPM framework as well as mirrored to the established adoption literature such as the technology acceptance model and diffusion of innovations framework. The findings suggest that mobile phones of any sort are increasingly switched to smartphones. The main reasons pushing people to <b>switch</b> mobile <b>phones</b> were identified as rational reasons such as dissatisfaction with reliability and advanced functionalities of the device being switched from along with external forced influences. The main reasons pulling towards attractive alternatives were identified as personal desires, advanced functionalities and subjectively perceived factors again along with external social influences. Additionally, brand influence and price value perceptions were pinpointed as pulling clearly towards smartphone adoption. The main elements preventing individuals from wanting to <b>switch</b> their mobile <b>phones</b> were determined as attachment to familiar advanced functionalities and subjectively perceived factors. In a general level, the pull effect is the strongest force leading to switching and the principal causes for this pull effect stem from associations to functional elements of the mobile phones...|$|R
