For this reason, a LARP GM's role is often less concerned with tightly maintaining a narrative or directly entertaining the <b>players,</b> <b>and</b> more with arranging the structure of the LARP before play begins and facilitating the <b>players</b> <b>and</b> crew to maintain the fictional environment during play.|$|E
