5|$|Ewbank {{learned of}} the {{television}} problems {{in the locker room}} when he received a telephone call from his wife congratulating him on a Jets victory – Lucy Ewbank assumed the fact {{that the end of the}} game was not shown meant New York had won. Her husband profanely informed her of the game result. She was not the only Jets relative deceived – cornerback Johnny Sample flew back east after the game on personal business, and when his father <b>picked</b> <b>him</b> up at Philadelphia International Airport, he congratulated his son on a Jets triumph.|$|E
5|$|Following {{a tour of}} New Zealand, in 1946 he was {{selected}} by the New Zealand Rugby Almanac {{as one of its}} five players of the year. The magazine Sporting Life <b>picked</b> <b>him</b> in its All Australian team in five years 1947, 1948, 1949, 1951 and 1952. After being named in Australian rugby's team of the century in 1999, he was given a plaque on the Sydney Cricket Ground's Walk of Honour. In 2005 he was honoured as one of the inaugural five inductees into the Australian Rugby Union Hall of Fame, and in 2013 was named as an inaugural inductee in Inside Rugbys Invincibles.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{was born}} in Silsbee, Texas. As a child, {{he was a big}} wrestling fan and André the Giant was his {{favorite}} wrestler. While attending a wrestling show in Beaumont, Texas, young Henry tried to touch André as he was walking down the aisle, but tripped over the barricade. André <b>picked</b> <b>him</b> up out of the crowd and put him back behind the barricade. When Henry was 12 years old, his father, Ernest, died of complications from diabetes. When he was 14 years old, Henry was diagnosed with dyslexia.|$|E

5|$|Levan {{originally}} {{signed with}} the Phillies organization in 1944, then served in World War II after one season. He returned in 1947 and spent two games on the major league roster {{before returning to the}} minor leagues, where he won multiple minor league batting titles. He bounced around in various minor league organizations until 1954, when the Washington Senators <b>picked</b> <b>him</b> up. Levan spent the next two seasons with Washington before spending four years with the Chattanooga Lookouts. While in Chattanooga, Levan became the last person banned by baseball's governing organizations for conspiring to fix games, which ended his professional career.|$|E
5|$|Nelson {{then had}} stints working for KDNT in Denton, Texas, KCUL and KCNC in Fort Worth, Texas, where he hosted The Western Express, taught Sunday school {{and he played}} in nightclubs. He then {{decided to move to}} San Diego. He was unable to find a job, and decided to go to Portland, Oregon, where his mother lived. Nelson tried to hitchhike, but after nobody <b>picked</b> <b>him</b> up, he slept in a ditch. He then found a nearby {{railroad}} yard and boarded a freight train that left him in Eugene. A truck driver then drove Nelson to a bus station and loaned him $10 for a ticket to reach Portland.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the details}} of Hendrix's last day and death are widely disputed, {{he spent much of}} September 17, 1970, in London with Monika Dannemann, the only witness to his final hours. Dannemann said that she {{prepared}} a meal for them at her apartment in the Samarkand Hotel, 22 Lansdowne Crescent, Notting Hill, sometime around 11 p.m., when they shared a bottle of wine. She drove Hendrix to the residence of an acquaintance at approximately 1:45a.m., where he remained for about an hour before she <b>picked</b> <b>him</b> up and drove them back to her flat at 3 a.m. Dannemann said they talked until around 7 a.m., when they went to sleep. She awoke around 11 a.m., and found Hendrix breathing, but unconscious and unresponsive. She called for an ambulance at 11:18a.m., which arrived on the scene at 11:27a.m. Paramedics then transported Hendrix to St Mary Abbot's Hospital where Dr. John Bannister pronounced him dead at 12:45p.m. on September 18, 1970.|$|E

5|$|At Chaminade, {{he led a}} pass-oriented offense and, {{during his}} senior year, {{accumulated}} 139 completions on 265 attempts, 2,047 yards, 16 touchdowns, and 11 interceptions. He {{was named to the}} All-California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) second team as a senior and the All-Mission League team as both a junior and senior. SuperPrep <b>picked</b> <b>him</b> as a Far West all-region selection and PrepStar as an all-region selection. Turner was assessed as a Rivals.com three-star and Scout.com two-star recruit. He received scholarship offers from Boise State, Illinois, Louisville, Maryland, Oregon, Utah, and UTEP. Maryland offered him after another Californian recruit, Josh Portis, chose Florida instead—although Portis later transferred to Maryland and served as a backup alongside Turner. Turner ultimately chose Maryland, which is located just outside Washington, D.C., partly due to his interest in politics.|$|E
5|$|Brashear is the {{youngest}} of three children born to an African-American father, Johnny Brashear, and French Canadian mother, Nicole Gauthier, in Bedford, Indiana. His father was an alcoholic who relentlessly abused his family, including slashing Donald with belts and electrical cords. On one occasion, when Donald was only six months old, he <b>picked</b> <b>him</b> up and hurled him through a window. Nicole, afraid that Johnny might kill her, left the family and returned to Canada. Later, {{she came back to}} take the children, but left Donald to live with his father for another four years, until Donald's paternal grandmother sent him to Canada. Donald's mother later stated that she left him behind because her future husband was prejudiced and wanted to avoid having another mixed-race child in the house.|$|E
5|$|Desmond Jennings {{opened the}} first inning with a single, but was thrown out at second base trying to stretch the hit into a double. Wil Myers then walked, {{advanced}} to third base on singles by Ben Zobrist and Evan Longoria, and finally scored on a sacrifice fly by Delmon Young. Rays starter David Price struck out leadoff batter Ian Kinsler, then allowed a walk to Elvis Andrus but <b>picked</b> <b>him</b> off and finished the inning by retiring Alex Ríos. The score remained 1–0 until {{the top of the}} third inning, when Jennings drew a walk and scored on a home run by Longoria to give the Rays a 3–0 lead. The Rangers struck right back in the bottom half, as Craig Gentry led off the inning with a single. After advancing to second on a Leonys Martín groundout, he scored on a single to right field by Kinsler. The Rays scored again in the sixth, as Longoria doubled to lead off the inning, and advanced to third base on a groundout by Young. The next batter, David DeJesus, hit a double to right field that scored Longoria and put the Rays ahead, 4–1. Rangers reliever Alexi Ogando entered the game with one out and recorded the final two outs to end the inning.|$|E

5|$|Due to the 1994–95 NHL lockout, Anderson went to Europe to play hockey. He {{played with}} the Augsburger Panther of the Deutsche Eishockey Liga in Germany and the Lukko Rauma of the SM-liiga in Finland, {{as well as the}} Canadian National Team. After the {{lock-out}} was resolved, Anderson {{signed as a free agent}} with the St. Louis Blues and played 42 regular season and playoff games combined. At the end of the season, Anderson did not re-sign with the Blues. After playing part of the next season with Augsburger and the National Team again, Anderson signed with the Canucks as a free agent. His reasons for joining the team were because of former Oiler teammate Esa Tikkanen already playing there, and a desire to finish his career in his hometown. However, Anderson never played for the Canucks as the Oilers <b>picked</b> <b>him</b> up on re-entry waivers. Anderson expressed his disappointment at these turn of events, as he wanted to play in Vancouver instead. He spent 17 games with the Oilers, before being put on waivers that same season. The Blues claimed him, and he spent his last days in the NHL with them. The 1996–97 season saw Anderson return to Europe and play with HC La Chaux-de-Fonds of the National League A in Switzerland and with Bolzano HC of the Alpenliga in Italy.|$|E
5|$|During {{his absence}} from the Test team, the Australian {{selectors}} had been unsuccessful {{in their attempts to}} find a reliable partner for Arthur Morris to open the batting. Barnes started the season solidly and, in the last match before the team for the third Test against the West Indies was chosen, he hit 107 against Victoria. The selectors duly <b>picked</b> <b>him</b> for the match, then passed the team list to the Board of Control for ratification. The Board vetoed the inclusion of Barnes and requested the nomination of a replacement player. Unwilling to accept the blame for Barnes's omission, the selectors deliberately deferred their decision on the replacement. When the team was not announced at the scheduled time, journalists uncovered the story and Barnes became a cause célèbre for many weeks, missing all of the remaining Tests. Speculation abounded as to the nature of his supposed misdeeds. These included jumping the turnstile at a ground when he forgot his player's pass; insulting the Royal Family; theft from team-mates; drunkenness; and stealing a car.|$|E
