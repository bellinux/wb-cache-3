The Catalina pilot made {{a normal}} <b>power</b> <b>landing</b> and {{immediately}} applied throttle for take-off. At {{a speed of}} about fifty knots the plane swerved {{to the left and}} then continued into a violent waterloop. The hull of the plane was broken open and the Catalina sank immediately.After the war on March 27, 1949 a PBY-6A Catalina had to make a forced landing during flight from Kwajalein to Johnston Island. The plane was damaged beyond repair and the crew of 11 was rescued nine hours later by a Navy ship which sank the plane by gunfire.During 1958, a proposed support agreement for Navy Seaplane operations at Johnston Island was under discussion though it was never completed because a requirement for the operation failed to materialize.|$|E

40|$|Calculations of {{the heat}} flux carried by plasma {{to the wall of}} a {{magnetic}} fusion machine often assume that power flows only along the field lines, but this cannot be true in general. Instead, we treat the plasma as an anisotropic non-linear thermally conducting medium. The model is physically relevant if parallel and cross-field transport are driven at least in part by temperature gradients, which means they are affected by the proximity of material surfaces. The model generates a familiar asymmetrical power distribution on the divertor target, and divergent heat flux on sharp edges, as described previously. The <b>power</b> <b>landing</b> on a wall that is parallel to the field (identically zero in the conventional model) is a substantial fraction of that landing on the target. The flux profile across the scrape-off layer (SOL) deviates strongly from an exponential, because the parallel heat conduction is very large near the separatrix, giving a much steeper fall-off in that region. When a portion of the wall protrudes into the SOL at a grazing angle, the power striking the inclined surface is several times the value derived by integrating the parallel heat flux calculated {{in the absence of the}} inclined surface. We have also calculated the degree to which the shadowing effect of a first wall component on other parts of the wall falls off with distance - something that cannot even be estimated using the field-line following technique.

40|$|An {{analysis}} {{has been developed}} to model a rotorcraft with power loss. Partial power recovery to a flyaway condition, partial <b>power</b> <b>landing,</b> and autorotation to landing with a complete power loss are considered. An optimal control procedure is implemented to predict the pilot response to the power loss {{with the objective of}} minimizing the horizontal and vertical impact velocities {{in the case of a}} landing and achieving a sustainable steady state flight condition for flyaway. The physical and optimal control models are based on previous work, but have been extended with rate controls and additional constraints to more closely represent the pilot reaction and physics of the helicopter motion. The model is validated for autorotative landings from hover and forward flight initial conditions with data from a high energy rotor system flight test. With appropriate inputs to simulate the flight paths in the test data, good agreement is observed between the optimal control solutions and the test data. An example flyaway case is presented to illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of the current implementation.

40|$|There has {{recently}} been renewed interest {{in the development of}} instrumentation for making measurements on the surface of Mars. This is due to the Mars Environmental Survey (MESUR) Mission, for which approximately 16 small, long-lived (2 - 10 years), relatively inexpensive surface stations will be deployed in a planet-wide network. This will allow the investigation of processes (such as seismology and meteorology) which require the simultaneous measurement of phenomena at many widely spaced locations on the surface over a considerable length of time. Due to the large number of vehicles involved, the mass, power, and cost of the payload will be severely constrained. A seismometer has been identified as one of the highest priority instruments in the MESUR straw-man payload. The requirements for an effective seismic experiment on Mars place a number of constraints on any viable sensor design. First, a large number of sensors must be deployed in a long-lived global network {{in order to be able}} to locate many events reliably, provide good spatial sampling of the interior, and increase the probability of seismic detection in the event of localized seismicity and/or high attenuation. From a practical standpoint, this means that individual surface stations will necessarily be constrained in terms of cost, mass, and <b>power.</b> <b>Landing</b> and thermal control systems will probably be simple, in order to minimize cost, resulting in large impact accelerations and wide daily and seasonal thermal swings. The level of seismic noise will determine the maximum usable sensitivity for seismometer. Unfortunately, the ambient seismic noise level for Mars is not well known. However lunar seismic noise levels are several orders of magnitude below that of the Earth. Sensitivities on the order of 10 (exp - 11) g over a bandwidth of. 04 to 20 Hz are thought to be necessary to fulfill the science objectives for a seimometer placed on the Martian surface. Silicon micromachined sensor technology offers techniques for the fabrication of monolithic, robust, compact, lower power and mass accelerometers. Conventional micro-machined accelerometers have been developed and are commercially available for high frequency and large acceleration measurements. The new seismometer we are developing incorporates certain principles of conventional silicon micromachined accelerometer technology. However, currently available silicon micromachined sensors offer inadequate sensitivity and bandwidth for the Mars seismometer application. Our implementation of an advanced silicon micromachined seismometer is based on principles recently developed at JPL for high-sensitivity position sensor technology...|$|E

40|$|The GEophysical Monitoring Station (GEMS) is a {{proposed}} Discovery-class mission designed {{to fill a}} longstanding gap in the scientific exploration {{of the solar system}} by performing, for the first time, an in-situ investigation of the interior of Mars. This mission would provide unique and critical information about the fundamental processes governing the initial accretion of the planet, the formation and differentiation of its core and crust, and the subsequent evolution of the interior. The scientific goals of GEMS are to understand the formation and evolution of terrestrial planets through investigation of the interior structure and processes of Mars and to determine its present level of tectonic activity and impact flux. A straightforward set of scientific objectives address these goals: 1) Determine the size, composition and physical state of the core; 2) Determine the thickness and structure of the crust; 3) Determine the composition and structure of the mantle; 4) Determine the thermal state of the interior; 5) Measure the rate and distribution of internal seismic activity; and 6) Measure the rate of impacts on the surface. To accomplish these objectives, GEMS carries a tightly-focused payload consisting of 3 investigations: 1) SEIS, a 6 -component, very-broad-band seismometer, with careful thermal compensation/control and a sensitivity comparable to the best terrestrial instruments across a frequency range of 1 mHz to 50 Hz; 2) HP 3 (Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package), an instrumented self-penetrating mole system that trails a string of temperature sensors to measure the planetary heat flux; and 3) RISE (Rotation and Interior Structure Experiment), which uses the spacecraft X-band communication system to provide precision tracking for planetary dynamical studies. The two instruments are moved from the lander deck to the martian surface by an Instrument Deployment Arm, with an appropriate location identified using an Instrument Deployment Camera. In order to ensure low risk within the tight Discovery cost limits, GEMS reuses the successful Lockheed Martin Phoenix spacecraft design, with a cruise and EDL system that has demonstrated capability for safe landing on Mars with well-understood costs. To take full advantage of this approach, all science requirements (such as instrument mass and <b>power,</b> <b>landing</b> site, and downlinked data volume) strictly conform to existing, demonstrated capabilities of the spacecraft and mission system. It is widely believed that multiple landers making simultaneous measurements (a network) are required to address the objectives for understanding terrestrial planet interiors. Nonetheless, comprehensive measurements from a single geophysical station are extremely valuable, because observations constraining the structure and processes of the deep interior of Mars are virtually nonexistent. GEMS will utilize sophisticated analysis techniques specific to single-station measurements to determine crustal thickness, mantle structure, core state and size, and heat flow, providing our first real look deep beneath the surface of Mars...|$|E
