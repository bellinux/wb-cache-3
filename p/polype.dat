60|$|The {{masses of}} coral {{which may be}} formed by the assemblages of polypes which spring by budding, or by dividing, from a single <b>polype,</b> {{occasionally}} attain very considerable dimensions. Such skeletons are sometimes great plates, many feet long and several feet in thickness; or they may form huge half globes, like the brainstone corals, or may reach the magnitude of stout shrubs or even small trees. There {{is reason to believe}} that such masses as these {{take a long time to}} form, and hence that the age a <b>polype</b> tree, or <b>polype</b> turf, may attain, may be considerable. But, sooner or later, the coral polypes, like all other things, die; the soft flesh decays, while the skeleton is left as a stony mass at the bottom of the sea, where it retains its integrity for a longer or a shorter time, according as its position affords more or less protection from the wear and tear of the waves.|$|E

60|$|The {{progress}} of discovery, since Réaumur's time, {{has made us}} very completely acquainted with the structure and habits of all these polypes. We know that, among the sea-anemones and coral-forming animals, each <b>polype</b> has a mouth leading to a stomach, which is open at its inner end, and thus communicates freely with the general cavity of the body; that the tentacles placed round the mouth are hollow, and that they perform the part of arms in seizing and capturing prey. It is known {{that many of these}} creatures are capable of being multiplied by artificial division, the divided halves growing, after a time, into complete and separate animals; and that many are able to perform a very similar process naturally, in such a manner that one <b>polype</b> may, by repeated incomplete divisions, give rise to a sort of sheet, or turf, formed by innumerable connected, and yet independent, descendants. Or, what is still more common, a <b>polype</b> may throw out buds, which are converted into polypes, or branches bearing polypes, until a tree-like mass, sometimes of very considerable size, is formed.|$|E

60|$|This is {{what happens}} {{in the case of the}} red coral of commerce. A minute <b>polype,</b> fixed to the rocky bottom of the deep sea, grows up into a {{branched}} trunk. The end of every branch and twig is terminated by a polype; and all the polypes are connected together by a fleshy substance, traversed by innumerable canals which place each <b>polype</b> in communication with every other, and carry nourishment to the substance of the supporting stem. It is a sort of natural co-operative store, every <b>polype</b> helping the whole, at the same time as it helps itself. The interior of the stem, like that of the branches, is solidified by the deposition of carbonate of lime in its tissue, somewhat in the same fashion as our own bones are formed of animal matter impregnated with lime salts; and it is this dense skeleton (usually turned deep red by a peculiar colouring matter) cleared of the soft animal investment, as the heart-wood of a tree might be stripped of its bark, which is the red coral.|$|E
60|$|In {{the case}} of the white coral, the {{skeleton}} is more complete. In the red coral, the skeleton belongs to the whole; in the white coral there is a special skeleton for every one of these polypes in addition to that for the whole body. There is a skeleton formed in the body of each of them, like a cup divided by a number of radiating partitions towards the outside; and that cup is formed of carbonate of lime, only not stained red, as in {{the case of}} the red coral. And all these cups are joined together into a common branch, the result of which is the formation of a beautiful coral tree. This is a great mass of madrepore, and in the living state every one of the ends of these branches was terminated by a beautiful little <b>polype,</b> like a sea anemone, and all the skeleton was covered by a soft body which united the polypes together. You must understand that all this skeleton has been formed in the interior of the body, to suit the branched body of the <b>polype</b> mass, and that it is as much its skeleton as our own bones are our skeleton. In this next coral the creature which has formed the skeleton has divided itself as it grew, and consequently has formed a great expansion; but scattered all over this surface there were <b>polype</b> bodies like those I previously described. Again, when this great cup was alive, the whole surface was covered with a beautiful body upon which were set innumerable small <b>polype</b> flowers, if we may so call them, often brilliantly coloured; and the whole cup was built up in the same fashion by the deposit of carbonate of lime in the interior of the combined <b>polype</b> body, formed by budding and by fission in the way I described. You will perceive that there is no necessary limit to this process. There is no reason why we should not have coral three or four times as big; and there are certain creatures of this kind that do fabricate very large masses, or half spheres several feet in diameter. Thus the activity of these animals in separating carbonate of lime from the sea and building it up into definite shapes is very considerable indeed.|$|E

The {{accurate}} {{investigation of}} the lowest forms of animal life, commenced by Leeuwenhoek and Swammerdam, and continued by the remarkable labours of Reaumur, Trembley, Bonnet, {{and a host of}} other observers, in the latter part of the seventeenth and the first half of the eighteenth centuries, drew the attention of biologists to the gradation in the complexity of organisation which is presented by living beings, and culminated in the doctrine of the [...] "échelle des êtres," [...] so powerfully and clearly stated by Bonnet; and, before him, adumbrated by Locke and by Leibnitz. In the then state of knowledge, it appeared that all the species of animals and plants could be arranged in one series; in such a manner that, by insensible gradations, the mineral passed into the plant, the plant into the <b>polype,</b> the <b>polype</b> into the worm, and so, through gradually higher forms of life, to man, at the summit of the animated world.|$|E

60|$|In {{the case}} of the red coral, the hard {{skeleton}} belongs to the interior of the stem and branches only; but in the commoner white corals, each <b>polype</b> has a complete skeleton of its own. These polypes are sometimes solitary, in which case the whole skeleton is represented by a single cup, with partitions radiating from its centre to its circumference. When the polypes formed by budding or division remain associated, the polypidom is sometimes made up of nothing but an aggregation of these cups, while at other times the cups are at once separated and held together, by an intermediate substance, which represents the branches of the red coral. The red coral <b>polype</b> again is a comparatively rare animal, inhabiting a limited area, the skeleton of which has but a very insignificant mass; while the white corals are very common, occur in almost all seas, and form skeletons which are sometimes extremely massive.|$|E
60|$|The {{simplest}} form of <b>polype</b> {{is that of}} a fleshy bag open at one end, surmounted by {{a circle}} of contractile threads or fingers called tentacles. The plate shows, on a very minute scale, at figs. 1, 3, and 6, several of these little polypiform bodies protruding from their cells. But the Hydra or Fresh-water <b>Polype</b> has no cell, and is quite unconnected with any root thread, or with other individuals of the same species. It is perfectly free, and so simple in its structure, that when the sac which forms its body is turned inside out it will continue to perform the functions of life as before. The greater part, however, of these Hydraform Polypes, although equally simple as individuals, are connected in a compound life by means of their variously formed POLYPIDOM, as the branched system of cells is termed. The Hydroid Zoophytes are represented in the first plate by the following examples.|$|E
60|$|With a {{very few}} exceptions, both the red and the white coral polypes are, in their adult state, firmly {{adherent}} to the sea-bottom; nor do their buds naturally become detached and locomotive. But, in addition to budding and division, these creatures possess the more ordinary methods of multiplication; and, at particular seasons, they give rise to numerous eggs of minute size. Within these eggs the young are formed, and they leave the egg in a condition which has no sort of resemblance to the perfect animal. It is, in fact, a minute oval body, many hundred times smaller than the full-grown creature, and it swims about with great activity by the help of multitudes of little hair-like filaments, called cilia, with which its body is covered. These cilia all lash the water in one direction, and so drive the little body along {{as if it were}} propelled by thousands of extremely minute paddles. After enjoying its freedom for a longer or shorter time, and being carried either by the force of its own cilia, or by currents which bear it along, the embryo coral settles down to the bottom, loses its cilia, and becomes fixed to the rock, gradually assuming the <b>polype</b> form and growing up to the size of its parent. As the infant polypes of the coral may retain this free and active condition for many hours, or even days, and as a tidal or other current in the sea may easily flow at the speed of two or even more miles in an hour, {{it is clear that the}} embryo must often be transported to very considerable distances from the parent. And it is easily understood how a single <b>polype,</b> which may give rise to hundreds, or perhaps thousands, of embryos, may, by this process of partly active and partly passive migration, cover an immense surface with its offspring. The masses of coral which may be formed by the assemblages of polypes which spring by budding, or by dividing, from a single <b>polype,</b> occasionally attain very considerable dimensions. Such skeletons are sometimes great plates, many feet long and several feet in thickness; or they may form huge half globes, like the brainstone corals, or may reach the magnitude of stout shrubs, or even small trees. There is reason to believe that such masses as these take a long time to form, and hence that the age a <b>polype</b> tree, or <b>polype</b> turf, may attain, may be considerable. But, sooner or later, the coral polypes, like all other things, die; the soft flesh decays, while the skeleton is left as a stony mass at the bottom of the sea, where it retains its integrity for a longer or a shorter time, according as its position affords it more or less protection from the wear and tear of the waves.|$|E
6000|$|And {{all this}} lapse of time has {{occurred}} within {{the most recent}} period {{of the history of}} the earth. The remains of reefs formed by coral <b>polypes</b> of different kinds from those which exist now, enter largely into the composition of the limestones of the Jurassic period; and still more widely different coral <b>polypes</b> have contributed their quota to the vast thickness of the carboniferous and Devonian strata.

"It {{is obvious}} that my {{hypothesis}} is apparently very similar to Darwin's, inasmuch as I also consider that {{the various forms of}} animals have proceeded directly from one another.

6000|$|And now arises {{a serious}} difficulty. If the coral <b>polypes</b> cannot live at a greater depth than 100 or 150 feet, {{how can they}} have built up {{the base of the}} reef-cone, which may be 2,000 feet, or more, {{below the surface of the}} sea? ...|$|R

60|$|That was {{the first}} point to make clear. The second point to deal with was--if the <b>polypes</b> cannot have built there while {{the level of the}} sea has {{remained}} stationary, then one of two things must have happened--either the sea has gone up, or the land has gone down.|$|R

6000|$|These {{creatures are}} very voracious, {{and not at}} all {{particular}} what they seize; and sometimes it may be that they lay hold of a shellfish which is far too big to be packed into that interior cavity, and, of course, in any ordinary animal a proceeding of this kind would give rise to a very severe fit of indigestion. But this {{is by no means the}} case in the sea anemone, because when digestive difficulties of this kind arise he gets out of them by splitting himself in two; and then each half builds itself up into a fresh creature, and you have two polypes where there was previously one, and the bone which stuck in the way lying between them! Not only can these creatures multiply in this fashion, but they can multiply by buds. A bud will grow out of the side of the body (I am not speaking of the common sea anemone, but of allied creatures) just like the bud of a plant, and that will fashion itself into a creature just like the parent. There are some of them in which these buds remain connected together, and you will soon see what would be the result of that. If I make a bud grow out here, and another on the opposite side, and each fashions itself into a new <b>polype,</b> the practical effect will be that before long you will see a single <b>polype</b> converted into a sort of tree or bush of polypes. And these will all remain associated together, like a kind of co-operative store, which is a thing I believe you understand very well here,--each mouth will help to feed the body and each part of the body help to support the multifarious mouths. I think that is as good an example of a zoological co-operative store as you can well have. Such are these wonderful creatures. But they are capable not only of multiplying in this way, but in other ways, by having a more ordinary and regular kind of offspring. Little eggs are hatched and the young are passed out by the way of the mouth, and they go swimming about as little oval bodies covered with a very curious kind of hairlike processes. Each of these processes is capable of striking water like an oar; and the consequence is that the young creature is propelled through the water. So that you have the young <b>polype</b> floating about in this fashion, covered by its 'vibratile cilia', as these long filaments, which are capable of vibration are termed. And thus, although the <b>polype</b> itself may be a fixed creature unable to move about, it is able to spread its offspring over great areas. For these creatures not only propel themselves, but while swimming about in the sea for many hours, or perhaps days, it will be obvious that they must be carried hither and thither by the currents of the sea, which not unfrequently move at the rate of one or two miles an hour. Thus, in the course of a few days, the offspring of this stationary creature may be carried to a very great distance from its parent; and having been so carried it loses these organs by which it is propelled, and settles down upon the bottom of the sea and grows up again into the form and condition of its parents. So that if you suppose a single <b>polype</b> of this kind settled upon the bottom of the sea, it may by these various methods--that is to say, by cutting itself in two, which we call [...] "fission," [...] or by budding; or by sending out these swimming embryos,--multiply itself to an enormous extent, and give rise to thousands, or millions, of progeny in a comparatively short time; and these thousands, or millions, of progeny may cover a very large surface of the sea bottom; in fact, you will readily perceive that, give them time, and there is no limit to the surface which they may cover.|$|E
6000|$|In {{favour of}} this hypothesis, Professor Kolliker adduces the {{well-known}} facts of Agamogenesis, or [...] "alternate generation"; the extreme dissimilarity {{of the males}} and females of many animals; and of the males, females, and neuters of those insects which live in colonies: and he defines its relations to the Darwinian theory as follows:--"It is obvious that my hypothesis is apparently very similar to Darwin's, inasmuch as I also consider that {{the various forms of}} animals have proceeded directly from one another. My hypothesis of the creation of organisms by heterogeneous generation, however, is distinguished very essentially from Darwin's by the entire absence of the principle of useful variations and their natural selection: and my fundamental conception is this, that a great plan of development lies at the foundation of the origin of the whole organic world, impelling the simpler forms to more and more complex developments.

6000|$|And now arises {{a serious}} difficulty. If the coral <b>polypes</b> cannot live at a greater depth {{than one hundred}} or {{one hundred and fifty}} feet, how can they have built up the base of the reef-cone, which may be two {{thousand}} feet, or more, {{below the surface of the}} sea? ...|$|R
6000|$|Now I think I {{have said}} sufficient--as much as I can without taking you into {{technical}} details, {{of the general}} nature of these creatures which form coral. The animals which form coral are scattered over the seas of all countries in the world. The red coral is comparatively limited, but the <b>polypes</b> which form the white coral are widely scattered. There are some of them which remain single, or which give rise to only small accumulations; and the skeletons of these, as they die, accumulate upon {{the bottom of the}} sea, but they do not come to much; they are washed about and do not adhere together, but become mixed up with the mud of the sea. But there are certain parts {{of the world in which}} the coral <b>polypes</b> which live and grow are of a kind which remain, adhere together, and form great masses. They differ from the ordinary <b>polypes</b> just in the same way as those plants which form a peat-bog or meadow-turf differ from ordinary plants. They have a habit of growing together in masses in the same place; they are what we call [...] "gregarious" [...] things; and the consequence of this is, that as they die and leave their skeletons, those skeletons form a considerable solid aggregation at the bottom of the sea, and other <b>polypes</b> perch upon them, and begin building upon them, and so by degrees a great mass is formed. And just as we know there are some ancient cities in which you have a British city, and over that the foundations of a Roman city; and over that a Saxon city, and over that again a modern city, so in these localities of which I am speaking, you have the accumulations of the foundations of the houses, if I may use the term, of nation after nation of these coral polypes; and these accumulations may cover a very considerable space, and may rise in the course of time from the bottom to the surface of the sea.|$|R
