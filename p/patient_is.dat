5|$|Once a <b>patient</b> <b>is</b> {{enrolled}} in hospice, the hospice becomes the insurance payor for that patient for any hospice-related illnesses. In other words, if a <b>patient</b> <b>is</b> on hospice for end-stage congestive heart failure, the hospice {{is responsible for}} all care related to the heart failure. However, if the patient were to see a podiatrist, this would be billed through their regular insurance.|$|E
5|$|Solar {{urticaria}} can {{be difficult}} to diagnose, but its presence can be confirmed by the process of phototesting. There are several forms of these tests including photopatch tests, phototests, photoprovocation tests, and laboratory tests. All of these are necessary to determine the exact infliction that the <b>patient</b> <b>is</b> suffering from. Photopatch tests are patch tests conducted when it is believed that a <b>patient</b> <b>is</b> experiencing certain symptoms due to an allergy that will only occur when in contact with sunlight. After the procedure, the <b>patient</b> <b>is</b> given a low dosage of UVA radiation.|$|E
5|$|When the {{announcer}} {{at the ball}} asks {{if there is a}} doctor in the house, Mac puts his hand up, to Caroline's embarrassment. Things get more embarrassing when Guy also volunteers, and asks why Caroline is sitting next to Mac when she is Guy's fiancée. A unconscious patient lies on an operating table. Guy touches her breasts, takes pictures of her naked body under the blanket, and kisses her. Caroline alleges that the <b>patient</b> <b>is</b> transgender, which repels Guy. Sue White then appears in a tutu, claiming that the <b>patient</b> <b>is</b> stalking Mac, and repeating the assertion that the <b>patient</b> <b>is</b> transgender.|$|E

5|$|After {{the car is}} {{disconnected}} {{from the rest of}} the train on a remote rail siding, Mulder questions the Red-Haired Man, who says that the <b>patient</b> <b>is</b> immune to biological warfare. Zama had tried to sneak the patient out of the country, but the government would rather see it destroyed than let their research fall into Japanese hands; the Red-Haired Man was sent to kill them both. Mulder, however, believes that the <b>patient</b> <b>is</b> an alien-human hybrid. With help from Scully, Mulder successfully unlocks the door of the railcar, but he is knocked unconscious by the Red-Haired Man. As the Red-Haired Man is about to leave, X appears and shoots him. Realizing that the bomb is about to explode and that there is not enough time to both save Mulder and secure the patient, X decides to save Mulder. X exits carrying the still unconscious Mulder shortly before the bomb explodes.|$|E
5|$|Doctors will {{sometimes}} prescribe immunosuppressive {{drugs such as}} prednisolone and ciclosporin if the <b>patient</b> <b>is</b> suffering from an intense form of solar urticaria. However, {{the side effects of}} these medicines can be severe which is why they are reserved for the most extreme of cases.|$|E
5|$|Social Worker: Every <b>patient</b> <b>is</b> {{assigned}} {{a social worker}} who visits {{at the time of}} admission to hospice. The social worker function can vary from providing superficial support to patients and families to intensive crisis-oriented counseling. Additionally, with a terminal illness often comes more complicated financial stressors; the social worker can be instrumental in connecting the patient and family with community resources including services such as Meals on Wheels. Lastly, if a <b>patient</b> <b>is</b> unable to be cared for at home, the social worker will work to find a safer place for the patient to receive hospice care.|$|E
30|$|In {{patients}} of the tubular group (15 males + 3 females), the total mortality <b>was</b> 4 <b>patients</b> and 14 patients experienced {{different degrees of}} improvement: 3 <b>patients</b> <b>were</b> conscious with no deficits and good recovery, 9 <b>patients</b> <b>were</b> conscious with mild disability, and 2 <b>patients</b> <b>were</b> conscious with severe disability. The final results in patients (11 males +[*] 7 females) managed by stereotactic resection and thrombolysis of the hematoma after the follow-up period were as follows: 5 patients died, 1 <b>patient</b> <b>was</b> conscious with severe disability, 10 <b>patients</b> <b>were</b> conscious with mild disability, and 2 <b>patients</b> <b>were</b> conscious with complete recovery.|$|R
30|$|During the 3 -year study period, 1787 <b>patients</b> <b>were</b> {{mechanically}} ventilated[*]>[*] 24  h (58.2 % of all admitted patients).

5|$|The {{diagnosis}} may be suspected on {{the basis}} of the history and examination. To confirm the diagnosis, as well as excluding alternative causes, several investigations are required; more investigations may be performed if the history is not typical or the <b>patient</b> <b>is</b> more likely to have an alternative problem: children, men, the elderly, or women who are not overweight.|$|E
5|$|The vast {{majority}} of tracheal intubations involve {{the use of a}} viewing instrument of one type or another. The modern conventional laryngoscope consists of a handle containing batteries that power a light and a set of interchangeable blades, which are either straight or curved. This device is designed to allow the laryngoscopist to directly view the larynx. Due to the widespread availability of such devices, the technique of blind intubation of the trachea is rarely practiced today, although it may still be useful in certain emergency situations, such as natural or man-made disasters. In the prehospital emergency setting, digital intubation may be necessitated if the <b>patient</b> <b>is</b> in a position that makes direct laryngoscopy impossible. For example, digital intubation may be used by a paramedic if the <b>patient</b> <b>is</b> entrapped in an inverted position in a vehicle after a motor vehicle collision with a prolonged extrication time.|$|E
5|$|Continuous Care is {{a service}} {{provided}} in the patient's home. It is for patients who are experiencing severe symptoms and need temporary extra support. Once a <b>patient</b> <b>is</b> on continuous care, the hospice provides services in the home a minimum of eight hours a day. Because the criteria for continuous care is similar to general inpatient care, and due to the challenges a hospice can face with staffing extended day care in the home, continuous care {{is intended to be}} used for short periods of time.|$|E
40|$|A {{retrospective}} analysis of medical records of 76 children of suspected foreign bodies (FB) in airway posted for rigid bronchoscopy under general anaesthesia <b>was</b> done. <b>Patients</b> <b>were</b> 9 months to 11 years old.

5|$|During {{the final}} stages, the <b>patient</b> <b>is</b> {{completely}} dependent upon caregivers. Language {{is reduced to}} simple phrases or even single words, eventually leading to complete loss of speech. Despite the loss of verbal language abilities, people can often understand and return emotional signals. Although aggressiveness can still be present, extreme apathy and exhaustion are much more common symptoms. People with Alzheimer's disease will ultimately {{not be able to}} perform even the simplest tasks independently; muscle mass and mobility deteriorates {{to the point where they}} are bedridden and unable to feed themselves. The cause of death is usually an external factor, such as infection of pressure ulcers or pneumonia, not the disease itself.|$|E
5|$|Generally, if the <b>patient</b> <b>is</b> {{treated and}} survives then a full {{recovery}} is expected. Patients who present early to medical facilities and have prompt medical treatment typically will have a favorable outcome. Alternatively, patients presenting late with {{signs and symptoms of}} coma, hyperkalemia, seizures, or severe acidosis have a poor prognosis. Patients who develop severe central nervous system manifestations or stroke who survive may have long term neurologic dysfunction; in some cases they may recover, although convalescence may be prolonged. The most significant long-term complication is related to the kidneys. Cases of permanent kidney damage, often requiring chronic dialysis or kidney transplantation, have been reported after severe poisoning.|$|E
5|$|If it is {{determined}} {{at the time}} of review that a patient's prognosis may be greater than six months, the <b>patient</b> <b>is</b> de-certified (discharged) from hospice. The hospice is required by law to give advance notification to the patient, and the patient can appeal the hospice's decision to Medicare. Usually the hospice plans these discharges weeks in advance to make the transition off hospice, which can be traumatic for patients who have been preparing to die, as smooth as possible. Should the patient's condition worsen once discharged from hospice they can be readmitted to hospice.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} qualify for hospice care, a patient must have {{certification}} from two physicians {{that he or she}} has less than six months to live if his or her disease runs its natural course; usually the patient's primary physician and the Hospice Medical Director will provide this certification. Patients can and do stay on hospice longer than six months, {{and as long as the}} hospice team continues to certify with supporting evidence that the <b>patient</b> <b>is</b> terminal, insurance companies will usually continue to pay for hospice care.|$|E
5|$|Integration {{failure is}} rare, {{particularly}} if a dentist's or oral surgeon's instructions are {{followed closely by}} the patient. Immediate loading implants may have {{a higher rate of}} failure, potentially due to being loaded immediately after trauma or extraction, but the difference with proper care and maintenance is well within statistical variance for this type of procedure. More often, osseointegration failure occurs when a <b>patient</b> <b>is</b> either too unhealthy to receive the implant or engages in behavior that contraindicates proper dental hygiene including smoking or drug use.|$|E

5|$|More global {{behavioural}} abnormalities may be noted, {{such as an}} increase in arousal and movement (described as psychomotor agitation or hyperactivity) which might reflect mania or delirium. An inability to sit still might represent akathisia, {{a side effect of}} antipsychotic medication. Similarly, a global decrease in arousal and movement (described as psychomotor retardation, akinesia or stupor) might indicate depression or a medical condition such as Parkinson's disease, dementia or delirium. The examiner would also comment on eye movements (repeatedly glancing to one side can suggest that the <b>patient</b> <b>is</b> experiencing hallucinations), and the quality of eye contact (which can provide clues to the patient's emotional state). Lack of eye contact may suggest depression or autism.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: This article {{describes}} the retrospective analysis of the patients who presented with a drug-related intoxication to the emergency department of the Erasmus Medical Centre in 2000. METHODS: Data were collected from the emergency department's electronic database and the medical charts of the patients. RESULTS: A total of 243 <b>patients</b> <b>were</b> seen with a drug-related intoxication caused by ingestion {{of one or more}} medical substances, drugs of abuse (DOA) or combinations with alcohol. Mono-intoxication occurred in 58 % of the patients, predominantly caused by DOA (56 patients), analgesics (17 patients) or benzodiazepines (14 patients). Benzodiazepines (55 patients), analgesics (42 patients), alcohol (42 patients), DOA (40 patients) and antidepressants (23 <b>patients)</b> <b>were</b> predominant in combined intoxications.
