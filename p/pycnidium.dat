5000|$|Diaporthe phaseolorum var. sojae (sexual) and Phomopsis sojae (asexual) overwinter as mycelia in {{infected}} {{seeds and}} plant debris. This {{serves as the}} primary inoculum. [...] In the spring, <b>pycnidium</b> are produced on plant debris and the petioles of abscise leaves. In the early summer perithecia develop on decaying stem tissue. The perithecium contain asci while the <b>pycnidium</b> releases conidia. Spores will germinate and penetrate through primarily immature or wounded tissue. Spores need at least 24 hours of free moisture to cause infection. The spores can then spread into mycelium and form perithecia and pycnidia.|$|E
50|$|Lichens {{reproduce}} {{by means}} of spores or vegetatively. This characteristic is also seen in free-living fungi and many other plants. There are three common spore-bearing structures found in lichens: the apothecium, the perithecium and the <b>pycnidium.</b> The apothecium is described as being either sessile or immersed. The thallus is known as sessile if it sits atop the surface of its growth medium. If the apothecium is level with or sits below the surface it is known as immersed. The second form of spore-bearing structure is a perithecium which refers to the complete immersion in the substratum of rock or bark. Finally, the <b>pycnidium,</b> commonly seen {{on the surface of}} foliose lichen and crustose lichen, are absent in fruticose lichens.|$|E
5000|$|The diverse conidia and conidiophores {{sometimes}} {{develop in}} asexual sporocarps with different characteristics (e.g. aecervulus, <b>pycnidium,</b> sporodochium). Some species of Ascomycetes form their structures within plant tissue, either as parasite or saprophytes. These fungi have evolved more complex asexual sporing structures, probably {{influenced by the}} cultural conditions of plant tissue as a substrate. These structures are called the sporodochium. This is a cushion of conidiophores created from a pseudoparenchymatous stroma in plant tissue. The <b>pycnidium</b> is a globose to flask-shaped parenchymatous structure, lined on its inner wall with conidiophores. The acervulus is a flat saucer shaped bed of conidiophores produced under a plant cuticle, which eventually erupt through the cuticle for dispersal.2) Budding: ...|$|E
50|$|A <b>pycnidium</b> (plural pycnidia) is an asexual fruiting body {{produced}} by mitosporic fungi {{in the form}} order Sphaeropsidales (Deuteromycota, Coelomycetes). It is often spherical or inversely pearshaped (obpyriform) and its internal cavity is lined with conidiophores. When ripe, an opening generally appears at the top, through which the pycnidiospores escape.|$|E
50|$|The {{three most}} common spore body types are raised discs called apothecia (singular: apothecium), bottle-like cups {{with a small}} hole at the top called perithecia (singular: perithecium), and pycnidia (singular: <b>pycnidium),</b> shaped like perithecia but without asci (an ascus is the {{structure}} that contains and releases the sexual spores in fungi of the Ascomycota).|$|E
5000|$|The disease cycle for Septoria {{cannabis}} {{is identical}} to that of Septoria tritici [...] or Septoria of tomato except {{for the production of}} a perithecium instead of a pseudothecium. Being that it is a polycyclic disease, it can asexually produce conidia in a <b>pycnidium</b> which continually inoculates new hosts throughout the growing season, as well as sexually produce ascospores in a perithecium which acts as an overwintering structure. The disease survives on plant debris from the previous growing season as ascospores in a perithecium, as well as mycelium on the epidermal tissue layers of leaves. The thick cell wall of the ascospores provides protection and allows for the disease to remain in the infected growing area until favorable conditions return. When the conditions are favorable (summer-fall) the spores are released and carried by wind or raindrops to a nearby host. Once infected the disease quickly spreads via the production of conidia in the secondary cycle which is accompanied by the sexual production of ascospores. <b>Pycnidium</b> are formed on the leaf lesions.|$|E
50|$|The leaf is {{the first}} thing {{infected}} by the windborne spores, often it is the youngest shoots, it is nearly always those on the lowest branches. It attacks from the bottom up of a poplar tree, because the main source of the infection (the dead leaves) are lying on the ground. The higher branch shoots have a longer window of resistance simply because they are so far away from the disease. The leaves begin to develop <b>Pycnidium</b> which are the fruiting bodies that spread the disease to other hosts. The infection begins to spread up the host to the top branches, creating leaf spots and cankers where ever it can. After the disease has used all the resources of the leaves, they have become black and shriveled. The leaves fall like normal in the fall, and overwinter on dead leaves on the ground. In the spring the wind picks up the <b>Pycnidium</b> S. musiva spores and it carries them to find a new host to start the infection all over again. It is worth noting that the cankers can spread the disease if they happen to break, they will release spores of their own, however, this is not the main source of infection as S. musiva cankers can live in the branch of the tree far longer than the S. musiva on leaves.|$|E
50|$|Niebla flagelliforma {{is easily}} {{recognized}} by a thallus—up to 6 cm high and 3 cm across—divided from a holdfast into narrow erect branches that terminate—after branching {{one or more}} times—in flagelliform branchlets. The cortex of the thallus, which covers a partially hollow medulla, has conspicuous and closely reticulate ridges, often cracking along the transverse ridges, and becomes thinner towards apex, 75-25 µm thick. This thinning of the cortex {{and the development of}} a subfistulose medulla probably relates to the coiling of the branches. Black dot-like pycnidia are abundant on the flagelliform branchlets, each <b>pycnidium</b> is surrounded by a cortical margin similar to the thalline margin of an apothecium. The key lichen substance is divaricatic acid (with triterpenes and usnic acid).|$|E
50|$|Due to commonalities in {{symptoms}} of P. juniperova and related Phomopsis blights, diagnosis {{can often be}} difficult. Although the observation of symptoms {{is the first step}} in identification of this pathogen, the presence of both alpha and beta spores in the <b>pycnidium</b> must be verified in order to confirm the existence of P. juniperova. Alpha spores are spherical spores active in host infection while beta spores, are long, narrow, stylospores, which do not play a part in disease contagion. Beta spores are rarely found in the wild, but proliferate when P. juniperova is grown on cultures of potato dextrose agar.If the resources for this method of diagnosis are not available, contact a local extension office to be directed to an expert in plant pathogens or a laboratory that can assist with the process.|$|E

The lesions caused by P. capsici often occurred together and resembled slightly those incited by C. coccodes. Phomopsis lesions could be differentiated {{on the basis of}} pliable leathery condition of the affected tissue and of <b>pycnidium</b> presence while C. coccodes produced lesions with regular round shape and abundant acervuli, setae and microsclerotia in colonized fruit tissue. On some fruits P. capsici caused single infection but mixed infections of Phomopsis and Colletotrichum were observed, as well, C. coccodes is a soil-borne pathogen that produces long-lasting structures (microsclerotia) in the plant debris. The development of this pathogen on pepper might contribute to the building up of inoculum in the soil which could serve as reservoir for other Solanaceae. To our knowledge, this is the first report of P. capsici and C. coccodes on pepper in Macedonia...|$|E
40|$|Cultural layers {{from early}} medieval strongholds in Pszczew and Santok have been {{examined}} {{for the presence of}} pollen grains and spores as well as residues of fungi. The presence of the following remains has been recorded: fossil hyphopodia of Gaeumannomyces, teliospores of Puccinia, spores of Bipolaris, Thecaphora and Tilletia, teliospores of the genus Urocystis, Ustilago and Uromyces, ascocarps (perithecium) of the Ascomycota or the <b>pycnidium</b> of Sphaeropsidales. A greater diversity and abundance of fungi spores sensu lato was recorded in Santok, as compared to Pszczew. Both early medieval sites recorded a significant proportion of cereal pollen, including Secale cereale. It remains an undisputed fact that the grains and other plants collected in both strongholds were strongly infected with fungi. The analysis of the cultural layers for the presence of fungi remains provides significant data on the presence of certain species of plants and their growth conditions in natural environments and in agriculture...|$|E
40|$|Lichenization {{is assumed}} to be a very ancient mode of fungal nutrition, but fossil records are rare. Here we {{describe}} two fragments of exceptionally preserved, probably charred, lichen thalli with internal stratification. Cyanolichenomycites devonicus has a cyanobacterial and Chlorolichenomycites salopensis a unicellular, presumably green algal photobiont. Fruiting bodies are missing. Cyanolichenomycites devonicus forms asexual spores in a <b>pycnidium.</b> All specimens were examined with scanning electron microscopy techniques. The fossils were extracted by maceration. Extant lichens and free-living cyanobacteria were either experimentally charcoalified for comparison or conventionally prepared. Based on their septate hyphal structure, both specimens are tentatively interpreted as representatives of the Pezizomycotina (Ascomycota). Their presence in 415 million yr (Myr) old rocks from the Welsh Borderland predates existing Late Cretaceous records of pycnidial conidiomata by some 325 Myr and Triassic records of lichens with broadly similar organization by some 195 Myr. These fossils represent the oldest known record of lichens with symbionts and anatomy as typically found in morphologically advanced taxa today. The latter does not apply to Winfrenatia reticulata, the enigmatic crustose lichen fossil from the Lower Devonian, nor to presumed lichen-like organisms such as the Cambrian Farghera robusta or to the Lower Devonian Spongiophyton minutissimum...|$|E
40|$|Phomopsis vaccinii cause {{a serious}} disease of blueberry, {{cranberry}} and other Vaccinium crops in the North America and Europe as well. Over 1000 species names are described by Phomopsis spp., but their biology and life style are mostly unknown. Identification of P. vaccinii by methods of classical phytopathology {{is difficult and}} complicate, because many species are morphologically similar to P. vaccinii, and P. vaccinii itself has diverse patterns of colony morphology. For this investigation P. vaccinii isolates were obtained from five cranberry plantations in different locations of Latvia (Babite, Alsunga, Rucava, Ape and Pargauja municipality) from berries affected by viscid rot at harvest and storage in 2010. Altogether 44 P. vaccinii isolates were cultivated on potato dextrose agar for description of colony morphology. In order to find some relationships between samples, the isolates were arranged in different groups {{on the basis of}} mycelium color and structure (zoning), reverse pigmentation, <b>pycnidium</b> formation time, size, location, number and size of conidia. During this study the colonies of P. vaccinii from cranberry in Latvia showed different morphological features in culture and no relationships between growing regions and groups of isolates were found.

40|$|A {{survey of}} leaf spot disease on durian caused by Phomopsis durionis was {{conducted}} in durian growing areas in eastern Thailand, Chanthaburi and Trat provinces. It was found that lesions with yellow halos on both mature and young leaves are variable in sizes (1 – 10 mm in diameter). In this study, nine morphologically distinct isolates of Phomopsis were obtained from durian leaf spots. Some of them produced small number of pycnidia on potato dextrose agar after incubation for 30 days. Artificial inoculation on wounded leaves of durian seedlings, resulted {{in the production of}} browning areas with yellow halos and <b>pycnidium</b> formation at 13 days and 20 days after inoculation, respectively. Furthermore, red-brown spots with yellow halos on leaf tissues were observed at 32 days after inoculation. High density of Phomopsis was observed in durian symptomless leaves and flowers indicated the latent infection of the pathogen in the fields. Interestingly, crude extract of durian leaf with preformed substances demonstrated inhibition of spore germination and germ tube growth of the pathogen, Phomopsis sp., on water agar. In addition, bioassay on TLC plate displayed inhibition zone of growth of the fungus, Cladosporium oxysporum at retention factor (Rf) of 0. 29 – 0. 88. This indicates that preformed substances in leaf tissues might act as compounds affecting latent period of pathogen...|$|E
40|$|Zymoseptoria tritici ascospores and pycnidiospores are {{considered}} the main forms of primary and secondary inoculum, respectively, in septoria tritici blotch epidemics. The pathogenicity of {{the two types of}} spores of the same genotypic origin were compared through a two-stage inoculation procedure in controlled conditions. Adult wheat leaves were inoculated with ascospores collected from field sources, yielding 119 lesions; pycnidiospores collected from 12 lesions resulting from these ascospore infections were then used for inoculation. Lesion development was assessed for 5 weeks; latent period, lesion size, and <b>pycnidium</b> density were estimated for different isolates. The latent period was calculated as the maximum likely time elapsed between inoculation and either the appearance {{of the majority of the}} sporulating lesions (leaf scale) or the appearance of the first pycnidia (lesion scale). The latent period was significantly longer (c. 60 degree-days, i. e. 3 - 4 days) after infection with ascospores than with pycnidiospores. No difference was established for lesion size and density of pycnidia. A comparison with other ascomycete fungi suggested that the difference in latent period might be related to the volume of spores and their ability to cause infection. Fungal growth before the appearance of lesions may be slower after inoculation with an ascospore than with a pycnidiospore. The mean latent period during the very beginning of epidemics, when first lesions are mainly caused by ascospores, may be longer than during spring, when secondary infections are caused by pycnidiospores. Disease models would be improved if these differences were considered...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} a novel method of fungal slide preparation named "agar block smear preparation. " A total of 510 agar block smears of 25 fungal strains obtained from culture collections, 90 QC fungal strains, and 82 clinical fungal strains from our clinical microbiology laboratory, {{which included a}} total of 137 species of yeasts, molds, and thermal dimorphic fungi, were prepared and examined. In contrast to adhesive tape preparation, agar block smears preserved the native fungal structures, such as intact conidiophores of Aspergillus species and arrangements of conidia in Scopulariopsis brevicaulis. Furthermore, agar block smears allowed examination of fungal structures embedded in the agar, such as the ascomata with ascomal hairs in Chaetomium funicola; <b>pycnidium</b> of Phoma glomerata; the intercalary ovoidal chlamydospores arranged in chains of Fusarium dimerum; and the lateral, spherical chlamydospores arranged in pairs of Fusarium solani. After 1 year of storage, morphological integrity {{was found to have}} been maintained in 459 (90 %) of the 510 agar block smears. After 3 years of storage, morphological integrity was found to have been maintained in 72 (71 %) of the 102 smears prepared in 2006. Agar block smear preparation preserves the native fungal structures and allows long-term storage and examination of fungal structures embedded in the agar, hence overcoming the major drawbacks of adhesive tape preparation. The major roles of agar block smear should be diagnosis for difficult cases, accurate identification of fungal species for clinical management of patients and epidemiological studies, and long-term storage for transportation of slides and education purposes.

40|$|The {{work began}} with an {{endeavour}} to find a technique for inoculating the host plants of the Uredineae with single sporidia of their specific rust, with precision and certainty. This has been achieved, and single sporidia have been isolated {{by means of the}} microdissection apparatus of Dr. Chambers. The most favourable conditions for sporidial infection were then determined, and cultures kept under controlled conditions. The rust used was Puccinia malvacearum, chosen because its teleutospores germinate immediately they are ripe so that a constant supply is available over a long period. This facilitated preliminary experimentation. Results show that this fungus is homothallic: a single sporidium being sufficient to cause infection, and the production of teleutospores. This was to be expected since there is no <b>pycnidium</b> or aecidium in the life cycle. The method of Inoculation has universal application for the rusts and it is hoped to demonstrate this at once in a long cycled form. Reviewing the literature on Puccinia malvacearum several problems in the life-cycle were found to be as yet unsolved. A study of the complete life history by means of examination of infections of known age, made under controlled conditions, has helped to elucidate these points. Infected plants in the field have also been under observation day by day throughout the winter, {{to solve the problem of}} hibernation. The results from these experiments show that there is a retardation in the cycle consequent on the less frequent occurrence of suitable conditions for germination and infection, but new infections do occur whenever these favourable conditions prevail. <p...|$|E
40|$|Sooty molds (Capnodiaceae) are saprotrophs on the {{surfaces}} of leaves, and they take their nutrients from honeydew exuded by sap-sucking insects. We describe and illustrate the sooty mold Fumiglobus pieridicola sp. nov., which, {{to the dismay of}} gardeners, forms a thick black mycelial coating on the leaves and twigs of ornamental Japanese andromeda (Pieris japonica) in western North America. As a mitosporic species with a <b>pycnidium</b> that lacks an elongated neck and has at most a rudimentary stalk, the species belongs in the genus Fumiglobus. Although locally common, we found no specimens identified under Fumiglobus or its synonyms in regional herbaria and no record of any similar fungus in host indices. Our species differs from others in Fumiglobus in having smaller pycnidia and conidia and in having intercalary as well as apical pycnidia. We determined partial 18 S and 28 S ribosomal gene sequences for F. pieridicola, the first for any Fumiglobus species. Sequence analysis provides strong bootstrap support for including Fumiglobus within Capnodiaceae. We also determined 18 S and 28 S sequences for the type species of the mitosporic genus Conidiocarpus, also in Capnodiaceae. We confirm that Conidiocarpus is the anamorph of Phragmocapnias. Following the rules of nomenclatural priority, we propose the new combinations Conidiocarpus asiaticus, Conidiocarpus betle, Conidiocarpus callitris, Conidiocarpus fuliginodes, Conidiocarpus heliconiae, Conidiocarpus imperspicuus and Conidiocarpus siamensis.

40|$|Infection {{of wheat}} by Septoria tritici was studied in a {{compatible}} (cultivar `Sevin'-isolate IPO 323) and an incompatible (cultivar `Stakado'-isolate IPO 323) interaction. A second incompatible interaction (cultivar `Flame'-isolate IPO 323) was {{included as a}} control {{of the most important}} observations made for Stakado. Quantitative studies of the initial stages of infection confirmed that penetration occurs through stomata. However, direct penetration attempts were also observed, indicated by papilla-formation. Pre-penetration growth and penetration frequency was not different between the interactions. Hyphal growth in Stakado was inhibited after penetration and no pycnidia formed whereas in Sevin, hyphal growth progressed and pycnidia formed 15 days after inoculation. Significantly higher amounts of H(2) O(2) accumulated in Stakado than in Sevin until 11 days after inoculation. Timing and localization of H(2) O(2) in Stakado correlated with arrest of pathogen growth, thus indicating a role for this molecule in resistance. H(2) O(2) accumulation is known to arrest biotrophic pathogens and therefore also likely the hemibiotrophic pathogen S. tritici. More H(2) O(2) accumulated in Sevin than Stakado 13 and 15 days after inoculation, coinciding with <b>pycnidium</b> formation and host cell collapse. This late accumulation in the compatible interaction is thought to be a stress-related response. After inoculation with S. tritici, total peroxidase activity and gene transcript of an apoplastic peroxidase increased in Stakado. The peroxidase activity pattern and transcript accumulation profile suggest a role for peroxidase in resistance, probably in cell wall cross-linking. Accumulation patterns of the gene transcript of a catalase and the total catalase enzyme activity suggest roles for catalase synthesis and inactivation in regulating H(2) O(2) accumulation.

The ability of one isolate to cause disease on M. sativa (alfalfa), Cicer arietinum (chickpea), Pisum sativum (pea), Lens culinaris (lentil) and Phaseolus vulgaris (common bean) was also tested. The pathogen caused dark lesions that enlarged and coalesced causing yellowing and premature abscission of leaves, resulting in decreased shoot fresh weight in barrel medic plants. All P. medicaginis isolates infected barrel medic roots causing collar rot, brown root discoloration, yellowing of cotyledons and reduced shoot and root development. The pathogen colonized the cortex and the stele {{of plants and}} produced fertile pycnidia on infected roots. Symptoms on leaves allowed for greater discrimination in aggressiveness among isolates in comparison to symptoms on roots. No correlations were observed between the parameters measured on leaves and roots suggesting organ specialization in this pathogen. Phoma medicaginis infected leaves of alfalfa, pea, common bean and chickpea causing necrosis and tissue yellowing at 15 d post inoculation (dpi). <b>Pycnidium</b> production was observed on dead and dying foliar tissues of alfalfa, pea and common bean, but not on chickpea.

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of marine fungi on phanerogamic plant remains in Australia has, {{up to the}} present, been unrecorded {{with the exception of}} the report by Johnson and McNeil (1941) of the {{occurrence of}} an unidentified Ascomycete in hardwood in the port of Sydney. Three species are recorded by Cribb and Herbert (1954) as parasitic on marine algae in Tasmania, but no marine species have hitherto been recorded from Queensland. The authors have collected a number of fungi from both living algae and phanerogamic remains in the littoral region in Queensland and this paper is the first of a planned series dealing with fungi from the marine environment in this area. In general, the perithecia or pycnidia of difierent species are not intermingled but this is by no means always the case, at least with respect to those occurring on phanerogamic substrata. This, together with the paucity of fruiting bodies in some cases, and the fact that it is frequently impossible to identify a specimen with any certainty before the perithecium or <b>pycnidium</b> has been crushed and the spores examined, sometimes leads to difficulties in the designation of the type specimen of a new species. Descriptions and figures have therefore been made from specimens mounted in lactophenol-cotton blue and these have then been remounted in glycerine-phloxine according to the double cc:verglass method of Diehl (1929). The pieces of substratum from which the fruiting bodies were obtained have been retained, but, except in the case of species on algae or where the fruiting bodies may be prominent and unmistakable, it is the specimens on slides Which will be regarded as the respective types.

40|$|The {{present study}} and {{a survey of}} literature- showed that of the various spore types {{associated}} with species of Phyllachora, scolecospores typical of the form genus Leptostromella were most common. Examination has shown that certain spore types claimed as imperfect states of Phyllachora species are actually spores of hyperparasites. Evidence that the scolecospores belong to the Phyllachora species {{with which they are}} associated has been gathered. Studies on the development of P. parilis showed that the scolecospores associated with the perithecia of this species were genetically related to it. Attempts to germinate the scolecospores associated with three species of Phyllachora were unsuccessful. Similarly, when scolecospores were used as inoculum, test plants did not become infected. When ascosporic inoculum were used, however, infection occurred. Only one type of mycelium was found in each infection court, and pycnidia and perithecia developed from this in close association. Consequently, although the scolecosporous pycnidia developed prior to the perithecia, both types of fructification occurred in individual Phyllachora colonies. Within each mature colony the tissues of the pycnidia, perithecia, and clypeus became fused and were indistinguishable from one another. The development of the <b>pycnidium</b> and scolecospores is described, and it is shown that a different species of Leptostromella is associated with each different Phyllachora species. The Leptostromella species can be distinguished especially by the morphology of their sporophores. When it was shown that the morphology of the Leptostromella associated with each Phyllachora species was distinctive and constant, it was possible to assess the frequency and distribution of these associations. With some species of Phyllachora the association occurred in all specimens, while in others it was not as frequent. Always, however, the distribution of the association was as widespread as the species of Phyllachora concerned. It was noted that hyperparasites were able to parasitize the Leptostromella states as readily as the ascal states of various species of Phyllachora. The function of the scolecospores is not known, but it is suggested that they may be spermatia...|$|E
40|$|Stagonospora nodorum is {{the causal}} agent of Stagonospora nodorum blotch (SNB) of wheat. This fungus has cost the Australian grains {{industry}} upwards of 100 million dollars (AUD) p. a. in recent growing seasons, {{making it one}} of the most agriculturally damaging pathogens in Australia. Disease severity is governed by the polycyclic lifecycle of S. nodorum, requiring a succession of spore inoculum arising from the asexual fruiting body of the fungus, known as the <b>pycnidium.</b> The resultant fungal density will determine the level of damage and ultimately influence the grain yield of the plant. G-protein signalling through the heterotrimeric G-protein is a biochemical mechanism used by S. nodorum in the host-pathogen interaction and has been linked to important biological processes including asexual sporulation. In this work, the unique phenotypes of three mutant strains of S. nodorum; each lacking either the Gα (Gna 1), Gβ (Gba 1), or Gγ (GgaA) subunit of the heterotrimeric G-protein were explored, and the biochemistry underpinning the phenotypes assessed by metabolomics. The mutant strain S. nodorum ggaA was created by homologous recombination of the GgaA gene for comparison with the previously created gna 1 and gba 1 strains. All strains possessed developmental defects and reduced pathogenicity on the wheat plant. Growth assays uncovered differences in carbon source utilisation between the strains. Asexual sporulation was monitored by light microscopy; with the differentiation of mutant mycelia into pycnidia found to occur only after a comparatively longer culture time than in wild type, and at a reduced temperature. Until this time, asexual sporulation is completely abolished in the mutant strains. The matured pycnidia also possessed an irregular morphology. These results identified an association of all three G-protein subunits in asexual sporulation in S. nodorum. Metabolites were isolated from S. nodorum mycelia for gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC-MS) analysis. An assessment of existing metabolomic methods identified some key steps in the sample preparation employed prior to injection into the GC-MS. Quenching the fungal metabolism upon harvesting, drying the fungal mycelia prior to metabolite extraction and isolation, and lyophilisation of the fungal metabolites in preparation for chemical derivatisation; each improved the metabolite recovery and overall reliability of the metabolomic analyses. These methods were applied to the metabolomic characterisations that followed. Metabolite extracts from the in vitro cultured fungal strains were analysed using a single-quadrupole GC-MS and the recorded analytes cross-refereces to purchased metabolite standards for identification. Changes in the accumulation of various carbohydrates were apparent in the mutant metabolomes. Of those, the altered abundances of the metabolites glucose and trehalose are believed to in part explain or be consequential to the sporulation phenomena of these strains. Metabolomic analysis of the mutant strains in differentiating from a non-sporulating to a sporulating phenotype revealed the specific association of a number of metabolites with each of the two phenotypic classifications. Many of which have been targeted for identification in future studies. Among those identified was again trehalose, providing further evidence for it having a role in the asexual sporulation of this fungus. These results have demonstrated the requirement for Gna 1, Gba 1 and GgaA in regulating developmental processes and the pathogenesis of S. nodorum, and added significantly to the biochemical dissection of asexual sporulation in this fungus...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MScAgric (Plant Pathology)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2010. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: A {{survey was}} {{undertaken}} on apple and pear {{trees in the}} Western Cape Province to determine the aetiology of trunk diseases with reference to trunk diseases occurring on grapevine. Grapevine trunk diseases cause the gradual decline and dieback of vines resulting in a decrease in the vine’s capability to carry and ripen fruit. In recent years, viticulture has been expanding into several of the well established pome fruit growing areas. The presence of trunk pathogens in pome fruit orchards may affect the health of the pome fruit trees as well as cause a threat to young vineyards planted in close proximity to these potential sources of viable inoculum. Several genera containing species known to be involved in trunk disease on pome fruit and grapevine were found, including Diplodia, Neofusicoccum, Eutypa, Phaeoacremonium and Phomopsis. Diplodia seriata and D. pyricolum, were isolated along with N. australe and N. vitifusiforme. Four Phaeoacremonium species, P. aleophilum, P. iranianum, P. mortoniae and P. viticola, two Phomopsis species linked to clades identified in former studies as Phomopsis sp. 1 and Phomopsis sp. 7, and Eutypa lata were found. In addition, Paraconiothyrium brasiliense and Pa. variabile, and an unidentified Pyrenochaetalike species were found. Of these the Phaeoacremonium species have not been found on pear wood and it is a first report of P. aleophilum occurring on apple. This is also a first report of the Phomopsis species and Eutypa lata found occurring on pome trees in South Africa Two new coelomycetous fungi were also found including a Diplodia species, Diplodia pyricolum sp. nov., and a new genus, Pyrenochaetoides gen. nov. with the type species, Pyrenochaetoides mali sp. nov., were described from necrotic pear and apple wood. The combined ITS and EF 1 -α phylogeny supported the new Diplodia species, which is closely related to D. mutila and D. africana. The new species is characterised by conidia that become pigmented and 1 -septate within the <b>pycnidium,</b> and that are intermediate in size between the latter two Diplodia species. Phylogenetic inference of the SSU of the unknown coelomycete provided bootstrap support (100 %) for a monophyletic clade unrelated to known genera, and basal to Phoma and its relatives. Morphologically the new genus is characterised by pycnidial with elongated necks that lack setae, cylindrical conidiophores that are seldomly branched at the base, and Phoma-like conidia. The phylogenetic results combined with its dissimilarity from genera allied to Phoma, lead to the conclusion that this species represents a new genus. A pathogenicity trial was undertaken to examine the role of these species on apple, pear and grapevine shoots. N. australe caused the longest lesions on grapevine shoots, while Pyrenochaetoides mali, Pa. variabile, D. seriata and P. mortoniae caused lesions that were significantly longer than the control inoculations. On pears, D. pyricolum and N. australe caused the longest lesions, followed by D. seriata and E. lata. On apples, the longest lesions were caused by N. australe and P. iranianum. D. seriata, D. pyricolum, E. lata, N. vitifusiforme, Pa. brasiliense, P. aleophilum and P. mortoniae also caused lesions on apple that were significantly longer than the control. The study demonstrated that close cultivation of grapevine to apple and pear orchards may have inherent risks in terms of the free availability of viable inoculum of trunk disease pathogens.

Les souches de S. nodorum sont donc des populations faites d’éléments aux pouvoirs pathogènes différents. Le noyau et le cytoplasme de l’hôte exercent sur ces populations des pressions de sélection permettant aux éléments les mieux adaptés à l’hôte de passage d’être sélectionnés. Suivant le niveau des perturbations qu’ils provoquent sur les blés sensibles, on peut classer les cytoplasmes dans l’ordre suivant: Triticum timopheevi > Secale cereale > T aesfivum. Sur le plan de la dynamique de l’épidémie, ces perturbations peuvent se traduire par une moindre compétitivité des souches. La réponse de lignées de blé à haut niveau de résistance générale ne semble pas perturbée. Toutefois, le gain d’agressivité qui s’exprime sur l’hôte de passage, dès le premier passage, tend à s’amenuiser au fur et à mesure des passages successifs. The parasite {{can adjust}} its pathogenicity {{by means of}} two mechanisms: one is {{at the level of}} ascospores differenciation, the other is the result of heterogenicity among the spores resulting from vegetative multiplication of the fungus. These two mechanisms participate in the initiation and spreading of epidemics. This study will deal with the second mechanism. The following material was used: 1) host range (Table I) : two wheat cultivars, two series of triticales and one rye cultivar; and 2) fungal isolates : isolate 6 (wheat adapted), isolate 42 (triticale adapted), monopycnidiospore cultures derived from 6 and 42 and subcultures derived from a single spore, isolate collected in Lyon’s area-strain "Lyon" (Rhône-Poulenc), isolates collected in Israel: strains IS 1 and. IS 2 - The following measurements were made: 1) thousand-grain-weight (PMG) or reduction of thousand-grain-weight (RPMG), 2) rate of spread of foliar necrosis (Pmax) 3) rate of spread of epidemics. The selection pressure by host-plants was obtained with 1 - 4 passages through the host, using inoculation of detached seedling leaves. The parasite was re-isolated from pycnidia and inoculated on ears. Significant differences in aggressiveness, as expressed by thousand-grain-weight, were observed between pycnidia cultures isolated from the same strain (Table II), between monopycnidiospore cultures derived from a same <b>pycnidium</b> (Tables III, IV) or between 2 generation monopycnidiospore subcultures (Table V). Similar observations were made with tests on Triticale "Clercal" (Table VI). The difference between the dynamics of strains 6 and 42 was revealed by two tests: Fig. 1. : on two wheat lines, the one susceptible, the other with a high partial resistance level; and Fig. 2. : on two susceptible wheat cultivars, according to the number of dissemination and contamination periods. Variability of aggressiveness of pathogen strains towards their own hosts, was also expressed by thousand-grainweight in response to selection pressure by several alien hosts (Table Vlla). The range of isolates is not the same after host passaging (Table Vllb). The particular effect of genotype and cytoplasm was illustrated with series of triticale: one isoplasmic with various genomes, the other isogenic and alloplasmic (Table VIII, Fig. 3). The effect of number of passages (1 - 4) of strain 6 through an alloplasmic list of three Triticale, observed either on two susceptible wheat cultivars (Fig. 3) or on passaging host (Fig. 4), showed that the increase in pathogenicity occurred from the first passage onwards. Concerning the partial resistance we observed that the passage of strain 6 through the Triticale "Clercal" reduced the incubation time (LPI) and increased the rate of spread of foliar necrosis (Pmax). These parasite variations led to an increased pathogenicity on susceptible varieties, but the behaviour of lines {{with a high level of}} general resistance remained constant (Table IX) ...|$|E
