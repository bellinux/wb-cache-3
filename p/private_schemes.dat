60|$|This {{has been}} the history of many railroads since in Ohio, and if we could {{read between the lines}} that now cobweb the map of the state, we should come to know many tales of broken {{fortunes}} and of broken hopes. The railroads are no different in this from other business enterprises, but they are different from the canals. These, as we have seen, were the work of the state for the advantage of the whole people, while the railroads were from the beginning <b>private</b> <b>schemes</b> for making money. Each kind of highway came in its time, and each in its way served the purpose of Ohio. At the time the companies began to build their railroads, the state system of canals was in its highest usefulness, and {{it is no wonder that}} the people should have regarded the railroads as fanciful schemes. No one could then have dreamed how rapidly they would increase and multiply, and that in less than fifty years they should so far surpass the canals in service to the public that some of these would be abandoned by the state, and become grass-grown ditches hardly distinguishable in their look of ancient ruin from the works of the Mound Builders. At the most there were once nine hundred miles of canals in Ohio, and now there are twelve or fourteen thousand miles of railroads. Yet the canals were a greater achievement for Ohio in 1837 than the railroads are in 1897.|$|E

Bacon, living laborious days, plunged into the debate in the Commons on Supply and fell into Elizabeth's disgrace, and vainly competed with Coke for the Attorney-Generalship, and went on to write a pamphlet on the conspiracy of Lopez, and to try to gain the office of Solicitor-General, to manage Essex's affairs, to plead at the Bar, to do Crown work as a lawyer, to urge his suit for the Solicitorship; to trifle with the composition of [...] "Formularies and Elegancies" [...] (January 1595), to write his Essays, to try for the Mastership of the Rolls, to struggle with the affairs of the doomed Essex (1600-1), while always [...] "labouring in secret" [...] at that vast aim of the reorganisation of natural science, which ever preoccupied him, he says, and distracted his attention from his practice and from affairs of State. {281a} Of these State affairs the projected Union with Scotland was the most onerous.

To this burden of Atlas the Baconians add the vamping-up of old plays for Shakespeare's company, and the inditing of new plays, poems, and the Sonnets.

Descriptive and econometric analyses were {{used to analyze the}} sample data. Our results indicated that though more purchased inputs are allocated in government <b>scheme,</b> the <b>private</b> <b>scheme</b> was more efficient in terms of resource use. Average net farm incomes per hectare were N 373, 040, N 427, 070 and N 285, 975 for pepper, tomato and onion enterprises respectively under the <b>private</b> irrigation <b>schemes.</b> They were N 210, 045, N 325, 891 and N 244, 748 for pepper, tomato and onion enterprises respectively in the government irrigation schemes. Similarly, average returns on naira investment were higher under the <b>private</b> irrigation <b>scheme.</b> They were 2. 0, 2. 3 and 1. 7 for pepper, tomato and onion enterprises respectively under the <b>private</b> irrigation <b>schemes</b> and 1. 2, 2. 3 and 2. 0 for pepper, tomato and onion enterprises respectively in the government irrigation schemes. To correct the general inefficiency in the use of resources, farmers should be trained on appropriate resource allocation techniques that would guarantee optimal performances of irrigation schemes. It is suggested that irrigation policy efforts should focus on encouraging private as opposed to government irrigation scheme if the country is to be self sufficient in terms of food and vegetable production.

The impact of financial literacy on retirement planning is a well-established issue in the existing empirical literature; our main contribution is proving that financial knowledge not only impacts retirement planning, but also the decisions of entering a <b>private</b> pension <b>scheme</b> (or devoting the severance pay to a <b>private</b> pension <b>scheme).</b> Adding the consideration of trust poses serious econometric concerns, since both financial literacy and trust in financial institutions are likely to be endogenous and the presence of two endogenous regressors renders the identification of causality very difficult. Our solution is to keep only financial literacy as endogenous and include in our models an exogenous regional indicator of social capital (similar to the one adopted by Guiso et al., 2004), as a proxy for the level of trust between the counterparts of a financial contract in each geographical area. Our main findings show that trust has a positive influence on both the decisions to enter a <b>private</b> pension <b>scheme</b> or to devote the severance pay to a <b>private</b> pension <b>scheme...</b>|$|R

50|$|Nearly one {{in three}} {{patients}} receiving NHS hospital treatment is privately insured and could have the cost paid for by their insurer. Some <b>private</b> <b>schemes</b> provide cash payments to patients who opt for NHS treatment, to deter use of private facilities.

In addition, £609 million was spent on emergency medical or surgical treatment.

50|$|National schemes {{have the}} {{advantage}} that the pool or pools {{tend to be very}} very large and reflective of the national population. Health care costs, which tend to be high at certain stages in life such as during pregnancy and childbirth and especially {{in the last few years}} of life can be paid into the pool over a lifetime and be higher when earnings capacity is greatest to meet costs incurred at times when earnings capacity is low or non existent. This differs from the private insurance schemes that operate in some countries which tend to price insurance year on year according to health risks such as age, family history, previous illnesses, and height/weight ratios. Thus some people tend to have to pay more for their health insurance when they are sick and/or are least able to afford it. These factors are not taken into consideration in NHI schemes. In <b>private</b> <b>schemes</b> in competitive insurance markets, these activities by insurance companies tend to act against the basic principles of insurance which is group solidarity.|$|E

5000|$|Systems {{of health}} {{insurance}} usually consisted of <b>private</b> <b>schemes</b> such as Friendly societies or Welfare societies. Under the National Insurance Act 1911, introduced by David Lloyd George, a small amount was deducted from weekly wages, to which was added contributions from the employer and the government. In return for the record of contributions, the workman was entitled to medical care (as well as retirement and unemployment benefits) though not necessarily to the drugs prescribed. To obtain medical care, he registered with a doctor. Each doctor in General Practice {{who participated in the}} scheme thus had a 'panel' of those who have made an insurance under the system, and was paid a capitation grant out of the fund calculated upon the number. Lloyd George's name survives in the [...] "Lloyd George envelopes" [...] in which most primary care records in England are stored, although today most working records in primary care are at least partially computerised. This imperfect scheme only covered workers who paid their National Insurance Contributions and was known as 'Lloyd George's Ambulance Wagon'. Most women and children were not covered.|$|E
50|$|Healthcare {{provision}} in Indonesia {{has traditionally been}} fragmented, with private insurance provision for those {{able to pay for}} it alongside basic public coverage for the poorest in society and NGOs working in specialised areas providing services to those not covered by public or <b>private</b> <b>schemes.</b> In January 2014, the Indonesian government launched Jaminan Kesehatan Nasional (JKN), a scheme to implement universal health care in Indonesia. It is expected that spending on healthcare will increase by 12% a year and reach US$46 billion a year by 2019. Under JKN, all Indonesians will receive coverage for a range of treatments via health services from public providers as well as those private organisations that have opted to join the scheme. The formally employed pay a premium worth five percent of their salary, with one percent being paid by the employee and four percent being paid by their employer. Informal workers and the self-employed pay a fixed monthly premium of between 25,500 and 59,500 IDR (£1.34-£3.12). However, the scheme has been criticised for being over-ambitious, a lack of competency in administration, and a failure to address the need for improving healthcare infrastructure in remote areas. An official for the programme's administering organisation, the social security agency Badan Penyelenggara Jaminan Sosial Kesehatan, has stated that JKN exceeded its target for enrolling members in its first year (registering 133.4 million members compared to a target of 121.6 million) and that, according to an independent survey, the customer satisfaction rate was 81 percent, awareness of JKN was 95 percent, and that complaints had been resolved within one and a half days on average. JKN is expected to be implemented in stages. When the initial stages came into effect in January 2014, 48% of the country's population became covered. It is expected that the entire population will be covered in 2019.|$|E
