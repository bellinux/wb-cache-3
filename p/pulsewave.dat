50|$|Six {{months after}} defecting from QUILL, Gunvolt is offered a {{freelance}} assignment by Moniqa, his handler from QUILL, {{to investigate and}} take out several agents of the Sumeragi Group. The Sumeragi agents are all adepts as well, but powered by strange Glaives, which house their essences, and are representative {{of each of the}} Seven Deadly Sins. The first agent, Merak, is a lazy, unenthusiastic adept with the power to bend space for use in his attacks. The second, Jota, is a prideful agent with the power to manipulate light. The third, Viper, is loud and brash, has control over fire, and harbors a jealous rage against Gunvolt for Joule. The fourth, Carerra, uses magnetic fists and waves to draw his enemies close before destroying them with a powerful <b>pulsewave.</b> The fifth, Elise, is a split personality adept: her meek, timid side and her brash, assertive side are at constant odds, but her ability to raise the dead allows for even adepts to come back from defeat. The sixth, Stratos, is a drug-addicted adept with an insatiable hunger for the very drug that keeps what little of his sanity remains in check, and has control over swarms of insects. Additionally, a seventh adept, the bigender and carnal Zonda, attacks and wounds Zeno, one of Gunvolt's friends from QUILL, but is seemingly killed by a human warrior named Copen, who harbors a major hatred for adepts and carries a gun capable of firing bullets that can suppress their powers. Copen warns Gunvolt that they are not on the same side, and after a brief skirmish, retreats.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: We present recent {{advances}} in full waveform LiDAR processing based on the new <b>PulseWaves</b> data exchange format and the associated processing API for easier export, dissemination, and access of full waveform data in a vendor neutral manner. The <b>PulseWaves</b> format is a new data exchange format that tries to replicate {{the success of the}} popular LAS format but is aimed at storing the entire digitized waveform instead of discrete returns in a fully geo-referenced manner. In the past full waveform processing was a slowly advancing science with every researcher first having to implement readers for some proprietary vendor-specific waveform format and then converting them to their own ASCII representations. As the exchange of research results was practically impossible due to each team relying on their own data formats and the availability of commercial solutions was hindered by the lack of a common standard. In this talk we will {{look at some of the}} recent successes of <b>PulseWaves</b> such as the integration of exporter into RIEGL and Optech software to motivate researchers to build on the <b>PulseWaves</b> API in their work and "pick the low-hanging " fruits that advancing full waveform processing offers to young scientists. 1...|$|R
40|$|In {{reflection}} plethysmography at {{the finger}} inverted <b>pulsewaves</b> are sometimes observed, especially when, during anaesthesia, arterial pressure {{is measured in}} the same arm with an inflatable cuff. The origin of this inversion is investigated in two series of experiments with volunteers. In the first series of experiments {{the influence of the}} pressure in the upper arm cuff was investigated and in the second series the influence of the application pressure of the transducer on the finger. It is concluded that inversion of the pulse waves of the plethysmogram is a local phenomenon restricted to the reflection method. It is caused by a relative increase in the optical density of the surrounding tissue in relation to the arterial vessels. In the finger it is brought about by venous engorgement and it is dependent on the applied pressure. Photoelectric plethysmography is often used during anaesthesia to monitor the peripheral circulatio...|$|R

40|$|We {{aimed to}} {{validate}} a new method for measuring arterial <b>pulsewave</b> transit time and <b>pulsewave</b> velocity (a measure of arterial elasticity), {{based on the}} principle of photoplethysmography (PPG), and to compare transcutaneous values with those obtained by intra-arterial measurements. Three validation experiments are described. (a) PPG pulse wave delay times (defined as the time interval between the ECG R wave and the foot of the arterial pulse wave measured at the wrist or ankle) were compared to values obtained simultaneously from an established methodology (Doppler ultrasound). (b) Aortic <b>pulsewave</b> delay times in 17 subjects obtained non-invasively by the PPG method were compared with those obtained from the intra-arterial pressure wave. (c) Repeatability measurements of PWV on the same subjects were carried out over two timescales (minutes and hours) in the arm, the leg and the trunk. The Doppler and PPG delay times correlated well, as did intra-arterial and transcutaneous values. Repeatability at short timescales was good (coefficients of variation (CV) < 6 % for all measurement sites) and, at the longer timescale, was satisfactory (CVs in the aorta, the arm and leg were 6. 3, 13. 1 and 16. 0, respectively). The PWV values agreed well with others in the literature. We conclude that the PPG technique provides a complement to existing methods for the non-invasive measurement of arterial compliance. Its simplicity and ease of use make it suitable for large-scale epidemiological studies...|$|E

40|$|Modelflow is {{a method}} that determines stroke volume (SV) from central or {{peripheral}} continuous blood pressure signals. Pulsewaves are changed along the arterial tree; distortion occurs as the mean pressure level gradually declines. These changes might jeopardize the determination of SV from a distal measurement site. Techniques have been assessed to reconstruct brachial artery pressures (BAPs) from non-invasive finger blood pressure (FIN) waveforms. In this study, we determined the effect of different forms of brachial reconstruction techniques on the comparability of modelflow SV from FIN and BAP. Supine resting FIN and BAP were measured simultaneously in 57 subjects, covering {{a wide range of}} blood pressures and degrees of vascular disease. SV from the two sites were compared before correction and after correction for <b>pulsewave</b> distortion or pressure gradient. The latter was determined by a regression formula and by a return to flow (RTF) method, using the brachial cuff pressure at the moment of reappearance of FIN during cuff deflation. SV from unfiltered FIN exceeded BAP-derived SV by 4. 6 (SD 11) ml. This difference was positively related to the subjects' age. Correction for <b>pulsewave</b> distortion increased the average difference to 13 (12) ml (P < 0. 05 to the unfiltered condition). Adjustment for the pressure gradient reduced the difference to - 2. 5 (7) ml (P < 0. 01). RTF had no additional effect. We concluded that the FIN-to-BAP comparability can be increased by brachial reconstruction techniques, which correct for the pressure gradient. This can be adequately performed without additional measurements, allowing its application to measurements already take...|$|E

METHODS: We conducted a prospective panel study in 22 people with type 2 diabetes mellitus in Chapel Hill, North Carolina (USA), from November 2004 to December 2005. We acquired daily measurements of PM 2. 5 and meteorologic data at central monitoring sites. On 4 consecutive days, we measured endothelial function by brachial artery ultrasound in all participants and by <b>pulsewave</b> measurements in a subgroup.

Echocardiographic Doppler measurements were performed under standardized conditions to assess (1) the carotid and femoral artery diameter and intima-media thickness, (2) brachial artery endothelial function using flow-mediated dilation, and (3) central and peripheral compliance using <b>pulsewave</b> velocity. In addition, the physical activity level was assessed using a validated questionnaire. We found that the physical activity level of the children with TOF was {{lower than that of}} the controls, but the difference did not reach statistical significance (4. 5 vs 5. 9 h/wk, p = 0. 087). A significantly larger femoral artery intima-media thickness was observed in those with TOF, and the carotid and brachial artery diameter and intima-media thickness were comparable between groups. The children with TOF demonstrated a significantly lower brachial artery flow-mediated dilation than that of the controls. The central and peripheral compliance did not differ between the 2 groups. In conclusion, children with TOF demonstrated an impaired brachial artery endothelial function and increased intima-media thickness of the femoral artery compared to their healthy peers.

40|$|Background-—Postextrasystolic blood {{pressure}} potentiation (PESP), the <b>pulsewave</b> augmentation after an extrasystolic beat, is typically enhanced in heart failure (HF) patients. This study prospectively tested {{the association of}} PESP and mortality in cardiac patients. Methods and Results-—Consecutive patients (n= 941; mean age, 61 years; 19 % female) presenting with acute myocardial infarction were enrolled between May 2000 and March 2005 and followed up until August 2010. The main study outcome was 5 -year all-cause mortality. Patients underwent noninvasive 30 -minute recordings of ECG and continuous {{blood pressure}}. PESP presence {{was based on the}} ratio between the first postectopic pulse wave amplitude and themean of the subsequent 9 pulse wave amplitudes. A ratio above 1 was prospectively defined as PESP present. Ventricular premature complexes (VPCs) suitable for PESP quantification were present in recordings of 220 patients. PESP was present in 62 of these patients. Patients without suitable VPCs were classified as PESP absent. During the follow-up, 72 patients died. Among the 220 patients inwhomPESPwasmeasurable, 27 died. Under univariable analysis, PESP {{was a significant predictor of}} death (P< 0. 001) aswereGRACE score (P< 0. 001), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (P< 0. 001), and the number of recorded VPCs (P< 0. 001). Under multivariable analysis, PESP (P< 0. 001), GRACE score (P< 0. 001), and LVEF (P= 0. 001) were independently associated with outcome. The combination of PESP presence and LVEF ≤ 35 % identified a subgroup of patients with a particularly high mortality of 46. 7 %.

However, the prevalence and relationship between USD and CVD risk have not been fully examined in the Chinese population. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional study of 10, 281 participants in rural China. All subjects underwent renal ultrasound to detect USD, brachial−ankle <b>pulsewave</b> velocity (baPWV) measurement to estimate arterial stiffness, and ankle−brachial index (ABI) examination to detect peripheral arterial disease (PAD) (defined as ABI < 0. 9 on at least 1 side of the body). Results: Mean age of the study population was 55. 4 ± 10. 0 years; 47. 1 % were men. Among all participants, 5. 7 % (n = 582) had USD, mean baPWV was 15. 6 ± 3. 2 m/s, and 4. 0 % had PAD. The prevalence of USD increased in parallel with mean arterial pressure, albuminuria, Framingham risk score, and baPWV. In multivariate analyses after adjustment for demographic characteristics, USD {{was significantly associated with}} an increased risk of hypertension (odds ratio [OR]: 1. 32; 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1. 08 − 1. 62), albuminuria (OR: 2. 17; 95 % CI: 1. 74 − 2. 69), chronic kidney disease (OR: 2. 11; 95 % CI: 1. 70 − 2. 62), increased arterial stiffness (OR: 1. 24; 95 % CI: 1. 01 − 1. 52), and PAD (OR: 1. 50; 95 % CI: 1. 04 − 2. 16).

40|$|Coal-cleaning {{processes}} {{have been}} utilized {{to increase the}} heating value of coal by extracting ash-forming minerals in the coal. These processes involve the crushing or grinding of raw coal followed by physical separation processes, {{taking advantage of the}} density difference between carbonaceous particles and mineral particles. In addition to the desired increase in the heating value of coal, a significant reduction of the sulfur content of the coal fed to a combustion unit is effected by the removal of pyrite and other sulfides found in the mineral matter. WRI is assisting <b>PulseWave</b> to develop an alternate, more efficient method of liberating and separating the undesirable mineral matter from the carbonaceous matter in coal. The approach is based on PulseWave's patented resonance disintegration technology that reduces that particle size of materials by application of destructive resonance, shock waves, and vortex generating forces. Illinois No. 5 coal, a Wyodak coal, and a Pittsburgh No. 8 coal were processed using the resonance disintegration apparatus then subjected to conventional density separations. Initial microscopic results indicate that up to 90 % of the pyrite could be liberated from the coal in the machine, but limitations in the density separations reduced overall effectiveness of contaminant removal. Approximately 30 - 80 % of the pyritic sulfur and 30 - 50 % of the mercury was removed from the coal. The three coals (both with and without the pyritic phase separated out) were tested in WRI's 250, 000 Btu/hr Combustion Test Facility, designed to replicate a coal-fired utility boiler. The flue gases were characterized for elemental, particle bound, and total mercury in addition to sulfur.

We aimed to exam the importance of glycemic control on progression/regression of carotid-femoral <b>pulsewave</b> velocity (cf-PWV) in type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS In a prospective study, two cf-PWV measurements were performed with the Complior equipment in 417 patients with type 2 diabetes over a mean follow-up of 4. 2 years. Clinical laboratory data were obtained at baseline and throughout follow-up. Multivariable linear/logistic regressions assessed the independent {{correlates of}} changes in cf-PWV. RESULTS Median cf-PWV increase was 0. 11 m/s/year (1. 1 % per year). Overall, 212 patients (51 %) increased/persisted with high cf-PWV, while 205 (49 %) reduced/persisted with low cf-PWV. Multivariate linear regression demonstrated direct associations between cf-PWV changes and mean HbA 1 c during follow-up (partial correlation 0. 14, P = 0. 005). On logistic regression, a mean HbA 1 c ‡ 7. 5 % (58 mmol/mol) was associated with twofold higher odds of having increased/persistently high cf-PWV during follow-up. Furthermore, the rate of HbA 1 c reduction relative to baseline levels was inversely associated with cf-PWV changes (partial correlation 20. 11, P = 0. 011) and associated with reduced risk of having increased/persistently high aortic stiffness (odds ratio 0. 82 [95 % CI 0. 69 – 0. 96]; P = 0. 017). Other independent correlates of progression in aortic stiffness were increases in systolic blood pres-sure and heart rate between the two cf-PWV measurements, older age, female sex, and presence of dyslipidemia and retinopathy. CONCLUSIONS Better glycemic control, together with reductions in blood pressure and heart rate, {{were the most important}} correlates to attenuate/prevent progression of aortic stiffness in patients with type 2 diabetes...|$|E
40|$|Background and {{objectives}} Whether improvements in arterial compliance with BP lowering are because of BP reduction alone or if pleiotropic effects of antihypertensive agents contribute remains unclear. It was hypothesized that, among patients on hemodialysis, {{compared with a}} b-blocker (atenolol), a lisinopril-based therapy will better reduce arterial stiffness. Design, setting, participants, & measurements Among 200 participants of the Hypertension in Hemodialysis Patients TreatedwithAtenolol or Lisinopril Trial, 179 patientswith valid assessment of aortic <b>pulsewave</b> velocity at baseline (89 patients randomly assigned to open-label lisinopril and 90 patients randomly assigned to atenolol {{three times a week}} after dialysis) were included in the secondary analysis. Among them, 109 patients had a valid pulse wave velocity measurement at 6 months. Monthly measured home BP was targeted to, 140 / 90 mmHg by addition of antihypertensive drugs and dry weight adjustment. The difference between drugs in percentage change of aortic pulse wave velocity from baseline to 6 months was analyzed. Results Contrary to the hypothesis, atenolol-based treatment induced greater reduction in aortic pulse wave velocity relative to lisinopril (between drug difference, 14. 8 %; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 5 % to 28. 5 %; P= 0. 03). Reduction in 44 -hour ambulatory systolic and diastolic BP was no different between groups (median [25 th, 75 th percentile]; atenolol: 221. 5 [237. 7, 27. 6] versus lisinopril: 215. 8 [228. 8, 21. 5] mmHg; P= 0. 27 for systolic BP; 214. 1 [222. 6, 25. 3] versus 210. 9 [218. 4, 20. 9] mmHg, respectively; P= 0. 30 for diastolic BP). Between-drug difference in change of aortic pulse wave velocity persisted after adjustments for age, sex, race, other cardio-vascular risk factors, and baseline ambulatory systolic BP but disappeared after adjustment for change in am-bulatory systolic BP (11. 8 %; 95 % confidence interval, 22. 3 % to 25. 9 %; P= 0. 10). Conclusions Among patients on dialysis, atenolol was superior in improving arterial stiffness. However, differences between atenolol and lisinopril in improving aortic stiffness among patients on hemodialysis may be explained by BP-lowering effects of drugs...|$|E

Overmore, changes in peripher vascular reactivity influenced by the oral glucose tolerance test were analysed by digital photoplethysmography and the Reflective Index, a characteristic parameter of the <b>pulsewave.</b> Intracellular free calcium was determined by Ca 2 + sensitive Fura 2 Acetoxymethylester and measured by fluorescence spectroscopy. Extracellular concentrations of superoxid anions were measured by the sensitive marcer Lucigenin. Results: Both 60 and 120 minutes after oral glucose stress the Reflective Index in patients was significantly reduced (n= 24, p< 0, 01) but not in healthy people. The investigation of cytosolic free calcium in lymphocytes from patients with essential hypertonia revealed decisive changes: In patients lymphocytes a significant increase of intracellular free calcium could be determined as well as 60 minutes and 120 minutes after OGTT (n= 24, p< 0, 01). In contrast, cytosolic Ca 2 + significantly increased not until 120 minutes after oral glucose stress in normal lymphocytes (n= 24, p< 0, 05). Whereas the addition of Phorbol  12  myristate  13  acetate caused a significant increase of intracellular Ca 2 + in cells of patients with essential hypertonia (n= 24, p< 0, 001), the Phorbol  12  myristate  13  acetate-induced calcium influx in normal lymphocytes was {{not significantly different from}} the starting results. Also, the in vitro-stimulation of lymphocytes from patients with {{essential hypertension}} with insuline led to a significant increase of cytosolic free calcium 120 minutes after glucose administration (n= 24, p< 0, 05) contrary to the effect to cells from healthy people with no significant change of intracellular Ca 2 +. Both patients with essential hypertension and healthy normotensive controls responded similarly to the in vitro-stimulation of cells with glucose with a significant increase of cytosolic free calcium 120 minutes after OGTT (n = 48, p< 0, 01). Finally, the release of superoxid anions after oral glucose administration was not significantly different from the starting results in none of both investigated groups. In fact, no significant effect of OGTT on superoxid anion production in human lymphocytes was determined but striking increases of intracellular free calcium after oral glucose administration...|$|E

This study intended to compare vascular characteristics of patients with chronic renal failure to those with normal renal function (Control; age 65 ± 1 years, n= 145). Patients with chronic renal failure were divided into three groups: First, end-stage renal failure undergoing hemodialysis (HD; age 65 ± 1 years, n= 124), second, patients with renal transplantation (NTX; age 51 ± 2 years, n= 55) and third, compensated chronic renal failure (CRF; age 72 ± 2 years, n= 40). We used digital photoplethysmography as a non-invasive, continous and investigator-independent method to analyse digital pulse waveforms. Vascular function was characterized first by reflective index (RI), a marker of diastolic component of <b>pulsewave</b> and second by the second derivative of photoplethysmogram waveform (SDPTG) consisting of an a, b, c and d peak, considering both systolic and diastolic component of pulswave. Endothelial function was assessed by endothelium-dependent flow mediated dilation (FMD) to reactive hyperemia after forearm ischemia. A significant increase of RI in patients undergoing hemodialysis compared to controls was found (p< 0, 05). (Con 31, 1 ± 0, 9 %; HD 35, 8 ± 1, 0 %; NTX 35, 2 ± 1, 8 %; CRF 34, 1 ± 0, 6 %). Endothelial function, analyzed by FMD and assessed by the change of basal RI to RImaximum following forearm ischemia was lower in hemodialysis patients (p< 0, 05) and in renal transplantated patients (p< 0, 01) compared to controls. (Changes of RI: Con 17, 9 ± 2, 6 %, HD 5, 4 ± 3, 3 %; NTX 3, 0 ± 3, 7 % and CRF 17, 3 ± 1, 7 %). RI was significantly correlated to glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimated by using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation (p= 0, 0008) and creatinine clearance estimated by using the Cockcroft-Gault (CG) equation (p= 0, 0005). Furthermore RI showed significantly correlations to serum concentrations of creatinine (p= 0, 0007) and urea (p= 0, 0082) and to mean SpO 2 (p< 0, 0001). RImaximum and RIreactive-hyperemia, as the markers for endothelial function were significantly correlated to blood pressure. RIreactive-hyperemia was significantly correlated to systolic blood pressure (p= 0, 0163), to diastolic blood pressure (p= 0, 0197) and to mean blood pressure (p= 0, 0194). RImaximum was significantly correlated to diastolic blood pressure (p= 0, 0454) Analyzed ratios of the peaks a, b and d (B/A and D/A), derived from SDPTG showed {{no significant differences between}} controls and different groups of chronic renal failure. B/A correlated significantly with age (p= 0, 0291) and D/A correlated significantly with mean SpO 2 (p= 0, 0002).

40|$|Background: The {{pathogenesis}} of cerebral {{small vessel}} disease (SVD), encompassing lacunar infarction (LI) and leukoaraiosis (LA), is heterogeneous, with impaired endothelial function (EF) and altered fibrinolysis proposed as important contributors. Genetic factors are involved and may exert their influence via the above mechanisms. The {{aim of this}} study was to explore the relationship between EF and SVD, and to examine the role of candidate polymorphisms in both EF and SVD. Methods: The study cohort consisted of patients who had undergone a brain magnetic resonance image (MRI) scan for non-vascular indications. Vascular risk factors were collected by interviewing participants. SVD was classified using a modified Fazekas rating scale, where SVD burden was divided into three categories: absent/mild, moderate and severe. LI was graded separately. EF was assessed using applanation tonometry (ApT) and the radial <b>pulsewave.</b> A global EF score that accounts for both endothelium-dependant and –independent vasodilation was used as the index for comparison. A higher global EF score indicated better EF. Participants were genotyped using the sequence-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR-SS) for eight candidate polymorphisms chosen based on biological plausibility and/or previous study evidence: interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) - 174 G/C, NADPH oxidase p 22 phox 242 C/T, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) 20324 C/T, tPA - 4360 G/C, tPA - 7351 C/T, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) - 786 T/C, endothelin- 1 (ET- 1) 138 D/I and paraoxonase- 1 (PON 1) - 107 C/T. Statistical analyses were performed using Intercooled Stata 9. 2, GraphPad Prism and the SNPstats. Regression models were adjusted for the appropriate variables. Results: A total of 132 participants were assessed. All participants were genotyped and 84 of these 132 participants also had their EF assessed using ApT, but only 72 participants were successful. Participants were graded separately for LI and LA. LA controls (n= 119) were defined as participants with absent/mild LA, and LA cases (n= 13) were participants with moderate or severe LA. LI controls (n= 126) were participants without a radiologically defined LI and LI cases (n= 6) were participants with radiologically defined LI. The results of the study can be summarised as follows: 1. there was no significant difference between the EF of cases and controls. Subgroup analyses showed that the risk of LA decreased as the global EF values increased after adjusting for confounding influences, but the relationship was not significant (p= 0. 23); 2. there were no significant differences in EF between the genotypes of the eight candidate polymorphisms, except for the tPA 20324 C/T, where the TT genotype was associated with higher EF compared to the CC/CT genotypes (p= 0. 02); 3. the tPA 20324 TT genotype was significantly associated with an increased risk of LI compared to the CC/CT genotypes (p= 0. 03), although the association is under powered. No other significant associations were found. Although the intent was to achieve a pre-determined sample size, the methodology, and in particular the exclusion criteria, restricted recruitment and consequently the study was under powered to achieve its goals. The study could therefore be considered a pilot study and any conclusions forthwith require validation in a larger sample. Conclusion: The tPA 20324 TT genotype was significantly associated with LI, while also being significantly associated with better EF. This result may be a Type I error reflective of the small sample size. However, the result does support the hypothesis that impaired fibrinolysis has an important pathogenic role in LI. This study does not support impaired EF as a significant pathogenic contributor to SVD. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Adelaide, School of Medicine, 201...|$|E
