500|$|Neverwinter Nights 2 was unofficially {{announced}} on April 1, 2004, when an Atari employee listed {{the names of}} several games in development, including a [...] "NWN2" [...] {{in response to an}} inflammatory comment on Atari's forums. The company officially announced the game on August 4, 2004. Obsidian Entertainment handled development of the game, and BioWare, the company that created the first Neverwinter Nights, offered support and guidance to Obsidian. The two companies collaborated in a similar manner on , an Obsidian–developed sequel to a BioWare game. BioWare joint CEO Ray Muzyka said [...] "Neverwinter Nights {{remains one of the most}} important titles BioWare has ever created. We certainly plan to remain involved in the production and development of Neverwinter Nights 2". Obsidian employed several game designers from the defunct Black Isle Studios, which developed other Dungeons & Dragons role-playing video games such as , the Icewind Dale series, and the Baldur's Gate series. [...] Development of Neverwinter Nights 2 began in July 2004, when Obsidian assigned several staff members to work on the <b>project.</b> <b>Staff</b> included Darren Monahan, the producer of several Icewind Dale and [...] games; Marc Holmes, art director of the first Neverwinter Nights; and Chris Avellone, lead designer of Planescape: Torment and Knights of the Old Republic II.|$|E
500|$|Physicist Isidor Rabi noticed Oppenheimer's disconcerting triumphalism: [...] "I'll {{never forget}} his walk; I'll {{never forget the}} way {{he stepped out of}} the car... his walk was like High Noon... this kind of strut. He had done it." [...] At an {{assembly}} at Los Alamos on August 6 (the evening of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima), Oppenheimer took to the stage and clasped his hands together [...] "like a prize-winning boxer" [...] while the crowd cheered. He noted his regret the weapon had not been available in time to use against Nazi Germany. However, he and many of the <b>project</b> <b>staff</b> were very upset about the bombing of Nagasaki, as they did not feel the second bomb was necessary from a military point of view. He traveled to Washington on August 17 to hand-deliver a letter to Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson expressing his revulsion and his wish to see nuclear weapons banned. In October 1945 Oppenheimer was granted an interview with President Harry S Truman. The meeting, however, went badly, after Oppenheimer remarked he felt he had [...] "blood on my hands". The remark infuriated Truman {{and put an end to}} the meeting. Truman later told his Undersecretary of State Dean Acheson [...] "I don't want to see that son-of-a-bitch in this office ever again." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{describing}} the government's {{response to the}} SNM offensive, the report observed: The government response to the attack has been particularly brutal and without regard to civilian casualties – in fact {{there is ample evidence}} that civilian casualties have been deliberately inflicted so as to destroy the support base of the SNM, which is composed mainly of people from the Isaaq tribe. Following the SNM attacks on the major towns of Hargeisa and Burao, government forces bombed the towns – causing over 400,000 people to flee the atrocities across the border into Ethiopia, where they are now located in refugee camps, living in appalling conditions, with inadequate water, food, shelter and medical facilities.In Sanaag region access to villages by CAA staff was denied by the military and project resources such as vehicles and drugs misappropriated by government officials. This combined with poor security, made primary health work impossible and endangered the lives of staff, leading to a withdrawal by the agency. <b>Project</b> <b>staff</b> were frequently harassed by the military even when attending medical emergencies and on one occasion shots were fired. Whilst human right have been deteriorating for some years in Somalia...we believe that the government must bear a particularly heavy responsibility for events over the last six months. With regards to atrocities specific to Erigavo the report noted:The military occupation of Erigavo has resulted in widespread suffering for the people of that area forcing many people flee to the bush including most of the population of Erigavo. It is believed that the military gave the elders of the village money in payment for boys as young as twelve and thirteen years of age. Untrained and disciplined, these youths were armed with AK47s and sent to patrol the town, unsure and ignorant of how to use their newly acquired power.The report noted one case where a 13-year-old girl from Erigavo was raped by six government soldiers, it also stated that [...] "looting, raping and bashing are commonplace." [...] In a separate case, a man leaving Erigavo with money and food was [...] "robbed, beaten and shot by the military." [...] His body was then [...] "dumped in the town and was eaten to the waist by hyenas." ...|$|E
