Regional localization of the subunit <b>messenger</b> <b>RNAs</b> was determined with film autoradiography and expression in identified neuronal cell populations was examined using higher resolution techniques. Each of the GABAA receptor subunit <b>messenger</b> <b>RNAs</b> exhibits a distinct pattern of localization in the developing and adult brain. Of the subunits examined, the alpha 1, beta 2, and gamma 2 are the most abundant and are found in many brain regions, including the olfactory bulb, cortex, hippocampus, thalamic nuclei, and inferior colliculus. In addition, these subunit <b>messenger</b> <b>RNAs</b> are prominent in the cerebellum where virtually all cells of the deep cerebellar nuclei and Purkinje cell layer are labeled.

40|$|The β-amyloid {{precursor}} protein is the precursor {{of the main}} component of senile plaques (the β-amyloid peptide or β/A 4) found in the brain of aged humans and, in higher amounts, in the brain of Alzheimer's disease and Down's syndrome subjects. Four different forms of β-amyloid {{precursor protein}} <b>messenger</b> <b>RNAs</b> have been described in humans and rodents: β-amyloid precursor protein 695, β-amyloid precursor protein 714, β-amyloid precursor protein 751 and β-amyloid precursor protein 770 <b>messenger</b> <b>RNAs</b> (numbers corresponding to the number of encoded amino acids). The two latter forms are characterized by containing in their sequence a region with high homology to the Kunitz family of serine protease inhibitors. We have used oligonucleotide probes to study the distribution of the different <b>messenger</b> <b>RNAs</b> encoding each of the four β-amyloid precursor proteins by in situ hybridization histochemistry in human, rat and mouse brain. We found that β-amyloid precursor protein 695, β-amyloid precursor protein 714 and β-amyloid precursor protein 751 <b>messenger</b> <b>RNAs</b> were widely distributed in the human, rat and mouse brain and that their distribution was roughly similar in most brain areas in these three species. The distribution of β-amyloid precursor protein 770 <b>messenger</b> <b>RNA</b> was not so wide and differed among the three species studied. β-amyloid precursor protein 751 and 770 <b>messenger</b> <b>RNAs</b> were the only forms present at significant levels in rodent choroid plexus and meninges, while β-amyloid precursor protein <b>messenger</b> <b>RNA</b> isoforms containing and lacking the Kunitz domain were detected in the human choroid plexus. We also observed that the relative levels of β-amyloid precursor protein 751 and 770 <b>messenger</b> <b>RNAs</b> in the rat cerebral white matter {{as well as in the}} mouse and human striatum were higher than those of the β-amyloid precursor protein <b>messenger</b> <b>RNAs</b> lacking the Kunitz domain. While the most abundant β-amyloid precursor protein <b>messenger</b> <b>RNAs</b> in the brain of all three species under study were, in descending order, β-amyloid precursor protein 695 and β-amyloid precursor protein 751 <b>messenger</b> <b>RNAs,</b> the least abundant form was not the same for all species: in human it was β-amyloid precursor protein 714 <b>messenger</b> <b>RNA</b> and in rat and mouse brain it was β-amyloid precursor protein 770 <b>messenger</b> <b>RNA.</b> Our results show differences both inter- and intraspecies of the relative abundance and distribution of four β-amyloid precursor protein <b>messenger</b> <b>RNAs</b> in rat, mouse and human brain.

The expression of neurotrophin- 3 <b>messenger</b> <b>RNA</b> in nuclear chain fibers, which were found in muscle spindles from day 6 after birth, was low and insignificant in comparison to the expression in the nuclear bag fibers. After completion of muscle spindle formation around the third week after birth, high levels of neurotrophin- 3 <b>messenger</b> <b>RNA</b> remained present in the intrafusal fibers throughout life. During the entire period of muscle formation, examined from E 15 on, as well as in mature muscles, no neurotrophin- 3 <b>messenger</b> <b>RNA</b> could be detected in extrafusal fibers by in situ hybridization.

Interaction between striatal dopaminergic and adenosinergic systems have also been reported. Adenosine and the adenosine receptor antagonist, caffeine, regulate gene expression in the striatum. In the present study, in situ hybridization histochemistry was used to investigate the putative regulation of neurotensin and cholecystokinin <b>messenger</b> <b>RNA</b> expression by caffeine in the rat striatum. Using this method, cholecystokinin <b>messenger</b> <b>RNA</b> was undetectable and neurotensin <b>messenger</b> <b>RNA</b> very sparse in the normal striatum. Chronic caffeine administration induced a dramatic increase in neurotensin <b>messenger</b> <b>RNA</b> in the subcallosal region of the caudate-putamen and a moderate increase in the shell sector of the accumbens nucleus. Similarly, caffeine induced a significant striatal expression of cholecystokinin <b>messenger</b> <b>RNA</b> in the dorsolateral and ventrolateral quadrants but was not restricted to the subcallosal area. At the cellular level, this corresponded to a significant labeling of a moderate to high density of medium-sized striatal neurons. These distributions were identical to those of neurotensin and cholecystokinin <b>messenger</b> <b>RNAs</b> observed in the case of disruption of dopaminergic transmission. We therefore concluded that in the intact striatum normally innervated by dopaminergic fibers, caffeine, probably acting through a presynaptic A 2 receptor, induced a relative dopamine depletion which in turn led to the induction of neurotensin and cholecystokinin expression in subsets of striatal neurons.

Results: Patients with carcinoembryonic antigen <b>messenger</b> <b>RNA</b> in the preoperative blood samples had a poor survival when compared with those without carcinoembryonic antigen <b>messenger</b> <b>RNA.</b> Of these patients, the worst survival was seen in those with carcinoembryonic antigen <b>messenger</b> <b>RNA</b> in the postoperative blood samples.

40|$|In this study, {{we report}} a {{comparative}} {{analysis of the}} distribution of brain-derived neurotrophic factor <b>messenger</b> <b>RNA</b> in the binocular primary visual cortex of rats analysed {{at the end of the}} critical period for monocular deprivation (postnatal day 35) and during adulthood (postnatal day 90). High-resolution non-isotopic ia situ hybridization coupled with Nissl staining allowed to determine the relative number of neurons expressing brain-derived neurotrophic factor <b>messenger</b> <b>RNA.</b> In postnatal day 90 rats, the relative number of neurons positive for brain-derived neurotrophic factor <b>messenger</b> <b>RNA</b> significantly decreases in layer II/III with respect to postnatal day 35 animals, being constant in all the other cortical layers. Moreover, we demonstrate that dark rearing for 22 days, starting from postnatal day 90, determines: (i) a decrease of the overall level of brain-derived neurotrophic factor <b>messenger</b> <b>RNA</b> with a consequent reduction of labelling intensity in all cells throughout cortical layers II-VI; (ii) an increase of cell numbers expressing brain-derived neurotrophic factor <b>messenger</b> <b>RNA</b> in layers IV and V; and (iii) a decreased intensity of staining for brain-derived neurotrophic factor <b>messenger</b> <b>RNA</b> in dendrites after dark rearing. A re-exposure to light for 2 h after the period of darkness almost restores the number of brain-derived neurotrophic factor RNA-positive neurons. We conclude that the maturation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor <b>messenger</b> <b>RNA</b> in neurons of layer II/III goes beyond postnatal days 35 - 40, which can be considered the end of the critical period [Fagiolini M. et al. (1994) Vis. Res., 34, 709 - 720]. Moreover, we show that the cellular expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor <b>messenger</b> <b>RNA</b> is regulated by light in adult rats as well as during development...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that innervation modulates GABAA receptor gene expression in the rodent cerebellum. To examine this question, the expression and levels of GABAA receptor subunit <b>messenger</b> <b>RNAs</b> in the deep cerebellar nuclei of Purkinje cell degeneration mice and littermate controls were examined by quantitative in situ hybridization histochemistry. In the Purkinje cell degeneration mutant, the selective postnatal degeneration of Purkinje neurons disrupts GABAergic input from the cerebellar cortex to the deep nuclei. Despite this loss of Purkinje cells, virtually all large neurons of the deep cerebellar nuclei of Purkinje cell degeneration animals expressed the alpha 1, beta 2, and gamma 2 subunit <b>messenger</b> <b>RNAs.</b> These subunit <b>messenger</b> <b>RNAs</b> were observed at all experimental times from postnatal day 24 to postnatal day 90, a period ranging from the onset of behavioral abnormalities in the mutant to the completion of Purkinje cell loss. At no time were additional beta subunit <b>messenger</b> <b>RNAs,</b> normally absent from the deep cerebellar nuclei in control mice, detected in this region of the mutant. Quantitative analysis of the hybridization signals over individual neurons revealed that Purkinje cell loss differentially affected the expression of GABAA receptor subunit <b>messenger</b> <b>RNAs.</b> While the levels of the beta 2 and gamma 2 subunit <b>messenger</b> <b>RNAs</b> in individual neurons were comparable in mutants and controls at all ages, differences in alpha 1 subunit <b>messenger</b> <b>RNA</b> expression were observed. At postnatal day 24, the level of alpha 1 subunit mRNA in individual neurons of the mutant was only 60 % that found in the control. At later stages (postnatal day 60 to postnatal day 90), the levels of alpha 1 subunit <b>messenger</b> <b>RNA</b> expression increased in the mutant, and similar grain densities were detected over mutant and control neurons. These studies demonstrate that Purkinje cell innervation is not required to maintain the expression of <b>messenger</b> <b>RNAs</b> encoding the alpha 1, beta 2 and gamma 2 GABAA receptor subunits in the deep cerebellar nuclei of the Purkinje cell degeneration mutant. However, Purkinje cell input appears to selectively modulate the level of the alpha 1 subunit <b>messenger</b> <b>RNA,</b> suggesting that GABAA receptor genes are differentially regulated...|$|R
40|$|Levels of <b>messenger</b> <b>RNAs</b> for brain-derived {{neurotrophic}} factor, nerve {{growth factor}} and neurotrophin- 3, and their high-affinity receptors, TrkB and TrkC, were analysed in {{the brains of}} genetically fast and slow kindling rats using in situ hybridization. Basal expression of neurotrophins and Trk <b>messenger</b> <b>RNAs</b> in the hippocampal formation, amygdala, frontoparietal and piriform cortices did not differ between the two strains. At 2 h after the third generalized grade 5 seizure, induced by kindling stimulations in the amygdala, increased expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor <b>messenger</b> <b>RNA</b> was detected in the dentate gyrus granule cell layer, amygdala, frontoparietal and piriform cortices of the fast kindlers. Similar seizure-evoked increases of brain-derived neurotrophic factor <b>messenger</b> <b>RNA</b> levels were also observed in the amygdala and piriform cortex of slow kindlers. However, in these animals, brain-derived neurotrophic factor <b>messenger</b> <b>RNA</b> expression was not significantly altered by the seizures in the dentate gyrus granule cell layer and frontoparietal cortex. Furthermore, the seizure-induced increase of nerve growth factor, TrkB and TrkC <b>messenger</b> <b>RNAs</b> and decrease of neurotrophin- 3 <b>messenger</b> <b>RNA</b> levels in the dentate gyrus granule cell layer was only observed in fast, but not in slow, kindlers. The neurotrophins are believed to regulate synaptic plasticity and efficacy and to facilitate long-term potentiation and kindling epileptogenesis. The present {{data suggest that the}} slow and fast kindling rates in the two strains studied here might partly be due to differences in seizure-evoked neurotrophin and Trk synthesis...|$|R
40|$|The {{immunotoxin}} 192 IgG-saporin induces {{an efficient}} and specific lesion of low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor-bearing cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain. Intraventricular injection of 192 IgG-saporin, which caused a complete loss of cholinergic afferents to the hippocampus and neocortex and a partial denervation of amygdala and piriform cortex, {{was found to}} markedly facilitate {{the initial stages of}} seizure development in hippocampal kindling. In contrast, the progression of kindling process from focal to generalized seizures was not affected. In situ hybridization demonstrated that basal levels of brain-derived neutrotrophic factor <b>messenger</b> <b>RNA</b> in the hippocampal formation and piriform cortex were significantly decreased by the lesion, which also attenuated the seizure-induced increase of brain-derived neurotrophic factor <b>messenger</b> <b>RNA</b> expression in the hippocampus and frontal cortex. In the dentate gyrus, the 192 IgG-saporin lesion selectively reduced the upregulation of <b>messenger</b> <b>RNAs</b> for brain-derived neurotrophic factor exons I and III after a generalized seizure, whereas the increase of exon II <b>messenger</b> <b>RNA</b> was unchanged. The lesion abolished the seizure-evoked increase of nerve growth factor and TrkC <b>messenger</b> <b>RNA</b> levels and decrease of neutrophin- 3 <b>messenger</b> <b>RNA</b> expression in dentate granule cells, while TrkB <b>messenger</b> <b>RNA</b> levels were not affected. We conclude that the basal forebrain cholinergic system (1) suppresses kindling epileptogenesis in the hippocampus, and (2) enhances both basal and seizure-evoked brain-derived neurotrophic factor synthesis in the hippocampal formation and some cortical areas through a specific pattern of activation of promoters within the brain-derived neurotrophic factor gene...|$|R
