40|$|This paper {{provides}} comprehensive {{analyses and}} <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> <b>evidences</b> on determination of liquidity and asset management of selected Nigerian banks. The {{purpose of this}} study is to examine liquidity series of Nigerian banks with a view to indicating any weakness noticed. The study considers liquidity buffer of Nigerian banks and finds out how the policy of the Central Bank as a Lender of Last Result (LOLR) may affect banking in the period of liquidity crises. The paper collects time series data from the annual reports of three major banks judging from their size in term of assets, capital base turnover and branch networks. The work employs multiple regressions using Error Correction Mechanisms (ECM) to test the time series properties of proxies of liquidity series employed and possible co-integration among the series through Johansen co-integration tests. The results are diagnosed with a view to eliminating errors that violate the basic tenets of Ordinary Least Square (OLS). Besides Granger Causality tests are employed to determine the direction of causation between the explained and the explanatory variables. The results show <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> <b>evidences</b> that bank A and B are more liquid than bank C because proxies of liquidity series and Tobi’s q of the banks are significant. _________________________________________________________________________________________...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Prima</b> <b>facie</b> ( [...] , , or from <b>prīmā</b> <b>faciē)</b> is a Latin {{expression}} meaning on {{its first}} encounter or at first sight. The literal translation would be [...] "at first face" [...] or [...] "at first appearance", from the feminine forms of primus ("first") and facies ("face"), both in the ablative case. In modern, colloquial and conversational English, a common translation would be, [...] "on the face of it". The term <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> is used in modern legal English (including both civil law and criminal law) to signify that upon initial examination, sufficient corroborating evidence appears to exist to support a case. In common law jurisdictions, <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> denotes <b>evidence</b> that, unless rebutted, would be sufficient to prove a particular proposition or fact. The term is used similarly in academic philosophy. Most legal proceedings, in most jurisdictions, require a <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> case to exist, following which proceedings may then commence to test it, and create a ruling.|$|R

If a plaintiff's negligence per se is to be contributory negligence, {{it must be a}} cause of the injury. In Martin v.

50|$|Apart from advising, a notary also draws, executes, and retains {{instruments}} {{either by}} statute {{or at the}} parties' request.

[...] The court cited other cases in which a [...] "multiplicity of relevant factors" [...] were considered as rebutting the presumption. In the case before it, the HHUDR market involved sales of from 20 to 40 units a year, so that market share statistics were unreliable and misleading. Further, the customers were highly sophisticated and purchased on the basis of competitive bidding. This too undercut the significance of the government's statistics.|$|R
