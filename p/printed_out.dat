5|$|Sega later {{produced}} gun games which resemble first-person light gun video games, {{but were}} in fact electro-mechanical games that used rear image projection {{in a manner similar}} to a zoetrope to produce moving animations on a screen. An early example of this was Duck Hunt, which Sega released in 1969; it featured animated moving targets on a screen, <b>printed</b> <b>out</b> the player's score on a ticket, and had sound effects that were volume controllable.|$|E
5|$|Another {{influential}} early mainframe {{game was}} Baseball, a sports game {{that was created}} on a PDP-10 minicomputer at Pomona College in 1971 by English major Don Daglow. Baseball was the first baseball video game that allowed players to manage the game as it unfolded, rather than just picking players {{at the beginning of}} a game. The program is documented at the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York. Baseball was continually updated through 1974, and distributed to other PDP-10 installations. The text-based game had each player control the pitcher or the batter; they would enter their intention to, for example, pitch to or walk the batter, or switch hitters. The batting player could direct on-base players to steal, and the batter to hit. The results of the play would be <b>printed</b> <b>out</b> onto paper as a verbose description, like a radio description of the game. Daglow went on to develop more sophisticated baseball games in 1983 with Intellivision World Series Baseball, and 1987 with Earl Weaver Baseball, as well as numerous other games.|$|E
5|$|During {{the concept}} phase {{there were four}} people working on the Hitman Go. Initial prototypes were built on paper using <b>printed</b> <b>out</b> characters. The project was pitched and greenlit for {{production}} in mid 2013. Daniel Lutz served as creative director, and the team size peaked at eleven people throughout {{the remainder of the}} game's development. The studio looked at several different engines for building the game, but opted with Unity early on as it had a low barrier of entry, provided support for the main mobile platforms, and some members of the development team had previous experience creating projects in the game engine. An initial working prototype and a basic level editor were developed in a few days and after two weeks the first version of the game was presented to the remainder of the studio.|$|E
50|$|An {{algebraic}} expression {{can be produced}} from a binary expression tree by recursively producing a parenthesized left expression, then <b>printing</b> <b>out</b> the operator at the root, and finally recursively producing a parenthesized right expression. This general strategy (left, node, right) is known as an in-order traversal.An alternate traversal strategy is to recursively <b>print</b> <b>out</b> the left subtree, the right subtree, and then the operator. This traversal strategy is generally known as post-order traversal.A third strategy is to <b>print</b> <b>out</b> the operator first and then recursively <b>print</b> <b>out</b> {{the left and right}} subtree known as pre-order traversal.|$|R

5|$|In November 1932, it was {{reported}} that new radio equipment was to be installed at Lympne and St Inglevert operating on the 15 centimetre waveband at 2,000MHz, which would be used for the announcement of departures of non-radio aircraft across the Channel. Messages sent by radio were also <b>printed</b> <b>out</b> by a teleprinter, providing a record of the communication. The British Air Ministry and the French Ministère de l'Air co-operated in the arrangements for setting up the system, which was scheduled to come into operation in Spring 1933. It proved its effectiveness on 7 March 1933, when a non-radio de Havilland DH.60 Moth of British Air Transport failed to arrive at Lympne. The aircraft had ditched in the Channel and both occupants were rescued by a steamship bound for Amsterdam, the Netherlands. A new short-wave radio system came into operation on 16 January 1934, using equipment manufactured by Le Matériel Téléphonique, Paris.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, the U.S. Postal Service {{authorised}} {{the first}} tests of a secure system of sending digital franks via the Internet to be <b>printed</b> <b>out</b> on a PC printer, obviating {{the necessity to}} license a dedicated franking machine and allowing companies with smaller mail programs {{to make use of}} the option; this was later expanded to test the use of personalised postage. The service provided by the U.S. Postal Service in 2003 allows the franks to be <b>printed</b> <b>out</b> on special adhesive-backed labels.|$|E

25|$|Prior to {{the summer}} of 2005, the MTA used an older fare {{collection}} system. Day passes purchased on buses were <b>printed</b> <b>out</b> by a separate machine from the bus fareboxes. It was possible to alter these passes {{so that they could}} used on other days and to sell them to other passengers or make duplicate passes and sell them to others for cheaper than the MTA's official fares.

25|$|Many AED {{units have}} an 'event memory' which store the ECG {{of the patient}} along with details {{of the time the}} unit was {{activated}} and the number and strength of any shocks delivered. Some units also have voice recording abilities to monitor the actions taken by the personnel in order to ascertain if these had any impact on the survival outcome. All this recorded data can be either downloaded to a computer or <b>printed</b> <b>out</b> so that the providing organisation or responsible body is able to see the effectiveness of both CPR and defibrillation. Some AED units even provide feedback {{on the quality of the}} compressions provided by the rescuer.|$|E
25|$|Photo CD is {{a system}} {{designed}} by Kodak for digitizing and storing photos on a CD. Launched in 1992, the discs were designed to hold nearly 100 high-quality images, scanned prints and slides using special proprietary encoding. Photo CDs are defined in the Beige Book and conform to the CD-ROM XA and CD-i Bridge specifications as well. They are intended to play on CD-i players, Photo CD players and any computer with the suitable software irrespective of the operating system. The images can also be <b>printed</b> <b>out</b> on photographic paper with a special Kodak machine. This format {{is not to be}} confused with Kodak Picture CD, which is a consumer product in CD-ROM format.|$|E

25|$|If {{a filling}} station allows {{customers}} to pay at the register, {{the data from}} the dispensers may be transmitted via RS232, RS485 or Ethernet to the point of sale, usually inside the filling station's building, and fed into the station's cash register operating system. The cash register system gives a limited control over the fuel dispenser, and is usually limited to allowing the clerks to turn the pumps on and off. A separate system is used to monitor the fuel tank's status and quantities of fuel. With sensors directly in the fuel tank, the data is fed to a terminal in the back room, where it can be downloaded or <b>printed</b> <b>out.</b> Sometimes this method is bypassed, with the fuel tank data transmitted directly into an external database.|$|E
25|$|Manchuria {{was placed}} under martial law again, while its economy {{disintegrated}} under {{the burden of}} the insatiable war machine. Old taxes were increased and new taxes invented. Zhang demanded that more paper money be <b>printed,</b> <b>out</b> of step with silver reserves. A most serious crisis erupted when, in November 1925, Guo Songling revolted and ordered his troops to turn back and march on Shenyang. The Japanese brought in reinforcements to protect their interests in Manchuria, but Zhang managed to put down the revolt in December. Even more seriously, Manchuria's top civil official, Civil Governor Wang Yongjiang, realized that his work of nine years had been in vain. He left Shenyang in February 1926 and handed in his resignation. This time he did not react when Zhang asked him to return. Wang died from kidney failure on 1 November 1927.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} finale was to {{take place}} on the hands of Big Ben with Ratigan eventually falling to his demise. However, layout artist Mike Peraza approached Musker with the idea of restaging the final confrontation so the characters would break through the face of the Big Ben with the grinding clockwork gears providing added menace, in which Musker agreed. Pereza and his team was sent to London for video reference and were granted unprecedented access to the clockworks inside Big Ben. Because the bells would chime at every quarter-hour, the team completed their research in one hour. Back at the Feature Animation building, animators Phil Nibbelink and Dave Gielow spent months designing the interior of Big Ben, with each gear produced as wire-frame graphics on a computer that was <b>printed</b> <b>out</b> and traced onto animation cels onto which the colors and characters were added.|$|E

25|$|The Library Cave {{is equally}} {{important}} {{as a source of}} rare early images and texts produced by woodblock printing, including the famous Diamond Sutra, the earliest printed book to survive. Other printed images were made to be hung, often with text below containing prayers and sometimes a dedication by the pious commissioner; at least two prints were commissioned by Cao Yuanzhong, Imperial Commissioner at Dunhuang in 947. Many of the images have colour added by hand to the printed outline. Several sheets contain repeated impressions of the same block with a Buddha image. Possibly these reflect stock for cutting when sold to pilgrims, but inscriptions in some examples show these were also <b>printed</b> <b>out</b> at different times by an individual as a devotion to acquire merit. It is unclear whether such people owned their own blocks, or visited a monastery to have the images printed.|$|E
