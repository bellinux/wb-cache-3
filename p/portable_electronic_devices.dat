25|$|MDDR is {{an acronym}} that some {{enterprises}} use for Mobile DDR SDRAM, {{a type of}} memory used in some <b>portable</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>devices,</b> like mobile phones, handhelds, and digital audio players. Through techniques including reduced voltage supply and advanced refresh options, Mobile DDR can achieve greater power efficiency.|$|E
25|$|Secure Digital {{includes}} four card families available {{in three different}} sizes. The four families are the original Standard-Capacity (SDSC), the High-Capacity (SDHC), the eXtended-Capacity (SDXC), and the SDIO, which combines input/output functions with data storage. The three form factors are the original size, the mini size, and the micro size. Electrically passive adapters allow a smaller card to fit and function in a device built for a larger card. The SD card's small footprint is an ideal storage medium for smaller, thinner and more <b>portable</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>devices.</b>|$|E
25|$|Three-axis MEMS-based {{gyroscopes}} {{are also}} being used in <b>portable</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>devices</b> such as tablets, smartphones, and smartwatches. This adds to the 3-axis acceleration sensing ability available on previous generations of devices. Together these sensors provide 6 component motion sensing; acceleration for X,Y, and Z movement, and gyroscopes for measuring the extent and rate of rotation in space (roll, pitch and yaw). Some devices (e.g. the iPhone) additionally incorporate a magnetometer to provide absolute angular measurements relative to the Earth's magnetic field. Newer MEMS-based inertial measurement units incorporate up to all nine axes of sensing in a single integrated circuit package, providing inexpensive and widely available motion sensing.|$|E

25|$|Besides the above-described films ((Polypropylene (PP), Polyethylene Terephthalate Polyester PET), Polyphenylene Sulfide (PPS), Polyethylene Naphthalate (PEN), Polycarbonate (PP), Polystyrene (PS) and Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)), {{some other}} plastic {{materials}} {{may be used}} as the dielectric in film capacitors. Thermoplastic polymers such as Polyimide (PI), Polyamide (PA, better known as Nylon or Perlon), Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), Siloxane, Polysulfone (PEx) and Aromatic Polyester (FPE) are described in the technical literature as possible dielectric films for capacitors. The primary reason for considering new film materials for capacitors is the relative low permittivity of commonly used materials. With a higher permittivity, film capacitors could be made even smaller, an advantage in the market for more-compact <b>portable</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>devices.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1997 the lithium polymer battery was {{released}} by Sony and Asahi Kasei. These batteries hold their electrolyte in a solid polymer composite instead of in a liquid solvent, and the electrodes and separators are laminated to each other. The latter difference allows the battery to be encased in a flexible wrapping instead of in a rigid metal casing, which means such batteries can be specifically shaped to fit a particular device. This advantage has favored lithium polymer batteries {{in the design of}} <b>portable</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>devices</b> such as mobile phones and personal digital assistants, and of radio-controlled aircraft, as such batteries allow for more flexible and compact design. They generally have a lower energy density than normal lithium-ion batteries.|$|E
2500|$|Primary (single-use or [...] "disposable") {{batteries}} are used once and discarded; the electrode materials are irreversibly changed during discharge. Common examples are the alkaline battery used for flashlights and {{a multitude of}} <b>portable</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>devices.</b> Secondary (rechargeable) batteries can be discharged and recharged multiple times using an applied electric current; the original composition of the electrodes can be restored by reverse current. Examples include the lead-acid batteries used in vehicles and lithium-ion batteries used for portable electronics such as laptops and smartphones.|$|E

2500|$|The use of {{the term}} ground (or earth) is so common in {{electrical}} and electronics applications that circuits in <b>portable</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>devices</b> such as cell phones and media players as well as circuits in vehicles may be spoken of as having a [...] "ground" [...] connection without any actual connection to the Earth, despite [...] "common" [...] being a more appropriate term for such a connection. This is usually a large conductor attached {{to one side of the}} power supply (such as the [...] "ground plane" [...] on a printed circuit board) which serves as the common return path for current from many different components in the circuit.|$|E
2500|$|One {{important}} classification for batteries is {{by their}} life cycle. [...] "Primary" [...] batteries can produce current {{as soon as}} assembled, but once the active elements are consumed, they cannot be electrically recharged. The development of the lead-acid battery and subsequent [...] "secondary" [...] or [...] "rechargeable" [...] types allowed energy to be restored to the cell, extending the life of permanently assembled cells. The introduction of nickel and lithium based batteries in the latter 20th century made the development of innumerable <b>portable</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>devices</b> feasible, from powerful flashlights to mobile phones. Very large stationary batteries find some applications in grid energy storage, [...] helping to stabilize electric power distribution networks.|$|E
2500|$|The Shreeve {{mechanical}} repeater and {{the vacuum}} tube {{were the only}} amplifying devices, other than specialized power devices such as the magnetic amplifier and amplidyne, for 40 years. [...] Power control circuitry used magnetic amplifiers until {{the latter half of}} the twentieth century when power semiconductor devices became more economical, with higher operating speeds. Shreeve repeaters were used as adjustable amplifiers in telephone subscriber sets for the hearing impaired until the transistor provided smaller and higher quality amplifiers in the 1950s. [...] The replacement of bulky electron tubes with transistors during the 1960s and 1970s created another revolution in electronics, making possible a large class of <b>portable</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>devices,</b> such as the transistor radio developed in 1954.

2500|$|Many {{audience}} members arrive {{early on the}} day of a taping, and often camp out the night before to attend. Most have already received tickets for that day's show, although some hope to get same-day tickets. Audience members are then given the iconic name tags with a temporary identification number, which is also written on the person's ticket. A Social Security Number (or some national I.D. number for non-U.S. {{audience members}}) is also required to be submitted. Audience members are eventually brought through in groups of twelve for brief interviews with the production staff. Contrary to popular belief, contestant names are not chosen at random; rather, the interviews determine possible selections for the nine contestants per taping from among the pool of approximately 325 audience members. Since 1988, the minimum age for audience members has been 18; prior to 1988, teenagers and children as young as 12 were present in the audience. With few exceptions, anyone at least 18 years old who attends a taping of the show has the potential to become a contestant. Those ineligible include current candidates for political office, employees of CBS Corporation or its affiliates, RTL Group or any firm involved in offering prizes for the show. Contestants who have appeared on a different game show within the previous year or either two other game shows or any version of The Price Is Right itself within the past ten years are also ineligible. The show's staff alerts potential contestantsin person, on the show's website and on the tickets themselvesto dress in [...] "street clothes" [...] and not to wear costumes, such as those used to attract attention on Let's Make a Deal, another show that featured contestants selected from the audience. Those who have attended tapings in June 2008 noted that producers disallowed audience members from wearing fake eyeglasses designed to look similar to those worn by Carey, a restriction that has since been relaxed. Instead, contestants will often wear shirts with hand-decorated slogans. Members of the Armed Forces are often in uniform. Cell phones, tape recorders, backpacks, price lists and <b>portable</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>devices</b> are not allowed in the studio. Prospective contestants obtain tickets by contacting a third-party ticketing operator via the show's website, which is promoted on-air during the broadcast. Prior to 2011, ticketing was directly through CBS, originally via mail, with online ticket access added in 2005. The mail practice ended after CBS began outsourcing ticketing to the third-party operator.|$|E
