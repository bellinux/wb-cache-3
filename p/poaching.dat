5|$|<b>Poaching</b> is {{a serious}} problem in the country, {{particularly}} of elephants for the profitable ivory industry and a threat to lives of rangers even in the national parks such as Zakouma. Elephants are often massacred in herds in and around the parks by organized <b>poaching.</b> The problem is worsened {{by the fact that the}} parks are understaffed and that a number of wardens have been murdered by poachers.|$|E

5|$|During the 20th century, {{sea otter}} numbers rebounded in {{about two-thirds of}} their {{historic}} range, a recovery {{considered one of the}} greatest successes in marine conservation. However, the IUCN still lists the sea otter as an endangered species, and describes the significant threats to sea otters as oil pollution, predation by orcas, <b>poaching,</b> and conflicts with fisheries– sea otters can drown if entangled in fishing gear. The hunting of sea otters is no longer legal except for limited harvests by indigenous peoples in the United States. <b>Poaching</b> was a serious concern in the Russian Far East immediately {{after the collapse of the}} Soviet Union in 1991; however, it has declined significantly with stricter law enforcement and better economic conditions.|$|E

5|$|India {{is home to}} the world's largest {{population}} of wild tigers but only 11% of the original Indian tiger habitat remains, and it has become fragmented. From 1973, India's Project Tiger, started by Indira Gandhi, established over 25 tiger reserves in reclaimed land, where human development was forbidden. The project was credited with tripling the number of wild Bengal tigers from some 1,200 in 1973 to over 3,500 in the 1990s, but a 2007 census showed that numbers had dropped back to about 1,400 tigers because of <b>poaching.</b> Following the report, the Indian government pledged $153 million to the initiative, set up measures to combat <b>poaching,</b> promised funds to relocate up to 200,000 villagers in order to reduce human-tiger interactions, and set up eight new tiger reserves. India also reintroduced tigers to the Sariska Tiger Reserve and by 2009 it was claimed that <b>poaching</b> had been effectively countered at Ranthambore National Park. A 2014 census estimated a {{population of}} 2,226, a 30% increase since 2011.|$|E

5|$|Under {{common law}} tradition, civilians could possess {{firearms}} except artillery and insidious weapons (e.g. firearms that had appearance of other objects, etc.). First gun control laws were enacted during early 18th century {{and dealt with}} illegal use of firearms for <b>poaching.</b> At the time, hunting was an exclusive noble privilige with little to no legal option for participation of common folk. Despite tough sentences of 12 years of hard labor or death introduced by a 1727 enactment, <b>poaching</b> with use of firearms remained widespread {{to the point that}} a 1732 Royal Gamekeeping Rules noted that gamekeepers were in constant danger of being shot by poachers.|$|E
5|$|Common elands live on {{the open}} plains of {{southern}} Africa and along {{the foothills of the}} great southern African plateau.

5|$|Large {{parts of}} Zimbabwe were once covered by forests with {{abundant}} wildlife. Deforestation and <b>poaching</b> {{has reduced the}} amount of wildlife. Woodland degradation and deforestation, due to population growth, urban expansion and lack of fuel, are major concerns and have led to erosion and land degradation which diminish the amount of fertile soil. Local farmers have also been criticised by environmentalists for burning off vegetation to heat their tobacco barns.|$|E
