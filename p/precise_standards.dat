40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{precision}} of auditing standards under a negligence liability system for auditors. Auditing standards such as, e. g., GAAS in the US and GoA in Germany provide rules for judging the auditors' due care and are supposed to serve both descriptive and normative purposes. In order to fulfill these functions, it is usually hypothesized that the standards must be made as precise as possible. This paper argues, however, that vague standards need not be detrimental. In fact, it is shown that for each <b>precise</b> <b>standard</b> there exists a vague standard that outperforms the <b>precise</b> <b>standard</b> equilibrium in terms of auditing efforts, quality of the financial statements, costs of using the legal system, and direct as well as total auditing costs. ...|$|R

5000|$|Unlike most {{instruments}} of mechanical precision, surface plates do not derive their precision from more <b>precise</b> <b>standards.</b> Instead they originate precision by {{application of the}} principle of [...] "automatic generation of gages". In this process, three approximately flat surfaces are progressively refined to precise flatness by manual rubbing against each other in pairs with coloring matter in between then hand scraping off the high points. Any errors of flatness are removed by this scraping, since the only stable, mutually conjugate surface shape is a plane. Joseph Whitworth, who had been an apprentice with Maudslay, described this process to the British Association in 1840 in his paper The Mode of Producing a True Plane as he related during his chairman's address in 1856 at the inaugural meeting of the British Institute of Mechanical Engineers in Glasgow. Whitworth, born in 1803, worked as an apprentice for Maudslay from 1825 but had left by the time he started his own business in 1833. His 1840 paper, and this past work for Maudslay, has led to some writers claiming Whitworth as the originator of the surface plate scraping technique, not Maudslay.|$|E
