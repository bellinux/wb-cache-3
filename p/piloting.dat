5|$|Lieutenant-Colonel Otway, {{who wrote}} an {{official}} {{history of the}} British airborne forces during World War II, stated that Operation Varsity highlighted the vulnerability of glider-borne units. While they arrived in complete sub-units {{and were able to}} move off more quickly than airborne troops dropped by parachute, the gliders were easy targets for anti-aircraft fire and short-range small-arms fire once landed; Otway concluded that in any future operations, troops dropped by parachute should secure landing zones prior to the arrival of glider-borne units. Thus, by having the landings conducted during daylight to ensure greater accuracy, the Allied planners incurred a far greater casualty rate, particularly amongst the glider-borne elements. The operation also suffered from poor <b>piloting.</b> Although the <b>piloting</b> was of a better quality than in the Sicilian and Normandy operations, there were still significant failures {{on the part of the}} pilots, especially when it is considered that the drop was conducted in daylight. A significant error occurred when the pilots of the transports carrying 513th Parachute Infantry Regiment dropped much of the regiment several miles from their designated drop zones, with the mis-dropped units actually landing in the British landing zones.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a hybrid pilot-aided channel estimation technique for mitigating {{the effect of}} <b>pilot</b> contamination for the uplink of multi-cell multiuser massive MIMO systems. The proposed hybrid <b>pilot</b> is designed such that it enjoys the complementary advantages between time-multiplexed (TM) <b>pilot</b> and time-superimposed (TS) <b>pilot,</b> and thereby, allows superior solution to the conventional <b>pilot</b> schemes. We mathematically characterize the impact of hybrid <b>pilot</b> on the massive MIMO uplink by deriving a closed-form approximation for the uplink achievable rate. In large-number-of-antennas regime, we obtain the asymptotically optimal solution for hybrid <b>pilot</b> by jointly designing the TM <b>pilot</b> and the TS <b>pilot.</b> It is shown that either TM <b>pilot</b> or TS <b>pilot</b> has the advantages for large frame-size and limited frame-size transmission, respectively, while the hybrid <b>pilot</b> scheme can offer a superior performance to that employing either TM <b>pilot</b> or TS <b>pilot.</b> Numerical results demonstrate {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed design.
