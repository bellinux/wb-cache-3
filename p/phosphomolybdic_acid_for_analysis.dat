Highly stable and magnetically recyclable mesoporous silica spheres (MMS) embedded with FeCo-graphitic carbon shell nanocrystals (FeCo/GC@MSS) were fabricated by a modified Stöber process and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method. The FeCo/GC@MSS were loaded with <b>phosphomolybdic</b> <b>acid</b> (PMA@FeCo/GC@MSS), and their catalytic activity was investigated.
