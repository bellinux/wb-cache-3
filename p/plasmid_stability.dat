40|$|Certain Salmonella enterica serovars {{belonging}} to subspecies I carry low-copy-number virulence plasmids of variable size (50 – 90 kb). All of these plasmids share the spv operon, {{which is important}} for systemic infection. Virulence plasmids are present at low copy numbers. Few copies reduce metabolic burden but suppose a risk of plasmid loss during bacterial division. This drawback is counterbalanced by maintenance modules that ensure <b>plasmid</b> <b>stability,</b> including partition systems and toxin-antitoxin (TA) loci. The low-copy number virulence pSLT plasmid of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium encodes three auxiliary maintenance systems: one partition system (parAB) and two TA systems (ccdABST and vapBC 2 ST). The TA module ccdABST has previously been shown to contribute to pSLT <b>plasmid</b> <b>stability</b> and vapBC 2 ST to bacterial virulence. Here we describe a novel assay to measure <b>plasmid</b> <b>stability</b> based on the selection of plasmid-free cells following elimination of plasmid-containing cells by ParE toxin, a DNA gyrase inhibitor. Using this new maintenance assay we confirmed a crucial role of parAB in pSLT maintenance. We also showed that vapBC 2 ST, in addition to contribute to bacterial virulence, is important for <b>plasmid</b> <b>stability.</b> We have previously shown that ccdABST encodes an inactive CcdBST toxin. Using our new stability assay we monitored the contribution to <b>plasmid</b> <b>stability</b> of a ccdABST variant containing a single mutation (R 99 W) that restores the toxicity of CcdBST. The “activation” of CcdBST (R 99 W) did not increase pSLT stability by ccdABST. In contrast, ccdABST behaves as a canonical type II TA system in terms of transcriptional regulation. Of interest, ccdABST was shown to control {{the expression of a}} polycistronic operon in the pSLT plasmid. Collectively, these results show that the contribution of the CcdBST toxin to pSLT <b>plasmid</b> <b>stability</b> may depend on its role as a co-repressor in coordination with CcdAST antitoxin more than on its toxic activity.

Genes acrA and plsA fall into different cistrons and are arranged in the order proC-acrA-plasA-purE. The genes were shown to interact with each other. Introduction of acrA mutation into a plsA temperature-sensitive mutant mitigated the heat sensitivity. <b>Plasmid</b> (F-gal+) <b>stability</b> in acrA mutants was restored by introduction of the plasA mutation into the acrA cells. When an Hfr plsA donor was conjugated with an acrA recipient, or when reciprocally conjugated, the exogenotes were eliminated at high frequency during subsequent subcultivation in broth.

When an F-gal+ plasmid was introduced into the unstable heterozygotes (acrA+plsA/acrApls 1 +), the plasmids were stably hosted, whereas the acrA+ plasA exogenotes were spontaneously lost at a high frequency. On the other hand, when the unstable heterozygotes carrying F-gal+ were cultured in acriflavine-containing medium, the F-gal+ plasmids were preferentially eliminated but the acrA+plasA exogenotes were not affected.

The site of initiation of leading-strand synthesis for replication of NR 1 is also located in repA 4 near its 3 ' end. Transposon insertions between ori and the right-hand terC repeat resulted in plasmid instability, whereas transposon insertions farther downstream did not. Derivatives that contained a 35 -bp frameshift insertion in the repA 4 ORF were all stable, even when the frameshift was located very near the 5 ' end of the coding region. This finding indicates that repA 4 does not specify a protein product that is essential for <b>plasmid</b> <b>stability.</b> Examination of mutants having a nest of deletions with endpoints in or near repA 4 indicated that the 3 ' end of the repA 4 coding region and the site of leading-strand initiation could be deleted without appreciable effect on <b>plasmid</b> <b>stability.</b> Deletion of the pemI and pemK genes, located farther downstream from repA 4 and reported to affect <b>plasmid</b> <b>stability,</b> also had no detectable effect.

In addition, a change from T to C at position 6 did not perturb wild-type efficiency. To test whether the essential region extends beyond the 11 -base-pair consensus sequence, the effects on <b>plasmid</b> <b>stability</b> of point mutations one base 3 ' to the T-rich strand of the core consensus sequence (position 12) and deletion mutations that altered bases 5 ' to the T-rich strand of the core consensus sequence were examined. An A at position 12 or the removal of three T residues 5 ' to the core consensus sequence severely diminished ARS efficiency, showing that the region required for full ARS efficiency extends beyond the core consensus sequence in both directions...|$|E
40|$|The orf 245 gene {{is located}} {{immediately}} upstream of, and divergently transcribed from, the replication initiation gene, rep, of the Staphylococcus aureus multiresistance plasmid pSK 1, and related genes {{have been found}} in association with a range of evolutionarily distinct replication genes on plasmids from various gram-positive genera. orf 245 has been shown previously to extend the segregational stability of a pSK 1 minireplicon. Here we describe an investigation into the basis of orf 245 -mediated stabilization. orf 245 was not found to influence transcription of pSK 1 rep, indicating that it is not directly involved in plasmid replication. This was confirmed by demonstrating that orf 245 is able to enhance the segregational stability of heterologous theta- and rolling-circle-replicating replicons, suggesting that it encodes a plasmid maintenance function. Evidence inconsistent with postsegregational killing and multimer resolution mechanisms was obtained; however, the intergenic region upstream of orf 245 was found to mediate orf 245 -dependent incompatibility, as would be expected if it encodes a cis-acting centromere-like site. Taken together, these findings implicate active partitioning as the probable basis of the activity of orf 245, which is therefore redesignated par. Since it is unrelated to any gene known {{to play a role in}} plasmid segregation, it seems likely that pSK 1 par potentially represents the prototype of a novel class of active partitioning systems that are distinguished by their capacity to enhance <b>plasmid</b> segregational <b>stability</b> via a single protein-encoding gene...|$|R
40|$|Nanoscale vectors {{comprised}} of cationic polymers that condense DNA to form nanocomplexes are promising options for gene transfer. The rational design of more efficient nonviral gene carriers {{will be possible}} only with better mechanistic understanding of the critical rate-limiting steps, such as nanocomplex unpacking to release DNA and degradation by nucleases. We present a two-step quantum dot fluorescence resonance energy transfer (two-step QD-FRET) approach to simultaneously and non-invasively analyze DNA condensation and <b>stability.</b> <b>Plasmid</b> DNA, double-labeled with QD (525 nm emission) and nucleic acid dyes, were complexed with Cy 5 -labeled cationic gene carriers. The QD donor drives energy transfer stepwise through the intermediate nucleic acid dye to the final acceptor Cy 5. At least three distinct states of DNA condensation and integrity were distinguished in single particle manner and within cells by quantitative ratiometric analysis of energy transfer efficiencies. This novel two-step QD-FRET method allows for more detailed assessment of the onset of DNA release and degradation simultaneously...|$|R
40|$|Seventy {{selected}} {{strains of}} Salmonella typhimurium and S. enteritidis isolated from related poultry flocks in three independent geographical areas {{were characterized by}} phenotypic and genotypic methods to compare {{the usefulness of the}} methods in epidemiological studies. The 56 S. typhimurium isolates were poorly discriminated by their biotypes, resistance patterns, and plasmid profiles. Nine different ribotypes were obtained after DNA digestion by BglII, PvuII, and SmaI. Seven IS 200 types, characterized by six to nine copies of IS 200 on the chromosome, were detected after digestion of genomic DNA by PstI. These studies resulted in the definition of 15 clonal lineages distributed in three clusters. The 14 S. enteritidis strains were not discriminated either by ribotyping or by detection of IS 200 (IS 200 typing), but were separated on the basis of antibiotic resistance and <b>plasmid</b> profiling. The <b>stability</b> of the insertion sequence type was confirmed by inoculation of an S. typhimurium strain to axenic chickens reared for 15 weeks in sterile isolators...|$|R
