25|$|Between 2000/2001, the Smart Price brand {{replaced}} the Asda Farm Stores budget brand {{which had been}} introduced, at first initially, into some underperforming stores back in 1993. They had consisted of products that were offered {{at a lower price}} than the equivalent famous name brand product and Asda's own brand equivalent. The Farm Stores brand originally consisted of a small number of food only products, including fresh pies and quiches, <b>pre-packed</b> cooked meats, dairy products such as <b>pre-packed</b> cheeses, yogurt and cottage cheese and a selection of frozen foods such as frozen chips, burgers, ice cream and a small range of ready meals. The range later expanded to include selected fresh fruit and vegetables, tinned goods and household cleaning products and detergents.|$|E
25|$|In 1978, W. Clark Still {{introduced}} {{a modified version}} of column chromatography called flash column chromatography (flash). The technique is very similar to the traditional column chromatography, except for that the solvent is driven through the column by applying positive pressure. This allowed most separations to be performed in less than 20 minutes, with improved separations compared to the old method. Modern flash chromatography systems are sold as <b>pre-packed</b> plastic cartridges, and the solvent is pumped through the cartridge. Systems may also be linked with detectors and fraction collectors providing automation. The introduction of gradient pumps resulted in quicker separations and less solvent usage.|$|E
25|$|The concept itself {{consisted}} of <b>pre-packed</b> meals or snacks — usually, Spam salads out and sandwiches back — loaded into a small, two-shelf compartment {{in the seat}} back {{in front of each}} passenger. The meal/snack for the outbound journey could be found in the top compartment, the one for the return trip in the lower section. The latter contained a pellet of dry ice placed under the plastic food container. This simple refrigeration technique prevented food for the return trip that would spend several hours inside a small, confined space from going off. For the airline's cabin staff, it eliminated handling trays while airborne and resulted in a reduction of their workload. To prevent outbound passengers from consuming meals intended for return passengers, locks needed to be installed on the lower compartment that could only be opened by cabin staff during the aircraft's turnaround at the destination airport (although these were not always effective at deterring determined passengers).|$|E
25|$|Dispersal {{of assets}} and pre-positioning of {{material}}. The {{hub of the}} North Vietnamese material distribution was Hanoi with its numerous railheads, bridges, major roads and its seaport. Much of Hanoi however, along with other key port areas such as Haiphong, were off-limits to US air attack {{until late in the}} American war. During the bombing campaign over the north, facilities and installations were widely dispersed and concealed. Some 2,000 imported generators provided essential power, and oil and gas were shuttled ashore on small craft from Soviet ships and stored in thousands of small 55-gallon drums throughout the countryside, alongside roads and in rice paddies. A massive number of civilians were also evacuated to the countryside from the urban areas, along with factories and machine shops. Population was also dispersed with massive movement of civilians out of major cities like Hanoi, into the countryside. Prepositioning was essential to PAVN tactics. Every few miles stockpiles of tools and material were positioned, both on the Ho Chi Minh Trail and on key transportation routes within North Vietnam. Ready-reaction labor units were also held in various areas, deploying for action to repair bomb damage. Action units sometimes helped with supply movement, such as floating 55-gallon drums of fuel down waterways – a crude yet sometimes effective method of moving such material in bulk. Soviet ships also aided dispersal by bringing in fuel and other material already <b>pre-packed</b> in drums, offloaded on to barges for quick distribution, with the ships themselves off-limits to US air attack.|$|E
2500|$|Flow {{hydrogenation}} {{has become}} a popular technique at the bench and increasingly the process scale. This technique involves continuously flowing a dilute stream of dissolved reactant over a fixed bed catalyst {{in the presence of}} hydrogen. Using established HPLC technology, this technique allows the application of pressures from atmospheric to [...] Elevated temperatures may also be used. At the bench scale, systems use a range of <b>pre-packed</b> catalysts which eliminates the need for weighing and filtering pyrophoric catalysts.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} 1988, the {{derogation}} {{was extended}} generally {{to the end of}} 1994, and to the end of 1999 for the sale of loose goods. This amendment was transposed into United Kingdom law by the Units of Measurement Regulations 1994. At the same time, regulations were passed prescribing metric quantities by which the remaining pre-packaged retail commodities not yet defined in metric terms could be sold. From the beginning of 1995, <b>pre-packed</b> coffee, coffee mixtures and coffee bags had to be sold in the prescribed quantities of , , [...] , , , , , , , [...] or a multiple of [...] or of and honey, jam and marmalade other than diabetic jam or marmalade, jelly preserves and molasses, syrup and treacle in , , , , , [...] or a multiple of [...]|$|E
