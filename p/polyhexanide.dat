50|$|Half {{of human}} disease {{involving}} Fusarium {{is caused by}} F. solani and it is involved in most cases of systemic fusariosis and corneal infections. F. solani has been implicated in the following diseases: disseminated disease, osteomyelitis, skin infection, fungemia, and endophthalmitis. In immunocompromised patients, F. solani {{is one of the}} most common agents in disseminated and cutaneous infections. Fungal keratitis in the southern USA is most commonly caused by F. solani, as well as F. oxysporum. Cases of fungal keratitis occur most frequently during harvest season as a result of corneal trauma from dust or plant material. Fungal spores come into contact with the damaged cornea and grow. Without treatment, the hyphae can grow into the cornea and into the anterior chamber of the eye. F. solani is also a major cause of fungal keratitis in HIV positive patients in Africa. F. solani was implicated in cases of fungal keratitis involving the Bausch and Lomb ReNu contact lens solution. Some strains of F. solani can produce a biofilm on soft contact lenses. However, when lenses are cleaned correctly with solution, these biofilms are prevented. Prevention also includes leaving lenses in <b>polyhexanide</b> biguanide solution overnight to inhibit F. solani. Other risk factors of contact lens-related Fusarium keratitis include use of daily-wear lenses beyond the recommended timeline and overnight wear.|$|E

The absence of reported adverse reactions and bacterial resistance to <b>polyhexanide</b> makes it an excellent choice as topical antiseptic. In the present study we evaluated the in vitro and in vivo capacity to generate strains with reduced <b>polyhexanide</b> susceptibility and cross-resistance with chlorhexidine and/or antibiotics currently used in clinic. Here we report the in vitro emergence of reduced-susceptibility to <b>polyhexanide</b> by prolonged-stepwise exposure to low concentrations in broth culture. Reduced susceptibility to <b>polyhexanide</b> was associated with genomic changes in the mprF and purR genes, and with concomitant decreased susceptibility to daptomycin and other cell-wall active antibiotics. However, the in vitro emergence of reduced-susceptibility to <b>polyhexanide</b> did not result in cross-resistance to chlorhexidine antiseptic. During in vivo <b>polyhexanide</b> clinical decolonization treatment, neither <b>polyhexanide</b> reduced-susceptibility nor chlorhexidine cross-resistance were observed. Together, these observations suggest that <b>polyhexanide</b> could be used safely for decolonisation of carriers of chlorhexidine-resistant S. aureus strains but highlight the need for careful use of <b>polyhexanide</b> at low antiseptic concentrations...|$|E

40|$|The use {{of local}} {{antiseptics}} {{is a common}} method in septic joint surgery. We tested <b>polyhexanide</b> and hydrogen peroxide, {{two of the most}} frequently used antiseptics with high efficacy and low toxicity. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the effects of both antiseptics on the extracellular cartilaginous matrix synthesis of human chondrocytes. Chondrocytes were isolated from donated human knee joints, embedded in alginate beads, and incubated for 10 and 30 minutes with <b>polyhexanide</b> (0. 04 %), hydrogen peroxide (3 %), or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for control. Cartilaginous matrix production was quantified through light microscopic analysis of Alcian blue staining. Cell number and morphology were detected by histological analysis. Chondrocytes showed a decreased intensity of blue colouring after antiseptic treatment versus PBS. In contrast to that, neither the cell number per view field nor the cell morphology differed between the groups. <b>Polyhexanide</b> has more toxic potential than hydrogen peroxide. Based on the fact that the cell number and morphology was not altered by the substances at the examined concentrations, the lower intensity of Alcian blue staining of treated chondrocytes indicates a decreased cartilage-specific matrix synthesis by <b>polyhexanide</b> more than by hydrogen peroxide and control...|$|E

The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate release kinetics of amikacin, teicoplanin or <b>polyhexanide</b> from a PRF-layer. PRF mixed with teicoplanin, amikacin or <b>polyhexanide</b> was sprayed on a silicon gauze patch and put on a colombia agar with bacteria with known minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and incubated for 24 hours and afterwards transferred to another agar with the same bacterial strain. Inhibition zones were measured every 24 hours. This was repeated on 7 consecutive days. Antibiotic concentrations were calculated by interpolation. More than 1000 mg/L teicoplanin were released within the first 24 hours and 28. 22 mg/L after 168 hours. Amikacin release was above 10, 000 mg/L within the first 24 hours and still 120. 8 mg/L after 120 hours. A release of <b>polyhexanide</b> could be verified for the first 24 hours only. Consequently teicoplanin and amikacin released from PRF showed antimicrobial in-vitro effects for almost a week, whereas an antimicrobial effect of <b>polyhexanide</b> could only be verified for the first 24 hours.

40|$|Background: With {{increasing}} bacterial {{antibiotic resistance}} {{and an increased}} infection risk due to more complicated surgical procedures and patient populations, prevention of surgical infection is of paramount importance. Intraoperative irrigation with an antiseptic solution could provide {{an effective way to}} reduce postoperative infection rates. Although numerous studies have been conducted on the bactericidal or cytotoxic characteristics of antiseptics, the combination of these characteristics for intraoperative application has not been addressed. Methods: Bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis) and human cells were exposed to <b>polyhexanide,</b> hydrogen peroxide, octenidine dihydrochloride, povidone-iodine, and chlorhexidine digluconate at various dilutions for two minutes. Bactericidal properties were calculated by means of the quantitative suspension method. The cytotoxic effect on human fibroblasts and mesenchymal stromal cells was determined by a WST- 1 metabolic activity assay. Results: All of the antiseptics except for <b>polyhexanide</b> were bactericidal and cytotoxic at the commercially available concentrations. When diluted, only povidone-iodine was bactericidal at a concentration at which some cell viability remained. The other antiseptics tested showed no cellular survival at the minimal bactericidal concentration. Conclusions: Povidone-iodine diluted to a concentration of 1. 3 g/L could be the optimal antiseptic for intraoperative irrigation. This should be established by future clinical studies. ...|$|E

An interim stand remained unfilled as a control group. A total of 323 stainless steel plates and 259 Hedstroem files of different ISO sizes were investigated as specimens in this study. After developing the methodology, the stainless steel plates were replaced by Hedstroem files. Reactivated heparinized human blood was used as soiling solution. Trying to get this soiling solution on small ISO sized Hedstroem files (15 - 80) using Eppendorf pipettes, insulin injections or an immersion bath failed. Only by the use of Hedstroem files larger ISO sizes (120 - 140), the soiling solution could successfully be applied by using Eppendorf pipettes. The instruments were either stung different times by the foam disc (1, 3 and 5 times) of the interim stand or they remained for different times (30 s, 60 s and 300 s) in the filled interim stand. Depending on the filling of the interim stand (exeption were isopropanol alcohol and the unfilled interim stand), lower residual protein contaminations could be demonstrated with the modified OPA method the more often the Hedstrom files were stung by the foam disc or the longer the files remained in the filled interim stand. Alcohol may not be used for filling an interim stand prior to its fixing property, whereas the unfilled interim stand should not be used due to its lack of cleaning function. Since chlorhexidine gluconate and sodium hypochorite have a fixing property, they should also not be used.

40|$|All {{authors have}} equally {{contributed to the}} article. Mupirocin 2 % {{ointment}} is used either alone or with skin antiseptics {{as part of a}} comprehensive MRSA decolon-ization strategy. Increased mupirocin use predisposes to mupirocin resistance, which is significantly associated with persistent MRSA carriage. Mupirocin resistance as high as 81 % has been reported. There is a strong associ-ation between previous mupirocin exposure and both low-level and high-level mupirocin resistance. High-level mupirocin resistance (mupA carriage) is also linked to MDR. Among MRSA isolates, the presence of the qacA and/ or qacB gene, encoding resistance to chlorhexidine, ranges from 65 % to 91 %, which, along with mupirocin resist-ance, is associated with failed decolonization. This is of significant concern for patient care and infection preven-tion and control strategies as both these agents are used concurrently for decolonization. Increasing bacterial resistance necessitates the discovery or development of new antimicrobial therapies.

This paper presents an overview of different diagnostic test to detect a periprosthetic shoulder infection. This includes nonspecific diagnostic tests and specific tests (with identifying the responsible microorganism). The aspiration can combine different specific and nonspecific tests. In dry aspiration and suspected joint infection, we recommend a biopsy. Several therapeutic options exist for the treatment of PJI of shoulder arthroplasties. In acute infections, the options include leaving the implant in place with open debridement, septic irrigation with antibacterial fluids like octenidine or <b>polyhexanide</b> solution, and exchange of all removable components. In late infections (more than four weeks after implantation) the therapeutic options are a permanent spacer, single-stage revision, and two-stage revision with a temporary spacer. The functional results are best after single-stage revisions with a success rate similar to two-stage revisions. For single-stage revisions, the microorganism should be known preoperatively so that specific antibiotics can be mixed into the cement for implantation of the new prosthesis and specific systemic antibiotic therapy can be applied to support the surgery...|$|E
40|$|Cutaneous {{leishmaniasis}} (CL) is {{a neglected}} tropical disease caused by protozoan parasites {{of the genus}} Leishmania. CL causes enormous suffering in many countries worldwide. There is no licensed vaccine against CL, and the chemotherapy options show limited efficacy and high toxicity. Localization of the parasites inside host cells is a barrier to most standard chemo- and immune-based interventions. Hence, novel drugs, which are safe, effective and readily accessible to third-world countries and/or drug delivery technologies for effective CL treatments are desperately needed. Here we evaluated the antileishmanial properties and delivery potential of polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB; <b>polyhexanide),</b> a widely used antimicrobial and wound antiseptic, in the Leishmania model. PHMB showed an inherent antileishmanial activity at submicromolar concentrations.

PHMB's DNA binding and host cell entry properties were further exploited to improve the delivery and immunomodulatory activities of unmethylated cytosine-phosphate-guanine oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG ODN). PHMB spontaneously bound CpG ODN, forming stable nanopolyplexes that enhanced uptake of CpG ODN, potentiated antimicrobial killing and reduced host cell toxicity of PHMB.

Effects of exposure time of 10 s to 10 min of MPS containing polyquaternium- 1 (MPS-A), polyaminopropyl biguanide (MPS-B), and <b>polyhexanide</b> (MPS-C), on porcine corneal epithelial cells were determined. Cell viability and membrane integrity were assessed by Annexin V-FITC/ 7 -AAD staining and FCM. In further trials, whole corneas were immersed in MPS and control (buffered saline), and corneal fluorescein staining assessed before FCM analysis. RESULTS. Significantly higher percentages of 7 -AAD-stained cells (early necrosis) were observed at all exposure times for MPS-A than for other solutions and control (p < 0. 05). Exposure time in MPS-A and 7 -AAD-stained cell proportions showed significant correlation (r = 0. 9957; p < 0. 0001). Significantly more cells dual-stained with Annexin V-FITC/ 7 -AAD (late necrosis) after 5 min MPS-A exposure (11. 8 ± 1. 1 %), compared with 1. 2 ± 0. 9 % (MPS-B), 0. 9 ± 0. 5 % (MPS-C), and 1. 8 ± 0. 2 % (control). However, only 10 min exposure resulted in significant increases in fluorescein grades (p < 0. 001), with median grade 0. 75 for MPS-A, and 0. 50 for the other MPS. CONCLUSIONS. MPS exposure, especially MPS-A, affected the viability and integrity of porcine corneal epithelial cells. Furthermore, our results confirmed that fluorescein staining correlates poorly with cytotoxicity. As fluorescein staining lacks sensitivity to determine cytotoxic effects of ophthalmic solutions, more objective and sensitive assessment methods such as differential staining and FCM should be developed.

40|$|Purpose: The {{aim was to}} {{determine}} the cytotoxic effects of three multipurpose solutions (MPS) on human corneal epithelial cells (HCEC) and to assess the metabolic rates of recovering cells at different levels of cell membrane damage. Method: The effects of one to 15 minutes exposure to multipurpose solutions containing polyquaternium- 1 (MPS-A), polyaminopropyl biguanide (MPS-B) and <b>polyhexanide</b> (MPS-C) on HCEC were determined. Recovery rates at different levels of cell membrane damage were assessed after re-culture for two hours at 37 °C. Cell viability and membrane integrity were assessed using Annexin V-FITC/ 7 -AAD staining and flow cytometry. Effects of concentrations of 10 to 40 per cent multipurpose solutions on the metabolic rate of recovering HCEC were assessed using a Vybrant MTT cell proliferation assay kit. Results: The highest percentage of late necrotic cells resulted after exposure to MPS-A compared with other solutions and the control (p < 0. 001). The percentages of early necrotic cells after 10 and 15 minutes of soaking in MPS-B were significantly higher than the control and other multipurpose solutions (p < 0. 001). Although MPS-C exposure also resulted in statistically significant higher percentages of early necrotic cells than the control (p < 0. 005), these differences were small. No recovery was noted when HCEC treated with multipurpose solutions were re-cultured, with numbers of dead cells in MPS-B-treated cultures increasing fourfold. The MTT assay showed significant dose-response decreases of 500 nm absorbance for all MPS-treated cells. In 40 per cent MPS-A-treated HCEC, lack of activity indicated the cells were non-viable. Conclusions: Multipurpose solutions induced varying levels of irreversible tissue sensitivity reactions, with MPS-A showing the greatest effects. The solutions damaged cell integrity and reduced metabolic rates suggesting delayed healing ability. The formulations of multipurpose solutions need to balance antimicrobial effectiveness with low cytotoxicity, which might not be currently possible to achieve. In light of our results, we suggest that contact lens wearers should be advised to rinse the soaked lenses with saline before lens insertion.

40|$|For the {{majority}} of individuals with spina bifida (SB) is the intermittent bladder catheterization (IC) required. Identifying the factors involved in IC, especially selfcatheterization is fundamental {{in the development of}} effective training programs and public policies consistent with patient reality. This study sought to contribute to this end, describing and comparing the technical, bio-psycho-social and familial factors related to the use of IC. The study included 100 Brazilian individuals and 100 German individuals, of which 108 were female and 92 were male, with an age range of 0 to 55 years and a mean age of 14 years. Data were collected using questionnaires, printed (Brazil) and online (Germany), and analyzed using statistical tests, i. e. multivariate logistical regression and analysis of variance. Predictive factors for self-catheterization were defined, such as having six years of schooling or more, not having hydrocephalus, having a lower level of SB (sacral and lumbar), and differences related to country. The study also demonstrated that the non-application of IC was directly influenced by temporary interruptions of the procedure, the daily frequency of IC and the existence of technical difficulties. Also, {{it is important to note}} that continence, even partial, was achieved by 61. 5 % of the participants and that self-catheterization was responsible for increasing the likelihood of continence up to 3 times. The benefits of IC were statistically proven, such as reducing the number of UTIs (urinary tract infections), which were on average higher in Germans than in Brazilians. Interestingly, there was no difference in the number of UTIs among the Germans who performed disinfection (octenidine, <b>polyhexanide),</b> those who cleaned with soap and water and those who did not perform any cleaning before the introduction of the urethral catheter. The preparation of the transition to adulthood starts in childhood also for individuals with SB. Self-catheterization is part of the process of autonomy in self-care and social participation, and therefore deserves to be studied. Cooperative studies between different countries and cultures contribute to understanding the development and rehabilitation of people with SB...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Device-associated infections due to biofilm-producing methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) {{have been}} {{recently}} {{associated with the}} failure of antibiotic treatment and decolonization measures. The goal of our study was to evaluate {{the extent to which}} the formation of biofilms influenced the efficacy of topical decolonization agents or disinfectants such as mupirocin (MUP), octenidine (OCT), chlorhexidine (CHG), <b>polyhexanide</b> (POL), and chloroxylenol (CLO). Methods Bacterial killing in biofilms by the disinfectants and MUP was determined as the reduction [%] in metabolic activity determined by a biofilm viability assay that uses kinetic analysis of metabolic activity. The test substances were diluted in water with standardized hardness (WSH) at 25  °C at the standard concentration as well as half the standard concentration to demonstrate the dilution effects in a practical setting. The tested concentrations were: CHG 1 %, 2 %; OCT 0. 1 %, 0. 05 %; PH 0. 04 %, 0. 02 %; and CLO 0. 12 %, 0. 24 %. A test organism suspension, 1  mL containing ~ 1 [*]×[*] 109 bacterial cells/mL, and 1  mL of sterile WSH were mixed and incubated for six different exposure times (15  s, 1, 3, 5, 10 and 20  min) after the test substance was added. Additionally, the bactericidal effects of all substances were tested on planktonic bacteria and measured as the log 10 reduction. Results The disinfectants OCT and CHG showed good efficacy in inhibiting MRSA in biofilms with reduction rates of 94 [*]±[*] 1 % and 91 [*]±[*] 1 %, respectively. POL, on the other hand, had a maximum efficacy of only 81 [*]±[*] 7 %. Compared to the tested disinfectants, MUP showed a significantly lower efficacy with < 20 % inhibition (p[*]<[*]. 05). Bactericidal effects were the greatest for CHG (log 10 reduction of 9. 0), followed by OCT (7. 7), POL (5. 1), and CLO (6. 8). MUP, however, showed a very low bactericidal effect of only 2. 1. Even when the exposure time was increased to 24  h, 2 % MUP did not show sufficient bactericidal effect. Conclusions Our data provide evidence that OCT and CHG are effective components for disinfection of MRSA-biofilms. On the other hand, exposure to MUP at the standard concentrations in topical preparations did not effectively inhibit MRSA-biofilms and also did not show adequate bactericidal effects. Combining an MUP-based decolonization regimen with a disinfectant such as OCT or CHG could decrease decolonization failure...|$|E
40|$|Background: Pressure ulcers, {{also known}} as bedsores, decubitus ulcers and {{pressure}} injuries, are localised areas of injury to the skin or the underlying tissue, or both. A range of treatments with antimicrobial properties, including impregnated dressings, are widely used {{in the treatment of}} pressure ulcers. A clear and current overview is required to facilitate decision making regarding use of antiseptic or antibiotic therapies in the treatment of pressure ulcers. This review is one of a suite of Cochrane reviews investigating the use of antiseptics and antibiotics in different types of wounds. It also forms part of a suite of reviews investigating the use of different types of dressings and topical treatments in the treatment of pressure ulcers. Objectives: To assess the effects of systemic and topical antibiotics, and topical antiseptics on the healing of infected and uninfected pressure ulcers being treated in any clinical setting. Search methods: In October 2015 we searched: the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations), Ovid EMBASE, and EBSCOCINAHL Plus. We also searched three clinical trials registries and the references of included studies and relevant systematic reviews. There were no restrictions based on language or date of publication or study setting. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials which enrolled adults with pressure ulcers of stage II or above were included in the review. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently performed study selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction. Main results: We included 12 trials (576 participants); 11 had two arms and one had three arms. All assessed topical agents, none looked at systemic antibiotics. The included trials assessed the following antimicrobial agents: povidone iodine, cadexomer iodine, gentian violet, lysozyme, silver dressings, honey, pine resin, <b>polyhexanide,</b> silver sulfadiazine, and nitrofurazone with ethoxy-diaminoacridine. Comparators included a range of other dressings and ointments without antimicrobial properties and alternative antimicrobials. Each comparison had only one trial, participant numbers were low and follow-up times short. The evidence varied from moderate to very low quality. Six trials reported the primary outcome of wound healing. All except one compared an antiseptic with a non-antimicrobial comparator. There was some moderate and low quality evidence that fewer ulcers may heal in the short term when treated with povidone iodine compared with non-antimicrobial alternatives (protease-modulating dressings (risk ratio (RR) 0. 78, 95...|$|E
40|$|Peri-implantitis is an {{inflammatory}} process, which is initiated by a biofilm-induced pathway causing a {{reversible inflammatory reaction}} in the soft tissues surrounding the implant; however, it may progress into irreversible damage in the surrounding alveolar bone and result in loss of attachment. Modelling any kind of oral biofilm is challenging as up to 700 species have been identified on various surfaces within the mouth. Thus, also data on bacterial colonization and biofilm formation on dental implant surfaces is limited and mostly based on identification of species. However, knowledge about this process, in particular in its early stages, {{is essential for the}} development of strategies to prevent and control microbial adherence and biofilm formation. The aims of this study were (i) to develop and validate a flow chamber model to assess peri-implantitis related multispecies biofilm formation; (ii) to test antimicrobial susceptibility of this biofilm; (iii) to evaluate the reliability of commonly used methods and novel isothermal microcalorimetry (IMC) analyses for vitality testing of adherent microorganisms in vitro. An in vitro flow chamber model was developed to study single- and multispecies adhesion to protein-coated surface in reduced nutrient conditions that mimic the clinical situation of peri-implant disease. Adherent single-species model with S. sanguinis was used for antimicrobial susceptibility testing (Original study 1 in Chapter 4) to answer two questions: firstly, how efficient is disinfectant treatment and secondly, to identify discrepancies between the results revealed by different vitality detection methods (commonly applied: staining by Live/dead Baclight kit, conventional culturing; and a novel approach by IMC). Chlorhexidine has been considered for many years the standard in oral infection control, however, the three other disinfectants (povidone-iodine, octenidine dihydrochloride, <b>polyhexanide)</b> showed comparable efficacy against the adherent microorganism. The interpretation of the results of staining and traditional culturing is difficult as major discrepancies were present. The disagreement between the results of the methods can be attributed to different aspects: (i) staining is based on the destruction or integrity of the cell wall; (ii) conventional culturing requires bacteria to be re-suspended prior to cultivation and subsequent quantification of colony-forming units. However, several factors – such as physical damage to the cells by re-suspension or lack of growth due to suboptimal culture conditions – may cause false negative results; (iii) the population of cells that are viable but not cultivable (VBNC), but are still present by staining and microscopy. The IMC is a very sensitive method, which detects heat-flow from all metabolic processes in any living microorganism. The principle of the method is that all living systems produce heat and heat release can be measured calorimetrically without any interference with the processes. In other words, IMC measures heat production or consumption, which is proportional to the rate at which any given chemical, physical or biological process is taking place (i. e., metabolic heat from bacterial growth). Our results on adherent disinfectant-treated S. sanguinis indicate that IMC is a useful tool to avoid the problem with VBNC cells and provides a novel approach in oral microbiology that detects reliably all the cells that are able to resuscitate after disinfectant treatment and thereby may lead to the expression of virulence factors in the colonized sites. In order to study antimicrobial efficacy on a more complex system, a 72 -hour biofilm model including S. sanguinis, F. nucelatum and P. gingivalis was created (Original study 2 in Chapter 5). After 72 h, the three species were always detected with similar proportions throughout experiments by microscopic methods. Even, when such stability in the proportions and structure was found, the metabolic activity of biofilms in IMC revealed high heterogeneity. Thus, this heterogeneity suggests that bacteria appear to have intra-species variance affecting their behaviour in biofilms, which is dependent on different factors that are hitherto not well understood. IMC analysis of the behaviour of the three-species biofilm provided a novel opportunity to observe how an intact biofilm acts as an entity when exposed to antibiotics (Original study 3 in Chapter 6). The clinical efficacy of adjuvant antibiotic therapy in the periimplantitis treatment is unclear; in order to gain better understanding the most frequently used antibiotics: amoxicillin, metronidazole and their combination were tested. Additionally, in order to obtain comparable data to the previously published information (Chapter 4), the vitality of adherent single-species of S. sanguinis and P. gingivalis after antibiotic treatment was assessed by vitality staining, conventional culturing and IMC. The results of staining and culturing correlated poorly. This can be due to reasons mentioned earlier, such as limitations of the methods and VBNC cells, but can also be due to the bacteriostatic effects of antibiotics that cannot be reliably detected by staining. Although amoxicillin and metronidazole are considered bactericidal, IMC results suggest that when applied alone, the antibiotics seem to work primarily through bacteriostatic effects; when combined, the efficacy is increased by their synergistic bactericidal action. Furthermore, this indicates that it might not be possible to strictly divide the effects of antibiotics into bacteriostatic and bactericidal, as the results here imply that the effect seems to be dependent on their concentration and combination plus the nature of targeted cells. In conclusion, this study emphasises the need to critically evaluate the results of live/dead staining and conventional culturing as many aspects can affect the outcome of these methods leading to miscalculations on the proportion of cells that are able to resuscitate and express virulence factors on treated sites. Thus, as a novel alternative in oral biofilm research IMC gives new insights helping to monitor the efficacy and dynamics of biofilms and their antimicrobial susceptibility in vitro...|$|E
