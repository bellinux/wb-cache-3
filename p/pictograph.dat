5|$|Within the BWCAW are {{hundreds}} of prehistoric pictographs and petroglyphs on rock ledges and cliffs. The BWCAW {{is part of the}} historic homeland of the Ojibwe people, who traveled the waterways in canoes made of birch bark. Prior to Ojibwe settlement, the area was sparsely populated by the Sioux, who migrated westward following the arrival of the Ojibwe. It is thought that the Hegman Lake <b>Pictograph</b> located on a large overlooking rock wall on North Hegman Lake were most likely created by the Ojibwe. The <b>pictograph</b> appears to represent Ojibwe meridian constellations visible in winter during the early evening, knowledge of which may have been useful for navigating in the deep woods during the winter hunting season. The Grand Portage Indian Reservation, just east of the BWCAW at the community of Grand Portage, is home to a number of Ojibwe to this day.|$|E
5|$|Ethnographies also caution against over-interpretation of sites. At {{a site in}} Chaco Canyon can {{be found}} a <b>pictograph</b> with a star, {{crescent}} and hand. It has been argued by some astronomers {{that this is a}} record of the 1054 Supernova. However recent reexaminations of related 'supernova petroglyphs' raises questions about such sites in general and anthropological evidence suggests other inrepretations. The Zuni people, who claim a strong ancestral affiliation with Chaco, marked their sun-watching station with a crescent, star, hand and sundisc, similar to those found at the Chaco site.|$|E

These excavations have indicated that the area has been occupied since at least 2600 BCE until after 1800 CE.|$|E

500|$|In {{contrast}} to the popular conception of Chinese as a primarily pictographic or ideographic language, {{the vast majority of}} Chinese characters (about 95 percent of the characters in the Shuowen Jiezi) are constructed as either logical aggregates or, more often, phonetic complexes. In fact, some phonetic complexes were originally simple pictographs that were later augmented by the addition of a semantic root. [...] An example is 炷 zhù [...] "candle" [...] (now archaic, meaning [...] "lampwick"), which was originally a <b>pictograph</b> 主, a character that is now pronounced zhǔ and means [...] "host". [...] The character 火 huǒ [...] "fire" [...] was added to indicate that the meaning is fire-related.|$|E

500|$|Pound {{could not}} {{understand}} Chinese himself, yet some critics see his translations of Chinese poetry as among the best (others complain of their mistakes). Cathay {{was the first of}} many translations Pound would make from the Chinese. Pound often followed the translations made by Herbert Giles in his History of Chinese Literature [...] and used Fenollosa's work {{as a starting point for}} what he called the ideogrammic method, which proceeded on Fenellosa's entirely mistaken but fruitful idea that each character represented an image or <b>pictograph,</b> based on sight rather than sound. Robert Graves recalled [...] "I once asked Arthur Waley how much Chinese Pound knew; Waley shook his head despondently." [...] Steven Yao, scholar of American and Asian literature, sees Cathay as a [...] "major feat"; a work where Pound shows that translation is possible without a thorough knowledge of the source language. Yao does not view Pound's lack of Chinese as an obstacle, and states that the poet's trawl through centuries of scholarly interpretations resulted in a genuine understanding of the original poem.|$|E
2500|$|The Ancestral Puebloans {{also created}} many petroglyphs and pictographs. The <b>pictograph</b> style {{with which they}} are {{associated}} is the called the Barrier Canyon Style.

50|$|Early written symbols {{were based}} on <b>pictographs</b> (pictures which {{resemble}} what they signify) and ideograms (symbols which represent ideas). Ancient Sumerian, Egyptian, and Chinese civilizations began to adapt such symbols to represent concepts, developing them into logographic writing systems. <b>Pictographs</b> are still in use as the main medium of written communication in some non-literate cultures in Africa, the Americas, and Oceania. <b>Pictographs</b> are often used as simple, pictorial, representational symbols by most contemporary cultures.|$|R
2500|$|A {{wide range}} of {{cultural}} sites occur in the Smith River canyon as well. [...] All of these are Native American in origin. A number of prehistoric campsites, many of which contain tipi rings, exist in the canyon and its adjacent lands. Along the river are many <b>pictograph</b> (or [...] "rock art") sites, which include tally-marks, animal and human figures, and geometric and abstract designs. These pictographs are generally either charcoal or iron oxide mixed with a binder such as berry juice, blood, fat, plant juice, or water. One survey, completed in 1994, logged 68 separate <b>pictograph</b> sites in the canyon, {{some of which were}} dated to 1,200 to 1,400 years old. Some of these sites are considered sacred to Native Americans, and most are located on private land. By law, cultural sites should not be touched, altered, removed, or vandalized.|$|E

40|$|Using {{unfamiliar}} and meaningless <b>pictographs</b> that {{varied in}} {{their degree of}} similarity to Chinese characters, the current study tested whether the early electrophysiological response was modulated by character likeness. We measured P 100 and N 170 while 20 native Chinese speakers were viewing Chinese characters, drawings of objects, and <b>pictographs.</b> Comparisons across the three categories of stimuli showed that <b>pictographs</b> elicited a smaller N 170 amplitude than did Chinese characters and a stronger N 170 amplitude than did objects, but {{did not differ in}} the P 100 amplitude from the other two categories. Within the cat egory of <b>pictographs,</b> stimuli with a higher degree of character likeness elicited larger N 170 amplitudes and shorter N 170 peak latencies, and this effect was again not observed in P 100. These results suggest that N 170 is sensitive to visual stimuli's character likeness even though they are unfamiliar <b>pictographs</b> with no meanings or sounds.

2500|$|As an example, a verb meaning [...] "to wash oneself" [...] is {{pronounced}} mù. This happens {{to sound the}} same as the word mù [...] "tree", which was written with the simple <b>pictograph</b> 木. The verb mù could simply have been written 木, like [...] "tree", but to disambiguate, it was combined with the character for [...] "water", giving some idea of the meaning. The resulting character eventually came to be written 沐 mù [...] "to wash one's hair".

2500|$|The name [...] "Cuernavaca" [...] {{is derived}} from the Nahuatl phrase [...] "Cuauhnāhuac" [...] and means [...] "surrounded by or close to trees".
