50|$|In 1890, {{while the}} city's streetcars {{switched}} to electric and mechanical power, the Metropolitan experimented with batteries but found them unsatisfactory. On August 2, 1894, Congress ordered the Metropolitan {{to switch to}} underground electrical power. It complied, installing the underground sliding shoe on the north-south line in January 1895. It was the first successful installation of such a system in the Western Hemisphere (having previously been installed in Budapest, Hungary). Though mostly a success, the underground <b>power</b> <b>conduits</b> had drawbacks. In the winter, the plow would get jammed by snow and ice and in the summer the conduits swelled shut.|$|R

50|$|The current Lloyd's {{building}} (address 1 Lime Street) {{was designed}} by the architect company Richard Rogers and Partners (now Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners) and built between 1978 and 1986. Bovis was the management contractor. Like the Pompidou Centre in Paris (designed by Renzo Piano and Rogers), the building was innovative in having its services such as staircases, lifts, ductwork, electrical <b>power</b> <b>conduits</b> and water pipes on the outside, leaving an uncluttered space inside. The 12 glass lifts were the first of their kind in the United Kingdom. Like the Pompidou Centre, the building was highly influenced {{by the work of}} Archigram in the 1950s and 1960s.|$|R

50|$|At that moment, another {{class is}} in {{progress}} in a cargo bay when a <b>power</b> <b>conduit</b> blows and the room begins to fill with noxious gas. One of the trainees is unconscious but Tuvok orders the rest to leave him behind and save themselves, stating {{that this is the}} most tactically sound move. The trainees are angered at his apparent disregard for their friend's life, and initially refuse, but Tuvok forces them out. He then contradicts his own order, going back into the poisonous gas to save the injured crewman, and in the process, succumbs to the gas and passes out. Dalby and the other trainees work together to rescue Tuvok and their friend. After the incident is over, Dalby indicates to Tuvok that if he is willing to bend Starfleet protocol to save one of them, perhaps they can bend to accept the Starfleet rules after all.|$|E

50|$|Starglider was {{packaged}} with a sci-fi novella by James Follett, {{describing the}} game's background story, {{in which the}} Egrons effortlessly blitz Novenia despite the planet possessing a previously impenetrable network of utterly deadly defense satellites. The Egrons defeat the system by disguising their battleships as a flock of intergalactic migratory birds, the Stargliders (of the title). The defense satellites had been programmed not to fire on these birds (which migrated between planets regularly) and hence did not recognise the Egron battleships as enemies, allowing the Egrons to reach the surface unopposed. You pilot the only existing example of a prototype fighter craft, initially armed only with lasers, as the TV-guided missiles require {{an enormous amount of}} energy to launch and control, which can only be gained by induction as your craft skims over areas with high-tension <b>power</b> <b>conduits.</b>|$|R
50|$|By 1888, Washington was {{expanding}} {{north of}} Boundary Street NW {{into the hills}} of Washington Heights and Petworth. Boundary Street was becoming such a misnomer that in 1890 it was renamed Florida Avenue. Climbing the hills to the new {{parts of the city}} was difficult for horses, but electric streetcars could do it easily. In the year following the successful demonstration of the Richmond streetcar, four electric streetcar companies were incorporated in Washington D.C. The Eckington and Soldiers' Home Railway was the first to charter, on June 19, 1888, and started operation on October 17. Its tracks started at 7th Street and New York Avenue NW, east of Mount Vernon Square, and traveled 2.5 miles to the Eckington Car Barn at 4th and T Streets NE via Boundary Street NE, Eckington Place NE, R Street NE, 3rd Street NE and T Street NE. Another line ran up 4th Street NE to Michigan Avenue NE. A one-week pass cost $1.25. In 1889, the line was extended along T Street NE, 2nd Street NE and V Street NE to Glenwood Cemetery, but the extension proved unprofitable and was closed in 1894. At the same time, an extension was built along Michigan Avenue NE to the B&O railroad tracks. In 1895, the company removed its overhead trolley lines in accordance with its charter and attempted to replace them with batteries. These proved too costly and the company replaced them with horses in the central city. In 1896, Congress directed the Eckington and Soldier's Home to try compressed air motors and to substitute underground electric power for all its horse and overhead trolley lines in the city. The compressed-air motors were a failure and in 1899 the company switched to the standard underground electric <b>power</b> <b>conduit.</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{case study}} is {{presented}} to show how stress field information {{can be used to}} assess the long-term rheological behaviour of an equivalent geo-material. The example concerns a granitic rock mass at the km 3 scale where an underground hydropower scheme including a new 10 km long <b>power</b> <b>conduit</b> and a powerhouse complex located about halfway in the conduit and 500 m below ground level will be constructed. For design of the underground cavern and hydraulic pressure tunnel, several in situ stress measurements were carried out, using hydraulic, overcoring and flat jack techniques. Integration of the several in situ test results through a continuum mechanics model shows that the long-term behavior of this granite rock mass differs markedly from the short-term behaviour as defined by laboratory measurements on cores. The large scale stress field is found to depend mostly on the softer material that fills up the faults and hence results from the shear stress relaxation over a large number of pre-existing fractures and faults. The overall granite rock mass may be viewed as a combination of stiff elastic blocks separated by soft low strength material, leading to a fairly large scale homogeneous axisymmetrical stress field with vertical axis, with local strong anomalies that correspond to either high or low stress magnitudes...|$|E

40|$|Horizontal Directional Drilling (HDD) is {{a growing}} method for {{installation}} of pipes in urban areas and where trenching is impossible or undesirable; such as in crossing rivers, lakes, railways, and runways in airports. This technique utilizes down-hole cutting heads to create a pilot borehole before it is enlarged with back reamers to allow pulling back of a product pipe. The utilization of HDD for the installation of underground infrastructure (i. e., water, wastewater, oil and gas pipes, telecommunication, and <b>power</b> <b>conduits),</b> has shown a rapid growth compared to other trenchless technologies. HDD can install a range of pipe diameters from 2 to 60 inches utilizing different pipe materials including steel, high density polyethylene (HDPE), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and ductile iron pipe (DIP) with minimum surface and daily life disruptions. Estimation of HDD productivity, project duration, and quantity of materials required, is a difficult task due to variable productivity conditions such soil, project, contractor, and machine conditions involved in operation.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to machine the silicon die of an IC chip and the surrounding chip packaging. The silicon die had to be reduced from a thickness of 85 ?m to about 50 ?m by a machining technique such that not a single transistor of the 40 million under the die is destroyed and at the same the die presents a mirror finish for examination on a back emission infra red microscope. The chip packaging had to be machined such that the six layers of <b>power</b> <b>conduits</b> in the form of copper traces and the dielectric (insulator) between them could be studied at low magnification for discontinuity. Initially electroplated diamond grinding pins were used for the die that was successful but it left undesirable tracks behind that remained even after polishing. These pins were not ideal for the soft but tough chip packaging. A new binderless diamond grinding wheel was developed that had a width equal to that of the IC chip die and also that of the width of the chip packaging with considerable success.

5000|$|When Tuvok {{shares with}} Neelix {{that he is}} {{frustrated}} with the Maquis's unwillingness to adapt to Starfleet protocol, Neelix indicates that perhaps it is Tuvok who is being inflexible in his strict adherence to procedure, and that perhaps {{if he were to}} [...] "bend the rules" [...] a little bit, the trainees would respect him more. Tuvok attempts to get to know Dalby socially, but makes little progress. [...] "Get the cheese to sickbay" [...] Roxann Biggs-Dawson (in the role of B'Elanna Torres) delivered a line that [...] "summed up exactly what fansthought of the new show".

Tuvok and the Doctor trace the infectious agent to a batch of homemade cheese that Neelix has prepared. The Doctor discovers {{that the only way to}} kill the microbe is to heat the bioneural gel packs, essentially giving them a [...] "fever". The crew runs the warp core at 80% without going to warp, which produces enough heat to kill the virus; however, it also initiates a pulse surge, causing many <b>power</b> <b>conduits</b> to be blown out.|$|R

40|$|Occasionally, large {{diameter}} {{pipes and}} tunnels {{need to be}} sealed to prevent the flow of liquids or gases through it in case of unexpected event {{or failure of the}} system. Potential applications include large water and sewage pipes, large conduits for industrial fluids, rail and automobile tunnels, etc., that might be vulnerable to unexpected system failures that require temporary closure. For example, flooding of a freight tunnel in downtown Chicago and the buildings connected to these tunnels, forced evacuation of more than 250, 000 people [1]. The Chicago tunnels have a cross section of 2. 8 x 1. 3 m and {{at the time of the}} accident they represented a network of more than 80 km that was used to run freight, television, telephone, and <b>power</b> <b>conduits.</b> Pumping off all water from the tunnel system took five and a half weeks at a cost of $ 40 million [2]. Although it is difficult to prevent all situations that can lead to such threatening events, damage can be substantially minimized by compartmentalizing the region affected by the event. However, usually there is no space in existing facilities for installing permanent gates. In addition, the cost of interrupting the operation of the facility to install gates would be prohibitive. Therefore, a simpler solution was sought in this work. A design methodology for a high-pressure inflatable structure is proposed. The inflatable structur...|$|R

50|$|The tramway {{was one of}} {{very few}} in England {{operated}} with a Griffiths-Bedell Stud contact system in the roadway. This initial method of power provision survived until 1919 when this was replaced with overhead wires. The reason for the replacement was that gas leaked from the mains which {{found its way into}} the electric <b>power</b> cable <b>conduit.</b> This appeared in a startling and dangerous manner, as the gas ignitied by the arcing of the magnetic switches, with the result that the cast iron covers for the inspection boxes were blown off, and on more than one occasion, hurled into the air.
