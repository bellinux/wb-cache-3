Similar to other monoliths, <b>polymethacrylate</b> monoliths possess large pores which allow convective flow of mobile phase and result in high flow rates at reduced pressure drop, unlike particulate supports. The simplicity of the adsorbent synthesis, pH resistance, and the ease and flexibility of tailoring their pore size to that of the target biomolecule are the key properties which differentiate <b>polymethacrylate</b> monoliths from other monoliths. <b>Polymethacrylate</b> monoliths are endowed with reactive epoxy groups for easy functionalization (with anion-exchange, hydrophobic, and affinity ligands) and high ligand retention. In this review, the structure and performance of <b>polymethacrylate</b> monoliths for chromatographic purification of biomolecules are evaluated and compared to those of other supports.

40|$|One {{group of}} {{polymers}} {{that may help}} relieve the dependence on crude oil is based on itaconic acid, the biotechnological production of which has become feasible. Itaconic acid and its derivatives can easily be incorporated into polymers and {{may serve as a}} substitute for petrochemically derived acrylate or methacrylate monomers. The applications of polymers based on itaconic di-esters depend largely on their thermal stability. The thermal stability of poly(di-itaconates) is dependent, not only on the general structure of the monomer repeating unit, but also on the structure of the ester substituent. Depolymerization, initiated by b-scission or random main chain scission, is the dominant thermolysis mechanism in most cases. The depolymerization of poly-(di-itaconates) may be accompanied by de-esterification, elimination, cross-linking, random main or side chain scission and carbonization. Comparison of the thermal degradation mechanism of polymeric di-esters of itaconic acid to that of corresponding <b>poly(methacrylates)</b> confirms the viability of substituting <b>poly(methacrylates)</b> by poly(di-itaconates).

Although positively charged biomaterial surfaces stimulate bacterial adhesion, it has been suggested that surface growth of adhering Gram-negative bacilli is inhibited on positively charged surfaces. In the present paper, we determined the infection rate of differently charged <b>poly(methacrylates)</b> in rats.

Three rats received six subcutaneous discs (two discs of each charge variant) seeded with E. coli, while three other rats received discs seeded with P. aeruginosa. The numbers of viable bacteria on the surfaces were determined 48 h after implantation. On 50 % of all positively charged discs viable E. coli were absent, while the negatively charged discs were all colonized by E. coli.

The introduction of perfluoroalkyl groups significantly lowers the surface energy of fluoropolymers as detd. by the acid-base approach. The XPS data confirm a higher fluorine concn. in the surface region (the outer 3. 8 nm) as compared to the bulk.

A linear relation is found between the fluorine d. in the outermost at. layer and the surface energy of the partially fluorinated <b>polymethacrylates,</b> irresp. of the length of the perfluoroalkyl chain. This linearity confirms Langmuir's principle of independent surface action.

40|$|The {{possibility}} of grafting {{a series of}} alkyl polyacrylates and <b>polymethacrylates</b> onto a nickel cathode by electropoly-merization of the parent monomers has been investigated and has emphasized the critical importance of the solvent used. Indeed, {{the intensity of the}} inhibition peak, which is the electrochemical mark of the cathode passivation as result of the polymer grafting, clearly depends on both the polarity and the donor-acceptor properties of the solvent. The Gutmann concept is used to account for these experimental results. An increase in the donicity of the solvent used for the electrochemical medium has allowed, for the very first time, several polyacrylates and <b>polymethacrylates</b> [such as poly(ethyl acrylate), poly(methyl methacrylate), and poly(2 -trimethylsilyloxyethyl methacrylate) ] to be electrografted onto Ni. This observation is consistent with a competition process between the monomer and the solvent for being adsorbed on the cathode and amassing in its very close vicinity. The outcome of this competition is controlled by the relative polarity (in case of low donicity) and the relative donor-acceptor properties (when the difference is high enough) of the monomer/solvent pair, and by the monomer concentration (in case of weak competition). A semiquantitative relationship has also been observed between the monomer ability to be electrografted and the electron-accepting character of the vinyl β-carbon atom as measured by 13 C NMR.

Composite films were prepared from a series of <b>poly(methacrylates)</b> and various commercial nematic LC mixtures.
