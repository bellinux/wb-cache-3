Establishing an arterio-venous fistula (AVF) and preventing central venous catheter (CVC) -related infections are ongoing challenges for all dialysis settings. We surveyed VA and routine infection prevention and control practices in dialysis units, to provide national data on these practices in Ireland. Methods A descriptive survey was emailed to nurse managers at all adult (n = 19) and children (n = 1) outpatient haemodialysis units in the Republic of Ireland. Data collected included AVF formation, CVC insertion and maintenance practices, VA use and surveillance of infection and screening protocols. Nineteen of the 20 units responded to the survey. Results The AVF prevalence was 49 % for 1370 patients in 17 units who provided these data [mean prevalence per unit: 45. 7 % (SD 16. 2) ]; the CVC mean prevalence per unit was 52. 5 % (SD 16. 0).

Feeding grain (barley/oats/corn) prior to, or concurrent with, the change to silage appeared to decrease the harmful effects.

The specific aims were {{to increase the}} proportion of patients who receive <b>prophylactic</b> <b>antimicrobial</b> therapy within 1 hour prior to incision and increase the proportion of patients whose <b>prophylactic</b> <b>antimicrobial</b> therapy is discontinued within 24 hours after the end time of surgery. Materials and MethodsThe Breakthrough model was introduced by the Taiwan Joint Commission on Hospital Accreditation. It consisted of experts' meetings, learning sections and action periods with Plan-Do-StudyAct cycles. The control group included 43 patients undergoing abdominal hysterectomy and 29 patients were enrolled as the experimental group.

40|$|Surgical site infections (SSIs) are a {{frequent}} cause of morbidity following surgical procedures. Gram-positive cocci, particularly staphylococci, cause {{many of these}} infections, although Gram-negative organisms are also frequently involved. The risk of developing a SSI {{is associated with a}} number of factors, including aspects of the operative procedure itself, such as wound classification, and patient-related variables, such as preexisting medical conditions. Antimicrobial prophylaxis (AP) {{plays an important role in}} reducing SSIs, especially if patient-related risk factors for SSIs are present. The main components of antimicrobial prophylaxis are: timing, selection of drugs and patients, duration and costs. Compliance with these generally accepted preventive principles may lead to overall decreases in the incidence of these infections. Ideally the administration of the prophylactic agent should start within 30 minutes from the surgical incision. The duration of the AP should not exceed 24 hours for the majority of surgical procedures. The shortest effective period of <b>prophylactic</b> <b>antimicrobial</b> administration is not known and studies have demonstrated that post-surgical antibiotic administration is unnecessary. Furthermore, there were no proven benefits in multiple dose regimens when compared to single-dose regimens. The choice of an appropriate <b>prophylactic</b> <b>antimicrobial</b> agent should be based primarily on efficacy and safety. Broad spectrum antibiotics should be avoided due to the risk of promoting bacterial resistance. Cephalosporins are the most commonly used antibiotics in surgical prophylaxis; specifically, cefazolin or cefuroxime are mainly used in the prophylaxis regimens for cardio-thoracic surgery, vascular surgery, hip or knee arthroplasty surgery, neurosurgical procedures and gynecologic and obstetric procedures.

40|$|The {{principles}} of path analysis and causal modelling are discussed. Path analysis {{was applied to}} three data sets to assess the relationship between group characteristics (number per group and "mixing" subgroups of cattle, feeding-management {{of the group and}} processing factors (vaccination and <b>prophylactic</b> <b>antimicrobials)</b> and subsequent morbidity and mortality in feedlot cattle. The major findings agree with previously reported results but the timing and pathways of the effects are elaborated. In general, morbidity in week 1 was correlated with morbidity in week 2, which was correlated with morbidity in weeks 3 - 5. The same was generally true for mortality. In general, morbidity was not strongly correlated with mortality. Lots (unmixed groups) did not arrive in better condition, but experienced fewer subsequent health problems than mixed groups. (Silage-fed lots appeared to do poorly, however this was apparently due to the positive association between lots and vaccination, the latter being detrimental to mortality rates.) The more cattle per group, the greater the health problems in weeks 3 - 5 postarrival. <b>Prophylactic</b> <b>antimicrobials</b> in the water supply on arrival lead to increased health problems in the three to five week postarrival period. Antibiotic containing starter rations had a beneficial effect on health status in this period. This effect appeared to be partly due to delaying making silage the major ration component in silage-fed cattle receiving antimicrobial containing starter rations. Vaccination against respiratory disease in either of the first two weeks postarrival had detrimental direct and indirect effects on subsequent health status. Vaccination during weeks 3 - 5 postarrival was not significantly related to health status in that period...|$|R

40|$|REASONS FOR PERFORMING STUDY: Neonatal {{diseases}} {{have been}} grouped and analysed but up-to-date statistically significant {{information about the}} incidence and prevalence of diseases in foals is limited. Since the 1950 s {{it has been a}} common management practice to administer a 3 day course of antimicrobial drugs to neonatal foals. This was shown to significantly reduce the incidence of infections (Platt 1977). Since then management practices have improved and it is widely believed that <b>prophylactic</b> <b>antimicrobial</b> drugs are no longer necessary in foal rearing. OBJECTIVES: To determine the 30 day incidences or prevalences (depending on case definition) of various diseases and conditions in the neonatal foal and ascertain the influence of a prophylactic 3 day treatment on the frequency of infections. METHODS: The population consisted of Thoroughbred foals born on stud farms in the Newmarket (UK) area in 2005 (n = 1031). Depending on the stud farm's practice in the use of <b>prophylactic</b> <b>antimicrobial</b> drugs, 2 groups of newborn foals (treated and untreated) were identified and followed for 30 days. RESULTS: The 30 day incidences of infectious diseases under study were between 0. 2 % (osteomyelitis) and 5. 85 % (systemic disease with diarrhoea). The overall incidence for 'total infectious diseases' was 8. 27 %. The most commonly observed noninfectious condition was limb deformities (12. 11 % of all foals). There {{was no significant difference in}} the incidence of infectious diseases between the 2 groups. CONCLUSION: Infectious diseases are still an important problem in neonatal foals requiring further investigation as to which factors other than antimicrobial prophylaxis are relevant for disease prevention. POTENTIAL RELEVANCE: The results provide an up-to-date overview about the frequencies of various neonatal foal diseases. They do not support the traditional prophylactic use of antimicrobials to prevent infectious diseases in healthy newborn foals. However, it should be noted that this study was not a randomised controlled trial and therefore does not provide the strongest possible evidence for this conclusion...|$|E

What is new in TG 18 is that the duration of antimicrobial therapy for both acute cholangitis and cholecystitis is systematically reviewed. <b>Prophylactic</b> <b>antimicrobial</b> usage for elective endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is no more recommended and the section was deleted in TG 18.

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} the perioperative prophylactic utilization of antibiotics in phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation patients in ophthalmology department of our hospital. METHODS: A total of 1 156 cases underwent phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation from November, 2009 to November, 2012 in our hospital was included. Category of antibiotics, administration time point, medication time, wound healing were analyzed statistically and the rationality of above indexes was evaluated. RESULTS: All 1 156 cases received <b>prophylactic</b> <b>antimicrobials</b> by local application in the perioperative period(100 %). The utilization {{rate of the}} antibacterials systematically of 1 156 patients was 166 (14. 36 %); The utilization rate of the antibacterials systematically in patients with two systemic infection risk factors was 72. 09 %; The utilization rate of the antibacterials systematically in patients with three or more systemic infection risk factors was 100 %. All incisions were healed well with no postoperative infections. CONCLUSION: The perioperative prophylactic utilization of antibiotics in phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation patients was meeting the standard of the ministry of health. In addition, the ministry of health organization was advised to formulate the clinical guidelines on perioperative prophylactic utilization of antibiotics in eye operation...|$|R
40|$|Traditionally, {{bone marrow}} transplantation, and more {{recently}} stem cell transplantation, has been limited as a treatment because of {{the risks associated with}} administering high doses of chemotherapy. Allogenic transplants continue to be associated with a morbidity and mortality of> 15 %. Autologous transplantation, on the other hand, as a result of advances in the use of peripherally collected cells instead of bone marrow, <b>prophylactic</b> <b>antimicrobials</b> and heparin, has an associated morbidity and mortality at St Vincent‟s of less than 1 %. This has cleared the way for autologous transplantation to be used for the first time for non-malignant diseases, one of which is Rheumatoid Arthritis. At St Vincent‟s, a trial of high dose Cyclophosphamide followed by autologous transplantation is in progress on a group of Rheumatoid Arthritis patients. For nurses, these patients present a new challenge as they are an unknown quantity. They have had little experience of hospitalisation and chemotherapy, with all its inherent risks and side-effects, and it is unknown what their preconceptions of the whole transplant process are. On Cahill 19, we intend to carry out research looking at these preconceptions and how they compare with the actual experience of transplantation. The information gathered will assist in the setting up of an improved pre-transplant education program and help us lessen the stress of the transplant, both for these patients and the others who will surely follow...|$|R
40|$|This multi-centre point {{prevalence}} study reports on antimicrobial dosing patterns, including dose, {{mode of administration}} and type of infection, in 37 Australian and New Zealand intensive care units. Of 422 patients admitted to an intensive care unit on 8 May 2007, 195 patients (46 %) received antimicrobial treatment, 123 patients (29 %) received no antimicrobials and 104 patients (25 %) received <b>prophylactic</b> <b>antimicrobials</b> only. Dosing data were available for 331 antimicrobials used to treat 225 infections in 193 patients. Respiratory (40 %), abdominal (13 %) and blood stream (12 %) infections were most common. For adult patients, ticarcillin/clavulanate (23 % or 40 / 177), meropenem (20 % or 35 / 177) and vancomycin (18 % or 32 / 177) were {{the most frequently used}} antibiotics; vancomycin was most commonly used in children (31 % or 5 / 16). The majority of antimicrobials were administered as bolus doses or infusions of less than two hours (98 % or 317 / 323); only six patients received extended or continuous infusions. The mode of administration was unknown in eight cases (4. 1 %). The total defined daily dose for adult patients receiving antimicrobial therapy was 2051 defined daily doses per 1000 patient days. Our results confirm that the use of continuous infusions remains rare, despite increased interest in continuous infusions for time-dependent antibiotics...|$|R
