The paper first discusses the disinflation path specified in the Czech National Bank?s (CNB) long-term monetary strategy, and the quantification of inflation corresponding to price stability. Considered next is the issue of what room exists for price level convergence between the Czech Republic and the euro area in the period before and after EMU membership, either by means of a higher rate of inflation or by means of a nominal appreciation of the Czech koruna. The author concludes that the CNB?s long-term inflation target, and institutional constraints regarding prices and nominal exchange rate movements in the period before joining the EMU, should not seriously limit the possibility of price level convergence. Lastly, the author briefly describes the mutual compatibility of the Maastricht criteria under the condition of the rapid growth of labor productivity. During the <b>pre-accession</b> EU <b>period,</b> and during ERM II membership, nominal exchange rate flexibility will be sufficiently large to absorb any inflationary effects related to the relatively high growth of labor productivity. inflation targeting; disinflation; nominal convergence; European Monetary Union; Balassa-Samuelson effect; real exchange rate appreciation...|$|R

40|$|The study „A Cost-Benefit Assessment of Romania’s Accession to the European Union”, {{part of the}} {{programme}} Pre-Accession Impact Studies II {{that was}} coordinated by the European Institute of Romania, tries to offer a partial image of {{an evaluation of the}} qualitative and quantitative impact of Romania’s potential integration into the EU in the short, medium and long run. The focus is on the quantification and analyses of the transformations and effects induced by Romania’s accession to the European Union in terms of generated costs and benefits. The main cost categories directly associated with the accession to the European Union may be grouped in costs related to the adoption of the European norms and policies, costs related to the conformation with and implementation of the standards, costs of assuming the status of European Union member and costs related to the modernisation of the Romanian economy. The main benefits of Romania’s accession to the European Union are generated from supplementation and diversification of the financial resources, from acceleration of reforms and support for the transition through the provision of fundamental elements for the definition of the national economic policies and from the intrinsic status of an EU Member. The impact analysis of Romania’s integration process has been performed separately for the <b>pre-accession</b> and post-accession <b>periods.</b> Also, the scenarios considered in the impact assessment must be differentially conceived, one considering integration as granted, the other one trying to postpone the moment of foreseen integration into the EU.

40|$|Europeanisation from a Neo-Institutionalist Perspective: Experiencing Territorial Politics in Spain and Romania The {{aim of this}} {{doctoral}} {{study is}} to investigate and explain {{the emergence of the}} phenomenon of regions’ institutionalisation in two different national and historical contexts, namely Spain and Romania during their respective democratic transitions and EC/EU <b>pre-accession</b> <b>periods.</b> For Spain, we concentrate on the period from 1976 to 1986, which corresponds to end of the Franco regime, the transition to democracy and the EC pre-accession process. For Romania, we analyse the period from 1990 to 2007, which refers the end of the communist regime, the democratic transition and the EU pre-accession process. The key research questions to be investigated are: What factors or variables determine the internal institutional change (or lack of change) towards the institutionalisation of regions during the EU enlargement process? Under which conditions can we expect change towards the regions’ institutionalisation? Is this phenomenon caused either by external EC/EU pressures and requirements for institutional reform, or by domestic institutions and actors’ interests and norms? Or is it generated by the interplay between these external and internal variables for change? In order to answer these questions, we have constructed a theoretical and methodological framework that would be useful for the empirical data analysis and which is based on the combination between different strands of literature, namely Europeanisation, comparative regionalism and new institutionalism (rational-choice, historical, and sociological). The purpose was to identify in this literature a number of hypothesised variables or conditions for domestic change that may explain the regions’ institutionalisation in the two selected EC/EU candidate countries. In the process of identifying these conditions, which cause change or uphold stability in the state institutional and territorial structure during the EU enlargement process, we focussed on the EC/EU external conditionality in the regional and territorial policy field and on domestic national and subnational elements of explanation. First, we hypothesised that domestic institutional change is supposed to happen either in response to the EU pressures, be it material or normative pressures, or as a usage of the EU, without necessarily the presence of an important frame of external conditionality. Secondly, from a rational-choice new institutionalist perspective, it was hypothesised that institutional change depends on the presence of “formal institutions” and of “veto players” opposed to territorial reforms. Thirdly, from a sociological new institutionalist perspective, it was expected that the regions’ institutionalisation is likely to take place in the presence of “norm agents”, a “cooperative-type of political culture” and/or a “legitimating discourse” in favour of regionalisation. Fourthly, from a historical new institutionalist perspective, it was hypothesised that the phenomenon of regions’ institutionalisation is likely to occur {{in the presence of the}} “historical regionalism state tradition” and of a “path-setting sequence” favourable to territorial and regional reforms. In methodological terms, this doctoral study subscribes to a case-oriented methodology, also known as the comparative method. It follows the method of “comparing few countries”, focussing therefore on a small number of cases chosen “purposefully rather than at random” and which generally supposes the use of qualitative analysis. In operationalising the qualitative comparative method, we mainly used a number of sources of evidence namely: archival records, documents, interviews and direct observation during our field work. We have constantly cross-checked these different types of data. In terms of results, we have tested, confirmed and disconfirmed the hypothesised explanatory power of the selected new institutionalist variables and we have come to the following conclusions. In Spain, we assert, in light of the test of the work hypotheses against the empirical data, that the phenomenon of regions’ institutionalisation is explained by (1) the ethnic-nationalist state tradition, (2) the initial path-setting sequence towards the institutionalisation of regions (the pre-autonomy and the constitutional autonomy system), (3) the reform supportive internal institutions, (4) the important action capacity and access to decision-making of norm agents, promoters of regionalisation and autonomy, (5) the cooperative, consensus-building political culture between the representatives of Spanish nationalism from the central establishment and the representatives of ethnic-nationalist regionalism, (6) the domestic discourse favouring territorial and regional reforms, associated with democracy and peaceful transition, and (7) the weak action capacity and restrained access to decision-making of veto players. This internal domestic conjuncture favourable to the regions’ institutionalisation was as well externally strengthened by the presence of supportive external EC institutions. The Romanian case of regions’ institutionalisation is explained by a combination of causal variables such as: (1) the material and normative EU conditionality, (2) the blocked access of veto players to the national decision-making system, (3) the emergence of a prevailing consensual type of domestic political culture and relations between the centre and the periphery, (4) the incipient existence of formal institutions providing the basis for regional development and assuring the possibility for cooperation between the different state territorial levels, and (5) the emergence of a dominant legitimating discourse which associated the regions’ institutionalisation to economic development and successful EU accession Accordingly, in light of the comparative analysis approach, we have come to the conclusion that not all the causal variables selected from the literature have an explanatory power in both cases. The comparative analysis confirms and thus allows us to make modest theoretical generalisations about the causal links between the dependent variable under investigation and the following explanatory variables. First is the presence of a consensual political culture between centre and periphery. Second is the existence of formal institutions which can provide interested actors with the necessary means for regional and territorial reforms and for regional development. Third is the prevailing presence of a discourse favouring the regions’ institutionalisation and legitimising the minorities’ autonomy claims. Fourth is the existence of a feeble or blocked access to decision-making of veto players. Both cases agree on these four variables, by which we understand that these variables are the causes of the phenomenon under investigation. From the angle of this generalisation, we can assume that whenever these causes or conditions occur, then, their combined effects produce change towards the regions’ institutionalisation. Finally, this doctoral research has thus contributed to both the refinement and development of theoretical propositions derived from new institutionalism, but also to the refinement of the literature on Europeanisation and comparative regionalism. It has also contributed to empirical knowledge related to the comparative analysis of domestic territorial and regional reforms in two candidate countries, Spain and Romania in the double context of democratisation and adaptation for EC/EU membership.

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} {{the evolution of}} Poland's party-political consensus on accession to the European Union, starting with the elections to the contract parliament in June 1989 and ending with the accession referendum in June 2003. The main finding is that the establishment of consensus in favour of accession among Poland's political elites proved much more challenging than the elites' declarations of support suggest. Although most parties declared support for accession, throughout the entire <b>pre-accession</b> <b>period</b> they also supported policy proposals that contradicted accession conditions. The EU's strict neoliberal economic requirements {{and the loss of}} national sovereignty accession entailed proved particularly challenging. Rather than reconcile their policy proposals with EU's conditions, or change their stance on accession, parties rhetorically re-presented the EU into different visions that aligned with their ideological offering. Declarations of support for 'Social Europe', 'Christian Europe' or the 'Europe of Nations' gave the appearance of consensus. But in fact no in-depth consensus was possible since the way in which political groupings presented the 'Europe' they claimed to support was so different as to remove a common denominator they could agree on. As a result, the single biggest change Polish society experienced since 1989 was never really addressed in political debate. The integration project was propelled forward not by in-depth political consensus but by a series of rhetorical compromises. At each stage of the accession process the parties' inability to negotiate more than a nominal consensus prevented meaningful public debate. During each electoral contest of the <b>pre-accession</b> <b>period</b> voters were presented with ambiguous rhetoric in place of alternative policy options that would have enabled the electorate to hold decision makers to account...|$|E

40|$|The author {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} diverging national readings of the key Bologna concepts {{against the backdrop of}} national traditions of higher education – comparability of degrees, finality of qualifications relevant for the labour market, implementation of the ECTS system, and mobility. The basic proposition of the paper is that, in circumstances of semantic dissonance, the open method of coordination (OMC) is barely effective and may create a number of disparate effects. The OMC, having the form of free discourse and lacking enforcement mechanisms, is likely to encourage states to insist on their traditional concepts. On the other hand, a hard law method and guided discourse applicable within the legal framework of the EU may serve as a corrective force. The same counts even more in the <b>pre-accession</b> <b>period</b> if proper conditionality mechanisms are applied...|$|E

The paper {{analyses}} tendencies {{and perspectives}} of employment in Poland {{in the process}} of integration with the European Union. Employment forecasts are based on the model in which employment is dependent on GDP. The analysis shows a difficult labour market performance in Poland in the <b>pre-accession</b> <b>period.</b> The main thesis of the paper is the influence of Poland’s membership in the EU upon labour market performance in Poland depends much on time horizons. In the short run one can rather expect negative impact on labour market performance, but in the medium and longer run positive influences should predominate.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{opportunities for}} {{and challenges of}} representing interests and the lobbying of Croatian interest groups in the decision- making processes at the European Union level. Taking into account the predominant trends and channels for the representation of interests in the competitive environment of the enlarged EU, {{as well as the}} experiences of new EU member states, the logic of access and influence of interest groups from Croatia on the EU policy-making procedures in the <b>pre-accession</b> <b>period</b> will be highlighted. The paper draws attention to the potential of the EU accession process to act as a catalyst for the Europeanisation of domestic public policy shaping and the adoption of new and modern patterns of interest articulation. It also provides incentives for considering the introduction of an adequate regulatory framework for lobbying, as a basis for legitimising the practice in Croatia...|$|E

At the same time, {{the effectiveness of a}} parliament {{is one of the most}} important hallmark of a democratic political system.
