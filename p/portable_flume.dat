40|$|ABSTRACT. A {{technique}} is described for measuring melt-water outflow from snowbanks that develop a basal ice layer. The method involves excavation of channels across ice exposed {{at the lower}} edge of a snowbank in order to divert run-off into a <b>portable</b> <b>flume.</b> Since discharges are measured before the water comes {{into contact with the}} soil, sub-surface flow and soil-moisture changes {{do not have to be}} assessed. Outflow discharges recorded at a perennial snowbank site on Melville Island, N. W. T., Canada, compare favourably with energy-balance calculations and measurements of ablation. measured before the water comes into contact with the substrate. The technique could be employed to provide observed outflow values for comparison with predictions from snow-melt models, to determine snow-melt inputs to experimental plots or to a drainage basin, or to estimate the energy balance of ablating snow. The method was tested at the site of a perennial snow bank on south-east Melvill...|$|E

Water Resources Research, 44, W 11415, 15 pp. This paper {{presents the results}} of experiments in which a <b>portable</b> <b>flume</b> was used to manipulate hydraulic conditions and create bed load transport in a gravel bed river. Flume data are coupled with those from Helley-Smith samples to assess bed load characteristics at shear stresses ranging from 5 to 60 N/m 2. Experiments demonstrate that patches of fine sediment control both the intensity and duration of bed load under hydraulic conditions characteristic of the early stages of floods. The experiments allow quantifying bed load at the entrainment threshold, providing the first empirical evidence that marginal bed load transport {{can be attributed to the}} mobilization of sediments from patches. Bed load transport was recorded consistently once shear stress exceeded 5 N/m 2. The experiments produced low bed load rates (Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|The {{delivery}} of nutrients {{to the surface}} of marine algae can be controlled by the local hydrodynamic regime: in higher flow velocities, the Diffusive Boundary Layer (DBL) at the uptake surface is thinner, which can increase the flux of dissolved chemicals to the algal surface. If the primary productivity of an alga is controlled by the availability of a dissolved chemical, increased water flow should result in greater primary productivity due to increased chemical flux. To test the hypothesis that increased water flow will increase Photosystem II kinematics (PSII) in the green alga Caulerpa we used a Diving Pam Fluorometer to measure the maximum relative electron transport rate (Pmax), Saturation Irradiance (Ik), Non-photochemical quenching (NPQ), the light limited slope of photosynthesis vs. irradiance curve (a) and photo-chemical quenching (qP) and compared these measured values among treatments of varying flow speeds in a <b>portable</b> laboratory <b>flume...</b>|$|R
