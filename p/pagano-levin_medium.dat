40|$|Since 1958 <b>pagano-Levin</b> <b>medium</b> (PLM) {{has been}} used as an aid in the {{identification}} of Candida albicans. However, no statistical analysis of its effectiveness based on large number of random human specimens has been reported. The present study compared PLM (now called Candida test) with Sabouraud's plus antimicrobials and Littman's ox-gall agar without antimicrobials. Of 500 random vaginal samples 24. 8 were true positives, 71. 9 % were true negatives, 2. 2 % were false positives, and 1. 2 % were false negatives on PLM. If only samples identified as C. albicans were considered, 95. 4 % were true positives and 4. 6 % were false negatives. PLM did not inhibit C. albicans from the vagina. No one medium was found superior to the others for the purpose of isolating and identifying C. albicans. Of the five strains of C. parapsilosis, the only other Candida species isolated, all the samples grew on PLM but most were inhibited on Sabouraud's medium plus antimicrobials...|$|E
