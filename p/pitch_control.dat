5|$|The Hunter is a {{conventional}} swept wing all-metal monoplane. The fuselage is of monocoque construction, with a removable rear section for engine maintenance. The engine is fed through triangular air intakes in the wing roots {{and has a}} single jetpipe {{in the rear of}} the fuselage. The mid-mounted wings have a leading edge sweep of 35° and slight anhedral, the tailplanes and fin are also swept. The Hunter's aerodynamic qualities were increasingly infringed upon by modifications in later production models, such as the addition of external containers to collect spent gun cartridges, underwing fuel tanks to increase range, leading edge extensions to resolve <b>pitch</b> <b>control</b> difficulties, and a large ventral air brake.|$|E
5|$|Lockheed {{designed}} the Cheyenne as a compound helicopter, which combines a helicopter with fixed-wing features for increased performance, usually speed. The design included {{features such as}} a rigid main rotor, low-mounted wings, and a pusher propeller. The Cheyenne was powered by a General Electric T64 turboshaft engine. Thrust was provided by a pusher propeller {{at the rear of}} the aircraft. At high speeds, the amount of lift provided by the wings, along with thrust from the pusher prop, reduced the aerodynamic loading of the rotor. At such speeds, the rotor produced 20% of the lift and could be adjusted by collective <b>pitch</b> <b>control</b> changes. Rotor tilt was controlled through gyroscopic precession. The Cheyenne achieved speeds over 200knots (230mph, 370km/h), but as a compound helicopter was unable to qualify for speed records in helicopter categories.|$|E
5|$|One change {{made during}} {{production}} was augmented <b>pitch</b> <b>control</b> to avoid deep stall conditions at high angles of attack. The stall issue {{had been raised}} during development, but had originally been discounted. Model tests of the YF-16 conducted by the Langley Research Center revealed a potential problem, but no other laboratory was able to duplicate it. YF-16 flight tests were not sufficient to expose the issue; later flight testing on the FSD aircraft demonstrated {{there was a real}} concern. In response, the areas of the horizontal stabilizer were increased 25% on the Block 15 aircraft in 1981 and later retrofitted to earlier aircraft. In addition, a manual override switch to disable the horizontal stabilizer flight limiter was prominently placed on the control console, allowing the pilot to regain control of the horizontal stabilizers (which the flight limiters otherwise lock in place) and recover. Besides reducing the risk of deep stalls, the larger horizontal tail also improved stability and permitted faster takeoff rotation.|$|E
5000|$|Famous for his <b>pitching</b> <b>control,</b> Quisenberry {{surrendered}} only 11 {{walks in}} 1983 and 12 in 1984, in over 268 combined innings pitched, and was runnerup for the AL Cy Young Award in both seasons.|$|R
60|$|This, too, {{went the}} rounds, {{and still the}} Rube, though red in the face, {{preserved}} his temper and his <b>pitching</b> <b>control.</b> All would have been well if Bud Wiler, comedian of the Providence team, had not hit upon a way to rattle Rube.|$|R
50|$|Once the {{condition}} of deep stall was recognized, relatively simple preventative measures were introduced, including stick-shakers indicating an approaching stall and stick-pushers which automatically operate the elevators and physically lower the nose before the stall is reached, while the tailplane and <b>pitch</b> <b>controls</b> are still effective.|$|R
5|$|MacLachlan {{reported}} to No. 1 Depot, RAF Uxbridge {{and two days}} later attended No. 2 Central Medical Board on 13 August. He was certified fit to fly and flew Supermarine Spitfire on 21 August. He moved to Bournemouth to see his brother Gordon who was now a pilot officer in No. 501 Squadron RAF. At Queen Mary's Hospital he was fitted with a new arm. MacLachlan explained to the doctors that he required an arm {{that would allow him}} to fly a Hurricane. They designed a limb that allowed him to operate the throttle while taking the control column and firing button with his right hand. They spent hours studying the cockpit layout. The medical staff produced an arm with four spring-loaded pins, like fingers, which enabled him to use the controls on the port side of the cockpit. They secured his left arm to the levers of the throttle quadrant: throttle, propeller <b>pitch</b> <b>control,</b> supercharger and mixture control. The landing gear controls were located on the right side. The artificial arm had to interact with the control column while the gear was being retracted or lowered. His new arm proved sufficient and in September 1941 he flew as many hours in Hurricanes as possible, though not without incident. On 7 September 1941 he force-landed in darkness during a searchlight co-operation exercise. On 28 September 1941 he nearly collided with a Bristol Blenheim in low-cloud. Nevertheless, he was cleared for operational flying on 15 October.|$|E

25|$|The canards, located {{slightly}} astern of {{and below}} the pilot, caused minimal obstruction in vision. They allowed for <b>pitch</b> <b>control</b> in a single-piece, all-moving arrangement.|$|E
50|$|Grach-3 - The second {{projected}} WIG {{agricultural aircraft}} from the SKB MAI was the Grach-3. This aircraft {{was to have}} been similar to the Grach-2 but utilising a centre section with near constant chord which allowed the tailplane to be dispensed with and <b>pitch</b> <b>controlled</b> by elevators {{at the rear of the}} centre section.|$|R
50|$|The Silent Glider M was {{designed}} {{to comply with the}} Fédération Aéronautique Internationale microlight category and the US FAR 103 Ultralight Vehicles rules. It features a cable-braced rigid hang glider-style high-wing, weight-shift <b>pitch</b> <b>controls</b> and aerodynamic roll controls, a single-seat enclosed cockpit with a bubble canopy, retractable tricycle landing gear and a single engine in pusher configuration.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the control of}} the longitudinal dynamics of a reusable launch vehicle in its re-entry phase. The control of longitudinal dynamics mainly consists of the <b>pitch</b> angle <b>control.</b> Here the <b>pitch</b> is <b>controlled</b> using an Linear Quadratic Regulator controller. The feedback LQR controller is compared with a classical PID controller. The launch vehicle model is controlled using the designed LQR control...|$|R

25|$|The Ascender III-A {{is similar}} to the {{original}} Pterodactyl Pfledge. It lacks a canard and <b>pitch</b> <b>control</b> is by weight shift, although it incorporates some refinements, such as nose wheel steering. The 2003 price was USD$6800.|$|E
25|$|On 23 September 1994, a Heavylift Cargo Airlines Lockheed L-100-30 Hercules {{lost control}} shortly after takeoff from runway 13. The <b>pitch</b> <b>control</b> system {{of one of}} its {{propellers}} was said to have failed. 6 were killed.|$|E
5000|$|First model, {{introduced}} in 1975. It has an unconventional <b>control</b> system, with <b>pitch</b> <b>controlled</b> by the canard surface, which is actuated by pilot weight shift {{fore and aft}} in the sling seat. A side stick deflects the wing tip rudders to create drag which causes yaw; the wing's dihedral effect then produces roll. Empty weight 170 lb, gross weight 435 lb ...|$|R
50|$|There were no {{built-in}} audio effects, but samples {{could be}} <b>pitch</b> <b>controlled,</b> playback start-and-end points could be edited, samples could be truncated allowing the deletion of audio bits {{that were not}} desired, samples could be divided and the split parts assigned to separate pads, and samples could be looped and loop start-and-end points could be edited. It also featured MIDI in and out, but no thru.|$|R
5000|$|One {{modified}} B-2, {{dubbed the}} B-2A, featured dual controls {{for both the}} pilot and the copilot. Previously, the control wheel and the <b>pitch</b> <b>controls</b> could only be handled by {{one person at a}} time. This [...] "dual control" [...] setup became standard on all bombers by the 1930s. There was no production line for the B-2A. The B-2 design was also used as a transport.|$|R
25|$|The {{essential}} element of this automatic system is a lever arm attached to a mass in the centre-fuselage, which is connected with the pitch controls. The moment generated by the mass is arranged to reach an equilibrium condition with the <b>pitch</b> <b>control</b> forces at each flight condition, with the flaps moving to a high lift coefficient position at low speeds or {{when there is a}} high <b>pitch</b> <b>control</b> load, and vice versa, maintaining the optimum angle of attack for the aerofoil. The automatic system on the Mü28 is identical in operation with the aircraft inverted, due to the use of a symmetrical section aerofoil set at zero degrees incidence, with the automatic system only turned off for takeoff and landing, and over-ridden manually as desired by the pilot.|$|E
25|$|Subsequent H.IIIs {{were built}} at various {{locations}} including Peschke Flugzeugban in Berlin, Fürth, Giebelstadt, Minden, Bonn and Göttingen. Built {{specifically for the}} 1938 Rhön competitions the H.IIIa {{was found to have}} unsatisfactory turning performance, so the H.IIIc, to be flown by Werner Blech, was modified with a canard surface mounted above and in front of the cockpit to assist with <b>pitch</b> <b>control</b> at low speeds.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} is {{fitted with}} a retractable tricycle undercarriage with steerable nosewheels, allowing a fairly large crab angle during cross-wind landing. The reverse <b>pitch</b> <b>control</b> with which the aircraft is fitted allows the constant-speed mechanism to be manually overridden to reverse the blade pitch angle, thus providing excellent ground-handling characteristics, helping {{to slow down the}} plane to shorten the landing run. This control also allows the aircraft to back up on its own during taxiing.|$|E
30|$|It {{is evident}} that the {{traditional}} reduced-order model that ignores the <b>pitch</b> angle <b>control</b> exhibits some undesirable characteristics {{in the period of}} wind disturbance. However, the equivalent model has almost the same features as the standard model, which can approximately maintain the output power approximate as a constant. The results demonstrate that the active <b>control</b> and <b>pitch</b> angle <b>control</b> are effective and more tally with the practical conditions.|$|R
50|$|Burn {{ignition}} {{is provided}} by a chemical method, by feeding into the combustion chamber special starting fuel which is self-igniting on contact with liquid oxygen. The engine is capable of throttling down to 30% of nominal thrust; the design also allows for a short-duration enhanced thrust (up to 105% of nominal level) in emergency situations. A Cardan suspension provides for yaw and <b>pitch</b> <b>controls</b> by gimballed thrust deflection up to 8 degrees.|$|R
50|$|Each voice module {{has its own}} volume, pan and <b>pitch</b> <b>controls</b> and an {{activity}} light which indicates when the module is playing. Voices are available as discrete outputs, or in a composite stereo mix. The mix output only contains voices not extracted using the discrete outputs. The discrete outputs may {{also be used as}} an effects send and return to add reverb or other processing to individual voices prior to the stereo mix.|$|R
25|$|<b>Pitch</b> <b>control</b> is {{achieved}} by tilting the rotor fore and aft; roll control by tilting the rotor laterally (side to side). Three designs to affect the tilt of the rotor are a tilting hub (Cierva), swashplate (Air & Space 18A), or servo-flaps. A rudder provides yaw control. On pusher configuration autogyros, the rudder is typically placed in the propeller slipstream to maximize yaw control at low airspeed (but not always, {{as seen in the}} McCulloch J-2, with twin rudders placed outboard of the propeller arc).|$|E
25|$|With <b>pitch</b> <b>control</b> {{provided}} by all four elevons, roll by the split ailerons (operating together), speed / approach control by split ailerons / airbrakes and yaw {{controlled by the}} rudder. In this configuration the aircraft proved to be stable in pitch, {{being able to be}} flown hands-off during aero-tow, and pitch could be controlled simply by the pilot leaning forwards or backwards to adjust the centre of gravity. Lateral stability was noted to be poor to fair but acceptable and the aircraft was safe and capable of flying simple aerobatics.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, {{asymmetrical}} thrust {{has been}} used for directional control: if the left engine is idled and power is increased on the right side this will result in a yaw to the left, and vice versa. If throttle settings allow the throttles to be shifted without affecting the total amount of power, then yaw control can be combined with <b>pitch</b> <b>control.</b> If the aircraft is yawing, then the wing on the outside of this yaw movement will go faster than the inner wing. This creates higher lift on the faster wing, resulting in a rolling movement, which helps to make a turn.|$|E
25|$|Developed by Marcel de Bruyere, the C1 was a single-bay biplane with {{staggered}} equal-span {{wings and}} inverted V-struts. An all-moving one piece canard <b>controlled</b> <b>pitch,</b> while roll <b>control</b> {{was provided by}} unusual full chord tip ailerons on the upper wing.|$|R
50|$|The Jet Gyrodyne {{utilised}} the fuselage, undercarriage {{and engine}} of the FB-1 Gyrodyne. The Alvis Leonides nine-cylinder radial engine was situated {{in the middle of}} the fuselage and drove a pusher propeller at the tip of each stub wing and two Rolls-Royce Merlin engine superchargers. The original three-blade tilting hub rotor system was replaced by a two-blade rotor controlled with swashplate-actuated cyclic and collective <b>pitch</b> <b>controls.</b> An empennage provided the necessary stabilization about the pitch and yaw axes.|$|R
50|$|The Husky is {{made from}} {{aluminum}} tubing, with the wings and tail surfaces covered in Dacron sailcloth. Its 33.5 ft span wing is cable braced from a single kingpost. The pilot is accommodated with a sling seat, suspended from the wing. The control system is unconventional with <b>pitch</b> <b>controlled</b> by weight shift, while roll is controlled by wing-mounted spoilers controlled by cables attached to the pilot's seat and actuated by weight shift. The tail surfaces are fixed.|$|R
25|$|The unique {{horizontal}} stabilizer design was free-floating; the attached small foreplane was directly {{controlled by the}} pilot and pulled the stabilizer up or down; so, it was aerodynamically, not mechanically controlled, and this resulted in sluggish <b>pitch</b> <b>control,</b> increasingly so at low speeds where airflow over the small foreplane was lessened, and if the project had developed further, {{it probably would have}} been replaced by a conventional all-flying tailplane. The unpredictable behavior of the design often caused pilot-induced oscillations, with the sudden and erratic deployment of leading edge slats causing the aircraft to be nearly uncontrollable much of the time.|$|E
25|$|After its completion, several {{modifications}} {{were made}} to the first prototype. This machine originally had only the rudder {{at the end of the}} boom, but a horizontal tailplane bearing end-plate fins was later added. A less obvious change was the addition of hydraulically-assisted cyclic <b>pitch</b> <b>control.</b> The second prototype had a modified cabin which allowed for stretcher-borne casualties to be carried. A pair of Ultra-lights were equipped with a slightly larger diameter rotor (32ft/9.75m rather than 28ft/8.6m) for the purpose of improving performance in situations where compactness was not at a premium. It had been recognised that that there was a need for the rotor blades to have a longer lifespan.|$|E
25|$|The {{all-metal}} rotor blades, {{through which}} the compressed air travelled to be ejected at the blade tips, consist of a spar of ing thickness, a honeycomb-filled trailing edge, and feature faired roots in order to the increase their lift coefficient. According to aerospace publication Flight International, the blades possessed a highly homogenous structure, a highly finished surface and a constant profile, and could be easily dismantled to facilitate inspection of the main spar. Additionally, the blade had no risk of icing {{as a consequence of}} the internal current of warm air passing though. The Djinn used relatively standard flight controls, such as the collective <b>pitch</b> <b>control</b> (upon which the throttle was positioned) and adjustable friction trims.|$|E
5000|$|Elevator trim frees {{the pilot}} from exerting {{constant}} {{pressure on the}} <b>pitch</b> <b>controls.</b> Instead, the pilot adjusts a longitudinal trim control (often {{in the form of}} a wheel) to cancel out control forces for a given airspeed / weight distribution. Typically, when this trim control (wheel or lever) is rotated or moved forward, the nose is held down; conversely, if the trim control is moved back, the tail becomes [...] "heavy". Many newer aircraft, especially jet aircraft, have electric trim controls.|$|R
5000|$|In her rookie season, Peppas {{posted a}} 4-12 record with 39 strikeouts and 91 walks in 113 innings for the Daisies, {{including}} a lousy 4.62 ERA which ranked her near last {{place between the}} league pitchers. Nevertheless, she still had a respectable [...]264 batting average. In 1949, she played more games at first base and overcame her <b>pitching</b> <b>control</b> problems, going 3-4 with a 2.25 ERA while hitting [...]150 in 50 games, though she was bothered by two knee injuries.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — <b>Pitch</b> angle <b>control</b> of {{wind turbine}} {{has been used}} widely to reduce torque and output power {{variation}} in high rated wind speed areas. It {{is a challenge to}} maximize available energy in the low rated wind speed areas. In this paper, a wind turbine prototype with a <b>pitch</b> angle <b>control</b> based on fuzzy logic to maximize the output power is built and demonstrated. In the varying low rated wind speed of 4 - 6 m/s, the use of fuzzy logic controller can maximize the average output power of 14. 5 watt compared to 14. 0 watt at a fixed pitch angle of the blade. Implementation of pitch angle fuzzy logic-based control to the wind turbine is suitable for the low rated wind speed areas.
