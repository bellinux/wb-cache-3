The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate the effect of design and material of post with or without ferrule on stress distribution using finite element analysis. Materials and Methods: A total of 12 three-dimensional (3 D) axisymmetric models of postretained central incisors were made: Six with ferrule design and six without it. Three of these six models had tapered posts, and three had <b>parallel</b> <b>posts.</b> The materials tested were titanium post with a composite resin core, nickel chromium cast post and core, and fiber reinforced composite (FRC) post with a composite resin core. The stress analysis was done using ANSYS software. The load of 100 N at an angle of 45 ΀ was applied 2 mm cervical to incisal edge on the palatal surface and results were analyzed using 3 D von Mises criteria. Results: The highest amount of stress was in the cervical region. Overall, the stress in the tapered postsystem was more than the <b>parallel</b> one.

Mathematics teachers are expected to teach their pupils how to use several heuristics listed in the curriculum documents to solve problems. In order to achieve this aim, the teacher needs information about which heuristics pupils are likely to be able to use to successfully solve various types of problems. The project, “Developing the Repertoire of Heuristics for Mathematical Problem Solving”, funded by CRPP, aims to provide the relevant information to teachers so that they can effectively plan their lessons. In April 2004, a sample of P 5 pupils from three primary schools and S 1 pupils from two secondary schools completed a problem solving exercise consisting of nine different types of questions. Four months later, they took a <b>parallel</b> <b>posttest.</b> The different heuristics they used to solve these questions and their success in solving them were analysed.

Methodology: Digital radiographs {{of the following}} posts were taken: RelyX Fiber Post (3 M ESPE), GC Fiber Post (GC Corporation), DT Light Post Illusion (RTD), DT Light SL Post (RTD), Endo-Composipost (RTD), FibreKleer <b>Parallel</b> <b>Post</b> (Jeneric Pentron Incorporated), FRC Postec (Ivoclar Vivadent), Parapost Taper Lux (Còltene/Whaledent AG), Radix Fiber Post (Dentsply Maillefer), EverStick Post (Stick Tech Ltd), Dentin Post X (Komet), Tech 21 X-op (Isasan), ENA Post (Micerium). Post radiopacity was measured in millimetres of aluminium (mmAl) with reference to an aluminium step wedge. Two extracted contralateral premolars were root filled. After post space preparation, taking {{the midpoint of the}} post hole as a reference, each tooth was cut longitudinally into two halves in a mesiodistal direction. On each half, the exposed root dentine was ground flat to the deepest point of the post space, and an even layer of cement was placed and light-cured. To obtain a clinically relevant layer of cement, the material thickness was reduced to 75 μm by grinding with wet abrasive paper. A cement formulation with 30 wt% of filler was tested in one premolar, whilst a formulation with 70 wt% of filler was utilized in the contralateral tooth. Posts were then placed between the two facing root halves of each premolar, and radiopacity was measured in mmAl. Data were analysed using t-test for paired samples (P < 0. 05). Results: Radiopacity of posts ranged between 1. 44 (ENA Post) and 5. 78 mmAl (FibreKleer). In the presence of the more heavily filled cement, significantly higher values of post radiopacity were measured (P < 0. 001).

40|$|Statement of Problem: Researchers {{are often}} looking for {{appropriate}} treatments while considering esthetic aspects and health. In endodontically treated teeth afflicted with severe damage or complete {{loss of the}} coronal structure, a post is usually inserted in the root canal to provide intra-canal retention of the restorations. Therefore, it seems {{that it is necessary}} to investigate the stress distribution in the restored teeth with different post algorithms. Purpose: In this study, the effects of post geometry and its dimensions on the stress distributions and levels in the root of molar teeth repaired by post-core crown (Ceramic, Alumina and Nickel-chrome) were studied using finite element method. Materials and Method: An extracted intact mandibular second molar tooth was embedded in a cylindrical acrylic resin mould and then were sliced. The sections generated in this way were photographed and the images were transferred into the Solidworks software. After tooth modeling, Posts and crowns were designed. Then, the samples were exposed to a uniform distributed load of 240 N with the load angle of 45 degree which was applied over the occlusal area. In order to simulate the surrounding area of the tooth and also the periodontal ligament space, the bone was also modeled. Results: Numerical results revealed that in the prefabricated post restoration, there was a stress concentration in the cervical region. The maximum value of normal stress (32. 3 MPa) was seen in the <b>parallel</b> <b>post</b> with 1. 4 diameter (D 1. 4), and the minimum value (26. 7 MPa) was observed in the double tapered post (N 0. 1). It was observed that the increase in the modulus of elasticity from 100 to 300 causes an increase in normal stress from 69. 5 to 38. 5 MPa and in tensile stress from 69. 5 to 38. 5 MPa. Conclusion: Numerical analysis showed that the maximum stress concentration in post core crown restoration increased when the posts with 1. 4 mm diameter or post with double taper were used. The stress values decreased with the decrease in the post modulus of elasticity. The maximum stress in the residual dentin decreased by an increase in the post diameter. Besides, the maximum stress on the residual dentine changed irregularly by the change in the tapered post diameter.

After 3 weeks of treatment, the eye was enucleated and the conjungtival was examined for inflamatory and fibrotic grading on cofijungtival substantia proptia. Results : There were no statistically different of inflammatory and fibrotic grading on conjungtival subataritia propia between-EGCG and control groups. Conclusion : Application of topical EGCG gave an equal effect as topical dexametasopn on conjungtival substantia propria inflammatory and -fibrotic grading. ...|$|R

50|$|Three <b>parallel</b> rows of <b>post</b> holes {{indicated}} a rectangular structure 23.5 m by 5 m, probably a timber hall {{similar to the}} Neolithic long house found at Balbridie. Smaller post holes and stake holes define eight to twelve round or oval structures, possibly round houses, as well as six gully-defined structures with numerous stake-holes. A large oval feature, approximately 1.8 m by 1.2 m, contained heavily retired pottery shards and is thought {{likely to have been}} a kiln. Possible ritualistic landscape features include a massive post-pit and post holes or pits forming arcs. At the west edge of the site, adjacent to Station Brae, part of a probable palisade was found. Medieval finds included a trackway, ditches, pits and remains of numerous structures including kilns and a 4 m diameter wattle and daub walled granary.|$|R
40|$|Parkinson’s disease (PD), {{the most}} common {{neurodegenerative}} disorder, is characterized by abnormal accumulation of α-synuclein aggregates known as Lewy bodies (LB) and loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons. Recent neuroimaging studies suggest {{that in the early}} phases of PD, synaptic and axonal damage anticipate the onset of a frank neuronal death. <b>Paralleling,</b> even <b>post</b> mortem studies on the brain of affected patients and on animal models support that synapses might represent the primary sites of functional and pathological changes. Indeed, α-synuclein microaggregation and spreading at terminals, by dysregulating the synaptic junction, would block neurotransmitter release, thus triggering a retrograde neurodegenerative process ending with neuronal cell loss by proceeding through the axons. Rather than neurodegeneration, loss of dopaminergic neuronal endings and axons could thus underlie the onset of connectome dysfunction and symptoms in PD and parkinsonisms. However, the manifold biases deriving from the interpretation of human brain imaging data hinder the validation of this hypothesis. Here, we present pivotal evidence supporting that novel comparative brain imaging studies, in patients and experimental models of PD in preliminary stages of disease, could be instrumental for proving whether synaptic endings are the sites where degeneration begins and initiating the factual achievement of disease modifying approaches. The need for such investigations is timely to define an early therapeutic window of intervention to attempt disease halting by terminal and/or axonal healing...|$|R
