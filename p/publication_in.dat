40|$|Scholars {{all around}} the world are almost solely judged upon their <b>publications</b> <b>in</b> (prestigious) peer-reviewed journals.

30|$|For instance, the {{researcher}} Alexandre Lages {{is in the}} top 10 authors for the closeness, but this author has only four <b>publications</b> <b>in</b> the SBRC and his last work was in 2007. However, a careful analysis of the collaborations of this author explains why such a fact occurs. It also highlights {{that the importance of}} an author in the co-authorship network, as identified by the centrality metrics, is strongly influenced by the pattern of his collaborations. That is, despite Lages’ small number of <b>publications,</b> they were <b>in</b> collaboration with very influential and central authors. For instance, in 2004, Lages’ work has as collaborators the following influential authors: Flávia Coimbra Delicato (16 <b>publications</b> <b>in</b> SBRC), Luci Pirmez (30 <b>publications</b> <b>in</b> SBRC) and José Ferreira de Rezende (46 <b>publications</b> <b>in</b> SBRC). Lages also has collaborations with José Neuman de Souza (17 <b>publications</b> <b>in</b> SBRC), Lisandro Granville Zambenedetti, (25 <b>publications</b> <b>in</b> SBRC) and Liane Margarida Rochenbach Tarouco (44 <b>publications</b> <b>in</b> SBRC). It can be observed that these authors are identified by one or both metrics as influential within the SBRC community (despite the author Lisandro Granville Zambenedetti does not appear in both tables, he is in the top 20 for both centrality metrics).|$|R

30|$|Figure 2 {{shows that}} the rate of {{academic}} publications concerned with flipped classrooms increased substantially between 2011 and the end of 2015. This period started with two <b>publications</b> <b>in</b> 2011, followed by 16 <b>publications</b> <b>in</b> 2012, 76 <b>publications</b> <b>in</b> 2013, 136 <b>publications</b> <b>in</b> 2014, and 296 <b>publications</b> <b>in</b> 2015. This substantial {{increase in the number of}} academic publications concerned with flipped classrooms indicates, we will argue, an emerging movement of the flipped classroom as a field of interest. This is underscored in relation to higher education, where the proportion of those publications with ‘higher education’ in the title, keywords or abstract within the overall corpus is significant. In 2012, higher education publications represented 38 % of the total number, while by 2015 they represented 73 %. This indicates a particularly strong growth of interest in relation to higher education and suggests that higher education has come to dominate the scientific discourse around the flipped classroom phenomenon.|$|R
