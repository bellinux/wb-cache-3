5|$|Michigan {{basketball}} hosted its {{on campus}} media day {{press conference on}} October 10, 2012 at Crisler Center. The team was represented by Burke, Hardaway, Morgan and Beilein at the Big Ten Conference Basketball Media Day press conference on October 24 in Rosemont, Illinois. When the 24-person Big Ten Media <b>poll</b> <b>was</b> announced, Michigan was predicted to finish second to Indiana. Burke was a preseason All-Conference selection by the same media.|$|E
5|$|Note: {{before the}} 1974 season, the final Coaches Poll, also known {{then as the}} UPI <b>Poll,</b> <b>was</b> {{released}} before the bowl games, so a team that lost its bowl game could still claim the UPI national championship. This was changed {{as a result of}} Alabama winning the 1973 Coaches Poll national championship despite losing to Notre Dame in the Sugar Bowl.|$|E
5|$|In October, Florida State lost {{back-to-back}} ACC conference {{games to}} Wake Forest and Miami, eliminating them from contention for their division title. Boston College, which had {{finished second in}} the preseason Atlantic Division <b>poll,</b> <b>was</b> ranked No.2 in the country after Florida State's loss to Miami. Virginia Tech, which suffered a 487 defeat at the hands of then-No.2 LSU, nevertheless remained {{at the top of the}} Coastal Division standings as the Eagles passed the Seminoles for the Atlantic Division lead.|$|E
50|$|Social <b>polling</b> <b>is</b> {{a form of}} {{open access}} polling, which {{combines}} social media and opinion polling. In contrast to tradition <b>polling</b> the <b>polls</b> <b>are</b> formulated by the respondents themselves.

50|$|A formal straw <b>poll</b> <b>is</b> {{common in}} American {{political}} caucuses. Such straw <b>polls</b> can <b>be</b> taken before selecting delegates and voting on resolutions. The results of straw <b>polls</b> <b>are</b> {{taken by the}} media to influence delegates in caucus later (as well as delegates to political conventions), and thus serve as important precursors. Straw <b>polls</b> <b>are</b> also scheduled informally by other organizations interested in the U.S. presidential election.|$|R
5|$|Organisation Générale des Amateurs de l'Eurovision (more {{commonly}} known as OGAE) is an international organisation that was founded in 1984 in Savonlinna, Finland by Jari-Pekka Koikkalainen. The organisation consists {{of a network of}} 40 Eurovision Song Contest fan clubs across Europe and beyond, and is a non-governmental, non-political, and non-profit company. In what has become an annual tradition for the OGAE fan clubs, a voting <b>poll</b> <b>was</b> opened allowing members from forty clubs to vote for their favourite songs of the 2014 contest. Below is the top five overall results, after all the votes had been cast.|$|E
5|$|Polling {{conducted}} between late December 2012 to mid-January 2013 by Civic Science {{found that}} a race between Luke Ravenstahl and Bill Peduto would be within single digit percentage points. The polling firm, however, emphasized that the <b>poll</b> <b>was</b> not intended to provide two-way race numbers and that the polling (which was completed on January 16) did not include Michael Lamb, who had entered the race the next day. According to the poll, blue-collar primary voters were more apt to support Ravenstahl while white-collar primary voters were more apt to support Peduto.|$|E
5|$|Shikamaru has ranked highly in the Weekly Shōnen Jump {{popularity}} {{polls for}} the series, continuously placing {{in the top}} ten and reaching fourth place in one poll. The last such <b>poll</b> <b>was</b> in 2011, in which Shikamaru was in ninth place, behind Sasori and ahead of Hinata. Merchandise based on Shikamaru has also been released, including action figures, key chains, and patches in both his Part I and Part II appearance. NTT customers voted him as their sixteenth favorite black haired male anime character. CyberConnect2 CEO Hiroshi Matsuyama referred to Shikamaru {{as one of his}} favorite characters from Naruto.|$|E
50|$|An {{entrance}} <b>poll</b> <b>is</b> a <b>poll</b> that <b>is</b> {{taken before}} voters have cast their votes at the <b>polling</b> stations. It <b>is</b> akin to an opinion poll {{in the sense}} that it asks who the voter plans to vote for or some similar set of questions. The possibility that the prospective voter might change his mind after the <b>poll</b> <b>is</b> very small compared to that of an opinion poll, therefore the margin of error of an entrance <b>poll</b> <b>is</b> expected to be lower than that of an opinion poll. However, the methodology of conducting an entrance <b>poll</b> <b>is</b> closer to that of an exit poll, where actual voters are being queried as opposed to potential voters in an opinion poll.|$|R

5|$|A.J. Styles {{was joined}} by Christian Cage and Rhino in his feud with Kurt Angle, who {{was joined by}} Team 3D. Styles and Angle faced in a Lumberjack match on the June12 episode of Impact!, which Angle won. Team 3D then injured both Cage and Rhino in the narrative, with Rhino being knocked out on the June19 episode of Impact!, while on the June26 episode of Impact! Cage was slammed through a glass table by Brother Ray. Rhino {{returned}} from injury on the July3 episode of Impact!, challenging Team 3D and Angle to a Six Man Tag Team match at Victory Road, while teasing at adding Full Metal Mayhem rules to the bout. An online <b>poll</b> <b>was</b> held to determine the stipulation for the match, resulting in Full Metal Mayhem being chosen. The team of Angle and Team 3D were the victors at the event.|$|E
5|$|As it grew {{beyond its}} {{regional}} affiliations in the 1930s, college football garnered increased national attention. Four new bowl games were created: the Orange Bowl, Sugar Bowl, the Sun Bowl in 1935, and the Cotton Bowl in 1937. In lieu {{of an actual}} national championship, these bowl games, along with the earlier Rose Bowl, provided a way to match up teams from distant {{regions of the country}} that did not otherwise play. In 1936, the Associated Press began its weekly poll of prominent sports writers, ranking all of the nation's college football teams. Since there was no national championship game, {{the final version of the}} AP <b>poll</b> <b>was</b> used to determine who was crowned the National Champion of college football.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the inquiry}} opened, a <b>poll</b> <b>was</b> {{conducted}} in Tunstall where ratepayers {{of the town}} showed themselves to be in favour of federation. As the council itself had voted against federation, it decided not to oppose or support federation but instead to achieve the best deal it could for the town. The three-day inquiry opened on 8 January 1908 and was chaired by Major Norton, {{an officer of the}} Local Government Board. Norton's appointment itself caused controversy with the delegation from Burslem walking out on the first day protesting that Norton had already declared himself in favour of federation. The walkout did not disrupt the hearing but left only Fenton and Staffordshire County Council opposed to the plan, with Tunstall neutral and Hanley, Stoke and Longton in favour. The bulk of the inquiry examined rating schemes based largely on the Owen or Geen proposals from the previous federation attempt.|$|E
50|$|The Associated Press This <b>poll</b> <b>is</b> {{compiled}} by sportswriters across the nation. In Division I men's and women's college basketball, the AP <b>Poll</b> <b>is</b> largely just {{a tool to}} compare schools throughout the season and spark debate, as it has no bearing on postseason play. Generally, all top 25 teams in the <b>poll</b> <b>are</b> invited to the NCAA basketball tournament, also known as Women's March Madness.|$|R

5|$|By contract, the top {{two teams}} in the BCS Poll at the {{conclusion}} of the regular season were invited to the BCS national championship game. In 2000, the BCS <b>Poll</b> <b>was</b> a combination of four different systems: media and coaches' polls (Associated Press college football poll and USA Today Coaches' Poll), team records, a collection of eight different computer ranking systems, and a strength-of-schedule component based on opponent records. Under the BCS, the site of the national championship game rotated every year. In 2000, there were four BCS bowl games: the Rose Bowl, the Sugar Bowl, the Orange Bowl, and the Fiesta Bowl. The national championship game rotated to a different location each year, and the other three games served as bowl games for lower-ranked teams. Later, in 2007, the BCS National Championship was created, adding a fifth BCS bowl. In 2000, the Sugar Bowl was scheduled to host the national championship game.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{creation}} of a fan petition for a special edition, Take-Two stated that they would publish a special edition of BioShock only if the petition received 5,000 signatures; this number of signatures was reached after just five hours. Subsequently, a <b>poll</b> <b>was</b> posted on the 2K Games operated Cult of Rapture community website in which visitors could vote on what features they would most like to see in a special edition; the company stated that developers would take this poll into serious consideration. To determine what artwork would be used for the Limited Edition cover, 2K Games ran a contest, with the winning entry provided by Crystal Clear Art's owner and graphic designer Adam Meyer.|$|E
5|$|Former Croatia {{international}} Zlatko Kranjčar, {{appointed to}} succeed Barić in July 2004, {{led the team}} through the 2006 World Cup qualifiers without losing a single match and topping the group ahead of Sweden and Bulgaria. However, local media outlets accused him of nepotism for selecting his son Niko Kranjčar for the national squad. At the 2006 World Cup, Croatia lost their opening game to Brazil and drew 0–0 with Japan after Darijo Srna missed a first-half penalty. A 2–2 draw with Australia, in which three players were sent off, confirmed Croatia's exit in the group stage. The game was also notable for a mistake by referee Graham Poll, who gave three yellow cards to Croatian defender Josip Šimunić, failing to send him off after his second offense. He later stated that he mistook Šimunić for an Australian player due to his Australian accent. <b>Poll</b> <b>was</b> heavily criticised for losing control of the match, and retired from refereeing shortly afterwards.|$|E
50|$|National Licensing <b>polls</b> <b>were</b> held in {{conjunction}} with every general election from 1911 to 1984, except for 1931 and 1951. In 1919 two <b>polls</b> <b>were</b> held, on 10 April 1919 and 17 December 1919.|$|R

5|$|Gaara has ranked highly in the {{popularity}} polls for the series, continuously placing {{in the top}} ten. The last such <b>poll</b> <b>was</b> in 2011, in which Gaara was in 4th place. Several pieces of Gaara merchandise has been released; including key chains, plush dolls and action figures of his Part I and Part II appearance. AnimeCentral listed him as eighth best villain in anime with comments focused on how flashbacks made him a tragic character {{and at the same}} time similar to Naruto Uzumaki. Additionally, his fight against Rock Lee was listed as the second best one in anime for exchanges in moves and its conclusion. In 2014, IGN listed him as the third best Naruto character when the series ended.|$|E
5|$|The Financial Times <b>poll</b> <b>was</b> {{the result}} of over 10,000 {{respondents}} to nearly 23000 electronic questionnaires of alumni from 155 qualifying business schools. The survey began in July 2006 and all internationally accredited programs that are {{at least five years}} old and that have produced at least 30 graduates {{in each of the last}} three years were solicited. 113 of the 155 had at least 20 respondents and at least a 20 percent response rate. The questionnaire used twenty criteria in three main areas. The poll actually presents all twenty criteria to the reader. Eight criteria are based on alumni responses; eleven criteria are based on business school responses, and the final criterion is based on a research index produced by the Financial Times. The survey responses are audited by KPMG.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech was {{selected}} as {{a participant in the}} game after winning the ACC football championship during the team's first year in the conference. Tech, which finished 10–2 in the regular season prior to the Sugar Bowl, defeated 16th-ranked Virginia and ninth-ranked Miami en route to the game. Auburn finished the regular season undefeated at 12–0. The Tigers defeated fourth-ranked LSU and fifth-ranked Georgia {{during the course of the}} season, and were one of five teams to finish the regular season undefeated; the others were Southern California, Oklahoma, Utah, and Boise State, with USC and Oklahoma being selected to play in the Bowl Championship Series national championship game. Auburn, by virtue of its lower ranking in the BCS <b>poll,</b> <b>was</b> left out of the national championship and {{was selected}} to play in the Sugar Bowl.|$|E
25|$|Entropy is {{a measure}} of unpredictability of the state, or equivalently, of its average {{information}} content. To get an intuitive understanding of these terms, consider the example of a political poll. Usually, such polls happen because the outcome of the <b>poll</b> <b>is</b> not already known. In other words, the outcome of the <b>poll</b> <b>is</b> relatively unpredictable, and actually performing the poll and learning the results gives some new information; these are just different ways of saying that the a priori entropy of the <b>poll</b> results <b>is</b> large. Now, consider the case that the same <b>poll</b> <b>is</b> performed a second time shortly after the first poll. Since the result of the first <b>poll</b> <b>is</b> already known, the outcome of the second <b>poll</b> can <b>be</b> predicted well and the results should not contain much new information; in this case the a priori entropy of the second <b>poll</b> result <b>is</b> small relative to that of the first.|$|R
5000|$|The main {{advantage}} of push <b>polls</b> <b>is</b> {{that they are}} an effective way of maligning an opponent ("pushing" [...] voters towards a predetermined point of view) while avoiding direct responsibility for the distorted or false information suggested (but not directly alleged) in the push <b>poll.</b> They <b>are</b> risky for this same reason: if credible evidence emerges that the <b>polls</b> <b>were</b> directly ordered by a campaign or candidate, it could do serious damage to that campaign. Push <b>polls</b> <b>are</b> also relatively expensive, having a far higher cost per voter than radio or television commercials. Consequently, push <b>polls</b> <b>are</b> most used in elections with fewer voters, such as party primaries, or in close elections where a relatively small change in votes {{can make the difference}} between victory or defeat.|$|R
50|$|Exit <b>polls</b> <b>are</b> {{also used}} to collect {{demographic}} data about voters {{and to find out}} why they voted as they did. Since actual votes <b>are</b> cast anonymously, <b>polling</b> <b>is</b> the only way of collecting this information.|$|R
5|$|In 2007, the ARF {{announced}} that it would nominate its own candidate to run for president of Armenia in the February 2008 presidential election. In an innovation on November 24–25, 2007, the ARF conducted a non-binding Armenia-wide primary election. They invited the public to vote to advise the party which of two candidates, Vahan Hovhannisyan and Armen Rustamyan, they should formally nominate for president of Armenia in the subsequent official election. What characterized it as a primary instead of a standard opinion <b>poll</b> <b>was</b> that the public knew of the primary in advance, all eligible voters were invited, and the voting was by secret ballot. Nearly 300,000 people voted in makeshift tents and mobile ballot boxes. Vahan Hovhannisyan received the most votes and was subsequently nominated for the presidential election by the ARF Supreme Council in a secret ballot. In the presidential election, Hovhannisyan placed fourth with 6.2% of the vote. In 2008, ARF re-joined the ruling political coalition in Armenia and supported strong police actions during the 2008 Armenian presidential election protests that led to ten deaths.|$|E
5|$|Newly united {{as a team}} in ROH, the Briscoes began, in 2003, to {{feud with}} A.J.

Before the last match, a <b>poll</b> <b>was</b> held on ROH's website, asking the fans if they wanted to see a third match between the two teams. Over 80% of respondents voted 'yes'. At Beating the Odds, they returned from a brief absence to score a pair of wins which were depicted in the storyline as being improbable, Mark over ROH veteran B.J. Whitmer and Jay in a Four Corner Survival match with ROH World Champion Samoa Joe, NWA World Heavyweight Champion A.J. Styles, and Chris Sabin, pinning Sabin to earn a future title shot at Joe.
