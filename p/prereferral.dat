40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of the present study was to {{evaluate}} the impact of Utah 2 ̆ 7 s <b>prereferral</b> intervention policy on the numbers of mildly handicapped students receiving special education services. Associated with this purpose, the study was also designed to identify the (a) types of <b>prereferral</b> intervention procedures available in school districts, (b) extent to which the procedures were implemented by schools, (c) effectiveness of the <b>prereferral</b> intervention procedures for maintaining students with handicaps in regular education, and (d) degree of <b>prereferral</b> intervention inservice training. In addition, LEA officials 2 ̆ 7 perceptions regarding the <b>prereferral</b> intervention process were also examined. It was expected, in light of previous research, that the <b>prereferral</b> intervention mandate would decrease the numbers of students classified (a) mildly handicapped, (b) learning disabled, (c) behavior disordered, and (d) intellectually handicapped. Because there was no information to suggest otherwise, it was also expected that the mandate would fail to have a differential effect on rural and urban school districts and on the numbers of students classified as severely intellectually handicapped (control variable), whereas the degree of <b>prereferral</b> intervention inservice training provided teachers was expected to exert a systematic influence on the outcomes. Results of the evaluation showed that the <b>prereferral</b> intervention mandate failed to impact the numbers of students classified (a) mildly handicapped, (b) learning disabled, (c) behavior disordered, and (d) intellectually handicapped, and (e) severely intellectually handicapped (control variable). The mandate also failed to have a differential effect on rural and urban school districts. In addition, the results of the survey indicated that LEAs have implemented a variety of <b>prereferral</b> intervention procedures. However, within school districts, the number of schools implementing the procedures varied. LEA officials were uncertain whether the <b>prereferral</b> intervention procedures were effective or whether they should be maintained. LEA officials also indicated that teachers fail to benefit from their participation in the <b>prereferral</b> intervention process. Furthermore, they were uncertain whether the process is a bureaucratic hurdle and whether it should be maintained. (116 pages...|$|E
40|$|There is a {{national}} trend toward requiring <b>prereferral</b> intervention procedures prior to placing students in special education programs. A review of the research associated with <b>prereferral</b> intervention is presented. Findings suggest that <b>prereferral</b> intervention approaches can have positive impact on special education service delivery practices. The findings also indicate that such interventions can increase the abilities of teachers to educate students who are experiencing difficulty and improve the attitudes of teachers toward such students. Furthermore, the interventions implemented under the <b>prereferral</b> intervention approaches appear to produce the desired student performance, which decreases the overidentification of students as having handicaps. In sum, <b>prereferral</b> intervention may be a viable option to more traditional general and special education service delivery practices.

Secondarily, this study was intended to derive a descriptive analysis of the organization and operation of <b>prereferral</b> intervention teams. Subjects included 351 individuals (members n = 267, leaders n = 84) comprising 84 <b>prereferral</b> intervention teams. Each subject completed the <b>Prereferral</b> Intervention Team Survey, a self-report instrument comprised of items measuring the variables (e. g., organizational climate, team structure, implementation procedures, consultant skills and training) hypothesized to influence team effectiveness. At a scheduled <b>prereferral</b> intervention team meeting, the entire team membership was asked to read a vignette describing a fictitious student exhibiting behavior problems and then, to address the case as if it were a referral being presented to their team. ^ Descriptive analyses of <b>prereferral</b> intervention teams were conducted relative to: (a) demographic characteristics of teams and team members, (b) team structure and composition, (c) team meetings, (d) team training, and (e) resources available to support team process. In addition, factor analyses were conducted for the purpose of both reducing the number of and identifying common factors from among the items on the <b>Prereferral</b> Intervention Team Surveys.

This review discusses the cost-effectiveness of current malaria treatment and prophylaxis in endemic and nonendemic countries. For endemic countries, a systematic search for economic evaluations (i. e., cost-effectiveness, cost-utility and cost-benefit analyses) was conducted, looking at the use of Artemisinin combination treatments in children, pregnant women and other adults. In total, 24 studies were identified investigating the cost-effectiveness of malaria treatments with the focus on uncomplicated malaria, severe or <b>prereferral</b> treatment, all in combination with adequate diagnosis, and malaria prevention by intermittent preventive treatment, respectively. In areas with both Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax transmission, artemether-lumefantrine and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine, respectively, are currently the most cost-effective treatment options. Treatment of severe malaria with artesunate is more cost effective compared with treatment with quinine. For patients that live more than 6 h away from an appropriate healthcare facility, <b>prereferral</b> treatment {{proved to be more}} cost-effective compared with no <b>prereferral</b> intervention.

This study examined elementary school principals' beliefs and practices regarding the types of resources that facilitate collaboration between general and special education staff working on <b>prereferral</b> intervention/Response to Intervention (RtI) teams and serving students with Individualized Education Programs (IEPs). In June 2009, elementary principals in Illinois completed an on-line questionnaire. The questionnaire gathered data on principals' beliefs about the importance of resources, the amount of time principals spent on collaborative activities, and actual resources principals provided to general and special education staff. Using descriptive statistics, McNemar's test, multiple linear regression, and correlation, results of the survey were examined. Descriptive statistics compared information on principals' beliefs about important resources and the frequency these resources were provided to staff. McNemar's tests were conducted to determine if there were significant differences in resources principals provided to staff collaborating on <b>prereferral</b> intervention/RtI teams compared to those serving students with IEPs. The results indicate that principals provided resources inconsistently between the two groups. The results of the multiple linear regression analyses found that the more time principals spent on collaborative activities and the more important they rated resources for collaboration, the more resources they provided to general and special education staff. Correlation analysis found that the instructional expenditure per pupil does relate to the number of resources provided to staff collaborating on <b>prereferral</b> interventions/RtI teams but does not relate to the number of resources provided to staff serving students with IEPs. The results suggest that principals' beliefs about resources are an important predictor of number of resources they provide, but there is a gap between principals' beliefs about resources that support collaboration between general and special education staff and the resources that are provided to staff. The resources were provided either inconsistently or at low rates for staff collaborating on <b>prereferral</b> intervention/RtI teams and those serving students with IEPs. The findings also indicate that wealth may be correlated with the number of resources provided. Based on the findings, three recommendations for practice are: better (a) opportunities for principals to collaborate with other principals, (b) means for assisting principals in keeping up-to-date with best practices, trends, and new mandates, and (c) state funding for RtI...|$|E
40|$|As {{a result}} of the reauthorization of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA, 2004), Response to Intervention (RTI) became a legal and {{acceptable}} basis for determining special education eligibility. While there may be evidence that RTI has had positive effects on the <b>prereferral</b> process for special education in some schools, there still remains controversy in the field of school psychology about many aspects of RTI, in particular the use of RTI in the identification process for children with learning disabilities. The purpose of current questionnaire study was (a) to determine school psychologists' preferences on the use of RTI in both the <b>prereferral</b> and the identification process of students with learning disabilities, (b) to investigate the implementation process in school systems from school psychologists' perspectives, and (c) to examine the role of the school psychologist in RTI implementation efforts and RTI activities. Data were collected from 41 members of the National Association of School Psychologists (NASP). Each participant completed a survey, which related to the above purposes, and responded to items using a 5 -point Likert scale. Results indicated that sampled school psychologists generally responded favorably to RTI as a <b>prereferral</b> method, but varied on their level of agreement on using RTI for diagnostic purposes. Most respondents agreed that RTI should not be the sole criteria for determining a learning disability and that a comprehensive evaluation should take place including standardized cognitive and academic testing. Identified benefits to implementing RTI were: interventions for struggling students occur earlier, improved instruction for all students, greater collaboration between general and special education, and improved method of identifying at risk groups/individuals. Identified challenges to implementing RTI were: need for professional development, lack of teacher preparation, lack of support staff to implement interventions, and intervention fidelity.

40|$|This {{qualitative}} inquiry {{evaluated the}} Student Support Team Project {{and its effects}} on preservice teachers’ knowledge and perceptions of <b>prereferral</b> intervention and student support teams. This investigation is important because <b>prereferral</b> intervention and student support teams have been used increasingly to provide assistance to teachers and to students who need assistance with academic, social and emotional problems. This has created a need to provide preservice education that helps to prepare teachers to use these resources to help their students. This investigation demonstrated a specific approach to such instruction for preservice teachers (i. e., the Student Support Team Project), including an evaluation to determine changes in perceptions and knowledge that resulted during and after participation in this project. Participants were preservice teachers enrolled in an alternative teacher certification program. The research design was qualitative. Data collection included semi-structured interviews, written reflections from the preservice teachers, input from key informants, field notes and research team reflective journals. The collection and analysis of data were done recursively and used constant comparative methods. Analysis of the data revealed three main categories: Knowledge, Knowledge Needed, and Project Feedback. Knowledge reflected the participants’ understanding of student support teams and their implementation and included the following themes: Knowledge about Data Collection, Knowledge about Intervention, Knowledge about Student Support Teams, and Generalization of Knowledge. Knowledge Needed reflected the knowledge participants needed to understand and work effectively with these teams, including the following themes: Knowledge Needed about Data Collection, Knowledge Needed about Intervention, Knowledge Needed about Student Support Teams, and Other Knowledge Needed. Project Feedback included perceived strengths and weaknesses of the Student Support Team Project, including the following themes: Project Helpful, Project Struggles, and Project Suggestions. One key finding was how preservice teachers’ understanding of student support teams evolved from vague ideas about teams, to increasingly specific case-focused ideas, and finally, to generalized understandings. Findings are discussed in relationship to the literature on <b>prereferral</b> intervention and teacher development. Implications for preservice teacher education are discussed.

40|$|A {{literature}} has formed which has historically utilized an analogue {{approach to the}} study of <b>prereferral</b> intervention use and perceptions of acceptability and effectiveness. This methodology, however, may lack ecological validity if variables that mediate intervention selection and perceived efficacy are not linked to research design. If analogue research is to remain viable, supporting evidence of the concordance of naturalistic findings is expected. The current study utilizes an analogue and concomitant authentic approach to study the equivalence of these methods. A sample of 345 special education referral forms served as authentic data. Ninety-seven elementary general and special education teachers responded to an analogue survey for both academic and behavioral problems designed to mirror referral forms. Matched by grade and referral type, results suggest that while the selection of <b>prereferral</b> intervention strategies are not significantly different for analogue versus authentic data methods, the ratings of effectiveness do show differences according to methodology. Specifically, interventions are rated as more effective when presented via an analogue scenario compared with an equivalent authentic <b>prereferral</b> situation. Interventions are rated as more effective for academic referrals than for behavioral referrals. Special educators rate interventions as substantially more effective than do regular educators. In general, Process Instructional Adaptations (PIA) in the classroom are utilized with academic problems whereas Behavioral Conditioning Interventions (BCI) are applied most frequently with students with behavioral problems. A low percentage of students, however, were referred for behavioral problems in the case of authentic data. In the case of both authentic and analogue data, teachers do use interventions which they do not find to be effective and they also do not use interventions with frequency that they find to be quite effective. Self-efficacy perceptions are also related to some aspects of intervention effectiveness ratings. Teachers who demonstrate external efficacy perceptions reported lower levels of effectiveness for interventions they chose for behavioral problems while internal teachers rated interventions for students with behavioral problems to be effective. Implications with respect to the ecological validity of the analogue approach are discussed. The context of educational reform and the changing educational environment is also discussed. ...|$|E

During the 2002 - 2003 school year, implementation integrity was extremely high, most school professionals enthusiastically participated, perceptions of the process were predominantly positive, many referred students' academic and behavioral difficulties were successfully addressed, and special education rates at the school were significantly reduced. In contrast, during the 2003 - 2004 school year, school professionals evidenced minimal adherence to implementation procedures and they expressed significant concerns about the feasibility and benefits of participation. During that year, students' needs were not successfully addressed and the reductions in special education referral and eligibility rates were not maintained. 	School professionals cited the district's decreased financial and personnel support as causing the dramatic diminution in the success of the CAP. However, implementation was actually influenced by complex, often reciprocal, relationships among the district, the building administrator, and the school professionals. Specifically, the following conclusions were drawn: district support influences implementation; district facilitators potentially influence implementation; the principal's attitude and level of enthusiasm influences implementation; the principal's level of control and participation influences implementation; teachers' perceptions about the feasibility of participation influence implementation; teachers' perceptions about the benefits of participation influence implementation; and, collaboration among school professionals influences implementation...|$|E

The study was conducted between July and December 2012 on children referred from clinics to Kalafong Hospital. Data on IMCI clinical symptoms and signs, classification and treatment given at the clinics before referral to the hospital were collected from patients’ referral letters. An interview with the caregiver on counselling received at the clinic was done using an adapted World Health Organization health facility survey tool. RESULTS. Eighty children between 2 and 60 months referred from 12 local clinics {{were included in the}} study. IMCI classification was done in just over half (52. 9 %) of 34 children with cough and 73 % of 15 children with diarrhoea.

There {{is a lack}} of evidence within the current literature on the identification and investigation of liver cancer within primary care. We aimed to profile liver cancer recognition and assessment as well as the timeliness of liver cancer diagnosis from within the primary-care setting in the UK. METHODS: Data were obtained from the National Audit of Cancer Diagnosis in Primary Care 2009 - 2010 and analysed. We calculated the patient interval, the primary-care interval and the number of <b>prereferral</b> consultations for liver cancer. We then compared these data with prior data on the respective indicators for other common cancers. RESULTS: The median patient interval was 9 days (interquartile range 0 - 31 days), and the median primary-care interval for liver cancer was 11 days (interquartile range 0 - 40 days). Of the 90 patients, 21 (23. 3 %) had three or more consultations with their general practitioner before specialist referral. For the three metrics (patient interval, primary-care interval and number of <b>prereferral</b> consultations), liver cancer has average or longer intervals when compared with other cancers. The most common symptomatic presentation of liver cancer within the primary-care setting was right upper quadrant pain (11 %), followed by decompensated liver failure (9 %).

The decision to assess is usually based on the teacher???s documentation, where data or interventions may or may not have been provided. The number of students referred and entering into special education has consistently increased over the past several decades. 	Traditional methods of eligibility determination are based on determining a discrepancy between cognitive abilities and academic achievement. Researchers have scrutinized these methods as invalid and inaccurate; not distinguishing between children with biologically based or environmentally based deficits. Federal law allows for the use of response to instruction and intervention (RtI??) model when considering if a child has a learning disability. RtI?? models and other <b>prereferral</b> processes show promise in distinguishing between students who may have a learning disability and those who struggle due to inadequate instruction. 	This project redeveloped the existing <b>prereferral</b> process at one school site by addressing two key areas. First, the documentation forms and data gathering tools for the Student Success Team (SST) were created to address the need for specific assessment and intervention data. Second, the ???Tool Kit for Student Success??? created a fluid document which houses support materials from staff development and workshops designed to support students with varying needs. Staff development was provided to orient the staff to the redeveloped process and the use of the ???Tool Kit???. Results showed a great increase in specific documented data provided by staff at SST meetings. Education (Special Education...|$|E
40|$|Noell and Gresham (this issue) {{provide a}} {{thoughtful}} and insightful description of Functional Outcome Analysis (FOA) {{as an important}} construct {{for the evaluation of}} consultation and <b>prereferral</b> interventions. Their “framework for investigating relationships between interventions, behavior change, costs, benefits, treatment integrity, treatment acceptability, and ecological validity” (p. 38) is novel, and there is a definite need for expanding our considerations of outcome in consultation research and practice. There is obvious scientific and empirical appeal to the conceptual model of FOA. In particular, {{it has the potential to}} move consultation research in a new and exciting direction. However, practically speaking, one must wonder if the information gleaned from such a potentially intrusive evaluation system is worth the costs. This article will address the perceived scientific and practical merits of FOA...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Using a mixed-methodology, {{longitudinal}} design, {{individual differences}} and contextual {{factors related to}} differential response to general education instruc-tion were examined. We tested a response-to-instruction model reflecting the first three phases of a model proposed by Fuchs and Fuchs (1998). We classified first-and second-grade children at-risk for reading problems into one of three respon-siveness groups and compared groups on reading, phonological processing, be-havioral, and instructional context measures. Further, we examined qualitatively the interaction of individual differences and instructional context. The most per-sistently nonresponsive group scored significantly lower on all individual differ-ence measures, but did not experience poorer instructional settings. Further, this group demonstrated greater difficulty learning {{in the general education}} setting. The response–to-instruction model demonstrated construct and social validity with implications for an improved <b>prereferral</b> system. ing in their recommendations for assessment and identification...|$|E

Unplanned excision of soft tissue sarcomas (STSs) outside comprehensive tumor management centers necessitates the need for wide reexcision to achieve adequate margins. We retrospectively reviewed medical records of 135 patients with STS operated at our hospital {{with the goal of}} examining outcomes, in terms of local recurrence (LR) and metastasis rate (MR), of reexcision following unplanned excision of STS and comparing results with those of first-time planned surgery. Eighty-four patients had their first-time surgery and 51 patients had come to us following unplanned excision at <b>prereferral</b> hospital. Mean age of all patients was 41. 8 ± 21. ...|$|E
40|$|Lack of {{educational}} progress of Hispanics and other language minority students has very important implications for special education as these students are very likely to be referred for special services. Language minority students are overrepresented in programs for the learning disabled, and, {{with the exception of}} Asian students, are underrepresented in programs for the gifted and talented. With projections that one of every three Americans in this country will be a minority by the year 2, 000, greater attention must be given to assuring that multicultural populations succeed in mainstream education and that procedures used to assess functioning levels and to recommend services reflect that those involved in the decision-making process understand how language and culture influence performance. <b>Prereferral</b> intervention attempts to deal with learning and behavior problems that might otherwise be inaccurately identifie...|$|E
40|$|Background: Cancer is {{the leading}} cause of disease death for Adolescents and Young Adults (AYA) in {{developed}} countries. It is believed that young people experience prolonged intervals to cancer diagnosis but evidence quantifying this and identifying higher risk patient sub-groups is lacking. We examined diagnostic timeliness in a cohort of AYA with incident cancers, identifying factors associated with variation in timeliness. Methods: We analysed data from 830 AYA aged 12 - 24 who completed BRIGHTLIGHT faceto- face interviews, for variation in the patient interval (time from symptom onset to first healthcare presentation), the number of <b>prereferral</b> General Practitioner (GP) consultations, and the symptom onsetto- diagnosis interval (time from symptom onset to diagnosis). We present descriptive statistics of outcomes by patient characteristics and cancer site and multivariable regression models for adjusted estimates of associations. Findings: Among participants, 27...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} special educators ’ use of curriculum-based mea-surement as progress monitoring. Teacher characteristics were examined {{to determine if}} there was a relationship between certain teacher characteristics and utilizing curriculum-based measurement. A questionnaire was complet-ed by 191 special educators in the Midwest. Results showed that 45 % (n = 86) of the respondents utilized curriculum-based measurement for at least one purpose (monitoring ongoing progress, part of the <b>prereferral</b> process, evaluating programs, or identifying students with disabilities) and 55 % (n = 105) did not use curriculum-based measurement. Curriculum-based mea-surement for progress monitoring in reading is utilized significantly more often than curriculum-based measurement in math or spelling. Teachers also responded that they had an interest in attending a workshop and read-ing information on curriculum-based measurement. Suggestions for practice and future research are explained. The daily progress of a student with a disability is critical in mak...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This article {{reports the}} results of a survey of the 51 State Departments of Education (including Washington, DC) {{regarding}} their learning disabilities definitions, identification criteria, and operationalization procedures. A conceptual framework consisting of eight components was used in analyzing the definitions and identification criteria. While revealing variations, results showed the continued impact of the 1977 federal definition and criteria. For example, several state definitions now include the discrepancy component, and the use of language criteria is increasing. To determine current trends, the data are compared with those from a similar survey published in 1985. Findings are discussed in terms of trends, <b>prereferral</b> interventions, assessment instruments, and discrepancy models. Since the inception of the learning disability (LD) label in the 1960 s, controversy has surrounded the definition and criteria for LD placement (Franken-berger & Harper, 1987). Originally, the term learn-ing disability was conceptualized to describe...|$|E
