50|$|As {{far back}} as ancient times, the place where Schöneberg now lies was being used by Romans as an {{important}} way station. Proof of this comes from, among other things, the foundations of a villa rustica with a hypocaust, which were unearthed {{in the course of}} building work. The military road running by Schöneberg from Kreuznach to Koblenz later served <b>postal</b> coach <b>traffic.</b> Schöneberg thus had regular links to other places by way of the Thurn und Taxis postal riders as an Ordinari Postort, a regular stop. In 983, the village passed from Imperial ownership to the Archfoundation of Mainz and was later granted to various knightly families. A man with a link to the village, Johann von Schönenberg, even became the Archbishop-Elector of Trier and the instigator of the Trier witch trials. The von Schonenburg lordly family built the first castle house in 1539, on whose foundations their descendants built a newer one that still stands today in 1686. The earlier house had also been Johann von Schönenberg’s childhood home. Later, the village passed to the Palatinate, who enfeoffed the Counts of Ingelheim with it. This lordship ended when French Revolutionary troops came marching into the region.|$|R

This paper deals with the new model of management structure of the Croatian Posts and Telecommunications (HPT), made upon the one-time abandoned pattern of organization as originally based upon the principles of self-management decentralization. Consequently, a new far more efficient and viewed socially far more rational organization system of posts and telecommunications has been required. The exposed organization model has been designed as a unique system with two sub-systems: Postal Authorities and Telecommunications Authorities linked with joint functions (services). On this basis, consequently, the organization of individual levels of postal and telecommunications network and individual geographic regions have been structured. Each organization i. e. management level has been structured according to the contents and scope of its assignments and {{the area of the}} region it covers. By way of interaction of organization (management) units, the organizational unity of the system has been achieved.

50|$|In 1515, Hachenbach {{passed along}} with the other villages in the Eßweiler Tal (dale) into the lordship of the Waldgraves and Rhinegraves of Grumbach. In 1595, the Eßweiler Tal, and thereby Hachenbach too, then passed to the Duchy of Palatinate-Zweibrücken. Like many other villages in the region, Hachenbach, too, was utterly {{destroyed}} in 1677 in the Franco-Dutch War (1672-1678) by French King Louis XIV’s troops. Even though a 1755 agreement between Palatinate-Zweibrücken and the Rhinegraves of Grumbach resulted in the cession of ﬁve villages by the former back to the latter, Hachenbach remained with Zweibrücken and received a customs station at the bridge across the Glan, for Hachenbach had become a border village. This bridge, ﬁrst built as a stone bridge in 1751/1752, was of special importance to the village. All <b>postal</b> and road <b>trafﬁc</b> between Meisenheim and Zweibrücken went across this bridge {{in the area of the}} so-called Hohe Straße (“High Road”). The bridge had its ﬁrst documentary mention in 1693, when it was newly built, although it was still only a wooden bridge then. The cost of this bridge, which was completed in May 1752 and which was thereby the earliest known crossing of the Glan, was 1,746 Gulden, two thirds of which (1,164 Gulden) was borne by the treasury of the Zweibrücken Oberamt of Lichtenberg, and the other third of which (582 Gulden) was borne by the administration of the Lordship of Kellenbach. In 1784, the bridge was heavily damaged in an ice run on the Glan, and thus Duke Carl II August of Zweibrücken saw to it in 1789 that a great two-storey-high and 70-foot-long (actually the old German measure called a Schuh, which literally means “shoe”; this was >20 m) wing wall was built onto the bridge on the Hachenbach (right) side, obliged as he felt to shield the bridge against any further such misfortunes. In 1794, the French military broke the arch nearest the Hachenbach side. Until 1825, a wooden emergency bridge was used, until the stone bridge could be set right again. As before, the cost was split at a ratio of 2:1, between the rightful heirs to the lordships on each side of the Glan, but the total this time was only 850 Gulden.|$|R

50|$|The wooden {{segments}} of the wheel had a shorter life than other parts and so were replaced at intervals, usually because they had become loose in the wheel rim, not because the timber was otherwise damaged. This valuable teak was often re-used. As the segments were too short for most woodworking uses, they were typically re-used as wooden flooring blocks. These were particularly common for outdoor use in railway stations, around milk loading docks and platforms that handled <b>postal</b> <b>traffic.</b> These platforms were regularly in use overnight and the wooden blocks provided a quieter surface than cobblestones for the station's neighbours, even with iron-tyred carts running over them.

From Pecos, Texas it reached Eddy (now Carlsbad) in 1891 and Roswell in 1892, but further expansion was delayed by the depression of 1893. As the Pecos Valley and Northeastern Railway, by 1899 it was extended through Portales to Texico, and then (under a different company, {{as required by the}} state of Texas) to Amarillo, Texas. By that time, control had passed to the AT&SF, which soon absorbed the original name. After 1908 the line to Texico was diverted to the new town and division point at Clovis.The line struggled with limited traffic, primarily agricultural and livestock in the early years, until the discovery and development of significant potash deposits east of Carlsbad in the late 1920s.

5000|$|As {{the first}} station was built at street level and {{therefore}} hindered {{the expansion of}} the city, eight km of railway track were laid for a new rail network that was grade-separated from the street system. In addition, the new station had a long system of tracks. After preparatory work in 1873 to relocate the workshops to Leinhausen and the marshalling yards to Hainholz and the construction of freight diversion routes, construction of the core network, which still exists, began in 1875. The new station building was designed by Hubert Stier in the Renaissance Revival style. It was again a symmetrical building with a main hall and two wings, each of which was completed by a corner building. The eastern corner building with its Kaiserzimmer ("Emperor's room") had a separate driveway. The building was designed in yellow brick with red brick stripes and a sandstone base. The four platforms with seven platform tracks and two through tracks were spanned by two halls with a 37-metre span. After the demolition of the nearly 30-year-old station building, the construction of the new station began in April 1877. It was opened on 22 June 1879 after 26 months of construction. Access to the platforms was via three tunnels and there were two more tunnels for the transport of luggage and for <b>postal</b> <b>traffic.</b> The system of tracks finished in 1883 comprised seven platform tracks and two central through tracks for freight trains. The train sheds consisted of two separate halls, each 37 m wide and 167.5 m long with a 9.25 m wide space between them for the two through tracks. The construction cost was 12.7 million marks for the buildings and 22.5 million marks for the entire station precinct. [...] In 1910, a third hall was built between tracks 10 and 11. The new hall, made of steel, had a span of 27.5 metres and a height of 15.3 metres and was built to a design by municipal architect Möller. Of particular operational significance for the Hanover-Hamburg railway was the completion of the Hasenbahn ("rabbits line")—a branch line planned in 1913 from the Heath Railway from Langenhagen via Großburgwedel to Celle: from May 1938 trains could run directly between Hamburg and southern Germany without running through Lehrte; it was no longer necessary for trains to reverse in Hanover.|$|E
50|$|The {{station was}} opened on 7 May 1860 with the {{completion}} of the Rosenheim-Traunstein line. It was established as a centre for rail and <b>postal</b> <b>traffic.</b> On 1 August 1860, the line was completed to Salzburg. The station initially had four tracks, loading tracks with a loading shed and a loading dock and a turntable. The line had five turnout guard posts. Opposite the station there was the watering point to supply the engines with water. The station building was a two storey brick building, which had three apartments for the station master, the track master (Bahnmeister) and the operations inspector. On {{the side of the building}} on the ground floor there were numerous extensions. In front of the ticket office there were extensions to the left and the right, which housed a waiting room, the station master’s office and the post office. The main building housed another waiting room and luggage handling. In 1888, the tracks of the station were rebuilt as a result of the increasing volume of traffic on the Munich-Salzburg railway. On 7 September 1891, the station was rebuilt again for the opening of the Traun-Alz Railway (Traunstein-Garching railway). In addition, a roundhouse was installed in the station. In 1892, construction began on a new, southwestern extension of the station building, which was completed in 1894. In 1895, the branch line was completed to Ruhpolding, which had to be connected for topographical reasons to platform 1. As platform 1 was (and continues to be) also used for long-distance trains, platform 1a was established at the beginning of the branch line but connected to platform 1. In 1894, work started in Traunstein to duplicate the Munich-Rosenheim line. The upgrade of Traunstein station was completed in 1896. After {{the completion of}} this work, the station had four through platform tracks, a bay platform—where trains to and from Trostberg could reverse—and four sidings in the rear for parking. A new freight shed was built with an independent loading track. During the renovation of the station, a centralised interlocking panel for controlling the signalling was installed and two new signal boxes were built for guarding points. A pedestrian bridge was built in 1899. The branch line was opened to Waging on 1 December 1902. Therefore, another bay platform and extra storage tracks were built. The office for managing rail operations in Traunstein was dissolved on 1 February 1911. On 20 April 1928, electrification of the railway station was completed; it involved replacing the pedestrian bridge with an underpass. From 1927 to 1928 new buildings were built for the railway and the office of the catenary supervisor (Fahrleitungsmeisterei). A new carriage shed for electric multiple units was also built.|$|E
5000|$|Radonja Petrović (Радоња Петровић; Kosor, Kuči, 1670- Jelica mountain, Stari Vlah, 1737), {{known as}} Vojvoda Radonja (војвода Радоња) was the vojvoda (duke) of the Kuči tribe. Radonja's father Petar was a middle child of Vojvoda Iliko Lalev {{and held the}} title until his death when it was passed to his brother priest Mirčeta. Radonja, thus, succeeded his uncle Mirčeta as the duke of Kuči, being the great-great-grandson of Drekale, eponymous founder of Drekalovići. He came {{to be the leader}} of a group of tribes in what is today eastern Montenegro (known as Brda, [...] "the Hills") that {{together}} with Habsburg Serbian troops fought against the Ottomans, and was granted the title Guvernadur of all the Hills by Venetians, for whom he managed the <b>postal</b> <b>traffic</b> with the Ottomans. Prince-bishop Vasilije in his [...] "History of Montenegro" [...] mentions him as one of the Montenegrin commanders who rose to arms under the influence of Prince-bishop Danilo in 1711. In the talks with Austrian representatives in the village of Tešići near Niš, held on 24 July 1737, Radonja and Patriarch Šakabenta promised field marshal Seckendorff that they would mobilise the Highlanders. The Kuči would ready 500 armed men, vojvoda Vuksan Vojvodić of Vasojevići 200, vojvoda Toško of Piperi 200, etc. The Serbian Patriarch and Radonja called on Metropolitan Sava to join the war against the Ottomans, but he was {{under the influence of the}} Republic of Venice, and stayed inactive during the war. Radonja requested from the Austrian feltmarschal that in case the rebels won, they would continue in his service. When talks were underway, an uprising broke out in Montenegro. Radonja's rebels and Serbian troops, and an auxiliary force of Staniša Marković-Mlatišuma, attacked the local Muslims. According to Serbia's plan, they were to take over Novi Pazar, Rožaje, Bijelo Polje and Peć. A Serbian detachment attacked Bihor, and penetrated to Godijevo, where they set up a headquarters in the house of Mustafa Sijarić. Radonja heard that the Ottomans would in their future actions first attack Župljani, which had already crossed to the Venetian side. At the same time, Radonja informed Cattaro intendant Jerolim Buća that Derviš-paša Čengić was ordered to turn with his army from the Sanjak of Herzegovina towards Knin, which they were to attack; and that vezir-Mustafa-paša with the armies of other sanjaks and 4,000 Tatars, as was planned, turn in the direction of Zadar. That information was likely exaggerated. Radonja died on the Jelica mountain in 1737 and was buried there. In 1766, his son Grigorije, who became the arhimandrite of Niš, transported his remains and reburied them in the village of Bošnjace near Leskovac. In 2014 he was exhumated yet again and buried in his birth village of Kosor. After his death, his uncle Mirčeta's grandson Martin Popović was elected as Vojvoda. Radonja's siblings and their descendants continued to bear the surname of Petrović, whilst his offspring adopted the surname Radonjić.|$|E
5000|$|Plans to {{drop the}} night service were {{articulated}} in 1903, but discarded. However, the poor timing for passengers from Drammen and Vestfold, in addition to surplus cost of keeping sleeping cars, forced the night service to a halt from 1918. Instead a late evening service was run, terminating at Brevik at 01:25. To secure compatibility with the Bratsberg Line, which had been opened in 1917, the section of track past Grenland to Eidanger and onwards to Brevik was converted to standard gauge in 1921. When it opened on 16 June it succeeded a period of four years where the segment from Eidanger to Skien had dual gauge. From the same year the Oslo service was re-routed via the Bratsberg Line and Kongsvinger to Oslo. A spur to the cement factory at Dalen {{was built in the}} early 1920s, but removed again during the late 1940s. In general the local trains to Skien were hauled using a NSB Class 32 steam locomotives, and the express train by NSB Class 30. With the extension of the Sørlandet Line to Kragerø with the 1927 opening of the Kragerø Line, Brevik was no longer the outermost railway station along the southern coast. Long-haul and <b>postal</b> <b>traffic</b> was lost, and by 1934 the coastal ferry service was terminated. In cooperation with commercial interests, NSB ran a summer service from Kongsberg marketed as the [...] "bathing train" [...] to attract inlanders to the coast. Patronship peaked in 1920, when 362,384 passengers traveled on the line. Initially the freight traffic was minimal, with between three and four thousand tonnes in the early 1920. This was soon boosted and hit 25,000 tonnes in the 1930s. A halt at Ørvik opened on 26 June 1923 and on 27 July 1933 halts were opened at Prestealléen, Mule, Valen and Dalen. A spur to Heistad Fabrikker opened in 1936. The Brevik Line opened with electric traction from 19 June 1949, along with the Bratsberg Line through Grenland. Thus electric trains from Oslo could reach Brevik via that route. The Vestfold Line would not be electrified until the mid-1950s. With the electrification the line saw a major increase in traffic—by 1951 there were eighteen round trips and nineteen from 1957, operating at a fixed, hourly headway. Following the 1962 opening of the Brevik Bridge the railway saw a sharp decline in patronage as the bus service was rerouted, capturing more of the traffic. Thus NSB decided to terminate the commuter trains to Skien from 1 February 1964. The express trains followed suit and since 26 May 1968 there has only been freight trains on the line. A spur line to Isola Fabrikker opened on 1966 and a new spur line to the cement factory opened on 30 September 1974, replacing an aerial tramway. Norcem has since been the main customer for freight trains on the line, with 900,000 tonnes of limestone hauled in 1998. Proposals for reopening the line were launched in 1989, but never materialized. Grenland Harbour upgraded the port terminal at Tangen during the late 1980s and a branch to the Grenland Terminal was opened in 1993, with the port authority hoping that an international ferry service would be started. However, the plans never materialized. Two El 13 locomotives collided at Norcem on 18 September 1998, although neither motorman was seriously injured. CargoNet started a weekly container train service each from Brevik to Oslo and Bergen in 2014, allowing for transit from ship traffic.|$|E
40|$|Regularity of {{economic}} reproduction is present {{even in the}} area of <b>postal</b> <b>traffic</b> - i. e. the postal infrastructure. The process of depreciation represents the transfer of a portion of the worth into a new product or service and has the character of cost which the user must pay in full. For him to be able to bear the charges these values must be in the first place well-grounded. This paper defines the moments which have caused the implementation of a non-consistent policy of assessment of unrealistic depreciation and in this revalorization of <b>postal</b> <b>traffic</b> infrastructure. Depreciation has the central role in the process of reproduction of postal infrastructure i. e. the overall <b>postal</b> <b>traffic</b> while the revalorization makes the basis for the assessment of the current value which if not known makes impossible the evaluation of the actual worth of depreciation and completion {{of economic}} reproduction of <b>postal</b> <b>traffic</b> i. e. the infrastructure of <b>postal</b> <b>traffic.</b> This regularity of pattern is imminent to the overall traffic system and economic life of any country. </p...|$|E
