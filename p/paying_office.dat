50|$|Andy Okeke is {{an educated}} upstart in Lagos {{trying to work}} {{his way up to}} wealth. He is married to a beautiful, virtuous and honest woman by the name of Merrit. At the {{beginning}} of the film, Andy laments his lack of fortune compared to his peers, but Merrit reminds him that he still has his integrity (as he, for example, would never stoop as low as to sell drugs to earn money), and most importantly, he still has her: the perfect wife, with whom he is happy.Merrit has a <b>paying</b> <b>office</b> job, but is forced to quit after her boss sexually assaults her. In an unfortunate turn of events, Andy simultaneously wastes his and Merrit’s savings on an investment deal offered by a shady friend, and is subsequently left broke. Driven to near-desperation, Andy is finally seduced by his slick-talking, rich friend Paul, who offers to let Andy in on the secret to Paul’s success.The “secret” {{turns out to be a}} satanic cult, wherein members swear their loyalty to Lucifer and kill their loved ones in ritualized sacrifices in order to gain the wealth they had always dreamed of. After much hesitation, Andy eventually agrees to sacrifice the one he loves the most - his wife, Merrit - and reluctantly brings her to the cult. Following her death, he indeed earns the riches he wanted so badly - but his family mistrusts him and accuses him of murdering Merrit, his health becomes shaky, his second wife Ego runs off after he faints at their wedding, and most vitally: the ghost of Merrit starts haunting and terrorizing him, which leads to embarrassing situations that disgrace Andy.Exhausted, he asks the satanic cult for help - but when they insist Andy can only truly give Merrit’s spirit rest by blinding and castrating himself, he runs again and starts to live as a bum under a bridge. In the film’s closing moments, he is “saved” from himself by a group of singing Evangelical Christians, who drag him into their church and finally goade him into confessing to Merrit’s murder, telling him that God will forgive him.|$|E
40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 allows the use of performance-based payment (PBP) {{as an alternative to}} other forms of contract financing. According to the Department of Defense (DOD), the <b>paying</b> <b>office</b> processed about one million invoices for 363, 000 major contracts. In fiscal year 1999, only 195 of these contracts contained performance-based provisions. These contracts are so few in number because they are a relatively new form of contracting within DOD. In November 2000, however, DOD indicated that performance-based financing will be military's preferred contract financing method for future fixed-price contracts. This report reviews the C- 17 aircraft production program as a case study of the business processes used to make investment expenditures during the production phase of a major weapons system. GAO chose this contract because it is mature, stable, and is performance-based rather than cost-based. GAO found internal control weaknesses in the C- 17 program affecting compliance with regulations, policies, and procedures over (1) establishing withhold amounts by the Air Force contracting officer for conditionally accepted items, (2) processing by the Administrative Contracting Officer for performance-based payment requests, (3) processing by the Administrative Contracting Officer of invoices for delivered aircraft, and (4) processing of a delivery payment by the <b>paying</b> <b>office</b> at the Defense Finance Accounting Service Columbus Center on a contract containing performance-based payment provisions. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background and Aim: Multifidus {{muscle is}} one of the short and deep {{posterior}} Paraspinal muscles, which gives stability to the spine during various activities. Studies have shown that in people with neck pain, weakness and atrophy of neck muscles are major factors in the incidence of neck pain. Measurement of muscle's dimensions by ultrasonography provides an opportunity to be able to objectively assess muscle atrophy or hypertrophy. This study aimed to assess symmetry of cervical multifidus muscle size in females with chronic non-specific neck pain and healthy by ultrasonography apparatus.  strong>Materials & Methods: Twenty five women with unilateral chronic nonspecific neck pain and 25 healthy women were participated in this study. All subjects were employed and more than 4 hours working with computers or <b>paying</b> <b>office</b> in a day. Imaging of the cervical multifidus muscles were done bilaterally in the level of the fourth vertebra. Anterior-Posterior Dimension(APD), Lateral Dimension(LD), Cross-Sectional Area (multiplied of two diameters(APD&LD)) and the Shape ratio (Lateral diameter divided by the Anterior-Posterior diameter(LD/APD)) of the muscle were measured and recorded.  >Results: Multifidus muscle size in patients group was smaller than the healthy group. In patients group, size of multifidus muscle in the painful side was smaller than the opposite side. Asymmetry of muscle size between the two sides, in the patient group was higher than the control group (P < 0. 05). The ratio of smaller size to the larger size of the muscle, in the healthy group was higher than the ratio in the patient group (P < 0. 05).  Conclusion: In patients group, asymmetry of the muscle size between two sides, also smaller size of the muscle in the painful side, showed that muscle atrophy has happened in the involved side.  Keywords: Cervical spine, Multifidus muscle, Ultrasonography, Size, Symmetr...|$|E
