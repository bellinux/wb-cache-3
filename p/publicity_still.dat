5|$|The Ferus show {{closed on}} August 4, 1962, {{the day before}} Marilyn Monroe's death. Warhol went on to {{purchase}} a Monroe <b>publicity</b> <b>still</b> from the film Niagara, which he later cropped and used to create {{one of his most}} well-known works: his painting of Marilyn. Although Warhol continued painting other pop art, including Martinson's coffee cans, Coca-Cola bottles, S Green Stamps, and Campbell's Soup cans, he soon became known to many as the artist who painted celebrities. He returned to Blum's gallery to exhibit Elvis and Liz in October 1963. His fans Dennis Hopper and Brooke Hayward (Hopper's wife at the time) held a welcoming party for the event.|$|E

25|$|Posters and {{publicity}} photos often were tantalizing. Woman appeared in poses and garb not even glimpsed {{in the films}} themselves.

500|$|Initially {{advertised as}} Mrs. Carrie Nation and Her Hatchet Brigade, Kansas Saloon Smashers was {{distributed}} by Edison Studios and first released on March 16, 1901. A unique <b>publicity</b> <b>still</b> {{was created for}} the film, a rare occasion at the time. Upon release, the film was screened at Bradenburgh's Ninth and Arch Street Museum in Philadelphia, where it received an entire bill. Nevertheless, the short made Nation and her followers incensed, and Nation found the view of saloons Porter's film offered to be [...] "disturbing".|$|E
500|$|June Mathis is {{credited}} with co-writing the script due to her work on the 10-reel version. Mathis {{was the head of}} the Story Department at MGM and her contract stipulated that she would receive writing credit for all MGM films. She did not actually write any part of the screenplay. She is also said to have changed its title from McTeague to Greed during post-production; however, a <b>publicity</b> <b>still</b> of the cast and crew taken during production clearly indicates that it was titled Greed before the MGM merger even took place. The film's working title was [...] "Greedy Wives", a joke on Stroheim's previous film Foolish Wives; this working title was never considered as the film's actual title.|$|E
500|$|Posters and {{publicity}} photos were often tantalizing. Women appeared in poses and garb not even glimpsed {{in the films}} themselves. In some cases actresses with small parts in films (or {{in the case of}} Dolores Murray in her <b>publicity</b> <b>still</b> for The Common Law, no part at all) appeared scantily clad. Hays became outraged at the steamy pictures circulating in newspapers around the country. The original Hays Code contained an often-ignored note about advertising imagery, but he wrote an entirely new advertising screed {{in the style of the}} Ten Commandments that contained a set of twelve prohibitions. The first seven addressed imagery. They prohibited women in undergarments, women raising their skirts, suggestive poses, kissing, necking, and other suggestive material. The last five concerned advertising copy and prohibited misrepresentation of the film's contents, [...] "salacious copy", and the word [...] "courtesan".|$|E

500|$|The film's {{enduring}} legacy {{stems from}} the disputed belief that Lon Chaney debuted in this film. Jon C. Mirsalis writes [...] "None of the characters are billed in this Rex melodrama, although Chaney is clearly featured in a <b>publicity</b> <b>still.</b> This is the earliest known film in which Chaney appeared, but is undoubtedly one of many unbilled appearances he made at Universal." [...] In the Michael Blake's book A Thousand Faces: Lon Chaney's Unique Artistry in Motion Pictures does not mention the film, but notes that the possibility exists of Chaney performing in a role {{during a period of}} unemployment in 1912. The date of the film's production is unknown, but the book notes that he rejoined Clarence Kolb and Max Dill's company in San Francisco, California in September 1912. The documentary Lon Chaney: A Thousand Faces also states that Chaney's first works were at Nestor Studios." [...] The documentary also notes that his film debut occurred after his wife's suicide attempt in April 1913.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the age of}} 24, Scott's billing and {{portrait}} {{were equal}} to Bogart's on the film's lobby posters and in advertisements. Most often portrayed in publicity stills was the Jean Louis gown-and-glove outfit worn in the nightclub scene, the most iconic gown Scott wore in her entire film career (see <b>publicity</b> <b>still</b> above). In September 1946, a Motion Picture Herald poll of exhibitors voted her the seventh-most promising [...] "star of tomorrow." [...] Production ran 10 June–4 September 1946. It premiered in New York the week of 23 January 1947. Despite the initial positive publicity, the long-term effect of Dead Reckoning was to typecast the former comedian for her entire career. The following year, contrary to general expectations, Bacall herself approved of the casting of Scott in Dead Reckoning.|$|E
2500|$|Russell's {{measurements}} were 38D-24-36, {{and she stood}} 5ft 7 in (97-61-91cm and 1.7 m), making her more statuesque than most of her contemporaries. Her favorite co-star Bob Hope once introduced her as [...] "the two and only Jane Russell". He joked, [...] "Culture {{is the ability to}} describe Jane Russell without moving your hands." [...] Howard Hughes said, [...] "There are two good reasons why men go to see her. Those are enough." [...] A <b>publicity</b> <b>still</b> for the movie showed her lying on a pile of straw, her blouse stretched tight across her voluptuous breasts. Her right hand was behind her head of black hair and her left hand held a revolver. The image was a popular pin-up photo with servicemen during World War II. She did not appear in another movie until 1946, when she played Joan Kenwood in Young Widow for RKO.|$|E

2500|$|Fox Studio loaned Welch to Hammer Studios in Britain {{where she}} starred in One Million Years B.C. (1966), {{a remake of}} the Hal Roach film, One Million B.C. (1940). Her only costume was a two-piece deer skin bikini. She was {{described}} as [...] "wearing mankind's first bikini" [...] and the fur bikini {{was described as a}} [...] "definitive look of the 1960s". [...] The New York Times hailed her in its review of the film (which was released in the U.K. in 1966 and in the U.S. in 1967), [...] "A marvelous breathing monument to womankind." [...] One author said, [...] "although she had only three lines in the film, her luscious figure in a fur bikini made her a star and the dream girl of millions of young moviegoers". A <b>publicity</b> <b>still</b> of her in the bikini became a best-selling poster and turned her into an instant pin-up girl. The film raised Welch's stature as a leading sex symbol of the era. In 2011, Time listed Welch's B.C. bikini in the [...] "Top Ten Bikinis in Pop Culture".|$|E
2500|$|One {{painting}} at least depicts an actress playing {{the part of}} Circe. This is Franz von Stuck’s striking portrait of [...] " [...] as Circe” (1913). She played this part in a Viennese revival of Calderon’s play in 1912 {{and there is a}} <b>publicity</b> <b>still</b> of her by Isidor Hirsch in which she is draped across a sofa and wearing an elaborate crown. Her enticing expression and the turn of her head there is almost exactly that of Van Stuck’s enchantress as she holds out the poisoned bowl. It suggests the use of certain posed publicity photos in creating the same iconic effect as had paintings in the past. A nearly contemporary example was the 1907 photo of Mme Geneviève Vix as Circe in the light opera by Lucien Hillenacher at the Opéra-Comique in Paris. The posing of the actress and the cropping of the image so as to highlight her luxurious costume demonstrates its ambition to create an effect that goes beyond the merely theatrical. A later example is the still of Silvana Mangano in her part as Circe in the 1954 film “Ulysses”, which is as cunningly posed for effect.|$|E
