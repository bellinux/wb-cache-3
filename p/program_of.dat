5|$|From autumn 1943 the Japanese {{government}} took further steps {{to prepare the}} country's major cities for air attacks. An air defense general headquarters was established in November and a <b>program</b> <b>of</b> demolishing large numbers of buildings in major cities to create firebreaks began the next month. By {{the end of the}} war 614,000 housing units had been destroyed to clear firebreaks; these accounted for a fifth of all housing losses in Japan during the war and displaced 3.5 million people. The government also encouraged old people, children and women in cities that were believed likely to be attacked to move to the countryside from December 1943, and a <b>program</b> <b>of</b> evacuating entire classes of schoolchildren was implemented. By August 1944, 330,000 schoolchildren had been evacuated in school groups and another 459,000 had moved to the countryside with their family. Little was done to disperse industrial facilities to make them less vulnerable to attack, however, as this was logistically difficult.|$|E

In this manner, we show how to treat the <b>programming</b> <b>of</b> a multiagent system as an architectural endeavor, leaving aside the <b>programming</b> <b>of</b> individual agents who might feature in a multiagent system as a secondary concern. ...|$|R
