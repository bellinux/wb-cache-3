50|$|Kenya's main {{exports to}} Malawi include: edible oils, margarines, detergents, baking <b>powder,</b> <b>kitchen</b> and table wares, spices, blankets, beauty products, toiletries, {{irrigation}} pumps, tyres, and textiles and crafts.|$|E
50|$|Kenya exports edible oils, margarines, iron sheets, steel {{pipes and}} products, detergents, baking <b>powder,</b> <b>kitchen</b> and table wares, spices, blankets, beauty products, toiletries, {{irrigation}} pumps, tyres, and textiles and crafts to Zambia.|$|E
30|$|From {{the present}} study, {{it can be}} {{concluded}} that easily and commonly accessible and less expensive reagents i.e., household <b>kitchen</b> <b>powders</b> could act as a beneficial substitute for decrypting the latent prints.|$|R
30|$|Prints {{obtained}} using <b>Kitchen</b> <b>Powders</b> like Garam Masala, <b>kitchen</b> King, Coriander <b>Powder</b> {{were very}} less identifiable {{because of the}} less adherence properties of the major components of the powders to the sebaceous secretions.|$|R
50|$|By 1998, {{the barracks}} were a {{property}} of Taganrog Historical-Architectural Reserve and local cossack organization. There are plans for restoration and {{establishment of the}} museum called «Taganrog Fortress Barracks». Soldier barracks, officer hall, <b>kitchen,</b> <b>powder</b> magazine and well are {{to become part of}} museum complex.|$|R
30|$|Tarap fruits were {{obtained}} from local market. The tarap rind and the fleshy pulps {{were removed from the}} TSA. TSA was washed with distilled water, diced into small pieces and dried in an oven at 85  °C. Dried TSA was blended into fine <b>powder</b> using a <b>kitchen</b> blender and sieved to size of less than 355  μm and stored in a desiccator.|$|R
3000|$|Nepenthes pitcher (NP) and Nepenthes leaves (NL) were {{obtained}} from the hills outside the compound of Universiti Brunei Darussalam, Brunei Darussalam, Northern Borneo. Samples were washed with distilled water, sonicated and then dried in an oven at 70  °C. Dried samples were blended into fine <b>powder</b> using a <b>kitchen</b> blender and then sieved size of < 355  μm were collected and used for the adsorption experiment.|$|R
30|$|Seven {{medicinal}} plants (chamomile, milfoil, rattle, brotherwort, pot marigold, linden, peppermint) were randomly collected from spontaneous flora grown in NW Romania. Three specimens of each plant species were intensely rinsed with tap water and distilled water and dried in an oven at 40 °C until weight is constant. In order {{to accelerate the}} digestion process, samples were grinded to <b>powder</b> with a <b>kitchen</b> mixer grinder and sieved through a 100 -μm mesh. Five sub-samples from each plant species were used for analysis.|$|R
30|$|The brown-colored neem (A. indica) bark used in {{the present}} study was {{collected}} from the university campus, Burdwan University, Burdwan. The collected A. indica bark was thoroughly washed with double distilled water to remove muddy materials and soaked in 0.1  N NaOH to remove lignin-based color materials followed by 0.1  N H 2 SO 4 (King et al. 2008; Naiya et al. 2009). The washed A. indica bark was dried in sun for 15  days. The resulting product was directly used as biosorbent. The dried bark was then cut into small pieces and ground to <b>powder</b> with <b>kitchen</b> grinder. For this experimental study, the powdered materials were sieved to obtain particle size of 250  µm prior to use as biosorbent without any further treatment. The physiochemical characterization of the AiBP biosorbent has been reported elsewhere (Srivastava and Rupainwar 2011; Sadhukhan et al. 2014).|$|R
50|$|Fort Fleur d'épée is a {{fortification}} on Grande-Terre on Guadeloupe. The {{origins of}} its name are unknown, {{though it may}} correspond to a nickname of a soldier who lived in it. It was built from 1750 to 1763 to a polygonal plan by Vauban in the heights above the town of Gosier, many metres above the bay. It {{is made up of}} underground rooms leading to small rooms. The <b>powder</b> magazine and <b>kitchen</b> with a furnace are still visible. It spacious entrance hall now hosts temporary art exhibitions. It was captured by the British then retaken by a French battalion under Victor Hugues which expelled the British from Guadeloupe on 3 June 1794.|$|R
5000|$|During {{the siege}} of Porto (1832-1833), Miguelist forces {{occupied}} the fort until Lordelo, even as they were confronted by batteries and the Liberal navy. By {{the end of the}} civil war the fort was destroyed. In August 1860, a plan of the fort included drawbridge, residence of the Governor, chapel in ruins, housing for military officers also in ruins, a ramp to the esplanade, moat, areas inundated by the sea, four quarters for soldiers, <b>kitchen,</b> <b>powder</b> magazine and a vaulted house for quarters. It was assigned for the Veterans Company (1839), during the revolt of Maria da Fonte (1846), and occupied by troops from the Junta of Porto, and was bombarded by the frigate Íris, supporting the government of Maria II ...|$|R
2500|$|Among interpreters who see {{the film}} {{reflecting}} more subtly the social concerns that animate other Kubrick films, {{one of the earliest}} and most well-known viewpoints was discussed in an essay by ABC reporter Bill Blakemore entitled [...] "Kubrick's 'Shining' Secret: Film's Hidden Horror Is The Murder Of The Indian", first published in The Washington Post on July 12, 1987. [...] He believes that indirect references to American killings of Native Americans pervade the film, as exemplified by the Amerindian logos on the baking <b>powder</b> in the <b>kitchen,</b> and the Amerindian artwork that appears throughout the hotel, though no Native Americans are ever seen. [...] Stuart Ullman tells Wendy that when building the hotel, a few Indian attacks had to be fended off since it was constructed on an Indian burial ground.|$|R
30|$|In {{the present}} study, the latent finger/ thumb {{impressions}} of 100 individuals (both male and females) were collected with variable donor capabilities on non-porous metallic substrate i.e., aluminium foil. Powder dusting method {{is used to}} develop latent fingerprints in this study. For development of latent fingerprints, different powders were used. A few grams of commercially available kitchen products (fine blended powders) like turmeric powder (haldi), red chilli powder (lalmirch), cumin <b>powder</b> (cumin), <b>kitchen</b> king masala, lime stone powder (chuna), coriander powder, garam masala powder, gram flour were taken. These powders were individually stored in glass bottles and sealed. The research work {{was carried out in}} the month of November when the variation in temperature was from 15 o to 25 o with relative humidity ranging between 50 % to 68 %. For successful developments, powder was applied to a surface by sprinkling powder with the help of brush and lifting the developed prints with help of tapping method. As powder was brushed over an area containing a latent print, particles adhere to greasy deposits. Only ridge patterns stand out from the contrasting background. After waiting for a fraction of seconds, excess of powders adhering to the prints were dusted off to visualize clear prints. Comparative analysis was done for the powders to check for the best results obtained on the selected substratum (Aluminum foil).|$|R
50|$|This 2 1/2-story Classic revival {{home was}} {{designed}} 1904-1905 by architect Atlee Ayres for San Antonio business man David J. Woodward (1864-1925) {{and his wife}} May Bock Woodward (1866-1942). The couple flipped twenty-three homes during their married life. David built the houses, and May decorated them. Each property would eventually be sold for profit when the couple moved upward to a more expensive residence. After David Woodward died, his wife sold the house at 1717 San Pedro in 1926 to the Woman's Club of San Antonio for $47,000. It is currently being used as the organization's clubhouse. The {{first floor of the}} house are the interior parlor, library with fireplace, butler's pantry, office, <b>kitchen,</b> <b>powder</b> room and dining room. When Ayres designed the house, the second floor served as living quarters with five bedrooms, bath and sitting room. Alterations made by the club converted three of the bedrooms into a single meeting room. The Woodwards intended the top floor to be a ballroom and had it designed with window box seats. Currently, it serves as storage space.|$|R
