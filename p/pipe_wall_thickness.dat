50|$|The {{thicknesses}} of {{the water}} pipe and tube walls can vary. <b>Pipe</b> <b>wall</b> <b>thickness</b> is denoted by various schedules or for large bore polyethylene pipe in the UK by the Standard Dimension Ratio (SDR), defined as {{the ratio of the}} pipe diameter to its wall thickness. <b>Pipe</b> <b>wall</b> <b>thickness</b> increases with schedule, and is available in schedules 20, 40, 80, and higher in special cases. The schedule is largely determined by the operating pressure of the system, with higher pressures commanding greater thickness. Copper tubing is available in four wall thicknesses: type DWV (thinnest wall; only allowed as drain pipe per UPC), type 'M' (thin; typically only allowed as drain pipe by IPC code), type 'L' (thicker, standard duty for water lines and water service), and type 'K' (thickest, typically used underground between the main and the meter). Because piping and tubing are commodities, having a greater wall thickness implies higher initial cost. Thicker walled pipe generally implies greater durability and higher pressure tolerances.|$|E

Precast {{thin-wall}} {{steel and}} spun concrete composite pile (TSC pile) {{is a kind}} of new type of steel-concrete composite pile whose bearing performance is between steel pile and concrete pile. This article adopted FEM software to set up 3 D TSC pile model to analyze its performance.

This led to higher plastic strains and consequently, faster crack growth rates. Also, dwell time influences fatigue life with longer dwell times {{found to be more}} damaging.

40|$|Abstract. Metal pipes have a {{long history}} as fluid conduits, and are {{commonly}} joined with components such as elbows to form bent transport paths. However, with the increasing demands for economy and energy saving, pipes with reduced joints and thinner walls are desired. The number of joints can be reduced by a drawing and bending process that forms a bend section at any position in the pipe. However, this approach incurs problems such as wrinkling and flattening, especially under conditions of large bending angle, decreased bending radius, and thin <b>pipe</b> <b>walls.</b> In this research, applying vibrations to the mandrel was trialed as an approach for controlling the wrinkle depth and flattening. First, processing experiments were performed on thin walled <b>pipes</b> (<b>wall</b> <b>thickness</b> = 0. 5 mm; outer diameter = 14 mm). The change of flattening and the number and depths of wrinkles were investigated in the presence and absence of vibrations. Next, simulations were performed using the commercial nonlinear finite element software. Through these simulations, the flatness and appearance of wrinkles were analyzed by modeling the behavior and distribution of stresses and strains in the processing process. The application of vibration to the mandrel appears to be a promising approach for controlling the wrinkling and flattening problems during pipe processing...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Accurate {{evaluation}} of dimensions directly from tomographic images, restored from only few x-ray projections, {{made in a}} limited observation sector, is considered exploiting pipes wall thickness assessment like a typical example. Both experiments and simulations are used to extract main errors sources. It is taken from as known, that neglecting of the scattered radiation and beam hardening effects results in image blurring, strong artifacts and finally inaccurate sizing. The computerized technique is developed to simulate the contribution of scattered radiation and beam hardening {{for the purpose of}} their further extraction from projected data. After those accompanying effects extraction the iterative Bayesian techniques are applied to reconstruct images from the projections, using volumetric and/or shell representation of the objects like pipes. The achieved error of virtual <b>pipe</b> <b>wall</b> <b>thickness</b> assessment from 3 D images can be as small as 300 µk comparing to 1 mm provided by modern techniques.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper was to present the results of a special {{abrasion}} test of poly(vinyl chloride) and polypropylene filled with calcium carbonate pipes. Abrasion test’s results for pipes were compared with results of standard abrasion test (Taber method) and hardness test. Design/methodology/approach: Short cuts of pipe were subjected to erosion caused by erodent, usually a mixture of special kind of sand and water. The changes of <b>pipe’s</b> <b>wall</b> <b>thickness</b> was a measure of resistance to erosion. Additionally abrasion resistance was measured using Taber method and ball-hardness was measured using Brinell apparatus. Findings: Calcium carbonate filled polypropylene exhibited lower resistance to abrasion than hard poly(vinyl chloride). Probably it is the result of filler presence in polypropylene. No correlation between hardness and abrasion resistance was found. Research limitations/implications: Applied method may be used to compare different pipe’s materials but its results may not be applied to other plastics products and to other abrasion conditions. Practical implications: Abrasion test used in the research may be applied to compare different materials and different pipelines components. Achieved results showed that calcium carbonate without surface preparation decrease abrasion resistance of polypropylene. Originality/value: Applied method is rarely used for polymer materials testing. Results of presented research may be interesting for pipe manufactures and polymer pipe’s formulations producers...|$|R
