Barriers to the {{provision}} of <b>psychiatric</b> <b>nursing</b> care have been reported worldwide, although literature on these barriers in Nigeria is limited. The {{purpose of the study}} was to explore and describe the barriers to provision of <b>psychiatric</b> <b>nursing</b> care, using the case study methodology. A sample of 12 participants was recruited for the study, comprising four key informants and eight study participants. The data collection methods included grand tour interviews with the key informants, in-depth interviews with key informants and other study participants and participant observation of all 12 participants. Content analysis was conducted. It yielded five themes related to barriers, namely: personal barriers to provision of <b>psychiatric</b> <b>nursing</b> care, relationship related barriers to provision of <b>psychiatric</b> <b>nursing</b> care, environmental barriers to provision of <b>psychiatric</b> <b>nursing</b> care, organisational barriers to provision of <b>psychiatric</b> <b>nursing</b> care and “public” related barriers to provision of <b>psychiatric</b> <b>nursing</b> care. The sixth theme: Motivators to provision of <b>psychiatric</b> <b>nursing</b> care despite barriers was discovered serendipitously. These findings are in line with previous findings of studies carried out in other settings.

The emphasis is on speedy recovery and encouragement of independency. This {{gives rise to a}} need to educate psychiatric patients therapeutically, on an equal basis as partners. Thus, the focus is on psycho-education. The researcher observed that when <b>psychiatric</b> <b>nurses</b> conduct patient education {{it appears to be a}} one-way process. Unfortunately this paves the way for the psychiatric patients to become dependent on <b>psychiatric</b> <b>nurses</b> for the maintenance of their needs. As a result this research was initiated. In this research conclusions were drawn and guidelines were recommended on: Theoretical knowledge that supports psycho-education; Facilitated group work on attitudes that have an effect on psychoeducation; and Skills/techniques required in facilitating psycho-education. These guidelines are for <b>psychiatric</b> <b>nurses</b> to implement psychoeducation in order to promote mental health of psychiatric patients.

40|$|Abstract: We {{studied the}} rate of {{participation}} of <b>psychiatric</b> <b>nurses</b> in mental healthcare in Kenya. A simple questionnaire was delivered to 50 nurses attending a mental health meeting of the National Nursing Alliance of Kenya in April 2012. Of the 40 <b>nurses</b> with <b>psychiatric</b> <b>nursing</b> qualifications, 19 worked specifically as psychiatric nurses; among those employed as general nurses, half their case-loads were mental health patients. Ten per cent of <b>psychiatric</b> <b>nurses</b> had run a private clinic (75 % of them general clinics) and 15 % were doing private locum work alongside salaried employment. Kenya would need {{to increase the number}} of <b>psychiatric</b> <b>nurses</b> 20 -fold in order to achieve an internationally recommended ratio (for low-income countries) of 12 <b>psychiatric</b> <b>nurses</b> per 100 000.

25|$|The most {{important}} duty of a <b>psychiatric</b> <b>nurse</b> {{is to maintain}} a positive therapeutic relationship with patients in a clinical setting. The fundamental elements of mental health care revolve around the interpersonal relations and interactions established between professionals and clients. Caring for people with mental illnesses demands an intensified presence and {{a strong desire to}} be supportive. Dziopa and Ahern assert that there are nine critical mental health aspects of the psychiatric nursing practicum: understanding and empathy, individuality, providing support, being there/being available, being 'genuine', promoting equality, demonstrating respect, demonstrating clear boundaries, and demonstrating self-awareness for the patient.|$|E
25|$|Psychiatric nursing {{or mental}} health nursing is the {{appointed}} {{position of a}} nursing that has specialized in mental health and cares for {{people of all ages}} with mental illness or mental distress, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, psychosis, depression, dementia and many more. Nurses in this area receive specific training in psychological therapies, building a therapeutic alliance, dealing with challenging behavior, and the administration of psychiatric medication. In most countries, a <b>psychiatric</b> <b>nurse</b> will have to have attained a bachelor's degree in nursing to become a registered nurse (RN) and specialise in mental health. Degrees vary in different countries, and are governed by country-specific regulations. Psychiatric nurses work in hospitals, mental institutes, correctional institutes, and many other facilities.|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MN) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, 2010. The {{purpose of}} this {{qualitative}} {{study was to explore}} how <b>psychiatric</b> <b>nurses</b> working with <b>psychiatric</b> clients in the EThekwini District understand the spiritual dimension of holistic <b>psychiatric</b> <b>nursing</b> practice. Descriptive phenomenology informed the study design, data collection and analysis. Integrating spiritual and psychiatric care is an important contemporary issue for <b>psychiatric</b> <b>nursing</b> if the profession is to continue to define itself as a holistic and client-centered activity and to provide socially responsive care (Greasley et al 2001; Mohr, 2006). Local data about how nurses understand and practice spirituality in their working encounters with clients would be an important first step in enhancing holistic, patient-centered <b>psychiatric</b> <b>nursing</b> care in the South African context. Purposeful sampling was used to select the seven <b>psychiatric</b> <b>nurses</b> working in <b>psychiatric</b> settings in the EThekwini District. These participants were selected from the advanced <b>psychiatric</b> <b>nursing</b> classes of the School of Nursing of the University of KwaZulu-Natal for 2008 / 2009 and 2009 / 2010. Data were collected through in-depth interviews lasting for 45 minutes to lhour and were audio-taped and later transcribed to facilitate easy analysis. The Colaizzi Method of data analysis and representation was utilized. The following four themes emerged during the analysis of the data. Each theme had between three and twenty one associated significant statements. Theme 1 revolved around the higher power of spirituality, religion and their relationship. The participants conceptualized spirituality in a variety of ways, linking spirituality to religion and to cultural values, daily moral and interpersonal experiences with self and others that provide direction and meaning in life. Spirituality was conceived of as "the glue that brings people together" and as a primary source of meaning making in daily life that provides people, nurses and patients with a sense of belonging and of joy, hope, and comfort in both difficult and happy times. The second theme "Central to but forgotten in <b>psychiatric</b> <b>nursing</b> practice" concurs with the literature view that spirituality and <b>psychiatric</b> <b>nursing</b> care are related, although spirituality is often forgotten in <b>psychiatric</b> <b>nursing</b> practice. Participants linked spirituality specifically to Maslow's Hierarchy of needs. The third theme entitled "Psychiatric nursing for the spirit: Enabling and limiting factors identifies a number of factors which influence how <b>psychiatric</b> <b>nurses</b> engage with this dimension of holistic <b>psychiatric</b> <b>nursing</b> practice. This theme focuses on factors which influence <b>psychiatric</b> <b>nurses</b> in providing spiritual care for their patients. Enabling factors include psychiatric' nurses own spiritual orientation and knowledge about spiritual care enables them to provide spiritual care whereas limiting factors include the lack of spiritual education and spiritual knowledge in providing this care. The final theme highlights what these nurses see as important for developing their ability to provide spiritual assistance and includes education in method of spiritual assessment and intervention as the basis for providing holistic <b>psychiatric</b> <b>nursing</b> practice. A number of recommendations for <b>psychiatric</b> <b>nursing</b> practice, education, research and policy-making based on the data from the study were made to relevant stakeholders. If accepted and implemented {{will go a long way}} in augmenting <b>psychiatric</b> <b>nursing</b> intervention to be holistic wherein <b>psychiatric</b> <b>nursing</b> care will include not only the biological, psychological and social care but also the spiritual care...|$|R
