Particularly, ionic <b>porous</b> <b>polymers</b> obtained by the polymerization of monomeric ILs or copolymerization of ILs with other monomers have been investigated as innovative solid catalysts or catalyst supports [23, 24]. A wide range of ionic <b>porous</b> <b>polymers</b> have been developed and have shown excellent catalytic performances in numerous organic synthetic reactions, among which, the cycloaddition of CO 2 with epoxide is a hot topic [25]. For example, Wang et al. [26] used an ionothermal method to prepare a novel meso-macroporous hierarchical poly(ionic liquid), which was applied as highly efficient heterogeneous catalysts for the conversion of CO 2 into cyclic carbonates at ambient pressure. Zhang et al. prepared imidazolium salt-modified <b>porous</b> hypercross-linked <b>polymers</b> and used them as highly efficient solid catalysts for synergistic CO 2 capture and conversion [27]. However, the present systems still suffer from long reaction time, high CO 2 pressure, or high reaction temperature. Moreover, most of the present ionic <b>porous</b> <b>polymers</b> are based on imidazolium ILs, while the quaternary ammonium salt IL-based ionic <b>porous</b> <b>polymers</b> are scarce, although quaternary ammonium salts have been proved {{to be one of}} the most efficient catalysts for CO 2 fixation.

50|$|SEC is used {{primarily}} {{for the analysis of}} large molecules such as proteins or polymers.

This process is usually performed with a column, which consists of a hollow tube tightly packed with extremely small <b>porous</b> <b>polymer</b> beads designed to have pores of different sizes. These pores may be depressions on the surface or channels through the bead. As the solution travels down the column some particles enter into the pores. Larger particles cannot enter into as many pores. The larger the particles, the faster the elution. The larger molecules simply pass by the pores because those molecules are too large to enter the pores. Larger molecules therefore flow through the column more quickly than smaller molecules, that is, the smaller the molecule, the longer the retention time.|$|E

5000|$|Molecular {{imprinting}} is, in fact, {{making an}} artificial tiny lock {{for a specific}} molecule that serve as miniature key. Like plastic receptors the imprinted polymer grabs specific chemicals. Many basic biological processes, from sensing of odors to signaling between nerve and muscle cells, rely on such lock-and-key combinations. For decades, scientists trying to understand these interactions often play locksmith, searching for the right key to fit a particular receptor. Now, the elegance of molecular imprinting in nature has been spurring many scientists to build the locks themselves. They etch a material to create specific cavities which in size, shape and functional groups, fit the target molecule. However, {{one of the greatest}} advantages of artificial receptors over naturally occurring ones is freedom of molecular design. Their frameworks are never restricted to proteins, and a variety of skeletons (e.g., carbon chains and fused aromatic rings) can be used. Thus, the stability, flexibility, and other properties are freely modulated according to need. Even functional groups that are not found in nature can be employed in these man-made compounds. Furthermore, when necessary, the activity in response towards outer stimuli (photo-irradiation, pH change, electric or magnetic field, and others) can be provided by using appropriate functional groups. The spectrum of functions is far wider than that of naturally occurring ones.In a molecular imprinting processes, one needs a 1) template, 2) functional monomer(s) 3) cross-linker, 4) initiator, 5) porogenic solvent and 6) extraction solvent. According to polymerization method and final polymer format one or some of the reagent can be avoided. There are two main methods for creating these specialized polymers. The first is known as self-assembly, which involves the formation of polymer by combining all elements of the MIP and allowing the molecular interactions to form the cross-linked polymer with the template molecule bound. The second method of formation of MIPs involves covalently linking the imprint molecule to the monomer. After polymerization, the monomer is cleaved from the template molecule. The selectivity is greatly influenced by the kind and amount of cross-linking agent used in the synthesis of the imprinted polymer. The selectivity is also determined by the covalent and non-covalent interactions between the target molecule and monomer functional groups. The careful choice of functional monomer is another important choice to provide complementary interactions with the template and substrates. In an imprinted polymer, the cross-linker fulfills three major functions: First of all, the cross-linker is important in controlling the morphology of the polymer matrix, whether it is gel-type, macroporous or a microgel powder. Secondly, it serves to stabilize the imprinted binding site. Finally, it imparts mechanical stability to the polymer matrix. From a polymerization point of view, high cross-link ratios are generally preferred in order to access permanently porous materials and {{in order to be able}} to generate materials with adequate mechanical stability.The self-assembly method has advantages in the fact that it forms a more natural binding site, and also offers additional flexibility in the types of monomers that can be polymerized. The covalent method has its advantages in generally offering a high yield of homogeneous binding sites, but first requires the synthesis of a derivatized imprint molecule and may not imitate the [...] "natural" [...] conditions that could be present elsewhere.Over the recent years, interest in the technique of molecular imprinting has increased rapidly, both in the academic community and in the industry. Consequently, significant progress has been made in developing polymerization methods that produce adequate MIP formats with rather good binding properties expecting an enhancement in the performance or in order to suit the desirable final application, such as beads, films or nanoparticles. One of the key issues that have limited the performance of MIPs in practical applications so far is the lack of simple and robust methods to synthesize MIPs in the optimum formats required by the application. Chronologically, the first polymerization method encountered for MIP was based on [...] "bulk" [...] or solution polymerization. This method is the most common technique used by groups working on imprinting especially due to its simplicity and versatility. It is used exclusively with organic solvents mainly with low dielectric constant and consists basically of mixing all the components (template, monomer, solvent and initiator) and subsequently polymerizing them. The resultant polymeric block is then pulverized, freed from the template, crushed and sieved to obtain particles of irregular shape and size between 20 and 50 µm.Depending on the target (template) type and the final application of the MIP, MIPs are appeared in different formats such as nano/micro spherical particles, nanowires and thin film or membranes. They are produced with different polymerization techniques like bulk, precipitation, emulsion, suspension, dispersion, gelation, and multi-step swelling polymerization. Most of investigators in the field of MIP are making MIP with heuristic techniques such as hierarchical imprinting method. The technique for the first time was used for making MIP by Sellergren et al. for imprinting small target molecules. With the same concept, Nematollahzadeh et al. developed a general technique, so-called polymerization packed bed, to obtain a hierarchically structured high capacity protein imprinted <b>porous</b> <b>polymer</b> beads by using silica porous particles for protein recognition and capture.|$|E

High energy laser physics utilises low density <b>porous</b> <b>polymers</b> to study astrophysical phenomena at high pressures and temperatures in the form of plasma. Low Z, low density Polymerised High Internal Phase Emulsions (PolyHIPE) and aerogels form a large part of these capabilities, however increasingly stringent laser target parameters are now required to develop new capabilities. For low density <b>porous</b> <b>polymers,</b> this demands greater control over properties such as pore size, density, composition (C[sub]nH[sub](>n)) and homogeneity through novel synthesis and characterisation. Microstructure inhomogeneity of styrene-co-divinyl benzene (S-co-DVB) polyHIPEs in conjunction with novel t-butyl styrene and para divinyl benzene polyHIPEs were investigated using ¹H spin-lattice (T₁) and spin-lock (T[sub](1 ρ)) NMR relaxation experiments using TD-NMR. The strong relationship between ¹H spin-lattice relaxation times and Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA) data, and application of relaxation experiments at varied temperatures reveal that structural inhomogeneity is based on poor emulsion stability and clustering of DVB polymer affecting bulk molecular motion. Divinyl benzene (DVB) aerogels and a range of innovative C[sub]nH[sub](>n) aerogels such as poly- 5 -vinyl- 2 -norbornene were synthesised using free-radical, cationic or ring opening metathesis polymerisation techniques.

40|$|The {{synthesis}} of highly <b>porous</b> organic <b>polymers</b> with predefined porosity has attracted considerable attention {{due to their}} potential {{in a wide range}} of applications. <b>Porous</b> organic <b>polymers</b> (POPs) offer novel properties such as permanent porosity, adjustable chemical nature, and noteworthy thermal and chemical stability. These remarkable properties of the POPs make them promising candidates for use in gas separation and storage. The emission of carbon dioxide (CO 2) from fossil fuel combustion is a major cause of global warming. Finding an efficient separation and/or storage material is essential for creating a cleaner environment. Therefore, the importance of the POPs in the field is undeniable. Along these pursuits, several <b>porous</b> <b>polymers</b> have been synthesized with different specifications. The first class of <b>porous</b> <b>polymers</b> are called Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs). They possess highly ordered structures with very high surface areas and contain light elements. COFs based on B-O, C-N, and B-N bonds have been reported so far. In particular, COFs based on B-O bond formation are well investigated due to the kinetically labile nature of this bond which is essential for overcoming the crystallization problem of covalent networks. Along this line, triptycene-derived covalent organic framework (TDCOF- 5) has been synthesized through a condensation reaction between 1, 4 -benzenediboronic acid and hexahydroxytriptycene which leads to the formation of boronate ester linkage. TDCOF- 5 has the highest H 2 uptake under 1 atm at 77 K (1. 6 %) among all known 2 D and 3 D COFs derived from B–O bond formation and moderate CO 2 uptake (2. 1 mmol g- 1) with Qst values of 6. 6 kJ mol- 1 and 21. 8 kJ mol- 1, respectively. The second class of porous structures discussed herein is diazaborole linked polymers (DBLPs). They are constructed based on B-N bond formation and possess amorphous structures due to the lack of the reversible bond formation processes. At this scope, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 15 -hexaaminotriptycene (HATT) hexahydrocloride was synthesized and reacted with different boronic acid derivatives to produce three different <b>porous</b> <b>polymers</b> under condensation reaction conditions. DBLP- 3, - 4 and - 5 have very high surface areas; 730, 904, and 986 m 2 g- 1, and offer high CO 2 uptake (158. 5, 198, and 171. 5 mg g- 1) at 1 bar and 273 K, respectively. DBLPs have much higher CO 2 uptake capacity when compared to almost all reported B-N and B-O containing <b>porous</b> <b>polymers</b> in the field.
