2500|$|On July 10, 2013, Mexican {{newspaper}} Excélsior ran {{an article}} on its website revealing that the Calderón administration authorized on February 2007 the installation of an interception system by the United States Department of State to analyse, process and store phone calls, e-mails and other internet services {{with the purpose of}} helping Calderón administration to fight organized crime and narcotraffic, {{in the context of the}} Mérida Initiative. The scandal remained largely ignored by the Peña administration even though several newspapers and news websites revealed in September 2013 that the president himself, Enrique Peña Nieto, was spied by the National Security Agency while he was presidential candidate. On 21 October 2013, it was revealed by Der Spiegel that the NSA had spied Calderón and other cabinet member e-mails. That same day Mr. Calderón tweeted that he had personally spoken with the actual Secretary of Foreign Affairs, José Antonio Meade Kuribeña, to [...] "help him" [...] transmit his most energic protest to the espionage he was subject, and later that day, Calderón tweeted that far more of a <b>personal</b> <b>damage,</b> it was a grievance to the Mexican institutions and that he would not make further statements on the theme.|$|E

I will, however, look into it. Meantime, let me advise you to control your enthusiasm. Too much zeal in a subordinate is even more fatal than laxity. For the rest, son, be vigilant--and peaceful. Thou hast meant well, much shall be--forgiven thee. For the present, vamos!" ...|$|E
60|$|The astonishment of the Pickwickians was so absorbing, and the perplexity of Mr. Pickwick was so extreme, {{that they}} might have {{remained}} in exactly the same relative situations until the suspended animation of the lady was restored, {{had it not been for}} a most beautiful and touching expression of filial affection on the part of her youthful son. Clad in a tight suit of corduroy, spangled with brass buttons of a very considerable size, he at first stood at the door astounded and uncertain; but by degrees, the impression that his mother must have suffered some <b>personal</b> <b>damage</b> pervaded his partially developed mind, and considering Mr. Pickwick as the aggressor, he set up an appalling and semi-earthly kind of howling, and butting forward with his head, commenced assailing that immortal gentleman about the back and legs, with such blows and pinches as the strength of his arm, and the violence of his excitement, allowed.|$|E

60|$|It was not acted upon, however, for it {{had hardly}} been broached, when Ned Twigger's wife made her {{appearance}} abruptly {{in the little}} circle before noticed, and Ned no sooner {{caught a glimpse of}} her face and form, than from the mere force of habit he set off towards his home just as fast as his legs could carry him; and that was not very quick in the present instance either, for, however ready they might have been to carry HIM, they couldn't get on very well under the brass armour. So, Mrs. Twigger {{had plenty of time to}} denounce Nicholas Tulrumble to his face: to express her opinion that he was a decided monster; and to intimate that, if her ill-used husband sustained any <b>personal</b> <b>damage</b> from the brass armour, she would have the law of Nicholas Tulrumble for manslaughter. When she had said all this with due vehemence, she posted after Ned, who was dragging himself along as best he could, and deploring his unhappiness in most dismal tones.|$|E
60|$|The news of Mrs. Proudie's {{death had}} {{spread all over}} Barchester {{on the evening of}} its occurrence, and had been {{received}} with that feeling of distant awe which is always accompanied by some degree of pleasurable sensation. There was no one in Barchester to lament a mother, or a sister, or a friend who was really loved. There were those, doubtless, who regretted the woman's death,--and even some who regretted it without any feeling of <b>personal</b> <b>damage</b> done to themselves. There had come to be around Mrs. Proudie a party who thought as she thought on church matters, and such people had lost their head, and thereby their strength. And she had been staunch to her own party, preferring bad tea from a low-church grocer, to good tea from a grocer who went to the ritualistic church or to no church at all. And it is due to her to say that she did not forget those who were true to her,--looking after them mindfully where looking after might be profitable, and fighting their battles where fighting might be more serviceable. I do not think that the appetite for breakfast of any man or woman in Barchester was disturbed by the news of Mrs. Proudie's death, but there were some who felt that a trouble had fallen on them.|$|E

50|$|Intelligence. Good Roman commanders did not {{hesitate}} to exploit useful intelligence, particularly where a siege situation or impending clash in the field was developing. Information was gathered from spies, collaborators, diplomats and envoys, and allies. Intercepted messages during the Second Punic War for example were an intelligence coup for the Romans, and enabled them to dispatch two armies to find and destroy Hasdrubal's Carthaginian force, preventing his reinforcement of Hannibal. Commanders also kept an eye on the situation in Rome since political enemies and rivals could use an unsuccessful campaign to inflict painful career and <b>personal</b> <b>damage.</b> During this initial phase the usual field reconnaissance was also conducted - patrols might be sent out, raids mounted to probe for weaknesses, prisoners snatched, and local inhabitants intimidated.|$|E
50|$|Over {{the last}} {{century and a half}} child sexual abuse has been marked by periods of {{suppression}} and discovery. Child sexual abuse has emerged back into public and professional awareness in the last 30 years, and since then billions of dollars have been spent on efforts toward its prevention and the protection of children from maltreatment. Such efforts are the results of evidence from research and investigation into all aspects of child maltreatment. There has been a need for mental health professionals and child psychiatrists to provide expert knowledge for forensic and legal issues surrounding child maltreatment; this article provides an approach to take for professionals who are called upon to assess the <b>personal</b> <b>damage,</b> long-term harm, and treatment of victims of child maltreatment.|$|E

In September 2011, {{it was reported that}} the Dowler family had been offered £2m in <b>personal</b> <b>damages.</b> In January 2012, it was reported that Surrey Police and other police forces knew soon after Dowler's death that News of the World staff had accessed her mobile phone messages, but did not take issue with this. Instead a senior Surrey officer invited newspaper staff to a meeting to discuss the case.|$|R
50|$|On 24 January 2004, the {{decision}} was overturned by an Employment Appeal Tribunal, which referred the case back to a new tribunal. On 7 October 2004, the new tribunal ruled in Lee's favour, awarding him at least £5,000. Lee also sued for libel after he {{was described as a}} racist, seeking aggravated damages from two senior trade unionists and two journalists. In January 2006, ASLEF paid £30,000 in an out-of-court settlement to cover Lee's legal costs in the libel case, but Lee did not receive any <b>personal</b> <b>damages.</b>|$|R

He then called a press conference {{with representatives of the}} Directors Guild of Japan, the Actors Guild, the Scriptwriters Guild, ATG and the Cine Club.

40|$|In modern {{societies}} individuals often try {{to alleviate}} their <b>personal</b> <b>damages</b> from environmental degradation by increasing their consumption of private goods. Although this “self-protective” behavior is very frequent in industrial economies, insufficient {{attention has been}} paid to its economic and environmental consequences. In this paper we show that such a behavior can make everyone worse-off. For this purpose, using as paradigmatic case a two-islands evolutionary model, we prove analytically that environmental “self-protection” may trap the system into an undesirable (Pareto-dominated) situation and discuss a few real-life examples in which this mechanism may have actually occurred. Although the proposed model is deliberately extremely simple, it may provide some interesting insights on an aspect that has been mainly ignored in the literature so far...|$|R

The data reveal relatively poor levels of physical, psychological, religious and spiritual health.
