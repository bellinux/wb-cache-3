5|$|There were {{plans to}} {{establish}} private operations along the line. Continental Railway Systems {{was established by}} Rasmus Surdal.

5|$|Following its return, Sea Cloud {{received}} a reassembled rigging in 1947, {{and a new}} set of twenty-nine sails in 1949. The vessel was <b>painted</b> <b>white,</b> and a gold eagle painted on the bow. The ship's reconstruction took nearly four years. Marjorie Merriweather Post retained ownership of Sea Cloud in the aftermath of her divorce from Mr. Davies, since she had originally brought the ship into the marriage. After evaluating the cost of running a year-round crew of seventy-two, Marjorie Merriweather Post decided to sell the ship.|$|E

The other route, known as the White Stones Route, originally marked by stones <b>painted</b> <b>white,</b> crosses the fellside at a lower level and fords Helvellyn Gill to join the path from Swirls.|$|E
5|$|Larger ships {{often had}} false bows and sterns painted in a {{different}} shade {{from the rest of}} the hull to create the impression of the ship being at greater range from the observer. German decks were a very dark gray. Smaller ships operating in the North Sea or Baltic Sea were <b>painted</b> <b>white</b> or a very pale gray to blend in with daytime mist and nighttime phosphorescent organisms. As in the First World War, the Germans again employed disguised commerce raiders, Hilfskreuzer such as Atlantis, Thor and Kormoran. These ships were able to modify their appearance to throw off the searching Allied cruisers.|$|E
5|$|Most ancient Egyptians were farmers {{tied to the}} land. Their {{dwellings}} were {{restricted to}} immediate family members, and were constructed of mud-brick designed to remain cool {{in the heat of}} the day. Each home had a kitchen with an open roof, which contained a grindstone for milling grain and a small oven for baking the bread. Walls were <b>painted</b> <b>white</b> and could be covered with dyed linen wall hangings. Floors were covered with reed mats, while wooden stools, beds raised from the floor and individual tables comprised the furniture.|$|E

5|$|The {{roof was}} {{originally}} <b>painted</b> <b>white</b> to aesthetically {{distinguish it from}} both Safeco Field and the nearby industrial area. The {{east side of the}} stadium has a large glass curtain wall that faces the nearby International District. The exterior of the stadium also consists of salmon-colored concrete, and {{the west side of the}} structure is partially clad with red brick. The coloring and facade were designed so the stadium would blend with the older buildings in neighboring Pioneer Square. To reduce costs, the exterior was not completed with brick or ornate steel work.|$|E
5|$|To the {{north-east}} of {{the house}} is the estate's former stable building. This was built {{around the time of the}} fifth Earl's extension {{of the house}} and is aligned on a north-south axis.

The façades are of brick, with the west façade <b>painted</b> <b>white</b> and the east unpainted. The roof is of slate with a clock tower in the centre of the east side of the central pavilion. Close to the stables is an underground brick-built ice house accessed by a vaulted tunnel. The ice house dates from 1788.|$|E
5|$|Sevastopol {{began her}} sea trials on 16 October 1899, and was {{commissioned}} after their conclusion into the Imperial Russian Navy. She {{and her sister}} ships were transferred to Port Arthur, which was then the port of the First Squadron of the Russian Pacific Fleet. In September 1900, Popov radios were installed on Sevastopol and her sister Poltava, the first Russian battleships to have them. They were also <b>painted</b> <b>white,</b> {{the same color as}} the other ships in the First Pacific Squadron. She then left for Port Arthur and arrived at on 13 April 1901. As Russia was not at war with any Far East countries at that time, Sevastopol stayed in port, inactive.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Aerospace <b>white</b> <b>paint</b> has {{excellent}} {{properties and}} can be sprayed in satellite antenna and other large space-craft surfaces, while UV irradiation has important influence on the properties of it. The UV irradiation effect on the elec-trical properties of AEROSPACE <b>white</b> <b>paint</b> is studied firstly in this paper, and then the changing mechanism of it is dis-cussed by the aid of XPS. It was found that ZnO in AEROSPACE <b>white</b> <b>paint</b> decomposes in ultraviolet irradiation {{and the color of}} AEROSPACE <b>white</b> <b>paint</b> turns to light yellow. The surface resistivity of AEROSPACE <b>white</b> <b>paint</b> de-creases with near ultraviolet irradiation, and has back effect in some extent when it returns to atmosphere. Decomposition of ZnO, decrease of adsorbed to Oxygen and increase of oxygen vacancy are the origin of decrease of surface resistivity of AEROSPACE <b>white</b> <b>paint</b> under near ultraviolet radiatio...|$|R
