2500|$|The other {{change in}} 1970 was {{the switch to}} the [...] "dog-leg" [...] heads. These heads flow 20% better on the exhaust side than the 1966-'69 {{rectangle}} port heads and are thus the best for performance. There are two reasons for the flow increase: First, {{the area of the}} port is larger, due to the dog leg. Second, the shape of the <b>port</b> <b>floor</b> was changed from a concave to a convex curve. The concave floor tended to bend the exhaust flow upwards which caused turbulence when the flow was forced to go down into the exhaust manifolds. By switching to a convex floor the curvature of the flow starts in the head and proceeds much more smoothly into the exhaust manifold resulting in less turbulence and better flow.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe final {{scientific}} {{design for}} an upgraded neutron radiography/tomography facility at beam port no. 2 of the SAFARI- 1 nuclear research reactor has been performed through expert advice from Physics Consulting, FRMII in Germany and IPEN, Brazil. A need {{to upgrade the}} facility became apparent due to the identification of various deficiencies of the current SANRAD facility during an IAEA-sponsored expert mission of international scientists to Necsa, South Africa. A lack of adequate shielding that results in high neutron background on the beam <b>port</b> <b>floor,</b> a mismatch in the collimator aperture to the core that results in a high gradient in neutron flux on the imaging plane and due to a relative low L/D {{the quality of the}} radiographs are poor, are a number of deficiencies to name a few. The new design, based on results of Monte Carlo (MCNP-X) simulations of neutron- and gamma transport from the reactor core and through the new facility, is being outlined. The scientific design philosophy, neutron optics and imaging capabilities that include the utilization of fission neutrons, thermal neutrons, and gamma-rays emerging from the core of SAFARI- 1 are discussed...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA common {{denominator}} of all neutron radiography (NRAD) facilities worldwide {{is that the}} perimeter of the experimental chamber of the facility is a radiation shielding structure which,in some cases, also includes flight tube and filter chamber structures. These chambers are normally both located on the beam <b>port</b> <b>floor</b> outside the biological shielding of the neutron source. The main function of the NRAD-shielding structure isto maintain a radiological safe working environment in the entire beam hall according to standards set by individual national radiological safety regulations. In addition, the shielding's integrity and capability should not allow, during NRAD operations, an increase in radiation levels in the beam port hall and thus negatively affectadjacent scientific facilities (e. g. neutron diffraction facilities). As a bonus, the shielding for the NRAD facility should also prevent radiation scattering towards the detector plane and doing so, thus increase thecapability of obtaining better quantitative results. This paper addresses Monte Carlo neutron-particletransport simulations to theoretically optimize the shielding capabilities of the biological barrierfor the SANRAD facility at the SAFARI- 1 nuclear research reactor in South Africa. The experimental process to develop the shielding, based on the principles of the ANTARES facility, is described. After casting, the homogeneity distribution of these concrete mix materials is found to be near perfect and first order experimental radiation shielding characteristicsthrough film badge (TLD) exposure show acceptable values and trends in neutron- and gamma-ray attenuation...|$|E
50|$|Killing Floor was {{originally}} a total conversion mod {{for the game}} Unreal Tournament 2004, first released in 2005. The lead developer Alex Quick was first approached by Tripwire Interactive about <b>porting</b> Killing <b>Floor</b> to their game Red Orchestra: Ostfront 41-45, but Quick did not follow through. A few years later, when their user base started to dwindle, Quick contacted Tripwire again to negotiate the port to Red Orchestra, and its distribution via Steam—similar to what Tripwire had already done with another Red Orchestra mod Mare Nostrum—and then later, the retail game. The mod version had its fifth and final official update in July 2008.|$|R
50|$|Fort Henning, {{as well as}} Forts Blair and Insley, was {{surrounded}} by log palisades covered on the outside by earthworks, which were surrounded by wide, deep ditches. The blockhouse itself was constructed of rough wood planks and had a shingle roof. It stood two stories tall and had <b>ports</b> on both <b>floors</b> to allow cannon or rifles to be shot at anyone who dared attack it or Fort Scott.|$|R
40|$|Shutdown {{dose rate}} {{calculations}} {{have been performed}} on an integrated ITER C-lite neutronics model with equatorial port 10. A ‘fully shielded’ configuration, optimised for a given set of diagnostic designs (i. e. shielding in all available space within the port plug drawers), results in a shutdown dose rate in the port interspace, from the activation of materials comprising equatorial port 10, in excess of 2000 μSv/h. Achieving dose rates of 100 μSv/h or less, as required in areas where hands-on maintenance can be performed, in the port interspace region will be challenging. A combination of methods {{will need to be}} implemented, such as reducing mass and/or the use of reduced activation steel in the port interspace, optimisation of the diagnostic designs and shielding of the <b>port</b> interspace <b>floor.</b> Further analysis is required to test these options and the ongoing design optimisation of the EP 10 diagnostic systems...|$|R
40|$|The {{designing}} of Space Shuttle modules {{and equipment}} {{in order to}} provide a stimulating and efficient work atmosphere and a pleasant living environment is examined. The habitation module for the eight crew members is divided into four areas: ceiling, <b>floor,</b> <b>port,</b> and starboard. The module is to consist of crew quarters, a wardroom, a galley, a personal hygiene facility, a health maintenance facility, and stowage areas. There is a correlation between the function of the module and its location; for example the galley will be near the wardroom and the personal hygiene facility near the crew quarters. The designs of the equipment for crew accommodation and of the equipment to be maintained and repaired by the crew will be standarized. The design and functions of the crew and equipment restraints, crew mobility aids, racks to contain equipment, and functional units are described...|$|R
50|$|<b>Port</b> Talbot sea <b>floor</b> {{topography}} {{ranges from}} 0m to 15m within Swansea Bay. There are many patches within the bay including the North Kenfig patches, green grounds, outer green grounds, madjoe and stalheim. These patches are created from faults, hollows, general topography and other factors. Sea depth around Port Talbot is 10m-50m with increasing depth with increasing {{distance from the}} coast. There are two beaches within Port Talbot: Aberafan and Morfa. Sand at both beaches are yellow and semi-shell rich. Tide in the area has a harmonic prediction which means it can be predicted easy and has repeatable tide heights every year. The outer bay area and sea area near Port Talbot Pier has a tidal stream with no harmonic prediction. A tidal stream (or tidal current) is an alternating horizontal movement of water associated with {{the rise and fall}} of the tide caused by tide-producing forces. This means that the tide can not be accurately predicted due to additional factors like currents, rip current, river mouths and precipitation. There are also two major dumping grounds within the bay. These are areas were sand is collected for construction industry. Port Talbot docks is a deep water harbour which allows large cargo shape to dock into the area.|$|R
