40|$|Radioreceptor binding {{studies were}} {{designed}} to localize and {{determine the number of}} α and β-adrenergic receptors in the mammary gland of lactating cows. 3 H-prazosin, 3 H-rauwolscine and 3 H-dihydroalprenolol were used for the regional characterization of α 1, α 2 - and β-adrenergic receptors by competitive inhibition of binding of 3 H-ligands with unlabelled adrenergic agonists and antagonists. The α 1 -, α 2 - and β 2 -adrenergic receptor subtypes could thus be demonstrated in the regions of the teats, large mammary ducts and parenchyma. Tissues of the teat wall, of the large mammary ducts above the gland cistern and of the mammary parenchyma were prepared to determine the density of α 1, α 2 - and β-receptors by saturation binding assays using 3 H-prazosin, 3 H-rauwolscine and 3 H-dihydroalprenolol respectively. Binding to high affinity sites was reversible within minutes and saturable. Equilibrium was reached within minutes. The number of α 1 -and α 2 -adrenergic receptors decreased from the teat to the mammary ducts to the parenchyma. Most of the α 1 - and α 2 -adrenergic receptors were found in the teat wall, whereas in the parenchyma α-adrenergic receptors were absent or barely detectable. The density of β-adrenergic receptors was similar in the teat wall and the large mammary ducts, but much lower in the parenchyma. Thus, α 1, α 2 - and β-adrenergic receptors were found mainly in the milk <b>purging</b> <b>system</b> and hardly at all in mammary parenchyma. Inhibition of milk removal by α-adrenergic stimulation is possibly due to constriction of teat wall and to constriction of the mammary ducts, whereas enhanced milk flow after β-adrenergic stimulation is possibly due to relaxation not only of the teat sphincter and teat wall, but probably also of the large mammary duct...|$|E
40|$|Black liquor {{gasification}} at {{high temperature}} is a promising {{alternative to the}} conventional recovery boiler process used in chemical pulping today. In the black liquor gasification process black liquor is atomised by a gas- assisted nozzle and sprayed into a reactor where it is directly gasified by an reaction with oxygen steam and carbon dioxide. A proper atomisation of black liquor {{is very important for}} the performance of the black liquor gasification process. The work presented in this report was performed to gain understanding and aid in optimisation of the atomisation process in the current black liquor gasification process. The method used was spray visualisations by shadowgraphy using intensive lighting and high speed photography. The experiments were carried out in the spray test rig at the Energy Technology Centre (ETC) in Piteå and performed at elevated ambient pressures and different operational conditions. The first part of the work was to improve the current spray test rig at ETC considering the window <b>purging</b> <b>system</b> to avoid droplets on the sight windows, the nitrogen delivering system used for atomisation and a black liquor heating and delivering system. The final setup of the spray test rig made it possible to keep the optical access windows clean, control the temperature of the atomisation gas and pump and heat the black liquor up to 115 °C. The second part of the current work was to perform visualisations of the black liquor atomisation process in the improved spray test rig. Variables like fluid temperatures, ambient pressure, nitrogen gas flow and black liquor flow were changed in order to see how these influence the gas- assisted atomisation process of black liquor. The nozzle used in this work was a standard coaxial gas-assisted nozzle, which is not an optimised nozzle for the black liquor gasification process. The visualisations of the resulting sprays from the current nozzle showed that black liquor does not behave like water when it is atomised. The black liquor mainly form thin ligament-shaped droplets and not spherical droplets. Based on the few result with varying black liquor temperature and dry solids content, the qualitative results showed only minor dependence from these variables in the atomisation process. Under the influence of elevated ambient pressure the black liquor spray looks more like a dense cloud of small droplets than larger more coarsely distributed droplets found in the atmospheric case.

40|$|Advances in FTIR photoacoustic (PA) {{spectroscopy}} {{have significantly}} extended {{the scope and}} utility of the PA technique in the areas of: microparticle spectroscopy, compositional determinations via factor analysis, coal surface oxidation measurements, spectroscopy of highly opaque samples, and PA detector technology. A method is reported for measuring FTIR spectra of single particles {{in the tens of}} Am size range which uses a tungsten needle to pick up particles and hold them in the sample chamber of the PA detector. The tungsten needle is initially mounted on a micromanipulator and particle pick-up is performed under a microscope. The needle and sample are then transferred directly to the PA detector sample holder which positions the particle in the IR beam. No sample alignment or thinning are necessary. Compositional determinations of kaolinite and quartz in coal have been performed using the Perkin-Elmer CIRCOM factor analysis program. The IR spectra were collected by DRIFTS and PA methods using synthesized samples of known compositions for the learning set and unknown test samples. The PA spectra yielded slightly better correlations. Coal surface oxidation was studied using a calibrated UV irradiation of coal to generate carbonyl species, thereby gauging the freshness of coal surfaces by how much carbonyl is formed by the UV exposure. FT-IR-PA difference spectra are used to measure the increase in carbonyl. UV generated carbonyl is found to increase with surface freshness. This method avoids the need of a 2 ̆ 2 fresh coal standard 2 ̆ 2 which is difficult to reproduce. The method 2 ̆ 7 s probe depth is based on the decay length of UV rather than IR photons in coal resulting in an increase in surface specificity. The linearity of FT-IR-PA spectra as a function of absorbance has traditionally not been maintained at the peaks of strong bands in opaque samples. This leads to peak truncation and reduced spectral contrast. A method to extend linearity using the magnitude and phase information of the PA signal is reported based on the Rosencwaig-Gersho Theory of PA signal generations. Spectra of polymer slabs demonstrate the utility of this approach for enhancing spectral contrast. Developments are reported in PA detector technology which increase the scope of applications that commercial PA detectors can be used for. The new MTEC Photoacoustics Model 200 PA detector operates in diffuse reflectance, photoacoustic, and transmission measuring modes and handles both macro- and microsamples. The Model 200 has a simplified <b>purging</b> <b>system</b> and electronics designed for both fast scan and step scan FT-IR instruments.

40|$|Spectral Library: The Berlin Emissivity Database (BED) is a {{spectral}} library {{containing the}} emissivity measurements of several planetary analogues. It contains currently entries for plagioclase and potassium feldspars, low Ca and high Ca pyroxenes, olivines, elemental sulphur, common martian analogues (JSC Mars- 1, Salten Skov, palagonites, montmorillonite, hematite, goethite) and a lunar highland soil sample {{measured in the}} wavelength range from 3 to 50 µm {{as a function of}} particle size. For each sample, the spectra of four well defined particle size separates (< 25 µm, 25 - 63 µm, 63 - 125 µm, 125 - 250 µm) are measured with a 4 cm- 1 spectral resolution. These size separates have been selected as typical representations for most of the planetary surfaces [1]. Laboratory set-up: The instrumentation is located in the Planetary Emissivity Laboratory (PEL) at the Institute for Planetary Research (PF) of the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in Berlin, Germany. It consists of a spectrometer attached to an external emissivity device. The Bruker VERTEX 80 v spectrometer, has a very high spectral resolution (better then 0. 2 cm- 1), and a resolving power of better than 300, 000 : 1, and can be operated under vacuum conditions. To cover the entire 1 to 50 µm spectral range, two detectors, a liquid nitrogen cooled MTC and a room temperature DTGS and two beamsplitter, a KBr and a Multilayer are used to measure the same target. The emissivity device is composed of the sample chamber, a double-walled box with three apertures: a 15 cm squared door used to insert the cup in the box, a 5 cm rounded opening through which the beam is directed to the spectrometer and a 5 cm opening facing the attached blackbody unit. A heater is placed in the chamber and is used to heat the cup with samples from the bottom. The thermal radiation emitted normal to the surface by the sample or the blackbody is collected by an Aucoated parabolic off-axis mirror and reflected to the entrance port of the spectrometer. Figure 1 shows the emissivity device attached to the spectrometer external port: the sample chamber is opened to show the parabolic mirror mounted on a mechanical arm and oriented toward the reference blackbody, the sample heater and the <b>purging</b> <b>system.</b> A pump circulates water at a constant temperature in the volume between the inner and outer walls of the chamber. The surfaces of the box are painted with black high emissivity paint. The chamber is purged with dry air to remove particulates, water vapour and CO 2. Further details can be found in [2, 3]. Emissivity spectra: In Figure 2 an example of quartz measurements for two extreme grain sizes is shown, together with analogue measurements extracted from the ASU and ASTER spectral libraries. Complementary to the existing datasets (ASU and ASTER), the BED library sensibly extend both the investigated spectral range and the grain size ranges. The enormous difference between the spectra of the small and large fractions witness the need for such a complete dataset for a correct interpretation of remote sensing data. Martian analogues: The emission spectra of standard martian analogue materials like the JSC Mars- 1 (a palagonitic tephra from Hawaii, USA), the Salten Skov (a Fe-oxide precipitate from the Midjutland region of Denmark), montmorillonite, hematite, goethite and some palagonites from Hawaii, USA, are shown and discussed in this paper.

40|$|The {{lithium lens}} in the {{antiproton}} source target vault {{is protected by}} an interlock system, which is located in relay racks R 5 and R 6 near {{the southwest corner of}} the Target Hall (building APO). The interlock system consists of crates of commercial signal conditioner and alarm modules built by Acromag, Inc and interlock Master Modules built by Fermilab: Twenty analog signals from the lens/transformer, power supply, and cooling water system are buffered with signal conditioners (amplifiers), which are located in creates R 5 C and R 5 E. The signals and conditioner assignments are listed in Table 1. Interconnection details are shown in Figure 1. Thermocouple signals come into the conditioners directly from the vault or water system via 12 -pair multiconductor thermocouple extension cables. All other signals pass through a master connection panel on the east end of rack R 6. Water flow signals are AC voltages which must be converted by electronics in crate D 2 B to DC voltages before entering their signal conditioners. Each conditioner drives two parallel outputs. One output goes to a Multiplexed Analog to Digital Converter (MADC 25), which is located in R 5 D. This voltage output is read by the accelerator control network (ACNET) and can be displayed at any control console on parameter page P 46. The other voltage output is connected to an alarm module. Thirteen analog signals are processed by alarm modules, which are located in crates R 6 B and R 6 C. Alarm connection details are shown in Figure 2. Each alarm module contains two DPDT relays, one for an upper limit and one for a lower limit. The relays are latching, so that once an input has passed outside a limit, that limit relay remains in the tripped condition until an operator issues a reset pulse. The reset may be generated locally with a pushbutton on the appropriate interlock master module or remotely from controls parameter page P 46 via ACNET. Alarm settings are summarized in engineering units in Table 1, and actual comparitor voltage settings are listed in Figure 2. Each alarm crate contains 10 module slots and is wired as shown in Figure 3, except for the water conductivity slot, which is wired to a separate interlock chain output. Normally open contacts are used for interlock chains, while normally closed contacts provide status bits. The interlock chain outputs are connected to Interlock Master Modules located in D 5 C. Status bits are read into ACNET through a multiplexer in R 4 A, and can be displayed on parameter page S 40. Any alarm slot may be bypassed by inserting a 'dummy' printed circuit card in place of a module. Each interlock master module sums 5 inputs and provides 3 reed relay contact closure outputs. A circuit schematic is shown in Figure 4. Input 1 requires + 5 volts, and directly energizes an interlock chain relay. Input 2 and 3 require TTL logic levels, and inputs 4 and 5 require and external contact closure. Internal switches select which inputs are active Interlock master interconnections are shown in Figure 5. The lens uses two masters, one for water conductivity and the other for all interlocked conditions. The Conductivity Master controls the lens water <b>purging</b> <b>system</b> and also energizes one input of the General Master. The General Master provides the external interlock for the pulsed power supply. If lithium comes into contact with the cooling water, the conductivity master will trip. Output 2 of the Master shuts off the water circulating pump and initiates purging hardware, which isolates the lens from the water supply and allows inert gas to force remaining water from the lens into a reservoir located in the vault. Output 1 of the Master, which is connected to input 4 of the lens General Master, causes the General Master to trip and disable the pulsed power supply. All other lens alarm conditions (except conductivity) enter input 1 and 2 of the Lens General Master. An alarm condition from these inputs will disable the pulsed power supply, but the water system will remain on. Each interlock master has a manual Emergency Stop pushbutton (red) on its front panel. The pushbutton has alternating action, one push enabling the interlock master, the next push opening the interlock chain. all interlock masters are connected to an audible trip alarm module located in R 5 E- 6...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Since 1980 s, the author’s {{impeller}} pump has successively achieved the device implantability, blood compatibility and flow pulsatility. In order to realize a performance durability, {{the author has}} concentrated in past years on solving the bearing problems of the {{impeller pump}}. Recent progress has been obtained in developing durable and permanent impeller blood pumps. At first, a durable impeller pump with rolling bearing and <b>purge</b> <b>system</b> has been developed, in which the wear-less rollers made of super-high-molecular weight polythene make the pump to work for years without mechanical wear; and the <b>purge</b> <b>system</b> enables the bearing to work in saline and heparin, and no thrombus therefore could be formed. Secondly, a durable centrifugal pump with rolling bearing and axially reciprocating impeller has been developed, the axial reciprocation of rotating impeller makes the fresh blood {{in and out of}} the bearing and to wash the rollers once a circle; in such way, no thrombus could be formed and no fluid infusion is necessary, which may bring inconvenience and discomfort to the receptors. Finally, a permanent maglev impeller pump has been developed, its rotor is suspended and floating in the blood under the action of permanent magnetic force and nonmagnetic forces, without need for position measurement and feed-back control. In conclusion, an implantable, pulsatile, and blood compatible impeller pump with durability may have more extensive applications than ever before and could replace the donor heart for transplantation in the future.
