5000|$|WOLF Performance Primers: WOLF {{makes its}} own <b>primers</b> for <b>loading</b> or {{reloading}} centerfire cartridges.|$|R
5000|$|In the TC {{reaction}} chamber, dye-terminator sequencing reagent, template DNA, and <b>primers</b> are <b>loaded</b> {{into the}} TC chamber and thermal-cycled for 35 cycles ( [...] at 95 °C for 12 seconds and at 60 °C for 55 seconds).|$|R
50|$|In the 1860s the Swedish and Norwegian armies {{realized}} that their standard rifles, both percussion lock breech-loading rifles and muzzle loaders, were rapidly becoming obsolete {{in the face}} of the new metal cartridge combining bullet, <b>primer</b> and propellant <b>load.</b> In early October 1866, a joint Swedish-Norwegian arms commission was established in order to select a suitable cartridge and rifle for the two nations.|$|R
50|$|The AP9 is a self-loading pistol {{using the}} {{blowback}} mechanism with a double-action trigger, has a rotating safety/decocking lever {{on the left}} side of the slide, and is equipped with a firing pin safety mechanism, which prevents the firing pin from striking the <b>primer</b> of a <b>loaded</b> cartridge, unless the trigger is pulled. Field-stripping the pistol for cleaning is accomplished identically to the Walther PP pistol.|$|R
30|$|It is {{pertinent}} to note that, despite repeated attempts the ~ 408  bp amplicon within the S ORF {{could not be}} amplified in 8 (53.3 %) of the 15 HBsAg positive samples. This {{could be due to}} low viral <b>load,</b> <b>primer</b> mismatch as a result of point mutations or virus strains being of recombinant origin. However, effort is underway to further characterize the isolates using sequence independent strategies.|$|R
50|$|Rheinmetall {{designed}} the 155 mm 52-calibre JBMOU compliant gun, which is chromium-lined for its entire 8 metre length {{and includes a}} muzzle brake on the end. The gun uses a new modular charge system with six charges (five identical), which can be combined to provide the optimal total charge for the range to the target, {{as well as the}} conventional bagged charge systems. <b>Primer</b> is <b>loaded</b> separately via a conveyor belt, and the entire loading, laying and clearing is completely automated. The maximum range of the gun is 30 km with the standard L15A2 round (a UK design for FH-70 and stockpiled by Germany for M109G and FH70), about 35 km with base bleed rounds, and at least 40 km with assisted projectiles. In April 2006 a PzH 2000 shot assisted shells (Denel V-Lap) over a distance of 56 km with a probable maximum range of over 60 km. The gun can also fire the SMArt 155 artillery round, which is used by Germany and Greece.|$|R
40|$|Replication factor C (RF-C) complex binds to DNA <b>primers</b> and <b>loads</b> PCNA onto DNA, thereby {{increasing}} the processivity of DNA polymerases. We have previously identified a distinct region, domain B, {{in the large}} subunit of human RF-C (RF-Cp 145) which binds to PCNA. We show here that the functional interaction of RF-Cp 145 with PCNA is regulated by cdk-cyclin kinases. Phosphorylation of either RF-Cp 145 {{as a part of}} the RF-C complex or RF-Cp 145 domain B by cdk-cyclin kinases inhibits their ability to bind PCNA. A cdk-cyclin phosphorylation site, Thr 506 in RF-Cp 145, identified by mass spectrometry, is also phosphorylated in vivo. A Thr 506 →Ala RF-Cp 145 domain B mutant is a poor in vitro substrate for cdk-cyclin kinase and, consequently, the ability of this mutant to bind PCNA was not suppressed by phosphorylation. By generating an antibody directed against phospho-Thr 506 in RF-Cp 145, we demonstrate that phosphorylation of endogenous RF-Cp 145 at Thr 506 is mediated by CDKs since it is abolished by treatment of cells with the cdk-cyclin inhibitor roscovitine. We have thus mapped an in vivo cdk-cyclin phosphorylation site within the PCNA binding domain of RF-Cp 145...|$|R
40|$|Traditionally many {{structural}} alloys {{are protected}} by <b>primer</b> coatings <b>loaded</b> with corrosion inhibiting additives. Strontium Chromate (or other chromates) {{have been shown to}} be extremely effectively inhibitors, and find extensive use in protective primer formulations. Unfortunately, hexavalent chromium which imbues these coatings with their corrosion inhibiting properties is also highly toxic, and their use is being increasingly restricted by legislation. In this work we explore a novel tridimensional Quantitative-Structure Property Relationship (3 D-QSPR) approach, comparative molecular surface analysis (CoMSA), which was developed to recognize "high-performing" corrosion inhibitor candidates from the distributions of electronegativity, polarizability and van der Waals volume on the molecular surfaces of 28 small organic molecules. Multivariate statistical analysis identified five prototypes molecules, which are capable of explaining 71 % of the variance within the inhibitor data set; whilst a further five molecules were also identified as archetypes, describing 75 % of data variance. All active corrosion inhibitors, at a 80 % threshold, were successfully recognized by the CoMSA model with adequate specificity and precision higher than 70 % and 60 %, respectively. The model was also capable of identifying structural patterns, that revealed reasonable starting points for where structural changes may augment corrosion inhibition efficacy. The presented methodology can be applied to other functional molecules and extended to cover structure-activity studies in a diverse range of areas such as drug design and novel material discovery...|$|R
40|$|Four cats (24 %) {{experimentally}} {{infected with}} FIV unexpectedly developed neoplastic changes within {{four months of}} inoculation. While FIV has previously been associated with neoplasia, the rapidity and high attack rate seen here is highly unusual. PCR for antigen receptor rearrangements (PARR) detected clonally rearranged T cells in two animals diagnosed with B cell follicular lymphoma by classical means. All cats were negative for feline leukemia virus; gamma-herpesvirus DNA was not amplified using degenerate <b>primers.</b> FIV proviral <b>load</b> in neoplastic tissue was two orders of magnitude lower than in the periphery, lower in neoplastic vs non-neoplastic lymph node, and clonal integration was not detected. We hypothesize that neoplasia was secondary to FIV immune dysregulation, and show that PARR can augment our capacity to phenotype these tumors and distinguish follicular hyperplasia from lymphoma. Age of exposure and relative virulence of the inoculum likely contributed to this unusual presentation of FIV infection...|$|R
2500|$|In {{the scene}} in which Lee was accidentally shot, Lee's {{character}} walks into his apartment and discovers his fiancée being beaten and raped by thugs. Actor Michael Massee's character fires a [...]44 Magnum revolver at Lee as he walks into the room. A previous scene using the same gun had called for inert dummy cartridges fitted with bullets (but no powder or <b>primer)</b> to be <b>loaded</b> in the revolver for a close-up scene; for film scenes that utilize a revolver (where the bullets are visible from the front) and do not require the gun to actually be fired, dummy cartridges provide the realistic appearance of actual rounds. Instead of purchasing commercial dummy cartridges, the film's prop crew created their own by pulling the bullets from live rounds, dumping the powder charge then reinserting the bullets. However, they unknowingly or unintentionally left the live primer {{in place at the}} rear of the cartridge. At some point during filming, the revolver was apparently discharged with one of these improperly-deactivated cartridges in the chamber, setting off the primer with enough force to drive the bullet partway into the barrel, where it became stuck (a condition known as a squib load). The prop crew either failed to notice this or failed to recognize the significance of this issue.|$|R

50|$|Handloading {{cost for}} the 6.5 Creedmoor is roughly {{equivalent}} to other 6.5mm cartridges, such as the 6.5×47, due to the availability of Lapua small primer brass for both cartridges. Norma now makes brass for the cartridge and as of 2017 Norma brass is available through several major retailers at approximately the same cost as Lapua brass. Lapua brass for 6.5×47 lasts about 12 to 20 reloads. When the 6.5 CM was first introduced it was advertised as a 60,000 psi capable case. However, when it was placed into production Hornady listed it as 62,000 psi and had it SAAMI registered as such. For this reason many hand loaders have had poor experiences reloading for it. Blown primers on the first shot at 62,000 psi is not uncommon. Early shooting articles listed the ammo as loaded to 58,000 psi but later ones list it as 57,000 psi. This is because Hornady reduced the loads in its factory ammo because of complaints that it was often blowing primers. Lapua delivered Creedmoor brass at Shot show 2017, and production quantities became available via major retailers in second quarter 2017. The Lapua version has a small <b>primer</b> pocket. Thus, <b>loads</b> from a Lapua Creedmoor {{should not be used}} in another manufacturer's Creedmoor brass that features a large primer pocket without applying proper hand loading test for pressure first. Also the use of a smaller diameter decapping rod is required to size and decap.|$|R
