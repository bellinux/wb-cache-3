Radio waves have frequencies as high as 300 GHz to as low as 3 kHz, though some definitions describe waves above 1 or 3 GHz as microwaves, or include waves of any lower frequency. At 300 GHz, the corresponding wavelength is 1 mm (0.039 in), and at 3 kHz is 100 km (62 mi). Like all other electromagnetic waves, they travel {{at the speed of}} light.

40|$|KERENA™ (SWR 1000) is an {{innovative}} {{boiling water reactor}} concept with passive safety systems. In order to verify the functionality of the passive components requiredfor the transient and accident management, the test facility INKA (Integral-Versuchstand Karlstein) is build in Karlstein (Germany). The key elements of the KERENA™ passive safety concept -the Emergency Condenser, the Containment Cooling Condenser, the Passive Core Flooding System and the Passive Pressure <b>Pulse</b> <b>Transmitter</b> - will be tested at INKA. The Emergency Condenser system transfer heaty form the reactor pressure vessel to the core flooding pools of the containment. The heat introduced into the containment during accidents will {{be transferred to the}} main heat sink for passive accident management (Shielding/Storage Pool) via the Containment Cooling Condensers. Therefore both systems are part of the passive cooling chain connecting the heat source RPV (Reactor Pressure Vessel) with the heat sink. At the INKA test facility both condensers are tested in full scale setup, {{in order to determine the}} heat transfer capacity as function of the main input parameters. For the EC these are the RPV pressure, the RPV water level, the containment pressure and the water temperature of the flooding pools.

40|$|A {{hand-held}} Garmin eTrex Venture Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver {{operated in}} autonomous mode {{was used to}} investigate the accuracy of autonomous GPS in measuring ground speed. The accuracy of GPS-derived ground speed was tested by collecting and storing in a laptop computer, every 10 sec, ground speed data from the receiver at eight different ground speeds of a vehicle. The targeted ground speeds involved were 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40 and 50 km h- 1. The vehicle`s speedometer {{was used as an}} initial indicator of the ground speed. A <b>pulse</b> <b>transmitter</b> was utilized to detect the frequency, for every 10 sec, of a magnet fixed on one of the vehicle`s wheels and passing by the transmitter every full rotation of the wheel. Data from the <b>pulse</b> <b>transmitter</b> was acquired and stored in a data logger. Given that the wheel`s circumference was known, frequencies were used to calculate the ground speeds which were used as a reference. By the use of matching times of GPS and data logger data records, GPS-derived ground speeds were compared against the reference speed measurements. For nearly 600 data points comprising the data set for the eight test ground speeds, {{it was found that the}} error in GPS-derived ground speeds was, on the average, 1. 27 km h- 1 (less than 7 %.) However, high fluctuations in vehicle`s ground speed when, for example, turning greatly impacted this error. An error of - 80. 16 % was produced due to a drop of vehicle`s ground speed from 18. 65 to 11. 19 km h- 1. Results of steady state ground speed analysis revealed that the average error was less than 1 km h- 1 (less than 5. 3 %), except for the 15 km h- 1 data set where the average error reached 1. 72 km h- 1 (9. 92 %. ...|$|E

40|$|Since the Federal Communication Commission {{released}} the unlicensed 3. 1 - 10. 6 GHz frequency band for commercial use in early 2002, the ultra wideband (UWB) has developed from an emerging technology into a mainstream research area. The UWB technology, which utilizes wide spectrum, opens {{a new era}} of possibility for practical applications in radar sensing, one of which is the human vital sign monitoring. The aim of this thesis is to study and research the possibility of a new generation humanrespiration monitoring sensor using UWB radar technology and to develop a new prototype of UWB radar sensor for system-on-chip solutions in CMOS technology. In this thesis, a lowpower Gaussian impulse UWB mono-static radar transceiver architecture is presented. The UWB Gaussian <b>pulse</b> <b>transmitter</b> and receiver are implemented and fabricated using 90 nm CMOS technology. Since the energy of low order Gaussian pulse is mostly condensed at lower frequency, in order to transmit the pulse in a very efficient way, higher order Gaussian derivative pulses are desired as the baseband signal. This motivates the advancement of the design into UWB high-order <b>pulse</b> <b>transmitter.</b> Both the Gaussian impulse UWB transmitter and Gaussian higher-order impulse UWB transmitter take the low-power and high-speed advantage of digital circuit to generate different waveforms. The measurement results are analyzed and discussed. This thesis also presents a low-power UWB mono-static radar transceiver architecture exploiting the full benefit of UWB bandwidth in radar sensing applications. The transceiver includes a full UWB band transmitter, an UWB receiver front-end, and an on-chip diplexer. The non-coherent UWB transmitter generates pulse modulated baseband signals at different carrier frequencies within the designated 3 - 10 GHz band using a digitally controlled pulse generator. The test shows the proposed radar transceiver can detect the human respiration pattern within 50 cm distance. The applications of this UWB radar sensing solution in commercialized standard CMOS technology include constant breathing pattern monitoring for gated radiation therapy, realtime monitoring of patients, and any other breathing monitoring.
