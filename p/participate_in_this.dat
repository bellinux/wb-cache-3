5|$|Przemysł II didn't <b>participate</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> {{expedition}} (at least directly, {{according to}} Jan Długosz), {{because at that}} moment he was in Ląd, according to a document dated 24 August 1278. Certainly by the command of his uncle, Przemysł II acted as mediator in the dispute between Dukes Leszek II the Black and Ziemomysł of Inowrocław and his subjects.|$|E
5|$|The United Front {{ministry}} {{ordered the}} creation of the Bangla Academy to promote, develop, and preserve Bengali language, literature, and heritage. However, the United Front rule was temporary, as Governor General Ghulam Muhammad cancelled the government and started Governor's rule on 30 May 1954. the United Front again formed the ministry on 6 June 1955 after the governor's regime ended. The Awami League did not <b>participate</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> ministry though.|$|E
5|$|The third {{industrial}} revolution is spreading from {{the developed world}} to some, but not all, parts of the developing world.

To be such bases, developing countries must provide relatively well-educated workforces, good infrastructure (electricity, telecommunications, transportation), political stability, and a willingness to play by market rules.|$|E

5|$|Of the British rear ships, {{only two}} made a {{determined}} effort {{to break the}} French line. Admiral Hood's flagship HMS Royal George pierced it between Républicain and Sans Pareil, engaging both closely, while HMS Glory came through the line behind Sans Pareil and threw herself into the melee as well. The rest of the British and French rearguard did not <b>participate</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> close combat; HMS Montagu fought a long range gunnery duel with Neptune which damaged neither ship severely, although the British captain James Montagu {{was killed in the}} opening exchanges, command devolving to Lieutenant Ross Donnelly. Next in line, HMS Ramillies ignored her opponent completely and sailed west, Captain Henry Harvey seeking Brunswick, his brother's ship, in the confused action around Queen Charlotte.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} made a stop-over at Namsos, where sixteen of {{the passengers}} disembarked. This {{reduced the number of}} passengers on board to thirty-three, but the passenger occupying the jump seat continued to sit there on the next leg. The captain was the flying pilot for the segment. The aircraft departed Namsos at 20:07 and contacted Trondheim Air Traffic Control Center (ATCC) at 20:13 to receive permission to ascend to flight level 90 (FL 90), which was received. During the flight, the passenger in the jump seat held a conversation with the captain and asked several questions regarding the operations. The first officer did not <b>participate</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> discussions, and it was he who conducted radio contact with air traffic control and the airline's operations' center.|$|E

5|$|World War II in Europe {{began on}} Friday 1 September 1939, when German forces invaded Poland. Lützow did not <b>participate</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> campaign. He was tasked with {{providing}} fighter protection for Berlin. From the Jagdfliegerschule in Werneuchen, he detached two squadrons {{and placed them}} {{under the command of}} Jagdgruppe 20 based at Strausberg. At the end of October 1939, a change in command of I. Gruppe (1st group) of Jagdgeschwader 3 (JG3—3rd Fighter Wing) was announced. The former commander Oberstleutnant (Lieutenant Colonel) Otto-Heinrich von Houwald was transferred to the Jagdfliegerschule in Werneuchen. Lützow joined I. Gruppe on 1 November 1939, officially taking over command as Gruppenkommandeur (group commander) two days later.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} second semi-final, a winner's press conference was held for the ten {{qualifying}} countries. As part of this press conference, the qualifying artists {{took part in a}} draw to determine which half of the grand final they would subsequently <b>participate</b> <b>in.</b> <b>This</b> draw was done in the order the countries were announced during the semi-final. Austria was drawn to compete in the first half. Following this draw, the shows' producers decided upon the running order of the final, as they had done for the semi-finals. Austria was subsequently placed to perform in position 11, following the entry from Greece and before the entry from Germany. On the day of the grand final, Austria was considered by bookmakers to be the second most likely to win the competition, placed only behind the entry from Sweden.|$|E
5|$|Skanderbeg's {{resources}} were worn out after {{over a decade}} of continuous war. Alfonso and the pope could not provide for him fully, while Venice continued to undermine Skanderbeg. The latter considered war with Skanderbeg since he maintained his alliance with Aragon. Relations with the Italian state worsened further when Lekë Dukagjini, Skanderbeg's elusive ally in the north, captured Dagnum. Even though Skanderbeg did not <b>participate</b> <b>in</b> <b>this,</b> Venice {{used it as a}} casus belli to launch an expedition against Skanderbeg. War never started but Albanian-Venetian relations sunk to their lowest point. The Venetian rectors continued to provoke Skanderbeg {{at a time when he}} had grown relatively weak due to his nephew and one of his most important officers, Hamza Kastrioti, deserting and joining the Ottomans. Hamza had become dissatisfied with Skanderbeg's growing power and, upon being received by the sultan, was offered control over much of Albania once conquered. Stung by the betrayal, Skanderbeg offered an ultimatum to Venice where they had to halt their provocations or begin war. Since a crusade was anticipated against the Ottomans, Venice did not want to seem pro-Ottoman and eased their stance towards Albania.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Cedar Creek {{occurred}} on October 19, 1864. Jubal Early's Confederate Army {{appeared to have}} a victory until General Sheridan rallied his troops to a successful counterattack. Although Union casualties were more than double those of the Confederates, this battle is considered a Union victory, and Confederate troops were driven from the battlefield. The Union troops recaptured all of their artillery lost earlier in the battle, and 22 additional cannons belonging to Early's army. The 2nd West Virginia Cavalry did not <b>participate</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> battle until near the end. The regiment advanced toward Front Royal right before the final cavalry charge by Merritt's and Custer's divisions. This positioning prevented the Confederate cavalry under General Lunsford L. Lomax from flanking the Union force. The Union victory helped President Abraham Lincoln get re-elected a month later.|$|E
