40|$|In {{a compact}} range (which employs a <b>parabolic</b> <b>main</b> <b>reflector</b> {{to convert the}} spherical wave {{originating}} from a point source to a reflected plane wave) the edge-generated diffractive fields degrade the uniformity of the plane wave.

This paper discusses the problem of designing an optimized rolled edge. Two examples of reflectors with rolled edges are presented, one with elliptic rolled edges and the other with blended rolled edges, both adhering to the same constraints on minimum operating frequency and size.

40|$|A high {{performance}} of an antenna defines {{the quality of}} service of a communication system. The most widely used narrow beam antennas in satellite communication systems {{for the past several}} decades are reflector types. Antenna feed system {{plays an important role in}} the overall antenna performance. The feed system is characterized by calculating the dish efficiency versus f/D ratio and the necessary subreflector dimensions needed to reshape the feedhorn pattern to properly illuminate the dish. The purpose of the study is to analyze the single conical corrugated feed system of the 32 -m Cassegrain Dual Reflector Antenna for obtaining {{high performance}} of the antenna considering the effects of losses in the feed system due to the f/D ratio and the hyperbola dimensions of the subreflector. In this paper, a simulation based analysis of a conical corrugated feed horn is performed, using ICARA software which has been developed for the analysis and design of reflector antennas and the analysis concentrated on f/D ratio, subreflector dimensions and reduction of cross-polarization. From fig. 3 (a-f), we realized that the focus of the 32 -m Cassegrain antenna is located behind the vertex of the <b>main</b> <b>parabolic</b> <b>reflector.</b> This facilitates the primary feed in this location with a 2. 6701 m diameter aperture incorporated in the <b>main</b> <b>parabolic</b> <b>reflector</b> design and high gain of 59. 3702 dB.

40|$|In this paper, a modular {{technique}} is described {{for the analysis}} of dual-reflector antennas using a reflectarray as a subreflector. An antenna configuration based on a sub-reflectarray and a <b>parabolic</b> <b>main</b> <b>reflector</b> provides better bandwidth than a single reflectarray, and has a number of advantages compared with a conventional dual-reflector antenna. Examples include the possibility of beam shaping by adjusting the phase on the sub-reflectarray, and potential capabilities to scan or reconfigure the beam. The modular technique implemented for the antenna analysis combines different methods {{for the analysis of}} each part of the antenna. First, the real field generated by the horn is considered as the incident field on each reflectarray element. Second, the reflectarray is analyzed with the same technique as for a single reflectarray, i. e., considering local periodicity and the real angle of incidence of the wave coming from the feed for each periodic cell. Third, the main reflector is analyzed using the Physical Optics (PO) technique, where the current on the reflector surface is calculated by summing the radiation from all the reflectarray elements. Finally, the field is calculated on a rectangular periodic mesh at a projected aperture, and then a time-efficient fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm is used to compute the radiation pattern of the antenna. The last step significantly improves the computational efficiency. However, it introduces a phase error, which reduces the accuracy of the radiation patterns for radiation angles far away from the antenna's axis. The phase errors hav...|$|E
40|$|A Cassegrain dual-reflector antenna {{which employs}} a flat reflectarray {{subreflector}} was analysed {{in a recent}} paper [1]. It was shown that the antenna beam can be scanned by introducing an appropriate progressive phase distribution across the reflectarray surface. This configuration is very attractive for steerable beam applications, because it combines the high gain and broad bandwidth properties of the <b>parabolic</b> <b>main</b> <b>reflector</b> with the simplicity of manufacturing a small electronically reconfigurable microstrip reflectarray antenna. The subreflector could be constructed on a thin liquid crystal (LC) substrate, {{and control of the}} phase distribution across the aperture would be achieved by applying a bias voltage to the individual elements in the patch array [2, 3]. In addition to the simplicity of this biasing arrangement, phase shifters based on LC materials can be designed to operate with no upper limit on the operating frequency range, thereby removing the main disadvantage of many existing active control technologies. Moreover precision micromachining processes and a quasi–optical measurement technique which are suitable for manufacturing and characterising sub mm wavelength phase agile reflectarrays, have recently been demonstrated at frequencies up to 170 GHz [4]. In this paper we present the design of a dual-reflector antenna which could use an ‘active’ sub-reflectarray based on liquid crystals to produce the required Earth scene scan profile of a limbsounder radiometric instrument [5]. The validity of the beam scanning concept has been demonstrated by designing, manufacturing and measuring the radiation patterns of a 120 mm diameter offset parabolic reflector at 94 GHz. In {{the first phase of the}} project we have used three planar solid metal subreflectors of diameter 28 -mm to generate a focussed beam in the boresight direction, and at offset scan angles of 2. 5 ° and 5 °. Experimental results are shown to be in reasonably good agreement with numerical simulations. In the second phase of the work, the solid metal subreflectors are replaced by a passive microstrip patch subreflectarray which is designed to scan the beam to an angle of 5 º. The final stage of the project will employ an electronically controllable LC reflectarray subreflector which will be used to scan the beam over the angular range 0 º to 5 º...|$|E

Provisions for interfacing the antenna with the space shuttle orbiter are presented and discussed. A program plan for hardware development and a rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost are also included. The conceptual design of the antenna is presented. It consists of a four-meter diameter <b>parabolic</b> torus <b>main</b> <b>reflector,</b> which is a graphite/epoxy shell supported by a graphite/epoxy truss. A rotating feed wheel assembly supports six Gregorian subreflectors covering the upper eight frequency channels from 6. 6 GHz through 118. 7 GHz, and two three-channel prime forms feed assemblies for 0. 6, 1. 4, and 2. 7 GHz. The feed wheel assembly also holds the radiometers and power supplies, and a drive system using a 400 Hz synchronous motor is described. The RF analysis of the antenna is performed using physical optics procedures for both the dual reflector Gregorian concept and the single reflector prime focus concept.

40|$|In recent years, {{the compact}} range {{has become very}} popular for {{measuring}} Radar Cross Section (RCS) and antenna patterns. The compact range, in fact, offers several advantages due to reduced size, a controlled environment, and privacy. On the other hand, it has some problems of its own, which must be solved properly {{in order to achieve}} high quality measurement results. For example, diffraction from the edges of the <b>main</b> <b>reflector</b> corrupts the plane wave in the target zone and creates spurious scattering centers in RCS measurements. While diffraction can be minimized by using rolled edges, the field of an offset single reflector compact range is corrupted by three other errors: the taper of the reflected field, the cross polarization introduced by the tilt of the feed and the aperture blockage introduced by the feed itself. These three errors can be eliminated by the use of a subreflector system. A properly designed subreflector system offers very little aperture blockage, no cross-polarization introduced and a minimization of the taper of the reflected field. A Gregorian configuration has been adopted in order to enclose the feed and the ellipsoidal subreflector in a lower chamber, which is isolated by absorbers from the upper chamber, where the <b>main</b> <b>parabolic</b> <b>reflector</b> and the target zone are enclosed. The coupling between the two rooms is performed through a coupling aperture. The first cut design for such a subreflector system is performed through Geometrical Optics ray tracing techniques (GO), and is greatly simplified by the use of the concept of the central ray introduced by Dragone. The purpose of the GO design is to establish the basic dimensions of the <b>main</b> <b>reflector</b> and subreflector, the size of the primary and secondary illuminating surfaces, the tilt angles of the subreflector and feed, and estimate the feed beamwidth. At the same time, the shape of the coupling aperture is initially determined...|$|R

40|$|By {{probing the}} field on a small {{subreflector}} at a minimal number of points, the main reflector surface errors can be obtained and subsequently used to design a phase-correction subreflector that can compensate for main reflector errors. The compensating phase-error profile across the subreflector can be achieved either by a surface deformation or {{by the use of}} an array of elements such as patch antennas that can cause a phase shift between the incoming and outgoing fields. The second option is of primary interest here, but the methodology can be applied to either case. The patch array is most easily implemented on a planar surface. Therefore, the example of a flat subreflector and a <b>parabolic</b> <b>main</b> <b>reflector</b> (a Newtonian dual reflector system) is considered in this work. The subreflector is assumed to be a reflector array covered with patch elements. The phase variation on a subreflector can be detected by a small number of receiving patch elements (probes). By probing the phase change at these few selected positions on the subreflector, the phase error over the entire surface can be recovered and used to change the phase of all the patch elements covering the subreflector plane to compensate for main reflector errors. This is accomplished by using a version of sampling theorem on the circular aperture. The sampling is performed on the phase-error function on the circular aperture of the main reflector by a method developed using Zernike polynomials. This method is based upon and extended from a theory previously proposed and applied to reflector aperture integration. This sampling method provides for an exact retrieval of the coefficients of up to certain orders in the expansion of the phase function, from values on a specifically calculated set of points in radial and azimuthal directions in the polar coordinate system, on the circular reflector aperture. The corresponding points on the subreflector are then obtained and, by probing the fields at these points, a set of phase values is determined that is then transferred back to the main reflector aperture for recovering the phase function. Once this function is recovered, the corresponding phase function on the subreflector is calculated and used to compensate for main reflector surface errors. In going back and forth between sub and main reflectors, geometrical (ray) optics is employed, which even though it ignores edge diffraction and other effects, is shown to be accurate for phase recovery...|$|E

40|$|This thesis investigates a new {{approach}} {{for dealing with the}} adverse effects of large-scale deformations in the <b>main</b> <b>reflector</b> of large Cassegrain antennas. In this method, the incident aperture distribution is imaged onto a tertiary focal plane. This is accomplished by using an optical imaging system consisting of a lens mounted behind the Cassegrain focus of the antenna. The lens forms a real image of the product of the incident aperture distribution and the pupil function of the antenna. The pupil function describes the profile of the <b>main</b> <b>reflector</b> of the antenna. If the incident aperture distribution is a plane wave, a real image of the pupil function of the <b>main</b> <b>reflector</b> will be produced at the focal plane of the image lens.
