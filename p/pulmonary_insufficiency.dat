40|$|ObjectiveTo {{analyze the}} impact of surgery and pericardial {{integrity}} on right atrial function and total heart volume variation {{in the setting of}} <b>pulmonary</b> valve <b>insufficiency.</b> MethodsRight atrial function and total heart volume variation were analyzed in 2 subgroups of patients with <b>pulmonary</b> valve <b>insufficiency</b> compared with healthy controls: group 1 with surgically repaired tetralogy of Fallot (n =  20 patients) and group 2 after balloon angioplasty of pulmonary valve stenosis in patients with isolated valve disease without surgery (n =  7 patients). Volumetric analysis of magnetic resonance imaging data revealed parameters of atrial function (reservoir, conduit, and pump functions and cyclic volume change) and of total heart volume (end-diastolic and end-systolic total heart volume and the variation). Statistical analysis included uncorrected and corrected pairwise comparisons and the calculation of groupwise Pearson correlation coefficients. ResultsIn group 1 with a pulmonary regurgitation fraction of 31. 0 % ± 14. 9 %, right atrial function was clearly impaired, with reduced reservoir and elevated conduit function, and total heart volume variation was elevated to  13. 9 % ± 3. 4 %. In group 2 with a pulmonary regurgitation fraction of 22. 8 % ± 6. 9 %, the values were close to normal, with unaffected atrial function and a total heart volume variation of 9. 9 % ± 3. 3 %. ConclusionsThe hydrodynamic effect of <b>pulmonary</b> valve <b>insufficiency</b> alone is likely not the only reason for impaired right atrial function and elevated total heart volume variation in patients with tetralogy of Fallot; it is rather the scar in the right atrium, the injured pericardium, and the disease itself that are responsible for the energetically unfavorable alterations...|$|R
50|$|The use of two simple {{mnemonics}} {{may help}} differentiate systolic and diastolic murmurs; PASS and PAID. Pulmonary and aortic stenoses are systolic while <b>pulmonary</b> and aortic <b>insufficiency</b> (regurgitation) are diastolic. Mitral and tricuspid defects are opposite.|$|R
50|$|<b>Pulmonary</b> valve <b>insufficiency</b> occurs {{commonly}} {{in healthy}} individuals {{to a very}} mild extent and does not require intervention. More appreciable insufficiency it is typically the result of damage to the valve due to cardiac catheterization, aortic balloon pump insertion, or other surgical manipulations.

It may also be secondary to severe pulmonary hypertension.|$|R

Five patients with this condition were identified. Two of these subsequently underwent mitral valve replacement under cardiopulmonary by-pass. Aortic insufficiency was not detected during this procedure and the aortic valve appeared to be anatomically normal at postmortem examination.

However, late residual lesions, primarily chronic <b>pulmonary</b> valve <b>insufficiency,</b> may {{have a negative impact}} on right-ventricular function, leading to the need for reoperation to insert a competent valve at the right-ventricular outflow.

40|$|In summary {{we found}} that {{following}} surgical repair of the ventricular septal defect in tetralogy of Fallot changes in left ventricular configuration with accentuation of the ventricular septum occured. This manifested in a contractional weakness with accentuation of the interventricular septum, which involved disturbances of regional wall motion. Furthermore this contractional weakness could already {{be seen as a}} straightening of the interventricular septum, which could be quantified by measuring the radial septal curvature. Furthermore, impaired contraction led to a restriction in left ventricular function. The determination of the extent of regional wall motion abnormality expressed as a the afore mentioned septal straightening leading to an enlarged radial septal curvature especially in diastole, could be a marker for an assessment of left ventricular function in patients after surgical repair of tetralogy of Fallot. In addition to the afore mentioned, the interventricular septum seems to act as a mediator between both ventricles and hence affects both ventricular functions Right ventricular congestion following pulmonary insuffiency is expressed as an enlargement in the radial septal curvature in end diastole and mid systole. Thus determination of the radial septal curvature {{could be used as a}} parameter for hemodynamic relevance of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>insufficiencies.</b> The interventricular septum, which is assigned to the left ventricle by definition, not only seems to be responsible for changes in left but also right ventricular by acting as a mediator between both ventricles...|$|R

50|$|The {{pathophysiology}} {{is due to}} {{diastolic pressure}} variations between the pulmonary artery and right ventricle, differences are often very small, but increase regurgitation. An elevation in <b>pulmonary</b> <b>insufficiency</b> due to elevated intrathoracic pressure is relevant in ventilated patients (having acute restrictive right ventricular physiology). The reasons for changes in stiffness of the right ventricle's walls are not well understood, but such stiffness is thought to increase with hypertrophy of the ventricle.|$|E

40|$|Tetralogy of Fallot is {{the most}} common cyanogenic {{congenital}} heart defect. The diagnosis is based on clinical signs, ECG examination, ultrasound examination of the heart, additional imaging methods and invasive testing. The therapeutic approach to the patient with tetralogy is complex and based on conservative and radical methods. Patients who have not undergone a radical surgical intervention have a poor prognosis, whereas the prognosis is much better for patients who have been operated.

50|$|Clinically, IPH manifests as a triad of haemoptysis, diffuse parenchymal infiltrates on chest radiographs, {{and iron}} {{deficiency}} anaemia. It is diagnosed {{at an average}} age of 4.5 plus or minus 3.5 years, and it is twice as common in females. The clinical course of IPH is exceedingly variable, and most of the patients continue to have episodes of pulmonary haemorrhage despite therapy. Death may occur suddenly from acute pulmonary haemorrhage or after progressive <b>pulmonary</b> <b>insufficiency</b> resulting in chronic respiratory failure.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pulmonary</b> <b>insufficiency</b> (or incompetence, or regurgitation) is a {{condition}} in which the pulmonary valve is incompetent and allows backflow from the pulmonary artery to the right ventricle of the heart during diastole. While a small amount of backflow may occur ordinarily, it is usually only shown on an echocardiogram and is harmless. More pronounced regurgitation that is noticed through a routine physical examination is a medical sign of disease and warrants further investigation. If it is secondary to pulmonary hypertension it is referred to as a Graham Steell murmur.|$|E

5000|$|Secondary {{restrictive}} cardiomyopathy: About 50% {{of patients}} have cardiac abnormalities classically of the restrictive-type caused by serotonin-induced fibrosis of the valvular endocardium, notably the tricuspid and pulmonary valves, called cardiac fibrosis.
