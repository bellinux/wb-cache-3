50|$|In contrast, Faizul Latif Chowdhury, in 1999, {{suggested}} a production-substituting model of smuggling in which <b>price</b> <b>disparity</b> due to cost of supply {{is critically important}} as an incentive for smuggling. This <b>price</b> <b>disparity</b> is caused by domestic consumption taxes and import duties. Drawing attention {{to the case of}} cigarettes, Chowdhury suggested that, in Bangladesh, smuggling of cigarettes reduced the level of domestic production. Domestic production of cigarettes is subject to value added tax (VAT) and other consumption tax. Reduction of domestic taxes enables the local producer to supply at a lower cost and bring down the <b>price</b> <b>disparity</b> that encourages smuggling.|$|E
5000|$|According to the DCA study, across five {{industries}} (toys and accessories, children's clothing, adult clothing, {{home health}} care products for seniors, and personal care products), personal care had the highest disparities for women. Personal care products for women cost 13 percent more than personal care products for men. Additionally, the DCA found that personal care products for women were purchased more often than other consumer goods. Therefore, a 13 percent difference in pricing leads to a [...] "significant financial burden" [...] for women over a lifetime. The largest <b>price</b> <b>disparity</b> was found in hair products. Hair care products for women cost 48 percent more than for men. While the second largest <b>price</b> <b>disparity</b> was in razor cartridges, costing women 11 percent more.|$|E

5000|$|Gender-based price {{discrimination}} {{is a type}} of economic discrimination that consists of the practice of charging one gender a different price than another gender for identical goods or services. It is a subcategory of {{price discrimination}}, which also includes race and class-based price discrimination. Further, [...] "discrimination" [...] often evokes a legal connotation, but in this context, gender-based price discrimination is often studied by examining gendered <b>price</b> <b>disparities.</b> Whether gendered <b>price</b> <b>disparities</b> prove an intent to discriminate or an illegal discrimination is a legal inquiry determined by the law of the applicable jurisdiction.Typically, <b>price</b> <b>disparities</b> negatively affect women more often than men. A study of gendered pricing in New York City by the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs found that, on average, women's products cost 7 percent more than similar products for men.|$|R

50|$|Gender {{research}} has heavily {{focused on the}} interaction between gender and the economy. Typically, {{research in this area}} involves the issue of the gender pay gap.

Scholars suggest that the existence of gendered <b>price</b> <b>disparities</b> contribute to gender inequality by creating an economic burden that does not exist for the other gender and by reinforcing gender roles in the marketplace.|$|R

Third, when we divide the entire sample period into a pre-liberalization period and a post-liberalization, we find that the mean value spillover is stronger during the post-liberalization period for the low <b>price</b> <b>disparity</b> group. Finally, we report that during the post-liberalization period, the volatility spillover increases from A shares to H shares while it decreases from H shares to A shares. Thi...|$|E

5000|$|Gender-based price {{discrimination}} {{is a form}} of economic discrimination that occurs when one gender is charged a different price than another gender for identical goods or services.

Acts of discrimination often have legal ramifications, but a study of gender-based price discrimination first looks at gendered <b>price</b> <b>disparities.</b> From there, the question of whether gendered <b>price</b> <b>disparities</b> prove an intent to discriminate or constitute illegal discrimination can become a legal inquiry that is developed by examining the law of the applicable jurisdiction.

40|$|The {{presence}} of <b>price</b> <b>disparity</b> between A- and H- shares {{suggests that the}} two markets are segmented and thus allocation of capital is inefficient. In this paper, we attempt to identify the factors contributing to the <b>price</b> <b>disparity,</b> {{with a view to}} helping policymakers find solutions to the problem. Our results suggest that the disparity is caused by a combination of micro and macro factors.

40|$|The <b>price</b> <b>disparity</b> {{between the}} dual-listed Chinese {{firms in the}} A- and H-share markets {{is one of the}} most {{intriguing}} puzzles in the Mainland and Hong Kong financial markets. In this paper, we revisit this <b>price</b> <b>disparity</b> puzzle using the channel of parameter uncertainty. In the presence of information asymmetry and market segmentation, investors have different views on a firm's asset volatility, and hence, different valuations of the same reference firm. We estimate a structural model for equity pricing using a Bayesian approach, in which investors' model-parameter uncertainty is represented by the posterior distributions of the firm's asset volatility. Our regression analysis shows that parameter uncertainty explains variation of the <b>price</b> <b>disparity,</b> in addition to other market-based and macro factors. We also find that parameter uncertainty is related to a firm's market-to-book ratio of equity, its age and size, and global risk appetite in the financial market.

50|$|While {{studies have}} shown {{significant}} <b>price</b> <b>disparities</b> in personal care products between men and women, gendered <b>price</b> <b>disparities</b> across personal care services has been inconsistent. A recent study titled Cost of Doing Femininity examined two areas of personal care services that had directly comparable prices between men and women: hair salons and dry cleaners. The study found that only 15 out of 100 randomly selected hair salons had the same prices {{for both men and}} women, and none of the salons charged women less than men. Dry cleaning prices depended on the type and amount of fabric, with more embellishments corresponding with higher prices. This price factor, however, tended to negatively impact women more often than men because women's garments {{are more likely to be}} embroidered or be made of delicate fabric.|$|R

Taking China’s exchange rate system reform as a unique event, I examine the <b>price</b> <b>disparity</b> between A-share and H-share (or ADR) using a sample of 28 Chinese companies listed in Shenzhen, Shanghai, Hong Kong, and New York. I conduct a panel-data investigation to examine the <b>price</b> <b>disparity</b> {{before and after the}} transition from the pegged to the managed floating exchange rate. I have obtained several important findings in this study. First, RMB exchange rate reform in 2005 has significant effect on <b>price</b> <b>disparity</b> between A-shares and H-shares and also between A-share and ADR, which shows that relaxation of the exchange rate control brings about a clear convergence of A-share price with foreign share price. This result is robust with different models. Second, we also found that currency factor has significant effect on price premium between A-shares and foreign shares. Appreciation in RMB would lead to a decrease in price premium.

During the boom and bust years from 2005 to 2008, the regional patterns of proportions of subprime mortgages for each mortgage institution type were similar, adversely impacting borrowers in the Southern Gulf region. These spatial patterns suggest that nonlocal banks and independents made the same underwriting conclusions about borrowers in regional markets as the local bank specialists. ...|$|R
