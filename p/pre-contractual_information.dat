While policy-makers are gradually creating the necessary conditions to strengthen this digital transformation, numerous policy issues and unanswered questions remain. Against this background, CEPS-ECRI formed a Task Force to explore four specific core questions: What type of level playing field is necessary during the digital transformation? What are the opportunities and risks related to big (alternative) data and increasingly sophisticated algorithms? What framework of <b>pre-contractual</b> <b>information</b> duties is appropriate in a digital era? How can the regulatory framework for digital authentication be improved...|$|E
40|$|We show that, in the {{presence}} of <b>pre-contractual</b> private <b>information,</b> firms with a multi-tier hierarchy may be reluctant to adopt incremental technological improvements that reduce expected production costs. The reason is that such advanced technologies may aggravate the extraction of informational rents along the hierarchy chain. We present an example where the adoption of a technological improvement becomes less likely as the hierarchy lengthens. As a consequence, investments in R&D increase less than proportionally with firm size...|$|R
40|$|This paper studies {{long-term}} contracts for experimentation in a principal-agent setting with adverse selection (<b>pre-contractual</b> hidden <b>information)</b> about the agent’s ability, dynamic moral hazard, and private learning about project quality. We show that profit maximization {{by the principal}} generally leads to under-experimentation by an agent of low ability, even though {{there would be no}} distortion in the absence of either adverse selection or moral hazard. The structure of optimal contracts is shaped by a variety of considerations including dynamic agency costs and the possibility of post-contractual hidden information about project quality. We derive two explicit menus of contracts {{that can be used to}} implement the secondbest solution: “bonus contracts ” and “clawback contracts”. Both feature history-contingent dynamic streams of transfers...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: In {{order to}} solve {{problems}} in the current project management system, the paper presents the asymmetric information games existing in construction projects through information economics viewpoints. Design/methodology/approach: The owner has private information about the project profitability and he exerts an unobservable level of effort {{in order to increase}} the feasibility of successfully completing the project in terms of meeting product specifications. The paper analyzes the principal-agent relationship between the owner and supervisor with “principal-agent theory” of the game theory. In addition, the paper validates the model through two project cases. Findings: We can conclude that the incentive contract {{plays an important role in}} reducing the moral hazard. The main contribution of this studyis to examine the influence of both <b>pre-contractual</b> private <b>information</b> and the sensitivities between the interrelated performance measures on the design of an optimal incentive contract. Social implications: At last, some advices are put forward to advance the project management system in China, and some external mechanism can effectively inhibit the"moral hazard" and "adverse selection" to occur. Originality/value: A model of principal-agent relationship between the owner and supervisor is formulated. This model takes consideration of the moral hazard, which isdifferent from most existing researches in this field. </p...|$|R

Financial services, including the provision of credit, are subject to licensing and supervision by Norwegian authorities; this applies even to foreign credit institutions offering financial services in Norway.

This paper presents the view that responsibility for identifying the customer's information technology requirements is a responsibility that should be shared between the customer and the supplier.

40|$|The authors analyse and at {{the same}} time criticize the full {{harmonization}} principle, with its broad formulation in Article 4 of the Commission proposal for a Directive on consumer rights. It implies a complete, though “announced”, paradigm shift in EU consumer law from “minimum” to “full harmonization”, while at the same time considerably reducing the protective ambit of prior EC directives against the objectives of Article 153 EC. So far, the proposal seems to be inspired more by the unspecified and unproven belief that the completion of the internal market depends on identical rules in key areas of consumer contract law, such as <b>pre–contractual</b> <b>information,</b> sales law, and unfair terms, while it may only be acceptable in such specific cases as off–the–premises and distance contracts. The paper demonstrates how many open questions will arise the proposal is put onto the EU statute books. These coming controversies will necessarily detract from the original purpose of EU consumer law, namely to increase consumer confidence in the internal market and to give traders a comparable though not identical level playing field, but not to provoke extended litigation about the extent and scope of the full harmonization approach...|$|E

40|$|This article aims at {{assessing}} some of {{the most}} recent developments in European law which are said to improve clients’ protection buying on European financial markets. It focuses on (a) provisions relating to <b>pre-contractual</b> and marketing <b>information</b> obligations, and related liability, supervision and sanction regimes, (b) developments in product governance arrangements which are meant to reduce potential risks of failure to comply with investor protection rules and on (c) “product intervention powers” of supervisory authorities, considered as the last resort measure for investor protection purposes. This article concludes that European regulators move in the right direction where they focus on point-of-sale regulation and product governance arrangements. This article also stresses that appropriate rules should go hand in hand with a change of culture to bring back ethos at manufacturers’ and distributors’. Not only the letter of the rules, but more fundamentally, the spirit of the rules should be complied with at each level of the distribution chain. Only that combination will bring back investors’ confidence for the long-term...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{studies the}} {{determinants}} of information gathering in insurance and credit markets. In our set-up, information may have either operational or strategic value, e. g. it may improve allocative decisions or allow agents to appropriate {{a larger share of}} gains from trade at the contracting stage. The timing of information gathering is endogenous and agents can gather information either before or after contracting. Access to precontractual information generates a negative contracting externality, which was first identified in Hirshleifer. s (1971) seminal contribution. In contrast with a well established conventional wisdom and a substantial literature, we prove that, if the operational value of information is positive and not "too small", private returns of information fall short of its social returns, and <b>pre-contractual</b> access to <b>information</b> leads to under-investment. On the contrary, agents over-invest in information gathering activities, when the operational value of the available signals is sufficiently low. Consistently with contractual arrangements observed in the real world, we also show that equilibrium contracts have also a very simple shape when private information can be voluntarily disclosed. private information, information gathering, value of information...|$|R
40|$|The Common European Sales Law (CESL), {{currently}} under examination at the European Parliament, {{is intended to}} introduce a regime for cross-border sales that individual Member States can extend to domestic transactions (Art. 13), aiming to promote harmonization by choice rather than by command. It constitutes an opt-in system that parties can adopt (Art. 8), {{as an alternative to}} the CISG in B 2 B transactions, and an alternative to national regimes in B 2 B transactions. The analysis of <b>pre-contractual</b> <b>information</b> in European contract law (ECL), with special reference to the CESL, is used to substantiate a broader claim: the weakness of a status-based approach to ECL and the desirability to move to a transaction-based approach, including reference to supply chains. The intuition is that the determination "if" and "how" disclosure should occur is, in both cases, a consideration primarily dependent on the type of transaction parties engage in, whether it is a standardized or a customized one. Only within this distinction might, the status of the parties play a role. This essay suggests a shift from status to transaction, with the sales regime organized around transaction technologies. Such a change will not eliminate the differences between consumer and business contracts but will reverse the order, with status as a potential sub-variable of the type of transaction...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} debt {{decision making}} of individuals, being aware that any debt decision is an interactive process that borrowers integrally share with lenders. We {{assume that the}} quantity and quality of information used in consumer credit markets- both demand and supply side- are able to influence some behavioural biases that may interfere with sound debt decision making. We apply a natural experiment, available in Italy, due to the Legislative Decree N. 141 of 13 th August 2010 that reformed the consumer credit market thanks to two simultaneous and combined patterns of improved information: strengthened <b>pre-contractual</b> <b>information,</b> on the demand side, and mandatory creditworthiness evaluation, on the supply side. This law offers a cut-off date to test if enhanced information is able to improve borrowing decision making. Our findings support that in the very short term, the law enforcement shows a reduction of bad behaviours toward loan requests, with a decrease of repetitions of loan requests when arguably induced by obstinacy behaviors. Moreover, in the medium term, the new consumer credit regulation has significantly improved customers’ repayment ability, enhancing the quality of credit distribution, with respect to the pre-law situation. These evidences shed an optimistic evaluation of effectiveness of information in improving debt behaviours, even when introduced by a legislative action. Nevertheless, caution has to be taken, because a systematic ‘better information-better behaviour’ relationship cannot be assured. Definitively, this effectiveness has been shown to be improved by the conjunct adaptation of behaviours on both the demand and offer sides of the consumer credit marketplace...|$|E
40|$|For {{more than}} 25 years, the European Union (EU) and its legal predecessor, the European Community, have adopted {{legislation}} directly {{aimed at improving}} the position of consumer who wish {{to take advantage of}} the opportunities offered by the internal market. This legislation generally deals with selected issues only, such as the provision of <b>pre-contractual</b> <b>information</b> or a right of withdrawal from a contract where the circumstances in which it was made (at a distance or at the consumer’s home) or the nature of the transaction so justifies. There are some measures of more general application, such as the regulation of unfair contract terms or the sale of goods to consumers. The particular type of measure used by the EU has been the Directive. A directive does not apply directly, but needs to be transposed into the national laws of each of the 27 EU Member States, i. e., each Member State has to adopt legislation, or amend existing legislation, to give effect to the requirements of a particular directive. This process is commonly referred to as “harmonisation”, although the terminology used in the EU Treaties is that of “approximation”. What this means is that the EU has tried to introduce a common set of consumer protection rules by requiring each national law to be adjusted, rather than by adopting legislation which would apply directly without the need of further action by the Member States. As the directives adopted to date only deal with specific aspects of consumer protection, there is considerable interaction between national provisions giving effect to EU directives and related areas of domestic law; indeed, it is often the case that domestic rules had to be adopted to supplement particular rules required by a directive...|$|E
40|$|The article {{provides}} an image {{to the point}} on information provided to consumers before {{the conclusion of a}} credit contract, starting with the importance of information and ending with the legal framework. A high consumer protection may be achieved primarily through consumer information. The complexity of banking services but also the vulnerability of consumers in relation to the banks and the unbalanced relationship led to the need to develop specific legislation that clearly establishes the rights and obligations of the parties of a credit agreement for consumers. In this regard, in 2008, after many debates, Directive 2008 / 48 /EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on credit agreements for consumers was adopted. At national level, the Directive was transposed by the Government Emergency Ordinance no. 50 / 2010 on credit agreements for consumers. Taking into account national specificities, such as lack of experience of consumers in financial products, the irresponsible lending and the unfair practices of creditors, the national act includes wider provisions than the European Directive, such as those relating to fees limitations or those related to the calculation of the variable interest rate. Also the GEO no 50 / 2010 applies to all credit agreements concluded by consumers and creditors. As regards the advertising, any advertisement shall include a series of standard information. Also, <b>pre-contractual</b> <b>information</b> is standard information, is provided to consumers 15 days before the contract is concluded and is transmitted through the “European Consumer Credit Information sheet Standard”.

40|$|A brief {{examination}} {{of the history of}} the guarantee reveals that equity treated the guarantor as a favoured debtor, given the absence of real benefit to the guarantor. However, these protections have largely been removed by standard form guarantee contracts used by, credit providers, and the law is also otherwise deficient in protecting consumer guarantors. As the expansion of the use of credit in recent years has meant that guarantees are now sometimes given carelessly and thoughtlessly, by persons without adequate education and resources to protect their interests, regulation is required (Chapter 1). The statutory regulation of guarantees before the passing of the Credit Act was inadequate. After examining the scope and nature of the Credit Act, the effect of the Credit Act on the regulation of guarantees is examined (Chapter 2). The extent to which the common law and statute law regulate <b>pre-contractual</b> <b>information</b> given to guarantors is then examined. It is concluded that room for improvement exists (Chapter 3). The extent to which the common law and statute law regulate the exercise of undue influence, unfair pressure and the making of unconscionable bargains is then examined and it is concluded that developments will occur rapidly in this area (Chapter 4). Common law and statutory provisions which discharge the guarantor from liability are then examined in the light of the operation of the Credit Act and it is concluded that some flaws exist both in principle and in the operation of the law (Chapter 5). The extent to which the guarantor is entitled to control the appropriation of payments made by the debtor, and the extent to which the guarantor's liability is coextensive with that of the debtor is then examined and some changes suggested (Chapter 6). The guarantor's rights to have action taken first against the debtor and the debtor's assets, the guarantor's rights to notice before action, and the right of indemnification after action, are then examined (Chapter 7). The possible reasons for the non-regulation of guarantees are examined and dismissed; past suggestions for reform and possible future reforms are examined (Chapter 8). Standard form contracts of guarantee are discussed and the text of a draft fair, simple English, standard form guarantee is suggested (Chapter 9). The law is as stated at 30 November, 1985.
