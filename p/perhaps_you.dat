You want a short cut to making an atom bomb? You want the key to Soviet ballistic missile guidance systems? Or <b>perhaps</b> <b>you</b> want the Russian alternative to the anti-radar paint on the stealth bomber? What you need is red mercury.|$|E
25|$|B. F. Skinner, theorist of operant conditioning, {{shows how}} a pigeon has {{been taught to}} {{distinguish}} between two words and behaves appropriately depending on which one is being presented. It learned each response with a reward of food therefore its behaviour is being shaped by controlling its environment. An example of this conditioning in a consumer behaviour context is a cinema using a consumer incentive scheme. As a consumer, if one is given a card which entitles you to a free movie if you bring a friend and free popcorn on Tuesdays with {{the purchase of a}} ticket per se, one is more likely to go to a movie when <b>perhaps</b> <b>you</b> wouldn’t have otherwise.|$|E
500|$|In a {{final scene}} that {{followed}} Jacqueline's suicide, Mary, Gregory, and Jason {{meet at the}} Dante restaurant. Gregory and Mary go off together, leaving Jason standing before the restaurant's mural of Dante and Beatrice, making clear his failure {{as an artist and}} lover. He says to himself: [...] "I am alive, yet every hope I had is dead. Death can be good. Death can be happy. If I could speak like Cyrano... then <b>perhaps,</b> <b>you</b> might understand." ...|$|E

500|$|On {{the advice}} of Herbert Warren, he {{returned}} to Magdalen to study Jurisprudence in October 1921. Thanks to Warren, Denning {{was elected to the}} Eldon Law Scholarship, worth £100 a year, to finance his studies; when the news of Denning's election was brought, Warren wrote [...] "you are a marked man. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>you</b> will be a Lord of Appeal some day". Denning took his final examinations in June 1922 and impressed the examiner, Geoffrey Cheshire, by correctly answering questions on the Law of Property Act which had been given Royal Assent only a few days before.|$|E
500|$|Spacey {{summed up}} Underwood's {{relationship}} with the viewer - i.e. whenever he breaks the fourth wall - as being {{like that of a}} [...] "best friend" [...] and [...] "the person [...] more than anyone." [...] Because of this, his asides to the viewer serves as an indication of Underwood's true feelings and intentions - typically when he is feigning politeness and courtesy to people whom he despises. In the season 2 premiere, after having gone the whole episode without doing so, Underwood addresses the viewer directly, saying, [...] "Did you think I had forgotten you? <b>Perhaps</b> <b>you</b> hoped I had." [...] In addition, in season 3, after an argument with Claire that ends with her storming out on him, a seething Frank vents his anger by lashing out at the viewer; looking directly into the camera, he snaps [...] "What're you lookin' at?!" ...|$|E
500|$|As {{a result}} of the White House lunch meeting, Leach agreed to abandon the idea that the double eagle design be used for the small gold pieces, and to {{cooperate}} with Bigelow and Pratt in the making of the new coins. [...] Leach even undertook to reimburse Pratt's fee of $300 to Bigelow from government funds. [...] The President wanted to see Saint-Gaudens' standing eagle from the ten-dollar piece adapted in a recessed surface for the smaller pieces, and, if it did not constitute a change of design, used on the ten-dollar piece as well (a project that did not go beyond the talking stage). [...] Bigelow wrote to Pratt on May 1 after conferring with Leach, stating that the Mint Director would likely not object if Pratt were to improve Saint-Gaudens' standing eagle, but [...] "I would not, if I were you, get too far from the original, as the President likes it. [...] <b>Perhaps</b> <b>you</b> can make him like it better." ...|$|E

500|$|On {{his return}} to England in May 1933, Waugh, short of cash, had to {{complete}} numerous writing commitments before he could begin work on the projected novel. In October–November he wrote {{his account of the}} South American journey, which he called Ninety-two Days. He then went to Fez in Morocco, to begin the novel in warmth and solitude. In January he wrote to Mary Lygon, reporting that he had written 18,500 words of [...] "my filthy novel", and later he told Katharine Asquith: [...] "I have just killed a little boy at a lawn meet and made his mother commit adultery... so <b>perhaps</b> <b>you</b> won't like it after all". By 10 February he had reached the half-way point—45,000 words—but was uncertain how the story should proceed, and [...] returned to England at the end of February with most of the second half unwritten. He finished the book at the Easton Court Hotel at Chagford, in Devon, a regular retreat that he used when completing writing projects. By mid-April the book was with his publishers, Chapman & Hall, and Waugh was busy correcting the proofs.|$|E
500|$|Before Lois {{prepares to}} undergo in vitro fertilization, Dr. Hartman shows her several photos of babies {{conceived}} by celebrity couples, including actress Shelley Duvall and singer-songwriter James Blunt; actress Hilary Swank and actor Gary Busey; Olympic medalist Florence Griffith-Joyner and physicist Stephen Hawking; and actress, writer and comedian Tina Fey and actor Joaquin Phoenix. Beginning the procedure, Lois objects to Dr. Hartman's method of embryonic insertion. In response, he replies, [...] "Well, <b>perhaps</b> <b>you</b> could tell them—if only you spoke Hovitos," [...] {{a reference to}} Raiders of the Lost Ark. Later, {{in an attempt to}} cause Lois to have a miscarriage, Peter lays down a series of Grey's Anatomy DVDs in order to lure Lois into being punched in the stomach by the [...] "Acme Miscarriage Kit", a boxing glove attached to a crossbow. In a reference to the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies cartoon series Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner, Peter ultimately ends up missing with the crossbow, causing the glove to bounce and hit a large rock and land inches in front of him as he is standing on a narrow cliff. The ground then drops out from underneath his feet, causing him to fall like Wile E. Coyote.|$|E
500|$|Goal Auzeen Saedi, {{reviewing}} Keeping Up {{with the}} Kardashians for Psychology Today, emphasized the show's influence saying that: [...] "The Kardashians become more relatable the more famous they become." [...] Saedi also questioned {{their decision to}} appear on the show and added: [...] "But if living life in the spotlight is so taxing and demands multiple justifications for the way your life is being lived and criticized, <b>perhaps</b> <b>you</b> can take the cameras out of your house." [...] Vinnie Mancuso, writing for New York Observer, criticized the show and felt: [...] "roughly one iota of shadenfreudic pleasure from this endeavor, {{but for the most part}} this show is the 100% drizzling poops." [...] David Hinckley of the New York Daily News, reviewing the tenth season, said that [...] "even when you think something about the Kardashians could be interesting, it's not," [...] adding that the [...] "entertainment value [...] is like having spent 10 years in Rapid City, S.D., watching the traffic lights change." [...] Amy Amatangelo of The Hollywood Reporter said that [...] "in true Kardashian fashion, they managed to make everything about them," [...] after Caitlyn Jenner came out as a trans woman to her family in the [...] "About Bruce" [...] special aired as part of the tenth season. Amatangelo felt that the conversations [...] "seemed a little too staged, too controlled", and noted that [...] "there was no attempt to educate the viewers about transgender issues." ...|$|E

2500|$|Virgil {{eventually}} convinces Johanna true {{love can}} overcome their social differences, and he asks the emperor {{for her hand}} in marriage. This is the crucial scene in the picture, and brings the otherwise lightweight movie plot to a higher level. The Emperor is cordial and fatherly with Virgil, and treats him with respect and even a bit of admiration. But he is certain Johanna could never be happy living in Newark, New Jersey. [...] "We are not better than you," [...] explains the Emperor sadly, [...] "I think <b>perhaps</b> <b>you</b> are better than us. But we are like snails: If you take us out of our majestic shells, we die." ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{announcement}} of the planned rally, Brannon Howse, a professional organizer of Christian conferences, expressed wariness, stating [...] "The Apostle Paul warns Christians against uniting with unbelievers in spiritual endeavors. While I applaud and agree with many of Glenn Beck's conservative and constitutional views, that does not give me or any other Bible-believing Christian justification to compromise Biblical truth by spiritually joining Beck." [...] Breakpoint's Diane Singer said, [...] "If you're like me and believe [...] have been deceived into following another Jesus, then <b>perhaps</b> <b>you</b> share my concerns. I want real revival to come to America, which means it {{must be based on}} Truth, not deception."

2500|$|In September 2006, {{emergency}} contraception expert Anna Glasier wrote a BMJ editorial entitled [...] "Emergency Contraception. Is it worth all the fuss?" [...] that said in closing: [...] "So is {{emergency contraception}} worth the fuss? If {{you are a}} woman who has had unprotected sex then of course it is, because emergency contraception will prevent pregnancy in some women some of the time—and if you don’t want to get pregnant anything is better than nothing. If you are the CMAJ’s editor or FDA commissioner then yes, because scientific freedom is worth the fight. If you are looking for an intervention that will reduce abortion rates, emergency contraception may not be the solution, and <b>perhaps</b> <b>you</b> should concentrate most on encouraging people to use contraception before or during sex, not after it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dennett did {{not become}} active in the women's {{suffrage}} movement until her marriage began to break up. [...] Later, she wrote, [...] "I went into suffrage work, as <b>perhaps</b> <b>you</b> know, because I needed an anaesthetic at the time, and suffrage was the nearest thing at hand that was unconnected with my previous work." [...] Dennett began her work as field secretary of the Massachusetts Suffrage Association, organizing lectures, rallies, sermons, cheap meals, speaking tours to gather signatures for petitions, and similar outreach efforts. [...] Dennett's opinion on why women deserved the vote was simple: [...] "Our basic principles that 'governments derive their just powers from {{the consent of the}} governed' [...] undeniably imply the right of women to direct representation by the vote, since women are governed and women are people." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Elijah {{of legend}} {{did not lose}} any {{of his ability to}} afflict the comfortable. The case of Rabbi Eliezer son of Rabbi Simon ben Yohai is illustrative. Once, when walking a beach, he came upon a hideously ugly man—the prophet in disguise. The man greeted him courteously, [...] "Peace be with thee, Rabbi." [...] Instead of {{returning}} the greeting, the rabbi could not resist an insult, [...] "How ugly you are! Is there anyone as ugly as you in your town?" [...] Elijah responded with, [...] "I don’t know. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>you</b> should tell the Master Architect how ugly is this, His construction." [...] The rabbi realized his wrong and asked for pardon. But Elijah would not give it until the entire city had asked for forgiveness for the rabbi and the rabbi had promised to mend his ways.|$|E
2500|$|Morrison {{joined the}} London Missionary Society in 1804 and {{was chosen to}} lead a mission to China. They sent him to study at Gosport and {{introduced}} him to a young Cantonese man studying English in London: Robert Morrison transcribes his name as [...] "Yong Sam Tak", Eliza Morrison as [...] "Yung-san-tih" [...] in [...] "Mandarin" [...] transcription , and whose actual name was probably Rong Sande (...) [...] In 1807, the LMS instructed Morrison to sail to Guangzhou (then known as [...] "Canton") and continue studying until he had [...] "accomplished [...] great object of acquiring the language", whereupon he would [...] "turn this attainment into a direction which may be of extensive use to the world: <b>perhaps</b> <b>you</b> may have the honour of forming a Chinese Dictionary, more comprehensive and correct than any preceding one", as well as translating the Bible into Chinese [...]|$|E
2500|$|The couple {{continued}} to live separately after the civil marriage. In October 1956, Davidman was walking across her kitchen when she tripped over the telephone wire {{and fell to the}} floor, thereby breaking her left upper leg. At the Churchill Hospital, Oxford, she was diagnosed with incurable cancer, with bone metastases from breast carcinoma. It was at this time that Lewis recognized that he {{had fallen in love with}} her, realizing how despondent he would feel to lose her. He wrote to a friend: [...] "new beauty and new tragedy have entered my life. You would be surprised (or <b>perhaps</b> <b>you</b> would not?) to know how much of a strange sort of happiness and even gaiety there is between us." [...] Davidman underwent several operations and radiation treatment for the cancer. In March 1957, Warren Lewis wrote in his diary: [...] "One of the most painful days of my life. Sentence of death has been passed on Joy, and the end is only a matter of time." ...|$|E
