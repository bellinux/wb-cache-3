25|$|The word utility {{is used to}} mean general {{well-being}} or happiness, and Mill's view is that utility is {{the consequence}} of a good action. Utility, {{within the context of}} utilitarianism, refers to people performing actions for social utility. With social utility, he means the well-being of many people. Mill's explanation of the concept of utility in his work, Utilitarianism, is that <b>people</b> <b>really</b> do desire happiness, and since each individual desires their own happiness, it must follow that all of us desire the happiness of everyone, contributing to a larger social utility. Thus, an action that results in the greatest pleasure for the utility of society is the best action, or as Jeremy Bentham, the founder of early Utilitarianism put it, as the greatest happiness of the greatest number.|$|E

25|$|Selinunte was {{the most}} {{westerly}} of the Greek colonies in Sicily, {{and for this reason}} they soon came into contact with the Phoenicians of western Sicily and the native Sicilians in the west and northwest of the island. The Phoenicians do not at first seem to have conflicted with them; but as early as 580BCE the Selinuntines were engaged in hostilities with the non-Greek Elymian people of Segesta, whose territory bordered their own. A body of emigrants from Rhodes and Cnidus who subsequently founded Lipara, supported the Segestans on this occasion, leading to their victory; but disputes and hostilities between the Segestans and Selinuntines seem to have occurred frequently, and it is possible that when Diodorus speaks of the Segestans being at war with the Lilybaeans (modern Marsala) in 454BCE, that the Selinuntines are the <b>people</b> <b>really</b> meant.|$|E

To some people, Pyramid Head should be in all the stories because they do like him."

Despite {{the ups and downs of}} success at a young age, Gillies says the band [...] "appreciate what we've achieved and what we've got" [...] in their careers.

500|$|ABT dancer Sarah Lane {{served as}} a [...] "dance double" [...] for Portman in the film. In a March 3 blog entry for Dance Magazine, {{editor-in-chief}} Wendy Perron asked: [...] "Do <b>people</b> <b>really</b> believe that it takes only one year to make a ballerina? We know that Natalie Portman studied ballet as a kid and had a year of intensive training for the film, but that doesn't add up to being a ballerina. However, it seems that {{many people believe that}} Portman did her own dancing in Black Swan." [...] This led to responses from Benjamin Millepied and Aronofsky, who both defended Portman as well as a response from Lane on the subject.|$|E
500|$|Of {{the various}} fields Stratton studied, {{it is his}} {{experimentation}} in binocular vision and perception that has had the most impact. Whether during the inversion experiment <b>people</b> <b>really</b> see an upside-down world as being normal, or whether they adapt to it only behaviorally, has been debated for a long time. Neuroimaging studies done a century after the original experiment have shown no difference in early levels of visual processing, which indicates the perceptual world stays inverted at that level of cognition. [...] The research has been put to use in both practical and esthetic ways. The mirror-experiment experience of disconnect between vision and feeling has parallels in, and applications for researching, phantom limb syndrome. [...] The art exhibit Upside-down Mushroom Room by Belgian artist Carsten Höller, a tunnel installation with an inverted environment, builds on Stratton's work.|$|E

Some in the crowd were hospitalized, and four police officers were injured. Almost everything in the Stonewall Inn was broken.

[...] Though it doesn't offer much in the way of DVD-specific features, the artistry of directors like Mark Romanek, Stephane Sedaoui, David Fincher, Jean-Baptiste Mondino, as well as Madonna herself, is on full display with videos like 'Take a Bow', 'Bedtime Story', 'Human Nature', 'Frozen', and 'Ray of Light'. All in all, it's a worthwhile collection of memorable videos from one of pop's trendsetters." [...] Bryan Chin from University Wire commented [...] "Some <b>people</b> <b>really</b> dislike the Madonna of the '90s. 'Oh, she got so slutty!, they quibble. 'She doesn't have the same kind of cultural impact that she had in the '80s,' they whine. Obviously, these people haven't been paying much attention. With the recent release of The Video Collection 93:99, however, those naysayers are certain to realize what they've been missing. These videos have always been the perfect outlet to chronicle Madonna's smorgasbord of personas." ...|$|E
500|$|Metallica {{opted for}} {{extensive}} touring instead of releasing a single or video {{to promote the}} album. Metallica spent March to August 1986 touring as the opening act for Ozzy Osbourne in the United States, the first tour Metallica played to arena-sized audiences. The group used to play Black Sabbath riffs during sound checks, which Osbourne perceived as a mockery toward him. Referring to that occasion, Ulrich stated that Metallica was honored to play with Osbourne, who treated the band well on the tour. Metallica was noted by the media for its excessive drinking habit while touring and earned the nickname [...] "Alcoholica". The band members occasionally wore satirical T-shirts reading [...] "Alcoholica/Drank 'Em All". The band usually played a 45-minute set often followed by an encore. According to Ulrich, the audiences in bigger cities were already familiar with Metallica's music, unlike in the smaller towns they've visited. [...] "In the B-markets, <b>people</b> <b>really</b> don't know what we're all about. But after 45 or 50 minutes we can tell we've won them over. And fans who come to hear Ozzy go home liking Metallica." [...] Metallica won over Osbourne's fans and slowly began to establish a mainstream following.|$|E
500|$|On his {{reliance}} on PayPal donations, Adams {{says he is}} content since he feels that <b>people</b> <b>really</b> like his work or they would not pay. Adams said that donations remain stable except during a new version update, {{where there is a}} sudden increase. Their expenses being low, he has maintained that he is happy as long as the game is self-sustaining and will not charge for it. In 2011, Adams refused a job offer from an unspecified major game developer and a $300,000 deal to license the name Dwarf Fortress from another company. Adams felt that this amount would not equate to long-term donations and that he prefers working on his own—not being part of the gaming industry. Adams said, [...] "Barely in the black one month, a little in the red another month. ... It's a risk I'm willing to take, and really I couldn't have it any other way." [...] He has spent no money on advertising and was happy when bloggers, reviewers like former game journalist Kieron Gillen from PC Gamer and Games for Windows, wrote about his game.
