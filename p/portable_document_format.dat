25|$|A {{key part}} of the Cocoa {{architecture}} is its comprehensive views model.

Since the Cocoa framework manages all the clipping, scrolling, scaling and other chores of drawing graphics, the programmer is freed from implementing basic infrastructure and can concentrate on the unique aspects of an application's content.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The binding of {{regulatory}} proteins to their specific DNA targets determines the accurate {{expression of the}} neighboring genes. The in silico prediction of new binding sites in completely sequenced genomes is a key aspect in the deeper understanding of gene regulatory networks. Several algorithms have been described to discriminate against false-positives in the prediction of new binding targets; however none of them has been implemented so far to assist the detection of binding sites at the genomic scale. Results FITBAR (Fast Investigation Tool for Bacterial and Archaeal Regulons) is a web service designed to identify new protein binding sites on fully sequenced prokaryotic genomes. This tool consists in a workbench where {{the significance of the}} predictions can be compared using different statistical methods, a feature not found in existing resources. The Local Markov Model and the Compound Importance Sampling algorithms have been implemented to compute the P-value of newly discovered binding sites. In addition, FITBAR provides two optimized genomic scanning algorithms using either log-odds or entropy-weighted position-specific scoring matrices. Other significant features include the production of a detailed genomic context map for each detected binding site and the export of the search results in spreadsheet and <b>portable</b> <b>document</b> <b>formats.</b> FITBAR discovery of a high affinity Escherichia coli NagC binding site was validated experimentally in vitro as well as in vivo and published. Conclusions FITBAR was developed in order to allow fast, accurate and statistically robust predictions of prokaryotic regulons. This feature constitutes the main advantage of this web tool over other matrix search programs and does not impair its performance. The web service is available at [URL]. </p...|$|R

25|$|Much of {{the work}} that went into {{developing}} OpenStep was applied to developing Mac OS X, Cocoa being the most visible part. However, differences exist. For example, NeXTSTEP and OpenStep used Display PostScript for on-screen display of text and graphics, while Cocoa depends on Apple's Quartz (which uses the <b>Portable</b> <b>Document</b> <b>Format</b> (PDF) imaging model, but not its underlying technology). Cocoa also has a level of Internet support, including the NSURL and WebKit HTML classes, and others, while OpenStep had only rudimentary support for managed network connections via NSFileHandle classes and Berkeley sockets.|$|E
25|$|The {{increasing}} automation of {{the crystal}} structure determination process has resulted in ever higher publishing rates of new crystal structures and, consequentially, new publishing models. Minimalistic articles contain only crystal structure tables, structure images, and, possibly, abstract-like structure description. They tend {{to be published in}} author-financed or subsidized open-access journals. Acta Crystallographica Section E and Zeitschrift f√ºr Kristallographie belong in this category. More elaborate contributions may go to traditional subscriber-financed journals. Hybrid journals, on the other hand, embed individual author-financed open-access articles among subscriber-financed ones. Publishers may also make scientific articles available online, as <b>Portable</b> <b>Document</b> <b>Format</b> (PDF) files.|$|E
25|$|The human {{interface}} guidelines published by Apple for macOS {{are followed by}} many applications, giving them consistent user interface and keyboard shortcuts. In addition, new services for applications are included, which include spelling and grammar checkers, special characters palette, color picker, font chooser and dictionary; these global features are present in every Cocoa application, adding consistency. The graphics system OpenGL composites windows onto the screen to allow hardware-accelerated drawing. This technology, introduced in version 10.2, is called Quartz Extreme, a component of Quartz. Quartz's internal imaging model correlates well with the <b>Portable</b> <b>Document</b> <b>Format</b> (PDF) imaging model, {{making it easy to}} output PDF to multiple devices. As a side result, PDF viewing and creating PDF documents from any application are built-in features. Reflecting its popularity with design users, macOS also has system support for a variety of professional video and image formats and includes an extensive pre-installed font library, featuring many prominent brand-name designs.|$|E
40|$|AbstractHistorical {{document}} restoration {{has always}} been a challenging need for information acquisition and conversion to a stable and <b>portable</b> <b>format.</b> <b>Document</b> image binarization, is an important pre-processing phase in document image analysis and processing of such historical documents. It has never been an easy task accounting to the difficulty in choosing a threshold value when the document image suffers from noises due present in the original document due to its degradation, ageing of the paper, other unwanted impurities, background images, bleed-through, and so on. Inconsistency {{in the darkness of the}} letters in handwritten documents adds to the difficulty. Though there are many algorithms that have been proposed for document image binarization, there has not been an effective algorithm which can efficiently binarize all kind of documents. In this paper we introduce a novel method to perform document image binarization using bit-plane slicing. As per this approach, the 8 bit planes of the gray image are extracted and processed separately, at the end of which, the results are combined to give the final binarized output. This method works well for all kinds of historical documents except those with both, less noise and low contrast...|$|R
