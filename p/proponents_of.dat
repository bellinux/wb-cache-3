40|$|In 1632, Galileo Galilei wrote a {{book called}} Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems which {{compared}} the new Copernican model of the universe with the old Ptolemaic model.

In this paper, I am going to use Galileo's idea to present a dialogue between three modern philosophers, Mr. Spock, a <b>proponent</b> <b>of</b> the view that P≠NP, Professor Simpson, a <b>proponent</b> <b>of</b> the view that P = NP, and Judge Wapner, who is initially open-minded and neutral.
