50|$|Spicara is a genus of <b>picarels</b> {{native to}} the eastern Atlantic Ocean and the western Indian Ocean.|$|E
50|$|Like other stargazers, it is {{an ambush}} {{predator}} which lies buried under sand with only its eyes showing. It has a large mouth, with a small strip of skin protruding from its lower jaw, which it moves in and out rapidly {{to act as a}} lure for prey. When a prey item comes near, the fish lunges toward the prey using a specially adapted vertebral column to generate the force by bending 60°, which takes less than 30 milliseconds to engulf the prey. It feeds primarily on fish larvae and smaller fishes, such as gobies, <b>picarels,</b> and small crustaceans, but has also been known to eat molluscs, echinoderms, annelids, algae and plant material.|$|E

40|$|The {{recognition}} and {{identification of the}} two species of Spicara genus (Spicara flexuosa, <b>picarel</b> and Spicara maena, blotched <b>picarel)</b> is difficult, due to a systematic confusion until now. In the present work a number of external morphometric features (ten body ratios) are evaluated for their diagnostic possibilities. According to Principal Component Analysis results, the body ratios head length to standard length, head height to head length and the ratios of two body heights, indicated that these characters were {{not related to the}} maturity stage of the species. The discriminant analysis based on the above body ratios, indicated rather high level of discrimination (83. 2 %) of the examined samples in two species.

To this end, the relationships between two types of natural bait and catch per unit effort (CPUE), yield per unit effort (YPUE), fish size and condition (K=W/TL 3) were evaluated in recreational fishery İzmir Bay (Middle Eastern Aegean Sea, Turkey). The most abundant angling species in Turkish coasts; annular sea bream (Diplodus annularis), blotched <b>picarel</b> (Spicara flexuosa), two banded sea bream (Diplodus vulgaris) and bogue (Boops boops) were collected by anglers between September 2006 – February 2007 with using baits; onyx (Solen vagina), and sardine (Sardina pilchardus). The average CPUE and YPUE of hooks baited with onyx were significantly higher than the bait sardine. Eventhough the averages of specimens caught with bait sardine were bigger than onyx except for bogue but, total length-frequency distributions were revealed some differences only for annular sea bream and blotched <b>picarel</b> between two baits.

50|$|Spicara smaris {{grows to}} a maximum length of 20 cm but a more common maximum size is 15 cm. It is a more slender fish than the closely related blotched <b>picarel</b> (Spicara maena) and can be {{distinguished}} from that species by having 75-81 scales along the lateral line rather than 68-70. Its back is grey-brown and it has silvery flanks with a large black spot located above {{the tip of the}} pectoral fin. Male fish are usually larger than females and have small blue spots scattered across the dorsal and anal fins.|$|R

40|$|We {{analysed}} {{data collected}} on board commercial purse seine {{vessels in the}} Aegean and Ionian Seas (eastern Mediterranean Sea, Greece) in 13 seasonal sampling periods from 2003 to 2008 in order to describe {{the composition of the}} retained and discarded catch and shed light on discarding practices. In each area, five species constituted the majority of the marketable catch (> 97 %) : sardine (Sardina pilchardus), anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus), round sardinella (Sardinella aurita), bogue (Boops boops) (in both areas), mackerel (Scomber japonicus; in the Aegean Sea) and <b>picarel</b> (Spicara smaris; in the Ionian Sea). Discarded quantities were on average 4. 6 % and 2. 2 % of the total catch in terms of weight in the Aegean and Ionian Seas respectively. Discards on the marketable ratio fluctuated over years and seasons without showing any particular trend. At the species level, sardine and mackerel were seldom discarded while large amounts of anchovy were discarded only during its recruitment period (autumn), when juvenile fish dominate the population. The discarding ratio for bogue, <b>picarel</b> and round sardinella ranged from zero to total discarding because they constitute a supplementary source of income for the fishers. Discarded fish comprised mainly small individuals for all species considered with the exception of round sardinella. However, the lengths at which 50 % of the individuals were discarded were generally small, often smaller than the species minimum landing sizes. Geographical coordinates and marketable catch explained part of the variability of the discarded quantities, as revealed by generalized additive models. Discarding practices and implications for management of purse seine fisheries are also discussed...|$|R
50|$|Spicara maena is {{a fairly}} deep-bodied fish, with males {{reaching}} a maximum length of about 25 cm and females 21 cm. The upper jaw is protrusible and the mouth contains several rows of small teeth. The single dorsal fin has eleven spines and twelve soft rays and the anal fin has three spines and nine or ten soft rays. There are sixty-eight to seventy scales on the lateral line. This fish is blue-grey above with silvery sides and a scattering of small dark spots. There is usually one large dark blotch above {{the tip of the}} pectoral fin. Spicara maena is a rather variable species. It has many synonyms across its wide range and is often confused with the common <b>picarel</b> Spicara smaris.|$|R
40|$|The {{volatile}} compounds {{of highly}} commercialised fresh Mediterranean seafood species, including seven fish (sand-smelt Atherina boyeri, <b>picarel</b> Spicara smaris, hake Merluccius merluccius, pilchard Sardina pilchardus, bogue Boobps boops, anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus and striped-mullet Mullus barbatus), squid (Loligo vulgaris), shrimp (Parapenaeus longirostris) and mussel (Mytilus galloprovincialis), {{were evaluated by}} simultaneous steam distillation-extraction and subsequent GC-MS analysis. A total of 298 volatile compounds were detected. The mussels contained the highest total concentration of volatile compounds, while pilchard among fish species contained the highest number and concentrations of volatile compounds. Individual patterns of volatile compounds have been distinguished. The fish species {{when compared to the}} shellfish species studied, contained 6 to 30 times more 1 -penten- 3 -ol, higher quantities of 2 -ethylfuran, and 2, 3 -pentanedione, which was absent from the shellfish species. Pilchard is characterized by a high concentration of alcohols, shrimps by the high presence of amines and S-compounds, while mussels by high amounts of aldehydes, furans, and N-containing compounds (pyridine, pyrazines and pyrrols).

It was found that, age composition of blotched <b>picarel</b> varied from I to IV and they were composed of 78. 12 % females and 21. 88 % males. The measured mean total length and mean weight values for females, males and combined sexes were 9. 682. 36 cm- 11. 42 ± 8. 61 g, 13. 641. 40 cm- 29. 20 ± 9. 54 g and 10. 552. 74 cm- 15. 31 ± 11. 48 g respectively.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{an effort to}} build a biologically realistic, age structured Bayesian model for the stock assessment of data poor fisheries where only aggregated catch data is available. The model is built using prior information from other areas and ecologically or taxonomically similar species. The modeling approach is tested with data poor fisheries on the Cyclades islands in Greek archipelago. The two most important species {{in the area are}} selected: bogue (Boops boops) and <b>picarel</b> (Spicara smaris). Both are hermaphroditic. The only data available is the total catch from 1950 to 2010. Information was gathered about natural mortality, recruitment, growth, body size, fecundity, and sex ratio. There were significant problems in finding reliable prior information and a uniform prior was used for fishing mortality. The models at their present stage are not used to give management advice. The biological characteristics of the species in that area should be further studied. However, the posteriors of biological parameters reflect the best available knowledge on these species and they could be used in future studies or in simpler biomass dynamics models as priors...|$|R
40|$|Although {{boat seines}} have a {{significant}} share in the total fish landings in Greece, there is little information on boat seine fisheries. The present study aims to identify boat seine métiers {{on a national level}} and contribute {{to a better understanding of}} their operation in Greece. We used boat seine landings data collected from a large number of ports in the Aegean and east Ionian Sea between 2002 and 2006. The landings profiles were grouped with a two-step procedure: the first step involved a factorial analysis of the log-transformed landings profiles, and the second step was a classification of the factorial coordinates (hierarchical agglomerative clustering). Six métiers were identified in the Aegean Sea, and three in the Ionian Sea. The ‘picarel-bogue’ métier was the most important in both seas, accounting for 54 % and 88 % of the fishing trips of the sample in the Aegean and Ionian Seas respectively. Apart from <b>picarel</b> and bogue, other important target species were red mullet, European squid, common pandora, chub mackerel, and European pilchard. Varying spatial (within the Aegean and Ionian Seas) and seasonal patterns were evident for the identified métiers...|$|R
40|$|A {{fleet of}} 326 bottom {{trawlers}} operate in Greek Seas and their landings represent approximately 30 % {{of the total}} fish production in Greece. In this study, otter trawl landings data were analyzed {{in order to identify}} potential métiers. Landings data between 2002 and 2006 were used, collected from 42 ports in the Aegean and East Ionian Sea. A three-step procedure was applied to identify potential métiers: the first step involved a factorial analysis of the log-transformed landings profiles, the second step a classification of the factorial coordinates, and the third step a further aggregation of clusters based on expert knowledge. In all, six potential métiers were identified in the Aegean Sea, and five in the Ionian Sea. The most important target species were European hake (Merluccius merluccius), deepwater pink shrimp (Parapenaeus longirostris), red mullet (Mullus barbatus), caramote prawn (Melicertus kerathurus), <b>picarel</b> (Spicara smaris), cephalopods, bogue (Boops boops), anglers (Lophiusspp.), and Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus). Otter trawls in Greece use {{more or less the same}} gear with minor modification, and métier selection is basically reflected as a choice of geographical sub-area and hauling depth. The limitations of using landings profiles to identify métiers and the need for further verification are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Growth and {{reproduction}} of the blotched <b>picarel,</b> Spicara maena (Linnaeus, 1758), were determined based on specimens (n = 2547) collected from the central Aegean Sea between July 2004 and June 2007. The samples consisted of 71. 9 % females, 16. 2 % males, and 11. 9 % immature individuals. The sex ratio of females to males was 1 : 0. 23. The length-weight relationship was W = 0. 011 L 3. 02, W = 0. 011 L 3. 00, and W = 0. 011 L 2. 99 for the combined sexes, females, and males, respectively. For all samples and both sexes the length-weight relationship showed isometric growth. The von Bertalanffy growth equation was fitted {{on the basis of}} mean length-at-age data, resulting in parameter values of L ∞ = 21. 99 cm, k = 0. 255 year- 1, and to =- 1. 165 year, and weight at infinity (W∞) was calculated as 123. 35 g. Length at first maturity was 8. 1 cm in males and 8. 5 cm in females. On the other hand, first reproduction length was 11. 51 cm and 13. 12 cm for females and males, respectively, both corresponding to 2 years of age.

Four different mesh sizes for the gill nets and the inner panel of trammel nets (16, 18, 20 and 22 mm bar length) were used. Selectivity parameters for the five most economically important species, bogue (Boops boops), annular sea bream (Diplodus annularis), striped red mullet (Mullus surmuletus), axillary sea bream (Pagellus acarne) and blotched <b>picarel</b> (Spicara maena), caught by the two gears were estimated. The SELECT method was used to estimate the selectivity parameters {{of a variety of}} models. Catch composition and catch proportion of several species were different in gill and trammel nets. The length frequency distributions of the species caught by the two gears were significantly different. The bi-modal model selectivity curve gave the best fit for gill net and trammel net data, and there was little difference between the modal lengths of these nets. However, a clear difference was found in catching efficiency. The highest catch rates were obtained with the trammel net. Given that many discard species and small fish are caught by gill nets and trammel nets with a mesh size of 16 mm, it is clear that these nets are not appropriate for fisheries. Consequently, the best mesh size for multispecies fisheries is 18 mm. This mesh size will considerably reduce the numbers of small sized individuals and discard species in the catch...|$|R
40|$|The {{demersal}} trawl fishery of {{the north}} Tunisian coast primarily targets the deep-water rose shrimp, Parapenaeus longirostris, and secondarily a variety of demersal fish species. These fishes include hake (Merluccius merluccius), common pandora (Pagellus erythrinus), red mullet (Mullus barbatus), surmullet (Mullus surmuletus), Atlantic horse mackerel (Trachurus trachurus), bogue (Boops boops), <b>picarel</b> (Spicara smaris) and spotted flounder (Citharus linguatula). A bioeconomic model {{was used to test}} management measures through scenarios that ran over eleven years to estimate the viability of the fishery according to biological and economic results. The most beneficial scenario was the combination of several management measures including a temporal closure of two months, the replacement of the 40 mm diamond mesh codend with 40 mm square mesh, the removal of both the biological recovery tax and of fuel subsidies, and an 83 % reduction in fishing capacity. This results in an annual private profit higher by 9. 3 M TND (Tunisian Dinar) (6. 9 M USD) that of 2008, and an economic rent that was higher by 13. 3 M TND (9. 9 M USD) than {{by the end of the}} projected period. Shrimp and fish biomasses have doubled compared with 2008, and trawling damages would be reduced to the equivalent of a five- fold reduction in fishing effort.

40|$|An {{oceanographic survey}} {{was carried out}} {{during the summer of}} 2009, from June 25 to July 3 in the Gulf of Gabes. The study area is {{characterized}} by a wide continental shelf. A plankton sampling scheme was carried out to study the structure of the larval fish assemblages that characterizes the surface mixed layer, and to assess the influence of the environmental parameters on their spatial distribution. A total of 36 taxa were identified, 3 classified to the level of genus, 5 to family and 28 to species. The majority of identified fish larvae belonged to demersal species, mainly <b>picarel</b> Spicara smaris (23. 76 % of the total larval fish abundance), followed by red mullet Mullus barbatus (14. 92 %) and several species of the Sparidae family (9. 15 %). Small pelagic species as Sardinella Sardinella aurita and European anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus were also abundant (27. 75 %) and dominated the fish larvae community in offshore stations. Five large pelagic species were found among the larvae, including bullet tuna Auxis rochei, Atlantic black skipjack Euthynnus alletteratus, albacore Thunnus alalunga, swordfish Xiphias gladius and the highly migratory Atlantic bluefin tuna Thunnus thynnus. All these apex predator species appear in 38. 5 % of the sampling stations and contribute about 7. 9 % of the total larval catches. The larval fish assemblage of the Gulf of Gabes is predominantly composed of neritic species in correspondence with the shallow depths of the study area. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) showed that larval distributions were mainly conditioned by depth. However, other factors, like hydrographic processes, play also a very important role in shaping the spatial pattern of larval fish distribution...|$|R
40|$|The marine {{recreational}} fishing (MRF) {{represents one of}} the most popular activities along the coasts of numerous countries around the world, in particular in the Mediterranean Sea. Despite the evidences of potential effects on the marine biodiversity and commercially exploited stocks, a sound information base and adequate management plans are still lacking, both at the national and basin level. An analysis of the MRF on the West coasts of the Adriatic Sea was carried out, in 2014, by using a standardized questionnaires approach, aiming to describe the state of the art and to preliminarily assess catches, in comparison with the commercial ones, at the regional scale. Gilt-headed seabream, European seabass, cuttlefish, squid and Atlantic bluefin tuna resulted the anglers' preferred species, even if the top five in term of caught biomass were bluefin tuna, seabream, cuttlefish, common dolphinfish and little tunny, in the order (accounting up to 60 % of total catches). The exploitation level resulted to be significant, as confirmed by the comparison with commercial fisheries, being the MRF captures 30 % or 45 % of the artisanal fishery in the same area, with some species, such as bluefish, bonito, pandora and <b>picarel,</b> showing larger values. The preliminary assessment of ecological effects, highlighted that the exploitation use about 10 %- 16 % of energy fixed by the primary production (Primary Production Required to sustain fishery), but the ecosystem effects are still sustainable (Lindex and probability to be sustainable fished).

In 15 % of frost fish, in 42 % of skate and in 30 % of angler fish samples total mercury concentrations exceeded the maximum level fixed by the European Commission (Hg = 1 microg g(- 1) wet wt); for the species for which the maximum level was set to 0. 5 microg g(- 1) wet wt, concentrations exceeding the prescribed legal limit were observed in 6. 4 % of bokkem, in 6. 6 % of pandora, in 20 % of megrin, in 12. 5 % of four-spotted megrim, in 16 % of striped mullet, in 5. 0 % of forkbeard and in 5. 3 % of <b>picarel</b> samples.

40|$|The {{economic}} and harvest impacts of Marine Recreational Fishing (MRF) in Çanakkale Strait were analysed along with fishing policy, sociology and habits of fishers. Data sources included field survey data carried {{out along the}} entire length of the Çanakkale strait and policy information gathered from published sources. MRF policy is commendable, even in the fishing tourism sector, and is better developed than that in many other European countries. In Çanakkale, 9. 9 % of the population is recreational fishers. Recreational fishers are typically men (90 %), primarily those between the ages of 25 and 49 yrs. The occupation of the recreational fishers ranged from self-employed (28 %), students (28 %), retired persons (22 %) and public employees (15 %), to currently-unemployed persons (7 %). An analysis of diel behaviour showed that most recreational fishers preferred fishing during the day (56. 1 %), while the evening was the next most preferred time for fishing (18 %), followed by the night-time (9. 8 %), while a substantial number of recreational fishers (16. 1 %) reported that they fished at any time of day. The most popular type of fishing was shore-based (68 %), followed by boat-based (21 %), and underwater fishing (11 %). The mean daily fishing times were 6. 07 h d- 1, 6. 18 h d- 1 4. 75 d- 1 for boat-based, underwater and shore-based fishing, respectively. Summer and autumn were the preferred seasons for shore-based and underwater fishing, while autumn and winter were preferred for boat-based fishing. The highest Catch per Unit Effort (CPUE) was observed for boat-based fishing (2. 77 kg h- 1), followed by underwater (0. 97 kg h- 1) and shore-based fishing (0. 81 kg h- 1). The catch composition included 51 species, though the catch composition of each fishing type was mostly comprised of only 3 or 4 species. The impact of the MRF harvest was high (30 % of commercial fishing), particularly for bluefish (Pomatomus saltatrix) and <b>picarel</b> (Spicara smaris) species. The economic impact of MRF was highly negative. Several indicators including the following revealed a high percentage of trading catch (47 %) being conducted under the guise of a recreational label: annual fishing intensity, total costs, target species, and sales. At present, it is evident that the highly developed recreational fishing policy in Turkey is not sufficient to ensure that recreational fishing is sustainable or to prevent fishing conflicts in Turkey. This study revealed the need for establishing monitoring, control and surveillance programs to ensure the sustainability of fish resources and fisheries including MRF...|$|R
