5|$|Their dactyli are {{powerful}} and curved into a scimitar-like shape. The second pair of gnathopods are densely covered in hair-like setae {{while the first}} pair only has setae on the posterior margins. The third and fourth pereopods are absent. In their <b>place</b> <b>are</b> two pairs of elongated oval gills arising from {{the third and fourth}} pereonites, respectively. In mature females, two brood pouches also develop in the third and fourth pereonites. These are formed by oostegites – platelike expansions from the basal segments (coxae) of the appendages. The fifth to seventh pereopods function as clasping appendages. They all have propodi with two spines on their inside margins. The seventh pair of pereopods are the longest of the three pairs, followed by the sixth pereopod pair and the fifth pereopod pair.|$|E

40|$|Road litters were {{collected}} by the present author on the city road in Okayama University, which were analyzed by students in the lectures of "Science Education in Elementary School" and "Science Education in Secondary School" in 1988 and 1992. The total 1941 litters {{were collected}} and analyzed. Of these, ones of 1562 (80. 5 %) were burnable litters, ones of 379 (19. 5 %) were unburnable metal/tiles and plastic goods. In burnable litters, the first <b>place</b> <b>was</b> the tobacco and relevant goods of 58. 8 %. The second <b>place</b> <b>was</b> the paper chip/propaganda bill/printed matter of 17. 4 %. The third <b>place</b> <b>was</b> the candybag/paperbag of 9. 9 %. The fourth <b>place</b> <b>was</b> the chewing gum/its envelope of 6. 3 %. The fifth <b>place</b> <b>was</b> the sanitary/medical supplies of 4. 9 %. The sixth <b>place</b> <b>was</b> the paper cup/paper package of 2. 6 %. The rest was of 1. 0 %. In unburnable litters, the first <b>place</b> <b>was</b> the empty can/bottle of 45. 6 %. The second <b>place</b> <b>was</b> the package of 36. 6 %. The third <b>place</b> <b>was</b> the accessory on a candy of 7. 4 %. The fourth <b>place</b> <b>was</b> the iron/aluminum goods/tile of 5. 5 %. The fifth <b>place</b> <b>was</b> the stationery goods/sport goods of 3. 4 %. The rest was of 2. 6 %. We could arouse student's interest in not only road litters but also in environmental issues. Environmental ethic education should be carried out-no smoking/ not throwaway cigarette and paper/plastic goods...|$|R

25|$|Objects {{considered}} for inclusion on the NRHP, whether individually or {{as part of}} districts, should be designed for a specific location; objects such as transportable sculpture, furniture, and other decorative arts that lack a specific <b>place</b> <b>are</b> discouraged. Fixed outdoor sculpture, an example of public art, is appropriate for inclusion on the Register. The setting of an object is important in relation to the Register. It should be appropriate to its significant historical use, roles, or character. In addition, objects that have been relocated to museums are not {{considered for}} inclusion on the Register.|$|E
25|$|The {{sanctuary}} is entered {{from the}} east by a doorway only 1.08 m in height: inside is an entrance chamber (or maṇḍapa) with a corbelled brick roof, then a short corridor leading to three towers to the west: the central tower is the tallest, at 9.8 m. Glaize notes the impression of delicacy given the towers by the antefixes on each of their tiers. The six stairways {{leading up to the}} platform were each guarded by two kneeling statues of human figures with animal heads; most of those now in <b>place</b> <b>are</b> replicas, the originals having been stolen or removed to museums.|$|E
25|$|Places where {{large-scale}} sedimentation takes <b>place</b> <b>are</b> called sedimentary basins. The {{amount of}} sediment {{that can be}} deposited in a basin depends on {{the depth of the}} basin, the so-called accommodation space. The depth, shape and size of a basin depend on tectonics, movements within the Earth's lithosphere. Where the lithosphere moves upward (tectonic uplift), land eventually rises above sea level, so that and erosion removes material, and the area becomes a source for new sediment. Where the lithosphere moves downward (tectonic subsidence), a basin forms and sedimentation can take place. When the lithosphere keeps subsiding, new accommodation space keeps being created.|$|E

Near the restrooms behind Berry <b>Place</b> <b>are</b> the waterfall overshooting the water wheel and historic gristmill grindstone, a replica of George Washington's Mount Vernon estate fireplace hearth, and what remains of the visible beehive. Some attractions still exist, but have been incorporated into backstage areas, such as the Rock Garden, now an employee smoking area. Other attractions have been removed, such as the historic volcano, and the cross-section of giant sequoia with age rings denoting historic events such as Christopher Columbus visiting America.|$|E
25|$|Three game modes are {{included}} with the game, with two more available via downloadable content. The first game mode, Power Race, is a hybrid of both racing and combat. Players can collect powerups to give their planes different abilities. These abilities include such things as missiles, machine guns, mines, or an EMP blast. The goal is to use whatever means necessary to achieve the highest finishing rank {{at the end of}} a given race. The second mode is focused solely on racing. Entitled Speed Race, this mode omits all weapons and powerups. In their <b>place</b> <b>are</b> rings scattered throughout the course. Flying through these rings provides the plane with an extra burst of speed, and flying through multiple in succession will multiply that speed. As with Power Race the goal is to finish the race in as high a rank as possible.|$|E
25|$|London has {{proposed}} Games based on providing world-class facilities {{and services for}} the athletes, and a legacy for sport and the community. Whilst the Olympic Park would undoubtedly leave a strong sporting and environmental legacy for London, {{the magnitude of the}} project, including the planned upgrade and expansion of transport infrastructure, would require careful planning to ensure all facilities and rehabilitation projects were completed on time. Air quality in London at proposed Games-time is generally satisfactory. Increasing levels of ozone pollution are however a concern, but legislation and actions now in <b>place</b> <b>are</b> aimed at correcting that trend. With its rich history, the capacities of UK Paralympic Sport are {{among the best in the}} world. Athletes have been closely involved in the planning of the Olympic Village.
