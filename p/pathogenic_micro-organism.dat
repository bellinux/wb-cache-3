Three different materials, stainless steel (SS), glass (G), and polystyrene (PS) that were relevant to industrial or medical environments were characterized at the physicochemical level in terms of their hydrophobicity and roughness. We showed that SS was moderately hydrophilic and rough, potentially containing crevices, G was hydrophilic and smooth while PS was hydrophobic and smooth. We further showed that P. aeruginosa cells were more likely able to adhere to SS and G rather than PS surfaces under our experimental conditions. The physiological response of P. aeruginosa when adhering to each of these materials was then evaluated by global proteomic analysis. The abundance of 70 proteins was shown to differ between the materials suggesting that their abundance was modified as a function of the material to which bacteria adhered.

Immune system dysregulation during and immediately following space missions is extensively reported. Solar and galactic radiation are among the major environmental factors which increase the risk of infection during extended stays of humans outside the Earth’s magnetic field. It has been reported that in addition to the effects on the host immune system, decreased antibiotic potency and enhanced microbial virulence are outcomes of long-term space flights. In long-time space missions, the probability of transformation of the neutral microorganisms into the harmful ones can pose a threat to astronauts’ health. In a widely cited publication, we suggested that for a deep space mission the adaptive response of all potential crew members be measured and only those with high adaptive response be chosen. We hypothesised that chronic exposure to elevated levels of radiation can considerably decrease radiation susceptibility of the selected astronauts and better protect astronauts against the unpredictable exposure to solar flares and coronal mass ejections. On the other hand, the results obtained in our recent studies indicate that exposure of laboratory animals to radiofrequency radiations emitted from a common mobile phone can induce a survival adaptive response as increased survival rate at a specific time after exposure to a <b>pathogenic</b> <b>micro-organism.</b> We recently indicated that pre-exposure of mice to radiofrequency radiations emitted from a GSM mobile phone (GSM, global system for mobile communications) increased their resistance to a subsequent Escherichia coli infection.

Exacerbations are associated with increased airway and systemic inflammation. This thesis examines {{the relationship between the}} infective and inflammatory changes at exacerbation of COPD and clinical non-recovery and recurrence of exacerbations. Patients were recruited from the London COPD cohort and sampled prospectively in the stable state, at exacerbation and after 7, 14 and 35 days. Clinical indices, airway and systemic inflammation and lower airway bacteria were analysed at each visit. Airway inflammation was assessed by sputum interleukin (IL) - 6 and IL- 8 levels, systemic inflammation was assessed by circulating leucocytes, serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and IL- 6. Sputum bacteria were assessed by standard cultures and quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qr-PCR). The key findings were: 1) the persistence of heightened airway and systemic inflammation was associated with clinical non-recovery at exacerbation, 2) a higher level of serum CRP 14 days after an exacerbation was associated with a recurrent exacerbation within 50 days, 3) frequent exacerbators have reduced response to therapy and persistently high systemic inflammation compared' to infrequent exacerbators, 4) the presence of a significant relationship between the lower airway bacterial load and circulating leucocytes in stable COPD and 6) the detection of a potentially <b>pathogenic</b> <b>micro-organism</b> from sputum samples is higher by qr-PCR than by standard cultures. These new findings could form the basis of future therapeutic interventions and strategies for prevention of recurrent exacerbations.

Finally refining the qr-PCR assay may help elucidate the complex links between lower airway bacteria and inflammation in COPD. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

40|$|Streptococcus mutans is an eubacterial <b>pathogenic</b> <b>micro-organism</b> {{involved}} {{in the development of}} dental caries. It grows either in aerobic or anaerobic conditions, even though its energetic metabolism is anaerobic, as the ATP synthesis almost exclusively depends on glycolysis. Because of a missing aerobic respiration, the bacterium lacks cytochromes and enzyme systems {{involved in}} the control of oxidative stress, such as catalase. However, the bacterium possesses superoxide dismutase (SOD), the key enzyme involved in scavenging superoxide anions. The previous studies did not clearly indicate whether such SOD belongs to the cambialistic SOD family, functioning with iron or manganese, a feature possibly related to the adaptation at different growth conditions tolerated by this micro-organism. Recently, the genome of Streptococcus mutans has been sequenced (1), and besides the SOD gene, other genes {{involved in the}} control of the intracellular redox potential were identified, namely thioredoxin (Trx) and thioredoxin reductase (TrxR). The strategy followed for the characterization of these enzyme systems involved the heterologous production of recombinant forms of SOD, Trx and TrxR from S. mutans. To this aim, the coding sequences of the corresponding genes were amplified by PCR from the genome of S. mutans UA 159 and then cloned into a pET expression vector. The C-terminal residue of each gene product was fused to an exa-His-tag for the purification of the heterologous protein through Ni-Agarose affinity chromatography. The first recombinant enzyme obtained with this expression system was SOD from S. mutans (SmSOD). In particular, 20 mg of pure recombinant SmSOD were obtained from 1 L of bacterial culture. The recombinant enzyme was purified in an active form, as evaluated by its ability to inhibit the citochrome c reduction using the xanthine oxidase method for measuring SOD activity.

This Research was done with the goal of tracing possible causes of Fibrinous Serositis, by taking into consideration the Information of the flock of origin as well as the corresponding data at slaughter. In Course of the Study, 48. 000 male Turkeys of the meat hybrids BIG- 6 were observed regularly every four weeks during the fattening and afterwards from the meat inspection. The 10 chosen Turkey feedlots were split into two groups due to occurred cases of Fibrinous Serositis to date. The Living Turkeys were monitored with an examination sheet, which was divided into three sections, called the farm record. In Terms of the operating data, the data of the management and other factors including a clinical examination, there were differences between the herds of Group 1 and Group 2 regarding Stables (Size, etc.) Caretakers, Hygiene (change of clothes, Desinfection, Cleanliness of feeding tins), time between fattening periods, control measure of Alphitobius diaperinus, Concentration of Ammonia in the air, number of animals that died in the fattening and weight of the individual animals. Often it was just one flock that tipped the scale and made the difference to the other group. During the meat inspection, the differences between the surveyed Herds were able to be determined. Differences were found during the following parameters: - Number of animals that died in the fattening - Carcasses unfit for human consumption - Percentage of the carcasses which are unfit in respect to the number of Animals in the origin flock - Percentage of Turkeys displaying Fibrinous Serositis - Number of the Animals with breast blisters The selection that was made in respect to the Fibrinous Serositis was maintained. Summing up the husbandry conditions and taking into consideration the determined code, there is an explicit difference between the two groups. Group 1 has much better results to Fibrinous Serositis than Group 2. Two feedlots whose results differed severely were compared to determine the differences. The following differences were determined, and they should, if necessary, be examined further in future investigations: - distance of Stable to cadaver place - habits of clothes - changing of the caretakers - cleanliness of feeding tins - stocking density This leads to the conclusion, that the meat inspection do confirm the circumstances of fattening. This makes clear, that the Hygienic circumstances of the keeping of the animals is influential. If the abattoir files too many negative reports, an intervention is recommended and regarded helpful. Due to the differences between the groups, it is possible to give parameters, that could be seen as ways to determine the origins of Fibrinous Serositis. The following points are of special interest, taking into consideration the parameters that have shown differences between the two groups: - human caretaking - Hygiene - Time between fattening periods - (Concentration of Ammonia in the air) - Number of animals that died in the fattening It was found out, that the smallest possible differences can "open a window", or cause the spreading of facultative <b>pathogenic</b> <b>micro-organism.</b> The Studies have shown, that the general standard of Hygiene alone cannot be held responsible for Fibrinous Serositis, but that bad hygienic circumstances are perhaps beneficial to the origins of the disease. <br...|$|E

It also allows the (control of) microbial risks to be balanced against (the creation of) other risks, i. e. the formation of disinfection by-products. This method also gives, if an acceptable infection risk level is defined, a quantitative basis for designing treatment processes. This report also defines research needs for the effective implementation of quantitative risk analysis in this field in the Netherlands...|$|R
