The mathematical formalism describing the relationships between <b>projected</b> <b>beam</b> quantities and slice beam quantities is reviewed. The results may be used to reconstruct the moments and emittances of the beam from the moments of its subpopulations, as well as to isolate and better understand a variety of slice and interslice dynamical contributions to the <b>projected</b> <b>beam</b> emittance growth...|$|E

40|$|The LHC project, {{with its}} demand for small {{emittance}} beams and their monitoring, constitutes {{a challenge for}} the instruments of the CERN PS complex used hitherto to measure emittances of generally larger beams with less precision. Among these instruments, one (Beamscope) measures the betatron amplitude distribution, while the other two (SEM-grids, fast wire scanner) are recording the <b>projected</b> <b>beam</b> density. Emittances are quoted as derived from one standard width of the <b>projected</b> <b>beam</b> density, and {{the goal is to}} provide figures which refer to this definition regardless of the measurement instrument and method. The paper recalls the principles of these measurement systems and describes the mathematical methods applied to eliminate noise and measurement errors, to transform between the phase plane and its projection and the formalism used to determine the matching between machines...|$|E
30|$|The major {{challenge}} was to design an image processing algorithm that properly segmented the projected stripes. A simple threshold algorithm was not adequate. In fact, the video projector provided highly non-homogeneous illumination.

40|$|The {{quantitative}} analysis of beam radiation received on a solar concentrator may {{be understood by}} evaluating the projected solar height angle or profile angle along the north-south vertical plane. This means that all the sunrays projected along the north-south vertical plane will be intercepted by a collector provided the projection angle lies within the acceptance angle. The Meteonorm method of calculating solar radiation on any arbitrary oriented surface uses the globally simulated meteorological databases. Meteonorm has become a valuable too for estimating solar radiation where measured solar radiation data is missing or irregular. In this paper we present the <b>projected</b> <b>beam</b> solar radiation at low latitudes based on the standard Meteonorm calculations. The conclusion {{is that there is}} potential in using solar concentrators at these latitudes since the <b>projected</b> <b>beam</b> radiation is more during winter periods than in summer months. This conclusion is in conformity with the design principle of solar collectors for worst case conditions. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|The main linac of CLIC is {{designed}} to maximize the transportable bunch charge, since this parameter determines the energy efficiency of the CLIC accelerating structures. The bunch charge is limited by short-range wake field effects, which increase the <b>projected</b> <b>beam</b> emittance. For the main linac cost optimisation, {{it is important to}} understand how the charge limit scales with the change of the gradient of the accelerating structures. In this paper, we determine such a scaling law via simulations studies. It is shown that from different possible scenarios, the charge limit for a lower gradient CLIC structure scales advantageous and a relatively high charge can be used...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — We have {{developed}} the first real-time 3 -D image sensor with VGA pixel resolution using mixed-signal techniques to achieve high-speed and high-accuracy range calculation based on a light-section method. Our mixed-signal position detector, which consists of an adaptive threshold circuit and time-domain approximate ADCs, provides significant information for range finding quickly during high-speed analog-to-digital conversion. Moreover the position address and the intensity profile of a <b>projected</b> <b>beam</b> are selectively provided by the next digital stage to reduce data transmission. Our 3 -D imager also has a standard analog readout circuit to get a 2 -D image. Measurement results show that it achieves 65. 1 range maps/sec with 0. 87 mm range resolution at 1200 mm distance.

40|$|Following {{numerous}} {{interactions with}} the SPSC in 2007 we review projected capa- bilities of the COMPASS spectrometer {{in the field of}} light hadron spectroscopy. The paper describes in detail a full simulation with subsequent partial wave analysis of two final states for central production. Both, neutral and all charged states can very well be observed and analyzed within COMPASS. In addition we show the result of a full partial wave analysis of data taken in the pilot run 2004 using the diffractively produced π^+π^-π^- final state. The results agree remarkably well with previous data taken an BNL. We also vaticinate the physics data sample expected for 2008, using <b>projected</b> <b>beam</b> times for different reaction mechanisms...|$|E

System performance is quite sensitive to sodium layer spot radiance, that is, return per unit sterradian on the sky, hence we have been working to improve <b>projected</b> <b>beam</b> quality via improvements to the laser and changes to the launched beam format. The laser amplifier was reconfigured to a ''bounce-beam'' geometry, which considerably improves wavefront quality and allows a larger round instead of square launch beam aperture.

40|$|The head-tail {{instability}} {{caused by}} an electron cloud in positron storage rings is studied numerically using a simple model. In the model, the positron beam is longitudinally divided into many slices that have a fixed transverse size. The centroid of each slice evolves dynamically according to the interaction with a two-dimensional electron cloud at a given azimuthal location in the ring and a six-dimensional lattice map. A sudden and huge increase of the <b>projected</b> <b>beam</b> size and the mode coupling in the dipole spectrum are observed in the simulation {{at the threshold of}} the instability. Even below the threshold, the vertical beam size increases along a bunch train that has 8. 5 ns bunch spacing. Above the threshold, a positive chromaticity can damp down the centroid motion but has very little effect on the blowup of the beam size. The results of the simulation are consistent with many observations at PEP-II...|$|E
