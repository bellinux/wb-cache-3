30|$|One {{hundred and}} twenty five years later, {{in the era of}} Big Data, various {{statistical}} data are publicly available. The task of ensuring that security intensive information does not leak out becomes much more challenging. A modern man lives and works in a society oriented toward collecting and storing data on each and every person. Statistics services do that (census forms), taxing services do that (tax declarations), medical facilities do that (patient’s medical records), law enforcement agencies do that (person’s IDs), employers do that (CVs), retail stores do that (<b>personal</b> discount <b>cards),</b> <b>security</b> does that (security cameras files), {{and so on and so}} forth. Problems of preserving privacy in such data are widely discussed within the field of privacy-preserving data publishing (Fung et al. 2010; Wong and Fu 2010). To great extent, appropriate protection implies removing identifiers (passport data, full name etc.), and distorting the data (e.g., values of certain characteristics are swapped between respondents or get noised) or suppressing them (e.g., data on elder people are grouped in a category of senior citizens).|$|R
