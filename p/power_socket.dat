25|$|Because {{they were}} {{conceived}} in the 1980s, the trainsets had no <b>power</b> <b>sockets</b> available to travellers {{except for the}} conference compartment prior to the refurbishment. The few <b>power</b> <b>sockets</b> were placed in order to operate cleaning equipment and were usually disabled during the journey.|$|R

2500|$|Business Class was {{formerly}} known as Raffles Class until 2006. The latest version of the Business Class, the [...] "New" [...] Business Class, was unveiled on 9 July 2013 and is available on refitted Boeing B777-300ERs and the Airbus A350-900. [...] Features include <b>power</b> <b>socket</b> and ports all in one panel, stowage beside the seat, two new seating positions and an 18-inch in-flight entertainment screen. The seat has a recline of 132 degrees and can be folded into a [...] length bed.|$|E
2500|$|The {{previous}} generation Economy class seats on unrefitted Boeing 777-300ER, Airbus A380-800, and Airbus A330-300 are [...] wide, have in-seat power {{and have a}} 10.6-inch personal television screen which has a non-intrusive reading light under it, {{which can be used}} by folding the screen outwards. These are configured 3-4-3 on the lower deck of the Airbus A380, 3-3-3 on the Boeing 777, and 2-4-2 on the Airbus A330, as well as the upper deck of the Airbus A380.

2500|$|The home charger {{provided}} by GM, which {{was required for}} [...] "fast recharging" [...] of the car, measured roughly 1.5 by 2 by 5 feet (0.45 x 0.60 x 1.50 m), and featured integrated heatsinks and a resemblance to a gasoline pump. The charger refueled the car using induction, accomplished by inserting a Magne Charge paddle into the slot between the EV1's headlights. The wireless charging technology meant that no direct connection was made, and charging the car while it was raining did not pose any risks, though there were isolated incidents involving fires starting at the charge port. GM also offered a 120 V AC convenience charger {{that could be used}} with any standard North America <b>power</b> <b>socket</b> to slow-charge the battery pack. The convenience charger was not available for EV1s equipped with the NiMH battery packs. Installation of the device took between one and two weeks, at an additional average cost of $2500.|$|E

2500|$|The term plug is {{in general}} and {{technical}} use in all forms of English, common alternatives being power plug, [...] electric plug, and (in the UK) plug top. The normal technical term (in both British and International English) for an AC <b>power</b> <b>socket</b> is socket-outlet, but in non-technical contexts {{a number of other}} terms are in common use. In British English the general term is socket, but there are numerous common alternatives, including power point, plug socket, wall socket, and wall plug. In American English receptacle (which is a term not defined in IEC 60050) is used in official standards and codes such as the NEMA connector standard and the National Electrical Code. [...] The American National Electrical Contractors Association's National Electrical Installation Standards (NECA 130-2010) defines outlet as [...] "A point on the wiring system at which current is taken to supply utilization equipment." [...] In common use outlet is used to refer to the actual receptacle or socket, sometimes with qualifiers such as wall outlet, electrical outlet and electrical receptacle, all of these sometimes {{to be found in the}} same document. [...] There is also colloquial use of socket in American English.|$|E

Once fully depleted, the batteries can be completely recharged in 10 hours using a standard household <b>power</b> <b>socket</b> or in under 7 hours using a commercial <b>power</b> <b>socket.</b> In terms of cost and efficiency, for every 100 km the solar car would cost approximately $0.20 compared to the average $15 for conventional petrol powered cars.|$|E

25|$|At {{the time}} of commissioning, the conference {{compartment}} was equipped with a large table, four freely movable chairs, an electronic typewriter, a fax machine, a telephone and <b>power</b> <b>sockets.</b> It could be used with a reservation {{of at least three}} seats. Originally, first-class tickets were necessary. If there were no reservations in the conference compartment, it could be used at the head conductor's discretion. In 1992, demand was high: the conference compartments were booked 8197 times. A year later, that number dropped to 4400. Before the refurbishment program, the train's only <b>power</b> <b>sockets</b> for passengers were located in the conference compartment.|$|R

50|$|HybridPower, on {{the other}} hand, is another mode that is not for {{performance}} enhancement. The setup consists of an IGP {{as well as a}} GPU on MXM module. The IGP would assist the GPU to boost performance when the laptop is plugged to a <b>power</b> <b>socket</b> while the MXM module would be shut down when the laptop was unplugged from <b>power</b> <b>socket</b> to lower overall graphics power consumption. Hybrid SLI is also available on desktop Motherboards and PCs with PCI-E discrete video cards. NVIDIA claims that twice the performance can be achieved with a Hybrid SLI capable IGP motherboard and a GeForce 8400 GS video card.|$|E
