She averaged almost two movies a year throughout the decade, starting in 1960 with Tall Story, in which she recreated one of her Broadway roles as a college cheerleader pursuing a basketball star, played by Anthony Perkins. <b>Period</b> <b>of</b> <b>Adjustment</b> and Walk on the Wild Side followed in 1962.

Her first husband was Barbarella director Roger Vadim. A seven-time Academy Award nominee, she received her first nomination for They Shoot Horses, Don't They (1969) and went on to win two Best Actress Oscars in the 1970s for Klute (1971) and Coming Home (1978). Her other nominations were for Julia (1977), The China Syndrome (1979), On Golden Pond (1981) and The Morning After (1986).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore the main macroeconomic, {{financial}} and structural factors that influenced current account developments in the euro area countries over the period from 1980 to 2008. The analysis, which theoretically rests on the intertemporal approach, uses a panel consisting of the twelve EU member states that initially joined the euro area, which is then expanded to seventeen countries with the aim to see whether the enlargement or potential enlargement of the euro area would alter the identified set of current account determinants. The results show that factors such as the level of development, demographics, macroeconomic policies and competitiveness, are important in explaining current account positions of individual euro area countries. Moreover, the analysis of short-run dynamics indicates that the EMU has resulted in longer <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> current account imbalances. ...|$|R
25|$|In 1940, non-Hispanic whites {{constituted}} 86.8% of the city's population. The population {{peaked at}} {{more than two million}} residents in 1950, then began to decline with the restructuring of industry, which led to the loss of many middle-class union jobs. In addition, suburbanization had been drawing off many of the wealthier residents to outlying railroad commuting towns and newer housing. The economic impact of these changes would reduce Philadelphia's tax base and the resources of local government. Philadelphia struggled through a long <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> to these economic changes. The city in fact approached bankruptcy in the late 1980s. Revitalization and gentrification of neighborhoods began in the late 1970s and continues into the 21st century, with much of the development in the Center City and University City areas of the city. After many of the old manufacturers and businesses left Philadelphia or shut down, the city started attracting service businesses and began to more aggressively market itself as a tourist destination. Glass-and-granite skyscrapers were built in Center City. Historic areas such as Independence National Historical Park located in Old City and Society Hill were renovated during the reformist mayoral era of the 1950s through the 1980s. They are now among the most desirable living areas of Center City. This has slowed the city's 40-year population decline after it lost nearly one-quarter of its population.|$|E

Rignall and Penn complimented the challenging gameplay and commented that its addictiveness outweighed any frustration experienced while playing. The three summarized by urging readers to purchase the game. Computer Gamer reviewer Mike Roberts praised Spindizzys gameplay, but mentioned that the screen's orientation can require a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>adjustment,</b> particularly when using a joystick.

Phil South of Your Sinclair gave the game high marks for graphics, playability, value for money, and addictiveness. He praised the ability to change viewpoints and the realistic movements of the character sprite. He also lauded the speed and quality of the graphics.

40|$|The article {{starts with}} a series of {{questions}} concerning the relations between particular levels <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> and the forms and contents of the youths' participation in culture. Having commented on basic dilemmas <b>of</b> contemporary <b>adjustment,</b> the author distinguished and discussed five basic types of the youths' participation in culture, determined according to the criterion of the level <b>of</b> social <b>adjustment.</b> The first (the lowest) level consists in participation in massand pop-culture in institutional frames, with the elements of revolt and individualism. A characteristic feature of the second level <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> is the past association with local cultural institutions and the present participation in cultural institutions of more universal character. A determinant of the third level <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> is cultural superficiality and syncretism. The essence of the fourth level <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> is the continuity of interests and the past participation in school extracurricular activities.
