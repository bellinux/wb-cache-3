50|$|Pocahontas Times Print Shop is a {{historic}} building located at Marlinton, Pocahontas County, West Virginia. It was built in 1900, and is a one-story, rectangular frame building measuring approximately 21 feet by 75 feet. It was built to house The Pocahontas Times newspaper operations. It houses a <b>paper</b> <b>folder</b> and press installed around 1911. The Pocahontas Times has been published since 1882.|$|E
50|$|<b>Paper</b> <b>folder</b> sealers {{are used}} to fold special {{pressure-sensitive}} paper. As the paper is folded, pressure rollers roll {{along the edge of}} the paper, bursting open tiny glue pockets that seal the letter shut. Pressure sealed documents are typically opened by tearing off a perforated side or tearing open the sealed portion of the letter. Documents that have been folded and sealed do not require an envelope for mailing and are often used for mailing bills, invoices and other mailed documents.|$|E
50|$|While {{the actual}} {{interview}} technique will {{vary with the}} attitude of the subject and the needs of the interviewer's service, the interrogator should develop a basic plan for the first interview. This might be put into a <b>paper</b> <b>folder</b> along with documents (or copies) associated with the subject, or, if available, it can go into a HUMINT database so other interrogators, analysts, cultural and language specialists, can review it. Reviews can help plan the current interview, or give ideas to other interrogators for other interviews.|$|E
50|$|Most <b>paper</b> <b>folders</b> push <b>paper</b> {{into the}} machine by use of a {{friction}} wheel; this grabs paper using friction. Friction-feed <b>paper</b> <b>folders</b> do not work well with glossy paper as the friction wheel slips on the paper's surface. Pneumatic <b>paper</b> <b>folders</b> are preferable for folding glossy paper.|$|R
50|$|Pneumatic <b>paper</b> <b>folders</b> push <b>paper</b> {{into the}} machine using a vacuum. These folders are often {{referred}} to as air-powered <b>paper</b> <b>folders.</b> This method makes it possible to fold most types of paper. Most pneumatic <b>paper</b> <b>folders</b> include a built-in compressor. These folders can have as many as sixteen folding plates or several knife folds depending on the imposition, these are adjusted manually or electronically, depending on the machine.|$|R
50|$|Entry-level <b>paper</b> <b>folders</b> {{require that}} the folding plates be {{adjusted}} manually, with fold settings specified on the folding plates. Higher-end <b>paper</b> <b>folders</b> will electronically adjust the folding plates for added precision and convenience. Both usually have fine tuning knobs for precise adjustments.|$|R
5000|$|Ideal {{photograph}} storage involves placing each {{photo in}} an individual folder constructed from buffered, or acid-free paper. [...] Buffered paper folders are especially recommended in cases when a photograph was previously mounted onto poor quality material or using an adhesive {{that will lead to}} even more acid creation. [...] Store photographs measuring 8x10 inches or smaller vertically along the longer edge of the photo in the buffered <b>paper</b> <b>folder,</b> within a larger archival box, and label each folder with relevant information to identify it. The rigid nature of the folder protects the photo from slumping or creasing, as long as the box is not packed too tightly or under filled. Folder larger photos or brittle photos stacked flat within archival boxes with other materials of comparable size.|$|E

50|$|Folding {{machines}} exclusively {{used for}} folding paper are {{commonly referred to}} as <b>paper</b> <b>folders.</b> These machines are typically used for creating letter folds (C Folds) and accordion folds (Z Folds). Other commonly used folds include a half fold, fold-out, double parallel fold, gate (brochure) fold, and right angle fold.|$|R
50|$|The fold type in a {{buckle folder}} is set by {{adjusting}} folding plates. Most <b>paper</b> <b>folders</b> {{allow for a}} wide range of fold types. Right angle folds require the paper to rotate 90 degrees also known as an 8-page or a right angle. More folds can be accomplished by the use of a 16-page and 32-page unit.|$|R
40|$|Among all {{the forms}} of sculpture, the most {{interesting}} from a mathematical point of view may well be paper fold ing. In support of this assertion I would point out that paper folding requires a distinctive leap of the imagination from Flatland into Roundworld, from two dimensions to three. A sculptor who carves stone or models clay begins with a medium that is already three-dimensional, but the <b>paper</b> <b>folder</b> must envision the solid object in the flat and formless sheet. This calls for strong geometric intuition. A computer program now under development offers assistance in making the leap into a higher dimension. Given a three-dimensional object, the software attempts to generate a "folding net, " a two-dimensional diagram that you can color or otherwise decorate, then print on paper, cut out and fold up to create a three-dimensional model. The program, called HyperGami, {{is the creation of}} Michael Eisenberg of the University of Colorado at Boulder and Arm Nishioka, a doctoral student at Colorado. So far it is being used mainly to explore paper models of polyhedra, which are objects that hold much mathematical interest of their own. In addition to serving as a bridge between di mensions, HyperGami spans two worlds in an other way as well. Part of its user interface relies on the direct manipulation of objects—the pointand-click paradigm common in most graphics software today. But there is also a programminglanguage interface, which allows operations on the solids and on their folding nets to be ex pressed algorithmically. Exploring ways of com bining these two styles of computing was one of the original motivations for the project...|$|E

I randomly separate the pages and start reading: "He stood and Nimble Virtue tossed a packet of Mad Love at his feet. It came to rest by the toe of his boot, where the water was icing up over a flaking patch of dried blood. Welding marks, like narrow scars of slag. The slaughterhouse had been grafted together from a stack of old Sea Train cargo containers. A cryogenic pump hummed {{at the far end of}} the place, like a beating heart, pushing liquid oxygen through the network of pipes that crisscrossed the walls and floor. From the ceiling, dull steel hooks held shapeless slabs of discoloured meat. Jonny looked at the slunk merchant. Kadrey (1995, part 3, p. 1). " When we read this passage, what is the tenor of the voice that we might deploy through the use of the third person narrative? In the examination of educational narrative forms, whether through qualitative research or self-evaluation exercises, one might discern many voices that could crowd one’s analytical frame. The problem for education is straightforward, and has been neatly summarised by Inna Semetsky (2004) when she said, “[A] new non-representational language of expression, exemplified in what Deleuze (1994 b) called a performative or modulating aspect, is being created by means of the language structure going through the process of its own becoming-other and undergoing a series of transformations giving birth to a new, as though foreign and unfamiliar, other language,” (p. 316). This is happening as I speak or as you read these words through the immense structures and processes of the education systems of the industrialised West. Metrophage was born of these structures and now sits innocently in my office or on the internet or in the computer files of high school students studying for examinations to go to respectable colleges. The problem can be broken down into two parts that I shall explore throughout this chapter: 1. What are the languages of otherness that can be produced through the action of educational processing? 2. How can we use this otherness to set off new directions of educational practice and how does the philosophy of Gilles Deleuze relate to these practices...|$|E
50|$|The {{paper of}} woodblock prints are often {{made of wood}} fibers and may react to non-archival quality storage {{materials}}. For example, if stored in <b>paper</b> <b>folders,</b> the prints can become acidic. Using acid-free storage materials can prevent these acidic processes. Storage materials such as folders or boxes can also prevent light from reaching the print, and further reduce damage to light-sensitive materials.|$|R

50|$|The only folio set {{produced}} in Klimt's lifetime, Das Werk Gustav Klimts, was published initially by H. O. Miethke (of Gallerie Miethke, Klimt's exclusive gallery in Vienna) from 1908 to 1914 in an edition of 300, supervised personally by the artist. The first thirty-five editions (I-XXXV) each included an original drawing by Klimt, {{and the next}} thirty-five editions (XXXVI-LXX) each with a facsimile signature on the title page. Fifty images depicting Klimt's most important paintings (1893-1913) were reproduced using collotype lithography and mounted on a heavy, cream-colored wove paper with deckled edges. Thirty-one of the images (ten of which are multicolored) are printed on Chine-collé. The remaining nineteen are high quality halftones prints. Each piece was marked with a unique signet—designed by Klimt—which was impressed into the wove paper in gold metallic ink. The prints were issued in groups of ten to subscribers, in unbound black <b>paper</b> <b>folders</b> embossed with Klimt's name. Because of the delicate nature of collotype lithography, {{as well as the}} necessity for multicolored prints (a feat difficult to reproduce with collotypes), and Klimt's own desire for perfection, the series that was published in mid-1908 was not completed until 1914.|$|R
