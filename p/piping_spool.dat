30|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{demonstrate}} the applicability of the developed material-supply-driven project planning and control scheme in mitigating the negative impact of material delays upon industrial project schedules, specifically in the context of <b>piping</b> <b>spool</b> fabrication. This paper is organized as follows: Literature reviews are conducted first on spool fabrication and module assembly in industrial sector along with potential problems present in the complex supply chain. In the subsequent section, a framework for scheduling <b>piping</b> <b>spool</b> fabrication under the constraints of material supply, contractual deadline, limited labor availability, and technology relationships is proposed. Next, a spool fabrication case study is conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in mitigating material delays and achieving the targeted delivery time for a particular spool.|$|E

Design drawings, contract deadlines, resources availability and material supply patterns are extracted from a real oil and gas expansion project to validate the proposed implementation methodology.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIncident {{involving}} {{failures of}} ASTM A 53 carbon steel (CS) pipe, connected to {{pressure safety valve}} (PSV) and carrying raw gas has caused serious supply disruption. This study was performed to identify the most probable cause of the pipe failure. It was conducted by reviewing the existing design, construction data and pipe material analysis using non-destructive techniques such as VT, PT, MT and UT along with metallographic, hardness and microscopic analysis. The investigation revealed that excessive material loss has occurred in both failure and its adjacent regions due to abrasive grinding, resulting {{in the formation of}} a through thickness flaw. These grindings were performed to accommodate the pre-installed <b>piping</b> <b>spool</b> to avoid alteration in the pipe position. RCA demonstrated that this rapid thinning of the steel pipe body later led to its failure. Metallurgical study using photomicrograph shows that the morphology of the steel material was consistent and did not show any evidence of internal corrosion or micro fractures. Further damage to the surface of already excessively reduced thickness occurred due to nominal pipe vibration and atmospheric effect during service. The research work described in the paper has a significant meaning to recognize the root cause of such failures in CS pipes and through given recommendations to eliminate future such happenings...|$|E
