5000|$|Barbara Grofe of RP Online {{wrote in}} an early review: [...] "Talents are little to see, but {{an awful lot of}} <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>ego</b> problems". In another review, it was criticized that also {{children}} {{at a very young age}} can present their talents. The youth protection also takes a close eye on the show for years now. Next to that, it has been highly criticized in recent seasons that candidates with no real talent are presented to the audience after a pre-casting to humiliate these people and push the ratings. Christian Richter writes about the show that the [...] "performances are artificially drawn in the length" [...] and the candidates [...] "tell their personal tragic story with overly dramatic music", even repeating the crucial scenes again in slow motion. Richter goes on saying that [...] "RTL characterizes the term 'Emotainments'". It was also published by the Bild as [...] "super cheating" [...] that RTL paid some of their talents money for their participation in the show.In spite of the critics, the show is very popular among viewers. In 2010, Das Supertalent also won the Golden Camera award as Best Entertainment Show.|$|E
40|$|This paper models {{behavior}} when {{a decision}} maker cares about and manages her self-image. In {{addition to having}} preferences over material outcomes, the agent derives “ego utility ” from positive views about her ability {{to do well in}} a skill-sensitive, “ambitious, ” task. Although she uses Bayes ’ rule to update beliefs, she tends to become overconfident regarding which task is appropriate for her. If tasks are equally informative about ability, her task choice is also overconfident. If the ambitious task is more informative about ability, she might initially display underconfidence in behavior, and, if she is disappointed by her performance, later become too ambitious. <b>People</b> <b>with</b> <b>ego</b> utility prefer to acquire free information in smaller pieces.

40|$|The Scoring System for Latent Structure (SSLS) {{was used}} to test three {{hypotheses}} regarding the degree of self-participation in dreams reported during sleep onset (SO) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. These hypotheses were that (a) the ratio of interactive to associative sentences would be significantly greater in REM than in SO; (b) the level of Ego activity would be significantly greater in REM than in SO; and (c) the ratio between interactive sentences <b>with</b> <b>Ego</b> not present and interactive sentences <b>with</b> <b>Ego</b> present would be significantly different in REM and in SO. None of these hypotheses was confirmed. However, the following significant differences were found: (a) the ratio between sentences <b>with</b> <b>Ego</b> substituted and the total number of interactive sentences was greater in REM than in SO (p less than 0. 05); (b) the ratio between sentences <b>with</b> <b>Ego</b> substituted and sentences <b>with</b> <b>Ego</b> present was greater (p less than 0. 05) in REM than in SO; (c) the ratio between sentences <b>with</b> <b>Ego</b> inserted and sentences <b>with</b> <b>Ego</b> substituted was greater in SO than in REM (p less than 0. 01); and (d) the relative incidence of defective Ego was greater (p less than 0. 01) in SO than in REM.

5000|$|Freud did {{not believe}} there is any supernatural force that affects {{the way we think}} or has pre-programmed us to behave in a certain way. His idea of the id {{explains}} why people act out in certain ways, when it is not in line <b>with</b> the <b>ego</b> or superego. [...] "Religion is an illusion and it derives its strength {{from the fact that it}} falls in with our instinctual desires." [...] Freud believed that people rely on religion to give explanations for anxieties and tension they do not want to consciously believe in. Freud argued that humanity created God in their image. This reverses the idea of any type of religion because he believed that it is constructed by the mind. The role of the mind is something that Freud repeatedly talked about because he believed that the mind is responsible for both conscious and unconscious decisions based on drives and forces. The idea that religion causes people to behave in a moral way is incorrect according to Freud because he believed that no other force has the power to control the ways in which people act. Unconscious desires motivate people to act accordingly.Freud did a significant amount of research studying how people act and interact in a group setting. He believed that people act in different ways according to the demands and constraints of the group as a whole. In his book Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego, Freud argued that the church and organized religion form an [...] "artificial group" [...] which requires an external force to keep it together. In this type of group, everything is dependent on that external force and without it, the group would no longer exist. Groups are necessary, according to Freud in order to decrease the narcissism in all people, by creating libidinal ties with others by placing everyone at an equal level. The commonness among different <b>people</b> <b>with</b> different <b>egos</b> allows <b>people</b> to identify <b>with</b> one another. This relates to the idea of religion because Freud believed that people created religion in order to create these group ties that they unconsciously seek for.|$|R

40|$|The {{theory of}} ego {{development}} presents a comprehensive framework to understand personality development throughout {{the stages of}} life. In this developmental theory, the ego is considered a cognitive-based structure and the primary synthesizing and regulating agent in personality development. Art appreciation and aesthetic judgment are considered to have personality correlates and developmental aspects. The current study aimed to examine the association between ego development and aesthetic judgment styles in adults. We recruited 202 adults from a community sample in Tehran, Iran. The age of {{participants in this study}} ranged from 18 to 64 (M = 29. 5, SD = 8. 9). Consistent with our hypotheses, results indicated that concrete aesthetic judgment was negatively associated <b>with</b> <b>ego</b> development. Moreover, analytical and emotional aesthetic judgment styles were positively correlated <b>with</b> <b>ego</b> development. In conclusion, individuals who scored higher in ego development tended to use more advanced aesthetic judgment styles when exposed to art...|$|R

40|$|Cell monolayer-grown chlamydiae (CGO) {{differed}} from egg-grown organisms (EGO) in their increased spontaneous infectivity relative to centrifuge-assisted infectivity for mono-layers. For each population spontaneous: centrifuge-assisted infectivity ratios were constant Over a wide dose range. Spontaneous infection increased linearly {{with time and}} could not be exhausted from either population by prolonged adsorption; there was no change in infectivity ratios in residual supernatants. Further, one passage of EGO through monolayers gave CGO with stable infectivity properties not increased by further cell passage yet reverting on a single passage in eggs. Spontaneous infection of monolayers <b>with</b> <b>EGO</b> gave progeny <b>with</b> the same infectivity ratios as monolayers infected <b>with</b> <b>EGO</b> by centrifugation. The change in properties following EGO infection of monolayers occurred prior to natural release from cells. We conclude that EGO and CGO are two phenotypically distinct, homogeneous populations. The two infection modes are not properties of subpopulations within EGO and CGO. The relationship of these observations on chlamydiae to other possible host-imposed phenomena is considered...|$|R
