5|$|After its <b>perihelion</b> <b>passage,</b> {{the comet}} moved into dark skies, and {{although}} it faded as it receded from the Sun it remained {{one of the most}} prominent objects in the sky. On 30 September, observers, including Finlay and E. E.

Observers reported that the relative brightness of the fragments varied from day to day.|$|E

5|$|Comet Hale–Bopp was {{observed}} intensively by astronomers during its <b>perihelion</b> <b>passage,</b> and several important advances in cometary science resulted from these observations.

5|$|Heinrich Kreutz {{studied the}} orbits of the three great comets, and {{developed}} {{the idea that the}} three comets were fragments of a much larger progenitor comet which had broken up at an earlier <b>perihelion</b> <b>passage.</b> The fragmentation of the Great Comet of 1882 itself demonstrated that this was plausible. It is now thought that the Great Comet of 1882 is a fragment of X/1106 C1, and that Comet du Toit (C/1945 X1) and Comet Ikeya–Seki (C/1965 S1) are two of its sister fragments.|$|E
5|$|It is not {{possible}} to estimate the chances of another very bright Kreutz comet arriving in the near future, but given that at least 10 have reached naked eye visibility over the last 200 years, another great comet from the Kreutz family seems almost certain to arrive at some point. Comet White–Ortiz–Bolelli in 1970 reached an apparent magnitude of 1. In December 2011, Kreutz sungrazer C/2011 W3 (Lovejoy) survived its <b>perihelion</b> <b>passage</b> and had an apparent magnitude of −3.|$|E

40|$|The {{evolution}} of cometary surface topography is presently modeled {{in terms of}} a focusing of thermal energy due to topographical concavity.

5|$|No comets with an {{eccentricity}} {{significantly greater}} than one have been observed, {{so there are no}} confirmed observations of comets that are likely to have originated outside the Solar System. Comet C/1980 E1 had an orbital period of roughly 7.1 million years before the 1982 <b>perihelion</b> <b>passage,</b> but a 1980 encounter with Jupiter accelerated the comet giving it the largest eccentricity (1.057) of any known hyperbolic comet. Comets not expected to return to the inner Solar System include C/1980 E1, C/2000 U5, C/2001 Q4 (NEAT), C/2009 R1, C/1956 R1, and C/2007 F1 (LONEOS).|$|E
5|$|Some comets {{have been}} {{observed}} to break up during their <b>perihelion</b> <b>passage,</b> including great comets West and Ikeya–Seki. Biela's Comet was one significant example, when it broke into two pieces during its passage through the perihelion in 1846. These two comets were seen separately in 1852, but never again afterward. Instead, spectacular meteor showers were seen in 1872 and 1885 when the comet should have been visible. A minor meteor shower, the Andromedids, occurs annually in November, and it is caused when the Earth crosses the orbit of Biela's Comet.|$|E
5|$|The Sun-grazing comets of 1668, 1689, 1702 and 1945 seem to {{be closely}} related to those of 1882 and 1965, {{although}} their orbits are not well enough determined to establish whether they broke off from the parent comet in 1106, or the previous <b>perihelion</b> <b>passage</b> before that, {{some time in the}} 3–5th centuries AD. This subgroup of comets is known as Subgroup II. Comet White–Ortiz–Bolelli, which was seen in 1970, is more closely related to this group than Subgroup I, but appears to have broken off during the previous orbit to the other fragments.|$|E
40|$|The {{statistical}} significance of anisotropies {{in the distribution}} of orbital orientations among the long-period and nearly parabolic comets is evaluated. It is suggested that these anisotropies are not the result of observational selection effects. A numerical model for the distribution of orbital orientations is constructed, based on Oort's theory of comet origin and the assumption that the observed anisotropies are caused by multiple planetary perturbations over the course of many <b>perihelion</b> <b>passages.</b> The model, which is restricted to comets with perihelion distances less than 0. 3 AU, does not predict any significant anisotropies...|$|R
5000|$|The {{anomalistic year}} is the time taken for the Earth to {{complete}} one revolution with respect to its apsides.

Based on these results, we conclude that, on both occasions, the incident flux at Venus will likely be too low to allow for the detection of a shower by optical means.

5|$|After its <b>perihelion</b> <b>passage,</b> {{the comet}} {{moved into the}} {{southern}} celestial hemisphere.

The previous record had been set by the Great Comet of 1811, which was visible to the naked eye for about 9 months.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} {{suggestion was}} that the comets were all fragments of an earlier Sun-grazing comet. This idea was first proposed in 1880, and its plausibility was amply demonstrated when the Great Comet of 1882 broke up into several fragments after its <b>perihelion</b> <b>passage.</b> In 1888, Heinrich Kreutz published a paper showing that the comets of 1843 (C/1843 D1, the Great March Comet), 1880 (C/1880 C1, the Great Southern Comet), and 1882 (C/1882 R1, Great September Comet) were probably fragments of a giant comet that had broken up several orbits before.

The energy contribution from multiply scattered sunlight and thermal emission by coma dust increases the total energy reaching the Halley nucleus at perihelion by a factor of 2. 4.

Meteoroid trails ejected during past <b>perihelion</b> <b>passages</b> of the Mars-orbit-intersecting comet 79 P/du Toit-Hartley have the potential of generating meteor outbursts in the Martian atmosphere. Depending on timing and intensity, {{the effects of these}} outbursts may be detectable by instrumentation operating in the vicinity of Mars. We aim to generate predictions for meteor activity in the martian atmosphere related to that comet; to search for evidence, in planetary mission data, that such activity took place; and to make predictions for potentially detectable future activity. Methods. We have modelled the stream by integrating numerically the states of particle ensembles, each ensemble representing a trail of meteoroids ejected from the comet during 39 <b>perihelion</b> <b>passages</b> from 1803, and propagated them forward in time, concentrating on those particles that physically approach Mars in the recent past and near future. Results. We find several instances where meteor outbursts of low to moderate intensity may have taken place at Mars since 1997. A search through Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) radio science data during two periods in 2003 and 2005 when data coverage was available showed that a plasma layer did indeed form in the martian ionosphere for a period of a few hours in April 2003 as a direct consequence of the predicted outburst. The apparent failure to identify such an event in 2005 could be due to those meteoroids ablating lower in the atmosphere or that the cometary dust follows a different particle size distribution than what was assumed. Our study highlights the need for further theoretical modelling of the response of the martian ionosphere to a time-variable meteoroid flux, observations of the comet itself and, most importantly, regular monitoring of the martian ionosphere during future outbursts predicted by our model...|$|R
40|$|Dormant or near-dormant short-period comets can {{unexpectedly}} regain {{ability to}} eject dust. In many known cases, the resurrection is short-lived and lasts {{less than one}} orbit.

We identify two candidates, 297 P/Beshore and 332 P/Ikeya-Murakami, both of which were found to be inactive or weakly active in the previous orbit before their discovery. We derive a reactivation rate of ∼ 0. 007 comet^- 1 orbit^- 1, which implies that typical short-period comets only become temporary dormant for less than a few times.

50|$|A comet will {{experience}} {{a range of}} diverse conditions as it traverses its orbit. For long period comets, {{most of the time}} it will be so far from the Sun that it will be too cold for evaporation of ices to occur. When it passes through the terrestrial planet region, evaporation will be rapid enough to blow away small grains, but the largest grains may resist entrainment and stay behind on the comet nucleus, beginning the formation of a dust layer. Near the Sun, the heating and evaporation rate will be so great, that no dust can be retained. Therefore, the thickness of dust layers covering the nuclei of a comet can indicate how closely and how often a comet's perihelion travels are to the Sun. If a comet has an accumulation of thick dust layers, it may have frequent <b>perihelion</b> <b>passages</b> that don't approach the Sun too closely.|$|R
