In 2001, the Court of Appeal rendered a split decision, holding that while in its opinion the 50-candidate rule itself was constitutional, it was unconstitutional to fail to provide the <b>party</b> <b>identifier</b> on the ballot, as this denied important information about candidates to electors when completing their ballot. The Court instructed Parliament to establish a lower threshold in such cases. Following this ruling, Parliament again amended the Act to set a 12-candidate threshold for the <b>party</b> <b>identifier,</b> meaning that parties fielding at least 12 candidates {{in a general election}} would have the party name included on the ballot next to their candidates' names.|$|E

40|$|The {{ideal of}} the Independent citizen has not fared well in survey research. The study of party {{identification}} recast Independence from parties as a weakness rather than strength. Others, however, have derided the gloomy findings about Independents as a myth; those Independents who profess partisan leanings appear to deserve better. Our examination of partisan leaners then and now finds that, oddly enough, the gloomy conclusion about Independents then was off the mark. In 1952, partisan leaners surpassed <b>party</b> <b>identifiers</b> in being politically involved and informed. Nowadays, however, the reverse is true. The partisan leaners, let alone pure Independents, have handed over the edge on positive qualities to <b>party</b> <b>identifiers.</b> We surmise that these changes have occurred due to increased polarization.

40|$|People are biased partisans: {{they tend}} to agree with {{policies}} from political parties they identify with, independent of policy content. Here, we investigate how physiological reactions to political parties shape bias. Using changes in galvanic skin conductance responses to the visual presentation of party logos, we obtained an implicit and physiological measure of the affective arousal associated with political parties. Subsequently, we exposed subjects to classical party cue experiments where the party sponsors of specific policies were experimentally varied. We found that partisan bias only obtains among those exhibiting a strong physiological reaction to the party source; being a self-reported <b>party</b> <b>identifier</b> is not sufficient on its own.

5000|$|Those {{people who}} {{identify}} {{with a party}} tend to vote for their party's candidate for various offices in high percentages. Those who consider themselves to be strong partisans, strong Democrats and strong Republicans respectively, {{tend to be the}} most faithful in voting for their party's nominee for office. In the case of voting for president, since the 1970s, party identification on voting behavior has been increasing significantly. By the late 1990s, party identification on voting behavior was at the highest level of any election since the 1950s. [...] When voting in congressional elections, the trend is similar. Strong <b>party</b> <b>identifiers</b> voted overwhelmingly for their party's nominee in the general election. It {{is important to note that}} each party respectively in certain elections, would have stronger voting behavior of their strongest <b>party</b> <b>identifiers.</b> For instance, in the years the Democrats dominated House and Senate elections in the 1970s and 1980s, it can be explained that their strong <b>party</b> <b>identifiers</b> were more loyal in voting for their party's nominee for Congress than the Republicans were.|$|R

This article suggests an alternative model in which party identification moderates the impact of issues on the vote.

This article investigates whether this difference might be due to a methodological difference between the British and American Election surveys: the British surveys, unlike the American, have placed the party identification question after the question on electoral choice, and this order may encourage the British respondents to bring their reports of their party identification into line with their actual votes. A split-sample panel study experiment was conducted to test this hypothesis. The results were not decisive, but they did suggest that the `improper' question order elicited a smaller proportion of `true' <b>party</b> <b>identifiers</b> and produced response uncertainty in the reporting of party identification...|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates factors {{affecting}} voting behavior in Canada’s October 2008 federal election. The election {{was held in}} the context of a rapidly worsening financial crisis that threatened to become a global economic meltdown. National survey data gathered in the 2008 Political Support in Canada Study reveal that the deteriorating economy trumped the opposition Liberal Party’s Green Shift Program as the major campaign issue by a huge margin. Damage done to the governing Conservatives by the economic crisis was limited by perceptions of their leader, Prime Minister Stephen Harper. Analyses of a mixed logit model of electoral choice shows that although the Conservatives had a relatively small share of <b>party</b> <b>identifiers</b> and Harper was widely disliked, his image as “safe pair on hands” helped his party weather the political storm generated by the flood of bad economic news...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we argue that}} parties shape their supporters' views about the {{political}} system via the messages they communicate about the desirability of the political system. Moreover, we contend that the effectiveness of such communication varies considerably across generations. Combining data from election surveys collected in 15 democracies {{as part of the}} Comparative Study of Electoral Systems (CSES) project with data on the policy positions of 116 political parties collected by the Comparative Manifestos Project, we find that supporters of parties that express positive positions toward the political system report systematically higher levels of political legitimacy than supporters of parties that communicate negative views. Moreover, this communication is particularly effective among older <b>party</b> <b>identifiers</b> whose partisan identification tends to be more pronounced. Taken together, these findings suggest that political parties play an active role in shaping citizens' views of the political system but their success in mobilizing consent among citizens in contemporary democracies may weaken with partisan de-alignment and generational change. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Despite its {{importance}} in contemporary American politics, presidential scandal is poorly understood within political science. Scholars typically interpret scandals as {{resulting from the}} disclosure of official misbehavior, but the likelihood and intensity of media scandals is also influenced by the political and news context. This article provides a theoretical argument for two independent factors that should increase the president’s vulnerability to scandal: low approval among opposition <b>party</b> <b>identifiers</b> {{and a lack of}} congestion in the news agenda. Using new data and statistical approaches, I find strong support for both claims. These results suggest that contextual factors shape the occurrence of political events and how such events are interpreted. From Iran-Contra to Monica Lewinsky, presidential scandal has come to play an especially important role in contemporary American politics since Watergate, but it remains an elusive and poorly understood topic within political science. 1 To date, most quantitative research on scandal has focused on the effects of allegations of impropriety on trust in government and the media, 2 members of Congress 3 or the president. 4 No clea...|$|R

We first briefly explain the nature of the value change process and outline why it is occurring, thus empirically demonstrating its causal antecedents. We then empirically analyze the political consequences of this value change in four important areas. We look at the relationship between value change and growing levels of social and political alienation along a number of key attitudinal dimensions. We also investigate the relationship between value preferences and a “New Politics” agenda and political involvement. Finally, we explore the social bases of party support and then assess evidence of differences in orientations between <b>party</b> <b>identifiers</b> and nonidentifiers.

40|$|The {{universal}} composability paradigm {{allows for}} the modular design and analysis of cryptographic protocols. It has been widely and successfully used in cryptography. However, devising a coherent yet simple and expressive model for universal composability is, as the history of such models shows, highly non-trivial. For example, several partly severe problems have been {{pointed out in the}} literature for the UC model. In this work, we propose a coherent model for universal composability, called the IITM model (“Inexhaustible Interactive Turing Machine”). A main feature of the model is that it is stated without a priori fixing irrelevant details, such as a specific way of addressing of machines by session and <b>party</b> <b>identifiers,</b> a specific modeling of corruption, or a specific protocol hierarchy. In addition, we employ a very general notion of runtime. All reasonable protocols and ideal functionalities should be expressible based on this notion in a direct and natural way, and without tweaks, such as (artificial) padding of messages or (artificially) adding extra messages. Not least because of these features, the model is simple and expressive. Also the general results that we prove, such as composition theorems, hold independently of how such details are fixed for concret...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} attack and inoculation message strategies in political campaign communication. A total of 341 initial and followup treatment interviews and 392 control interviews were completed among potential voters in a U. S. Senate campaign during October 1986. The study hypothesized that character attack messages directed to supporters of opposing candidates exert more influence than issue attack messages. This prediction was not supported. Contrary to prediction, {{the results indicated}} that, during the latter stages of a political campaign featuring known candidates, issue attack messages exert more persuasive impact than character attack messages. However, {{the primary purpose of}} this investigation was to apply McGuire's inoculation theory to political campaign communication. The study hypothesized that political campaign messages can be designed to inoculate supporters of candidates against the subsequent attack messages of opposing candidates. This prediction was supported. In addition, the results supported the hypothesis that inoculation confers more resistance to subsequent attack messages among strong political <b>party</b> <b>identifiers</b> as opposed to weak identifiers, nonidentifiers and crossovers. Contrary to prediction, however, the study found that inoculation confers more resistance among Democrat party loyalists as opposed to Republican party loyalists. The results of this investigation extend the scope of inoculation theory to new domain, and at the same time, suggest a new strategic approach for candidates in political campaigns...|$|R
40|$|On May 5 th, Britain {{held its}} first general {{election}} in the post- 9 / 11 era. Much had changed since 2001. At that time, Labour was in a very strong position [...] the economy was robust, a substantial plurality of voters were Labour <b>party</b> <b>identifiers,</b> and the <b>party</b> was favoured on several key issues. Labour Leader, Tony Blair, was not especially popular, but the electorate was much more enthusiastic about him than his chief rival, Conservative leader, William Hague (see Clarke et al. 2004). Four years later, although the economy remained healthy, Labour’s share of identifiers had declined, the set of salient issues was very different, and Mr. Blair was often maligned, not only by opposition supporters, but by many in his own party. In {{the run-up to the}} 2005 election, opinion polls showed that Labour held only a narrow lead over the Conservatives in the electorate as a whole, and it was possible that the Conservatives were actually ahead among likely voters. Although models of the conversion of votes to seats cautioned that it would take a massive swing in the popular vote for the Conservatives to win a parliamentary majority, a hung parliament was a nontrivial possibility.

40|$|American presidential electoral {{politics}} are shaped {{to a great}} degree by two qualities: their competitiveness and their partisanship. American presidential politics are about as competitive as politics gets. Even landslide presidential elections rarely reach a 60 - 40 split of the two-party vote and most presiden-tial elections are decided in the 55 -to- 45 -percent range. American politics in general is also very partisan and they have become more so in recent decades. Among those survey respondents who said that they voted (reported voters) in the 2004 election, about 40 percent identified strongly with either the Democratic or Republican parties and another 55 percent indicated some lesser level of party identification. 1 With competitive and highly partisan pol-itics, it is natural that campaigns and those who observe them focus on the voters who are relatively uncertain about who they will vote for in an election. These potentially persuadable, or “up for grabs, ” voters have become known 1. These percentages were calculated from American National Election Study (ANES) data and have been corrected for the disparity between the vote division in the data and the actual national vote division. The proportion of strong <b>party</b> <b>identifiers</b> among reported voters in 2004 {{is very close to}} what it was in the 1950 s and early 1960 s, the heyday of modern parti-sanship as documented by the classic study of The American Voter (Campbell and others 1960). Those who are less identified with a political party include those who said that their identification was not very strong (about 29 percent in 2004) and those who initially said that they were independent but then said that they leaned toward a party (about 26 percent).

Our investigation, which utilizes cross-sectional, longitudinal and experimental data, demonstrates the role of ideological awareness and involvement in the Republicans’ ability to maintain the backing of their supporters even on issues on which the position of the Democratic Party is widely popular.

40|$|Political scientists, journalists, and astute {{political}} observers agree that American political parties, {{at both the}} mass and elite level, have become more partisan over the past fifty years. The two national parties have increasingly moved apart on various social and economic issues, and elected representatives have become more ideologically divided over time. In response to party polarization, rank-and-file <b>party</b> <b>identifiers</b> have further sorted themselves into the Republican and Democratic parties. Their evaluation of political figures, {{as well as their}} positions over a range of political issues, {{is more likely to be}} influenced by their party identification now than decades ago. Yet when one closely examines the overall distributions of ideology and public opinions, one can hardly detect any changes in them over time. The electorate remains largely ideologically centrist and moderate. Given frequent elections and the prevalence of watchdog groups and a savvy media, one would expect that representatives who deviate ideologically from the preferences of their constituents would get voted out. In principle, one would expect any electoral disconnect to diminish, if not completely disappear in the long run. Yet in reality, the opposite is true [...] - the electoral disconnect between the overall attitudes of the mass public and those of elites appears to have widened over time. The empirical puzzle is: How can party polarization be sustained when the constituents who elect them are not ideologically divided? The answer is geography. Federal elections are geographically-based. There are four hundred and thirty five separate electoral districts for House seats, and fifty districts for Senate seats. Congressional members are single-minded re-election seekers who are held accountable to their home constituents [...] -not to the national electorate. In order to understand what contributes to party polarization and electoral disconnect, one must begin by studying the spatial composition of voters across geographic regions. I argue that the increasingly skewed spatial distribution of partisan preferences, which I refer to as `geographic polarization of partisan preferences', holds the key to the empirical puzzle. There are two ways in which geographic polarization of partisan preferences can occur. One is through electoral behavioral change; another is through spatial compositional change. By electoral behavioral change, I refer primarily to party sorting that began after 1980. As the two national parties pull apart ideologically, voters can easily differentiate between the major parties and align themselves with the political party that lies closer to their political preferences. Because of party sorting, the connection between a person's socio-demographic characteristics and his or her partisan preference strengthens over time. By spatial composition change, I refer to the condition in which the demographic make-up of geographic regions (or electoral districts) gets altered over time in ways that are politically relevant. There are two mechanisms that can induce spatial compositional change. The first mechanism is selective migration. When individuals' politically relevant socio-demographic characteristics and lifestyle preferences are correlated with both the migration decision and residential choice, then voters become geographically sorted over time in ways that matter for their political choices. The second mechanism is place-varying generational replacement. The conventional notion of generational replacement suggests that cohorts coming of age in different time (or political) periods might develop distinct partisan preferences or beliefs. As younger cohorts replace older cohorts, the overall composition of the electorate might then change. While such conventional generational replacement continues to take place, I show that, after 1980, there is an additional form of generational replacement that is spatially dependent. In addition to the time in which one comes of age, the place in which one comes of age also matters. In California, I demonstrate that younger voters coming of age in pro-Democratic regions (the Bay Area and Los Angeles County) are systematically more likely to identify as Democrats than those growing up in pro-Republican regions. As these younger cohorts age, the spatial disparity in term of partisan preferences widens. I use California as a case study because it is a very large and diverse state. There are many unique historic data, including individual-level opinion polls, voter registration data and yearly county-level demographic data. By assembling and examining various datasets, I show that selective migration began long before elite polarization resumed in Congress in the 1960 s. Migration patterns have largely been stable over the past few decades. They are mostly driven by economic considerations and not by religious preferences. Over time, the accumulation of selective migration results in an increasingly skewed spatial distribution of voters of various socio-demographic characteristics. When the two national political parties began to pull apart on social and economic issues during the Reagan administration, voters took the cues and became more sorted by partisanship. Party sorting had two political impacts. First, it led to the onset of place-varying generational replacement. Second, it further accentuated the connection between the skewed spatial distribution of social-demographic characteristics and aggregate partisan preferences. Consequently, geographic polarization began to emerge in 1980 and continued to increase over time. Prior to 1980, counties in California used to have fairly similar partisan preferences. The moderate, centrist distribution of ideology among voters was reflected by a bell-shape distribution of partisan preferences at the county level. By 2000, the distribution of partisan preferences at the county level had become bimodal [...] - counties either had gone more pro-Democratic or pro-Republican, with very few electorally competitive counties in between. Through the interaction of electoral behavioral changes and spatial compositional changes, the moderate, centrist electorate is now spatially arranged in partisan polarized districts. These districts perpetuate party polarization at the elite level as Congressional candidates must appeal to either strongly Democratic or strongly Republican electorates within their districts. Lastly, I argue that since party sorting and the pattern of selective migration are deeply entrenched in the electorate, geographic polarization and electoral disconnect are likely to be sustained in the long run...|$|R
