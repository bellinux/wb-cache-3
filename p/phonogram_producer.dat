Besides the right to perform a performance and to deny others to perform it, these exclusive rights cover also the live broadcasting of a performance, and the video or audio recording of a previously unfixed performance. As in article 7(1)(c) of the Rome Convention for the Protection of Performers, Producers of Phonograms and Broadcasting Organisations, performers' rights also cover the reproduction of non-authorized recordings, and also the reproduction of recordings for purposes other than those agreed upon, including the broadcast of a recording made for non-commercial purposes only.

40|$|The German Federal Constitutional Court has {{delivered}} an important decision {{with regards to}} the permissibility of sampling which is widely used in hip hop and electronic music. With this decision, the Court ended a dispute that has been ongoing for almost 20 years. Furthermore, the Court has applied a fundamental rights discourse between the countervailing rights of the original authors and those of the new works using samples from the original works. The preceding courts found that sampling would constitute an infringement of the <b>phonogram</b> <b>producer</b> rights (Section 85 of the German Author’s Rights Act) where the samples could have been created independently. The German Constitutional Court, however, disagreed: By holding that sampling was a form of art protected by the fundamental right of artistic freedom and may outweigh the exploitation interest of the <b>phonogram</b> <b>producer</b> would only be impaired to a minimal extent by samplin...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} exploit the fruit of their {{intellectual}} labour, authors and performing artists must usually turn to specialised undertakings: publishers, broadcasting organisations, film <b>producers,</b> <b>phonogram</b> <b>producers,</b> etc. Partly {{as a consequence of}} the high level of concentration in the media sector, authors and performing artists find themselves in a structurally weaker bargaining position. This easily leads in practice to the use of unilateral standard form exploitation contracts, in which too little consideration is given to their interests. The call for the legal protection of authors and performing artists has been heard louder and louder over the last few years, with a view to arming authors and performing artists against such practices. Contrary to the situation that prevails in neighbouring countries, the Dutch legislation in the field of copyright and neighbouring rights devotes hardly any attention to exploitation contracts. This study, which was conducted by Professor P. B. Hugenholtz and Dr. L.
