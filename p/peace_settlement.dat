5|$|In early 1945, the German {{war effort}} {{was on the}} verge of {{collapse}} and Himmler's relationship with Hitler had deteriorated. Himmler considered independently negotiating a <b>peace</b> <b>settlement.</b> His masseur, Felix Kersten, who had moved to Sweden, acted as an intermediary in negotiations with Count Folke Bernadotte, head of the Swedish Red Cross. Letters were exchanged between the two men, and direct meetings were arranged by Walter Schellenberg of the RSHA.|$|E

5|$|McKinley was {{president}} during the Spanish–American War of 1898, {{in which the}} U.S. victory was quick and decisive. As part of the <b>peace</b> <b>settlement,</b> Spain {{turned over to the}} United States its overseas colonies of Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines.

5|$|Antiochus III {{launched}} a massive campaign to retake Parthia and Bactria in 210 or 209BC. He was unsuccessful, but did negotiate a <b>peace</b> <b>settlement</b> with Arsaces II. The latter was granted {{the title of}} king (Greek: basileus) in return for his submission to Antiochus III as his superior. The Seleucids were unable to further intervene in Parthian affairs following increasing encroachment by the Roman Republic and the Seleucid defeat at Magnesia in 190BC. Phriapatius of Parthia (r. c.191–176BC) succeeded Arsaces II, and Phraates I of Parthia (r. c.176–171BC) eventually ascended the throne. Phraates I ruled Parthia without further Seleucid interference.|$|E
5|$|By 494 BC the Persian {{army and}} navy had regrouped, {{and they made}} {{straight}} for the epicentre of the rebellion at Miletus. The Ionian fleet sought to defend Miletus by sea, but was defeated decisively at the Battle of Lade, after the Samians had defected. Miletus was then besieged, captured, and its population was enslaved. This double defeat effectively ended the revolt, and the Carians surrendered to the Persians as a result. The Persians spent 493 BC reducing the cities along the west coast that still held out against them, before finally imposing a <b>peace</b> <b>settlement</b> on Ionia that {{was considered to be}} both just and fair.|$|E

5|$|Cassander married Philip II's {{daughter}} Thessalonike, inducting {{him into}} the Argead dynastic house, and briefly extended Macedonian control into Illyria as far as Epidamnos, although by 313 BC, it was retaken by the Illyrian king Glaucias of Taulantii. By 316 BC, Antigonus had taken the territory of Eumenes and managed to eject Seleucus Nicator from his satrapy of Babylonia; in reaction to this a coalition of Cassander, Ptolemy, and Lysimachus issued an ultimatum to Antigonus in 315 BC for him to surrender various territories in Asia. Antigonus promptly allied with Polyperchon, now based in Corinth, and issued an ultimatum of his own to Cassander, charging him with murder for executing Olympias and demanding that he hand over the royal family, king Alexander IV and the queen mother Roxana. The conflict that followed lasted until the winter of 312/311 BC, when a new <b>peace</b> <b>settlement</b> recognized Cassander as general of Europe, Antigonus as 'first in Asia', Ptolemy as general of Egypt, and Lysimachus as general of Thrace. Cassander had Alexander IV and Roxana put {{to death in the}} winter of 311/310 BC, had Heracles of Macedon executed in 309 BC as part of a <b>peace</b> <b>settlement</b> with Polyperchon, and by 306–305 BC the diadochi were declared kings of their respective territories.|$|E
5|$|Georgia began proposing the {{placement}} of international peacekeeping forces in the separatist regions when Russia began to apply more pressure on Georgia after April 2008. The West launched new initiatives for <b>peace</b> <b>settlement,</b> with peace plans being offered and conferences being organised by the European Union, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and Germany. Georgia accepted the German project for Abkhazia, but the separatists dismissed it. Russia and the separatists did not attend an EU-funded peace conference on Abkhazia. They also dismissed an OSCE offer to renew talks regarding South Ossetia.|$|E
5|$|In early May, the HV {{launched}} a successful offensive, codenamed Operation Flash, against a RSK-held part of western Slavonia in Croatia. The move caused the VRS to reorient {{its attention to}} the Orašje pocket, the only territory outside its control between the Derventa–Brčko road and the Sava River. The shift of VRS focus to Orašje {{may have been the}} result of a desire to retaliate for the defeat suffered by the RSK in western Slavonia, or meant as a quick land-grab before a <b>peace</b> <b>settlement</b> was accepted.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-eighteenth century, Morgan's grandson, John Black, and his Mohawk friend Kanyenke are {{on their}} way through the Carolinas to Brunswick with their band of mercenaries after being called for by the colony's governor, John's uncle, Stuart Black.

5|$|Louis XIV of France {{sought to}} knock Emperor Leopold {{out of the}} war by seizing Vienna, the Habsburg capital, and gain a {{favourable}} <b>peace</b> <b>settlement.</b> The dangers to Vienna were considerable: the Elector of Bavaria and Marshal Marsin's forces in Bavaria threatened from the west, and Marshal Vendôme's large army in northern Italy posed a serious danger with a potential offensive through the Brenner Pass. Vienna was also under pressure from Rákóczi's Hungarian revolt from its eastern approaches. Realising the danger, the Duke of Marlborough resolved to alleviate the peril to Vienna by marching his forces south from Bedburg and help maintain Emperor Leopold within the Grand Alliance.|$|E
5|$|Rebellions {{broke out}} in France and Anjou between 1111 and 1113, and Henry crossed into Normandy to support his nephew, Count Theobald of Blois, who had sided against Louis in the uprising. In a bid to diplomatically isolate the French King, Henry betrothed his young son, William Adelin, to Fulk's {{daughter}} Matilda, and married his illegitimate daughter Matilda to Conan III, the Duke of Brittany, creating alliances with Anjou and Brittany respectively. Louis backed down and in March 1113 met with Henry near Gisors to agree a <b>peace</b> <b>settlement,</b> giving Henry the disputed fortresses and confirming Henry's overlordship of Maine, Bellême and Brittany.|$|E

5|$|The Allies had {{confidently}} {{expected that}} victory {{in a major}} set-piece battle would compel LouisXIV to accept peace on Allied terms, but after Malplaquet (the bloodiest battle of the war), that strategy had lost its validity: Villars had only to avoid defeat for a compromise <b>peace</b> <b>settlement</b> to become inevitable. In March 1710, fresh peace talks re-opened at Geertruidenberg, but again LouisXIV would not concede Whig demands to force his grandson, PhilipV, from Spain. Publicly Marlborough toed the government line, but privately he had real doubts about pressing the French into accepting such a dishonourable course.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} between Henry and Richard finally dissolved into violence shortly before Henry's death.

Henry refused the proposal, whereupon Richard himself spoke up, demanding to be recognised as Henry's successor.

5|$|As the Soviets {{approached}} Berlin, Hitler's {{efforts to}} organise the defence {{of the city}} became ever more meaningless and futile. His last birthday, celebrated at the Führerbunker in Berlin on 20 April 1945, was the occasion for leave-taking for many top Nazis, Göring included. By this time, Carinhall had been evacuated, the building destroyed, and its art treasures moved to Berchtesgaden and elsewhere. Göring arrived at his estate at Obersalzberg on 22 April, {{the same day that}} Hitler, in a lengthy diatribe against his generals, first publicly admitted that the war was lost and that he intended to remain in Berlin to the end and then commit suicide. He also stated that Göring was {{in a better position to}} negotiate a <b>peace</b> <b>settlement.</b> In 1941—a week after the start of the Soviet invasion—Hitler had issued a decree naming Göring his successor in the event of his death.|$|E

5|$|Chesney served {{again as}} the leader of Stephen's army at Wallingford Castle in 1153 and in August he was {{defeated}} by Henry of Anjou. The subsequent <b>peace</b> <b>settlement,</b> the Treaty of Wallingford, gave Henry the English throne after Stephen's death. A part of the treaty awarded control of Oxford Castle to Roger de Bussy. Although Chesney had lost control of the castle, none of his lands were confiscated. Early in 1154, Chesney was with Henry, as he was a witness on two charters of Henry's. After Henry's ascension to the throne, Chesney came to terms with the new king, and received confirmation of his lands from the king by 1157. He spent time in Normandy with Henry from 1159 through to 1161. He continued to receive favours from the king, such as exemption for payment of danegeld on his manor of Deddington in 1156.|$|E
5|$|For most of George's regency and reign, Lord Liverpool {{controlled}} {{the government as}} Prime Minister, with little help from George. His ministers found his behaviour selfish, unreliable and irresponsible. At all times he was much {{under the influence of}} favourites. Taxpayers were angry at his wasteful spending at a time when Britons were fighting in the Napoleonic Wars. He did not provide national leadership in time of crisis, nor act as a role model for his people. Liverpool's government presided over Britain's ultimate victory, negotiated the <b>peace</b> <b>settlement,</b> and attempted to deal with the social and economic malaise that followed. After Liverpool's retirement, George was forced to accept Catholic emancipation despite opposing it.

40|$|In {{the first}} part of this article a {{conceptual}} framework for assessing the durability of nego-tiated <b>peace</b> <b>settlements</b> is developed. The framework elaborates on approaches that hold that dealing with issues of relative group status is central to the effectiveness of negotiated settlements. The dynamics of post-settlement competition, the negotiated rules that shape such competition, and the impact of competitive outcomes on inter-group status, whether adverse or positive, is explored. It is argued that <b>peace</b> <b>settlements</b> with rules that shape competition in such a way that both parity of outcomes and parity of esteem can be achieved will be more durable. Parity of esteem is achieved to the extent that competitive rules inhibit stakeholders from drawing invidious comparisons from competitive outcomes. The second part of the article comprises a case study of South Africa. A descrip-tive analysis is made of a particular set of rules that emanate from the 1993 / 96 negotiated settlement. The competitive arena is the employment market and the rules of affirmative action. The case study centers on a ruling in a case brought to the South African Labor Court by the Solidarity Trade Union. The case illustrates the emergence of invidiou...|$|R
50|$|Reconciliation forms {{a crucial}} aspect of most commissions.
