5|$|The {{increased}} radiation levels pose {{a higher}} risk of crews developing cancer, and can cause damage to the chromosomes of lymphocytes. These cells are central to the immune system and so any damage to them could contribute to the lowered immunity experienced by cosmonauts. Over time, lowered immunity results in the spread of infection between crew members, especially in such confined areas. Radiation has also been linked to a higher incidence of cataracts in cosmonauts. <b>Protective</b> <b>shielding</b> and protective drugs may lower the risks to an acceptable level, but data is scarce and longer-term exposure will result in greater risks.|$|E

25|$|Subatomic charged particles, {{primarily}} protons from {{cosmic rays}} and solar wind, are normally absorbed by Earth's atmosphere. When they interact in sufficient quantity, their effect is {{visible to the}} naked eye in a phenomenon called an aurora. Outside Earth's atmosphere, crews are exposed to about 1 millisievert each day, which is about a year of natural exposure on Earth. This results in a higher risk of cancer for astronauts. Radiation can penetrate living tissue and damage the DNA and chromosomes of lymphocytes. These cells are central to the immune system, and so any damage to them could contribute to the lower immunity experienced by astronauts.

25|$|Without the {{protection}} of Earth's atmosphere and magnetosphere astronauts are exposed {{to high levels of}} radiation. A year in low Earth orbit results in a dose of radiation 10 times that of the annual dose on earth. High levels of radiation damage lymphocytes, cells heavily involved in maintaining the immune system; this damage contributes to the lowered immunity experienced by astronauts. Radiation has also recently been linked to a higher incidence of cataracts in astronauts. Outside {{the protection}} of low Earth orbit, galactic cosmic rays present further challenges to human spaceflight, as the health threat from cosmic rays significantly increases the chances of cancer over a decade or more of exposure. A NASA-supported study reported that radiation may harm the brain of astronauts and accelerate the onset of Alzheimer's disease. Solar flare events (though rare) can give a fatal radiation dose in minutes. It is thought that <b>protective</b> <b>shielding</b> and protective drugs may ultimately lower the risks to an acceptable level.|$|E
500|$|Back on the Titanic, Captain Hardaker {{dismisses the}} ship's {{officers}} from the bridge. Citing regulations, [...] that require at least two officers remain on the bridge at all times, Midshipman Alonso Frame stays. After the group returns from their excursion, Hardaker drops the vessel's <b>protective</b> <b>shielding</b> and magnetises the hull. This causes nearby meteors to be pulled toward the ship on a collision course. Midshipman Frame attempts to reactivate the shields but is shot by Hardaker as the meteors collide with the ship. The collision causes hull breaches, most of the 2,000 passengers and staff are killed, and the vessel begins plunging toward the Earth. The Doctor makes contact with the wounded Midshipman Frame, who stabilises and maintains the power from the damaged engines.|$|E
2500|$|An unusual {{feature of}} the Rose design was that the turret was not fully enclosed. Previous designs had perspex around the gun position, but in the Rose turret there was no <b>protective</b> <b>shielding</b> {{immediately}} {{in front of the}} gunner. This feature reflected operational experience: many Lancaster gunners had cut away parts of their turret perspex in order to obtain a better view, a practice that had originated at RAF Gransden Lodge, and which was subsequently known as the [...] "Gransden Lodge modification". Testing of the Rose turret found that the open design reduced the temperature in the turret – which was typically very low – by only four degrees Celsius compared with a closed design. As well as improving the gunner's view, this feature also made it easier for him to bail out of the aircraft in an emergency.|$|E

50|$|A {{composite}} overwrapped {{pressure vessel}} (COPV) is a vessel {{consisting of a}} thin, non-structural liner wrapped with a structural fiber composite, designed to hold a fluid under pressure. The liner provides a barrier between the fluid and the composite, preventing leaks (which can occur through matrix microcracks which do not cause structural failure) and chemical degradation of the structure. In general, a protective shell is applied for <b>protective</b> <b>shielding</b> against impact damage. The most commonly used composites are fiber reinforced polymers (FRP), using carbon and kevlar fibers. The primary advantage of a COPV as compared to a similar sized metallic pressure vessel is lower weight, but this may be offset by the increased costs of manufacturing and certification.|$|E

5000|$|Recent {{scientific}} {{analysis has}} largely supported the general idea of sheltering indoors {{in response to}} a nuclear explosion. [...] Staying indoors can offer protection both from the initial blast as well as the following radioactive fallout that accumulates during the aftermath. Additionally, such a response would leave roads clear for emergency vehicles to access the area. This is termed the Shelter in place protocol, and together with emergency evacuation advice, they are the two countermeasures to take when the direct effects of nuclear explosions are no longer life-threatening and the need for <b>protective</b> <b>shielding</b> from coming in contact with nuclear weapon debris/fallout {{in the aftermath of the}} explosion, begins to become a concern.|$|E
