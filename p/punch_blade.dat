50|$|A lesion biopsy is {{performed}} if the diagnosis remains uncertain after a clinical physical exam. The most common tissue sampling techniques include shave or punch biopsy. When {{only a portion}} of the lesion can be removed due to its size or location, the biopsy should sample tissue from the thickest area of the lesion, as SCCs {{are most likely to be}} detected in that area. If a shave biopsy {{is performed}}, it should extend through to the level of the dermis in order to provide sufficient tissue for diagnosis; ideally, it would extend to the mid-reticular dermis. Punch biopsy usually extends to the subcutaneous fat when the entire length of the <b>punch</b> <b>blade</b> is utilized.|$|E
40|$|The {{notion that}} the {{evolution}} of core reduction strategies involved increasing efficiency in cutting edge production is prevalent in narratives of hominin technological evolution. Yet {{a number of studies}} comparing two different knapping technologies have found no significant differences in edge production. Using digital analysis methods we present an investigation of raw material efficiency in eight core technologies broadly representative of the long-term evolution of lithic technology. These are bipolar, multiplatform, discoidal, biface, Levallois, prismatic blade, <b>punch</b> <b>blade</b> and pressure blade production. Raw material efficiency is assessed by the ratio of cutting edge length to original core mass. We also examine which flake attributes contribute to maximising raw material efficiency, as well as compare the difference between expert and intermediate knappers in terms of cutting edge produced per gram of core. We identify a gradual increase in raw material efficiency over the broad sweep of lithic technological evolution. The results indicate that the most significant transition in efficiency likely took place with the introduction of small foliate biface, Levallois and prismatic blade knapping, all introduced in the Middle Stone Age / Middle Palaeolithic among early Homo sapiens and Neanderthals. This suggests that no difference in raw material efficiency existed between these species. With prismatic blade technology securely dated to the Middle Palaeolithic, by including the more recent punch and pressure blade technology our results dispel the {{notion that the}} transition to the Upper Palaeolithic was accompanied by an increase in efficiency. However, further increases in cutting edge efficiency are evident, with pressure blades possessing the highest efficiency in this study, indicating that late/epi-Palaeolithic and Neolithic blade technologies further increased efficiency...|$|E

5000|$|However, the <b>punch</b> down tool <b>blade</b> also {{is usually}} used {{to cut off}} excess wire, in the same {{operation}} as making the connection; this is done with a sharp edge of the <b>punch</b> down tool <b>blade</b> trapping the wire to be cut against the plastic punch block. If this cutoff feature is heavily used, the tool blade must be resharpened or replaced from time to time. Tool blades without the sharp edge are also available; these are used for continuing a wire through a slotted post to make connections with another slotted post ("daisy-chained" [...] wiring).|$|R

50|$|Gladii were two-edged {{for cutting}} {{and had a}} tapered point for {{stabbing}} during thrusting. A solid grip was provided by a knobbed hilt added on, possibly with ridges for the fingers. Blade strength was achieved by welding together strips, {{in which case the}} sword had a channel down the center, or by fashioning a single piece of high-carbon steel, rhomboidal in cross-section. The owner's name was often engraved or <b>punched</b> on the <b>blade.</b>|$|R

5000|$|A punch-down block (also punchdown block, punch block, punchblock, quick-connect {{block and}} other variations) {{is a type}} of {{electrical}} connection often used in telephony. It is named because the solid copper wires are [...] "punched down" [...] into short open-ended slots which are a type of insulation-displacement connectors. These slots, usually cut crosswise (not lengthwise) across an insulating plastic bar, contain two sharp metal blades which cut through the wire's insulation as it is <b>punched</b> down. These <b>blades</b> hold the wire in position and make the electrical contact with the wire as well.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the first}} Time Crisis enemies fired [...] "unannounced" [...] direct hits, which caused {{problems}} because players didn't {{know when they}} would be hit and loss damage for their lives. Different-colored enemies provided different accuracy-levels (with red soldiers the most accurate). Project Titan attempted to address that problem using [...] "different colored bullets", but this did not fix the [...] "unannounced" [...] direct-hit issue. This glitch problem was fixed in Time Crisis II; life-threatening shots are indicated with a red flash (known as a [...] "crisis flash") which gives the player time to release the pedal. Since then, this mechanism of hit detection would be used in later main installments. In Crisis Zone, enemies that are about to hit the player with a shot had a target icon on them, reminding the player to stun them quickly or hide. Physical objects such as <b>punches,</b> kicks, and <b>blades</b> will not be announced so players would need to shoot or hide quickly. In Razing Storm, enemies which about to attack the player will marked with a crosshair, with four arrows constantly closing into the center. Letting the arrows hit the center resulted in losing a life. Throwing weapons, such as grenade and rockets are indicated with a yellow triangle, and these attacks can be deflected by shooting them.|$|R
50|$|A <b>punch</b> (or moving <b>blade)</b> {{is used to}} push a {{workpiece}} against the die (or fixed blade), which is fixed. Usually the clearance {{between the two is}} 5 to 40% of the thickness of the material, but dependent on the material. Clearance is defined as the separation between the blades, measured {{at the point where the}} cutting action takes place and perpendicular to the direction of blade movement. It affects the finish of the cut (burr) and the machine's power consumption. This causes the material to experience highly localized shear stresses between the punch and die. The material will then fail when the punch has moved 15 to 60% the thickness of the material, because the shear stresses are greater than the shear strength of the material and the remainder of the material is torn. Two distinct sections can be seen on a sheared workpiece, the first part being plastic deformation and the second being fractured. Because of normal inhomogeneities in materials and inconsistencies in clearance between the punch and die, the shearing action does not occur in a uniform manner. The fracture will begin at the weakest point and progress to the next weakest point until the entire workpiece has been sheared; this is what causes the rough edge. The rough edge can be reduced if the workpiece is clamped from the top with a die cushion. Above a certain pressure the fracture zone can be completely eliminated. However, the sheared edge of the workpiece will usually experience workhardening and cracking. If the workpiece has too much clearance, then it may experience roll-over or heavy burring.|$|R
40|$|PHOTO 1 : A {{preoperative}} biopsy {{should be}} done if it will help choose a therapeutic modality {{and the degree of}} therapy. The equipment needed for a biopsy include a biopsy <b>punch,</b> a scalpel <b>blade,</b> local anaesthetic such as Lidocaine, a sterile surgical drape, surgical scrub, sterile surgical gloves and suture materials. Biopsy punches are disposable and range from 2 to 6 mm in diameter. PHOTOS 2 - 3 : Larger biopsies are usually preferred by the pathologist for histological diagnosis. The junction between normal and abnormal tissue should be biopsied. Punch biopsies are used to get skin samples. The skin directly over the selected site is clipped and cleaned with a surgical scrub. A local anaesthetic is injected around the lesion and the biopsy site is scrubbed again. The skin is stretched and the biopsy punch is placed at right angles to the skin surface. The punch is rotated in one direction and firm downward pressure is applied. The punch is then angled parallel to the skin while still applying pressure. The punch is rotated to sever the base of the biopsied material and is then removed. The tissue core is elevated with the point of a needle and the base severed with a scalpel. The incision is sutured closed. REFERENCES: PHOTOS 1 - 3 : 1. Hahn, KA 2002, ‘Veterinary oncology’, Butterworth-Heinemann, Boston, pp. 50. 2.
