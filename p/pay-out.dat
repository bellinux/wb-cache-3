Instead, the Terps had their sights on the Champs Sports Bowl, to play Purdue in Orlando. According to Maryland athletic director Deborah Yow and coach Friedgen, the decision {{was based on the}} players' preference, a bigger school <b>pay-out,</b> warmer weather, a Big Ten opponent, and more media exposure. Also, the Champs Sports Bowl was deemed to be the fourth-most prestigious non-BCS bowl while the Meineke game was number-six.|$|E

A partial <b>pay-out</b> of prize money resulted in a payment of 6s 8d to each seaman {{that had been in}} the fleet that day.

Cynthia was also among the vessels sharing in the prize money from the Dutch vessels of the Vlieter Incident.|$|E

40|$|South African {{courts have}} {{experienced}} {{a rise in the}} number of cases involving schemes that promise a return on investment with interest rates which are considerably above the maximum amount allowed by law, or schemes which promise compensation from the active recruitment of participants. These schemes, which are often referred to as pyramid or Ponzi schemes, are unsustainable operations and give rise to problems in the law of insolvency. Investors in these schemes are often left empty-handed upon the scheme’s eventual collapse and insolvency. Investors who received <b>pay-outs</b> from the scheme find themselves in the defence against the trustee’s claims for the return of the <b>pay-outs</b> to the insolvent estate. As the schemes are illegal and the <b>pay-outs</b> are often in terms of void agreements, the question arises whether they can be returned to the insolvent estate. A similar situation arose in Griffiths v Janse van Rensburg 2015 ZASCA 158 (26 October 2015). The point of contention in this case was whether the illegality of the business of the scheme was a relevant consideration in determining whether the <b>pay-outs</b> were made in the ordinary course of business of the scheme. This paper discusses pyramid schemes in the context of impeachable dispositions in terms of the Insolvency Act 24 of 1936...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} {{a problem of}} risk control and dividend optimization for a financial corporation facing a constant liability payment. More specifically we investigate the case of excess-of-loss reinsurance for an insurance company. In this scheme the insurance company diverts a part of its premium stream to another company, the reinsurer, in exchange for an obligation to pick up that amount of each claim which exceeds a certain level a. The objective of the insurer is to maximize the expected present value of total future dividend <b>pay-outs.</b> We consider cases when there is restriction on the rate of dividend <b>pay-outs</b> and {{when there is no}} restriction. In both cases we describe explicitly the optimal return function as well as the optimal policy. ...|$|R

2500|$|Many {{house rules}} have emerged {{for the game}} since its creation. Well-known is the [...] "Free Parking jackpot rule", where all the money {{collected}} from Income Tax, Luxury Tax, Chance and Community Chest goes {{to the center of}} the board instead of the bank. Many people add $500 to start each pile of Free Parking money, guaranteeing a much better and more average (all closer to the average amount) <b>pay-out.</b> [...] When a player lands on Free Parking, they may take the money. Another rule is that if a player lands directly on Go, they collect double the amount, or $400, instead of $200. House rules that slow or prevent money being returned to the bank in this way may have a side effect of increasing the time it takes for players to become bankrupt, lengthening the game considerably, as well as decreasing the effects of strategy and prudent investment.|$|E
