5000|$|Before a king {{launches}} {{a war against}} another kingdom, or to repel an attack from another kingdom, the king consults the great assembly of Saltigues to predict {{the outcome of the}} battle, as was the case of Saltigué and Diaraf Wassaly Sene and Saltigué Laba Diene Ngom at the Battle of Fandane-Thiouthioune (18 July 1867), commonly known as the Battle of Somb, during the reign of Maad a Sinig Kumba Ndoffene Famak Joof. The assembly of Saltigues will predict the outcome, offer <b>precautionary</b> <b>advice</b> on when to launch the attack, the route to take to the battlefield and the animals to be sacrificed, etc. The role of Saltigue was not political.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that precautionary approaches to managing possible health risks mobile telecommunications (MT) technology may cause or exacerbate public concerns. In contrast, precautionary approaches to managing such risks in the UK have been framed as a way of reducing public concerns. This article presents evidence from a series of focus groups about publics ‟ understandings of the actions taken and advice given about potential MT health risks by the UK government. Eight focus groups were conducted with members of the public that varied in their age, their awareness and concern about mast siting, and the self-reported level of mobile phone use. From the analyses a complex picture emerged in which publics‟ understandings were not primarily framed in terms of <b>precautionary</b> action and <b>advice</b> either provoking concern or providing reassurance. People made sense of precaution by drawing upon a range of evidence from their understandings of costs and benefits of the technology, as well as the institutional context in which MT health risks were managed. For some of those involved in protesting against mast siting, precaution was seen as confirming existing concern. Further systematic exploration of the contexts within which different responses to precaution emerge i...|$|R
40|$|Understanding public {{perceptions}} of health information is of increasing {{importance in the}} light of the growing imperatives upon regulators to communicate information about risk and uncertainty. Communicating the possible health risks from mobile telecommunications is a domain that allows consideration of both {{public perceptions}} of uncertain public health information and public responses to <b>precautionary</b> <b>advice.</b> This research reports the results of a nationally representative survey in the UK (n = 1742) that explored public responses to a leaflet issued by the Department of Health (DoH) in 2000 providing information about the possible health risks of mobile phones. The aims of the study were twofold: a) to assess awareness of the leaflet and the extent to which participants could identify the <b>precautionary</b> <b>advice</b> that the leaflet contained as coming from the Government; and b) to examine publics ‟ responses to the current Government <b>precautionary</b> <b>advice</b> about mobile phone health risks; was this associated with increased concern or reassurance? The results indicate the importance of policy makers developing a clear understanding of the possible effects o...|$|E

When there are few reported cases people grow lax about precautions and the illness spreads, causing an increase in illness that forces increased precautions that force down the reports of illness.

He recognizes the impossibility of this plan, and reiterates popular <b>precautionary</b> <b>advice</b> against influenza. Newspaper article...|$|E
40|$|A {{cross-sectional}} {{field study}} {{was performed to}} evaluate infection in dogs and cats living on farms with Mycobacterium bovis-infected cattle. The purpose was to determine pet infection status and assess their risk to farm families and/or tuberculosis-free livestock. Data and specimens were collected from 18 cats and five dogs from nine participating farms. ELISA testing for M. bovis and M. avium was conducted. Fifty-one biological samples were cultured; all were negative for M. bovis, although other Mycobacterium species were recovered. No radiographic, serological or skin test evidence of mycobacterial infection was found. These negative results {{may be due to}} the low level of M. bovis infection in the cattle and the limited duration of exposure of pets to infected cattle residing on the same farm. No evidence was found to indicate that pets residing on M. bovis-infected Michigan cattle farms pose a risk to humans or M. bovis-free livestock; however, <b>precautionary</b> <b>advice</b> for farm owners was provided...|$|E
40|$|Management of {{zoonotic}} disease is necessary if countryside users are to gain benefit rather than suffer harm from their activities, {{and to avoid}} disproportionate reaction to novel threats. We introduce a conceptual framework based on the pressure-state-response model with five broad responses to disease incidence. Influencing public behaviour is one response and requires risk communication based on an integration {{of knowledge about the}} disease with an understanding of how publics respond to <b>precautionary</b> <b>advice.</b> A second framework emphasizes how risk communication involves more than information provision and should address dimensions including points-of intervention over time, place and audience. The frameworks are developed by reference to tick-borne Lyme borreliosis (also known as Lyme disease), for which informed precautionary behaviour is particularly relevant. Interventions to influence behaviour can be directed by knowledge of spatial and temporal variation of tick abundance, what constitutes risky behaviour, how people respond to information of varying content, and an understanding of the social practices related to countryside use. The frameworks clarify the response options and help identify who is responsible for risk communication. These aspects are not consistently understood, and may result in an underestimation of the role of land-based organizations in facilitating appropriate precautionary behaviour...|$|E
40|$|The {{official}} published version can {{be obtained}} from the link below - Copyright @ Taylor & FrancisThere is a widespread academic and policy debate about public responses to precaution in public health campaigns. This paper explores these issues in relation to the precautionary stance adopted in the UK around the regulation of mobile telecommunications. The aim of the paper is to examine the nature of attitudes to precaution, {{and the way in which}} these, along with other relevant variables, relate to the intention to adopt relevant behaviours. The results from an experimental study (n = 173) indicate that people distinguish between two dimensions of precaution: firstly in relation to its value or necessity per se and secondly as anchored to notions of governance. The two variables differentially relate to other variables including trust and uncertainty, and are predictive of intended behaviour change indirectly, through worry about mobile phone risks. <b>Precautionary</b> <b>advice</b> was generally interpreted as causing concern rather than providing reassurance. The results suggest that precaution may be considered a valuable stance but this does not mean that it is seen as good governance or that it will reduce concern. Whilst the discourse of precaution is aimed at reducing concern, it appears that the uptake of relevant behaviours is largely triggered by worry...|$|E
40|$|Background In 1998, the UK {{government}} issued <b>precautionary</b> <b>advice</b> that {{pregnant or}} breast-feeding {{women with a}} family history of atopy, may wish to avoid eating peanuts during pregnancy and lactation. This study aimed to assess the compliance with this recommendation and investigate its impact upon peanut sensitization. Methods A total of 858 children born immediately after the advice were followed for 2 years and assessed for peanut sensitization. A standardized questionnaire was used to ascertain history of atopy and maternal exposure to peanuts during pregnancy. Following parental consent children were skin prick tested to assess sensitization to peanuts. Results Sixty-five per cent of mothers had avoided peanuts during pregnancy. Forty-two per cent of the mothers had heard about the government advice, and half modified their diet as a consequence. Neither maternal nor family history of atopy had any significant effect on peanut consumption. Parity did play a role, and mothers having their first child were twice as likely to change their diet (P < 0. 001). Mothers of 77 % of the children sensitized to peanuts had avoided peanuts during pregnancy. In this cohort study maternal consumption of peanut during pregnancy was not associated with peanut sensitization in the infant. Conclusions The majority of mothers in this cohort avoided peanut consumption during pregnancy. It is likely that either the government advice is misunderstood by mothers, or that those who communicate the advice have not fully explained who it is targeted at...|$|E
40|$|The present {{survey was}} {{undertaken}} to investigate consumers’ {{knowledge of the}} main foodborne agents and dietary regimen during pregnancy. Data were collected using monthly questionnaires available on IZSalimenTO website between March 2013 and January 2014. Hepatitis A virus questionnaire: 20 respondents (77 %) recognized berries as foodstuff linked to the outbreak of hepatitis A. The majority correctly indicated as <b>precautionary</b> <b>advice</b> to boil berries before consumption. Botulism questionnaire: 29 respondents (62 %) indicated pesto as food involved in botulism alert in July 2013. The risk of infant botulism in infant less than 1 year old due to honey consumption is known by 24 respondents (51 %). Main foodborne disease questionnaire: the risk of infection by Salmonella after the consumption of foods made with raw eggs is known by the majority (94 %; N= 17) {{as well as the}} treatments to be applied in order to make fresh fish safe from parasites (76 %). Pregnancy questionnaire: 20 respondents (74 %) believed that washing vegetables and fruits with sodium bicarbonate or chlorate solution is able to inactivate Toxoplasma; only 4 (15 %) reported both raw meat and vegetables washed with sodium bicarbonate as food at risk. Results indicate that all consumers should be trained on behaviour and dietary regimen to be adopted in pregnancy and in infant < 1 year old.

30|$|Adding pictograms, {{icons and}} symbols to PCP labels is another {{recommended}} addition. Comprehensibility testing of potential pictograms, however, {{should be conducted}} before any pictograms are legislated for use. For example, the GHS pictograms were not subjected to global comprehensibility testing prior {{to the development of}} the first purple book. Comprehensibility testing, based on the University of Cape Town’s testing methodology, took place too late [82] as there was no option for changing or adapting these pictograms. The GHS building block approach does, however, allow for countries to add additional pictograms that are relevant for the country context [5]. We do not recommend introducing more pictograms with a global scope since pictograms are not cross-culturally transferable or intuitively obvious [69]. Research has shown that pictograms are not clearly understood by consumers - especially the GHS pictogram for acute toxicity (Figure  1 a) [4]. We recommend that a mechanism be put in place for countries to evaluate and upgrade legally binding pictograms to improve RC. We therefore support the plan proposed by ECHA to perform a new analysis by 2015 before mixtures will have to be labeled with the new GHS pictograms [66]. The question of cross-cultural comprehension of pictograms as scientifically intended is illustrated by whether these are understood in the same way by an illiterate South African farm worker as by a Finnish professor. Importantly, misinterpretations of label information can even increase the health risk [69]. To reduce misinterpretations, we recommend clear hazard statements on the label with <b>precautionary</b> <b>advice.</b> We also recommend that any pictograms or icons used on labels have the meaning printed in clear and concise words underneath.|$|E

Also {{available}} from the publisher at: [URL] Open AccessAwareness that maternal diet may influence the outcome of pregnancy as well as the long-term health of mother and child has increased in recent years. A new food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was developed and validated specifically for the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa). The MoBa FFQ is a semi-quantitative tool which covers the average intake of food, beverages and dietary supplements during the first 4 to 5 months of pregnancy. It includes questions about intakes of 255 foods and dishes and was used from 2002 onwards. Data assessed by the MoBa FFQ is available for 87, 700 pregnancies. Numerous sub-studies have examined associations between dietary factors and health outcomes in MoBa. The aim {{of this paper is to}} summarize the results from 19 studies of maternal diet and pregnancy outcomes, which is the complete collection of studies based on the MoBa FFQ and published before September 2014. The overall research question is whether maternal diet – from single substances to dietary patterns – matters for pregnancy outcome. The pregnancy outcomes studied till now include birth size measures, infants being small and large for gestational age, pregnancy duration, preterm delivery, preeclampsia, as well as maternal gestational weight gain and postpartum weight retention. As a whole, the results from these studies corroborate that the current dietary recommendations to pregnant women are sound and that maternal diet during pregnancy is likely to contribute to reduce the risk of pregnancy complications including preterm birth, preeclampsia, and reduced foetal growth. The results provide supporting evidence for recommending pregnant women to consume vegetables, fruit, whole grain, fish, dairy, and water regularly and lower the intake of sugar sweetened beverages, processed meat products and salty snacks. The results showing negative impact of even low levels of environmental contaminants support the <b>precautionary</b> <b>advice</b> on consumption of foods containing these. New findings are that particularly lean fish explained the positive association between seafood intake and foetal growth, and the indications of a protective effect of probiotic and antimicrobial foods on pregnancy outcomes. This points to the importance of diet composition for a healthy gut flora and the body’s immune response. Although these studies are observational and cannot infer causality, the results identify diet as an important modifiable lifestyle factor, suggesting that healthy eating, defined as following the official recommendations, is particularly important in pregnancy...|$|E
