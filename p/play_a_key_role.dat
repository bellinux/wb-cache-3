The driving force behind this programme was the highly experienced Colonel (later Major General) William Green, who was to <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> <b>role</b> a few years later as chief engineer of Gibraltar.

5|$|Asexual {{organizations}} and other Internet resources <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> <b>role</b> in informing people about asexuality. The lack of research {{makes it difficult}} for doctors to understand the causation. Like with any sexual orientation, most people who are asexual are self-identified. This can be a problem when asexuality is mistaken for an intimacy or relationship problem or for other symptoms that do not define asexuality. There is also a significant population that either does not understand or does not believe in asexuality, which adds to the importance of these organizations to inform the general population; however, {{due to the lack of}} scientific fact on the subject, what these groups promote as information is often questioned.|$|E

These innovations saw him <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> <b>role</b> {{in the development of}} traditional flamenco and the evolution of new flamenco and Latin jazz fusion from the 1970s.

In recent years, they have been engaged in international peacekeeping operations including the UN peacekeeping. Recent tensions, particularly with North Korea, have reignited the debate over the status of the JSDF and its relation to Japanese society. New military guidelines, announced in December 2010, will direct the JSDF away from its Cold War focus on the former Soviet Union to a focus on China, especially regarding the territorial dispute over the Senkaku Islands.|$|E
5|$|Neutrophils also <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> <b>role</b> in the {{development}} of most forms of acute lung injury. Here, activated neutrophils release the contents of their toxic granules into the lung environment. Experiments have shown that a {{reduction in the number of}} neutrophils lessens the effects of acute lung injury, but treatment by inhibiting neutrophils is not clinically realistic, as it would leave the host vulnerable to infection. In the liver, damage by neutrophils can contribute to dysfunction and injury in response to the release of endotoxins produced by bacteria, sepsis, trauma, alcoholic hepatitis, ischemia, and hypovolemic shock resulting from acute hemorrhage.|$|E
5|$|Similarly {{to other}} Brazilian universities, Unicamp offers no {{large-scale}} in-campus housing, and most students live either near the campus or in Campinas.

Clarke and the other deception planners reasoned that a high-profile appearance outside the United Kingdom would suggest that an Allied invasion was not imminent. An appropriate look-alike was found, M. E. Clifton James, who spent a short time with Montgomery to familiarise himself with the general's mannerisms. On 26 May 1944, James flew first to Gibraltar and then to Algiers, making appearances where the Allies knew German intelligence agents would spot him. He then flew secretly to Cairo and remained in hiding until Montgomery's public appearance in Normandy following the invasion.|$|E

It is {{believed}} to <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> <b>role</b> in the social interactions of horses as well as detecting other key scents in the environment. Horses have two olfactory centers. The first system is in the nostrils and nasal cavity, which analyze a wide range of odors. The second, located under the nasal cavity, are the Vomeronasal organs, also called Jacobson's organs. These have a separate nerve pathway to the brain and appear to primarily analyze pheromones.|$|E
