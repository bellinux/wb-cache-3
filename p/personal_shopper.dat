500|$|The fashion press {{tends to}} take special {{interest}} in First Ladies. The traditional role of a First Lady as the nation's hostess puts her personal appearance and style under scrutiny, and the attention to Pat was lively. Women's Wear Daily stated that Pat had a [...] "good figure and good posture", as well as [...] "the best-looking legs of any woman in public life today". Some fashion writers tended to have a lackluster opinion of her well tailored, but nondescript, American-made clothes. [...] "I consider it my duty to use American designers", she said, and favored them because, [...] "they are now using so many materials which are great for traveling because they're non crushable". She preferred to buy readymade garments rather than made-to-order outfits. [...] "I'm a size 10," [...] she told The New York Times. [...] "I can just walk in and buy. I've bought things in various stores in various cities. Only some of my clothes are by designers." [...] She did, however, wear the custom work of some well-known talents, notably Geoffrey Beene, {{at the suggestion of}} Clara Treyz, her <b>personal</b> <b>shopper.</b> Many fashion observers concluded that Pat Nixon did not greatly advance the cause of American fashion. Nixon's yellow-satin inaugural gown by Harvey Berin was criticized as [...] "a schoolteacher on her night out", but Treyz defended her wardrobe selections by saying, [...] "Mrs. Nixon must be ladylike." ...|$|E
500|$|Robert Kardashian (19442003) and Kristen Mary [...] "Kris" [...] Houghton (born 1955) {{married in}} 1978, and had four {{children}} together: daughters Kourtney (born 1979), Kim (born 1980), and Khloé (born 1984), and son Rob (born 1987). The couple divorced in 1991. In 1994, Robert rose to prominence when he defended O. J. Simpson for the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman during the O.J. Simpson trial. In 1991, Kris married retired Olympic decathlon champion Bruce Jenner (born 1949; now known as Caitlyn Jenner after undergoing a gender transition in 2015). Bruce and Kris had two daughters together, Kendall (born 1995) and Kylie (born 1997). Robert died in 2003, eight weeks after being diagnosed with esophageal cancer. The Kardashian sisters began appearing in the media spotlight more often. In 2004, Kim became a personal stylist for recording artist Brandy Norwood. She eventually developed into a full-time stylist, and was a <b>personal</b> <b>shopper</b> and stylist for actress Lindsay Lohan. Khloé, Kim, and Kourtney ventured further into fashion, opening a high fashion boutique Dash in Calabasas, California. Throughout Kim's early career, {{she was involved in}} some high-profile relationships including Brandy Norwood's brother, singer Ray J, and later, singer Nick Lachey. In 2006, Kourtney starred in her first reality television series, [...] In February 2007, a home sex video that Kim made with Ray J years earlier was leaked. Vivid Entertainment bought the rights for $1 million and released the film as Kim Kardashian: Superstar on February 21. Kim sued Vivid for ownership of the tape, but dropped the suit in April 2007 settling with Vivid Entertainment for $5 million. It is often assumed that the release of the sex tape was a major contributor to the rising fame of Kim Kardashian and her family.|$|E

Unlike earlier forays into the suburbs that consisted of smaller boutique-style shops, this was a merchandising effort that became the model for modern suburban shopping. The store consisted of 66 individual shops. Lord & Taylor's relationship with Raymond Loewy Associates continued until 1969, following the construction of the Stamford, Connecticut, store (designed by Loewy Vice President Andrew Geller).Many of Lord & Taylor's special services, including <b>personal</b> <b>shoppers,</b> were introduced while Shaver presided.

40|$|Purpose: {{the focus}} of this study was on {{exploring}} the application of psychological research methods (as yet not applied) in the fashion arena. The aim of this project was to quantify, formalise and explore the causal relationships between clothing style, preference, personality factors, emotions and mood with a view to better understand the psychological profile of the fashion consumer. Design Methodology/approach: using a uniformly composed sample of females, explorative, quantitative research was carried out. Two sets of questionnaires were administered to the sample to examine emotion, mood and personality before trying on a set of eight garments categorized according to style, and again after to examine emotion and mood while wearing each outfit. Photographs of them were taken wearing each of the outfits. They then ranked the eight outfits into order of preference. SPSS analysis identified relationships and preference indicators. Findings: the results indicated strong relationships between mood and significant relationships between three out of five personality factors and clothing style preference; mood {{was a significant predictor of}} preference, whilst personality was moderate. Research limitations/implications: the research methodology necessitated lengthy time commitments from the participants and therefore limited the sample size making generalization difficult. Based on the findings, the research requires further exploration of methods for practical application with a larger sample size. Practical implications: personality, emotion and mood were shown to be managed and reflected through clothing with implications for assistance in consumer clothing decisions, service training, and strategies for <b>personal</b> <b>shoppers,</b> market segmentation and design. Originality/value of the paper: the methodology derived from a combination of research methods coupled with actual wearing experience, previously not studied together. This is original and demonstrates how important this combination is to fully appreciate the psychological profile of the fashion consumer.

40|$|This is a {{multidisciplinary}} information systems thesis {{with a strong}} sociological focus. Theoretically it uses the technical concerns of human-computer interaction as the background to consider the separate theories of consumer decision-making and the diffusion of innovations. Emphasis is placed on understanding how consumers {{make sense of the}} Internet and come to define the role and use of the Internet in their lives. A practical framework for hermeneutic investigation was created to access the unreflective thoughts and actions driving online consumer decision-making. Implicit within hermeneutics is the prospect of transcendental interpretations and the ability to investigate in situ new avenues of research that emerge as a result of anomalous comments or findings. Hence, this thesis presents two different, but inter-related, research inquiries and their associated findings. Initial interest was centred on consumer behaviour and interface design. Specifically, can a dedicated 'consumer interface' be designed using principles based on consumer perceptions of online convenience. The resulting data analysis created a framework of advice that interface designers can use to improve their understanding of the nature and limitations of convenient interfaces and associated consumer decision-support technologies. A second research theme emerged from the data analysis which broadened the focus into a consideration of online consumer behaviour as a distinct issue. Specifically, a new from of interactive behaviour prevalent in electronic retail markets was identified and, following a second literature review, labeled "surrogacy". Related in form to the <b>personal</b> <b>shoppers</b> found in traditional marketplaces, surrogacy differs from electronic intermediaries with regard to (i) the motivations of use and (ii) the symbolic and functional benefits of usage. The emergence of this phenomenon suggests that interactions between individuals (as consumers) and Web-based systems are maturing, albeit in a non-predictable manner. Together, the methodological refinements presented here with the accompanying research findings provide a reference point for further work in the following three areas: interface design for electronic marketplaces; Web-based consumer decision support technologies; and the development of interpretive approaches suitable for socio-technical investigations.
