500|$|Peat {{was more}} {{absorbent}} than straw, and {{as there were}} huge numbers of working horses at the time, it was promoted {{as a replacement for}} straw. It could also be used for packing of fruit, as a replacement for sandbags, for fertiliser and as <b>potting</b> <b>compost,</b> as well as the manufacture of paraffin, creosote and tar. The owners of Thorne and Hatfield Moors leased their lands to peat companies, whose workers would dig drains, cut the turves, and stack them up to allow them to dry, so that they were ready for sale. The product was in competition with imports from the Netherlands, and the Dutch Griendtsveen Company set up the Griendtsveen Moss Litter Company in 1893, a holding company which would buy up companies operating in the Netherlands and in the United Kingdom. The works at Moorends kept its ledgers in Dutch and English, and a number of Dutch workers relocated to Thorne. By 1899, there were some 120 Dutch workers, forming a community of 300 with their wives and children, and there was concern among local people that they would lose their own jobs. Dutch tools and working practices were introduced, and the immigrants cut around [...] of canals to transport peat to the mill at Moorends. The iron barges used on the canals were [...] long, and were double ended, as they could not be turned round. A total of twelve were built in the Netherlands, and remained in use until 1922, when Moorends Mill burnt down. The barges were cut up, and the mill was not rebuilt, although some of the other buildings were used as workhops until 1956.|$|E
50|$|Houseplants are {{generally}} grown in specialized soils called <b>potting</b> <b>compost</b> or potting soil, not in local natural soil. A good <b>potting</b> <b>compost</b> mixture includes soil conditioners {{to provide the}} plant with nutrients, support, adequate drainage, and proper aeration. Most potting composts contain a combination of peat and vermiculite or perlite. Concern over environmental damage to peat bogs, however, is leading to the replacement of peat by coir (coconut fibre), which is a sustainable resource. A nutrient rich compost can usually be bought wherever potted plants are sold.|$|E

40|$|Samples of <b>potting</b> <b>composts</b> {{for raising}} {{tomatoes}} on holdings in the South Holland glasshouse district {{were collected in}} 1960 and 1961. In propagation experiments with soil blocks, fresh weight of young tomato plants were found to vary widely. Some 3 / 4 out of the investigated composts were not suitable for raising plants. Soil analyses proved that under the given conditions many composts had an insufficient amount of plant available nitrogen, measured by means of N-value which is defined as mg water soluble N per 100 ml soil. Further investigations on composts for raising tomato plants in soil blocks showed that {{the relation between the}} optimal nitrogen dressing (N d in mg N per l, or g N per m 3) and N-value is given by: N d = 10 [35 - N-value]. Plant growth in the growers' <b>potting</b> <b>composts</b> was also influenced by soil physical condition measured as the air filled pore content at pF = 1, 0 or as the organic fraction> 1000 μin % of the total organic matter. The respective content should be at least 6 % or 30 %. Experiments with series of transplants from different compost qualities showed that heavier plants made a better crop and produced a higher early and total yield. Overall stem height and fresh weight of the transplants were most accurate for predicting yields by means of regression equations, while the number of leaves at least 3 cm long and the stage of development of the first inflorescence were less accurate. It is supposed that in the Netherlands the variation in yields of glasshouse tomatoes is partly due to poor <b>potting</b> <b>composts</b> for propagation; the decrease in potential during 1960 - 1965 is estimated at about 20 million guilders a year...|$|R

50|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} uses for waste tires that are beneficial in helping {{reduce the amount of}} waste tires in stockpiles. Recycled Waste Tires are used in creating Synthetic Turf in sports arenas. Synthetic Turf is made up of Crumb rubber which is recycled rubber from automotive or truck scrap tires. Waste Tires are also used to make Rubber Mulch which is used in gardens and playgrounds. Waste Tires have also been known to be used in making track and field pavements, roads, and shooting targets. Recycled Waste Tires have several recreational uses. Recycled Waste Tires are used for tire swings, flower <b>pots,</b> <b>compost</b> bins, retaining walls, and sandals in developing companies. Recycled Waste Tires can also be used as fuel energy. Waste Tires used as fuel are either shredded or whole, depending on the combustion device being used. The type of fuel produced from Waste Tires is known as Tire-derived fuel (TDF).|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{acquired}} azole resistance in Aspergillus fumigatus has been increasingly reported and a domi-nant mechanism of resistance (TR 34 /L 98 H) {{was found in}} clinical and environmental isolates. The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate the prevalence of azole resistance in environmental A. fumigatus iso-lates collected in northern Italy. A. fumigatus grew from 29 of 47 soil samples analysed. Azole-resistant isolates were detected in 13 % (6 / 47) of the soil sam-ples and in 21 % (6 / 29) of the soil samples containing A. fumigatus. High minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of itraconazole (≥ 16 mg/L) and posaconazole (≥ 0. 5 mg/L) were displayed by nine isolates from six different soil samples, namely apple orchard (1 sam-ple), rose <b>pot</b> <b>compost</b> (2 samples), and cucurbit yields (3 samples). Seven isolates had a MIC= 2 mg/L of vori-conazole. Seven of nine itraconazole and posacona-zole resistant isolates harboured the same TR 34 /L 98 H mutation of cyp 51 A. These findings, together with the occurrence of resistant clinical isolates, suggest that azole resistance should be considered in primary patient care...|$|R

40|$|Twelve {{isolates}} {{from the}} genus Agaricus (Fungi, Basidiomycota) were investigated {{for their ability}} to support development of the phorid fly, Megaselia halterata (Wood), which is an important pest of the commercial white button mushroom Agaricus bisporus. Combined effects of oviposition of adult female M. halterata and larval development in mushroom compost inoculated with Agaricus mycelium were determined using bioassays. The numbers of M. halterata offspring that developed were affected by the Agaricus isolate used, and there was a significant separation between resistant and susceptible isolates. In a bioassay where the female phorids had a choice of all 12 isolates for oviposition, three isolates produced > 200 adults per 100 g <b>compost</b> <b>pot</b> while the remaining nine isolates had 100 adults per 100 g <b>compost</b> <b>pot</b> while the remainder resulted in < 4 adults per pot.

40|$|Dickeya solani {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} pectinolytic phytopathogens responsible for high losses in potato, especially in seed potato production in Europe. Lytic bacteriophages can affect the structure of the host population and may influence spread, survival and virulence of the pathogen and in consequence, infection of the plant. In this study, we aimed to acquire information on the viability of the broad host lytic bacteriophage ΦD 5 on potato, as well as to apprehend the specific effect of this bacteriophage on its host D. solani type-strain in different settings, as a preliminary step to target co-adaptation of phages and host bacteria in plant environment. Viability of the ΦD 5 phage in tuber extract, on tuber surface, in <b>potting</b> <b>compost,</b> in rainwater and on the leaf surface, as well as the effect of copper sulfate, were examined under laboratory conditions.
