5|$|The {{silvertip shark}} is caught by {{commercial}} and artisan fisheries across its range using longlines, gillnets, and trawls, both intentionally and as bycatch. The fins are highly valued for shark fin soup and are {{sold on the}} export market, along with the skin and cartilage. The meat is marketed locally, fresh or dried and salted, as are the jaws and teeth. Silvertip sharks {{are known to be}} taken by fisheries in Indonesia, Myanmar, and the Philippines, as well as by various Indian Ocean nations with coral reef fisheries; it is also an increasingly important catch of <b>pelagic</b> <b>fisheries,</b> where it is often finned at sea. This species is susceptible to overfishing, due to its slow reproductive rate and tendency to stay in a certain area. It {{is believed to have been}} extirpated by Indonesian artisan fishers at Scott Reef off northern Australia, and is likely becoming rare in many other parts of its range. As a result, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed the silvertip shark as Vulnerable.|$|E

40|$|Bali Strait has {{potential}} abundance of <b>pelagic</b> <b>fishery</b> {{resources such as}} Indonesian oil sardine (lemuru), frigate mackerel (tongkol), scad mackerel (layang), short-bodied mackerel (kembung) and others which can be caught mostly using purse seine. Fishery resources are combined and also known asmultispecies; therefore this research aimed to analyze the model of bio-economic multispecies exploitation of <b>pelagic</b> <b>fishery</b> resources in Bali Strait. The analytical methods that used in this research were estimated dynamic model of Walters and Hilborn (1976) and analysis of bio-economic model. The results showed that actual production of exploitation of <b>pelagic</b> <b>fishery</b> resources in Bali Strait, was lower than the rate of sustainable production especially Indonesian oil sardine and short-bodied mackerel. Production and fishing effort were below the actual optimal value. The management of <b>pelagic</b> <b>fishery</b> resources in Bali Strait did not show a good level of economic efficiency.

The results of the biological and economic analysis of the small <b>pelagic</b> <b>fishery</b> in the Philippines lead to two conclusions: First, small pelagic fish stocks are subjected to levels of fishing effort far beyond that necessary to generate Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) let alone Maximum Economic Yield (MEY). Second, and as a result, both sectors are sustaining economic losses (negative economic rents) implying inefficiencies {{in the use of}} labor and capital in the small <b>pelagic</b> <b>fishery.</b> Solutions to the problems of overexploitation will rest not only within the fishery sector, but, more importantly, in sectors outside its traditional realm.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Documentary {{scientific}} evidence supports {{the notion that}} the small <b>pelagics</b> <b>fishery</b> in the Gulf of California does not measurably affect the physical habitat or the functional relationships between the species comprising the pelagic ecosystem. Also, there is little information that suggests any negative effects of the small <b>pelagic</b> <b>fishery</b> operations on critically endangered, endemic species, i. e., vaquita and totoaba. Under the current management regime, small <b>pelagics</b> <b>fishery</b> in the Gulf of California has recovered twice from collapses during the last 30 years. Although the small pelagics abundance varies greatly, the long-term productivity of the target species and the structure and function of the pelagic ecosystem are not compromised because the fishery relies on a suitable logistic and administrative platform, which is consistent with international standards for responsible fisheries, precautionary approach and ecosystem-based fisheries management principles...|$|R

40|$|Commercial {{fisheries}} {{are recognized}} as one of the greatest threats to shark populations worldwide, but factors affecting the likelihood of shark mortality during fishery capture are poorly understood. We used the U. S. <b>pelagic</b> <b>fishery</b> logbook data from 1992 through 2008 to quantify the effects of several variables (fisheries regulatory periods, geographic zone, target catch, and sea surface temperature) on mortality of blue sharks (Prionace glauca) and tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier). Mortality rates and trends in both species closely matched those recorded from other sources, and therefore indicated that the data on sharks discarded dead and discarded alive in the U. S. <b>pelagic</b> <b>fishery</b> logbook are accurate. The introduction of fisheries management regulations (fin weight to carcass weight ratios in 1993 [to prevent finning] and the prohibition of J-hooks in 2004) presumably decreased the immediate mortality rate of captured blue and tiger sharks (by 8. 0 % in blue sharks after 2004 and 4. 4 % in tiger sharks after 1993). Other factors that we examined had a statistically significant effect on mortality, but additional variables should be recorded or made available in logbook data to enable the determination of other causes of mortality. Our results show that the U. S. <b>pelagic</b> <b>fishery</b> logbook data can be used as a powerful tool in future studies of the immediate mortality of longline-caught animals...|$|R
