5|$|The {{demersal}} zone supports {{many animals}} that feed on benthic organisms or seek protection from predators. The seabed provides {{a range of}} habitats on or {{under the surface of}} the substrate which are used by creatures adapted to these conditions. The tidal zone with its periodic exposure to dehydrating air is home to barnacles, molluscs, and crustaceans. The neritic zone has many organisms that need light to flourish. Here, sponges, echinoderms, polychaete worms, sea anemones, and other invertebrates live among algal-encrusted rocks. Corals often contain photosynthetic symbionts and live in shallow waters where light penetrates. The extensive calcareous skeletons they extrude build up into coral reefs which are an important feature of the seabed. These provide a diverse habitat for reef dwelling organisms. There is less sea life on the floor of deeper seas but marine life also flourishes around seamounts that rise from the depths, where fish and other animals congregate to spawn and feed. Close to the seabed live demersal fish that largely feed on <b>pelagic</b> <b>organisms</b> or benthic invertebrates. Exploration of the deep sea by submersibles revealed a new world of creatures living on the seabed that scientists had not previously expected. Some like the detritivores rely on organic material falling to the ocean floor. Others cluster round deep-sea hydrothermal vents where mineral-rich flows of water emerge, supporting communities whose primary producers are sulphide-oxidizing chemoautotrophic bacteria and whose consumers include specialized bivalves, sea anemones, barnacles, crabs, worms, and fish. A dead whale sinking {{to the bottom of the}} ocean provides food for an assembly of organisms which similarly rely largely on the actions of sulphur-reducing bacteria. Such places support unique biomes where many new microbes and other lifeforms have been discovered.|$|E

Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE 6) modeling software was used to explore direct and indirect drivers of ecosystem dynamics of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and Suisun Bay, with emphasis on the <b>Pelagic</b> <b>Organism</b> Decline species (delta smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus), threadfin shad (Dorosoma petenense), longfin smelt (Spirinchus thaleicthys), and striped bass (Morone saxatilis)). An Ecopath model was built to simulate the Delta and Suisun Bay ecosystem for the year 1982 based on best available data. The Ecopath modeling approach incorporates trophic interactions and community food web structure to help understand the dynamic interactions between trophic groups. The model uses parameters such as biomass, production, and mortality estimates of 40 functional groups, including birds, fish, benthic invertebrates, zooplankton, phytoplankton, and detritus. Model parameters were calculated from published and unpublished data taken from the literature or estimated by local experts when appropriate. The balanced Delta Ecopath model gave some surprising results about the food-web within the Delta. Of the total system biomass (270. 5 t km- 2) 37...|$|R

40|$|In {{spite of}} the ongoing {{discussion}} about the functioning of filtratory apparatus of the filter feeding freshwater <b>pelagic</b> <b>organism</b> of the genus Daphnia, experiments suggest food size selectivity {{as well as a}} high degree of adaptability of filtration to food organism size. A model of feeding adaptation of a filter feeder in the framework of a pelagic ecosystem is constructed by modifying the simplified ecosystem model AQUAMOD for the presence of several species of algae of different size. The assumption that filtration adaptability is an optimization type process is incorporated. Two possible strategies were followed: an instantaneous optimality at each time interval and an integral formulation, maximization of the integral biomass over 1 -year time period. Numerical simulations as well as theoretical calculations were performed with the model. The results suggest, that the feedback between food selection by Daphnia and algal size composition is very strong. When growth rates of several species of algae of different size is limited by a single nutrient and a value of Daphnia filter density is constant, competitive exclusion principle may hold, only one species survives. Simulations for different constant values of Daphnia filter density show an effect not only on the size of algae surviving, but also on the number of species able to survive. The integral formulation results in higher biomass suggesting that the organisms do better if not reacting only on immediate changes but having developed mechanisms consistent with more long-term considerations...|$|R
