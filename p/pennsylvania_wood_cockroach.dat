50|$|The <b>Pennsylvania</b> <b>wood</b> <b>cockroach</b> {{has three}} {{developmental}} stages: egg, nymph, and adult. Eggs are laid in egg capsules, produced during the warm months and deposited behind the loose bark of dead trees, fallen logs, or stumps. Egg capsules are yellowish brown and characteristically curved {{on both sides}} like a half moon. Capsules are {{twice as long as}} wide, each containing up to 32 eggs. The egg stage lasts about 34 days at 80 °F, while the nymphal stage typically lasts 10 to 12 months but can last up to 2 years. The normal life span of the female adult is several months.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pennsylvania</b> <b>wood</b> <b>cockroaches</b> feed {{primarily}} on decaying organic matter. Both {{female and male}} <b>Pennsylvania</b> <b>wood</b> <b>cockroaches</b> have been found under shingles and {{on the inside of}} garages. They rarely breed indoors. However, with the growing use of firewood, the popularity of cedar shake shingles, and the continual building of homes in wooded areas, problems with <b>Pennsylvania</b> <b>wood</b> <b>cockroaches</b> will probably escalate.|$|R

40|$|<b>Wood</b> <b>cockroaches</b> are an {{important}} prey of the red-cockaded woodpecker, Picoides borealis, an endangered species inhabiting pine forests in the southern United States. These woodpeckers forage on the boles of live pine trees, but their prey consists of {{a high proportion of}} <b>wood</b> <b>cockroaches,</b> Parcoblatta spp., that are more commonly associated with dead plant material. Cockroach population density samples were conducted on live pine trees, dead snags and coarse woody debris on the ground.

40|$|<b>Wood</b> <b>cockroaches</b> in {{the genus}} Parcoblatta, {{comprising}} 12 species endemic to North America, are highly abundant in southeastern pine forests and represent an important prey {{of the endangered}} red-cockaded woodpecker, Picoides borealis. The broad <b>wood</b> <b>cockroach,</b> Parcoblatta lata, is among {{the largest and most}} abundant of the <b>wood</b> <b>cockroaches,</b> constituting > 50 % of the biomass of the woodpecker's diet. Because reproduction in red-cockaded woodpeckers is affected dramatically by seasonal and spatial changes in arthropod availability, monitoring P. lata populations could serve as a useful index of habitat suitability for woodpecker conservation and forest management efforts. Female P. lata emit a volatile, long-distance sex pheromone, which, once identified and synthesized, could be deployed for monitoring cockroach populations. We describe here the identification, synthesis, and confirmation of the chemical structure of this pheromone as (4 Z, 11 Z) -oxacyclotrideca- 4, 11 -dien- 2 -one [= (3 Z, 10 Z) -dodecadienolide; herein referred to as “parcoblattalactone”]. This macrocyclic lactone is a previously unidentified natural product and a previously unknown pheromonal structure for cockroaches, highlighting the great chemical diversity that characterizes olfactory communication in cockroaches: Each long-range sex pheromone identified to date from different genera belongs to a different chemical class. Parcoblattalactone was biologically active in electrophysiological assays and attracted not only P. lata but also several other Parcoblatta species in pine forests, underscoring its utility in monitoring several endemic <b>wood</b> <b>cockroach</b> species in red-cockaded woodpecker habitats...|$|R

50|$|Blaptica dubia, the Dubia roach, {{also known}} as the orange-spotted cockroach, Guyana spotted <b>cockroach,</b> or Argentinian <b>wood</b> <b>cockroach,</b> is a {{medium-sized}} species of cockroach which grows to around 4.0 - 4.5 cm. They are sexually dimorphic; adult males have full wings covering their body, while females have only tiny wing stubs, their tegmina (forewings) being around a fourth of their body length.|$|R
50|$|Houses {{located within}} woods will {{sometimes}} have <b>wood</b> <b>cockroaches</b> crawl under siding; especially homes with cedar shake shingles. To cockroaches, the house {{may represent a}} fallen tree and a new location for nesting. A wide lawn will inhibit cockroaches crawling from the surrounding woods to the house. The use of window screening and caulking to prevent entry is a good structural tactic.|$|R

50|$|The Florida <b>woods</b> <b>cockroach</b> (Eurycotis floridana), {{palmetto}} bug, {{is a large}} {{species of}} cockroach which typically grows to a length of 30 - 40 mm. When alarmed, adults can eject an extremely foul smelling directional spray up to one meter, which inspired several of its other common names: Florida skunk roach, Florida stinkroach, skunk cockroach, skunk roach, stinking cockroach, and stinkroach. Two other naming variations include Florida <b>cockroach</b> and Florida <b>woods</b> roach.|$|R

5000|$|The species {{occurs in}} open, timbered areas with little ground cover. According to {{entomologist}} Fred A. Lawson, it is [...] "often seen on tree trunks and lower branches of oaks and elms after dark." [...] Nymphs and adults {{are also found}} outdoors beneath loose bark in woodpiles, stumps, and hollow trees. Brought indoors on infested firewood, they wander about the house without congregating in any particular room. They can be especially troublesome during the mating season, which is during May and June. Male <b>wood</b> <b>cockroaches</b> frequently travel in large numbers and fly considerable distances. They are attracted to lights at night and may gain entry indoors. Large numbers may {{also be found in}} rain gutters of homes.|$|R
40|$|Abstract This study {{determined}} if short-term {{removal of}} coarse woody debris would reduce prey available to red-cockaded woodpeckers (Picoides borealis Vieillot) and other bark-foraging birds at the Savannah River Site in Aiken and Barnwell counties, SC. All coarse woody debris {{was removed from}} four 9 -ha plots of mature loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) in 1997 and again in 1998. We sampled arthropods in coarse woody debris removal and control stands using crawl traps that captured arthropods crawling up tree boles, burlap bands wrapped around trees, and cardboard panels placed on the ground. We captured 27 orders and 172 families of arthropods in crawl traps whereas 20 arthropod orders were observed under burlap bands and cardboard panels. The most abundant insects collected from crawl traps were aphids (Homoptera: Aphididae) and ants (Hymenoptera: Forrnicidae). The greatest biomass was in the <b>wood</b> <b>cockroaches</b> (Blattaria: Blattellidae), caterpillars (Lepidoptera) in the Family Noctuidae, and adult weevils (Coleoptera: Curculionidae). The most common group observed underneath cardboard panels was lsoptera (termites), and the most common taxon under burlap bands was <b>wood</b> <b>cockroaches.</b> Overall, arthropod abundance and biomass captured in crawl traps was similar in control and removal plots. In contrast, we observed more arthropods under burlap bands (mean & SE; 3, 021. 5 k 348. 6, P= 0. 03) and cardboard panels (3, 537. 25 k 432. 4, P= 0. 04) in plots with coarse woody debris compared with burlap bands (2325 + 171. 3) and cardboard panels (2439. 75 + 288. 9) in plots where coarse woody debris was removed. Regression analyses showed that abundance beneath cardboard panels {{was positively correlated with}} abundance beneath burlap bands demonstrating the link between abundance on the ground with that on trees. Our results demonstrate that short-term removal of coarse woody debris from pine forests reduced overall arthropod availability to bark-foraging birds...|$|R
