40|$|The {{company has}} taken some measurers to {{increase}} profit. It relies not only on increasing sale return, but also on controlling production cost expended by the company. It directly or indirectly suppresses the subsequent production cost to lead into the expected profit. A device to control production cost considers variance analysis. Variant analysis refers to the control of production cost by comparing the budgeted cost and realized cost in certain period. Considering this problem, the author takes the title of “Production Cost Control Analysis in the Shanghai Bean Company “Suling Mas Group” in Tulungagung. This research type concerns with case study. The objective of research will be to examine whether production cost expended by Tulungagung Shanghai Bean Company “Suling Mas Group” seems controlled or uncontrolled. Data analysis technique includes: first, raw material cost variance; second, direct labor cost variance; third, <b>plant</b> <b>overhead</b> cost; fourth, <b>plant</b> <b>overhead</b> cost tariff determination; and fifth, <b>plant</b> <b>overhead</b> cost variance. Results of research indicate that the control of raw material cost and direct labor cost has been succeed meaning that the advantaging variance from raw material cost and direct labor cost reaches 89, 850, 000 rupiahs and 37, 134, 000 rupiahs. The control of <b>plant</b> <b>overhead</b> cost appears failed because the variance produces disadvantage for 5, 710, 296. 70 rupiahs. Taking account these results, research implies that Tulungagung Shanghai Bean Company “Suling Mas Group” usually controls its production cost through variance analysis and corrects the deviance of company’s production cost. ...|$|R

50|$|For example, the {{manufacturing}} {{cost of a}} car (i.e., the costs of buying inputs, land tax rates for the car <b>plant,</b> <b>overhead</b> costs of running the plant and labor costs) reflects the private cost for the manufacturer (in some ways, normal profit {{can also be seen}} as a cost of production; see, e.g., Ison and Wall, 2007, p. 181). The polluted waters or polluted air also created as {{part of the process of}} producing the car is an external cost borne by those who are affected by the pollution or who value unpolluted air or water. Because the manufacturer does not pay for this external cost (the cost of emitting undesirable waste into the commons), and does not include this cost in the price of the car (a Kaldor-Hicks compensation), they are said to be external to the market pricing mechanism. The air pollution from driving the car is also an externality produced by the car user in the process of using his good.

In this study, the {{relationship}} between manufacturing plant areas and the <b>plant's</b> <b>overhead</b> energy was investigated and analyzed. The physical information about five industrial facilities, which included blueprints, plant layout, plant area, and machine configuration, was collected and in-plant measurements were made. The goal {{of this research is}} to measure, in actual manufacturing plants, the area distributions and their relationship to the basic machine area footprint (where the product manufacturing occurs) across a wide range of machine types. A six-categorization system (A to F) was developed for the different plant areas and can be used easily by other researchers. A linear relationship of decreasing total plant area (A to F) with decreasing machine size (A) was found. Thus, the allocated total plant area (TPA) is determined as A to F and can be estimated for a single machine operating at a manufacturing rate of x products or workpieces per hour. The nonprocess energy, then, is TPAx (30 W/m(2) or 3. 6 kJ/hm(2)) for manufacturing building nonprocess energy intensity. Then, total nonprocess energy for the manufacturing machine (kJ/h) divided by the production rate x products/h gives the nonprocess energy per product (kJ/product). This research has contributed further to the life cycle of products by estimating the nonprocess energy per product, which then can be added to the direct process manufacturing energy to give a total energy per product.

50|$|LST {{stands for}} Low Stress Training and is {{another form of}} supercropping, many times {{referred}} to as LST super-cropping. This technique involves bending and tying the plants branches to manipulate the plant into a more preferred growth shape. This method of training works very well for indoor growers who need to illuminate their <b>plants</b> using <b>overhead</b> lights. Since light intensity greatly diminishes with increased distance (Inverse-square law), LST'ing {{can be used to}} keep all growth tips (meristems) at the same distance from the light and can achieve optimal light exposure. LST can be used in conjunction with topping, since topping increases axial growth (side shoots). Topping is often done a few weeks before beginning LST'ing. The training works by changing the distribution of hormones—more specifically auxins—in the plant. LST'ing resembles the training of grape vines into their support lattices. Outdoor gardeners also employ training techniques to keep their plants from becoming too vertical.|$|R
30|$|A {{significant}} (P< 0.05) {{positive correlation}} between the epiphytic population size of Xap and disease severity in both the overhead irrigated field (r= 0.64) and the furrow irrigated field (r= 0.44) has been reported (Akhavan et al. 2009 a). The reason for the higher correlation coefficient with the overhead sprinkler irrigation system can {{be due to the}} effect of this type of irrigation on bacterial penetration to interior leaf spaces and subsequent development of disease. Similar results have been reported by other studies on the effect of windblown rain fall (Gilbertson and Maxwell 1992). Significant positive correlations between bacterial populations and disease severity have also been shown in other studies. For example, the epiphytic population of X. campestris pv. vesicatoria, the causal agent of tomato bacterial spot, was positively correlated with plant defoliation as a result of disease development (McGuire et al. 1991). Previously, Lindemann et al. (1984) also showed that the severity of brown spot of bean was correlated more consistently with epiphytic Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae population sizes than with disease incidence. A significant (P< 0.05) negative correlation between disease severity and seed yield per plant for both the furrow irrigated field (r=- 0.59) and the overhead sprinkler irrigated field (r=- 0.68) has also been reported (Akhavan et al. 2009 a). Furthermore, in both systems, there was a significant (P< 0.05) negative correlation between disease severity and total seed yield, but the coefficient correlation was higher under overhead sprinkler irrigation (r=- 0.83) compared to furrow irrigation (r=- 0.66). This difference is likely due to more severe disease in the field under overhead sprinkler irrigation system. Since the only difference between the two fields was the type of irrigation method, it can be interpreted that the overhead sprinkler system provided several factors that encouraged epiphytic populations to increase and to establish an endophytic population of Xap. Overhead irrigation can provide an ideal multiplication site, i.e. a thin layer or film of water on the bean leaf surface, while also disseminating the pathogen from diseased to healthy <b>plants.</b> <b>Overhead</b> sprinkler irrigation may also help the epiphytic population of Xap to establish an aggressive endophytic population by facilitating the entry of bacterial cells through leaf openings followed by symptom development.|$|R
40|$|Shamrock Plant (Oxalis regnellii) is an {{ornamental}} plant grown primarily for St. Patrick's Day. Interveinal chlorosis is a production problem {{and has been}} hypothesized {{to be caused by}} micronutrient deficiencies, either iron (Fe) or manganese (Mn) or virus. Several experiments were conducted testing these hypotheses. A virus screen was conducted and positive identification was found and plants were rouged. Oxalis plants were grown hydroponically on five NO 3 [...] N:NH 4 +-N ratio treatments. Increasing proportions of NO 3 [...] N increased total leaf, root, flower, and bottom shoot biomasses. Other hydroponic studies were conducted removing Fe and Mn from nutrient solutions to characterize the respective deficiencies. Iron deficiency, characteristic interveinal chlorosis on newly developed leaves was observed as early as three weeks after removing Fe. Plants grown without Mn did not exhibit interveinal chlorosis, but were slightly less green than control plants grown in complete nutrient solutions. Iron deficiency was also induced in a greenhouse media, using dolomitic lime. Again, typical interveinal chlorosis and reduced plant growth was observed after two weeks. Tissue analysis confirmed the chlorosis was due to reduced Fe as opposed to limited N or Mn concentrations. Our data suggest Fe influences interveinal chlorosis more than Mn. Micronutrient chelate foliar and media applications were assessed as corrective measures for foliar chlorosis. Media drenches of Fe-EDDHA were effective in regreening Fe deficient oxalis in 5 days. Foliar chelate applications were less effective. Organic acids, such as oxalic acid often assist plants in nutrient acquisition through root exudation. Oxalic acid levels of recently matured leaves increase in Fe deficient O. regnellii plants. Cultural practices such as temperature, irrigation, and fertilizer selection also influence plant growth and incidence of leaf chlorosis. Our research found that cooler temperatures (13 ˚ C) did not increase chlorosis and temperatures of at least 21 ˚ C produced more aesthetically pleasing and floriferous <b>plants.</b> <b>Overhead</b> irrigation, compared with subirrigation produced higher quality and larger O. regnellii.

40|$|Graduation date: 1963 The {{foundation}} {{upon which}} any cooperative rests is the economic {{need for it}} as a business enterprise. The existence of such a need cannot by itself {{provide the basis for}} a thriving cooperative. Not only mus. t the need exist, but the members or the promoters must through realistic and diligent investigations establish convincingly that: (1) the particular needs will be better met by cooperative action, (2) enough business and capital will be forthcoming for efficient and economic operations, (3) members as the chief source of business and risk capital, will obtain benefits not otherwise obtainable. This includes goods and services not available in their area or available but at unreasonable prices or inferior quality. The rapid evolution of Grange Oil Company int a financially stable business enterprise is proof of the need and the demand that existed for its services. Agricultural recovery during World War II and the subsequent demand for agricultural products in the postwar years, had a great impact on the growth and development of many cooperatives started during or soon after the great depression in the early 1930 's. High agricultural prices relative to non-farm prices, facilitated relatively large net margins and therefore greater capital accumulation. Cooperatives were able to build and to consolidate their net-worth position in readiness for the problems that beset agriculture in the 1950 's. In the decade 1952 to 1961, agriculture entered an era of price-cost squeeze. Improvements in farm technology and greater use of commercial fertilizers induced greater farm output. Consequently, prices received by farmers declined 20 percent while prices paid increased 5 percent. Narrowing net margins, caused by generally increasing operating expenses triggered sizeable sales promotion efforts. Increased sales, by virtue of their ability to keep <b>plant</b> <b>overhead</b> costs down, facilitated low per dollar expenses and enabled Grange Oil Company to make substantial savings for its members in the period 1950 to 1959. Sales alone cannot be expected to keep expenses down indefinitely. Other methods of holding down expenses have to be sought. There is a limit to the amount of inventory that present plant facilities can hold. A sales-expenses oriented plant size could prove uneconomic to run for many years. Present and future plant requirements must therefore take into account not only the sales-expenses relationship, but also current economic trends, future business expectations, size of the market and the possible degree of competition. The long run firm plans should provide for expansion when the need arises but the current plant capacity should be related to short run business expectations. The present Grange Oil Company's plant capacity exceeds the ability of the association to increase business volume in the next few years. This problem must be overcome before further expansion is contemplated. This study revealed four important points: (1) The environment in which a cooperative is launched has a great influence on its success; (2) Cooperatives need to broaden their equity capital base. More capital should be raised from members in good years for financing business and plant expansions; (3) Success hinges, among other things, on the ability of the cooperative {{to keep pace with the}} changes in the market or the industry which it serves; (4) Good effective and efficient management and employees are vital for successful operations...|$|R

Three lines of approach to the problem were followed: ecological considerations, an {{analysis of the}} controlled conditions of the city environment, and a classification of the various tree characteristics which might affect their selection. The most significant factors of environment in relation to the selection and use of trees are climate and soil. Of these, separate classifications have been made under the major headings of soil, water, temperature, light and atmosphere. An analysis of the apparent reactions of the various trees to these factors in the Pacific Northwest has been undertaken and suitable trees, from the list of 245 species and varieties, considered as possibilities for street use, have been placed in the classification. The controlled conditions of the city environment have been considered under the headings: types of streets, street widths, building setbacks, <b>planting</b> strips, <b>overhead</b> obstructions, underground services, and building heights. Trees have been selected to suit these city factors and classified under the above headings. The morphological and other characteristics of trees which might affect their selection for street use are: shape, size, root systems, rate of growth, longevity, resistance or susceptibility to diseases and pests, tolerance of city conditions and extremes of environment, flowering and fruiting habits, specific effects (especially seasonal effects), mass and texture.

40|$|The horticultural crops {{considered}} {{in this chapter}} are characterised {{by the fact that}} the plants are grown in a restricted volume, like pots, containers, plastic trays or compressed peat blocks. In the market these crops are recognized as potted plants, bedding plants and container grown nursery stock, mostly for ornamental purposes. Another group is the raising of young vegetable and cut flower plants, due to production holdings. Although extremely diverse, all these plants are grown as single units and this makes the water supply of the plants complicated. Trickle irrigation is generally unsuitable because it is laborious, due to rapid changing crops and plant densities and besides expensive because of the large number of units per area. Exceptions are the plants grown in large containers, like balcony and patio plants, some nursery stock and subtropical trees with a long growing period and a low <b>plant</b> density. <b>Overhead</b> sprinklers induce excessive losses of irrigation water and nutrients, since a considerable amount of the irrigated water falls alongside the pots or drips from the leaf canopy mostly also alongside the pots. Moreover, the water supplied is absorbed per individual plant or plant batch, which strongly enhances the variation in the water and nutrient status of such units. To avoid these problems, potted plants already have been grown for many years on concrete floors or on container benches with sub-irrigation. Nowadays, in all modern greenhouses this is the common growing system. In contrast with vegetable and cut flower nurseries, potted plant nurseries are not always specialised in one crop, but in different plant species. Even if they are specialised in one plant type, different plant stages are present at the same time, like with Kalanchoë and Chrysanthemum...|$|R

The result showed significant differences among genotypes, inoculation methods and growth stages for epiphytic population size and sam effects except genotypes for disease severity. The epiphytic population size was significantly higher on spray inoculated Khomein cultivar of bean during flowering (R 6). However, the relative humidity rates did not significantly affect population dynamics of epiphytic Xap and the disease severity. Two field experiments were also carried out {{to determine the effects}} of irrigation systems (furrow irrigation and overhead sprinkler irrigation), inoculation method, growth stage and their interactions on epiphytic population size of Xap and disease severity. The result showed that the epiphytic population size and disease severity were higher on spray inoculated <b>plants</b> irrigated with <b>overhead</b> sprinkler system during pods filling (R 8). In this study, a significant positive correlation was found between epiphytic population size of Xap and bean common bacterial blight severity...|$|R
