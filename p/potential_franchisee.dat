5000|$|Much like a {{real estate}} agent, the {{franchise}} [...] "recruitment consultant" [...] typically charges no upfront fees to [...] "buyers" [...] (franchisees); instead, he or she receives {{the bulk of his}} or her income from [...] "sellers" [...] (franchisers) and thus operates as a biased conduit between the two. It is important to understand that franchisors do not employ franchise consultants, but they do employ franchise brokers who call themselves franchise consultants. They establish relationships with these franchise consulting firms. The role of the franchise consultant is to build a win-win relationship between the franchisor and the <b>potential</b> <b>franchisee.</b> Quality franchise consulting firms that have a large footprint in the franchising industry and help screen out the franchises that don't meet the high standards that are set by franchise experts.|$|E
40|$|<b>Potential</b> <b>franchisees</b> {{encounter}} {{difficulties in}} gaining knowledge about a franchise before embarking {{on their first}} start-up venture. For this reason, {{it is necessary to}} research which information signals help <b>potential</b> <b>franchisees</b> choose the franchise chains with which they wish to enter into business. Working within the framework of signaling theory, this study's aim is to analyze the relationship between franchise choice and brand, price and participation in franchise fairs. The dynamic signaling model deployed to achieve the study's aim draws on panel data methodology. This methodology allows us to analyze franchise chains over the period in which their parent franchises were using signaling to reveal information about their quality to <b>potential</b> <b>franchisees.</b> The results show that franchise fairs and up-front entry fees influence franchisee's decisions. Therefore, it is concluded that <b>potential</b> <b>franchisees</b> prefer to garner information directly from franchise fairs, as opposed to heeding the other signals under study, and that when macroeconomic variables are exerting a strong influence on <b>potential</b> <b>franchisees,</b> up-front entry fees also constitute a signal that they consider. Finally, the managerial implications of the study are that franchise chains seeking franchisees should participate in franchise fairs to ensure that they are among the chosen franchises. Additionally, a franchisor should appropriately manage up-front entry fees as a signal, especially during periods of economic turmoil and recession...|$|R

40|$|International audiencePurpose– The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore {{independent}} small business owners’ perceptions of franchisees relationships with their franchisors, their fellow franchisees within the chain, their employees and their customers. Design/methodology/approach– The authors use a qualitative approach and, more specifically, 26 in-depth interviews conducted with independent small business owners from various business sectors. Findings– These independent small business owners perceive that franchisees have a dependency-based relationship with their franchisors; a competition-based relationship with their fellow franchisees; a rather complicated relationship with their employees; and a superficial relationship with their customers. Research limitations/implications– This study contributes to the franchising literature by presenting an outside-chain view of franchisees’ relationships with their franchisors, other franchisees, employees and customers. Practical implications– The findings may have practical implications for franchisors, enabling them to better understand the concerns of independent small business owners as <b>potential</b> <b>franchisee</b> candidates.

Namely the conditions for cooperation, currently offered by the operators of the franchise concepts in the gastronomy field. For clarification, the work is divided into several chapters depicting the main aspects of franchise business, to which should pay attention every <b>potential</b> <b>franchisee.</b> The introduction summarizes the main characteristics of the franchising, focusing on characteristics of the franchise business, franchising forms available on the Czech market and advantages and disadvantages of operating on both parts. As following, there are discussed financial and tax aspects of the franchise businesses in the Czech Republic and the available options for financing the enterprises. There is a chapter also devoted to possible pitfalls of franchising and a conflict {{from the perspective of the}} competition laws. The next section of this thesis focuses on analysis of the advantages of franchising in terms of gastronomy, putting an emphasis on the main factors affecting the franchisees, such as support for the franchisee, franchise fees, return on investment, length of the contracts and franchise expansion strategy of the concepts. The last chapter of the analytical part of the diploma thesis is devoted to practical example which purpose is to compare the profitability of the two possible options of entrance to a gastronomic franchise concept.

Moreover, as Rubin (1978) points out, as the franchisee invests {{a large portion of}} wealth in a single unit, the franchisee will ask for a bigger return than a normal investment as compensation for this diversifiable risk.

However, the literature has primarily taken the viewpoint of franchisors, but failed to explore the perspective of the <b>potential</b> <b>franchisees.</b> As China represents a significant growth opportunity for international hotel franchisors, this study examines the perspective of China's domestic hotel operators regarding franchising and analyzes a mix of factors that may affect such perspective. The study of 182 Chinese hotel general managers shows that China's hotel practitioners have considerable interest in franchising and are knowledgeable about the concept as it pertains to hotels. The findings indicate that the length of work experience and educational background of Chinese hotel operators may influence their franchising preferences.

It deals with push communication, pull communication and communication relayed by influencers. Moreover, a special focus is made on the use of the Web 2. 0. The case of Subway, one of the biggest franchising networks in the world, specialized in sandwiches, enables to illustrate these various communication means.

40|$|A {{shortage}} of suitable franchisee applicants {{has been identified}} by franchisors as a major hindrance to franchise sector growth in Australia. However, {{there has been little}} investigation into this issue within the organisational choice literature. This represents an important gap in the literature. In order to explore this issue it was first necessary to determine the expectations of franchisors regarding suitable franchisee prospects. Hence, this research explores desirable franchisee attributes and the factors that influence franchisee recruitment, together with suggestions on how franchisors may improve promotion of themselves to <b>potential</b> <b>franchisees.</b> A convenience sample of 12 franchisors was selected for participation. Respondents were interviewed about their current recruitment practices and the qualities they sought in franchisees.

This research examines the websites of a sample of 202 Australian franchisors to determine their function as a communication and marketing tool within the franchise network. The aim is to document the web activities undertaken by Australian franchisors to provide an exploratory and descriptive snapshot that can be used as a platform for theoretical efforts The analysis reveals that adoption of internet technologies is still in its infancy in Australian franchise systems with the major uses of franchisor websites being providing information to consumers and as a means of attracting <b>potential</b> <b>franchisees.</b> There is evidence that franchise organisations are moving towards network behaviour through the internet.
