50|$|A photoswitch, or <b>photo-electric</b> <b>switch,</b> is {{a sensor}} that detects the {{presence}} in or change of light. A popular example {{is that of}} azobenzene. Photoswitches are one type of molecular machines, a class of molecules that can be switched between at least two distinct thermodinamically stable forms by the application of an external stimulus. Development of such devices is crucial {{in the framework of}} the field of nanotechnology: nowadays photoswitches are used in a variety of places from scientific applications to residential light timers.|$|E
40|$|A {{metallic}} {{surface is}} realized on stoichiometric and insulating (100) SrTiO_ 3 by Ar^+ - ion irradiation. The sheet carrier density and Hall mobility of the layer are ∼ 4. 0 × 10 ^ 14 /cm^ 2 and ∼ 2 × 10 ^ 3 cm^ 2 /Vs respectively at 15 K for the irradiation dose of ∼ 4. 2 × 10 ^ 18 ions/cm^ 2. These samples display ultraviolet light sensitive photoconductivity (PC) which is enhanced abruptly below the temperature (≈ 100 K) where SrTiO_ 3 crystal undergoes an antiferrodistortive cubic-to-tetragonal (O_h^ 1 → D_ 4 h^ 18) structural phase transition. This behaviour of PC maps {{well with the}} temperature dependence of dielectric function and electric field induced conductivity. The longevity of the PC-state also shows a distinct change below ≈ 100 K. At T > 100 K its decay is thermally activated with energy barrier of ≈ 36 meV, whereas at T < 100 K it becomes independent of temperature. We have examined the effect of electrostatic gating on the lifetime of the PC state. One non-trivial result is the ambient temperature quenching of the photo-conducting state by the negative gate field. This observation opens avenues for designing a solid state <b>photo-electric</b> <b>switch.</b> The origin and lifetime of the PC-state are understood {{in the light of}} field effect induced band bending, defect dynamics and thermal relaxation processes...|$|E
40|$|I have proposed, and Mott {{and others}} elaborated, {{a model of}} {{amorphous}} semiconductors {{in which there is}} a fairly high density of localized centers near EF which have effectively negative U and can hence accommodate zero or two electrons, in conjunction with a mobility gap which is of order |U|. Two new aspects of these centers will be mentioned here : (1) Varma and Pandey (private communication) have proposed that such centers form at metal-insulator contacts and there may be direct experimental evidence for them. They could be responsible for the wellknown Fermi level pinning effect ascribed by Bardeen to surface states (2). Several arguments suggest that the one-electron gap itself will be a function of the pair state occupation. If so, and the relaxation rates of these states are very slow and cover a broad range as expected, they may be seen to lead to : (1) l/f resistance noise; (2) Long-period <b>photo-electric</b> phenomena; (3) <b>Switching...</b>|$|R
40|$|The energy {{consumption}} in office buildings can considerably be cut, if daylight {{is used as}} task lighting. A conservative estimate - starting from existing knowledge and calculation methods - gives a potential saving of 460 GWh a year or 46 % of the electricity costs for artificial lighting in Dutch office buildings, equivalent to 116 million Neth Fl/year or 51 million ECU/year. These substantial amounts justify the implementation of task lighting by daylight on a larger scale. To more accurately estimate the possible energy conservation by daylight, the designer lacks information on indoor daylight availability {{in the course of}} the year. The current way of tuning a daylight-controlled artificial lighting installation is too cumbersome and the human appraisal of these installations is still very low. because a daylight-factor-related control algorithm inherently has a very poor accuracy. The problem of comfortable <b>photo-electric</b> control of <b>switched</b> or dimmed artificial lighting upplementing the daylight illumination at the work'Place and correctly estimate the energy effectiveness of it, will require new research efforts to find a more accurate. prediction of the indoor daylight illumination level at points of the working area. The research objectives are: (i) for the designer: a frequency distribution of the indoor illuminance by daylight at various points, specified according to latitude, prevailing climate, part of the year, part of the day, and the geometry of the room and the window; (ii) for the artificial lighting engineer: an accurate conversion from the daylight environment outside to a control signal for the artificial lighting installation. The problem has to be tackled in a phenomenological way: the momentary indoor daylight illumination has to be related to the stochastical varying sky luminance patterns (in the direction of view from the window) by a function with a few measurable parameters. To this end it is necessary to measure and analyze the sky luminance patterns and the simultaneous indoor illuminances. In the running daylight research project of Eindhoven University an advanced sky luminance measuring instrument has been built...|$|R
