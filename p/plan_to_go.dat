25|$|In 1942 many Japanese from British Columbia were {{forcibly}} sent to internment {{camps in}} southern Alberta, which already had Japanese communities at Raymond and Hardieville. At first limited to working in sugar beet fields, the newly arrived Japanese had severe housing, school, and water problems. In {{the following years}} some of the Japanese were permitted to work in canning factories, sawmills, and other businesses. There was constant controversy in the press about the role and freedom of the local Japanese. Farm production increased markedly, {{and after the war}} few of the Japanese took advantage of the repatriation <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to Japan. The Japanese in Alberta today are well assimilated, but little of Japanese heritage remains.|$|E

500|$|As the tornadoes {{approached}} the Oklahoma City metro, thousands of residents {{decided to leave}} the area for safety, possibly due to the still fresh memories of the devastation caused by the EF5 tornado that struck Moore on May20. Already congested with rush hour traffic, Interstates 35, 40, 44 and 240, became [...] "parking lots" [...] as the storms neared. Residents reported the highways to be a scene of chaos, [...] "people were going southbound in the northbound lanes. Everybody was running for their lives." [...] It has been suggested that the evacuation was partially caused by a controversial call to action on-air by KFOR-TV chief meteorologist Mike Morgan, who suggested on-air during coverage of the storm – as the tornado was projected to track into Oklahoma City – that residents without underground storm shelters or safe rooms get into their cars and evacuate south of the track. This advice was contrary to the recommended <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to an interior room, bathtub or closet with no windows if no underground shelter is available, such as a basement. These locations are typically much safer than an automobile in tornadic winds. Dr. Jeff Masters of Weather Underground stated that had the tornado tracked directly over one of the congested highways, the death toll could have easily exceeded 500.|$|E
