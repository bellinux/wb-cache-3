50|$|Although Democrat/Populist Bryan {{had carried}} Utah in its debut presidential {{election}} by a five-to-one margin, the Republican <b>Party</b> - <b>ditching</b> ancestral hostility to the state’s dominant Mormon religion - was soon {{able to take}} control of the state, despite a threat from the anti-Mormon “American Party” in urban areas with sizeable non-Mormon (“Gentile”) populations. In its third election of 1904, the Beehive State had given a virtual two-to-one majority for Theodore Roosevelt against New York Democrat Alton B. Parker, who carried only Dixie’s Washington County.|$|R

5000|$|In a 1999 article, the news-magazine The Economist stated: Mr Blair will doubtless do {{his duty}} and lavish praise on Labour's glorious past. But, in truth, Mr Blair has always {{displayed}} a marked ambivalence towards Labour history. His greatest achievement in opposition {{was to get}} the <b>party</b> to <b>ditch</b> its historic commitment to nationalisation, and to water down its traditional links with the unions. At times he has even hinted that the very foundation of the Labour Party was a mistake, since it divided [...] "progressive" [...] politics and led to a century dominated by the Conservatives. Mr Blair knows that all this makes many of his party faithful deeply uneasy.|$|R

60|$|As {{the main}} body of Americans did not advance beyond the third {{parallel}} and contented themselves with supporting the <b>parties</b> in the <b>ditch</b> with their fire, the commander of the fort resolved to inflict a heavy blow. Two parties, each 30 strong, under the command of Captains Campbell and French, issued from the sally-port in the rear, entered the ditch, and, taking opposite directions, charged the Americans who had made the lodgment with such impetuosity that they drove everything before them until they met. The bayonet alone was used and the carnage was great--two-thirds of those who entered the trenches were either killed or wounded.|$|R
5000|$|The TPA {{was founded}} in 2004 by [...] "a group of [...] "libertarian" [...] Conservatives, {{frustrated}} by {{what they saw as}} the <b>party's</b> decision to <b>ditch</b> its traditional tax cutting message." [...] At the time the Conservative Party felt the need to match the Labour Party's spending plans, and the TPA aimed to represent, in the words of founder and Chief Executive Matthew Elliott, those [...] "who want to have lower taxes and lower spending". The attraction for donors, many associated with the Conservatives, is the ability of the TPA [...] "to [...] "fly kites" [...] for policy ideas that may go on to be adopted as Conservative policy." ...|$|R
25|$|Policies - Considered on {{the right}} of the party, Fraser {{supports}} far greater tax and spending powers for the Scottish Parliament in the form of further financial devolution. On 1 September, Fraser outlined his vision for 'New Unionism', with the intention of 'killing independence' and then to 'break the SNP'. He states that he rejects full fiscal autonomy for Scotland, calling it 'independence in disguise', but pledged his support for financial devolution, which he claims will make Parliament more accountable for the money it spends. On 4 September, Fraser made a high-profile announcement, that if elected leader, he would disband the party in favour of setting up a new centre-right party that would be fully autonomous of the UK Conservative Party, but would take the Conservative whip at Westminster. Fraser states that this would be carried out in order to 'de-toxify' the party in Scotland, stating that it would have a distinct Scottish identity, represent Scottish values, support devolution and decentralisation, and fight to maintain Scotland's place within the United Kingdom. He also would rename the <b>party</b> - <b>ditching</b> the name 'Conservative' – with possible new names cited as Scottish Reform Party, Scottish Unionists, The Scottish Progressives, the Progressive Conservatives, Scotland First, Scotland Forward, Caledonian Party or The Caledonians. The name 'Unionist' was downplayed, so as to avoid its connotations to Northern Ireland sectarianism, and a smaller Scottish Unionist Party also exists, rendering a change to this name impossible under electoral law.|$|R
5000|$|After Growing Pains, he {{appeared}} in the film Milk and Fashion, in commercials for McDonald's [...] "Dollar Menunaires" [...] promotion shot as a parody of the VH1 series Best Week Ever, and as {{the star of the}} 1990 Hanukah episode of Shalom Sesame (an Israeli version of Sesame Street). He has also been spotted in Boys and Girls Guide To Getting Down. He appeared in a special celebrity team-up episode of Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?; he and his partner got through to the bonus round in the end (but failed to win the big prize). In the Family Guy episode [...] "Not All Dogs Go to Heaven", he appears and tries to convince the other characters to buy him a case of Sudafed, but an animated version of his TV dad Alan Thicke appears, with his neck bobbling rapidly. He tells his son [...] "Be-en! What have I told you about trading sexual favors for Sudafed?" [...] He can be seen in four movies in 2009: <b>Ditching</b> <b>Party,</b> Never Have I Ever, The Fish and Tar Beach.|$|R
5000|$|When the {{workshop}} program was ratified in the National Assembly, Blanc's chief rival Emile Thomas {{was put in}} control of the project. The National Assembly was not ready for this type of social program and treated {{the workshop}}s as a method of buying time until the assembly could gather enough support to stabilize themselves against another worker rebellion. Emile Thomas's deliberate failure in organizing the workshops into a success only seemed to anger the public more. The people had been promised a job and a working environment in which the workers were in charge, from these government funded programs. What they had received was hand outs and government funded work <b>parties</b> to dig <b>ditches</b> and hard manual labor for meager wages or paid to remain idle. When the workshops were closed the workers rebelled again but were put down by force by the National Guard. The National Assembly was also able to blame Blanc for the failure of the workshops. His ideas were questioned and he lost much of the respect which had given him influence with the public.|$|R
50|$|The 1987 Cheltenham Gold Cup, run on 19 March was the 60th {{running of}} Britain's most prestigious steeplechase. Arthur Stephenson {{was not at}} Cheltenham, preferring to attend the meeting at Hexham, where he had seven runners, and The Thinker {{was taken to the}} course by Stephenson's nephew Peter Cheeseborough. The twelve runner field was headed by the 5/4 {{favourite}} Forgive 'n' Forget who had won the race in 1985, whilst the other runners included Door Latch and Bolands Cross (second and third behind Desert Orchid in the King George VI Chase, Wayward Lad, Charter <b>Party,</b> Combs <b>Ditch,</b> Earls Brig and West Tip. The Thinker, ridden by Ridley Lamb started at odds of 13/2 after considerable late support from gamblers who felt he would be well-suited by the testing conditions. An hour before the race, snow fell heavily on the course rendering the conditions virtually unraceable and the runners for the Gold Cup, having {{made their way to the}} start, were recalled to the paddock. After a delay of well over an hour, during which the snow began to melt, the runners were recalled to the start and the race began. Lamb settled The Thinker towards the rear of the field in the early stages as Cybrandian led the field on the first circuit. Charter Party fell at the fifth whilst Earls Brig was pulled up early on the second circuit and Bolands Cross fell at the fifteenth. Four fences from the finish, Cybrandian led from Door Latch, but The Thinker had made steady progress into third ahead of Forgive 'n' Forge, Wayward Lad an Combs Ditch. The Thinker moved into second but made a bad jumping error at the third last and turned into the straight in third place behind Cybrandian and Wayward Lad. The Thinker maintained his position over the last two fences before tracking to the right on the run-in and producing a strong late run to overtake Cybrandian in the last hundred yards and win by one and a half lengths. Door Latch and West Tip finished well to take third and fourth ahead of Wayward Lad.|$|R
