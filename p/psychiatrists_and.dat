5|$|According to St Petersburg {{psychiatrist}} Vladimir Pshizov, {{with regard}} to punitive psychiatry, the nature of psychiatry is of such a sort that using psychiatrists against opponents of authorities is always tempting for the authorities, because it is seemingly possible not {{to take into account}} an opinion by the person who received a diagnosis. Therefore, the issue will always remain relevant. While we do not have government policy of using psychiatry for repression, <b>psychiatrists</b> <b>and</b> former psychiatric nomenklatura retained the same on-the-spot reflexes.|$|E
5|$|As of 2017, Kemper remains {{among the}} general {{population}} in prison and is considered a model prisoner. He {{is in charge of}} scheduling other inmates' appointments with <b>psychiatrists</b> <b>and</b> is an accomplished craftsman of ceramic cups. He is also a prolific reader of books on tape for the blind; a 1987 Los Angeles Times article stated that {{at the time he was}} the coordinator of the prison's program and had personally spent over 5,000 hours narrating books with several hundred completed recordings to his name.|$|E
5|$|As Emmanuil Gushansky states, today {{subjective}} {{position of}} a Russian patient toward a medical psychologist and psychiatrist is defensive in nature and prevents the attempt to understand the patient and help him assess his condition. Such a position is related to constant, subconscious fear of <b>psychiatrists</b> <b>and</b> psychiatry. This fear is caused by not only abuse of psychiatry, but also constant violence in the totalitarian and post-totalitarian society. The psychiatric violence and psychiatric arrogance as one of manifestations of such violence {{is related to the}} primary emphasis on symptomatology and biological causes of a disease, while ignoring psychological, existential, and psychodynamic factors. Gushainsky notices that the modern Russian psychiatry and the structure of providing mental health care are aimed not at protecting the patient's right to an own place in life, but at discrediting such a right, revealing symptoms and isolating the patient.|$|E

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the storm, extensive psychological effects were documented. Difficulty during clean-up and recovery lead to increased divorce rates and a spike in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The cases of PTSD primarily impacted children. A sampling of 378adolescents by the University of South Carolina's Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics indicated that 3% of males and 9% of females met the criteria for PTSD. Dozens of children in the area attempted suicide, while counselors reported that between 50 and 60children discussed killing themselves between December1992 and January1993. A panel of <b>psychiatrists</b> <b>and</b> psychologists at the University of Miami agreed that as many as 90% of residents in the worst impacted areas would experience at least a few symptoms of PTSD. Within six months, the circumstances related to {{the aftermath}} of Andrew led to at least five suicides and four homicides.|$|E
5|$|According to Russian {{psychiatrist}} Emmanuil Gushansky, psychiatry is {{the only}} medical specialty in which the doctor is given the right to violence {{for the benefit of}} the patient. The application of violence must be based on the mental health law, must be as much as possible transparent and monitored by representatives of the interests of persons who are in need of involuntary examination and treatment. While being hospitalized in a psychiatric hospital for urgent indications, the patient should be accompanied by his relatives, witnesses, or other persons authorized to control the actions of doctors and law-enforcement agencies. Otherwise, psychiatry becomes an obedient maid for administrative and governmental agencies and is deprived of its medical function. It is the police that must come to the aid of citizens and is responsible for their security. Only later, after the appropriate legal measures for social protection have been taken, the psychiatrist must respond to the queries of law enforcement and judicial authorities by solving the issues of involuntary hospitalization, sanity, etc. In Russia, all that goes by opposites. The psychiatrist is vested with punitive functions, is involved in involuntary hospitalization, the state machine hides behind his back, actually manipulating the doctor. The police are reluctant to investigate offences committed by the mentally ill. After receiving the information about their disease, the bodies of inquiry very often stop the investigation and do not bring it to the level of investigative actions. Thereby psychiatry becomes a cloak for the course of justice and, by doing so, serves as a source for the rightlessness and stigmatization of both <b>psychiatrists</b> <b>and</b> persons with mental disorders. The negative attitude to psychiatrists is thereby supported by the state machine and is accompanied by the aggression against the doctors, which increases during the periods of social unrest.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in {{the early}} 1940s, <b>psychiatrists</b> <b>and</b> {{surgeons}} experimented with different techniques of psychosurgery, mainly {{in order to reduce}} the risk of death, complications and severe personality damage associated with the operation and thus extend its use to depressed and neurotic patients.|$|E

25|$|Many {{hospitals}} {{have a separate}} area for evaluation of psychiatric problems. These are often staffed by <b>psychiatrists</b> <b>and</b> mental health nurses and social workers.

25|$|<b>Psychiatrists</b> <b>and</b> {{clinical}} {{psychologists are}} often asked {{to evaluate a}} patient's capacity for making life-and-death decisions {{at the end of}} life. Persons with a psychiatric condition such as delirium or clinical depression may lack capacity to make end-of-life decisions. For these persons, a request to refuse treatment may be taken {{in the context of their}} condition. Unless there is a clear advance directive to the contrary, persons lacking mental capacity are treated according to their best interests. This will involve an assessment involving people who know the person best to what decisions the person would have made had they not lost capacity. Persons with the mental capacity to make end-of-life decisions may refuse treatment with the understanding that it may shorten their life. <b>Psychiatrists</b> <b>and</b> psychologists may be involved to support decision making.|$|E

25|$|The {{survey found}} that {{a small number of}} clinics were still, in 1980, {{occasionally}} using unmodified ECT.

25|$|The Psychopathography of Adolf Hitler is an {{umbrella}} term for psychiatric (pathographic, psychobiographic) literature {{that deals with}} {{the hypothesis that the}} German Führer and Reichskanzler Adolf Hitler (1889–1945) suffered from mental illness.

25|$|The Maritime Child Development Center, a wood frame, modernist style {{building}} {{operated by}} the Richmond School District, incorporated progressive educational programming, and was staffed with nutritionists, <b>psychiatrists</b> <b>and</b> certified teachers.
