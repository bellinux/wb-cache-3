5|$|Some lead {{compounds}} are colorful {{and are used}} widely in paints, and lead <b>paint</b> is a major route of lead exposure in children. A study conducted in 1998–2000 found that 38 million housing units in the US had lead-based <b>paint,</b> down from a 1990 estimate of 64 million. Deteriorating lead <b>paint</b> can produce dangerous lead levels in household dust and soil. Deteriorating lead <b>paint</b> and lead-containing household dust are the main causes of chronic lead poisoning. The lead breaks down into the dust and since children {{are more prone to}} crawling on the floor, it is easily ingested. Many young children display pica, eating things that are not food. Even a small amount of a lead-containing product such as a <b>paint</b> chip or a sip of glaze can contain tens or hundreds of milligrams of lead. Eating chips of lead <b>paint</b> presents a particular hazard to children, generally producing more severe poisoning than occurs from dust. Because removing lead <b>paint</b> from dwellings, e.g. by sanding or torching creates lead-containing dust and fumes, it is generally safer to seal the lead <b>paint</b> under new <b>paint</b> (excepting moveable windows and doors, which create <b>paint</b> dust when operated). Alternately, special precautions must be taken if the lead <b>paint</b> is to be removed. In oil painting it was once common for colours such as yellow or white to be made with lead carbonate. Lead white oil colour was the main white of oil painters until superseded by compounds containing zinc or titanium in the mid-20th century. It is speculated that the painter Caravaggio and possibly Francisco Goya and Vincent Van Gogh had lead poisoning due to overexposure or carelessness when handling this colour.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, the {{lighthouse}} underwent major repairs for its anniversary. As {{part of those}} renovations, the tower was painted with high quality oil <b>paint,</b> which became the main contributor to {{the deterioration of the}} tower in subsequent decades– thick waterproof layers of <b>paint</b> did not allow the limestone to dry. The mortar began to deteriorate rapidly.|$|E
5|$|In May 1843, Etty was one {{of eight}} artists chosen by Prince Albert to <b>paint</b> frescoes {{on the theme of}} Milton's Comus for a new {{pavilion}} being built in the grounds of Buckingham Palace. Etty was unhappy with his selection, as fresco was a medium with which he had no experience, but reluctantly did so, choosing to <b>paint</b> on the theme of Circe and the Sirens Three. The result was a disaster. Etty found himself unable to retouch or alter his existing work, as any freshly applied <b>paint</b> would flake away from the existing <b>paint</b> layer, and the lunette shape of the panel left Etty with a large empty space above the central figures. Etty's fresco was deemed unsalvageable, and although he offered to <b>paint</b> a replacement on the theme of Hesperus he was rejected, and William Dyce was commissioned to <b>paint</b> a replacement fresco. Etty was paid only a token £40 fee.|$|E

5|$|The cousins {{went back}} to the {{farmhouse}} to search for the source of the red <b>paint</b> on the silencer. In the kitchen they found marks in the red <b>paint</b> {{on the underside of the}} mantelpiece above the Aga cooker. DI Cook, a scenes-of-crime officer, took a <b>paint</b> sample from the mantelpiece on 14 August. This was found to contain the same 15 layers of <b>paint</b> and varnish that were in the <b>paint</b> flake found on the silencer. Casts were taken of the marks on the mantel, and the marks were deemed consistent with the silencer having come into contact several times with the mantelpiece. The implication was that the silencer had scratched the mantelpiece during a fight for the gun.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} was {{released}} on Vevo on May 21, 2013. The video was directed by Rich Lee. The video features Levine and Emily Ratajkowski as his love interest, {{as well as the}} members of the band, covered in grey <b>paint.</b> Levine initially paints himself out of a purely white background and then paints Ratajowski in front of him. The last scenes feature the band member's instruments spraying <b>paint</b> when played continually, a girl dancing seductively, and Levine and his love interest passionately embracing - all while covered in grey <b>paint.</b> In the very last scene, Levine reverses what he has done, removing all the <b>paint</b> from the scene, leaving no trace of them behind.|$|E

2500|$|Important {{painters}} of this period, roughly 480 to 425 BC, include the Providence <b>Painter,</b> Hermonax, and the Achilles <b>Painter,</b> all following {{the tradition of}} the Berlin <b>Painter.</b> The Phiale <b>Painter,</b> probably a pupil of the Achilles <b>Painter,</b> is also important. New workshop traditions also developed. Notable examples include the so-called [...] "mannerists", most famously among them the Pan <b>Painter.</b> Another tradition was begun by the Niobid <b>Painter</b> and continued by Polygnotos, the Kleophon <b>Painter,</b> and the Dinos <b>Painter.</b> The role of bowls decreased, although they were still produced in large numbers, e.g. by the workshop of the Penthesilea <b>Painter.</b>|$|R

Although black is still used for submarines, it was discontinued on destroyers after it had been determined that black ships remained more noticeable than gray ships on even the darkest nights.|$|E
50|$|Important Classical white-ground {{painters}} (5th century BC), {{in addition}} to the Achilleus <b>Painter</b> and Sabouroff <b>Painter,</b> include the Sappho <b>Painter,</b> Thanatos <b>Painter,</b> Bird <b>Painter,</b> Square <b>Painter,</b> Women <b>Painter,</b> Phiale <b>Painter,</b> as well as several representatives of Group R (Reed Group), including its eponymous Reed <b>Painter.</b> By the end of the century, some first attempts at shaded <b>painting</b> can be observed, influenced probably by contemporaneous panel <b>painting.</b> Notable in this regard is the Group of the Huge Lekythoi, specialised in decorating large grave vessels. During {{the second half of the}} 5th century, white-ground vase <b>painting</b> was used nearly exclusively for grave lekythoi. When that vase type went out of use around 400 BC, white-ground vase <b>painting</b> also ceased. Later, during the Hellenistic period, various types of white-ground pottery occur in several locations of the Greek World, sometimes <b>painted</b> monochrome, sometimes polychrome. They include Hâdra vases, Canosa Vases and vases of the Centuripe type. Lagynoi were often decorated in white-ground technique.|$|R

5|$|Etty {{had used}} {{experimental}} techniques to make The Sirens and Ulysses, using a strong glue as a <b>paint</b> stabiliser which caused the <b>paint</b> to dry hard and brittle, and to flake off once dry, a problem {{made worse by}} the painting's large size causing it to flex whenever it was moved. From the moment it was complete it began to deteriorate. After it was exhibited at the 1857 Art Treasures Exhibition it was considered in too poor a condition for public display, and it was placed in long-term storage in {{the archives of the}} Royal Manchester Institution and its successor, the Manchester Art Gallery.
