5|$|In {{the first}} years of the project, workers were {{regularly}} treated to <b>prime</b> <b>rib,</b> steak dinners, and other exotic fare due to a cost-plus contract between the food preparers and the subcontractors. In later years, these cost-plus contracts were replaced, and institutional cooking and box lunches became common, but the food on the project was prized by many workers. As soon as the haul road, later named the Dalton Highway, was built, the food and the overtime for some unions changed. The highway construction was charged to the federal and state governments and was supposed to be cost plus. There were no more steak nights one to two times a week and the Australian rock lobster tails disappeared. The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) LU 1547 was one union that had overtime on Sundays changed from double time to time-and-one-half upon completion of the haul road.|$|E

While Sam's back is turned, Bugs escapes the oven (commenting on how hot it is in there) and leaves. As soon as the hourglass hits zero for hasenpfeffer, Sam thinks he's safe.|$|R
50|$|In 1952, {{the first}} mail order {{operation}} was launched to serve distant customers. The meat was shipped in wax-lined cartons filled with dry ice. It {{was not until}} the early 1960s that insulated shipping containers made of polystyrene and vacuum packaging, became available. In 1961, Nebraska Governor Frank B. Morrison sent steaks from Table Supply to President John F. Kennedy and all of the governors in the United States. In that same year, Table Supply was honored {{to be involved in the}} Culinary Olympics held in Frankfurt, Germany, at which the United States team won the Grand Gold Prize with a dish that featured aged <b>prime</b> <b>ribs</b> of beef provided by Table Supply, thereby earning an international reputation for the Omaha company.|$|R

500|$|Muransky {{also set}} the all-time [...] "Beef Bowl" [...] record by {{consuming}} [...] of <b>prime</b> <b>rib</b> at Lawry's before the 1979 Rose Bowl. Muransky later recalled: [...] "Bubba Paris and I were two happy freshmen eating {{together at the}} Lawry's Beef Bowl event before the 1979 Rose Bowl Game. After we had enjoyed our fourth plate of <b>prime</b> <b>rib,</b> mashed potatoes, corn and Yorkshire pudding, Bubba asked what the record was, and they said 7 cuts. Bubba continued for 3 more cuts, and I continued for four, totally under the Bo Schembechler radar screen. When they delivered the 8th cut to me, the media started to gather around my table, Bo walked by {{and let me know}} what he was thinking without ever saying a word. Afterward, a Paris-Muransky night out ended with some pizza. The next morning in practice, Bo made an example of Bubba and me. We never ran so much in our lives as we did that day. We were in every play of scrimmage and then we ran sprints." [...] When the Wolverines returned to Pasadena for the 1981 Rose Bowl, [...] "Bo {{made it a point to}} come to the back of the plane and talk to me and Bubba Paris. He wanted to let us know that my record from a couple years earlier would not be in jeopardy because we were going to be sitting with him at the Lawry's Beef Bowl. He said he was going to limit each of us to two cuts of prime rib." [...] Schembechler had his own take on the story: [...] "I let 'em eat because they were freshmen. They weren't gonna play anyway." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{preparing}} {{it on his}} Logic recording software, Bilal recorded A Love Surreal in five months, {{which he}} said was the fastest he had recorded an album. Recording sessions for the album took place at Brooklyn Recording and Breeding Grounds Studio in Brooklyn, New York; Lalabelle Music and Lamont Caldwell's Bedroom in Clifton, New Jersey; Pine Studios in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and <b>Prime</b> <b>Rib</b> Productions and The Krusty Lab in Los Angeles, California. He recorded his vocals at a beach-side studio in Los Angeles. Bilal originally intended to record A Love Surreal as an extended play {{when he entered the}} studio, but, according to him, [...] "it was just so easy that the music started to flow ... by the fifth day we were like 'damn, we made a mistake and wrote five extra songs". He worked with most of the recording crew from Airtight's Revenge and produced 10 of the album's 14 songs. Bilal viewed that his role as a producer had progressed from his 2001 debut 1st Born Second to A Love Surreal, which he felt best conveyed his vision for the album's sound.|$|E
50|$|Sometime in the mid-1980s, after {{a failed}} attempt to expand into a second {{location}} {{under the name of}} Hatfield’s and McCoy’s, Jack and Delores realized they needed to make some changes in order to stand out in the competitive Kansas City barbecue market. They set about expanding their menu selections. To the chagrin of barbecue purists, they also began offering a higher level of comfort and service than most people were accustomed to experiencing at a barbecue restaurant. They added non-traditional barbecue menu items like hickory-grilled steaks, lamb <b>ribs,</b> Crown <b>Prime</b> beef short <b>ribs,</b> and an extensive wine and bar selection. Inspired by their travels along the Yugoslav coast, they also started offering fresh seafood grilled over a hickory wood fire.|$|R
50|$|In 1979, Jack Fiorella set out {{to expand}} his concept by opening a second {{restaurant}}. The new restaurant was known as Hatfield & McCoy's, and it was located in downtown Overland Park, Kansas. Faced with high inflation, high costs of financing, and a struggling economy, Hatfield & McCoy's was faced with trouble from the time it opened. Jack closed the restaurant just two years later and returned his focus completely on Smokehouse Barbeque in Martin City. Jack, {{along with his wife}} and children, decided to expand their menu selections, adding non-traditional barbecue menu items like hickory-grilled steaks, lamb <b>ribs,</b> Crown <b>Prime</b> Beef Short <b>Ribs,</b> and fresh, hickory-grilled seafood, along with an extensive wine and bar selection. They also began offering a higher level of comfort and service than most people were accustomed to at a barbecue restaurant.

In 1996, Jack Fiorella was named Restaurateur of the Year by the Greater Kansas City Restaurant Association.|$|R

2500|$|The Pine Tavern's menu {{is based}} on locally {{produced}} foods and ingredients.

[...] The chef uses Oregon hazelnuts for the crust on brie appetizers while pears, apples, and marionberries served in various dishes are from Pacific Northwest orchards and berry farms. [...] As a result, the Pine Tavern's menu helps to support local ranchers and farmers as well as serving dinner guests.|$|E
2500|$|To liven up the {{neighborhood}} and provide patrons with {{a place to go}} before and after performances, Mirvish bought and renovated a nearby warehouse building, which he turned into a restaurant. To cut costs, [...] "Ed's Warehouse" [...] at King Street West and Duncan Street served a set meal: <b>prime</b> <b>rib,</b> mashed potatoes and peas. Along the same street, Mirvish later opened Ed's Seafood, Ed's Folly, Ed's Chinese, Ed's Italian Restaurant and Old Ed's, which attracted local residents to the previously neglected King Street area and served 6,000 meals a night. As the neighbourhood became revitalized, many other restaurants opened nearby, often serving a wider range of foods than Ed's restaurants and achieving greater popularity; consequently, one by one, Ed's restaurants closed down. The last was Ed's Warehouse, which shut its doors in 2000.|$|E
