This <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>alignment</b> {{is referred to}} as chromosome congression. The reason for this defect is a subject of ongoing study.

Intriguingly, expression of a dominant-negative and catalytically inactive form of Aurora B disrupted microtuble attachment to the kinetochore and prevented the association of dynein and centromere protein E (CENP-E) with kinetochores.|$|E

50|$|Chromosome {{segregation}} {{occurs at}} two separate stages during meiosis called prophase I and prophase II (see meiosis diagram). In a diploid cell {{there are two}} sets of homologous chromosomes of different parental origin (e.g. a paternal and a maternal set). During the phase of meiosis labeled “interphase s” in the meiosis diagram there is a round of DNA replication, so {{that each of the}} chromosomes initially present is now composed of two copies called chromatids. These chromosomes (paired chromatids) then pair with the homologous chromosome (also paired chromatids) present in the same nucleus (see prophase I in the meiosis diagram). The <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>alignment</b> of paired homologous chromosomes is called synapsis (see Synapsis). During synapsis, genetic recombination usually occurs. Some of the recombination events occur by crossing over (involving physical exchange between two chromatids), but most recombination events involve information exchange but not physical exchange between two chromatids (see Synthesis-dependent strand annealing (SDSA)). Following recombination, chromosome segregation occurs as indicated by the stages metaphase I and anaphase I in the meiosis diagram.|$|E

50|$|Data-Driven Instructional Systems {{refers to}} a {{comprehensive}} system of structures that school leaders and teachers design in order to incorporate the data into their instructions. Building on organizational and school change literature, Richard Halverson, Jeffrey Grigg, Reid Prichett, and Chris Thomas developed a DDIS framework {{in an attempt to}} describe how relevant actors manage school-level internal accountability to external accountability. Specifically, high-stakes external accountability policies such as No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) was implemented to hold schools accountable for the reported standardized, summative assessment metrics. However, schools already had active internal accountability systems that place high emphasis on an ongoing cycle of instructional improvement based on the use of data including formative assessment results and behavioral information.

They are challenged to incorporate ICTs in their daily processess and strive to thus become more efficient and effective organizations. Yet, a lot of factors come into play when ICTs are introduced within local governments. Soon organizational dynamics are entangled with the new dynamics that stem from the newly introduced ICTs. In this paper we explore the dynamic process of aligning local governments with technology by using the 7 Smodel as a framework to analyze how seven different elements, both hard and soft, mutually affect each other and make out the local dynamics. We state that these elements influence how local governments deal with change, and in this respect, how they deal with technology. We stress the interrelations between the seven factors and the organizational dynamics {{as a result of}} the interplay between these factors to point out the complexity of the alignment process in local governments. Beter insights in the organizational factors that encircle the implementation of ICTs will lead to a more profound understanding of how the <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>alignment</b> comes into practice in local governments.

In Experiments 1 and 2, Dutch-English bilinguals code-switched in describing pictures while being cued with word orders that are either shared or not shared between Dutch and English. In Experiments 3 and 4, the same task was embedded in a confederate-scripted dialogue situation, and the confederate's use of word order and sentence position of switching was manipulated. We found that participants had a clear preference for using the shared word order when they switched languages, but also aligned their word order choices and code-switching patterns with the confederate.

We suggest a positive feedback relation in which structural alignment processes support the acquisition of language, and in turn, language — especially relational language — supports structural alignment and reasoning.

40|$|Compared to the {{critical}} success factors approach, Translation Theory, {{which is based on}} Callon/Latour's Actor-network Theory, presents an innovative and inspiring perspective of analyzing a particular management fashion: the so-called Integrated Approach to IT Management. We argue that the `translation' of this vision on IT management into the organizational discourse resembles more the <b>process</b> <b>of</b> `osmosis' than it does the <b>process</b> <b>of</b> `cloning'.

40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{the successes}} and failures of the transfer of technical innovations into the Dutch construction industry. When in the nineteen-seventies calcium silicate stone was introduced {{as the basis for}} a new construction technology, it rapidly became the material of choice for housing construction in The Netherlands. More recently the Dutch government has been promoting timber frame construction as a sustainable alternative to conventional construction methods. The adoption of this method by the industry, however, is slow. The paper argues that differences in technology transfer practices in both sectors account for the differences in their relative success. It views technology transfer as a result <b>of</b> <b>alignment</b> <b>processes</b> between technical configuration and social effects; or, in other words, between form and function <b>of</b> a technology. <b>Alignment,</b> then, is not a purely technical matter. It involves tension and interaction between insiders and outsiders of a network; between those who develop, those who build, those who regulate, and those who use a technology. By describing and analysing these <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> <b>alignment</b> in the timber frame and calcium silicate stone construction sectors in the Netherlands, the paper aims to understand to what extent the adoption of construction methods can be anticipated and how it might be advanced.
