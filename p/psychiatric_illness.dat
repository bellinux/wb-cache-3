5|$|Certain {{physical}} and mental illnesses and the pharmaceutical substances used to treat them can increase risk of obesity. Medical illnesses that increase obesity risk include several rare genetic syndromes (listed above) {{as well as some}} congenital or acquired conditions: hypothyroidism, Cushing's syndrome, growth hormone deficiency, and the eating disorders: binge eating disorder and night eating syndrome. However, obesity is not regarded as a psychiatric disorder, and therefore is not listed in the DSM-IVR as a <b>psychiatric</b> <b>illness.</b> The risk of overweight and obesity is higher in patients with psychiatric disorders than in persons without psychiatric disorders.|$|E
5|$|R. v. Kent Police Authority, {{ex parte}} Godden (1972) is an {{instance}} of a United Kingdom case in which an order of prohibition was issued to avert action {{that would not have}} complied with administrative law rules. In July 1970, Godden, a police chief inspector of Kent Police Authority, was examined by the police authority's chief medical officer, who took the view that he was suffering from a mental disorder and thus unfit for duty. Godden was therefore placed on sick leave, although his own specialist found {{that he did not have}} any <b>psychiatric</b> <b>illness.</b> Subsequently, in January 1971, the police authority informed him that it would be appointing the chief medical officer to assess if he was permanently disabled, for the purpose of determining if he should be compulsorily retired. The Court of Appeal of England and Wales found that since the medical officer had previously formed the opinion that Godden was mentally disordered, he could not be impartial when assessing if Godden was permanently disabled. Thus, an order of prohibition should be issued to prohibit him from carrying out this assessment.|$|E

40|$|Many <b>psychiatric</b> <b>illnesses</b> are {{associated}} with early mortality and with {{an increased risk of}} developing physical diseases that are more typically seen in the elderly. Moreover, certain <b>psychiatric</b> <b>illnesses</b> may be associated with accelerated cellular aging, evidenced by shortened leukocyte telomere length (LTL), which could underlie this association. Shortened LTL reflects a cell's mitotic history and cumulative exposure to inflammation and oxidation as well as the availability of telomerase, a telomere-lengthening enzyme. Critically short telomeres can cause cells to undergo senescence, apoptosis or genomic instability, and shorter LTL correlates with poorer health and predicts mortality. Emerging data suggest that LTL may be reduced in certain <b>psychiatric</b> <b>illnesses,</b> perhaps in proportion to exposure to the <b>psychiatric</b> <b>illnesses,</b> although conflicting data exist. Telomerase has been less well characterized in <b>psychiatric</b> <b>illnesses,</b> but a role in depression and in antidepressant and neurotrophic effects has been suggested by preclinical and clinical studies. In this article, studies on LTL and telomerase activity in <b>psychiatric</b> <b>illnesses</b> are critically reviewed, potential mediators are discussed, and future directions are suggested. A deeper understanding of cellular aging in <b>psychiatric</b> <b>illnesses</b> could lead to re-conceptualizing them as systemic illnesses with manifestations inside and outside the brain and could identify new treatment targets...|$|R

40|$|It is a {{myth that}} electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) {{produces}} greater side effects and worsens the neurological condition when used in neurologically ill patients.
