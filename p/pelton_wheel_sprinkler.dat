50|$|<b>Pelton</b> <b>wheels</b> are the {{preferred}} turbine for hydro-power, when the available water source has relatively high hydraulic head at low flow rates, where the <b>Pelton</b> <b>wheel</b> geometry is most suitable. <b>Pelton</b> <b>wheels</b> {{are made in}} all sizes. There exist multi-ton <b>Pelton</b> <b>wheels</b> mounted on vertical oil pad bearings in hydroelectric plants. The largest units can be over 400 megawatts. The smallest <b>Pelton</b> <b>wheels</b> {{are only a few}} inches across, and can be used to tap power from mountain streams having flows of a few gallons per minute. Some of these systems use household plumbing fixtures for water delivery. These small units are recommended for use with 30 m or more of head, in order to generate significant power levels. Depending on water flow and design, <b>Pelton</b> <b>wheels</b> operate best with heads from 15 - 1800 m, although there is no theoretical limit.|$|R
50|$|Toward {{the end of}} the 19th century, the {{invention}} of the <b>Pelton</b> <b>wheel</b> encouraged some mill owners to replace over- and undershot <b>wheels</b> with <b>Pelton</b> <b>wheel</b> turbines driven through penstocks.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Pelton</b> <b>wheel</b> turbine (better {{described}} as a radial turbine) translates the mechanical action of the <b>Pelton</b> <b>wheel</b> rotating in the liquid flow around an axis into a user-readable rate of flow (gpm, lpm, etc.). The <b>Pelton</b> <b>wheel</b> tends {{to have all the}} flow traveling around it with the inlet flow focused on the blades by a jet. The original <b>Pelton</b> <b>wheels</b> were used for the generation of power and consisted of a radial flow turbine with [...] "reaction cups" [...] which not only move with the force of the water on the face but return the flow in opposite direction using this change of fluid direction to further increase the efficiency of the turbine.|$|R
40|$|Design and {{fabricating}} New <b>Pelton</b> <b>Wheel</b> Blade is {{a conceptual}} understanding of turbine engineering and water flow engineering {{which is not}} provided in daily lectures room {{due to the fact}} that it is advance knowledge in this field. It is one of the industry that needs necessary knowledge in Malaysia, this is because in our country has many dam but they did not use Pelton concept turbine. Theoretically, it uses the same concept and field of engineering. As such, it is vital to attain this basic knowledge through this project. The design is taken from the existing <b>Pelton</b> <b>wheel</b> and it is vital because the new <b>Pelton</b> <b>wheel</b> needs to fit inside the existing hub. Material that is strong and considerably light is was used to fabricate the <b>Pelton</b> <b>wheel</b> blade using various methods. Evaluation of the test is based on the data obtained in which its range is identical between the existing and new <b>Pelton</b> <b>wheel</b> blade. The findings suggest that a lighter Pelton are an ideal selection, but we compensate the weight with a much more resistant and strong material. All of the work that been done in this project prove to be vital ta the performance of the <b>Pelton</b> <b>wheel</b> blade...|$|R

50|$|First, {{the runner}} is less {{expensive}} to make than a <b>Pelton</b> <b>wheel.</b> Second, it doesn't need an airtight housing like the Francis. Third, it has higher specific speed and can handle a greater flow than the same diameter <b>Pelton</b> <b>wheel,</b> leading to reduced generator and installation cost.|$|R
40|$|Students in the Mechanical Engineering Technology {{department}} {{have knowledge}} of a <b>Pelton</b> <b>Wheel</b> and how it works. This project {{is to create a}} housing unit for a five-inch diameter <b>Pelton</b> <b>Wheel.</b> A <b>Pelton</b> <b>Wheel</b> is used to generate electric power from the motion of water. This housing will be used as a lab exercise for the Fluid Mechanics class at CWU. This housing will have the capability to connect to a generator via a coupling. There will also be a prony brake dynamometer allowing students to see the relationship between torque and RPM Students will be able to calculate the power that is generated by using engineering principles. This project will showcase the benefits of a <b>Pelton</b> <b>Wheel</b> and give students the opportunity to see these benefits for themselves...|$|R

He brought it to Allan's foundry, where he and Allan tested it before manufacturing the first <b>Pelton</b> <b>wheel.</b> When the foundry could not keep up with <b>Pelton</b> <b>wheel</b> orders, production for the <b>Pelton</b> <b>wheel</b> was moved to San Francisco, though limited production of it continued at Allan's foundry. In 1892, Allan brought his son, Albert D. Allan, into the business as his partner and the younger Allan became the successor sole proprietor.|$|R

50|$|Lester Allan Pelton's {{competing}} <b>Pelton</b> <b>Wheel</b> {{was developed}} in 1878, based on a similar concept, but using two cups side-by-side and having the nozzle pointed directly between the cups. It {{turned out to be}} more efficient, the two types having been directly compared in a competition in 1883. The <b>Pelton</b> <b>Wheel</b> went on to become the industry standard. Recognizing the superior design, Knight developed an improved electrical governor that controlled the flow of water to the nozzle for any type of impulse water turbine.|$|R
