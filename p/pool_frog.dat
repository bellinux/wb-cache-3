5|$|Some {{species of}} anurans {{hybridize}} readily. For instance, the edible frog (Pelophylax esculentus) is a hybrid between the <b>pool</b> <b>frog</b> (P. lessonae) and the marsh frog (P. ridibundus). The fire-bellied toads Bombina bombina and B. variegata {{are similar in}} forming hybrids. These are less fertile than their parents, giving rise to a hybrid zone where the hybrids are prevalent.|$|E
25|$|Most {{amphibians}} of the Loire {{are found}} in the slow flow areas near the delta, especially in the floodplain, marshes and oxbows. They are dominated by the fire salamander (Salamandra salamandra), frogs and toads. The toads include Bufo bufo, Alytes obstetricans, Bombina variegata, Bufo calamita, Pelobates fuscus and Pelobates cultripes. The frogs are represented by the Parsley frog (Pelodites punctatus), European tree frog (Hyla arborea), Common Frog (Rana temporaria), Agile Frog (R. dalmatina), Edible Frog (R. esculenta), Perez's Frog (R. perezi), marsh frog (R. ridubunda) and <b>Pool</b> <b>Frog</b> (R. lessonae). Newts of the Loire include the Marbled Newt (Triturus marmoratus), Smooth Newt (T. vulgaris), Alpine Newt (T. alpestris) and Palmate Newt (T. helveticus).|$|E
25|$|Seventeen {{species are}} listed mainly {{because they are}} {{endangered}} on a global scale, such as the European beaver, even if the population in Norway is not seen as endangered. The number of threatened and near-threatened species equals to 3,682; it includes 418 fungi species, {{many of which are}} closely associated with the small remaining areas of old-growth forests, 36 bird species, and 16 species of mammals. In 2010, 2,398 species were listed as endangered or vulnerable; of these were 1250 listed as vulnerable (VU), 871 as endangered (EN), and 276 species as critically endangered (CR), among which were the grey wolf, the Arctic fox (healthy population on Svalbard) and the <b>pool</b> <b>frog.</b>|$|E

40|$|There {{are risks}} from disease in {{undertaking}} wild animal reintroduction programmes. Methods of disease risk analysis have been advocated {{to assess and}} mitigate these risks, and post-release health and disease surveillance {{can be used to}} assess the effectiveness of the disease risk analysis, but results for a reintroduction programme have not to date been recorded. We carried out a disease risk analysis for the reintroduction of <b>pool</b> <b>frogs</b> (Pelophylax lessonae) to England, using information gained from the literature and from diagnostic testing of Swedish <b>pool</b> <b>frogs</b> and native amphibians. Ranavirus and Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis were considered high-risk disease threats for <b>pool</b> <b>frogs</b> at the destination site. Quarantine was used to manage risks from disease due to these two agents at the reintroduction site: the quarantine barrier surrounded the reintroduced <b>pool</b> <b>frogs.</b> Post-release health surveillance was carried out through regular health examinations of amphibians in the field at the reintroduction site and collection and examination of dead amphibians. No significant health or disease problems were detected, but the detection rate of dead amphibians was very low. Methods to detect a higher proportion of dead reintroduced animals and closely related species are required to better assess the effects of reintroduction on health and disease...|$|R
50|$|For example, in {{the most}} {{widespread}} so called L-E system, edible frogs Pelophylax kl. esculentus (RE) produce gametes of the marsh frog P. ridibundus (R) and mate with coexisting <b>pool</b> <b>frogs</b> Pelophylax lessonae (L gametes) - see below in the middle.|$|R

5|$|A few {{animal species}} {{are the result}} of hybridization. The Lonicera fly is a natural hybrid. The American red wolf appears to be a hybrid of the gray wolf and the coyote, {{although}} its taxonomic status has been a subject of controversy. The European edible frog is a semi-permanent hybrid between <b>pool</b> <b>frogs</b> and marsh frogs; its population requires the continued presence of {{at least one of the}} parent species. Cave paintings indicate that the European bison is a natural hybrid of the aurochs and the steppe bison.|$|R
40|$|The mere {{presence}} of predators often decreases {{the growth rate}} of prey individuals, which devote energy and time to predator avoidance mechanisms. However, if time constraints are present, the prey individuals might be forced to neglect predators in order to grow faster. Amphibian larvae lower their activity when exposed to predators, which increases their survival probability but lowers their growth rate. I investigated how time constraints affect the growth strategies of <b>pool</b> <b>frogs</b> (Rana lessonae) in the presence and absence of caged (i. e., nonlethal) predators, and what the consequences are for their survival during the larval and the subsequent terrestrial life stage. In two outdoor experiments, I limited the available development time by delaying the hatching date, and by simulating pond drying. Tadpoles whose hatching date was experimentally delayed reduced their development and their activity less in the presence of predators than did control tadpoles. The survival consequences of caged predators was similar for early- and late-hatched tadpoles. Tadpoles exposed to falling water level increased their developmental rate compared to constant-water-level controls. In response to predators, however, tadpoles decreased activity and developmental rate, regardless of the water level treatment. Survival in treatments combining fast drying and caged predators was lower than in the other treatments. These results suggest that time constraints critically affect the role of predators in the life history of <b>pool</b> <b>frogs</b> and might change the relative importance of lethal and nonlethal predator effects on their population dynamics...|$|R
50|$|Mapleton Falls National Park {{marks the}} point {{just west of}} Mapleton where Pencil Creek cascades 120 metres over an escarpment. This small, day-use-only park, shelters many bird species, {{including}} the peregrine falcon, eastern whipbird and wompoo fruit-dove. From the carpark there is a short walk to Mapleton Falls lookout with wheelchair access to toilet and lookout. The panoramic view takes in the waterfall and Obi Obi Valley. From the open, grassy picnic area, the Wompoo circuit winds through eucalypts and rainfores where visitors may hear the fruit-dove’s booming calls, wallock-a-woo and book-a-roo. Near the causeway <b>pool</b> <b>frogs</b> may be heard and distinctive hexagonal volcanic rocks seen.|$|R

50|$|The <b>pool</b> <b>frog</b> has {{not always}} been {{recognised}} as a native British species. Part of {{the reason for this is}} that other similar species are known to have been introduced. However research has now shown that a native origin is most likely.|$|E

50|$|The Italian <b>pool</b> <b>frog</b> (Pelophylax bergeri) is {{a species}} of frog in the family Ranidae.

40|$|Density {{dependence}} is {{the major}} process keeping the sizes of natural populations within bounds. In organisms with complex life cycles, the stage at which density dependence occurs and whether it occurs in one or several life stages have important consequences for the dynamics of their populations. I manipulated density of <b>pool</b> <b>frogs</b> (Rana lessonae) during the aquatic larval and the terrestrial juvenile stages and examined the effect on growth and survival until 1 year of age. High larval density, but not high juvenile density, led to smaller size at this age. Both larval and juvenile density led to reduced growth during the early juvenile stage, but {{the effect of the}} larval density appeared stronger than the effect of juvenile density. No density dependence in survival could be found. My results suggest that density dependence in both the larval and the terrestrial juvenile stage may play important roles in the regulation and dynamics of amphibian populations...|$|R

40|$|A 410 base-pair {{region of}} the {{mitochondrial}} cytochrome b (cytb) gene, including the coding region for amino acids 44 - 179, was amplified and sequenced from a total of 53 <b>pool</b> <b>frogs</b> (Rana lessonae) sampled in nine European countries across the species' biogeographical range. Just two haplotypes were found, differing by single base pair (G-A transition) at a codon second position, corresponding to a conservative (serine-asparagine) change at amino acid 75. Only haplotype A (serine 75) {{was found in the}} samples from Italy, Hungary, Switzerland, Poland, Sweden, Norway and Britain (including museum specimens). Only haplotype B (asparagine 75) was found in France, and there were equal numbers of A and B haplotypes in a small sample from the Netherlands. Comparisons with other ranid cytb sequences together with an absence of stop codons indicated that the sequences were mitochondrial rather than nuclear copies. Using these north European cytb sequences and three more from other work based on individuals from Italy, Ukraine and Luxembourg, we discuss haplotype distribution with respect to the phylogeography of R. lessonae...|$|R
