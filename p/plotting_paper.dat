40|$|M. Tech. Striae are linear scars in the dermis which {{arise from}} rapid {{stretching}} {{of the skin}} over weakened connective tissue (de Angelis & Adatto, 2010). Striae occur when collagen production cannot keep pace with a sudden growth of the underlying tissues. Striae have no medical consequences but are frequently distressing to those afflicted. These disfiguring marks are usually caused by excessive stretching of the skin that may occur with pregnancy, adolescent growth spurts, obesity and weightlifting (Kang & Arbor, 1998). Striae usually appear on the abdomen, thighs, buttocks, breasts and extremities. Patients’ quality of life can be enhanced with the effective management of these unsightly marks. Modalities of treatments that exist {{for the treatment of}} striae have been advocated with varying success and side effects (Manuskiatti et al., 2010). The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the efficacy of the topical application of a homoeopathic preparation Thiosinaminum 1 X on the appearance of striae. The research was a double-blind placebo controlled study which took place at the Homoeopathy Health Centre which is located at the University of Johannesburg(Doornfontein campus). Forty female participants aged between eighteen and thirty-five were randomly selected to take place in the study. The study was conducted over a period of twelve weeks. On recruitment, the participants were required to read and sign the information sheet (Appendix A) and consent form (Appendix B) assisted by the researcher. Participants were asked to complete a questionnaire (Appendix C) to determine contributing factors e. g. duration of the stretch marks, the cause of the stretch marks and any disease that may contribute to the formation of stretch marks. A pertinent case and vital signs were taken at the initial consultation to eliminate any pathologies. All potential participants were required to present with stretch marks on the thighs or buttocks present for at least 6 months prior to the study. The stretch marks needed to have had a minimum length of 50 mm and a maximum length of a 100 mm. The researcher was responsible for choosing the designated area that was treated. The most distinct striae were selected by the researcher according to criteria for treatment. The researcher took photographs of the treatment areas at the commencement of the study and this was repeated at the end of the study (Appendix I). The length of the most prominent stretch mark (according to criteria) below was also measured on the commencement of the study. To physically iv measure the most prominent stretch mark a string and a ruler was utilized. The same ruler and ball of string was used each time to ensure validity of the results. A new piece of string was cut and tied in a knot at the tip and placed on the stretch mark itself to mould to its shape and thereafter it was placed on a ruler to determine the measurements in millimeters. To ensure that the same stretch mark was measured every time, the researcher measured out the distance between the stretch mark and a defined anatomical point for all the participants. The stretch mark was traced using <b>plotting</b> <b>paper.</b> The participants were required to apply the cream twice daily for the duration of the study. Participants were able to rate their satisfaction on a monthly basis by completing a questionnaire. The results of the study indicated that there was no improvement in the length of striae however there was more improvement in satisfaction ratings throughout the study from the experimental group...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{two types}} of information from the Carcinogenic Potency Database (CPDB) : (a) the sixth chronological plot of analyses of long-term carcinogenesis bioassays, and (b) an index to chemicals in all six plots, including a summary compendium of positivity and potency for each chemical (Appendix 14). The five earlier plots of the CPDB have appeared in this journal, beginning in 1984 (1 - 5). Including the <b>plot</b> in this <b>paper,</b> the CPDB reports results of 5002 experiments on 1230 chemicals. This paper includes bioassay results published in the general literature between January 1989 and December 1990, and in Technical Reports of the National Toxicology Program between January 1990 and June 1993. Analyses are included on 17 chemicals tested in nonhuman primates by the Laboratory of Chemical Pharmacology, National Cancer Institute. This plot presents results of 531 long-term, chronic experiments of 182 test compounds and includes the same information about each experiment in the same plot format as the earlier papers: the species and strain of test animal, the route and duration of compound administration, dose level {{and other aspects of}} experimental protocol, histopathology and tumor incidence, TD 50 (carcinogenic potency) and its statistical significance, dose response, author's opinion about carcinogenicity, and literature citation. We refer the reader to the 1984 publications (1, 6, 7) for a detailed guide to the plot of the database, a complete description of the numerical index of carcinogenic potency, and a discussion of the sources of data, the rationale for the inclusion of particular experiments and particular target sites, and the conventions adopted in summarizing the literature. The six plots of the CPDB are to be used together since results of individual experiments that were published earlier are not repeated. Appendix 14 is designed to facilitate access to results on all chemicals. References to the published papers that are the source of experimental data are reported in each of the published plots. For readers using the CPDB extensively, a combined plot is available of all results from the six separate <b>plot</b> <b>papers,</b> ordered alphabetically by chemical; the combined plot in printed form or on computer tape or diskette is available from the first author.
