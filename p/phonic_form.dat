We present a preliminary analysis of a written corpus made up of 1 st year undergraduate students written examinations in French L 2. The nature of the dictation task, the characteristics of French verbal morphology as well as several discrepencies between both languages orthographic systems – major transparency against opacity – lead us to choose a theoretical framework that focuses on the <b>phonic</b> <b>form.</b> The concept of "supplétion" (Bonami and al., 2003), that allows to redefine regularity in terms of suppletive inflection and stem allomorphy, enables us to distinguish between three major categories of verbs based on their phonomorphological behavior. A quantitative analysis of spelling error distribution shows that the most irregular verbs generate less spelling errors in contrast to verbs presenting stem allomorphy in their inflection paradigm. As for the regular verbs, they generate 62 % of spelling errors on inflection morpheme. Qualitative analysis of some verbal contexts show systematic spelling errors at various linguistic levels. We suggest that certain verbal contexts might hinder segmentation and alter verbal form recognition...|$|E
40|$|This present {{research}} aims at identifying register {{used in the}} conversations among petroleum engineers by examining the linguistic feature which is viewed from the aspect of the field, the tenor and the mode of discourse of the Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL) approach. Findings show that {{in the field of}} discourse, all terms of register found in the experiential domain analysis function as technical terms, of which the two major forms of nouns and verbs (i. e., single-word and compound/phrasal word forms) are the most frequent categories identified among other kinds of technical terms. The goal orientation appears to have both short and long term while the social activity results in exchanges among participants. In the tenor of discourse, the agentive role is said to be equal and the social role is considered as non-hierarchic. The social distance within the interaction is said to be minimal which is excessively characterized by the use of informal form of expressions. In the mode of discourse, the language role exists equally of both constitutive and ancillary identified by the use of present simple tense and non-present tenses, that is, future simple, past simple and present perfect. The channel is in <b>phonic</b> <b>form.</b> The medium is in spoken with visual contact as it is largely characterized by the use of endophoric reference as well as pronouns. </p...|$|E
40|$|Este estudo tem como objetivos {{investigar}} a sensibilidade à forma fônica dos determinantes e analisar se essa sensibilidade ajudaria bebês de 13 meses, adquirindo o português, a segmentar o sintagma determinante (DP) em unidades menores (determinante + nome). A perspectiva teórica adotada busca conciliar um tratamento psicolinguístico para aquisição de língua com uma teoria linguística, através da integração entre o modelo de Bootstrapping Fonológico (MORGAN & DEMUTH, 1996; CHRISTOPHE ET AL., 1997) e o Programa Minimalista, no que se refere, sobretudo, à sua concepção de Faculdade da Linguagem (HAUSER, CHOMSKY & FITCH, 2002), entendida sob duas perspectivas: no sentido estrito (FLN – Faculty of Language in {{the narrow}} sense) e no sentido amplo (FLB – Faculty of Language in the broad sense). Essa conciliação permite-nos explicar como a criança chega à sintaxe da sua língua a partir de pistas distribucionais e prosódicas disponibilizadas na interface fônica. Estudos conduzidos em diversas línguas, inclusive em português (Name, 2002), sugerem que, por volta dos 10 meses de idade, as crianças já seriam capazes de reconhecer os itens funcionais no fluxo da fala, a partir de suas características acústicas e distribucionais, utilizando-os como pistas para o acesso lexical e sintático. As hipóteses assumidas são de que (i) aos 13 meses, a criança é sensível à forma fônica dos determinantes, distinguindo, assim, os determinantes reais dos pseudodeterminantes, sendo capazes, (ii) de segmentar o DP formado por um determinante real + pseudonome. Nossos resultados sugerem que aos 13 meses, o bebê é sensível à forma fônica dos determinantes da língua, reagindo diferentemente quando apresentados aos determinantes (o / um/ este / aquele) ou aos pseudodeterminantes (ône / ór / ugi / ófupi). Além disso, sugerem também que as crianças foram capazes de segmentar o DP em unidades menores, já que reagiram diferentemente aos pseudonomes familiarizados quando antecedidos por determinante real ou pseudodeterminante. This study aims at investigating the sensitivity to phonetic form of determiners and analyzing whether this sensitivity would help 13 -month-old Brazilian babies to segment the Determiner Phrase (DP) into smaller unities (determiner + noun). The theoretical approach adopted seeks at conciliating a psycholinguistic treatment for the language acquisition with a linguistic theory, through the integration between Phonological Bootstrapping (MORGAN and DEMUTH, 1996; CHRISTOPHE et al., 1997) and the Minimalist Program, in relation, especially, to its conception of Language Faculty (HAUSER, CHOMSKY & FITCH, 2002), seen through two perspectives: in its narrow sense (FLN) and in its broad sense (FLB). This conciliation allows us {{to explain how the}} child reaches the language syntax from distributional and prosodic cues available at the phonic interface. Studies conducted in different languages, including Brazilian Portuguese (Name, 2002) suggest that, around the age of 10 months, children would already be able of recognizing function words in the speech stream, from their acoustic and distributional characteristics, using them as cues for syntactic and lexical access. The hypothesis are that (i) at 13 months, the child is sensitive to the <b>phonic</b> <b>form</b> of determiners, distinguishing the real determiners from the nonsense determiners, being able of (ii) segment the DP consisting of a real determiner + a nonsense noun. Our results suggest that, at 13 month-old, babies are sensible to the <b>phonic</b> <b>form</b> of their language determiners, reacting differently when they are presented either to the determiners (o / um / este/ aquele) or the nonsense determiners (ône / ór / ugi / ófupi). It also suggests that the children were able of segmenting the DP into smaller unities, since they reacted differently to the familiarized nonsense nouns when they were preceded by a real determiner or a nonsense determiner...|$|E

40|$|The {{intermediate}} leaf-nosed bat (Hipposideros larvatus) is {{a medium-sized}} bat {{distributed throughout the}} Indo-Malay region. In north-east India, bats identified as H. larvatus captured at a single cave emitted echolocation calls with a bimodal distribution of peak frequencies, around either 85 kHz or 98 kHz. Individuals echolocating at 85 kHz had larger ears and longer forearms than those echolocating at 98 kHz, although no differences were detected in either wing morphology or diet, suggesting limited resource partitioning. A comparison of mitochondrial control region haplotypes of the two phonic types with individuals sampled from across the Indo-Malay range supports the hypothesis that, in India, two cryptic species are present. The Indian 98 -kHz <b>phonic</b> bats <b>formed</b> a monophyletic clade with bats from all other regional populations sampled, {{to the exclusion of}} the Indian 85 -kHz bats. In India, the two forms showed 12 – 13 % sequence divergence and we propose that the name Hipposideros khasiana for bats of the 85 -kHz phonic type. Bats of the 98 -kHz <b>phonic</b> type <b>formed</b> a monophyletic group with bats from Myanmar, and corresponded to Hipposideros grandis, which is suggested to be a species distinct from Hipposideros larvatus. Differences in echolocation call frequency among populations did not reflect phylogenetic relationships, indicating that call frequency is a poor indicator of evolutionary history. Instead, divergence in call frequency probably occurs in allopatry, possibly augmented by character displacement on secondary contact to facilitate intraspecific communication...|$|R
40|$|In many {{elementary}} developmental reading programs, {{the areas}} of word attack and comprehension traditionally receive major attention with respect to reading skills instruction. In some other cases there is much emphasis with respect to <b>phonics</b> and other <b>forms</b> of decoding with less priority given to comprehension.

50|$|After {{launching}} {{his musical}} career in 1993 with singing effort on Vais Sex & Religion and subsequent tour, Townsend released the album Heavy as a Really Heavy Thing under the pseudonym Strapping Young Lad, in 1995. His debut solo release was 1996s Punky Brüster - Cooked on <b>Phonics.</b> Townsend <b>formed</b> a band under the Strapping Young Lad name to perform his next album, the industrial metal album City, in 1997. Townsend started a project initially called Biomech, under the Ocean Machine moniker, to release his less metal-influenced music. It was ultimately released {{under his own}} name as 1997s Ocean Machine: Biomech. This was followed by his first charting album, the 1998 album Infinity, which appeared at number 29 in Japan. Strapping Young Lad went on hiatus at this time so that Townsend could focus on his solo music, which had a varying lineup of supporting musicians. His 2000 release Physicist reached number 80 in Japan, and {{was followed by the}} 2001 release Terria which charted in France and Japan.|$|R
5000|$|While rancor continues, much {{of whole}} language's {{emphasis}} on quality literature, cultural diversity, and reading in groups and to students is widely supported [...] by the educational community. The importance of motivation, long a {{central focus of}} whole language approaches, has gained more attention in the broader educational community {{in the last few}} years. Prominent critic of whole language Louisa Cook Moats has argued, however, that the foci on quality literature, diversity, reading groups, and motivation are not the sole property of whole language. [...] She, and others , contend these components of instruction are supported by educators of diverse educational perspectives. Moats contends that the properties essential to Whole Language, and those that render it ineffective and unfit for reading education are the principles that children learn to read from exposure to print, the hostility to drilling in <b>phonics</b> and other <b>forms</b> of direct instruction, and the tendency to endorse the use of context-clues and guess-work to decipher a word rather than phonemic decoding. In these and certain other tenets lie the essence and the error of Whole Language. Emphases on cultural diversity and quality literature is neither limited to Whole Language nor fundamental to it.|$|R
40|$|Extensive {{evidence}} supports {{the view that}} reading acquisition is dependent upon the mapping between spelling (orthography) and sound (phonics) (see Gleitman 2 ̆ 6 Rozin 1977 for a review). There exists one population for whom this spelling to sound correspondence is naturally dissociated, the congenitally deaf. Reading and writing are essential modes of communication for this group. Yet, few achieve better than a third grade reading level (Wrightston et al., 1963); a fact which is predictable on theoretical grounds. ^ Phonics without sound {{is an attempt to}} learn whether the deaf compensate for the lack of spelling-sound rules by creating an alternative route to phonics. Fingerspelling, a segment of the American Sign Language which provides a one to one mapping between handshape and alphabetic letter, may provide that alternative. ^ Twenty-six second generation deaf students were studied to investigate how they naturally approach the reading task, i. e., to investigate whether they do employ a manual 2 ̆ 2 phonics. 2 ̆ 2 Specifically, the research posed two questions: (1) Do the deaf transform (decode or recode) print into an alternate 2 ̆ 2 phonics 2 ̆ 2 mode? (2) Can the deaf transform print into an alternate phonics? The second question is a composite of two further issues: (a) Are the deaf students competent metalinguists? (Can they segment their language to the level of fingerspelled handshapes that will map directly onto alphabetic letters?); and (b) can the deaf actually perform the mapping from segmented handshapes onto letters? These two processes, segmentation and mapping jointly define the conditions for decoding print. ^ Results from seven studies of congenitally deaf students (age range 4 - 16 years; reading level range pre-primer - 6 th grade; with most of the readers congregated at the 3 rd grade reading level or below) fail to yield any evidence that they naturally decode print into a <b>phonics</b> based <b>form.</b> The students are overwhelmingly capable, however, of creating a manual 2 ̆ 2 phonics 2 ̆ 2 [...] of segmenting to handshape and of mapping handshapes onto letters. Further, inducement of the fingerspelled decoding does seem to benefit a majority of the readers. A detailed presentation of these results and possible explanations for why the deaf do not exercise their phonic capabilities are discussed at length in this thesis. ...|$|R
