Consistent and proactive precautionary measures, such as the rigorous use of antiretroviral medications, cesarean section, face masks, heavy-duty rubber gloves, clinically segregated disposable diapers, and avoidance of mouth contact will further reduce child-attendant transmission of HIV to as little as 1–2%.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Neuraminidase inhibitors (NI) {{and social}} {{distancing}} {{play a major}} role in plans to mitigate future influenza pandemics. Methods Using the freely available program InfluSim, the authors examine to what extent NI-treatment and prophylaxis promote the occurrence and transmission of a NI resistant strain. Results Under a basic reproduction number of R 0 = 2. 5, a NI resistant strain can only spread if its transmissibility (fitness) is at least 40 % of the fitness of the drug-sensitive strain. Although NI drug resistance may emerge in treated patients in such a late state of their disease that passing on the newly developed resistant viruses is unlikely, resistant strains quickly become highly prevalent in the population if their fitness is high. Antiviral prophylaxis further increases the pressure on the drug-sensitive strain and favors the spread of resistant infections. The authors show scenarios where <b>pre-exposure</b> antiviral <b>prophylaxis</b> even increases the number of influenza cases and deaths. Conclusion If the fitness of a NI resistant pandemic strain is high, any use of prophylaxis may increase the number of hospitalizations and deaths in the population. The use of neuraminidase inhibitors should be restricted to the treatment of cases whereas prophylaxis should be reduced to an absolute minimum in that case. </p...|$|R
40|$|International audienceTissue-culture {{vaccines}} like purified chick embryo cell vaccine (PCECV) {{have been}} shown to provide protection against classical rabies virus (RABV) via <b>pre-exposure</b> or post-exposure <b>prophylaxis.</b> A cross-neutralization study was conducted using a panel of 100 human sera, to determine, to what extent after vaccination with PCECV protection exists against non-classical bat lyssavirus strains like European bat lyssavirus (EBLV) type 1 and 2 and Australian bat lyssavirus (ABLV). Virus neutralizing antibody (VNA) concentrations against the rabies virus variants CVS- 11, ABLV, EBLV- 1 and EBLV- 2 were determined by using a modified rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test. For ABLV and EBLV- 2, the comparison to CVS- 11 revealed almost identical results (100 % adequate VNA concentrations >or= 0. 5 IU/mL; correlation coefficient r(2) = 0. 69 and 0. 77, respectively), while for EBLV- 1 more scattering was observed (97 % adequate VNA concentrations; r(2) = 0. 50). In conclusion, vaccination with PCECV produces adequate VNA concentrations against classical RABV as well as non-classical lyssavirus strains ABLV, EBLV- 1, and EBLV- 2...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} work of {{bioethics}} in the enactment of medically drugged bodies {{by focusing on the}} development of an oral <b>pre-exposure</b> chemo (drug) <b>prophylaxis</b> for preventing HIV, called PrEP. Our aim is to show how the operationalisation of bioethics to mediate drug development obscures a more complex and relational dynamic out of which emerge the qualities and, indeed, problematics of bodies incorporated into PrEP. Our analysis is drawn from a small body of literature from trial affected communities, advocacy groups, researchers and trial sponsors. In particular, we focus on bioethical questions about how best to protect the interests of participants in ‘offshore’ randomised clinical trials. We argue that the predominant bioethical frame insufficiently addresses the challenges posed by PrEP. By rendering PrEP a singular thing that differs across contexts, more fruitful alternative conceptions are obscured. Specifically, we argue that PrEP trials be conceived as ‘ontologically multiple’ - emerging out of divergent assemblages of heterogeneous entities, including material and cultural differences in and across context-specific bodies. On the basis of this alternative account of PrEP, we propose that the bioethical work of pharmaceutical development can become more inclusive...|$|R
40|$|International audienceUnlike {{any other}} human infection, {{encephalitis}} caused by dog rabies virus is always fatal. Rabies and other lyssaviruses {{have been found}} in unexpected places, and human disease, especially paralytic rabies, has gone unrecognized. Evidence is emerging that rabies-related bat lyssaviruses are enzootic across Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia, but none has been detected in the Americas. The epidemiology and origins of African lyssaviruses are discussed. Ideal rabies <b>prophylaxis</b> (<b>pre-exposure</b> immunization followed by post-exposure booster vaccination) has proved 100 % effective; hence all human deaths result from failure of prevention. Rabies vaccines of known quality are unaffordable for the majority in Africa. Although intradermal regimens requiring < 40 % of the usual vaccine dose are economical and are recommended by the World Health Organization, several problems have inhibited their use. A new, simplified, economical post-exposure vaccine regimen that uses an initial dose of intradermal injections at four sites overcomes many of the difficulties of the previous methods: it is at least as immunogenic as the standard intramuscular course of tissue-culture vaccine; is safer in inexperienced hands; requires fewer than two ampoules of vaccine and only three instead of five clinic visits. Recent data should increase the confidence of physicians to use the World Health Organization-accredited rabies vaccines more efficiently and at lower cost...|$|R
40|$|Animal control {{measures}} in Latin America have decreased {{the incidence of}} urban human rabies transmitted by dogs and cats; currently most cases of human rabies are transmitted by bats. In 2004 - 2005, rabies outbreaks in populations living in rural Brazil prompted widespread vaccination of exposed and at-risk populations. More than 3, 500 inhabitants of Augusto Correa (Pará State) received either post-exposure (PEP) or <b>pre-exposure</b> (PrEP) <b>prophylaxis.</b> This study evaluated the persistence of rabies virus-neutralizing antibodies (RVNA) annually for 4 years post-vaccination. The aim was to evaluate the impact of rabies PrEP and PEP in a population at risk living in a rural setting to help improve management of vampire bat exposure and provide additional data {{on the need for}} booster vaccination against rabies. This prospective study was conducted in 2007 through 2009 in a population previously vaccinated in 2005; study participants were followed-up annually. An RVNA titer > 0. 5 International Units (IU) /mL was chosen as the threshold of seroconversion. Participants with titers ≤ 0. 5 IU/mL or Equivalent Units (EU) /mL at enrollment or at subsequent annual visits received booster doses of purified Vero cell rabies vaccine (PVRV). Adherence of the participants from this Amazonian community to the study protocol was excellent, with 428 of the 509 (84 %) who attended the first interview in 2007 returning for the final visit in 2009. The long-term RVNA persistence was good, with 85 - 88. 0 % of the non-boosted participants evaluated at each yearly follow-up visit remaining seroconverted. Similar RVNA persistence profiles were observed in participants originally given PEP or PrEP in 2005, and the GMT of the study population remained > 1 IU/mL 4 years after vaccination. At the end of the study, 51 subjects (11. 9 % of the interviewed population) had received at least one dose of booster since their vaccination in 2005. This study and the events preceding it underscore the need for the health authorities in rabies enzootic countries to decide on the best strategies and timing for the introduction of routine rabies PrEP vaccination in affected areas...|$|R
