The DFFF is a grant {{given by the}} German Federal Commissioner for Culture and the Media. To receive the grant a producer has to fulfill different requirements including a cultural eligibility test. The fund offers 60 million euros a year to film producers and or co-producers and grants can amount to up to 20% of the approved German production costs. At least 25% the production costs must be spent in Germany, or only 20%, if the production costs are higher than 20 million euros.

Our findings show that intensified competition, membership of a multinational firm and public ownership have a negative effect. Also, <b>production</b> <b>incentives</b> are associated with lower monitoring, narrowness of job description and teamwork. The evidence obtained rejects the hypothesis of a negative association between incentive payment and several features associated with internal labour markets.

It was one of two programs formed to address the motives of the Kyoto Protocol along with the Renewable Energy Deployment Initiative (REDI), which focused on smaller scale production and renewable heat. During the life of these programs, their shortcomings began to surface. These shortcomings were the product of government officials reacting too hastily to newly evidenced environmental concerns resulting from the burning of fossil fuels for energy.|$|E
