5|$|Judy {{also pointed}} out the {{approach}} of hostile Japanese aircraft long before any of the human crew could hear them. This first occurred prior to the outbreak of war, when the aircraft would fly low over the Gnat with Judy barking at them until they had passed. On an outing to Jiujiang, Jefferey took Judy for a walk outside of the city but she ran ahead, <b>pulling</b> <b>him</b> with her. He realised as he looked back {{that she had been}} <b>pulling</b> <b>him</b> away from a Leopard. In November 1937, the Gnat met with the American river gunboat USS Panay. After the Panay held a party for the two ship's companies, the Gnat crew departed and only realised afterwards that Judy was not with them. They contacted the Panay via signal lamp, but they insisted that they had not seen her. The following morning, the crew heard from a Chinese trader that Judy was on board the Panay after all. In retaliation, a party boarded the American vessel and stole the ship's bell. Afterwards they contacted the Panay and offered them the bell back in return for Judy. She was returned within the hour.|$|E
5|$|From {{her medical}} findings, Scully discovers that an alien virus {{is keeping the}} abductees alive long enough to cause a radical {{transformation}} to take place, {{similar to the one}} that Miles experienced. After Scully tells Doggett about the genetic transformation, he visits Absalom, who believes that the abductees are being resurrected into aliens who will eventually conquer Earth. Skinner—torn by his decision—decides to euthanize Mulder by <b>pulling</b> <b>him</b> off of life-support so that Krycek does not get his way. Doggett, however, catches Skinner attempting to remove the support. Skinner explains Krycek's demands, but Doggett argues that both options are unreasonable because either Scully's child will die, or Mulder will succumb to the virus. Doggett tries to locate Krycek {{in the parking lot of}} the FBI building, but Krycek nearly runs him down with a car, and purposely smashes the vaccine on the ground. Doggett tries to stop him but he escapes. Dejected, Doggett returns to the hospital and tells Skinner he was right not to trust Krycek. He finds Scully preparing Mulder for the now-destroyed vaccine; She tells Doggett that keeping Mulder on life-support was incubating the virus and hastening it along, and that Skinner effectively saved Mulder's life by <b>pulling</b> <b>him</b> off life-support, as it made his temperature drop rapidly without affecting his vital signs. She states that she will be able to use a combination of antiviral drugs to kill the alien virus if they can get him and his temperature to stabilize.|$|E
5|$|Gilsig has {{characterized}} Terri as being emotionally {{still in high}} school, and lacking the skills to make her marriage work. She has explained that Terri feels threatened by her husband's commitment to the glee club, worried that it is <b>pulling</b> <b>him</b> away from her, and will stop at nothing to keep her marriage together. She {{does not know how}} long Terri will be featured in the series, as she was initially created simply as an obstacle to come between Will and Emma.|$|E

5|$|Angola {{held the}} first round of its 1992 presidential {{election}} on 29–30 September. Dos Santos officially received 49.57% of the vote and Savimbi won 40.6%. As no candidate received 50% or more of the vote, election law dictated a second round of voting between the top two contenders. Savimbi, along with eight opposition parties and many other election observers, said the election had been neither free nor fair. An official observer wrote that there was little UN supervision, that 500,000 UNITA voters were disenfranchised and that there were 100 clandestine polling stations. Savimbi sent Jeremias Chitunda, Vice President of UNITA, to Luanda to negotiate the terms of the second round. The election process broke down on 31 October, when government troops in Luanda attacked UNITA. Civilians, using guns they had received from police a few days earlier, conducted house-by-house raids with the Rapid Intervention Police, killing and detaining hundreds of UNITA supporters. The government took civilians in trucks to the Camama cemetery and Morro da Luz ravine, shot them, and buried them in mass graves. Assailants attacked Chitunda's convoy on 2 November, <b>pulling</b> <b>him</b> out of his car and shooting him and two others in their faces. The MPLA massacred over ten thousand UNITA and FNLA voters nationwide in a few days in what was known as the Halloween Massacre. Savimbi said the election had neither been free nor fair and refused to participate in the second round. He then proceeded to resume armed struggle against the MPLA.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{entering}} Moria, Gimli is devastated {{to learn}} rumors regarding Balin and the dwarves are true; {{they have been}} wiped out by orcs. The fellowship fight {{their way to the}} Chamber of Mazarbul, where they find the tomb of Balin, and a record of how the mines were lost. Fighting their way through a hoard of orcs and trolls, they are attacked by a Balrog. They flee, reaching the Bridge of Khazad-dûm, where Gandalf defeats the Balrog by destroying the bridge as it stands on it. However, as the Balrog falls, it catches Gandalf with its whip, <b>pulling</b> <b>him</b> down after it.|$|E
25|$|By {{the middle}} of the battle, as dawn was about to break, the allied fleet had the upper hand and half of Shimazu's fleet were either sunk or captured. It was said that Yoshihiro's {{flagship}} was sunk and that he was clinging to a piece of wood in the icy water. Japanese ships came to his rescue, <b>pulling</b> <b>him</b> to safety. During the course of the battle, the ships fought from the west end of the strait all the way across to the east end, almost to the open water. The Japanese sustained heavy damage and began to retreat along the south coast of Namhae Island, towards Pusan.|$|E

25|$|A {{few years}} after {{arriving}} in London, Starkey began to suffer from his own success. A variety of projects, from the manufacture of perfumes and pharmaceuticals {{to the production of}} sophic mercuries, were <b>pulling</b> <b>him</b> in different directions, straining professional relationships, and failed to generate sufficient income. The cost to personally fund these projects was leaving him financially unstable as debts increased. Finally, in 1653–1654, Starkey's creditors caught up with him. He was imprisoned twice for debt, and when not in prison, he avoided creditors by concealing his whereabouts. To make matters worse, he had lost the support of the Hartlib circle. It was necessary that a beleaguered Starkey reestablish his financial footing, restore his reputation, and attract new patronage.|$|E
25|$|They set out, {{and attempt}} to cross Caradhras, but a {{snowstorm}} causes an avalanche, closing the pass. They reluctantly decide the only way past the Misty Mountains is to go under them, via the dwarven mines of Moria. In Moria, they fight off orcs as they pass through the chambers. Near the exit, they are attacked by a Balrog. Gandalf stands against it, defeating it by destroying the bridge on which it is standing. However, as it falls, it catches Gandalf with its whip, <b>pulling</b> <b>him</b> down after it. The distraught party leave Moria, entering Lothlórien, and meeting Galadriel (Jennifer Hale). She takes Frodo to see the Mirror of Galadriel, where he sees images of the coming War of the Ring. Frodo offers her the One Ring and although she is tempted, she turns it down, explaining that his resistance to its evil is because he has never tried {{to use it to}} control others.|$|E
25|$|Andrianjafy became bolder {{and decided}} to send a group of assassins to Ramboasalama's {{residence}} in Ambohimanga; confident of his plan, he showed the funeral goods he had prepared for Ramboasalama to his brother, and then departed his stronghold at Ambohimanga for a circumcision ceremony {{to be held at}} Ilafy. Andriantsimitovizainitrimo promptly sent a messenger to his nephew instructing him to flee. Rather than leave Ambohimanga, Ramboasalama followed the advice of an elder who instructed him to sacrifice a ram to invoke ancestral protection. The elder then gathered the twelve most respected men of Ambohimanga and thirty soldiers, and rallied them to enforce the decree of Andriambelomasina by overthrowing Andrianjafy and swearing allegiance to Ramboasalama, who took the throne name Andrianampoinimerina. The support of the Tsimahafotsy, inhabitants of Ambohimanga, ensured the defense of the city against efforts by Andrianjafy to reclaim his capital and his authority. Enraged, Andrianjafy took revenge against his brother Andriantsimitovizainitrimo, whom he murdered by <b>pulling</b> <b>him</b> from his bed, which was raised in the traditional style over fifteen feet above the ground.|$|E

25|$|Del Rio {{returned}} at a WWE house show in San Francisco on February 11, 2012, arm wrestling Sheamus to a no contest. On February 19 at Elimination Chamber, Del Rio made {{an appearance}} {{to show support}} to Raw General Manager John Laurinaitis. Del Rio returned on the April 2 episode of Raw, confronting World Heavyweight Champion Sheamus and vowing {{to become the next}} champion. On the April 6 episode of SmackDown, Del Rio defeated Sheamus in a non-title match by disqualification to earn a shot at the World Heavyweight Title. On the April 20 episode of SmackDown, Del Rio and Ricardo Rodriguez were officially traded from Raw to SmackDown. On May 20 at Over the Limit, Del Rio failed to capture the World Heavyweight Title from Sheamus in a fatal four-way match, also involving Chris Jericho and Randy Orton. On the May 25 episode of SmackDown, Del Rio defeated Kane and Orton in a triple threat match to become the number one contender to the World Heavyweight Championship. The next week on SmackDown, Del Rio suffered a legitimate concussion, which led to WWE <b>pulling</b> <b>him</b> from his scheduled World Heavyweight Championship match against Sheamus at No Way Out. Del Rio returned on the June 18 episode of Raw, defeating United States Champion Santino Marella in a non-title match. The next week on Raw, Del Rio wrestled Dolph Ziggler to a no contest in a Contract on a Pole match for a shot at the World Heavyweight Championship. In result, both Del Rio and Ziggler were entered into the championship match four days later on SmackDown, where Sheamus retained the title after pinning Ziggler. Del Rio received another shot at the World Heavyweight Championship on July 15 at Money in the Bank, where he again lost Sheamus. The next night on Raw, Del Rio was looking to take out his frustrations on Zack Ryder, but his post-match assault was interrupted by his longtime rival Rey Mysterio making his return and attacking him. Four days later on SmackDown, Del Rio and Ziggler lost to Mysterio and Sheamus by disqualification after Rodriguez interfered, but Del Rio viciously attacked Sheamus. On the July 27 episode of SmackDown, Del Rio defeated Daniel Bryan, Kane, and Mysterio in a fatal four-way match to again become number one contender for the World Heavyweight Championship. The title match, originally set for SummerSlam, was moved to the August 10 episode of SmackDown, after Del Rio threatened to press charges against Sheamus for stealing his car on the August 6 episode of Raw, which would have prevented Sheamus from appearing at Summerslam. However, before the match began, Del Rio attacked Sheamus along with men posing as police officers, which led to SmackDown General Manager Booker T taking away his number one contender's status in result. However, the next week, Sheamus had the title match put back on for SummerSlam on August 19, where Del Rio again failed in attempt to dethrone Sheamus after the referee didn't notice Del Rio's foot on the bottom rope. On the August 24 episode of SmackDown, Del Rio defeated Randy Orton by submission to once again become the number one contender for the World Heavyweight Championship. On the September 7 SmackDown, Del Rio filed assault charges against Sheamus, after Sheamus had attacked him and Rodriguez on the September 3 episode Raw, which led to Booker T banning the Brogue Kick with the caveat that Sheamus would be stripped of the World Heavyweight Championship if he used the move again. However, on September 16 at Night of Champions, Booker T concluded his investigation into the dangers of the move and lifted the ban. In the match that followed, Sheamus used the Brogue Kick to defeat Del Rio and retain the World Heavyweight Title. With his rivalry with Sheamus behind him, Del Rio moved on to feuding with Randy Orton, with the two attacking each other on the September 28 episode of SmackDown. The rivalry built to a singles match on October 28 at Hell in a Cell, where Orton emerged victorious. On the October 31 episode of Main Event, Del Rio teamed with The Prime Time Players (Darren Young and Titus O'Neil) to face Orton, Rey Mysterio, and Sin Cara in six-man tag team bout that ended with Orton pinning Del Rio for the win. On the November 6 episode of SmackDown, Del Rio was again defeated by Orton in a Falls Count Anywhere match, after taking an RKO onto the ringside steel steps. The two were then on opposing teams for the traditional five-on-five elimination tag match on November 18 at Survivor Series. Del Rio's team, led by Dolph Ziggler, defeated Orton's team, led by Mick Foley, despite Del Rio being eliminated by Orton prior to the finish. The next night on Raw, Del Rio once again lost to Orton in a two-out-of-three-falls match, ending the feud.|$|E
500|$|During this period, Ochs {{was taking}} drugs {{to get through}} performances. He had been taking Valium for years to help control his nerves, {{and he was also}} {{drinking}} heavily. Pianist Lincoln Mayorga said of that period, [...] "He was physically abusing himself very badly on that tour. He was drinking a lot of wine and taking uppers. The wine was <b>pulling</b> <b>him</b> one way and the uppers were <b>pulling</b> <b>him</b> another way, and he was kind of a mess. There were so many pharmaceuticals around—so many pills. I'd never seen anything like that." [...] Ochs tried to cut back on the pills, but alcohol remained his drug of choice {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
500|$|As {{noted on}} the [...] "TNA Mobile" [...] service, Cosme signed a {{contract}} with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA). Cosme was billed as James Mitchell's kayfabe son and thus Abyss' brother. Beginning on July 1, 2007, vignettes began to air for this [...] "monster-like" [...] character. His name was eventually billed as Judas Mesias. At No Surrender, he pulled Abyss under the ring by cutting a hole through it with a knife and <b>pulling</b> <b>him</b> underneath. On the September 13, 2007 episode of Impact!, during a submission match between Abyss and Kurt Angle in the Six Sides of Steel, Mesias made his official debut, climbing up from underneath the ring and subsequently attacking Abyss. On the September 20 episode of Impact!, Mesias defeated Eric Young in his debut match in TNA.|$|E

500|$|McCain's plane {{went into}} a {{vertical}} inverted spin. McCain bailed out upside down at high speed; {{the force of the}} ejection fractured his right arm in three places, his left arm, and his right leg at the knee, and knocked him unconscious. McCain nearly drowned after parachuting into Trúc Bạch Lake in Hanoi; the weight of his equipment was <b>pulling</b> <b>him</b> down, and as he regained consciousness, he could not use his arms. Eventually, he was able to inflate his life vest using his teeth. Several Vietnamese, possibly led by Department of Industry clerk Mai Van On, pulled him ashore. [...] A mob gathered around, spat on him, kicked him, and stripped him of his clothes; his left shoulder was crushed with the butt of a rifle and he was bayoneted in his left foot and abdominal area. He was then transported to Hanoi's main Hỏa Lò Prison, nicknamed the [...] "Hanoi Hilton" [...] by American POWs.|$|E
500|$|A further {{inspiration}} {{came from}} a story in Charlie Chaplin's autobiography; while touring with a British musical theatre, he stayed at a tenement home. After dinner, the family took him upstairs to meet their son, <b>pulling</b> <b>him</b> {{out from under a}} bed. The son ("a half man with no legs, an oversized, blond, flat-shaped head, a sickening white face, a sunken nose, a large mouth," [...] according to Chaplin) [...] "flopp around" [...] while they sang and danced. Morgan used this incident within the screenplay, although at Wong's suggestion they changed the character to the boy's mother. It took some time for the concepts to come together into a story; elements first appeared in the second season episode [...] "Humbug", written by Morgan's brother Darin and featuring a cast of circus sideshow performers. The episode incorporated several themes that had an influence on [...] "Home", including the use of a [...] "benign soul trapped in the body of a monster".|$|E

Producer Nonie Robinson claimed, [...] "We were the last project standing behind him" [...] but said that <b>pulling</b> <b>him</b> from the documentary was [...] "the right thing to do in light of the recent court deposition being made public".
