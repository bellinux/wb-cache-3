5|$|The other subspecies, sclateri, has {{slightly}} longer wings {{and a smaller}} bill. The plumage is less golden, with the forehead and uppertail-coverts being blue-green, and with both the wings and tail being blue-black. The underparts of T. e. sclateri also vary in being <b>pure</b> <b>white</b> without streaks.|$|E
5|$|The pygmaea–rixosa group (small weasels): Tiny weasels {{with short}} tails, pedomorphic skulls, and pelts that turn <b>pure</b> <b>white</b> in winter. They inhabit {{northern}} European Russia, Siberia, the Russian Far East, Finland, northern Scandinavian Peninsula, Mongolia, northeastern China, Japan and North America.|$|E
5|$|On {{the west}} coast of Scotland, the Cailleach ushers in winter by washing her great plaid (Gaelic: féileadh mòr) in the Gulf of Corryvreckan (Gaelic: Coire Bhreacain - 'cauldron of the plaid'). This process is said to take three days, during which the roar of the coming tempest is heard as far away as twenty miles (32km) inland. When she is finished, her plaid is <b>pure</b> <b>white</b> and snow covers the land.|$|E

5|$|The Ethiopian {{highland}} hare (Lepus starcki) is {{a medium-sized}} species of mammal in the rabbit and hare family, Leporidae. Its dorsal pelage is grizzled, buff white and spotted and streaked with black, while its belly fur is <b>pure</b> <b>white</b> and fluffy. It is endemic to the Ethiopian Highlands, ranging over the Afroalpine {{regions of the}} Shoa, Bale, and Arsi Provinces of Ethiopia. A herbivore, it mostly feeds on moorland grasses. The IUCN rates it as a species of least concern.|$|E
5|$|W2 {{is found}} in Thoroughbred horses descended from KY Colonel, a {{stallion}} born in 1946. While KY Colonel {{was described as a}} chestnut with extensive white markings, he is known for siring a family of <b>pure</b> <b>white</b> horses through his white daughter, White Beauty, born in 1963. The W2 allele is also linked to a single nucleotide polymorphism (c.1960G>A), but it is a missense mutation located on Exon17.|$|E
5|$|W4 {{is found}} in Camarillo White Horses, a breed {{characterized}} by a white coat, beginning with a spontaneous white stallion born in 1912 named Sultan. Like W1 and W3, horses {{with this type of}} dominant white may be <b>pure</b> <b>white</b> or near-white, with pigmented areas along the topline that fade with time. This mutation is also an SNP (c.1805C>T), a missense mutation on Exon12.|$|E

5|$|Coat color {{ranges from}} almost <b>pure</b> <b>white</b> through various shades of blond, cream, and ochre to grays, browns, and blacks, with {{variation}} in fur color tending {{to increase in}} higher latitudes. Differences in coat color between sexes are largely absent, though females may have redder tones. Black-colored wolves in North America inherited the Kb allele responsible for melanism from past interbreeding with dogs, while the mutation {{was found to be}} naturally occurring in wolves from Iran. Black specimens are more common in North America than in Eurasia, with about half the wolves in Yellowstone National Park being black.|$|E
5|$|E. c. albipennis was {{described}} by John Gould in 1841 and found in north Queensland, west though the Gulf of Carpentaria in the Northern Territory and across {{into the top of}} Western Australia. It has white on the wings and a discontinuous stripe on the nape. The wing patch is <b>pure</b> <b>white</b> {{in the western part of}} its range and is more cream towards the east. It has a longer bill and shorter tail than the nominate race. Birds also decrease in size with decreasing latitude, consistent with Bergmann's rule. Molecular work supports the current classification of this subspecies as distinct from the nominate subspecies cyanotis.|$|E
5|$|Least weasels {{from various}} parts of its range vary greatly in size. The body is slender and {{elongated}} and the legs and tail are relatively short. The colour varies geographically, as does the pelage type and length of tail. The dorsal surface, flanks, limbs and tail of the animal are usually some shade of brown while the underparts are white. The line delineating {{the boundary between the}} two colours is usually straight. At high altitudes and {{in the northern part of}} its range, the coat becomes <b>pure</b> <b>white</b> in winter. Eighteen subspecies are recognised.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 30 mm. Adults {{are entirely}} <b>pure</b> milky <b>white.</b>|$|R

50|$|On December 1, 1821, a {{constitutive}} act {{was ordered}} to petition the union of Spanish Haiti with Gran Colombia.The state of the Republic of Spanish Haiti was {{not supported by the}} population of slaves and servants who were wary of the rule of <b>pure</b> <b>whites,</b> and preferred to unite with French Haiti, because of their abolition of slavery.|$|R
5|$|The Aylesbury duck is a {{breed of}} domesticated duck, bred mainly for its meat and appearance. It {{is a large}} duck with <b>pure</b> <b>white</b> plumage, a pink bill, orange legs and feet, an unusually large keel, and a {{horizontal}} stance with its body parallel to the ground. The precise origins of the breed are unclear, but raising white ducks became popular in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, England, in the 18th century owing to the demand for white feathers as a filler for quilts. Over the 19th century selective breeding for size, shape and colour led to the Aylesbury duck.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{tree sparrow}} (Passer montanus) is a {{passerine}} {{bird in the}} sparrow family with a rich chestnut crown and nape, and a black patch on each <b>pure</b> <b>white</b> cheek. The sexes are similarly plumaged, and young birds are a duller version of the adult. This sparrow breeds over most of temperate Eurasia and Southeast Asia, where it {{is known as the}} tree sparrow, and it has been introduced elsewhere including the United States, where it is known as the Eurasian tree sparrow or German sparrow to differentiate it from the native unrelated American tree sparrow. Although several subspecies are recognised, the appearance of this bird varies little across its extensive range.|$|E
5|$|W5 {{is found}} in Thoroughbreds {{descending}} from Puchilingui, a 1984 stallion with sabino-like white spotting and roaning. Horses with the W5 allele exhibit a huge range in white phenotype: a few have been <b>pure</b> <b>white</b> or near-white, while others have sabino-like spotting limited to high, irregular stockings and blazes that covered the face. Twenty-two members of this family were studied, and the 12 {{with some degree of}} dominant white spotting were found to have a deletion in exon 15 (p.T732QfsX9), {{in the form of a}} frameshift mutation. A later study found that the members of this family with the greatest depigmentation were compound heterozygotes who also carried the W20 allele.|$|E
5000|$|Around 1906, G. Brunning and Sons, a plant nursery in St Kilda, Victoria, {{renowned for}} their {{chrysanthemum}} varieties, produced a cultivar — later described as [...] "a decorative Japanese {{variety of the}} <b>purest</b> <b>white,</b> {{and one of the}} most valuable of these for late flowering and conservatory decoration" [...] — which was officially named [...] "Miss Maud Jeffries".|$|R
60|$|Once in Thibet we were {{imprisoned for}} months by snows that {{stretched}} {{down from the}} mountain slopes into the valleys and oh! how weary did we grow of those arid, aching fields of <b>purest</b> <b>white.</b> At length rain set in, and blinding mists {{in which it was}} not safe to wander, that made the dark nights darker yet.|$|R
50|$|The {{choice of}} {{location}} was due, in part, to the proximity of necessary raw materials, such as the <b>purest</b> <b>white</b> bauxite in Europe, alumina provided by the company Péchiney in Gardanne, and the silica sand of the Mont Ventoux region. It was also {{in close proximity to}} the port city of Marseille and the Rhone, valuable for its hydro-electric energy.|$|R
5|$|Corvus is {{associated}} with the myth of Apollo and his lover Coronis the Lapith. Coronis had been unfaithful to Apollo; when he learned this information from a <b>pure</b> <b>white</b> crow, he turned its feathers black in a fit of rage. Another legend associated with Corvus is that a crow stopped on his way to fetch water for Apollo, to eat figs. Instead of telling the truth to Apollo, he lied and said that a snake, Hydra, kept him from the water, while holding a snake in his talons as proof. Apollo, realizing this was a lie, flung the crow (Corvus), cup (Crater), and snake (Hydra) into the sky. He further punished the wayward bird by ensuring it would forever be thirsty, both in real life and in the heavens, where the Cup is just out of reach.|$|E
5|$|Morchella tridentina (=Morchella frustrata) is also rufescent {{and very}} similar to M. rufobrunnea. It is found in mountainous forests and maquis and forms a marked sinus at the {{attachment}} of the cap with the stem, which is <b>pure</b> <b>white.</b> At maturity, it develops more or less parallel, ladderlike interconnecting ridges. Microscopically, it often has moniliform paraphyses with septa extending in the upper half and has more regularly cylindrical or clavate 'hairs' on the stem, up to 100 μm long. M.guatemalensis, found in Central America, has a color ranging from yellow to yellowish-orange, but never grey, {{and it has a}} more distinct reddish to wine red bruising reaction. Microscopically, it has smaller paraphyses, measuring 56–103 by 6.5–13µm. The New Guinean species M.rigidoides has smaller fruit bodies that are pale ochre to yellow, without any grey. Its pits are less elongated than those of M.rufobrunnea, and it has wider paraphyses, up to 30µm.|$|E
5|$|The winter fur is dense, {{but short}} and closely fitting. In {{northern}} subspecies, the fur {{is soft and}} silky, but coarse in southern forms. The summer fur is very short, sparser and rougher. The upper parts in the summer fur are dark, but vary geographically from dark-tawny or dark-chocolate to light pale tawny or sandy. The lower parts, including the lower jaw and inner sides of the legs, are white. There is often a brown spot {{at the corner of}} the mouth. The dividing line between the dark upper and light lower parts is usually straight but sometimes forms an irregular line. The tail is brown, and sometimes the tip is a little darker but it is never black. In the northern part of its range and at high altitudes, the least weasel changes colour in the winter, the coat becoming <b>pure</b> <b>white</b> and exhibiting a few black hairs in rare circumstances.|$|E
