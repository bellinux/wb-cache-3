5|$|The <b>Palaeozoic</b> era is {{represented}} in the park by the model rock exposure showing a succession of beds, namely the Carboniferous (including Coal Measures and limestone) and Permian.|$|E
5|$|The geology of Wales {{is complex}} and varied. The {{earliest}} outcropping rocks are from the Precambrian era, some 700 Mya, and are found in Anglesey, the Llŷn peninsula, southwestern Pembrokeshire and in places near the English border. During the Lower <b>Palaeozoic,</b> as seas periodically flooded the land and retreated again, thousands of metres of sedimentary and volcanic rocks accumulated in a marine basin known as the Welsh Basin.|$|E
5|$|Iran {{lies within}} the complex zone of {{collision}} between the Arabian Plate and the Eurasian Plate; near Qeshm {{the rate of}} convergence is about 25 millimeters annually. Part of this convergence is accommodated by shortening within the Zagros fold and thrust belt, with the remainder occurring {{to the north of}} the Iranian Plateau. The most active part of the Zagros is the 'Simply Folded Belt', which is characterised by large folds formed above a layer of late Neoproterozoic to Early Cambrian Hormuz salt, which locally reaches the surface in the crests of some anticlines as salt diapirs. The sedimentary rocks above the salt layer comprise a basal Cambrian conglomerate and a thick sequence of limestones of <b>Palaeozoic</b> to Upper Cretaceous age, known together as the 'Competent Group' due to their relatively high competence, followed by a sequence of mechanically weaker marls and interbedded limestones of latest Cretaceous to Lower Miocene age topped by Neogene sandstones and conglomerates. There is evidence of intermediate level detachment at some of the weaker layers, leading to folds at different stratigraphic levels have different locations, orientations or wavelengths. Earthquake focal mechanisms and hypocentral depths show that shortening is accommodated by a mixture of high-angle and low-angle reverse faulting, within either the lowest part of the sedimentary cover or in the basement beneath the Hormuz salt.|$|E
5|$|Since Alfred Eisenack first {{recognised}} {{and named}} {{the group in}} 1930, the Chitinozoa have proven incredibly useful as a stratigraphic markers in biostratigraphy during the Ordovician, Silurian and Devonian periods. Their utility {{is due to the}} rapidity of their morphological evolution, their abundance — the most productive samples bearing almost a thousand tests per gram — and the easy identification (due largely to the large variation in shapes) and short lifetimes (<10 million years) of most species. They are also widely distributed and appear in a variety of marine depositional settings, making correlation easier; better still, they can often be recognised in even quite strongly metamorphosed rocks. However, convergence of morphological form to similar environments sometimes leads to the mistaken identification of a species in several areas separated by vast differences in space and time, but sharing a similar depositional environment; clearly, this can cause major problems if the organisms are interpreted as being the same species. Aside from the acritarchs, chitinozoans were the only reliable means of correlating <b>palæozoic</b> units until the late 1960s, when the detailed study of conodonts and graptolites fully unleashed their stratigraphic potential.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Palaeozoic</b> {{comprises}} six periods {{from the}} Cambrian to the Permian (542251 Ma).|$|E
25|$|The Phanerozoic {{comprises}} the <b>Palaeozoic,</b> Mesozoic and Cenozoic eras, {{each of which}} are represented in English geology.|$|E
25|$|The oldest rocks proved through {{boreholes}} {{to exist}} below London are the old, hard rocks of the <b>Palaeozoic.</b> These consist of Silurian mudstones and sandstones, generally overlain by Devonian strata which are largely of Old Red Sandstone. The Devonian rocks are absent {{in parts of}} South London. The <b>Palaeozoic</b> rocks dip southwards and are more than 1,000 metres below the English Channel. Above this is a 60-metre thick layer of impermeable Gault clays. These clays are relatively young, only {{going back to the}} early Cretaceous which began around 144 million years ago.|$|E
25|$|Several <b>Palaeozoic</b> to neoproterozoic {{sedimentary}} basins onlap the Musgrave Block, and {{are exposed}} mostly around its edges. These {{were derived from}} erosion of the Musgrave Block basement during the neoproterozoic to Permian.|$|E
25|$|There is {{much debate}} over whether the group of <b>Palaeozoic</b> fish known as the Thelodonti (formerly coelolepids) {{represent}} a monophyletic grouping, or disparate stem groups to the major lines of jawless and jawed fish.|$|E
25|$|The Musgrave Block is {{flanked by}} several Proterozoic to <b>Palaeozoic</b> {{sedimentary}} basins, whose sedimentary history can elucidate the timing of tectonic events in the Musgrave Block post-1080 Ma. These include the Proterozoic Amadeus and Officer Basins.|$|E
25|$|Libya has {{substantial}} {{potential for}} exploration {{with an average}} of 16 wells per 10,000-km, whereas similar countries usually average 50 (the world average is 105). IOC exploration will use imaging technology and stratigraphic concepts, extending to the <b>Palaeozoic</b> basins. These include the Murzuq, Kufra and Cyrenaica Platform regions, as well as the deeper <b>Palaeozoic</b> plays in the semi-mature (Ghadames) and mature (Sirte) basins. In 2007 it was estimated that only around 30% of Libya has been explored for hydrocarbons. In the Murzuq Basin, shows in oilwells in the early 1980s, followed by discoveries of giant fields like Elephant in 1997, opened a vast, formerly condemned, marginal province.|$|E
25|$|Fossil {{records of}} {{crayfish}} older than 30 million years are rare, but fossilised burrows {{have been found}} from strata {{as old as the}} late <b>Palaeozoic</b> or early Mesozoic. The oldest records of the Parastacidae are in Australia, and are 115 million years old.|$|E
25|$|The {{northern}} {{portion of}} the Arctic Cordillera was uplifted during the Innuitian orogeny when the North American Plate moved northward during the mid-Mesozoic. It contains igneous and metamorphic rocks, {{but for the most}} part is composed of sedimentary rocks. Mountains on Axel Heiberg Island consist mainly of long ridges of folded mid-Mesozoic and <b>Palaeozoic</b> strata with minor igneous intrusions.|$|E
25|$|Phalangiotarbi is an extinct {{arachnid}} order known {{exclusively from}} the <b>Palaeozoic</b> (Devonian to Permian) of Europe and North America. The affinities of phalangiotarbids are obscure, with most authors favouring affinities with Opiliones (harvestmen) and/or Acari (mites and ticks). Phalangiotarbi has been recently proposed to be sister group to (Palpigradi+Tetrapulmonata): the taxon Megoperculata sensu Shultz (1990).|$|E
25|$|The Yilgarn Craton is {{partially}} covered by onlapping sedimentary basins of <b>Palaeozoic</b> and Phanerozoic {{age in the}} east and north-east, including the Canning Basin. It is bounded on the western edge by the Darling Scarp and Darling Fault which separate the Yilgarn Craton from the Perth Basin to the west, and is covered by several remnant sedimentary basins of Jurassic age such as the Collie Sub-Basin.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Haeckel had totally {{abandoned}} the geologic {{uses of the}} -lithic terms. The concepts of <b>Palaeozoic,</b> Mesozoic and Cenozoic had been innovated in the early 19th century and were gradually becoming coin of the geologic realm. Realizing {{he was out of}} step, Haeckel started to transition to the -zoic system as early as 1876 in The history of creation, placing the -zoic form in parentheses next to the -lithic form.|$|E
25|$|The Perth Basin {{is bound}} {{on the north}} by the Gascoyne Complex, Glengarry Basin and Yerrida Basin, which {{are all part of}} a middle Proterozoic mobile belt which leads east to the Musgrave Block. The Gascoyne complex and other {{metamorphic}} belts of this age including reactivation of the Yarlarweelor Gneiss and Narryer Gneiss Terrane, indicate prolonged multi-phased strike-slip movement (relative to the Yilgarn Craton margin) from the late Archaean through to neoproterozoic and even into the <b>Palaeozoic.</b>|$|E
25|$|In contrast, Lafonia is {{underlain}} by Mesozoic age sandstone, {{a younger}} rock than the <b>Palaeozoic</b> rock to the north, giving a flatter landscape than is seen {{elsewhere on the}} island. Sheets of liquid basalt intruded into the cracks that formed between the sedimentary layers. The resulting solidified sheets can now {{be seen in the}} form of dikes that cut the oldest sedimentary layers, those that lie principally {{in the southern part of}} East Falkland and in South Africa.|$|E
25|$|The {{first half}} of Huxley's career as a {{palaeontologist}} {{is marked by a}} rather strange predilection for 'persistent types', in which he seemed to argue that evolutionary advancement (in the sense of major new groups of animals and plants) was rare or absent in the Phanerozoic. In the same vein, he tended to push the origin of major groups such as birds and mammals back into the <b>Palaeozoic</b> era, and to claim that no order of plants had ever gone extinct.|$|E
25|$|Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng National Park {{is one of}} the world's {{two largest}} {{limestone}} regions. In comparison with 41 other world heritage sites which have karsts, Phong Nha has dissimilar geomorphic, geologic and biotic conditions. The karsts of Phong Nha {{can be traced back to}} <b>Palaeozoic</b> era, 400 million years ago. This makes Phong Nha the oldest major karst in Asia. If the Hin Namno, bordering Phong Nha on the west (in Laotian territory) was to be combined with the national park in a continuous reserve, the combined reserve would be the largest surviving karst forest in southeastern Asia (317,754 ha).|$|E
25|$|The geology of Wales {{is complex}} and varied; its study has been of {{considerable}} historical significance {{in the development of}} geology as a science. All geological periods from the Cryogenian (late Precambrian) to the Jurassic are represented at outcrops, whilst younger sedimentary rocks occur beneath the seas immediately off the Welsh coast. The effects of two mountain-building episodes have left their mark in the faulting and folding of much of the <b>Palaeozoic</b> rock sequence. Superficial deposits and landforms created during the present Quaternary period by water and ice are also plentiful and contribute to a remarkably diverse landscape of mountains, hills and coastal plains.|$|E
25|$|Late Precambrian {{rocks are}} {{widespread}} on Anglesey, Llŷn and Arfon with other, more restricted occurrences in north Pembrokeshire, Radnorshire and Carmarthenshire. The often intensive metamorphism which these originally volcanic and sedimentary rocks {{have been subjected}} to and their generally faulted relationship to neighbouring rocks has meant that geologists’ understanding of them has been limited. The majority lie on or close to the margins of terranes, blocks of the Earth’s crust which have had differing geological histories before assuming their present configuration. However, in recent years there has been a progressive elucidation {{of the way in which}} Wales’ many terranes came together during the late Precambrian and the <b>Palaeozoic</b> era.|$|E
25|$|In the Mesozoic era {{the whole}} of the worn-down plateau was under sea. In this {{expansive}} shallow sea, which covered most of Assam (India) and Bhutan, chalk deposits formed from seawater tides oscillating between land and sea levels. During subsequent periods, tertiary rocks were laid down. The Paro metamorphic belt may be found overlying Chasilakha-Soraya gneiss in some places. Silurian metamorphics in other places suggest long denudation of the surface. This was the time of Alpine mountain formation, and much of the movement in the <b>palaeozoic</b> region was probably connected with it. The Chomolhari tourmaline granites of Bhutan, stretching westwards from the Paro chu and ats much depth below the present surface, were formed during this period of uplift, fracture and subsidence.|$|E
25|$|In {{the mid-19th}} century, two {{prominent}} geologists, Roderick Murchison and Adam Sedgwick used their {{studies of the}} geology of Wales to establish certain principles of stratigraphy and palaeontology. They did fundamental work on the Old Red Sandstone but are remembered more for their work on the lower <b>Palaeozoic</b> sequence. It was Sedgwick who established the Cambrian system and Murchison first described the Silurian, naming it for the ancient Silures tribe which occupied mid Wales. An overlap between the two systems as mapped led eventually to protracted dispute between the two erstwhile collaborators. After their deaths, Charles Lapworth erected the Ordovician system (again named for an ancient tribe of northwest Wales, the Ordovices), {{to account for the}} sequence of rocks {{at the heart of the}} controversy.|$|E
25|$|With {{the close}} of the <b>Palaeozoic,</b> most of the Permian groups disappeared, with the {{exception}} of the Mastodonsauroid and Metoposaurid families and the curious Plagiosauridae, who continued into the Triassic. In the early Triassic these families enjoyed a brief renaissance in the waterways of continental shallows, with large forms like Thoosuchus, Benthosuchus and Eryosuchus. Their ecological niches were probably similar to those of modern-day crocodiles, as fish hunters and riverside carnivores. All groups developed progressively weaker vertebrae, reduced limb ossification and flatter skulls with prominent lateral line organs, indicating the late Permian/early Triassic temnospondyls rarely if ever left the water. An extremely large Brachyopid (likely a plagiosaur or a close relative) is estimated to have been 7 meters long, and probably just as heavy as the Permian Prionosuchus.|$|E
25|$|During the <b>Palaeozoic</b> era {{at least}} a few {{thousand}} kilometres of ocean floor were subducted, taking of the order of a hundred million years. Sediments were deposited in the ocean floor in the form of fans formed by turbidity currents off the side of a continental slope. The flow was in the northerly direction, indicating that the continental slope was to the south. These deposits occurred during the Ordovician period. The ocean floor was distant from the continental source of the sediment. Towards the end of this period there were isolated parts where no turbidity currents reached and only fine clay and animal organic and silica debris were deposited into oxygen-depleted deep water. This ocean basin has been called the Monaro Basin. To the north west was a volcanic chain of islands, the Macquarie arc, with an associated submarine trench.|$|E
25|$|Bothriolepis is a genus placed {{within the}} placoderm order Antiarchi. The {{earliest}} antiarch placoderms {{first appeared in}} the Silurian period of the Paleozoic Era and could be found distributed on every paleocontinent by the Devonian period. The earliest members of Bothriolepis appear by the Middle Devonian. Antiarchs, as well as other placoderms, are morphologically diverse and are characterized by bony plates that cover their head and the anterior part of the trunk. Early ontogenetic stages of placoderms had thinner bony plates within both the head and trunk-shield, which allowed for easy distinction between early placoderm ontogenetic stages within the fossil record and taxa that possessed fully developed bony plates but were small by characterization. Placoderm bony plates were generally made up of three layers, including a compact basal lamellar bony layer, a middle spongy bony layer and a superficial layer; Bothriolepis can be classified as a placoderm since it possesses these layers. Placoderms were extinct {{by the end of the}} Devonian. Placodermi is a paraphyletic group of the clade Gnathostomata, which includes all jawed vertebrates. It is unclear exactly when gnathostomes emerged, but the scant early fossil record indicates that it was sometime in the Early <b>Palaeozoic</b> era. The last species of Bothriolepis died out, together with the rest of Placodermi, at the end of the Devonian period.|$|E

500|$|Several early authors {{believed}} the frilled shark to be a living representative of otherwise long-extinct groups of elasmobranchs (sharks, rays, and their ancestors), {{based on its}} multiple-pointed teeth, the articulation of its upper jaw directly to the cranium behind the eyes (called [...] "amphistyly"), and its [...] "notochord-like" [...] spinal column with indistinct vertebrae. Garman proposed that it was allied with the [...] "cladodonts", a now-obsolete taxonomic grouping containing forms that thrived during the <b>Palaeozoic</b> era, such as Cladoselache from the Devonian period (416–359 Mya). His contemporaries Theodore Gill and Edward Drinker Cope suggested it was instead related to the hybodonts, which were the dominant sharks during the Mesozoic era. Cope {{went as far as}} to assign this species to the fossil genus Didymodus.|$|E
500|$|Plant {{responses}} to climate {{and other environmental}} changes can inform {{our understanding of how}} these changes affect ecosystem function and productivity. For example, plant phenology can be a useful proxy for temperature in historical climatology, and the biological impact of climate change and global warming. Palynology, the analysis of fossil pollen deposits in sediments from thousands or millions of years ago allows the reconstruction of past climates. Estimates of atmospheric [...] concentrations since the <b>Palaeozoic</b> have been obtained from stomatal densities and the leaf shapes and sizes of ancient land plants. Ozone depletion can expose plants to higher levels of ultraviolet radiation-B (UV-B), resulting in lower growth rates. Moreover, information from studies of community ecology, plant systematics, and taxonomy is essential to understanding vegetation change, habitat destruction and species extinction.|$|E

500|$|Kersal Moor {{is one of}} {{the many}} fluvioglacial ridges that formed along the Irwell Valley during the melting of the glaciers at the end of the last ice age. Typically for this type of landform, the subsoil is {{composed}} of sand mixed with coarse gravel. The 19th century botanist Richard Buxton described this as [...] "Mr. E.W. Binney's drift deposit no.2... a deposit of sharp forest sand, parted with layers of gravel composed of Azoic, <b>Palaeozoic</b> and Triassic rocks, well rounded, parted with layers of fine sand, and having every appearance of a regular deposit by water." [...] This deposit is overlaid with a thin topsoil supporting a range of mosses, heathers, grasses, ferns, common broom, gorse and some trees, which are predominantly oak with some rowan, cherry and other broadleaved species. The land to the south is elevated, rising to a high point towards the south-west. From this elevated position there are views across Manchester to the Derbyshire hills in the south, to the Pennines in the north east and across the Irwell Valley and Salford in the west. The land falls away to the north, ending with two drumlin-shaped hills on the northern edge, which were probably formed by sediment from the meltwater of the receding glaciers, in a process known as sedimentary fluting. The moor is criss-crossed with footpaths, many of which cut through to the sand and gravel below. Singleton Brook, to the north of the moor, denotes the boundary between Salford and Prestwich.|$|E

These lands were converted to agricultural zone due to the suitability to grow crops under abundant rainfall conditions. However, Ordovician or sedimentary soils, due to its poor soil conditions for farming, have remained undisturbed.
