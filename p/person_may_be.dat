5|$|The {{ratio of}} carboxy{{hemoglobin}} to hemoglobin molecules {{in an average}} <b>person</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> up to 5%, although cigarette smokers who smoke two packs per day may have levels up to 9%.

5|$|Not all {{withdrawal}} {{effects are}} evidence of true dependence or withdrawal. Recurrence of {{symptoms such as}} anxiety may simply indicate that the drug was having its expected anti-anxiety effect and that, {{in the absence of}} the drug, the symptom has returned to pretreatment levels. If the symptoms are more severe or frequent, the <b>person</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> experiencing a rebound effect due to the removal of the drug. Either of these can occur without the person actually being drug-dependent.|$|E

5|$|Activities {{that reduce}} {{physiological}} arousal and cognitive activity promote falling asleep, so engaging in relaxing activities before bedtime is recommended. Conversely, continuing important work activities or planning shortly before bedtime or once in bed {{has been shown}} to delay falling asleep. Similarly, good sleep hygiene involves minimizing time spent thinking about worries or anything emotionally upsetting shortly before bedtime. Trying purposefully to fall asleep may induce frustration that further prevents falling asleep, so in such situations a <b>person</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> advised {{to get out of bed}} and try something else for a brief amount of time.|$|E
5|$|Three {{types of}} {{influenza}} viruses affect people, called Type A, Type B, and Type C. Usually, {{the virus is}} spread through the air from coughs or sneezes. This is believed to occur mostly over relatively short distances. It can also be spread by touching surfaces contaminated by the virus and then touching the mouth or eyes. A <b>person</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> infectious to others both {{before and during the}} time they are showing symptoms. The infection may be confirmed by testing the throat, sputum, or nose for the virus. A number of rapid tests are available; however, people may still have the infection if the results are negative. A type of polymerase chain reaction that detects the virus's RNA is more accurate.|$|E

25|$|The Catholic Church and {{the ancient}} Christian Churches see priestly {{ordination}} as a sacrament dedicating the person ordained to a permanent relationship of service, and, like Baptism and Confirmation, having an ontological effect on the person.
