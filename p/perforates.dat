5|$|As {{usual in}} oryzomyines, 12 ribs are present. The first rib articulates {{with both the}} last {{cervical}} (neck) and first thoracic (chest) vertebrae, a synapomorphy of the Sigmodontinae. The anapophyses, processes {{at the back of}} vertebrae, are absent from the fifth lumbar. Between the second and third caudal vertebrae, hemal arches (small bones) are present with a spinous back border. The entepicondylar foramen is absent, as in all members of the Sigmodontinae; if present, as in some other rodents, this foramen <b>perforates</b> the distal end of the humerus.|$|E
5|$|Pseudoryzomys has 19 or 20thoracic (chest) and lumbar vertebrae, 13 {{of which}} bear ribs, as is {{characteristic}} of oryzomyines. The first ribs contact both the seventh cervical (neck) vertebra and the first thoracic vertebra, an important character of the Sigmodontinae. Unlike in most sigmodontines, including Holochilus and Lundomys, the fourth lumbar vertebra lacks the processes known as anapophyses. There are three or four sacral and about 29caudal (tail) vertebrae. Between {{the second and third}} caudal vertebrae, separate bones called hemal arches are present. These display a spinous process at the back, as in both Holochilus and Lundomys. On the humerus, the upper arm bone, the entepicondylar foramen is absent, as in all members of the Sigmodontinae; in some other cricetids, it <b>perforates</b> the far (distal) end of the humerus.|$|E

500|$|The holotype {{is a right}} maxilla (upper jaw) {{with the}} upper first molar (M1) in it. It is broken off behind the M1, {{but much of the}} front part is preserved, {{including}} the zygomatic plate, the flattened front portion of the zygomatic arch (cheekbone). The M1 is moderately worn, indicating that it is from an adult individual. With an M1 length of 3.59mm and width of 2.53mm, C.cailoi was one of the largest oryzomyines known, rivaled only by Lundomys and the extinct Antillean Megalomys and [...] "Ekbletomys". The height of the M1 is 1.37mm and it has four roots, including a large one in front, another large one on the inner (lingual) side, and two smaller ones on the outer (labial) side. The presence of a second labial root is a variable character among oryzomyines, occurring among others in Holochilus and Pseudoryzomys but not in Lundomys. The maxilla itself shows few significant characters. The back margin of the incisive foramen, which <b>perforates</b> the palate between the upper incisors and the molars, is not visible, suggesting that the foramen was short, as in Holochilus. The configuration of the zygomatic plate shows features that distinguish C.cailoi from some of its relatives.|$|E

6000|$|Corslets, in Homer, are flimsy; that of Lycaon, worn by Paris, is {{pierced by}} a spear which has also {{perforated}} his shield, though the spear came {{only from the}} weak hand of Menelaus (Iliad, III. 357, 358). The arrow of Pandarus whistles through the corslet of Menelaus (IV. 136). The same archer pierces with an arrow the corslet of Diomede (V. 99, 100). The corslet of Diomede, however, avails to stop a spear which has traversed his shield (V. 281). The spear of Idomeneus pierces the corslet of Othryoneus, and the spear of Antilochus <b>perforates</b> the corslet of a charioteer (XIII. 371, 397). A few lines later Diomede's spear reaches the midriff of Hypsenor. No corslet is here mentioned, but neither is the shield mentioned (this constantly occurs), and we cannot argue that Hypsenor wore no corslet, unless we are also to contend that he wore no shield, or a small shield. Idomeneus drives his spear through the [...] "bronze chiton" [...] of Alcathöus (XIII. 439, 440). Mr. Leaf reckons these lines [...] "probably an interpolation to turn the linen chiton, the rending {{of which is the}} sign of triumph, into a bronze corslet."

This worthy had a bored, good-natured, unbuttoned, expansive look; was talkative, restless, almost disreputably human. He was surrounded by a great deal of small luggage, and had scattered over the carriage his books, his papers, the fragments of his lunch, and the contents of an extraordinary bag, which he kept beside him - a kind of secular reliquary - and which appeared to contain the odds and ends of a lifetime, as he took from it successively a pair of slippers, an old padlock (which evidently didn't belong to it), an opera-glass, a collection of almanacs, and a large sea-shell, which he very carefully examined. I think that if he had not been afraid of the young monk, who was so much more serious than he, he would have held the shell to his ear, like a child.

They include Kyrle′s disease, <b>perforating</b> folliculitis, reactive <b>perforating</b> collagenosis, and elastosis perforans serpiginosa. Aim: The aim of this study was to delineate the clinical and histopathological features of <b>perforating</b> disorders of the skin. Materials and Methods: In our study, we reviewed last 2 years skin biopsies received by us. Hematoxylin and eosin sections were re-examined and histochemical stainings (elastic van Gieson and Masson trichrome stains) were also used for histopathological evaluation. Results: We reviewed five cases of <b>perforating</b> disorders of skin which included two cases of Kyrle′s disease, two cases of reactive <b>perforating</b> collagenosis and a single case of <b>perforating</b> folliculitis. Two patients had family history of <b>perforating</b> dermatosis in their siblings and three had associated systemic disease.

Our poor results with lateral subfascial endoscopic <b>perforating</b> vein surgery (SEPS) procedures led us to study the anatomy of the <b>perforating</b> veins in the lateral leg. The presence of persistent insufficient <b>perforating</b> veins in our patients suggests that our procedure failed because of misinterpreted perforator anatomy. Methods and resultsAnatomic dissection was performed in 16 cadavers in two stages, subcutaneously and subfascially. <b>Perforating</b> veins were classified relative to the short saphenous vein and intermuscular septa, with coordinates. Three hundred fifty-one <b>perforating</b> veins were found, for an average of 21. 9 <b>perforating</b> veins per leg. The results showed that there is alignment of the <b>perforating</b> veins according to the septa between the anterior and peroneal compartment and between the peroneal compartment and the superficial dorsal compartment. Most of the <b>perforating</b> veins did not correlate with the short saphenous vein.
