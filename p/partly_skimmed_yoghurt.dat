40|$|A {{systematic}} {{study on}} the effect of some commonly used hydrocolloids in yoghurt formulation, namely gelatin (0. 5 – 1. 5 %), xanthan gum (0. 005 – 0. 015 %), carrageenan (0. 01 – 0. 08 %) and modified starch (0. 5 – 1. 5 %) on the physical, tribology and sensory characteristics of <b>skim</b> pot-set <b>yoghurt</b> (0. 1 % fat) is presented. The results support to develop a tribology model for yoghurt, which can be directly correlated with the scores on texture and mouthfeel attributes from sensory panel by mean of statistical analysis. The tribological behavior, which signifies the lubrication property of the product, depended on the fat content, the type and dosage of hydrocolloid. Among the four hydrocolloids investigated, gelatin appeared to be the best hydrocolloid due to its ability to reduce syneresis, increase texture, viscosity, gel strength and lubrication properties of <b>skim</b> <b>yoghurt.</b> As a result, its sensory perception was significantly improved and attained the same sensory scores with full fat yoghurt for various desired sensory attributes, such as thickness, smoothness and creaminess. Both xanthan gum and carrageenan increased the firmness and viscosity of <b>skim</b> <b>yoghurt,</b> but also significantly increased the syneresis and undesired sensory mouthfeel characteristics, such as chalkiness and lumpiness. Modified starch slightly improved lubrication properties and thickness of <b>skim</b> <b>yoghurt</b> without significant changes in the product texture. From tribological analysis of investigated samples, a four-zone tribology model for yoghurt was proposed. Each zone corresponds to different mechanisms of fluid entrained between the two contact surfaces. The tribology behavior of the yoghurt fluid, therefore, can be represented by the position of each transition point and the slope of each friction zone, which were aligned with the sensory scores from trained panel...|$|R
40|$|For a long time, {{fermented}} {{dairy products}} have been consumed for human’s nutrition and health. Recently, consumption of whole dairy products, such as full fat yoghurt, has declined {{due to the}} awareness of probable harmful effects of fat on consumers’ health, resulting change of market interest in favor of low or non fat dairy products. It is a challenge for food scientists to produce a suitable fat substitute providing the functionality of the missing fat. The present investigation was carried out to {{examine the effect of}} 0 to 50 % renneted skim milk (RSM) as a fat mimetic upon the physico-chemical, physical, rheological and sensory characteristics of nonfat yoghurt in comparison to control samples (full fat and <b>skim</b> <b>yoghurt).</b> By increasing RSM content, the chemical characteristics (titratable acidity, pH as well as the content of fat and total protein) of yoghurts did not alter except decrease of total solid in sample with 50 % RSM. The yoghurts with more content of RSM exhibited higher b*and a* values, while the highest L* value, viscosity, water holding capacity (WHC), firmness and lowest syneresis were found in sample containing 30 % RSM. It seems that new interaction in gel network of yoghurts containing RSM, exhibited greater ability to bind water than control <b>skim</b> <b>yoghurt.</b> In addition, probably new bridges between milk proteins (interacting partially hydrolyzed casein with casein) can increase the number of bounds between protein particles leading to lower syneresis. However, excessive RSM content (higher than 30 %) did not increase the L* value, viscosity and WHC of samples probably because of too much aggregation of casein. Sensory results revealed that sample containing 30 % RSM was exactly alike to full fat yoghurt in terms of overall sensory attributes. New formulation of palatable <b>skim</b> <b>yoghurt</b> was developed using 3 % RSM successfully...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} the {{addition}} of passion fruit peel powder (PFPP) on the fermentation kinetics and texture parameters, post-acidification and bacteria counts of probiotic yoghurts made with two milk types were evaluated during 28 days of storage at 4 °C. Milks were fermented by Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (CY 340), and one strain of probiotic bacteria: Lactobacillus acidophilus (L 10 and NCFM), Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (Bl 04 and HN 019). The addition of PFPP reduced significantly fermentation time of skim milk co-fermented by the strains L 10, NCFM and HN 019. At the end of 28 -day shelf-life, counts of B. lactis Bl 04 were about 1 Log CFU mL– 1 higher in whole yoghurt fermented with PFPP regarding its control but, in general, the addition of PFPP had less influence on counts than the milk type itself. The titratable acidity in yoghurts with PFPP {{was significantly higher than}} in their respective controls, and in <b>skim</b> <b>yoghurts</b> higher than in the whole ones. The PFPP increased firmness, consistency (except for the NCFM strain of L. acidophilus) and cohesiveness of all <b>skim</b> <b>yoghurts.</b> The results point out the suitability of using passion fruit by-product in the formulation of both skim and whole probiotic yoghurts...|$|R

Comparison and the counts of each of E. colt, Staphylococcus ctureus, Streptococcus spp. and Salmonella spp. were estimated in those products. Higher counts were obtained for the factory commercial samples compared with those manufactured as experiment in the factory. Moreover pasteurization of the whole milk revealed lower counts, which could be attributed to elimination of contamination.

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} liquid motion within moving open containers. The {{objective is}} to determine the open-loop acceleration profile for moving the container in minimum time without excessive slosh. This very common problem in the packaging industry has a significant influence on production capacity and quality. Traditionally, motion control problems have been solved with purely mechanical devices. The introduction of modern servo systems to control movement has increased flexibility and it is now possible to vary the acceleration profile depending on the product. Since the fluid dynamics of different products are very different (for example compare <b>skim</b> milk with <b>yoghurt)</b> {{they do not have the}} same optimal acceleration profile. This has lead to an increased interest in systematic methods for calculation of acceleration profiles. Experiments show that slosh exhibits two nonlinear behaviors: amplitude dependent oscillation frequency and asymmetric oscillation. The surface elevation was measured with a infrared laser displacement sensor. A linear second order oscillator was used, which captures the basic behavior, to model the slosh. The acceleration profiles were calculated by solving different optimal control problems both numerically and analytically. The performance of the obtained acceleration strategies were evaluated in experiments. The experiments show that the acceleration profiles calculated by solving a minimum-energy problem gives the best performance. The minimum-time strategies fails due to low model accuracy.

Comparison of chemical constituents (total solids %, total proteins %, fat %, lactose %, ash %, and acidity), and pH were estimated in those products. The total solids %, the total proteins % and the fat % recorded lower means for the control samples, compared to those of the factory for whole milk; yoghurt; mixture; and roub. However, the control samples for mish revealed a higher mean than those pro-duce commercially by the factory. Moreover, the higher values obtained for ash and acidity for skim milk and fermented products, in the control samples, reflected the adulteration done at the factory. Similarly, Lactose revealed higher means for whole milk; skim milk; and mixture for the control samples. While yoghurt; roub; and mish showed a higher mean values for the factory samples. This might be due to the fermentation action by the bacteria. The results indicated that there were significance differences in total solids %, ash %, and lactose % (P < 0. 05) between the dif-ferent groups. Similarly there is significant increase in pH, fat % (P < 0. 001) and acidity (P < 0. 01) between the different groups. However, a non-significance difference was found for the other measurements.

40|$|INTRODUCTION The storage {{conditions}} i. e. temperature, moisture content {{and composition of}} powders, relative humidity, oxygen content, light exposure and packaging materials, have significant influences on probiotic survival as dried powders, and the correct {{storage conditions}} are essential to maintain viable populations of probiotic bacteria. An alternative means to increase the viability of probiotic bacteria is the microgranulation technology where an innovative matrix surrounding the bacteria protects the viable microorganisms. Moisture content and water activity have been long recognized as important for evaluating product stability and predicted shelf-life, especially of dry powders and intermediate moisture solids. In this study different formulations of yoghurt-cream were tested as carrier for probiotic bacteria {{in order to increase}} the shelf-life in new food products (such as biscuits and cakes). The stability of probiotic bacteria in yoghurt-cream formulations was compared with the stability of probiotic bacteria in microgranules. We also established the best method for preparing a new probiotic yoghurt-cream with a view to upgrading production to an industrial scale. MATERIALS AND METHODS Several formulations of yoghurt-cream were prepared in this way: butter or margarine or hydrogenated vegetable oil, dextrose, freeze-dried whole milk <b>yoghurt,</b> <b>skimmed</b> milk powder are mixed well. The two probiotic bacteria, Lactobacillus rhamnosus IMC 501 ® and Lactobacillus paracasei IMC 502 ®, are added as lyophilized powder or microgranules in order to obtain 107 CFU/g of yoghurt-cream. The homogenized yoghurt-creams were distributed in aluminium bags, tightly closed and stored at 25 °C and 4 °C. The viability of the probiotic bacteria mixture was tested at the lab production time and at different time intervals. Viable cell count expressed as CFU/g of mixed L. rhamnosus IMC 501 ® and L. paracasei IMC 502 ® were determined by the standard count method. Colonies randomly selected from each product were subjected to morphological and molecular analysis (RAPD). Water activity (aw), moisture content and pH of ingredients and final yoghurt-creams were measured. At each analysis point a product sensory profile was defined. The same tests were performed on microgranules made of a vegetable fats matrix containing the two probiotic bacteria. RESULTS The stability of the probiotic concentration was excellent at 4 °C for all the formulations. No major changes of the bacterial concentration during time for most formulas of probiotic yoghurt-cream proposed in this study was observed at 25 °C. The products absorb little or no moisture during storage, causing a slight change in aw. The probiotic microgranules however lasted for a long time than lyophilized powder maintaining the bacterial concentration much stable. Total evaluation in term of colour, texture and taste of all samples were good and did not have any marked off-flavour during the storage period. DISCUSSION The study demonstrated that these new formulations of yoghurt-cream used as carriers of probiotic bacteria prolong their shelf-life. The possibility to widen the probiotic consumption producing new food products and to prolong their shelf-life at room temperature represents an important impact on the market of functional foods. The comparison of probiotic stability between yoghurt-cream formulations and microgranules itself gives similar results...|$|R
