Large areas for automobile parking, often in co-located multi-storey car <b>parks,</b> <b>are</b> also typical to find at airports. Some airports provide shuttle services to parking garages for passengers and airport employees. Due to the very large scale of international airports, some have constructed shuttle services to transport passengers between terminals. Such systems operate for example, in Singapore Changi Airport and Zurich Airport.|$|E

5|$|Most Solar <b>parks</b> <b>are</b> ground mounted PV systems, {{also known}} as {{free-field}} solar power plants. They can either be fixed tilt or use a single axis or dual axis solar tracker. While tracking improves the overall performance, it also increases the system's installation and maintenance cost. A solar inverter converts the array's power output from DC to AC, and connection to the utility grid is made through a high voltage, three phase step up transformer of typically 10kV and above.|$|E

5|$|Both {{coastline}} and the Coast Ranges can {{be found}} within park boundaries. The majority of the rocks in the <b>parks</b> <b>are</b> part of the Franciscan Assemblage, uplifted from the ocean floor millions of years ago. These sedimentary rocks are primarily sandstone, siltstone, shale, and chert, with lesser amounts of metamorphic rocks such as greenstone. For the most part, these rocks are easily eroded, and can be viewed along the seacoast and where rivers and streams have cut small gorges. Formed during the Cretaceous Period, they are highly deformed from uplift and folding processes. In some areas, river systems have created fluvial deposits of sand, mud, and gravel, which are transported into the park from upstream. Redwood Creek follows the Grogan Fault; along {{the west bank of}} the creek, schist and other metamorphic rocks {{can be found}}, while sedimentary rocks of the Franciscan Assemblage are located on the east bank.|$|E
5|$|From {{the late}} 1990s, the town {{experienced}} severe flooding problems from the Severn and Rea Brook. In {{the autumn of}} 2000 large swathes of the town were underwater, notably Frankwell, which flooded three times in six weeks. The Frankwell flood defences were completed in 2003, along with the new offices of the borough council. More recently, such as in 2005 and 2007, flooding has been less severe, and the defences have generally held back floodwaters from the town centre areas. However, the town car <b>parks</b> <b>are</b> often left to be flooded in the winter, which reduces trade in the town, most evidenced in the run up to Christmas in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Government {{troops were}} {{stationed}} at Aberdour Castle during the Jacobite Rising of 1715. During their stay, a second fire again caused extensive damage. In 1725, the Mortons bought an adjacent property, Cuttlehill House, which they renamed Aberdour House, and the castle {{ceased to be}} a residence. The east range was again repaired, and was used for various purposes, including a school room, a barracks, and a masonic hall. In 1924 the castle and gardens were placed in state care, and continue to be managed by Historic Scotland as a visitor attraction. The south-east wing was initially restored as a home for the custodian, and now houses a cafe. The castle is protected as a Scheduled Ancient Monument, and the castle, dovecot and walled garden are Category A listed buildings, the highest level of protection for a historic building in Scotland. The grounds, and surrounding former <b>parks,</b> <b>are</b> listed on the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes, the national register of significant gardens.|$|E

5|$|In some countries, the {{nameplate}} {{capacity of a}} photovoltaic power stations is rated in megawatt-peak (MWp), which refers to the solar array's DC power output. However, Canada, Japan, Spain and {{some parts of the}} United States often specify using the converted lower nominal power output in MWAC; a measure directly comparable to other forms of power generation. A third and less common rating is the mega volt-amperes (MVA). Most solar <b>parks</b> <b>are</b> developed at a scale of at least 1MWp. As at the start of 2017, the world's largest operating photovoltaic power station has a capacity of over 800 megawatts and projects up to 1 gigawatt are planned. As at the end of 2016, about 4,300 projects with a combined capacity of 96GWAC were solar farms larger than 4MWAC.|$|E
5|$|It may {{always have}} been thinly spread, {{but there has been}} {{widespread}} deforestation within its range resulting in loss and fragmentation of suitable habitat. The rail has been protected under Indonesian law since 1972, and the large Lore Lindu and Bogani Nani Wartabone National <b>Parks</b> <b>are</b> within its range, but logging and rattan cutting occurs even in these protected areas, and human encroachment is also a problem at Lore Lindu. The rail has been trapped for food in the past, and is sometimes killed by dogs, cats and other introduced predators. A 2007 survey of protected areas of Sulawesi failed to find the rail, suggesting that it is genuinely rare even in reserves.|$|E
