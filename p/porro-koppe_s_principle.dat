One tentative way to prove this would be to remark that Markov 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>principle</b> does not hold in a sheaf model of type theory over Cantor space, since Markov 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>principle</b> does not hold for the generic point of this model. It is however not clear how to interpret the universe in a sheaf model. Instead we design an extension of type theory, which intuitively extends type theory {{by the addition of}} a generic point of Cantor space. We then show the consistency of this extension by a normalization argument. Markov 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>principle</b> does not hold in this extension, and it follows that it cannot be proved in type theory...|$|R

40|$|Background and Aims The {{international}} Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) Expert Alliance initiative (2012 – 2015) {{served as}} a platform to define and support areas of best practice in IBD management to help improve outcomes for all patients with IBD. Methods During the programme IBD specialists {{from around the world}} established by consensus two best practice charters: the 5 <b>S</b> <b>Principles</b> and 5 C Concept. Results The 5 <b>S</b> <b>Principles</b> were conceived to provide healthcare providers with key guidance for improving clinical practice based on best management approaches. They comprise the following categories: Stage the disease; Stratify patients; Set treatment goals; Select appropriate treatment; and Supervise therapy. Optimised management of patients with IBD based on the 5 <b>S</b> <b>Principles</b> can be achieved most effectively within an optimised clinical care environment. Guidance on optimising the clinical care setting in IBD management is provided through the 5 C Concept, which encompasses: Comprehensive IBD Care; Collaboration; Communication; Clinical nurse specialists; and Care Pathways. Together, the 5 C Concept and 5 <b>S</b> <b>Principles</b> provide structured recommendations on organising the clinical care setting and developing best-practice approaches in IBD management. Conclusion Consideration and application of these two dimensions could help healthcare providers optimise their IBD centres, and collaborate more effectively with their multidisciplinary team colleagues and patients, to provide improved IBD care in daily clinical practice. Ultimately, this could lead to improved outcomes for patients with IBD. </p...|$|R
40|$|Le Chatelier 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>principle</b> {{states that}} when a system is disturbed, it will shift its {{equilibrium}} to counteract the disturbance. However for a chemical reaction in a small, confined system, the probability of observing it proceed {{in the opposite direction}} to that predicted by Le Chatelier 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>principle,</b> can be significant. This work gives a molecular level proof of Le Chatelier 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>principle</b> for the case of a temperature change. Moreover, a new, exact mathematical expression is derived that is valid for arbitrary system sizes and gives the relative probability that a single experiment will proceed in the endothermic or exothermic direction, in terms of a microscopic phase function. We show that the average of the time integral of this function is the maximum possible value of the purely irreversible entropy production for the thermal relaxation process. Our result is tested against computer simulations of the unfolding of a polypeptide. We prove that any equilibrium reaction mixture on average responds to a temperature increase by shifting its point of equilibrium in the endothermic direction...|$|R
40|$|First, we {{reconstruct}} Wim Veldman 2 ̆ 7 s {{result that}} Open Induction on Cantor space {{can be derived}} from Double-negation Shift and Markov 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Principle.</b> In doing this, we notice that one has to use a countable choice axiom in the proof and that Markov 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Principle</b> is replaceable by slightly strengthening the Double-negation Shift schema. We show that this strengthened version of Double-negation Shift can nonetheless be derived in a constructive intermediate logic based on delimited control operators, extended with axioms for higher-type Heyting Arithmetic. We formalize the argument and thus obtain a proof term that directly derives Open Induction on Cantor space by the shift and reset delimited control operators of Danvy and Filinski...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{outstanding}} jurists of our time, Justice Benjamin Cardozo, articulated a principle spanning the 2 ̆ 2 seamless web 2 ̆ 2 of the law which, unfortunately, has been obscured by the attempts of courts, casebook writers, and law professors to pigeonhole the principle into familiar categories. Justice Cardozo established the principle {{that a person who}} undertakes a task is liable for injury to remote third parties, regardless of lack of privity, which arises from the person 2 ̆ 7 s negligent performance of the task. Cardozo also enunciated an exception to this rule which developed into a widely accepted opposing rule. This Article first traces the origin of Cardozo 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>principle</b> and the opposing rule. Next, it examines the attempts by courts and casebook writers to categorize those cases which are properly governed by Cardozo 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>principle</b> under various familiar legal categories. This Article next concludes that these attempted classifications are erroneous and obscure the applicability of the principle in numerous areas of the law, and that arguments against applying the principle are unpersuasive. Finally, this Article demonstrates how Cardozo 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>principle</b> has been applied in cases directly or indirectly within the real property law category and concludes that courts should continue to recognize and extend application of the principle to all areas of the law...|$|R

40|$|In {{this work}} an extremal {{principle}} driving the far from equilibrium {{evolution of a}} system of structureless particles is derived by using the stochastic quantum hydrodynamic analogy. For a classical phase (i. e., the quantum correlations decay on a distance smaller than the mean inter-molecular distance) the far from equilibrium kinetic equation can be cast {{in the form of a}} Fokker-Plank equation whose phase space velocity vector maximizes the dissipation of the energy-type function, named here, stochastic free energy. Near equilibrium the maximum stochastic free energy dissipation is shown to be compatible with the Prigogine <b>s</b> <b>principle</b> of minimum entropy production. Moreover, in the case of elastic molecular collisions and in absence of chemical reactions, in quasi-isothermal far from equilibrium states, the theory shows that the maximum stochastic free energy dissipation reduces to the maximum free energy dissipation. Following the tendency to reach the highest rate of stochastic free energy dissipation, the system transition to states with higher free energy can happen. Given that in incompressible ordinary fluids such an increase of free energy is almost given by a decrease of entropy, the matter self-organization becomes possible. When chemical reactions or relevant thermal gradients are present, the theory highlights that the Sawada enunciation of maximum free energy dissipation can be violated. The proposed model depicts the Prigogine <b>s</b> <b>principle</b> of minimum entropy production near-equilibrium and the far from equilibrium Sawada <b>s</b> <b>principle</b> of maximum energy dissipation as two complementary principia of a unique theory where the latter one is a particular case of the more general one of maximum stochastic free energy dissipation.
