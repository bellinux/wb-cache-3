40|$|Prices for {{commodities}} such as {{minerals and}} metals have increased significantly {{over the past few}} years. At the same time, there has also been an increase in restrictions on the <b>export</b> <b>of</b> raw materials which has led policy makers and business people to address free trade of raw materials. This paper provides information on the present situation regarding the use <b>of</b> <b>export</b> restrictions and international disciplines on these measures. Export restrictions are maintained to achieve diverse policy objectives, including environmental protection or conservation of natural resources, promotion of downstream processing industries, controlling inflationary pressures, and for fiscal receipts reasons. Export restrictions take various forms such as export duties, quantitative restrictions, and licensing requirements. The number <b>of</b> countries applying <b>export</b> duties over the period 2003 - 2009 was higher than in previous years and that such duties were introduced primarily by developing and least developed countries. Under the current WTO rules, unlike quantitative export restrictions which are in principle prohibited, there is no substantive discipline on export duties, although there have been efforts to revise this at the multilateral and bilateral levels. The WTO accession process imposes several disciplines. Export restrictions have also been discussed during the DDA negotiations in both NAMA (Non-Agricultural Market Access) and agriculture negotiations. Several regional trade agreements (RTAs) went beyond the WTO by including <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> <b>export</b> duties. Export restrictions, by creating a differential between the price available to domestic processors and the price charged to foreign processors, provide domestic processing industries with an advantage. Although several governments apply export restrictions to achieve diverse policy objectives, not all rely on such restrictions. Alternative policy options with different trade impacts are used. In view of the significant impacts <b>of</b> <b>export</b> restrictions on global supply chains, transparency on the use and implementation of such measures should be substantially improved. transparency, quantitative restrictions, accession, export licensing, food security, conservation of natural resources, subsidy, raw materials, terms-of-trade, fiscal receipts, trade policy review, Doha Development Agenda, regional trade agreements, export restrictions, export duties, social objectives, tariff escalation, non-agricultural market access, WTO disciplines...|$|R

The purpose of this dissertation is to determine the role of protectionism in English Mercantilist writings from the reign of Elizabeth I to Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations. Mercantilist writers are evaluated {{on the basis of the}} logical consistency of their arguments and according to the following definition of protectionism provided by Joseph Schumpeter in 1954 and Jacob Viner in 1937 : (1) the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> the <b>export</b> <b>of</b> bullion, (2) the protection of domestic (infant) industries, (3) the protection of military or vital national industries, and (4) a restriction of imports. Free trade is viewed as the absence of these conditions. The most important category is the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> the <b>export</b> <b>of</b> bullion. Preference for such a policy would evidence de facto protectionism, regardless of whether or not the other categories were satisfied. The importance of the study lies in its examination of Mercantilist writings in the context of contemporaneous economic events and regnal periods. A process of textual exegesis was applied in order to find evidence of protectionism, and to gain an improved intellectual understanding of Mercantilist thought. The characterization of English Mercantilism as protectionist may be inappropriate or inadequate. The study is organized into the following periods: early Mercantilism, the advent of the balance of trade doctrine, politics and the balance of trade, free trade and protection, the development of the specie flow mechanism, and Adam Smith's evaluation of Mercantilism. The major conclusion is that protectionism was not consistently viewed as the primary requirement to achieve a favorable balance of trade, although the balance of trade was an integral part of the analysis and policy of the period. Writers were not consistently successful in influencing economic policy. Adam Smith's evaluation of Mercantilism, however, was influential but was oversimplified. Finally, Viner's power and plenty characterization in 1942 of Mercantilism is correct...|$|R

The paper examines the relationship between trade policy {{and the number of}} firms in the third-country model, with some additional investigations that are not dealt with in their seminal paper. First, the exogenous simultaneous-move game of the decision on trade policy by the exporting countries is discussed, before analyzing the endogenous timing of trade policy. The calculating results on strategic trade policy are presented and trade intervention is compared with free trade. It is shown that when the difference in the number of firms in two exporting countries is sufficiently large, the stability of the equilibrium is not satis-fied. Second, the endogenous timing is analyzed and some additional results are presented. The endogenous sequential decision on trade policy is compared with the simultaneous one.

It probably was not clear to them, however, that the <b>export</b> <b>of</b> bullion to the East was advantageous, because the commodities brought back in return were more valuable in England than the precious metals. The purpose of the mercantilists was {{to increase the amount of}} gold and silver in the country. Mun, with some penetration, had even pointed out that too much money was an evil; but in 1663 the English Parliament removed the restriction on the exportation of coin. The balance-of-trade heresy, that exports should always exceed imports (as if merchants would send out goods which, when paid for in commodities, should be returned in a form of less value than those sent out!), was the outcome of the mercantile system, and it has continued in the minds of many men to this day. The policy which aimed at securing a favorable balance of trade, and the plan of protecting home industries, had the same origin. If all consumable goods were produced at home, and none imported, that would increase exports, and bring more gold and silver into the country. As all the countries of Europe had adopted the mercantile theory after 1664, retaliatory and prohibitory tariffs were set up against each other by England, France, Holland, and Germany. Then, because it was seen that large sums were paid for carrying goods, in order that no coin should be required to pay foreigners in any branch of industry, navigation laws were enacted, which required goods to be imported only in ships belonging to the importing nation. These remnants of the mercantile system continue to this day in the shipping laws of this and other countries.(12) ...|$|R
