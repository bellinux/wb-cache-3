25|$|By {{the terms}} of this agreement, the federal {{government}} would provide $1 billion in grants, $1.66 billion in loan guarantees, and other assistance to the $5.8 billion development.

Potentially, these factors would make the field uneconomic.|$|E

25|$|The {{two former}} Canadian {{offshore}} icebreakers were deployed {{together at the}} Vityaz Production Complex during {{the first phase of}} the Sakhalin-2 project in the seasonally frozen Sea of Okhotsk. In addition to providing year-round supply services for the Piltun-Astokhskoye-A platform (the former Molikpaq), they served as ice management and standby vessels for the floating storage and offloading (FSO) vessel Okha and its single anchor leg mooring (SALM) buoy. The icebreakers were used to assist the raising and lowering of the SALM buoy and the beginning and end of the production season, and to support loading operations together with other icebreaking vessels until the ice conditions became too severe. In 2006, the management of Smit Sakhalin was transferred to FEMCO Management and she was converted to dedicated stand-by vessel at Keppel Tuas shipyard in Singapore. She continued in this role after the ice management operations at Vityaz Production Complex ended when the <b>production</b> <b>platform</b> was connected to a subsea pipeline in 2008. Her management was returned to Smit in 2013.|$|E

2500|$|The {{general layout}} of the initial <b>production</b> <b>platform</b> is {{considered}} {{by some to be}} a plug-in series hybrid design (since mechanical power initially drives the generator, which in turn charges the battery pack), despite its transmission design that makes it, by definition, a parallel hybrid. Power is drained from the batteries to run the electrical motors which move the vehicle. The internal combustion engine can run at a constant speed for both optimal efficiency and mechanical simplicity (i.e., {{there is no need for}} variable cam phasing). [...] The Voltec, like the Prius, uses a planetary gearset to couple power from two sources to the wheels. Unlike the Prius, the Voltec only rarely drives the wheels with mechanical assist from the engine, and only when battery charge is depleted. The Voltec could therefore be considered a power-split hybrid.|$|E
