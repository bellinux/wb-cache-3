40|$|Skin Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) is {{a method}} that {{involves}} the injection of an AC current into human tissue and measurement of the resulting voltage drop. By measuring the tissue over a range of frequencies, the impedance spectrum can then be used to detect changes in the underlying nature of the skin tissue. One potential application is in monitoring the effects of over the counter products such as skin moisturisers on human skin.

A low cost, portable, custom-made bio-impedance analyser based on a four-point <b>probe</b> <b>sensor</b> has been constructed for measuring the skin impedance over short and long time periods.

40|$|Soil {{moisture}} content and dry density of unbound granular pavement materials are important properties for compaction control that influence pavement performance under cyclic loading. Under these loading conditions, increasing {{moisture content}} can accelerate {{significant changes in}} density. Time domain reflectometry (TDR) is a method for measuring the moisture content and density of soils with rod <b>probe</b> <b>sensors.</b> This paper introduces new calibration functions for TDR measurements using these rod <b>probe</b> <b>sensors</b> embedded in the soil. TDR measurements were taken in the laboratory for a typical road base material at two basically different conditions: at constant moisture content with different dry densities and at constant dry density with different moisture contents. In this study, a relationship was developed between the voltage drop occurring for the passage of an electromagnetic wave through the soil and the bulk density. The permittivity of the soil sample obtained from the travel time of TDR signals was {{used to calculate the}} volumetric moisture content. Finally, the gravimetric moisture content was obtained from the volumetric moisture content and bulk density relationship. For the validation of the calibration functions, rod <b>probe</b> <b>sensors</b> were installed in a road to obtain in situ moisture content and density under field conditions. Laboratory results indicate that the calibration functions are independent of moisture and density, and the field test shows the applicability of the method.
