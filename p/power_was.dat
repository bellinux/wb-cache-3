5|$|The CAB {{carried out}} flight tests using a DC-6. They {{found that if}} the {{propellers}} were reversed prior to take-off they would not, if the flag was not raised, be rotated automatically again {{in the air to}} produce forward thrust if full <b>power</b> <b>was</b> applied. Tests performed by United Airlines showed that, if the propellers of just one engine were reversed and full <b>power</b> <b>was</b> applied to all four engines, then the aircraft would spiral into a dive. If METO (maximum except take-off) <b>power</b> <b>was</b> applied to Nos. 1, 2 and 3 engines, and full reverse thrust was applied to engine No. 4, then the aircraft would become uncontrollable.|$|E

5|$|A {{water mill}} and Mill Hill were {{mentioned}} in a grant in 1544. Water <b>power</b> <b>was</b> in general use in Rivington and many houses including the hall had water-mills. The {{one at the}} hall was once used to churn butter. The foundations of {{what could have been}} a mill opposite Mill Hill Cottages on Rivington Lane, mill ponds, and a smithy were shown on the 1848 first edition Ordnance Survey map.

5|$|At {{the start}} of Justinian I's reign he had {{inherited}} a surplus 28,800,000 solidi (400,000 pounds of gold) in the imperial treasury from Anastasius I and Justin I. Under Justinian's rule, measures were taken to counter corruption in the provinces and to make tax collection more efficient. Greater administrative <b>power</b> <b>was</b> given to both {{the leaders of the}} prefectures and of the provinces, while <b>power</b> <b>was</b> taken away from the vicariates of the dioceses, of which a number were abolished. The overall trend was towards a simplification of administrative infrastructure. According to Brown (1971), the increased professionalization of tax collection did much to destroy the traditional structures of provincial life, as it weakened the autonomy of the town councils in the Greek towns. It has been estimated that before Justinian I's reconquests the state had an annual revenue of 5,000,000 solidi in AD 530, but after his reconquests, the annual revenue was increased to 6,000,000 solidi in AD 550.|$|E

In September 1971, Amri resigned after murdering a photographer in San'a, and more <b>power</b> <b>was</b> given to Iryani, the effective President. By then, the royalists were integrated into the new republic, except for al-Badr's family, and a consultative Council was established. Clashes along {{the border between the}} states rose, and in 1972 a small war broke.|$|E
5|$|By September18, power {{services}} {{had been}} {{restored to the}} state of Guerrero. That day, gas and water services were revived in Acapulco. Emergency declarations were requested in Angostura and Navolato. Within 12hours after its second landfall, <b>power</b> <b>was</b> retrieved to 26,000 dwellings in Sinaloa. In La Pintada, the search process for victims was halted briefly due to the threat of another mudslide, but on September20, 100rescuers resumed searching, who frequently had to dig through mud to recover bodies.|$|E
5|$|By the 1980s, Suharto's grip on <b>power</b> <b>was</b> {{maintained}} by the emasculation of civil society, engineered elections, {{and use of the}} military's coercive powers. Upon his retirement from the military in June 1976, Suharto undertook a re-organisation of the armed forces that concentrated power away from commanders to the president. In March 1983, he appointed General Leonardus Benjamin Moerdani as head of the armed forces who adopted a hardline on elements who challenged the administration. As a Roman Catholic, he was not a political threat to Suharto.|$|E

Due to the shortages, electric <b>power</b> <b>was</b> transferred there from other surrounding areas. Furthermore, a 50percent decrease in electricity output was documented at the local power station in Luchegorsk. To the south, an overflowing of the Kazachka River prompted the evacuation of over 60people. Overall, 55automobile accidents occurred in eastern Russia, leading to nine fatalities and 76people injured.|$|E
5|$|Devolution {{continued}} {{to be part of}} the platform of the Labour Party which, in May 1997, took power under Tony Blair. In September 1997, the 1997 Scottish devolution referendum was put to the Scottish electorate and secured a majority in favour of the establishment of a new devolved Scottish Parliament, with tax-varying powers, in Edinburgh. An election was held on 6 May 1999, and on 1 July of that year <b>power</b> <b>was</b> transferred from Westminster to the new Parliament.|$|E
