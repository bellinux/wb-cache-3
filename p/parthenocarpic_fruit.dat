MPs (3 -alkyl- 2 -methoxypyrazines) are grape-derived aroma {{compounds}} {{that are associated}} with detrimental herbaceous flavours in some wines. It is well known that several viticultural and environmental parameters can modulate MP concentrations in grapes, although comprehensive molecular studies have not been conducted in this field. Although the biosynthesis pathway of MPs has not been fully elucidated, four Vitis vinifera 0 -methyltransferase genes (VvOMT 1 - 4) have been related to be involved in MP biosynthesis. We assessed whether different abiotic stresses induction have an impact on MP levels in grapes and wines from seeded and <b>parthenocarpic</b> <b>fruits.</b> Our results show that the timing of VvOMT 3 expression is associated with the period of MPs accumulation in seeded fruits during both abiotic stresses, whereas no association was found in <b>parthenocarpic</b> <b>fruits.</b> These results are discussed in the context of how different viticultural practices can modulate VvOMT gene expression, which has a direct impact on MPs levels in wines.

40|$|Abstract Background Parthenocarpic tomato lines {{transgenic}} for the DefH 9 -RI-iaaM gene {{have been}} cultivated under open field conditions {{to address some}} aspects of the equivalence of genetically modified (GM) fruit in comparison to controls (non-GM). Results Under open field cultivation conditions, two tomato lines (UC 82) transgenic for the DefH 9 -RI-iaaM gene produced <b>parthenocarpic</b> <b>fruits.</b> DefH 9 -RI-iaaM fruits were either seedless or contained very few seeds. GM fruit quality, {{with the exception of a}} higher β-carotene level, did not show any difference, neither technological (colour, firmness, dry matter, °Brix, pH) nor chemical (titratable acidity, organic acids, lycopene, tomatine, total polyphenols and antioxidant capacity – TEAC), when compared to that of fruits from control line. Highly significant differences in quality traits exist between the tomato F 1 commercial hybrid Allflesh and the three UC 82 genotypes tested, regardless of whether or not they are GM. Total yield per plant did not differ between GM and parental line UC 82. Fruit number was increased in GM lines, and GM fruit weight was decreased. Conclusion The use in the diet of fruits from a new line or variety introduces much greater changes than the consumption of GM fruits in comparison to its genetic background. <b>Parthenocarpic</b> <b>fruits,</b> produced under open field conditions, contained 10 -fold less seeds than control fruits.

40|$|Parthenocarpy is {{potentially}} a desirable trait for many commercially grown fruits if undesirable changes to structure, flavour, or nutrition can be avoided. Parthenocarpic transgenic tomato plants (cv MicroTom) {{were obtained by}} the regulation of genes for auxin synthesis (iaaM) or responsiveness (rolB) driven by DefH 9 or the INNER NO OUTER (INO) promoter from Arabidopsis thaliana. Fruits at a breaker stage were analysed at a transcriptomic and metabolomic level using microarrays, real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and a Pegasus III TOF (time of flight) mass spectrometer. Although differences were observed {{in the shape of}} fully ripe fruits, no clear correlation could be made between the number of seeds, transgene, and fruit size. Expression of auxin synthesis or responsiveness genes by both of these promoters produced seedless <b>parthenocarpic</b> <b>fruits.</b> Eighty-three percent of the genes measured showed no significant differences in expression due to parthenocarpy. The remaining 17 % with significant variation (P[*]< 0. 05) (1748 genes) were studied by assigning a predicted function (when known) based on BLAST to the TAIR database. Among them several genes belong to cell wall, hormone metabolism and response (auxin in particular), and metabolism of sugars and lipids. Up-regulation of lipid transfer proteins and differential expression of several indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA) - and ethylene-associated genes were observed in transgenic <b>parthenocarpic</b> <b>fruits.</b> Despite differences in several fatty acids, amino acids, and other metabolites, the fundamental metabolic profile remains unchanged.

40|$|Fruit {{development}} in higher plants normally requires pollination and fertilization to stimulate cell division of specific floral tissues. In some cases, <b>parthenocarpic</b> <b>fruit</b> development proceeds without either pollination or fertilization. <b>Parthenocarpic</b> <b>fruit</b> without seed has higher commercial value than seeded fruit. Several apple (Malus domestica) mutants (Rae Ime, Spencer Seedless and Wellington Bloomless) {{are known to}} produce only apetalous flowers that readily go on to develop into <b>parthenocarpic</b> <b>fruit.</b> Through genetics, a single recessive gene has been identified to control this trait in apple. Flower phenotypes of these apple mutants are strikingly {{similar to those of}} the Arabidopsis mutant pistillata (pi), which produces flowers where petals are transformed to sepals and stamens to carpels. In this study, we have cloned the apple PI homolog (MdPI) that shows 64 % amino acid sequence identity and closely conserved intron positions and mRNA expression patterns to the Arabidopsis PI. We have identified that in the apetalous mutants MdPI has been mutated by a retrotransposon insertion in intron 4 in the case of Rae Ime and in intron 6 in the case of Spencer Seedless and Wellington Bloomless. The insertion apparently abolishes the normal expression of the MdPI gene.

40|$|Abstract Background Genetic {{engineering}} of parthenocarpy confers to horticultural plants {{the ability}} to produce fruits under environmental conditions that curtail fruit productivity and quality. The DefH 9 -iaaM transgene, whose predicted action is to confer auxin synthesis specifically in the placenta, ovules and derived tissues, {{has been shown to}} confer parthenocarpy to several plant species (tobacco, eggplant, tomato) and varieties. Results UC 82 tomato plants, a typical cultivar used by the processing industry, transgenic for the DefH 9 -iaaM gene produce <b>parthenocarpic</b> <b>fruits</b> that are malformed. UC 82 plants transgenic for the DefH 9 -RI-iaaM, a DefH 9 -iaaM derivative gene modified in its 5 'ULR by replacing 53 nucleotides immediately upstream of the AUG initiation codon with an 87 nucleotides-long sequence derived from the rolA intron sequence, produce <b>parthenocarpic</b> <b>fruits</b> of high quality. In an in vitro translation system, the iaaM mRNA, modified in its 5 'ULR is translated 3 – 4 times less efficiently than the original transcript. An optimal expressivity of parthenocarpy correlates with a reduced transgene mRNA steady state level in DefH 9 -RI-iaaM flower buds in comparison to DefH 9 -iaaM flower buds. Consistent with the known function of the iaaM gene, flower buds transgenic for the DefH 9 -RI-iaaM gene contain ten times more IAA than control untransformed flower buds, but five times less than DefH 9 -iaaM flower buds. Conclusions By using an auxin biosynthesis transgene downregulated at the post-transcriptional level, an optimal expressivity of parthenocarpy has been achieved in a genetic background not suitable for the original transgene. Thus, the method allows the generation of a wider range of expressivity of the desired trait in transgenic plants. </p...|$|R

Explants {{consisted of a}} segment of stem and an emasculated flower {{with or without the}} adjacent leaf. They were made on the day equivalent to anthesis and were cultured in a liquid medium. Growth regulators were applied either in the solution or directly to the ovaries. Giberellic acid (GA 3) in the presence of sucrose, but not indole- 3 -acetic acid or N 6 -(Δ 2 -isopentenyl) -adenine (2 iP), induced fruit set and development of <b>parthenocarpic</b> <b>fruits,</b> the final length of these being a function of the intensity of the GA 3 treatment. The capacity of ovaries to respond fully to GA 3 was not lost after incubation of explants in water or 50 mM sucrose for 1 day and was similar in explants made between the day of anthesis and 3 days later. Limited growth was obtained with 100 mM sucrose alone but this effect was counteracted by 2 ′-isopropyl- 4 ′-(trimethyl ammonium chloride) - 5 ′-methylphenyl piperidine- 1 -carboxylate (AMO- 1618). This inhibitor was ineffective when GA 3 was applied to the ovary. The development of the fruit was proportional to the length of the segment of stem up to 5 cm. The presence of the leaf in the explant enhanced the development of the fruit. These results indicate that a gibberellin is necessary for setting and development of fruits from cultured ovaries and that this effect depends on an appropriate source of nutrients.

40|$|Fruit set is a {{key process}} for crop {{production}} in tomato which occurs after successful pollination and fertilization naturally. However, <b>parthenocarpic</b> <b>fruit</b> development can be uncoupled from fertilization triggered by exogenous auxin or gibberellins (GAs). Global transcriptome knowledge during fruit initiation would help to characterize the molecular mechanisms by which these two hormones regulate pollination-dependent and -independent fruit set. In this work, digital gene expression tag profiling (DGE) technology was applied to compare the transcriptomes from pollinated and 2, 4 -D/GA 3 -treated ovaries. Activation of carbohydrate metabolism, cell division and expansion {{as well as the}} down-regulation of MADS-box is a comprehensive regulatory pathway during pollination-dependent and <b>parthenocarpic</b> <b>fruit</b> set. The signaling cascades of auxin and GA are significantly modulated. The feedback regulations of Aux/IAAs and DELLA genes which functioned to fine-tune auxin and GA response respectively play fundamental roles in triggering fruit initiation. In addition, auxin regulates GA synthesis via up-regulation of GA 20 ox 1 and down-regulation of KNOX. Accordingly, the effect of auxin on fruit set is mediated by GA via ARF 2 and IAA 9 down-regulation, suggesting that both pollination-dependent and <b>parthenocarpic</b> <b>fruit</b> set depend on the crosstalk between auxin and GA.

This paper presents a more detailed analysis of these transgenic lines. Gene expression analysis of auxin-responsive genes show that SlARF 7 may regulate only part of the auxin signalling pathway involved in tomato fruit set and development. Also, part of the GA signalling pathway was affected by the reduced levels of SlARF 7 mRNA, as morphological and molecular analyses display similarities between GA-induced fruits and fruits formed by the RNAi SlARF 7 lines.

40|$|Parthenocarpy, the {{formation}} of seedless fruits {{in the absence of}} functional fertilization, is a desirable trait for several important crop plants, including tomato (Solanum lycopersicum). Seedless fruits can be of great value for consumers, the processing industry, and breeding companies. In this article, we propose a novel strategy to obtain parthenocarpic tomatoes by down-regulation of the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway using RNA interference (RNAi) -mediated suppression of chalcone synthase (CHS), the first gene in the flavonoid pathway. In CHS RNAi plants, total flavonoid levels, transcript levels of both Chs 1 and Chs 2, as well as CHS enzyme activity were reduced by up to a few percent of the corresponding wild-type values. Surprisingly, all strong Chs-silenced tomato lines developed parthenocarpic fruits. Although a relation between flavonoids and <b>parthenocarpic</b> <b>fruit</b> development has never been described, {{it is well known that}} flavonoids are essential for pollen development and pollen tube growth and, hence, play an essential role in plant reproduction.

40|$|Fruit {{initiation}} in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) {{is generally}} repressed until fertilization occurs. However, mutations in AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 8 (ARF 8) uncouple fruit initiation from fertilization, {{resulting in the}} formation of seedless, <b>parthenocarpic</b> <b>fruit.</b> Here we induced parthenocarpy in wild-type Arabidopsis by introducing either the mutant genomic (g) Atarf 8 - 4 sequence or gAtARF 8 :β-glucuronidase translational fusion constructs by plant transformation. Silencing of endogenous AtARF 8 transcription was not observed, indicating that the introduced, aberrant ARF 8 transcripts were compromising the function of endogenous ARF 8 and/or associated factors involved in suppressing fruit initiation. To analyze the role of ARF 8 in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) we initially emasculated 23 tomato cultivars to test for background parthenocarpy. Surprisingly, all had a predisposition to initiate fertilization-independent fruit growth. Expression of gAtarf 8 - 4 in transgenic tomato (‘Monalbo’) resulted in {{a significant increase in the}} number and size of <b>parthenocarpic</b> <b>fruit.</b> Isolation of tomato ARF 8 cDNA indicated significant sequence conservation with AtARF 8. SlARF 8 may therefore control tomato fruit initiation in a similar manner as AtARF 8 does in Arabidopsis. Two SlARF 8 cDNAs differing in size by 5 bp were found, both arising from the same gene. The smaller cDNA is a splice variant and is also present in Arabidopsis. We propose that low endogenous levels of the splice variant products might interfere with efficient formation/function of a complex repressing fruit initiation, thereby providing an explanation for the observed ovary expansion in tomato and also Arabidopsis after emasculation. Increasing the levels of aberrant Atarf 8 - 4 transcripts may further destabilize formation/function of the complex in a dosage-dependent manner enhancing tomato <b>parthenocarpic</b> <b>fruit</b> initiation frequency and size and mimicking the parthenocarpic dehiscent silique phenotype found in homozygous Atarf 8 - 4 mutants.

40|$|International audienceParthenocarpy is {{a desired}} trait in fruit crops; it enables fruit set under {{environmental}} conditions suboptimal for pollination, and seedless fruits represent a valuable consumer product. We employed TILLING-based screening of a mutant tomato population to find genetic lesions in Aux/IAA 9, a negative regulator of the auxin response {{involved in the}} control of fruit set. We identified three mutations located in the coding region of this gene, including two singlebase substitutions and one single-base deletion, {{which leads to a}} frame shift and premature stop codon. The transcription of IAA 9 was strongly reduced in the frame-shift mutant, and partial loss of mutated protein activity was evidenced by an in vitro transactivation assay. Whereas missense mutations were predicted to be tolerated and did not cause mutant phenotypes, the frame-shift mutation-induced phenotypes expected for a loss of IAA 9 function, including altered axillary shoot growth, reduced leaf compoundness and a strong tendency to produce <b>parthenocarpic</b> <b>fruits.</b> Mutant flowers showed pleiotropic anther cone defects, a phenotype frequently associated with parthenocarpy in tomato and other species. Mutant fruits were larger than those of the seeded control, with higher bri...|$|R
40|$|It {{was found}} that the {{application}} of 25 ml of morphactin IT 3456 solution in 0. 25; 0. 5 and 1 ppm concentrations into 4. 8 kg of soil (air dry matter) caused an increase of the total number and weight of fruits in the 'New Yorker' tomato variety. In contrast, a higher dose (50 ml) of the morphactin solution in 5 ppm concentration applied into 4. 7 kg of soil (air dry matter) caused a considerable decrease of the number and weight of all fruits, the deformation of fruits and the seasonal blight of plants as well. Morphactin IT 3456 applied into 7. 2 kg of pure sand (air dry matter) in 50 ml of the solution in 1 ppm concentration caused much more damage of the plants than observed in the plants grown in the soil treated with the IT 3456 solution in four smaller concentrations. When 50 ml of morphactin IT 3456 solution in 5 ppm (soil) and 1 ppm (sand) concentration was used, from 74. 2 to 100 % of parthenocarpy was found. In the remaining combinations development of <b>parthenocarpic</b> <b>fruits</b> was observed sporadically...|$|R
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted with}} a view to find out the possibility of inducing <b>parthenocarpic</b> <b>fruit</b> in teasle gourd (kakrol, Momodrica dioica Roxb.). The {{experiment was}} laid out at BSMRAU, Gazipur, Bangladesh during summer season of 2001 and 2002. Seven plant growth regulators (PGR 2 ̆ 7 s) viz. auxins (NAA: naphthaleneacetic acid and 2, 4 -D: 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid), cytokinins (CPPU: N-(2 -chloro- 4 pyridyl) -N 2 ̆ 7 phenyl urea, Fulmet: forchlorophenuron), gibberellin (GA 3 : gibberellin A 3) and auxin transport inhibitors (TIBA: 2, 3, 5 -triiodobenzoic acid and MH: maleic hydrazide) with three concentrations (25, 50 and 100 ppm) were sprayed at three times (a day before, at and a day after anthesis) with split-split plot design. Out of seven, only three PGR 2 ̆ 7 s (2, 4 -D, Fulmet and CPPU) were effective to <b>parthenocarpic</b> <b>fruit</b> development. Fruit size and weight increased with increase of concentration of PGR 2 ̆ 7 s except 2, 4 -D. Induced parthenocarpic fruits had no seeds. Control treatments (water spray) produced no fruits. The results revealed the possibility of developing parthenocarpy or seedless fruit using PGR 2 ̆ 7 s in teasle gourd...|$|E
40|$|We have {{characterized}} the tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) MADS box gene TM 29 that shared a high {{amino acid sequence}} homology to the Arabidopsis SEP 1, 2, and 3 (SEPALLATA 1, 2, and 3) genes. TM 29 showed similar expression profiles to SEP 1, with accumulation of mRNA in the primordia of all four whorls of floral organs. In addition, TM 29 mRNA was detected in inflorescence and vegetative meristems. To understand TM 29 function, we produced transgenic tomato plants in which TM 29 expression was down-regulated by either cosuppression or antisense techniques. These transgenic plants produced aberrant flowers with morphogenetic alterations in the organs of the inner three whorls. Petals and stamens were green rather than yellow, suggesting a partial conversion to a sepalloid identity. Stamens and ovaries were infertile, with the later developing into <b>parthenocarpic</b> <b>fruit.</b> Ectopic shoots with partially developed leaves and secondary flowers emerged from the fruit. These shoots resembled the primary transgenic flowers and continued to produce <b>parthenocarpic</b> <b>fruit</b> and additional ectopic shoots. Based on the temporal and spatial expression pattern and transgenic phenotypes, we propose that TM 29 functions in floral organ development, fruit development, and maintenance of floral meristem identity in tomato...|$|E
40|$|Inheritance of {{parthenocarpy}} in cucumber {{was controlled}} by a single dominant gene expressing incomplete dominance. A genetic factor for parthenocarpy was associated with high content of indoleacetic acid (IAA) in the ovary; content of IAA in unpollinated ovaries was higher in genetically parthenocarpic ‘Pandex’ than in non-parthenocarpic ‘Khira’. Pollination or 4 -chlorophenoxyacetic acid (4 -CPA) treatment caused an increase of IAA content in both the cultivars and their F,, whereas there seemed no relationship between abscisic acid (ABA) content and <b>parthenocarpic</b> <b>fruit</b> set...|$|E
40|$|Arginase (EC 3. 5. 3. 1) {{activity}} {{has been found}} in the ovaries and Young fruits of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill. cv Rutgers). Changes in arginase, arginine decarboxylase (EC 4. 1. 1. 19), and ornithine decarboxylase activity (EC 4. 1. 1. 17) and levels of free and conjugated putrescine, spermidine, and spermine were determined in unpollinated ovaries and in <b>parthenocarpic</b> <b>fruits</b> during the early stages of development induced by 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4 -D) or gibberellic acid (GA 3). Levels of arginase, free spermine, and conjugates of the three polyamines were constant in unpollinated ovaries and characteristic of a presenescent step. A marked decrease in arginase activity, free spermine, and polyamine conjugates was associated with the initiation of fruit growth due to cell division, and when cell expansion was initiated, the absence of arginase indicated a redirection of nitrogen metabolism to the synthesis of arginine. A transient increase in arginine decarboxylase and ornithine decarboxylase was also observed in 2, 4 -D-induced fruits. In general, 2, 4 -D treatments produced faster changes than GA 3, and without treatment, unpollinated ovaries developed only slightly and senescence was hardly visible. Sensitivity to 2, 4 -D and GA 3 treatment remained for at least 2 weeks postanthesis...|$|R
40|$|The wide genetic {{variation}} {{among the different}} species belonging to the genus Actinidia provides the opportunity for developing new cultivars {{in order to increase}} the kiwifruit world market variability, which has been limited to few types. The main expected characteristics for new cultivars are the improvement of fruit quality characteristics, abiotic and biotic stress tolerance, regulation of fruit ripening, the production of hermaphrodite plants, <b>parthenocarpic</b> <b>fruits,</b> and the alteration of vegetative habit. Genetic improvement programs are focused on modifying the expression of the endogenous genes, or on transferring foreign genes through both direct and indirect gene transfer methods. Efficient in vitro regeneration systems are indispensable for the recovery of transgenic plants. Optimal results have been obtained in three species of the Actinidia genus because kiwifruit has demonstrated relative amenability to in vitro multiplication; protoplast culture, somatic hybridization, embryo rescue, and the creation of dihaploids lines have also been developed as methods for genetic improvement. Transgenic plants of A. deliciosa have been recovered with some foreign genes of interest: rolABC, rolB, whole T-DNA, osmotin, human epidermal growth factor, soybean - 1, 3 -endoglucanase, and OSH 1. Some of these transgenic plants are under field evaluation for biotic stress resistance and growth habit. L'articolo è disponibile sul sito dell'editore [URL]...|$|R
40|$|The PIN-FORMED (PIN) auxin efflux {{transport}} protein {{family has been}} well characterized in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, where these proteins are crucial for auxin regulation of various aspects of plant development. Recent evidence indicates that PIN proteins {{may play a role}} in fruit set and early fruit development in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), but functional analyses of PIN-silenced plants failed to corroborate this hypothesis. Here it is demonstrated that silencing specifically the tomato SlPIN 4 gene, which is predominantly expressed in tomato flower bud and young developing <b>fruit,</b> leads to <b>parthenocarpic</b> <b>fruits</b> due to precocious fruit development before fertilization. This phenotype was associated with only slight modifications of auxin homeostasis at early stages of flower bud development and with minor alterations of ARF and Aux/IAA gene expression. However, microarray transcriptome analysis and large-scale quantitative RT-PCR profiling of transcription factors in developing flower bud and fruit highlighted differentially expressed regulatory genes, which are potential targets for auxin control of fruit set and development in tomato. In conclusion, this work provides clear evidence that the tomato PIN protein SlPIN 4 plays a major role in auxin regulation of tomato fruit set, possibly by preventing precocious fruit development in the absence of pollination, and further gives new insights into the target genes involved in fruit set...|$|R
