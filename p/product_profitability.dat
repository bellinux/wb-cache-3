40|$|A {{review of}} the {{literature}} reveals that the relationship between development speed and new <b>product</b> <b>profitability</b> is not as strong and straightforward as conventional wisdom suggests. A number of studies show positive results, others show mixed results, and some present no evidence of a relationship. In other words, the valence of the link between development speed and new <b>product</b> <b>profitability</b> is unclear at this time. Therefore, this study investigates whether or not speeding new products to market has positive or negative effects on new <b>product</b> <b>profitability.</b> Prior research shows that product innovativeness influences both development speed and new <b>product</b> <b>profitability.</b> This {{raises the question of whether}} increasing speed is equally successful in improving profitability across new products that differ in their degree of innovativeness. Therefore, this study also investigates the moderating effect of product innovativeness on the relationship between development speed and new <b>product</b> <b>profitability.</b> The results from a survey-based study of 233 manufacturers of industrial products in the Netherlands reveal an inverted U-shaped relationship between development speed and new <b>product</b> <b>profitability.</b> The findings also show that the optimal point is different for two new product types—product improvements and line additions—that vary in their innovativeness.

40|$|In {{new product}} development, faster {{is not always}} better. Conceptually, being faster to market should improve {{financial}} performance by improving product quality and reducing development expenses. Empirical support is mixed, however, demonstrating that higher speed to market exhibits an inverted U-shaped relationship with <b>product</b> <b>profitability.</b> Conventional wisdom and empirical research suggest managers make speed to market–product quality–development expense trade-offs. A particular concern regarding speed to market is that extreme speed may jeopardize product quality. Some researchers suggest that speed to market improves product quality while others suggest firms must balance both speed to market and product quality. Also, shorter lead times {{may be associated with}} reduced development expenses, but empirical evidence is conflicting. This research attempts to reconcile conflicting results regarding the speed to market–product quality relationship, their joint impact on <b>product</b> <b>profitability,</b> and their mediation role in the effects of development expenses and cross-functional integration on <b>product</b> <b>profitability.</b> Partial least squares (PLS) is used to analyze multiplexed archival and survey data collected from NPD managers for 1115 different NPD projects in several firms.

40|$|Development {{cycle time}} is the elapsed time from the {{beginning}} of idea generation to the moment that the new product is ready for market introduction. Market entry timing is contingent upon the new product’s cycle time. Only when the product is completed can a firm decide whether and when to enter the market to exploit the new product’s window of opportunity. To determine the right moment of entry a firm needs to correctly balance the risks of premature entry and the missed opportunity of late entry. Proficient market entry timing is therefore defined as the firm’s ability to get the market entry timing right (i. e., neither too early nor too late). The literature has produced divergent evidence with regard to the effects of development cycle time and proficiency in market entry timing on new <b>product</b> <b>profitability.</b> To explain these disparities this study: (1) explores the mediating roles of development costs and sales volume in the relationships between development cycle time, proficiency in market entry timing and new <b>product</b> <b>profitability,</b> respectively, and it; (2) explores the moderating influence of product newness on the relationship between development cycle time and development costs, and that of new product advantage on the link between proficiency in market entry timing and sales volume. The results from a survey-based study of 72 manufacturers of industrial products in The Netherlands suggest that development costs mediate the relationship between development cycle time and new <b>product</b> <b>profitability</b> and that sales volume mediates the link between proficiency in market entry timing and new <b>product</b> <b>profitability.</b> In addition, the findings indicate that new product advantage strengthens the positive relationship between proficiency in market entry timing and sales volume. The results provide no evidence for a moderating effect of product newness. These results have important implications because to maximize new <b>product</b> <b>profitability</b> managers need to distinguish between costs and demand side effects of development cycle time and market entry timing on new <b>product</b> <b>profitability.</b> Keeping this distinction in mind should help them to better determine the relative profit impact of investments in cycle time reduction and/or improved entry timing. Moreover, the findings suggest that highly advantaged products that enter the market at the right time may have a highly attenuated sales volume. It also implies that new products with lower advantage may have very little leeway in hitting the “sweet spot” in market. The message is that “doing the right thing” (i. e., to develop a highly advantaged new product) may be at least as important as correctly balancing the risks of premature entry and the missed opportunity of late entry.

40|$|Development teams {{often use}} mental models to simplify {{development}} time decision making because a comprehensive empirical {{assessment of the}} trade-offs across the metrics of development time, development costs, proficiency in market-entry timing, and new product sales is simply not feasible. Surprisingly, these mental models have not been studied in prior research on the trade-offs among the aforementioned metrics. These mental models are important to consider, however, because they define reality, specify what team members attend to, and guide their decision making. As such, these models influence how development teams make trade-offs across the four metrics to try to optimize new <b>product</b> <b>profitability.</b> Teams with such an objective should manage to a development time that minimizes development costs and to a proficient market-entry timing that maximizes new product sales. Yet many teams use mental models for development time decision making that focus either just on development costs or on proficiency in market-entry timing. This survey-based study uses data from 115 completed NPD projects, all product line additions from manufacturers in The Netherlands, to demonstrate {{that there is a}} cost to simplifying decision making. Making development time decisions without taking into account the contingency between development time and proficiency in market-entry timing can be misleading, and using either a sales-maximization or a cost-minimization simplified decision-making model may result in a cost penalty or a sales loss. The results from this study show that the development time that maximizes new <b>product</b> <b>profitability</b> is longer than the time that maximizes new product sales and is shorter than the development time that minimizes development costs. Furthermore, the results reveal that the cost penalty of sales maximization is smaller than the sales loss of development costs minimization. An important implication of the results is that, to determine the optimal development time, teams need to distinguish between cost and sales effects of development time reductions. To determine the relative impact of these effects this study also estimates the elasticities of development costs, new product sales, and new <b>product</b> <b>profitability</b> with regard to development time. Armed with this knowledge, development teams should be better equipped to make trade-offs among the four metrics of development time, development costs, proficiency in market-entry timing, and new product sale...|$|E
