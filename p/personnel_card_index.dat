40|$|This article {{discusses}} two handwritten {{versions of}} Tadeusz Różewicz’s Kartoteka (The <b>Card</b> <b>Index)</b> from the manuscript {{of the play}} which since the 70 s {{is to be found}} in Professor Józef Kelery’s archive. The range of differences between the manuscript and the printed version of the drama is comparable as between Kartoteka (The <b>Card</b> <b>Index)</b> and Kartoteka rozrzucona (The Scattered <b>Card</b> <b>Index).</b> In the manuscript the author distinguished Kartoteka (The <b>Card</b> <b>Index)</b> and Odmiana tekstu (The Kind of Text). A similar division into Kartoteka (The <b>Card</b> <b>Index)</b> and Odmiana tekstu (The Kind of Text) was used by the poet when the works were printed in 1971. Loose pages from Odmiana tekstu (The Kind of Text) contain unordered fragments of the play of written in 1957. These are mainly variants of conversations of the Hero with the Choir in which the author referred to the then vivid debate on the poetic drama. Mieczysław Kotlarczyk was made a hidden partner of discussion and disguised the Choir as actors of Teatr Rapsodyczny (The Rhapsodic Theatre). On the other hand, Kartoteka (The <b>Card</b> <b>Index)</b> of 1958 is a well-ordered and coherent paginated text by the author himself. In this version the author divided the play into three acts, putting most emphasis on the scene of the Wielki Egzamin (A Big Exam). He also removes unrealistic motifs, among other things, the scene when the Choir participates. The poet writes about the peerelowska (Polish People’s Republic’s the reality with the passion of a political commentator, referring to political harassment) ...|$|R

40|$|In an {{additional}} section Giancarlo Corsi and Johannes Schmidt explore the Luhmann’s methodology {{of his famous}} <b>card</b> <b>index</b> in search of references to the specific issue of the constitution. Luhmann conceived the <b>card</b> <b>index</b> as {{a huge amount of}} notes with a numbered fixed location, each related to a previous note and with no specific or predetermined order. Schmidt’s research clearly demonstrates that the meaning of each note in this filing system derives from its references to other notes, in an often fragmented connection. In this context, Luhmann’s <b>card</b> <b>index</b> sheds light on the character of a difficult tool that drives its user towards unexpected results, almost inevitably leading to ideas that cannot be deduced directly from the filing system itself. Luhmann wrote notes and then put them in what he called his Zettelkasten in order to surprise himself. And {{it comes as no surprise}} from a scholar who had a particular sensitivity for paradoxes...|$|R
40|$|The {{university}} library of the Medical University of Vienna is a hybrid library {{and offers a}} huge stock of literature in print and online. Two projects were realised to improve access to this collection. The library built a catalogue for their students, which includes all relevant resources for their courses. In addition to textbooks, print and online, it includes further relevant resources. The catalogue, called Van Swieten Student 2. 0, uses a lot of web 2. 0 applications. Until now one had to search a <b>card</b> <b>index</b> to find rare books of historical medical interest. That changed because the <b>card</b> <b>index</b> got digitalised and machine readable. So the library could put the <b>card</b> <b>index</b> into a catalogue with web 2. 0 applications to make browsing easier. Because of a ground-breaking service, called eBooks on Demand (eod), {{it is now possible}} to directly order books which are no longer under copyright out of this catalogue...|$|R

40|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 70 s Tadeusz Różewicz presented the manuscript of <b>Card</b> <b>Index</b> to Professor Józef Kelera. It might have stayed a secret of friendship of the dramatist and the critic, however, Różewicz revealed the initials of his friend when in a commenatry to the play, he posed a question, whether there was a full stop after the last word in the manuscript or not? Posing this question, the author claimed the integrality of his masterpiece which was threatened by the widespread interpretations of <b>Card</b> <b>Index</b> as a play of a loose and dispersed structure. Appreciating the value of this question, I turned to Professor Kelera. This way I have had an access to the autograph of the play. In this manuscript has been preserved the play from before its final editing, which its author must surely have made during typing the text. Handwritten notes contain two unknown versions of the play with fragments which would not have been passed by the censors in the then Polish People’s Republic. In the reading of the manuscript the functions of the word and its graphic shape appeared of equal importance, so this version of <b>Card</b> <b>Index</b> can be recognised as a masterpiece of literature...|$|R
