40|$|A useful {{approach}} for evaluating antitussive drugs in humans {{is to determine}} the sensitivity of the cough reflex to a standard challenge. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine if methods used to induce coughing in humans would be effective when used on awake, untrained, healthy dogs for future application in therapeutic trials involving dogs with spontaneous disease. Methods tested were: mechanically stimulating the trachea by digital compression as well as by vibration from an electric shaver, neck massager, and <b>palm</b> <b>sander</b> (11 dogs), and administering nebulized irritant (3000 μM capsaicin), acidic (1 M citric acid), and hypotonic (deionized water) solutions using face masks (4 dogs). The threshold for success was defined as induction of at least 2 moderate or strong coughs in at least 75 % of the dogs. None of the methods tested was successful. Digital compression induced soft (n = 2) or moderate (n = 1) coughing in 3 of 11 dogs tested. Nebulization of citric acid induced 1 soft cough in 1 of 4 dogs. It was concluded that coughing cannot be successfully induced in awake, healthy dogs using methods that are successful in humans. Other strategies must be developed so that cough sensitivity can be objectively and non-invasively measured in dogs for clinical research purposes...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{dramatically}} increasing {{trend in}} the population of aircraft painters with permanent physical limitations was identified among participants in the return-to-work program at a large aircraft maintenance facility. The increase came primarily from painters who had used a full-depth mechanical sanding depainting process. A detailed ergonomic assessment of the process was begun to elicit details of the range and types of risks faced by painters in that shop, and determine what types of mitigation might be utilized to minimize the prevalence of injury. Shoulder injuries represent the biggest area of ergonomic risk for painters. Cervical problems, hand/wrist problems, and lumbar problems make {{up the majority of}} the remainder of injuries. The extent, duration, and complexity of the risks involved in the depaint process required more data than the typical observational and psychophysical assessment tools could provide. Inertial motion capture and tool force instrumentation was implemented in combination with the typical ergonomic methods to provide more details as to the biomechanical sources of risk and how this varies throughout the depainting process. The results indicate surprisingly high normal forces on the <b>palm</b> <b>sander,</b> with rapid muscle fatigue and frequent postural substitution evident during overhead sanding. The long duration of this overhead activity, in combination with the evidence of fatigue, implicates the development of risky scapulo-humeral kinematics and end-of-range glenohumeral motion in the etiology of shoulder and cervical injuries. A mix of management and engineering strategies for mitigation resulted from the analysis...|$|E
