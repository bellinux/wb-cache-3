5|$|The new <b>point</b> <b>system</b> for {{the general}} {{classification}} was met with some resistance as many people were very confused by how the new system operated or simply preferred the original system the organizers had used in years past. In response to the confusion surrounding the general classification format, the race organizers released a supplement to help better explain how the new points system operated. A La Stampa writer claimed that the supplement provided several lengthy example calculations and stated that they would know after the first stage how successful this new system will be.|$|E

40|$|Demerit <b>points</b> <b>systems</b> in Europe: {{room for}} improvement; Some {{recommendations}} from the European project BestPoint. Broadly speaking, a demerit <b>points</b> <b>system</b> involves a road user receiving demerit points {{in addition to}} the regular punishment when a traffic violation has been observed. If someone has received a certain number of demerit points within a certain period of time, the driver’s licence will be temporarily suspended. Demerit <b>points</b> <b>systems</b> aim at regular offenders and for this reason they are generally considered to be fair. This may be the explanation for their considerable popularity. Three quarters of the European Member States use some form of demerit <b>points</b> <b>system.</b> At present, the Netherlands has a simple variant which only applies to novice drivers. Recently, the European project BestPoint has concluded a two-year study into demerit <b>points</b> <b>systems</b> which resulted in a handbook for governments who are considering to implement a demerit <b>points</b> <b>system.</b> BestPoint investigated the actual effectiveness of a demerit <b>points</b> <b>system</b> and which type of system may be expected to be the most satisfactory. The most important conclusion is that demerit <b>points</b> <b>systems</b> are less effective than their popularity in Europe suggests. Initially, they have a considerable road safety effect, but their deterrence often is only short-lasting. However, the effectiveness of a demerit <b>points</b> <b>system</b> may be improved by setting it up in a good way; {{it is very important that}} both the objective and the subjective risk of being caught remain high and that automatically detected offences are also included...|$|R

40|$|In 2012, 21 of the 27 EU Member States {{had some}} form of demerit <b>points</b> <b>system.</b> In theory, demerit <b>points</b> <b>systems</b> {{contribute}} to road safety through three mechanisms: 1) prevention of unsafe behaviour through the risk of receiving penalty points, 2) selection and suspension of the most frequent offenders and 3) correction of risk behaviour through an educative element in the demerit <b>points</b> <b>system.</b> International studies show that in practice {{the effects of a}} demerit <b>points</b> <b>system</b> can indeed be significant, but that these effects exist only for a (very) limited period of time. Since 2002, the Netherlands has had a simple demerit <b>points</b> <b>system</b> for novice drivers and since 2011 for drink driving as well. A condition for a lasting effect of demerit <b>points</b> <b>systems</b> is a large – and continuous – objective and subjective probability of actual withdrawal of the driver’s licence. This probability is closely connected to a sufficiently high level of enforcement, efficient methods of enforcement and frequently returning publicity on the enforcement and the number of people whose licence has been withdrawn...|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to combat, {{there is also}} a mild role-playing component. An experience <b>point</b> <b>system</b> levels up the player character and their equipment (weapons, armor, shields, helms, and magic rings). Equipment pieces have special properties and a predetermined amount of experience points required to master them. Mastering a piece of equipment increases its sale value but decreases the player's experience gain by 20%. Upon leveling up or mastering a piece of equipment, players gain attribute points that can be allotted towards four character attributes: health, attack, shield power, or magic. Each point can only be allocated once and is a permanent upgrade to the character. Players can purchase new equipment using in-game money from sacks and treasure chests found throughout the castle, defeated enemies, and sales of unused equipment. In-game money can be purchased with real money within the game.|$|E

The main role-playing aspect is an experience <b>point</b> <b>system</b> {{that is used to}} increase the character's maximum health or Card Points, or to learn a new skill. The cards are utilized in the progression of the story as well as in combat. The game features a field map and battle screen. The field map is an isometric area where the player can traverse between rooms. Enemies inhabit the field map and track the player to engage in combat, which can be initiated through contact between the player and an enemy. Once combat has been engaged, the game switches to the battle screen which utilizes a card-based battle system.|$|E

5|$|Like {{traditional}} role-playing games, Kingdom Hearts {{features an}} experience <b>point</b> <b>system</b> that determines character development. As enemies are defeated, the player characters gain experience and grow stronger, {{gaining access to}} new abilities. Unlike other games of its type, Kingdom Hearts allows a degree of character development customization through a short tutorial found {{at the beginning of}} the game. The tutorial allows the player to select from one of three main attributes―strength, defense, or magic―for Sora to excel in and one to lack in. By choosing certain options, the player may manipulate how Sora learns abilities, grows statistically, and gains levels. Donald, Goofy, and any other additional party members are assigned specific areas of strength from the outset. Donald excels in magic, while Goofy excels in defense and special attacks.|$|E
5|$|Player characters' combat {{abilities}} and skills are dictated by a character class-based job system. The {{jobs in the}} initial launch were Warrior, Priest, Mage, Martial Artist, Thief, and Minstrel. Later updates added further jobs, such as the Beast Tamer and Dancer. Each job has a separate skill <b>point</b> <b>system</b> that allows customization, and jobs can be changed at dedicated temples found in each major town. Player characters can also adopt Trades, skills that include woodwork, weapon and armor forging among others. Each Trade skill requires materials gathered from the overworld, which are then {{used to create a}} specific type of equipment unique to the gathered materials and Trade. Weapons and items are acquired either in battle alongside in-game currency or through Guilds scattered through Bazaars located in major towns. Guilds will forge new gear, weapons and items for a combined fee of money and materials salvaged from the game world. Also found in towns are vendors where excess items can be stored, merchants which buy and sell various items, and tailor's establishments where the player character can gain new outfits.|$|E

5|$|In their off-duty hours, SPARS contributed {{time and}} effort to many {{community}} and wartime causes. Some became active nurse's aides, some rolled bandages for the Red Cross, others donated blood to blood banks, some visited service men in convalescent hospitals, and others collected gifts for the men overseas. Many of them were also involved in the March of Dimes campaigns, and war chest and war bond drives. Both officers and enlisted were awarded ribbons and medals based on their service, and some were acknowledged for their outstanding contributions to the SPARS and the country. In general, SPARS looked upon their service favorably, and many of them found a form of kinship in having {{been a part of the}} nation's military forces during wartime. With the surrender of Japan in August 1945, the USCG demobilization effort began, and the SPARS were gradually discharged. They were separated from the service on a <b>point</b> <b>system,</b> and on the basis of their jobs. However, many SPARS were reassigned to the personnel separation centers to help with demobilization (women and men reservists) and they were not separated until it was completed. The Women's Reserve of the USCG (SPARS) was inactivated on 25 July 1947.|$|E
5|$|Musashi is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} game, {{in which the}} player fights against enemies with a sword in action-based combat, with some role-playing elements. The player controls the titular Musashi, who fights a variety of enemies using his swords Fusion and Lumina and searches for five scrolls which will increase Lumina's strength and grant him new abilities. There are also several minigames and puzzles scattered throughout which must be completed to advance the plot. The two swords he uses have varied abilities and uses. Fusion, which resembles a katana, is used to chain rapid combo hits together and {{can also be used}} to absorb Bincho energy, which is a type of magical <b>point</b> <b>system</b> that controls how many spells a player can cast and how quickly, or absorb an enemies' skill. The other sword is Lumina, which cannot be effectively used in combos by itself; instead, it can be imbued with elemental properties from Scrolls. Lumina is primarily offensive but in combination with the five elemental scrolls, it gains new skills. The two swords are often used in conjunction with certain techniques which are granted by various rescued townsfolk.|$|E
5|$|SMP2 {{supports}} {{a trial of}} a special category of bigadv work units, designed to simulate proteins that are unusually large and computationally intensive {{and have a great}} scientific priority. These units originally required a minimum of eight CPU cores, which was raised to sixteen later, on February7, 2012. Along with these added hardware requirements over standard SMP2 work units, they require more system resources such as random-access memory (RAM) and Internet bandwidth. In return, users who run these are rewarded with a 20% increase over SMP2's bonus <b>point</b> <b>system.</b> The bigadv category allows Folding@home to run especially demanding simulations for long times that had formerly required use of supercomputing clusters and could not be performed anywhere else on Folding@home. Many users with hardware able to run bigadv units have later had their hardware setup deemed ineligible for bigadv work units when CPU core minimums were increased, leaving them only able to run the normal SMP work units. This frustrated many users who invested significant amounts of money into the program only to have their hardware be obsolete for bigadv purposes shortly after. As a result, Vijay Pande announced in January 2014 that the bigadv program would end on January 31, 2015.|$|E
