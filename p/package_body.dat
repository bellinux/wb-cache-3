40|$|Objectives: Phthalates {{are used}} as {{plasticizers}} in polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastics. As phthalate plasticizers are not chemically bound to the PVC, they can leach, migrate or evaporate into indoor air and atmosphere, foodstuffs, other materials, etc. Therefore, humans are exposed through ingestion, inhalation, and dermal exposure over their entire lifetime, including during intrauterine development. In particular, university students have {{a great number of}} opportunities to contact products including phthalates during campus life (food <b>packaging,</b> <b>body</b> care products, cosmetic, lotions, aftershave, perfume etc.). The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine levels of phthalate exposure as undergraduate students begin to use pharmaceuticals and personal care products including phthalates. Methods: Phthalate metabolites, mono-ethyl phthalate (MEP), mono-n-butyl phthalate (MnBP), mono-isobutyl phthalate (MiBP), mono- 2 - ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP), {(mono-(2 -ethyl- 5 -hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (MEHHP}, and mono-(2 -ethlyl- 5 -oxohexyl) phthalate (MEOHP} were examined. 80 urine samples collected from university students were analyzed using LC/MS/MS(API 4000, Applied Bioscience) with on-line enrichment and column-switching techniques. This study was carried out at Y university located in Gyonggi Province from 2008 to 2011.

50|$|The leads {{emerge from}} the longer sides of the package along the seam, {{parallel}} {{to the top and}} bottom planes of the package, and are bent downward approximately 90 degrees (or slightly less, leaving them angled slightly outward from the centerline of the <b>package</b> <b>body.)</b> (The SOIC, the SMT package that most resembles a typical DIP, appears essentially the same, notwithstanding size scale, except that after being bent down the leads are bent upward again by an equal angle to become parallel with the bottom plane of the package.) In ceramic (CERDIP) packages, an epoxy or grout is used to hermetically seal the two halves together, providing an air and moisture tight seal to protect the IC die inside. Plastic DIP (PDIP) packages are usually sealed by fusing or cementing the plastic halves around the leads, but a high degree of hermeticity is not achieved because the plastic itself is usually somewhat porous to moisture and the process cannot ensure a good microscopic seal between the leads and the plastic at all points around the perimeter. However, contaminants are usually still kept out well enough that the device can operate reliably for decades with reasonable care in a controlled environment.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the {{corrosion}} behavior of parylene-metal-parylene thin films using accelerated-lifetime soak tests. The samples under test are thin film resistors with a 200 nm layer of Au sandwiched by parylene-C on both sides, fabricated with parylene-metal skin technology. The samples are tested in hot saline both passively and actively, and different failure modes are observed using optical and electron-beam metrologies. Bubbles and delamination are first {{seen in the}} samples after 2 days of soaking under passive conditions, and followed by metal corrosion. While under active conditions, either bubbles or parylene breakdowns are observed depending on the thickness of parylene packaging. These results contribute {{to a better understanding}} of the failure mechanisms of parylene <b>packaging</b> in <b>body</b> fluids...|$|R
5000|$|In stark {{contrast}} to the boxy Crackerbox, the exterior of the Astro/Titan featured rounded body corners and wraparound windshield glass. [...] In 1975, GMC introduced a Dragfoiler roof spoiler as an option. [...] In an option that became standard a year later, in 1979, GMC and Chevrolet offered the SS (Special Series) package. [...] Featuring a (much) larger radiator grille, improvements to exterior and interior trim, the SS package was meant to market the Astro/Titan towards owner-operators. [...] In 1983, the Aero Astro option package was released, largely as an effort to improve fuel economy. Along with the Dragfoiler roof spoiler, the option <b>package</b> included <b>body</b> extension panels between the cab and trailer, an air dam below an extended bumper and an optimized radiator grille.|$|R
40|$|Seals {{that provide}} the {{containment}} system interface between the <b>packaging</b> <b>body</b> and closure must function in high and low temperature environments, under dynamic and static loading conditions, and with different types of contained media. It {{is one of the}} most critical elements in the container since the container fails to meet regulations if the seal does not function properly. A research and testing program for seal materials was initiated at Sandia in 1988 with the goal of characterizing the behavior of seal materials commonly used in packages conditions as specified in the regulations (NRC IOCFR Part 71) and American National Standards Institute (ANSI) 14. 5. The performance of elastomeric seals in undeformed closures at both high and low temperatures has been investigated (Bronowski 1995). Work has begun with this program to determine the response of elastomeric seals to fast acting dynamic deformations`` in the closure. The response of elastomeric o-ring seals during closure movements due to long-term deformations has already been characterized. What has not been well characterized are short-term closure movements with durations of only a few milliseconds that result in the so called ``burp`` release. Methods for generating this type of response in a repeatable manner had not been developed and standard leak detection equipment does not have a fast enough response time to measure these transient events. One factor which affects the length of the burp is the ability of the o-ring to quickly close the gap to prevent a significant leak. The dynamic characteristics of the elastomeric o-ring material including the dynamic spring modulus and internal damping are directly related to its ability to quickly close the gap. A set of tests designed to determine the dynamic properties for various material types and durometers (hardness) of elastomers that were both lubricated and dry at ambient temperature were conducted...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{our effort}} to reduce thermo-mechanical failures related IC packaging reliability problems. These reliability problems are driven by the mismatch between the different material properties. First of all, finite element analysis are adopted to investigate the influence of encapsulation structures and material properties on the stress distribution in dielectric layers and plastic strain distribution in die for a typical stacked package of IC microstructures. Results show that thinner <b>package</b> <b>body,</b> lower thermal stress and smaller plastic strain can be realized in this micro-structure with the different design geometry parameters and materials properties. Secondly, it was {{also found that the}} transition layer of TiN between the die and dielectric layer has a pronounced influence on decreasing the local stress in the passivation layer by comparison analysis. These studies would be beneficial to improve the reliability of stacked IC micro-structure packages...|$|E
40|$|We {{present an}} {{enrichment}} of the Anna specification language for Ada aimed at dealing {{not only with}} functional specification of packages but also with non-functional information about them. By non-functional information we mean information about efficiency, reliability and, in general, any software attribute measuring somehow the quality of software (perhaps in a subjective manner). We divide this information into three kinds: definition of non-functional properties, statement of non-functional behaviour and statement of non-functional requirements; like Anna annotations, all of this information appears in Ada packages and package bodies and their syntax is close to Ada constructs. Non-functional information may be considered not only as valuable comments, but also as an input for an algorithm capable of selecting the "best" <b>package</b> <b>body</b> for every package definition in a program, the "best" meaning the one that fits the set of non-functional requirements of the package in the program...|$|E
