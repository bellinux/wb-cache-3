The shell model is implemented both for the implicit static analysis and in the context of explicit dynamic integration pertinent to impact loading, and the implementation results in a 7 -parameter solid-shell element based on a 6 -noded triangular element. In order to properly formulate the dynamic fracture characteristics, a rate-dependent cohesive zone model is employed with respect to e. g. limiting crack speeds as observed experimentally. In the final example, this model has been applied to a blast loaded pressure vessel that has been experimentally tested. The results indicate that the right crack speed as well as fracture characteristics are relatively well captured. Furthermore, it appears that the discontinuous model exhibits the expected properties with respect to critical time step size in the dynamic analysis and convergence behavior towards the analytical static solution...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} reasons for the inclusion of a course focused on sex work, particularly prostitution, in the social work curriculum of graduate schools of social work. An anonymous survey was distributed to field <b>placement</b> <b>directors</b> at CSWE accredited graduate social work programs. The survey asked questions about the placement of students at organizations that provide services to sex workers and the existence of courses in the curriculum that focus on sex work and sex workers. The survey confirmed the hypothesis of this exploratory dissertation that while social work interns are being placed in organizations where they are encountering sex workers, there are very few courses that provide information about how to address the specific needs of this population. In response to these survey results, a curriculum was created that includes a comprehensive compilation of sources and addresses the evolution of prostitution, the relevance of feminist, economic, and intersectionality theoretical frameworks, the use of specific teaching pedagogies, and the implications of sexual trauma and a multitude of critical psychosocial challenges. In addition, this curriculum can be adapted for use by other professionals, such as those in the fields of medicine, criminal justice, public health, and policy development as a way of educating them about the complexities involved in understanding and responding to the lives of female street-walking prostitutes...|$|R

It is presented in a non-traditional dissertation format that includes three publishable articles with the introduction and conclusion chapters. The first article represents the literature review portion that includes a critique of an existing skills framework for online language teaching followed by a proposed framework for online language teaching skills. This article also uses a systems view {{to look at the}} roles and responsibilities of various stakeholders in an online learning system. Four major recommendations are provided to help language teacher training programs prepare future language teachers for online language teaching. The second article starts with a review of research and literature on conceptual change in education. It is followed by a proposed conceptual change framework to help pre-service teachers increase their awareness of online education, commonly known in the US as virtual schooling (VS). This study used a grounded approach to identify common preconceptions, misconceptions, and concerns of VS based on secondary data that included pre-service teachers 2 Ì† 7 personal journals and responses to a set of materials related to VS in part of a curriculum intervention in a pre-existing introductory field experience course at a large Midwestern university. Findings were complemented by insights from an interview with the course instructor and the researcher 2 Ì† 7 s journal. The article shows the importance of identifying pre-service teachers 2 Ì† 7 preconceptions, misconceptions, and concerns about VS to facilitate the selection of relevant resources and the design of curricular activities. The third article takes a case study approach to the study of a pilot virtual field experience. This article proposes that a field experience on VS should be offered virtually because traditional field experiences cannot fully capture the reality of VS since VS includes changes in roles, such as the complementary roles of a VS teacher and a VS site-facilitator.

This study explored the practices employed by career development center directors in nine degree-granting institutions in a New England state in addressing the career development needs of students with learning disabilities and disability issues that affect career placement. The study was guided by three major research questions regarding practices employed by career centers in addressing the unique needs of college students with learning disabilities, disability issues that affected career placement, and recommendations of participants for serving these students. ^ Interview data were analyzed qualitatively for common patterns and themes.

40|$|Il y a une vingtaine d'annÃ©es, la plupart des {{entreprises}} ne se livraient que dans une mesure trÃ¨s limitÃ©e au recrutement systÃ©matique des diplÃ´mÃ©s universitaires: ceux-ci Ã©taient peu nombreux et les directeurs des entreprises qui Ã©taient sortis du rang n'Ã©taient pas disposÃ©s Ã  les affecter Ã  des postes supÃ©rieurs. Aujourd'hui, la situation a changÃ©. L'auteur aborde le problÃ¨me tant du point de vue thÃ©orique que du point de vue pratique. COMPANY PLANNING FOR UNIVERSITY RECRUITMENTThis essay discusses company {{planning for}} university recruitment. Implicit {{in the notion}} of planning is, of course, the setting of goals, the evaluation of needs, and the selection of means [steps, procedures, techniques] most conducive to the attainment of the goals and the gratification of the needsÂ ; in other words, planning is knowing why and where, and determining how, prior to direct action on a given problem. Essential, on the other hand, to the concept of recruitment as it is used nowadays is the idea of outer-directedness, of seeking out, of reaching for someone or something. Two decades ago, most companies did little seeking or reaching of a systematic nature for university graduatesÂ ; these were relatively few, and many a company executive who had come up from the ranks with only limited formal education were still wondering whether they should lay emphasis on that so-called high-talent manpower for high-level jobs when it was customary to promote from within and to hire even college graduates for low-level jobs. For most employers, the company grapevine, or contacts with professional clubs or associations, or an anonymous ad in the papers, were considered sufficient to fill in immediately-needed replacements. Any plan or step beyond those would have been termed exaggerated and too costly. Since the end of World War II, however, university recruitement by corporations has gradually become more deliberate and elaborate. With the advent of the new technology and the development of the behavioral sciences as applied to industry, there has emerged a fresh realization by top management of the need for ever more university graduates with more knowledge to join the ranks of industry. Formal training in institutions of higher learning has ceased to be opposed to practical experience without theoretical knowledge and has slowly taken precedence over it. Tight markets for high-talent manpower and tougher competition between firms have led the latter at the doorsteps of pertinent universities, so as to better get the ear of the <b>placement</b> <b>directors</b> and {{to get a closer look}} at potential candidates for employment still in the making. When Mohammed does not go to the mountain, or rather to one's specific little mount, all individual mounts must go to Mohammed, however costly, time-consuming or mortifying the process may be !Such a process, which I believe to be irreversible, is likely to increase in amplitude and importance during the coming years, since we are only on the threshold of what Mr. Hann [Arthur S., & George S. Odiorne. Effective College Recruiting. Ann Arbor, Mich. Â : Bureau of Industrial Relations, University of Michigan, 1961. ] has called the Â«Â Age of GrowthÂ Â», and which could also be named the Â«Â Age of KnowledgeÂ Â»Â : technical and administrative knowledge at all levels of the business concern, and especially at the top. And irrespective of the fact that universities are already producing and will presently develop more and more graduates, demand from industry will far outweigh supply, so that scarcity of university graduates will for years to come invite company recruiters to knock at the door of the university with much competition around. Such being the prospect, how should companies plan their recruitment in the universitiesÂ ? This is the object of this paper, and no small one at that. I fulfil it by relying on two different levels of discussion, namelyÂ : the theoretical and the practical. Theoretically, I tackle the following topicsÂ : planning and needs determinationÂ ; developing cooperation within the companyÂ ; allocating responsibility for college recruitingÂ ; the recruiting teamÂ ; recruiting proceduresÂ ; and relationships between the firm and the university. Discussion of the practical aspects includesÂ : the structural relationships within the organization and the evaluation of present and future needsÂ ; the application of the mixed formula of recruitingÂ ; the recruiting teamÂ ; recruiting practices and relations between the team and the universities and graduate students...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} {{unprecedented}} international attention on the issue of teacher quality. This has resulted in a focus by policy makers on initial teacher education, with many systems opting to articulate standards to define the competences that newly qualified teachers should possess. Central to all programmes of initial teacher education is school placement, a key period of significant learning for student teachers and a time when their competence is assessed. A small proportion of student teachers experience failure or struggle during these placements, however little research into their experiences is evident. This qualitative study explores the perceptions and experiences of members of â€˜triadic learning to teach partnerships,â€™ who have had experience of the phenomenon. In-depth, semi-structured interviews were used to capture data from student teachers, cooperating teachers, <b>placement</b> tutors and <b>directors</b> of school <b>placement</b> on their perspectives regarding the causes of student teacher failure, the impacts of its occurrence and the effectiveness of any support mechanisms provided. The findings revealed the complexity and uniqueness of each occurrence, and the significant impacts on all involved, most particularly the student teachers. Six typologies of student teachers who struggle or experience failure and five pillars for the provision of support emerged as new contributions to aid teacher educators to understand and adequately support these student teachers. Conclusions are also drawn regarding the need for a standards-led approach to the formulation of assessment judgements on student teachersâ€™ competence and the need in the Irish context for cooperating teachers to be enabled to play a greater and more central role...|$|R
