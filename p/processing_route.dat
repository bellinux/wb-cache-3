5000|$|The {{elaboration}} likelihood {{model is}} similar in concept to and shares many ideas with other dual processing models, such as the heuristic-systematic model of information processing. [...] In the elaboration likelihood model, cognitive processing is the central route and affective/emotion processing {{is often associated with}} the peripheral route. The central route pertains to an elaborate cognitive processing of information while the peripheral route relies on cues or feelings. The ELM suggests that true attitude change only happens through the central <b>processing</b> <b>route</b> that incorporates both cognitive and affective components as opposed to the more heuristics-based peripheral route. This suggests that motivation through emotion alone will not result in an attitude change.|$|E
50|$|In the {{aerospace}} industry, Titanium alloys such as Ti—6 Al—4V find extensive use in aerospace applications, {{not only because}} of their specific high temperature strength, but also {{because of the fact that}} a large number of these alloys exhibit superplastic behavior. Superplastic sheet thermoforming has been identified as a standard <b>processing</b> <b>route</b> for the production of complex shapes, especially and are amenable to superplastic forming (SPF). However, in these alloys the additions of vanadium make them considerably expensive and so, there is a need for developing superplastic titanium alloys with cheaper alloying additions.

A significant improvement in mechanical properties was observed after one CEE pass via both <b>processing</b> <b>routes.</b> However, different grain structures were achieved after Routes I and II showing a more homogeneous microstructure and hardness distribution in Route II compared to Route I. In addition, compression tests of the processed samples demonstrated that Route II results in a homogeneous compressive strength. Finally, microstructure evolution during subsequent passes of this process was investigated by electron back scattered diffraction. Micro-shear bands were found as potential sites for accelerating the formation of new grains which resulted in fragmentation of the initial grains and leading to an ultrafine-grained (UFG) microstructure...|$|R

50|$|Stimulation of the VMPC by {{transcranial}} magnetic stimulation, {{has been}} shown to inhibit the ability of human subjects to take into account intent when forming a moral judgment. According to this investigation, TMS did not disrupt participants' ability to make any moraljudgment. On the contrary, moral judgments of intentional harms and non-harms were unaffected by TMS to either the RTPJ or the control site; presumably, however, people typically make moral judgments of intentional harms by considering not only the action's harmful outcome but the agent's intentions and beliefs. So whywere moral judgments of intentional harms not affected by TMS to the RTPJ? One possibility is that moral judgments typically reflect a weighted function of any morally relevant information that is available at the time. On the basis of this view, when information concerning the agent's belief is unavailable or degraded, the resulting moral judgment simply reflects a higher weighting of othermorally relevant factors (e.g., outcome). Alternatively, following TMS to the RTPJ, moral judgments might be made via an abnormal <b>processing</b> <b>route</b> that does not take belief into account. On eitheraccount, when belief information is degraded or unavailable, moral judgments are shifted toward other morally relevant factors (e.g., outcome). For intentional harms and non-harms, however, the outcome suggests the same moral judgment as the intention. Thus, the researchers suggest that TMS to the RTPJ disrupted the processing of negative beliefs for both intentional harms and attempted harms, but the current design allowed the investigators to detect this effect only in the case of attempted harms, in which the neutral outcomes did not afford harsh moral judgments on their own.|$|E

40|$|The {{question}} regarding whether somatosensory inputs {{are processed}} in parallel or in series {{has not been}} clearly answered. Several studies that have applied dynamic causal modeling (DCM) to fMRI data have arrived at seemingly divergent conclusions. However, these divergent results {{could be explained by}} the hypothesis that the <b>processing</b> <b>route</b> of somatosensory information changes with time. Specifically, we suggest that somatosensory stimuli are processed in parallel only during the early stage, whereas the processing is later dominated by serial processing. This hypothesis was revisited in the present study based on fMRI analyses of tactile stimuli and the application of DCM to magnetoencephalographic (MEG) data collected during sustained (260 ms) tactile stimulation. Bayesian model comparisons were used to infer the processing stream. We demonstrated that the favored processing stream changes over time. We found that the neural activity elicited in the first 100 ms following somatosensory stimuli is best explained by models that support a parallel <b>processing</b> <b>route,</b> whereas a serial <b>processing</b> <b>route</b> is subsequently favored.

30|$|It {{has been}} {{acknowledged}} by another author [13] {{that there are}} a number of complications that exist when comparing experimental data from different sources or experiments. This includes, firstly, the fact that the nanomaterials are produced through different <b>processing</b> <b>routes</b> which may lead to different structures, purity and grain size distributions. Secondly, it is remarked [13] that the experimental methods used to impose different strain rates on the specimen often involve widely different loading methods, even in the same study. And thirdly, it is noted [13] that different volumes of materials may be investigated under different experimental techniques. Kumar et al [13] further state that given the small specimen dimensions commonly used to probe many nanocrystalline metals, it is essential to isolate any possible effects of specimen size from intrinsic material properties. The existence of the above complications justifies the variable results reported in the literature. These variable results have equally been revealed in the present work through constraining the mechanisms of grain growth (i.e. constraining <b>processing</b> <b>routes)</b> and the nature of evolution of grain shape. It has been reported that different mechanisms of grain growth can be used (or can be referred to) as different <b>processing</b> <b>routes</b> [9 – 11]. Because of these varying natures of the results, supported by Kumar et al [13], more emphasis will be put on the discussion of the trends obtained in this paper.|$|R
