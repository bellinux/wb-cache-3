40|$|The {{province}} of Ontario holds approximately 70. 2 million hectares of forests: about 17 % of Canada’s and 2 % of the world’s forests. Approximately 21 million hectares are managed as commercial forests, {{with an annual}} harvest {{in the early part}} of the decade approaching 200 000 ha. Yield tables developed by Walter Plonski in the 1950 s provide the basis for most wood supply calculations and growth projections in Ontario. However, due to changes in legislation, policy, and the plan-ning process, they no longer fully meet the needs of resource managers. Furthermore, Plonski`s tables are not appropri-ate for the range of silvicultural options now practised in Ontario. In October 1999, the Canadian Ecology Centre-Forestry Research Partnership (CEC-FRP) was formed and initiated a series of projects that collectively aimed at characterizing, quantifying and ultimately increasing the economically available wood supply. Comprehensive, defensi-ble, and reliable forecasts of forest growth and yield were identified as key knowledge gaps. The CEC-FRP, with support from the broader science community and forest industry, initiated several new research activities to address these needs, the results of which are outlined briefly in this paper. We describe new stand level models (e. g., benchmark yield curves, FVSOntario, stand density management diagrams) that were developed using data collected from permanent sample <b>plots</b> and <b>permanent</b> <b>growth</b> <b>plots</b> established and remeasured during the past 5 decades. Similarly, we discuss new height–diameter equations developed for 8 major commercial tree species that specifically account for stand density. A...|$|R
40|$|Trees {{are being}} {{established}} on substantial areas of Australian farmland, often extending into districts where forestry {{has not been}} previously practiced. Irrespective of purpose-wood production, increased water use, erosion control, habitat restoration, carbon sequestration or bio-energy production-the benefits of farm forestry depend on tree survival and adequate growth. Site assessment has been mainly used for the prediction of tree performance {{but it can be}} extended to form the basis for site-specific management. Site assessment needs to provide information on species and management inputs suitable to a site's inherent environmental attributes so that the aim of maximum profitability can be achieved while maintaining a sustainable use of resources. A new site concept for farm forestry is presented that reflects these factors. This new site concept is defined as the integrated effect of environmental factors that influence the potential growth of a particular tree genotype and affect the soil management of that stand of trees to produce a particular product or output. This concept of site is environment-based, independent of the presence of trees, and includes an explicit acknowledgement of a hierarchy of scale (both spatial and temporal) and how it affects what environmental factors need to be assessed. The goal for site assessment for farm forestry is to develop pragmatic, robust and quantitative interpretations from the measured data to aid multiple aspects of plantation management. A pragmatic approach to field survey is required, with data gathering (whether morphological, analytical or electronic) being based on demonstrated benefit rather than routine prescription, guess-work or tradition. Site assessment needs to be linked to well-designed species trials and <b>permanent</b> <b>growth</b> <b>plots</b> so continual evolution and improvement of edaphic and silvicultural relationships can be incorporated into future modifications...|$|R

Microfiche. xiv, 176 leaves, bound 29 cmKoa (Acacia koa) is a {{valuable}} native hardwood which {{is the focus of}} a complex set of land-use issues in Hawaii. We conducted an integrated research program to investigate: 1) impacts of cattle grazing on koa growth and on the pest Passiflora mollissima, 2) koa growth and stand development, and 3) the effects of koa shade on pasture productivity and forage quality. Results were synthesized into a computer model to project stand development. Long-term projections were used to evaluate the economic feasibility of koa production under different management scenarios. Two non-destructive methods for monitoring leaf area removal by cattle were tested versus harvest. Estimates of projected canopy area using color slides and grid-counting correlated well with leaf area and provided a simple and reliable method, while the LiCor LAI- 2000 was more variable. In a grazing experiment, survival of koa saplings over 3 cm diameter was high, but diameter increment was reduced in proportion to the fraction of leaf area removed. Diameter growth was reduced by trampling and was increased by grass removal. Repeated grazing would be necessary to control P. mollissima. Analysis of <b>permanent</b> <b>growth</b> <b>plots</b> showed that larger trees grew faster and suppressed the growth of smaller trees. Mortality was a function of diameter increment. Higher site quality reduced competition, allowing mid-ranking trees faster growth and longer survival. Light absoption by koa canopies was strongly affected by solar angle, in response to the vertical phyllode orientation. Kikuyu grass (Pennisetum clandestinum) growth was reduced in proportion to light interception by the koa canopy. The synthesis of field results into a stochastic, non-spatial, gap-scale model showed that maturing koa stands converged towards similar merchantable volumes despite large variations in initial stocking density. Simulation of silvopastoral systems showed that grazing reduced tree leaf area index and harvestable volumes, but increased grass production. Based on projected volumes of koa under different management options, and using current real property tax rates in Hawaii, silvopastoral production of koa should yield positive cash flows and higher economic returns than either monoculture koa production or grazing only...|$|R

This stand is located in Kuhara Village, Kasuya District, Fukuoka Prefecture and belongs to Kyushu University Forest. The topography is rather steep with the average slope angle as great as 32 degrees. The soil is considerably fertile, because the basic rock consists of Amphibolite. The main species are Hinoki (ChamaeciParis obtusa Sieb. et Zucc,), Sugi (CryPtomeria japonica D. Don), Matsu (Pinus densiflora or Thunbergii) and broad-leaved trees (about 42 species). Fourteen students were grouped into five parties, every party consisting of one leader, two or three students and one laborer. Sixty-five 0. 05 ha. plots were systematically laid out at 100 m intervals in 70, 61 ha. of the total area. A plot was a square with the sides measuring 25. 35 meters each. The sampling intensity was 4. 6 %. The comparison between the estimated values by sampling and the results of tree-by-tree measurement made for the preparation of the management plan is shown below: (Table) From the above table, it seems that the volume of broard- 1 eaved trees were significantly underestimated, The method of growth estimate was by means of the regression in individual trees.

40|$|SUMMARY: Crow/AMSAA {{reliability}} <b>growth</b> <b>plots</b> use failure {{information from}} maintenance systems {{to provide a}} visual tool, with straight-line graphs, for predicting the next failure in systems where humans can influence the results. C/A plots work well with single failure or mixed failure modes. The simple log-log plots have easily calculated statistics to show if failures are increasing, decreasing, or exhibiting no-change in failure rates. The straight-line plots are helpful for forecasting future failures—the “fearless forecast ” of future events catches the interest {{of people who can}} change the system to prevent the forecasted events. When implementing system improvements calculate and track the savings in failures between the old and new methods to convert maintenance situations into time and money for easy selection of alternatives.

40|$|The {{cyclin-dependent kinase}} (CDK) {{inhibitor}} p 21 (Waf 1 /Cip 1 /Sdi 1) was identified initially as a gene induced in senescent cells and {{itself has been}} shown to cause <b>permanent</b> <b>growth</b> arrest/senescence. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), a byproduct of oxidative processes, can also induce an irreversible growth arrest similar to senescence. Here we show that p 21 increased intracellular levels of ROS both in normal fibroblasts and in p 53 -negative cancer cells. N-acetyl-L-cysteine, an ROS inhibitor, rescued p 21 -induced senescence, showing that ROS elevation is necessary for induction of the <b>permanent</b> <b>growth</b> arrest phenotype. p 16 (Ink 4 a), a CDK 4 - and CDK 6 -specific inhibitor, failed to increase ROS levels, and cell cycle arrest induced by p 16 was reversible following its down-regulation, demonstrating the specificity of this p 21 effect. A p 21 mutant that lacked the ability to bind proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) retained the ability to induce both ROS and <b>permanent</b> <b>growth</b> arrest.

TITLE: TREE-RING CHEMISTRY AND GROWTH RESPONSE TO EXPERIMENTAL WATERSHED ACIDIFICATION MAJOR PROFESSOR: Dr. Eric Holzmueller Forest ecosystems {{in the eastern}} United States are threatened by acid deposition rates that have increased dramatically since industrialization. We utilized two watersheds at the Fernow Experimental Forest in West Virginia to examine long-term effects of acidification on ecological processes. One watershed has been treated with ammonium sulfate (approximately twice the ambient deposition rate) since 1989 to simulate acid deposition while the other served as a control. Prior to treatment both watersheds were similar in age and species composition. Ten dominant overstory Prunus serotina and Liriodendron tulipifiera trees were selected and cored from each watershed to measure bolewood concentrations of elements essential for growth over time. In addition, changes in tree species basal area were analyzed utilizing 50 long-term <b>growth</b> <b>plots</b> established in 1990. Results of this experiment show lower calcium and magnesium concentration and increased acidic cation concentration in the treated watershed for both species indicating a negative treatment effect. These results were {{similar to that of}} a previous study conducted at the Fernow with periods of significant differences in cation concentrations between the treated and control watershed. Growth response, measured through relative growth rates of cored trees and changes in basal area from <b>growth</b> <b>plots,</b> was not as conclusive, but it did appear that treatment may be having a negative affect for both species during the last measurement of the <b>growth</b> <b>plots.</b> These results indicate a need for further research to understand the impact of long-term acidification so that sustainable forest management practices in areas affected by acid deposition may be developed...|$|R

In 1986, Pardy et al. ([1992]) established <b>growth</b> <b>plots</b> to obtain data on the height and diameter growth of planted kauri. During the 1986 assessments, all measured trees were tagged.

Not all kauri were measured for height, so unmeasured heights were estimated by fitting non-linear regression curves to the height and diameter data for each stand, at each measurement period. Predicted heights were calculated for each stand at each measurement period and estimated heights were entered onto the database.|$|R
