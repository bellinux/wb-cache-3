25|$|Drift (or windage) is {{the term}} for water {{droplets}} of the <b>process</b> <b>flow</b> allowed to escape in the cooling tower discharge. Drift eliminators are used in order to hold drift rates typically to 0.001–0.005% of the circulating flow rate. A typical drift eliminator provides multiple directional changes of airflow to prevent the escape of water droplets. A well-designed and well-fitted drift eliminator can greatly reduce water loss and potential for Legionella or water treatment chemical exposure.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Appropriate {{arrangement}} of machinery in a manufacturing environment {{can have a}} positive impact on the productivity of a company. A detailed work study carried out at a furniture manufacturing company revealed that parts travelled long distances before the final product is produced owing to the positions of machinery and crisscrossing <b>process</b> <b>flows.</b> This paper looks at how the plant layout was re-organized by mapping <b>process</b> <b>flows</b> and regrouping of the machinery according to their functions and products using machine distance matrices. Challenges relating to the plant layout, <b>process</b> <b>flows,</b> materials handling and transportation as well as assembly procedures were established, coupled with grouping machines according to functions and the least distance between interacting workstations. Using the machine distance matrices, processes were mapped and equipment reorganized to allow for continuous flow of production, resulting in significant reductions in transportation distances among interacting workstations and elimination of crisscrossing process paths...|$|R

Furthermore, there are complex interactions in these <b>process</b> <b>flows,</b> whereby each <b>process</b> step can affect many other steps, and each final device parameter might be determined by the results from many inputs.

40|$|Multi-agent {{systems are}} {{well suited for}} {{building}} large software systems. A great deal of these complex systems includes <b>process</b> <b>flows</b> that are concerned with time or are even time-critical. The activities of these <b>process</b> <b>flows</b> are often executed in distributed autonomous subsystems {{that have to be}} synchronized with respect to the superordinated task execution. To be able to build such systems and test their behavior adequately, it is often advantageous and sometimes necessary to simulate them in the run-up to their practical use. Testing and simulation of <b>process</b> <b>flows</b> within multi-agent systems requires synchronization of the participating agents with respect to the global simulation time. In this paper, a design proposal and a service implementation for time management is presented, which takes care of the special requirements imposed by multi-agent settings. This so called time service is implemented as a FIPA-compliant agent, and can be used to couple heterogeneous subsystems implemented on different agent platforms. 1...|$|R
