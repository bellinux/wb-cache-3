30|$|This study aims {{to present}} the following: first, to {{determine}} the oceanic response {{to the passage of}} a typhoon using daily in situ observations made by <b>profiling</b> <b>floats</b> deployed in the western North Pacific Ocean and second, to quantitatively evaluate the effect of the oceanic response on the typhoon predictions produced using an atmosphere-wave-ocean coupled model, especially when the observed extent of sea surface cooling exceeded 2 °C. The observations made by the <b>profiling</b> <b>floats</b> will be outlined in the next subsection.|$|R
40|$|The {{scientific}} community observes the ocean for {{applications in the}} fields of oceanography and climate research. In order to recover in situ data, more than 3, 000 <b>profiling</b> <b>floats</b> are operated in the framework of the Argo Program. Each float performs cycles between the sea surface and a depth of 2, 000 meters. Scientific data are gathered while the float is travelling upward from the depths of the oceans, and are then transmitted via a satellite communication system {{at the end of each}} cycle. During its time at the surface, mainly dedicated to transmissions, the float is vulnerable and subject to drift, which limits its use in many studies. Moreover, transmission times are becoming longer due to a trend towards high resolution or multi-sensor profiles. Consequently, the transmission system embedded in the <b>profiling</b> <b>floats</b> had to evolve. Argos- 3 is the latest generation of the Argos satellite communication system. It has been designed to allow instruments to transmit more data in a small time budget, and as an alternative to Iridium, already implemented on <b>profiling</b> <b>floats</b> in restrictive applications. This study aims to evaluate the implementation of Argos- 3 on Arvor <b>profiling</b> <b>floats.</b> Tests were carried out first in the laboratory, before being implemented on the Arvor float and deployed at sea. We proved that the high data rate mode suffered from European electromagnetic noise, which is incompatible with our application. We successfully qualified the interactive low data rate mode, which is capable of transmitting an entire dataset in a few minutes, compared to 8 to 10 hours for the previous Argos- 2 system...|$|R
30|$|Vertical {{profiles}} of the water temperature and salinity were obtained from three <b>profiling</b> <b>floats</b> during their ascents. Real-time quality control was performed before the data were made available on the Japan Argo Real Time Data Base ([URL] which is operated by the Japan Meteorological Agency, from which the data {{used in this study}} were taken. Daily water temperature and salinity observations made by the three <b>profiling</b> <b>floats</b> were interpolated from the subsurface (at a depth of nearly 5  m) to a depth of 200  m using the method developed by Akima (1970). The temperature and salinity between the surface and a depth of 5  m were assumed to be constant, because no surface observations were made by the <b>profiling</b> <b>floats.</b> The maximum sea surface cooling values (Table  1) were calculated from the water temperatures observed at a depth of 5  m during each analysis period. This method is valid when surface wind speeds are higher than approximately 7  m s− 1 (Soloviev and Lukas 2006; Kawai and Wada 2007). Soloviev and Lukas (2006) showed that the water was well mixed (in terms of temperature) between the subsurface and a depth of 5  m under relatively strong winds (approximately 7  m s− 1) in the Pacific warm pool during the Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Response Experiment.|$|R
5000|$|The SOLO-TREC (Sounding Oceanographic Lagrangrian Observer Thermal RECharging) is a <b>profiling</b> <b>float</b> {{that uses}} a novel thermal {{recharging}} engine powered by the natural temperature differences found at different ocean depths to cycle {{up and down in}} the ocean. The research and prototype were developed by researchers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, CA, and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego, CA. The project name stands for [...] "Sounding Oceanographic Lagrangrian Observer Thermal RECharging" [...] vehicle.|$|E
5000|$|An {{underwater}} glider {{is a type}} {{of autonomous}} underwater vehicle (AUV) that uses small changes in its buoyancy in order to move {{up and down in the}} ocean like a <b>profiling</b> <b>float.</b> Unlike a float, a glider uses wings to convert that vertical motion to horizontal, propelling itself forward with very low power consumption. While not as fast as conventional AUVs, gliders using buoyancy-based propulsion represent a significant increase in range and duration compared to vehicles propelled by electric motor-driven propellers, extending ocean sampling missions from hours to weeks or months, and to thousands of kilometers of range. Gliders follow an up-and-down, sawtooth-like profile through the water, providing data on temporal and spatial scales unavailable to previous AUVs, and much more costly to sample using traditional shipboard techniques. [...] A wide variety of glider designs are in use by Navy and ocean research organizations and typically cost US$100,000.|$|E
50|$|A {{handful of}} {{companies}} and organizations manufacture profiling floats {{used in the}} Argo program. APEX floats, made by Teledyne Webb Research, {{are the most common}} element of the current array. SOLO and SOLO-II floats (the latter use a reciprocating pump for buoyancy changes, unlike screw-driven pistons in other floats) were developed at Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Other types include the NINJA float, made by the Tsurumi Seiki Co. of Japan, and the PROVOR float developed by IFREMER in France. Most floats use sensors made by Sea-Bird Electronics, which also makes a <b>profiling</b> <b>float</b> called Navis. A typical Argo float is a cylinder just over 1 metre long and 14 cm across with a hemispherical cap. Thus it has a minimum volume of about 16,600 cubic centimetres (cm3). At Ocean Station Papa in the Gulf of Alaska the temperature and salinity at the surface might be about 6 °C and 32.55 parts per thousand giving a density of sea-water of 1.0256 g/cm3. At a depth of 2000 metres (pressure of 2000 decibars) the temperature might be 2 °C and the salinity 34.58 parts per thousand. Thus, including the effect of pressure (water is slightly compressible) the density of sea-water is about 1.0369 g/cm3. The change in density divided by the deep density is 0.0109.|$|E

Based on the float observations, together with altimeter data, we investigated water mass in the region and analyzed vertical structure of a cyclonic eddy, that advected the two floats from May through July 2000.

50|$|Argo is an {{international}} program that uses <b>profiling</b> <b>floats</b> to observe temperature, salinity, currents, and, recently, bio-optical properties in the Earth's oceans; it has been operational since the early 2000s. The real-time data it provides is used in climate and oceanographic research. A special research interest is to quantify the ocean heat content (OHC).|$|R
30|$|In situ {{observations}} made by autonomous oceanic profiling floats {{have been}} used to investigate the oceanic response to a typhoon in previous studies. Wada et al. (2009 b) found that vertical water temperature profiles obtained at 10 -day intervals were clearly affected by the passage of a typhoon and that the change was dependent on the position of the <b>profiling</b> <b>float</b> relative to the typhoon track. Baranowski et al. (2011) found that the passage of two consecutive typhoons, Hagupit and Jangmi, in 2008, caused changes in the oceanic mixed layer. The in situ observations that showed these changes were made by an autonomous oceanic <b>profiling</b> <b>float</b> operating on a cycle with a period of approximately 1  day, and the authors showed that more frequent profiling (at least once a day) is required to allow variations in the water temperature and salinity in the upper ocean caused by the passage of a TC to be studied.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the spatial and temporal variability (daily, seasonal and inter-annual) of CO 2 and O 2 air-sea fluxes and their underlying processes, a dense network of observations is required. For this purpose, the Cape Verde Ocean Observatory (CVOO) provides a unique infrastructure. Information thus obtained also links biological productivity and atmospheric composition. To expand these capabilities, a novel “virtual mooring” approach for high resolution measurements, based on a modified NEMO <b>profiling</b> <b>float,</b> is pursued. This <b>Profiling</b> <b>Float</b> was equipped with O 2 and pCO 2 sensors for the first time, in order to collect daily depth profiles (0 - 200 m) {{in the vicinity of}} the ocean site. Data access and remote control is provided through Iridium satellite telemetry. Recalibrations and redeployments are carried out every 1 - 3 month. First, we present the new developed instrument and the innovative in situ and real-time approach behind.

It is shown that the weight change of float by 1 gram makes around 10 m parking depth difference, although it keeps that depth stably {{in the case of}} tropical and sub-tropical Pacific Ocean. It is pointed out that the buoyancy (i. e. bladder volume) of present APEX type float is not adequate in a certain area of western equatorial Pacific and eastern tropical Indian Ocean.

These autonomous drifting vehicles typically have aluminum pressure cases on the order of one meter long, use a pump to inflate an external oil bladder to increase buoyancy, are capable of making a few hundred profiles to a maximum depth of 2000 meters before battery exhaustion, and transmit their data to shore via satellite communication; they weigh approximately 20 kg, and cost about $25,000 US without sensors. Deeper diving models that can reach 6000 meters have been made, deep enough to reach the ocean floor in most locations.

Only the third float showed a significant offset in salinity of about – 0. 02 psu, as expected from comparison between the float data and the shipboard conductivity-temperature-depth data.

40|$|The only {{method used}} to date to measure {{dissolved}} nitrate concentration (NITRATE) with sensors mounted on <b>profiling</b> <b>floats</b> {{is based on}} the absorption of light at ultraviolet wavelengths by nitrate ion (Johnson and Coletti, 2002; Johnson et al., 2010; 2013; D’Ortenzio et al., 2012). Nitrate has a modest UV absorption band with a peak near 210 nm, which overlaps with the stronger absorption band of bromide, which has a peak near 200 nm. In addition, there is a much weaker absorption due to dissolved organic matter and light scattering by particles (Ogura and Hanya, 1966). The UV spectrum thus consists of three components, bromide, nitrate and a background due to organics and particles. The background also includes thermal effects on the instrument and slow drift. All of these latter effects (organics, particles, thermal effects and drift) tend to be smooth spectra that combine to form an absorption spectrum that is linear in wavelength over relatively short wavelength spans. If the light absorption spectrum is measured in the wavelength range around 217 to 240 nm (the exact range {{is a bit of a}} decision by the operator), then the nitrate concentration can be determined. Two different instruments based on the same optical principles are in use for this purpose. The In Situ Ultraviolet Spectrophotometer (ISUS) built at MBARI or at Satlantic has been mounted inside the pressure hull of a Teledyne/Webb Research APEX and NKE Provor <b>profiling</b> <b>floats</b> and the optics penetrate through the upper end cap into the water. The Satlantic Submersible Ultraviolet Nitrate Analyzer (SUNA) is placed on the outside of APEX, Provor, and Navis <b>profiling</b> <b>floats</b> in its own pressure housing and is connected to the float through an underwater cable that provides power and communications. Power, communications between the float controller and the sensor, and data processing requirements are essentially the same for both ISUS and SUNA. There are several possible algorithms that can be used for the deconvolution of nitrate concentration from the observed UV absorption spectrum (Johnson and Coletti, 2002; Arai et al., 2008; Sakamoto et al., 2009; Zielinski et al., 2011). In addition, the default algorithm that is available in Satlantic sensors is a proprietary approach, but this is not generally used on <b>profiling</b> <b>floats.</b> There are some tradeoffs in every approach. To date almost all nitrate sensors on <b>profiling</b> <b>floats</b> have used the Temperature Compensated Salinity Subtracted (TCSS) algorithm developed by Sakamoto et al. (2009), and this document focuses on that method. It is likely that there will be further algorithm development and it is necessary that the data systems clearly identify the algorithm that is used. It is also desirable that the data system allow for recalculation of prior data sets using new algorithms. To accomplish this, the float must report not just the computed nitrate, but the observed light intensity. Then, the rule to obtain only one NITRATE parameter is, if the spectrum is present then, the NITRATE should be recalculated from the spectrum while the computation of nitrate concentration can also generate useful diagnostics of data quality...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2015 The {{production}} and consumption of oxygen during photosynthesis and respiration stoichiometrically links oxygen and organic carbon in the surface ocean. Oxygen sensors are currently being deployed on <b>profiling</b> <b>floats</b> throughout the ocean, which {{has the potential to}} greatly expand the extent of in situ oxygen measurements and our understanding of biological processes in the ocean. Inaccuracies in current oxygen sensors due to instrument drift currently limit the utility of these floats for estimating air-sea oxygen fluxes. This thesis describes in situ calibrations of oxygen sensors on <b>profiling</b> <b>floats</b> through atmospheric measurements and the use of this data towards understanding oxygen and organic carbon cycles in the Pacific. We deployed 12 modified Argo floats equipped with Aanderaa oxygen optodes in the Pacific: one at Ocean Station Papa (OSP) in the northeast Pacific, 10 in the Kuroshio Extension (KE), and one in the south subtropical Pacific near Samoa. Air oxygen measurements after each <b>float</b> <b>profile</b> were used to accurately calibrate the optodes and correct for drift observed in approximately ½ of the optodes over > 2 years. I interpret these oxygen data using two methods. At OSP, I developed a 1 -dimensional abiotic gas model for use with oxygen data to determine the annual net community production (ANCP). I found that summertime production was roughly balanced by wintertime net heterotrophy and that estimates of bubble-induced, air-sea exchange and diapycnal diffusion {{at the base of the}} mixed layer were important to interpretation of oxygen fluxes. In the KE I interpreted data from multiple floats to determine mean annual cycles of supersaturation and air-sea oxygen fluxes from biogeochemical regions. While the magnitude of the abiotic oxygen fluxes in winter is too high to quantify ANCP in this area, I calculated summertime {{production and}} winter subduction from the regional oxygen data. This work represents an improvement in our ability to remotely measure in situ oxygen and new methods of interpretation so that a global array of oxygen sensors on <b>profiling</b> <b>floats</b> can be used to quantify the marine oxygen and carbon cycles...|$|R
