25|$|Ottawa {{is home to}} a large Greenbelt {{circling}} the entire urban core. It was created as an attempt to limit sprawl and encourage density, with mixed success. The Greenbelt has remained largely intact, but Ottawa's newest suburbs such as Kanata, Barrhaven, and Orleans have jumped over the belt. The Greenbelt is increasingly becoming a wide avenue of green between two developed areas. Prior to amalgamation in 2000 the region was divided into several communities each with its own <b>planning</b> <b>guidelines</b> and the suburbs have distinct characters. Kanata is especially notable as developer Bill Teron's attempt to create a modern suburb embracing garden city principles.|$|E

25|$|If {{significant}} use of bicycles {{for shopping}} trips {{is to be}} achieved, sufficient retail services must be maintained within reasonable cycling distances of residential areas. In countries like Denmark, the Netherlands and Germany {{the high levels of}} utility cycling also includes shopping trips e.g. 9% of all shopping trips in Germany are by bicycle. It is arguable that this is related to policies that favour access to retail services by non-motorised modes. The Danish 1997 Planning Act requires that planning shall encourage a diverse mix of retail shops in small and medium-sized towns and in individual districts of large cities and ensure that retail trade uses will be placed in locations to which people have good access by walking, bicycling and public transport. From the mid-1970s the Netherlands has had policies in place to severely restrict the growth of large out-of-town retail developments. Germany has had federal planning regulations in place to restrict retail uses to designated areas since the 1960s. In addition, since the 1970s federal regulations have been in place specifying that developments above a certain size (1,200m²) be assessed regarding potential adverse effects. These federal regulations are further strengthened by regionally adopted regulations. This includes regulations specifying that new retail centres be limited to selling products not readily provided by shops at inner city/town centre locations. In Denmark, the Netherlands, and Germany, this approach not restricted to <b>planning</b> <b>guidelines</b> and is also supported by a ban on below cost selling. This supports smaller shops by preventing large multiples from engaging in predatory pricing practices by aggressively discounting key goods to use as so called loss leaders.|$|E

The “ http://nwra.ie/the-study-of-outdoor-recreation-in-the-west/ (2014)” stated: “The Regional <b>Planning</b> <b>Guidelines</b> (RPGs) for the West Region 2010-2022 seek the full reinstatement of the Western Rail Corridor as a long-term strategic sustainable transport route. Greenways are not mentioned in the RPGs, though the development of suitable long-distance walking and cycling routes (subject to environmental assessment) are supported. It is not the purpose of the Regional <b>Planning</b> <b>Guidelines</b> to see such routes provided at the expense of long-term strategic infrastructure so it is critical that the goals are not hampered even in the short term particularly when other more suitable greenway options could be explored taking account of environmental, social and economic considerations.” ...|$|E

Data werecollected by conducting in-depth interview and observation. Content analysis was applied in thedata management. Results of the study showed that drug planning at GFK Gunung Mas was inadequate. This wascaused by insufficient number of workers with adequate abilities, and the obedience of workers inimplementing <b>planning</b> <b>guideline</b> was insufficient.

[...] According to a multiple award winning City of Toronto study the building is a good precedent of a context sensitive and well-massed mid-rise building.

2500|$|The {{history of}} Leipziger Platz has been {{inextricably}} linked {{with that of}} its neighbour almost since its creation. Yet their respective stories have in many ways been very different. The future Potsdamer Platz was most definitely outside Berlin, and therefore {{not subject to the}} <b>planning</b> <b>guidelines</b> and constraints that would normally be expected in a city keen to show itself off as the capital of an empire. It grew very rapidly in a piecemeal and haphazard way, and came to epitomise wildness and excess in a manner that contributed much to its legendary status. Leipziger Platz however, was inside the city (and had a name almost a century before its neighbour did), and always had an orderly, disciplined look about it. After all, it had been planned and built all in one go by Johann Philipp Gerlach. [...] One late 18th-century artistic depiction shows a range of buildings relentless in their uniformity. Indeed, this, together with the grid pattern of the streets, is what one would expect in Prussia’s chief garrison city. One writer of the time said that a stroll round Friedrichstadt was like walking round military barracks. In this respect the Potsdam Gate was a dividing line between two different worlds. It was not until later on that many of these buildings began to be replaced by important historical palaces and aristocratic mansions.|$|E

The study applied normative study. The type of law material in the study are primary law material and secondary law material. Method of collecting data used by the writer is literary study. Method of law material analysis used in the study is qualitative research, which reveals and comprehends the truth of problems as well as analyzes by interpret the data. The conclusion of this study shows that first, the establishment of medium term plan of Mamuju regency is not totally implement the regional development <b>plan</b> <b>guidelines</b> as arranged in Domestic Minister Regulation in regional development sector although its arrangement had referred to medium term plan of West Sulawesi Province. Second, the implication of regional development plan that is not relevant to the guidelines as arranged in Domestic Minister Regulation Number 54 Year 2010 is able to be reviewed and cancelled trough the judicial review procedure of Supreme Court and also possible to be evaluated by the Government as the executor of supervision function as well as evaluation of regional regulation product.

40|$|In many {{application}} areas, including <b>planning,</b> workflow, <b>guidelines</b> and protocol management, {{the description}} of the domain requires the use of part-of relations between events, the modeling of periodic repetitions and the treatment of “standard ” temporal constraints between such events.

We first sketch a representation formalism coping with partof and instance-of relations, periodicity and temporal constraints, and then we describe two algorithms to deal with inheritance and to perform temporal consistency checking. 1...|$|R
