Aflatoxin, a potent poison that contaminates groundnut and other crops, is very common but difficult to detect. A sample survey by ICRISAT researchers in Andhra Pradesh examined the extent of aflatoxin contamination in groundnuts, chilies and various spices (ginger, black pepper, turmeric and coriander). The results revealed that a frighteningly large number of groundnut byproducts like chikkies (<b>peanut</b> <b>crunch</b> candy) were contaminated...|$|E

50|$|The short {{begins as}} a typical Mickey cartoon of the time, but is set apart from all that had come before by the {{inclusion}} of a new character, whose behavior served as a running gag.

500|$|The Arizona Daily Star {{highlighted}} {{the book in}} their [...] "Hot Reads" [...] section. Assistant Texas Taste Editor for The Dallas Morning News Laura H.

50|$|For {{preparation}} of Dragon's Beard Candy, the preparer must initially boil and melt the saturated maltose solution (which may include sugar or corn syrup) for 5 minutes until thickened, followed by leaving {{the mixture to}} chill for 10 minutes until a solid state is reached. This resulting solid, which is somewhat flexible or elastic, is then formed into a torus. Next, the preparer must take the gooey sugar, corn syrup, or sugar cane based gel and dip it into the sugar dough. Thirdly, the gooey chunk must be shaped into a ring resembling a doughnut, the key feature being the large hole. This step must by followed by repeatedly pulling, twisting, stretching, and folding the dough over on itself, doubling the number of strands created after each repetition. While the candy is being folded, it is recommended to keep the dough covered in toasted glutinous flour {{to prevent it from}} sticking to surfaces. The dough must then be stretched into paper-thin strands, where each strand should be three to four inches long. Then, the strands should be tangled into a circular shape, and dipped into corn flour to keep the strands from sticking together. Finally, the ring should be cut into small pieces and wrapped around crushed <b>peanuts,</b> sesame seeds, <b>crunched</b> chocolate, or coconut inside. Specific Dragon's Beard Candy filling depends on several factors, such as region, purpose, and respective chef.|$|R
50|$|Goofy first {{appeared}} in Mickey's Revue, first released on May 25, 1932. Directed by Wilfred Jackson this short movie features Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Horace Horsecollar and Clarabelle Cow performing another song and dance show. Mickey and his gang's animated shorts by this point routinely featured song and dance numbers. It begins as a typical Mickey cartoon of the time, but what would set this short apart from all that had come before was {{the appearance of a}} new character, whose behavior served as a running gag. Dippy Dawg, as he was named by Disney artists (Frank Webb), {{was a member of the}} audience. He constantly irritated his fellow spectators by noisily <b>crunching</b> <b>peanuts</b> and laughing loudly, till two of those fellow spectators knocked him out with their mallets (and then did the same exact laugh as he did). This early version of Goofy had other differences with the later and more developed ones besides the name. He was an old man with a white beard, a puffy tail and no trousers, shorts, or undergarments. But the short introduced Goofy's distinct laughter. This laughter was provided by Pinto Colvig. A considerably younger Dippy Dawg then appeared in The Whoopee Party, first released on September 17, 1932, as a party guest and a friend of Mickey and his gang. Dippy Dawg made a total of four appearances in 1932 and two more in 1933, but most of them were mere cameos.|$|R
