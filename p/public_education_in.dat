This was an important first step in the creation of nondenominational schools. When James McGill died in 1813 his bequest was administered by the RIAL.|$|E

5|$|Early <b>public</b> <b>education</b> <b>in</b> Meridian {{was based}} on the 1870 Mississippi Constitution. From 1870 to 1885, {{trustees}} appointed by the City Council served on the Board of School Directors, which had authority to operate the schools. Although there were several schools in the city before 1884, they were privately owned and only enrolled about 400 students. The city did not build its first publicly owned school until September 1884. The first public school for blacks in the city was held in facilities rented from St. Paul Methodist Church. The Mississippi Legislature amended the city charter in January 1888 to allow the city to maintain its own municipal school district, and in March of the same year $30,000 in bonds was approved for the city to build new public schools. From this bond, the Wechsler School was built in 1894, becoming the first brick public school building in the state built for blacks.|$|E
