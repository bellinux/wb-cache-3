50|$|<b>Participation</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> is {{strictly}} voluntary.

After being vaccinated, volunteers were asked to receive HIV testing every six months for three years, as well as receive additional risk-behavior counseling at every testing visit.|$|E
30|$|Several {{limitations}} {{should be}} noted for this research. First, although all subjects included <b>in</b> <b>the</b> development and evaluation of the UC-PRO/SS were required to have clinician-confirmed UC based on biopsy, baseline endoscopy was not required for <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>studies.</b> Thus, it is unclear if subjects were experiencing active inflammation of the colon or rectal mucosa {{at the time of}} their participation. Second, the duration of <b>the</b> <b>study</b> was relatively short, limiting information on <b>the</b> variability <b>in</b> UC disease over time, and none of the participants experienced an acute flare up of their condition, thus limiting the data on change, including worsening and improvement. Finally, this was an observational study and not an interventional clinical trial, precluding responsiveness analyses, including tests of sensitivity to change with treatment. Further research is needed to replicate the results presented here in new samples and to determine score sensitivity to change over time with flares and treatment.|$|R

50|$|People with PD, their friends, {{and their}} family members all have many reasons to {{consider}} participating in clinical research.

Without clinical research participants, many of the advances in treating PD would not have happened. In addition to furthering the scientific community’s knowledge of Parkinson’s, clinical trial participation may offer access to leading healthcare professionals and potentially useful new drugs and therapies. This care is often provided free of charge in exchange for <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>study.</b> Finally, by participating in clinical studies, those whose lives are impacted by PD may increase knowledge and understanding of the disease.|$|E

Over two decades ago the Genetics Perspectives editors solicited a perspective on my <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>studies</b> that deciphered <b>the</b> mechanism of mating-type switching and revealed the phenomenon of gene silencing in yeast.

Now realizing that our discovery of the transposition of a mutation from the HMα locus into the MAT (mating type) locus has provided the genetic evidence that established the gene transposition model, and having witnessed our conclusions confirmed by subsequent molecular studies, I decided that perhaps {{this is a good time}} to recount the chronology of events as they unfolded for me decades ago...|$|R

CHEERS protocols may have provided for intervention with subjects where technicians discovered use of pesticides inconsistent with product label directions, although EPA has never publicly produced the research protocol submitted to an Institutional Review Board (IRB). However, EPA has canceled residential use of some of the pesticides CHEERS was to study, based on potential harm to infants and children. CHEERS made no provision for informing subjects of risks associated with continued residential use of those pesticides.|$|E
50|$|In 2014, CCR Analytics {{published}} {{the results of}} their study of 49,467 children assessed in the 2012-2013 school year from 81 Head Start programs throughout the state of California (more than 50% of the entire California Head Start population). <b>Participation</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> was open to all California Head Start programs who used the DRDP-PS 2010 assessment tool. The study found that providing two years of Head Start to a child increases the probability by between 13% to 86% that the child will meet age appropriate expectations. Regression discontinuity design was used to measure program impact without denying a control group the opportunity to attend Head Start. The analysis compared three-year-olds enrolled in Head Start to four-year-olds who returned to Head Start for their second year. This also eliminated the issue of selection bias because both groups chose to attend Head Start as three-year-olds.|$|E

50|$|As the Tuskegee Syphilis Study {{raised a}} host of issues about racism, Dibble’s {{participation}} and encouragement of the study has been highly controversial, especially from his standing as a Black physician. The very premise {{of the study was}} {{based on the assumption that}} African Americans would not seek treatment for syphilis and that the disease affected them differently than other races. Another source of controversy arises from the degree of black cooperation in the study, which to this day, remains unclear. Although Dibble understood the nature of the experiment and supported it, there is evidence that some blacks who assisted in the study were not aware of the true nature of the experiment. However, many such as Fred Gray, a legal post who had been counsel to the Tuskegee Institute, supported Dibble and objected to holding Dibble accountable for the controversial events of the Tuskegee Syphilis Study, arguing that Dibble was just as much a victim as the participants. His argument was based upon class divisions, and he argued that because black institutions relied heavily upon funding from white philanthropy, they could not afford to object to the US government for <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>study.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{research}} and publication standard of the APA ethical standards is developed to highlight {{research and}} publication ethics that psychologists {{are expected to}} adhere to. This standard emphasizes the necessity of approval by the institute prior to carrying out the research, providing accurate information about the research study, and carrying out the research {{in accordance with the}} approval. When obtaining informed consent, details of the study should be presented to the participants, including but not limited to, the objective of the study, the procedures, benefits and potential risks associated with the study, and the participants' right to decline to participate and withdraw from the study without any penalty. However, studies which are not expected to cause any harm, such as observing in a naturalistic environment, using anonymous questionnaires, or if permitted by the law, informed consent may not be necessary to be obtained. Compensation for participation should not be used to persuade an unwilling participant. At the conclusion of the study, each participant should be presented with a summary of the study and the participant should be provided with an opportunity to ask any questions he/she has. Further, if there has been some harm caused to the participant due to <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>study,</b> necessary steps should be followed to minimize the harm. This standard also provides guidelines and instructions on animal research. Psychologists are responsible for reporting accurate findings and taking necessary steps to correct any errors in research and publication. Psychologists are also required to only present original data as their work and share publication credits based on the contributions rather than authority. Psychologists are also expected to be willing to share research data when required for verification, and maintain confidentiality of the participants during the review process.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Tuskegee Syphilis <b>Study</b> spurred outrage for its mis{{treatment}} {{and denial}} of treatment of blacks, and many {{questions have been}} raised for the participation of black physicians such as Dibble. It has been suggested that their participation could also be accounted due to class divisions between black physicians and the black community. Black, upper-middle class physicians did not identify themselves with the poor black community. Therefore, their <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> syphilis <b>study</b> was an attempt to prove to the white medical community of their capability in medical research.|$|R
