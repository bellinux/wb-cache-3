5|$|Western jackdaws entreat their <b>partners</b> <b>to</b> preen them {{by showing}} their nape and ruffling their head feathers. Birds mainly preen each other's head and neck. Known as allopreening, this {{behaviour}} {{is almost always}} done between birds of a mated pair.|$|E

50|$|In {{some cases}} {{multiple}} spots {{may be used}} during a turn. For example, during a Salsa cross-body lead with inside turn, the lady spots away from her <b>partner</b> <b>to</b> control travel and then spots on her <b>partner</b> <b>to</b> control the stop of rotation.|$|R
5|$|Birth {{control is}} another consideration: women with SCI {{are usually not}} {{prescribed}} oral contraceptives since the hormones in them {{increase the risk of}} blood clots, for which people with SCI are already at elevated risk. Intrauterine devices could have dangerous complications that could go undetected if sensation is reduced. Diaphrams that require something to be inserted into the vagina are not usable by people with poor hand function. An option of choice for women is for <b>partners</b> <b>to</b> use condoms.|$|E
5|$|In July 2013 the Sevenstone project, which {{aimed to}} {{demolish}} and rebuild {{a large part}} of the city centre, and had been on hold since 2009, was further delayed and the company developing it was dropped. The city council is looking for <b>partners</b> <b>to</b> take a new version of the plan forwards. In April 2014 the council, together with Sheffield University, proposed a plan to reduce the blight of empty shops in the city centre by offering them free of charge to small businesses on a month-by-month basis.|$|E
5|$|It was {{a serious}} {{allegation}} to make against a physician. Reich wrote in his diary that the mother had been attracted to him and had made the allegation to damage him. She later committed suicide and Reich blamed himself. If Kahn did have an abortion, Turner wrote, {{she was the first}} of four of Reich's <b>partners</b> <b>to</b> do so: his first wife had several, and his long-term partners Elsa Lindenberg and Ilse Ollendorf (his second wife) each had one at Reich's insistence.|$|E

5|$|Most Lodges {{have some}} sort of social calendar, {{allowing}} Masons and their <b>partners</b> <b>to</b> meet in a less ritualised environment. Often coupled with these events is the obligation placed on every Mason to contribute to charity. This occurs at both Lodge and Grand Lodge level. Masonic charities contribute to many field, such as education or disaster relief.|$|E
5|$|Smithers {{declares}} {{his love}} for Mr. Burns after he saves Burns' life in a skydiving accident, but Burns reaffirms his contempt for him. Angry, Smithers treats Homer, Lenny and Carl harshly, so they determine finding Smithers a boyfriend will ease the ill-treatment. They invite potential <b>partners</b> <b>to</b> meet Smithers at a gay men's singles' party, where a neck massage from Julio snaps Smithers out of his bad mood. The two fall in love, and Smithers leaves {{his job at the}} power plant.|$|E
5|$|The {{project was}} {{cancelled}} in June 1967, when the French Government withdrew from participation. However, the cancellation {{was not the}} end of work on the proposed design. BAC modified the specification to solely satisfy Royal Air Force (RAF) needs, reconfiguring the design as the UKVG and sought out new <b>partners</b> <b>to</b> procure the aircraft, which ultimately emerged as the Anglo-German-Italian consortium-funded MRCA (Panavia Tornado), a variable-geometry wing fighter/strike aircraft.|$|E

5|$|Bednar {{was hired}} by the Canadian National Exhibition in 1998, during a period during a period where both the CNEA and Exhibition Place grounds had low {{profitability}} or were losing money. The CNEA made just $70,000 in 1997. He said he was being paid less than his predecessor, Bryan Tisdall, who was one of five departing executives that the CNEA and Exhibition Place grounds made large severance payments to. When Bednar joined, the 1998 fair was already planned, and he would not comment on its future direction. The following year, CNE started promoting its events on weekends, which there was previously a policy against. The change in policy allowed corporate <b>partners</b> <b>to</b> offer discounted or free ticket promotions. This led to a 7 percent increase in admissions, but a large reduction in revenues. According to a city councillor on the CNEA board, the crowding and traffic of the event discouraged potential customers from continuing to visit the event in the final week.|$|E
5|$|Born {{and raised}} in the Austrian Empire, Tesla {{received}} an advanced education in engineering and physics in the 1870s and gained practical experience in the early 1880s working in telephony and at Continental Edison in the new electric power industry. He emigrated to the United States in 1884, where he would become a naturalized citizen. He worked for a short time at the Edison Machine Works in New York City before he struck out on his own. With the help of <b>partners</b> <b>to</b> finance and market his ideas, Tesla set up laboratories and companies in New York to develop a range of electrical and mechanical devices. His alternating current (AC) induction motor and related polyphase AC patents, licensed by Westinghouse Electric in 1888, earned him a considerable amount of money and became the cornerstone of the polyphase system which that company would eventually market.|$|E
5|$|Butthole Surfers did {{not seek}} to replace her at the time, and opted to {{continue}} as a quartet. Following a final EP for Touch and Go—1989's Widowermaker—the band left their longtime recording <b>partners</b> <b>to</b> sign with longtime supporter Terry Tolkin at Rough Trade Records who had also brought them to Touch and Go, for a reportedly generous one-album deal. Prior to the new LP's debut, Rough Trade talked the band into first releasing 1990s The Hurdy Gurdy Man, which previewed material from the coming release. The same year, Rough Trade issued Digital Dump by The Jackofficers, Haynes and Pinkus's psychedelic house music side project.|$|E

5|$|Dio {{maintains}} that one purpose for Caracalla issuing the edict was {{the desire to}} increase state revenue; at the time, Rome was in a difficult financial situation and needed {{to pay for the}} new pay raises and benefits that were being conferred on the military. The edict widened the obligation for public service and gave increased revenue through the inheritance and emancipation taxes that only had to be paid by Roman citizens. The provincials also benefited from this edict because they were now able {{to think of themselves as}} equal <b>partners</b> <b>to</b> the Romans in the empire. However, few of those that gained citizenship were wealthy, and while it is true that Rome was in a difficult financial situation, it is thought that this could not have been the sole purpose of the edict.|$|E
5|$|During the 1960s, {{aeronautical}} designers {{looked to}} variable-geometry wing designs {{to gain the}} manoeuvrability and efficient cruise of straight wings {{with the speed of}} swept wing designs. The United Kingdom had cancelled the procurement of the TSR-2 and subsequent F-111K aircraft, and was still looking for a replacement for its Avro Vulcan and Blackburn Buccaneer strike aircraft. Britain and France had initiated the AFVG (Anglo French Variable Geometry) project in 1965, but this had ended with French withdrawal in 1967. Britain continued to develop a variable-geometry aircraft similar to the proposed AFVG, and sought new <b>partners</b> <b>to</b> achieve this.|$|E
5|$|Following {{a meeting}} with {{attorneys}} on May 10, 1961 intended to resolve the dispute, Dave Guard resigned from the Kingston Trio, though pledging to fulfill group commitments through November of that year. Shane, Reynolds, and Werber bought out Guard's interest in the partnership for $300,000 to be paid {{over a number of}} years and moved to replace him immediately. The remaining Trio partners settled quickly on John Stewart, a 21-year-old member of the Cumberland Three, one of the myriad of groups that sprang up hoping to imitate the Kingston Trio's success. Stewart was already well-acquainted with Reynolds and Shane, having sold two of his early songwriting efforts to the Trio, and he was a proficient guitarist, banjoist, and singer who seemed to the <b>partners</b> <b>to</b> be perfectly positioned to replace Guard. Stewart began rehearsing and recording with the group nearly immediately, commencing public appearances with the Trio in September 1961.|$|E
