40|$|In {{the last}} years laser-induced {{breakdown}} spectroscopy was introduced in various industrial applications. Automated inspection machines were developed capable to operate under harsh ambient conditions. As an example laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy-based inspection machines for the identification testing of fittings and tubes made of high-alloy steel will be presented. Within an inspection time of 2 seconds 100 spectra are gained yielding the signals of 12 elemental lines to identify more than 30 different high-alloy steel grades {{in order to prevent}} material mix-ups {{at the end of a}} production line prior to <b>packaging</b> <b>and</b> <b>dispatch.</b> More than 1. 5 million products have been inspected within the last 5 years in routine operation. Requirements, concepts and design of such machines will be discussed considering the issues on analytical resolution and system monitoring. For the first time a data set of more than 10 (exp 8) laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy measurements has become available, giving insight into the long-term behavior of the system performance. First evaluations of this data demonstrate the influence of laser power, sample position and temperature on the spectroscopic signals and the system state. Future demands on next-generation inspection machines based on laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy will be defined...|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{productivity}} by {{minimizing the}} defects {{is of utmost}} importance to any steel industry. Cold Rolling Mill plays {{a very important role}} due to its very complex processes and the products end use. Deliverance of high quality product to the customer, relentlessly understanding their requirement and regular feedback became the basis for working on this project. During the process where a coil from Hot Strip Mill (HSM) goes into the Pickling Line to Cold Rolling Mill to Batch Annealing to Final <b>Packaging</b> <b>and</b> <b>Dispatch</b> amidst various other processes, it acquires various defects that need to be catered before delivery to the customer. Some defects can be minimized through improvement in maintenance and some are inherent (where CRM is a customer). The aim of the project is form a quantitative comparative study with the help of profilometer analysis of Raw CRCA, Phospotised CRCA, and Painted CRCA of stainless steel samples. On the basis of comparison, one will be able to conclude upto what severity a particular defect will be passed. Among the various defects analyzed by profilometer, the Lamination & Gouge Mark are the most severed defects. The difference in total roughness obtained between defected and non-defected area after 1 st layer of painting was the order of 5 – 40 µm for Lamination & 8 – 10 µm for Gouge mark. This shows that these defects are highly prone to customer complaints and often goes for rejection. The difference upto 1 µm are passed without much scrutiny. Anything beyond 1 µm difference calls for action by both manufacturer & customer...|$|E

40|$|Clay brick is {{the most}} common {{construction}} material used in the historical buildings of Diyarbakır (Turkey). Many clay brick manufacturing workshops and numerous brick masters have emerged. Diyarbakir currently has two clay brick workshops that face the problem of being closed down. Therefore, manufacturing of clay brick by traditional methods may be forgotten in Diyarbakir. This study investigates the manufacturing phases of traditional clay bricks in Diyarbakir׳s local workshops, which have not been documented. The manufacturing phases of the clay bricks in Diyarbakır were examined for the first time based on in-situ observations, investigations, and interviews. The research indicated the general phases of clay brick manufacturing. Raw materials are first prepared, formed, and dried. The firing of clay bricks is then performed through hacking, heating, burning, cooling, and de-hacking. The clay bricks are finally <b>packaged</b> <b>and</b> <b>dispatched.</b> The traditional manufacturing of clay brick methods in Diyarbakır is similar in many regions of the world. The clay bricks are currently and extensively used in the restoration of historic structures. Therefore, their production must be continuous...|$|R
50|$|Management of {{warehousing}} {{was another}} factor. Originally each production department {{had its own}} warehousing arrangements but this seems to have led to difficulties. To overcome these difficulties the Company {{had set up a}} 'Logistics' department in 1990. Though its area of responsibilities is not made clear in the HSE Report, it seems reasonable to assume that the chief responsibilities of the department were (1) receiving and storing raw materials, (2) storing, <b>packaging</b> <b>and</b> <b>dispatching</b> finished materials, (3) transporting raw materials from store to the point of production and (4) for taking finished chemicals from the point of production into store. It seems also to have had the responsibility for transporting and storing some intermediate products. The magnitude of these operations was disclosed by the 125 people employed in the department. However none of those employed in the Logistics department was qualified in chemistry. This was no doubt the reason why the errors in the classification of AZDN was not noticed. Nor was anyone in the Logistics department qualified in safety.|$|R

5000|$|Note, however, {{addresses}} in [...] for , , etc., are {{two or more}} bytes, {{compared to}} one byte, typically, for the decode <b>and</b> <b>dispatch</b> interpreter described above. In general, instructions for a decode <b>and</b> <b>dispatch</b> interpreter may be any size.

However, bytecoded systems typically choose 1-byte codes for the most-common operations. Thus, the thread often has a higher space cost than bytecodes.
