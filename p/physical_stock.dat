25|$|In the {{economic}} and technological circumstances of the time such an entrepôt (or to use the Dutch term: stapelmarkt) fulfilled important functions. The word has connotations of a duty-free port, but in an economic sense, a stapelmarkt {{was a place where}} commodities were temporarily physically stocked for future reexport. This was viable because of a legal monopoly for stockpiling a single commodity (wool), granted by a political ruler (like the staple ports designated by the kings of England in medieval times), but also more generally because of technical and economic reasons that still give certain advantages to a spoke-hub distribution paradigm. An important ancillary function of such a <b>physical</b> <b>stock</b> of commodities is that it makes it easier for merchants to even out supply fluctuations, and hence to control price gyrations in thin and volatile markets. Finally, where a physical market forms, market information can more easily be gathered. This was actually the most important economic function of a stapelmarkt in the primitive circumstances of the late 16th century.|$|E

2500|$|Now {{that more}} {{is known about}} the trends in {{empirical}} measures of profitability, the debate focuses more on the underlying concepts. Simon Mohun states that the rate of profit is [...] "most easily measured as the proportion of net output not returned as wages to the aggregate fixed capital stock" [...] and that it is this rate of profit that is [...] "generally used in empirical work". If the growth of the gross profit component of value-added (P) is statistically compared with the growth of the estimated fixed capital stock plus inventory holdings (C), it is certainly true that almost all measures will show that the ratio P/C does drop over time. The real value of the physical capital stock appears to grow faster in real terms than the real value of the operating surplus associated with that <b>physical</b> <b>stock,</b> in the long run. The same effect persists even when various different depreciation techniques are used. The data trend is analogous to a rising tendency of the capital coefficient, where in the course of time more and more capital is required to obtain each additional increase in output. The profit rate rises again, only after a major crisis or a war which destroys a sufficiently large amount of capital value, raises the rate of surplus value, and clears the way for new production techniques.|$|E
50|$|Securities {{clearing}} {{was required}} to ensure payment had been received and the <b>physical</b> <b>stock</b> certificate delivered. This caused a few days delay between the trade date and final settlement. To reduce the risk associated with failure to deliver on the trade on settlement date, a clearing agent or clearing house often sat between the trading parties. The trading parties would deliver the <b>physical</b> <b>stock</b> certificate and the payment to the clearing house, who would then ensure the certificate was handed over and the payment complete. This process is known as delivery versus payment.|$|E

This paper is an attempt {{to examine the effects of}} a change in fertility rates on population structure, labor supply, and employment in relation to <b>physical</b> capital <b>stock</b> for the next four decades. This study also evaluates the effects of a possible reversal change in fertility rates on the variables mentioned above. The study is carried out in three stages. In the first stage, population of Turkey is projected with Leslie matrix defined by age-specific fertility rates and survival rates. Projections are repeated for different fertility rates. In the second stage, <b>physical</b> capital <b>stock</b> per employed person is forecasted using time series data. In the third stage, the predictions obtained through the first two stages are combined. Thus, the question of what should be the warranted growth rates of <b>physical</b> capital <b>stock</b> in order to employ labor force projected under different fertility rates is answered. According to the results, increases in fertility rates lead to an increase in labor supply with a 15 year lag, even if fertility rates have remained unchanged in their current level.

40|$|There is {{a growing}} {{understanding}} of the biophysical processes that regulate {{the stability of the}} Earth-system, yet human pressures on the planet continue to increase rapidly. Here, recent advances in defining Earth-system thresholds using the planetary boundaries framework are translated down to national and sub-national levels. A set of 10 indicators is developed in a biophysical accounting framework that links the sustainability of resource flows from the biosphere to final consumption. The indicator set includes three measures of <b>physical</b> <b>stocks,</b> three measures of aggregate resource consumption, and four indicators of sustainable scale. The four scale indicators are ratios of (i) cumulative carbon footprint relative to carbon budget, (ii) nutrient use relative to biogeochemical boundaries, (iii) blue water consumption relative to monthly basin-level availability, and (iv) land footprint relative to biocapacity. Taken together, the indicators measure how close high-consuming societies are to meeting the conditions of a “steady-state economy”, defined here as an economy with non-growing <b>physical</b> <b>stocks</b> and flows maintained within shares of planetary boundaries. The framework is applied over a 15 -year period to the economies of Canada and Spain, along with two sub-national regions (Nova Scotia and Andalusia). Nova Scotia is the only study site experiencing stable or decreasing biophysical stocks and flows. None of the study sites are consuming resources within their shares of all four planetary boundaries. Overall, the set of indicators provides guidance for prioritizing which environmental pressures need to decline (and by how much) for societies to be more effective stewards of Earth-system stability...|$|R

If human or <b>physical</b> <b>stocks</b> are sufficiently low, the model shows that an economy can be caught in a fertility-caused poverty trap, while countries with more resources will converge to a balanced growth path where the average transmission of human capital from parents to childern determines the long-run rate of output growth. genetics; siblings; growth; fertility; human capital...|$|R

40|$|Stock is {{the goods}} the company buys in the {{objective}} of reselling. Stock becomes an important part for either trading or manufacturing company.

From the research conducted by the author on UNS KPRI, it can be found that there has no been a separation of purchasing and storing functions.

The <b>stock</b> <b>physical</b> calculation is only done once by the calculation committee consisting of all storekeeper of UNS KPRI including accounting and purchasing divisions that actually become the target of examination or management.

One reason is that spending does not measure efficiency (Hulten 1996). This issue is presented in Winston (1991) where he reviews the USA’ spending on roads with inefficient prices and concludes that investment should be reduced. Some of these inefficiency issues or distinct pricing may be related to possible acts of corruption surrounding the project (Pritchett 1996).|$|R

Then we explore a number of subsequent studies that use panel data covering the period between 1992 and 2004. An investigation was done to compare developed countries and developing countries. Results indicate that physical units are positively and significantly related to economic growth.
