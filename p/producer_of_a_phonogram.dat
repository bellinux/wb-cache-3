Accordingly, for example, as for phonograms, not only producers but also performers such as singers who performed in the phonograms exclusively shall {{have the right to}} make transmittable. As a result, to upload such phonograms on internet, it is necessary to obtain permission from all of the relevant parties who are provided with the right to make transmittable under the Copyright Act <b>of</b> Japan, including <b>producers</b> and performers who contributed to creation of the phonograms. However, it is practically very difficult since the number of such parties can be enormous. As a result, it is criticized that such legal system prevents Japanese online content business from further developing by making fewer works practically available for such business.|$|R

About 80 % of Chinese characters are <b>phonograms,</b> containing <b>a</b> semantic radical {{that provides a}} clue to the meaning of the character and a phonetic radical providing {{a clue to the}} pronunciation (e. g. 趾 zi 2 ‘toe’ has a semantic radical 足meaning ‘foot’ and a phonetic radical 止 zi 2).

The current study examined the sensitivity to and time course of two measures of orthography-phonology mapping [...] phonological regularity and consistency [...] for relatively proficient L 2 readers of Chinese. Most Chinese characters are <b>phonograms,</b> which have <b>a</b> phonetic radical that carries phonological information.
