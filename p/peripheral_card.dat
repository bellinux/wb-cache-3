40|$|One of the {{susceptibility}} {{genes in}} Crohn’s disease (CD) is CARD 15. Our {{study examined the}} relationship between <b>peripheral</b> <b>CARD</b> 15 expression and phenotype and duration of CD, treatment methods and inflammatory indices. Sixty patients with CD and 30 healthy volunteers as controls were enrolled in the study. Total RNA was isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with E. Z. N. A. Total RNA Kit (Omega Bio-tek) then quantitative real-time PCR was performed on the ABI Prism 7900 HT Real-Time PCR System. CARD 15 gene expression in PBMCs in CD was significantly higher than in the control group. The highest level of gene expression was found in CD patients in the fourth decade of life. The mRNA level of the CARD 15 gene was higher in patients with disease duration between 12 and 60 months. A positive correlation was found between erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and gene expression level. Gene expression increased with increasing level of C-reactive protein and ESR, but it was not statistically significant. CARD 15 expression significantly decreased in CD patients treated with anti-TNFα agents compared to azathioprine or steroid treatment groups. Expression of the CARD 15 gene in Crohn›s disease is higher than in healthy individuals.

40|$|Current copper {{backplane}} {{technology has}} reached the technical limits of clock speed and width for systems requiring multiple boards. Currently, bus technology such as VME and PCI (types of buses) will face severe limitations are the bus speed approaches 100 MHz. At this speed, the physical length limit of an unterminated bus is barely three inches. Terminating the bus enables much higher clock rates but at drastically higher power cost. Sandia has developed high bandwidth parallel optical interconnects that can provide over 40 Gbps throughput between circuit boards in a system. Based on Sandia's unique VCSEL (Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Laser) technology, these devices are compatible with CMOS (Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor) chips and have single channel bandwidth in excess of 20 GHz. In this project, we are researching {{the use of this}} interconnect scheme as the physical layer of a greater ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) based backplane. There are several advantages to this technology including small board space, lower power and non-contact communication. This technology is also easily expandable to meet future bandwidth requirements in excess of 160 Gbps sometimes referred to as UTOPIA 6. ATM over optical backplane will enable automatic switching of wide high-speed circuits between boards in a system. In the first year we developed integrated VCSELs and receivers, identified fiber ribbon based interconnect scheme and a high level architecture.

50|$|The S-100 bus or Altair bus, IEEE696-1983 (withdrawn), was {{an early}} {{computer}} bus designed in 1974 {{as a part of}} the Altair 8800.

S-100 computers, consisting of processor and <b>peripheral</b> <b>cards,</b> were produced by a number of manufacturers. The S-100 bus formed the basis for homebrew computers whose builders (e.g., the Homebrew Computer Club) implemented drivers for CP/M and MP/M.

5000|$|The eight {{expansion}} slots {{were the same}} as the model 5150 but were spaced closer together. Although rare, a card designed for the 5150 could be wide enough to obstruct the adjacent slot in an XT. [...] Because of the spacing, an XT motherboard would not fit into a case designed for the PC motherboard, but the slots and <b>peripheral</b> <b>cards</b> were compatible. The XT expansion bus (later called [...] "8 bit Industry Standard Architecture" [...] (ISA) by competitors) was retained in the IBM AT, which added connectors for some slots to allow 16-bit transfers; 8 bit cards could be used in an AT.|$|R
50|$|Designed {{to connect}} <b>peripheral</b> <b>cards</b> to the motherboard, ISA allows for bus {{mastering}} although {{only the first}} 16 MB of main memory are available for direct access. The 8-bit bus ran at 4.77 MHz (the clock speed of the IBM PC and IBM PC/XT's 8088 CPU), while the 16-bit bus operated at 6 or 8 MHz (because the 80286 CPUs in IBM PC/AT computers ran at 6 MHz in early models and 8 MHz in later models.) IBM RT/PC also used the 16-bit bus. It was also available on some non-IBM compatible machines such as Motorola 68k-based Apollo (68020) and Amiga 3000 (68030) workstations, the short-lived AT&T Hobbit and later PowerPC based BeBox.|$|R
