40|$|The Waitakaruru Arboretum and Sculpture Park {{is located}} on the Waikato-side of a border that {{separates}} the Waikato and Matamata-Piako district council areas. The arboretum {{can be found at the}} southern end of the Waikato/Matamata-Piako border. MÄ?ori first settled in the area in the early 1300 's, although little is known today of the area's pre-colonial history. European missionaries arrived in the 1830 's to establish the first missions. Traders then arrived in growing numbers during the 1850 's, and the first permanent PÄ?kehÄ? settlements were established from 1865 following the MÄ?ori land wars and subsequent land confiscations, which resulted in large tracts of swamp being cleared by PÄ?kehÄ? for agricultural farming. The original boundary line that separates the Waikato and Matamata/Piako Districts was first drawn in 1864 following the land wars, and was later used to determine the then new council boundaries in 1876 when the District Councils were first established. The boundary includes one particularly long perfectly straight line at about 10 degrees counter-clockwise from true north on the compass. This boundary line stretches for over 43 kms from the Orakei Stream in the north to Pukemoremore Hill just south of the Waitakaruru Arboretum. The boundary line encompasses mainly farmland plus 3 roads along its path: Manuel Road, Valentine Road and Pukemoremore Road. Although not easily visible from the ground, the scale of this 43 km long perfectly straight divide can be clearly seen from the air. absolute divide reflects the artificial border or aukati that separates the Waikato and Matamata-Piako districts. Using locally produced timber for fencing, <b>plus</b> <b>sheets</b> of marine plywood for the image substrate, a series of 180 vertical aerial photographs have been digitally stitched together to make one long single image that has been printed directly onto plywood using the latest eco-printing technology. Governments and the military use vertical aerial photography for land surveying and human surveillance purposes. The entire structure comprises two 26 -meter long perfectly straight parallel wooden split-rail farm fences located 600 mm apart. The two post and rail fences support eleven 2, 400 mm plywood panels that, when aligned in a long row horizontally, present one long single photographic vertical aerial strip or line...|$|E

40|$|Background: For blood establishments it is {{important}} that blood donors donate blood {{for a longer period of}} time. Unfortunately, many donors stop donating blood in the beginning of their donor career. It is therefore desirable that donors are well informed about, and agree with the blood donation invitation policy before their first donation. In this study new donors received an information sheet about the invitation policy, wherein two different manipulation techniques were used: implementation intentions and explicit commitment. Implementation intentions are said to delegate control of goal-directed behavior to situational cues, thereby eliciting these responses automatically. In addition, explicit commitment is defined as the binding of a person with a specific behavior. Aim: This study aims to increase return behavior of first-time donors using implementation intention and commitment techniques Methods: The study sample consisted of 503 new donors who came to the blood bank for their medical check-up. The medical check-up consisted of a medical questionnaire and three blood samples. The information sheet for this study was handed out after the medical questionnaire and consisted of information about the invitation policy. In the implementation intention condition donors had to read the information sheet, and then fill out their donation preferences (e. g. preference for day and time). In the commitment condition donors had to read the information, sign their name and date the information sheet. All new donors were randomly assigned to one of five experimental conditions: standard procedure (control group), standard procedure <b>plus</b> information <b>sheet,</b> standard procedure <b>plus</b> information <b>sheet</b> with implementation intentions, standard procedure <b>plus</b> information <b>sheet</b> with explicit commitment, standard procedure <b>plus</b> information <b>sheet</b> with implementation intentions and explicit commitment.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to study the behavior of reinforced concrete one way slabs, that strengthened with concrete overlay with and without externally bonded Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) sheets. The experimental results showed that increasing in concrete overlay thickness from 25 mm to 50 mm caused an increase in the first cracking load value, this increasing ranged about (33 % to 100 %) while for ultimate load was about (31 % to 88 %) in compared with control slab specimens. The increasing in compressive strength of the concrete overlay did not give a considerable increase in the first crack loading and ultimate loading. It was obtained that using the bonding materials gave higher ultimate loading, low deflection and low concrete strain in compared with specimens without bonding materials. From results the bonding materials can be arranged according to bonding.

La 0. 4 Sr 0. 6 Co 0. 2 Fe 0. 8 O 3 -δ (LSCF) -SDC cathode was coated on the SDC electrolytes to form a single cell. The lamination was tried at different laminating temperatures and pressures and the co-firing was carried out at different temperatures. The results showed that the laminating temperature should above the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the binder. The laminating pressure of 70 MPa resulted in warp of the samples. The best co-firing temperature of the anode-supported SDC film electrolyte was 1400 °C. The SDC film electrolyte formed well adherence to the anode. The NiO-YSZ anode had larger flexural strength than the NiO-SDC anode.
