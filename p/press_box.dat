5|$|A fire on 25 December 1945 {{destroyed}} the stadium <b>press</b> <b>box</b> and damaged offices. The <b>press</b> <b>box</b> {{was replaced with}} a plainer two-storey structure that overhung the pitch. The capacity of the ground was cut to 135,000 following the Burnden Park disaster in Bolton.|$|E

5|$|The {{rules of}} {{baseball}} {{require that the}} official scorer view the game only from the <b>press</b> <b>box,</b> for two basic reasons. First, this ensures that every scorer has nearly the same perspective of the game. One of the intentions of this rule is to improve consistency in scorekeeping decisions between different official scorers working on different games at the same stadium, and between scorers in different stadiums. Second, the <b>press</b> <b>box</b> is the most neutral position within the stadium. Seated in the <b>press</b> <b>box,</b> the official scorer is surrounded by writers and broadcasters who are ostensibly neutral, and the scorer {{is less likely to}} be unduly influenced by the players, the coaches, and the crowd.|$|E

5|$|In Columbus, Ohio the Huntington Center {{was briefly}} evacuated, and {{occupants}} {{on the upper}} floors of the Rhodes State Office Tower and the Vern Riffe State Office Tower reported feeling strong shaking. Evacuations also occurred in Canton and Akron. In Cleveland, the <b>press</b> <b>box</b> at Progressive Field shook during the third inning of a Cleveland Indians baseball game.|$|E
5|$|For {{activities}} {{open to the}} public, such {{as community}} gatherings, school events, or trade shows, a police- or media-issued press pass may offer little advantage. Free or reduced-price admission, or guaranteed entry, can sometimes be arranged. The benefits may be more extensive, granting access to front-row seats or to press-only rooms. For sporting events, a press pass issued by a stadium grants access to the <b>press</b> <b>box.</b> Because open events are usually funded by paying attendees, the number of press passes may depend {{on the number of}} tickets sold.|$|E
5|$|From February through mid-summer 1984, major renovations and {{additions}} {{were made}} to the stadium. A full-service restaurant, The Hall of Fame Stadium Club, and a mini-roof, to cover the last five rows of the reserved seating section and the main concourse, were built. A new <b>press</b> <b>box</b> included accommodations for members of the media, 2separate booths for home and visiting radio broadcasts, and 2separate booths for home and visiting television broadcasts. Ten sky boxes were built adjacent the press box; by 1989, the number of sky boxes had increased to 18.|$|E

5|$|He {{registered}} his {{century in}} 115 minutes, clouting another five balls over the boundary {{in the morning}} session. One of Miller's sixes travelled over 170m {{in the air to}} Block Q next to the pavilion. He then aimed a lofted shot over long on from the bowling of Hollies, directly at the pavilion. It was still rising when it narrowly went over the <b>press</b> <b>box</b> and clipped the top of the roof. Test spinner James Langridge was brought on and Miller deposited two drives over the fence in his first over.|$|E
5|$|Nashville has honored two of {{its players}} by {{retiring}} their uniform numbers. When a number is retired, only the player with the retired number can wear that number if {{he returns to the}} team as a player or coach. This ensures that the number will be associated with one player of particular importance to the team. Nashville displays its retired numbers {{on the front of the}} <b>press</b> <b>box</b> at First Tennessee Park.|$|E
5|$|The redeveloped Hampden {{has held}} the top status with the various UEFA stadium categories, holding {{category}} four status. The Scottish Football Museum, which opened in 2001, is located within Hampden. Part of the museum is the Scottish Football Hall of Fame. A distinctive feature of the old Hampden, the <b>press</b> <b>box</b> which sat {{on the roof of}} the old South Stand, is also exhibited at the museum. The offices of the Scottish Football Association, Scottish Premier League and Scottish Football League are all located within Hampden.|$|E
2500|$|In 1908, Jackson and Jack Ryder of the Cincinnati Enquirer {{organized}} the Baseball Writers Association of America (BBWAA). [...] The BBWAA {{was established in}} response to ongoing disputes over working conditions in, and control over, <b>press</b> <b>boxes.</b> [...] The <b>press</b> <b>boxes</b> at many fields were cramped, and team owners had begun to offer seating in the <b>press</b> <b>boxes</b> to actors, friends and others who were not members of the working press. [...] Frequently, {{there was no room}} for reporters from the visiting team. The issue came to a head during the 1908 World Series between the Detroit Tigers and Chicago Cubs when visiting baseball writers in Chicago were seated in the back row of the grandstand and in Detroit [...] "were compelled to climb a ladder to the roof of the first base pavilion and write in the rain and snow".|$|R

5|$|In 1896, Young lost {{a no-hitter}} {{with two outs}} {{in the ninth inning}} when Ed Delahanty of the Philadelphia Phillies hit a single. On September 18, 1897, Young pitched the first no-hitter of his career in a game against the Cincinnati Reds. Although Young did not walk a batter, the Spiders {{committed}} four errors while on defense. One of the errors had originally been ruled a hit, but the Cleveland third baseman sent a note to the <b>press</b> <b>box</b> after the eighth inning, saying he had made an error, and the ruling was changed. Young later said, that, despite his teammate's gesture, he considered the game to be a one-hitter.|$|E
5|$|Reports were sketchy {{initially}} – television pictures {{broadcast on}} ITV showed Stein, {{who appeared to}} be both conscious and alert, being carried down the tunnel by a number of police officers, with commentator Brian Moore speculating that he had been overcome with the emotion of the result. BBC Radio commentator Peter Jones (who had no access to the television pictures and was relying on information from other people in the <b>press</b> <b>box)</b> also speculated that the tension of the result and the night had led to Stein's collapse. Willie Miller, the Scottish captain on the night in the absence of Graeme Souness, was informed by Martin Tyler of ITV Sport during the post-match interview that Stein had collapsed, with Alex Ferguson entering the dressing room to tell them that Stein had suffered a heart attack.|$|E
5|$|Tech's {{situation}} was not reflected at Clemson, where offensive coordinator Rich Rodriguez {{announced that he}} was leaving the team for the head football coach job at West Virginia University, where he competed as a player in the 1980s. Rodriguez did not participate in Clemson's practices prior to the Gator Bowl, and he did not coach during the game. Replacing Rodriguez as temporary offensive coordinator was Brad Scott. Joining him in the <b>press</b> <b>box</b> during the Gator Bowl was Mike O'Cain, who was hired as Clemson's new quarterbacks coach. In an effort to prevent further defections, Clemson awarded head coach Tommy Bowden a seven-year contract extension worth $1.1 million annually plus incentives.|$|E

5|$|While still a cricketer, Fender {{wrote for}} several London {{newspapers}} and magazines, and also broadcast on the radio. Although remaining in England, he {{commented on the}} 1924–25 Ashes series for the Sunday Express and became involved in an argument which arose during the tour over the merits of professional captaincy; Fender believed professionals would make good captains. He also wrote about the 1926 series, and drew criticism from Australians when he called their sportsmanship into question. He later wrote regularly for the Evening News and The Star; to the irritation of other journalists, {{he became the first}} man to use a typewriter in the <b>press</b> <b>box.</b>|$|E
5|$|Bedser was bowling and he soon {{implemented}} O'Reilly's plans. Hutton {{was moved}} from leg slip to a squarer position at short fine leg, around 11metres from the bat. Two short legs and a mid-on {{were put in}} place. Bradman drove Bedser through cover for a boundary, but on the next ball, his innings terminated at 138 when he glanced an inswinger from Bedser straight to Hutton at short fine leg, who caught the ball without having to move. Bradman had batted for 290 minutes and faced 321 balls and as Johnson walked in to replace him with Australia at 305/5, Bedser waved to O'Reilly in the <b>press</b> <b>box.</b> When former Australian Test opener Jack Fingleton—a teammate of both Bradman and O'Reilly who was also working as a journalist—reported what his colleague had done, there was some debate as to whether O'Reilly's actions were treacherous.|$|E
5|$|In the teams' {{first meeting}} since 2010, Penn State visited TCF Bank Stadium {{to face a}} Minnesota team looking for their fourth {{consecutive}} Big Ten victory, and their eighth win of the season, {{which would have been}} their first time since the 2003 season. There was consensus among both Penn State's and Minnesota's SB Nation sites, as well as independent picks, that Minnesota would win a relatively close game. Minnesota's offense was one of the better rushing teams in the conference (20th in the nation), but Penn State's defense was also pretty good against the run, making it a good matchup. Freshman quarterback Christian Hackenberg in tandem with a running game that, in theory, was led by Bill Belton and supplemented by Zach Zwinak, and receivers Allen Robinson had potential to score a lot of points. Keys to the game included avoiding turnovers and running the football. Minnesota head coach Jerry Kill, recovering from seizures stemming from epilepsy, coached from the <b>press</b> <b>box.</b>|$|E

50|$|Harris County Precinct One {{operates}} Dow #2 Park in {{the management}} district. C. Milby Dow donated the land for the park in 1958; {{as a result the}} park was named after him. The park includes four baseball fields, an office, four <b>press</b> <b>boxes,</b> and toilet facilities.|$|R
5|$|Initially, Greer {{was capable}} of seating 7,200spectators, but was {{expanded}} to 8,800 {{by the end of}} the inaugural season. Theater-type seats with back support and armrests accounted for 3,000 of the stadium's seats; bleacher seats made up the remainder. The <b>press</b> <b>box</b> included two radio broadcast booths and an organ booth. There were locker rooms for two teams, which each accommodated 25people, as well as a locker room for umpires. The field measured 330feet (100m) down the left and right field lines, 375feet (114m) to left- and right-center fields, and 405feet (123m) to center field. Bullpens are located in foul territory in the outfield, with the home team occupying the third base dugout, and the visitors occupying the first base dugout. Eight lighting grids atop steel poles 100feet (30m) high provided illumination for night games. Amenities for customers at the park included two men's and women's restrooms and seven concession stands.|$|E
5|$|Under Collier, Jones {{supervised}} the offensive backfield and the ends, {{but was also}} the Browns' offensive play-caller. He directed the team from the <b>press</b> <b>box</b> on Collier's behalf because Collier was hard of hearing and could not do so himself. The Browns won their first six games {{at the beginning of}} Jones's coaching career in the 1963 season, although a late slump cost them a spot in the championship game. The team regrouped the following year, ending with a 10–3–1 win-loss-tie record and winning the NFL's eastern division. Cleveland {{went on to win the}} championship game against the Baltimore Colts in 1964. The Browns advanced to the championship game again the following year, but lost to the Green Bay Packers. During his tenure as a coach, Jones was the primary position coach for running backs Jim Brown and Leroy Kelly, both of whom are members of the Pro Football Hall of Fame. He also coached receiver Paul Warfield, another hall of fame member who helped propel the Browns to the 1964 championship.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland {{lost its}} second preseason game, played against the Baltimore Colts in 100-degree heat in Toledo, Ohio. Browns placekicker Lou Groza opened the scoring with an 18-yard field {{goal in the}} first quarter, and a {{touchdown}} by fullback Ollie Cline later in the period put the Browns up 10–0. Baltimore responded {{in the second quarter}} with a touchdown pass by quarterback Y. A. Tittle to receiver Jake Leicht. Cline ran for another touchdown soon thereafter, however, once more giving the Browns a 10-point lead. Colts receiver Lamar Davis caught a 25-yard touchdown pass {{at the end of the}} second quarter. Cleveland led 17–14 at halftime. Neither team scored again until the fourth quarter, when Baltimore's Bus Mertes ran for a 38-yard touchdown and secured the 21–17 win. A number of Cleveland players suffered injuries during the game. Graham hurt his hand, Motley strained his back and end Dante Lavelli suffered a broken leg. Lavelli's injury sidelined him for the first seven games of the regular season. During the game, Baltimore players Hub Bechtol and Lew Mayne, a former Brown, tapped a phone line that went from Cleveland's <b>press</b> <b>box</b> to its sideline. This allowed the Colts to listen in on coaches' conversations and anticipate the Browns' play-calling.|$|E
50|$|New {{sound and}} {{lighting}} systems {{as well as}} a new scoreboard were installed in 2007, and the stadium's <b>press</b> <b>boxes</b> and ticket booths were updated with newer electrical and heating systems since its initial construction in 1974, when it opened, along with Rocky Mountain High School.|$|R
50|$|In 2011, the NFL also {{mandated}} that certified athletic trainers {{be available in}} <b>press</b> <b>boxes</b> during all NFL games. These athletic trainers assist medical personnel located on the sidelines in identifying potential concussions because the symptoms are often difficult to spot and assess from the field level.|$|R
