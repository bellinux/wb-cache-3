A <b>printer</b> <b>controller</b> must plan quickly and reliably, otherwise expensive human intervention will be required. Our approach is practical and efficient, and showcases the flexibility inherent in viewing planning as heuristic search. Execution failure is handled by replanning. We link together the individual searches for each inflight sheet, giving rise to a tree of potentially infinite branching factor. Multiple objectives are handled by linear combination and tie-breaking during best-first search. Multiple precomputed pattern databases are used to improve the efficiency of handling preferences regarding image quality. Our successful experience controlling multiple prototype printing systems shows that replanning and preference-handling can be made practical without using hand-coded control knowledge...|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe {{present an}} {{approach}} for modeling and testing transformational systems {{in an industrial}} context. The systems are modeled {{as a set of}} boolean formulas. Each formula is called a clause and is an expression for an expected output value. To manage complexities of the models, we employ a modeling trick for handling dependencies, by using some output values from the system under test to verify other output values. To avoid circular dependencies, the clauses are arranged in a hierarchy, where each clause depends on the outputs of its children. This modeling trick enables us to model and test complex systems, using relatively simple models. Pairwise testing is used for test case generation. This manages the number of test cases for complex systems. The approach is developed based on a case study for testing <b>printer</b> <b>controllers</b> in professional <b>printers</b> at Océ. The model-based testing approach results in increased maintainability and gives better understanding of test cases and their produced output. Using pairwise testing resulted in measurable coverage, with a test set smaller than the manually created test set. To illustrate the applicability of the approach, we show how the approach can be used to model and test parts of a controller for ventilation in livestock stables...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, the {{implementation}} and characterization of a digital photo printer based on silicon display are presented. A silicon display {{is used as}} an image source and images are printed on Fujifilm instax mini instant film. The printout achieves a resolution of more than 400 pixels per inch and 32 halftones. The silicon display has spatial resolution of 688 x 480 and 16 -bit color per pixel. For photo printer application, a special circuit, namely XGA 2 SDTV process, is designed to put an image of 1024 x 768 spatial resolution on the silicon display. Time sequential color method is used to produce color printouts. The XGA 2 SDTV process is implemented on Xilinx Spartan 2 Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) platform. It costs about 34000 equivalent gate counts and can run up to 85. 75 MHz. Two circuit boards are designed for the photo printer. The first one uses Xilinx FPGA as core. The <b>printer</b> <b>controller,</b> SDRAM controller and silicon display controller is implemented in the FPGA. The board is controlled through software running on PC. The second board uses TI DSP platform. The board directly reads image data from memory cards and decodes the compressed image data in JPEG file. The board can support stand-alone operation without connecting to PC. A procedure for simple characterization of the photo printer is designed, and output qualities are measured for different illumination time values. The red, green and blue illumination time value are optimized based on objectives, namely, uniformity of lightness, maximum output range of lightness, linear gradient in lightness, maximum output range of chroma and linear gradient in chroma. Using the optimum illumination time values, the color gamut in CIE chromaticity x, y values of (0. 56, 0. 35) for red, (0. 30, 0. 55) for green and (0. 19, 0. 11) for blue is obtained...|$|E

After a brief background, {{which includes a}} summary of the probably now defunct low-temperature superconducting technology of the 1960 s and 1970 s, the article concentrates on the renaissance of interest in SPT with the advent of high-temperature superconductors (HTS) in the 1980 s.

40|$|It is {{commonly}} assumed that households must change their behaviour {{to reduce the}} problems caused by increasing levels of fossil energy use. Strategies for behaviour change will be more effective if they target the most important causes of the behaviour in question. Therefore, this paper first discusses the factors influencing household energy use. Three barriers to fossil fuel energy conservation are discussed: insufficient knowledge of effective ways to reduce household energy use, the low priority and high costs of energy savings, {{and the lack of}} feasible alternatives. Next, the paper elaborates on the effectiveness and acceptability of strategies aimed to promote household energy savings. Informational strategies aimed at changing individuals' knowledge, perceptions, cognitions, motivations and norms, as well as structural strategies aimed at changing the context in which decisions are made, are discussed. This paper focuses on the psychological literature on household energy conservation, which mostly exami ned the effects of informational strategies. Finally, this paper lists important topics for future research. (c) 2008 Queen's <b>Printer</b> and <b>Controller</b> of HMSO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

Hydrogen and fuel cells are now widely {{regarded as one of the}} key energy solutions for the 21 st century. These technologies will contribute significantly to a reduction in environmental impact, enhanced energy security (and diversity) and creation of new energy industries. Hydrogen and fuel cells can be utilised in transportation, distributed heat and power generation, and energy storage systems. However, the transition from a carbon-based (fossil fuel) energy system to a hydrogen-based economy involves significant scientific, technological and socioeconomic barriers to the implementation of hydrogen and fuel cells as clean energy technologies of the future. This paper aims to capture, in brief, the current status, key scientific and technical challenges and projection of hydrogen and fuel cells within a sustainable energy vision of the future. We offer no comments here on energy policy and strategy. Rather, we identify challenges facing hydrogen and fuel cell technologies that must be overcome before these technologies can make a significant contribution to cleaner and more efficient energy production processes. © 2008 Queen's <b>Printer</b> and <b>Controller</b> of HMSO...|$|R
