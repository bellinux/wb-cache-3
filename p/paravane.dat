5|$|Following Operation <b>Paravane,</b> the German Navy's {{commander}} {{decided to}} use Tirpitz as a static artillery battery to protect the town of Tromsø. The Allies were unable to confirm {{the extent of the}} battleship's damage, and conducted two further heavy bomber raids against her in late 1944. Tirpitz was sunk with considerable loss of life on 12 November during the second of these attacks.|$|E
5|$|Operation <b>Paravane</b> was a British {{air raid}} of World War II that inflicted heavy {{damage on the}} German {{battleship}} Tirpitz. The attack was conducted on 15 September 1944 by 21 Royal Air Force heavy bombers, which flew from an airfield {{in the north of}} the Soviet Union. The battleship was struck by one bomb, and further damaged by several near misses. This damage rendered Tirpitz unfit for combat, and she could not be repaired as it was no longer possible for the Germans to sail her to a major port.|$|E
5|$|The attack {{force was}} placed on alert to launch what had been {{designated}} Operation <b>Paravane</b> on 8 September. Good weather was vital for the operation, and the airmen waited at their home bases {{for the next two}} days as forecasts proved unfavourable. Meanwhile, the Air Ministry, No. 5 Group and British military liaison officers in the USSR continued to work with the relevant Soviet headquarters to finalise the arrangements for Force A's flight from Norway to Yagodnik.|$|E

40|$|In {{a recent}} study to {{evaluate}} the occupational risks induced by ship motions on the fishing fleet of Newfoundland, {{a model of a}} 65 ? fishing vessel fitted with <b>paravanes</b> was tested in the Ocean Engineering Basin (OEB) of IOT. This project was done under a larger umbrella community initiative called SafetyNet to evaluate health and safety issues of the fishing industry. The particular focus of this project was to evaluate motion induced interruptions onboard the fishing vessels for various operational scenarios. <b>Paravanes</b> are the most common motion reducing devices used on Newfoundland fishing vessels. <b>Paravanes</b> were initially modelled by scaling down both the geometry and the weight using Froude scaling laws. This modeling strategy proved to be unsuccessful and several modifications to the <b>paravanes</b> were required throughout the test program. This paper describes the model seakeeping tests with particular focus on the challenges encountered in modeling the <b>paravanes</b> for these tests. Some of the tests results obtained with and without <b>paravanes</b> deployed will be included in the paper (Fig 1). Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
5|$|As the {{intelligence}} {{available to them}} was not conclusive, the Allies believed that Tirpitz still posed a potential threat. Accordingly, Nos. 9 and 617 Squadrons made two further attacks on the battleship after she moved to Tromsø on 15 October; these operations were more straightforward to conduct than Operation <b>Paravane</b> as the port was {{within the range of}} Lancasters flying from airfields in northern Scotland. The first raid, Operation Obviate, took place on 29 October but caused only minor damage to the battleship. During the subsequent attack conducted on 12 November, Operation Catechism, Tirpitz was struck by several Tallboy bombs and capsized with heavy loss of life among her crew.|$|E
5|$|During their active service, {{the boats}} of the U-20 class {{suffered}} from unreliable engines which compounded the already poor handling {{characteristics of the}} boats. None of the class had any successes and two of their number were sunk during the war. U-23 was the first sunk when she went down on 21 February 1918 from an explosive <b>paravane</b> in the Straits of Otranto. U-20, the lead boat of the class, sank in July 1918 when she was torpedoed by the Italian submarine F-12 in the Tagliamento estuary. The remaining two boats were surrendered at war's end, with U-21 being ceded to Italy in 1920, and U-22 to France; both were broken up.|$|E
5|$|The Admiralty {{accepted}} that Barracudas were {{too slow to}} be effective against the Kaafjord area following the failure of Operation Goodwood. As a result, the task of attacking the battleship was transferred to RAF Bomber Command. The first heavy bomber raid against Kaafjord (Operation <b>Paravane)</b> was conducted on 15 September 1944, with the bombers flying from staging bases in northern Russia. This attack inflicted irreparable damage on Tirpitz, and she was transferred south to the Tromsø area {{to be used as}} an immobile coastal defence battery. The battleship was sunk there with heavy loss of life by another Bomber Command raid on 12 November.|$|E

5|$|The attack force {{returned}} to the United Kingdom in several groups. Tait led 16 Lancasters out of Yagodnik in the evening of 16 September; most of these aircraft flew over southern Finland, Sweden and Denmark. One of the Lancasters went off course and crashed on a mountain near Nesbyen in Norway, killing all eleven airmen aboard, the only Allied casualties of Operation <b>Paravane.</b> Nine other Lancasters departed on 17 September, followed by five {{the next day and}} two on 21 September. The remaining Lancasters had been judged to be damaged beyond repair, and were handed over to the Soviets. The Mosquito, which had been damaged by anti-aircraft fire during a sortie over Kaafjord, returned once repairs were complete on 26 September. The two Liberators were the final aircraft to depart, and flew out of Yagodnik carrying McMullen on 27 September.|$|E
5|$|Tirpitz was {{rendered}} {{unfit for}} combat by Operation <b>Paravane.</b> The Tallboy bomb that struck the battleship {{passed through the}} foredeck and hull, and exploded in the water on the starboard side of her bow. This damage wrecked the bow, and left the battleship's forward compartments flooded with 2,000 tons of water. The explosions of several other Tallboys in the water near Tirpitz also buckled some of her hull plates and bulkheads. The battleship's casualties were not heavy, with five men killed and fifteen wounded. The damage was assessed as needing nine months' worth of work to repair. After reporting on the damage, Tirpitzs commanding officer, Kapitän zur See Wolf Junge, recommended to the German Navy's high command that the battleship be removed from service.|$|E
5|$|The RAF made {{a second}} attempt on 29 October, after {{the ship was}} moored off Håkøya Island outside Tromsø. Thirty-two Lancasters {{attacked}} the ship with Tallboys during Operation Obviate. As on Operation <b>Paravane,</b> No. 9 Squadron and No. 617 Squadron carried out the attack together, which resulted in only one near miss, partially the result of bad weather over the target. The underwater explosion damaged the port rudder and shaft and caused some flooding. Tirpitzs 38cm fragmentation shells proved ineffective in countering the high-level bombers; one aircraft was damaged by ground-based anti-aircraft guns. Following the attack, the ship's anchorage was significantly improved. A large sand bank was constructed under and around the ship to prevent her from capsizing, and anti-torpedo nets were installed. Tirpitz retained a one-degree list to port from earlier damage, and this was not corrected by counter-flooding to retain as much reserve buoyancy as possible. The ship was also prepared {{for her role as}} a floating artillery platform: fuel was limited to only what was necessary to power the turbo-generators, and the crew was reduced to 1,600 officers and enlisted men.|$|E

25|$|The Royal Dock {{was used}} as the UK's largest base for minesweepers to patrol the North Sea. The Admiralty requisitioned {{numerous}} trawlers to serve as minesweepers for the Royal Naval Patrol Service. In many cases, their crew were ex-trawlermen, as well as men from the Royal Naval Reserve and Royal Navy volunteers. Trawlers would use the winches and warps from fishing operations to tow a <b>paravane</b> with a cutting jaw through the water in what was known as a 'sweep' to bring mines to the surface and allow for their removal.|$|E
25|$|The German {{battleship}} Tirpitz {{was attacked}} on multiple occasions by Allied forces during World War II. While most the attacks failed to inflict any {{damage on the}} battleship, she was placed out of action for a lengthy period following the Operation Source midget submarine attack on 22 September 1943 and {{for a short period}} after the Operation Tungsten aircraft carrier strike on 3 April 1944. Tirpitz suffered severe and irreparable damage after being hit by a Tallboy bomb during the Operation <b>Paravane</b> air raid on 15 September 1944, and was sunk with heavy loss of life in the Operation Catechism raid on 12 November that year.|$|E
500|$|On 21 February 1918, Linienschiffsleutnant Klemens Ritter von Bézard, U-23s only {{commanding}} officer, was {{guiding the}} boat in {{an attack on the}} Italian transport [...] in the Straits of Otranto. U-23 came under attack by the Italian torpedo boat Airone which first tried to ram the U-boat, and then deployed an explosive <b>paravane.</b> When the <b>paravane</b> contacted the submerged U-23, it blew debris into the air, sinking the submarine with all hands. Like all of her sister boats, U-23 had no wartime successes.|$|E
40|$|A {{review of}} various roll {{stabilizing}} systems—bilge keels, active fins, passive bilge fins, rudder stabilization systems, passive anti-roll tanks, active anti-roll tanks, and paravanes—is given, {{along with a}} more detailed discussion on their suitability for small fishing vessels. Particular {{attention was paid to}} the passive flume tanks and <b>paravanes,</b> and an experimental study was carried out on these two kinds of stabilizers. [...] A flume tank model and a pair of <b>paravanes,</b> as well as an oscillating bench simulating sinusoidal rolling, were designed and then constructed. The tank was tested on the bench for configuring the internal dimensions which give the desired natural frequencies, tuning, and damping. The analysis was carried out by inspecting the phase lags εt of the motion of tank water to the roll motion. [...] Free roll decay tests for a fishing vessel model with the tank and <b>paravanes</b> were carried out for identification of the damping generated by the tank and <b>paravanes.</b> Non-dimensional equivalent linear damping ratios ζE were calculated and discussed. [...] The stabilizers were tested in the wave tank at MUN, both in regular and irregular beam waves, to determine their effectiveness. The study of roll responses, roll energy spectra, response amplitude operators (RAO), and resonant and significant roll amplitude reductions at various wave and stability conditions shows that the tank can provide 50 % to 70 % roll reductions, which are approximately 30 % more than the <b>paravanes</b> can do in the same circumstances. The effects of tuning, liquid level, and internal damping on the efficiency of the tank are discussed. Comparisons in the behaviors of the stabilizers for different wave conditions are also made. [...] Some design considerations are presented, and further work is recommended to develop a systematic method to design passive stabilizing tanks for small fishing vessels...|$|R

500|$|SM U-23 {{was laid}} down on 8 December 1915 at the Hungarian UBAG yard and was {{launched}} on 5 January 1917. She was commissioned on 1 September and initially patrolled off the Italian towns of Rimini and Ancona. After being transferred to Cattaro in late December, U-23 departed on her final patrol on 20 February 1918. The following day, Linienschiffsleutnant Klemens Ritter von Bézard, U-23s only commanding officer, guided {{the boat in}} {{an attack on the}} Italian transport [...] in the Straits of Otranto. U-23 then came under attack from the Italian destroyer Airone; after first trying to ram the U-boat, the destroyer deployed an explosive <b>paravane.</b> When the <b>paravane</b> came into contact with the submerged U-23, it blew debris into the air, sinking the submarine with all hands.

500|$|The {{ineffectiveness}} of {{the great}} majority of the strikes launched by the Fleet Air Arm in mid-1944 led to the task of Tirpitzs destruction being transferred to the RAF's No. 5 Group. The RAF used Lancaster bombers to carry [...] Tallboy bombs to penetrate the ship's heavy armour. The first attack, Operation <b>Paravane,</b> took place on 15 September 1944; operating from a forward base at Yagodnik in Russia, 23 Lancasters (17 each carrying one Tallboy and six each carrying twelve JW mines), scored a single hit on the ship's bow. The Tallboy penetrated the ship, exited the keel, and exploded {{in the bottom of the}} fjord. [...] of water flooded the bow and caused a serious increase in trim forward. The ship was rendered unseaworthy and was limited to [...] Concussive shock caused severe damage to fire-control equipment. The damage persuaded the naval command to repair the ship for use only as a floating gun battery. Repair work was estimated to take nine months, but patching of the holes could be effected within a few weeks, allowing Tirpitz to be moved further south to Tromsø. On 15 October, the ship made the [...] trip to Tromsø under her own power, the last voyage of her career.|$|E
500|$|The task of sinking Tirpitz now {{fell to the}} RAF, which {{performed}} three airstrikes {{armed with}} new [...] Tallboy bombs. The first attack, Operation <b>Paravane,</b> came on 15 September, when a force of 27 Lancasters dropped a single Tallboy each; the bombers succeeded in hitting Tirpitz directly in the bow {{with one of the}} bombs. The bomb completely penetrated the ship and exploded directly under her keel. This caused [...] of water to flood the ship; Tirpitz had again been disabled. A month later, on 15 October, Tirpitz was moved to Haaköy Island off Tromsø {{to be used as a}} floating artillery battery. Two weeks later, on 29 October, the British launched Operation Obviate, which consisted of 32 Lancaster bombers. Only a near miss was achieved, though it caused Tirpitz to take in more water. The last attack, Operation Catechism, took place on 12 November. Thirty-two Lancasters attacked the ship and scored a pair of direct hits and a near miss. The bombs detonated one of Tirpitzs ammunition magazines and caused the ship to capsize. Casualties were high: 1,204 men were killed in the attack. Another 806 men managed to escape the sinking ship, and a further 82 were rescued from the capsized hulk. The wreck was gradually broken up for scrap between 1948 and 1957.|$|E

500|$|To provide weather {{reports and}} damage {{assessments}} from Kaafjord, agents {{on the ground}} were needed, but the last radio group in the area had exfiltrated in May 1944. The first attempt at re-establishing a presence near Tirpitz occurred in August 1944, when a Norwegian Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) agent was despatched to the nearby village of Alta. The agent infiltrated with a radio transmitter codenamed [...] "Sinding" [...] from neutral Sweden, but only managed to begin transmissions to the United Kingdom on 22 September, {{too late for the}} preparation stage for the operation. In a second attempt at establishing an agent group in the area, the Norwegian SIS agents Knut Moe and Anton Arild were dropped by parachute into the wilderness between Kaafjord and Alta on 8 September by an American Operation Carpetbagger Liberator. During the drop the agents became separated from most of their equipment, {{with the exception of the}} radio transmitter. Without weapons and equipment, the agents were forced to relocate to the village of Bossekop, where Moe's mother lived. The radio transmitter operated by the SIS team, codenamed [...] "Aslaug", was operational by 13 September, sending weather reports to the United Kingdom every other hour. As well as reporting on the weather, Moe and Arild radioed assessments of the damage Tirpitz had suffered in the air attacks prior to Operation <b>Paravane.</b> Local contacts helped the agents in spying on Tirpitz before and after the 15 September attack. By the time of the attack, Moe and Arild had established an observation post overlooking Tirpitzs anchorage in Kaafjord.|$|E
