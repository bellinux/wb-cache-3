40|$|Catabolite {{repression}} {{is defined}} as the inhibition of enzyme induction by glucose or related substances. In the bacterium E. coli, the effect of glucose appears to be due to a lowering of the cyclic AMP level. A DNA-directed cell-free system for β-galactosidase synthesis has served as a model system for studying the mechanism of action of cyclic AMP. Previously, it was reported that in this system cyclic AMP is required for normal initiation of mRNA synthesis. A protein factor which acts in conjunction with the cyclic AMP has been partially purified. This protein factor has a high affinity for cyclic AMP. These and other results presented herein lead us to the conclusion that cyclic AMP and a protein factor called the catabolite gene activator protein are part of a <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> for activating catabolite-sensitive genes...|$|E

40|$|Context: The {{long-lived}} thyroid cell generates, for {{the synthesis}} of thyroid hormones, important amounts of H 2 O 2 that are toxic in other cell types. This review analyzes the protection mechanisms of the cell and the pathological consequences of disorders of this system. Evidence Acquisition: The literature on H 2 O 2 generation and dis-posal, thyroid hormone synthesis, and their control in the human thyroid is analyzed. Evidence Synthesis: In humans, H 2 O 2 production by dual-oxidases and consequently thyroid hormone synthesis by thyroperoxidase are controlled by the phospholipase C-Ca 2 !-diacylglycerol arm of TSH receptor action. H 2 O 2 in various cell types, and presumably in thyroid cells, is a signal, a mitogen, a mutagen, a carcinogen, and a killer. The various protection mechanisms of the thyroid cell against H 2 O 2 are analyzed. They include {{the separation of the}} generating enzymes (dual-oxidases), their coupling to thyroperoxidase in a proposed com-plex, the thyroxisome, and H 2 O 2 degradation systems. Conclusions: It is proposed that various pathologies can be ex-plained, at least in part, by overproduction and lack of degradation of H 2 O 2 (tumorigenesis, myxedematous cretinism, and thyroiditis) and by failure of the H 2 O 2 generation or its <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> (con-genital hypothyroidism).

40|$|Notwithstanding direct {{detection}} of microbial/viral pathogens or their associated toxins, {{the quality of}} drinking water may also be evaluated according to its pro-inflammatory potential. In this latter setting, contamination with pathogens or their products is determined according to the magnitude of activation of blood-derived immune/inflammatory cells following exposure to test water samples in vitro, usually by monitoring the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The primary objective {{of the current study}} was to apply this procedure to evaluate the pro-inflammatory potential of water sampled at entry, as well as at various stages of treatment, from 3 major water treatment facilities in the greater Pretoria region, viz., the Daspoort, Hartbeespoort, and Rietvlei Water Treatment Facilities. Control water samples included domestic tap water, bottled water from a commercial source, and distilled water. Peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes (MNL) were isolated from the blood of healthy, adult, human volunteers (n= 3), enumerated, suspended in tissue culture medium RPMI 1640 containing antibiotics at a concentration of 1 x 106 /mℓ, and exposed to the various water samples (10 %) for 18 h at 37 °C. Following incubation, the cell-free supernatants were assayed for the cytokine, interleukin- 6 (IL- 6), using a quantitative, sandwich, enzyme immunoassay procedure. The mean values for the untreated control system and for a <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> exposed to bacterial endotoxin (120 ng/mℓ) were 153. 5 ± 17 and 1 561 ± 30 pg/mℓ, respectively (p= 0. 03). The production of IL- 6 was unaffected following exposure of MNL to the control water samples. However, inlet water sampled from all three facilities, especially Hartbeespoort, resulted in significant activation of production of IL- 6 by MNL, which declined with progressive treatment, consistent with removal of pro-inflammatory contaminants. Surprisingly, however, a rebound in pro-inflammatory activity was evident in outlet water sampled from Hartbeespoort. In conclusion, the results of the current study appear to support the efficiency of water treatment procedures at the Daspoort and Rietvlei Treatment Facilities, while confirming the usefulness of IL- 6 -based assays as adjuncts to conventional water quality testing procedures.

40|$|Exposure of Enterococcus faecalis cells {{carrying}} the tetracycline resistance plasmid pCF 10 to the heptapeptide pheromone cCF 10 {{results in an}} increase in conjugal transfer frequency by as much as 10 (6) -fold. Pheromone-induced donor cells also express at least two plasmid-encoded surface proteins, the 130 -kDa Sec 10 protein, which is involved in surface exclusion, and the 150 -kDa Asc 10 protein, which has been associated with the formation of mating aggregates. Previous subcloning and transposon mutagenesis studies indicated that the adjacent EcoRI c (7. 5 kb) and e (4. 5 kb) fragments of pCF 10 encode the structural genes for these proteins and that the EcoRI c fragment also encodes at least two regulatory genes involved in activation of the expression of the genes encoding Asc 10 and Sec 10. In this paper, the results of physical and genetic analysis of this region of pCF 10, along with the complete DNA sequences of the EcoRI c and e fragments, are reported. The results of the genetic studies indicate the location of the structural genes for the surface proteins and reveal important features of their transcription. In addition, we provide evidence here and in the accompanying paper (S. B. Olmsted, S. -M. Kao, L. J. van Putte, J. C. Gallo, and G. M. Dunny, J. Bacteriol. 173 : 7665 - 7672, 1991) for a role of Asc 10 in mating aggregate formation. The data also reveal a complex <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> that acts at distances of at least 3 to 6 kb to activate expression of Asc 10.

The genes mapped include prgA (encoding Sec 10) and prgB (encoding Asc 10), as well as four putative regulatory genes, prgX, -R, -S, and -T. Although the predicted amino acid sequences of Sec 10 and Asc 10 have some structural features in common with a number of surface proteins of gram-positive cocci, and the Asc 10 sequence is highly similar to that of a similar protein encoded by the pheromone-inducible plasmid pAD 1 (D.

For example, <b>Positive</b> Train <b>Control</b> is designed to both enhance operations and increase safety. <b>Positive</b> Train <b>Control</b> is designed to protect the train from driver error by applying the brakes if the system thinks the driver will over-speed, pass a signal showing a red aspect or operate outside limits set by train controllers (Wreathall, Woods, Bing and Christoffersen, 2007). This seeks to reduce driver errors that lead to worker injuries, harm to the general public and significant economic losses for the rail operators (Wreathall, Woods et al., 2007).
