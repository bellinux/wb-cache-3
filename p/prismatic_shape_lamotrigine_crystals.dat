5000|$|The basic {{shape of}} the Black Diamond is a box which leans to the left {{as seen from the}} harbour as well as towards the water. At the same time it expands {{slightly}} from the bottom and up and from north to south, giving it a distorted, <b>prismatic</b> <b>shape.</b>|$|R

50|$|For pure {{explosive}} damage, high burn {{rates or}} detonation speeds (and accompanying brisance) are generally preferable, but in guns and especially cannons, slower-burning powder decreases firing stresses. This allows for lighter, longer (and more accurate) barrels with associated decreases in production and maintenance costs. Further modifications of its burning rate were achieved by shaping the powder grains into <b>prismatic</b> <b>shapes,</b> typically single-perforated hexagonal or octagonal prisms.|$|R
50|$|The Sarich orbital {{engine is}} a type of {{internal}} combustion engine, invented in 1972 by Ralph Sarich, an engineer from Perth, Australia, which features orbital rather than reciprocating motion of its internal parts.

5000|$|These {{differences}} in burning rate were achieved by incorporating fuel ingredients {{that were in}} a less-reactive state that those used in gunpowder. Pulverized and fully processed charcoal (elemental carbon) in black powder provides its distinctive black color, while its replacement with a different substance produces a more reflective powder, hence its name [...] "brown powder". Further modifications of burn rate were achieved by shaping the individual powder grains, often into <b>prismatic</b> <b>shapes</b> such as single-perforated hexagonal or octagonal prisms.|$|R
40|$|Otoconia are calcified protein {{matrices}} {{within the}} gravity-sensing organs of the vertebrate vestibular system. These protein matrices {{are thought to}} originate from the supporting or hair cells in the macula during development. Previous studies of mammalian calcitic, barrel-shaped otoconia revealed an organized protein matrix consisting of a thin peripheral layer, a well-defined organic core and a flocculent matrix inbetween. No studies have reported the microscopic organization of the aragonitic otoconial matrix, despite its protein characterization. Pote et al. (1993 b) used densitometric methods and inferred that prismatic (aragonitic) otoconia have a peripheral protein distribution, compared to that described for the barrel-shaped, calcitic otoconia of birds, mammals, and the amphibian utricle. By using tannic acid as a negative stain, we observed three kinds of organic matrices in preparations of fixed, decalcified saccular otoconia from the adult newt: (1) fusiform shapes with a homogenous electron-dense matrix; (2) singular and multiple strands of matrix; and (3) more significantly, <b>prismatic</b> <b>shapes</b> outlined by a peripheral organic matrix. These <b>prismatic</b> <b>shapes</b> remain following removal of the gelatinous matrix, revealing an internal array of organic matter. We conclude that prismatic otoconia have a largely peripheral otoconial matrix, as inferred by densitometry...|$|R
40|$|In this work, {{an attempt}} {{has been made}} to modify the shape and {{nanostructure}} of core-shell materials, which have been usually generated on the basis of amorphous spherical cores. Novel core-shell silicate particles, each of which consists of a silicalite- 1 zeolite crystal core and mesoporous shell (ZCMS), were synthesized for the first time. The ZCMS core-shell particles are unique because they are of pseudohexagonal <b>prismatic</b> <b>shape</b> and have hierarchical porosity of both a uniform microporous core and a mesoporous shell coexisting in a particle framework. The nonspherical bimodal porous core-shell particles were then utilized as templates to fabricate a new carbon replica structure. Interestingly, the pore replication process was carried out only through the mesopores in the shell, and not through the micropores due to the narrower micropore size in the core, resulting in nonspherical carbon nanocases with a hollow core and mesoporous shell (HCMS) structure. Nonspherical silica nanocases with HCMS structure were also generated by replication using the carbon nanocases as templates, which are not possible to synthesize through other synthetic methods. Interestingly, the pseudohexagonal <b>prismatic</b> <b>shape</b> of the zeolite crystals was transferred onto the carbon and silica nanocases...|$|R
40|$|Arrays of silica nanochannels (ASNCs) {{are ordered}} {{mesoporous}} silica particles with hexagonal <b>prismatic</b> <b>shape.</b> The entrances of the well-defined one-dimensional nanochannels {{are located on}} the base surfaces of the hexagonal prisms. The aspect ratio of the micrometer-sized particles (length-to-diameter ratio) can be tuned {{in the range of}} 0. 8 to 2. 2 by the addition of co-ions (K+ and Ca 2 +) to the hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) templated synthesis and by an adjustment of the relative amounts of silica precursor (tetraethoxysilane) and CTAB. The length of the nanochannels can be varied between 2 and 9 μm. Co-ions thereby not only improve the regularity of the hexagonal <b>prismatic</b> particle <b>shape,</b> but also affect the diameter of the nanochannels, which lies at approximately 2. 6 nm (with K+ as co-ion) and 3. 2 nm (with Ca 2 + as co-ion) ...|$|R

40|$|Illite clay {{together}} with dolomite {{can act as}} a precursor material for the synthesis of cordierite-spinel crystalline phases ceramics. This is confirmed by the addition of 4. 5 - 8. 2 wt. % illite clay and dolomite. The addition of 4. 5 wt. % illite clay and dolomite (each of them) to stoichiometric mixture of γ Al 2 O 3 and amorphous SiO 2 results {{in the development of the}} high-temperature cordierite -indialite and spinel as the main crystalline phases at temperature 12800 C and treatment time 1 h. The addition of 8. 2 wt. % illite clay and dolomite (each of them) results in the formation of the spinel MgAl 2 O 4 and enstatite MgSiO 3 crystalline phases. By these additives along with the crystalline phases sufficient amount of glassy phase and evenly distributed pores with average size of 150 - 350 m are formed. The microstructure studies have shown that the shape and size of formed cordierite crystals vary according to the additive of illite clay and dolomite. It is observed that the morphology of indialite crystals formed are perfect <b>prismatic</b> <b>shaped</b> and have a conchoidal fracture. The additional crystalline compounds are octahedral spinel and <b>prismatic</b> <b>shaped</b> enstatite.
