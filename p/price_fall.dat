2500|$|The {{substitution}} effect {{is the change}} in demands resulting from a price change that alters {{the slope of the}} budget constraint but leaves the consumer on the same indifference curve. In other words, it illustrates the consumer's new consumption basket after the price change while being compensated as to allow the consumer to be as happy as he or she was previously. By this effect, the consumer is posited to substitute toward the good that becomes comparatively less expensive. In the illustration below this corresponds to an imaginary budget constraint denoted SC being tangent to the indifference curve I1. Then the income effect from the rise in purchasing power from a <b>price</b> <b>fall</b> reinforces the {{substitution effect}}. [...] If the good is an inferior good, then the income effect will offset in some degree the substitution effect. [...] If the income effect for an inferior good is sufficiently strong, the consumer will buy less of the good when it becomes less expensive, a Giffen good (commonly believed to be a rarity).|$|E

Weekly micro pricing behaviour in British groceries is investigated across three leading retailers over the moderation period 2004 - 7 and crisis period 2008 - 10. We find significant price flexibility sharply distinguished from behaviour observed in most previous work. Downward price flexibility increases markedly in 2008. Overall basket prices rise, but significantly more individual <b>prices</b> <b>fall</b> than rise in the latter period.
