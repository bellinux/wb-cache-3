Pita breads were made from either 100 % baker's flour (control) or 50 % malt flour, whole-grain flour, or flour from <b>barley</b> grains <b>pearled</b> at 10 %, 15 %, and 20 % grain weight. Antioxidant capacity and vitamin E content of flours and pitas were determined by their ability to scavenge 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl radicals and high performance liquid chromatography, respectively. The physical and sensory properties of the pitas were also assessed. All pitas made from either whole grain or <b>pearled</b> <b>barley</b> flour had a higher antioxidant capacity and most also had higher vitamin E content than standard pita. The antioxidant and vitamin E levels were reduced in pearled compared to whole grains, however the extent of that reduction varied among genotypes. The greatest antioxidant and vitamin E levels were found in pita made from malt flour or Finniss whole grain flour. Furthermore, sensory analysis suggested these pitas were acceptable to consumers and retained similar physical and sensory properties {{to those in the}} control pita.

40|$|A {{trial was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the substitution of process de-hulled <b>barley</b> (or <b>pearled</b> <b>barley)</b> for maize in a traditional maize-soy diet and the inclusion of beta-glucanase on the growth performance and nutrient digestibility of broiler chickens. The experiment was a randomized design with a 3 x 2 factorial arrangement with three levels of de-hulled barley substitution and two levels of enzyme inclusion in the diet. De-hulled barley replaced 0, 400 or 800 g maize/kg with versus without p-glucanase inclusion in iso-nitrogenous and iso-caloric experimental diets. Results showed that increasing amounts of barley substitution increased feed intake in the broiler chickens, hence significantly increased the live-weight gain both in the grower and finisher period (P 0. 05). Barley substitution in the broiler diet did not significantly influence the digesta viscosity in the duodenum (P > 0. 05), however, {{a significant increase in}} the relative weight of the jejunum and caecum was evident in growing broilers and in the ileum weight in the finisher. Barley substitution also depressed dry matter and crude fat digestibility (P < 0. 05) in the starting and finishing periods. Enzyme inclusion significantly decreased the relative weight of the GI tracts except for the caecum in the grower and the crop, gizzard and jejunum in finisher broilers. Enzyme inclusion significantly improved fat digestion in grower diet (P < 0. 05). Enzyme inclusion also significantly increased the total VIA concentration in the finisher (P < 0. 05). It appears that de-hulled barley substitute for maize increased feed intake, hence increased live-weight gains for the broiler chickens and decreased dry matter and fat digestibility in the grower. Inclusion of beta-glucanase decreased the relative weight of the GI tract, increased fat digestion in growers and total VFA content in the caecum of finishing broiler chickens.

40|$|Barley landraces have {{experienced}} years {{of natural and}} farmer massal selection in favour of his particular trait of interest (food, feed or malt) without any scientific background on their performance, quality or inner properties. Eight hundred and seventy eight barley landraces, collected from farmers’ sites typically used for food belonging to forty three countries, were investigated to uncover the elite properties of this international barley landraces. Series of agro-morphological, physiological and quality analyses were performed. Greater genotype effect over environment for agro-morphological and physiological traits was detected by GGE Biplot analysis when considering cultivars grown under adverse environmental conditions of the two ICARDA’s experiment stations. Strong evident correlations between traits for individuals from different countries were observed (positive: grain yield and biomass; peduncle extrusion and peduncle length, negative: heading date with grain yield and peduncle properties. The wild relative Hordeum ssp spontaneum was clearly distinct from the cultivated barley as depicted with principal coordinate and cluster analyses. The geographical representation of the agro-morphological and physiological traits based on their averages could guide an efficient collection of a specific trait of interest (e. g. trait: material with high canopy temperature depression to be collected in Morocco, high fluorescence ratio in China and high chlorophyll content in Iran). Genetic diversity study of 304 subset barley landraces from 29 countries with twenty SSR markers was also conducted. Out of them, 19 highly polymorphic markers have identified three distinct germplasm pools: 1) Eastern Africa and South America, 2) Caucasus and 3) Central Asia, Near East, Northern Africa and Eastern Asia. Barley subspecies (H. vulgare ssp vulgare convar. vulgare, H. vulgare ssp vulgare convar. distichon, H. ssp spontaneum and H. vulgare ssp vulgare convar. vulgare f agriochrithon) were separated into three distinct groups (cultivated barleys, H. ssp spontaneum and H. vulgare ssp vulgare convar. vulgare f agriochrithon) leading {{to the possibility of}} rejection the hybrid origin of H. vulgare ssp vulgare convar. vulgare f agriochrithon. Modernization of barley landraces, staple food used traditionally for making typical recipes, for food uses through assessing its food quality richness is indeed possible. Out of 878 barley landraces, 45 samples have been identified as being suitable for use in the production of <b>pearled</b> <b>barley,</b> barley flour and/or barley flakes. This project has disclosed the richness of the wild barley Hordeum ssp spontaneum in terms of protein content and β-glucans content. The significant correlation between protein content and the minerals Zn and Fe confirmedprevious reports in the literature. In addition, this work revealed that barley landraces are potential source β-glucans and micronutrients (i. e. Zn and Fe) thereby highlighting the potential for these landraces to be utilized in breeding programs that are targeting the enhancement of barley for use in food applications. The genotype by environmental effect of ß-Glucan determined by Megazyme kit on a subset of 242 barley landraces from 31 countries grown during the cropping seasons 2005 - 2006 and 2006 - 2007 in two ICARDA’s contrasting environmental experiment stations was supported disclosing high ß-Glucan values in Eritrea, Palestine and Algeria. Barley landraces were also characterized by high amylose content mainly the wild relative and by diverse viscosity properties leading to the possibility of developing food barley products like noodles or cookies. Correlation between amylose content and ß-Glucan was revealed same as soft kernel and viscosity parameters. This latter was also correlated positively with TKW and ß-Glucan and negatively with protein content. H. ssp spontaneum also features high viscosity values. The results spotlight the interest of barley landraces especially Hordeumssp spontaneum in food industries for making various food barley products with typical characteristics e. g. barley food rich in amylose content for obese patients. The association studies of Granule Bound Starch Synthase I (GBSSI) and Starch Synthase IIa (SSIIa) genes single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) with food quality characteristics in barley, comprising amylose content, viscosity properties and physicochemical parameters, revealed many SNPs of GBSS 1 and SSIIa genes that were significantly related to food quality traits and amongst them few ones have led to amino acid changing (amylose, amylopectin, hardness, β-glucans, viscosity parameters, plumpness, protein and zinc. From these results, barley landraces might be considered as source of food barley products development and SNPs starch genes (GBSSI and SSIIa) as tools for food quality traits changing via mutations at the appropriate associated SNP...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Dielectric {{properties}} of a material are intrinsic electrical properties that describe its polarization status when subjected to an electric field. At microwave frequencies, this polarization is orientational resulting from rotation of free water molecule in presence of electric field or reorientation of bound water molecules {{in association with}} the food molecules. The dielectric properties are represented by dielectric constant and dielectric loss factor. They affect the degree of coupling of microwave energy with the food particles, energy absorbed and heat produced. These depend upon the composition of material and are affected by the presence of free water, bound water, surface charges, electrolytes, non electrolytes and hydrogen bonding in the food products. In order to establish a correlation between nutrient composition and dielectric properties, studies were made on three different food grains viz <b>barley,</b> <b>pearl</b> millet and sorghum.
