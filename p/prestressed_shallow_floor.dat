40|$|This {{research}} {{investigated the}} longitudinal shear transfer mechanism in composite <b>shallow</b> cellular <b>floor</b> beams. The shear transfer mechanism is different with the headed shear studs used in composite construction. The shear resisting properties and behaviour of the shear transfer mechanism {{has not been}} studied previously. Experimental and analytical {{studies were carried out}} with the aims of improving and optimizing the design details, and advancing the method of shear connection in <b>shallow</b> <b>floor</b> beam construction. The composite <b>shallow</b> cellular <b>floor</b> beam investigated in this research is a new type of beam fabricated by welding two highly asymmetric cellular tees along the web. The shear connections of this type of composite beam are formed by the web openings, which transfer longitudinal shear force. Four types of these shear connections were studied: concrete-infill-only, tie-bar, ducting and web-welded-stud shear connections. In total, 24 push-out tests were performed in two test series to investigate the load-slip behaviour and shear resistance of the shear connections under direct shear force. The failure mechanisms of the two forms of shear connections were extensively studied, which lead {{to the development of a}} design method for the composite action. The concrete infill element passing through the web opening is subject to a complex three-dimensional stress state, and it is difficult to analyse it using the mathematical model rather than empirical formula. Finite Element Analysis of the concrete-infill-only shear connection was performed with a parametric study to further verify the design method that has been developed. Two flexural tests were carried out on a full-scale composite <b>shallow</b> cellular <b>floor</b> beam with a solid slab. The shear connections investigated in the flexural tests were: concrete-infill-only and tie-bar shear connections passed through the web. The behaviour and performance of the shear connections in the flexural tests were compared with those in the push-out tests. The degree of shear connection of the two flexural tests was determined in the back analysis using plastic theory with measured material properties. Based on the findings of the push-out tests and flexural tests, two design methods of deflection check and moment resistance were developed for composite <b>shallow</b> cellular <b>floor</b> beams at the serviceability limit state and the ultimate limit state respectively. The deflection check design method is based on the uncracked section properties of the composite beam. The moment resistance design method developed in this thesis is compatible with the design methods of BS 5950 and Eurocode 4 (EC 4) ...|$|R

40|$|The shear {{transferring}} {{mechanisms of}} composite <b>shallow</b> cellular <b>floor</b> beams are different with the conventional headed shear studs, {{and have not}} been investigated previously. This paper presents the experimental and analytical studies of the shear transferring mechanisms with the aims to provide information on their shear resistance and behaviour. The composite <b>shallow</b> cellular <b>floor</b> beam is {{a new type of}} composite floor beam that consists of an asymmetric steel section with circular web openings and concrete slabs incorporated between the top and bottom flange. The unique feature of the web openings allows tie-bars, building services and ducting to pass through the structural depth of the floor beam, creating an ultra-shallow floor beam structure. The shear connection of the composite <b>shallow</b> cellular <b>floor</b> beam is formed innovatively by the web openings, as the in-situ concrete passes through the web openings may or may not include the tie-bars or ducting to transfer the longitudinal shear force. In total, 24 push-out tests were carried out to investigate the shear connection under the direct shear force. The effect of loading cycles on the shear connection was also investigated.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In modern {{building}} construction design, floor spans are becoming longer. Hence, steel framed structures {{have become more}} competitive when compared with traditional reinforced concrete framed buildings. In order to minimise the structural section of the composite sections, and for economic reasons, steel perforated beams are designed to act compositely with the floor slab. When the concrete slab lies within the steel flanges, as in the Ultra <b>Shallow</b> <b>Floor</b> Beam (USFB), there is an additional benefit when considering fire resistance. The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate the contribution of the concrete in composite cellular beams in the case where the concrete slab lies between the beam flanges of a steel section, when resisting vertical shear forces. The concrete between the flanges enhances the load-carrying capacity by providing a load path to transfer the shear force. Four specimens of steel-concrete composite beams with web openings in the steel section were tested in this study. One bare steel section with web openings was also tested as a comparison. This is the first such investigation of the failure mode under shear resistance (Vierendeel action) of the Ultra <b>Shallow</b> <b>Floor</b> Beam. In the test specimens, the web opening diameter is 76 % of the beam depth, which is the largest currently available. This represents the worst case in terms of Vierendeel bending forces generated in the vicinity of the web openings. The smaller the hole is, the easier it is for the trapped concrete between the flanges to transfer shear across the opening. The results from the composite beam tests show a significant increase in shear resistance. The percentage of the shear capacity improvement of the particular case is presented herein as well as the failure mode of the composite beams. The shear enhancement demonstrated in this study has been utilised software that is used in design practice...|$|R

For the composite beam in bending, the longitudinal shear force is transferred by a unique shear mechanism which results from the special configuration of the beam, and shear connectors, if they are present. The work reported in this paper includes a total of 16 full-scale push-out tests aimed at investigating the longitudinal shear behaviour of these beams and the effects of additional shear connectors.

40|$|Floor-Fractured Craters (FFCs) are a {{class of}} lunar craters {{characterized}} by anomalously <b>shallow</b> <b>floors</b> cut by radial, concentric, and/or polygonal fractures; additional interior features are moats, ridges, and patches of mare material. Two formation mechanisms have been hypothesized—floor uplift in response to shallow magmatic intrusion and sill formation, and <b>floor</b> <b>shallowing</b> in response to thermally driven viscous relaxation. This study combines new Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA) and Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera (LROC) data to characterize and categorize the population of FFCs and map their distribution on the Moon, and uses variations in floor-fractured crater morphology and regional distribution to investigate the proposed formation mechanisms. The population of FFCs was categorized according to the classes outlined by Schultz (1976). The distribution of these FFC categories shows an evolution of crater morphology from areas adjacent to lunar impact basins to areas in the lunar highlands. We propose that this trend is supportive of formation by shallow magmatic intrusion and sill formation—crustal thickness determines the magnitude of magmatic driving pressure, and thus either piston-like floor uplift for high magnitude, or a convex floor profile for low magnitude. Predictions from previous studies modeling viscous relaxation are inconsistent with the observed altimetric profiles of FFCs. Hence our analysis favors FFC formation by shallow magmatic intrusion, with the variety of FFC morphologies being intimately linked with location and crustal thickness, and the driving pressure of the intrusion. Data from the GRAIL (Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory) mission will help to test these conclusions...|$|R
