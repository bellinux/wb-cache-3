Some, such as Emma Lundgren and Stüssy, have created their own designs or integrated camouflage patterns with other symbols.|$|E
5|$|In this period, the {{ceramics}} {{showed a}} {{change with the}} entry of the highland Solano style, This ceramic tradition is most associated with the Solano site in the southeastern Valley of Guatemala and the most characteristic type is a brick-red ware covered with a bright orange micaceous slip, sometimes painted with <b>pink</b> <b>or</b> purple decoration. This style of ceramics {{has been associated with}} the highland K'iche' Maya. These new ceramics did not replace the pre-existing Ocosito complex but rather became mingled with them.|$|E
5|$|Like other fairywrens, {{the splendid}} fairywren is notable for several {{peculiar}} behavioural characteristics; birds are socially monogamous and sexually promiscuous, meaning that although they form pairs between one male and one female, each partner will mate with other individuals and even assist in raising the young from such trysts. Male wrens pluck <b>pink</b> <b>or</b> purple petals and display them to females {{as part of}} a courtship display.|$|E

5|$|Member {{species are}} usually annuals or {{herbaceous}} perennials. Flowers are red, <b>pink,</b> <b>or</b> yellow, often in various combinations. A {{large number of}} the Erythranthe species grow in moist to wet soils with some growing even in shallow water. They are not very drought resistant, {{but many of the}} species now classified as Diplacus are. Species are found at elevations from oceanside to high mountains as well as a wide variety of climates, though most prefer wet areas such as riverbanks.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the genus}} Entoloma, the fungus is {{classified}} in the subgenus Leptonia, section Cyanula because of its overall habit, clampless hyphae, and abundant granules of pigment. Noordeloos and Gates place it in the stirps (a grouping of related species within a genus) Austroprunicolor, characterized by mushrooms with a violaceous <b>pink</b> <b>or</b> blue cap that contrasts with a pallid, whitish, polished stipe.|$|E
5|$|Both {{males and}} females utilize calls in alarm situations, {{especially}} in territorial disputes and encounters with predators. Males alone produce the cheer call, which can sound indistinct. In southern regions of their range, the sound males use in alarm disputes is a ringing <b>pink</b> <b>or</b> p'dink sound. Females {{are the only ones}} that can perform the paired dit-dit or chatter sounds. The former can be used in territorial disputes with predators, and with at least northern populations the songs are used in alternation with the males cheer chant. The chatter is used exclusively with territorial encounters with male song, and the song can either follow or overlap her mate's song.|$|E

5|$|Fairywrens exhibit one of {{the highest}} incidences of extra-pair mating, and many broods are brought up a by male who is not the natural father. However, {{courtship}} methods among white-winged fairywrens remain unclear. Blue-plumaged males have been seen outside of their territory and in some cases, carrying <b>pink</b> <b>or</b> purple petals, which among other species advertise the male to neighboring females. In contrast, black-plumaged males on Barrow and Dirk Hartog islands often carry blue petals. While petal-carrying outside of clan territories strongly suggests mating with other females is occurring, further genetic analysis is necessary.|$|E
5|$|Harrya chromapes, {{commonly}} known as the yellowfoot bolete or the chrome-footed bolete, is species of bolete fungus in the family Boletaceae. The bolete is found in eastern North America, Costa Rica, and eastern Asia, where it grows on the ground, in a mycorrhizal association with deciduous and coniferous trees. Fruit bodies have smooth, rose-pink caps that are initially convex before flattening out. The pores on the cap undersurface are white, aging to a pale pink as the spores mature. The thick stipe has fine <b>pink</b> <b>or</b> reddish dots (scabers), and is white to pinkish but with a bright yellow base. The mushrooms are edible but are popular with insects, and so they are often infested with maggots.|$|E
5|$|Motul de San José {{has been}} {{identified}} as the source of Ik-style polychrome ceramics bearing painted scenes of the Late Classic Maya aristocracy involved in a variety of courtly activities. The Ik-style was characterised by hieroglyphs painted in a <b>pink</b> <b>or</b> pale red colour, scenes with dancers wearing masks, and the realistic representation of subjects as they appeared in life. The city was the capital of a polity that included various satellite sites of varying importance, including a port on the shore of Lake Petén Itzá.|$|E

The partnership saw a portion of kit sale revenue being donated to Breast Cancer Care. Partick Thistle's current home kit features a yellow and red shirt, the sleeves are yellow with a predominanty red foreground. The kit features black shorts, red socks, with a yellow trim. The away kit is white, with a yellow collar and sleeve trim on the jersey. Goalkeepers wear a generic kit design from Joma, and are either <b>pink</b> <b>or</b> grey.|$|E
5|$|Synthetic {{diamonds}} {{for use as}} gemstones {{are grown}} by HPHT or CVD methods, and currently represent approximately 2% of the gem-quality diamond market. However, {{there are indications that}} the market share of synthetic jewelry-quality diamonds may grow as advances in technology allows for larger higher-quality synthetic production on a more economic scale. They are available in yellow and blue, {{and to a lesser extent}} colorless (or white). The yellow color comes from nitrogen impurities in the manufacturing process, while the blue color comes from boron. Other colors, such as <b>pink</b> <b>or</b> green, are achievable after synthesis using irradiation. Several companies also offer memorial diamonds grown using cremated remains.|$|E
5|$|The Ik-style ceramic corpus {{includes}} {{a set of}} features such as hieroglyphs painted in a <b>pink</b> <b>or</b> pale red colour and scenes with dancers wearing masks. One of the most distinctive features is the realistic representation of subjects as they appeared in life, {{something that is very}} rare in Mesoamerican art. The corpus is represented by more than 30 intact vessels, the majority of unknown provenance, which have been compared to ceramic fragments recovered from Motul de San José and its satellite sites. The subject matter of the vessels includes courtly life from the Petén region in the 8th century AD, such as diplomatic representations, feasting, bloodletting, scenes of warriors and the sacrifice of prisoners of war.|$|E

5|$|The brain-like surface folds {{and mature}} olive-brown gleba are {{characteristic}} of Calvatia craniiformis, but younger puffballs {{that have not yet}} developed these characteristics may be difficult to identify to species. Another edible puffball, C.cyathiformis (lilac puffball) grows to similar dimensions but has gleba that is purple-brown when mature. Calvatia fragilis is smaller and <b>pink</b> <b>or</b> purple mature gleba. C.bicolor is a smaller, rounder puffball that could be confused with younger specimens of C.craniiformis, but the former species has more coarsely ornamented spores, and lacks a distinct subgleba. Handkea utriformis is roughly similar in appearance to C.craniiformis, but unlike the latter it develops a cavernous opening to reveal an olive-brown gleba, and has distinct slits in its capillitial threads.|$|E
5|$|DC often still draws {{criticism}} {{for its use}} of stereotypes for LGBT characters. Firebrand, a superhero debuting in 1941, is thought {{by some to be}} an early example, with his <b>pink</b> <b>or</b> transparent costume. Writer Roy Thomas penned thought balloons that suggested Firebrand had been involved in a gay relationship with his sidekick and bodyguard Slugger Dunn, although these hints never moved beyond subtext. A more modern example is the violent vigilante superhero Midnighter. The Batman-like Midnighter was shown as being in a relationship with the Superman-like Apollo during their time as members of the superhero team The Authority. Midnighter and Apollo are now married and have an adopted daughter– Midnighter has gone on to star in his own title. In 2006, DC Comics could still draw widespread media attention by announcing a new, lesbian incarnation of the well-known character Batwoman, even though openly lesbian minor characters such as Gotham City police officer Renee Montoya already existed in the franchise.|$|E
5|$|Docter {{recruited}} a story crew to {{help develop}} the film's plot line. Although animation as an industry had been dominated by men, half of the story crew were women, {{in an attempt to}} have more diverse input. The choice to focus the film on a girl came from research that claimed that females age 11 to 17 are more attuned to expressions and emotions than others. The idea to have Riley play hockey came from Del Carmen, who observed that the sport is very popular in Minnesota. They tried to stray away from stereotypically feminine interests, such as the color <b>pink</b> <b>or</b> dresses. Initial ideas for the film found the main character, Riley, falling into a deep depression: Docter later felt they were inappropriate and scrapped them, although in the final film Riley does sink into a depression.|$|E

5|$|Dorsally, {{the color}} pattern {{consists}} of a deep yellow, tan, or brown ground color, with three series of dark brown spots that run {{the length of the}} body. Each of these spots has a black ring around it, the outer border of which is intensified with a rim of white or yellow. The dorsal spots, which usually number 23–30, may grow together, while the side spots may break apart. The head has a pair of distinct dark patches, one on each temple, together with a pinkish, salmon, or brownish V or X marking that forms an apex towards the snout. Behind the eye is a dark streak, outlined in white, <b>pink,</b> <b>or</b> buff. The venter is white, whitish, yellowish, or pinkish, often with an irregular scattering of dark spots.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of RNAi was preceded first by observations of transcriptional inhibition by antisense RNA expressed in transgenic plants, and more directly by reports of unexpected outcomes in experiments performed by plant {{scientists in the}} United States and the Netherlands in the early 1990s. In an attempt to alter flower colors in petunias, researchers introduced additional copies of a gene encoding chalcone synthase, a key enzyme for flower pigmentation into petunia plants of normally <b>pink</b> <b>or</b> violet flower color. The overexpressed gene was expected to result in darker flowers, but instead produced less pigmented, fully or partially white flowers, indicating that the activity of chalcone synthase had been substantially decreased; in fact, both the endogenous genes and the transgenes were downregulated in the white flowers. Soon after, a related event termed quelling was noted in the fungus Neurospora crassa, {{although it was not}} immediately recognized as related. Further investigation of the phenomenon in plants indicated that the downregulation was due to post-transcriptional inhibition of gene expression via an increased rate of mRNA degradation. This phenomenon was called co-suppression of gene expression, but the molecular mechanism remained unknown.|$|E
5|$|The plumage of the {{cockatoos}} is less brightly coloured {{than that}} of the other parrots, with species generally being either black, grey or white. Many species have smaller areas of colour on their plumage, often yellow, pink and red, usually on the crest or tail. The galah and Major Mitchell's cockatoo are more broadly coloured in pink tones. Several species have a brightly coloured bare area around the eye and face known as a periophthalmic ring; the large red patch of bare skin of the palm cockatoo is the most extensive and covers some of the face, while it is more restricted in some other species of white cockatoo, notably the corellas and blue-eyed cockatoo. The plumage of males and females is similar in most species. The plumage of the female cockatiel is duller than the male, but the most marked sexual dimorphism occurs in the gang-gang cockatoo and the two species of black cockatoos in the subgenus Calyptorhynchus, namely the red-tailed and glossy black cockatoos. The iris colour differs in a few species, being <b>pink</b> <b>or</b> red in the female galah and Major Mitchell's cockatoo and red-brown in some other female white cockatoo species. The males all have dark brown irises.|$|E
