5|$|Most rodents are herbivorous, feeding {{exclusively}} on plant material such as seeds, stems, leaves, flowers, and roots. Some are omnivorous {{and a few}} are predators.

5000|$|Several factors {{play into}} these {{fluctuating}} populations and help stabilize predator-prey dynamics.

This stabilizing dynamic plays an especially important role for specialist herbivores that feed on one species of plant and prevents these specialists from wiping out their food source. [...] Prey defenses also help stabilize predator-prey dynamics, and for more information on these relationships see the section on Plant Defenses. Eating a second prey type helps herbivores’ populations stabilize. [...] Alternating between two or more plant types provides population stability for the herbivore, while the populations of the plants oscillate. [...] This plays an important role for generalist herbivores that eat a variety of plants. Keystone herbivores keep vegetation populations in check and allow for a greater diversity of both herbivores and plants. [...] When an invasive herbivore or plant enters the system, the balance is thrown off and the diversity can collapse to a monotaxon system.|$|R

Here, we provide a comprehensive evolutionary analysis of the Dicer protein family, which carries out the initial RNA recognition and processing steps in the RNAi pathway. We show that Dicer genes duplicated and diversified independently in early animal and plant evolution, coincident with the origins of multicellularity. We identify a strong signature of long-term protein-coding adaptation that has continually reshaped the RNA-binding <b>pocket</b> of the <b>plant</b> Dicer responsible for antiviral immunity, suggesting an evolutionary arms race with viral factors. We also identify key changes in Dicer domain architecture and sequence leading to specialization in either gene-regulatory or protective functions in animal and plant paralogs.

40|$|Representative {{land use}} types were {{selected}} in southeast Spain {{to investigate the}} redistribution of soil water in relation to vegetation development and land abandonment. Simulated rainfall experiments were performed during 2 days {{on each of the}} four selected surfaces: ploughed, a 3 -year fallow field, a 12 -year abandoned field with shrubs and a semi-natural field with Stipa tenacissima tussocks. Each experiment consisted of five runs of artificial rain. Soil moisture dynamics were measured by time domain reflectometry (TDR), as well as runoff and ponding on the plot surface. Also the movement of the wetting front was measured after each run. On the ploughed field, ponding and local runoff were less important with shallow and homogeneous wetting fronts. The other land uses showed increased heterogeneity in wetting front development, with soil water <b>pockets</b> under the <b>plants</b> that moved down at greater velocities than under the bare inter-spaces. It is hypothesized that S. tenacissima and possibly Artemisia herba-alba adapt their environment by capturing water through stem-root flow systems to divert water to deeper soil layers to reduce evaporation. Furthermore it is suggested that during vegetation development soil heterogeneity increases, as expressed by the water infiltration patterns observed, and that the bare inter-patches are important in the infiltration process...|$|R
40|$|The {{applicability}} of jig {{technology to the}} recovery of diamonds in kimberlite and alluvial deposits {{has long been known}} and accepted The current drive to maximize the recovery from resources has triggered a resurgence of interest in the retreatment of tailings deposits. Due to the typically very low grades of these resources, innovative thinking is required in order to treat them profitably. The De Beers Group saw this opportunity about 4 years ago at the Williamson Mine in Tanzania and installed 6 InLine Pressure Jigs, supplied by Gekko Systems, as pre-concentrators ahead of a conventional Dense Media Separation plant. Installation and operational issues militated against the success of this plant until late 2004 when a joint De Beers/Williamson/Gekko initiative was launched to rectify the installation and resolve the issues. Process control instrumentation was retrofitted to one IPJ and a battery of recovery tests were performed, yielding 100 % recovery of simulants and tracers. Partition curves were plotted and an operating regime for continuous operation was recommended based on the excellent results obtained.

40|$|Background: Steroidogenic acute {{regulatory}} protein (StAR) -related lipid transfer (START) domains were first identified from mammalian proteins that bind lipid/sterol ligands via a hydrophobic <b>pocket.</b> In <b>plants,</b> predicted START domains are predominantly found in homeodomain leucine zipper (HD-Zip) transcription {{factors that are}} master regulators of cell-type differentiation in development. Here we utilized studies of Arabidopsis in parallel with heterologous expression of START domains in yeast to investigate the hypothesis that START domains are versatile ligand-binding motifs that can modulate transcription factor activity. Results: Our results show that deletion of the START domain from Arabidopsis Glabra 2 (GL 2), a representative HD-Zip transcription factor involved in differentiation of the epidermis, results in a complete loss-of-function phenotype, although the protein is correctly localized to the nucleus. Despite low sequence similarly, the mammalian START domain from StAR can functionally replace the HD-Zip-derived START domain. Embedding the START domain within a synthetic transcription factor in yeast, we found that several mammalian START domains from StAR, MLN 64 and PCTP stimulated transcription factor activity, as did START domains from two Arabidopsis HD-Zip transcription factors. Mutation of ligand-binding residues within StAR START reduced this activity, consistent with the yeast assay monitoring ligand-binding. The D 182 L missense mutation in StAR START was shown to affect GL 2 transcription factor activity in maintenance of the leaf trichome cell fate. Analysis of in vivo protein–metabolite interactions by mass spectrometry provided direct evidence for analogous lipid-binding activity in mammalian and plant START domains in the yeast system. Structural modeling predicted similar sized ligand-binding cavities of a subset of plant START domains in comparison to mammalian counterparts. Conclusions: The START domain is required for transcription factor activity in HD-Zip proteins from plants, {{although it is not}} strictly necessary for the protein’s nuclear localization. START domains from both mammals and plants are modular in that they can bind lipid ligands to regulate transcription factor function in a yeast system. The data provide evidence for an evolutionarily conserved mechanism by which lipid metabolites can orchestrate transcription. We propose a model in which the START domain is used by both plants and mammals to regulate transcription factor activity...|$|R
40|$|A silent {{revolution}} {{is taking place}} on Burkina Faso's Central Plateau. Thousands of <b>planting</b> <b>pockets</b> or zai, stone lines, permeable stone dams and straw mulch are transforming crop production as farmers see the benefits of using traditional farming techniques. Researchers from the Club du Sahel have found that in years of low rainfall farmers are getting significant increases in yields, sometimes in excess of 80 %, from fields that have stone lines, which control rainfall runoff. Some of this increase {{can be attributed to}} more water soaking into the soil but farmers are also applying extra nutrients. However, it is also apparent that soil structure is improved through the action of termites and other soil organisms that are attracted to the improved environment of the treated fields. Farmers are getting even better yields when they dig small pockets, or zai, over the land treated with stone lines. Zai can vary in size, but are usually {{about the size of a}} dinner plate; they are as deep as they are wide and are placed some 80 cm apart. The pockets collect rainfall runoff, and farmers add a handful of compost to them before planting sorghum. Land with stone lines and zai can yield up to 1000 kg / hectare of sorghum in a normal rainfall year. In one area, trees are being established successfully by planting seeds straight into the zai instead of growing seedlings in a nursery and then transplanting them. Another technique for water conservation is the use of permeable stone dams, built across gullies, that hold back soil and water that would normally be lost. In Rissiam, over 100 such dams have been built, providing excellent growing conditions in the former gullies behind the dams. Farmers are also getting good results by using straw or cut grass as a mulch. It was a traditional practice that went out Of fashion, but is now becoming popular again. These soil and water conservation activities are not only increasing yields: farmers are seeing trees that were dying now being revived and wells which had dried up having water in them once again. Compost making has increased considerably and many farmers now see advantages to enclosing small livestock, both to provide a source of manure and to stop them damaging stone lines as they graze. A constraint now is the lack of transport to move the compost out to the fields, as carrying large quantities by head load is impossible. These techniques are spreading extensively from farmer to farmer as they adapt, experiment and innovate to suit their needs and abilities.

40|$|AbstractBackground: Profilins {{are small}} {{eukaryotic}} proteins involved in modulating {{the assembly of}} actin microfilaments in the cytoplasm. They are able to bind both phosphatidylinositol- 4, 5 -bisphosphate and poly-L-proline (PLP) and thus {{play a critical role}} in signaling pathways. Plant profilins are of interest because immunological cross-reactivity between pollen and human profilin may be the cause of hay fever and broad allergies to pollens. Results: The determination of the Arabidopsis thaliana profilin isoform I structure, using multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) to obtain structure-factor phases, is reported here. The structure of Arabidopsis profilin is similar to that of previously determined profilin structures. Conserved amino acid residues in profilins from plants, mammals, and lower eukaryotes are critically important in dictating the geometry of the PLP-binding site and the overall polypeptide fold. The main feature distinguishing plant profilins from other profilins is a solvent-filled pocket located in the most variable region of the fold. Conclusions: Comparison of the structures of SH 3 domains with those of profilins from three distinct sources suggests that the mode of PLP binding may be similar. A comparison of three profilin structures from different families reveals only partial conservation of the actin-binding surface. The proximity of the semi-conserved actin-binding site and the binding <b>pocket</b> characteristic of <b>plant</b> profilins suggests that epitopes encompassing both features are responsible for the cross-reactivity of antibodies between human and plant profilins thought to be responsible for type I allergies...|$|R
40|$|Farmers in the {{semi-arid}} {{regions of}} West Africa face challenges related to poor crop establishment, variable rainfall, low soil fertility and {{a shortage of}} labour at times of peak demand. Farmers are generally low on resources. Given these conditions, {{it is important to}} develop farming practices that make efficient use of the available resources and reduce risks. Here, we review agricultural intensification in semi-arid West Africa using the principles of precision farming to assess the possibilities they offer. The basic idea is to create a favourable micro-environment in the <b>planting</b> <b>pocket</b> and to ensure timely sowing and weeding. In the context of precision farming in the semi-arid West Africa, this means (1) large seeds are selected, primed and treated with a mix of pesticides/fungicides. Seed priming increases yields in the order of 20 to 30 %, while seed treatment increases yields by 15 %. (2) Mineral fertilizers are applied; at doses as low as 0. 3 g of fertilizer per pocket, they have been found to increase yields by half or more. (3) Seeds and fertilizers are distributed accurately by means of a combined planter-weeder, which can be motorized. (4) Mechanized sowing and weeding enable timely farm operations and reduce the workload. (5) Water loss is prevented by using zaï and stone bunds on soils with high run-off rates. (6) Care is taken to make use of farm resources in a targeted and efficient way. This can imply adjusting micro-doses of manure and fertilizer to crops (sorghum needs less than millet) and soil types, sequenced sowing of crops according to their vulnerability to delayed sowing and applying organic input to soils. This paper is the first to review agricultural intensification in semi-arid West Africa within the context of precision farming. It shows how a low-cost package for precision farming can be developed, which can help to increase land and labour productivity, and works with all the major field crops in the region...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Food {{production}} {{among the}} majority of agro-pastoral households in rural Mali are hampered by low rainfall, infertile soil, and extreme poverty. To improve productivity and enhance livelihood, the Drylands Coordination Group implemented the project Ecofarm on the farmers’ field from the year 2004 to 2008 with technical assistance from the Department of International Environment and Development Studies (NORAGRIC) at Norwegian University of Life Sciences. The project tests the ability of low cost technologies to increase productivity and income {{in order to help}} poor farmers achieve a better livelihood. This study assessed the degree of Ecofarm technology adoption, identified the reasons for adoption, and investigated the impact of adoption on the livelihoods. The study was carried out in the regions of Segou, Mopti and Koulikoro of Mali. Cross-sectional surveys were carried out in 12 randomly selected villages from the three regions in which 120 household heads were selected. A semi-structured questionnaire and interviews were applied to collect quantitative and qualitative data from household heads. Interviews with local and international NGOs were carried out using a Snowball sampling approach. Results indicate that a wide range of technologies have been disseminated in the surveyed area by NGOs, but the Ecofarm technologies were the most adopted. The result shows that microdosin, the application of 0. 3 grams of fertilizer in the <b>planting</b> <b>pocket</b> simultaneously with sowing or 15 to 20 days after cultivation; is adopted by 68. 1 % of the household. While there are about 51. 3 % farmers adopting seed priming; the soaking of seed or grain in water before cultivation. The cross tabulation result indicates a variation in gender adoption of microdosing and seed priming. About 70. 2 % of men adopted microdosing while 61. 1 % women of women adopted microdsoing. Yet a chi square result shows no significant association between gender and adoption of microdosing technology. From the focus group discussion, it emerged that women adopt less of fertilizer microdosing technology as compared to seed priming because of the workload attached. Results show increased crop yield with the application of fertilizer microdosing across regions. In Segou, average quantity of millet increased from 240 kg per hectare using traditional practices to 855 kg per hectare with microdosing technology. Sorghum yield increased from 260 kg using traditional practices to 805 kg per hectare using microdosing technology in Segou. In Mopti millet and sorghum, yield increased from 125 kg and 155 kg per hectare using traditional practices, to 500 kg and 430 kg per hectare respectively with microdosing technology. The gross output results show that the project has contributed to increasing farmers’ income. In Koulikoro, microdosing of millet gave farmers a net benefit of 159508 fcfa per hectare as compared to 1708 fcfa using traditional practices. In Segou, microdosing of millet gave a net benefit of 144837 fcfa as compared to 37974 fcfa using traditional practices. While in Mopti, microdosing of millet gave farmers a net benefit of 81363 fcfa per hectare as compared to 21000 fcfa using traditional practices. With sorghum, farmers who applied microdosing technology recorded an impressive net benefit of about 175087 fcfa per hectare in Segou as compared to 54974 fcfa using traditional practices. While those in Mopti and Koulikoro recorded a net benefit of 88863 fcfa and 42259 fcfa per hectare with microdosing technology, respectively as compared to 34750 fcfa and 37708 fcfa using traditional practices respectively. Land size owned was one of the major determinants of the quantity of fertilizer use (adoption). The result indicates that the adoption of microdosing continues to increase with land size until it reaches a point where it starts decreasing. Similar trend was observed across regions. In Segou, average land owned by a framer was 18. 1 hectares. Yet, just 1. 1 hectares were used for microdosing as compared to Mopti and Koulikoro where average land size owned was 11. 8 hectares and 4. 9 hectares respectively, yet 4. 8 hectares and 2. 2 respectively were used for fertilizer microdosing technology. Livestock fattening technology; tying of livestock to a tree or stick and feeding them with the leftover of cowpea and leaves, accelerated growth of livestock and increased income of the farmers. A sheep bought at a price of 23. 000 fcfa is sold for 55. 000 fcfa within 6 months in Segou if fattening technology is practiced. The same amount spent on the same livestock generates an average of about 60. 000 fcfa and 65. 000 fcfa in Mopti and Koulikoro, respectively. The number of trees planted on farmers field has dramatically increased. In Segou, each farmer has planted an average 122. 2 trees, while those in Mopti and Koulikoro has planted an average of about 105, 8 and 99. 9 trees respectively in the surveyed areas. The simple linear regressions result shows that a number of dependants’ variable was positively and significantly related with adoption while variables such as distance to fertilizer, land size and prices of fertilizer used in the regression show a negative significant relationship with adoption. However, when all the above mentioned variables were put in a multiple regression, only distance to fertilizer showed a positive significant relationship with adoption. Testimonies from the village of Dafara indicate that feeding on Moringa powder for a three month period increased the breast milk of a mother and contributed to an improvement in the health of a previously sick child. Moreover, adding Moringa powder to the diet improved the men potency. The survey and the common impression from farmers’ testimonies is that those who adopted Ecofarm technologies experienced reduction in months of food insecurity, increased income, better health and nutrition and a general improvement in livelihood. Focus group discussion showed that the project has contributed to increased input outlets. Cross tabulation analyses of response from the 12 villages indicate that the Ecofarm technologies have been scaled up into about 51 villages. The multiple regression result suggests a need for strengthening fertilizer outlet for a majority of farmers to adopt microdosing technology. Information dissemination by NGOs to farmers concerning seed preservation after soaking in water has also been indicated...|$|R

In Segou, microdosing of millet gave a net benefit of 144837 fcfa as compared to 37974 fcfa using traditional practices. While in Mopti, microdosing of millet gave farmers a net benefit of 81363 fcfa per hectare as compared to 21000 fcfa using traditional practices. With sorghum, farmers who applied microdosing technology recorded an impressive net benefit of about 175087 fcfa per hectare in Segou as compared to 54974 fcfa using traditional practices. While those in Mopti and Koulikoro recorded a net benefit of 88863 fcfa and 42259 fcfa per hectare with microdosing technology, respectively as compared to 34750 fcfa and 37708 fcfa using traditional practices respectively. Land size owned was one of the major determinants of the quantity of fertilizer use (adoption). The result indicates that the adoption of microdosing continues to increase with land size until it reaches a point where it starts decreasing. Similar trend was observed across regions. In Segou, average land owned by a framer was 18. 1 hectares. Yet, just 1. 1 hectares were used for microdosing as compared to Mopti and Koulikoro where average land size owned was 11. 8 hectares and 4. 9 hectares respectively, yet 4. 8 hectares and 2. 2 respectively were used for fertilizer microdosing technology. Livestock fattening technology; tying of livestock to a tree or stick and feeding them with the leftover of cowpea and leaves, accelerated growth of livestock and increased income of the farmers. A sheep bought at a price of 23. 000 fcfa is sold for 55. 000 fcfa within 6 months in Segou if fattening technology is practiced. The same amount spent on the same livestock generates an average of about 60. 000 fcfa and 65. 000 fcfa in Mopti and Koulikoro, respectively. The number of trees planted on farmers field has dramatically increased. In Segou, each farmer has planted an average 122. 2 trees, while those in Mopti and Koulikoro has planted an average of about 105, 8 and 99. 9 trees respectively in the surveyed areas. The simple linear regressions result shows that a number of dependants’ variable was positively and significantly related with adoption while variables such as distance to fertilizer, land size and prices of fertilizer used in the regression show a negative significant relationship with adoption. However, when all the above mentioned variables were put in a multiple regression, only distance to fertilizer showed a positive significant relationship with adoption. Testimonies from the village of Dafara indicate that feeding on Moringa powder for a three month period increased the breast milk of a mother and contributed to an improvement in the health of a previously sick child. Moreover, adding Moringa powder to the diet improved the men potency. The survey and the common impression from farmers’ testimonies is that those who adopted Ecofarm technologies experienced reduction in months of food insecurity, increased income, better health and nutrition and a general improvement in livelihood. Focus group discussion showed that the project has contributed to increased input outlets. Cross tabulation analyses of response from the 12 villages indicate that the Ecofarm technologies have been scaled up into about 51 villages. The multiple regression result suggests a need for strengthening fertilizer outlet for a majority of farmers to adopt microdosing technology. Information dissemination by NGOs to farmers concerning seed preservation after soaking in water has also been indicated. Drylands Cordination Group, Norwa...|$|R
