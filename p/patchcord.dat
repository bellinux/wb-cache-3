40|$|We {{experimentally}} compare various adaptive algorithms {{that use}} a {{spatial light modulator}} (SLM) to compensate modal dispersion in 50 - m graded-index multimode fibers. We show that continuous-phase sequential coordinate ascent (CPSCA) gives better bit-error-ratio performance than 2 - or 4 -phase sequential coordinate ascent, in concordance with simulations in [10]. We then evaluate the bandwidth characteristics of CPSCA, and show that a single SLM is able to simultaneously compensate the modal dispersion in up to 9 wavelength-division-multiplexed 10 -Gb/s channels, spaced by 50 GHz, over a total bandwidth of 450 GHz. We also show that CPSCA is able to compensate for modal dispersion in fibers up to 2. 2 km long, even {{in the presence of}} midspan connector offsets up to 4 m (simulated in experiment by offset splices).

Despite initial problems, using of this medium {{in recent years has}} greatly expanded due to their indisputable advantages. Optical cable is a great combination of reliability and security of data transfer. Its constantly improving transmission parameters contribute to the high speeds in the long-distance transmission of data. In the theoretical part of this work some kinds of optical cables are mentioned, also the most important parameters and the most widely used methods of measurement of these cables. Apart from that other methods of joining optical cables and the most used types of optical cables are also mentioned. The values of the decline and reflection, which are led into the device after connecting these parts into the optical lines. The device using the measuring method of the reverse reflection is also described in this thesis altogether with its most important parts and the way of the display of the measured track on the graphic image of the device. The problematics of identification and decline dead zone and the factors influencing the lenght of dead zone – the ability to identify two independent events on the link <b>patchcord</b> of the variable lenght, is also described in details in this thesis.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{shows the}} effect of bending radius and bending {{location}} on Insertion Loss (IL) in Single Mode Fibers (SMFs) and Polarization Maintaining Fibers (PMFs). Five FC/UPC PMF <b>patchcords</b> were tested for {{the effect of}} bending radius on IL, by being coiled from 0 (as reference) to 5 loops at bending radii of 7. 5 mm to 17. 5 mm in a step of 2. 5 mm. Based on the significant IL changes at 7. 5 -mm radius and no change starting at 15 -mm radius, these two radii were chosen {{for the study of}} bending location. Fifteen <b>patchcords</b> (5 FC/UPC PMF, 5 LC/UPC PMF and 5 LC/UPC SMF) were coiled for 1 full loop located at 20 cm to 100 cm in a step of 10 cm. At 7. 5 -mm radius, PMFs reveal their major IL variations strongly depending on bending location, while SMFs have minor variations. In contrast, no IL variations are observed at 15 -mm radius for both PMFs and SMFs. This radius was then selected for the final study on a number of coils. All 15 <b>patchcords</b> were coiled up to 15 loops at 15 -mm radius. The results exhibit insignificant IL increase for PMFs, but a small increase proportional to the number of coils for SMFs. Consequently, the benefit of these IL studies will validate the proper testing conditions for SMF and PMF <b>patchcords,</b> especially in PMFs, where the measurement of Polarization Extinction Ratio is correlated with IL...|$|R

40|$|A two color laser speckle shift strain {{measurement}} {{system based on}} the technique of Yamaguchi was designed. The dual wavelength light output from an Argon Ion laser was coupled into two separate single-mode optical fibers (<b>patchcords).</b> The output of the <b>patchcords</b> is incident on the test specimen (here a structural fiber). Strain on the fiber, in one direction, is produced using an Instron 4502. Shifting interference patterns or speckle patterns will be detected at real-time rates using 2 CCD cameras with image processing performed by a hardware correlator. Strain detected in fibers with diameters from 21 microns to 143 microns {{is expected to be}} resolved to 15 mu epsilon.
