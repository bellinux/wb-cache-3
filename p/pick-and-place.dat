50|$|A popular {{application}} for serial robots in today's industry is the <b>pick-and-place</b> assembly robot, called a SCARA robot, which has four degrees of freedom.|$|E
50|$|Another {{reason for}} the {{nickname}} of MELF components is that most production engineers {{do not like to}} use MELF nozzles on a SMT <b>pick-and-place</b> machine. For them it is waste of time to change from flat nozzles to MELF nozzles. For MICRO-MELF and MINI-MELF most SMD placers are able to use flat chip nozzles if the vacuum is high enough; i.e., higher than for flat chip components. For MELFs with the case size of 0207 or less, it is recommend to use the original MELF nozzle supplied with the SMT machine. Each supplier of such SMD <b>pick-and-place</b> machines offers these types of nozzles.|$|E
50|$|Servo {{controlled}} motion systems employ {{linear encoder}} {{so as to}} provide accurate, high-speed movement.

50|$|The perfect {{combination}} of acceleration and precision (repeatability and positioning) offers very high productivity of {{machines in the}} semiconductor and electronics industry. Reachable accelerations of such <b>pick-and-place</b> systems are not a problem. Micro-nozzle air bearings, however, offer a much higher acceleration (more than 50 m/s) than conventional air bearings (4 to 5 m/s).|$|E
50|$|Where {{components}} {{are to be}} placed, the printed circuit board normally has flat, usually tin-lead, silver, or gold plated copper pads without holes, called solder pads. Solder paste, a sticky mixture of flux and tiny solder particles, is first applied to all the solder pads with a stainless steel or nickel stencil using a screen printing process. It can also be applied by a jet-printing mechanism, similar to an inkjet printer. After pasting, the boards then proceed to the <b>pick-and-place</b> machines, where they are placed on a conveyor belt. The components {{to be placed on}} the boards are usually delivered to the production line in either paper/plastic tapes wound on reels or plastic tubes. Some large integrated circuits are delivered in static-free trays. Numerical control <b>pick-and-place</b> machines remove the parts from the tapes, tubes or trays and place them on the PCB.|$|E
50|$|Mass-produced {{printed circuit}} boards (PCBs) are almost {{exclusively}} manufactured by <b>pick-and-place</b> robots, typically with SCARA manipulators, which remove tiny electronic components from strips or trays, and place them on to PCBs with great accuracy.

50|$|During {{automated}} SMT <b>pick-and-place,</b> {{this happens}} mostly if the mechanical {{pressure of the}} SMD placer nozzle is too low. If the MELF components are placed into the solder paste with enough pressure, then this problem can be minimized. Care must be taken with glass diodes which are less mechanically robust than resistors and other MELF components.|$|E
50|$|These {{handling}} difficulties prompted {{development of}} alternative SMT packages for common MELF components (like diodes) where the power handling capability {{needed to be}} similar to MELF components (superior to low-power 0805/0603, etc. SMT components) but with improved automated <b>pick-and-place</b> handling characteristics. This resulted in various squared-off packages with fold-over contacts, similar to rectangular inductor/tantalum capacitor packages.|$|E
50|$|Test arenas vary between competitions, {{though they}} are {{composed}} of obstacles designed to allow for repeatable results. The obstacles are arranged in color-coded areas, including a yellow area in which robots must operate autonomously; a red area containing stairs and a 45° ramp; an orange area containing intermediate-difficulty obstacles; a <b>pick-and-place</b> area; and a radio drop-out area.|$|E

Some machines are also able to measure the PCB shear by measuring a third fiducial mark on the PCB.|$|E
50|$|SMT (surface mount technology) {{component}} placement systems, {{commonly called}} <b>pick-and-place</b> machines or P&Ps, are robotic machines {{which are used}} to place surface-mount devices (SMDs) onto {{a printed circuit board}} (PCB).

50|$|The slave (the actual {{subject of}} dr.ir. Van den Bedem's thesis) is a robotic arm frame which can {{accommodate}} three independent manipulators (two for surgical tools, {{one for a}} camera). The frame for the manipulators is of the type used for <b>pick-and-place</b> robots, allowing the manipulators full freedom of motion in space. This means that the surgeon can also choose the optimal direction of approach for any organ, {{rather than having to}} move the patient to suit the machine. Of course the manipulators also provide force feedback through the overhead cable boom.|$|E
50|$|Solder paste is a {{material}} {{used in the}} manufacture of printed circuit boards to connect surface mount components to pads on the board. It is also possible to solder through hole pin in paste components by print solder paste in/over the holes. The paste initially adheres components in place by being sticky, it is then heated (along {{with the rest of the}} board) melting the paste and forming a mechanical connection as well as an electrical connection. The paste is applied to the board by stencil printing and then the components are put in place by a <b>pick-and-place</b> machine or by hand.|$|E

50|$|Nanocrystal {{displays}} {{would render}} {{as much as}} a 30% increase in the visible spectrum, while using 30 to 50% less power than LCDs, in large part because nanocrystal displays wouldn't need backlighting. QD LEDs are 50-100 times brighter than CRT and LCD displays, emitting 40,000 cd/m2. QDs are soluble in both aqueous and non-aqueous solvents, which provides for printable and flexible displays of all sizes, including large area TVs. QDs can be inorganic, offering the potential for improved lifetimes compared to OLED (however, since many parts of QD-LED are often made of organic materials, further development is required to improve the functional lifetime.) In addition to OLED displays, <b>pick-and-place</b> microLED displays are emerging as competing technologies to nanocrystal displays.|$|E
50|$|From {{the high}} speed machine, the board transits to a {{precision}} placement machine. These <b>pick-and-place</b> machines often use high resolution verification cameras and fine adjustment systems via high precision linear encoders on each axis to place parts more accurately than the high-speed machines. Furthermore, the precision placement machines {{are capable of}} handling larger or more irregularly shaped parts such as large package integrated circuits or packaged inductor coils and trimpots. Unlike the rapid placers, precision placers generally do not use turret mounted nozzles and instead rely on a gantry-supported moving head. These precision placers rely upon placement heads with relatively few pickup nozzles. The head sometimes has a laser identifier that scans a reflective marker on the PC Board to orient the head to the board. Parts are picked up from tape feeders or trays, scanned by a camera (on some machines), and then placed in the proper position on the board. Some machines also center the parts {{on the head with}} two arms that close to center the part; the head then rotates 90 degrees and the arms close again to center the part once more. The margin of error for some components is, in many cases, less than half a millimeter (less than 0.02 inches). The process is a little slower than rapid placement, necessitating careful line balancing when setting up a job, lest the precision placement machine become a production bottleneck.|$|E
40|$|Dual-arm robots are {{expected}} to perform work in a dynamic environment. One {{of the most basic}} tasks that a dual-arm robot does is <b>pick-and-place</b> work. However, this work is more complicated when there are several objects in the robot’s workspace. Additionally, it is likely {{to take a long time}} to finish the work as the number of objects increases. Therefore, we propose a method using a combination of two approaches to achieve efficient <b>pick-and-place</b> performance by a dual-arm robot to minimize its operation time. First, we use mixed integer linear programming (MILP) for the <b>pick-and-place</b> work to determine which arm should move an object and in which order these objects should be moved while considering the dual-arm robot’s operation range. Second, we plan the path using the rapidly exploring random tree so that the arms do not collide, enabling the robot to perform efficient <b>pick-and-place</b> work based on the MILP planning solution. The effectiveness of the proposed method is confirmed by simulations and experiments using an actual dual-arm robot...|$|E

The second experiment involved visual enhancements of the monoscopic perspective display, by adding a grid and reference lines, by comparison with visual enhancements of a stereoscopic display; results indicate that stereoscopy generally permits superior <b>pick-and-place</b> performance, but that monoscopy nevertheless allows equivalent performance when defined with appropriate perspective parameter values and adequate visual enhancements...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Applications of the {{conventional}} atomic force microscope (AFM) succeeded in manipulating nanoparticles, nanowires or nanotubes by widely used pushing or pulling operations on a single plane. However, <b>pick-and-place</b> nanoma-nipulation is still a challenge in the air. In this paper, a modified AFM, called three-dimensional (3 D) manipulation force microscope (3 DMFM) was developed, aiming to achieve the <b>pick-and-place</b> in the air. This system mainly consists of two microcantilevers and each is quipped with a nanopositioning device and an optical lever, constructing a nanotweezer with capabilities of picking and releasing nanoobjects with force sensing. Before the 3 D manipulation, one of the cantilevers is employed to position nanoobjects and locate the tip of another cantilever by image scanning, then these two cantilevers fit together as a nanotweezer to grasp, transport and place the nanoobjects with real-time force sensing. In <b>pick-and-place</b> experiments, silicon nanowires (SiNMs) with different diameters were manipulated and 3 D nanowire crosses were achieved. 3 D nanomanipulation and nanoassembly in the air could become feasible through the newly developed 3 DMFM.

40|$|<b>Pick-and-place</b> regrasp is an {{important}} manipulation skill for a robot. It helps a robot accomplish tasks that cannot be achieved within a single grasp, due to constraints such as kinematics or collisions between the robot and the environment. Previous work on <b>pick-and-place</b> regrasp only leveraged flat surfaces for intermediate placements, and thus is limited in the capability to reorient an object. In this paper, we extend the reorientation capability of a <b>pick-and-place</b> regrasp by adding a vertical pin on the working surface and using it as the intermediate location for regrasping. In particular, our method automatically computes the stable placements of an object leaning against a vertical pin, finds several force-closure grasps, generates a graph of regrasp actions, and searches for the regrasp sequence. To compare the regrasping performance with and without using pins, we evaluate the success rate {{and the length of}} regrasp sequences while performing tasks on various models. Experiments on reorientation and assembly tasks validate the benefit of using support pins for regrasping. Comment: 14 pages, 20 figure...|$|E
