Therefore, in this paper is analysed deflection, slope angle and safety factor of {{the rotating}} shaft depending on {{the position of the}} drum at the optimised <b>Winch</b> <b>Haulage.</b> The mathematic model of {{the rotating shaft}} is elaborated in detail, taking into consideration the dimensions after optimization of the <b>Winch</b> <b>Haulage.</b> The results <b>for</b> the adopted model, for the dimensions before and after optimization, are satisfactory and present a good starting point for modification {{in the design of the}} <b>Winch</b> <b>Haulage...</b>|$|R
