5|$|Controversy {{surrounds}} the breakout {{before the last}} stand—which various writers have posited might have actually been desertion—and a box of gold sovereigns, which a Matabele inDuna (leader) later claimed {{had been given to}} two unidentified men from Forbes's rear guard on 2 December, along with a message that Lobengula admitted defeat and wanted the column to stop pursuing him. Two batmen were initially found guilty of accepting the gold, keeping it for themselves and not <b>passing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> message, but the evidence against them was inconclusive and largely circumstantial; the convictions were ultimately overturned.|$|E
5|$|Edward Robinson {{visited in}} 1838, {{and noted that}} the khan, which Maundrell commented on, was for the {{accommodation}} of the caravans <b>passing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> great road between Egypt and Damascus which Lajjun comes over the hills from the western plain along the coast and enters that of Esdraelon. When the British consul James Finn visited {{the area in the}} mid-19th century, he did not see a village. The authors of the Survey of Western Palestine also noticed a khan, however, south of the ruins of Lajjun in the early 1880s.|$|E

The highway curves due north, having an interchange with University Boulevard. After the interchange with University Boulevard, the road curves northwest, passing over SR444.

5|$|Two officers' batmen, William Charles Daniel and James Wilson (no {{relation}} to Allan Wilson), soon became prime suspects, with Daniel arraigned as the senior instigator. They {{were accused of}} accepting the gold from Petchan and Sehuloholu, then keeping it for themselves and not <b>passing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> message. Both men denied all charges. Neither Daniel nor Wilson had been members of the rear guard on 2 December, though either or both could have been there {{at some point during}} the day. No Matabele witness recognised either of them at the court in Bulawayo, where the case was heard by the Resident Magistrate and four assessors.|$|E
5|$|After {{breaking}} up with Owen, Cristina continues to excel at surgery and becomes de facto chief of cardio. Although supportive of Meredith's choice to become a mother, Cristina points {{out the fact that}} it has hurt Meredith's career and clinical judgement. This causes a wedge in their friendship. Grey attempts to catch up professionally with a research trial, but the divide widens when Cristina's trial overshadows Grey's and steals Grey's resources. When Dr. Shane Ross, a second-year resident, stands up to Meredith for her, Cristina gives Shane a kiss. Later, she begins sleeping with him, as well as becoming his mentor and <b>passing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> skills learned from Altman. Cristina's project is immensely successful and she is informed that she could be considered for the Harper Avery award from her 3-D printing of a heart conduit. Grey and Yang reconcile when Grey acknowledges that Yang is correct, she has surpassed Grey, and that Grey is jealous of Yang's professional freedom and success, while her own is hampered by her family.|$|E
5|$|Edward {{had such}} trust in his {{chancellor}} and the chancellor's clerks that Burnell and the clerks {{were allowed to}} dispense with the hanaper system, which required fees for sealing charters to be paid into the hanaper department of the Chancery for disbursal. Robert and his clerks were permitted to enjoy the profits from the fees of their office. Burnell was also responsible for the decision to force the Court of Chancery to settle in London, rather than following the king and his court around the country. A Chancery memorandum of 1280 records that the chancellor, {{along with the other}} ministers, now had the duty of sorting the many petitions that came into the government and only <b>passing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> most urgent to the king.|$|E

Oklahoma took over at their own 25 yardline after a touchback on the kickoff. Jones was 6/8 for 43 yards <b>passing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> drive.

On the ensuing drive, Texas A was forced to punt after {{achieving}} only one first down.|$|E
5|$|The Bulls {{were led}} offensively by the triple threat of quarterback Drew Willy, running back James Starks, and wide {{receiver}} Namaan Roosevelt. The three combined to break 14single-season school records, including most points scored in a season (404). Willy, heading into his final game as a Buffalo Bull, had already surpassed the 3,000-yard mark in <b>passing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> season, throwing for 25touchdowns against only fiveinterceptions. Starks, while not seen as the same caliber of player as UConn's Donald Brown, had run for over 1,300yards and caught 41passes for 340yards, scoring 16touchdowns on the year. Roosevelt {{was seen as the}} top playmaker, going over the 100-yard mark in each of Buffalo's last fivegames and scoring at least once in his last seven.|$|E
5|$|The {{race was}} a story of pit strategy, as the only <b>passing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> circuit was of lapped traffic. Albers was the only car to run a three pit stop race, as all other drivers chose to stop only twice. The only lead changes came on lap 26, as Schumacher's 32-second stop gave Barrichello the lead, and on lap 51, as Schumacher turned in the quickest pit stop at 23.615 seconds, giving him enough time to exit pit lane {{at the same time}} as Barrichello, with the result of forcing Barrichello into the grass of Turn One. After this incident, which was not {{investigated}} by race officials, both Ferrari drivers were reminded over their radios not to crash out of the race, and they both settled into a slower pace, comfortably ahead of the rest of the field. All four of the drivers for Jordan and Minardi scored their first points in Formula One at this race. Karthikeyan's points were the first for an Indian driver in Formula One. This was also the final race at which the Minardi team tallied points.|$|E

5|$|His {{most notorious}} exploit {{took place during}} the Crimean War on 25 October 1854 when, in command of the Light Cavalry Brigade at the battle of Balaclava, he led the Charge of the Light Brigade {{reaching}} the Russian guns before returning, personally unscathed, in a manoeuvre that cost the lives of about 107 out of the 674 men under his command {{who took part in the}} charge (although others may have died of wounds later on). The extent to which Lord Cardigan was to blame is unproven, since he attacked only after expressing his doubts and receiving a direct order in front of the troops from his immediate superior Lord Lucan, Commander of the Cavalry Division. The two men were barely on speaking terms as Lucan was married to one of Cardigan's sisters and, as Cardigan believed, did not treat her well. The order had been conveyed by Captain Louis Nolan, who died in the charge, and both Lucan and Cardigan blamed him for <b>passing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> order incorrectly. Cardigan's first action on his return from the charge was to report the undisciplined behaviour of Captain Nolan (whom he did not know to be dead) in riding ahead of him at the start of the attack.|$|E
5|$|Tom Hanks as Forrest Gump: Though at {{an early}} age he is deemed to have a below average IQ of 75, he has an endearing {{character}} and shows devotion to his loved ones and duties, character traits which bring him into many life-changing situations. Along the way, he encounters many historical figures and events throughout his life. Tom's younger brother Jim Hanks is his acting double in the movie for the scenes when Forrest runs across the U.S. Tom's daughter Elizabeth Hanks appears in the movie as the girl on the school bus who refuses to let young Forrest (Michael Conner Humphreys) sit next to her. John Travolta was the original choice to play the title role, and admits <b>passing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> role was a mistake. Bill Murray and Chevy Chase were also considered for the role. Sean Penn stated in an interview having been second choice for the role. Hanks revealed that he signed onto the film after {{an hour and a half}} of reading the script. He initially wanted to ease Forrest's pronounced Southern accent, but was eventually persuaded by director Robert Zemeckis to portray the heavy accent stressed in the novel. Hanks agreed to take the role only on the condition that the film was historically accurate.|$|E
