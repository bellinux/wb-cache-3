5|$|Arbeideren ("The Worker") was a Norwegian newspaper, {{published}} in Hamar, Hedmark county. It {{was started in}} 1909 as the <b>press</b> <b>organ</b> of the Labour Party in Hedemarken and its adjoining regions, and was called Demokraten ("The Democrat") until 1923. It was issued {{three days a week}} between 1909 and 1913, six days a week in 1914, three days a week again between 1914 and 1918 before again increasing to six days a week. It was renamed to Arbeideren in 1923, and in the same year it was taken over by the Norwegian Communist Party. The Communist Party incorporated the newspaper Gudbrandsdalens Arbeiderblad into Arbeideren in 1924, and until 1929 the newspaper was published under the name Arbeideren og Gudbrandsdalens Arbeiderblad. After Arbeideren had gone defunct, the name was used by the Communist Party for other newspapers elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|By then, {{underground}} propaganda was depicting Antonescu {{as a new}} {{and less}} qualified version of the infamous Elena Lupescu, who had been Carol II's mistress and string-puller. According to writer Ion Caraion, the ridicule she was subjected to by adversaries of the Antonescu regime was unwittingly reflected by the <b>press</b> <b>organ</b> Timpul. Unknown hands subverted the caption of a photograph showing her, Veturia Goga and Sanda Manuilă visiting a soldier's hospital, to read {{as if they were}} having intercourse with the wounded.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} stage of World War I, when the Kingdom of Romania {{maintained}} its neutrality, Rodion grew close to the political circles comprising Germanophiles, neutralist socialists or pacifists. Like his colleagues there, Rodion was not a keen supporter of making Romania part of the Entente camp; he looked with more sympathy toward the German Empire and the Central Powers. He was allied with Panait Zosin and Sebastian Moruzzi, two left-wing dissidents from the Conservative-Democratic Party. Rodion contributed to Zosin's <b>press</b> <b>organ,</b> Îndrumarea, which advanced election reform and complete Jewish emancipation.|$|E

25|$|In 1896, {{together}} with Nicolae Vermont, Constantin Artachino, {{and the art}} collector, Alexandru Bogdan-Pitești, Stefan Luchian {{was one of the}} main founders of Bucharest's Salonul Independenţilor, which was opened in front of the official Salon (the Romanian equivalent of the Paris Salon). Two years later, the group led to the creation of Societatea Ileana and its <b>press</b> <b>organ,</b> Ileana, with Luchian as the original illustrator. From then on Luchian began integrating Symbolist elements in his work, taking inspiration from various related trends: Art Nouveau, Jugendstil and Mir iskusstva (see Symbolist movement in Romania).|$|E
25|$|The August 23, 1944 Coup {{unsealed}} Romania's {{alliance with}} Nazi Germany, {{and brought back}} democracy, but also signified the onset of Soviet occupation. Shortly after the legalization of political parties, Baciu became editor of the Social Democratic <b>press</b> <b>organ</b> Libertatea ("Liberty"). From October 1944 to December 1945, he edited his own illustrated satirical review, Humorul ("Humor"). Meanwhile, he also put out new selections from his poetry: Cântecul mulțimii ("Song of the Crowd"), with a preface by Ion Pas, came out at the PSDR party press in 1944; Caiet de vacanță ("Notebook for the Holidays") at Unirea of Râmnicu Vâlcea in 1945. His circle of acquaintances grew to include {{some members of the}} Bucharest surrealist circle, in particular Sesto Pals (who was Baciu's lifelong friend) and Dolfi Trost.|$|E
25|$|Between 1944 and 1947, Cioculescu held {{a column}} in Dreptatea, the main <b>press</b> <b>organ</b> of the National Peasants' Party—a main {{representative}} of {{the opposition to the}} increasingly powerful Romanian Communist Party. Also in 1944, he joined Vianu and Streinu in authoring Istoria literaturii române moderne ("The History of Modern Romanian Literature"). The following year, he made his debut as a theater critic and chronicler, after accepting to collaborate with the short-lived newspaper Semnalul (published by lawyer Sebastian Şerbescu). Shortly after Lovinescu's death, Cioculescu {{was also one of the}} literary professionals on the commission granting the newly established Lovinescu memorial award, presented to aspiring authors such as Ştefan Augustin Doinaş. His next book, Introducere în opera lui Tudor Arghezi ("An Introduction to the Work of Tudor Arghezi"), was printed in 1946.|$|E

25|$|La Dolce Vita broke all {{box office}} records. Despite scalpers selling tickets at 1000 lire, crowds queued {{in line for}} hours to see an “immoral movie” before the censors banned it. At an {{exclusive}} Milan screening on 5 February 1960, one outraged patron spat on Fellini while others hurled insults. Denounced in parliament by right-wing conservatives, undersecretary Domenico Magrì of the Christian Democrats demanded tolerance for the film’s controversial themes. The Vatican's official <b>press</b> <b>organ,</b> l'Osservatore Romano, lobbied for censorship while the Board of Roman Parish Priests and the Genealogical Board of Italian Nobility attacked the film. In one documented instance involving favourable reviews written by the Jesuits of San Fedele, defending La Dolce Vita had severe consequences. In competition at Cannes alongside Antonioni’s L’Avventura, the film won the Palme d'Or awarded by presiding juror Georges Simenon. The Belgian writer was promptly “hissed at” by the disapproving festival crowd.|$|E
25|$|Other texts by Aderca saw {{print in}} Punct (a provincial {{satellite}} of Contimporanul, founded and edited by Scarlat Callimachi), and in Omul Liber daily, where, in 1923, he denounced novelist Cezar Petrescu for having plagiarized {{the writings of}} Guy de Maupassant. His ideas on Jewish community life saw print in Lumea Evree, a bimonthly put out by philosopher Iosif Brucăr. His other articles and various pieces were scattered throughout literary reviews: Viața Românească, Vremea, Ideea Europeană, Adevărul Literar și Artistic, Flacăra, Revista Fundațiilor Regale, Revista Literară and the literary supplement of Universul all featured his work. Researcher Dumitru Hîncu, who counts some 60 publications to have enlisted Aderca's contribution, also notes his collaboration with Îndreptarea, the <b>press</b> <b>organ</b> of Alexandru Averescu's People's Party. In addition to signing with his name or initials (capitalized or not), Aderca {{used a variety of}} pseudonyms, including Willy, W. and Oliver, A. Tutova, Clifford Moore, F. Lix, Lix, and N. Popov. He was also using the names Masca de fier ("The Iron Mask"), Masca de catifea ("The Velvet Mask") and Omul cu mască de mătase ("The Man with the Silk Mask").|$|E
500|$|The new circle held {{meetings}} in a Brezoianu Street studio {{which was also}} its patron's home. Its feminine name Ileana was probably a borrowing from Romanian folklore, and may reference the fairy tale character Ileana Cosânzeana. The group's <b>press</b> <b>organ,</b> also known as Ileana, was edited by Bacalbașa and illustrated by Luchian. Described by Vianu as a [...] "refined art magazine", it is also considered the first one {{of its kind in}} Romania.|$|E

2500|$|Relgis' {{participation}} in left-wing causes was attacked {{at home by}} the antisemitic and proto-fascist National Christian Defense League, whose <b>press</b> <b>organ</b> Înfrățirea Românească alleged that [...] "squire Siegler" [...] and his Umanitarismul, together with the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, were fostering communist agitation. After the 1933 establishment of a Nazi regime in Germany, Relgis' books of interviews became subject to ceremonial burnings.|$|E
2500|$|The {{journalist}} {{then returned}} to political life, a committed anticommunist. As Brătescu writes, he rejected socialism after the October Revolution, and supported the National Liberal Party without joining its ranks. Before the electoral year 1920, Streitman joined the politically diverse People's Party (PP), where he worked alongside the Romanian nationalist poet, Octavian Goga. The Jewish journalist sent articles to the PP's own <b>press</b> <b>organ,</b> Îndreptarea. He was an enthusiastic follower of the party leader, General Alexandru Averescu. In retrospect, he spoke of Averescu as an [...] "imperturbable and incorruptible" [...] figures, chosen by providence to enact a program of [...] "prosperity and order".|$|E
2500|$|Shortly {{before the}} {{election}} of December 1928, Ralea was attracted into the National Peasants' Party (PNȚ), speaking out against the National Liberal political class as [...] "an abnormal regime of corruption and brutality." [...] He successfully contested {{a seat in the}} Assembly of Deputies. He was one of a compact group of National Peasantist academics in Poporanist Iași, together with Botez, Oțetea, Constantin Balmuș, Iorgu Iordan, Petre Andrei, Traian Bratu, and Traian Ionașcu. Inside the party, Ralea was a follower of the Poporanist founding figure, Constantin Stere, but did not follow Stere's [...] "Democratic Peasantist" [...] dissidence of 1930. Around 1929, Ralea was a noted contributor to the party <b>press</b> <b>organ</b> Acțiunea Țărănistă and to Teodorescu-Braniște's Revista Politică. In January 1933, Ibrăileanu retired, leaving Ralea and literary critic George Călinescu as editors of Viața Românească.|$|E

5000|$|Both PCP-Bandera Roja and PCP-Unidad {{are named}} after their {{traditional}} <b>press</b> <b>organs.</b> The name [...] "PCP-Unidad" [...] is an informal designation; the official {{name of the}} PCP-Unidad is simply [...] "Partido Comunista Peruano". There was a faction called PCP-Mayoría around 1980: its members considered that PCP-Unidad had taken a Eurocommunist turn, while they themselves preferred a more hard-line Soviet stance.|$|R
2500|$|The USR's public {{expression}} of regret over having tolerated [...] "a text with antisemitic content" [...] caused Goma to threaten with a lawsuit on libel grounds. In reaction, Gârbea stated: [...] "What {{we are interested}} in is Viaţa Românească, a <b>press</b> <b>organ</b> edited by the USR. Paul Goma may believe whatever he likes. It is not him that we are discussing, but the magazine. I see no reason why he would sue me personally." [...] According to an overview of the episode by journalist Ovidiu Şimonca, Horia Gârbea had unwittingly prompted Goma to state his intention of suing the Jewish-Romanian community league, or Federation of Jewish Communities of Romania (FCER). This was because, during the scandal, Gârbea had explained that the FCER's reaction was an incentive in the USR's internal investigation. Goma's claim for reparations from FCER leaders, Şimonca noted, ignored the fact that Gârbea had not disclosed any names.|$|E
2500|$|Mille and Săulescu hatched up an {{intricate}} practical joke, designed to ridicule the Conservative Party and its <b>press</b> <b>organ,</b> Timpul: from early in 1882 and until September, {{using the name}} Gh Copăcineanu, they sent letters to the editors, which presented imaginary, shock-value, accounts of student activities in the French capital, part of which specifically referred to Mille himself (among other things, they pretended that Mille had become a restaurateur, and that Copăcineanu had been assailed by socialists armed with knives while crossing the Seine on the Austerlitz Bridge). The correspondence was published in its entirety by the Romanian newspaper, which led Mille to declare that [...] "any inanity can fit in the journal's columns". Ultimately, Mille revealed that {{he was responsible for}} the whole affair (a notice published by Telegraful); although Timpul did not reply, Mihai Eminescu, the influential poet who worked in the journal's mail room and reviewed all letters, later confessed to Zamfir Arbore that he had [...] "given approval for print without reading them".|$|E

50|$|Those years {{witnessed}} an escalation of political violence, {{correlated with the}} rise of antisemitism. The Bucharest Journalists' Circle broke down after political and ethnic conflicts. Following the conflict between the Iron Guard and the National Christian regime, all the radically fascist <b>press</b> <b>organs</b> were shut down. After the imposition of censorship, Karnabatt was still present at Curentul, where he wrote on Christian subjects, and published an homage to the Franciscan poet Ion Gârleanu.|$|R

50|$|After the split, the {{relations}} between DSAP-Linke and the mother-party DSAP (or DSAP-Rechts, i.e. 'DSAP-Right', as DSAP-Linke branded the party) were antagonistic. DSAP-Linke characterized DSAP and the Polish Socialist Party (PPS) as 'social fascists', arguing that the leaderships of those two parties were laying the foundations for fascism in Poland. The DSAP <b>press</b> <b>organs,</b> on their behalf, began using the spelling 'Szajbel' for Scheibler's name, thus insinuating that he was Jewish (Scheibler wasn't of Jewish origin, but had married a Jewish woman).|$|R
