50|$|As {{couplings}} wear {{they create}} wear particles. In some {{applications such as}} clean rooms or food handling this dust could be a contamination problem so in these applications the coupling should be enclosed to prevent the particles from contaminating other surfaces around it. But a more likely scenario is that the coupling {{has a better chance}} of getting contaminated from its environment. Obviously oil or grease should be kept away from the contact surface because they would significantly reduce the coefficient of friction which could drastically decrease the torque potentially causing failure. Oil mist or lubricated particles can also cause surface contamination. Sometimes <b>paper</b> <b>dust</b> or other contamination can fall in between the contact surfaces. This can also result in a loss of torque. If a known source of contamination is going to be present many clutch manufactures offer contamination shields that prevent material from falling in between the contact surfaces.|$|E

40|$|AbstractDust explosions have {{accounted}} for numerous deaths, disappearance of companies, and large financial losses, and yet {{they are one of}} the least recognized of industrial fire hazards. They can occur within any process where a combustible dust is handled, produced or stored, and can be triggered by any energy source, including static sparks, friction and incandescent material. The management of dust explosion risk includes the implementation of both preventive and protective measures. Whereas preventive measures may reduce explosion risks efficiently, they rarely are sufficient to eliminate explosions completely. Therefore, explosion protection measures often need to be considered as well. This <b>paper</b> presents <b>dust</b> explosion protection methods, including venting, flameless venting, suppression, and isolation, and describes their application limits...|$|R
5000|$|Besides {{the usual}} {{malfunctions}} common to laser printers with worn rollers or accumulated <b>paper</b> <b>dust,</b> older IIISi and 4Si printers eventually exhibit a [...] "phantom paper jam." [...] On longer documents, the printer will stop and report a paper jam, {{but with no}} visible reason why the paper wasn't feeding correctly. There {{are a couple of}} solenoids at the paper tray input mechanism that have felt pads designed to cushion them when they snap on, and the glue holding these pads in place can migrate to the surface. This delays the release of the solenoid, which causes the paper to start feeding slightly late. The error accumulates with each page printed, and eventually the paper is entering the mechanism so late that the printer believes that a jam has occurred. The tell-tale symptom is a print job with a top margin that shrinks from page to page. This problem is fixed by removing the felt pads, cleaning off the adhesive (isopropyl alcohol works well), and placing some electrical tape or other material to provide a cushion for the solenoid. Unfortunately, accessing the solenoids requires disassembling most of the input mechanism.|$|E
50|$|The printer {{contains}} melted wax when at operating temperature, and owners' manuals {{warn that}} it cannot be moved {{until it has}} completed a special cool-down cycle selected from the machine's control panel. It is recommended to provide a 30-minute cool down time {{from the point of}} removing main power, however all modern solid-ink printers have a shutdown cycle which use fans to solidify the ink in less than ten minutes, with the added benefit of physically restraining the printhead to prevent damage during moving or shipping. The manuals warn that substantial damage is possible otherwise, requiring servicing by a trained technician if not properly cooled down before moving the printer. Moving the printer before cool down completes can damage the print head by spilling molten ink between reservoirs of different color as well as over other components inside the printer (motors, belts, etc.), and is not covered under maintenance or warranty. Because of the liquid-ink-spillage concern, solid-ink printers are not suitable for mobile usage, such as on movable carts for printing pricing tags in retail settings. Unlike some inkjet printers where the cartridge includes the print head, the printhead in these printers is fixed. Over time, parts of the printhead may become permanently clogged, resulting in unsightly streaks, but there are printhead and drum cleaning cycles and jet-substitution options which can resolve most printing issues. There is a filter for the ingested ink implemented at least on the recent ColorQube devices (8570/8870), according to a service manual for those models. Dust caused by the use of cheap paper may cause printhead clogging, which is why Xerox recommends the use of papers that are not prone to giving off dust and fibers during regular usage. <b>Paper</b> <b>dust</b> may also accumulate as debris inside the printer; this could cause abrasions on the drum and may mimic a weak or missing jet. For this reason, the basic built-in drum-cleaning procedure is therefore recommended to be invoked at least three times before initiating printhead-nozzle cleaning cycle. The printhead system also contains a wiper-assembly unit that is used to wipe the printhead from dust, debris and residual ink, {{in order to protect the}} nozzles from clogging. Overall, the design of this system is robust: printheads have been known to last one million prints or more. Ink blocks are not compatible between Phaser models, due to Xerox changing each CMYK molded shape with each new model release due to changes in the formulation (and especially melt point) of the ink. Special openings prevent the insertion of ink sticks from the wrong model, or the wrong slot. Lamination becomes difficult due to the nature of the ink technology. The ink melts and becomes smeared unless the laminator temperature is reduced to just enough to seal a pouch.|$|E
50|$|From 1937 to 2003, Warne {{published}} small, pocket sized books, {{which were}} available on many subjects. The aim {{of these books}} were to interest the observer. They were called the Observer's books. These books were very popular amongst children. Over {{the past few years}} they have become very popular collector items. For the dedicated collector this could be a lifetime's work as there are over 800 variations, some of which are now very rare. The values of the books can vary from 50p to hundreds of pounds. They all include a variety of topics, which include hobbies, art, history, wildlife and many more. The earlier books were printed with <b>paper</b> <b>dust</b> covers up until 1969. These were good for printing but where not very practical because they were very delicate and were easy to rip and stain. From 1970, the covers were protected with a glossy coating. This helped the dust covers protection. These types are often referred to as Glossies. From the late 1970s, Warne decided to laminate the covers to the actual books, so the books were highly protected as they didn't really have any covers. The dust covers from 1937 to 1970 had designs that were colourful and attractive as each one had its own unique colouring of squiggly lines at the top. In 1971, Warne decided to refurbish its books with a more formal dust jacket. These were good but it lost the charm that the original covers had had. I have some pictures below of old and new dust jackets in Observer's books. The first Observer guide was published in 1937, and was on the subject of British Birds. This is now very rare,and a mint copy with a dust cover is worth hundreds of pounds. The same year, Warne published a second book, on British Wild Flowers, a mint copy of this book is worth around £220.By 1941, Warne had published the first six Observer's books. In 1942, a special edition book was bought out on Airplanes. This book had no number in the series, as it was bought out to help people spot enemy planes during World War 2.It was printed again in 1943, and in 1945. When Warne was acquired by Penguin books in 1983, Warne bought out new editions of the Observer's books. These were slightly bigger than the Observer's books, and were in paperback, not hardback. The same year penguin, with permission of Warne, started printing their own, more up to date Observer's books. These again were slightly larger than the originals, but were hardbacks. Like the later original Observer's books, The dust cover were laminated to the actual book. There were two types of the penguin Observer's books, Bloomsbury Observer's, and Claremont Observer's, (of which there were only 12 different editions).Below I have included {{a list of all the}} original Observer's books with the dates of there first editions, and two pictures of Observer's books.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The primary aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} if exposure to dust from absorbent hygiene products containing superabsorbent polymer is related to symptoms from the airways and from the eyes. The secondary aim was to estimate the current exposure to superabsorbent polymer among production and maintenance workers in a plant producing hygiene products. Methods The cohort comprised 1043 workers of whom 689 were exposed to super absorbent polymer and 804 were exposed to <b>paper</b> <b>dust</b> (overlapping groups). There was 186 workers not exposed to either superabsorbent polymer or to <b>paper</b> <b>dust</b> They were investigated with a comprehensive questionnaire about exposure, asthma, rhinitis and symptoms from eyes and airways. The results were analyzed with logistic regression models adjusting for sex, age, atopy and smoking habits. An aerosol sampler equipped with a polytetrafluoroethylene filter with 1 μm pore size was used for personal samplings in order to measure inhalable dust and superabsorbent polymer. Results The prevalence of nasal crusts (OR 1. 4, 95 % CI 1. 01 - 2. 0) and nose-bleeding (OR 1. 7, 95 % CI 1. 2 - 2. 4) was increased among the <b>paper</b> <b>dust</b> exposed workers (adjusted for superabsorbent polymer exposure). There were no significant effects associated with exposure to superabsorbent polymer (adjusted for <b>paper</b> <b>dust</b> exposure). The average exposure to inhalable levels of total dust (<b>paper</b> <b>dust)</b> varied between 0. 40 and 1. 37 mg/m 3. For superabsorbent polymer dust the average exposure varied between 0. 02 and 0. 81 mg/m 3. Conclusions In conclusion, our study shows that workers manufacturing diapers in the hygiene industry have an increased prevalence of symptoms from the nose, especially nose-bleeding. There was no relation between exposure to superabsorbent polymer and symptoms from eyes, nose or respiratory tract, but exposure to <b>paper</b> <b>dust</b> was associated with nose-bleeding and nasal crusts.
