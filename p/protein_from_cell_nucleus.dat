40|$|The estrangement between genetic {{scientists}} and theologians {{originating in the}} 1960 s is reflected in novel combinations of human thought (subject) and genes (investigational object), paralleling {{each other through the}} universal process known in chaos theory as self-similarity. The clash and recombination of genes and knowledge captures what Philip Hefner refers to as irony, one of four voices he suggests transmit the knowledge and arguments of the religion-and-science debate. When viewed along a tangent connecting irony to leadership, journal dissemination, and the activities of the “public intellectual” and the public at large, the sequence of voices is shown to resemble the passage of genetic information from DNA to mRNA, tRNA, and <b>protein,</b> and <b>from</b> <b>cell</b> <b>nucleus</b> to surrounding environment.

40|$|Chromatin is {{the complex}} of DNA, histones and non-histone {{proteins}} {{that make up}} chromosomes and the region of dispersed chromosomes during the interphases and S phase of the cell cycle. It is found inside <b>cell</b> <b>nuclei</b> in eukaryotic <b>cells.</b> There are many important proteins in the nuclei which are involved in DNA replication, gene expression, DNA repair, etc. Core histones, linker histones and HMGs {{are the most important}} proteins in this group. In this thesis, a new, quick and efficient method is developed, to extract and purify <b>proteins</b> <b>from</b> <b>cell</b> <b>nuclei,</b> which is named "forward technology". By using the "forward technology", ultra-pure native core histone octamers, dimers and tetramers were extracted from chick erythrocytes. By using the pure histone dimers and tetramers, the complexes of NAP 1 -dimer and NAP 1 -tetramer were obtained in collaboration with others. Crystals of pure histone octamers with a higher resolution than before were produced (Chapter 2). A low KCI/phosphate wash of chick erythrocyte nuclei removed up to 1 g of proteins without nuclei lysis (cePNE 1 proteins). The high KCI/phosphate soluble fraction of the cePNE 1 is rich in HMG proteins, peptidyl-prolyl isomerases (FKBP 3) and heatshock protein 70 which were fractionated by cation-exchange chromatography and anion-exchange chromatography (Chapter 3). Valuable (in terms of function) high-molecular-weight proteins were enriched, and another group of nucleoproteins called cePNE 5 is fractionated by the "forward technology" from chick erythrocyte nuclei. It was confirmed that HMGB proteins prefer to bind to core histone H 2 A-H 2 B dimers (Chapter 4). It has proved possible to fractionate HMG-rich PNE 1 <b>proteins</b> separate <b>from</b> a linker- histone rich nucleoprotein extract, separate from pure core histones (not as oetamers) from human tissue culture cells. The method has been applied to human leukocytes obtained from the National Blood Service. This enrichment of particular groups of proteins will be useful for proteomic studies (Chapter 5) ...|$|R

It was of interest, therefore, to determine whether Yb subunits isolated from rat liver nuclei would return to nuclear fractions upon reintroduction to cell cytoplasms via red-blood-cell-mediated fusion. Labelled Yb subunits were associated with nuclear fractions 60 min after cell fusion. The microinjected protein remained associated with the nuclei for 18 h and was not extractable with low-salt washes. In addition, injected Yb subunits were found to equally distribute between extractable (56 %) and residual (44 %) nuclear fractions. These experiments demonstrate that glutathione S-transferase Yb subunits isolated from nuclei rapidly translocate to nuclei upon reintroduction into cell cytoplasms...|$|R

The SV 40 P element competed {{for one of these}} proteins which bound to the region from - 198 to - 230. This factor may be related to AP- 1.

40|$|The {{protooncogene}} c-fos {{produces a}} phosphoprotein, Fos, which regulates gene transcription processes. In neuronal systems, Fos {{has been proposed}} to couple synaptic transmission to changes in gene expression by acting in the <b>cell</b> <b>nucleus</b> in concert with other proteins to form complexes in the promoter regions of target genes. We report here that the acute administration of a single dose of the indirect-acting dopaminergic agonist cocaine increases multiple Fos proteins in rat caudate nucleus. The increase is dose-dependent and is apparent immunocytochemically at 1 hr, maximal at 2 hr, and absent 48 hr after treatment. The increase seen immunocytochemically is composed of several molecular weight species as assessed by Western blotting of <b>proteins</b> <b>from</b> isolated striatal <b>cell</b> <b>nuclei.</b> Administration of the specific dopaminergic receptor antagonists sulpiride and SCH- 23390 prior to cocaine support a significant role for D 1 but not for D 2 receptors in mediating this effect.

40|$|The {{organization}} of the nuclear skeleton (or nuclear matrix) and DNA domains attached to it remains a subject for heated iscussion (Hancock 1982; Georgiev et al. 1991; Laemmli et al. 1992). In the Results section below, we describe an approach for isolation of full-length DNA domains or oligodomains and present evidence for the identity of nuclear matrix attachment sites detected in vitro in inactive cells with those ob-served in in vivo experiments. In the Discussion, we describe further experimental approaches under de-velopment at the Institute of Gene Biology to analyze the role of DNA domains in major genetic processes. It {{has been known for}} some time that the extraction of DNA <b>proteins</b> <b>from</b> the <b>cell</b> <b>nucleus</b> does not remove all nuclear material. The first electron microscopic analysis of nuclei extensively treated with DNase I and successively extracted with 0. 14 M and 2 M NaCI sug-gested the existence in nuclei of some skeletal protein fibrils to which DNA was attached (Georgiev and Chentsov 1960). The fibrils were originally called "nu-cleonems, " but now the terms "nuclear matrix " or "chromosomal scaffold " are commonly used (Berezney and Coffey 1976; Paulson and Laemmli 1977). Later, it was demonstrated that the removal of histones caused tightly packed chromosomal DNA to convert into large superhelical loops or domains maintained by some residual nuclear elements (Cook et al. 1976). Such loops were clearly visualized in metaphase chromo-somes after their dehistonization (Paulson and Laem-mli 1977). The size of the DNA domains was estimated to range from 50 to 100 kb. The next important step was the analysis of the nature of sites of DNA attachment to the nuclear matrix. Several different protocols were used for their isolation. The simplest one is the low- and high-salt extraction of nuclei pretreated with DNA endonu-clease, for example, micrococcal nuclease or DNase...|$|R
40|$|Type II topoisomerases are {{essential}} for faithful cell division in all organisms. In human cells, the alpha isozyme of topoisomerase II has been implicated in catalyzing mitotic chromosome segregation via its action as a DNA unlinking enzyme. Here, we {{have shown that the}} enzymatic activity of topoisomerase II alpha <b>protein</b> purified <b>from</b> HeLa <b>cell</b> <b>nuclei</b> was strongly enhanced following phosphorylation by protein kinase C. We have investigated the possibility that this kinase is involved in cell cycle phase-specific phosphorylation of topoisomerase II alpha in HeLa cells. Two-dimensional tryptic phosphopeptide mapping revealed that topoisomerase II alpha <b>protein</b> immunoprecipitated <b>from</b> metabolically labeled HeLa cells was differentially phosphorylated during the G 2 /M phases of the cell cycle. To identify sites of phosphorylation, and the kinase(s) responsible for this modification, oligohistidine-tagged recombinant domains of topoisomerase II alpha protein were overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified by affinity chromatography. Phosphorylation of a short fragment of the N-terminal ATPase domain of topoisomerase II alpha by protein kinase C in vitro generated two phosphopeptides that co-migrated with prominent G 2 /M phase-specific phosphopeptides from the HeLa cell-derived topoisomerase II alpha protein. Site-directed mutagenesis studies indicated that phosphorylation of serine 29 generated both of these phosphopeptides. Our results implicate protein kinase C in the cell cycle phase-dependent modulation of topoisomerase II alpha enzymatic activity in human cells...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{details the}} {{progress}} made in automating the data acquisition and data processing of MS and MS/MS data from Fourier transform {{ion cyclotron resonance}} mass spectrometers. These instruments have made great strides {{in the past few}} years, moving from labor-intensive, largely manual systems to the current flagship of the Kelleher group ??? a 12 tesla hybrid LTQ FT capable of analyzing hundreds of proteins per week with minimal user intervention. In early automation work centered around an 8. 5 tesla hybrid quadrupole FT-ICR mass spectrometer, three strategies for automated operation of the instrument were developed. In one method, a charge state deconvolution algorithm was used to identify species of interest for isolation using a SWIFT waveform, which were then fragmented in the ICR cell using IRMPD. In another method, broad 20 - 60 m/z wide sections of the mass spectrum of a complex mixture were fragmented in parallel and this multiplexed fragment data was analyzed using an iterative algorithm. In the third method, samples were analyzed using a THRASH-based "quad march" method where data were acquired using consecutive, wide (20 - 60 m/z) isolation windows, analyzed using the THRASH algorithm, and then selected species were selected for MS/MS fragmentation. Results from the application of this platform to a survey of the Methanosarcina acetivorans proteome are presented. Later work focused on a commercial 12 tesla hybrid linear ion trap FT-ICR mass spectrometer. This automation scheme used hybrid online/offline data acquisition to take advantages of the features of both online LC-MS (efficient separation and rapid data collection) and offline direct infusion MS/MS (project-wide target selection, better MS/MS data). The workflow for the online portion of this scheme is a modified form of the THRASH-based "quad march" data acquisition scheme from the earlier 8. 5 T automation work. The centerpiece of this - iii - platform is a database known as the Automation Warehouse, which acts as a repository for the intact mass data observed in a proteome project and stores the overall state of the project. Custom software binds together the raw data, the data stored in the warehouse and ProSight. Results from the application of this platform to a survey of <b>proteins</b> <b>from</b> HeLa <b>cell</b> <b>nuclei</b> are presented. In an attempt to begin applying the above platforms to membrane proteins, MS analysis of a putative cross-link in the active site of the C-type heme-copper oxygen reductase from Vibrio cholera was performed. Though the sequences in the region differed, other members of the HCO superfamily contained a similar cross-link (confirmed by mass spectrometry and crystal structures) that is important in the catalytic cycle of the enzyme. Computer modeling of the C-type oxidase suggested that the cross-link would be present, though the key amino acid would be located on a different helix. MS/MS analysis of a tryptic digest confirmed the presence of the cross-link and the evolutionary migration of the key amino acid...|$|R

40|$|Aldosterone and {{corticosterone}} bind to mineralocorticoid (MR) and glucocorticoid receptors (GR), which, upon ligand binding, {{are thought}} to translocate to the <b>cell</b> <b>nucleus</b> to act as transcription factors. Mineralocorticoid selectivity is achieved by the 11 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11 β-HSD 2) that inactivates 11 β-hydroxy glucocorticoids. High expression levels of 11 β-HSD 2 characterize the aldosterone-sensitive distal nephron (ASDN), which comprises the segment-specific cells of late distal convoluted tubule (DCT 2), connecting tubule (CNT), and collecting duct (CD). We used MR- and GR-specific antibodies to study localization and regulation of MR and GR in kidneys of rats with altered plasma aldosterone and corticosterone levels. In control rats, MR and GR were found in <b>cell</b> <b>nuclei</b> of thick ascending limb (TAL), DCT, CNT, CD cells, and intercalated cells (IC). GR was also abundant in <b>cell</b> <b>nuclei</b> and the subapical compartment of proximal tubule (PT) cells. Dietary NaCl loading, which lowers plasma aldosterone, caused a selective removal of GR <b>from</b> <b>cell</b> <b>nuclei</b> of 11 β-HSD 2 -positive ASDN. The nuclear localization of MR was unaffected. Adrenalectomy (ADX) resulted in removal of MR and GR <b>from</b> the <b>cell</b> <b>nuclei</b> of all epithelial cells. Aldosterone replacement rapidly relocated the receptors in the <b>cell</b> <b>nuclei.</b> In ASDN <b>cells,</b> low-dose corticosterone replacement caused nuclear localization of MR, but not of GR. The GR was redistributed to the nucleus only in PT, TAL, early DCT, and IC that express no or very little 11 β-HSD 2. In ASDN cells, nuclear GR localization was only achieved when corticosterone was replaced at high doses. Thus ligand-induced nuclear translocation of MR and GR are part of MR and GR regulation in the kidney and show remarkable segment- and cell type-specific characteristics. Differential regulation of MR and GR may alter the level of heterodimerization of the receptors and hence {{may contribute to the}} complexity of corticosteroid effects on ASDN function...|$|R
