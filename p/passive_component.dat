40|$|Integral passive is an {{emerging}} technology {{which is currently}} perceived as a possible alternative to the discrete passive technology in fulfilling the next generation packaging needs. Although discrete surface mount <b>passive</b> <b>components</b> (resistors, capacitors, and inductors) have been well characterized, the development of integral <b>passive</b> <b>components</b> suitable for co-integration on the board level is relatively recent. Since in some applications the number of <b>passive</b> <b>components</b> can exceed the number and the area oftC chips on a circuit board or in a package, such integration of <b>passive</b> <b>components</b> {{would be necessary to}} substantially eliminate part count and reduce device area. To address these issues, integration technology for passive elements {{in the same manner as}} for transistors is necessary. In addition, the fabrication sequence of all integral <b>passive</b> <b>components</b> should be mutually compatible for co-integration on the same substrate. In this paper, materials and fabrication issues for passive elements such as resistors (R), capacitors (C), and inductors (l) and the feasibility of integration of these fabricated <b>passive</b> <b>components</b> on glass substrates have been addressed. An active filter circuit has been selected for a case study for R, L, and C co-integration. This passive module contains eleven resistors, four capacitors, and four inductors, an...|$|R

50|$|Passivity is a {{property}} of engineering systems, {{used in a}} variety of engineering disciplines, but most commonly found in analog electronics and control systems.

50|$|In {{control systems}} and circuit network theory, a <b>passive</b> <b>component</b> or circuit {{is one that}} consumes energy, but does not produce energy.

50|$|A {{component}} {{that is not}} passive is called an active component. An electronic circuit consisting entirely of passive components is called a passive circuit (and has the same properties as a <b>passive</b> <b>component).</b> Used out-of-context and without a qualifier, the term passive is ambiguous. Typically, analog designers use this term to refer to incrementally passive components and systems, while control systems engineers will use this to refer to thermodynamically passive ones.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—With the {{increasing}} number of voltage conversions that have to be efficiently implemented in a mobile device, the PCB space occupied by switched-mode DC-DC converters with external <b>passive</b> <b>components</b> will become unacceptably high. Therefore, a clear need exists for small-form-factor high-efficiency DC-DC converters having the necessary <b>passive</b> <b>components</b> integrated within one package. This will enable the integration of a DC-DC converter with the load and consequently the system integration of power management. This paper describes the measurement results of an integrated inductive down converter, where the active electronics (power stage and driver circuitry) has been implemented in 0. 18 -μm CMOS technology and the <b>passive</b> <b>components</b> (output LC filter and decoupling capacitor) have been implemented in a state...|$|R

50|$|An optical {{isolator}} is a two-port <b>passive</b> <b>component</b> that allows light (in a given wavelength range) {{to pass through}} with low attenuation in one direction, while isolating (providing a high attenuation for) light propagating in the reverse direction. Isolators are used as both integral and in-line components in laser diode modules and optical amplifiers, and to reduce noise caused by multi-path reflection in high-bitrate and analog transmission systems.|$|E

5000|$|In a load or <b>passive</b> <b>component,</b> {{such as a}} light bulb, resistor, or {{electric}} motor, electric current (flow of positive charges) moves through the device {{under the influence of}} the electric field E in the direction of lower electric potential, from the positive terminal to the negative. So work is done by the charges on the component; potential energy flows out of the charges; and electric power flows from the circuit into the component, where it is converted to some other form of energy such as heat or mechanical work.|$|E
30|$|The ever {{increasing}} functionality, portability, and switching frequencies of consumer electronics, which cause parasitic inductance effects such as electromagnetic interference (EMI) and simultaneous switching noise (SSN) [1, 2], are putting tremendous pressure on designers and manufacturers to pack more circuitry into a smaller {{space at the}} same time as suppressing SSN and EMI. Because of these demands, the three-dimensional integration of <b>passive</b> <b>components</b> should be realized instead of relying on existing surface-mounted <b>passive</b> <b>components,</b> i.e., two-dimensional integration, owing to the occupation of space by the passives over the entire printed circuit board area [3]. Among the <b>passive</b> <b>components</b> requiring three-dimensional integration, the development of an embedded decoupling capacitor is particularly important for miniaturization and the suppression of EMI and SSN [4, 5].|$|R
