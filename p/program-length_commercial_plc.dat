5000|$|<b>Program-length</b> <b>{{commercials}}</b> {{consist of}} commercials that advertise a product {{associated with the}} program being aired. This also includes programs in which a product or service is being advertised within the program. The commercial is not separated from the program, therefore making it a <b>program-length</b> <b>commercial.</b> This has been prohibited due to the FCC's determination that many children {{are not able to}} distinguish between the programming and the commercial, which could lead to them thinking the entire program is one big commercial (see Infomercial) - or vice versa. As FCC Commissioner Michael J. Copps stated, “Although the kids with their remotes in hand won’t know it, that single click of the button will transport them beyond the regulated world of television, with its restrictions on commercial messages aimed at children, to an Internet bazaar bereft of any rules. Shouldn’t we get a handle on this before really harmful consequences are felt?” A related serious concern is that the impressionability of children can lead to [...] "nag factor" [...] situations; i.e. those brought on by advertisements whose effects are amplified when children are involved. [...] These presumably negative effects can be reduced when the FCC implements measures restricting <b>program-length</b> <b>commercials</b> aimed at children.|$|R

Some advertisers (such as Nabisco, McDonald's and Crayola) also pulled out of sponsoring the program, either due to pressure from special interest groups, or because a preview tape of the show was not available in time for review.

40|$|The CEBAF energy upgrade will {{increase}} the maximum beam energy from 6 GeV to 12 GeV available to the experimental halls. RF deflection cavities (separators) are used to direct the electron beam to the three halls. The resulting increase in RF separator cavity gradient and subsequent increase in RF power needed for these higher energies will require the cavities to have active resonance control. Currently, at the present 4 to 6 GeV energies, the cavities are tuned mechanically and then stabilized with Low Conductivity Water (LCW) which is maintained at a constant temperature of 95 o Fahrenheit. This approach is no longer feasible and an active resonance control system that controls both water temperature and flow has been designed and built. The system uses a <b>commercial</b> <b>PLC</b> with embedded PID controls to regulate water temperature and flow to the cavities.

40|$|Abstract—The {{regulation}} {{on power}} line communication (PLC) has been eased in Japan, and the frequency band between 2 and 30 MHz {{can be used for}} in-home PLC. Several different types of <b>commercial</b> <b>PLC</b> equipment are available in the market. Almost all of them include PLC adapters that interconvert Ethernet signals and power line signals. An in-home network can easily be constructed by using these PLC adapters because there are many power outlets in every room. However, there are various factors that tend to destabilize the communication among PLC adapters. These factors involve time-varying channel response and noise characteristics, which are both synchronized with the power frequency. In particular, it has been observed that the noise in a power line varies more significantly than the channel response. Therefore, many PLC adapters contain certain features to mitigate the time-varying noise inapower line. We show anumber of examples of more significant variations in the channel response synchronized with the power frequency due to the switching regulators used. This paper deals with such a time-varying channel response synchronized with the power frequency. We show that the performance of the PLC adapters suffers due the time-varying channel response and analyze its influences on the PLC adapters.

We analyze the performance of the PLC in terms of 3 parameters: S-parameters (transfer function), SNR and currents circulating on the aircraft circuit that must comply with the aeronautical electromagnetic regulations. The study also includes a real case scenario with the presence of a switch-mode power supply, which introduces distortion on the network and deteriorates the PLC performance.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to identify the extent of commercial and farm vehicle theft in Australia and to explore the theft profile of these vehicles in urban and rural areas. The research was conducted using data from the National Comprehensive Auto-theft Research System (CARS) database. The database holds police data on all motor vehicle thefts and vehicle registration data from all Australian states and territories. While passenger vehicle and light <b>commercial</b> vehicle (<b>PLC)</b> theft in Australia has decreased significantly since 2001, theft of commercial and farm vehicles has remained constant. Nonetheless, theft of commercial and farm vehicles in rural areas has {{a significant impact on the}} owners in terms of loss of income and means of transport. In the 2006 / 07 financial year, the estimated value of commercial and farm vehicle theft in Australia was $ 164. 2 million. Utilities and motorcycles were the most popular theft targets and accounted for $ 43 million in unrecovered vehicles. Motor vehicle theft is a significant and challenging problem. While Australian and international statistics on the incidence of motor vehicle theft are available (CARS 2007; FBI 2006; UK Home Office 2007), there is limited research into farm vehicle crime. Crime has been a part of Australian farm life since colonial times (Barclay 2001), however the complexity in preventing or reducing it lies in the numerous forms that exist including theft of livestock, horticulture, equipment, vehicles and fuel among various others. Research conducted by the Australian Institute of Criminology (AIC) indicates that farmers experience crime rates up to double that of the general population (17 % compared with 9 %; Anderson and McCall 2005), and that farmers are particularly prone to repeat victimization (McCall and Homel 2003).

This master's thesis is a continuation, by the same three students, of the work of a student project during the fall of 2008. In this report we present in detail the findings, challenges, choices and and solutions involved in the working process. During the course of this project, we have successfully adapted the Linux kernel, and a toolchain for generating binaries loadable by Linux. A set of test applications have been compiled and tested on the resulting platform. This project has resulted in the submission of a revised patch series for the U-Boot boot loader, one patch series for Linux, and one for the toolchain. Requirements have been created, and tests for the requirements have been carried out. </p...|$|R
40|$|Trustworthy {{operation}} of industrial control systems depends on secure and real-time code execution on the embedded {{programmable logic controllers}} (PLCs). The controllers monitor and control the critical infrastructures, such as electric power grids and healthcare platforms, and continuously report back the system status to human operators. We present Zeus, a contactless embedded controller security monitor to ensure its execution control flow integrity. Zeus leverages the electromagnetic emission by the PLC circuitry during {{the execution of the}} controller programs. Zeus's contactless execution tracking enables non-intrusive monitoring of security-critical controllers with tight real-time constraints. Those devices often cannot tolerate the cost and performance overhead that comes with additional traditional hardware or software monitoring modules. Furthermore, Zeus provides an air-gap between the monitor (trusted computing base) and the target (potentially compromised) PLC. This eliminates the possibility of the monitor infection by the same attack vectors. Zeus monitors for control flow integrity of the PLC program execution. Zeus monitors the communications between the human-machine interface and the PLC, and captures the control logic binary uploads to the PLC. Zeus exercises its feasible execution paths, and fingerprints their emissions using an external electromagnetic sensor. Zeus trains a neural network for legitimate PLC executions, and uses it at runtime to identify the control flow based on PLC's electromagnetic emissions. We implemented Zeus on a <b>commercial</b> Allen Bradley <b>PLC,</b> which is widely used in industry, and evaluated it on real-world control program executions. Zeus was able to distinguish between different legitimate and malicious executions with 98. 9 % accuracy and with zero overhead on PLC execution by design...|$|R
