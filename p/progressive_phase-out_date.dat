50|$|The <b>progressive</b> <b>phase-out</b> of the B-47 and KC-97 {{from the}} USAF {{inventory}} {{in the mid-1960s}} brought the end of SAC's Reflex operations and to the 7th Air Division in Europe. The advent of reliable multiple warhead Intercontinental ballistic missiles based in the United States and intercontinental B-52 bombers with inflight refueling capability made many of SAC's UK bases redundant. By 1966 SAC had transferred some of its UK bases to USAFE and reduced its operations to a reconnaissance and aerial refueling Detachment at RAF Upper Heyford. Some of these bases, (Upper Heyford) were used to accommodate the 66th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing in 1965, (RAF Mildenall) at the 513th Troop Carrier Wing in 1966, being relocated from France, while others were returned to RAF control or put into standby status (Chevelston, Fairford, Greenham Common).|$|R

The sale of the most inefficient bulbs was phased out. The first types to go were non-clear (frosted) bulbs, which were taken off the market in September 2009.

50|$|The {{concept of}} {{prevention}} {{is based on}} four pillars. Firstly, the aim is the reduction of hazardous substances in vehicles to minimize their release to the environment. Secondly, vehicles should be designed to facilitate proper dismantling and to allow components and materials to be reused, recycled and/or recovered. Thirdly, the producers (both vehicle and component) shall increase the demand for recycled material. Finally, certain materials (lead, mercury, cadmium, hexavalent chromium) are forbidden {{except for a few}} applications with defined <b>phase-out</b> <b>dates.</b> These exemptions are cataloged in the Annex II to the ELV Directive.Since technology is subject to constant change, the Annex II is revised on a regular basis to account for new technical developments making certain materials in specific applications no longer necessary or allow for reduction of thresholds. As of today, 5 revisions have already been conducted with revision 6 under preparation.|$|R

First, ten promising {{aspects of the}} Convention are high-lighted. Promises include, among others: committing Parties to phase-out mercury mining; establishing a <b>phase-out</b> <b>date</b> of 2020 for many mercury-added products;encouraging the phase-down of mercury uses and releases in dentistry; prohibiting and restricting the use of mercury in listed manufacturing processes; and requiring Parties to control atmospheric emissions from listed point sources, such as coalfired power plants and waste incineration facilities. Second, seven implementation challenges are discussed. Among the challenges are: reaching rigorous ratification of the Convention; ensuring timely phase-outs; achieving actual reductions in mercury emissions and releases; ensuring adequate financing; and sorting out relationships with other conventions and international mercury-related initiatives. 加拿大社会科学和人文研究委员会给予“北极海洋治理跟踪与展望”项目的科研支...|$|R
40|$|Cahier de Recherche du Groupe HEC n° 958 / 2012 Motivated by many {{applications}} such as typical blockbuster product launches, we address in this paper, an inventory/production rollover process between an old and a new product, with a random availability/admissibility date for the new product. The optimization problem consists in finding the phase-in and <b>phase-out</b> <b>dates</b> which minimize a cost minimization objective function. We capture, via a CVar formulation, the risk phenomenon in the rollover decision making. Then, we provide explicit closed-form expressions for the optimal policies, which can be of three types: Planned Stock-out Rollover, Single-Product Rollover, and Dual-Product Rollover. The analysis led to several managerial insights which are provided in the paper. For instance, we exhibit, first, the impact of risk-aversion on the optimal strategy structure. Then, we show that increasing randomness of the availability date (in the stochastic dominance sense) reinforces {{the structure of the}} optimal strategy. We show that the stock-out period is increased in case of optimal Planned Stock-out Rollover and the overlap period is increased for optimal Dual-Product Rollover...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explains}} why states {{should have a}} decarbonisation strategy and explores some key policy elements. Abstract Across the world, governments at all levels are implementing policies to reduce carbon emissions, address local air pollution, improve energy productivity, grow new industries and address energy security concerns. While these initiatives are as yet insufficient to avoid dangerous climate change or achieve the internationally agreed goal of avoiding 2 °C warming above pre-industrial levels, the trend is clear. What is also clear is the ultimate destination or strategic objective that these policies need to have: the <b>progressive</b> <b>phase-out</b> of emissions to reach net zero levels, or ‘decarbonisation’. The OECD, World Bank and latest IPCC report have warned that avoiding irreversible and severe climate change impacts will require the global economy to be decarbonised {{before the end of}} the century. This requires energy systems, particularly electricity, to decarbonise well before then. Private sector actors are also moving forward. Leading multinational business groups and corporate leaders have called for action to achieve net zero global emissions by 2050. The financial sector is increasingly aware of the risks of ‘stranded assets’ resulting from both global decarbonisation efforts and the physical impacts of climate change. In Australia recent political and policy turmoil saw state governments retreat from many past climate policy initiatives. However some governments are now reconsidering their position and the risks posed to their economies and communities should they be left behind by this global trend toward decarbonisation. This paper {{explains why}} states should have a decarbonisation strategy and explores these key policy elements: 	Setting binding emission limits on major emitting facilities 	Incorporating carbon considerations into policy and planning processes 	Using procurement and management policies to help build markets for lower emission goods and services 	Continuing to develop and link energy efficiency policy frameworks 	Providing assistance: funding, technical, regulatory, trainin...|$|R
40|$|The {{founding}} fathers purposefully designed {{a political system}} that perpetuates gridlock. Frictions in political decision-making should foster stable policies. However, in recent years, this has been turned on its head. In recent decades, Congress has passed a series of budget control acts intended to impose discipline on the budget process. These acts, by encouraging policy phase-ins, <b>phase-outs</b> and expiration <b>dates,</b> have had the unintended consequence of policy uncertainty. A growing literature is finding that policy uncertainty imposes substantial economic costs. Policy uncertainty leads individuals to misallocate resources or to incur added costs from planning for possible scenarios. Policy uncertainty, it is argued, leads investors {{to sit on the}} sidelines, rather than bet on whether or how Congress will act. In a newly released study by the Mercatus Center, we find that investors may do worse than sit on the sidelines. We argue that policy uncertainty may decrease productive business activities, like research and hiring, while increasing resources spent on unproductive investments, like lobbying government...|$|R
