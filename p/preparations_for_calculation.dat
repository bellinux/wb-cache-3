40|$|A {{bioassay}} for tyrothricin, {{based on}} a procedure used by Szybalski in bacterial resistance studies, was developed. Replacement of the tube dilution assay with this procedure represented economy in time and equipment, with a resultant increase in productivity. The procedure involved preparation of special agar plates which provided graded concentrations of tyrothricin along a horizontal axis. A culture dish was inclined, and a base layer of agar, without antibiotic, was poured to cover {{the bottom of the}} dish and allowed to harden. A second layer of agar, containing 1 ppm of tyrothricin, was poured and allowed to harden with the dish in a level position. Diffusion of the antibiotic from the top layer into the bottom layer yielded a concentration gradient. A third thin layer of agar seeded with Streptococcus faecalis was poured on the surface. After incubation, a bacterial growth front, representing the minimal effective concentration (MEC), developed. The MEC is expressed as distance (in millimeters) {{from the edge of the}} plate. Unknowns were directly related to a standard <b>preparation</b> <b>for</b> <b>calculation</b> of tyrothricin concentration...|$|R

40|$|We have {{developed}} an implicit, multi–group, time–dependent, spherical neutrino transport code based on the Feautrier variables, the tangent–ray method, and accelerated Λ iteration. The code achieves high angular resolution, is good to O(v/c), is equivalent to a Boltzmann solver (without gravitational redshifts), and solves the transport equation at all optical depths with precision. In this paper, we present our formulation of the relevant numerics and microphysics and explore protoneutron star atmospheres for snapshot post–bounce models. Our major focus is on spectra, neutrino–matter heating rates, Eddington factors, angular distributions, and phase–space occupancies. In addition, we investigate the influence on neutrino spectra and heating of final–state electron blocking, stimulated absorption, velocity terms in the transport equation, neutrino–nucleon scattering asymmetry, and weak magnetism and recoil effects. Furthermore, we compare the emergent spectra and heating rates obtained using full transport with those obtained using representative flux-limited transport formulations to gauge their accuracy and viability. Finally, we derive useful formulae for the neutrino source strength due to nucleon–nucleon bremsstrahlung and determine bremsstrahlung’s influence on the emergent νµ and ντ neutrino spectra. These studies are in <b>preparation</b> <b>for</b> new <b>calculations</b> of spherically symmetric core–collapse supernovae, protoneutron star winds, and neutrino signals...|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} a new implicit, multi-group, time-dependent, spherical neutrino transport algorithm based on the Feautrier variables, the tangent-ray method, and accelerated Λ iteration. The code achieves high angular resolution, is conceptually equivalent to a Boltzmann solver (without redshifts), and solves the transport equation exactly at all optical depths. We summarize and review the neutrino physics of stellar collapse and supernovae and our formulation of the relevant microphysics. In addition, we derive various useful expressions for neutrino source strengths, including those for nucleon-nucleon bremsstrahlung. With this code, we study character of protoneutron star atmospheres for snapshot post-bounce models, with particular emphasis on their spectra, Eddington factors and angular distributions, phase-space occupancies, and neutrino-matter heating rates. Concerning the latter, we {{explore the influence of}} final-state electron blocking, stimulated absorption, velocity terms in the transport equation, neutrino-nucleon scattering asymmetry, and weak magnetism and recoil effects. We also investigate the physical determinants of the ν_μ spectra that emerge from supernova cores and the neutrino heating rates in post-explosion protoneutron star winds. These studies are in <b>preparation</b> <b>for</b> new <b>calculations</b> of spherically symmetric core-collapse supernovae, protoneutron star winds, and neutrino signals, but are also meant to establish a high-accuracy benchmark for future studies of the neutrino atmospheres of evolving protoneutron stars...|$|R
40|$|The {{evaluation}} of landscape patterns {{is necessary to}} explain the relationships between ecological processes and spatial patterns. For decades, landscape metrics {{have been used for}} measuring and abstracting landscape patterns. Since the emergence of FRAGTATS in 1993 the measures and methods incorporated in this software are very widely used and they have become a de facto standard tool for calculating landscape metrics. There are no special metrics for forest landscapes. The selection of metrics rather depends on {{the purpose of the study}} than on the land use type. However, there are some metrics that are more used for forest habitats. Forest landscape patterns are changing fast due to natural and human disturbances. Remote sensing offers rapid method of acquiring up-to-date information over a large geographical area and is therefore widely used as a source of data needed for pattern assessment. However, in order to obtain meaningful results from landscape metrics calculation, the correct preparation of the data is essential. In this chapter we will give an overview of the various metrics used to measure forest landscapes for different purposes. The chapter will deal with five main issues from the perspective of forest landscape patterns: (1) data <b>preparation</b> <b>for</b> metrics <b>calculation</b> (vector vs raster, scale, classification etc); (2) landscape configuration and composition measured by metrics; (3) interpretation of the results; (4) possible usages of the outcomes; (5) future perspectives (3 D landscape metrics) ...|$|R
40|$|A {{construction}} project is, no doubt, a risk-inherent endeavor. Industry practitioners {{have long been}} dealing with the project risks through number of means, most notably the adding of contingency amounts to their base cost estimates {{to account for the}} unfavorable future events. This is considered a fundamental risk mitigation practice in {{construction project}}s. Whenever a construction company fails to satisfactorily estimate the contingency amount, it risks getting the project on one hand and endangers its presumptive profits on the other hand. This may even lead, in some instances, to stoppage of work and/or bankruptcy. This paper introduces an application of a fuzzy set ranking method for the estimation of project contingencies. Fuzzy set ranking methods are generally based on the fuzzy sets theory developed by Lotfi Zadeh. The fundamentals of the fuzzy set ranking method adopted in this study have earlier been given in the literature. For practicality reasons, the method is being applied to the school building sector in Egypt. The selection of this particular sector is made due to the high level of standardization among the constructed facilities. Data for 30 construction projects in this sector were collected and used later, after proper <b>preparation,</b> <b>for</b> the <b>calculation</b> purposes. The paper then elaborates on the use of Monte Carlo simulation for the validation of the obtained results. Finally, the paper reports on the difference between the results from the fuzzy ranking method and Monte Carlo simulation. The difference generally turned out to be within an acceptable range...|$|R

40|$|A {{new table}} of the nuclear {{equation}} of state (EOS) based on realistic nuclear potentials is constructed for core-collapse supernova numerical simulations. Adopting the EOS of uniform nuclear matter constructed {{by two of the}} present authors with the cluster variational method starting from the Argonne v 18 and Urbana IX nuclear potentials, the Thomas-Fermi calculation is performed to obtain the minimized free energy of a Wigner-Seitz cell in non-uniform nuclear matter. As a <b>preparation</b> <b>for</b> the Thomas-Fermi <b>calculation,</b> the EOS of uniform nuclear matter is modified so as to remove the effects of deuteron cluster formation in uniform matter at low densities. Mixing of alpha particles is also taken into account following the procedure used by Shen et al. (1998, 2011). The critical densities with respect to the phase transition from non-uniform to uniform phase with the present EOS are slightly higher than those with the Shen EOS at small proton fractions. The critical temperature with respect to the liquid-gas phase transition decreases with the proton fraction in a more gradual manner than in the Shen EOS. Furthermore, the mass and proton numbers of nuclides appearing in non-uniform nuclear matter with small proton fractions are larger than those of the Shen EOS. These results are consequences {{of the fact that the}} density derivative coefficient of the symmetry energy of our EOS is smaller than that of the Shen EOS.

40|$|During {{the last}} years the {{increasing}} number of fatal coach accidents with tragic consequences for passengers showed the importance of passive safety in addition to the driver’s competence and active safety. In the European countries the certification of sufficient deformation strength when overturning is compulsory for the approval of a coach according to the ECE R 66 regulation. The certification is granted after positive results from crash tests or computer simulations with partial or full bus structure. The ECE R 66 regulation defines a survival space for the passengers which must remain intact after the accident. The tests specify either the overturning of the vehicle structure from a tilting platform or the impact of a plate on the coach structure as it would correspond to the crash of the structure when falling onto the ground. Since such tests with real vehicle structures are costly and computer efficiency, on the other hand, is becoming increasingly better and cheaper, crash simulations will play a more important role for the approval in the future. This paper will present different LS-DYNA – time simulations of the overturning test with a segment of a bus structure according to ECE R 66 and time simulations with a pivoted plate hitting with the same kinetic energy against the structure as the model falling from the tilting platform and crashing onto the floor. Several modelling configurations with deformable and rigid undercarriage, with different friction coefficients of the contact ground-structure, are simulated. These calculations shall serve as a <b>preparation</b> <b>for</b> future <b>calculations</b> to obtain the necessary certification. Unfortunately no experimental results are available at present to enable the comparison between hardware test and computer simulation. However, the experience gained with tilting tests of similar coach structures in the past indicates the trustworthiness of the calculations. As these experiences are published on the panel of a users’ meeting, this paper goes more then usual into detail regarding the modelling and the difficulties in simulations which the authors, until that time unfamiliar with LS-DYNA, has to overcome. A short introduction to the variable test possibilities explained in regulation ECE R 66 is given...|$|R

40|$|Observations of the {{chemical}} state of the atmosphere typically provide only sparse snapshots {{of the state of}} the system due to their insufficient temporal and spatial density. Therefore the measurement configurations need to be optimised to get a best possible state estimate. One possibility to optimise the state estimate is provided by observation targeting of sensitive system states, to identify measurement configurations of best value for forecast improvements. In recent years, numerical weather prediction adapted singular vector analysis with respect to initial values as a novel method to identify sensitive states. In the present work, this technique is transferred from meteorological to chemical forecast. Besides initial values, emissions are investigated as controlling variables. More precisely uncertainties in the amplitude of the diurnal profile of emissions are analysed, yielding emission factors as target variables. Singular vector analysis is extended to allow for projected target variables not only at final time but also at initial time. Further, special operators are introduced, which consider the combined influence of groups of chemical species. As a <b>preparation</b> <b>for</b> targeted observation <b>calculations,</b> the concept of adaptive observations is studied with a chemistry box model. For a set of six different scenarios, the VOC versus NOx limitation of the ozone formation is investigated. Results reveal, that the singular vectors are strongly dependent on start time and length of the simulation.
