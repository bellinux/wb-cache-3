40|$|Energy {{study was}} {{conducted}} in an organic fertilizer plant in Ibadan, Nigeria, to determine the energy requirement for production of both powdered and pelletised organic fertilizer. The energy consumption patterns of the unit operations were evaluated for production of 9, 000 kg of the finished products. The analysis revealed that eight and nine defined unit operations were required for the production of powder and pellets, respectively. The electrical and manual energy required for the production of <b>powdered</b> <b>fertilizer</b> were 94. 45 and 5. 55 % of the total energy, respectively, with corresponding 93. 9 and 5. 07 % for the production of pelletised fertilizer. The respective average energy intensities were estimated to be 0. 28 and 0. 35 MJ/kg for powder and pellets. The most energy intensive operation was identified as the pulverizing unit with energy intensity of 0. 09 MJ/kg, accounting for respective proportions of 33. 4 and 27. 0 % of the total energy for production of powder and pellets. Optimisation of the pulverizing process is suggested to make the system energy efficient...|$|E

40|$|Energetic {{materials}} encompass a {{wide range}} of chemical compounds all associated with a significant risk of fire and explosion. They include explosives, pyrotechnic materials, <b>powders,</b> <b>fertilizers</b> and other unsteady chemicals. These materials store a high level of chemical energy and are able to release it rapidly without external contribution of oxygen or other oxidizer. The aim of this work is the analysis of thermal and chemical characteristics of energy-rich materials under conditions that exclude detonations in order to better isolate the mechanisms involved in the burning process. The fire behaviour of energetic materials differs from that of classic solid fuels mainly due to the internal supply of oxidizer.

50|$|An {{alternative}} to the high frequency vibrating screens is the rotary sifter. A rotary sifter uses a screen which rotates in a circular motion and the finer particles are sifted through the apertures.

The rotary sifter will usually be chosen based {{on the nature of}} the substance being separated; whey, yeast bread mix, cheese <b>powder,</b> <b>fertilizers.</b> The rotary sifter is often preferred in the non-metallurgical industry and operates in a way to achieve a dust and noise free environment. The limitation for the rotary sifter is that it cannot handle a high capacity compared to the high frequency vibrating screen. Both equipment, however, achieve a high screening efficiency.|$|R

It was founded that presence of hydrophobic nanoparticles in composite system consisting of KCl hydrated salts powder and AM 1 - 300 hydrophobic nanosilica (stimulating and protective nanocomposite system «Ekostym» analogue) significantly increases water binding to the surface. As a result water retention in the composite is significantly highher than in <b>powder</b> <b>fertilizers.</b> There is an additional increase in water inter facial binding when KCl/AM 1 /H 2 O composite system contacts with hydrophobic substance that mimics the hydrophobic surface areas of seeds.

40|$|Alkaline and/or {{calcareous}} soils provide significant {{challenges for}} management of crop P nutrition, due to rapid fixation of P into sparingly soluble forms not readily accessible by plants. Three powder products, mono- and diammonium phosphate (MAP, DAP) and triple superphosphate (TSP), {{were compared to}} three liquid products, liquid MAP, ammonium polyphosphate (APP) and phosphoric acid (H 3 PO 4), as sources of P for wheat grown in four alkaline soils (grey and red calcareous soils, a Vertosol and a Sodosol) sampled in Eyre Peninsula (South Australia), Wimmera and Central Mallee areas (Victoria) of southern Australia. Soils were labelled with 32 P and the labile P pool and P derived from the fertilizer (Pdff) determined. Residual value of the fertilizers was determined after a 4 month wet/dry incubation. Liquid formulations outperformed powder products in the grey calcareous soil and in the Vertosol, as measured by wheat growth, P uptake, plant-labile P pools and Pdff. These increases in P efficiency were not related to differential acidification of the bulk soils. In the most calcareous soil, large proportions of the added DAP, MAP or TSP were rapidly converted (fixed) into non plant-labile pools, likely through precipitation of Ca–P compounds not accessible to plant roots, while conversely, liquid formulations minimized P fixation. Our results suggest {{that one of the}} most likely hypotheses to explain difference in efficiencies between powder and liquid forms of fertilizers was that in relatively dry conditions and in high P fixing soils, the dissolution and diffusion of P outwards from the powder is limited. This induces localized areas in the soil with high concentrations of P leading to precipitation of insoluble Ca–P solid phases. In the field, where <b>powder</b> <b>fertilizers</b> are applied as granules rather than as fine powder, differences between the two forms of fertilizer are likely to be larger. The residual value of liquid formulations was equal or superior to <b>powder</b> products. Liquid <b>fertilizers</b> injected into soil may therefore have potential to improve P nutrition in a wide range of calcareous soils under dryland agriculture throughout the world. Field trials have actually been performed in southern Australia to confirm this important issue. Isabelle Bertrand, Mike J. McLaughlin, Robert E. Holloway, Roger D.

The fertilizer was prepared in three variants as a pure fertilizer containing makroelements N, P, K, Mg and S and microelements Fe, Cu, Zn, B and Mo. Extracts of seaweed {{were added to}} the second variant, the third one contained a surface-active agent, and the fourth one contained all the additives. In the spring before the fertilizer was applied, soil analysis was performed. Altogether the fertilizer was applied on the leaves five times. During the softening of berries, leaves were removed for an analysis. The analysis focused on the fertilizer efficiency and its ability to penetrate the leaves. In the stage of full grapes' maturity, uvological characteristics were evaluated. Samples for the juice analysis were removed from the harvested grapes. The following analytical values were determined: content of titrationable acids, sugar content, pH and assimilable nitrogen content. Individual variants were compared with a control variant without foliar application. The variant with the water-soluble fertilizer and the surface-active agent was determined as the best one, because it showed the best results from the perspective of leave analysis, increased sugar content, reduction of acid content and increased content of assimilable nitrogen. There were no differences observed in the plant health conditions nor uvological characteristics of individual variants. No influence of the seaweed extract on the grape quality was observed.

40|$|Improvised {{explosives}} may {{be based}} on smokeless gunpowder, fertilizers, or inorganic oxidizers such as nitrate (NO 3 -), chlorate (ClO 3 -), and perchlorate (ClO 4 -) salts. Identification is a priority for the military and law enforcement but due to their varying physical properties and complexity, identification can be challenging. Consequently, three methods {{have been developed to}} aid in presumptive and confirmatory detection. Smokeless powder contains plasticizers, stabilizers, dyes, opacifiers, flash suppressants, and other compounds. Identification of these additives can narrow down or identify the brands of smokeless powder used in a device. Fourteen organic smokeless powder components were identified by capillary electrochromatography (CEC) using a hexyl acrylate monolithic stationary phase coupled to UV detection and time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOF-MS). The CEC-UV method efficiently detects all 14 organic components, while TOF-MS provides sensitivity and selectivity. A mixed smokeless powder component standard was analyzed and the composition of the additive package in commercial smokeless powders determined. Detection limits ranged from 1. 0 – 3. 2 μg/ml and analysis time was 18 minutes. Second, a procedure for the detection of urea nitrate (UN) and ammonium nitrate (AN) by infusion electrospray ionization - mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) was developed. Solubility tests were performed to find a solvent for both UN and AN that did not cause UN to dissociate. Two adduct ions were detected for each explosive: for AN, m/z 178 [2 AN+NH 4]+ and m/z 258 [3 AN+NH 4]+ ions, and for UN m/z 185 [UN+NO 3]− and m/z 248 [UN+HNO 3 +NO 3]−. Specificity of the analysis was examined by mixing the explosives with various salts and interferents. Gas-phase adduct ions were useful in distinguishing between ion pairs and mixed salts. Finally, a paper microfluidic device (PMD) was developed as a presumptive test using colorimetric reagents for the detection of ions associated with improvised explosives. The device was configured to test for nitrate (NO 3 -), nitrite (NO 2 -), chlorate (ClO 3 -), perchlorate (ClO 4 -), and urea nitrate (UN). Proof of concept was performed using extracts of soil containing inorganic oxidizers. The development of these analytical methods allows the detection of smokeless <b>powder</b> components, <b>fertilizers,</b> and oxidizers and expands the suite of analytical methods available for the analysis of improvised explosives...|$|R

40|$|Three {{factorial}} {{experiments with}} four replications {{were conducted in}} a greenhouse to examine the effectiveness of gypsum, elemental sulfur (ES powder) and three S containing N fertilizers, viz., ammonium sulfate (AS), urea ES, and Ureas (20 % AS and 80 % urea). All experiments were conducted twice in different years. In the first experiment with uncropped soil, the effects of soil type, leaching rate (2. 3 and 6. 9 mm water per day) and urea addition on sulfate leaching losses were studied. Leaching losses decreased in the order Ureas > ammonium sulfate (AS) > gypsum urea ES. Increasing the leaching rate greatly increased sulfate losses from both soils. Losses were greater in the sandy Typic Hapludoll than in the clayey Oxic Paleustalf. Sulfate adsorption was found to decrease strongly with rising the pH in both soils. Hydrolysis of urea temporarily raised the pH of the soil, thereby increasing the sulfate leaching losses. In the second experiment the effects of S rate (0 – 65 mg per kg soil), split application and leaching rate (0 and 2. 3 mm per day) on sulfate leaching losses and apparent S recovery (ASR) by three successive cuts of ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) were studied. Herbage yield more than doubled when S was applied. The effectiveness of the sulfate fertilizers was greater when S was split-applied than given all at once. With split applications the ASR decreased in the order: Ureas > AS > gypsum > urea ES > ES <b>powder.</b> ES <b>fertilizers</b> were least effective, because the oxidation rate of ES to sulfate was clearly too slow. In the third experiment the effects of S rate (0 – 40 mg per kg soil) and split application on sulfate leaching losses and ASR in the grain of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) were studied under leaching conditions (2. 3 mm per day). Grain yield increased strongly due to S application. Split application greatly increased {{the effectiveness of the}} sulfate fertilizers and appeared to be an effective tool in satisfying the S need of the crop under leaching conditions.

40|$|The Thi 8 s {{abattoir}} in Senegal is {{no longer}} a source of environmental pollution. The solid waste from slaughtered animals is fermented in a tank. This produces compost and biogas, the biogas being used to provide power to the abattoir. The waste water is purified by a lagoon system. Vast pastoral regions stretch across the Sahel and the huge number of animals slaughtered causes serious pollution problems around the region's abattoirs. More than 15, 500 tonnes of animal waste pile up each year in the areas surrounding the cities causing pollution and, because they produce methane, intensifying the greenhouse effect. Furthermore, 570, 000 cubic metres of waste water are released every year into water systems, such as the Hann Bay in Dakar, the Niger River at Niamey or the Abidjan lagoon, which are often already over-saturated by pollutants. Specialists addressing this problem have rejected the use of traditional purifying stations primarily on the grounds of cost, but also because abattoir waste is rich in organic matter which could be put to good use. Since 1989 the Soci 9 t 9 d'exploitation des ressources animales au S 9 n 9 gal (SERAS), together with the Centre de coop 9 ration internationale en recherche agronomique pour le d 9 veloppement (CIRAD), has been operating a pilot scheme for the treatment of animal waste from the abattoir in Thi 8 s, Senegal's second city. The results of this project will be transferred from Thi 8 s to the Dakar slaughterhouse, where 43, 000 tonnes of untreated waste are dumped in the Hann Bay annually, not counting the water used for rinsing the hides, which is full of extremely toxic substances such as arsenic. A solution to this problem was long overdue especially since Senegal, in common with most other countries across Africa, is now considering bringing in regulations for the disposal of animal waste products and introducing taxes on pollution. Fermenting and composting the solid waste The waste which once polluted the environment of Thi 8 s (stomach contents, blood, faecal and visceral matter) is nowadays put in a large tank, the Transpaille fermenter, where it decomposes. 2000 t of carcasses and 480 t of waste products produce 55 t of compost. 'The chemical and biological fertility of cultivated land is hard to maintain, especially in tropical regions, and organic enrichment is necessary. The compost produced by treating abattoir waste is a new and high-quality form of fertilizer,' explains ClRAD's Jean-Luc Farinet. There are no difficulties in finding outlets for this compost near Niayes, where there are 10, 000 ha of market gardens.
