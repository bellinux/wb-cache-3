40|$|A {{strain gauge}} load cell with {{separate}} bridges for {{measurement of the}} pull and the bending moment in the plane containing the net neck load and pull was developed and fixed in the longitudinal member of an experimental cart. A cart fitted first with <b>pneumatic</b> <b>wheels</b> and then with steel-rimmed wooden wheels was tested on three terrains—tar road, mud road and grassy terrain. Pull vs time and moment vs time records were obtained in each test and analysed. It is found that the bullocks pull the cart rather discontinuously at the low velocities at which these carts normally operate. On the tar road and the grassy terrain, the mean static coefficient of friction is significantly higher for the cart with steelrimmed wooden wheels. The dynamic frictional resistance of the terrain for the cart with steel-rimmed wooden wheels is lower than for the cart with <b>pneumatic</b> <b>wheels</b> {{so long as the}} wheels do not dig or sink into the terrain. The fluctuation in the neck load is lower in the cart fitted with <b>pneumatic</b> <b>wheels.</b> Also, the ground-induced low-amplitude high-frequency vibratory load content in the neck load is lower in the cart with <b>pneumatic</b> <b>wheels.</b> ...|$|R
50|$|Walther {{had been}} {{thinking}} about wheel designs for pneumatic tires because the increased speed of commercial vehicles was causing problems with the solid rubber tires.

Walther studied these wheels and the ones being made by Firestone in this country. He felt that both could be vastly improved.|$|E

50|$|In 1943, Woodbridge was {{constructed}} in the south-east as one of three airfields set up to accept distressed aircraft returning from raids over Germany, and was therefore fitted with extra-long, heavy-duty runways (the other two being at RAF Manston in Kent and RAF Carnaby in Yorkshire).These airfields were intended for use by returning bombers suffering from low-fuel and suspected damage to their <b>pneumatic</b> (<b>wheel</b> brake) and/or hydraulic (Control surface) systems. All three airfields were equipped with a single runway, 9,000 ft (2,700 m) long and 750 ft (230 m) wide.

The northern and central lanes were allocated by flying control, while the southern lane was the emergency lane on which any aircraft could land without first making contact with the airfield.It was initially called RAF Sutton Heath.The site at Woodbridge was chosen as it was 'nearly fog-free and had no obstructions for miles', although more than a million trees had to be cleared from Rendlesham Forest to take the new base. Its first use, however was in July 1943, when it was used by an American Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bomber.|$|E

Here, then, we have the means of pulling or pushing the travelling carriages along their subterranean road, and as we speak we see it in operation: for a mail-guard opens a door, throws in two or three mail-bags just snatched out of the guard's van as it rolls into the mainline station, the iron carriages are shoved into the tube, the air-tight door at its mouth is closed... and we hear them rumbling off on their subterranean journey at a rate, we are informed, of twenty miles an hour... a bell connected with an electric telegraph warns him that the attendant {{at the other end of}} the tube is about to thrust the carriage into the tube on its return journey.

40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} {{the front}} wheel of the Leveraged Freedom Chair (LFC) an all-terrain, off-road wheelchair with two distinct models: one for the developing world and one specifically for American riders. The functional requirements of performance and price, were designated by the start-up company Global Research Innovation and Technology (GRIT), which makes the LFC. This study includes comparisons between the original rubber wheel, which is currently being used as {{the front wheel}} of the LFC, and alternative wheels available for purchase. The goal {{was to find a}} new wheel which could be implemented for future manufacturing to increase the lifespan of the LFC, improve the ride quality and efficiency of production. Based on performance it is concluded that a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>wheel</b> of comparable geometry to the original rubber wheel is the best alternative for the American chair where maintenance is more routine and replacement parts and service are readily available. For the developing world future work is necessary to either improve the quality of the original rubber wheel or select a low cost, low maintenance alternative. by Sara Elizabeth Falcone. Thesis: S.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the results of}} a study of the correlation between the performances of wheels for lunar vehicles predicted using the Nepean wheeled vehicle performance model (NWVPM), developed under the auspices of Vehicle Systems Development Corporation, Ottawa, Canada, and the corresponding test data presented in Performance evaluation of wheels for lunar vehicles, Technical Report M- 70 - 2, prepared for George C. Marshall Space Flight Center, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), USA, by the US Army Engineer Waterways Experiment Station (WES). The NWVPM was originally developed for design and performance evaluation of terrestrial off-road wheeled vehicles. The {{purpose of this study is}} to assess the potential of the NWVPM for evaluating wheel candidates for the new generation of extra-terrestrial vehicles. Two versions of a wire-mesh wheel and a hoop-spring wheel, which were considered as candidates for lunar roving vehicles for the NASA Apollo program in the late 1960 s, together with a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>wheel</b> were examined in this study. The tractive performances of these wheels and of a 464 test vehicle with the pneumatic wheels on air-dry sand were predicted using the NWVPM and compared with the corresponding test data obtained under Earth s gravity and previously documented in the above-named report. While test data on wheel or vehicle performances obtained under Earth s gravity may not necessarily be representative of those on extra-terrestrial bodies, because of the differences in gravity and in environmental conditions, such as atmospheric pressure, it is still a valid approach to use test data obtained under Earth s gravity to evaluate the predictive capability of the NWVPM and its potential applications to predicting wheel or wheeled rover performances on extra-terrestrial bodies. Results of this study show that, using the ratio (P 20 /W) of the drawbar pull to normal load at 20 per cent slip as a performance indicator, there is a reasonable correlation between the predictions and experimental data. This indicates that the NWVPM has the potential as an engineering tool for evaluating wheel candidates for a future generation of extra-terrestrial vehicles, provided that appropriate input data are available...|$|E
