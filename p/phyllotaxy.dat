40|$|<b>Phyllotaxy</b> {{describes}} the geometric arrangement {{of leaves and}} is important for plant productivity. Auxin is well known to regulate phyllotactic patterns via PIN 1 -dependent auxin polar transport, and studies of maize (Zea mays) aberrant <b>phyllotaxy</b> 1 (abph 1) mutants suggest the importance of auxin and cytokinin signaling for control of <b>phyllotaxy.</b> However, whether additional regulators control these patterns is poorly understood. Here, we report a new dominant maize mutant, Aberrant <b>phyllotaxy</b> 2 (Abph 2), in which the shoot meristems are enlarged and the phyllotactic pattern switches from alternate to decussate. Map-based cloning revealed that the Abph 2 mutation was caused by transposition of a glutaredoxin gene, MALE STERILE CONVERTED ANTHER 1 (MSCA 1), which gained an altered expression pattern in Abph 2 mutant embryos. msca 1 loss-of-function mutants have reduced meristem size and revealed a novel function of glutaredoxins in meristem growth. In addition, MSCA 1 interacts with a TGA transcription factor, FASCIATED EAR 4, suggesting a novel regulatory module for regulating shoot meristem size...|$|E
40|$|<b>Phyllotaxy,</b> the {{arrangement}} of organs along the stem, has puzzled scientists for centuries.

40|$|During postembryonic {{development}} of higher plants, the shoot apical meristem produces lateral organs {{in a regular}} spacing (<b>phyllotaxy)</b> and a regular timing (plastochron). Molecular analysis of mutants associated with <b>phyllotaxy</b> and plastochron would greatly increase understanding of the developmental mechanism of plant architecture because <b>phyllotaxy</b> and plastochron are fundamental regulators of plant architecture. pla 1 of rice {{is not only a}} plastochron mutant showing rapid leaf initiation without affecting <b>phyllotaxy,</b> but also a heterochronic mutant showing ectopic shoot formation in the reproductive phase. Thus, pla 1 provides a tool for analyzing the molecular basis of temporal regulation in leaf development. In this work, we isolated the PLA 1 gene by map-based cloning. The identified PLA 1 gene encodes a cytochrome P 450, CYP 78 A 11, which potentially catalyzes substances controlling plant development. PLA 1 is expressed in developing leaf primordia, bracts of the panicle, and elongating internodes, but not in the shoot apical meristem. The expression pattern and mutant phenotype suggest that the PLA 1 gene acting in developing leaf primordia affects the timing of successive leaf initiation and the termination of vegetative growth...|$|E

Models of auxin flux capable of recapitulating spiral phyllotaxis predict handed auxin asymmetries in initiating leaf primordia with empirically verifiable effects on superficially bilaterally symmetric leaves. Here, we extend a similar analysis of leaf asymmetry to decussate and distichous <b>phyllotaxy.</b> We found that our simulation models of these two patterns predicted mirrored asymmetries in auxin distribution in leaf primordia pairs. To empirically verify the morphological consequences of asymmetric auxin distribution, we analysed the morphology of a tomato sister-of-pin-formed 1 a (sopin 1 a) mutant, entire- 2, in which spiral <b>phyllotaxy</b> consistently transitions to a decussate state. Shifts in the displacement of leaflets {{on the left and}} right sides of entire- 2 leaf pairs mirror each other, corroborating predicted model results. We then analyse the shape of more than 800 common ivy (Hedera helix) and more than 3000 grapevine (Vitis and Ampelopsis spp.) leaf pairs and find statistical enrichment of predicted mirrored asymmetries. Our results demonstrate that left-right auxin asymmetries in models of decussate and distichous <b>phyllotaxy</b> successfully predict mirrored asymmetric leaf morphologies in superficially symmetric leave...|$|E
40|$|The flower {{meristem}} identity genes floricaula (flo) and squamosa (squa) {{promote a}} change in <b>phyllotaxy</b> from spiral to whorled in Antirrhinum. To determine how this might be achieved, we have performed a combination of morphological, genetic, and expression analyses. Comparison of the phenotypes and RNA expression patterns of single and double mutants with the wild type showed that flo and squa act together to promote flower development but that flo is epistatic to squa with respect to early effects on <b>phyllotaxy.</b> We propose that a common process underlies the <b>phyllotaxy</b> of wildtype, flo, and squa meristem development but that the relative timing of primordium initiation or growth is altered. This process depends on two separable events: setting aside zones for potential primordium initiation and partitioning these zones into discrete primordia.

40|$|<b>Phyllotaxy</b> {{describes}} the geometric pattern {{of leaves and}} flowers, and has intrigued botanists and mathematicians for centuries. How these patterns are initiated is poorly understood, and this {{is partly due to}} the paucity of mutants. Signalling by the plant hormone auxin appears to determine the site of leaf initiation; however, this observation does not explain how distinct patterns of <b>phyllotaxy</b> are initiated. abphyl 1 (abph 1) mutants of maize initiate leaves in a decussate pattern (that is, paired at 180 degrees), in contrast to the alternating or distichous <b>phyllotaxy</b> observed in wild-type maize and other grasses. Here we show that ABPH 1 is homologous to two-component response regulators and is induced by the plant hormone cytokinin. ABPH 1 is expressed in the embryonic shoot apical meristem, and its spatial expression pattern changes rapidly with cytokinin treatment. We propose that ABPH 1 controls phyllotactic patterning by negatively regulating the cytokinin-induced expansion of the shoot meristem, thereby limiting the space available for primordium initiation at the apex...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{fascinating}} aspects of plant morphology is the regular geometric arrangement of leaves and flowers, called <b>phyllotaxy.</b> The shoot apical meristem (SAM) determines these patterns, which vary depending on species and developmental stage. Auxin acts as an instructive signal in leaf initiation, and its transport has been implicated in <b>phyllotaxy</b> regulation in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Altered phyllotactic patterns are observed in a maize (Zea mays) mutant, aberrant <b>phyllotaxy</b> 1 (abph 1, also known as abphyl 1), and ABPH 1 encodes a cytokinin-inducible type A response regulator, suggesting that cytokinin signals are also involved in the mechanism by which phyllotactic patterns are established. Therefore, we investigated the interaction between auxin and cytokinin signaling in <b>phyllotaxy.</b> Treatment of maize shoots with a polar auxin transport inhibitor, 1 -naphthylphthalamic acid, strongly reduced ABPH 1 expression, suggesting that auxin or its polar transport is required for ABPH 1 expression. Immunolocalization of the PINFORMED 1 (PIN 1) polar auxin transporter revealed that PIN 1 expression marks leaf primordia in maize, similarly to Arabidopsis. Interestingly, maize PIN 1 expression at the incipient leaf primordium was greatly reduced in abph 1 mutants. Consistently, auxin levels were reduced in abph 1, and the maize PIN 1 homolog was induced not only by auxin but also by cytokinin treatments. Our results indicate distinct roles for ABPH 1 as a negative regulator of SAM size and a positive regulator of PIN 1 expression. These studies highlight a complex interaction between auxin and cytokinin signaling in the specification of phyllotactic patterns and suggest an alternative model for the generation of altered phyllotactic patterns in abph 1 mutants. We propose that reduced auxin levels and PIN 1 expression in abph 1 mutant SAMs delay leaf initiation, contributing to the enlarged SAM and altered <b>phyllotaxy</b> of these mutants.

40|$|Plants {{display a}} wide variety of three {{dimensional}} forms, or architectures, that are critical for their survival in competitive environments or, in the case of crops, for their productivity.

40|$|Organogenesis {{in plants}} {{occurs at the}} shoot apical meristem, a group of {{indeterminate}} stem cells that are organized during embryogenesis.

The mechanism by which these patterns, termed phyllotaxies, are generated, remains unclear. Maize plants initiate leaves singly, alternating {{from one side to the}} other in a regular pattern. Here we describe a recessive maize mutant, abphyl 1, that initiates leaves in opposite pairs, in a pattern termed decussate <b>phyllotaxy.</b> The decussate shoot meristems are larger than normal throughout development, though the general structure and organization of the meristem is not altered. abph 1 mutants are first distinguished during embryogenesis, prior to true leaf initiation, by a larger shoot meristem and coincident larger expression domain of the homeobox gene knotted 1.

40|$|PREMISE OF THE STUDY: The small {{primarily}} Australian commelinid monocot family Centrolepidaceae displays remarkably high structural {{diversity that}} has been hitherto relatively poorly explored. Data on Centrolepidaceae are important for comparison with other Poales, including grasses and sedges. METHODS: We examined vegetative and reproductive morphology in a global survey of Centrolepidaceae based on light and scanning electron microscopy of 18 species, representing all three genera. We used these data to perform a cladistic analysis to assess character evolution. KEY RESULTS: Each of the three genera is monophyletic; Centrolepis is sister to Aphelia. Some Centrolepidaceae show a change from spiral to distichous <b>phyllotaxy</b> on inflorescence transition. In Aphelia and most species of Centrolepis, several morphologically distinct leaf types develop along the primary shoot axis and flowers are confined to dorsiventral lateral spikelets. Centrolepis racemosa displays secondary unification of programs of leaf development, absence of the leaf hyperphyll and loss of shoot dimorphism. Presence or absence of a leaf ligule and features of inflorescence and flower morphology are useful as phylogenetic characters in Centrolepidaceae. CONCLUSIONS: Ontogenetic changes in <b>phyllotaxy</b> differ fundamentally between some Centrolepidaceae and many grasses. Inferred evolutionary transformations of <b>phyllotaxy</b> in Centrolepidaceae inflorescences also differ from those in grasses. In contrast with grasses, some Centrolepidaceae possess ligulate leaves where the ligule represents {{the boundary between the}} bifacial hypophyll and unifacial hyperphyll. All the highly unusual features of the morphological-misfit species Centrolepis racemosa could result from the same saltational event.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} {{regulating the}} pattern of leaf initiation was analyzed by using shoot organization (sho) mutants derived from three loci (SHO 1, SHO 2, and SHO 3). In the early vegetative phase, sho mutants show an increased rate of leaf production with random <b>phyllotaxy.</b> The resulting leaves are malformed, threadlike, or short and narrow. Their shoot apical meristems are relatively low and wide, that is, flat shaped, although their shape and size are highly variable among plants of the same genotype. Statistical analysis reveals that {{the shape of the}} shoot meristem rather than its size is closely correlated with the variations of plastochron and <b>phyllotaxy.</b> Rapid and random leaf production in sho mutants is correlated with the frequent and disorganized cell divisions in the shoot meristem and with a reduction of expression domain of a rice homeobox gene, OSH 1. These changes in the organization and behavior of the shoot apical meristems suggest that sho mutants have fewer indeterminate cells and more determinate cells than wild type, with many cells acting as leaf founder cells. Thus, the SHO genes have an important role in maintaining the proper organization of the shoot apical meristem, which is essential for the normal initiation pattern of leaf primordia...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn plants, {{the shoot}} apical {{meristem}} (SAM) {{serves as a}} reservoir of pluripotent stem cells from which all above ground organs originate. To sustain proper growth, the SAM must maintain homeostasis between the self-renewal of pluripotent stem cells and cell recruitment for lateral organ formation. At {{the core of the}} network that regulates this homeostasis in Arabidopsis are the WUSCHEL (WUS) transcription factor specifying stem cell fate and the CLAVATA (CLV) ligand-receptor system limiting WUS expression. In this study, we identified the ERECTA (ER) pathway as a second receptor kinase signaling pathway that regulates WUS expression, and therefore shoot apical and floral meristem size, independently of the CLV pathway. We demonstrate that reduction in class III HD-ZIP and ER function together leads to a significant increase in WUS expression, resulting in extremely enlarged shoot meristems and a switch from spiral to whorled vegetative <b>phyllotaxy.</b> We further show that strong upregulation of WUS in the inflorescence meristem leads to ectopic expression of the AGAMOUS homeotic gene to a level that switches cell fate from floral meristem founder cell to carpel founder cell, suggesting an indirect role for ER in regulating floral meristem identity. This work illustrates the delicate balance between stem cell specification and differentiation in the meristem and shows that a shift in this balance leads to abnormal <b>phyllotaxy</b> and to altered reproductive cell fate...|$|E
