5|$|The {{speed of}} the HPOTP and HPFTP {{turbines}} depends on {{the position of the}} corresponding oxidizer and fuel preburner oxidizer valves. These valves are positioned by the engine controller, which uses them to throttle the flow of liquid oxygen to the preburners and, thus, control engine thrust. The oxidizer and fuel preburner oxidizer valves increase or decrease the liquid oxygen flow, thus increasing or decreasing preburner chamber pressure, HPOTP and HPFTP turbine speed, and liquid oxygen and gaseous hydrogen flow into the main combustion chamber, which increases or decreases engine thrust. The oxidizer and fuel preburner valves operate together to throttle the engine and maintain a constant 6.03:1 <b>propellant</b> <b>mixture</b> ratio.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, fuel {{flows through}} the main fuel valve into {{regenerative}} cooling systems for the nozzle and MCC, or through the chamber coolant valve. Fuel passing through the MCC cooling system then passes back through the LPFTP turbine before being routed either to the fuel tank pressurization system or to the hot gas manifold cooling system (from where it passes into the MCC). Fuel in the nozzle cooling and chamber coolant valve systems is then sent via pre-burners into the HPFTP turbine and HPOTP before being reunited again in the hot gas manifold, from where it passes into the MCC injectors. Once in the injectors, the propellants are mixed and injected into the main combustion chamber where they are ignited. The burning <b>propellant</b> <b>mixture</b> is then ejected through the throat and bell of the engine's nozzle, the pressure of which creates the thrust.|$|E

50|$|Increasing {{the nozzle}} {{pressure}} ratio further will not increase the throat Mach number above one. Downstream (i.e. {{external to the}} nozzle) the flow is free to expand to supersonic velocities; however Mach 1 {{can be a very}} high speed for a hot gas because the speed of sound varies as the square root of absolute temperature.

50|$|In {{a normal}} ramjet, air is {{compressed}} between a spike-shaped centerbody and an outer cowling, fuel is added and burned, and high speed exhaust gases are expanded supersonically {{out of the}} nozzle to generate thrust. In a ram accelerator, a projectile having a shape similar to the ramjet centerbody is fired, (often from a conventional gun), into the accelerator barrel, causing compression between the projectile and the barrel's walls. The barrel contains a pre-mixed gaseous fuel-air mixture. As the ram accelerator projectile compresses the fuel-air mixture, it is ignited and the combustion is stabilized {{at the base of}} the projectile. The resulting pressure differential generates a prodigious amount of thrust that can accelerate projectiles to in-tube Mach numbers greater than 8. Thus, if <b>propellant</b> <b>mixtures</b> with a speed of sound of 1000 m/s (e.g. fuel-rich H2-O2 mixtures) are used, muzzle velocities in excess of 8000 m/s are possible.|$|R
40|$|Work on {{hypersonic}} propulsion {{research using}} a ram accelerator is presented. Several different ram accelerator propulsive cycles have been experimentally demonstrated over the Mach number range of 3 to 8. 5. The subsonic, thermally choked combustion mode has accelerated projectiles to near the Chapman-Jouguet (C-J) detonation velocity within many different <b>propellant</b> <b>mixtures.</b> In the transdetonative velocity regime (85 to 115 percent of C-J speed), projectiles {{have established a}} propulsive cycle which allows them to transition smoothly from subdetonative to superdetonative velocities. Luminosity data indicate that the combustion process moves forward onto the projectile body as it approaches the C-J speed. In the superdetonative velocity range, the projectiles accelerate while always traveling faster than the C-J velocity. Ram accelerator projectiles operating continuously through these velocity regimes generate distinctive hypersonic phenomena which can be studied very effectively in the laboratory. These results would be very useful for validating sophisticated CFD computer codes and in collecting engineering data for potential airbreathing hypersonic propulsive systems...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that MPD thruster performance, as measured by thrust, specific impulse, and efficiency, is limited by a so-called 'onset' current level. Experimental results are presented which show that the onset current level varies with the radial position of mass injection. Specifically, mass injection into either of two zones results in drastically different performance for both argon and xenon propellants. This difference in performance is evidenced by the onset current levels, the onset V-J signatures, and the overall V-J characteristics. The behavior of the thruster with the total mass flow split between the two zones follows a transition between the zonal behavioral limits. The behavior of <b>propellant</b> <b>mixtures</b> also follows a transition between the behavior of the individual propellant species. The flow region between the two zones is characterized by a particle number density discontinuity, a large axial current density, and a large electron Hall parameter, suggesting a possible correlation between observed onset phenomena and a shear-flow discontinuity located in the region between the two zones...|$|R
