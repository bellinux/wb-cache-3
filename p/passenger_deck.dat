25|$|The flight left Hong Kong on 25 July 2008 {{shortly after}} 9:00 am HKT (0100 UTC). At 10:17 HKT (0217 UTC), {{passengers}} and crew heard a loud bang; the cabin de-pressurised and {{a hole in the}} floor of the <b>passenger</b> <b>deck</b> appeared, as well as a hole in the outside wall of the cargo deck. During the emergency, parts of the aircraft's floor and ceiling collapsed. Passengers reported that, despite the noise and the deployment of the oxygen masks, there was very little panic. The pilots conducted an emergency descent from 29,000feet to ensure adequate oxygen supply for the passengers, reaching 10,000feet by 10:24 HKT (02:24 UTC).|$|E

The three decks were linked by staircases forward and aft, with a main staircase amidships with double flights and double entrances which ran from the lower cabin to the upper saloon, described as a particularly fine piece of workmanship.|$|E
2500|$|Somewhat exceptionally, R.R.

J.J. Holland (1843-1893) as was R.R. Thompson.|$|E

2500|$|Daily {{must have}} been reconstructed when {{acquired}} by CPR, as the pilot house was moved down from the boat deck to the <b>passenger</b> <b>deck</b> to approximately where the forward passenger cabin had been. [...] The Texas (the small cabin structure on the boat deck just behind the pilot house) was completely removed, and there {{appears to have been}} a cargo boom added to the mast, indicating a change in use from passenger to mixed passenger and freight.|$|E
2500|$|Two French citizens, Jean Christophe Allain, aged 45, and his {{daughter}} Maud, 16, were listed as missing. Allain's wife said her cabin filled with water when the ship struck rocks and that she narrowly escaped.

The family were accommodated in cabin 2014 [...] an outside standard cabin on the starboard side of the vessel on deck 2, the lowest <b>passenger</b> <b>deck.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Flyer [...] was {{powered by}} a triple {{compound}} steam engine built by the Philadelphia firm of Neafie and Levy. It was a duplicate of one installed in J.P. Morgan's yacht Corsair. The bore sizes for the three cylinders, from high pressure to low pressure, were 21¼ʺ, 33½ʺ, and 54½ʺ, all with 30ʺ stroke. The engine drew national attention when it was built. It rose above the <b>passenger</b> <b>deck,</b> and passengers looked forward to watching the huge low-pressure cylinder, almost five feet across, drive the vessel at high speed.|$|E

2500|$|MV Dartmouth Castle's {{appearance}} was completely {{changed in the}} late 70's when, in common with many similar vessels, her promenade deck was covered over. [...] Whilst many of these conversions resulted in rather ungainly looking vessels, MV Dartmouth Castle was, if anything improved. [...] The new deckhouse covers around two-thirds of the former promenade deck, is open at its aft end, and has an open <b>passenger</b> <b>deck,</b> along with a new wheelhouse above. [...] She has also gained a small funnel behind the wheelhouse. [...] The new arrangement emphasises the terraced arrangement of the aft decks. [...] The bar and toilets remain in the lower saloon.|$|E
2500|$|The pier was [...] {{long with}} a [...] <b>passenger</b> <b>deck.</b> This {{comprised}} three [...] wooden spans suspended [...] above high water from lengths of wrought-iron chain connecting cast-iron standards to the shore. Each standard {{was in the}} shape of an arch which the passengers walked through. By 1838 the <b>passenger</b> <b>deck</b> had rails fitted to assist in moving large items of luggage. The chain was made of eye bolts about [...] long, which, uniquely among Brown's designs, varied in thickness according to the load they were expected to carry. The long eye bolts were joined by shorter linking plates, and hung in a catenary [...] from the tops of the standards. The chains crossed the standards on cast-iron saddles. The three seaward standards were built on platforms anchored to wooden piles driven into the foreshore. The largest platform, which formed the head of the pier, was [...] by , and covered in [...] thick planks. The length of the pier head was extended to [...] prior to November 1821. It was supported on 46 piles driven [...] into the clay seabed. At the landward end the chain passed over a solid masonry construction, [...] square and [...] high, and was then anchored at a 45° angle [...] into the hard clay soil. The seaward end of the chain went over the outer piles at the same angle, and the piles were braced with diagonal supports to take the sideways load. There was a [...] wrought-iron railing {{along the length of the}} deck, straight diagonal members connecting the deck to the standards, and iron bracing under the deck. The pier was designed for passenger use only, and moved noticeably when walked on.|$|E

2500|$|Lytton was {{a typical}} Columbia River steamer. She had three decks, the first one being {{reserved}} for freight, machinery and crew quarters, the second for passengers, including cabins and an observation saloon. Down {{the center of the}} <b>passenger</b> <b>deck</b> was a dining room with raised clerestory windows At the front of the top deck was placed the pilot house. Just behind the pilot house was a small structure called the [...] "", which contained cabins for the officers. Behind the [...] was the vessel's single funnel, and {{on the front of the}} funnel was the steamer's whistle. In the case of Lytton, the funnel flared out in cone near the top, and may have been fitted with a spark arrestor. This detail was somewhat unusual and allows Lytton to be more readily identified in photographs of the period. The foredeck was open, and was often heavily loaded with cordwood fuel or cargo.|$|E
2500|$|The Fairmile is {{a wooden}} hulled {{passenger}} vessel. Her hulls-form is very fine for a vessel of her type; {{it is based}} on a destroyer hull, albeit much smaller, as her original speed was some 20 knots.

The main deck has a forward open <b>passenger</b> <b>deck.</b> Aft of this, the forward deckhouse contains a chart room. [...] In the centre of the main deck is a raised open deck area, surrounding the funnel, and with the open flybridge above the chartroom.
