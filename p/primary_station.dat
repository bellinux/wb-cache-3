40|$|Abstract—The radio {{spectrum}} is a scarce resource. Cognitive radio stretches this resource by enabling secondary stations {{to operate in}} portions of the spectrum that are reserved for <b>primary</b> <b>stations</b> but not currently used by the <b>primary</b> <b>stations.</b> As it is whenever stations share resources, coordination is a central issue in cognitive radio networks: absent coordination, there may be collision, congestion or interference, with concomitant loss of performance. Cognitive radio networks require coordination of secondary <b>stations</b> with <b>primary</b> <b>stations</b> (so that secondary stations should not interfere with <b>primary</b> <b>stations)</b> and of secondary stations with each other. Coordination in this setting is especially challenging because of {{the various types of}} sensing errors. This paper proposes novel protocols that enable secondary stations to learn and teach with the goal of coordinating to achieve a round-robin Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) schedule. These protocols are completely distributed (requiring neither central control nor the exchange of any control messages), fast (with speeds exceeding those of existing protocols), efficient (in terms of throughput and delay) and scalable. The protocols proposed rely on cooperative learning, exploiting the ability of stations to learn from and condition on their own histories while simultaneously teaching other stations about these histories. Analytic results and simulations illustrate the power of these protocols.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} resource allocation for the Third Generation Partnership Project (3 GPP) long-term evolution (LTE) cognitive radio network (CRN). The CRN {{is made up of}} the licensed (<b>primary)</b> service <b>stations</b> which can share their spectrum resources with the unlicensed (secondary) stations. The objective is to provide wireless access to the secondary stations on a best effort basis without compromising the quality of service (QoS) for the <b>primary</b> <b>stations.</b> To accomplish this we employ a simple two-step procedure. In the first step the spectrum resources are allocated to <b>primary</b> <b>stations</b> to maximize the QoS for the primary users. In the second step the spare service capacity of the primary channels is distributed among the secondary stations to maximize the QoS of the secondary users. The proposed theoretical framework adheres closely with the LTE specification. The corresponding resource allocation algorithm does not involve additional network signaling over the wireless medium, and improves the overall QoS in the network. These advantages of the proposed approach for resource allocation make it ready for implementation in a real network...|$|R

2500|$|Marnardal Station {{was built}} during the Second World War under the German-administrated {{expansion}} of the Sørlandet Line west of Kristiansand. Instead of running along the more densely populated coast, the line was built through the interior of Vest-Agder. Marnardal Station was planned as a <b>primary</b> <b>station,</b> which was to serve the Marnardal valley and its various communities. This included the coastal town of Mandal, situated [...] to the south, {{at the mouth of}} the valley. The station was originally proposed to be named Øyslebø, the name of the municipality at the time. Instead a new name was constructed by folklorist Knut Liestøl. He took the name of the river, Mandalselva, used its genitive form marnar and added suffix dal which means [...] "valley". The name was so quickly adopted by the locals that it was used as the name of the new municipality in the municipal amalgamation that occurred in 1964.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The IEEE 1609. 4 {{standard}} {{has been}} proposed to provide multi-channel operations in wireless access for vehicular environments (WAVE), where all the channels are periodically synchronized into control and service intervals. The communication device in each vehicle will stay at the control channel for negotiation and contention during the control interval, and thereafter switch {{to one of the}} service channels for data transmission in the service interval. The inefficiency of WAVE system {{comes from the fact that}} half of the time intervals of the service channels remain idle since all the stations are performing message contention within the control channel. In this paper, the cognitive radio-enabled multi-channel access (CREM) protocol is proposed to increase the channel utilization of IEEE 1609. 4 standard. Based on the concept of cognitive radio, the vehicular stations are categorized into <b>primary</b> <b>stations</b> with safety-related messages and secondary stations with non-safety information to be delivered. Prioritized channel access is designed in the proposed CREM scheme in order to increase the transmission opportunity of <b>primary</b> <b>stations.</b> Moreover, extended time intervals are granted for <b>primary</b> <b>stations</b> to ensure reliability for data transmission. The enhanced CREM (CREM-E) protocol is proposed to further opportunistically increase the channel utilization of secondary stations. Simulation results show that the proposed CREM-E scheme outperforms the existing IEEE 1609. 4 protocol with enhanced channel utilization and smaller waiting time intervals. I...|$|R
