5|$|This high {{concentration}} and oppressive {{treatment of the}} slave population led to rebellions. In 135 BC and 104 BC, the First and Second Servile Wars, respectively, erupted in Sicily, where small bands of rebels found {{tens of thousands of}} willing followers wishing to escape the oppressive life of a Roman slave. While these were considered serious civil disturbances by the Roman Senate, taking years and direct military intervention to quell, they were never considered a serious threat to the Republic. The Roman heartland had never seen a slave uprising, nor had slaves ever been seen as a <b>potential</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> the city of Rome. This would all change with the Third Servile War.|$|E

5|$|Where {{it lives}} {{alongside}} the blue wildebeest, {{the two species}} can hybridise, and this {{is regarded as a}} <b>potential</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> the maintenance of the species. The black wildebeest was once very numerous and was present in southern Africa in vast herds {{but by the end of}} the nineteenth century, it had nearly been hunted to extinction and fewer than 600 animals remained. A small number of individuals was still present in game reserves and at zoos and it is from these that the population was rescued.|$|E
5|$|During {{the siege}} of the city by the Fourth Crusade, the sea walls {{nonetheless}} {{proved to be a}} weak point in the city's defences, as the Venetians managed to storm them. Following this experience, Michael VIII Palaiologos (r. 1259–1282) took particular care to heighten and strengthen the seaward walls immediately after the Byzantine recapture of the city in 1261, since a Latin attempt to recover the city was regarded as imminent. Furthermore, the installation of the Genoese at Galata across the Golden Horn, agreed upon in the Treaty of Nymphaeum, posed a further <b>potential</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> the city. Time being short, as a Latin attempt to recover the city was expected, the sea walls were heightened by the addition of two-meter high wooden and hide-covered screens. Ten years later, facing the threat of an invasion by Charles d'Anjou, a second line of walls was built behind the original maritime walls, although no trace of them survives today.|$|E
5|$|Though {{initially}} {{perceived to}} be a <b>potential</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> The Bahamas and Florida due to its westward motion, the hurricane curved northward on September13, mitigating any evacuation procedures. Despite the storm's change in track, the United States Weather Bureau cautioned shipping interests in the outlying islands of the Bahamas. Pan American World Airways was forced to postpone two transatlantic flights from New York City to Portugal due to the storm. After the hurricane recurved, the Weather Bureau advised caution to areas of the New England coast, particularly in Nantucket and Cape Cod, Massachusetts, where strong winds and waves were anticipated. Storm warnings were posted for coastal areas from Hatteras, North Carolina to Eastport, Maine on September16. The warnings were discontinued after the hurricane passed the warned areas.|$|E

5|$|Today, many {{wildebeest}} {{populations are}} experiencing rapid declines. Overland migration as a biological process requires large connected landscapes, which are {{increasingly difficult to}} maintain, particularly over the long term, when human demands on the landscape compete. The most acute threat comes from migration barriers, such as fences and roads. In {{one of the more}} striking examples of the consequences of fence-building on terrestrial migrations, Botswanan authorities placed thousands of kilometres of fences across the Kalahari that prevented wildebeests from reaching watering holes and grazing grounds, resulting in the deaths {{of tens of thousands of}} individuals, reducing the wildebeest population to less than 10% of its previous size. Illegal hunting is a major conservation concern in many areas, along with natural threats posed by main predators (such as lions, leopards, hunting dogs and hyenas). Where the black and blue wildebeest share a common range, the two can hybridise, and this is regarded as a <b>potential</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> the black wildebeest.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1140s the active {{phase of the}} civil war was over, barring the {{occasional}} outbreak of fighting. Many of the barons were making individual peace agreements with each other to secure their war gains and it increasingly appeared as though the English Church was considering promoting a peace treaty. On Louis VII's return from the Second Crusade in 1149, he became concerned about the growth of Geoffrey's power and the <b>potential</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> his own possessions, especially if Henry could acquire the English crown. In 1150, Geoffrey made Henry the Duke of Normandy and Louis responded by putting forward King Stephen's son Eustace as the rightful heir to the duchy and launching a military campaign to remove Henry from the province. Henry's father advised him {{to come to terms with}} Louis and peace was made between them in August 1151 after mediation by Bernard of Clairvaux. Under the settlement Henry did homage to Louis for Normandy, accepting Louis as his feudal lord, and gave him the disputed lands of the Norman Vexin; in return, Louis recognised him as duke.|$|E
5|$|In 1921 the Protocol of Corfu was annulled {{during the}} Conference of Ambassadors and Northern Epirus was {{definitively}} ceded to the Albanian state. However attempts to re-establish an autonomous Northern Epirus continued. In 1921 the Albanian government, during the country's {{entrance to the}} League of Nations, committed itself {{to protect the rights}} of minorities within its territory, which were ratified by the local Parliament next year. However, these rights were granted within a much more limited area compared to the Protocol, which included only some villages in the regions of Himara, Gjirokastër and Sarande, and none of the main towns. Moreover, Greek education was viewed as a <b>potential</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> the territorial integrity of the Albanian state and Greek schools were either closed or converted to Albanian ones. As a result of this policy, education in Greek was limited and for a time virtually eliminated (1934–1935). Only after the intervention of the Permanent Court of International Justice, in April 1935, did the Albanian side allow the reopening of Greek-language schools and waive its insistence on the use of Albanian in Greek schools.|$|E

5|$|With the {{subtropical}} ridge to its north, Isa tracked {{to the north}} and gradually curved to the west. It slowly intensified, due to it being a large tropical cyclone, and late on April 13 JTWC upgraded the storm to typhoon status; at the same time, JMA continued to assess Isa as a minimal tropical storm, and did not upgrade it to a typhoon until April 16. Isa maintained a nearly due-westward movement, although tropical cyclone prediction models anticipated a quick turn to the north. The JTWC recognized the northward model bias, which was described as under-analyzing the strength of the {{subtropical ridge}}. By April 16, the typhoon attained the equivalence of a Category3 tropical cyclone on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, and despite a <b>potential</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> Guam the typhoon remained 260km (160mi) south of the island. It gradually curved to the north, and on April 20 JTWC classified Super Typhoon Isa as reaching peak 1-min winds of 270km/h (165mph). At this point, Isa became an annular typhoon, with a large eye and a lack of spiralform rainbands, while moving nearly due northward, through a weakness in the subtropical ridge. Simultaneously, JMA assessed the typhoon as attaining peak 10-min winds of 155km/h (100mph).|$|E
5|$|After Phocas's fall, Heraclius became {{emperor of}} Byzantium. The Patriarch Nikephoros claims in his Short History that the crown was first offered to Priscus, who refused it. As {{commander}} of the excubitores, a protopatrikios (first among the patrician order) {{and one of the}} few senior and influential officials with ties to past regimes, Priscus represented a <b>potential</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> Heraclius. Nevertheless, facing a critical situation in the East, where the Persians had overrun much territory and were raiding Anatolia, Heraclius appointed Priscus in command of the Anatolian army in the autumn of 611. The Persian general Shahin captured Caesarea in Cappadocia, only to be blockaded and besieged there by Priscus. Heraclius himself decided to visit the army camp at Caesarea during winter, but Priscus refused to meet him, on the pretext of an illness. This snub alienated Heraclius from his general, and when Shahin and his army managed to break out and escape in summer, Priscus was recalled to Constantinople, ostensibly to become godfather to the Byzantine emperor's son, Heraclius Constantine. At the capital, he was removed from his post as comes excubitorum, which went to Heraclius's cousin Nicetas, while command in Anatolia went to the other surviving general of Maurice, Philippicus, brought out of retirement. Priscus was brought before the Byzantine Senate and accused by Heraclius of treason. In the end, he was tonsured as a monk on 5 December 612 and confined in the Monastery of the Chora, where he died in 613.|$|E
