5|$|FreeSpace 2 {{takes place}} entirely in outer space. The playing area is vast when {{compared}} to the small starfighters piloted by the player and the effective range they have. This space is <b>populated</b> <b>with</b> interstellar bodies such as stars, planets, asteroids, etc. The implementation of nebulae as an interactive environment {{is one of the most}} distinctive and crowning aspects of FreeSpace 2. Flying through a nebula involves impaired vision, and occasional disruptions to flight electronics. Nebulae have become known as an eerie and suspenseful arena of play.|$|E
5|$|In North America, C.violaceus favours conifers, and, though rare {{over much}} of the continent, is {{relatively}} common in certain areas, including Mount Rainier National Park and Olympic National Park. It is more common in old growth forest in the Pacific Northwest, though has sprung up in regrowth areas <b>populated</b> <b>with</b> fir, pine, aspen and alder in the Great Lakes region. Fruit bodies occur singly or in small groups, often near rotting wood, and can grow in fairy rings. Closely related species that look like C.violaceus can be found in Central and South America, Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, and Malaysia.|$|E

5|$|Karas, however, {{suffered}} the worst criticisms for its story. Many reviewers {{and even the}} voice actors could not follow its dialogue and presentation. Other reviewers felt the abstract presentation forced viewers who wanted to understand the story, to pay extreme attention to the scant details presented in the show. Reelfilm and DVD Verdict were more critical, stating the viewer {{should not have to}} resort to reading summaries on the packaging to make sense of a story <b>populated</b> <b>with</b> incoherent battles and characters hard to tell apart from.|$|E

5|$|Switzerland has a {{dense network}} of towns, where large, medium and small towns are complementary. The plateau is very densely <b>populated</b> <b>with</b> about 450 people per km2 and the {{landscape}} continually shows signs of human presence. The weight of the largest metropolitan areas, which are Zürich, Geneva–Lausanne, Basel and Bern tend to increase. In international comparison {{the importance of these}} urban areas is stronger than their number of inhabitants suggests. In addition the two main centres of Zürich and Geneva are recognised for their particularly great quality of life.|$|E
5|$|The {{restoration}} {{work was}} undertaken by Donald Insall Associates. The temple was reopened {{to the public}} in late 1998, and in early 1999 the garden was replanted to replicate its original Georgian appearance. The British Museum provided a copy of Roubiliac's statue of Shakespeare to occupy the vacant niche where the original had once stood. The temple was <b>populated</b> <b>with</b> an exhibition on Garrick's life and career, including copies of portraits by Gainsborough, Reynolds and Zoffany. The project was completed by April 1999.|$|E

5|$|There {{are four}} villages inside the Vikos–Aoös National Park, and an {{additional}} nine near {{the borders of the}} peripheral zone. All of these settlements, {{in the western part of}} the Zagori region, are sparsely <b>populated</b> <b>with</b> a total population of 1,515 people. The villages have a nucleus-like form, with the houses situated around the central square and interconnected by rocky pathways. Historically, all the villages of the Zagori region were connected by a system of paths or small roads and they functioned more like a single entity rather than as separate communities.|$|E
5|$|Aside from control interfaces, {{the bridge}} set was <b>populated</b> <b>with</b> {{monitors}} looping animations. Each oval monitor was a rear-projection screen on which super 8mm and 16mm film sequences looped for each special effect. The production acquired 42 films {{for this purpose}} from an Arlington, Virginia-based company, Stowmar Enterprises. Stowmar's footage was exhausted {{only a few weeks}} into filming, and it became clear that new monitor films would be needed faster than an outside supplier could deliver them. Cole, Minor, and another production designer, Rick Sternbach, worked together with Povill to devise faster ways of shooting new footage. Cole and Povill rented an oscilloscope for a day and filmed its distortions. Other loops came from Long Beach Hospital, the University of California at San Diego, and experimental computer labs in New Mexico. In all, over two hundred pieces of monitor footage were created and catalogued into a seven-page listing.|$|E
