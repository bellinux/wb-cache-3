40|$|The {{proliferation}} of electronic equipment that is permanently {{connected to the}} grid causes significant parasitic losses. Yet, the design of power supplies for PCs, servers, multi-function printers, etc, is governed by the cost and component specifications at the peak operating point {{as well as the}} thermal management of the power supply itself. Most power supplies have lower efficiencies at light loads than at their rated loads. If the unit spends most of its time at the light load operating point, then the energy consumption will be much higher compared to a situation where the power supply is optimized for overall energy consumption with a specified load cycle. Considering that most electronic appliances are produced in high volume, the use of power supplies that permit easy custom design makes sense from the standpoint of energy efficiency. Over the past few years, multiple topological changes and design changes that aim to improve the efficiency of the power supplies have been proposed. However, their proliferation in low cost consumer electronics has been limited primarily by their high costs, additional area overhead and incompatibility with existing <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>converter</b> topologies. As a part of this Master's thesis research work, a business case is first proposed to show that a market for low cost and high power rating electronic devices that exhibits high power efficiency exists. Then a novel yet simple, low cost device(SSSR) is proposed to improve the efficiency of existing power supplies without effecting major changes to their existing design. Our claims are backed up by simulation results and a working prototype. Finally, a ROI model is presented to showcase the effectiveness of the proposed solution in today's consumer market. M. S.

40|$|High {{conversion}} efficiency is desired in switch mode <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>converters.</b> Computer-aided design optimization {{is emerging as}} a promising way to design power converters. In this work a systematic optimization procedure is proposed to optimize LLC series resonant converter full load efficiency. A mode solver technique is proposed to handle LLC converter steady-state solutions. The mode solver utilizes numerical nonlinear programming techniques to solve LLC-state equations and determine operation mode. Loss models are provided to calculate total component losses using the current and voltage information derived from the mode solver. The calculated efficiency serves as the objective function to optimize the converter efficiency. A prototype 300 -W 400 -V to 12 -V LLC converter is built using the optimization results. Details of design variables, boundaries, equality/inequality constraints, and loss distributions are given. An experimental full-load efficiency of 97. 07 is achieved compared to a calculated 97. 4 efficiency.

50|$|A {{push-pull}} converter {{is a type}} of DC-to-DC converter, a switching converter {{that uses}} a transformer to change the voltage of a DC <b>power</b> <b>supply.</b> The distinguishing feature of a push-pull converter is that the transformer primary is supplied with current from the input line by pairs of transistors in a symmetrical push-pull circuit. The transistors are alternately switched on and off, periodically reversing the current in the transformer. Therefore current is drawn from the line during both halves of the switching cycle. This contrasts with buck-boost converters, in which the input current is supplied by a single transistor which is switched on and off, so current is only drawn from the line during half the switching cycle. During the other half the output <b>power</b> is <b>supplied</b> by energy stored in inductors or capacitors in the <b>power</b> <b>supply.</b> Push-pull <b>converters</b> have steadier input current, create less noise on the input line, and are more efficient in higher power applications.|$|R
