Some festivals which don't make use of green space were still allowed in the park. The Atlanta Arts Festival ran from September 12–14, 2008, and utilized only paved areas. Other festivals were temporarily moved to alternate venues, such as Centennial Olympic Park. The drought in Atlanta ended by late 2009. In 2010, several events returned to Piedmont Park, including the Dogwood Festival, the Jazz Festival, and Screen on the Green.|$|E

Her next outing came at the Los Angeles Marathon in March and she headed {{to the front of}} the pack, but was overtaken by Tatyana Petrova in the latter stages of the race. Still, her time of 2:26:53 for second place marked a successful transition to the longer distance. She competed extensively in the United States that summer, starting with wins at the Cooper River Bridge Run and Monument Avenue 10K. A fifth place at the <b>Peachtree</b> <b>Road</b> Race was followed up by a third-place finish at the Boilermaker Road Race. Amane ran her third marathon of the year at the Toronto Waterfront Marathon. She duelled against Mulu Seboka, another Ethiopian runner and the defending champion, in the earlier stages but then pulled away around the 40km to earn her first win over the distance, breaking the course record with a run of 2:28:30 in the process. She brought a busy year to a close with two runs in September, taking eighth at the Delhi Half Marathon before securing the runner-up position behind Koreni Jelila at the Great Ethiopian Run 10K.|$|E

2500|$|The {{area around}} Lenox has grown immensely {{in the past}} few decades {{following}} its opening, with expanding retail developments and over 75 restaurants within a mile radius, which has made the area a highly desirable location to live and work. A two-story Target store sits across from Lenox at Lenox Marketplace, connected inside via escalators and elevators designed for shopping carts as well as shoppers, and having checkouts on both levels at the exits to a parking deck. Other stores at Lenox Marketplace include Dick's Sporting Goods and Neiman Marcus Last Call (Previously the site of a Filene's Basement). [...] The Sembler Company was the developer. In addition, Phipps Plaza is located to the northeast of Lenox Square across <b>Peachtree</b> <b>Road.</b> Traffic levels around Lenox are high and the streets are confusing for those unfamiliar with the area. Georgia 400 opened in 1993, restricting traffic to and from the west after it cut many existing roads. However, the BUC (Buckhead Uptown Connection), the free shuttle bus service around Buckhead, is available, supported voluntarily by a self-taxing district (Buckhead CID) which includes Lenox, and by GRTA and other agencies. The Peachtree Streetcar initiative would also extend free or low-fare streetcars to Lenox in the north, through midtown and downtown, to a proposed mixed-use redevelopment around historic Fort McPherson, [...] south. MARTA, the city's main mass transit system, provides one station across the street from the J W Marriott, as well as the Buckhead station a quarter mile Northwest on <b>Peachtree</b> <b>Road.</b>|$|E

Tola was disqualifed from the 2009 <b>Peachtree</b> <b>Road</b> Race for elbowing competitor Boaz Cheboiywo in the final 30 metres of the race. [...] Tola was the fourth-place finisher before being disqualified. [...] Tola's agent later disputed the disqualification, saying that Tola's actions were unintentional. [...] He followed an appeal, but it was received too late for review. He defended his title at the NYC Half Marathon, finishing a minute ahead {{of the rest of the}} field. He ran in his first marathon at the 2009 Chicago Marathon, running 2:15:48 to take tenth place.|$|E
5000|$|After {{the flash}} flood {{prevention}} was removed and the Murphey Candler lake spillway was widened, the Ashford Dunwoody Road bridge downstream was damaged by a flash flood preventing passage by buses or fire trucks. A {{few years later}} in another flash flood the <b>Peachtree</b> Dunwoody <b>Road</b> bridge further downstream on Nancy Creek was washed out. A federal grant was required to repair and upgrade the Ashford Dunwoody Road bridge to withstand floods.|$|R

5000|$|The {{region where}} Atlanta and its suburbs were built was {{originally}} Creek and Cherokee Native American territory. In 1813, the Creeks, {{who had been}} recruited by the British {{to assist them in}} the War of 1812, attacked and burned Fort Mims in southwestern Alabama. The conflict broadened and became known as the Creek War. In response, the United States built a string of forts along the Ocmulgee and Chattahoochee Rivers, including Fort Daniel on top of Hog Mountain near present-day Dacula, Georgia, and Fort Gilmer. Fort Gilmer was situated next to an important Indian site called Standing Peachtree, named after a large tree which {{is believed to have been}} a pine tree (the name referred to the pitch or sap that flowed from it). The word [...] "pitch" [...] was misunderstood for [...] "peach," [...] thus the site's name. The site traditionally marked a Native American meeting place at the boundary between Creek and Cherokee lands, at the point where Peachtree Creek flows into the Chattahoochee. The fort was soon renamed Fort <b>Peachtree.</b> A <b>road</b> was built linking Fort Peachtree and Fort Daniel following the route of existing trails.|$|R

5000|$|Two holiday traditions {{associated}} with Rich's were the Great Tree and the Pink Pig.

After the closure of the downtown store in 1991, the Great Tree, and the annual Thanksgiving evening tree-lighting festivities, moved to nearby Underground Atlanta. After several years of poor attendance, the Tree was moved {{to the top of the}} Men's Store at the Lenox Square location. This placed the tree on the corner of the mall closest to the prominent intersection of <b>Peachtree</b> and Lenox <b>Roads.</b> The tree lighting ceremony traditionally features country and pop music performers from Georgia, such as Kenny Rogers, several choirs from local churches, and a rendition of [...] "O Holy Night" [...] with the tree being lit by a child during the high note of the line [...] "O night divine." ...|$|R
