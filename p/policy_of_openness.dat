25|$|Living {{standards}} were undermined during {{the tenure of}} Kahar Mahkamov as first secretary of the Communist Party of Tajikistan from 1985. Mahkamov's attempted marketisation of the Tajik economy aggravated the poor living conditions and unemployment. On {{the eve of the}} Soviet collapse Tajikistan was suffering from a declining economy and dim prospects for recovery. The glasnost <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> <b>openness</b> initiated by Mikhil Gorbachev offered disgruntled Tajiks a chance to voice their grievances. In 1991, the Soviet Union collapsed, and Tajikistan declared its independence.|$|E

25|$|A {{combination}} of incompetence and bitter infighting among the elite saw Byzantium permanently lose her financial capability and substantial military power; her previous <b>policies</b> <b>of</b> <b>openness</b> with Western Europe, {{followed by the}} sudden massacre of Latins under Andronikos, had preceded {{the rule of the}} Angeloi making enemies among Western European states. The weakening of the empire under the Angeloi dynasty invited the end of the Byzantine Empire centered at Constantinople when in 1204 soldiers of the Fourth Crusade overthrew the last Angeloi Emperor, Alexios V Doukas.|$|R

25|$|During the transition, then-C Sir Colin McColl {{embraced a}} new, albeit limited, <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> <b>openness</b> towards {{the press and}} public, with 'public affairs' falling into the brief of Director, Counter-Intelligence and Security (renamed Director, Security and Public Affairs). McColl's {{policies}} were part and parcel with a wider 'open government initiative' developed from 1993 {{by the government of}} John Major. As part of this, SIS operations, and those of the national signals intelligence agency, GCHQ, were placed on a statutory footing through the 1994 Intelligence Services Act. Although the Act provided procedures for authorisations and warrants, this essentially enshrined mechanisms that had been in place at least since 1953 (for authorisations) and 1985 (under the Interception of Communications Act, for warrants). Under this Act, since 1994, SIS and GCHQ activities have been subject to scrutiny by Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee.|$|E
25|$|In July 2008, {{local governments}} in the Sichuan Province coordinated a {{campaign}} to silence angry parents whose children died during the earthquake through monetary contracts. If the parents refused, officials threatened that they would receive nothing. Although Chinese officials have advocated a <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> <b>openness</b> in time before the Olympic Games, the pressure on parents to sign demonstrates that officials are determined to create an appearance of public harmony rather than investigate into the corruption or negligence {{of the construction of}} schools. The payment amounts vary by school but are roughly the same. In Hanwang, parents were offered a package valued at 8,800 USD in cash and a per-parent pension of nearly 5,600 USD. Many parents said they signed the contract, even if no real investigation ensues. Furthermore, officials have continued to use traditional methods of silencing: riot police officers have broken up protests by parents; the authorities have set up cordons around the schools; and officials have ordered the Chinese news media to stop reporting on school collapses.|$|E
2500|$|Sibel Siber, {{who would}} have been the first ever woman President of Northern Cyprus if elected, stated on 23 February that, if elected, she would ensure the recommencement of the {{negotiations}} to solve the Cyprus dispute. She promised that [...] "working desks" [...] would be formed in the presidency to solve the problems in the Turkish Cypriot community, and that she saw the president as a figure who must be actively involved in communal affairs. She referred to her previous term as the prime minister, claiming that she would pursue the same <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> <b>openness,</b> transparency and trust that she did during her term as prime minister.|$|E
25|$|Gorbachev {{initiated}} a <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> glasnost (<b>openness)</b> in the Soviet Union, and {{emphasized the need}} for perestroika (economic restructuring).

The Czechoslovak Communist leadership verbally supported Perestroika, but made few changes. Speaking about the Prague Spring of 1968 was taboo. The first anti-government demonstrations occurred in 1988 (the Candle Demonstration, for example) and 1989, {{but these were}} dispersed and participants were repressed by the police.|$|R

40|$|Our conference track invited STS {{scholars}} to explore Open Science from an STS perspective {{and to discuss}} what STS can bring into the broader discussion. Open science is broadly defined as science that is transparent, accountable, and shareable, involving the participation of (all) relevant stakeholders in the scientific process. With this report {{we would like to}} highlight several discussion points of the broad spectrum from normative imaginaries <b>of</b> <b>openness</b> to undogmatic open practices. Therefore, while the emphasis of our remarks is on the diversity <b>of</b> enactments <b>of</b> <b>openness,</b> we can only present four snapshots of our track: co-production of knowledge in participatory settings, open data practices, scientific ethos and trust, and <b>policy</b> imaginaries <b>of</b> <b>openness</b> in research and innovation...|$|R

50|$|After {{the death}} of Stalin in 1953, the Soviet Union's foreign policy was less hostile. The new Soviet Prime Minister, Vyacheslav Molotov, {{presented}} a new <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> <b>openness</b> and peacefulness. This new policy inspired Israel to initiate relations with the USSR again, on condition that Israel would no longer criticize the USSR publicly, especially regarding the Soviet Jews.

40|$|My {{concern here}} {{is with the}} {{enclosure}} and delimitation of a politics of communication within and across the knowledge and creative sectors. I show how this enclosure is enacted by reform agendas and specifically by the alignment of copyright and access reform in the UK. While policy on copyright and access implements neoliberal values {{by means of the}} apparently valueless a-politics <b>of</b> <b>openness,</b> I explore the possibilities of re-politicisation - of opening out from openness - through publishing projects that (re) enact specifically feminist agendas and investments in, for example, care, ethics, agency, responsibility, experimentation and intervention. A feminist politics of communication does not (could not) posit radicalism in opposition to neoliberalism but does constitute a relation of antagonism (Mouffe) within a nexus of trouble understood here as the configuration of writing, publishing, privatisation and marketisation. To the extent that this nexus of trouble is already troubled (and not least by crisis models in publishing, the humanities and academia generally), the specific and strategic question of writing itself is, I suggest, currently underexplored. The question of writing brings philosophy to bear on <b>policies</b> <b>of</b> <b>openness</b> but, I argue, in an environment of increasingly proprietorial knowledge and of creativity as market competition, the key question (to ask) of writing is not the metaphysical one (what is writing?) but rather the more provisional question: why write...|$|R
25|$|The {{recession}} {{economy of}} {{the late twentieth century}} began to take shape. In addition to the war on drugs, were added the atomization of city resources, the lack of continuity in the development plans of the next government, and the lack of human and fiscal resources needed to implement the mayor plans. All this created a climate of mistrust among the population, industry and regional government. In this environment, the <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> economic <b>openness</b> government by Colombian President Gaviria caught the city poorly prepared.|$|R
50|$|Having {{initiated}} a <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> glasnost (<b>openness)</b> and {{emphasized the need}} for perestroika (economic restructuring), Gorbachev essentially permitted the six member states of the Warsaw Pact to now each take their own direction with their own reforms. While those reforms implemented the Soviet Union were met with broad approval by the peoples across the other Eastern Bloc nations - in particular amongst students and academics - the respective governments of the region reacted at first with reserve and later, in part, with rejection of the reforms.|$|R

[...] In 1993, he formed the Forum of Democratic Forces as an attempt to unite parties opposed to Karimov's rule. It was unsuccessful. Mirsaidov created a new party, Adolat (Justice) in December 1994, calling for liberal economic reforms, political pluralism and secularism.|$|E

2500|$|Following {{a period}} of {{economic}} and political stagnation under Brezhnev and his immediate successors, the Soviet Union decreased its intervention in Eastern Bloc politics. Mikhail Gorbachev (General Secretary from 1985) decreased adherence to the Brezhnev Doctrine, which held that if socialism were threatened in any state then other socialist governments had an obligation to intervene to preserve it, in favor of the [...] "Sinatra Doctrine". He also initiated the <b>policies</b> <b>of</b> glasnost (<b>openness)</b> and perestroika (economic restructuring). A wave of Revolutions occurred throughout the Eastern Bloc in 1989.|$|R
30|$|This section {{focused on}} the pitfalls of refugee data through the lenses of {{political}} geography. In a world system of refugees, the industrialized core states as principals use the UNHCR as their agent to rationalize and manipulate refugee preferences. Those states that are the most open to refugees also contribute the largest funds, like the Northern European States, the USA, and Germany. Most refugees are internally displaced people. There are interdependencies between Europe and Asia regarding refugee choices and policies, however, they {{do not seem to}} be very strong. It is rather improbable, for instance, that as many Syrians would flee to Japan when Japan had the same <b>policies</b> <b>of</b> <b>openness</b> in place like Germany. This is because most refugees tend to stay in their region or find refuge geographically closed to them. Yet, there is growing awareness internationally about how much contributions individual countries make to work on the refugee crisis. East Asian countries only make marginal contributions, while they strongly benefit efforts of other countries, not least the Southeast Asian countries that have to deal with a large influx of refugees. The next sections deal with the legal foundations of a global refugee policy in the two regions. It focuses largely on international law and on regional regimes.|$|R
50|$|Basharov's {{reaction}} was rather blunt and caused {{a wave of}} protest among the young artists. They openly resented {{the fact that it}} was not possible for young artists to display paintings without censorship; their work was evaluated with prejudice and any creativity caused a backlash. In fact, during Gorbachev's perestroika, many thought that it was safe to voice criticism. In Uzbekistan, however, this <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> <b>openness</b> proved to be an illusion. In short, there was always a way to restrain active citizens and to drive them out of the country.|$|E

He said that giraffes at the zoo breed very well and where this was the case, giraffes had to be selected to ensure the best genes were passed down to ensure the animals' long-term survival. He confirmed the zoo typically culls 20 to 30 animals every year, mostly antelopes, llamas and goats.|$|E

This, however, led to the rise of strong nationalist and separatist movements. Prior to 1991, the Soviet economy was the second largest in the world, but during its last years it was afflicted by shortages of goods in grocery stores, huge budget deficits, and explosive growth in the money supply leading to inflation.|$|R
