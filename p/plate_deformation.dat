50|$|Orogenic uplift is {{the result}} of tectonic-plate {{collisions}} and results in mountain ranges or a more modest uplift over a large region. Perhaps the most extreme form of orogenic uplift is a continental-continental crustal collision. In this process, two continents are sutured together and large mountain ranges are produced. The collision of the Indian and Eurasian plates {{is a good example of}} the extent to which orogenic uplift can reach. Heavy thrust faulting (of the Indian plate beneath the Eurasian plate) and folding are responsible for the suturing together of the two plates. The collision of the Indian and Eurasian plates not only produced the Himalaya, but is also responsible for crustal thickening north into Siberia. The Pamir Mountains, Tian Shan, Altai, Hindu Kush, and other mountain belts are all examples of mountain ranges formed in response to the collision of the Indian with the Eurasian <b>plate.</b> <b>Deformation</b> of continental lithosphere can take place in several possible modes.|$|E
40|$|The {{lithosphere}} deforms under applied forces, {{the style}} and rate of deformation depends on its rheology. Geodynamics are greatly simplified within the frame of plate tectonics, because the rheology {{of the outer shell}} of the Earth is assumed to be that of rigid <b>plates.</b> Thus <b>deformation</b> is expected to concentrate within razor-thin plate boundaries, associated with three basic types of relative plate motion: convergence, divergence, and slip on transform faults. Although the plate tectonics theory is remarkably successful in explaining geological observations in most part of the world, the broad crustal deformation in the western North America, the Andes, and the Himalayan-Tibetan plateau accentuates the significance of diffuse <b>plate</b> boundary <b>deformation.</b> Attempts of understanding the geodynamics of diffuse <b>plate</b> boundary <b>deformation</b> {{in the past few decades}} have propelled modern geoscience to advance from the kinematic plate tectonics theory towards a more integrated understanding of the dynamics of the Earth system [Molnar, 1988]. Continued studies are made more imperative by the fact that these diffuse plate boundaries are prone to geological hazards, whereas human densely populates many parts of these boundaries. We know in general that the diffuse <b>plate</b> boundary <b>deformation</b> is the results of the relatively weak continents. However, we know little about the rheology of continents, which varies in space and with timescales.

5000|$|Flat slabs {{are thought}} to result in zones of broad, diffuse {{deformation}} in the upper plate located far landward from the trench. Flat slab subduction is associated with basement-cored uplifts also known as [...] "thick-skinned" [...] deformation of the overriding plate like the Sierra Pampeanas in South America possibly associated with the subduction of the Juan Fernandéz Ridge. These areas of basement-cored uplifts are visually correlated with flat slab subduction zones. In contrast, [...] "thin-skinned" [...] deformation is the normal mode of upper <b>plate</b> <b>deformation,</b> and does not involve basement rock. Crustal shortening is observed to extend farther inland than in normally dipping subduction zones; the Sierra Pampeanas are over 650 km east of the trench axis. [...] Flat slabs {{have been used as}} an explanation for the Laramide Orogeny and the central Altiplano-Puna region. Another interesting feature that may be associated with the flat slab subduction of the Nazca Ridge is the Fitzcarrald arch located in the Amazonian Basin. The Fitzcarrald arch is a long-wavelength, linear topographic feature extending from eastern Peru to western Brazil beyond the Subandean thrust front into an undeformed area and rising ~600 masl. The Fitzcarrald arch has the effect of splitting the Amazonian Basin into three subbasins: northern Amazonian foreland basin, southern Amazonian foreland basin, and the eastern Amazonian foreland basin.|$|E

40|$|Subduction zones on Earth, {{and their}} {{associated}} trenches and hinges, migrate {{with respect to}} the overriding plate, as indicated by overriding <b>plate</b> <b>deformation</b> (e. g. backarc extension or backarc shortening), and migrate with respect to hotspot and no-net-rotation reference frames (global or "absolute" reference frames). Three geodynamic models exist that attempt to explain how "absolute" trench migration velocity correlates with overriding <b>plate</b> <b>deformation.</b> In one model, trench and hinge migration result from lateral migration of the slab, with trench retreat causing overriding plate extension, and trench advance causing overriding plate shortening. In the second model, trench migration is forced by the overriding plate, with trenchward motion causing trench retreat and overriding plate shortening, and motion away from the trench causing trench advance and overriding plate extension. In the third model, the trench and subduction hinge are thought to be static, while overriding plate extension/shortening is accommodated by landward/trenchward overriding plate motion. In this paper, the conflicting geodynamic predictions made by these three models are tested by using global kinematic calculations of trench migration velocity (vT ⊥), overriding plate velocity (vOP ⊥) and overriding <b>plate</b> <b>deformation</b> in different global reference frames. The dependence between vT ⊥ and overriding <b>plate</b> <b>deformation,</b> as well as vOP ⊥ and overriding <b>plate</b> <b>deformation</b> was investigated. Correlation coefficients (R) and confidence limits were calculated using a quantitative approach with overriding <b>plate</b> <b>deformation</b> velocity (vOPD ⊥), using a semi-quantitative approach with an overriding plate strain-classification approach, and using a Spearman rank correlation approach. For the quantitative approach the correlation between vT ⊥ and vOPD ⊥ is consistently positive (R = 0. 33 - 0. 68), where trench retreat corresponds to extension, and statistically significant at 95 % confidence level for all but one reference frame. For vOP ⊥ and vOPD ⊥ the correlation is consistently negative but much less significant (R = - 0. 29 to - 0. 17) and statistically not significant at 95 % confidence level for all reference frames. These findings indicate that trench migration results predominantly from lateral migration of the slab rather than from overriding plate motion. Such lateral slab migration is most likely driven by the negative buoyancy force of the slab itself, as demonstrated by geodynamic models...|$|E

40|$|A {{method is}} {{developed}} for the 3 D analysis of laminated <b>plate</b> <b>deformation</b> which {{is an extension of}} a variational-asymptotical method by Atilgan and Hodges (1991). Both methods are based on the treatment of <b>plate</b> <b>deformation</b> by splitting the 3 D analysis into linear through-the-thickness analysis and 2 D plate analysis. Whereas the first technique tackles transverse shear deformation in the second asymptotical approximation, the present method simplifies its treatment and restricts it to the first approximation. Both analytical techniques are applied to the linear cylindrical bending problem, and the strain and stress distributions are derived and compared with those of the exact solution. The present theory provides more accurate results than those of the classical laminated-plate theory for the transverse displacement of 2 -, 3 -, and 4 -layer cross-ply laminated plates.

40|$|Mountain {{building}} above subduction zones, such as {{observed in}} the Andes, is enigmatic, and the key parameter controlling the underlying dynamics remains a matter of considerable debate. A global survey of subduction zones is presented here, illustrating the correlation between overriding <b>plate</b> <b>deformation</b> rate and twelve physical parameters: overriding plate velocity, subducting plate velocity, trench velocity, convergence velocity, subduction velocity, subduction zone accretion rate, subducting plate age, subduction polarity, shallow slab dip, deep slab dip, lateral slab edge proximity, and subducting ridge proximity. All correlation coefficients are low (R ≤ 0. 39), irrespective of the global reference frame, relative plate motion model, or overriding <b>plate</b> <b>deformation</b> model, except for the trench velocity (0. 33 - 0. 68, exact value depends on adopted global reference frame) and subduction velocity, which shows an anticorrelation (0. 55 - 0. 57). This implies that no individual parameter can explain overriding <b>plate</b> <b>deformation,</b> except that trench retreat generally corresponds to extension while an approximately stable trench or trench advance generally corresponds to shortening. Understanding {{of the variety of}} strain patterns is obtained when slab edge proximity and overriding plate velocity are combined. Orogenesis occurs in overriding plates bordering central regions of wide subduction zones (≥∼ 4000 km) when the overriding plate is moving trenchward at 0 - 2 cm/yr (e. g., Andes, Japan). Because the center of a wide slab offers large resistance to lateral migration, the overriding plate effectively collides with the subduction hinge, forcing the slab to attain a shallow dip angle (e. g., Nazca and Japan slabs). Overriding plate extension is only found close to lateral slab edges or during overriding plate motion away from the center of a wide subduction zone, but in the latter scenario, maximum extension velocities are much lower than in the former scenario. For subduction settings close to lateral slab edges, overriding plate motion plays no significant role in overriding <b>plate</b> <b>deformation.</b> Thus, for rapid overriding plate extension, the key ingredient is rapid trench retreat, which only occurs close to lateral slab edges, while for overriding plate shortening, the key ingredients are (1) the resistance to rapid trench and hinge retreat, which occurs far from lateral slab edges, and (2) trenchward overriding plate motion...|$|E
40|$|The {{deformation}} of a plate due to boundary stresses is investigated using both the elastic and viscous models for <b>plate</b> <b>deformation.</b> The role of basal shear stress (at the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary), oblique convergence and strength inhomogeneity are investigated for modifying <b>plate</b> <b>deformation,</b> subjected to lateral stresses, using Beam Deflection Theory and Finite Element analysis. The results {{are applied to}} two different geological problems. First is the post-rift {{deformation of}} the Midcontinent Rift System (MCR) under the stresses from the Grenville Tectonic Zone, and second is the asymmetric distribution of deformation along the Indian-Eurasian collision boundary. ^ The role of basal shear on intraplate deformation is studied using a discretized form of the equation resulting from elastic beam theory. The results indicate insignificant effect of basal shear on <b>plate</b> <b>deformation</b> when subjected to lateral boundary stresses. It is further concluded that tectonic stresses from the Grenville Tectonic Zone contributed to the post-rift evolution of the MCR. This conclusion is also supported by the 2 D, finite-element, viscous model which showed that stresses from the Grenville Tectonic Zone could be responsible for producing laterally varying deformation along the axis of the MCR. ^ The influence of a strength inhomogeneity on deformation of a plate is investigated using the 2 D, finite-element, viscous model. A high-strength anomalous zone extends the zone of deformation by acting as a secondary indenter. A low-strength anomalous zone confines deformation between the low-strength zone and the collision boundary. Without the low-strength zone, the region of deformation extends farther from the collision zone. The 2 D viscous model also is used to investigate the effect of oblique convergence on <b>plate</b> <b>deformation.</b> It is observed that laterally varying velocity, both magnitude and obliquity angle, along the collision boundary is a better choice for boundary condition than the average velocity, both magnitude and obliquity angle. The 2 D viscous modeling of the India-Eurasia collision boundary indicates that laterally varying velocity boundary condition accounts for {{a small percentage of}} the asymmetry in topography along this boundary. Most of the asymmetry is due to the presence of high-strength Tarim basin. ...|$|E

Herein I build upon the mantle flow model results of Conrad and Behn (2010) and compute the drag forces underneath all plates, {{and show that}} they control the dynamics of plates and plate boundaries. The small misfit angle between between the traction azimuths of mantle traction and absolute plate motion corroborates the idea that convective mantle drag is a prominent driver of plate tectonics. Less intuitive {{is the fact that}} the interplay between the drag forces from the upper and lower plates, that amounts to - 5 to 8. 5 TN/m (per unit trench length), dictates both trench migration rates and upper <b>plate</b> <b>deformation.</b> At odds with the classic view that assigns the prime role to the idiosyncrasies of subduction zones (slab age, interplate friction, water content etc), I find that the intrinsic properties of subduction zones in fact only modulate this behavior. More specifically, the mean value of the integrated trenchward mantle drag force from the lower and upper plates (from - 2 to 6. 5 TN/m) controls upper <b>plate</b> <b>deformation.</b> Conversely, it is the difference between the lower and upper plates mantle drag forces (from - 3 to 10 TN/m) that controls trench migration rates. In addition, I find that a minimum trenchward force of ~ 2. 5 TN/m must be supplied by mantle drag before trenches can actually advance, and before upper plates undergo compression. This force results from the default tendency of slabs to rollback when solely excited by their own buoyancy, and is thus the effective tensional force that slab pull exerts on the plate interface...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} the linear stability of two inviscid fluids, {{in the presence}} of gravity, sheared past each other and separated by an flexible plate.

This Kelvin-Helmholtz instability is then analysed {{in the presence of}} plates with spatially periodic (with period $a$) flexural rigidity arising from, for example, a periodic material variation. The eigenvalues of this periodic system are computed using Bloch's Theorem (Floquet Theory) that imposes specific Fourier decompositions of the velocity potential and <b>plate</b> <b>deformations.</b> We derive the nonhermitian matrix whose eigenvalues determine the dispersion relation. Our dispersion relation shows that plate periodicity generally destabilises the flow, compared to a uniform plate with the same mean flexural rigidity. However, enhanced destabilisation and stabilization can occur for disturbances with wavelengths near an even multiple of the plate periodicity. The sensitivity of flows with such wavelengths arises from the nonpropagating, ``Bragg reflected'' modes coupled to the plate periodicity through the boundary condition at the plate.
