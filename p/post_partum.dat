25|$|A {{risk score}} of four points or higher means {{prophylaxis}} in the ante partum period is needed, {{as well as}} at least six weeks <b>post</b> <b>partum.</b> A previous distal DVT indicates a minimum of 12 weeks (three months) of therapeutic anticoagulation therapy. A previous proximal DVT or pulmonary embolism requires a minimum of 26 weeks (6.5 months) of therapy If the therapy duration reaches delivery time, the remaining duration may be given after delivery, possibly extending the minimum of six weeks of <b>post</b> <b>partum</b> therapy. In a very high risk, high-dose ante partum prophylaxis should be continued at least 12 weeks after delivery.|$|E

25|$|Hypercoagulability in {{pregnancy}} is the propensity {{of pregnant women}} to develop thrombosis (blood clots). Pregnancy itself is a factor of hypercoagulability (pregnancy-induced hypercoagulability), as a physiologically adaptive mechanism to prevent <b>post</b> <b>partum</b> bleeding. However, in combination with an underlying hypercoagulable states, the risk of thrombosis or embolism may become substantial.|$|E
25|$|After adding {{any risk}} factors together, {{a total of}} one point or less {{indicates}} no preventive action is needed. A total of two points indicates short-term prophylaxis, e.g. with LMWH, {{may be used in}} temporary risk factors, as well as administering prophylactic treatment seven days postpartum, starting a couple of hours after birth. A total of 3 points increases the necessary duration of <b>post</b> <b>partum</b> prophylaxis to six weeks.|$|E
25|$|Pregnancy-induced {{hypercoagulability}} {{is probably}} a physiologically adaptive mechanism to prevent <b>post</b> <b>partum</b> hemorrhage. Pregnancy changes the plasma levels of many clotting factors, such as fibrinogen, which can rise up to three times its normal value. Thrombin levels increase. Protein S, an anticoagulant, decreases. However, the other major anticoagulants, protein C and antithrombin III, remain constant. Fibrinolysis is impaired {{by an increase in}} plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1 or PAI) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-2 (PAI-2), the latter synthesized from the placenta. Venous stasis may occur {{at the end of the}} first trimester, due to enhanced compliance of the vessel walls by a hormonal effect.|$|E
25|$|Misoprostol is {{also used}} to prevent and treat post-partum bleeding. Orally {{administered}} misoprostol was marginally less effective than oxytocin. The use of rectally administered misoprostol is optimal in cases of bleeding; it was shown to be associated with lower rates of side effects compared to other routes. Rectally administered misoprostol was reported in a variety of case reports and randomised controlled trials. However, it is inexpensive and thermostable (thus does not require refrigeration like oxytocin), making it a cost-effective and valuable drug to use in the developing world. A randomised control trial of misoprostol use found a 38% reduction in maternal deaths due to <b>post</b> <b>partum</b> haemorrhage in resource-poor communities. Misoprostol is recommended due to its cost, effectiveness, stability, and low rate of side effects. Oxytocin must also be given by injection, while misprostol can be given orally or rectally for this use, making it much more useful in areas where nurses and physicians are less available.|$|E
25|$|Chloe Lane {{returns to}} Salem. She had {{previously}} {{given birth to}} a son, whom she had named Parker Jonas. The supposed truth came out at Parker's baptism in front of family and friends that Philip Kiriakis was Parker's father, leading {{to the end of the}} marriage between Chloe and Daniel. Having lost him, Chloe sank into a state of <b>post</b> <b>partum</b> depression and tried to commit suicide. Upon returning to Salem in January 2013, Chloe attempts to reestablish her relationship with Daniel, revealing to Daniel that Parker really is his son and that the earlier supposed DNA test results had been fake. Hoping she could get Daniel back, Chloe blackmails Jennifer into rejecting Daniel by threatening to keep Daniel from seeing Parker. Chloe goes so far as to have her mother Nancy prepare to take Parker to Brazil without telling Daniel, so Jennifer felt she had to publicly reject Daniel and leave the hospital to protect Daniel from losing access to his son while never revealing her true feelings.|$|E

50|$|The {{diagnosis}} {{is based on}} clinical presentation, quantitative HCG, ultrasound, and pathologic evaluation. A solid, heterogeneous, echogenic mass has a positive predictive value of 80%, but is present in {{only a minority of}} cases. A thickened endometrium of > 10 mm is usually considered abnormal, though no consensus exists on the appropriate cutoff. A cut-off of 8 mm or more has 34% positive rate, while a cut off of 14 mm or more has 85% sensitivity, 64% specificity for the diagnosis. Color Doppler flow in the endometrial canal can increased confidence in the diagnosis, though its absence does not exclude it, as 40% of cases of retained products have little or no flow. The differential in suspected cases includes uterine atony, blood clot, gestational trophoblastic disease, and normal <b>post</b> <b>partum</b> appearance of the uterus. <b>Post</b> <b>partum</b> blood clot is more common, reported in up to 24% of postpartum patients, and tends to be more hypoechoic than retained products with absent color flow on Doppler, and resolving spontaneously on follow up scans. The presence of gas raises the possibility of <b>post</b> <b>partum</b> endometritis, though this can also be seen in up to 21% of normal post pregnancy states. The normal <b>post</b> <b>partum</b> uterus is usually less than 2 cm in thickness, and continues to involute on follow up scans to 7 mm or less over time. Retained products are not uncommon, occurring in approximately 1% of all pregnancies, though it more common following abortions, either elective or spontaneous. There is significant overlap between appearance of a normal <b>post</b> <b>partum</b> uterus and retained products. If there is no endometrial canal mass or fluid, and endometrial thickness is less than 10 mm and without increased flow, retained products are statistically unlikely.|$|E

50|$|The round-tailed muskrat is a semiaquatic and nocturnal species {{native to}} the southeastern United States. Limited sexual {{dimorphism}} is seen among round-tailed muskrats, with female adults weighing an average of 262 grams and male adults measuring at a slightly heavier average of 279 grams. The round-tailed muskrat feeds on emergent aquatic grasses, including aquatic plant stems, seeds, and roots, to sustain its herbivorous lifestyle. The most prominent predators of the round-tailed muskrat are marsh hawks and barn owls, but most predation occurred when the round-tailed muskrats were found outside their normal territory, having been displaced by floods. The pelage of a newborn round-tailed muskrat varies from gray to ash-gray. Adults have a brown pelage with pale fur on the belly. This change in coat color {{is the result of}} a juvenile molt (between 7 and 30 days <b>post</b> <b>partum)</b> and a subadult molt (between 35 and 50 days <b>post</b> <b>partum).</b> Molting in round-tailed muskrats has been observed throughout the year, but is more prevalent during the autumn.|$|E
