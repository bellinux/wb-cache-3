25|$|Protective relays {{can also}} be {{classified}} {{by the type of}} measurement they make. A <b>protective</b> <b>relay</b> may respond to the magnitude of a quantity such as voltage or current. Induction relays can respond to the product of two quantities in two field coils, which could for example represent the power in a circuit.|$|E
25|$|Electrical power {{transmission}} networks are protected {{and controlled by}} high-voltage breakers. The definition of high voltage varies but in {{power transmission}} work is usually thought to be 72.5kV or higher, {{according to a recent}} definition by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). High-voltage breakers are nearly always solenoid-operated, with current sensing protective relays operated through current transformers. In substations the <b>protective</b> <b>relay</b> scheme can be complex, protecting equipment and buses from various types of overload or ground/earth fault.|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- This paper mainly {{discusses}} {{the development of}} <b>protective</b> <b>relaying</b> equipment in substations. As electronics and computer technologies progress, more original electromechanical relays (EMRs) in substations are being replaced by advanced semiconductor-based relays, say, solid-state relays (SSRs), and some microprocessor-based automatic <b>protective</b> <b>relaying</b> equipment, {{so that there is}} a remarkable increase in the degree of substation automation than before. In addition, to deal with the increasingly complex grid, programmable logic controllers (PLCs) are widely used as a type of <b>protective</b> <b>relaying</b> equipment in the substation automation due to their high flexibility and reliability.

25|$|Digital {{protective}} relays {{were in their}} infancy during the late 1960s. An experimental digital protection system was tested in the lab and {{in the field in}} the early 1970s. Unlike the relays mentioned above, digital {{protective relays}} have two main parts: hardware and software. The world's first commercially available digital <b>protective</b> <b>relay</b> was introduced to the power industry in 1984. In spite of the developments of complex algorithms for implementing protection functions the microprocessor based-relays marketed in the 1980s did not incorporate them.|$|E
25|$|The {{circuit breaker}} must firstly detect a fault condition. In small mains and low voltage circuit breakers, {{this is usually}} done within the device itself. Typically, the heating and/or {{magnetic}} effects of electric current are employed. Circuit breakers for large currents or high voltages are usually arranged with <b>protective</b> <b>relay</b> pilot devices to sense a fault condition and to operate the opening mechanism. These typically require a separate power source, such as a battery, although some high-voltage circuit breakers are self-contained with current transformers, protective relays, and an internal control power source.|$|E
2500|$|In {{electrical}} engineering, a <b>protective</b> <b>relay</b> is a {{relay device}} designed to trip {{a circuit breaker}} when a fault is detected. The first protective relays were electromagnetic devices, relying on coils operating on moving parts to provide detection of abnormal operating conditions such as over-current, over-voltage, reverse power flow, over-frequency, and under-frequency.|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{some models}} have been {{proposed}} for the fault section estimation and state identification of unobserved <b>protective</b> <b>relays</b> (FSE-SIUPR) under the condition of incomplete state information of <b>protective</b> <b>relays.</b> In these models, the temporal alarm information from a faulted power system is not well explored although it is very helpful in compensating the incomplete state information of <b>protective</b> <b>relays,</b> quickly achieving definite fault diagnosis results and evaluating the operating status of <b>protective</b> <b>relays</b> and circuit breakers in complicated fault scenarios. In order to solve this problem, an integrated optimization mathematical model for the FSE-SIUPR, which takes {{full advantage of the}} temporal characteristics of alarm messages, is developed in the framework of the well-established temporal constraint network. With this model, the fault evolution procedure can be explained and some states of unobserved <b>protective</b> <b>relays</b> identified. The model is then solved by means of the Tabu search (TS) and finally verified by test results of fault scenarios in a practical power system. ...|$|R

50|$|Arcing {{time can}} {{significantly}} {{be reduced by}} protection based on detection of arc-flash light. Optical detection is often combined with overcurrent information. Light and current based protection {{can be set up}} with dedicated arc-flash <b>protective</b> <b>relays,</b> or by using normal <b>protective</b> <b>relays</b> equipped with an add-on arc-flash option.|$|R
2500|$|An {{overcurrent}} relay {{is a type}} of <b>protective</b> <b>relay</b> which operates when the load current exceeds a pickup value. The ANSI device number is 50 for an instantaneous over current (IOC) or a Definite Time Overcurrent (DTOC). In a typical application the over current relay is connected to a current transformer and calibrated to operate at or above a specific current level. When the relay operates, one or more contacts will operate and energize to trip (open) a circuit breaker. The Definite Time Overcurrent Relay has been used extensively in the United Kingdom but its inherent issue of operating slower for faults closer to the source {{led to the development of}} the IDMT relay.|$|E
