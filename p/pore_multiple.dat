40|$|The {{production}} of microbubbles is rapidly becoming of considerable global importance with many industries {{taking advantage of}} the increased mass transfer rates the bubbles can attain. Many factors have interrelated roles during bubble formation, with effects such as gas flow rate, liquid viscosity, pore size and pore orientation all imparting considerable influence during the formation process. Many of these features have been examined in detail and are relatively well understood. However, the role of surface wettability and the interactions at the gas-liquid-solid triple interface have for the most part been neglected, and it is the role of this wettability that is examined herein. 	Utilising the well-studied wet chemistry surface modification techniques of silanes and thiols, many substrates have been modified and the wettability tested. Contact angle goniometry has been utilised to assess the wetting characteristics of each substrate, and the role of surface roughness has been discussed in relation to both the static Young’s contact angle and the advancing and receding angles. 	Modified porous plates have been used to generate bubbles, with controlled single <b>pore,</b> <b>multiple</b> controlled pore, and multiple randomised pore systems being investigated. A steady flow of air was bubbled into distilled water through the various diffuser plates. It has been observed a contact angle of 90 ° is of vital importance, with a significant increase of bubble size above the 90 ° angle, defined as the hydrophobic wetting region. On the contrary, bubble size is greatly reduced below this angle, in the region defined as the hydrophilic region. The effect is seen to increase as the density of pores increases when the plate from which they are emitted is relatively smooth. Upon roughening, the effect is seen to diminish, and mechanisms for this process have been postulated. It is thought that the surface topography disrupts the modifying layers and also physically restricts the growing bubble, preventing the growth of the bubbles emitted from a hydrophobic surface. Attempts have been made to support this hypothesis both qualitatively and quantitatively. 	The fluidic oscillator of Zimmerman and Tesar has been examined, with numerous physical features being investigated. The oscillator was then added to the system to investigate the effect of wettability under substantial oscillation. It has been shown that the bubble size emitted from hydrophobic surfaces is significantly reduced when compared to the steady flow system. The effect is believed to be due to the ‘suction’ component of the oscillatory flow created by the oscillator. It has been seen via high speed photography that the growth rate of the growing bubble slows significantly as the flow begins to switch, before a reduction in size is seen as the gas is removed from the bubble. The opposing forces of buoyancy and suction act to elongate the bubble neck causing break off at a significantly reduced size. Although the diffuser plate is often observed to oscillate like the skin of a drum, this is not the predominant cause of the size reduction. Further experiments have been conducted using a synthetic actuator jet to create a pulsed air flow with only a positive component. Bubble size is not affected in this case, despite frequency sweeps being employed. ...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2016 Respiratory infections {{caused by}} nontuberculous {{mycobacteria}} (NTM), especially Mycobacterium avium, {{can lead to}} progressive, recurrent disease that is refractory to therapy. Bacterial biofilms are intrinsically resistant {{to a variety of}} stressors and pressures, including host killing mechanisms and antibiotic therapy. Though it is becoming increasingly evident that NTM biofilms are important for infection, it is not currently known how these biofilms evade the immune response in an immunocompetent individual. Furthermore, what distinguishes biofilm-associated bacteria from planktonic bacteria is also mostly unknown. The main goals of this dissertation were to investigate the interaction between the host and the NTM biofilm, as well as to further identify and characterize the biofilm itself. In Chapter 2, I developed an in vitro model to investigate the interaction between an established MAH biofilm and surveilling macrophages, mimicking a scenario of how these cells would encounter NTM in the airway. Using this model, I was able to assess multiple aspects of this interaction including bacterial killing, activation of macrophages, and apoptosis. My results show the biofilm eliciting a unique hyper-stimulation from the macrophages that results in attenuation of bacterial killing and early, atypical TNFα-driven apoptosis. Interestingly, UV-killed biofilms elicited similar responses from macrophages, suggesting that acellular biofilm matrix components could be contributing to this unique response. In Chapter 3, I discovered that M. avium and other NTM can contain substantial amounts of extracellular DNA (eDNA) in their biofilm matrix and supernatant. Utilizing scanning electron microscopy and immuno-gold labelling, I was able to visualize the eDNA in these biofilms, yielding insight into the structural scaffolding-like properties the eDNA possesses. I determined that the eDNA was genomic in origin, and did not contain a specific exported sequence. By using DNA targeted enzymatic digestion with DNase I, I showed that eDNA is integral for biofilm establishment, persistence, and tolerance to clinically used antibiotics. The work in Chapter 3 led me to hypothesize that eDNA is potentially secreted by active mechanisms, which contrasts the widely accepted idea that eDNA in bacterial biofilms results from cell autolysis. In Chapter 4, I conducted an in-depth analysis into the regulation and production of eDNA. I designed a model for fluorescently quantifying eDNA export in real time in undisturbed biofilms, which allowed investigation into triggers responsible for eDNA. When these results were combined with biofilm surface proteomics and a comprehensive transposon library screen for eDNA deficient mutants, my data suggests bicarbonate as a novel trigger for eDNA and identified many genes involved with the mechanism of eDNA export. Interesting components include an undescribed FtsK/SpoIIIE-like DNA exporting <b>pore,</b> <b>multiple</b> bicarbonate-interacting carbonic anhydrases, and a unique genomic region in MAH and other eDNA-producing NTM that could be implicated in biofilm formation and eDNA production. Cumulatively, the work presented in this dissertation significantly advances the information known about NTM biofilms, and how they interact with and persist in the host respiratory tract. Current therapies can be ineffective at treating NTM respiratory infections, even after very long, multidrug treatment regimens. Since there is evidence to be implicated between NTM biofilms and respiratory infection, the more we can learn about the physiology of these biofilms, the more targets we can have to direct new anti-virulence therapies toward. Both bicarbonate sensing and eDNA production could become valuable anti-virulence targets for NTM infection...|$|E
40|$|The {{integumentary}} glandular {{system of}} Claviger testaceus {{is made up}} of glandular units which are isolated from each other, are grouped in glandular patches or are joined together as multiple glands. These glandular units belong to two basic morphological types: A and B. Type A glandular units are made up of 3 cells in a row. Their structure resembles that of glandular units of many other insects. Isolated units of type A are found scattered under practically the whole surface of the cuticle. Their density varies from 10 to 15 units/ 10 - 2 mm 2 {{in most parts of the}} insect's surface. However, this density may reach 24 units underneath the antennal disc, and 27 to 66 units/ 10 - 2 mm 2 underneath the trichomes. Certain units of the antennal disc possess a chimney-shaped <b>pore.</b> <b>Multiple</b> glands made up of type A units exist in the head and in the abdomen. They are always associated with noticeable external cuticular structures. In the head, two paired groups of labral glands open at the reticulated surface of the labrum; some units of these glands open also in a groove on the outer edge of the mandibles. Mandibular glands end at the same locations, but most of their units reach the outer edge of the mandibles. It is suggested that these cephalic glands could play a role during trophallactic exchanges between ants and the beetle. The hypopharyngeal gland may have a salivary function. Among the abdominal glands, the paired mediotergal glands open into a large median tergal depression located at the anterior half of the abdomen. The three lateral paired glands (or Wasmann's glands) end near the trichomes, one of them in a sizeable external reservoir, surrounded by the abdominal trichomes. Previous observations of the behavior of ants towards Claviger could be interpreted by suggesting an appeasement function for Wasmann's glands. The mediotergal glands most probably also play a function in host-guest relations. The glandular units of the mandibular and hypopharyngeal glands look very similar to the isolated type A units. The units of the other glands differ in precise structure and proportions. Type B glandular units are one-celled and gland cells similar to them have only rarely been described in the literature. Some isolated type B units are found at the joints. At the most important joints, they are joined together as multiple glands. Their function is most likely to secrete a lubricant. Under the sides of the tergite VIII of the female, which, when stationary, are covered by the sides of sternite VIII, there exists a pygidial glandular patch of type B units of the same structure as those of the joints. These units may also have a lubricant function or play a role in the reproductive behavior of the species. Elsewhere the precise structure of the type B cells vary with their location. They are most numerous underneath the trichomes (57 to 114 units/ 10 - 2 mm 2) and the antennal disc (57 units/ 10 - 2 mm 2). Underneath the rest of the insect surface their density varies from 7 to 42 units/ 10 - 2 mm 2. The highest densities are observed not far from the openings of multiple glands, which appear to secrete allomones acting during host-guest relations, e. g. the labral glands, the mediotergal glands and Wasmann's glands. In most parts of the insect's surface the type B cells outnumber the type A cells. © 1974 Springer-Verlag. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

The host response to the bridge is central to creating a permissive environment, as the cell types that respond to the injury {{have the potential to}} secrete both stimulatory and inhibitory factors. We investigated multiple channel bridges for spinal cord regeneration and correlated the bridge structure to cell infiltration and axonal elongation. Poly(lactide-co-glycolide) bridges were fabricated by a gas foaming/particulate leaching process. Channels within the bridge had diameters of 150 or 250 [*]μm, and {{the main body of the}} bridge was highly porous with a controllable pore size. Upon implantation in a rat spinal cord hemisection site, cells infiltrated into the bridge pores and channels, with the pore size influencing the rate of infiltration.

The channels of the bridge were completely infiltrated with cells, which had aligned axially, and consisted primarily of fibroblasts, S- 100 β-positive cells, and endothelial cells.

These equations describe a wide range of transport phenomena that can interact in complex and highly nonlinear ways in networks involving <b>multiple</b> <b>pores</b> with variable properties. Capturing these phenomena by direct simulation of the governing equations in multiple dimensions is prohibitively expensive.

We report that P 2 X 7 stimulates ROS production in macrophages through the MAPKs ERK 1 / 2 and the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase complex, activates several transcription factors including cyclic-AMP response element-binding protein and components of the activating protein- 1 complex, and contains specific sequences within its intracellular C-terminus that appear critical for its activity. Altogether, these data further implicate P 2 X 7 activation and signaling as a fundamental modulator of macrophage immune responses...|$|R
