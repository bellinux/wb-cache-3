Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 87 - 95. The design, fabrication and {{characterization of}} photonic band gap (PBG) based optical polymer fibers is discussed. Unlike conventional {{total internal reflection}} (TIR) fibers, used primarily in telecommunications, PBG fibers can be made hollow core {{and can be used}} to guide infrared radiation of any wavelength, a property known as wavelength scalability. Since the electromagnetic radiation is transmitted in the hollow core of the fiber, the intrinsic absorption of the fiber core as well as the insertion Fresnel losses at front and end faces are avoided, giving rise to extraordinarily high power densities to be delivered. The fiber production line includes material characterization, and the design of nanoscale quarter wavestacks using common thermoplastic polymers (<b>poly</b> <b>ether</b> <b>sulphone</b> and poly ether imide) and chalcogenide glasses (As 2 S 3, As 2 Se 3, Ge 15 As 25 Se 15 Te 45). The fiber preform is fabricated using rolling mechanism of thermally evaporated chalcogenide glasses on large area polymers. Subsequently, the fiber preforms are thermally drawn to obtain nano-structured PBG fibers. Two different fibers are designed and produced, signifying wavelength scalability of the overall process, for the widely used holmium (Ho:YAG) and carbon dioxide (CO 2) medical lasers. The transmission characteristics of the fibers proved that they can be used to safely deliver 15 Wlaser power, along a 3 meter fiber with external diameter of 1. 5 mm and hollow core diameter of 0. 5 mm, corresponding to a laser power density of 1 kW/cm 2 with a loss of - 10 dB/m. The PBG fibers are expected to be widely used in high precision surgical laser for incision, photoablation and coagulation where infrared radiation is the radiation of choice for its superior laser-tissue interaction properties.

40|$|In this thesis, {{two major}} topics are discussed, namely the {{synthesis}} and characterisation of a cyanate ester polymer {{system based on}} the poly(arylene <b>ether</b> <b>sulphone)</b> backbone, together with the molecular modelling of this and similar polymeric systems. The molecular modelling studies involve the general modelling of a poly(arylene <b>ether</b> <b>sulphone)</b> oligomer in a vacuum, which has the same repeat unit as UDEL poly(sulphone), originally produced by Union Carbide. The oligomer was characterised by atomistic models of the system using molecular mechanics and molecular dynamics techniques in which {{the flexibility of the}} backbone torsional angles were examined. The sulphone torsional angle was identified as the most flexible, followed by the ether torsional angle, with the isopropylidene angle being the most inflexible. Their energy barriers were 1, 4 and 6 kcal/mol respectively. The complexity of the polymeric system was then increased to model the above thermoplastic polymer under the influence of bulk conditions. Finally, the thermoset polymer with a poly(arylene <b>ether</b> <b>sulphone)</b> backbone, linked together by cross-linking cyanurate rings was modelled. Conformational properties were obtained of the various linking groups together with the calculation of various mechanical and physical properties, e. g., the Young's moduli and the glass transition temperatures of the simulated polymers. The results obtained from this work were generally in good agreement with experimental calculations. The synthetic work involved making the oligomeric repeat unit which constituted the repeat unit used in the thermoset modelling studies. A poly(arylene <b>ether</b> <b>sulphone)</b> dicyanate ester oligomer was synthesised, which when cured, formed a cyanurate ringed thermoset network via the reaction of three cyanate ester groups to form an s-triazine ring. This polymer was then characterised by classical techniques to obtain various mechanical and physical properties of the networked thermoset polymer. These were then compared with the properties calculated in the modelling studies. Fairly good agreement between the experimental and simulated results were observed, e. g., the simulated Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio were 3. 64 GPa and 0. 35 respectively, whilst the experimental results were 2. 50 GPa and 0. 33 respectively. In essence, the objective of this thesis was to synthesise and simulate via molecular simulation some poly(arylene <b>ether</b> <b>sulphone)</b> based thermoplastic and thermoset polymers and then to compare the various properties obtained from both techniques. The results show that molecular modelling techniques can be used to obtain accurate values of various properties of polymeric systems. This indicates that in the future, molecular modelling in conjunction with synthetic techniques may be used to predict trends and values of various properties of polymeric systems...|$|R

Furthermore, the water flux for PS at 10 bar was 12. 41 L m- 2 h- 1.

40|$|The {{formation}} of nodular {{structures in the}} top layer of ultrafiltration membranes is con-sidered. A critical review of mechanisms described in the literature is given. Flat-sheet <b>poly</b> (<b>ether</b> sulfone) membranes and hollow-fiber <b>poly</b> (<b>ether</b> sulfone) /polyvinylpyrrolidone membranes were made by coagulation of a polymer solution in a nonsolvent medium under different circumstances. From these experiments, a number of empirical rules are found to describe the resulting morphology of the top layer. A new mechanism for the {{formation of}} a nodular structure is proposed. I t is based on the small diffusion coefficient of the polymer molecules compared to the diffusion coefficient of solvent and nonsolvent combined {{with a high degree of}} entanglement of the polymer network.

The rapid diffusional exchange of solvent for nonsolvent in the top layer leads to vitrification of the maxima of the concentration fluctuations that form the nodules.

40|$|This work {{describes}} the synthesis and properties of new oligmeric, polymeric and macrocyclic <b>ether</b> <b>sulphones</b> bearing carboxylic {{groups in the}} side chains. Linear <b>ether</b> <b>sulphones</b> Several oligo(ether-sulphones) with carboxylic groups in the side chains and either chlorophenyl-endgroups (4 a-h) or phenolic endgroups (5 a, 5 b) were synthesized by polycondensation of different relative amounts of bis(4 -chlorophenyl) sulphone (2) and 4, 4 -bis(4 -hydroxyphenyl) pentanoic acid (1). The molecular weight distributions of the oligo(ether-sulphone) -fractions of 4 a-h were estimated by GPC, elementary analysis and NMR-spectroscopy. The glass transition temperatures of the oligo(ether-sulphones) increase with the molecular weight of the oligomers. Macrocycles New macrocyclic arylene <b>ether</b> <b>sulphones</b> bearing one or two carboxylic groups (8 and 9 respectively) were prepared by use of pseudo high dilution technique. In a first step, 4, 4 -bis(4 (4 -chlorophenylsulphonyl) -phenoxy - 4 -phenyl) pentanoic acid (7) was prepared from 4, 4 -bis(4 -hydroxyphenyl) pentanoic acid (1) and an excess of bis(4 -chlorophenyl) sulphone (3). Then, the purified trimer 7 was cyclocondensed with 4, 4 -bis(4 -hydroxyphenyl) pentanoic acid (1), yielding the bifunctionalized macrocycle (8), and with 2, 2 -bis-(4 -hydroxyphenyl) propan (2) to get the monofunctionalized mocrocycle (9). The existence of the ring shaped molecule was proved by use of MALDI-TOF, NMR- and IR-spectroscopy. The free carboxylic groups of 8 were used {{to build up a}} polyamide (under the conditions of Yamazaki) that contain the macrocycle in the main chain and 4, 4 ´-diaminodiphenylmethane as an aromatic diamine-component. Block copolymers The nucleophilic telechelic oligo(ether sulphone) s with free carboxylic groups in the side chains and phenolic endgroups (5 a, 5 b) have been uesd for building block copolymers. The carboxylic groups were esterified with methanol (16 a, 16 b). As electrophilic prepolymers the OH-endgroups of several poly(ethylene glycol) s and poly(butylene glycol) s were mesylated to incorporate good leaving endgroups. For coupling of these two prepolymers a nucleophilic aliphatic condensation reaction was carried out. The resulting block copolymers contain both, the hydrophilic polyethers as soft segments and the relatively rigid and hydrophobic oligo(ether sulphone) s as hard segments. GPC-, NMR-, FTIR- measurements and the data from thermal investigations of the block copolymers (19 a- 19 h) are discussed. Additionally, the block copolymer 19 h was fractionated and characterized by use of GPC-FTIR spectroscopy. Multilayers The poly(ether-sulphone) s with carboxylic groups in the side chains can also be applied as polyanions. Therefore this poly(ether-sulphone) s and some modified oligo(ether-sulphone) s with carboxylic groups and additionaly sulfonated acid gropus have been used for building multilayers. The method for the multilayer build-up is based on physisorption of the polyelectrolytes. The multilayers obtained are characterized by UV-Vis spectrometry. In dependence of the used polyanions multilayers with more than 30 double layers have been realized.

Polysilsesquioxanes or oligo silsesquioxanes containing epoxy functionalities were in-situ grown in the casting solution and made available for further reaction with amines in the coagulation/annealing baths. Water permeances up to 1500 l m- 2 h- 1 bar- 1 were obtained with sharp pore size distribution and a pore diameter peak at 66 nm, confirmed by porosimetry, allowing 99. 2...|$|R

Here we report for seven polymers on their ternary systems containing water, sodium sulfate and the (block co) <b>poly</b> <b>ether.</b> Equilibrium data were measured at 298. 15 K and 313. 15 K and atmospheric pressure. Empirical equations {{have been used to}} correlate the experimental equilibria for both temperatures separately and the semi-empirical NRTL model has been applied with a temperature dependent parameter to describe the complete dataset for both temperatures together. Model predictions were in good agreement with the experimental data...|$|R
