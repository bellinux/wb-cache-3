40|$|Clock {{synchronization}} protocols in {{wireless sensor networks}} (WSNs) {{provide a}} uniform notion of time which is required by both system as well as application level programs of WSNs. Since nodes have limited energy, it is required that the energy consumed by the clock synchronization protocols is as minimum as possible. Synchronous clock synchronization protocols execute their clock synchronization process at each node, roughly during the same real-time interval, called <b>synchronization</b> <b>phase.</b> The energy consumed by these protocols depends on {{the duration of the}} <b>synchronization</b> <b>phase</b> and how frequently the <b>synchronization</b> <b>phase</b> is executed. Hence, to minimize the energy consumption by each node, the duration of <b>synchronization</b> <b>phase</b> should be as small as possible, and the interval between consecutive <b>synchronization</b> <b>phases</b> as large as possible. Due to different drift rates of the clocks, the <b>synchronization</b> <b>phases</b> at different nodes drift apart and special techniques are required to keep them in sync. Keeping <b>synchronization</b> <b>phases</b> at neighbouring nodes in sync helps to reduce the <b>synchronization</b> <b>phase.</b> In this paper, we propose a novel technique using TDMA-based MAC protocol to keep the <b>synchronization</b> <b>phases</b> at neighbouring nodes in sync much more tightly than the existing techniques. We have applied the technique in the improved weighted-average based clock synchronization (IWICS) protocol to reduce the <b>synchronization</b> <b>phase</b> considerably and the modified TDMA-based IWICS protocol is named TIWICS protocol. This reduction in energy consumption is achieved without reducing the synchronization accuracy.

40|$|Mobile {{networks}} rely on {{the availability}} of accurate synchronization to maintain proper operations and service Quality. TDD-based technologies require high level of frequency stability and accuracy in the air interface while FDD technologies and some advance feature, in LTE and LTE-A, require further <b>phase</b> and time <b>synchronization</b> to function properly. Network synchronization in mobile networks is generally responsible for the distribution of timing references in the RAN via the transport network. While legacy TDM-based backhauls are capable of delivering frequency <b>synchronization,</b> <b>phase</b> and time <b>synchronization</b> require the use of packet-based timing protocols to propagate time information. The performance of packet-based protocols is, however, highly dependent on the performance of the underlying packet network. Network impairments, such as packet delay variations, generally {{have a significant impact on}} the performance of packet-based methods. Considering the high level of accuracy required in <b>phase</b> and time <b>synchronization</b> in mobile networks, it is essential that the potential sources of error need to be identified and appropriate mitigation mechanisms be considered in the design and implementation of the timing functionalities. As such, this thesis focuses on investigating the potential sources of error in distributing time information across packet-based backhaul networks so that the clock recovery algorithms will be designed with the proper detection and compensation mechanisms needed to meet the stringent requirements for <b>phase</b> and time <b>synchronization...</b>|$|R

50|$|<b>Phase</b> <b>synchronization</b> {{occurs when}} the coupled chaotic {{oscillators}} keep their phase difference bounded while their amplitudes remain uncorrelated.This phenomenon occurs even if the oscillators are not identical. Observation of <b>phase</b> <b>synchronization</b> requires a previous definition of the phase of a chaotic oscillator. In many practical cases, {{it is possible to}} find a plane in phase space in which the projection of the trajectories of the oscillator follows a rotation around a well-defined center. If this is the case, the phase is defined by the angle, φ(t), described by the segment joining the center of rotation and the projection of the trajectory point onto the plane. In other cases it is still possible to define a phase by means of techniques provided by the theory of signal processing, such as the Hilbert transform. In any case, if φ1(t) and φ2(t) denote the phases of the two coupled oscillators, synchronization of the phase is given by the relation nφ1(t)=mφ2(t) with m and n whole numbers.|$|E
