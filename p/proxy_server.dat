40|$|Abstract. With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of streaming media applications, clustered streaming media <b>proxy</b> <b>servers</b> {{have become the}} mainstream of high-end streaming media proxy. To increase the IO throughput capacity of streaming media <b>proxy</b> <b>servers,</b> the most effective method is middle-ware technology in which several servers are bridged {{together to form a}} <b>proxy</b> cache <b>server</b> cluster, and the key is the coordination of individual <b>proxy</b> <b>servers.</b> The decision problem of the user request dispatch actually belongs to NP-complete. This article proposes an online coordination algorithm for the load sharing streaming media <b>proxy</b> <b>servers,</b> and discusses the relative deviation of the online algorithm from the optimal solution, to serve as a reference to the specific applications of clustered streaming media <b>proxy</b> <b>servers...</b>|$|R

25|$|Opera Mini {{was derived}} from the Opera web browser. Opera Mini {{requests}} web pages through Opera Software's compression <b>proxy</b> <b>server.</b> The compression server processes and compresses requested web pages before sending them to the mobile phone.

However, interactive sites which depend upon the device processing JavaScript do not work properly.|$|E
500|$|The MediaWiki {{software}} that Wikipedia runs on can interpret X-Forwarded-For (XFF) headers, allowing Wikipedia {{to identify a}} user's main IP address rather than the proxy IP address, allowing the ability to block proxy users individually by their client's IP rather than the <b>proxy</b> <b>server</b> IP (avoiding the need to block the whole proxy due to {{the actions of a}} single user). However, none of the ISPs subscribing to this system pass XFF information to Wikipedia, having the impact of reversing the normal method of identification and blocking on Wikipedia. [...] IP addresses assumed to be assigned to an individual person or organisation were assigned instead to millions of people and thousands of registered editors. Wikipedia servers saw them all as the IP of the proxy rather than each as the IP of their own machine.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{gives an}} {{overview}} of the functions of the <b>proxy</b> <b>servers</b> in accessing multimedia objects over the Internet. The <b>proxy</b> <b>servers</b> use the cache replacement policies to select the cold objects to be removed from cache to release space. They use the object partitioning methods to divide each multimedia object into cacheable and non-cacheable parts. When the client bandwidth is insufficient to receive the original object, the <b>proxy</b> <b>servers</b> convert multimedia objects into objects of lower resolution in order to adapt to the client characteristics. When multiple <b>proxy</b> <b>servers</b> are present, they may work together in a cooperative manner to further enhance the cache efficiency or in a distributed manner to evenly spread the load. In summary, <b>proxy</b> <b>servers</b> become the centre of management with respect to the delivery of multimedia objects from web servers to clients over the Internet...|$|R

The architecture uses <b>proxy</b> <b>servers</b> to provide application layer functionalities by directing all packets originated from the mobile hosts to a close-by mobility-aware router so that the latter can maintain active data connections during handoffs across different networks.

The site's operators respond that this is in fact their goal, to have real predators hide away from the places that children go; they liken the site to putting up a Community Watch sign at a local playground, which could be argued to discourage predators from kidnapping children there.
