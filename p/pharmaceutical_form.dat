Salerno’s pharmacotherapy, as it can be seen from the Antidotarium, was based on “sugar-honey pharmacy” and the only difference between <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>forms</b> was viscosity of forms. The following forms are described in the Antidotarium: electuaria, morsuli, pillules, trochisci, sirupi, emplastra, unguenta and olea. Antidotarium Nicolai is of unique importance since it is the first attempt of systematisation of <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>forms.</b> Although today’s criteria differ significantly from Nicolaus’s, this book still has a great value as it represents the basis for all further pharmacopoeias written many years after Antidotarium Nicolai...|$|R

40|$|Absorption and {{distribution}} of zinc in 6 dosage forms were determined in 10 subjects by performing a pharmacokinetic study of the serum zinc profile after oral administration of a dose corresponding to 45 mg elemental zinc. The {{aim of this study}} was to document the influence on zinc bioavailability of factors such as the chemical form of zinc, the <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>form,</b> and the division of the administered dose. The pharmacokinetic parameters indicate for gelatin capsules without excipients taken in a non divided dose better performances for zinc gluconate in comparison to zinc sulfate. Concerning the <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>form,</b> little difference is observed between an aqueous solution and a gelatin capsule for zinc sulfate and a non divided dose; on the contrary, a commercial gelatin capsule containing zinc gluconate with various excipients show better performances than gastro-resistant tablets when zinc intake is 3 times 15 mg. Finally, the division in 3 parts of the dose of zinc sulfate given in gelatin capsules very significantly improves zinc absorption. These results demonstrate the interest of the developed pharmacokinetic method in the assessment of zinc bioavailability in different pharmaceutical dosage forms.

40|$|ABSTRACT Diabetes {{mellitus}} is {{a chronic}} and severe metabolic dysfunction, it's slow and progressive evolution interferes {{directly in the}} metabolism of carbohydrates, fats and proteins, causing hyperglycemia, glycosuria, polydipsia, hyperlipidaemia, among others. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the antidiabetic effect of hydroethanolic extract and granulated of Calophyllum brasiliense Cambess., Clusiaceae, species in diabetic rats as well as it's biochemical parameters. The results demonstrated that both the <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>forms,</b> hydroethanolic extract and granulated, were able to reduce significantly (p < 0. 001) hyperglycemia and glycosuria, in addition to improve polydipsia, polyuria, and weight loss. Treatments using hydroethanolic extract and granulated were also able to reduce significantly levels of triacylglycerides, cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein, as well as the transaminases, urea and creatinine levels. Therefore, it is concluded that these <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>forms</b> have anti-diabetic effect and act improving the biochemical parameters, this effect is probably due to the high content of polyphenolic compounds found in the formulations...|$|R

40|$|After its oral administration, a <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>form</b> is {{subjected}} to several factors potentially influencing the drug release. Once it is assumed, the dosage form reaches the stomach, through the esophagus, and from there, {{at the end of}} the digestive function, it passes in the intestine where it is absorbed through the intestinal walls and distributed in the circulatory system. The main goal of pharmacokinetic analysis is the prediction of the drug behavior after an administration: the in-vitro tests serve as a guide in estimating the drug release profiles. Thus, to develop a device simulating the drug release due to the oral administration, the physiology has to be considered. Conventionally, the release of a drug from a pharmaceutical is analyzed by USP-approved apparatuses [1] which are limited to analyze what happens during the dissolution step: the most widely used is the USP Apparatus II. During the last decades, different devices not approved officially by the Pharmacopoeia have been proposed to reproduce the gastrointestinal environment, but they still lack of an appropriate reproduction of the mechanical conditions [2]. The aim of this work is to design and test an in-vitro device which is able to simulate the real mechanical history that a <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>form</b> undergoes in the stomach and to evaluate the influence of the fluid-dynamic conditions on the release profiles. Moreover, the absorption across the intestinal wall is simulated, obtaining the release profiles both in the gastrointestinal tract and in the circulatory system across the intestinal tract, reproducing more accurately the real physiology than the conventional tests...|$|E

40|$|The spectrofluorometric method, {{based on}} {{fluorescence}} properties of aluminium (III) –hesperidin complex, for {{the determination of}} hesperidin in human plasma and <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>forms</b> has been developed and validated. The complex shows strong emission {{in the presence of}} surfactant betain sulfonate SB 12 at 476 nm with excitation at 390 nm. Linearity range in <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>forms</b> of hesperidin was 0. 06 – 24. 4 μg mL- 1 with LOD 0. 016 μg mL- 1 and LOQ 0. 049 μg mL- 1. Recovery values in the range 99. 3 – 99. 7 % indicate good accuracy of the method. A linear dependence of the intensity of fluorescence of the complex on the concentration of hesperidin in plasma was obtained in concentration range from 0. 1 – 12. 2 μg mL- 1. The LOD was 0. 032 μg mL- 1 while LOQ was 0. 096 μg mL- 1. Recovery values were in the range 98. 4 – 99. 8 %. The reliability of the method was checked by LC-MS/MS method for plasma samples and HPLC/UV method for tablets with direct determination of hesperidin after separation. Linearity range in determination of hesperidin in <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>forms</b> was obtained in the range from 0. 05 to 10. 00 μg mL- 1. The LOD was 0. 01 μg mL- 1 and LOQ was 0. 03 μg mL- 1. Linearity range in plasma determination of hesperidin was 0. 02 – 10. 00 μg mL- 1 with LOD 0. 005 μg mL- 1 and LOQ 0. 015 μg mL- 1.
