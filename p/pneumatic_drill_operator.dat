Because of the hilly terrain, manual digging is the preferred method; furthermore, because of the geology, granite is usually encountered {{and has to be}} removed by <b>pneumatic</b> <b>drills.</b> This creates a great deal of crystalline silica- containing dust in a confined space and is extremely hazardous to the <b>drill</b> <b>operators.</b> As high as 2000 times the threshold limit value has been measured in previous studies, and some <b>drill</b> <b>operators</b> contracted silicosis within 1 year. An in situ dust removal system, using wet scrubbing and ventilation methods, was designed, fabricated, and field tested and proved to be effective in removing up to 98 percent of the dust generated in a 1 -m diameter caisson...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Pneumatic</b> <b>drills</b> were {{developed}} {{in response to the}} needs of mining, quarrying, excavating, and tunneling. In 1806 Samuel Miller invented a steam driven percussion drill. In 1838 Isaac Singer invented another steam driven <b>drill.</b> A <b>pneumatic</b> <b>drill</b> was proposed by a C. Brunton in 1844. [...] The first [...] "percussion drill" [...] was made in 1848 and patented in 1849 by Jonathan J. Couch of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. [...] In this drill, the drill bit passed through the piston of a steam engine. The piston snagged the drill bit and hurled it against the rock face. It was an experimental model. In 1849, Couch's assistant, Joseph W. Fowle, filed a patent caveat for a percussion drill of his own design. In Fowle’s drill, the drill bit was connected directly to the piston in the steam cylinder; specifically, the drill bit was connected to the piston’s crosshead. The drill also had a mechanism for turning the drill bit around its axis between strokes and for advancing the drill as the hole deepened. [...] By 1850 or 1851, Fowle was using compressed air to drive his drill, making it the first true <b>pneumatic</b> <b>drill.</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Cholesteatomas are {{epithelial}} cysts {{that contain}} desquamated keratin. Patients commonly present with progressive hearing loss and a chronically discharging ear. We report an unusual {{presentation of the}} disease with an acute hearing loss suffered immediately after prolonged use of a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>drill.</b> Case presentation A 41 year old man with no previous history of ear problems presented with a sudden loss of hearing in his right ear immediately following the prolonged use of a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>drill</b> on concrete. The cause {{was found to be}} a fractured long process of incus which had been eroded by the presence of an attic cholesteatoma. A tympanomastoidectomy and ossiculoplasty was performed with good result. Conclusion Cholesteatomas may be asymptomatic and insidious in their onset.

40|$|In {{response}} to the Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969, mandatory noise standards have been developed that specify time-noise limits of mine personnel exposure. Most affected by elevated noise levels is the pneumatic roof bolter operator, {{both in terms of}} levels near or in excess of 115 dbA and in terms of length of exposure. Therefore, the principal emphasis of this Bureau of Mines report is on <b>pneumatic</b> <b>drill</b> noise control. It is not the intent of this report to suggest any drill redesign; instead, methods are suggested to reduce the noise level by complementing existing machines. An integral muffler system and a separate muffler system were tested in an attempt to lower pneurnaric <b>drill</b> noise levels. <b>Pneumatic</b> <b>drills,</b> when new, operate at about 115 dbA when drilling in sandstone. Using the drill muffler systems, it was possible to decrease the noise level of a 115 -dbA s rope drill to approximately 100 dbA...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe primary {{problem to}} carry out Seismic While Mining is whether the seismic signals, induced by {{vibration}} of mining machines, can be useful seismic sources. Firstly, this paper describes the seismic signals near filed induced by the shearer, boring machine and <b>pneumatic</b> <b>drill</b> respectively, and the signal features in time domain, frequency domain, autocorrelation functions. Secondly, shows the features of far field seismic signal emitted by the shearer, and the seismic interferometry of the record also is done. The result shows that the signal from the shearer is stronger in 1 - 400 Hz, and contained pulses and periodic compositions, {{in line with the}} characteristics of the shearer mining; far field signal of the shearer is mixed with microseisms; the single-shot record can gain from the far field shearer signal via deconvolution and correlation, and the seismic features of the shearer and microseisms are similar; seismic signals emitted from the boring machine and <b>pneumatic</b> <b>drill</b> also have broad band features. The experiential studies suggest that the vibration signals induced by the mining machines can be seismic sources...|$|R
40|$|As a {{consequence}} of the acute honey bee poisoning events observed in several European countries during maize drilling, the dust drift topic has received increasingly more attention. We aimed to quantify the dust drift risk, develop reduction measures and innovate sowing techniques using an integrated experimental and modelling approach. To validate and finetune the dust drift CFD-models under development, the designs of three selected sowing machines and associated tractors were digitised. For the two <b>pneumatic</b> <b>drills,</b> the airflows around the machines and at the in- and outlet air ducts were measured. Air velocities at the outlets ranged from only 0. 11 m s- 1 for the <b>pneumatic</b> bulk <b>drill</b> up to 26. 1 m s- 1 for the <b>pneumatic</b> precision <b>drill</b> without deflector. The use of a deflector reduced the exit velocities to 13. 4 m s- 1 as well as the air velocities around the machine. Reference tracer seeds were developed with different qualities regarding dust production in order to measure the dissipation of dust around static operated drills and in field conditions. status: publishe...|$|R
5000|$|In Europe {{since the}} late 1840s, the king of Sardinia, Carlo Alberto, had been contemplating the {{excavation}} of a 12 km tunnel through Mount Fréjus to create a rail link between Italy and France, which would cross his realm. [...] The need for a mechanical rock drill was obvious and this sparked research on <b>pneumatic</b> rock <b>drills</b> in Europe. A Frenchman, Cavé, designed, and in 1851 patented, a rock drill that used compressed air; but the air had to be admitted manually to the cylinder during each stroke, {{so it was not}} successful. [...] In 1854, in England, Thomas Bartlett made and then patented (1855) a rock drill whose drill bit was connected directly to the piston of a steam engine. In 1855 Bartlett demonstrated his drill, powered by compressed air, to officials of the Mt. Fréjus tunnel project. [...] (In 1855, a German, Schumann, invented a similar <b>pneumatic</b> rock <b>drill</b> in Freiburg, Germany.) Bartlett’s drill was refined by the Savoy-born engineer Germain Sommeiller (1815-1871) and his colleagues, Grandis and Grattoni, by 1861.
