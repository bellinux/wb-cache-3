50|$|The Puma, while {{externally}} {{not very}} different from existing IFVs, incorporates a number of advances and state-of-the-art technologies.

5000|$|The solid {{compound}} {{found inside}} the aerosol generator units uses environment friendly, naturally occurring potassium salts to extinguish fire by inhibiting the chemical chain reactions in the flame on a molecular level. On activation, the compound {{is transformed into}} a condensed aerosol consisting mainly of (K2CO3), (...) (vapor), N2 and CO2. The gas-type properties of the aerosol facilitate its even distribution in the <b>protected</b> <b>volume</b> as well as its flow into the natural convection currents of combustion. The solid particles of potassium salts, which are of a few microns in size, are suspended in an inert gas that displays a high surface to reaction mass ratio. When the aerosol reacts with the flame, Potassium radicals (K*) are formed mainly from the disassociation of (K2CO3). The K*s bind to other flame free radicals (hydroxyls - OH-) forming stable products such as KOH. This action extinguishes fire without depleting the ambient oxygen content. KOH reacts further in the presence of CO2 and forms (K2CO3). It is a sustainable approach that challenges conventional firefighting technologies of cooling, starvation or smothering. The physical and chemical characteristics of the technology do not pose a threat to humans or the environment. The United States Environmental Protection Agency has listed FirePro technology in its Significant New Alternatives Policy (SNAP) under the stratospheric ozone protection provisions of the Clean Air Act. The Green Label scheme recommends that they are ozone-friendly and do not contain CFCâ€™s. The National Aerospace Laboratory concludes [...] "that the Electronics Instrumentation test objects exposed to the action of the fire extinguishing agent FirePro have not been affected by their combined exposure to the condensed aerosol medium and to the exposure to a temperature/ humidity variation cycles." ...|$|E

There are, however, several problems associated with introducing the water mist into the flame: the spray reaches only a short distance; small water droplets have a very short lifetime; droplets coagulate into larger droplets; large droplets hit obstacles such as walls and therefore have difficulties in being dispersed throughout the <b>protected</b> <b>volume...</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} improving detection, assessment, and response capabilities of security systems. Our approach combines two state-of-the-art technologies: volumetric video motion detection (VVMD) and virtual reality (VR). This work capitalizes {{on the ability of}} VVMD technology to provide three-dimensional (3 D) information about the position, shape, and size of intruders within a <b>protected</b> <b>volume.</b> The 3 D information is obtained by fusing motion detection data from multiple video sensors. The second component involves the application of VR technology to display information relating to the sensors and the sensor environment. VR technology enables an operator, or security guard, to be immersed in a 3 D graphical representation of the remote site. VVMD data is transmitted from the remote site via ordinary telephone lines. There are several benefits to displaying VVMD information in this way. Because the VVMD system provides 3 D information and because the sensor environment is a physical 3 D space, it seems natural to display this information in 3 D. Also, the 3 D graphical representation depicts essential details within and around the <b>protected</b> <b>volume</b> in a natural way for human perception. Sensor information can also be more easily interpreted when the operator can `move` through the virtual environment and explore the relationships between the sensor data, objects and other visual cues present in the virtual environment. By exploiting the powerful ability of humans to understand and interpret 3 D information, we expect to improve the means for visualizing and interpreting sensor information, allow a human operator to assess a potential threat more quickly and accurately, and enable a more effective response. This paper will detail both the VVMD and VR technologies and will discuss a prototype system based upon their integration...|$|E

30|$|The {{definition}} of proper data protection tools tailored for Big Data platforms is {{as a very}} ambitious research challenge. State of the art enforcement techniques proposed for traditional systems cannot be used as they are, or straightforwardly adapted to the Big Data context. This is mainly due to the required support for semi structured and unstructured data (Variety), the quantity of data to be <b>protected</b> (<b>Volume),</b> and the very strict performance requirements (Velocity) affecting these systems. Therefore, the challenge is protecting privacy and confidentiality while not hindering data analytics and information sharing. Additional aspects contribute to raise the complexity of this goal, such as the variety of data models and data analysis and manipulation languages which are used by Big Data platforms. Indeed, different from RDBMSs, Big Data platforms are characterized by various data models (Cattell 2011), the most notable being the key-value, wide column, and document oriented ones.|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} {{aimed to}} test the effectiveness {{of gas and dust}} explosion suppression by means of a super fast explosion suppression system with a volume of 5 dm 3. Smokeless powder as an explosive charge and sodium bicarbonate as a suppressing material were used.

Approximately 1. 75 kg of extinguishing powder was placed in the container. The membrane was ruptured by exploding a specially developed charge located inside a perforated steel combustion chamber and mounted over the suppressing powder surface.

40|$|The {{present study}} focuses on {{extinction}} of flames with water mist where surface cooling effects are neglected i. e. water mist {{as a total}} flooding system where the direct spray cannot reach and cool all burning items in the <b>protected</b> <b>volume.</b> The study includes {{a survey of the}} production and properties of water mist such as different types of nozzles and means to describe droplet size distribution. Properties of jets and sprays are discussed as well as water droplet movement, fall and evaporation. Three different series of experiments were conducted with different hydraulic atomising nozzles. In the first series, droplet size distribution and water spray distribution measurements for the nozzles were conducted. The measurements showed that the droplet size distribution ranged from a Sauter Mean Diameter of approximately 35 - 85 Âµm, all dependent on the water pressure and the configuration of nozzles. The measurements show that considerably larger droplets are formed when individual nozzles are placed together. This can be explained by a coalescence effect when droplets from the sprays of the nozzles collide. The second series of experiments were done using a tubular propane gas bumer where water and propane were mixed prior to reaching the burner outlet. Based on the tests, the specific amount of extinguishing medium required (Required Extinguishing Medium Portion, REMP = m, / m, i. e. the ratio of the agent quantity to fuel quantity consumed) is given as a quantitative measure of the efficiency of the agent. The lower the REMP value, the more efficient the agent. The water pressure ranged between 40 and 80 bar which provided for droplet sizes with a Sauter Mean Diameter in the order of 35 pm. The results show that the amount of water needed for extinguishment by weight is between 1. 2 - 2, 2 times the amount of propane gas. The decrease in droplet sizes decreased the amount of water needed. Another observation was that the heat release rate of the fire is not affected until extinction occurs. A REMP-value of 1, 2 - 2, 2 corresponds to a water content of 100 â€“ 200 g/m 3 <b>protected</b> <b>volume</b> which is in agreement with theoretical values. Finally, a series of tests were conducted in a 113 scale room using a propane gas fire. Parameters such as location of the fire, the location of the nozzle, water flow rate {{and the size of the}} room opening were varied. In these tests the water content needed was in close agreement with the values obtained from the REh 4 P experiments and the theoretical values. These tests also highlighted the problem of delivering the droplets to the fire. To achieve "total flooding" in an actual situation, nozzles covering the complete protected compartment, with additional nozzles under obstructions would be needed. To make droplets follow the air flows inside a room and behave more like a gaseous total flooding agent, requires droplets of a size in the order of 1 - 20 Âµm...|$|E
40|$|The US and the Russian Federation are {{currently}} engaged in negotiating or implementing several nuclear arms and nuclear material control agreements. These involve placing nuclear material in specially designed containers within controlled facilities. Some of the agreements require {{the removal of}} nuclear components from stockpile weapons. These components are placed in steel containers that are then sealed and tagged. Current strategies for monitoring the agreements involve taking neutron and gamma radiation measurements of components in their containers to monitor the presence, mass, and composition of plutonium or highly enriched uranium, {{as well as other}} attributes that indicate the use of the material in a weapon. If accurate enough to be useful, these measurements will yield data containing information about the design of the weapon being monitored. In each case, the design data are considered sensitive by one or both parties to the agreement. To prevent the disclosure of this information in a bilateral or trilateral inspection scenario, so-called information barriers have evolved. These barriers combine hardware, software, and procedural safeguards to contain the sensitive data within a <b>protected</b> <b>volume,</b> presenting to the inspector only the processed results needed for verification. Interlocks and volatile memory guard against disclosure in case of failure. Implementing these safeguards requires innovation in radiation measurement instruments and data security.

40|$|International audienceAn {{experimental}} study of annular jets with central aspiration is presented. Two flow regimes were studied for creating either local air cond 1 t 1 oning or local ventilation systems. The local air-conditioning system was developed by maintaining the same flow rates of the non-swirling annular jet and central aspiration, A new concept of a 'local ventilation system' was created by combining the swirling annular air jet impinging on the plate and central aspiration. Due to the rather small consumption of energy, the tested air-conditioning and ventilation systems are very functional and capable of maintaining local and confined micro-climate or ventilated zones in large volumes.
