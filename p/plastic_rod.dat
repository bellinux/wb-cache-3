500|$|The idea of {{attaching}} a reflector {{sight to}} a firearm {{has been around}} since its invention in 1900. Soon after World War II models appeared for rifles and shotguns including the Nydar shotgun sight (1945), which used a curved semi-reflective mirror to reflect an ambient lit reticle, and the Giese electric gunsight (1947), which had a battery-powered illuminated reticle. Later types included the Qwik-Point (1970) and the Thompson Insta-Sight. Both were beam-splitter type reflector sights that used ambient light: illuminating a green crosshair in the Insta-Sight, and a red <b>plastic</b> <b>rod</b> [...] "light pipe" [...] that produced a red aiming spot reticle in the Qwik-Point.|$|E
5000|$|Take a thin {{cylindrical}} <b>plastic</b> <b>rod</b> {{and push}} both ends together. Before buckling, {{the system is}} symmetric under rotation, and so visibly cylindrically symmetric. But after buckling, it looks different, and asymmetric. Nevertheless, features of the cylindrical symmetry are still there: ignoring friction, it would take no force to freely spin the rod around, displacing the ground state in time, and amounting to an oscillation of vanishing frequency, unlike the radial oscillations {{in the direction of}} the buckle. This spinning mode is effectively the requisite Nambu-Goldstone boson.|$|E
50|$|A {{glass or}} <b>plastic</b> <b>rod</b> of 6 mm {{diameter}} having a globe {{on one end}} with varying diameter from 10 to 25 mm, called Glaister Keen rod, is used for close examination of the hymen or the degree of its rupture. In forensic medicine, it is recommended by health authorities that a physician who must swab near this area of a prepubescent girl avoid the hymen and swab the outer vulval vestibule instead. In cases of suspected rape or child sexual abuse, a detailed examination of the hymen may be performed, but {{the condition of the}} hymen alone is often inconclusive.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Fiber-reinforced {{plastics}} {{consist of}} fibers of high strength and modulus embedded in, or bonded to a matrix with distinct interfaces between them. Because fiber configuration {{plays a key}} role in determining mechanical strength of fiber-reinforced <b>plastic</b> <b>rods,</b> especially bending strength of fiber-reinforced <b>plastic</b> <b>rods</b> was measured and simulated numerically in variation with winding angles. Also, stress distribution in fiber-reinforced <b>plastic</b> <b>rods</b> was simulated numerically under the condition of constant bending load to fiber-reinforced <b>plastic</b> <b>rods.</b> The measured bending strength of fiber-reinforced <b>plastic</b> <b>rods</b> in variation with winding angles was different from that of simulated. The difference between measured and simulated results was due to the effect of shear stresses on the strength of fiber-reinforced <b>plastic</b> <b>rods...</b>|$|R

50|$|For example, to scratch-build a small board fence, the modeler {{could use}} <b>plastic</b> <b>rod</b> stock {{to form the}} {{vertical}} posts, then use plastic bar stock to form horizontal rails affixed to the posts, lay plastic strip stock vertically on the horizontal rails (perhaps 'distressed' with a wire brush to mimic wood grain, or by using thin strips of actual wood), trimming the top and bottoms of the strips to be even, adding details like nail holes (using a small pin), and then finishing and weathering (making a model look like {{it has been used}} via dust, dirt, stains, and wear).|$|E
5000|$|Another type uses a glass {{reinforced}} <b>plastic</b> <b>rod</b> with a notch in one side, which carries {{one or two}} ribbons of glass fibers. The notch is filled with water-resistant gel and covered with an extruded plastic filler strip. The whole assembly is enclosed in a sunlight and tracking resistant sheath. This design is not as flexible as the symmetrical cylindrical design above, but provides good access to the fibers at joints and is resistant to crushing. At full working load the optical fibers may experience up to 0.25% strain, which is undesirable for long fiber life.|$|E
50|$|Typically, {{polyurethane}} or vinyl {{materials are}} {{used to make the}} bag. A tube shaped bag is open at both ends. The piece, or pieces to be glued are placed into the bag and the ends sealed. One method of sealing the open ends of the bag is by placing a clamp on each end of the bag. A <b>plastic</b> <b>rod</b> is laid across the end of the bag, the bag is then folded over the rod. A plastic sleeve with an opening in it, is then snapped over the rod. This procedure forms a seal {{at both ends of the}} bag, when the vacuum is ready to be drawn.|$|E

5000|$|Interior doors {{should be}} closed and secured to {{restrict}} a child's {{access to such}} areas as garages, basements, laundry rooms, home offices & gyms, bathrooms, or any other potentially hazardous area. Many different types of door latches are available from simple door knob covers to top-of-door latches that can be operated {{from both sides of}} the door. Another type of lock is an inexpensive device which can be easily installed into drawers, cabinets, or other openables to prevent easy opening. It consists of a bendable <b>plastic</b> <b>rod</b> with a blunt hook on one side, and is situated on the inside of the drawer or cabinet.|$|E

It consists of a bendable <b>plastic</b> <b>rod</b> with a blunt hook on one side, and is situated {{on the inside of}} the drawer or cabinet. The hook catches on part of the drawer or door and prevents opening unless the rod is bent downward simultaneously to disengage the hook. These devices are helpful to pet owners as well â€” a typical housecat may be able to paw open a cabinet filled with food, but would have trouble operating the hook mechanism. Also available are electromagnetic cabinet locking devices that are activated via remote control.|$|E
50|$|The larger rubber bulbs are {{commonly}} used to draw liquid through a pipette when the reagents are needed in a larger amount. These rubber bulbs will compliment larger pipettes and <b>plastic</b> <b>rods,</b> as the glass will easily break due to uneven pressure distribution.|$|R
50|$|The {{most obvious}} {{difference}} between a Springfree Trampoline and the traditional trampoline design {{is the use of}} glass-reinforced <b>plastic</b> <b>rods</b> instead of steel coil springs.

50|$|Detachable light guides, {{consisting}} of rigid bent <b>plastic</b> <b>rods</b> or semi-rigid or flexible tubes containing optical fibers, {{are available for}} some flashlights for inspection inside tanks, or within walls or structures; when not required the light guide can be removed and the light used for other purposes.|$|R
5000|$|One {{common design}} is the [...] "rod squeegee", and {{consists}} of a hinge-mounted rubber disc {{on the end of}} a <b>plastic</b> <b>rod</b> of sufficient length to reach the full length of the barrel. The rubber washer end is inserted sideways into the barrel, pushed to the bottom and subsequently withdrawn with the rubber disc rotated ninety degrees (so that the disc now touches the inner circumference of the barrel and scrapes the paint out). Such designs often place the hinged disk on an inner cable or rod that is manipulated by a trigger at the other end; by pulling the trigger, the disk is forced to rotate into contact with the barrel surface.|$|E
5000|$|Aliens land in New Jersey, in a mile-long space ship. They request 500 acre {{of level}} ground to erect buildings, and induce humans {{to work for}} them by passing out {{capsules}} that produce a feeling of temporary bliss. The workers are given sticks, each a [...] "light metal or <b>plastic</b> <b>rod,</b> five feet long, with a curved handle and a splayed tip":"When the command 'Go' is heard," [...] said the alien's voice clearly, [...] "you will all proceed directly forward at a slow walking pace, swinging your sticks from side to side."The sticks flatten {{the ground in front of}} the people as they walk. Later the aliens make adjustments in the sticks, and the ground bulges up into walls. Eventually an enormous building takes shape.|$|E
5000|$|Duke Nukem was a {{short-lived}} toy set from defunct toy company ReSaurus. Primarily emphasizing Duke Nukem 3D, the set featured three versions of Duke (with a fourth [...] "Internet only" [...] Duke {{that came with}} a CD-ROM and freezethrower accessory), the Pigcop, Octabrain, and Battlelord. The toys were prone to breakage (Duke's legs were held on by a thin <b>plastic</b> <b>rod</b> which was easy to snap and the Octabrain had numerous fragile points). More toys were planned {{to coincide with the}} release of Duke Nukem Forever, however the game's delay halted production of the toys, and ReSaurus eventually went out of business. At Toyfair 2011, NECA revealed a new series of Duke Nukem Forever action figures with more details and articulation than the previous series from 1997.|$|E
50|$|The smaller rubber bulbs {{are well}} suited with small {{pipettes}} to draw smaller amount of reagents and can attach to both glass, {{as well as}} <b>plastic</b> <b>rods.</b> They are very commonly used for droppers as small sized rubber bulbs help control the amount of drops more precisely.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>plastic</b> welding <b>rod,</b> {{also known}} as a {{thermoplastic}} welding rod, is a rod with circular or triangular cross-section used to bind two pieces of plastic together. They are available {{in a wide range of}} colors to match the base material's color. Spooled <b>plastic</b> welding <b>rod</b> is known as [...] "spline".|$|R
50|$|A 2016 {{undercover}} {{investigation by}} the animal rights organization Compassion Over Killing, showed workers at four separate Tyson processing plants throwing, punching and kicking chickens as well as sticking <b>plastic</b> <b>rods</b> through their beaks. They also wrung birds' necks, ran over them with forklifts and left injured birds in heaping piles to die.|$|R
50|$|Handline (the {{simplest}} and cheapest gear) is {{manually operated}} by one person along the lake beaches {{or on the}} riverbanks. Effective angling is done in calm waters {{early in the morning}} or evening or on dark nights. A set of handlines can also be operated as a trolling gear. This is a prospective commercial fishery on Lake Victoria, Kyoga and Albert, targeting predacious species like Nile Perch and Hydrocynus. Fishing rod or tackle is mechanically operated by one man using a reel fixed on a springy <b>plastic</b> <b>rod.</b> Its mainline is baited with a fish lure. Angling for Lates niloticus on Lake Victoria or for Trout on River Sipi in Kapchorwa District is a lucrative activity particularly for the foreign tourists who adopt this fishing method. This method may use live bait and the catching of bait (immature fish) using small mesh-sized gillnets; seine-nets and fish-trap can be detrimental to the fishery.|$|E
30|$|Laparoscopically, {{some may}} find it {{difficult}} to place the endo-loops at the cornu, though this can be achieved with experience by ensuring proper positioning of the <b>plastic</b> <b>rod</b> before tightening the loop. The procedure should be a lot easier with diathermy (uniploar and bipolar), harmonic scalpel as well as plasmakinetic instruments.|$|E
40|$|Studies were {{initiated}} in 1962 which involved holding {{objects in the}} stomachs of fish for extended periods of time. To accomplish this, {{it was necessary to}} construct a device which would withstand regurgitating actions without inflicting injury, and would not disrupt the normal behavior of the fish. This device consisted of a <b>plastic</b> <b>rod</b> that was attached to the isthmus of the fish and extended down the gullet into the stomach...|$|E
50|$|The toy's {{building}} system consists of interlocking <b>plastic</b> <b>rods,</b> connectors, blocks, gears, wheels, and other components, {{which can be}} pieced {{together to form a}} wide variety of models, machines, and architectural structures. K'Nex is designed for older (5- to 12-year-old) builders, although a larger-sized version, Kid K'Nex, is aimed towards younger children.|$|R
50|$|An {{important}} aspect of <b>plastic</b> welding <b>rod</b> design and manufacture is the porosity of the material. A high porosity will lead to air bubbles (known as voids) in the rods, which decrease {{the quality of the}} welding. The highest quality of <b>plastic</b> welding <b>rods</b> are therefore those with zero porosity, which are called voidless.|$|R
50|$|Inspection {{flashlights}} have permanently mounted light guides containing {{optical fibers}} or <b>plastic</b> <b>rods.</b> Another style has a lamp mounted {{at the end}} of a flexible cable, or a semi-rigid or articulated probe. Such lamps are used for inspection inside tanks, or inside structures such as aircraft. Where used for inspecting the interior of tanks containing flammable liquids, the inspection lights may also be rated as flame-proof (explosion-proof) so that they cannot ignite liquids or vapors.|$|R
40|$|A simple {{hand-held}} {{grinding fixture}} is discussed which can produce microtome mounts of hard materials, oriented interfaces, and powders {{embedded in a}} 5 / 16 -in <b>plastic</b> <b>rod.</b> The device {{has been used for}} the ultramicrotomy of meteorite samples, 10 - 50 micron interplanetary dust particles, and thin films on plastic. Results are presented for a layer lattice silicate from the Murchison carbonaceous chondrite, illustrating the resolution and structural detail that can be obtained with the method...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Beside the {{conventional}} plastic rods, different techniques and materials {{have been proposed}} {{in the last years}} to prevent the loop from retraction into the abdominal cavity. The aim of this retrospective comparative study was to assess three different techniques of loop support. Methods: The study included 65 pa- tients who had loop ileostomy or colostomy formed. Depending on the decision of the operating surgeon, one of three techniques was chosen to fixate the stoma loop: an epicutaneous <b>plastic</b> <b>rod</b> (group 1, n = 14), an epicutaneous suture-fixated silicone drain (group 2, n = 27), or a subcutaneous silicone drain (group 3, n = 24). Results: The majority of patients (85 %) received loop ileostomy. Pain intensity was significantly (p = 0. 0014) different among the three groups. A total of 19 patients (30 %) suffered a complication. There was a tendency towards less complications if the stoma was secured by a silicone drain with epicutaneous fixation. Comfort with stoma care was significantly different, with group 3 experiencing the best results. Conclusions: Using a subcutaneously tunnelled silicon drain as a stoma bridge results in less complications, less pain and higher satisfaction as compared to {{the conventional}} <b>plastic</b> <b>rod.</b> Conventional plastic rods should be avoided...|$|E
40|$|An {{apparatus}} {{consisting of}} 2 silver ring electrodes {{attached to a}} <b>plastic</b> <b>rod</b> and connected to a tran-sistor indicator {{was used to measure}} electrical im-pedance changes in the vagina of rats. A statistically significant increase in electrical impedance occurred at proestrus. By determining when this peak occurs, the optimal time for pairing can be established. In paired animals the absence of the peak provides a reliable means of diagnosing pregnancy. A relationship between the electrical resistance of the vaginal mucous membrane and mucus and indi-vidual phases of the oestrous cycle in farm animals has been described by several authors includin...|$|E
5000|$|Less-toxic modern {{imitations of}} bubble lights {{are made from}} acrylic or other clear <b>plastic</b> <b>rods,</b> with {{permanent}} bubbles deliberately manufactured into them, lit with fixed-color or color-changing LEDs. Other bubbling lights are much larger and sit on a table or floor, occasionally with fake fish which [...] "swim" [...] {{up and down as}} they change buoyancy. These tubes are usually filled with distilled water, and have one or more airstones at the bottom, and normally a light, along with an air pump.|$|R
5000|$|A [...] "parallel synthesis" [...] {{method was}} {{developed}} by Mario Geysen and his colleagues for preparation of peptide arrays. They synthesized 96 peptides on <b>plastic</b> <b>rods</b> (pins) coated at their ends with the solid support. The pins were immersed into the solution of reagents placed in the wells of a microtiter plate. The method is widely applied particularly by using automatic parallel synthesizers. Although the parallel method is much slower than the real combinatorial one, its advantage {{is that it is}} exactly known which peptide or other compound forms on each pin.|$|R
5000|$|Several {{designs of}} cable are used. In one type, small plastic tubes each {{containing}} {{up to eight}} fibers are filled with a gel compound, and stranded around <b>plastic</b> <b>rods.</b> The hydrocarbon gel compound prevents water from wicking {{along the length of}} the cable. The inner structure is wrapped with polyester tapes and encased in a pultruded glass reinforced plastic tube, which provides the structural strength for the cable. An outer sheath is applied to protect the strength member from ultraviolet light and from damage due to leakage current.|$|R
