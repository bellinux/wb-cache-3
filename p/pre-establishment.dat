The multipath rout-ing scheme consists of an algorithm to determine a set of multiple disjoint or partially disjoint paths and a mechanism for distributing traffic over a multipath route to reduce the traffic load on a congested link. The algorithm for finding multipath routes is based on shortest path routing and does not require <b>pre-establishment</b> of paths or support for source routing. The mechanism for multipath traffic distribution is triggered at a node when the average load on an outgoing link exceeds a threshold. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed congestion-triggered multipath routing scheme can effectively improve network performance by exploiting routing redundancies inherent in the network topology.

Simulation results show that our alternate path-finding algorithms are effective in improving reliability of explicit routing. In addition, all calculated paths respect QoS latency constraints.

Accounting for spatial dependence {{in the formation of}} bilateral investment treaties (BITs) and preferential trade agreements (PTAs) that contain investment provisions, we find that the increase in agreements with stricter provisions on investor-state dispute settlement and <b>pre-establishment</b> national treatment is a contagious process. Specifically, a developing country is more likely to sign an agreement with weak investment provisions if other developing countries that compete for FDI from the same developed country have previously signed agreements with similarly weak provisions. Conversely, contagion in agreements with strong provisions exclusively derives from agreements with strong provisions that other FDI-competing developing countries have previously signed with a specific developed source country of FDI...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn {{the last}} decade, {{international}} investment {{law has been}} on a trajectory of rapid evolution with reform high on agenda priorities. Reform requires a reconciliation of competing interests, which is generally so difficult to achieve that it is often unclear whether an option constitutes 'reform' or unwanted change. Two specific treaty provisions, the most-favoured-nation (MFN) treatment and survival clauses, can interfere with the reform process and become an impediment to changing the rules of the game. This is particularly true when political will is present. The MFN treatment, a guarantee of non-discrimination present in the quasi-totality of investment treaties, can have far-reaching ramifications for newly negotiated provisions, especially where international investment agreements confer <b>pre-establishment</b> rights and a clause expressly covers 'all matters' within a treaty. Survival clauses, a type of provision that extends the validity of an investment agreement beyond its termination, can delay the onset of the new options for an average of between five and twenty years after expiry of the treaty's minimum period of application. This article explores these two types of clauses and discusses their potential impact on the reform of international investment law...|$|E

In particular, we develop the model of a reactive jammer, parameterize it with varying levels of ability, and use this model to analyze three proposed keyless jamming mitigation techniques. We show that many of the uncoordinated spread spectrum schemes are infeasible for realistic computational powers and allocations of bandwidth even if the attacker simply uses commercial-off-the-shelf equipment. We also show that the third scheme, BBC codes, is vulnerable to a mark-cancellation-and-insertion attack. In particular, we show how an attacker can use multiple sinusoids to ???search??? for a cancellation signal over the space of phase and channel condition. We also propose modifications to improve the BBC codes, which can provide more robust jamming resistance with plausible system bandwidth requirements...|$|E

Prepositioning of assets may include the expansion of warehouses, medical facilities, and temporary shelters, while infrastructure preparation may include provision of airstrips and ramp space at the airfields.

The first paper examined the <b>pre-establishment</b> period before the program commenced in 1975 and the establishment from 1975 to 1978. This paper describes a 20 -year span from 1979 to 1999 that the authors have termed the Consolidation Period. This period commenced with the first graduating classes from the new program in 1979 and ended with the resignation and departure from the program of Professor Andries Kleynhans in December 1999. During the period the ICC program cemented its relationship with Preston Institute, which underwent merger in 1982 to become Phillip Institute, which in turn underwent merger in 1992 to become RMIT University. All student places in the program became funded by government in 1982, and in 1984 the ACCE granted full unconditional member status to the program. In 1986 ACCE achieved reciprocity with CCE, and this led to the status of full international equivalency for the program. In retrospect, the 20 -year Consolidation Period was a roller-coaster ride with highs such as accreditation, postgraduate students and the establishment of the Japan program, and lows that largely centred on staff workloads, an environment of constant change, and a sense of disempowerment and isolation from decision-making at many levels that affected the program...|$|E

The theory also states that if an element from an equivalence class conflicts with a programmed reinforcement contingency, the conflicting element will {{drop out of the}} equivalence class. Minster et al. (2006) found evidence suggesting that a conflicting element does not drop out of an equivalence class. In an effort to explain maintained accuracy on programmed reinforcement contingencies, the authors seem to suggest that participants will behave in accordance with a particular partitioning of the equivalence class which continues to include the conflicting element. This hypothesis seems to explain their data well, but their particular procedures are not a good test of the notion of "dropping out" due to the <b>pre-establishment</b> of equivalence classes before the conflicting member entered the class. The current experiment first developed unpartitioned equivalence classes and only later exposed participants to reinforcement contingencies that conflicted with pre-established equivalence classes. The results are consistent with the notion that a partition developed such that the conflicting element had dropped out of certain subclasses of the original equivalence class.

30|$|The early widely {{proposed}} handover delay reduction schemes {{are based}} on host-based mobility management schemes [4]. In particular, Mobile IPv 6 (MIPv 6) [5] extensions, Hierarchical MIPv 6 (HMIPv 6) [6] and Fast Handover for MIPv 6 (FMIPv 6) [7], have been proposed as experimental protocols by IETF to improve handover performance {{in the next generation}} networks with IPv 6 nodes. HMIPv 6 localizes handover binding registration while FMIPv 6 performs address preconfiguration and tunnel <b>pre-establishment</b> in an effort to reduce handover delay and packet loss. When used on its own in an end-to-end approach, the basic MIPv 6 suffers large handover latencies due to the end-to-end signaling. Thus, HMIPv 6 and FMIPv 6 are utilized to optimize MIPv 6 's performance in terms of reducing the handover delay and hence service degradation during the handover process. Generally, the main goal of localized mobility management protocols, for example, HMIPv 6, is to reduce handover delay by localizing registration hence reducing end-to-end delay so that seamless service continuity can be achieved. Unfortunately, since host-based mobility management schemes involve the mobile node (MN) in mobility-related signaling, they introduce more delay especially when the home agent (or its peers) is far away from the MN. Furthermore, they result in high packet loss, signaling overhead, power consumption, and extensive MIPv 6 functionality in the IPv 6 protocol stack [4]. Thus, there are still some challenges pertaining to reducing handover delay with the widely proposed host-based localized mobility management schemes.|$|E
40|$|It {{is often}} a {{challenge}} to successfully establish perennial pastures which in turn determines the production potential and persistence thereof. Three perennial subtropical grass species commonly cultivated in South Africa are Eragrostis curvula (var. Ermelo), Digitaria eriantha (var. Irene) and Chloris gayana (var. Katambora). The secret of successful planted pastures lies in the execution of good seed- and soil preparation techniques; {{also referred to as}} <b>pre-establishment</b> techniques. These techniques include: seed conditioning by coating seed with either conventional coating or a coating that contains Mycortex, that differs in only adding mycorhizza; adjusting the seeding rates recommended by industry which potentially causes intra-species competition (competition between plants of the same species); planting an annual nurse crop with a perennial species which potentially causes inter-species competition (competition between plants of different species); and controlling seedbed qualities before planting and consolidating the seedbed after planting. There were four experiments conducted (Randomized Block Design) in a controlled environment of a Phytotron. In these experiments the growth factors like water, temperature and soil variance were controlled. It must be kept in mind that conclusions made from data obtained in these experiments cannot be extrapolated to field conditions. Digitaria eriantha and C. gayana were only assessed in two small experiments as uncoated and coated (conventionally- and Mycortex coated) seed. Eragrostis curvula was measured in two experiments as uncoated and conventionally coated seed and was also evaluated at different seeding rates, planted with and without an annual nurse crop (Eragrostis tef) and where seedbed consolidation was done after planting. The treatments were replicated between three and six times in the four experiments. It was found that coated seed does not significantly improve establishment of any of the test species. Adapting the E. curvula seeding rate had no significant effect because of the favourable environment created. Consolidating the seedbed caused a lower emergence and yield of E. curvula {{as a result of an}} anaerobic condition being generated around the seed. The nurse crop planted with E. curvula caused an increased yield in the first season. <b>Pre-establishment</b> techniques applied as treatments in these controlled experiments were not as effective as hypothesized in a controlled environment. There were three field experiments conducted (Randomized Block Design) in uncontrolled environments. Establishment success of test species were evaluated as a response to variable seeding rate treatments, of uncoated and conventionally coated seed; additionally, D. eriantha and C. gayana Mycortex coated seed was also used. The establishment success of the perennial test species was also measured as being influenced by an annual nurse crop (Eragrostis tef). The experiment included the evaluation of establishment success of E. curvula where seedbed quality was controlled through preparation techniques; rotavating before planting and consolidating the seedbed after planting. It was concluded that a higher seeding rate gives a better first season plant density. However, in season two, the optimum plant density was reached for E. curvula and C. gayana and there were no differences between seeding rate treatments. This was as a result of intra-species competition in season one, resulting in plants out-competing one another. The creeping growth characteristics of C. gayana also contributed to this result. One of the main functions of the nurse crop planted with a perennial grass species is to create a more “favourable” competition as opposed to aggressive competition from weeds. The establishment success of perennial species was lower, where nurse crops were included as a result of inter-species competition. From the second season data it can be seen that D. eriantha and C. gayana did not have lower plant densities where a nurse crop was planted, whereas E. curvula still had lower plant densities. All species had a significantly higher pasture density in season one where uncoated seed was used due to a higher number of seed planted at the same seeding rates on a weight basis. Nevertheless, in season two, the E. curvula and C. gayana plant densities showed no significant differences between the seed conditioning treatments. This is attributed to the small seed size and shape of E. curvula and the creeping growth characteristics of C. gayana. Controlling the seedbed quality was found to be unsuccessful for E. curvula. The field experiment results highlight the interactive effects between seed coatings, seeding rates and nurse crop treatments as a function of selected species. The insignificant results obtained from the controlled environment study support the original hypothesis that favourable growing conditions reduce the functions of <b>pre-establishment</b> techniques during the facilitated establishment of sown pasture seed. The significant results from the unfavourable field study support the original hypothesis that adjusting the seeding rates and the use of a nurse crop does have significant effects on the establishment success of the perennial species. It also confirms that conditioning of seed by using coating substances does have significant effects on the establishment success of the perennial species. Controlling the seedbed quality does not have significant effects where pastures are irrigated until establishment.
