50|$|When {{the left}} {{ventricle}} contracts (systole), <b>pressure</b> rises <b>in</b> the left ventricle. When the <b>pressure</b> <b>in</b> the left ventricle {{rises above the}} <b>pressure</b> <b>in</b> the aorta, the aortic valve opens, allowing blood to exit the left ventricle into the aorta. When ventricular systole ends, <b>pressure</b> <b>in</b> the left ventricle rapidly drops. When the <b>pressure</b> <b>in</b> the left ventricle decreases, the aortic pressure forces the aortic valve to close. The closure of the aortic valve contributes the A2 component of the second heart sound (S2).|$|R

50|$|The {{pulmonary}} valve (sometimes {{referred to}} as the pulmonic valve) is the semilunar valve of the heart that lies between the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery and has three cusps. Similar to the aortic valve, the pulmonary valve opens in ventricular systole, when the <b>pressure</b> <b>in</b> the right ventricle rises above the <b>pressure</b> <b>in</b> the pulmonary artery. At the end of ventricular systole, when the <b>pressure</b> <b>in</b> the right ventricle falls rapidly, the <b>pressure</b> <b>in</b> the pulmonary artery will close the pulmonary valve.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>pressure</b> <b>in</b> {{the right}} {{ventricle}} tries {{to open the}} pulmonary valve. The <b>pressure</b> <b>in</b> the pulmonary artery tries to close the pulmonary valve.

To decrease <b>pressure</b> <b>in</b> the reactor coolant system, sprays of relatively cool water are turned on inside the pressurizer, lowering the coolant temperature in the pressurizer and thereby lowering the pressure.|$|R

2500|$|Physiologically, in {{individuals}} with a normally functioning aortic valve, the valve is only open when the <b>pressure</b> <b>in</b> the left ventricle {{is higher than the}} <b>pressure</b> <b>in</b> the aorta.
