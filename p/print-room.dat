I day say Robin never saw it either; and what a treat {{it will be to}} take you to the Egyptian Gallery!' cried Honora, excited into looking at the {{expedition}} in the light of a party of pleasure, as she saw happiness beaming in the young face opposite.|$|E
50|$|A {{finished}} drawing {{is in the}} Landesgalerie, Budapest, reproduced in Handzeichnungen der Albertlna, 286. A study in red chalk is in the Berlin <b>Print-room,</b> reproduced by Lippmann and Hofstede de Groot, 20. A chalk study for the Susanna {{is also in the}} Berlin <b>Print-room,</b> reproduced by Lippmann, 197. Several pen-and-ink studies for the elder in front were in the collection of J. P. Heseltine (HdG. 986 and 1021).|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} Parkinson's small {{theatrical}} portraits were engraved. Some {{of the original}} drawings for these went to the Burney collection of theatrical portraits in the <b>print-room</b> at the British Museum.|$|E
50|$|Pye {{formed a}} {{collection}} of impressions of Turner's Liber Studiorum, which went to the <b>print-room</b> of the British Museum; his notes on the subject, edited by John Lewis Roget, were published in 1879.|$|E
50|$|A {{portrait}} of Scott, drawn by John Jackson R.A. in 1823, was engraved by William Thomas Fry {{and published in}} 1826. A crayon portrait by his son went to the <b>print-room</b> of the British Museum.|$|E
5000|$|Gladys Hudgell (née Taylor), a half-gypsy <b>print-room</b> {{girl who}} was always getting in trouble for 'practical jokes and general cheekiness' and who was almost sacked {{on a number of}} occasions, only keeping her job through her value to the factory {{athletics}} team.|$|E
50|$|A view of Wanstead House by {{this artist}} was {{engraved}} by Picot in 1775; also after him are {{a set of}} views of castles and other subjects taken {{in different parts of}} Essex. In the <b>print-room</b> of the British Museum, there is a large pen drawing by him of Richmond Bridge in 1778.|$|E
50|$|Read etched his own {{portrait}} from a water-colour sketch by John Linnell (1819). A short {{catalogue of}} the etchings was printed at Salisbury in 1832. An exhaustive manuscript catalogue, with a memoir of the artist, compiled (1871-4) by his son, Raphael W. Read, F.R.C.S., went to the <b>print-room</b> at the British Museum.|$|E
5000|$|He {{came home}} {{delighted with the}} treasures which he had seen, worked laboriously for a higher {{examination}} and passed as [...] "docent" [...] in aesthetics and art history. In 1829 he was made {{professor at the university}} of Berlin. In 1833 GF Waagen accepted him as assistant in the museum of the Prussian capital; and in 1858 he was promoted to the directorship of the Berlin <b>print-room.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Although {{the duty}} on news {{was the most}} invidious “tax on knowledge”, the heavy duty on paper had a malign effect on {{newspaper}} economics. The Fourdrinier process produced paper on a continuous reel. The efficiency of [...] "web printing" [...] that this promised was thwarted by the Stamp Office’s insistence on stamping the paper in sheet form. Although this was good for <b>print-room</b> workers, the advantages for Fleet Street were delayed by 50 years.|$|E
5000|$|The {{earliest}} pictures {{assigned to}} him by some are altar-pieces with the monogram H. B. interlaced, and the date of 1496, in the monastery chapel of Lichtenthal near Baden-Baden. Another early work is {{a portrait of the}} emperor Maximilian, drawn in 1501 on a leaf of a sketch-book now in the <b>print-room</b> at Karlsruhe. [...] "The Martyrdom of St Sebastian and the Epiphany" [...] (now Berlin, 1507), were painted for the market-church of Halle in Saxony.|$|E
50|$|A younger brother, Émile (1857-1906), {{became an}} {{assistant}} in the <b>print-room</b> at the Bibliothèque Nationale, and afterwards joined {{the staff at}} the Musée du Louvre, of which he eventually became keeper, retiring in 1902. He was a well-known connoisseur of art. He organized the famous Exposition rétrospective held at the Petit Palais in 1900, and published a number of expert volumes on enamels, ceramics and furniture. His work of 1886 on Renaissance plaquettes essentially defined the form as it is understood today.|$|E
50|$|Tatham, who was {{member of}} the Academy of St. Luke at Rome, of the Institute of Bologna, and of the Architects' Society of London, left behind him copious reminiscences which had not been {{published}} by 1895. Also around 1895, a portrait of Tatham by Thomas Kearsley was in possession of his grandson, the Rev. Canon Richmond, and recently purchased at Sotheby's by his twice great-great-great grandson William Rann Kennedy. Also a large crayon portrait by Benjamin Robert Haydon was in the <b>print-room</b> of the British Museum.|$|E
5000|$|His British Mezzotinto Portraits … with Biographical Notes (London, 1878-84, 4 pts.) {{consists}} of a full catalogue of plates executed before 1820, with 125 autotypes from plates in Smith's possession. The latter were also issued separately. This [...] "remains the definitive catalogue of the subject". The <b>print-room</b> at the British Museum contains an interleaved copy with manuscript notes. Smith was a collector of engravings, principally mezzotints, which were sold {{after the completion of}} his book in sales between 1887 and 1896. Some 300 of them, especially those by Irish printmakers, were purchased for the National Gallery of Ireland in Dublin through Sir Edward Guinness, and the British Museum bought 106.|$|E
50|$|His {{portraits in}} oil and pastel enjoyed some vogue, his first {{reputation}} was made by his miniature portraits. In middle life his most popular work consisted of heads in blacklead pencil, for which he charged two guineas; leaders of fashionable society employed him to make these drawing. Later he concentrated his energies on etching {{in the style of}} Rembrandt, using a dry-needle with triangular point. He copied some of Rembrandt's prints, among them the artist's portrait of himself and the hundred-guelder plate. An etching after Rembrandt's portrait of Sir John Astley was described by Horace Walpole as Worlidge's ‘best piece.’ Worlidge drew a pencil portrait of himself, which is reproduced in Walpole's Anecdotes (edition by Ralph Nicholson Wornum). Examples of Worlidge's drawings and etchings are in the British Museum <b>print-room.</b> There is also there a priced catalogue of a selection of his etchings.|$|E
50|$|His {{earliest}} etching, the 'Head of Windermere,' {{dates from}} 1864. After some early experiments in etching and engraving Finnie adopted mezzotint as his favourite process in 1886. Though he exhibited pictures at the Royal Academy from 1861 onwards, and {{also at the}} British Institution and in Suffolk Street, he was best known in London by his original mezzotint engravings of landscape, exhibited at the Royal Academy and the Royal Society of Painters, Etchers, and Engravers, of which he became an associate on 24 October 1887, and a fellow on 6 April 1895. He sent forty-seven contributions in all to the society's gallery. His etchings and mezzotints, which are represented by specimens in the <b>print-room</b> of the British Museum, aim too much at a full pictorial effect, instead of observing the restrictions of graphic art. As a painter he is represented in the Walker Art Gallery at Liverpool. He also exhibited at the Society of British Artists which {{he was elected to}} in 1884, the Dudley Gallery, the New Gallery, the Royal Institute of Oil Painters and Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours, the Royal Society of Artists in Birmingham, Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts, the Royal Scottish Academy, and Manchester City Art Gallery. Finnie also exhibited at the Salon Artistes Français and received a commendation in 1896. He joined the Royal Cambrian Academy in 1894 and became its treasurer in 1897.|$|E
