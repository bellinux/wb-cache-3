With a rapid production cycle time of less than 24 hours the mold for a particular patient will produce a uniquely customized PD-AFO, while we are creating a new tool for each patient our ply patterns {{are designed to be}} universal across all ankle-foot shapes and stored as a lookup table in a <b>ply</b> <b>book.</b> My focus for this program is to develop the universal ankle foot models which are the foundation {{for the development of the}} universal plies to be cataloged as part of a <b>ply</b> <b>book.</b> This all leads to the question can a universal model set be established to meet the needs of the 1 st to 99 th percentile of the population of the United States Army.

40|$|Carbon fiber {{reinforced}} plastics (CFRPs) {{have been widely}} applied in modern wide-body aircrafts, {{but they are also}} increasingly interesting for structural parts in single-aisle aircrafts. So far CFRPs failed to get into single-aisle aircrafts on a great scale for cost reasons. To be able to compete with metal based solutions it is necessary to consider alternative production technologies for CFRPs as well as to optimize established cost intensive production processes. To address these challenges the Center for Lightweight Production Technology (ZLP) at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in Augsburg investigates production technologies for carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastics (CFRTPs). The complete process chain, from <b>ply</b> <b>book</b> generation to assembly, is investigated regarding automation and optimization potentials. A generic skin segment has been chosen as demonstrator geometry. Several solutions like automated preforming, Out-of-Autoclave vacuum consolidation as well as automated electrical resistance welding are developed to build a competitive process chain. The process costs for each step are evaluated and the most cost intensive production steps are identified. It can be shown that automated production of CFRTP parts may also be suitable for larger structural parts. Remaining tasks are identified and outlined in order to benefit from all major advantages of thermoplastic material...|$|E
40|$|M (Mechanical Engineering), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 The AHRLAC {{aircraft}} is a {{high performance}} light aircraft that is developed and manufactured in South Africa by Aerosud ITC in partnership with Paramount. This aircraft {{is the first of}} its kind to originate from South Africa. The aircraft has a twin boom, tandem pilot seating configuration, with a Pratt and Whitney turbine-propeller engine in a pusher configuration. The main structure of the aircraft is a conventional metallic structure, while the fairings and some secondary structures are composite. This study will focus on the design and development of the composite ventral fin of the first prototype aircraft, the experimental demonstrator model (XDM). It is crucial to ensure that the ventral fin can function safely within the design requirements of the aircraft under the loads which the fin is likely to encounter. Preceding the design process, a critical overview of composite materials used in aircraft applications is provided. This will include the materials, manufacturing methods, analysis and similar work done in this field of study. The literature will be used in the study for decision-making and validation of proven concepts and methodologies. The first part of this study entailed choosing a suitable composite material and manufacturing method for this specific application. The manufacturing method and materials used had to suit the aircraft prototype application. The limitations of using composite materials were researched as to recognize bad practice and limit design flaws on the ventral fin. Once the material and manufacturing methods were chosen, ventral fin concepts were evaluated using computer aided finite element analysis (FEA) with mass, stiffness and strength being the main parameters of concern. The load cases used in this evaluation were given by the lead structural engineer and aerodynamicist. The calculations of these loads are not covered in detail in this study. The FEA input material properties used, were determined by material testing by the relevant test methods. The ventral fin concept started as the minimal design with the lowest mass. The deflections, composite failure and fastener failure were then evaluated against the required values. The concept was modified by adding stiffening elements, such as ribs and spars, until satisfactory results were obtained. In this way a minimal mass component is designed and verified that it can adequately perform its designed tasks under the expected load conditions. Each part used in the ventral fin assembly was not individually optimized for mass, but rather the assembly as a whole. The final concept was modelled using the computer aided design software, CATIA. This model used in combination with a <b>ply</b> <b>book</b> made it possible to manufacture the ventral fin in a repeatable manner. A test ventral fin was manufactured using the selected materials and manufacturing methods to validate the design methodology. In the next step the selected load cases were used in static testing to validate the FEM through comparison. The result of the study is a composite ventral fin of which the mass, stiffness and strength are suitable to perform its function safely on the first prototype AHRLAC aircraft. The study concludes on the process followed from material selection to FEA and detail design, in order for this same method to be used on other AHRLAC XDM composite parts. Master...|$|E

6000|$|It {{is surely}} beyond {{a doubt that}} people should be a good deal idle in youth. For though here and there a Lord Macaulay may escape from school honours with all his wits about him, most boys pay so dear for their medals that they never {{afterwards}} have a shot in their locker, and begin the world bankrupt. And the same holds true during all the time a lad is educating himself, or suffering others to educate him. It must have been a very foolish old gentleman who addressed Johnson at Oxford in these words: [...] "Young man, <b>ply</b> your <b>book</b> diligently now, and acquire a stock of knowledge; for when years come upon you, you will find that poring upon books will be but an irksome task." [...] The old gentleman seems to have been unaware that many other things besides reading grow irksome, and not a few become impossible, by the time a man has to use spectacles and cannot walk without a stick. Books are good enough in their own way, but they are a mighty bloodless substitute for life. It seems a pity to sit, like the Lady of Shalott, peering into a mirror, with your back turned on all the bustle and glamour of reality. And if a man reads very hard, as the old anecdote reminds us, he will have little time for thought.|$|R
