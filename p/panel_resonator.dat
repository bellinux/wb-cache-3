40|$|The {{subject of}} the present PhD Thesis is the low {{frequency}} sound field in small enclosed spaces under Schroeder frequency, and it’s goal is {{the elimination of the}} low frequency sound coloration over expanded audience areas. For this purpose, a Methodology for Acoustic Analysis with Finite Elements, which implements the technique of <b>panel</b> <b>resonator</b> sound absorbers, is proposed,. An Application Software for Acoustic Analyses with Finite Elements was developed as a tool of implementation of the Methodology. With the help of simulations of the software, the numerical accuracy of the Finite Elements in acoustic analysis was tested, and the performance of the control mechanisms of the modal resonances of enclosed sound field was studied. Finally, the methodology was applied experimentally to a case study, involving the acoustic adaptation of a sound recording and production control room. The results of the Methodology were verified and the operation of the Software was certified through the application of new acoustic measurement methods. Also, in the present PhD Thesis the phenomenon of the low frequency sound coloration was analyzed, the various techniques dealing with the problem were presented, the main elements of wave theory underlying low frequency sound field were formulated, {{and the use of the}} Finite Element Method in acoustics was described. The proposed methodology helps to tackle the low frequency sound coloration problem, while the software adds flexibility and ease on application of the Finite Element Method in acoustic problems in closed rooms. The combination of the Methodology and the Software in the experiment was reliable and effective. ...|$|E
40|$|Problem {{statement}} Sports teachers (and other users) often {{suffer from}} bad acoustics in sports halls. A survey revealed that most complaints are about tiredness, throat problems and hearing problems. Bad acoustics in sports halls are {{mainly caused by}} an uneven distribution of the sound absorbing material in a hall. Often, the roof absorbs most of the sound where the floor and walls up to 3 meter reflect most of the sound. This {{lower part of the}} walls needs to be strong, flat and hard to rebound balls. In this way, vertically reflected sound is being absorbed faster than horizontally reflected sound. This difference causes sagging Schroeder curves and therefore long reverberation times. Dutch standards for acoustics are mainly based on reverberation times, so sagging curves are unwanted. Besides the problem of the long reverberation times, another problem is found. Measurements show that sports halls constructed with stone-like materials absorb sound according to the expectations of the material properties. Sports halls constructed with perforated steel sound absorbing panels give different results. These panels seem to behave differently on sound absorption than expected. Especially low frequencies seem to be absorbed extremely well by the panels. The research question therefore is: ‘Why do perforated steel sound absorbing panels seem to behave differently in absorption coefficient in sports halls than expected from laboratory test results?’ Because this question is part of the larger subject ‘acoustics in sports halls’, it is necessary to investigate the acoustical behaviour of perforated steel panels for a broad demarcation of the subject. Approach In order to find an answer to the research question, two hypotheses are tested by measurements. The measurements are done in a laboratory and in a scale model. The results are analysed. The conclusions give insight in the sound absorbing behaviour of perforated steel sound absorbing panels. Besides that, the conclusions give guidelines to the design phase of this graduation project. Hypotheses: 1. A perforated steel panel behaves differently in practice than in a laboratory situation on absorption coefficient because the shape of the panels causes sound absorption of parallel striking sound based on a phase shift principle. 2. A perforated steel panel behaves differently in practice than in a laboratory situation on absorption coefficient because the backing construction has influence on the result. Laboratory measurements Absorption coefficient measurements are done in the reverberation room of the acoustical laboratory. Different samples of the roof structure are tested. By comparing the results, we get insight in the influence of different parts of the roof structure. Besides that, hypothesis one can be tested: the influence of the backing construction will become clear. Scale model measurements The scale model makes it possible to test the influence of different shaped roof structures in a small model. By using the same, reflecting material for all walls, we get insight in the influence of changes in roof shapes. Some of the roof structures are (partly) covered with a sound absorbing material to compare the results of those to the other variations. This research should give an answer to hypothesis two. Results The scale model measurement results show that profiled structures cause a considerable decrease in local sound pressure compared to a hard, flat surface. This decrease is largest for low frequencies. The surface with sound absorbing material on top causes the biggest decrease, which is caused by the sound absorption of the facing material. The ‘sound absorption by shape’ is caused by the phenomena of diffusion and interference. It is not visible in reverberation times (T 20), just in histograms and Schroeder curves. The laboratory measurements show that the influence of the thermal insulation layer; a part of the backing construction, is large on (low frequent) sound absorption. The rock wool panels give a high peak in the sound absorption graph for 100 Hz. This very good sound absorption is probably caused by the panel being its own panel-resonator and porous absorber in one. The influence of the ‘cannelurevulling’ is small, like the influence of the vapour barrier and different perforation degrees. Conclusions Perforated steel sound absorbing panels absorb more low frequent sound than expected. This good sound absorption is probably achieved by the profiled shape of the steel panels in combination with the backing thermal insulation. The profiled shape causes the effect of sound absorption caused by the effects of diffusion and interference. The backing construction absorbs {{a large part of the}} low frequent sound because the hard, stiff and heavy rock wool panels are probably a porous material and <b>panel</b> <b>resonator</b> in one. The research does not give strong guidelines to improve the roof structure. The gained knowledge is used in the design of a wall panel. The walls up to three meters are still the weakest link when talking about acoustics in sports halls. The designed panel should improve this situation.

40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this study is to develop {{improved}} models for the acoustic impedance of treatment panels at high frequencies, for application to subscale treatment designs.

40|$|An {{analytical}} and test program {{was conducted to}} evaluate means for increasing the effectiveness of low frequency sound absorbing liners for aircraft turbine engines. Three schemes for coupling low frequency absorber elements were considered. These schemes were analytically modeled and their impedance was predicted over a frequency range of 50 to 1, 000 Hz.

40|$|When a {{panel is}} excited, either {{structurally}} or acoustically, sound is radiated from the panel. Previous {{research by the}} author has shown that tuned acoustic tube resonators {{can be used to}} reduce the radiated sound. A one-dimensional analytical model model was validated by exper-iments in an impedance tube and good agree-ment was found between model and measure-ments. In this paper, the model is extended to describe the sound transmitted through a <b>panel</b> with acoustic <b>resonators.</b> Two different configu-rations are examined: panels with tubes and per-forated sandwich panels. To verify whether the one-dimensional analytical models give a good prediction of the sound transmission loss, panels of both configurations were tested. Sound trans-mission loss measurements were performed by means of the sound intensity method (ISO 15186 - 1). The measurements showed that the resonators indeed increased the transmission loss compared with the mass law, in the frequency range for which the resonators were tuned. However, the increase was not as large as predicted by the one-dimensional model. Resonators can be applied for various structural parts of an aircraft through which the transmission of sound has to be re-duced. The research is performed as part of th...|$|R
40|$|Noise is a {{frequently}} encountered {{problem in}} modern society. One of the environments where {{the presence of}} noise causes a deterioration in people’s comfort is in aircraft cabins. For modern aircraft flying at cruise conditions, the main sound source is the turbulent boundary layer around the fuselage. Especially in the mid and high frequency range (500 - 2000 Hz), this source significantly contributes to the sound levels in the aircraft cabin. Passive noise reduction methods can provide a suitable solution to many noise problems in this frequency range. In the present study, a new passive noise reduction method is presented, known as tube resonators. Tube resonators are well-known for their application for sound absorption. However, in the present work, this type of resonator is applied for the reduction of sound radiation and sound transmission. The aim of this work is to investigate the applicability of this new method and to develop and validate efficient models for the prediction of sound radiation by and sound transmission through <b>panels</b> with tube <b>resonators.</b> For a proper understanding of the influences of the different phenomena, different models and experiments are presented in order of increasing complexity...|$|R

To select composition for {tau}{sub f} adjustment, {tau}{sub f} compensating materials with different amount of titanates were formulated, synthesized, and characterized. Chemical interactions and physical compatibility between the {tau}{sub f} modifiers and the host LTCC dielectrics were investigated. Studies on stripline (SL) <b>resonator</b> <b>panels</b> with multiple compensating dielectrics revealed that: 1) compositions using SrTiO{sub 3 } provide the largest {tau}{sub f} adjustment among titanates, 2) the {tau}{sub f} compensation {{is proportional to the}} amount of SrTiO{sub 3 } in compensating materials, as well as the thickness of the compensating layer, and 3) the most effective {tau}{sub f} compensation is achieved when the compensating dielectric is integrated next to the SL.

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} is to better {{understand}} the effect of structurally integrated resonators on the transmission loss of a sandwich panel. The sandwich panel has facesheets over a corrugated core, which creates long aligned chambers that run parallel to the facesheets. When ports are introduced through the facesheet, the long chambers within the core can be used as low-frequency acoustic resonators. By integrating the resonators within the structure they contribute to the static load bearing capability of the panel while also attenuating noise. An analytical model of a <b>panel</b> with embedded <b>resonators</b> is derived and compared with numerical simulations. Predictions show that acoustic resonators can significantly improve the transmission loss of the sandwich panel around the natural frequency of the resonators. In one configuration with 0. 813 m long internal chambers, the diffuse field transmission loss is improved by more than 22 dB around 104 Hz. The benefit is achieved with no added mass or volume relative to the baseline structure. The embedded resonators are effective because they radiate sound out-of-phase with the structure. This results in destructive interference, which leads to less transmitted sound power...|$|R
40|$|The EU project FACE (Friendly Aircraft Cabin Environment) aims {{to improve}} the {{environmental}} comfort in aircraft cabins. As part of this project, this paper focuses on the reduction of noise in aircraft cabins. For modern aircraft flying at cruise conditions, this cabin noise {{is known to be}} dominated by turbulent boundary layer noise. The purpose of this work is to reduce the resulting sound pressure levels in the cabin by means of optimised sound absorbing trim <b>panels</b> with quarter-wave <b>resonators.</b> Sound absorption with quarter-wave resonators is mainly realised by dissipation of sound energy as a result of viscous and thermal losses. The viscothermal wave propagation of the air inside the resonators is efficiently and accurately described by the so-called low reduced frequency model. By optimisation of the dimensions of the resonators, desired sound absorption characteristics can be obtained for different specified frequency ranges. This means that the panels can be tailored to different positions in the aircraft cabin with different prevailing sound pressure levels. Results of optimisations for various frequency ranges show that a very good agreement is obtained between the desired and the calculated absorption curves. With the same optimisation procedure, panels have also been tuned for the dominant frequency range of a sound spectrum measured in a modern aircraft. Experimental validation of the numerically predicted optimal configurations, by means of impedance tube measurements, shows that a fairly good agreement is obtained between the numerical and experimental results...|$|R
