25|$|After observing in {{southern}} Italy the highest concentration of centenarians in the world, Keys hypothesized that a Mediterranean-style diet low in animal fat protected {{against heart disease}} and that a diet high in animal fats led to heart disease. The results of what later {{became known as the}} Seven Countries Study appeared to show that serum cholesterol was strongly related to coronary heart disease mortality both at the population and at the individual level. As a result, in 1956 representatives of the American Heart Association appeared on television to inform people that a diet which included large amounts of butter, lard, eggs, and beef would lead to coronary heart disease. This resulted in the American government recommending that people adopt a low-fat diet in order to <b>prevent</b> <b>heart</b> <b>disease.</b>|$|E

The causes and {{prevention}} of <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> have been studied for years, and new information is emerging. For the last several decades, saturated fat and cholesterol have been thought to be major contributors to coronary artery disease, and therefore people are typically advised to strictly limit these in their diet. However, recent studies are indicating that it may not be wise to strictly limit the intake of dietary saturated fatty acids or replace them with polyunsaturated fatty acids when taking other health conditions into consideration.

40|$|Section 2 {{presents}} {{a vision of}} cardiovascular health (CVH) that is achievable through a comprehensive public health strategy.

To develop the strategy, an action framework was developed that outlines the present reality, {{a vision of the}} future, and six broad intervention approaches that can help achieve this vision. These six approaches address the two overarching goals of Healthy People 2010, which are to increase quality and years of healthy life and eliminate health disparities, as well as the specific goal for <b>preventing</b> <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> and stroke.
