50|$|The take-down lever {{is used to}} {{lock the}} slide back (as the Browning Hi-Power safety is used) during {{disassembly}} to allow removal of the slide <b>release</b> <b>lever.</b> In later variants, this lever is omitted and the slide must be manually aligned to remove the slide <b>release</b> <b>lever.</b> Once the slide and frame are aligned (by the disassembly lever or manually), the recoil guide is pulled forward to release the slide <b>release</b> <b>lever</b> {{and allow it to}} drop free. The slide will then be free to run forward and be removed from the frame.|$|R
50|$|Empty {{magazines}} are released by depressing ambidextrous magazine <b>release</b> <b>levers</b> {{incorporated into the}} trigger guard.|$|R
50|$|The FNS {{series of}} the pistols all include ambidextrous {{magazine}} releases, and slide stop <b>release</b> <b>levers.</b>|$|R

50|$|The Astra A-60 is a double-action,single-action, {{semi-automatic}} {{pistol at}} one time produced in Spain by Astra-Unceta y Cia SA. The design {{is similar to the}} Walther PP and features a slide-lock <b>release</b> <b>lever.</b>|$|R
50|$|The bolt <b>release</b> <b>lever</b> {{is located}} {{on the right side of}} the action (on {{right-handed}} models) behind the ejection port. Pressing this lever down while pulling the unlocked bolt to the rear allows the bolt to be removed from the rifle for cleaning.|$|R
50|$|Below the cam in {{this photo}} (hidden) is a {{spring-loaded}} lever that pushes against a pin on the cam. On the upper {{edge of the}} cam, as shown, is a little projection that engages the <b>release</b> <b>lever,</b> {{which is at the}} lowest part of the image; it's an irregular shape.|$|R
50|$|The FE's auto-exposure lock {{mechanism}} is activated by pushing {{and holding the}} timer shutter <b>release</b> <b>lever</b> toward the lens mount; even though the exposure is fixed {{to the state of}} the instant the lever is pushed, the black shutter speed needle in the viewfinder does not reflect this and moves freely.|$|R
5000|$|The {{bottom of}} the camera {{contains}} the rewind knob <b>release</b> <b>lever,</b> the rewind <b>release</b> button [...] and the rewind knob, which {{is also used to}} open the back. Printing on the bottom includes loading instructions, daylight exposure table, flash exposure table, (both based on ASA 10 film) and suggestions for common focus settings.|$|R
50|$|Empty {{magazines}} are released by depressing ambidextrous magazine <b>release</b> <b>levers</b> {{incorporated into the}} trigger guard in all non M2 PPQ variants or by depressing a reversible thumb release push-button located behind {{the bottom of the}} trigger guard in the PPQ M2 variant. Additionally, the PPQ M2 {{magazines are}} not compatible with the original PPQ magazines.|$|R
50|$|In 2002, the A8 L {{received}} standard xenon high-intensity {{discharge lamp}} (HID) headlights, and a heated steering wheel. A tyre pressure monitoring system (TPMS), an updated Symphony II stereo, and new exterior colours were also added. For 2002, all A8 variants received a trunk/boot interior <b>release</b> <b>lever</b> to facilitate escape {{in the event}} an individual became trapped within.|$|R
50|$|When a key {{is pressed}} down, it moves the <b>release</b> <b>lever</b> and unlatches the cam for that letter; the {{spring-loaded}} lever pressing on the pin rotates the cam until it engages the power roll. As the cam continues to turn, increasing radius rotates the cam's frame slightly (clockwise in the photo) {{to operate the}} typing linkage for that character.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to {{a wide selection of}} trigger/firing modes, the USP has an ambidextrous magazine <b>release</b> <b>lever</b> that is shielded by the trigger guard from inadvertent actuation. The rear of the USP grip is stepped, and combines well with the tapered magazine to allow for rapid reloading. Finger recesses in the grip frame also aid in magazine removal. On 9 mm and [...]40 caliber USPs, magazines are constructed of polymer reinforced with stainless steel. Magazines on the USP [...]45 are all-metal. All USP magazines will drop free of the pistol frame when the magazine release is depressed. Also, the USP does not have a magazine lockout feature (also known as a magazine disconnector). Thus, it is possible to fire a chambered round even with the magazine removed. An extended slide <b>release</b> <b>lever</b> is positioned to allow easy operation without changing the grip of the shooting hand.|$|R
5000|$|As the cam {{continues}} to rotate, the spring-loaded lever pushes on the pin {{to move it}} toward home position, but if the key is still down, the cam (now out of contact with the power roll) stalls because the projection on the cam catches on {{another part of the}} <b>release</b> <b>lever.</b> The cam stalls until the key is released. When <b>released,</b> the <b>lever</b> catches the projection so the cam is now in home position. This is like a simple clock escapement, and prevents repeated typing. (The [...] "key-down" [...] anti-repeat stop can be removed, so that fast repetitive typing can be done, but this change is difficult to undo.) ...|$|R
2500|$|The seat [...] tube {{contains}} the seatpost of the bike, which {{connects to the}} saddle. The saddle height is adjustable by changing how far the seatpost is inserted into the seat tube. On some bikes, this is achieved using a quick <b>release</b> <b>lever.</b> The seatpost must be inserted at least a certain length; this is marked with a minimum insertion mark.|$|R
5000|$|... 4 - Minolta-35 (Model D)In 1949 {{at about}} serial no.10,000, a recess was {{introduced}} under the lens-mount to improve operating the lens focusing lever, and the rewind <b>release</b> <b>lever</b> was moved, {{placed under the}} frame counter. By now the film frame length has been increased to 34mm, and carrying strap eyelets has been added {{at either end of}} the camera body.|$|R
50|$|The M1951 {{is fed from}} an 8-round {{detachable}} box magazine. A hold open device {{will keep}} the slide locked open after discharging the last cartridge from the magazine. The slide can then be released by depressing the slide <b>release</b> <b>lever</b> located {{on the left side}} of the frame. The pistol uses fixed iron sights set for engaging targets at 50 m. These consist of a forward blade and rear notch.|$|R
25|$|Polymer {{holsters}} {{in various}} configurations and matching magazine pouches are available. In addition, Glock produces optional triggers, recoil springs, slide stops, magazine <b>release</b> <b>levers,</b> and maritime spring cups. Maritime spring cups {{are designed to}} allow the pistol to be fired immediately after being submerged in water. They feature additional openings that allow liquids to flow and escape around them, offering enhanced reliability when water has penetrated into the firing pin assembly channel.|$|R
50|$|Age {{and size}} {{restrictions}} were often enforced. Children under 6 years old were refused entry, and children over 6 years old were refused entry without an accompanying adult. Pregnant women, and the infirm were also discouraged from boarding this ride. Hats and wigs were also prohibited, {{and due to}} an incident where a woman actually lost her wig on the ride, it became a long-standing custom for the operator to keep a woman's wig on the ride's main <b>release</b> <b>lever</b> as a humorous reminder.|$|R
50|$|The CPW {{is fully}} ambidextrous; {{it can be}} used with equal {{ergonomic}} ease by both right and left-handed shooters. Every single lever, control or toggle has been mirrored {{on the opposite side of}} the receiver - this includes the cocking handle, the fire control selector/manual safety switch (installed above the pistol grip) as well as the bolt <b>release</b> <b>lever,</b> which is used to slam the bolt closed after inserting a new magazine. The ejection port is located on the right side of the weapon.|$|R
50|$|The PPQ M2 is {{a variant}} {{introduced}} at the 2013 Shot Show by {{the newly formed}} Walther Arms Inc. It has the same features as the standard PPQ with the sole exception that the ambidextrous magazine <b>release</b> <b>levers</b> incorporated {{into the bottom of}} the trigger guard have been omitted and replaced by a thumb release push-button located behind the bottom of the trigger guard. For left-handed use the magazine release push-button is reversible.Additionally, the PPQ M2 magazines are not compatible with the original PPQ magazines.|$|R
50|$|Instead of the {{standard}} AK safety selector, some Vepr-12 shotguns have an ambidextrous safety that can be manipulated from {{either side of the}} receiver.An unusual feature among firearms in the Kalashnikov family, the Vepr-12 sports a last round bolt hold-open mechanism. That is, the bolt locks {{to the rear of the}} receiver after the last round has been ejected. To facilitate rapid reloading of the shotgun, a bolt <b>release</b> <b>lever</b> is located inside the trigger guard, allowing the user to release the bolt without breaking grip.|$|R
50|$|The slide stop <b>release</b> <b>lever</b> {{is located}} {{on the left side of}} the frame {{directly}} beneath the slide and can be manipulated by the thumb of the shooting hand for right handed shooters. When a cartridge is present in the chamber the pistol can be fired without the need of having a magazine inserted in the weapon. Walther does however offer a magazine disconnect as an optional safety on some PPS pistols that will prevent discharging the pistol without a magazine present in the pistol.|$|R
25|$|Between 1982–1983 the P7 {{received}} several modifications, mainly to address American market demand and shooter preferences. These modifications {{resulted in the}} P7M8 model. A new magazine <b>release</b> <b>lever</b> (available {{on both sides of}} the frame) was installed just beneath the trigger guard, which forced designers to modify both the pistol's frame and magazine. The trigger guard was equipped with a synthetic heat shield that protects the shooter from excessive heating and a lanyard attachment loop was added in place of the previous magazine heel release. The firing pin and its bushing were also changed.|$|R
50|$|Count {{mechanism}} - This is {{the critical}} part mentioned above, that releases the striking train at the proper time and counts out the proper number of strikes. It is {{the only part of}} the striking mechanism that is attached to the clock's timekeeping works. Virtually all modern clocks use the rack and snail. The snail (N) is usually mounted on the clock's center wheel shaft, which turns once every 12 hours. There is also a <b>release</b> <b>lever</b> (L) which on the hour releases the rack and allows the timing train to turn.|$|R

50|$|The Luftwaffe Fallschirmjäger-Messer uses {{a sliding}} blade inside a metal gripframe, which was {{originally}} fitted with smooth wood scales, usually of beech or walnut. The blade {{itself is a}} relatively blunt spear-point, and the profile is flat ground, tapering to a utility edge. To open the blade using gravity, the user points the FJM downwards while flipping up the fulcrum-style operating lever, allowing gravity to draw out the blade to its fullest extent. <b>Releasing</b> the <b>lever</b> locks the blade into position. The FJM may also be opened by flipping the blade <b>release</b> <b>lever</b> while flicking the wrist holding the knife, causing the blade to extend. The FJM was also equipped with a folding marlinspike or awl. Primarily intended for untangling rope knots, {{it can also be}} used as a prying tool. The FJM's spike does not lock when opened and was never intended {{to be used as a}} combat weapon, though individual German paratroopers may have employed it as such.|$|R
50|$|The CZ 75 {{is a short}} recoil operated, locked breech pistol. It {{uses the}} Browning linkless cam locking system {{similar to that used}} in the Browning Hi-Power pistol, where the barrel and slide are locked {{together}} on firing, using locking lugs milled into the barrel mating with recesses in the roof of the slide. An enclosed cam track integral with the barrel is actuated by the slide <b>release</b> <b>lever's</b> transverse pin. After the first few millimetres of the recoil stroke, the barrel is cammed downwards at the rear, enabling the slide to continue the recoil stroke and eject the spent cartridge.|$|R
50|$|Ratchet {{fasteners}} are {{the most}} complex of the three fasteners to thread, but offer advantages in taking up the slack in the webbing and tensioning the assembly. Once the webbing is threaded through the fastener, the ratcheting mechanism is employed {{to take up the}} slack and tension the assembly to the necessary level. The ratcheting mechanism functions similarly to a socket wrench; you open and close the fastener repeatedly to pull the webbing through the fastener. Releasing the tension is a simple matter of depressing the <b>release</b> <b>lever</b> and pulling the webbing back through the fastener.|$|R
5000|$|... 3 - Minolta-35 (Model C)At about {{serial number}} 4000 the frame size was {{increased}} to 33mm length. It would gradually increase until finally, in 1953, it reach the full 36mm length {{when it was}} realised {{that it was impossible}} to obtain acceptance for the shorter format for export, since automatic cutting and mounting machines for colour slides would destroy three out of four slides. In addition, the rewind <b>release</b> <b>lever</b> was increased somewhat in size. The engravings on the lens and on the slow speed dial were turned to be read as one holds the camera for picture taking! ...|$|R
5000|$|Weather Box - A cloud {{containing}} snow <b>released</b> {{by three}} <b>levers</b> (RHS) ...|$|R
50|$|The <b>release</b> <b>lever</b> (L) {{holds the}} rack (M) {{up when the}} clock is not striking. On the shaft of the minute hand (not shown), which rotates once per hour, there is a {{projection}}. As the change of the hour approaches, this projection slowly lifts the <b>release</b> <b>lever,</b> allowing the rack to fall until its point rests on the snail (N). The amount the rack can fall, and thus the number of strikes, {{is determined by the}} position of the snail. Exactly on the hour the striking train (G, H, K) is released and begins to turn. As it turns, the pins (G) repeatedly lift the hammer (F) and allow it to drop, ringing the gong (E). The gear ratios are arranged so that the gear wheel (H) makes one revolution each strike. A small pin (S) on this wheel engages the rack teeth, lifting the rack up by one tooth each turn. When the rack reaches the end of its teeth it stops the striking train from turning (using a mechanism not shown in the diagram, {{in such a way that}} gear (H) is held stationary with the pin (S) not engaging the rack, so that the rack is able to fall freely again on the next hour). So the number of strikes is equal to the number of teeth of the rack which are used, which depends on the position of the snail.|$|R
25|$|The Glock 17 feeds from staggered-column or {{double stack}} {{magazines}} {{that have a}} 17-round capacity (which can be extended to 19 with an optional floor plate) or optional 33-round high-capacity magazines. For jurisdictions which restrict magazine capacity to 10 rounds, Glock offers single-stack, 10-round magazines. The magazines are made of steel and are overmolded with plastic. A steel spring drives a plastic follower. After the last cartridge has been fired, the slide remains open on the slide stop. The slide stop <b>release</b> <b>lever</b> {{is located on the}} left side of the frame directly beneath the slide and can be manipulated by the thumb of the right-handed shooter.|$|R
