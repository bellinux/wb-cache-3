Your election to the Institut has, for me, a surpassing charm--I simply revel and, as it were, wallow in it. Je m'y vautre. But oh, if it could only have come soon enough for poor Alice to have known it--such a happy little nip {{as it would have}} given her; or for the dear old susceptible Dad! But things come as they can--and I am, in general, lost in the daily miracle of their coming at all: I mean so many of them--few as that many may be: and I speak above all for myself. I am lost, moreover, just now, in the wonder of what effect on American affairs, of every kind, the shock of battle will have. Luckily it's of my nature--though not of my pocket--always to be prepared for the worst and to expect the least. Like you, with all my heart, I have [...] "finance on the brain." [...] At least I try to have it--with a woeful lack of natural talent for the same. It is none too soon. But one arrives at dates, periods, corners of one's life: great changes, deep operations are begotten. This has more portée than I can fully go into. I shall certainly do my best to let my flat when I am ready to leave town; the difficulty, this year, however, will be that the time for [...] "season" [...] letting begins now, and that I can't depart for at least another month. Things are not ready at Rye, and won't be till then, with the limited local energy at work that I have very wisely contented myself with turning on there. It has been the right and much the best way in the long run, and for one's good little relations there; only the run has been a little longer. The remnant of the season here may be difficult to dispose of--to a sub-lessee; and my books--only a part of which I can house at Rye--are a complication. However, I shall do what I can this year; and for subsequent absences, so long as my <b>present</b> <b>lease</b> of De Vere Gardens runs, I shall have the matter on a smooth, organised, working basis. I mean to arrange myself always to let--being, as such places go, distinctly lettable. And for my declining years I have already put my name down for one of the invaluable south-looking, Carlton-Gardens-sweeping bedrooms at the Reform Club, which are let by the year and are of admirable and convenient (with all the other resources of the place at one's elbow) general habitability. The only thing is they are so in demand that one has sometimes a long time to await one's turn. On the other hand there are accidents--"occasions." ...

The arena is also expected to house a practice facility and team headquarters for the Clippers, as the team's current practice facility in Los Angeles' Playa Vista neighborhood is still owned by the Sterling Family Trust, and is leased back to the team. The Inglewood city council unanimously voted for the agreement in which a subsidiary of the Clippers will purchase 22 acres covering four large city blocks in what is largely a lower-class/lower middle-class residential neighborhood (Century to the north, 104th Street to the south, Yukon to the east, and Prairie to the west) to build the new facility.|$|E

Responses to this advertisement by potential developers for the new facilities triggered a long-running and bitter public debate within the Toowoomba Community. The redevelopment scheme supported by the then Mayor {{and a number of}} councillors involved the construction of high rise accommodation facilities along with supporting tourist facilities and function rooms. Headlines such as [...] "Save Picnic Point from High Rise" [...] appeared in the Toowoomba Chronicle in 1989. Debate was ongoing and the Picnic Point Preservation Group was formed in 1991. Lobbying of council and government concerns continued with the heading of an editorial in The Chronicle in May 1992 reading Picnic Point a [...] "sacred site". Public outrage maintained its momentum with the presentation of a petition to the Toowoomba City Council from the Picnic Point Defence Group in December 1993 opposing construction of high-rise plans for new facilities at Picnic Point. By 1994 plans for the redevelopment of the site had been thoroughly revised and all talk of a high rise tower being built at Picnic Point had ceased. The 1958 kiosk facilities were finally demolished in 1995 {{to make way for the}} third kiosk building on the site.

60|$|Apia, {{the port}} and mart, is {{the seat of}} the {{political}} sickness of Samoa. At the foot of a peaked, woody mountain, the coast makes a deep indent, roughly semicircular. In front the barrier reef is broken by the fresh water of the streams; if the swell be from the north, it enters almost without diminution; and the war-ships roll dizzily at their moorings, and along the fringing coral which follows the configuration of the beach, the surf breaks with a continuous uproar. In wild weather, as the world knows, the roads are untenable. Along the whole shore, which is everywhere green and level and overlooked by inland mountain-tops, the town lies drawn out in strings and clusters. The western horn is Mulinuu, the eastern, Matautu; and {{from one to the other}} of these extremes, I ask the reader to walk. He will find more of the history of Samoa spread before his eyes in that excursion, than has yet been collected in the blue-books or the white-books of the world. Mulinuu (where the walk is to begin) is a flat, wind-swept promontory, planted with palms, backed against a swamp of mangroves, and occupied by a rather miserable village. The reader is informed that this is the proper residence of the Samoan kings; he will be the more surprised to observe a board set up, and to read that this historic village is the property of the German firm. But these boards, which are among the commonest features of the landscape, may be rather taken to imply that the claim has been disputed. A little farther east he skirts the stores, offices, and barracks of the firm itself. Thence he will pass through Matafele, the one really town-like portion of this long string of villages, by German bars and stores and the German consulate; and reach the Catholic mission and cathedral standing by the mouth of a small river. The bridge which crosses here (bridge of Mulivai) is a frontier; behind is Matafele; beyond, Apia proper; behind, Germans are supreme; beyond, with but few exceptions, all is Anglo-Saxon. Here the reader will go forward past the stores of Mr. Moors (American) and Messrs. MacArthur (English); past the English mission, the office of the English newspaper, the English church, and the old American consulate, till he reaches the mouth of a larger river, the Vaisingano. Beyond, in Matautu, his way takes him in the shade of many trees and by scattered dwellings, and presently brings him beside a great range of offices, the place and the monument of a German who fought the German firm during his life. His house (now he is dead) remains pointed like a discharged cannon at the citadel of his old enemies. Fitly enough, it is at <b>present</b> <b>leased</b> and occupied by Englishmen. A little farther, and the reader gains the eastern flanking angle of the bay, where stands the pilot-house and signal-post, and whence he can see, on the line of the main coast of the island, the British and the new American consulates.|$|R
40|$|The Navajo {{reservation}} {{located in}} portions of Arizona, New Mexico and Utah {{is rich in}} low sulfur coal deposits, ideal for strip mining operation. Presently, the Navajo Nation has entered into extensive coal leases with several large companies and utilities. Contracts have committed huge quantities of Navajo coal for mining. The present research has been directed to evaluate the shadow prices of Navajo coal and identify optimal coal extraction. An economic model of coal resource extraction over time has been structured within an optimal control problem has been formulated as a discrete dynamic optimization problem. A comparison of the shadow prices of coal deposits derived from the dynamic model with the royalty payments the tribe receives {{on the basis of}} the <b>present</b> long-term <b>lease</b> contracts indicates that in most cases the tribe is paid considerably less than the amount of royalty projected by the model. Part of these discrepancies may be explained in terms of the low coal demand condition at the time of leasing and due to greater uncertainties with respect to the geologic information and other risks associated with mining operations. However, changes in the demand for coal with rigidly fixed terms of royalty rates will lead to non-optimal extraction of coal. A corrective tax scheme has been suggested {{on the basis of the}} results of this research. The proposed tax per unit of coal shipped from a site is the difference between the shadow price and the present royalty rate. The estimated tax rates over time are derived...|$|R
40|$|The {{convergence}} of wireless access networks {{in conjunction with}} the increased computing power of the handheld terminals is preparing the emergence of the ubiquitous computing paradigm. In the center of this paradigm are smart spaces, which are local environments saturated with various embedded computational resources. These spaces co-operate with mobile client devices in enabling advanced, service-oriented computation scenarios. The co-operation is typically enabled through the utilization of distributed and modular middleware frameworks. An emerging additional requirement is however the possibility to harness resources from the proximity environment to the mobile device in an on-demand fashion. This is a challenge, especially to the resource management infrastructure of the smart spaces. This thesis explores the concept of a smart space and presents a review of the current research and technologies. Subsequently, a lease-based design for resource management in smart spaces is <b>presented.</b> The <b>leases</b> in this work mean negotiated agreements between the mobile clients and resource management infrastructure regarding the harnessed resources. Leasing is seen as a suitable solution for the management due to the transient nature of the resource usage. The inclusion of additional contextual features to the leases further facilitates the management. Requirements for the design are derived from the review and an example usage scenario. The requirements include dynamic mapping and contracting of resources from the proximity environment, monitoring of the contract validity, access control towards the resources, and dynamic maintenance of the smart space infrastructure. The design presented is analytically compared against existing solutions, and several points for future development are listed. According to the comparison, none of the existing solutions utilize contracts with contextual validity in resource management.
