40|$|The {{introduction}} of accrual based accounting in the <b>public</b> <b>sectors</b> of many jurisdictions {{throughout the world}} is a central component of a wide raft of <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> management reforms, whose aim is to enhance efficiency, effectiveness and accountability. The typical measure provided by <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> accounting is the comparison between what a <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> <b>entity</b> said it would spent and what it actually spent.

Consequently, there is a need for additional performance measures as well as a move from stewardship towards accountability (i. e. <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> accounting has to move from cash to accrual). We hypothesize: – the dominance of accrual accounting, supported by cash-based budgetary accounting; – the importance of international harmonization of accounting standards. The paper investigates the integration between cash-based budgetary accounting and accrual accounting and the role of accounting standards, in particular within <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> organizations whose activity largely consist of transferring financial resources, collected especially by taxes, to other organizations which produce services. We adopt a case-study research method investigating the financial statements of the European Union, as a relevant case of adopting an accrual accounting approach...|$|R

40|$|The {{nature of}} {{financial}} reporting in the <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> in Australia has undergone substantial {{change in the}} last twenty years. One result has been the promulgation of <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> accounting standards based on the private sector conceptual framework for general purpose financial reports. A central key to this framework is the existence of users and their needs. This framework emphasises the provision of information for users {{for the purpose of}} decision making. Critics of the framework as it applies to the <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> claim that it lacks empirical substantiation and ignores the complexity and diversity of <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> institutions. This paper examines and analyses the annual report distribution lists for local government authorities within Queensland and provides empirical evidence on distribution patterns. The study finds that there are user groups which fall outside the categories identified by the conceptual framework. Further, there is a wide variety in the dissemination lists of local government authorities and cross sectional differences in the distribution patterns for urban and rural local government authorities.

In comparing and contrasting some design-build projects, the benefits and constraints of design-build are established.
