40|$|An {{experimental}} {{study was conducted}} to determine the accuracy of current <b>press</b> <b>fit</b> theory when applied to <b>press</b> <b>fit</b> design. Brass and nylon hex samples were <b>press</b> <b>fitted</b> with hardened steel dowel pins. <b>Press</b> <b>fit</b> force and torque required to induce slipping were measured experimentally. Sample dimensions and material properties were utilized to predict expected force and torque levels, which were then measured experimentally. Brass <b>press</b> <b>fit</b> forces proved difficult to predict due to plowing effects in tight interference <b>press</b> <b>fits</b> where material yielding was observed. However, once vertical force was removed, torque was applied to each sample. The observed torque values matched <b>press</b> <b>fit</b> theory well suggesting that the interface pressure of the <b>press</b> <b>fit</b> can be accurately predicted by theory. The brass torque samples matched theory well once material yield conditions were taken into account. The creep sensitivity of the nylon samples made predictions over the testing period unreliable. Results show the need for further testing with specific attention to precision in sample machining and measurements. Other considerations include <b>press</b> <b>fit</b> interface roughness and plowing effects during press fitting. by Alexandra T. Nelson. Thesis (S. B.)

40|$|Reliability {{studies of}} <b>press</b> <b>fit</b> {{contacts}} {{have been performed}} during environmental stress tests as well as during the manufacturing process. We investigated several <b>press</b> <b>fit</b> pin geometries according to their reliability under thermal, mechanical and electrical load. Correlations with the push-out force have been performed. In this paper we also focus on the mechanical reliability of electronic components which are soldered nearby the press-in pins. During press-in of the contact pin, a strain affected zone is created in the printed circuit board (PCB) near the contacts. The reliability of electronic components soldered near the <b>press</b> <b>fit</b> pins can be reduced if the solder joints are bearing strains > 400 µm/m. We investigated the strains {{on the surface of}} PCBs during <b>press</b> <b>fit</b> injection by two different sensor technologies and numerical simulations. Apart from standard electrical strain gauges we used fiber optic Bragg grating sensors. Their advantage is the ability to detect strain gradients, which are common in the sphere of influence of a <b>press</b> <b>fit</b> contact. In a distance of 3 mm away from the investigated contact pins the surface strain on the PCB is around 0. 1 %; in a distance of 10 mm at least 500 µm/m...|$|R

40|$|Most {{chains are}} an {{assembly}} [1] of five parts namely, outer plate, inner plate, bush, pin and roller. Two inner plates are <b>press</b> <b>fitted</b> with two <b>bushes</b> {{to form an}} inner block assembly. The outer plates are <b>press</b> <b>fitted</b> with pins after keeping the pins through the assembled bushes of the inner block. Roller is a rotating member and placed over the bush during inner block assembly. Inner block assembly is the load transfer member from sprocket tooth. The outer block assembly helps in holding and also to pull the inner block over the sprocket teeth. If a chain length is in odd number of pitches, it requires an offset plate as shown in Figure 1 to connect two ends of the chain together to make chain endless. When the chain is assembled with an offset plate, the chain fatigue life was observed only 20 to 25 % of the total life of a chain, assembled without an offset plate. The holes in the offset plate are {{of the same size}} as in the outer and inner plates respectively and it is a complex in shape chain plate. A inbuilt thinning zone at the centre of the chain plate as shown in Figure 1 is unavoidable. The stresses and its distribution in this complex shape chain plate geometry {{play a critical role in}} the fatigue life performance of a chain assembly. However, it is difficult identify the stress distribution and stress concentration zones precisely using only the conventional industrial friendly tools such as routine quality control test, breaking load test and numerical computations. In this context the transmission photoelastic technique has made it possible to identify the stress distribution, its concentration and also to quantify the stress and strain [2 - 3] at any point in the chain plate. This paper explains how transmission photoelastic technique is used to estimate the stress distribution and its concentration zones in a complex chain plate when it isloaded. An epoxy chain plate model was made through the casting method using a Perspex mould [2 - 3]. A loading fixture was used to load the model during stress freezing in the furnace. The integrated fringe pattern of the offset chain plate is shown in Figure 2. Slices are cut in the offset zone to understand the nature of the stress distribution. A Simple photoelastic analysis of this has revealed a wealth of information to take suitable decision on the design of such plates taking into account the constraints in manufacturing...|$|R
40|$|The {{anterior}} cruciate ligament (ACL) consists of two bundles, the anteromedial (AM) and posterolateral bundle (PM). Double bundle reconstructions appear to give better rotational stability. The usual technique is to make two tunnels in the femur and two in the tibia. This is difficult and in small knees {{may not even be}} possible. We have developed a foreign material free <b>press</b> <b>fit</b> fixation for double bundle ACL reconstruction using a single femoral tunnel (R). This is based on the ALL <b>PRESS</b> <b>FIT</b> ACL reconstruction. It is suitable for the most common medium and, otherwise difficult, small sizes of knees. Method: Using diamond edged wet grinding hollow reamers, bone cylinders in different diameters are harvested from the implantation tunnels of the tibia and femur and used for the <b>press</b> <b>fit</b> fixation. Using the <b>press</b> <b>fit</b> technique the graft is first fixed in tibia. It is then similarly fixed under tension in the femoral side with the knee in 120 degree flexion. This is called Bottom To Top Fixation (BTT). On extending the knee the graft tension is self adapting. Depending {{on the size of the}} individual knee, the diameter of the femoral bone plug is varied from 8 to 13 mm to achieve an anatomic spread with a double bundle-like insertion. The tibia tunnel can be applied with two 7 or 8 mm diameter tunnels overlapping to a semi oval tunnel between 10 to 13 mm. Results: Since May 2003 we have carried out ACL-reconstructions with Hamstring grafts without foreign material using the ALL <b>PRESS</b> <b>FIT</b> technique. Initially, an 8 mm <b>press</b> <b>fit</b> fixation was used proximally with good results. Since April 2008, the range of diameters was increased up to 13 mm. The results of the Lachman tests have been good to excellent. Results of the Pivot shift test suggested more stability with femoral broader diameters of 9, 5 to 13 mm. Conclusions: The foreign material free fixation of hamstring in the ALL <b>PRESS</b> <b>FIT</b> Bottom To Top Fixation is a successful method for ACL Reconstruction. The Diamond Instruments and tubed guiding devices are precise, reliable and easy to manage. On this basis a double bundle reconstruction is achieved using a single tunnel.

40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} {{crack propagation}} simulation is {{performed by the}} Dual Boundary Element Method (DBEM). The Stress Intensity Factors (SIFs) along {{the front of a}} semi elliptical crack, initiated from the external surface of a hollow axle, are calculated for bending and <b>press</b> <b>fit</b> loading separately and for a combination of them. In correspondence of the latter loading condition, a crack propagation is also simulated, with the crack growth rates calculated using the NASGRO 3 formula, calibrated for the material under analysis (steel ASTM A 469). The J-integral and COD approaches are selected for SIFs calculation in DBEM environment, where the crack path is assessed by the minimum strain energy density criterion (MSED). In correspondence of the initial crack scenario, SIFs along the crack front are also calculated by the Finite Element (FE) code ZENCRACK, using COD, in order to provide, by a cross comparison with DBEM, an assessment on the level of accuracy obtained. Due to the symmetry of the bending problem a pure mode I crack propagation is realised with no kinking of the propagating crack whereas for <b>press</b> <b>fit</b> loading the crack propagation becomes mixed mode. The crack growth analysis is nonlinear because of normal gap elements used to model the <b>press</b> <b>fit</b> condition with added friction, and is developed in an iterative-incremental procedure.

40|$|Objectives. The paper {{presents}} {{an investigation of}} the biomechanical effects induced by oral implant insertion because of the <b>press</b> <b>fit</b> action caused by the difference between the major diameter of the implant and that of the drilled hole. The intent is to provide a correlation between bone–implant interaction and heavy stress–strain effects induced in bone tissues. In particular, the analysis allows for the evaluation of the bone mechanical response considering the inelastic range. Materials and methods. Bone material properties are defined, with regard to the elastic phase, according to a procedure that distributes, over the entire volume, the material constants magnitude and orthotropic directions deduced from experimental data. The inelastic phenomena are interpreted by a specific constitutive formulation and parameter identification procedure. The displacement field induced by implant insertion is provided by imposing the geometric configuration of the implant on the assumed drilled surface. Results. Results are reported with regard to the displacement and strain fields caused in the peri-implant region. The range of strains induced in bone confirms that inelastic effects occur and their characterisation is essential for the interpretation of the <b>press</b> <b>fit</b> phenomenon. Significance. The investigation allows for an accurate evaluation of the short term effects induced by <b>press</b> <b>fit</b> phenomenon in bone tissues which can be of particular interest also in consideration of immediate loading techniques in oral surgery...|$|R

40|$|Dental {{implantology}} {{is commonly}} adopted {{for the treatment}} of edentulous patients. The reliability is mainly determined by interaction phenomena between implant and bone tissue, that are affected by loading imposed and the corresponding response of bone tissue. Dental implants biomechanics can be investigated by numerical methods. An accurate characterization of bone mechanical response by specific constitutive formulations is required. Elastic orthotropic model is adopted with regard to the elastic phase of the material, accounting for non-homogeneous distribution of mechanical properties. At this purpose, a procedure is developed to provide a distribution of orthotropic elastic properties over the anatomical region where the implant is placed. Furthermore, attention must be focused on problems that are part of clinical practice and can determine relevant strain/stress, imposing the consideration of bone inelastic response. In particular, misfit and <b>press</b> <b>fit</b> conditions are investigated. Misfit occurs in multiple implant frames, when no perfect geometric compatibility occurs between connecting framework and implants. <b>Press</b> <b>fit</b> {{is due to the fact}} that the diameter of hole drilled within the mandible is smaller than the implant one. Both these phenomena determine a post elastic deformation of bone tissue and entail the assumption of a visco-elasto-plastic constitutive model capable of an appropriate interpretation of the response.
