Shifts in trade routes occurred with {{the rise and fall}} of important cities in the Maya region, and have been identified in every major reorganization of the Maya civilization, such as the rise of Preclassic Maya civilization, the transition to the Classic, and the Terminal Classic collapse. Even the Spanish Conquest did not immediately terminate all Maya trading activity; for example, the Contact period Manche Ch'ol traded the prestige crops of cacao, annatto and vanilla into colonial Verapaz.|$|E
25|$|From the 1930s {{until its}} {{dissolution}} in late 1991, {{the way the}} Soviet economy operated remained essentially unchanged. The economy was formally directed by central planning, carried out by Gosplan and organized in five-year plans. In practice, however, the plans were highly aggregated and provisional, subject to ad hoc intervention by superiors. All key economic decisions were taken by the political leadership. Allocated resources and plan targets were normally denominated in rubles rather than in <b>physical</b> <b>goods.</b> Credit was discouraged, but widespread. Final allocation of output was achieved through relatively decentralized, unplanned contracting. Although in theory prices were legally set from above, in practice the actual prices were often negotiated, and informal horizontal links (between producer factories etc.) were widespread.|$|E

In 2005, it received a $150,000 development loan from Cayuga County, and in May {{of that year}} moved to larger facilities in Auburn. After being unable to facilitate an operational manufacturing facility in Auburn, the owners sold all of Ithaca's assets, trademarks, and manufacturing rights to the Marshalls from Upper Sandusky, Ohio. The <b>physical</b> <b>goods</b> were relocated to Floyd Marshall's 30+ years tool and die shop where all prints, programs, and processing were converted to CNC machine tools. Unable to secure state or local financing assistance with the startup conversion, the Marshalls were forced to sell the company {{in the best interest}} of the company's name and its people. Dave Dlubak purchased the company in June 2007, and it continues to operate in Upper Sandusky, Ohio. It has undergone a revamp with newer manufacturing equipment, and still employs many of the people from Floyd Marshall's original staff.|$|E

50|$|Both of {{his early}} treatises, De natura boni and De bono, start with a metaphysical {{investigation}} into the concepts of the good {{in general and the}} <b>physical</b> <b>good.</b> Albert refers to the <b>physical</b> <b>good</b> as bonum naturae. Albert does this before directly dealing with the moral concepts of metaphysics. In Albert's later works, he says in order to understand human or moral goodness, the individual must first recognize {{what it means to be}} good and do good deeds. This procedure reflects Albert's preoccupations with neo-Platonic theories of good as well as the doctrines of Pseudo-Dionysius. Albert's view was highly valued by the Catholic Church and his peers.|$|R

2500|$|Most modern {{business}} theorists {{describe a}} continuum with pure service on one terminal point and pure commodity {{good on the}} other. Most products fall between these two extremes.

2500|$|What {{orthodox}} Marxists traditionally {{tried to}} do, {{is to create}} concepts for a very precise standard classification schema of occupations and output-defined industrial activities, which splits the working class into productive and unproductive employees. This schematic approach to the issue was strongly influenced by the official orthodox Marxist–Leninist Material Product System (MPS) in the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, China, Cuba and Vietnam. The MPS national accounts divide economic activity into a productive sector where tangible <b>physical</b> <b>goods</b> are produced, an unproductive sector creating services, and households. Another influence was Piero Sraffa's revival of the classical distinction between the production of [...] "basic" [...] and [...] "non-basic" [...] goods.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} model of fixing or {{patching}} a software problem after the product has been released in the market. Specifically, we model a software firm's trade-off in releasing a buggy product early and investments in fixing it later. Just as the marginal cost of producing software can be effectively zero, so can the marginal cost of repairing multiple copies of defective software by issuing patches. We show that due to the fixed cost nature of investments in patching, a software vendor has incentives to release a buggier product early and patch it later in a larger market. Thus, a software monopolist releases a product with fewer bugs but later than what is socially optimal. We contrast this result with <b>physical</b> <b>good</b> markets where market size does not play any role in quality provision. We also show that for comparable costs, a software monopolist releases the product with more bugs but invests more in post-patching support later than the <b>physical</b> <b>good</b> monopolist. patching, software quality, time of entry, fixed costs, software bugs...|$|R

50|$|In finance, an {{exchange}} of futures for physicals (EFP) is a transaction between two parties in which a futures contract on a commodity is exchanged for the actual <b>physical</b> <b>good.</b> This transaction involves a privately negotiated exchange of a futures position for a corresponding position in the underlying physical. An EFP is similar to an EFS, except that it involves a physical contract rather than a cash swap contract. An EFP gives the market participants the ability to manage risk.|$|R
40|$|For <b>physical</b> {{consumer}} <b>goods</b> with no considerable information component, {{past research}} has identified scarcity, due to market conditions or {{as a producer}} strategy, as a driver of intention to purchase and willingness to pay. In contrast, information as the major value-creating component of <b>physical</b> information <b>goods</b> is inherently non-scarce. While anecdotal evidence suggests that intended or unintended scarcity can benefit sales of <b>physical</b> information <b>goods,</b> the underlying mechanisms have not been systematically investigated so far. To close this gap, this research develops a model based on an extensive literature review. The model is tested against evidence from e-commerce sales data of 34, 748 information goods.

40|$|We {{develop a}} model of {{separating}} equilibrium where a monopolist markets a physical product to two types of consumers in the online channel. We show how the seller may use personalization technology to limit or even eliminate the distortion caused by the cannibalization problem. This results in higher product quality levels and earlier product introductions for goods aimed at low type consumers. We find that personalization technology also lessens the adverse effects caused when the seller cannot credibly commit to future actions. We show that the seller should focus all of its personalization efforts on high type consumers, and must concern itself {{with the level of}} patience of high type consumers and not low types. We also examine three different seller strategies for bundling the sale of the <b>physical</b> <b>good</b> with customer access to a seller-sponsored online community. When personalization capabilities are relatively low, the seller should segment consumers into two communities by allowing consumers to have access to the community associated with the type of <b>physical</b> <b>good</b> that was actually purchased. When personalization capabilities are sufficiently high, the seller should switch from the segmented communities strategy and merge all consumers into one community to take advantage of externality effects. ...|$|R
