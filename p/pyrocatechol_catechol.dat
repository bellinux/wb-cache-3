40|$|<b>Pyrocatechol,</b> <b>catechol,</b> caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, safflor yellow A, safflor yellow B, precarthamin and carthamin were {{effectively}} adsorbed by insoluble polyvinyl-N-pyr­rolidone (PVP) in {{a neutral}} buffer solution. These eight phenols also bound with Amberlite XAD resins, however, the rate {{was found to be}} far less efficient than that of PVP. The average rate of the phenol binding was calculated as following order (%) : PVP (42. 7), Amberlite XAD- 2 (16. 6), Amberlite XAD- 4 (10. 1), Amberlite XAD- 7 (13. 0), Amberlite XAD- 8 (17. 7). No 3, 4 -dihydroxyphenylalanine was adsorbed by PVP, while the O-dihydroxylic acid could be removed by Amberlite XAD- 4, XAD- 7 and XAD- 8. Data from using different weights of the test polymers showed that the rate of the phenol adsorption rose in proportion to each increasing amount of the adsorbents. PVP also admittedly maintained its predominent capacity for phenol binding over that of each member of the Amberlite resins...|$|E
50|$|Catechin and {{epicatechin}} are epimers, with (-)-epicatechin and (+)-catechin {{being the}} most common optical isomers found in nature. Catechin was first isolated from the plant extract catechu, from which it derives its name. Heating catechin past its point of decomposition releases <b>pyrocatechol</b> (also called <b>catechol),</b> which explains the common origin {{of the names of}} these compounds.|$|R
40|$|International audienceFunnel metadynamics {{is a kind}} of {{computational}} simulation used {{to enhance}} the sampling of protein ligand binding events in solution. By characterization of the binding interaction events, an estimated absolute binding free energy can be calculated. Nuclear magnetic resonance and funnel metadynamics were used to evaluate the binding of <b>pyrocatechol</b> derivatives (<b>catechol,</b> 4 -methylcatechol, and 4 -tert-butylcatechol) to human peroxiredoxin 5. Human peroxiredoxins are peroxidases involved in cellular peroxide homeostasis. Recently, overexpressed or suppressed peroxiredoxin levels have been linked to various diseases. Here, the catechol derivatives were found to be inhibitors against human peroxiredoxin 5 through a partial mixed type noncompetitive mechanism. Funnel metadynamics provided a microscopic model for interpreting the inhibition mechanism. Correlations were observed between the inhibition constants and the absolute binding free energy. Overall, this study showcases the fact that funnel metadynamics simulations can be employed as a preliminary approach to gain an in-depth understanding of potential enzyme inhibitors...|$|R
40|$|Polyphenol oxidase (PPO; EC 1. 10. 3. 2) was {{isolated}} from wheat bran by {{a procedure that}} included ammonium sulfate fractionation, batch adsorption by DEAE-cellulofine, CM-cellulofine column chromatography, DEAE-cellulofine column chromatography, preparative isoelectric focusing, adsorption on the membrane of a Vivapure Q Maxi H spin column, and heat treatment. These procedures led to 150 -fold purification with 4. 2 % recovery. The PPO was homogeneous by SDS/ PAGE. The relative molecular weight of the PPO {{was estimated to be}} 37 000 based on its mobility in SDS/PAGE. The isoelectric point of the PPO was 4. 4. The K m values of the PPO for caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, <b>pyrocatechol,</b> 4 -methyl <b>catechol</b> and l-DOPA as substrates were 0. 077, 0. 198, 1. 176, 1. 667 and 4. 545 mM. The PPO was strongly inhibited by tropolone. The K i value for tropolone is 2. 2 × 10 – 7 M. The sequence of the 15 N-terminal amino-acid residues was determined to be ATDVRLSIAHQTRFA, which was identical to those of serpin from Triticum aestivum and protein Z from Hordeum vulgare. The PPO strongly inhibited the activity of trypsin, which is an enzyme of serine proteases; 50 % inhibition was observed with 1. 5 × 10 – 7 M PPO. The K i value for PPO is 2. 3 × 10 – 8 M. The wheat bran PPO should be a very important protein for protecting wheat against disease, virus, insect and herbivore damages by both the activities of PPO and protease inhibitor...|$|R
40|$|Two {{polyphenol}} oxidases (enzymes A and B) from Bartlett pear (Pyrus communis) peelings were purified to electrophoretic homogeneity {{according to}} polyacrylamide gel {{by a combination}} of Sephadex gel filtration, diethylaminoethyl cellulose chromatography and hydroxyl apatite chromatography. While the two enzymes differ electrophoretically at pH 9. 3, chromatographically on hydroxyl apatite, and in the effect of ionic strength on activity, they are similar with respect to chromatography on diethylaminoethyl cellulose, substrate specificity, pH activity relations, inhibition by p-coumaric and benzoic acids, and heat stability. The two enzymes are o-diphenol oxidases with no detectable monophenolase or laccase activities. <b>Pyrocatechol,</b> 4 -methyl <b>catechol,</b> chlorogenic acid, and d-catechin are good substrates of the enzymes with Km values in the range of 2 to 20 mm. Dependences of activity on oxygen and chlorogenic acid concentrations indicate a sequential mechanism for binding of these substrates to enzyme B. Vmax and Km values for oxygen and chlorogenic acid were 103 μmoles O 2 uptake per minute per milligram of enzyme, 0. 11 mm and 7. 2 mm, respectively, for enzyme B at pH 4. 0. Both enzymes had maximum activity at pH 4. 0 on chlorogenic acid. Km values for chlorogenic acid were independent of pH from 3 to 7; the Vmax values for both enzymes gave bell-shaped curves as a function of pH. p-Coumaric acid is a simple, linear noncompetitive inhibitor with respect to chlorogenic acid at pH 6. 2 with Ki values of 0. 38 and 0. 50 mm for enzymes A and B, respectively. Benzoic acid is a linear competitive inhibitor with respect to chlorogenic acid at pH 4. 0 with Ki values of 0. 04 and 0. 11 mm for enzymes A and B, respectively...|$|R
