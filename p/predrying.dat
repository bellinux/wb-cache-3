40|$|Lignite <b>predrying</b> and dry lignite firing is {{considered}} {{as an important}} development step {{for the next generation}} of lignite power plants. The integration of a <b>predrying</b> system in future lignite power plants, which utilizes low temperature steam for the drying process, combined with the further thermal utilization of lignite's evaporated moisture, may bring an efficiency increase of four to six percentage points compared with today's state of the art. Firing predried lignite is however expected to cause certain changes in the combustion behavior of large scale boilers. The investigation of these changes in an existing Greek utility boiler through experimental activities and numerical simulations is the scope of the present work. The investigations take place in a 75 MWth lignite fired Greek boiler. The specific unit is equipped with dedicated dry lignite burners. The measurements are performed with a dry lignite thermal share of 6 %. Higher cofiring thermal shares of up to 20 % are further simulated and the effect of cofiring on the combustion behavior is evaluated by specific parameters including temperature fields, wall heat flux, fuel's burnout, and NOx emissions. No clear effects of cofiring on boiler operation are observed during the experimental campaign indicating that the operational behavior in low cofiring shares remains constant. Some trends are observed in the simulations of the dry coal cofiring cases. Increased temperature peaks in the near burner region and higher furnace outlet temperatures are predicted. A clear increase of the total fuel burnout when firing dry coal is also foreseen by the simulations, which is a strong argument for the coutilization of dry lignite as a supportive fuel. The overall examinations imply that dry lignite cofiring for low thermal shares up to 20 % is feasible in the case of Greek boilers without major technological difficulties. For the realization of a lignite <b>predrying</b> concept in an existing Greek boiler however, a detailed study on each particular boiler is necessary. © 2010 American Chemical Society...|$|E

A cohort of 91 Canadian dairy herds was recruited and followed in 2007 and 2008. Universal dry cow therapy was widely adopted among the participating herds. At the beginning of years 2007 and 2008, a sample of 15 cows was selected in each herd. A series of quarter-milk samples consisting of 2 <b>predry</b> and 2 postcalving samples were collected on each quarter of these 30 cows. Milk samples were analyzed using routine bacteriological milk culture, and <b>predry</b> and postcalving IMI statuses of these quarters were established using parallel interpretation of the 2 <b>predry</b> and 2 postcalving tests, respectively. Intramammary infection status was defined as IMI by Staphylococcus aureus, streptococci other than Streptococcus agalactiae, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), or Corynebacterium spp. Incidence and elimination rates of DP IMI were computed for each herd. Lowess curves and linear regression were used to investigate the association between DP IMI incidence and elimination rates. Significant negative associations were found between incidence and elimination rates of Staph. aureus and CNS. The relationship between incidence and elimination rates was nonlinear for CNS, with a relatively strong negative relationship between DP IMI incidence and elimination rates for herds with relatively low DP IMI incidence (< 0. 10 new IMI/quarter-month). For herds with higher DP IMI incidence (≥ 0. 10 new IMI/quarter-month), a weaker negative relationship was observed between rates. No significant associations could be seen between DP incidence and elimination rates of streptococci other than Strep. agalactiae and of Corynebacterium spp. These results suggest that, conversely to the general belief, acquisition of new IMI and elimination of existing IMI during the DP may be driven, at least for staphylococci, by common mechanisms. The use of management strategies that would lead to the selection of pathogens less well adapted to the host could explain the associations observed between acquisition and elimination of IMI over the DP...|$|R

A cohort of 91 Canadian dairy herds was followed from 2007 to 2008. In each herd, a sample of 15 cows was selected each year, and a series of 2 <b>predry</b> and 2 postcalving quarter milk samples were collected. Routine milk bacteriological culture was conducted to identify IMI, SCC was measured on the quarter milk samples, and composite SCC of the last <b>predry</b> and first postcalving DHI tests were obtained. Mastitis pathogens were grouped into 3 categories: major pathogens, minor pathogens, and any pathogens. For each herd, DP bacteriological culture-derived IMI incidence and elimination rates were computed using quarter milk culture data. Similarly, SCC-derived herd incidence and elimination rates were computed using quarter and DHI composite-level SCC measurements and using various SCC thresholds to define new and eliminated IMI. Linear regression was used to compare herd quarter-level and composite-level SCC-derived herd incidence and elimination with DP bacteriological culture-derived IMI incidence and elimination. Herd DP incidences computed by using quarter-level SCC, and with most of the SCC thresholds tested, were significant predictors of the DP major, minor, and any IMI incidences (F-test; P≤ 0. 05). The highest coefficients of determination (R(2)) were obtained with thresholds of 200, 000 (R(2) : 12 %) and 50, 000 cells/mL (R(2) : 25 %) for predicting major and minor IMI, respectively. When using composite DHI SCC measurements, however, substantial losses of predictive power were seen for minor and any IMI incidences compared with quarter-level SCC. For DP major IMI incidence, composite SCC yielded similar, but modest, predictive power when a cutoff value of 150, 000 cells/mL was chosen to define new IMI. To predict DP elimination rates, the value of quarter-level SCC seemed limited to predicting the DP major IMI elimination rate. Composite SCC, on the other hand, showed modest predictive power for major and minor IMI elimination rates, with thresholds of 200, 000 and 50, 000 cells/mL, respectively. Results from the current study suggest that quarter and composite SCC-derived rates could be used as substitutes for bacteriological culture-derived rates for some groups of mastitis pathogens.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Complete {{investigation}} of thrombophilic or hemorrhagic clinical presentations is a time-, apparatus-, and cost-intensive process. Sensitive screening tests for characterizing the overall {{function of the}} hemostatic system, or defined parts of it, would be very useful. For this purpose, we are developing an electrochemical biosensor system that allows measurement of thrombin generation in whole blood {{as well as in}} plasma. METHODS: The measuring system consists of a single-use electrochemical sensor {{in the shape of a}} strip and a measuring unit connected to a personal computer, recording the electrical signal. Blood is added to a specific reagent mixture immobilized in dry form on the strip, including a coagulation activator (e. g., tissue factor or silica) and an electrogenic substrate specific to thrombin. RESULTS: Increasing thrombin concentrations gave standard curves with progressively increasing maximal current and decreasing time to reach the peak. Because the measurement was unaffected by color or turbidity, any type of blood sample could be analyzed: platelet-poor plasma, platelet-rich plasma, and whole blood. The test strips with the <b>predried</b> reagents were stable when stored for several months before testing. Analysis of the combined results obtained with different activators allowed discrimination between defects of the extrinsic, intrinsic, and common coagulation pathways. Activated protein C (APC) <b>predried</b> on the strips allowed identification of APC-resistance in plasma and whole blood samples.

Preservative absorption was calculated from the log weight before and after preservative impregnation. Impregnated logs were then dried {{in the air and}} cut at the center to determine preservative penetration. The penetration area was determined after visualizing the preservative with chrome azurol S. The visualized area indicated that the preservative solution penetrated into the sapwood portion of almost all the air-dried logs. However, the kiln-dried logs did not show full penetration into the sapwood portion. The visualized area of some kiln-dried sapwood showed a penetration value of less than 80 %, which is the minimum requirement set by the Japanese Agricultural Standard (JAS) for sawn timber. Statistical analysis showed that penetration in the air-dried sapwood was significantly better than that in the kiln-dried sapwood.

Most analyses show that CO{sub 2 } compression will {{have a significant effect on}} parasitic load, will be a major capital cost, and will contribute significantly to reduced unit efficiency. This project used first principle engineering analyses and computer simulations to determine the effects of utilizing compressor waste heat to improve power plant efficiency and increase net power output of coal-fired power plants with carbon capture. This was done for units with post combustion solvent-based CO{sub 2 } capture systems and for oxyfired power plants, firing bituminous, PRB and lignite coals. The thermal integration opportunities analyzed for oxycombustion capture are use of compressor waste heat to reheat recirculated flue gas, preheat boiler feedwater and <b>predry</b> high-moisture coals prior to pulverizing the coal. Among the thermal integration opportunities analyzed for post combustion capture systems are use of compressor waste heat and heat recovered from the stripper condenser to regenerate post-combustion CO{sub 2 } capture solvent, preheat boiler feedwater and <b>predry</b> high-moisture coals. The overall conclusion from the oxyfuel simulations is that thermal integration of compressor heat has the potential to improve net unit heat rate by up to 8. 4 percent, but the actual magnitude of the improvement will depend on the type of heat sink used and to a lesser extent, compressor design and coal rank. The simulations of a unit with a MEA post combustion capture system showed that thermal integration of either compressor heat or stripper condenser heat to preheat boiler feedwater would result in heat rate improvements from 1. 20 percent to 4. 19 percent. The MEA capture simulations further showed that partial drying of low rank coals, done in combination with feedwater heating, would result in heat rate reductions of 7. 43 percent for PRB coal and 10. 45 percent for lignite...|$|R
40|$|A sol-gel derived {{photochromic}} glass coating of about 1. 5 µm in thickness is synthesized by infiltration of Ag+ into a <b>predried</b> Na-Al-B-Si gel layer. The formation of small Ag colloids is initiated by a soft heat treatment and the colloids are converted by a HCl vapour treatment into AgCl crystallites of about 40 nm in diameter. The coating darkens by UV irradiation, forming Ag crystallites of about 5 nm in size. This process is completely reversible at 400 °C and no decay is observed in numerous cycles. An amplitude hologram which {{acts as a}} diffraction grating with a grating period of about 10 µm can be produced within this layer by a two-wave mixing experiment with laser light of 351 nm wavelength. The diffraction efficiency of this grating is determined to 0. 11 %. After thermal erasing the diffraction pattern can be rewritten and erased repeatedly without any loss of efficiency...|$|R
40|$|We {{performed}} a 15 -month study using 11 clinical strains and 1 control strain (ATCC 27853) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa {{to determine whether}} changes in the manufacturing process of Sensititre <b>predried</b> panels result in a reliable test of susceptibility to imipenem. MIC and breakpoint susceptibility results remained stable during the manufacturer's recommended shelf life of 18 months and compared well with standard agar disk diffusion and broth macrodilution results. Imipenem concentrations measured by high-pressure liquid chromatography were acceptable through 15 months but declined in the breakpoint panels by approximately 50 % at 18 months. Between 9 months and panel expiration, 13 of 141 (9 %) of the MIC panel packages had moisture entry, as indicated by pink desiccants, with a resultant loss of imipenem activity of 32 to 100 %. It appears that the new manufacturing process produces MIC panels that are reliable for imipenem susceptibility testing until the labeled expiration date, provided that packages containing pink desiccants are not used...|$|R
