5000|$|Adobe Audition 6, {{also more}} {{commonly}} known as Audition CC, was released on 17 June 2013. It {{is the first in}} the Audition line {{to be part of the}} Adobe Creative Cloud. Also, Audition CC is now the first 64-bit [...] application in the Audition line. This can provide faster processing time when compared to Audition CS6. New features include sound remover, preview editor and <b>pitch</b> <b>bender.</b>|$|E
5000|$|An unusual {{feature of}} the DK70 is that, while {{it appears to have}} the form factor of a {{standard}} synth, it has guitar strap pegs and {{can be used as a}} keytar. (The Poly-800 also had this feature.) An accessory called the [...] "Stage Set" [...] can be attached to the left side to provide a grip (similar to that of the SH-101), where the player may manipulate a ribbon-style <b>pitch</b> <b>bender,</b> as well as have access to buttons that change patches, change octaves and engage the LFOmodulation.|$|E
5000|$|In 2008, Moog Music {{released}} the Minimoog Voyager Old School (Voyager OS). The Voyager OS has enhanced modulation busses with more sources {{on the panel}} {{to compensate for the}} lack of software and an operating system. The Voyager OS also does not have a touch pad or MIDI inputs and outputs. Unlike other Voyagers, it features a keyboard pitch CV out and keyboard gate CV out, without the aid of the VX-351. The Voyager OS's <b>pitch</b> <b>bender</b> is set to +/- 7 semitones, and can be modified by an internal jumper. The OS is sold with one wood panelling option, [...] "traditional ash". However, a few limited edition models were housed in white wash cabinets. The Voyager Old School was discontinued in 2009.|$|E
50|$|In {{his last}} days, Bender {{remained}} close friends with Athletics coach Bing Miller, {{who used to}} bring Bender a container of ice cream almost every day. Bender was hospitalized in Philadelphia in mid-April 1954. He died there on May 22, 1954 of prostate cancer. He had also been suffering from cardiac problems. While he had been hospitalized, Bender sent Marie to Shibe Park for each home game {{so that she could}} report back to him on his team's <b>pitching.</b> <b>Bender</b> was buried in the Philadelphia suburb of Roslyn, Pennsylvania.|$|R
5000|$|After solid {{seasons in}} 1906 (15-10, 2.53), 1907 (16-8, 2.05), 1908 (8-9 despite a 1.75 ERA) and 1909 (18-8, 1.66), {{he led the}} Athletics to the AL pennant in 1910 as Philadelphia went 102-48, 14 1/2 games ahead of the second-place New York Yankees. Bender led the AL in winning % at [...]821, going 23-5 with a 1.58 ERA. He went 1-1 with 1.93 ERA in the World Series as the A's beat, in five games, the Chicago Cubs, who had gone 104-50 in the regular season. <b>Bender</b> <b>pitched</b> a complete-game three-hitter in the opener, {{striking}} out 8 and giving up only one unearned run. He lost game 4 of the series in another complete game effort, 4-3 in 10 innings. <b>Bender</b> <b>pitched</b> all 9 2/3 innings for the Athletics, striking out 6.|$|R
50|$|In 1919, <b>Bender</b> <b>pitched</b> in {{the minor}} leagues for the Richmond Colts of the Virginia League. He earned a 29-2 record that year. He spent the next three seasons as a player-manager; the first two seasons were with the New Haven Weissmen/Indians, and the third was with the Class AA Reading Aces. For the 1920 New Haven team, Bender {{recorded}} 25 wins as a pitcher. His record declined to 13-7 in 1921 and 8-13 in 1922.|$|R
50|$|The HT-700 was {{the user}} {{programmable}} {{version of the}} MT-600 (hence the prefix HT). It included the fully editable SD synthesis of the HZ-600, plus it took the auto-accompaniment of the MT-600 and made it fully editable too (a very rare and powerful feature). Users could fully program their own 2-measure patterns consisting of drums, basslines and chord inversions. The fill-in measure was also programmable. The HT-700 had 49 mini-keys and a <b>pitch</b> <b>bender,</b> and looked somewhat similar to the MT-600. Unlike the MT-600, though, it included a programming wheel and a card slot for Casio RA-100 RAM cards. The HT-700 and other HT synths could not store nearly as many patches to a RAM card as the HZ-600, {{because most of the}} RAM card capacity was reserved to store accompaniment patterns and chord/operation sequences. The HT-700 was also sold by Hohner in Germany as the 'KS-49 midi' (with slightly different preset sound set).|$|E
