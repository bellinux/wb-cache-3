5000|$|<b>In</b> {{addition}} to <b>praying</b> <b>in</b> the Spirit, many Pentecostal and charismatic churches practice {{what is known}} as singing in the Spirit. The Apostle [...] "Paul’s definition of spiritual songs - is singing in the Spirit which is singing in tongues (1 Corinthians 14:15). Paul made it clear that <b>praying</b> <b>in</b> the Spirit was <b>praying</b> <b>in</b> tongues because it was in direct contrast to praying with the understanding or the language that could not be understood in the context of human languages (1 Corinthians 14:14, 16-18)" ...|$|R
5|$|The first {{church on}} {{this site was}} built in Saxon times, as the Port of Bristol first began. In medieval times, St. Mary Redcliffe, sitting on a red cliff above the River Avon, was a sign to seafarers, who would <b>pray</b> <b>in</b> it at their departure, and give thanks there upon their return. The church was built and beautified by Bristol's wealthy merchants, who paid to have masses sung for their souls and {{many of whom are}} commemorated there.|$|E

Many of the survivors encountered similar reactions.|$|E

25|$|The resentful Prince Vasily Shuisky, {{head of the}} boyars, {{began to}} plot against the tsar, accusing Dmitry of {{spreading}} Roman Catholicism, Lutheranism, and sodomy.

25|$|A {{wide range}} of other devotional {{practices}} can be found among Catholics. An example {{is the use of}} a Home Altar.

25|$|The mantic {{calendar}} {{has proven}} to be particularly resistant to the onslaughts of time (that is, of colonial repression, liberalism, ethnocide, and free market). Nowadays, a 'daykeeper', or divinatory priest, may stand in front of a fire, and <b>pray</b> <b>in</b> Maya to entities such as the 260 days; the cardinal directions; the ancestors of those present; important Mayan towns and archaeological sites; lakes, caves, or volcanoes; and deities from the Popol Vuh.

25|$|As {{with other}} Jews, during Shabbat, Karaites attend synagogues to worship {{and to offer}} prayers.

Their prayer books are composed almost completely of Biblical passages.

The program was promoted at the 2005 National Scout Jamboree and shown as having BSA approval in the UUSO membership brochure and the Living Your Religion Guidebook. The UUA had stated that the UUSO is not recognized as an affiliate organization. The UUSO released the Religion and Family program for Webelos Scouts in February 2008.|$|E
25|$|These {{differences}} {{reflect a}} general philosophical difference between Haredi Judaism, which emphasizes strict interpretations {{in order to}} prevent possible transgressions, and Modern Orthodox Judaism, which is more likely to utilize leniencies rooted in classical rabbinic sources. The difference has tended to increase the social distance between Haredi and Modern Orthodox Jews, as Haredi Jews who follow the stricter interpretation may find themselves unable to <b>pray</b> <b>in</b> some Modern Orthodox synagogues. As a result, and consistent with the general increasing influence of Haredi interpretations, many synagogues in recent years have raised the height of their mechitzot in order to accommodate members and guests who follow stricter interpretations.|$|E
