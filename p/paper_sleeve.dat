2500|$|Byrdmaniax {{was again}} reissued in Japan in the Blu-Spec High Definition audio format on February 14, 2014. Bonus tracks Include the Mono promotional single version of 'Glory, Glory', a live version of 'I Trust', the {{previously}} released bonus tracks of 'Think I'm Gonna Feel better' and 'Just Like A Woman', and a newly uncovered studio song 'Nothin' To it'. The disc {{comes in a}} cd-sized gatefold <b>paper</b> <b>sleeve</b> album replica (Mini LP) with obi strip and booklet insert of notes (mostly in Japanese).|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} album featured {{an unusual}} gimmick: the album had an outer sleeve {{which was made}} to look like a plain brown paper bag (reminiscent of similarly packaged bootleg album sleeves with the title rubber-stamped on it), and the inner sleeve featured black and white line artwork which, if washed with water, would become permanently fully coloured. There were also six different sleeves featuring a different pair of photos (one on each side), and the external brown <b>paper</b> <b>sleeve</b> meant that it was impossible for record buyers to tell which sleeve they were getting (there is actually a code on the spine of the album jacket which indicated which sleeve it was—this could sometimes be seen while the record was still sealed). The pictures all depicted the same scene in a bar (in which a man burns a Dear John letter), and each photo was taken from the separate point of view of someone who appeared in the other photos. [...] The walls are covered with thousands of yellowed business cards and dollar bills. The photo session in a London studio was meant to look like a re-creation of the Old Absinthe House, in New Orleans, Louisiana.|$|E

50|$|One of the LP sets was the 100 Greatest Recordings Of All Time, a {{collection}} of classical recordings selected {{by a panel of}} performers and conductors and pressed on translucent 180 gram deep red vinyl and packaged two LPs to an each album. Each LP was set into a plastic carrier that touched only the center spindle hole and the rim. There were two rereleases of this set. The second used ordinary <b>paper</b> <b>sleeves</b> inside a foldout compartment to house the LPs. The third used a side-open box and <b>paper</b> <b>sleeves.</b> In all three sets the vinyl quality was the same.|$|R
50|$|Recordings of the {{canaries}} {{were also}} available on 78 rpm and 45 rpm records, each packaged inside <b>paper</b> <b>sleeves.</b> The records were produced by Arthur C. Barnett, who also released a related instructional record.|$|R

5000|$|Use {{polyethylene}} inner sleeves. Never use PVC sleeves {{as their}} chemical makeup {{is too close}} to vinyl and may cause imprints or fuse to the LP. Replace <b>paper</b> <b>sleeves</b> as <b>paper</b> deteriorates, leaving oil and paper residue.|$|R

25|$|Both {{the disc}} records, and the {{machines}} to play them, were cheaper to mass-produce than {{the products of}} the cylinder system. Disc records were also easier and cheaper to store in bulk, as they could be stacked, or when in <b>paper</b> <b>sleeves</b> put in rows on shelves like books—packed together more densely than cylinder recordings.|$|R

50|$|In {{an effort}} to save money on production, Nintendo opted to not use disk {{shutters}} (a feature seen on 89 mm (3.5 in) floppy disks) to keep dirt out, instead opting to include wax <b>paper</b> <b>sleeves</b> as with the older 133 mm (5.25 in) disks. The only exception to this were certain games that were specially released on blue disks, which do have shutters.|$|R

5000|$|Triumph Records was a UK {{record label}} {{set up in}} January 1960 by Joe Meek and William Barrington-Coupe with the {{financial}} backing of Major Wilfred Alonzo Banks. The label existed {{for less than a}} year and although most of the artistes are unknown, many of the records now sell for high prices in the record collecting world because of Meek's involvement. Even the original <b>paper</b> <b>sleeves</b> command some value.|$|R
5000|$|Radiex {{records were}} standard, lateral-cut, {{double-sided}} 78 rpm discs pressed in various colours of shellac which generally wore down easily. The earliest <b>paper</b> <b>sleeves</b> in which Radiex records were sold described them as [...] "The Record of Beauty." [...] The issues are popular vocal and dance {{numbers of the}} era, from masters recorded by Grey Gull, Plaza Music, Emerson Records, and sometimes Paramount Records.

50|$|Inappropriate storage {{containers}} and repair attempts: Cabinets made of inferior materials can give off harmful gases, while other reactive {{materials such as}} acidic <b>paper</b> <b>sleeves,</b> rubber bands, <b>paper</b> clips, pressure sensitive tape, and glues and adhesives commonly used for storage and repairs in the past can also cause chemical deterioration. Storing items too loosely, too tightly, or in enclosures that do not provide adequate physical protection can all cause physical damage such as curling and breakage.|$|R

50|$|A chopstick rest is tableware, {{similar to}} a knife rest or a spoon rest, used to keep chopstick tips {{off the table and}} to prevent used chopsticks from contaminating or rolling off tables.
