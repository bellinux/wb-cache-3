50|$|Beginning {{with the}} Industrial Revolution era, a {{workshop}} {{may be a}} room, rooms or building which provides both the area and tools (or machinery) that may be required for the manufacture or repair of manufactured goods. Workshops were the only <b>places</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> until the advent of industrialization {{and the development of}} larger factories. In the 20th and 21st century, many Western homes contain a workshop in the garage, basement, or an external shed. Home workshops typically contain a workbench, hand tools, power tools and other hardware.|$|E
30|$|In the agro-food sector, the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> is {{connected}} to important quality features (also see previous section). Thus, sharing the same <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> may imply sharing quality and reputation. This link between the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> and product reputation is twofold. In fact, the produce is reputed after the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> origin in case the last is already renowned {{for the quality of}} its products. However, also the reverse holds: some places gain status after the increased fame of their products. In this sense, sharing the same location calls for location economies and reputational linkages and is a source for the need of collective action.|$|R

50|$|Due {{to their}} use as plasticizers, diethyl {{phthalates}} are ubiquitous in the environment, especially near <b>places</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> and use. Biodegradation through microbially-mediated processes {{can result in}} products that can potentially harm microorganisms.There is also general evidence of widespread human exposure.Non-occupational exposure results from the diet, for example phthalate-coated medicines and nutritional supplements, and through consumer products. High occupational exposure was observed in workers directly manufacturing plasticizers.Studies suggest a high correlation between air and urine sample concentrations of short side-chain phthalates such as DEP, making inhalation an important route of exposure.|$|E
50|$|A {{commodity}} {{chain is}} a process used by firms to gather resources, transform them into goods or commodities, and finally, distribute them to consumers. It {{is a series of}} links connecting the many <b>places</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> and distribution and resulting in a commodity that is then exchanged on the world market. In short, it is the connected path from which a good travels from producers to consumers. Commodity chains can be unique depending on the product types or the types of markets. Different stages of a commodity chain can also involve different economic sectors or be handled by the same business.|$|E

In a letter to Count Alessio Suardo in 1881 he underlined the necessity of sodium chloride in the tissues and blood, the need for its adequate presence in common food and its physiological and therapeutic uses, concluding in favor of a gradual elimination of the tax on salt.|$|E

50|$|Prehistoric Europe saw {{a growing}} population. It has been {{estimated}} that in about 5000 BC during the Neolithic between 2 million and 5 million lived in Europe; in the Late Iron Age it had an estimated population of around 15 to 30 million. Outside Greece and Italy, which were more densely populated, the vast majority of settlements in the Iron Age were small, with perhaps no more than 50 inhabitants. Hill forts were the exception, and were the home of up to 1,000 people. With the emergence of oppida in the Late Iron Age, settlements could reach as large as 10,000 inhabitants. As the population increased so did the complexity of prehistoric societies. Around 1100 BC hill forts emerged and in the following centuries spread through Europe. They served a range of purposes and were variously tribal centres, defended places, foci of ritual activity, and <b>places</b> <b>of</b> <b>production.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Tushe was {{considered}} {{as the most}} talented master for producing and decoration of celinas. The long rifles and those of waist of Gjakova, produced [...] "in the Albanian fashion", decorated with gold and silver had become well-known all over Europe since the 18th century. However, according to Franz Noptsche, Gjakova became well-known later also for the producing of [...] "martin" [...] type guns and was a strong competitor in selling this product in the home market. But this gun model {{as well as other}} guns of Albanian fashion were sold also abroad in most distant markets. Gjakovar gunsmiths used to produce also other necessary equipment for the use of guns, such as circles, which were in use until the 1860s and 1870s, until the beginning of use of fire guns with “viaskas”. Although initially the Gjakovar gunsmiths produced rifles, later they shifted exclusively to bullet producing. Among other things, they would go to cattle fairs in Ivanjica, where they would successfully sell their products. The Gjakova craftsmen used to produce cartridges for the rebels of Karageorge. According to Sami Frashëri in Gjakova guns, silver, Albanian national costumes and some kinds of silk fabrics were produced. The trade was very much developed there. Often Albanian guns were called (labelled) by the names of <b>places</b> <b>of</b> <b>production.</b> Thus, among other things, the Gjakovars (the hunt guns) were well known, guns that were decorated according to the “people’s school” style of the 18th century of the famous gunsmith and silversmith Tusha.|$|E

The 'postindustrial' forest, in which the emphasis placed on timber production is reduced relative to that placed on environmental services (such as biodiversity and recreation), epitomises the character of postproductive forestry.

40|$|The {{history of}} rebozos and jaspe (ikat) in Mexico still {{presents}} many enigmas and fertile field for research. Public and private collections in Mexican and foreign museums preserve {{a variety of}} rebozos from the mid- 18 th through the 20 th centuries. However, it has been complicated to correlate these extant pieces with exact <b>places</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> and dates. Other sources such as written accounts and images focus mostly on their social uses, sometimes <b>places</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> or sale are merely mentioned yet techniques and designs are the information least dealt with. Virginia Davis mentions this problem while analyzing the Frederick Church collection at the Olana Estate in the following terms, “the lack of a gamut of authenticated examples for each makes attribution difficult. 2 With the purpose of providing new clues for the historiography of the rebozo de jaspe (ikat) and other variants, and contribute to deciphering {{a part of the}} puzzle, this essay is based on a fragment of a chart published in the monthly trade journal El Correo del Comercio in October 1871, 3 under the title Efectos Nacionales (National Goods).

40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{regional}} organization of collective services in socialist countries is discussed. Social infrastructure {{is a key}} aspect of regional activity. Within socialist economies shortage, or unsatisfied demand, is a driving force which stimulates natural tendencies to management stabilization in which bureaucratic structures control the distribution of goods and services. There are two rival models of regional infrastructure provision: orientation to <b>places</b> <b>of</b> <b>production,</b> or orientation to places of residence. Within either model a hierarchical structure is necessary. It is becoming necessary in socialist countries to appraise the administrative consequences of social goods provision {{as well as of}} productive forces. This creates major challenges to link the productive and residence orientation of administration. This, in turn, suggests a need for a more flexible rather than a uniform approach to settlement planning. ...|$|E
