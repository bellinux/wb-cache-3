5|$|People with {{schizophrenia}} {{may have}} {{a high rate of}} irritable bowel syndrome but they often do not mention it unless specifically asked. <b>Psychogenic</b> polydipsia, or excessive fluid intake in the absence of physiological reasons to drink, is relatively common in people with schizophrenia.|$|E
5|$|Little {{progress}} was made over the next century in explaining or treating tics, and a <b>psychogenic</b> view prevailed well into the 20th century. The possibility that movement disorders, including Tourette syndrome, might have an organic origin was raised when an encephalitis epidemic from 1918–1926 led to a subsequent epidemic of tic disorders.|$|E
5|$|A {{high blood}} {{prolactin}} level {{within the first}} 20 minutes following a seizure {{may be useful to}} help confirm an epileptic seizure as opposed to <b>psychogenic</b> non-epileptic seizure. Serum prolactin level is less useful for detecting focal seizures. If it is normal an epileptic seizure is still possible and a serum prolactin does not separate epileptic seizures from syncope. It is not recommended as a routine part of the diagnosis of epilepsy.|$|E
5|$|Diagnosis of {{epilepsy}} can be difficult. A {{number of}} other conditions may present very similar signs and symptoms to seizures, including syncope, hyperventilation, migraines, narcolepsy, panic attacks and <b>psychogenic</b> non-epileptic seizures (PNES). In particular a syncope can {{be accompanied by a}} short episode of convulsions. Nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy, often misdiagnosed as nightmares, was considered to be a parasomnia but later identified to be an epilepsy syndrome. Attacks of the movement disorder paroxysmal dyskinesia may be taken for epileptic seizures. The cause of a drop attack can be, among many others, an atonic seizure.|$|E
5|$|Men with SCI {{rank the}} ability to father {{children}} among their highest concerns relating to sexuality. Male fertility is reduced after SCI, due {{to a combination of}} problems with erections, ejaculation, and quality of the semen. As with other types of sexual response, ejaculation can be <b>psychogenic</b> or reflexogenic, and the level of injury affects a man's ability to experience each type. As many as 95% of men with SCI have problems with ejaculation (anejaculation), possibly due to impaired coordination of input from different parts of the nervous system. Erection, orgasm, and ejaculation can each occur independently, although {{the ability to}} ejaculate seems linked {{to the quality of the}} erection, and the ability to orgasm is linked to the ejaculation facility. Even men with complete injuries may be able to ejaculate, because other nerves involved in ejaculation can effect the response without input from the spinal cord. In general, the higher the level of injury, the more physical stimulation the man needs to ejaculate. Conversely, premature or spontaneous ejaculation can be a problem for men with injuries at levels T12–L1. It can be severe enough that ejaculation is provoked by thinking a sexual thought, or for no reason at all, and is not accompanied by orgasm.|$|E
25|$|<b>Psychogenic</b> amnesia is {{supposed}} to differ from organic amnesia {{in a number of}} ways; one being that unlike organic amnesia, <b>psychogenic</b> amnesia is thought to occur when no structural damage to the brain or brain lesion is evident. Psychological triggers are instead considered as preceding <b>psychogenic</b> amnesia, and indeed many anecdotal case studies which are cited as evidence of <b>psychogenic</b> amnesia hail from traumatic experiences such as World War II. As aforementioned however, aetiology of <b>psychogenic</b> amnesia is controversial as causation is not always clear (see above paragraph), and both elements of psychological stress and organic amnesia may be present among cases. Often, but not necessarily, a premorbid history of psychiatric illness such as depression is thought to be present in conjunction to triggers of psychological stress. Lack of psychological evidence precipitating amnesia doesn't mean there isn't any, for example trauma during childhood has even been cited as triggering amnesia later in life, but such an argument runs the risk of <b>psychogenic</b> amnesia becoming an umbrella term for any amnesia of which there is no apparent organic cause. Due to organic amnesia often being difficult to detect, defining between organic and <b>psychogenic</b> amnesia is not easy and often context of precipitating experiences are considered (for example, if there has been drug abuse) as well as the symptomology the patient presents with. <b>Psychogenic</b> amnesia {{is supposed}} to differ from organic amnesia qualitatively in that retrograde loss of autobiographical memory while semantic memory remains intact is said to be specific of <b>psychogenic</b> amnesia. Another difference that has been cited between organic and <b>psychogenic</b> amnesia is the temporal gradient of retrograde loss of autobiographical memory. The temporal gradient of loss in most cases of organic amnesia is said to be steepest at its most recent premorbid period, whereas for <b>psychogenic</b> amnesia the temporal gradient of retrograde autobiographical memory loss is said to be quite consistently flat. Although there is much literature on <b>psychogenic</b> amnesia as dissimilar to organic amnesia, the distinction between neurological and psychological features is often difficult to discern and remains controversial.|$|E
25|$|Differentiating <b>psychogenic</b> (perceived) {{asthenia}} {{and true}} asthenia from myasthenia is often difficult, {{and in time}} apparent <b>psychogenic</b> asthenia accompanying many chronic disorders is seen to progress into a primary weakness.|$|E
25|$|Past {{literature}} has suggested <b>psychogenic</b> amnesia can be 'situation-specific' or 'global-transient', the former referring to memory loss {{for a particular}} incident, and the latter relating to large retrograde amnesic gaps of up to many years in personal identity. The most commonly cited examples of global-transient <b>psychogenic</b> amnesia are 'fugue states', of {{which there is a}} sudden retrograde loss of autobiographical memory resulting in impairment of personal identity and usually accompanied by a period of wandering. Suspected cases of <b>psychogenic</b> amnesia have been heavily reported throughout the literature since 1935 where it was reported by Abeles and Schilder. There are many clinical anecdotes of <b>psychogenic</b> or dissociative amnesia attributed to stressor ranging from cases of child sexual abuse to soldiers returning from combat.|$|E
25|$|The {{atypical}} clinical syndrome of {{the memory}} disorder (as opposed to organic amnesia) is that a person with <b>psychogenic</b> amnesia is profoundly unable to remember personal information about themselves; {{there is a lack}} of conscious self-knowledge which affects even simple self-knowledge, such as who they are. <b>Psychogenic</b> amnesia is distinguished from organic amnesia in that it is supposed to result from a nonorganic cause; no structural brain damage or brain lesion should be evident but some form of psychological stress should precipitate the amnesia, however <b>psychogenic</b> amnesia as a memory disorder is controversial.|$|E
25|$|<b>Psychogenic</b> amnesia {{is defined}} by the {{presence}} of retrograde amnesia (the inability to retrieve stored memories leading up to the onset of amnesia), and an absence of anterograde amnesia (the inability to form new long term memories). Access to episodic memory can be impeded, while the degree of impairment to short term memory, semantic memory and procedural memory is thought to vary among cases. If other memory processes are affected, they are usually much less severely affected than retrograde autobiographical memory, which is taken as the hallmark of <b>psychogenic</b> amnesia. However the wide variability of memory impairment among cases of <b>psychogenic</b> amnesia raises questions as to its true neuropsychological criteria, as despite intense study {{of a wide range of}} cases there is little consensus of which memory deficits are specific to <b>psychogenic</b> amnesia.|$|E
25|$|The {{scores of}} V-N-H {{components}} {{provide information about}} those organic factors responsible for the dysfunction; the scores of P component indicate {{the influence of the}} <b>psychogenic</b> component. If the total score of V-N-H components is higher than the score of P component, then the organic etiology prevails over the <b>psychogenic</b> one (and vice versa).|$|E

25|$|Variations in consciousness, {{including}} forgetting {{traumatic events}} (i.e., <b>psychogenic</b> amnesia), reliving experiences (either {{in the form}} of intrusive PTSD symptoms or in ruminative preoccupation), or having episodes of dissociation.|$|E
25|$|Because <b>psychogenic</b> amnesia {{is defined}} by its lack of {{physical}} damage to the brain, treatment by physical methods is difficult. Nonetheless, distinguishing between organic and dissociative memory loss {{has been described as}} an essential first-step in effective treatments. Treatments in the past have attempted to alleve <b>psychogenic</b> amnesia by treating the mind itself, as guided by theories which range from notions such as 'betrayal theory' to account for memory loss attributed to protracted abuse by caregivers to the amnesia as a form of self-punishment in a Freudian sense, with the obliteration of personal identity as an alternative to suicide.|$|E
25|$|Patients' {{fears and}} phobias often {{incorrectly}} lead doctors to think their symptoms are <b>psychogenic,</b> {{and they are}} sometimes suspected of malingering. It takes an average of six years after the onset of symptoms before the disease is diagnosed.|$|E
25|$|<b>Psychogenic</b> amnesia is {{a common}} fictional plot device in many films and books and other media. Examples include Shakespeare's King Lear, who {{experienced}} amnesia and madness following a betrayal by his daughters; and the title character Nina in Nicolas Dalayrac's 1786 opera.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} {{conditions}} have similar symptoms to SPS, including myelopathies, dystonias, spinocerebellar degenerations, primary lateral sclerosis, neuromyotonia, and some <b>psychogenic</b> disorders. Tetanus, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, malignant hyperpyrexia, chronic spinal interneuronitis, serotonin syndrome, Multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and Isaacs syndrome {{should also be}} excluded.|$|E
25|$|In the night, or in a ship without windows, it {{is helpful}} to simply close one's eyes, or if possible, take a nap. This {{resolves}} the input conflict between the eyes and the inner ear. Napping also helps prevent <b>psychogenic</b> effects (i.e. the effect of sickness being magnified by thinking about it).|$|E
25|$|A 2012 {{paper in}} the Journal of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences {{suggested}} that Paul’s conversion experience might be understood as involving <b>psychogenic</b> events. This occurring in the overall context of Paul’s other auditory and visual experiences that the authors propose may {{have been caused by}} mood disorder associated psychotic spectrum symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Epilepsy {{monitoring}} {{is typically}} done to distinguish epileptic seizures from {{other types of}} spells, such as <b>psychogenic</b> non-epileptic seizures, syncope (fainting), sub-cortical movement disorders and migraine variants, to characterize seizures {{for the purposes of}} treatment, and to localize the region of brain from which a seizure originates for work-up of possible seizure surgery.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{cure for}} most tremors. The {{appropriate}} treatment depends on accurate diagnosis of the cause. Some tremors respond to treatment of the underlying condition. For example, in some cases of <b>psychogenic</b> tremor, treating the patient’s underlying psychological problem may cause the tremor to disappear. A few medications can help relieve symptoms temporarily.|$|E
25|$|ACE inhibitors {{may also}} be used to help {{decrease}} excessive water consumption in people with schizophrenia resulting in <b>psychogenic</b> polydipsia. A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial showed that when used for this purpose, enalapril lead to decreased consumption (determined by urine output and osmality) in 60% of people; the same effect has been demonstrated in other ACE inhibitors.|$|E
25|$|<b>Psychogenic</b> {{stuttering}} {{may also}} arise after a traumatic experience {{such as a}} grief, the breakup of a relationship or as the psychological reaction to physical trauma. Its symptoms tend to be homogeneous: the stuttering is of sudden onset and associated with a significant event, it is constant and uninfluenced by different speaking situations, {{and there is little}} awareness or concern shown by the speaker.|$|E
25|$|The several {{theories}} proposed {{range from}} religious cults being behind the processions to people dancing to relieve themselves {{of stress and}} put the poverty of the period out of their minds. It is, however, {{thought to have been}} a mass <b>psychogenic</b> illness in which the occurrence of similar physical symptoms, with no known physical cause, affect a large or small group of people as a form of social influence.|$|E
25|$|Habit {{drinking}} (in its severest form termed <b>psychogenic</b> polydipsia) is {{the most}} common imitator of diabetes insipidus at all ages. While many adult cases in the medical literature are associated with mental disorders, most patients with habit polydipsia have no other detectable disease. The distinction is made during the water deprivation test, as some degree of urinary concentration above isoosmolar is usually obtained before the patient becomes dehydrated.|$|E
25|$|Status epilepticus {{may occur}} {{in those with}} a history of {{epilepsy}} as well as those with an underlying problem of the brain. These underlying brain problems may include trauma, infections, or strokes among others. Diagnosis often involves checking the blood sugar, imaging of the head, a number of blood tests, and an electroencephalogram. <b>Psychogenic</b> nonepileptic seizures may present similarly. Other conditions that may also appear to be SE include low blood sugar, movement disorders, meningitis, and delirium among others.|$|E
25|$|This symptom is {{very common}} and is often seen as {{a side effect of}} many types of medication. It is more common in older people (mostly because this group tend to take several medications) and in persons who breathe through their mouths (mouthbreathing). Dehydration, {{radiotherapy}} involving the salivary glands, and several diseases can cause hyposalivation or a change in saliva consistency and hence a complaint of xerostomia. Sometimes there is no identifiable cause, and there may be a <b>psychogenic</b> reason for the complaint.|$|E
25|$|An {{evolutionary}} psychology explanation for conversion disorder {{is that the}} symptoms may have been evolutionarily advantageous during warfare. A non-combatant with these symptoms signals non-verbally, possibly to someone speaking a different language, that she or he is not dangerous as a combatant and also may be carrying some form of dangerous infectious disease. This can explain that conversion disorder may develop following a threatening situation, {{that there may be}} a group effect with many people simultaneously developing similar symptoms (as in mass <b>psychogenic</b> illness), and the gender difference in prevalence.|$|E
25|$|Treatment {{attempts}} {{often have}} revolved {{around trying to}} discover what traumatic event had caused the amnesia, and drugs such as intravenously administered barbiturates (often thought of as 'truth serum') were popular as treatment for <b>psychogenic</b> amnesia during World War II; benzodiazepines may have been substituted later. 'Truth serum' drugs were thought to work by making a painful memory more tolerable when expressed through relieving the strength of an emotion attached to a memory. Under the influence of these 'truth' drugs the patient would more readily talk about what had occurred to them. However, information elicited from patients {{under the influence of}} drugs such as barbiturates would be a mixture of truth and fantasy, and was thus not regarded as scientific in gathering accurate evidence for past events. Often treatment was aimed at treating the patient as a whole, and probably varied in practice in different places. Hypnosis was also popular as a means for gaining information from people about their past experiences, but like 'truth' drugs really only served to lower the threshold of suggestibility so that the patient would speak easily but not necessarily truthfully. If no motive for the amnesia was immediately apparent, deeper motives were usually sought by questioning the patient more intensely, often in conjunction with hypnosis and 'truth' drugs. In many cases, however, patients were found to spontaneously recover from their amnesia on their own accord so no treatment was required.|$|E

500|$|The body's {{physical}} arousal response (vaginal lubrication and engorgement of the clitoris {{in women}} and erection in men) occurs due to two separate pathways which normally work together: [...] and reflex. Arousal due to fantasies, visual input, or other mental stimulation is a <b>psychogenic</b> sexual experience, and arousal resulting from physical contact to the genital area is reflexogenic. In <b>psychogenic</b> arousal, messages travel {{from the brain}} via the spinal cord to the nerves in the genital area. The <b>psychogenic</b> pathway is served by the spinal cord at levels T11–L2. [...] Thus people injured above {{the level of the}} T11 vertebra do not usually experience <b>psychogenic</b> erection or vaginal lubrication, but those with an injury below T12 can. Even without these physical responses, people with SCI often feel aroused, just as uninjured people do. The ability to feel the sensation of a pinprick and light touch in the dermatomes for T11–L2 predicts how well the ability to have <b>psychogenic</b> arousal is preserved in both sexes. Input from the <b>psychogenic</b> pathway is sympathetic, {{and most of the time}} it sends inhibitory signals that prevent the physical arousal response; in response to sexual stimulation, excitatory signals are increased and inhibition is reduced. Removing the inhibition that is normally present allows the spinal reflexes that trigger the arousal response to take effect.|$|E
500|$|The reflexogenic pathway {{activates}} the parasympathetic {{nervous system}} {{in response to the}} sensation of touch. It is mediated by a reflex arc that goes to the spinal cord (not to the brain) and is served by the sacral segments of the spinal cord at S2–S4. A woman with a spinal cord lesion above T11 {{may not be able to}} experience <b>psychogenic</b> vaginal lubrication, but may still have reflex lubrication if her sacral segments are uninjured. Likewise, although a man's ability to get a <b>psychogenic</b> erection when mentally aroused may be impaired after a higher-level SCI, he may still be able to get a reflex or [...] "spontaneous" [...] erection. These erections may result in the absence of psychological arousal when the penis is touched or brushed, e.g. by clothing, but they do not last long and are generally lost when the stimulus is removed. Reflex erections may increase in frequency after SCI, due to the loss of inhibitory input from the brain that would suppress the response in an uninjured man. Conversely, an injury below the S1 level impairs reflex erections but not <b>psychogenic</b> erections. People who have some preservation of sensation in the dermatomes at the S4 and S5 levels and display a bulbocavernosus reflex (contraction of the pelvic floor in response to pressure on the clitoris or glans penis) are usually able to experience reflex erections or lubrication. Like other reflexes, reflexive sexual responses may be lost immediately after injury but return over time as the individual recovers from spinal shock.|$|E
500|$|Non-dental {{causes of}} {{toothache}} {{are much less}} common as compared with dental causes. [...] In a toothache of neurovascular origin, pain is reported in the teeth {{in conjunction with a}} migraine. Local and distant structures (such as ear, brain, carotid artery, or heart) can also refer pain to the teeth. Other non-dental causes of toothache include myofascial pain (muscle pain) and angina pectoris (which classically refers pain to the lower jaw). [...] Very rarely, toothache can be <b>psychogenic</b> in origin.|$|E
