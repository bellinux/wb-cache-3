40|$|LectureVertical motor/pump {{systems that}} run {{close to the}} motor reed {{frequency}} may experience significantly high vibration levels, which can damage the motor {{as well as the}} entire pump system. These damages can result in costly repairs of the motor/pump, therefore accurate prediction of motor reed frequency will enable a more cost- and performance-effective <b>pump</b> <b>base</b> design and will extend system life. A recent trend has shown that end users are requesting more accurate prediction of motor reed frequency (+/- 10 %), enabling better <b>pump</b> <b>base</b> design with less potential for base rework. This study describes the utilization of Finite Element Analysis (FEA) as a tool in the prediction of vertical motor reed frequency and its correlation with extensive bump test results. Preliminary analysis first identified parameters that affect motor reed frequency. It was then followed by sensitivity studies, which further examined the impact of each parameter. One of the critical parameters is the stator core modulus. Because of its laminated structure, the core modulus is not uniform, which has a significant effect on motor reed frequency. The critical parameters were calibrated against existing test data using design of experiments. Lastly, they were used to verify future motor performance. This paper discusses the background behind the analysis, the FEA verification process as well as test validation...|$|E

The data indicated that the problem was due to the operating speed being near the pump-motor system mechanical natural frequency, which resulted in excessive vibration levels on the motors and pump impellers. The mechanical natural frequency was very sensitive to the effective stiffness of the connections between the concrete, baseplates, <b>pump</b> <b>base</b> and motor flange. Tests were conducted to evaluate {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} lowering the natural frequency below the running speed and raising the natural frequency above the running speed.

The low efficiency of traditional heat pump is an obstacle for development. In recent years, chemical heat <b>pumps</b> <b>based</b> on reversible chemical reactions were introduced, which can improve the efficiency and have a great potential. The hemiaminal reaction, {{which is one of the}} chemical reactions, can be potentially used in chemical heat <b>pump</b> <b>based</b> on reversible chemical reactions. In this paper, simulations of hemiaminal reactions and simulated process design of heat <b>pump</b> <b>based</b> on hemiaminal reaction is discussed. Two ways were used to calculate the equilibrium constant of hemiaminal reaction: 1) density functional theory(DFT) and 2) neural network (NN). And based on the simulated equilibrium constant, the whole process was simulated in Aspen Plus and simulation result shows the new chemical heat pump system can get a coefficient of performance (COP) more than 2. 5, which is higher than the literature results of other kind of chemical heat pump (between 1. 0 to 2. 4 [17]). There is a great possibility that, in the future, this kind of chemical heat pump will be widely used in different fields...|$|R

30|$|The source chamber, {{shown on}} the very left in Fig.  3, is a single squared chamber made from {{stainless}} steel in our local workshop. It contains two compartments, separated by a vertical wall, that each houses one supersonic expansion. A single turbo molecular pump (1600 l/s) is installed {{on top of the}} chamber and generates vacuum in both compartments. Cross-talk between the two half-chambers is minimised by closing off the chambers {{all the way up to}} the <b>pump.</b> <b>Base</b> pressures in this chamber are in the range of 10 − 7 mbar and rise to 10 − 5 mbar during operation. Pressure gauges monitoring the pressure in each compartment demonstrate that the separation wall does lead to a pressure differential, but that nevertheless operating one source also leads to a noticeable pressure increase in the second compartment.|$|E
40|$|Lecturepg. 7 Three {{vertical}} pumps at a wastewater {{transfer station}} {{a few miles}} away from the San Andreas Fault and next to an apartment building were the source of vibration and noise complaints. To attune the transmitted vibration, a typical isolation system was installed without a significant amount of analysis, and consisted of unrestrained <b>pump</b> <b>base</b> mount pads and flexible couplings on the suction and discharge pipes. Initial testing shows that while the base mount pads worked well, the lack of a positive seismic restraint made those devices unsuitable for use in an earthquake zone. The flexible couplings however actually increased vibration transmitted into the piping because of excessive stiffness. Based on the initial test results and site observations, a new isolation system was required. Although isolation theory is relatively simple, this paper describes how a detailed three-dimensional analytical treatment was required to properly determine the properties of the isolators, including the influence of adequate seismic restraints. Test results are included showing the redesigned system effectively isolates the pumps...|$|E

Mechanism of valveless impedance pump is to apply acoustic impedance mismatch in order to drive the flow and also consists of a flexible connection at the ends to the more rigid sections. Characteristics of liquid velocity and pressure at the <b>pump</b> <b>base</b> valveless impedance at various supply voltage and different frequencies have been discovered through experimentation. Secondly, this research also aims to discuss the effect volume flow rate (millitres / min) in the elastic tube impedance based on different parameters of the pump pinch.

This study begins with the design set up to use the software and followed by installing all equipment used for the experiments. Then, this study continues to get results and make an analysis of the impedance pump by experimentation. Results found that all the parameters used in this experiment affect the flow rate in the impedance pump. Additional experiments on the effect of the thickness of the flexible tube on the flow rate gave lower values when the flexible tube is relatively thicker...|$|E

40|$|Absorption {{heat pumps}} (AHPs) have been {{popular due to}} their ability to convert thermal waste into useful energy. This study investigates the {{applicability}} of the absorption heat pump to the Porvoo oil refinery and compares the results to the ordinary heat pump (HP). The vacuum distillation unit 2 (TT 2) and gas turbine (KTVL- 3) units were considered for the case studies. Vacuum condenser is an inseparable part of the vacuum column DA- 2201. The pressure {{at the top of the}} column DA- 2201 is determined by the temperature of the cooling water (CW) of the vacuum condenser. The temperature of the CW of 2013 was collected and analyzed. Rigorous simulation of the vacuum column overhead system was simulated in aspen plus to estimate the pressure at the top of the column DA- 2201 at various cooling water temperatures. The absorption heat <b>pump</b> <b>based</b> on lithium bromide water solution and ordinary heat <b>pumps</b> <b>based</b> on propane were simulated to generate the cooling water of 10 °C for the TT 2 unit. In addition, preheating the inlet air when required was examined for the gas turbine to avoid freezing in the filters by applying the ordinary heat <b>pump</b> <b>based</b> on propane. When the temperature of the CW was 10 °C, the pressure at the top of the column DA- 2201 was found to be 5. 3 kPa. The decrease in pressure enhanced the separation process with the higher yield of vacuum gas oils. The profit achieved due to the higher yield was also estimated. In case of preheating the atmospheric air for gas turbine, ordinary HP was compared to the existing steam-based heating system. The heat <b>pump</b> <b>based</b> on propane was found to be applicable in comparison to the absorption heat pump for both units i. e. TT 2 and KTVL- 3 units.
