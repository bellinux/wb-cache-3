5|$|Haley's {{contribution}} to the work is notable, and several scholars discuss {{how it should be}} characterized. In a view shared by Eakin, Stone and Dyson, psychobiographical writer Eugene Victor Wolfenstein writes that Haley performed the duties of a quasi-psychoanalytic Freudian <b>psychiatrist</b> <b>and</b> spiritual confessor. Gillespie suggests, and Wolfenstein agrees, that the act of self-narration was itself a transformative process that spurred significant introspection and personal change in the life of its subject.|$|E
40|$|Background. Referral between <b>psychiatrists</b> <b>and</b> spiritual workers (e. g. Christian {{pastoral}} care workers, traditional healers, imams, rabbis and others) in the heterogeneous South African (SA) society is complicated and requires investigation to establish appropriate norms.   Objective. To capture {{the views of}} some local <b>psychiatrists</b> on referral <b>and</b> collaboration between SA <b>psychiatrists</b> <b>and</b> religious or spiritual advisers.   Methods. This explorative qualitative study involved indepth, semistructured interviews with 13 local academic psychiatrists selected through purposive sampling. Each participant had a single interview {{with the aim of}} exploring themes related to the referral and collabora­tion process between <b>psychiatrists</b> <b>and</b> spiritual advisers. Theme content analysis of interview transcripts was done. Results for one of the six identified themes are reported; other results are reported elsewhere.   Results. Within the theme ‘referral <b>and</b> collaboration between <b>psychiatrists</b> <b>and</b> spiritual professionals’, three subthemes were identified: facilitating appropriate referral and intervention for individual users; information sharing and mutual awareness between disciplines; and addressing stigmatisation of users with psychiatric conditions. Conclusion. Dialogue between <b>psychiatrists</b> <b>and</b> religious or spiritual advisers should be developed on an individual practitioner and facility basis, as well as on an organised basis between representative societies. The process of formalising a relationship between local <b>psychiatrists</b> <b>and</b> different spiritual workers may, however, still have some way to go...|$|R

40|$|Background and Aims: Psychiatry in Europe is {{undergoing}} a period of rapid and significant change. This includes changes in training, changes {{in the role of}} <b>psychiatrists,</b> <b>and</b> changes in the delivery and structure of mental health services. These changes have major implications for the future job satisfaction of trainees <b>and</b> young <b>psychiatrists.</b> This presentation aims to examine common themes across Europe and discuss possible approaches to meeting these challenges. Methods: This paper uses data collected from trainees <b>and</b> young <b>psychiatrists</b> in 23 European countries via the European Federation of Psychiatric Trainees and the Association of European Psychiatrists networks of young <b>psychiatrists</b> <b>and</b> trainees to determine common issues and approaches towards resolving these. Results: Major changes currently affecting young <b>psychiatrists</b> <b>and</b> trainees include: • changes in training content and duration • increasing roles of other professions impacting on psychotherapy and prescribing • reconfiguration of mental health services Conclusions: These changes lead to both challenges and opportunities for young <b>psychiatrists</b> <b>and</b> trainees. Sharing experience across Europe will contribute to improving morale and enhancing job satisfaction. Some specific ideas will be discussed interactively with the audience...|$|R

This {{prompted}} Kübler-Ross to connect Chappell with Dougy and his family, and Chappell to create support groups for grieving children. Despite Kübler-Ross' early influence on the organization, The Dougy Center does not subscribe to the Kübler-Ross model (a series of five emotional stages experienced by survivors of an intimate's death: denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance) and has even expressed skepticism about the model.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, {{independent}} Hollywood producer Robert Lippert {{acquired the}} rights to Caligari from Matray and Universum Film AG for $50,000, and produced a film called The Cabinet of Caligari, which was released in 1962. Screenwriter Robert Bloch {{did not intend to}} write a Caligari remake, and in fact the title was forced upon his untitled screenplay by director Roger Kay. The film had few similarities to the original Caligari except for its title and a plot twist at the end, in which it is revealed the story was simply the delusion of the protagonist, who believed she was being held captive by a character named Caligari. Instead, he was her <b>psychiatrist,</b> <b>and</b> he cures her {{at the end of the}} film.|$|E

5|$|Animaniacs {{had a large}} cast of characters, {{separated}} into individual segments, with each pair or set of characters acting in its own plot. The Warners, Yakko, Wakko, and Dot, were three cartoon stars from the 1930s that were locked away in the Warner Bros. water tower until the 1990s, when they escaped. After their escape, they often interacted with Warner Bros. studio workers, including Ralph the Security Guard; Dr. Otto Scratchansniff, the studio <b>psychiatrist,</b> <b>and</b> his assistant Hello Nurse. Pinky and the Brain are two genetically altered laboratory mice who continuously plot and attempt {{to take over the}} world. Slappy Squirrel is an octogenarian cartoon star who can easily outwit antagonists and uses her wiles to educate her nephew, Skippy Squirrel, about cartoon techniques. Additional principal characters included Rita and Runt, Buttons and Mindy, Chicken Boo, Flavio and Marita (The Hip Hippos), Katie Ka-Boom, and a trio of pigeons known as The Goodfeathers.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, Jackson {{was accused}} {{of child sexual abuse}} by Evan Chandler, on behalf of his then-13-year-old child, Jordan Chandler. To the father's disapproval and concern, his son had become friends with the {{musician}} in May 1992. Allegedly under the influence of a controversial sedative administered by Evan Chandler, a dentist, his son said that Jackson had touched his penis. Evan Chandler was tape-recorded threatening to damage the singer's music career, and engaged Jackson in unsuccessful negotiations to resolve the issue with a financial settlement. Jordan Chandler then told a <b>psychiatrist</b> <b>and</b> later police that he and Jackson had engaged in acts of kissing, masturbation and oral sex. Jackson settled a civil suit out of court with the Chandler family and their legal team for $22,000,000 in January 1994. After Jordan Chandler refused to testify in the criminal proceedings, the state closed its criminal investigation citing lack of evidence, and Jackson was not charged with a crime. Jordan Chandler later admitted to lying. After Jackson's death, Evan Chandler committed suicide.|$|E
5|$|Judge José A. Cabranes {{presided over}} {{the case in the}} United States District Court for the District of Connecticut. In order to defeat a defense motion to dismiss the case in 1987, the plaintff called a number of expert {{witnesses}} including psychologist Margaret Singer, author of Cults in Our Midst, and <b>psychiatrist</b> <b>and</b> neurologist James Merikangas. Both Singer and Merikangas submitted affidavits asserting that Slee's death was related to the est training. After the defendants refused to respond to discovery requests, on January 18, 1990, the plaintiff filed a motion for default judgment, for failure of the defendants to comply with discovery, which was denied. In 1991, before the case came to trial, defendant Erhard left the country. In 1992, a jury heard the wrongful death lawsuit. During the trial, the defendants called a number of expert witnesses, including medical experts.|$|E

5|$|Norman Osborn {{is shown}} to be {{severely}} manic depressive. This has been referenced several times in a myriad of Spider-Man stories. When he is not {{under the direction of}} a <b>psychiatrist</b> <b>and</b> taking medication, he has dangerous mood swings. At the apex of his mania, he is paranoid, delusional, and suffers from visual and auditory hallucinations, including hearing the voice of his Green Goblin persona and seeing its face in the mirror rather than his own. Previously, Osborn's arrogance caused him to refuse to submit to psychiatric treatment unless forced to; he viewed mental illness as an imperfection and therefore would not admit that he is mentally ill. In later conversations with the Sentry, Osborn revealed that he had come to accept his own mental illness. After having rid of his powers after the confrontation with the Superior Spider-Man (Doctor Octopus), Osborn's sanity apparently restored but remains a villain.|$|E

5|$|The term {{maternal}} deprivation is a catch-phrase summarising {{the early}} work of <b>psychiatrist</b> <b>and</b> psychoanalyst, John Bowlby {{on the effects}} of separating infants and young children from their mother (or mother substitute) although the effect of loss of the mother on the developing child had been considered earlier by Freud and other theorists. Bowlby's work on delinquent and affectionless children and the effects of hospital and institutional care led to his being commissioned to write the World Health Organisation's report on the mental health of homeless children in post-war Europe whilst he was head of the Department for Children and Parents at the Tavistock Clinic in London after World War II. The result was the monograph Maternal Care and Mental Health published in 1951, which sets out the maternal deprivation hypothesis.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Market forces {{caused by}} managed care are shaping {{practice}} styles for both <b>psychiatrists</b> <b>and</b> primary care physicians. This study offers {{a sample of}} the attitudes of both groups of practitioners highlighting the differences. METHOD: Forty-two <b>psychiatrists</b> <b>and</b> primary care physicians (PCP) completed surveys. The responses of each group were compared using chi square analyses. RESULTS: <b>Psychiatrists</b> <b>and</b> PCPs differed significantly on their: 1) degree of comfort in the other's traditional service domain [...] with PCPs more comfortable dealing with their patients' psychiatric problems than psychiatrists were dealing with their patients' medical problems, 2) perceived barriers to effective communication-psychiatrists acknowledge their own time constraints while PCPs blame their colleagues unavailability (actually an agreement that psychiatrists' availability is a limiting factor), 3) projected areas of interface in the future [...] with psychiatrists prioritizing collaboration on health maintenance while PCPs valued collaboration on prevention and referral as equally significant. CONCLUSIONS: Conflict between needs and expectations found in this pilot study, if shown in larger studies to be representative, will impact the success of changes in practice patterns encouraged by emerging managed care initiatives. These findings suggest that the discordant expectations between <b>psychiatrists</b> <b>and</b> PCPs about the interface of their practices deserve further study...|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} {{designed}} to assess the attitudes <b>and</b> practices of <b>psychiatrists</b> <b>and</b> psychologists regarding nonerotic and erotic contact with their patients. A dual aim was to determine if there was a relationship between the attitudes involving contact with patients and the actual practices of the <b>psychiatrists</b> <b>and</b> psychologists. Data were collected, {{with the use of a}} questionnaire, from a group of <b>psychiatrists</b> <b>and</b> psychologists on the variables of: the belief in, and the utilization of nonerotic contact with patients in a therapy practice; the belief in, and the utilization of erotic contact with patients in a therapy practice; and whether both types of contact could be misunderstood by the patient. In a survey of the population of <b>psychiatrists</b> <b>and</b> psychologists of Palo Alto, California, it was found that their practices regarding nonerotic and erotic contact with patients were significantly, positively correlated with the attitudes regarding nonerotic and erotic contact with patients. The variables of age, marital status, gender, and the years in practice did not contribute to differences in psychotherapists' attitudes and in their practices of either nonerotic and erotic contact with patients. It was further concluded that of the psychotherapists that responded in Palo Alto, California, intimacy between therapist and patient was quite uncommon...|$|R
