5|$|Casa Álvarez-Buiza, {{a private}} house and {{commercial}} complex, {{was built in}} the San Juan district by Adel Franco <b>Pinna</b> between 1918–2. The building located on the Plaza de La Soledad once housed the offices of the Bank of Spain. Artistic elements include the use of lime, brick and colorful ceramics with an Andalusian influence. Casa del Cordón is a private house, built in the late Gothic style of the early 16th century, and has mullioned windows. It currently houses the Archdiocese. Casa Puebla, built in 1921, is one of the other designs of <b>Pinna,</b> who designed numerous buildings around Badajoz. It {{is one of the best}} examples of regional architecture in Andalusian style and the property has two facades, the main one featuring neo-Renaissance elements.|$|E
5|$|In {{some animals}} with mobile pinnae (like the horse), each <b>pinna</b> can be aimed {{independently}} to better receive the sound. For these animals, the pinnae help localise {{the direction of}} the sound source.|$|E
5|$|The {{outer ear}} is the {{external}} {{portion of the}} ear and includes the fleshy visible <b>pinna</b> (also called the auricle), the ear canal, and the outer layer of the eardrum (also called the tympanic membrane).|$|E

50|$|A {{distinctive}} {{feature of this}} fern is that the bottom innermost pinnule on the basal <b>pinnae</b> spans approximately the first two top innermost pinnules on the same <b>pinnae.</b>|$|R
5|$|Anomalies and malformations of the <b>pinna</b> are common. These {{anomalies}} include chromosome syndromes such as ring 18. Children {{may also}} present cases of abnormal ear canals and low ear implantation. In rare cases no <b>pinna</b> is formed (atresia), or is extremely small (microtia). Small pinnae can develop when the auricular hillocks do not develop properly. The ear canal can fail to develop {{if it does}} not channelise properly or if there is an obstruction. Reconstructive surgery to treat hearing loss is considered as an option for children older than five, with a cosmetic surgical procedure to reduce the size or change the shape of the ear is called an otoplasty. The initial medical intervention is aimed at assessing the baby's hearing and the condition of the ear canal, as well as the middle and inner ear. Depending on the results of tests, reconstruction of the outer ear is done in stages, with planning for any possible repairs {{of the rest of the}} ear.|$|E
5|$|On fertile fronds, from 1 to 15 {{elliptical}} or narrow sori can {{be found}} on the underside of each <b>pinna.</b> They are 0.5 to 1.5millimeters long, covered by translucent, pale tan indusia with somewhat jagged edges. Each sporangium holds 64 spores. The species has a chromosome number of 2n = 72 in the sporophyte; it is a diploid.|$|E
5|$|Sea silk is a {{fine fabric}} woven from the byssus threads of bivalves, {{particularly}} the pen shell (<b>Pinna</b> nobilis). It used to be produced in the Mediterranean region where these shells are endemic. It was an expensive fabric and overfishing has much reduced populations of the pen shell. There is mention in the Greek text on the Rosetta Stone (196 BCE) of this cloth being used to pay taxes.|$|E
40|$|A new fern species, Polystichum hainanicola {{belonging}} to section Haplopolystichum (Dryopteridaceae), is described and illustrated from Hainan, the southernmost province of China. Polystichum hainanicola is most similar to P. guangxiense, but the former has <b>pinnae</b> with a length to width ratio of 2. 5 - 2. 7, lamina completely fertile and sori fewer than four above midrib of middle <b>pinnae.</b> In contrast, {{the latter has}} <b>pinnae</b> with a length to width ratio of ca. 3 : 1, lamina sterile in its lower portion and sori 6 - 11 above midrib of middle <b>pinnae...</b>|$|R
2500|$|The rachis (central {{axis of the}} leaf) is {{shiny and}} hairless, reddish or purplish brown at the base fading to green towards the tip. The <b>pinnae,</b> when present, are {{triangular}} to narrowly triangular, [...] in length and [...] in width. Exceptional specimens may reach [...] in length and [...] in width. The bases of the <b>pinnae</b> are squared off or obtusely angled, and have small lobes on either side. The edges of the <b>pinnae</b> may be smooth, or have small sharp or rounded teeth. The tips of the <b>pinnae</b> vary from blunt to sharp.|$|R
500|$|Adiantum viridimontanum is a medium-sized, deciduous, {{terrestrial}} fern, about [...] {{wide and}} [...] high. Its fronds range from [...] in length {{from the base}} of the stem to the tip. Like many ferns, the frond of A.viridimontanum is divided into a series of leaflets, known as <b>pinnae,</b> and the <b>pinnae</b> are further divided into pinnules. The shape of the frond in A.pedatum, A.aleuticum, and A.viridimontanum is very similar. They are usually described as having a rachis that forks into two branches, which curve outwards and backwards. Several <b>pinnae</b> grow from the outer side of the curve of each rachis branch, with the longest <b>pinnae</b> located closest to the fork of the rachis. The fingerlike <b>pinnae</b> are pinnately divided into short-stalked pinnules.|$|R
5|$|The <b>pinna</b> helps {{direct sound}} through {{the ear canal}} to the eardrum. The complex {{geometry}} of ridges on the inner surface of some mammalian ears helps to sharply focus sounds produced by prey, using echolocation signals. These ridges {{can be regarded as}} the acoustic equivalent of a fresnel lens, and may be seen {{in a wide range of}} animals, including the bat, aye-aye, lesser galago, bat-eared fox, mouse lemur and others.|$|E
5|$|Two sets {{of muscles}} are {{associated}} with the outer ear: the intrinsic and extrinsic muscles. In some mammals, these muscles can adjust the direction of the <b>pinna.</b> In humans, these muscles have little or no effect. The ear muscles are supplied by the facial nerve, which also supplies sensation to the skin of the ear itself, {{as well as to the}} external ear cavity. The great auricular nerve, auricular nerve, auriculotemporal nerve, and lesser and greater occipital nerves of the cervical plexus all supply sensation to parts of the outer ear and the surrounding skin.|$|E
5|$|Sound that {{travels through}} the outer ear {{impacts on the}} eardrum, and causes it to vibrate. The three {{ossicles}} bones transmit this sound to a second window (the oval window) which protects the fluid-filled inner ear. In detail, the <b>pinna</b> of the outer ear helps to focus a sound, which impacts on the eardrum. The malleus rests on the membrane, and receives the vibration. This vibration is transmitted along the incus and stapes to the oval window. Two small muscles, the tensor tympani and stapedius, also help modulate noise. The two muscles reflexively contract to dampen excessive vibrations. Vibration of the oval window causes vibration of the endolymph within the vestibule and the cochlea.|$|E
50|$|The fronds {{grow from}} 30-80 cm long and 5-12 cm broad, divided into 20-35 pairs of {{leaflets}} or <b>pinnae.</b> Each <b>pinnae</b> is typically 4 cm long {{and has a}} finely serrulate or spiny edge and is oblong to falcate in shape. The fine teeth or spines on edge of the leaf point toward {{the tip of the}} leaflet. Each <b>pinnae</b> has a triangular lobe at its base which points toward the distal end (tip) of the leaf; this protrusion is approximately 5 mm wide and equally tall and its tip bears a small spine.The lowest two leaflets are typically downward pointing and opposite to each other. The leaves are overall a dark green and rather leathery and thick in texture, their undersides may be covered in very sparse hairs; their shape can be described as linear to lanceolate shaped. The light brown spores are produced on <b>pinnae</b> which are conspicuously smaller than the <b>pinnae</b> below them; these <b>pinnae</b> are located {{at the tip of the}} frond.—these <b>pinnae</b> can be described as acrostichoid as the sporangia covers almost the entirety of the underside of the leaf surface. Acrostichoid is also the term from which P. acrostichoides derives its species name.|$|R
50|$|The rachis (central {{axis of the}} leaf) is {{shiny and}} hairless, reddish or purplish brown at the base fading to green towards the tip. The <b>pinnae,</b> when present, are {{triangular}} to narrowly triangular, 5 to 30 mm in length and 3 to 10 mm in width. Exceptional specimens may reach 80 mm in length and 15 mm in width. The bases of the <b>pinnae</b> are squared off or obtusely angled, and have small lobes on either side. The edges of the <b>pinnae</b> may be smooth, or have small sharp or rounded teeth. The tips of the <b>pinnae</b> vary from blunt to sharp.|$|R
50|$|Adiantum viridimontanum is a medium-sized, deciduous, {{terrestrial}} fern, about 2 ft {{wide and}} 1 to 2 ft high. Its fronds range from 30 to 75 cm in length {{from the base}} of the stem to the tip. Like many ferns, the frond of A. viridimontanum is divided into a series of leaflets, known as <b>pinnae,</b> and the <b>pinnae</b> are further divided into pinnules. The shape of the frond in A. pedatum, A. aleuticum, and A. viridimontanum is very similar. They are usually described as having a rachis that forks into two branches, which curve outwards and backwards. Several <b>pinnae</b> grow from the outer side of the curve of each rachis branch, with the longest <b>pinnae</b> located closest to the fork of the rachis. The fingerlike <b>pinnae</b> are pinnately divided into short-stalked pinnules.|$|R
5|$|The <b>pinna</b> {{consists}} of {{a single piece of}} elastic cartilage with a complicated relief on its inner surface and a fairly smooth configuration on its posterior surface. A tubercle, known as Darwin's tubercle, is sometimes present, lying in the descending part of the helix and corresponding to the ear-tip of mammals. The earlobe {{consists of}} areola and adipose tissue. The symmetrical arrangement of the two ears allows for the localisation of sound. The brain accomplishes this by comparing arrival-times and intensities from each ear, in circuits located in the superior olivary complex and the trapezoid bodies which are connected via pathways to both ears.|$|E
5|$|The <b>pinna</b> {{consists}} of the curving outer rim called the helix, the inner curved rim called the antihelix, and opens into the ear canal. The tragus protrudes and partially obscures the ear canal, as does the facing antitragus. The hollow region {{in front of the}} ear canal is called the concha. The ear canal stretches for about 1inch (2.5cm). The first part of the canal is surrounded by cartilage, while the second part near the eardrum is surrounded by bone. This bony part is known as the auditory bulla and is formed by the tympanic part of the temporal bone. The skin surrounding the ear canal contains ceruminous and sebaceous glands that produce protective ear wax. The ear canal ends at the external surface of the eardrum.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{structures}} of the inner and middle ear, which develop from pharyngeal pouches, the ear canal originates from the dorsal portion of the first pharyngeal cleft. It is fully expanded {{by the end of}} the 18th week of development. The eardrum is made up of three layers (ectoderm, endoderm and connective tissue). The <b>pinna</b> originates as a fusion of six hillocks. The first three hillocks are derived from the lower part of the first pharyngeal arch and form the tragus, crus of the helix, and helix, respectively. The final three hillocks are derived from the upper part of the second pharyngeal arch and form the antihelix, antitragus, and earlobe. The outer ears develop in the lower neck. As the mandible forms they move towards their final position level with the eyes.|$|E
25|$|It {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} to its parent, A.pinnatifidum. The two can be distinguished by the narrow-stalked <b>pinnae</b> of A.×trudellii, as the basal <b>pinnae</b> of A.pinnatifidum are broad-stalked or adnate (fused) with the rachis.|$|R
40|$|Although {{there have}} been many anatomical, physiological, and psychophysical studies of {{auditory}} development in cat, {{there have been}} no comparable studies of the development of the sound pressured transformations by the cat head and <b>pinnae.</b> Because the physical dimensions of the head and <b>pinnae</b> determine the spectral and temporal transformations of sound, as head and <b>pinnae</b> size increase during development, the magnitude and frequency ranges of these transformations are hypothesized to systematically change. This hypothesis was tested by measuring directional transfer functions (DTFs), the directional components of head-related transfer functions, and the linear dimensions of the head and <b>pinnae</b> in cats from the onset of hearing (∼ 1. 5 weeks) through adulthood. Head and <b>pinnae</b> dimensions increased by factors of ∼ 2 and ∼ 2. 5, respectively, reaching adult values by ∼ 23 and ∼ 16 weeks, respectively. The development of the spectral notch cues to source location, the spatial- and frequency-dependent distributions of DTF amplitude gain (acoustic directionality), maximum gain, and the acoustic axis, and the resonance frequency and associated gain of the ear canal and concha were systematically related to the dimensions of the head and <b>pinnae.</b> These monaural acoustical properties of the head and <b>pinnae</b> in the cat are mature by 16 weeks...|$|R
40|$|Pteris fauriei {{is widely}} {{distributed}} in Eastern Asia and has high morphological variation. Some morphologically similar plants {{related to this}} species are difficult to distinguish. We showed that the new Pteris species from Taiwan, previously identified as P. fauriei, can be morphologically distinguished by its wide <b>pinnae,</b> larger terminal <b>pinnae</b> than the lateral <b>pinnae</b> in sterile fronds, and triangular basal segments of the lateral <b>pinnae.</b> It was confirmed that this species is phylogenetically separated from the other East Asian Pteris species, except for a morphologically distinct species P. arisanensis, by means of chloroplast genes, rbcL and matK. The new species is named as Pteris latipinna sp. nov., referring to its wide <b>pinnae.</b> Here, we provide a key to facilitate {{the identification of the}} morphologically similar Pteris species in Asia. The morphological descriptions, images, ecology, and distribution are also presented...|$|R
5|$|A horse's {{hearing is}} good, and the <b>pinna</b> of each ear can rotate up to 180°, giving the {{potential}} for 360° hearing without having to move the head. Noise impacts the behavior of horses and certain kinds of noise may contribute to stress: A 2013 study in the UK indicated that stabled horses were calmest in a quiet setting, or if listening to country or classical music, but displayed signs of nervousness when listening to jazz or rock music. This study also recommended keeping music under a volume of 21 decibels. An Australian study found that stabled racehorses listening to talk radio had {{a higher rate of}} gastric ulcers than horses listening to music, and racehorses stabled where a radio was played had a higher overall rate of ulceration than horses stabled where there was no radio playing.|$|E
5|$|The fur is {{brownish}} (T.bolivaris) or reddish (T.talamancae) {{above and}} lighter below, appearing whitish, but {{the hairs on}} the underparts have gray bases. The snout is large. The mystacial (above the mouth) and superciliary vibrissae both extend to at least the back margin of the ears when laid back against the head, but are much longer in T.bolivaris. The <b>pinna</b> (external ear) is large. On the hindfeet, which are long and narrow, ungual tufts of hairs surround the bases of the toes. In T.bolivaris, the sole usually entirely lacks squamae (small, scale-like structures), but T.talamancae does have squamae on part of its sole. The claw of the first toe extends about {{to the middle of}} the first phalange of the second and that of the fifth toe extends nearly to the base of the second phalange of the fourth. The tail is at least about as long as the head and body, sometimes slightly longer. The tail is darker above than below in T.talamancae, but there may not be a difference in color in T.bolivaris. The tail appears naked, but is covered with fine hairs.|$|E

50|$|The golden leather fern has large fronds {{growing to}} {{a length of}} 1.8 metres (six feet). The leaves are glossy, broad and pinnate, the <b>pinnae</b> being dark green, leathery, {{alternate}} and widely spaced. The outer fronds arch over sideways but the central ones are nearly straight. Some of the larger fronds bear sporangia (reproductive organs) on the upper five to eight pairs of <b>pinnae.</b> These are brick red and give the <b>pinnae</b> a felted appearance.|$|R
50|$|This fern {{produces}} {{clumps of}} widely arching fronds. The stipe and rachis {{of the blade}} are purple, while the blade itself has a blue-gray tinge to it. The upper <b>pinnae</b> are long, narrow, and undivided, while the lower ones are divided into 3-15 pinnules. The <b>pinnae</b> are, for the most part, opposite. Fertile fronds are longer and more heavily divided. They produce sori, which lack a true indusium, within the inrolled margins of the <b>pinnae.</b>|$|R
