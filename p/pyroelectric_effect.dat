Pyroelectricity requires time-varying inputs and suffers from small power outputs in energy harvesting applications due to its low operating frequencies. However, one key advantage of pyroelectrics over thermoelectrics is that many pyroelectric materials are stable up to 1200 ⁰C or higher, enabling energy harvesting from high temperature sources and thus increasing thermodynamic efficiency.|$|E

This points to a high potential of GaN-based sensors for high temperature pyroelectronics. Piezoelectric effects strongly affect the performance of electronic and lightemitting devices based on III-N materials. Piezoelectrically induced charge in heterostructures can be as large as 3 to 4 x 10 13 cm- 2.

40|$|The thesis {{consists}} of two parts, both related to fundamental aspects of polymeric dielectrics. The first part is focused on fundamental high field phenomena in solid dielectrics related to degradation thereof.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Macroscopic {{constitutive}} relations {{based on}} the mean-field theory and the Mori–Tanaka method are derived for a 3 -phase composite consisting of a polymer matrix and shape memory alloy (SMA) and piezoceramic (PZT) inclusions. Effective moduli are computed for likewise oriented spherical and cylindrical inclusions. Results are also computed for cylindrical PZT and ellipsoidal SMA inclusions. Even though the PZT and the matrix materials {{are assumed to be}} linear, the overall response of the composite is nonlinear because of the phase transformations in the SMA inclusions. The 3 -phase composite exhibits <b>pyroelectric</b> <b>effects</b> even when none of its constituents is pyroelectric. It is found that the spherical inclusions are more effective than the cylindrical inclusions in the sense that lower values of the average axial stress induce phase transformations in the SMA inclusions, and the maximum principal tensile strain induced in the PZT inclusions is only about 7 % of the average axial strain. However, spherical PZT inclusions require a very high value of the electric field to induce any noticeable axial strain in the hybrid composite...|$|R

40|$|The {{origin of}} optical damage in {{potassium}} titanyl phosphate (KTP) crystals has been vigorously investigated since its introduction as a nonlinear optical material in 1976. It {{is well known}} that this material exhibits a laser damage threshold that limits its use in many high average-power applications, especially frequency doubling of Nd-doped lasers. Both photochromic and electrochromic damage can be induced in KTP. Until recently, it was thought that these two types of damage were distinctly different, possibly involving different mechanisms; however, new data show that electrochromic-like damage can be induced in KT? by laser irradiation only, implying the existence of an internal electric field. We have recently observed bursts of light (optical scintillations) when heating KTP crystals at 0. 1 - 1. 0 K/s in the temperature range 8 - 675 K. The scintillations correspond to molecular nitrogen emission occurring during the electrical breakdown of air near the crystal surface, and imply the existence of pyroelectric fields in KTP exceeding 30 kV/cm.
