5000|$|In the United States, detinue is a <b>possessory</b> <b>action</b> having for its object the {{recovery}} of specific personal property and damages for its detention. At common law an action of detinue would lie for {{the recovery}} of specific personal property unlawfully detained, or its value, and for damages for its detention. Detinue differs from replevin in that possession of the chattel in controversy is not changed until after the judgment in detinue, whereas in replevin possession is changed {{at the beginning of}} the proceeding. The gist of an action in detinue is that the defendant is wrongfully in possession of personal property which belongs to the plaintiff [...] whereas replevin lies only where there has been a wrongful taking or seizure of the property. Detinue is distinguished from common-law trover which is for {{the recovery of}} damages for the wrongful conversion of personal property. In modern practice, detinue has been superseded almost entirely by statutory actions for the recovery of personal property.|$|E
5000|$|The Supreme Court reversed. Justice White noted [...] "Accepting {{the premise}} of the Court of Appeals that the case was {{essentially}} a <b>possessory</b> <b>action,</b> we are of the view that the complaint asserted a current right to possession conferred by federal law, wholly independent of state law." [...] The Court distinguished Taylor v. Anderson on these groundsHere, the right to possession itself is claimed to arise under federal law in the first instance. Allegedly, aboriginal title of an Indian tribe guaranteed by treaty and protected by statute has never been extinguished. In Taylor, the plaintiffs were individual Indians, not an Indian tribe; and the suit concerned lands allocated to individual Indians, not tribal rights to lands.... In the present case, however, the assertion of a federal controversy does not rest solely on the claim of a right to possession derived from a federal grant of title whose scope will be governed by state law. Rather, it rests on the not insubstantial claim that federal law now protects, and has continuously protected {{from the time of the}} formation of the United States, possessory rights to tribal lands, wholly apart from the application of state law principles which normally and separately protect a valid right of possession.|$|E
