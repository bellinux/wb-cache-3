50|$|The game {{is divided}} into five social stages: Pioneer, Settler, Citizen, Merchant, and Aristocrat. At {{the start of the}} game, all of a player's {{citizens}} are pioneers. They pay little amounts of taxes, and require only food and a town center. As a player's empire develops, so does his population. They begin upgrading (provided they have sufficient goods), paying more taxes, but also requiring more goods, such as tobacco products, <b>perfume,</b> <b>lamp</b> oil, and much more. It is crucial for a player to develop quickly, as not much profit is attained until reaching the merchant stage.|$|E

60|$|So {{the king}} and his {{minister}} disguised themselves as foreign merchants, and went that evening to the palace where the young man lived. A servant dressed in clothes of gold and silver cloth stood at the door, and called to them {{to come in and}} be made welcome. He led them in, and to a chamber lit with <b>perfumed</b> <b>lamps</b> of gold. Then six black slaves took them in charge and led them to a bath of white marble. They were bathed in perfumed water and dried with towels of fine linen. When they came forth they were clad in clothes of cloth of silver, stiff with gold and jewels. Then twelve handsome white slaves led them through a vast and splendid hall to a banqueting-room.|$|R
60|$|On {{the night}} upon which such strange chances had befallen his messengers, the king {{sat alone in}} his cabinet. Over his head a <b>perfumed</b> <b>lamp,</b> held up by four little flying Cupids of crystal, who dangled by golden chains from the painted ceiling, cast a {{brilliant}} light upon the chamber, which was flashed back twenty-fold by the mirrors upon the wall. The ebony and silver furniture, the dainty carpet of La Savonniere, the silks of Tours, the tapestries of the Gobelins, the gold-work and the delicate chinaware of Sevres--the best of all that France could produce was centred between these four walls. Nothing had ever passed through that door which was not a masterpiece of its kind. And amid all this brilliance the master of it sat, his chin resting upon his hands, his elbows upon the table, with eyes which stared vacantly at the wall, a moody and a solemn man.|$|R
60|$|When Georgiana {{recovered}} consciousness {{she found}} herself breathing an atmosphere of penetrating fragrance, the gentle potency of which had recalled her from her death-like faintness. The scene around her looked like enchantment. Aylmer had converted those smoky, dingy, sombre rooms, where he had spent his brightest years in recondite pursuits, {{into a series of}} beautiful apartments not unfit to be the secluded abode of a lovely woman. The walls were hung with gorgeous curtains, which imparted the combination of grandeur and grace that no other species of adornment can achieve; and, as they fell from the ceiling to the floor, their rich and ponderous folds, concealing all angles and straight lines, appeared to shut in the scene from infinite space. For aught Georgiana knew, it might be a pavilion among the clouds. And Aylmer, excluding the sunshine, which would have interfered with his chemical processes, had supplied its place with <b>perfumed</b> <b>lamps,</b> emitting flames of various hue, but all uniting in a soft, impurpled radiance. He now knelt by his wife's side, watching her earnestly, but without alarm; for he was confident in his science, and felt that he could draw a magic circle round her within which no evil might intrude.|$|R
60|$|The senator gave {{a cry of}} {{apprehension}} and rushed {{to the corner of}} the atrium, where a little shrine, curtained off by silken drapery, held the precious statue, the greatest art treasure of his collection--perhaps of the whole world. He tore the hangings aside and stood in speechless anger before the outraged goddess. The red <b>perfumed</b> <b>lamp</b> which always burned before her had been spilled and broken; her altar fire had been quenched, her chaplet had been dashed aside. But worst of all--insufferable sacrilege!--her own beautiful nude body of glistening Pantelic marble, as white and fair as when the inspired Greek had hewed it out five hundred years before, had been most brutally mishandled. Three fingers of the gracious outstretched hand had been struck off, and lay upon the pedestal beside her. Above her delicate breast a dark mark showed, where a blow had disfigured the marble. Emilius Flaccus, the most delicate and judicious connoisseur in Rome, stood gasping and croaking, his hand to his throat, as he gazed at his disfigured masterpiece. Then he turned upon his slaves, his fury in his convulsed face; but, to his amazement, they were not looking at him, but had all turned in attitudes of deep respect towards the opening of the peristyle. As he faced round and saw who had just entered his house, his own rage fell away from him in an instant, and his manner became as humble as that of his servants.|$|R
40|$|This study {{involves}} {{understanding of}} how garland is being remembered {{as an object of}} devotion in various traditions from classical times to contemporary age? Main focus of present study is to get insight into the symbolism of garland as cultic object in Buddhist art of Gandhara. And to indicate that how this element get merged into different sorts of learning? In order to act in accordance with these objectives, usage of garland has been studied in antique (Greece and Rome) art and culture. Suggestions are gathered from literary evidence and symbolic portrayals to identify that what was the significance of garland to Greek and Roman civilization? And how this icon get assorted into later religious settings of Asia minor and eastern countries including Gandhara Buddhism? Purpose of the present study is to recognize that how this element was acknowledged and modified in Buddhist rites and observances? Buddhists in Gandhara followed the pre-Buddhist belief of communicating religious dogma through sacred symbols. They derived those signs from ancient Iranian, Greek, Roman and Hindu customs of adoring gods, goddesses and heroic figures with flowers, <b>perfumes,</b> <b>lamps,</b> banners or floral garlands. It is concluded that imagery of garland motif was first introduced in Gandhara by the Bactrian Greeks who invaded the region in 4 rd century BCE. Although the idea was already present in Vedic practices of worshipping divine beings in Gandhara. The acceptance of outlandish religious values and artistic features by local people since Gandhara remained exposed to foreign invasions from prehistoric times. Despite all these invasions, people of Gandhara retained their originality in their art and culture...|$|R
60|$|Obeying the command, De Catinat {{found himself}} in a room which was no larger and but little better {{furnished}} than that which was allotted to his own use. Yet, though simple, everything in the chamber was scrupulously neat and clean, betraying the dainty taste of a refined woman. The stamped-leather furniture, the La Savonniere carpet, the pictures of sacred subjects, exquisite from an artist's point of view, the plain but tasteful curtains, all left an impression half religious and half feminine but wholly soothing. Indeed, the soft light, the high white statue of the Virgin in a canopied niche, with a <b>perfumed</b> red <b>lamp</b> burning before it, and the wooden prie-dieu with the red-edged prayer-book upon the top of it, made the apartment look more like a private chapel than a fair lady's boudoir.|$|R
50|$|Game was {{recorded}} and mixed by Nakata in Shibuya, Tokyo. Four different formats were released {{to promote the}} album; a standalone CD, a limited CD and DVD bundle, and a digital release. It was re-released in February 2016 as a 12-inch LP, featured in both Perfume's 2016 box set Perfume Complete LP Box and a limited singular release. Two different artworks were issued for the album's cover sleeve; one has Perfume inside a small room with synthetic grass, while the second has <b>Perfume</b> holding LED <b>lamps</b> in a dark room.|$|R
6000|$|Don Rodrigo {{sipped his}} wine, and his dark, hungry eyes {{followed}} {{her as she}} moved about him with vaguely voluptuous, almost feline grace. The wine, the heavy <b>perfume</b> of the <b>lamp,</b> {{and the beauty of}} her played havoc among them with his senses, so that he forgot for the moment his Castilian lineage and clean Christian blood, forgot that she derived from the accursed race of the Crucifiers. All that he remembered was that she was the loveliest woman in Seville, daughter to the wealthiest man, and in that hour of weakness he decided to convert into reality that which had hitherto been no more than an infamous presence. He would loyally fulfil the false, disloyal promises he had made. He would take her to wife. It was a sacrifice which her beauty and her wealth should make worth while. Upon that impulse he spoke now, abruptly: ...|$|R
50|$|Chinese {{economic}} {{dominance of}} Cambodia dates back the pre-French colonial kingdoms where Chinese merchants often maintained patron-client {{relationships with the}} Khmer monarchy. William Willmot, a Sinologist at the University of British Columbia estimated that 90 percent of the Chinese in Cambodia were involved in commerce in 1963. Today, an estimated 60 percent are urban dwellers engage in commerce {{while the rest of}} the rural population work as shopkeepers, processors of food products (such as rice, palm sugar, fruit, and fish), and moneylenders. Throughout Cambodian cities, Chinese dominated numerous industries such as retail, hospitality, export-import trade, light, food processing, soft drinks, printing and machine shops. In addition, virtually all of Cambodia's richest people are of Chinese descent. Rural Chinese businessmen operated general shops that provided ethnic Khmer peasants with essential purchases such as farming supplies, groceries imported from China, sanpots and sarongs, bamboo baskets, <b>perfume,</b> kerosene for <b>lamps,</b> alcohol as well as tobacco. Those in the Kampot Province and parts of Kaoh Kong Province cultivate black pepper and fruit (especially rambutans, durians, and coconuts). Additionally, rural Chinese Cambodians also engaged in salt water fishing. In the 19th century, French colonials allowed Chinese-run businesses to flourish due to their laissez faire capitalist policies. Willmott estimated that the ethnic Chinese controlled 92 percent of the Cambodian economy by the mid-20th century. They traded in urban areas and worked as shopkeepers, moneylenders and traditional healers in rural areas, while Chinese farmers controlled Cambodia’s lucrative Kampot pepper industry. Chinese Cambodian moneylenders wield considerable economic power over the poorer indigenous ethnic Khmer peasants through usury at an interest rate of 10 to 20 percent per month. This might have been the reason why seventy-five percent of the peasants in Cambodia were in debt in 1952, according to the Australian Colonial Credit Office. Chinese Cambodian entrepreneurs are also estimated to control 70 percent of the industrial investment and are actively engaged in trading, real estate development, construction, small-scale manufacturing, alcohol distilling, hospitality, fast food restaurants, and food processing. Ethnic Chinese also dominate the silk weaving industry where key commercial positions in the Cambodian silk trading networks are completely held in Chinese hands.|$|R
