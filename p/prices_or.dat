5|$|Accounts vary, but historians {{estimate}} that by spring 1903, between 700 and 1,000 men {{arrived in the}} Tanana Valley. This put an enormous strain on Barnette's stock of food, which rapidly rose in price with demand. Miners objected to Barnette charging $12 per bag of flour and requiring them to buy cases of canned food. They gathered outside his store and demanded he lower his <b>prices</b> <b>or</b> they would burn it down. He responded that he had riflemen inside the building, and both groups reached a compromise. Shortly afterward, Barnette headed south with his wife on a dog team, intending to gather investors to purchase more supplies.|$|E
5|$|Finnair {{terminated}} {{their services}} to Kirkenes in 1975. At {{the same time}} the ministry and SAS started looking at the airport structure in Finnmark, as all the services in the county were in need of subsidies. The proposals were either for a hike in the ticket <b>prices</b> <b>or</b> a reduction of Kirkenes to a regional-only airport. SAS was flying a 90-seat aircraft two to three times per day between Kirkenes and Alta with only ten to fifteen passengers. The airport structure was kept, but ticket prices continued to rise. The airport served 110,000 passengers in 1983. Norving continued Varangfly's air ambulance contract until 1987, when the service was taken over by Air Express. Later the contract was awarded to Lufttransport, who operated the Beechcraft Super King Air. Norving filed for bankruptcy in 1992 and their routes were taken over by Widerøe.|$|E

25|$|The modern TSSI {{approach}} has been criticized by other Marxist and neo-Ricardian scholars including Gerard Duménil, Duncan K. Foley, Michel Husson, David Laibman, Dominique Lévy, Simon Mohun, Gary Mongiovi, Ernesto Screpanti, Ajit Sinha, and Roberto Veneziani. The main idea of these critics is, that if equilibrium is let go of, then capitalism is an unpredictable chaos, and no coherent theory of <b>prices</b> <b>or</b> profits is possible anymore.|$|E
50|$|Price {{sometimes}} {{refers to}} the quantity of payment requested by a seller of goods or services, rather than the eventual payment amount. This requested amount is often called the asking <b>price</b> <b>or</b> selling <b>price,</b> while the actual payment may be called the transaction <b>price</b> <b>or</b> traded <b>price.</b> Likewise, the bid <b>price</b> <b>or</b> buying <b>price</b> is the quantity of payment offered by a buyer of goods or services, although this meaning {{is more common in}} asset or financial markets than in consumer markets.|$|R

Martin issued an order to approve the merger, according to The Wall Street Journal – setting the stage for a final vote which could have occurred any time after his recommendation was circulated.|$|E
25|$|Under {{guidance}} planning, enterprises try to {{meet the}} state's planned goals but make their own arrangements for production and sales based on {{the orientation of the}} state's plans, the availability of raw and unfinished materials and energy supplies, and the demands on the market. Prices of products under guidance planning either are unified <b>prices</b> <b>or</b> floating prices set by the state or prices negotiated between buyers and suppliers. Production and distribution of products not included in the state's plans are regulated by market conditions.|$|E
25|$|Nicholson continued, that in {{practice}} it is customary to allow certain deductions from the established selling <b>prices,</b> <b>or</b> from the established purchasing prices. These deductions can include trade discounts, allowances, rebates and/or cash discount. As {{to the analysis}} of total of cost elements, every cost element {{can be traced back to}} certain kind of expenses, see diagram II. This kind of diagram was also more common in those days; see for example Dana & Gillette (1909), Kimball (1914), Kimball (1917); and Eggleston & Robinson (1921).|$|E

The EPP applies only to the quantity that is exported and not to the quantity that is sold domestically.|$|R
25|$|For years, {{business}} in Africa was hampered by poor transportation between countries and regions. Chinese-African associations have worked towards ending this unproductive situation. China provides infrastructure funding and workforce {{in exchange for}} immediate preferential relations including lower resource <b>prices</b> <b>or</b> shares of African resources. As a secondary effect, this infrastructure allows Africa to increase its production and exports, {{improve the quality of}} life and increase the condition of millions of Africans, who will one day become as many millions of potential buyers of Chinese goods.|$|E
25|$|To {{maintain}} the current two-runway system, {{there will be}} enhancements to the terminal and apron facilities to increase the airport's capacity. This option will enable the airport to handle a maximum of 420,000 flight movements per year, with annual passenger and cargo throughput increased to 74 million and six million tonnes respectively. The approximate cost of this plan is $23.4 billion Hong Kong dollars in 2010 <b>prices,</b> <b>or</b> HK$42.5 billion in money-of-the-day prices. However, the Airport Authority estimates that the airport will reach its maximum runway capacity sometime around 2020 if no extra runway is added.|$|E
25|$|A {{trend line}} {{represents}} a trend, the long-term movement in time series data after other components have been accounted for. It tells {{whether a particular}} data set (say GDP, oil <b>prices</b> <b>or</b> stock prices) have increased or decreased over the period of time. A trend line could simply be drawn by eye {{through a set of}} data points, but more properly their position and slope is calculated using statistical techniques like linear regression. Trend lines typically are straight lines, although some variations use higher degree polynomials depending on the degree of curvature desired in the line.|$|E
40|$|Forecasts of {{passenger}} demand are {{an important}} parameter for aviation planners. Air transport demand models typically assume a perfectly reversible impact of the demand drivers. However, {{there are reasons to}} believe that the impacts of some of the demand drivers such as fuel <b>price</b> <b>or</b> income on air transport demand may not be perfectly reversible. Two types of imperfect reversibility, namely asymmetry and hysteresis, are possible. Asymmetry refers to the differences in the demand impacts of a rising <b>price</b> <b>or</b> income from that of a falling <b>price</b> <b>or</b> income. Hysteresis refers to the dependence of the impacts of changing <b>price</b> <b>or</b> income on previous history, especially on previous maximum <b>price</b> <b>or</b> income. We use US time series data and decompose each of fuel price and income into three component series to develop an econometric model for air transport demand that is capable of capturing the potential imperfectly reversible relationships and test for {{the presence or absence of}} reversibility. We find statistical evidence of asymmetry and hysteresis - for both, prices and income - in air transport demand. Implications for policy and practice are then discussed...|$|R

On 4 October Inflammatory new newspapers appeared, including the Ami de Peuple of Marat and the Chronique de Paris, blaming the aristocracy for plotting to starve Paris. On 5 October 1789, a large crowd of Parisians marched to Versailles and, the following day, brought the royal family and government back to Paris, as virtual prisoners. The new government of France, the National Assembly, began {{to meet in the}} Salle du Manège of the Tuileries Palace.|$|E
25|$|The policy's price {{controls}} and market interventions led to considerable overproduction. These were intervention stores of products bought {{up by the}} Community to maintain minimum price levels. To dispose of surplus stores, they were often sold {{on the world market}} at prices considerably below Community guaranteed <b>prices,</b> <b>or</b> farmers were offered subsidies (amounting to the difference between the Community and world prices) to export their products outside the Community. This system has been criticised for under-cutting farmers outside Europe, especially those in the developing world. Supporters of CAP argue that the economic support which it gives to farmers provides them with a reasonable standard of living.|$|E
25|$|As {{the events}} of the wars of Yugoslav {{succession}} (1991–95 and 1999) unfolded, Zastava (GB) LTD became a barely noticed casualty. During Easter 1999, the Zastava factory in Kragujevac was targeted by NATO forces during the Kosovo campaign, and whilst severely damaged, was not put out of action. Supplies of vehicles to the United Kingdom were, however, reduced to a trickle in 1991-92 and with the imposition of United Nations sanctions on Slobodan Milosević’s rump Yugoslavia (consisting of Serbia and Montenegro), the company folded in 1993. The remaining Yugos on dealer forecourts were sold at drastically reduced <b>prices</b> <b>or</b> written off altogether as economically unviable.|$|E

25|$|A retail {{electricity}} market exists when end-use {{customers can}} choose their supplier from competing electricity retailers; one term {{used in the}} United States {{for this type of}} consumer choice is 'energy choice'. A separate issue for electricity markets is whether or not consumers face real-time pricing (prices based on the variable wholesale price) or a price that is set in some other way, such as average annual costs. In many markets, consumers do not pay based on the real-time price, and hence have no incentive to reduce demand at times of high (wholesale) <b>prices</b> <b>or</b> to shift their demand to other periods. Demand response may use pricing mechanisms or technical solutions to reduce peak demand.|$|E
25|$|The {{settlers}} {{came from}} Spain {{had to settle}} in towns, where the local government belonged to the Cabildo. The Cabildo was composed by a variable number of aldermen (regidores), around a dozen, {{depending on the size}} of the town, also two municipal judges (alcaldes menores), who were judges of first instance, and also other officials as police chief, inspector of supplies, court clerk, and a public herald. They were in charge of distributing land to the neighbors, establishing local taxes, dealing with the public order, inspecting jails and hospitals, preserving the roads and public works such as irrigation ditchs and bridges, supervising the public health, regulating the festive activities, monitoring market <b>prices,</b> <b>or</b> the protection of Indians.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} 1967, Copp and Hayes gently {{explained}} to Chapman that {{he would no longer}} have monopoly use of the DFV and in August 1967 it was announced that the power unit would be available for sale, via Cosworth Engineering, to racing teams throughout the world. Hayes released the DFV initially to French team Matra, headed by Ken Tyrrell with Jackie Stewart as a driver. What followed was a golden age, where teams big or small could buy an engine which was competitive, light, compact, easy to work with and relatively cheap (£7,500 at 1967 <b>prices</b> <b>or</b> about £90,000 in 2005 money). The DFV effectively replaced the Coventry Climax as the standard F1 powerplant for the private (mostly British) teams.|$|E
