5|$|The E Series 3 was {{announced}} in September 2010. It carried the same motor and drivetrain as before, and only {{minor changes to the}} exterior. In this series HSV focused on changes to the interior of the car as well as major upgrades to the computer systems and a new electronic interface called the HSV Enhanced Driver Interface. External changes included the shock wave exhaust tips and grilles and new HID Xenon adaptive projector headlamps. The control panel changes included a new 'Oracle Dash' with upgraded trip computer, tire pressure monitors and fuel statistics; the center console was reworked, introducing the Holden touchscreen IQ system and the HSV EDI performance data logging system (similar to the Nissan GT-R), which displays real-time information on engine speed, brakes, gear shifts, g-forces on the car, steering angle, fuel economy, stability control, Magnetic Ride Control suspension, car dynamics, Bi-Modal Exhaust, battery voltage, oil pressure, power, torque, elevation, exhaust pressure, intake manifold pressure and air intake temp. The system includes <b>preloaded</b> race track locations, stop watches and track maps, satellite navigation, digital radio, Bluetooth, optional DVD player and ability to download data onto a PC using the Motech i2 software. The E Series 3 introduced (SBZA) Side Blind Zone Alert which uses ultrasonic sensors to alert drivers of traffic obstructions in blind spots. Using the HSV EDI the driver can customize operation of the car by for example turning off stability control and controlling the Bi-Modal Exhaust. The E Series 3 offered the option of HSV LPI (Liquid Propane Injection), an LPG Autogas system which allows the use of liquid propane as an alternative fuel. The LPI is controlled by the car's ECU and seamlessly changes from petrol to LPG when the engine has reached optimum temperature (when maximum engine power is required, the system automatically switches back to petrol).|$|E

40|$|Purpose of review: To {{summarize}} the relevant peer-reviewed publications {{over the past}} year that addressed issues of when to give (or not give) fluid to the critically ill patient. Recent findings: Clinical data from several studies underscore the inability of measures of ventricular filling to assess either <b>preload</b> or <b>preload</b> responsiveness. Whereas less invasive monitoring techniques than pulmonary arterial catheterization demonstrate better discriminations with estimates of both <b>preload</b> and <b>preload</b> responsiveness. Measuring dynamic changes in stroke volume, descending aortic flow, and both superior and inferior vena caval diameters during ventilation provides good predictive value in defining <b>preload</b> responsiveness. One study demonstrated that resuscitation protocols keyed to esophageal flow measures improved outcome in postoperative cardiac surgery patients. Summary: <b>Preload</b> is not <b>preload</b> responsiveness. Functional measures of <b>preload</b> responsiveness exist and are superior to traditional measures of filling pressures in driving resuscitation in critically ill patients. © 2005 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins...|$|R

40|$|Whether {{protein is}} the {{macronutrient}} with the strongest satiety effect remains {{a matter of}} debate because of the diversity of study designs employed. The aim {{of the present study was}} to compare the effect of different liquid <b>preloads</b> made up of proteins, fats or carbohydrates only, under stringently controlled conditions, on satiety. Fifty-six subjects participated in the present study which consisted of four randomised test days, i. e. 1 d per macronutrient and one control day. During each test day, the subjects were required to consume the <b>preload</b> in full, and then their subsequent food intake was measured. The volunteers were divided into two groups: the first (T 0) group, which consumed the <b>preload</b> immediately before lunch, and the second (T 1) group, which consumed it 1 h beforehand. The main results showed that the participants consumed significantly less at lunch following the consumption of all three <b>preloads</b> than on the no-preload day, and consumed less after the consumption of the carbohydrate <b>preload</b> than after the consumption of the lipid <b>preload.</b> When energy from the <b>preload</b> was included, overall energy intake was significantly greater in all the three <b>preload</b> conditions than in the situation involving no <b>preload,</b> with only partial compensation for <b>preload</b> energy in all conditions. Total daily energy intake was highest after the lipid <b>preload</b> ingestion, but this could be a chance finding since it was not significantly higher than that observed after protein or carbohydrate <b>preload</b> ingestion. No significant effects of the interval between the <b>preload</b> and test meal ingestion were found. These results do not confirm the greater satiety effect of proteins than of carbohydrates, but partially confirm the weaker effect of fats...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} the {{variation of the}} dynamic characteristics of a spindle with the change of bearing <b>preload.</b> The correlations between the variation of bearing <b>preload</b> and fundamental modal parameters were first examined by conducting vibration tests on physical spindle units. Experimental measurements show that the dynamic compliance and damping ratio associated with the dominating modes were affected to vary with variation of the bearing <b>preload.</b> When the bearing <b>preload</b> was slightly deviated from a standard value, the modal frequency and damping ability also vary to different extent, which further enable the spindle to perform with different compliance. For the spindle used in this study, a standard <b>preload</b> value set on bearings would enable the spindle to behave a higher stiffness as compared with others with a <b>preload</b> variation. This characteristic can be served as a reference to examine the variation of bearing <b>preload</b> of spindle in assemblage or operation.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a study of}} the dependency of loosening parameters on secondary locking features of threaded inserts subjected to dynamic shear loads. Secondary locking is used to assist and/or provide redundancy to the primary locking feature (threads) in preventing <b>preload</b> loss in almost any mechanical applications. Two different secondary locking features are studied: the Locking Heli-Coil insert and the Loctite Threadlocker (R) applied before assembly to a Standard Heli-Coil insert. Five parameters are studied in this thesis: percentage loss of initial <b>preload,</b> initial rate of <b>preload</b> loss, secondary rate of <b>preload</b> loss, steady-state value, and the final <b>preload</b> value.
