40|$|Direct acting methemoglobin forming compounds, such as {{the well}} known sodium nitrite, {{can be added to}} whole blood leading to in vitro {{formation}} of methemoglobin. In the canine model the rate of formation of methemoglobin in vitro is similar to the rate of methemoglobin formation obtained during rapid intravenous infusion. The in vitro addition of direct acting <b>p-aminopropiophenone</b> derivatives to blood obtained from unanesthetized dogs forms methemoglobin at rates similar to the intravenous infusion of the same compounds in the same dogs. These studies demonstrate that in vitro addition of compounds to whole blood can be used to rapidly obtain an estimate of the rate of forzm 3 tion of methemoglobin and the approximate whole blood concentration of an unknown compound required to induce desired levels of methemoglobin. Since this in vitro system only responds to direct formers of methem~oglobin it is possibl...|$|E
40|$|Methemoglobinemia induced in {{mice and}} other animals protects against death from inhaled {{hydrogen}} sulfide or injected sodium sulfide. Equivalent circulating levels of methemoglobin impart equivalent degrees of protection irrespective of the agent used to induce the methemoglobinemia (nitrite, <b>p-aminopropiophenone,</b> or hydroxylamine). In each case 2 - 4 moles of sulfide are apparently inactivated in vivo for each available ferric heme group. The ferric iron of methemoglobin is one site available for hydrosulfide anion binding. No information is available about tile nature of the additional sulfide binding sites, but they are inferred {{to be associated with}} the globin moiety. Protection against sulfide poisoning is not demonstrable in mice after methemoglobin levels have been reduced to normal concentrations by spontaneous methemoglobin reduc-tase activity. However, if methemoglohin reductase activity is increased by methylene blue, a ferrous hemoglobin which retains significant sulfide-inactivating properties exists transiently in vivo. This protective effect is also lost after a time interval equivalent to that required for spontaneous activity to reduce methemoglobin levels to normal in the absence of methylene blue. In mouse eryt#{ 149 }hrocytes exposed to sodium nitrite the non...|$|E
40|$|Hydrogen cyanide was {{administered}} intravenously at doses of 0. 67 or 1. 34 mg kg- 1 to beagle pitches after protection with oral <b>p-aminopropiophenone</b> (0. 5 mg kg- 1). Hydrogen cyanide was also administered to unprotected bitches {{at the lower}} level (0. 67 mg kg- 1) only. PAPP protection caused sequestration of cyanide inside the red cells. In {{the case of the}} lower dose of cyanide this resulted in a lower plasma cyanide in protected than unprotected bitches. In the case of the higher dose it resulted in survival, despite 1. 34 mg kg- 1 being a known lethal dose. It is concluded that prior administration of PAPP ameliorated the effects of cyanide poisoning. [ntroduction Although cyanides are widely regarded as very toxic ~ubstances they are subject to a highly effective ietoxification system in the body. The overall de-:oxification rate has been estimated by McNamaral 1 :o be about 0. 017 mg kg- 1 min- 1 in the human. There ire a number of pathways of detoxification, the most mportant being the rhodanese reaction in which-yanide reacts with a variety of sulphur donors to â€™orm thiocyanate, an ion which is much less toxic. 2. 3 Jther important metabolic routes for the detoxifica-:ion of cyanide include (3 -mercaptopyruvate sulphur-:ransferase-catalysed fonnation of thiocyanate~, oxida-:ive metabolism and reaction with hydroxocobalamin 4...|$|E
