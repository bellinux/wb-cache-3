40|$|AbstractIn modern gas turbines, {{rim seal}} located between the stator-disc and rotor-disc {{is used to}} prevent hot-gas {{ingestion}} into the inner stage-gap of high pressure turbine. However, the <b>purge</b> <b>flow</b> supplied to the cavity through the rim seal interacts with the main flow, producing additional aerodynamic loss due to the mixing process which {{plays a significant role}} in the formation, development and evolution of downstream secondary flow. In this paper, a set of cascade representative of low aspect ratio turbine is selected to numerically investigate the influence of upstream cavity <b>purge</b> <b>flow</b> on the hub secondary flow structure and aerodynamic loss. Cascade with/without upstream cavity and four different purge mass flow rates are all taken into account in this simulation. Then, a deep insight into the loss mechanism of interaction between <b>purge</b> <b>flow</b> and main flow is gained. The results show that the presence of cavity and <b>purge</b> <b>flow</b> has a significant impact on the main flow which not only changes the vortex structure in both the passage and upstream cavity, but also alters the cascade exit flow angle distribution along the spanwise. Moreover, aerodynamic loss in the cascade rises with the increase of <b>purge</b> <b>flow</b> rate while the sealing effect is also enhanced. Therefore, the effect of upstream cavity <b>purge</b> <b>flow</b> must be considered in the process of turbine aerodynamic design. What is more, it is necessary to minimize the <b>purge</b> <b>flow</b> rate in order to reduce aerodynamic loss on the premise of satisfying cooling requirements...|$|E
40|$|Secondary air, {{often called}} purge air, is {{injected}} through the endwall gap between stationary vanes and rotating rotors in axial turbines to prevent ingestion {{of the hot}} working gas into the endwall cavities. Three-dimensional flow computations, unsteady as well as steady, {{have been carried out}} to assess the role of vane-rotor stage induced flow unsteadiness on loss generation from <b>purge</b> <b>flow</b> interacting with main flow. Computational models of varying physical and geometry complexity that range from simple bladeless annulus configurations to vane-rotor stage configurations were used for identifying the specific flow features responsible for loss generation; these were also complemented by control volume analyses of simple two streams flow model. Computed results showed that the vane induced circumferentially non-uniform static pressure field, and to a much lesser extent rotor blade induced bow waves, significantly increases loss generation upon introduction of injected flow with and without swirl; any flow approximations that renders the pressure field imposed on the <b>purge</b> <b>flow</b> as circumferentially uniform would underestimate the loss due to purge flow-main flow interaction. Flow unsteadiness induced by vane-rotor interaction has marginal, if any, impact on loss generation from introducing <b>purge</b> <b>flow</b> into the main flow path. Judicious flow path modification such as endwall contouring that reduces or eliminates vane-induced static pressure circumferential non-uniformity imposed upon the <b>purge</b> <b>flow</b> has been shown to significantly reduce the <b>purge</b> <b>flow</b> driven loss. Computed results also show that loss generation increases linearly with injected mass flow rate (7. 5 % more loss per 1 % <b>purge</b> <b>flow)</b> and decreases quadratically with <b>purge</b> <b>flow</b> swirl until it matches the main flow circumferential velocity (85 % reduction in <b>purge</b> <b>flow</b> induced based loss at that point). <b>Purge</b> <b>flow</b> induced loss has a weak dependence on the width of the purge duct and angle of injection. by David Clifton.

The pressure to be maintained and the required <b>purging</b> <b>flow</b> are examined in terms of the effectiveness in preventing gaseous and particulate contaminants ingestion and the abatement of the self-generated contaminants. Considerations have been given to the venting requirements for the structural integrity of the instrument during launch, the limitations on the volume and the pressure of the purging gas to be carried along in orbit, and the required venting area is established based on the internal volume of the instrument, the allowable pressure differential, and the rate of external pressure change during launch.

40|$|We have {{developed}} an on-line sensing method {{for the detection of}} volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in contaminated aqueous solutions by combining a microporous hollow fiber membrane with an infrared (IR) sensing system. Polypropylene microporous hollow fibers were used to separate the VOCs from the aqueous solution into the hollow fibers, which were purged countercurrently for detection by the IR sensing systems. An evanescent-wave-type IR sensing system was used to detect the VOCs that were purged from the hollow fibers. The sensing element was coated with polyisobutylene (PIB) to concentrate the VOCs for their detection. To study the performance of this system, we examined a number of factors, such as the <b>purging</b> <b>flow</b> rate, the sample flow rate, and the volatilities of the VOCs. The results indicate that an increase in the <b>purging</b> <b>flow</b> rate reduces the analytical signal significantly, especially for <b>purging</b> <b>flow</b> rates > 2 mL/min. The pumping flow rate for the aqueous sample also influenced the analytical signals, but far less sensitively. The volatilities of the examined compounds also affected the analytical signals: the higher the volatility of the compound, the lower the intensity of the analytical signals and the shorter the time required to reach the equilibrium signal. From an examination of the dynamic range of this proposed method, a regression coefficient > 0. 994 was obtained for concentrations below 250 mg/L, even under non-equilibrium conditions. The response time of the system was studied in an effort to examine the suitability of using this sensing method for automatic detection. The results indicate that new equilibrium conditions were established within 3 min for highly volatile compounds, which suggests that on-line monitoring of the levels of VOCs can be performed in the field...|$|R
40|$|In modern gas {{turbines}} or jet engines, the ingestion of hot gas through the hub-side gap between rotor and stator blades {{has to be}} prevented successfully in order to shield the turbine discs from high temperatures. For this purpose, compressor air is fed into the rotor-stator wheelspace. There it purges and hence seals the unavoidable gap between the rotor and the stator row which {{is referred to as}} the rim seal. In general, this so-called <b>purge</b> <b>flow</b> has detrimental effects. On the one hand, it does not fully contribute to the thermodynamic cycle of the engine. On the other hand, it spoils the main flow aerodynamics when it re-enters into the turbine. To reduce these detrimental effects and minimise the necessary amount of <b>purge</b> <b>flow,</b> a detailed understanding of the interaction between purge and main annulus flow is necessary. For this purpose, this topic has been investigated by several projects. Whereas in most of these projects the interaction between purge and main annulus flow has been investigated upstream of a rotor row in a high pressure turbine, in this thesis the <b>purge</b> <b>flow</b> injection upstream of the stator row of a low pressure turbine is examined. This aims to broaden the general understanding of the interaction between purge and main annulus flow. Furthermore, a comparison of the effects upstream of a rotor row and upstream of a stator row is carried out. For this investigation numerous experiments have been conducted during the EU Project MAGPI using the Large Scale Turbine Rig (LSTR) at Technische Universität Darmstadt. This test rig is equipped with different measurement techniques, including pressure taps, 5 -hole probes, PIV and a tracer gas system. In their combination these measurement techniques offer the possibility to study the <b>purge</b> <b>flow</b> induced effects in great detail. The measurements reveal a significant influence of <b>purge</b> <b>flow</b> on the flow field within the main annulus and the rim seal. With increasing <b>purge</b> <b>flow,</b> a negative incidence develops at the stator row. This increases the crossflow within the passage and amplifies secondary flows. In addition to this amplification of secondary flows, which is generally similar to results observed for <b>purge</b> <b>flow</b> injection upstream of a rotor row, a significant influence of the <b>purge</b> <b>flow</b> delivery is observed. Especially in low pressure turbines, the <b>purge</b> <b>flow</b> is often supplied through discrete holes in the rotor drum. At sufficiently high pressure ratios, the <b>purge</b> <b>flow</b> may leave these holes in the form of discrete jets. These so-called drive arm hole jets are examined to influence the flow field in the rim seal significantly in the current configuration. That is, they form a <b>purge</b> <b>flow</b> filled vortex in the rim seal, which suppresses the typical flow structure. In addition, these jets promote hot gas ingestion. Overall, the method of the <b>purge</b> <b>flow</b> delivery is assessed to play a significant role on the effects caused by <b>purge</b> <b>flow</b> injection. Furthermore, the flow field measurements yield a detailed insight into the interaction between purge and main annulus flow. Based on the results examined in this thesis, two different design proposals havebeen elaborated, which aim to reduce losses and hence increased the efficiency of the turbin...|$|E
40|$|The {{impact of}} the wheelspace cavity <b>purge</b> <b>flow</b> on a {{high-pressure}} axial low-reaction turbine stage is investigated. Both the flow's sealing ability and the performance impact associated with its injection are studied. Two operating speeds are tested, namely a high loading case and the peak efficiency, with <b>purge</b> <b>flow</b> rates covering a wide range. As the <b>purge</b> <b>flow</b> is injected upstream of the rotor, the sealing effectiveness is quantified both radially and tangentially close to the rim seal, where the tangential variation is used to identify the seal mixing region. Having passed the rotor blading, the <b>purge</b> <b>flow</b> distribution in the main annulus is quantified, showing an influence of operating speed. The <b>purge</b> <b>flow</b> core is localized to the trace of the vane wake, however somewhat migrated while passing through the blading. The combination of measurements shows that the impact on flow parameters cannot {{be used to determine}} the spanwise transport of the purge flow; hence two techniques are necessary to both judge the spanwise transport and impact on flow. With known sealing effectiveness, industry correlations may be adapted {{to make use of the}} variation of necessary purge rate to obtain a certain degree of effectiveness at a given operating point, and thereby optimize the efficiency. Also the distribution of the coolant in the main flow path may be used to optimize film cooling in that area. QC 20171129 </p...|$|E

These devices must be unloaded annually to recover their tritium collection efficiency. One approach to collecting the tritium released from ZrFe getter beds utilizes a cryotrap, a coil filled with crushed molecular sieve chilled to liquid nitrogen temperatures (77 K). The {{performance of a}} compact cryotrap was evaluated using hydrogen-helium mixtures. The hydrogen capacity of the cryotrap has been measured to be 5. 99 sL, or 58. 5 scc of hydrogen per gram of molecular sieve. At approximately one-fifth of the total capacity, the mean residence time of the hydrogen in the cryotrap is 170 minutes for a helium <b>purge</b> <b>flow</b> rate of 0. 100 L/min.

40|$|This {{paper is}} closed access. As aero gas turbine designs strive for ever greater {{efficiencies}} {{the trend is}} for engine overall pressure ratios to rise. Although this provides greater thermal efficiency it means that cycle temperatures also increase. Traditionally turbines have {{been the focus of}} cooling schemes to enable them to survive high temperatures. However, it is envisaged that the compressor delivery air will soon reach temperatures which mean they may require similar cooling strategies to the turbine. One such concept is akin to that of a turbine 'rim <b>purge</b> <b>flow</b> which ensures that hot, mainstream flow does not get ingested into rotor cavities. However, the main gas path in compressors is generally more aerodynamically sensitive than in turbines and introduction of a <b>purge</b> <b>flow</b> may be more penalizing. It is important to understand the impact such a flow may have on the primary gas path flow of a compressor and the downstream combustion system aerodynamics. This paper presents a preliminary investigation into the effects of a <b>purge</b> <b>flow</b> which enters the main gas path immediately upstream of the high pressure compressor outlet guide vane (OGV) row. Initial, simplified, CFD predictions clearly demonstrated the potential of the <b>purge</b> <b>flow</b> to negatively affect the OGV/pre-diffuser and alter the inlet conditions to the combustion system. Consequently, an experimental assessment was carried out using an existing fully annular, isothermal test facility which incorporated a bespoke 1. 5 stage axial compressor, engine relevant outlet guide vanes, pre-diffuser and downstream combustor geometry. Using CFD to guide the process the test rig was modified to allow a metered airflow to be introduced upstream of the outlet guide vanes. Importantly the flow was directed up the face of the rotor such that it picked up a representative swirl component prior to injection into the main gas path. The experimental data confirmed the CFD results and importantly demonstrated that the degradation in the combustor inlet flow resulted in an increased combustion system loss. At the proposed <b>purge</b> <b>flow</b> rate, equal to ∼ 1 % of the mainstream flow, these effects were small with the system loss increasing by ∼ 4 %. However, at higher <b>purge</b> <b>flow</b> rates (up to 3 %) these effects became notable and the OGV/pre-diffuser flow degraded significantly with a resultant increase in the combustion system loss of ∼ 13 %...|$|E
40|$|High {{response}} pressure {{data from a}} high-speed 1. 5 -stage turbine Hot Gas Ingestion Rig shows the existence of cavity modes in the rim-seal-wheelspace cavity for representative turbine engine operating conditions with <b>purge</b> <b>flow.</b> The experimental results and observations are complemented by computational assessments of cavity modes associated with flow in canonical cavity configurations. The cavity modes identified include Shallow Cavity modes and Helmholtz resonance. The response of the cavity modes to variation in design and operating parameters are assessed. These parameters include cavity aspect ratio, <b>purge</b> <b>flow</b> ratio, and flow angle defined by the ratio of primary tangential to axial velocity. Scaling the cavity modal response based on computational results and available experimental data {{in terms of the}} appropriate reduced frequencies appears to indicate the potential presence of a Deep Cavity mode as well. Computational assessment of canonical cavity flow suggests that increasing <b>purge</b> <b>flow</b> ratio mitigates Shallow Cavity modal response, in accord with data for the first Shallow Cavity mode but in contrast to data for the second Shallow Cavity mode. Likewise, increasing primary flow angle reduces the Shallow Cavity modal response that vanishes for flow angle beyond 450 *. This computational observation is in contrast to the rig data that show the modal response is nevertheless present with a flow angle greater than 45 *. An implication from the computational parametric assessments is that increasing <b>purge</b> <b>flow</b> and primary flow angle could provide a stabilizing effect on the response. Experimental requirements to quantify the effects of cavity modes on hot gas ingestion are identified along with inadequacies in the current rig set-up with the associated instrumentation system. As such, the role of cavity modes on hot gas ingestion cannot be clarified based on the current set of data. by Rachel A. Berg. Thesis: S.

The CO 2 purity is much less sensitive to changes of these conditions, unless either the rinse flow rate or the cycle time drop below certain values, which are determined by the ratio of the pressures {{at the end of the}} rinse and equalization steps. The optimum rinse flow, <b>purge</b> <b>flow</b> and cycle time have been determined with respect to the efficiency penalty due to the rinse and purge steam requirements, with a CO 2 recovery of 90 % and a dry CO 2 purity of 98 % as constraints, for a given feed flow rate, feed flow composition, operating pressure, reactor sizing and configuration.

40|$|Based on {{experiments}} on the 1 : 20 Hong Kong model diffuser, a numerical model for simulating seawater intrusion and purging process in an invertconnected outfall is developed. An {{extension of the}} theory of Guo and Sharp (1996), this is essentially a one dimensional unsteady flow model with locally 2 D techniques to account for stratification and density changes at riser-tunnel junctions. Numerical predictions of <b>purging</b> <b>flow</b> and times are in good agreement with measurements; key features of the purging sequence are also well-supported by the synoptic observed riser flows. Both experiments and calculations demonstrate that, unlike a soffit-connected outfall, the seawater {{at the bottom of the}} tunnel is initially purged, and the mixing between effluent and seawater is much stronger. The purging sequence in invert-connected situation is usually from seaward end to landward end for unsteady and quasi-steady purging; however for steady purging the sequence is from landward end to seaward end as in soffit-connected outfalls. The presence of an effluent layer at the top of the tunnel (due to e. g. pump shutdown) results in a persistent circulation in the system. The numerical model also shows that shortening the outfall tunnel length by an artificial bend has an effect on the purging sequence and time, but not the <b>purging</b> <b>flow.</b> Two-layer <b>purging</b> occurs in steady purging process and can help reduce purging discharge rate, especially with a large number of risers. Salt-assisted purging is effective only if the duration of the process is sufficiently long; however, the effluent volume required can be larger than that in the pure effluent purging process. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Main design features {{of our system}} are (a) highly transparent chamber walls consisting of chemically inert material, (b) individual <b>purging</b> <b>flow</b> units for each chamber, and (c) a movable lid for automated opening and closing of the chamber. The <b>purging</b> <b>flow</b> rate was chosen high {{enough to keep the}} mean residence time of the chamber air below one minute. This guarantees a proven efficient mixing of the chamber volume and a fast equilibration after lid closing. The dynamic chamber system is able to measure emission as well as deposition fluxes of trace gases. For the latter case, the modification of the turbulent transport by the chamber (compared to undisturbed ambient conditions) is quantitatively described by a bulk resistance concept.

Analyses {{have been carried out}} on a method to investigate the required <b>purging</b> <b>flow</b> of clean, dry gas to prevent the ingestion of external contaminants into the instrument container volume. The pressure to be maintained and the required flow are examined in terms of their effectiveness in preventing gaseous and particulate contaminant ingestion and abatement of self-generated contaminants in the volume. The required venting area or the existing volume venting area is correlated to the volume to be purged, the allowable pressure differential across the volume, the external contaminant partial pressure, and the sizes of the ambient particulates. The diffusion of external water vapor into the volume while it was being purged was experimentally obtained in terms of an infiltration time constant.

The aspect ratio (building height (H) / street width (W)) is 1 and building width is B= 3 H. Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations were first validated by experimental data, confirming that standard k-ε model predicted airflow velocity better than RNG k-ε model, realizable k–ε model and Reynolds stress model. Three ventilation indices were numerically analyzed for ventilation assessment, including flow rates across street roofs and openings {{to show the}} mechanisms of air exchange, age of air to display how long external air reaches a place after entering UCL, and <b>purging</b> <b>flow</b> rate to quantify the net UCL ventilation capacity induced by mean flows and turbulence.

40|$|The {{impact of}} the purge mass flow {{injection}} on aerodynamics and film cooling effectiveness of a high pressure turbine with non-axisymmetric endwall contouring is investigated. The three-stage multi-purpose turbine research facility at the Turbomachinery Performance and Flow Research Laboratory (TPFL), Texas A&M University is utilized. The rotor includes non-axisymmetric endwall contouring on {{the first and second}} rotor row. While {{in the case of the}} second rotor, the endwall contouring has brought substantial reduction in secondary flow losses and thus an efficiency increase, the first rotor shows different behavior due to its immediate exposure to the <b>purge</b> <b>flow</b> injection. The <b>purge</b> <b>flow</b> investigation involves the reference case without endwall contouring. Efficiency, pressure, temperature and film cooling effectiveness distributions are determined for purge mass flow ratios of MFR = 0. 5 %, 1. 0 % and 1. 5 %. The small amount of the injected mass flow drastically changes the development of the secondary flow structure of the contoured first turbine row. Four pairs of rotor blades with different cooling configurations have been manufactured and axissymmetrically installed at the first rotor row. Currently preliminary numerical simulations have been performed for plane tip with tip hole cooling. The results show that around 50 % area of the blade tip is covered by the film cooling, while other 50 % is exposed to the mainstream. No space for upstream extension of first roto...|$|E

So, {{this may be the}} maximum performance to obtain in terms of the best process variables. Thus, {{it is important that the}} behavior of the PSA operating variables was undertaking a review to know the optimum operating conditions.

40|$|This thesis {{contributes}} to {{studies on the}} assessment of building ventilation performance {{and the development of}} turbulence models accounting for Low-Reynolds-number (LRN) effects and buoyant convection with heat transfer. Assessments of building ventilation performance are discussed with respect to indoor air distribution and passive contaminant dispersion. Different concepts and methods for analyzing and assessing ventilation flow systems are addressed and re-examined. Several new ventilation scales have been developed, including the local purging effectiveness, the expected contaminant dispersion index and the local specific contaminant-accumulating index. Approaches for numerically exploring these scales are presented. The <b>purging</b> <b>flow</b> rate is re-formulated in several expressions different from its original and previous descriptions. Some scales defined from this quantity are discussed. Using stochastic theory in conjunction with the compartmental method, a Markov chain model is proposed to determine the transfer probability needed to compute the regional <b>purging</b> <b>flow</b> rate. This model contains extra and useful information that is not included in previous deterministic analyses. The new scales and methods are expected to be applicable for diagnosing problems and optimizing designs of ventilation systems. The development of turbulence models based on the eddy viscosity concept is considered. For simulating turbulent recirculating flows, a comparison is made of the two-equation k-. epsilon. model, k-. omega. model and k-. tau. model. It is found that both the k-. omega. model and the k-. tau. model have relatively poor performance. Modifications are made for the k-. omega. model in which the model constants are re-established and the turbulent transport term in the. omega. -equation is re-modelled. On the basis of these modifications, a new LRN k. omega. model is developed in which the damping functions are re-devised and the near-wall asymptotic behaviour is emphasized. The mechanism for simulating transition is preserved in the modified model. The LRN formulation is further extended for analyzing buoyant-driven flows in enclosures at moderate Rayleigh numbers. The model behaviour accounting for transition onset in the boundary layer along the vertical side wall is discussed, and some remarks are made for the LRN formulation. The new LRN model shows promising improvements in the predictions. Large eddy simulation (LES) is implemented for turbulent convection flows with heat transfer. A modified subgrid-scale (SGS) buoyancy model is proposed, where the buoyant effect is explicitly accommodated in the SGS eddy viscosity/diffusivity formulation. The modification enables the model to avoid entailing no-real solutions for simulating thermal convection flows such as occurs in the original buoyancy model. Furthermore, the proposed model is able to account for some energy backscatter for flows with positive and significant thermal stratification. Comparisons and evaluations are made of several SGS models when applied to statistically stratified and unstratified buoyant flows. The performance of the SGS models is analyzed for natural convection boundary layer flows at moderate Rayleigh numbers, where laminar, transitional and fully developed turbulent flow features subsequently arise in the boundary layer. The behaviour of SGS models in accounting for energy backscatter is argued to be an essential ingredient for predicting natural transitional boundary layer flows. The failure and success of SGS models for handling this type of flow are analyzed and discussed...|$|R
