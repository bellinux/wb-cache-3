Fe and Zn densities had highly significant and negative, albeit weak, correlations with grain yield and highly significant and moderate positive correlation with grain weight in hybrids. These correlations, however, were non-significant in the <b>parental</b> <b>lines.</b> Thus, to breed hybrids with high Fe and Zn densities would require incorporating these micronutrients in both <b>parental</b> <b>lines.</b> Also, simultaneous selection for Fe and Zn densities based on performance per se would be highly effective in selecting for GCA.

For this purpose, we compared effects of salt stress on growth, ion content, and expression level of several genes related to K+/Na+ metabolism between RZ 35 and Matsumae. We found that relative to Matsumae, the salt tolerance trait in RZ 5 was significantly compromised due to weakened capacity in Na+ exclusion under the salt stress condition, and hence, escalated the injuries of Na+ and Cl- in shoots. Accordingly, four genes known {{to be involved in}} the Na+ exclusion, i.e., OsHKT 1; 5, OsSOS 1, OsCIPK 24 and OsCBL 4, were found to be significantly down-regulated in roots of RZ 35 relative to its rice <b>parental</b> <b>line</b> under the salt stress condition, thus implicating a gene expression regulation-based molecular mechanism underlying the difference in salt tolerance between the introgression line and its rice <b>parental</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E
40|$|Wisser, RandallThe genetic {{diversity}} present within U. S. maize represents {{a small fraction}} of the total diversity available globally for maize. The lack of {{genetic diversity}} within U. S. maize may constrain the potential for trait improvement and it raises concerns about the vulnerability of the U. S. maize crop to biological and environmental stresses. Utilizing germplasm with unique, putatively useful variation would help to mitigate these issues, and a rich source of diversity is available in tropical maize germplasm. Adapting tropical material to temperate climates can be highly inefficient due to major genetic barriers including photoperiod sensitivity. As part of a national collaboration (Maize ATLAS project), a tropical synthetic (TropicS) population was developed from seven tropical inbred lines with the goal of using it to study the genetics of response to artificial selection on flowering time across multiple environments. Development of this resource led to two main questions: Do the <b>parental</b> <b>lines</b> contain the novel genetic diversity expected of tropical germplasm? And, how does the TropicS population relate to expectations about genetic diversity as defined by those parents? To examine genetic diversity among the <b>parental</b> <b>lines,</b> nucleotide diversity was compared to that of a tropical subpopulation of a diversity panel. Additionally, differentiation between the <b>parental</b> <b>lines</b> and a representative sample of temperate germplasm was examined using the fixation index (FST). Measures of nucleotide diversity showed that the <b>parental</b> <b>lines</b> contained less diversity than other subpopulations (0. 271 for the <b>parental</b> <b>lines</b> vs. 0. 293 for the temperate group and 0. 284 for the tropical group). FST between the TropicS parents and temperate germplasm ranged from 0 to 0. 8 with an average of 0. 11, suggesting moderate differentiation between the two groups, with some highly differentiated regions of the genome. To examine the structure of genetic diversity in the TropicS population, tests on the expectation for allele frequencies in the population were performed and linkage disequilibrium was characterized. Allele frequencies in the TropicS were very close to the <b>parental</b> <b>lines</b> with the average shift in frequency being less than 10 % and well in line with expectations due solely to genetic drift.

Plants wer雜種高粱臺中五號與其親本 80 B及 2 R分別種植於 1994 年秋作及 19958 年春作，開 花期、開花後二週及收穫期分別調查植株生長及產量的性狀，以其了解其雜種優勢在不同期 作環境下的表現。試驗結果顯示無論是春作、秋作，雜種高梁臺中五號收穫時具有較大乾重、 穗重、每穗粒數及千粒重也較多、較重，所以產量亦較親本為高；雜種高粱臺中五號的一些 與產量有關的性狀其雜種優勢在春作表現的較秋作明顯。此外，秋作與春作雜種高粱臺中五 號維持產量的手段也不同，前者在開花期已具有較重的堅葉乾重，開花後具有較高的光合作 用...|$|E
40|$|The {{three lines}} methods in hybrid rice have {{disadvantages}} in seed production procedures {{that result in}} low seed yield. Low levels of natural crosses (outcrossing) {{is one of the}} causes of low seed yield in hybrid seed production. GA 3 application and proper spacing, expected to improve of F 1 hybrid seed production. The experimental design used was Split Plot design with three replications. The main plot was doses of GA 3 application consist of 0, 200 ppm and 300 ppm. The subplot was row ratios of restores:CMS i,e 2 R: 8 A, 2 R: 12 A; 2 R: 16 A. The material used is <b>parental</b> <b>lines</b> of HIPA 14. The results showed that GA 3 application was able to increased plant height of <b>parental</b> <b>lines</b> (CMS and restorer), number of productive tillers, exterted panicle and stigma also outcrossing rate at seed production of HIPA 14. The row ratio was influenced for plant heigh of CMS lines. Interaction between GA 3 and row ratio was increased plant height of <b>parental</b> <b>lines,</b> exerted panicle, and outcrossing rat...|$|R
40|$|Some 46 phenotypically uniform {{varieties}} {{derived from}} various crosses, {{along with their}} <b>parental</b> <b>lines,</b> were compared for yield and seed quality characteristics during 2 post-rainy seasons (1990 / 91 and 1991 / 92). Seven varieties, ICGVs 90298, 90301, 90307, 90308, 90310, 90312 and 90324, produced mean pod yields of > 3 t/ha, an increase of 11 to 110 % compared to the <b>parental</b> <b>lines.</b> They also had a greater 100 -seed weight, and oleic/linoleic acid ratios were similar or better than the <b>parental</b> <b>lines.</b> ICGV 90307 had a mean pod yield of 3. 89 t/ha, with a 100 -seed weight of 82 g and oleic/linoleic acid ratio of 1. 58. There was significant positive heterosis for pods/plant and pod weight/plant in several crosses, while for pod length/width ratio, seed length/width ratio and 100 -seed weight there was significant positive and negative heterosis over the better parent. Pods/plant and pod weight/plant were controlled by non-additive genetic variances, while pod and seed characteristics were predominantly controlled by additive gene effects...|$|R
30|$|Two rice (Oryza sativa) <b>parental</b> <b>lines</b> [cultivars IR 64 (indica pollen donor) and Nipponbare (japonica acceptor)] {{were used}} for {{producing}} a RIL population. Four F 2 seeds from one F 1 seed were produced (kindly provided by Dr. Narayana Upadhyaya). Only one F 2 plant was used for producing all RILs in this study. The detailed steps for selecting RILs for six allele groups are listed in Figure  1. All plants including RILs and their <b>parental</b> <b>lines</b> were grown in a glass house of a plant growth facility at CSIRO Agriculture Flagship (Canberra, ACT, Australia) at 27 °C under natural light. Mature seeds were harvested for starch preparation, and starch structure and properties analysed.|$|R
