40|$|Demand for {{freshwater}} {{is rising}} with factors, such as population growth, land use change and climate variations, rendering water availability {{in the future}} uncertain. Groundwater resources are being increasingly exploited to meet this growing demand. The {{aim of this study}} is to identify the influence of population growth induced by land use change and climate change on the future state of freshwater resources of Lamu Island in Kenya where a major port facility is under construction. The results of this study show that the “no industrial development” <b>population</b> <b>scenario</b> (assuming the port was not constructed) would be expected to reach ~ 50, 000 people by 2050, while the projected population upon completion is expected to reach 1. 25 million in the same year when the Lamu Port-South Sudan-Ethiopia Transport Corridor Program (LAPSSET) port reaches its full cargo-handling capacity. The groundwater abstraction in 2009 was 0. 06 m 3 daily per capita, while the demand is expected to raise to 0. 1 m 3 by 2050 according to the “LAPSSET development” projection. The modelling results show that the Shela aquifer in Lamu, which is the main source of water on the island, will not experience stress by 2065 for the “no industrial development” <b>population</b> <b>scenario,</b> whereas for the “LAPSSET development projection” <b>population</b> <b>scenario,</b> it will occur sooner (between 2020 and 2028). The modelling results show that the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) climate change scenarios will have a smaller impact on the effective water volume reserves than Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) for the “no industrial development”, while the impact is expected to be similar for the “LAPSSET development”, suggesting that population growth exacerbated by land use change will be a more significant driving force than climate change in affecting freshwater availability...|$|E

This consists of a review and analysis of previous work by Public Service of New Hampshire {PSNH) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), as well as an independent calculation of evacuation times using the CLEAR model for the demographic data reported by PSNH. Secondly, this study includes independent estimations of evacuation time for the peak <b>population</b> <b>scenario</b> developed using demographic data prepared by the U. S.

These evacuation time estimates are approximately 60 % and 84 % greater, respectively, than the estimate provided by PSNH for a simulataneous evacuation of the entire EPZ under peak conditions. The CLEAR model, which was developed by Pacific Northwest Laboratory {PNL) under the sponsorship of the. NRC, was also used for these latter calculations. The results of this study reveal the importance of the assumptions used for calculating evacuation times. Because traffic routings and management plans have not been prepared for the area, the CLEAR calculations utilized indepdently prepared traffic routings and assumptions. A detailed analysis of the results suggests that the ETEs submitted by PSNH are consistent with the methods and assumptions which provide the bases for PSNH•s evacuation time estimates.

40|$|We compute an {{age profile}} for public {{expenditures}} on health by calculating separate spending profiles for inpatient care, physician services and pharmaceuticals {{for the year}} 2000. We further employ three demographic scenarios to project age-related expenditures between 2000 and 2050. The Austrian profile exhibits that expenditures rise noticeably with age. For instance, per capita expenses for the 85 - 89 age group are about five times as high as in the 35 - 39 one. This pattern {{is also found in}} other EU countries. At 2. 9 % of GDP, inpatient care accounts {{for more than half of}} the total Austrian public expenditures on health and thus the shape of age-related inpatient care expenditures dominates the age profile. As opposed to inpatient care, we find that the profile for physician services shows a roughly linear increase, indicating that expenditures here grow rather in proportion to increasing age. However, the age profile for expenses on medical drugs is even steeper than that for inpatient care, which corroborates observed growth patterns in pharmaceutical care and heightens the age profile for public expenditures. During the next decades the shift in the age structure will cause a shift of expenditure shares. The share of public expenditures on health spent on the 80 + population group will have more than doubled by 2050. At 4. 9 % of GDP in 2000, public expenditures on health are predicted to increase until 2050 to 6. 4 % in the central <b>population</b> <b>scenario,</b> to 6. 0 % in the high <b>population</b> <b>scenario</b> and to 6. 7 % in the high life expectancy scenario. ...|$|E

Can the presented <b>population</b> <b>scenarios</b> encompass working-age <b>population</b> growth trajectories emerging out of such kind of context? We think the answer is affirmative for the following reasons. The first and main reason is that the ‘population momentum’ embedded in age-sex pyramids in base year 2015 leaves little room for effects of changes in, say, fertility and mortality, due to a political reorientation between 2015 and 2035. For instance, regarding the impact on the working-age population, change of fertility rates during the period 2015 – 2025 will only become visible after 2035. The second reason is that effects of changes in fertility and mortality are attenuated because to some extent they cancel out such {{as in the case of}} higher fertility rates and lower life expectancies.|$|R

Heterozygosity is compared to other genotypic indices designed for specific marker types.

As the Mediterranean trawl fishery mainly harvests recruits and juveniles and fishery harvesting induces adaptive changes in life history traits, the sharp decrease in L of recruits could be explained as a growth reduction due to the selective pres- sure to stay under mesh size for longer and thus maximize survival until reproduction.

The baseline model is based on recent demographic projections issued by the Czech Statistical Office that forecast a shrinking share of the working-age population.

Population ageing is {{found to have a}} significant impact on future government expenditure via spending on old-age pensions and health care, where the cost profiles are modelled to reflect technological progress in the treatment of ageing-related illnesses. The analysis shows that under the current policy settings, a compound demographic effect will cause the primary government balance to turn negative at the beginning of the 2030 s. The growing primary deficits, along with interest payments, which react to debt dynamics, will lead to a rapid escalation of government debt.

In this paper, we present our results on near-infrared CRIRES spectroscopic observations of six cool giant stars in NGC 6656 (M 22) : the main objective is to derive the F content and its internal variation in this peculiar cluster, which exhibits significant changes in both light- and heavy-element abundances.

40|$|Background The {{potential}} of combining multiple populations in genomic prediction is {{depending on the}} consistency of linkage disequilibrium (LD) between SNPs and QTL across populations. We investigated consistency of multi-locus LD across populations using selection index theory and investigated the relationship between consistency of multi-locus LD and accuracy of genomic prediction across different simulated scenarios. In the selection index, QTL genotypes were considered as breeding goal traits and SNP genotypes as index traits, based on LD among SNPs and between SNPs and QTL. The consistency of multi-locus LD across populations was computed as the accuracy of predicting QTL genotypes in selection candidates using a selection index derived in the reference <b>population.</b> Different <b>scenarios</b> of within and across population genomic prediction were evaluated, using all SNPs or only the four neighboring SNPs of a simulated QTL. Phenotypes were simulated using different numbers of QTL underlying the trait. The relationship between the calculated consistency of multi-locus LD and accuracy of genomic prediction using a GBLUP type of model was investigated. Results The accuracy of predicting QTL genotypes, i. e. the measure describing consistency of multi-locus LD, was much lower for across <b>population</b> <b>scenarios</b> compared to within <b>population</b> <b>scenarios,</b> and was lower when QTL had a low MAF compared to QTL randomly selected from the SNPs. Consistency of multi-locus LD was highly correlated with the realized accuracy of genomic prediction across different scenarios and the correlation was higher when QTL were weighted according to their effects in the selection index instead of weighting QTL equally. By only considering neighboring SNPs of QTL, accuracy of predicting QTL genotypes within population decreased, but it substantially increased the accuracy across populations. Conclusions Consistency of multi-locus LD across populations is a characteristic of {{the properties of the}} QTL in the investigated populations and can provide more insight in underlying reasons for a low empirical accuracy of across population genomic prediction. By focusing in genomic prediction models only on neighboring SNPs of QTL, multi-locus LD is more consistent across populations since only short-range LD is considered, and accuracy of predicting QTL genotypes of individuals from another population is increased. <br/...|$|R
