40|$|The Baccalaureate Thesis {{deals with}} {{the design of a}} tool for fixing of thrust rings in flanges of high {{pressure}} fuel injection pumps. The theoretical part of the final project summarizes both theory-based and cold metal and alloy working-based knowledge. Three options of fixing the thrust ring in the flange of a high pressure fuel injection pump have been developed. Based on tests carried out, the option II has been chosen for repairs of fuel injection pumps flanges since {{it seems to be the}} most advantageous one. The high pressure fuel injection <b>pump</b> <b>flange</b> is made of AlSilMgMn aluminium alloy. The thrust ring is made by C 75 sheet steel stamping according to DIN 17222 (ČSN 12081). The tool drawing was made on the basis of the best-fit technology repair option. Stamping tools are made of 19 452 steel and hardened to HRC 60 - 4. The assumed yearly output amounts to 7000 pieces. A special purpose machine is used for repairing fuel injection pump flanges...|$|E

50|$|This {{family has}} {{about a hundred}} species that have a {{distribution}} limited mainly to eastern Asia. Urostylids are somewhat longer (4 to 15 mm) than broad with elongated legs with three tarsal segments and a small head. The antenna has 5 segments of which the first is longer than the head. The base of the antenna has broad tubercles and has a ringed appearance. The simple eyes or ocelli, when present (Urolabida lacks ocelli), {{are very close to}} each other. On the underside they show a wide separation between the hind and mid coxae. Other important family characters are the presence of a structure for stridulation, the stridulitrum on the first anal vein of the hind wing and bristles on the claws. The female genital structure has nine gonocoxites that form a M or W-shaped sclerite. They suck plant sap. The male reproductive anatomy suggests close affinities to the Tessaratomidae subfamily Natalicolinae. The spermatheca has two <b>pump</b> <b>flanges</b> in two genera which is a feature found also in the Aradidae and Leptopodidae. Thus the phylogeny of the group is unclear but lies within the Pentatomoidea.In the past the family was divided into two subfamilies, but one group, the Saileriolinae, has since been suggested as a distinct family, Saileriolidae, by at least two studies. The position of Saileriolidae within the Pentatomoidea is still unclear.|$|R

In the measurement, non-radioactive test gases deuterium, helium, neon, argon and krypton were used, the input gas flow was provided by a commercial mass-flow controller, and the output flow was measured using a residual gas analyzer, in order to distinguish it from the outgassing background. The measured {{reduction factor}} with the empty beam tube {{at room temperature for}} gases with mass 4 is 1. 8 (4) E 4, which is in excellent agreement with the simulated value of 1. 6 E 4. The simulated reduction factor for tritium, based on the interpolated value for the capture factor at the turbo-molecular <b>pump</b> inlet <b>flange</b> is 2. 5 E 4.

40|$|While nipple pain {{is common}} in the first 10 days of {{breastfeeding}} and during the infant’s teething process, sore nipples should not persist beyond this period and are often disregarded as “normal ” by many providers. Sore and painful nipples are NOT normal side effects of breastfeeding. Sore nipples {{may be due to}} abrasions that occur during feeding or from tight fitting clothing. These breaks in the skin pre-dispose the mother to infections of the nipple, as well as mastitis. Less common causes include psoriasis, eczema and contact dermatitis. Always bring mother in for a nipple and latch evaluation. Improper latch or flat/inverted nipples are common causes of nipple pain without infection. Consult with an IBCLC to evaluate latch depth and consider changing position during feeding or use of a nipple shield if indicated. If pumping, have mother bring in her <b>pump</b> and <b>flanges</b> to ensure a proper fit. Remember to evaluate the infant for ankyloglossia as a potential cause of nipple pain. For non-infected cracked nipples, breast milk combined with nipple cream, such as lanolin may promote healing thus we often encourage patients to express and apply breast milk to the healing nipple after and in-between feeds.

40|$|Lecturepg. 97 The suction-impeller (single-suction) of a 33, 500 hp, four-stage {{barrel pump}} used in boiler feed service at a fossil fuel steam plant {{experienced}} operating life ranging from 6. 0 to 19 months. Cavitation erosion on the suction surface {{and in the}} hub fillet area caused this unacceptably short life. This pump design is unique in that its suction-stage operates at an inlet tip velocity of 281 ft/sec. This tip speed, coupled with a stage pressure rise of about 1160 psi places this machine well {{into the category of}} ?high energy? pumps, and signals the need for special design attention to elements of its hydraulic design in order to provide suitable performance, reliability and operability. In a joint program with the user and the pump manufacturer, the problem was investigated, a test program conducted, redesign of the impeller completed and replacement impellers commissioned in the field. Elements of the investigation and test program included the impeller design itself, suction bay distortions and effects of distorted flow generated by the upstream piping. The redesign was accomplished through the use of sophisticated computational techniques and experimental flow visualization. The final design, referred to as a biased-wedge, was manufactured using a precision, lost wax casting process, with a special stereolithographic technique used to translate the final blade design into usable patterns. One of the final set of impellers was tested using flow visualization. The test program confirmed that the final design was free of cavitation bubbles at the baseload condition and significantly reduced vapor activity and hence damage potential at min-flow. The effects of flow distortions (on cavitation activity) presented to the impeller by the suction bay (so prevalent with the conventional design) was effectively countered by the biased-wedge design. Finally, the flow distortions (both introduction of swirl and uneven mass distribution) at the <b>pump</b> suction <b>flange</b> were modeled and tested with both conventional and biased-wedge impellers. In both cases, these distortions had no effect on the formation or collapse of cavitation vapor in the impeller eye. These conclusions are valid for only this single-suction type of configuration. The impellers have been commissioned in the field units and are currently accumulating operational hours...|$|R
40|$|The hard-material {{reinforced}} {{duplex steel}} coatings were deposited by plasma arc two-powder surfacing. By varying {{the angle of}} the hard materials feeding process, the deposition of the carbides was optimized so that they are deposited into the matrix in the trailing zone of the welding torch under conditions of very low thermal effects near the freezing point of the weld pool. Microstructural studies revealed that the deposition of the hard materials prevents devlopment of the typical, ferritic-austenitic microstructure of duplex steels. Due to a dissolution and diffusion process, the microstructure of the matrix takes up carbon and chromium or tungsten, depending on the carbide, thus enhancing the austenitic material in the microstructure. The wear behaviour of the surface deposits was found to be very good, wear being reduced by a factor of 6, irrespective of the type of carbide. The friction-affected surfaces showed no dissolving effects or cracking. The corrosion behaviour in sulfuric acid is also good. The welded deposits exhibited the typical behaviour of a passive material. Wear mechanisms slightly reduce the resistance. The behaviour of various specimens in artificial seawater could be distinctly assessed. Small grain fractions and pre-heating temperatures of 100 C have a beneficial effect on the corrosion resistance. The technique recommends itself for applications such as coatings for baffle plates used in flue gas desulfurisation, pipes, <b>pump</b> components, <b>flanges</b> or nozzles, or for recurrent coating of system components affected by abrasive corrosion. (orig. /CB) Zur Herstellung hartstoffverstaerkter Duplex-Beschichtungen wurde das Plasma-Zwei-Pulver-Auftragschweissverfahren verwendet. Hierbei wurde durch Variation des Zufuhrwinkels der Hartstoffe der Einbringungsort der Karbide optimiert, so dass diese im Nachlauf des Schweissbrenners mit sehr geringer thermischer Beeinflussung im erstarrungsnahen Schmelzbadbereich in die Matrix eingelagert werden konnten. Mikrostrukturuntersuchungen zeigten, dass sich durch die Einlagerung von Hartstoffen nicht mehr das typische ferritisch-austenitische Gefuege von Duplexstahl einstellt. Durch Aufloesung und Diffusion reichert sich das Matrixgefuege mit Kohlenstoff und je nach Karbid mit Chrom bzw. Wolfram an, was zu einer Erhoehung der austenitischen Gefuegebestandteile fuehrt. Das Verschleissverhalten der Auftragschweissungen ist sehr gut. Der Abtrag verringert sich unabhaengig von der Karbidart um den Faktor 6. Die Reibflaechen zeigen keine Ausloesungen oder Rissbildung. Das Korrosionsverhalten in Schwefelsaeure ist ebenfalls gut. Die Schweissungen zeigen das typische Verhalten eines passiven Werkstoffes. Die Bestaendigkeit sinkt etwas nach Verschleissbeanspruchung. In kuenstlichem Meerwasser ist eine gute Differenzierung einzelner Proben moeglich. Kleine Kornfraktionen und Vorwaermtemperaturen von 100 C wirken sich positiv auf die Korrosionsbestaendigkeit aus.

40|$|Safety measure {{design and}} {{accident}} predictive and prevention strategies are {{critical in the}} offshore process. The key area of concern in an offshore facility is a major event such as a fire, an explosion {{and the release of}} hazardous materials. The recent BP Transocean Deepwater Horizon accident is an example of safety protocols either being inadequate or response being inefficient and ineffective. Understanding the consequences of major release events is a key step in safety measure design and consequence assessment of major events. The assessment includes the definition of different release scenarios, release modeling, event modeling, and damage/loss quantification. The consequence assessment is an important step of risk estimation and is subsequently used to design safety measures. [...] To address release scenario modeling, a new methodology is developed in the current study to revise the emission factor estimation methods earlier developed by USEPA. Applying a non-linear regression approach, a new set of equations is introduced to estimate emission rates. Having ΔAIC values of more than 10, in the categories of <b>pump</b> seals, connectors, <b>flanges</b> and others, the equations replace USEPA's proposed correlation equations for oil and gas facilities. [...] Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is used to simulate different release scenarios, particularly to study fire, explosion and toxic dispersion. The Flame Acceleration Simulator (FLACS), a CFD tool, is used to model explosion and toxic dispersion of combustion products. To improve the consequence modeling work, a systematic approach for CFD modeling of Vapour Cloud explosion (VCE) is also introduced. Fire Dynamic Simulator (FDS) is used to model pool and jet fires. [...] A novel integrated approach in modeling the evolving accident scenarios is also developed in the current study. To develop the toxic risk profile of combustion products of an installation, a risk-based approach is proposed, overcoming the shortcomings of a concentration-based approach. [...] The newly developed approaches and models are tested on real-life case studies...|$|R
40|$|The {{approach}} flow to a pump must be undisturbed {{and free}} from unequal velocity distributions, unequal pressure distributions, entrained air or gas bubbles, vortices and excessive pre-swirl. A reducer fitting is typically used in pump station pipe {{work to reduce}} the size of the suction pipe to match the size of the <b>pump</b> suction end <b>flange.</b> Two types of reducer fittings are commonly manufactured, namely: Eccentric Reducers and Concentric Reducers. Inlet pipework design guidelines traditionally prescribe the use of eccentric reducers, with the flat side on top. This prescription is to allow the transport of air through the fitting. The flow through an eccentric reducer accelerates along the sloped side as the flow path narrows from below, thereby causing higher velocities towards this sloped side. These flow conditions are contradictory to the recommended pump inlet approach flow conditions and pump station failures have been recorded resulting from the incorrect application of eccentric reducers. Relationships exist to assess the hydraulic transportation of air through a pipe and these relationships can be applied to calculate the ability to transport air through a concentric reducer. It is therefore hypothesised that a correctly designed concentric reducer will not only provide a more uniform pressure/velocity distribution in comparison to an eccentric reducer, but will allow any free air to be hydraulically transported through the reducer to the pump. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) was utilised to assess the resulting velocity distributions through various concentric and eccentric reducer geometries at various flow rates. Six concentric reducers and six eccentric reducers were simulated with four inlet velocities. The resulting velocity distributions were recorded with scalar scenes and velocity probes at four positions spaced at a distance of 1 x the downstream diameter starting at the downstream end of the reducer. These velocity distributions were then compared to the pump inlet requirements typically used in the industry. These requirements require the velocity variation along a line drawn through the centre of the pipe to be less than 10 % of the average velocity along that line and the velocity variation along a circle within the pipe is less than 5 % of the average velocity along the circle. It was found that the eccentric reducers with angles of 15 °, 20 ° and 30 ° and the concentric reducer with an angle of 20 ° do not pass the requirements used in the assessment at all four velocities. From these results it was highlighted that some of the standard eccentric reducer geometries (including those specified by AWWA C 208) do not pass the inlet requirements. It was then assessed if air can be hydraulically transported through the concentric reducers utilising available hydraulic air transport theory. Air can be hydraulically transported through all of the concentric reducers except for the 20 ° reducer (the same size that failed the velocity distribution assessment) at 1 m/s for the assessed diameters. It was therefore shown that a correctly designed concentric reducer (angle less or equal to 15 °) will not only provide a more uniform pressure/velocity distribution in comparison to an eccentric reducer, but will allow air to be hydraulically transported through the reducer to the pump.
