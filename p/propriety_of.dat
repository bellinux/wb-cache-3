5|$|After Sibelius's {{death in}} 1957, {{news of the}} Eighth Symphony's {{destruction}} was made public, and {{it was assumed that}} the work had disappeared forever. But in the 1990s, when the composer's many notebooks and sketches were being catalogued, scholars first raised the possibility that fragments of the music for the lost symphony might have survived. Since then, several short manuscript sketches have been tentatively identified with the Eighth, three of which (comprising less than three minutes of music) were recorded by the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra in 2011. While a few musicologists have speculated that, if further fragments can be identified, {{it may be possible to}} reconstruct the entire work, others have suggested that this is unlikely given the ambiguity of the extant material. The <b>propriety</b> <b>of</b> publicly performing music that Sibelius himself had rejected has also been questioned.|$|E
5|$|By 1770, Sabrina {{began to}} {{question}} Day's techniques and {{to complain about the}} chores she had to perform. In December, the <b>propriety</b> <b>of</b> Day's arrangement with Sabrina was questioned by the local community, especially Anna Seward. Edgeworth joined Day for Christmas at Stowe, and convinced him that his experiment had been unsuccessful. He also persuaded Day that Sabrina was too old to live with him without a chaperone. Day appeared to accept Edgeworth's point of view, as he paid for Sabrina to attend Sutton Coldfield boarding school in Warwickshire early in 1771. She remained at the boarding school for three years, including weekends and holidays, with infrequent visits from Day. The school normally focused on preparing high society daughters for marriage, with subjects such as needlework and the arts. Day stipulated that she was to be taught academic subjects but should not dance or learn music.|$|E

Endecott pointed out {{that he should have}} let the French fight amongst themselves without English involvement, as this would weaken them both. The 1644 governor's election became a referendum on Winthrop's policy; Endecott was elected governor, with Winthrop as his deputy. During his one-year term he oversaw the division of the colony into four counties: Suffolk, Essex, Middlesex, and Norfolk. The ascent of the Salem-based Endecott also prompted an attempt by other Salem residents to have the colonial capital relocated there; the attempt was rejected by the governor's council of assistants.|$|E
5|$|The {{impact of}} the First World War {{dramatically}} shifted public perceptions on the <b>propriety</b> <b>of</b> the man's wristwatch, and opened up a mass market in the post-war era. The creeping barrage artillery tactic, developed during the War, required precise synchronization between the artillery gunners and the infantry advancing behind the barrage. Service watches produced during the War were specially designed for the rigours of trench warfare, with luminous dials and unbreakable glass. Wristwatches were also found to be needed {{in the air as}} much as on the ground: military pilots found them more convenient than pocket watches for the same reasons as Santos-Dumont had. The British War Department began issuing wristwatches to combatants from 1917.|$|E
5|$|Speculation {{that this}} would be the {{decision}} had already taken place, and both Glenn and McCain were frustrated that the long delay in resolving their cases was damaging their reputations. However, there were political implications, as the removal of the two would eliminate the only Republican from the case. The committee's work was further made difficult by there being no specific rule that governed the <b>propriety</b> <b>of</b> members intervening with federal regulators. By mid-October, several Republican senators, including former Ethics Committee chair Ted Stevens, were taking the unusual step of publicly complaining about the Ethics Committee's inaction, saying that it was unfair to Glenn and McCain, that the whole lengthy process was unfair to all five, and that political motives might be behind the delays. Eventually, the committee could not agree on the Bennett recommendation regarding Glenn and McCain: vice chair Rudman agreed with Bennett, chair Heflin did not. On October 23, 1990, the committee decided to keep all five senators in the case, and scheduled public hearings to question them and other witnesses.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Brazil is world's greater {{producer}} of charcoal, and the Brazilian state Minas Gerais presents the greater production of said product. The wood proprieties influence the charcoal quality, making {{important to know}} them, {{it is known that}} these proprieties vary according to the age of the tree. With that being said, this research aimed to determine the correlations existing between age, the <b>proprieties</b> <b>of</b> the wood and charcoal proprieties. Three Eucalyptus sp. clones from Gerdau S/A were evaluated, at four ages, 3, 4, 5 and 7. From each tree, five discs were removed (0 %, 25 %, 50 %, 75 % and 100 % corresponding to the commercial height of the trunk). We determined the core/sapwood relationship, basic density, chemical composition of the wood, the calorific value of the wood and of the charcoal, the gravimetric yields, apparent relative density and charcoal chemical analysis, in addition to the analysis of the condensable and non-condensable gases. Correlations between age, <b>proprieties</b> <b>of</b> the wood and charcoal were performed. It was observed a negative correlation between the age of the wood and charcoal ashes content, regardless the clones evaluated. A positive correlation between the basic density of the wood and the apparent density of the coal and a positive correlation between the lignin of wood content and the coal apparent density were observed, as well. The siringil/guaiacil relation, which determines the quantity of each type of lignin existent on the wood, presented a negative correlation with the gravimetric yields in charcoal. Therefore, it is concluded that the age of the tree influenced the <b>proprieties</b> <b>of</b> the wood, regardless the clone; the age of the genetic material did not influence the gravimetric yield in charcoal; the GG 680 clone presented greater potential to produce charcoal, considering only the <b>proprieties</b> <b>of</b> the wood...|$|R
