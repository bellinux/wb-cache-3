500|$|Afanasieff {{flew back}} to California where he {{finished}} the song's programming and production. Originally, he had a live band play the drums and other instruments {{with the thought of}} giving it a more raw and affective sound. He was unhappy with the results of the recording and subsequently scrapped the effort and used his original, personal arrangement and programmed all the instruments heard on the song (with the exception of the background vocals) including the piano, effects, drums and triangle. While Carey continued writing material in her rented home in The Hamptons, Afanasieff completed the song's programming and awaited to rendezvous with her a final time in order to layer and harmonize the background vocals. In touching on several aspects of what excited her to record and release a Christmas album, Carey went into detail on what writing and recording the song and album meant for her: [...] "I'm a very festive person and I love the holidays. I've sung Christmas songs since I was a little girl. I used to go Christmas caroling. When it came to the album, we had to have a nice balance between standard Christian hymns and fun songs. It was definitely a priority for me to write at least a few new songs, {{but for the most part}} <b>people</b> <b>really</b> <b>want</b> to hear the standards at Christmas time, no matter how good a new song is." ...|$|E
500|$|Sigourney Weaver has {{expressed}} interest in reuniting with Ridley Scott to revive her character for another Alien film. In the 2003 commentary track for the Alien DVD included in the Alien Quadrilogy set, she and Scott both speculated on the possibility, with Weaver stating: [...] "There is an appetite for a fifth one, which is something I never expected...it's really hard {{to come up with}} a fifth story that's new and fresh...but I have wanted to go back into space...I think outer space adventure is a good thing for us right now, 'cause Earth is so grim...so we've been talking about it, but very generally." [...] Scott remarked that, if the series were to continue, the most logical course would be to explore the origins of the space jockey and the Aliens. Weaver supported this idea, saying [...] "I think it would be great to go back, because I'm asked that question so many times: 'Where did the Alien come from?' <b>People</b> <b>really</b> <b>want</b> to know in a very visceral way." [...] David Giler said that he, Walter Hill, and Gordon Carroll, the producers of the first four films in the series, would not be willing to produce another unless it was about the Aliens' homeworld and Weaver was on board (despite the fact that they were among the producers of Alien vs. Predator films). Weaver, in turn, indicated that she would only return to the franchise if either Scott or James Cameron were to direct. Cameron had been working on a story for a fifth Alien film which would explore the origins of the creatures, but ceased work on it when he learned that Fox was pursuing Alien vs. Predator, which he felt would [...] "kill the validity of the franchise".|$|E

Almendros would stand near the main camera and give instructions to the camera operators. Almendros was gradually losing his sight by the time shooting began. To evaluate his set-ups, [...] "he had one of his assistants take Polaroids of the scene, then examined them through very strong glasses". According to Almendros, Malick wanted [...] "a very visual movie. The story would be told through visuals. Very few <b>people</b> <b>really</b> <b>want</b> to give that priority to image. Usually the director gives priority to the actors and the story, but here the story was told through images".|$|E
5000|$|Reflections from {{athletes and}} {{officials}} provide {{an insight into}} {{the value of this}} inaugural event. Bill Mather-Brown, an Australian athlete, said [...] "The 1962 Games was the first time I had been asked for an autograph. We regarded it as a compliment.

5000|$|In an interview, Powers {{explained}} to The Guardian newspaper why {{he wrote the}} book: [...] "One {{of the reasons that}} I wrote this book was the idea that people kept saying: 'What was it like over there?'

But what <b>people</b> <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> was to know what it felt like; physically, emotionally and psychologically. So that's why I wrote it." ...|$|R

60|$|After all, {{let us be}} just. The uninitiated {{world is}} apt {{to believe that there}} is sometimes, in the {{outskirts}} of fashion, an eagerness, scarcely consistent with self-respect, to enter the mansions of the great. Not at all: few <b>people</b> <b>really</b> <b>want</b> to go to their grand parties. It is not the charms of conversation, the flash of wit or the blaze of beauty, the influential presence of the powerful and celebrated, all the splendour and refinement, which, combined, offer in a polished saloon so much to charm the taste and satisfy the intellect, that the mass of social partisans care anything about. What they want is, not so much to be in her ladyship's house as in her ladyship's list. After the party at Coningsby Castle, our friend, Mrs. Guy Flouncey, at length succeeded in being asked to one of Lady St. Julians' assemblies. It was a great triumph, and Mrs. Guy Flouncey determined {{to make the most of}} it. She was worthy of the occasion. But alas! next morning, though admitted to the rout, Mrs. Guy Flouncey was left out of the list! It was a severe blow! But Mrs. Guy Flouncey is in every list now, and even strikes out names herself. But there never was a woman who advanced with such dexterity.|$|E

[...] She did not plan on using the cherry blossom as a metaphor, but that [...] "the film’s subjects picked up on it as an obvious metaphor anyway". Walker had concerns that she would {{find it difficult to}} conduct interviews as an outsider to the country, but [...] "found <b>people</b> <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> to tell their story.

And House of Margeaux is this creative place that has all these different rooms of things that I create. Like House of Margeaux HOFM is like the gear in one room and then the other room is Tokiebow, this character that I created. He rides a skateboard so I started hand painting skateboards and he's a vinyl robot toy, he's a comic book, T-shirts and hats. And then the other room is music.

5000|$|When Sofia the First {{had first}} launched, {{there was some}} {{confusion}} as to whether Princess Sofia was the first Latina Disney princess or not. This derived from Sofia’s mother, Queen Miranda, appearing to be Hispanic with darker skin and features. This was a false statement made by a producer which has since been disproven by Gerber {{and a few more}} members of the Sofia the First crew. Gerber explains in an interview with ABC news: “What the experience from Sofia showed me was what a demand there was a for a Latina princess,” Gerber said. “That a misstatement that was made by a producer could snowball virally into this announcement that was never made. And Sofia was not Latina and never meant to be the first Latina princess. But it did really illustrate the fact that <b>people</b> <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> a Latina princess, and I think it certainly bubbled in my mind and was part of what inspired me to come up with this idea.” ...|$|R

Nietzsche thinks his notion of the will to power is far more useful than Schopenhauer's will to live for explaining various events, especially human behavior—for example, Nietzsche uses the will to power to explain both ascetic, life-denying impulses and strong, life-affirming impulses in the European tradition, as well as both master and slave morality. He also finds the will to power to offer much richer explanations than utilitarianism's notion that all <b>people</b> <b>really</b> <b>want</b> to be happy, or the Platonist's notion {{that people want to}} be unified with the Good.|$|E
