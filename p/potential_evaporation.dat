40|$|In this study, evaporation, {{drainage}} {{rates and}} water storage of two bare soils {{in the east}} (Batticaloa) and west (Puttalam) regions of Sri Lanka, were simulated using the E-DiGOR model. Daily simulations were carried out {{for each of the}} years during the periods of 1978 to 1987 in Batticaloa and 1998 to 2007 in Puttalam using standard climate data. The soils in the locations were predominantly sandy loam and/or sandy clay loam. Grass reference evapotranspiration and <b>potential</b> soil <b>evaporation</b> were higher, whereas actual soil evaporation was lower during the dry seasons. The 10 -year average annual reference evapotranspiration and <b>potential</b> soil <b>evaporation</b> were 2069. 3 mm and 1814. 1 mm in Batticaloa, and 1908. 8 mm and 1714. 5 mm in Puttalam, respectively. Aridity index (precipitation/reference evapotranspiration) was 0. 685 for Batticaloa and 0. 606 for Puttalam. The actual evaporation from bare soil varied between 463. 1 — 725. 0 mm in Batticaloa and 543. 6 — 646. 3 mm in Puttalam. Annual drainage rates below 150 cm soil depth ranged from 321. 7 to 1581. 2 mm in Batticaloa and from 346. 7 to 957. 0 mm in Puttalam.

40|$|Automated liquid {{handling}} performance can be optimized by adjusting system operating parameters, {{but the effect}} of environmental conditions on liquid handling quality is often under-appreciated. This study uses a two factor design (temperature and humidity) to investigate volumetric performance (precision and trueness) at environmental conditions from 15 ?C to 30 ?C and 30 % to 80 % relative humidity. Nine environmental conditions were tested, the mid point, four corner cases and four edge cases. Replicate testing was performed at the mid point and corner cases. The Tecan QC Kit, {{which is based on}} Artel?s ratiometric photometry, was used to make measurements at each set of environmental conditions. The precision (%CV), and trueness (%SE) is reported for each environmental condition using default liquid classes. The precision of the Tecan Freedom EVO was found to be insensitive to environmental conditions and performed within manufacturer?s limits over the entire range tested in this study (15 ?C to 30 ?C and 30 % to 80 % relative humidity). Over the range of this test, the trueness (systematic error) does depend on environmental conditions. Increased temperature and decreased relative humidity resulted in lower delivered volume. For the greatest accuracy in laboratory work, and particularly when operated outside of recommended temperatures, the automated liquid handling system should be tested and optimized for the local environment. The environmental effect on trueness exhibited a linear correlation with the ?<b>evaporation</b> <b>potential?</b> (the driving force for evaporation of the sample). The <b>evaporation</b> <b>potential</b> is dependent on both temperature and relative humidity.

40|$|Maximizing {{irrigation}} efficiency is of enormous importance for irrigators in the Central Great Plains to conserve water and reduce pumping costs. High temperatures, frequently strong winds and low humidity increase the <b>evaporation</b> <b>potential</b> of water applied through sprinkler irrigation. Thus, many newer sprinkler packages {{have been developed}} to minimize water losses by evaporation and drift. These systems have the <b>potential</b> to reduce <b>evaporation</b> losses as found by Schneider and Howell (1995). Schneider and Howell found that evaporation losses could be reduced by 2 - 3 % as compared to above canopy irrigation. Many producers and irrigation companies have promoted placing sprinklers within the canopy to conserve water by reducing the exposure of the irrigation water to wind. However, runoff losses can increase as the application rate exceeds the soil infiltration capacity with a reduced wetted diameter of the spray pattern within the canopy. Schneider and Howell (2000) found that furrow dikes were necessary to prevent runoff with in-canopy irrigation. In 2003 and 2004, a study was conducted comparing sprinkler nozzle placemen...|$|R
