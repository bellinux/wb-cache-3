50|$|The {{body and}} end are brought {{together}} in a seamer and {{held in place by}} the base <b>plate</b> and <b>chuck,</b> respectively. The base plate provides a sure footing for the can body during the seaming operation and the chuck fits snugly into the end (lid). The result is the countersink of the end sits inside the top of the can body just below the flange. The end curl protrudes slightly beyond the flange.|$|R

The technique {{is based on}} a vacuum chuck concept in which the vacuum chuck simultaneously holds the sample and established electrical contact. The mounting plate is composed of a glass-ceramic insulating material and the surfaces of the <b>plate</b> and vacuum <b>chuck</b> are polished. The operation of the vacuum chuck is examined. The contacts on the sample and mounting plate, which are sputter-deposited through metal masks, are analyzed. The mounting method was utilized for van der Pauw measurements...|$|R
5000|$|Short ribs are {{a cut of}} beef {{taken from}} the brisket, <b>chuck,</b> <b>plate,</b> or rib areas of beef cattle. They consist of a short portion of the rib bone, which is overlain by meat which varies in thickness. There are two major types of cuts: The [...] "flanken", which is cut across the bone and leaves the bone just 1 to 2 in in length, and the [...] "English", which is cut {{parallel}} to the bone and leaves the bone up to 6 in in length. English cut short ribs may be served individually, {{or three or four}} may served connected to one another (a style known as the [...] "plate"). Short ribs are popular in many international cuisines.|$|R
40|$|We {{hypothesized}} that carcass subcutaneous fat location would affect sensory and quality traits. Five carcass fat sources were tested: brisket, <b>chuck,</b> <b>plate,</b> flank, and round. Ground beef was formulated using each fat source and extra-lean beef trim (> 95 % lean) to contain 80 % lean trim and 20 % fat trim. Patties (100 g) were evaluated for color, lipid oxidation, fatty acid composition and consumer evaluation. Flavor was analyzed using a Gas chromatography with mass spectrometry (GC/MS) on the headspace above a cooked (74 degrees C) patty {{in a heated}} (60 degrees C) 473 mL glass jar with a solid phase micro-extraction (SPME) fiber. Color, thiobarbituric acid reactive substance assay (TBARS), consumer sensory, and cook/freezer loss data showed no differences (P > 0. 05) among carcass locations. Percentage stearic acid was lower (P = 0. 044) in the brisket than in the chuck and flank. The brisket was higher in percentage cis-vaccenic acid (P = 0. 016) and in the saturated fatty acid to monounsaturated fatty acid ratio (P = 0. 018), and lower (P = 0. 004) {{in the percentage of}} total saturated fatty acids than all other sources of subcutaneous fat. Butanedione was highest (P = 0. 013) in the flank and plate fat. Brisket tended to be higher (P = 0. 054) than flank, plate, and round in 1 -octen- 3 -ol. Brisket was higher (P = 0. 008) than chuck, flank, and round, but not different (P > 0. 05) than plate in octanedione. Brisket was higher (P = 0. 003) than all other sources for beefy aroma. Flank was higher (P = 0. 047) than chuck and round for chemical aroma. Brisket was higher (P = 0. 004) than all other sources except flank for floral aromas. Plate was higher (P = 0. 029) than all other sources for heated oil aromas. For secondary aroma descriptor, round was higher (P < 0. 001) than flank, <b>plate,</b> and <b>chuck</b> for dairy. While differences in some key fatty acids and aromatics existed among carcass locations, when the fat was diluted with a common lean source, fat source did not {{have a negative effect on}} sensory or quality traits. Therefore, formulating ground beef using subcutaneous fat from specific locations on a carcass may improve the beef aromatics without negatively affecting sensory or quality traits...|$|R
40|$|Accelerated Bridge Construction (ABC) {{utilizing}} precast components {{continues to}} be used as an effective tool for bridge construction due to time and cost saving techniques as well as the reduction of environmental impacts. However, in seismic regions, the use of precast members and ABC methods are limited due to concerns about poor performance of connections primarily between cap beam and girders. With sponsorship from the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans), two alternative connections between precast bulb tee girders and bridge cap were designed utilizing extended girder prestressed strands. The connections were designed to resist positive moments at the girder to cap connection. Positive moments occur at the connection when seismic forces cause upward deflection of the precast girders resulting in tension forces along the bottom of the girder to cap connection. The tension forces cause damage to the connection and can also unseat or disconnect the girders from the cap beam resulting in span collapse. The two connections were designed to minimized connection damage and prevent unseating of the girders. In one connection the extended strands were curved and relied on bond strength for anchorage along the 60 in. embedment length. The other connection consisted of spliced strands with anchor <b>plates</b> and <b>chucks</b> which relied on the transfer of forces through strand splices. Both connections also included three grouted dowel bars placed through the girder web. The connections were designed to provide adequate seismic moment resistance up to a combined load of gravity, horizontal ground acceleration corresponding to the column overstrength moment, as well as shear and moment values up to 0. 5 g vertical acceleration. A 40 % scale test unit was constructed in the Iowa State University structures laboratory and the two connections were tested. An analytical model was formulated to analytically quantify the behavior of each connection. The results of the tests showed that both connections had adequate capacity to resist horizontal and vertical ground acceleration forces as specified in current Caltrans seismic design criteria. Adjustments were made to the analytical model based on results of the test to improve the accuracy of the model. The overall results of the test demonstrate that ABC methods can be safely implemented in high seismic regions and be relied upon for dependable performance...|$|R
5000|$|Koo's {{most memorable}} moment as a Major Leaguer {{occurred}} on May 21, 2005, when he recorded his only major league hit, a double off of Randy Johnson of the New York Yankees. This came right when Fox TV analyst Tim McCarver commented on how Koo's plate appearance was [...] "the biggest give-up at bat". Koo had taken two pitches {{and sat in}} his first at-bat, leading everyone {{to believe that he}} was ready to go up just to sit down again. On a 1-and-1 count, Koo crushed a deep line drive right over Bernie Williams's head one hop of the wall in right-center field. Upon reaching second base, the home crowd and his teammates in the dugout cheered and chanted [...] "KOOOO!" [...] When asked about what he thought about the hit, Koo responded, [...] "Other people say that I swung my bat with my eyes closed. But, of course I saw it -I hit it! It has been 18 years since I batted last - when I was in high school. Occasionally I went to the batting cages and swung the bat a couple of times. But, there really wasn’t any difference." [...] A slow runner with little base running experience, Koo advanced to third base on a sacrifice bunt dropped by the following hitter, José Reyes. However, after Koo slowed down approaching third base, he re-accelerated and ran towards a vacant home plate left uncovered as Reyes was getting thrown out at first base. Yankees' catcher Jorge Posada promptly ran towards home in a foot race with Koo. Upon retrieving the thrown ball from first base, Posada applied the tag onto Koo's left shoulder as he slid head first towards home plate on a close play. Home <b>plate</b> umpire <b>Chuck</b> Meriwether called Koo safe on the play. With that, the home crowd once again cheered and chanted his last name. His teammates enthusiastically greeted him, with celebrations ranging from his teammates brushing the dirt off his uniform to Doug Mientkiewicz fanning him with a towel. On his reception by his teammates, Koo said that [...] "they said a lot of things. I just couldn't understand what. I think they were saying 'Good job.'" [...] It was his final Major League at-bat.|$|R
5000|$|The Alexandra Hills Football Club {{was formed}} in 1980, under the {{original}} name of [...] "The Capalaba Australian rules Football Club" [...] and debuted in the SQAFA 2nd division in 1981. The Club's existence {{is largely due to}} the efforts of a band of staunch original members (who with the backing of clubs, Morningside, Wynnum, and the now defunct Hemmant) survived the initial ten years. Then in 1991 the name was changed all the clubs records with photos were discarded. Thankfully most of the records were rescued by an original member. What happened was the junior side of the club had outgrown the senior side. With the juniors came many ambitious organisers. They, with Judy Holt, conspired the change of the name, & created an illusion of when the club began, but enough original members hung in to filter through the true facts. The real heroes of the club are people such as Dot & Ferris Abell, the Bourke family, Shane Lewis, John Macendoe, John Bonney, Archie Bligh, John Goleby the hard yards players of those initial years, etc., not the johnny come lately, handed everything on a <b>plate</b> parents who <b>chucked</b> the clubs heritage in the bin. This is all true and has to be told because its like a bad luck thing if kept in the dark. [...] Steady improvement saw back to back premierships in 1995 and 1996. They played off for the 1997 second division premiership only to lose to Wilston Grange. After the team play in four Grand Finals in four years the club was promoted to division one in 1998, the club stayed until another restructure of the competition saw them placed in QSFL First Division in 2001.|$|R
40|$|The {{dissertation}} "The Influence of Genotype of Leptin Gene on Qualitative Characteristics of Beef" {{describes the}} effect of polymorphisms of gene of leptin on selected qualitative, morphometric and weight indicators of beef and carcass. The analysis was carried out on 333 bulls of Czech Fleckvieh, which were genotyped (by PCR/RFLP method) of chosen locus. This locus is associated with qualitative changes in beef according to previous foreign studies. The weight of carcass, fore and hind quarter of the right half of the carcass, {{the weight of the}} individual tissues (meat, bone, and fat) and the weight of main meaty parts from the right half of carcass were measured. Before the dissection chosen morphometric indicators were measured. After the dissection, a sample of the musculus longissimus lumborum et thoracis was taken and then analysed in the laboratory. Basic chemical composition (dry matter, fat content, protein, and ash), muscle fibers diameter and fatty acid profile was determined. In addition, pH, added water holding capacity, colour (CIE Lab colour coordinates) were analysed both for one-day post-mortem and after 14 days of ageing. The shear force (using the Warner-Bratzler probe) was evaluated at the same time intervals as for both raw and heat-treated samples by grilling. The studied LEP polymorphism had a statistically significant effect on the weight of the hot carcass, the weight of right half of carcass and fore and hind quarter. LEP polymorphism significantly affected the proportion of meat on the right half of carcass, the weight of the bones and total weight of the I. class meat, and the weight of the I. class meat in the fore quarter. Further, {{the effect of}} LEP polymorphism on the weight of boneless round, boneless <b>chuck,</b> <b>plate,</b> flank, rib, hind shank, and meat trimmings of fore quarter was found. In a group of morphometric indicators, the effect was significant on lengths of round, fullness of round and round circumference. In the case of chemical composition, the effect of LEP polymorphism on the intramuscular fat content was significant. From the qualitative indicators, the effect was significant on the pH value and added water holding capacity, both one-day post-mortem and after 14 days of ageing. In the case of tenderness, the effect on shear force of heat treated, non-aged meat was significant. From the indicators describing colour, a statistically significant effect on the indicator of lightness was found in the case of unconditioned meat and after 14 days of ageing the effect was significant on the indicator characterising yellow colour and the colour saturation. Determination of fatty acid profile was carried out by gas chromatography. The effects of studied polymorphism and differences between LEP genotypes were found in myristic, palmitic, palmitoleic, linoleic, -linolenic, -linolenic, conjugated linoleic, eisocapentaenoic, docosatetraenoic, docosapentaenoic both n- 6 and n- 3 and docosahexaenoic acids. From aggregated indicators, the statistical significant effect of LEP polymorphims on PUFA content, omega- 3 fatty acids content, and omega- 6 /omega- 3 fatty acids ratio was found. In connection with other candidate gene loci influencing the quality of beef, the results of dissertation can be used in the preparation of breeding schemes aimed at the production of quality breeding animals, highlighting the higher quality standards of the produced meat...|$|R
