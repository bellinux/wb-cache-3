50|$|Photogravure is an {{intaglio}} printmaking or <b>photo-mechanical</b> <b>process</b> whereby {{a copper}} plate is {{coated with a}} light-sensitive gelatin tissue which {{had been exposed to}} a film positive, and then etched, resulting in a high quality intaglio print that can reproduce the detail and continuous tones of a photograph.|$|E

50|$|Beedham {{was born}} in 1879 in Whitecross Street, Cripplegate, London, and, {{at the age of}} 13, was apprenticed for six years to an old {{established}} firm of wood engravers, Hare & Company in Essex Street, Strand. By the end of his apprenticeship he found that the skills that he had acquired had been replaced by <b>photo-mechanical</b> <b>processes</b> of reproduction of images.|$|R
50|$|In 1931 {{he joined}} the Institute of Geographical Exploration at Harvard University, where he taught {{cartography}} and was curator of the map collection for 20 years. He created a significant body of work using hand-drawn pen-and-ink techniques, which during that period were largely being replaced by <b>photo-mechanical</b> <b>processes</b> and scribing. Because they were hand-drawn, his maps and graphics have a distinctive look to them, unique to his hand.|$|R
50|$|In 1868, Nettleton {{published}} the first souvenir albums {{for the public}} in Australia. His album {{was made up of}} views of Melbourne that contained 12 photographs. As well as his album, Nettleton designed large album prints of his views of shipping in the mid to late 1880s. These views included The Queen's Wharf, the Drops at Caliban waterworks and the waterworks at Geelong, Malmsbury and Yean Yan. As there was no <b>photo-mechanical</b> printing <b>processes,</b> all of Nettleton's albums are of his real photographs. These albums can be found in libraries and museums in Australia.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{contemporary}} method of continuous tone colour printing {{based upon the}} Nineteenth Century printing process of Woodburytype as developed by Walter Bentley Woodbury in 1865. Woodburytype was the only truly continuous tone printing process yet invented, and died out {{in the late nineteenth}} century as more expedient and cost effective methods of printing prevailed, thus laying the path for current CMYK print technologies. Digital print itself, since its development as a range of colour printing technologies, has followed a route based on the half-tone dot and four colour separation predicated around CMYK. In recent years stochastic algorithms and dithering have allowed the lay down of multiple passes and colour sets to create a near continuous tone image. The downside of this approach is that in order to create a full colour subtractive image, the resultant prints have very little surface topography and a mechanical uniformity that demonstrates none of the surface characteristics, tactile qualities and rich tonal warmth of the 19 th century <b>photo-mechanical</b> <b>processes.</b> Current research at the Centre for Fine Print Research (CFPR) at the University of the West of England, Bristol, is exploring the potential of CNC milled imagery, where the tonal range of each colour is assigned a physical height to produce a continuous tone topographic relief printing matrix, from which the colour image is cast in a silicone ink. A translucent image is cast from each of the colour matrices and each colour is assembled one on top of another resulting in a true four colour separation continuous tone print, where colour tone is created by physical depth of colour...|$|R
40|$|This archive {{contains}} material {{relating to}} the <b>photo-mechanical</b> printing <b>process</b> invented by Walter Woodbury in 1865. Like the collotype process this also {{takes advantage of the}} changing nature of bichromated gelatine after exposure to light to produce a continuous tone print. Unlike the collotype process the bichromated gelatine layer does not form the printing plate. A negative is placed upon a sheet of bichromated gelatine and exposed to a light source, the sheet is then washed to flush out the excess bichromate. Where the light has passed through the negative the gelatine is no longer absorbent but where the negative blocked the light the gelatine will accept the water and swell. After the sheet has been washed it will be seen to have a relief surface, raised in the areas that represent the dark areas in the finished print and flat in the areas that represent the light areas of the print. Once dried, the gelatine sheet is placed on a steel plate in a hydraulic press and a sheet of lead that is half an inch thick and half an inch larger than the layer of gelatine is placed on top. The whole is then placed under pressure, and the relief surface of the gelatine sheet is embossed into the lead. The lead sheet produced forms the printing matrix used to make the print. It is placed face downwards in a press of Woodburyâ€™s invention. A mixture of liquid gelatine and a colouring agent is then poured into the mould, a sheet of paper placed on the surface and the press closed. The press is then left for a few minutes allowing the liquid gelatine to set and adhere to the paper, which is then carefully lifted out of the press and placed in a drying rack. As the gelatine contracts slightly upon drying, causing the paper to curl inwards, these prints had to then be mounted. The archive contains journal articles taken from contemporary photographic journals describing this process and its potential amateur and commercial use as well as describing further refinements to the process. Also included are detailed descriptions of how the process was carried out at two contemporary commercial studios as well as a photographically illustrated description of how the process can be adapted for use in the digital age. This project was funded by an AHRC award for 'A digital archive of the nineteenth century Woodburytype and its working practice'...|$|R
40|$|A conference paper {{presented}} at Networks of Design, 3 - 6 September 2008, University College Falmouth. The design of textual databases to act as archives or information repositories is dependant {{on a number of}} contributory factors which this paper aims to address. The primary consideration is how the information is to be viewed and interrogated by the end user, as this affects both the information collation and the structure of the archive. In order to plan this successfully {{there are a number of}} different agencies; and issues arising from how these agencies interact, to be taken into consideration. The agencies involved include both human and non-human factors which interact forming a single network. The two main non-human factors are the information content, primarily text and images, and the software used in the construction. The methods used in designing and constructing the database will decide the number of human agencies involved, whether the different stages are undertaken by the same individual / group or whether each stage is the responsibility of a different agency. Design in this sense refers to both the aesthetic or visual representation of the user interface and the architecture of the database. This paper will look at the design and construction of a digital archive using the collotype database, designed by the Centre for Fine Print Research, U. W. E. as a case study. This archive holds a variety of technical and contextual historical data relating to the 19 th Century <b>photo-mechanical</b> collotype printing <b>process.</b> Strategies of interaction are built into the architecture of the database to enable the end user to retrieve information. In order for this to occur successfully the data has to be collated and broken down into various sets. Relationships between these sets then have to be mapped to allow access to this content from various routes as different narrative paths are followed...|$|R
