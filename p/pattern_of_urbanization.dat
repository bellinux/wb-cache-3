A number of researchers and writers suggest that suburbanization {{has gone so far}} to form new points of concentration outside the downtown both in developed and developing countries such as India. This networked, poly-centric form of concentration is considered by some emerging <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>urbanization.</b> It is called variously exurbia, edge city (Garreau, 1991), network city (Batten, 1995), or postmodern city (Dear, 2000). Los Angeles is the best-known example of this type of urbanization. Interestingly, in the United States, this process has reversed as of 2011, with [...] "re-urbanization" [...] occurring as suburban flight due to chronically high transport costs.|$|E

Out of these, migrant workers who left their hometown and worked in other provinces accounted for 158.63 million (an increase of 3.4% compared to 2010) and migrant workers who worked within their home provinces reached 94.15 million (an increase of 5.9% compared to 2010). Estimations are that Chinese cities will face an influx of another 243 million migrants by 2025, taking the urban population up to nearly 1 billion people. This population of migrants would represent [...] "almost 40 {{percent of the total}} urban population," [...] a number which is almost three times the current level. While {{it is often difficult to}} collect accurate statistical data on migrant floating populations, the number of migrants is undoubtedly quite large. “In China’s largest cities, for instance, it is often quoted that at least one out of every five persons is a migrant.” China's government influences the <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>urbanization</b> through the Hukou permanent residence registration system, land-sale policies, infrastructure investment and the incentives offered to local government officials.

To assess these impacts and promote urban sustainability, a better understanding <b>of</b> <b>urbanization</b> <b>patterns</b> is needed. Recent studies have suggested several spatiotemporal <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>urbanization,</b> but their generality {{is yet to be}} adequately tested with long-term data. Thus, the main goal of our study was two-fold: (1) to examine the spatiotemporal <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>urbanization</b> <b>of</b> 16 world cities over a period of 200 years (1800 – 2000); and (2) to test four prominent hypotheses <b>of</b> <b>urbanization</b> <b>patterns.</b> Using a set of landscape metrics, we quantified temporal changes in the urban landscape <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> the 16 cities and examined the four hypotheses individually. Our results show that these cities exhibit several common urbanization patterns: the urban landscape becomes compositionally more diverse, structurally more fragmented and geometrically more complex as urbanization progresses. Our study also suggests that urbanization is a process of shifting dominance among three urban growth modes: infilling, edge expanding and leapfrogging. However, idiosyncrasies do exist for individual cities, as detailed attributes <b>of</b> <b>urbanization</b> <b>patterns</b> often depend on the environmental and socioeconomic settings of cities. In addition, the choice of specific landscape metrics and the scales of analysis both influence the urbanization patterns revealed. Our study examined the urbanization patterns, for the first time, on long-term and global scales.

As the largest city in the country, metropolitan Shanghai is now the fastest growing area among all major Chinese cities with more than 13 million residents. Using the GIS-based land use data set of the year 1994 and combining gradient analysis with landscape metrics, we attempted to quantify the spatial <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>urbanization</b> in the Shanghai metropolitan area. The results of transect analysis with class-level metrics showed that the spatial <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>urbanization</b> could be quantified reliably using landscape metrics and different land use types exhibited distinctive, but not necessarily unique, spatial signatures. The results of transect analysis with landscape-level metrics showed that urbanization in the metropolitan Shanghai region has resulted in dramatic increases in patch density (PD), edge density (ED), and patch and landscape shape complexity, and sharp decreases in the largest and mean patch size (MPS), agriculture land use type, and landscape connectivity. The general <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>urbanization</b> was that the increasingly urbanized landscape became compositionally more diverse, geometrically more complex, and ecologically more fragmented. In addition, our results supported the hypotheses that, with increasing urbanization, patch density increases while patch size and landscape connectivity decrease.

The spatial and temporal information on urbanization pattern in the Patna Peninsula is very essential for various planning and development related activities. There was no research undertaken on the <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>urbanization</b> in the Peninsula {{for the last few}} decades. This research has studied the urbanization pattern based on spatial data for the last 50 years compiled from satellite images and Aria! photograph. Medium resolution images of the study area were analyzed to map out the pattern through the techniques of Geographical Information System and Remote Sensing. Supervised classification techniques were used to analyze the images to recognize the spatial <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>urbanization.</b> The recognized pattern of land use changes were analyzed using the techniques of spatial metrics. A dynamic spatial <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>urbanization</b> has been observed in the peripheral areas towns, Jaffna, Chavakachcheri, Nelliyadi, Point Pedro and Chunakam towns and ribbon development along the main transport routes in the Peninsula. Substantial changes in the urbanized area have been prevalent around the Jaffna town which is largest town in the Peninsula. Urbanization took place at a slow growth rate in the 1960 s and 1970 s but has grown rapidly since the 1980 s. Again in 1990 s, the growth rate had declined due to the intensive war centered in the Jaffna Peninsula. There has been significant urban growth in the Peninsula during the last decade {{as a result of the}} political changes in the country. The urbanization process has developed fragmel'lted and heterogeneous land use combinations in the fringe areas of towns in the Peninsula. However, the regeneration process in the city core during the last few years has shown a decreasing trend in the peripheries. The study also shows that the urbanization trend in the Jaffna Peninsula has been causing numerous consequences economically and environmentally.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{describes the}} emergence of a modern urban culture in late nineteeth century Punjab. Transformations in the regional political economy and accelerating <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>urbanization</b> produced a distinctly urban social formation {{in the context of the}} entrenchment of a colonial state apparatus. In response to the dislocations and opportunities created in this period, members of this emerging urban culture created new forms and arenas of public articulation. While assessing the delicate relationship between the colonial political economy and <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>urbanization,</b> this dissertation surveys Punjabi public discourse by analyzing the production, content, use, and circulation of printed materials in the late nineteenth century. The establishment of modern literary production, through newspapers and pamphlets, schools, libraries, sabhas and anjumans, and publishing houses, was a distinguishing characteristic of late nineteenth century urban life. Although the individuals who found a voice continued to participate in pre-colonial forms of literary production, they increasingly engaged in debates over issues of social reform, religious ideology, education, agriculture, the position of women, science, literature, law, and the nature of the state. These processes had a major effect on the construction of social difference, and generated what Anthony Giddens calls 2 ̆ 2 class awareness 2 ̆ 2 (as distinct from 2 ̆ 2 class consciousness 2 ̆ 2) among individuals of the commercial, professional, and reformist groups, all of whom remained inextricably tied to the colonial political economy. Although this urban social formation was internally fragmented, socially heterogenous, and ideologically divided, its distinctiveness lay in the ability of its members to debate, circulate, and institutionalize specific forms of knowledge that became the basis for social change and political mobilizations. These people therefore played a central role in setting the parameters for the debates that accompanied the subsequent articulations of a modern national identity. ...|$|R

Quantifying landscape pattern and its change is essential for the monitoring and as-sessment of ecological consequences of urbanization. Combining gradient analysis with landscape metrics, we attempted to quantify the spatial <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>urbanization</b> in the Phoenix metropolitan area, Arizona, USA. Several landscape metrics were computed along a 165 km long and 15 km wide transect with a moving window. The research was designed to address four research questions: How do different land use types change with distance away from the urban center? Do different land use types have their own unique spatial signatures? Can urban-ization gradients be detected using landscape pattern analysis? How do the urban gradients differ among land-scape metrics? The answers to these questions were generally affirmative and informative. The results showed that the spatial <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>urbanization</b> could be reliably quantified using landscape metrics with a gradient analy-sis approach, and the location of the urbanization center could be identified precisely and consistently with mul-tiple indices.
