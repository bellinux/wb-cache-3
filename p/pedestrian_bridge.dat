40|$|Abstract. With {{coverage}} of municipal transport network, {{more and more}} <b>pedestrian</b> <b>bridges</b> appeared in traffic dense areas of the city, thus well solving the security problems of pedestrians crossing the street. Although at this stage, {{for the construction of}} <b>pedestrian</b> <b>bridges</b> in practical engineering, the traditional reinforced concrete structure still occupied dominant position, a variety of new materials have also been more widely used. This paper mainly discusses the development of materials used in <b>pedestrian</b> <b>bridges...</b>|$|R

5|$|Tracks 1 and 3 are {{connected}} {{to each other and}} to the IRT Lexington Avenue Line's southbound local track south of Grand Central station. Track 4 connects to the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line's northbound local track north of Times Square station. There is no connection between the two tracks that connect to the Lexington Avenue Line, Tracks 1 and 3, and the track that connects to the Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line, Track 4; therefore, it is now physically impossible for a train to go from the IRT Lexington Avenue Line through to the IRT Seventh Avenue Line or vice versa by using the shuttle tracks. At the Times Square station, to provide a connection between the platform for Track 4 and the rest of the station complex, there is a <b>pedestrian</b> <b>bridge</b> over Track 4. The <b>pedestrian</b> <b>bridge</b> is temporary removed to allow the train on Track 4 to leave for maintenance.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 2010, Union Station was {{considered}} a possible site for the National Coast Guard Museum, which would have added a glass atrium north of the main station building {{as well as a}} <b>pedestrian</b> <b>bridge</b> over the tracks to a second waterfront building. The Coast Guard removed the site from consideration in May 2012 due to opposition from Cross Sound Ferry over use of its property. The station's private owners stated that they would consider other uses for the space.|$|E
5|$|However, after further consideration, the Coast Guard {{announced}} in April 2013 {{that the museum}} was to be located at Union Station. The main portion of the museum is to be located east of the tracks, with a new 500-passenger ferry terminal likely integrated into the four-story, 54,300-square-foot glass-faced building. A <b>pedestrian</b> <b>bridge</b> will connect the museum to the station and the northbound platform, {{as well as to}} the Water Street garage.|$|E

5|$|Since then, {{there has}} not been much {{alteration}} to the park's roads. , there are five pedestrian crossings over the Major Deegan Expressway, mostly in the northern section. A sixth bridge near 233rd Street was proposed in a 2009 feasibility study, However, in 2014, plans to build the $7.5 million <b>pedestrian</b> <b>bridge</b> were deferred {{due to a lack of}} money. The next year, the city announced its intent to begin building the bridge at a cost of $12 million.|$|E
5|$|The Nichols Bridgeway, a <b>pedestrian</b> <b>bridge</b> {{that opened}} on May 16, 2009, connects {{the south end}} of Millennium Park with the Modern Wing of the Art Institute of Chicago. The bridge begins at the {{southwest}} end of the Jay Pritzker Pavilion's Great Lawn and extends across Monroe Street, where it connects to {{the third floor of the}} Art Institute's West Pavilion. The bridge design by Renzo Piano, the architect of the Modern Wing, was inspired by the hull of a boat.|$|E
5|$|The first {{station to}} be rebuilt was Old Saybrook, the busy eastern {{terminus}} of the line. The new high-level island platform and <b>pedestrian</b> <b>bridge</b> opened on November 1, 2002. Old Saybrook had previous had only a single side platform serving {{a relatively small number}} of Amtrak trains; the rebuilt has two platforms serving three tracks, to allow Amtrak trains in both directions to stop or pass even while a SLE train is at the station.|$|E

5|$|The route passes beneath another <b>pedestrian</b> <b>bridge</b> and West 5th Street then {{interchanges}} with Upper James Street (former Highway6). It continues, with Upper Wellington Street {{crossing the}} parkway before an interchange with Upper Wentworth Street. On {{the northeast corner}} of this interchange is Lime Ridge Mall, while Thomas B. McQuesten Park lies on the southeast corner. East of these, the route once again lies between subdivisions, with Upper Sherman Avenue crossing the freeway midway to the interchange with Upper Gage Avenue.|$|E
5|$|The {{station is}} fully {{handicapped}} accessible, with two full-length high-level platforms and elevators to cross from one track to another. The overhead <b>pedestrian</b> <b>bridge</b> {{is designed to}} connect to a future deck between Brookline Avenue and Beacon Street {{as part of the}} Fenway Center project. The main entrance to the station is on Overland Street between the two major streets; staircases to Beacon Street are also available from the west ends of the platforms.|$|E
5|$|There {{have also}} been several {{developments}} along the Missouri River waterfront in downtown. The Bob Kerrey <b>Pedestrian</b> <b>Bridge</b> was opened to foot and bicycle traffic on September 28, 2008. Started in 2003, RiverFront Place Condos first phase was completed in 2006 and is fully occupied and the second phase was opened in 2011. The development along Omaha's riverfront is attributed with prompting the City of Council Bluffs to move their own riverfront development time line forward.|$|E

5|$|After Marie Henriette's death, Leopold's {{relationship}} with Caroline became flagrantly open, and he placed her across from his Laeken mansion, in the Villa Vanderborght, even building a <b>pedestrian</b> <b>bridge</b> (above the ground, {{and over the}} fences of the mansion) {{so he could see}} her at will. The bridge reveals the king's jealousy, although this may have been justified, as her former lover Durrieux had been caught with her on several occasions. Caroline tried to pass him off as her brother when Leopold caught the two together; one publication reported that she and Durrieux had placed secret electric bells in all her residences so that servants could warn her when the king was approaching.|$|E
5|$|Beginning on May 24, 2004, {{construction}} of new platforms began at Clinton, Guilford, and Branford. The rebuilt Clinton station opened on July 25, 2005, and the rebuilt Branford station opened on August 8, 2005; both consist of a single high-level platform {{on the south side}} of the tracks. The new Guilford station, which has platforms on both sides of the tracks (connected by a <b>pedestrian</b> <b>bridge)</b> to allow for greater operational flexibility, opened on November 28, 2005. Construction at Madison started on September 24, 2007, and finished with the opening of the rebuilt station platform on July 28, 2008.|$|E
5|$|Further along {{from the}} Welsh Bridge is the Porthill Bridge, a {{pedestrian}} suspension bridge running between the Quarry and Porthill, built in 1922. The next bridge {{along the river}} is Kingsland Bridge, a privately owned toll bridge, and the subsequent bridge is the Greyfriars Bridge, a <b>pedestrian</b> <b>bridge</b> between Coleham and the town centre. Following the Greyfriars Bridge is the English Bridge, historically called Stone Bridge, which was rebuilt in the 1930s. Beyond it is the railway station, which is partly built over the river. After the station is Castle Walk Footbridge, another modern pedestrian footbridge.|$|E

5|$|In March 1994, the {{manufacturing}} buildings were damaged by arson and were subsequently demolished. The site became a town {{park and the}} bridge was anticipated to be rehabilitated {{and serve as a}} <b>pedestrian</b> <b>bridge</b> in the park. The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in April 1999 for being a historically significant example of late 19th-century bridge fabrication and as a surviving example of a bridge built by the Berlin Iron Bridge Company without significant modification or deterioration. It was also locally significant as a remaining artefact of the Ashland Cotton Company, formerly a major employer in the city.|$|E
5|$|In May, {{costs for}} {{construction}} of the station were again increased to $4.1 million. The increased costs were primarily associated with the relocation of fiber optic lines during {{the construction of the}} pedestrian tunnel. To reduce overall costs, village officials asked for architects to remove the tunnel and replace it with an elevated walkway over the tracks. In October 2004, the village board gave final approval to the revised station plan with a <b>pedestrian</b> <b>bridge.</b> The $3.2 million estimated cost of the station was to be financed through a pair of federal transportation grants in addition to the village borrowing against its tax incremental financing district from the adjacent industrial park.|$|E
5|$|Omaha's {{position}} as a transportation center was finalized with the 1872 opening of the Union Pacific Missouri River Bridge linking the transcontinental railroad to the railroads terminating in Council Bluffs. In 1888, the first road bridge, the Douglas Street Bridge, opened. In the 1890s, the Illinois Central drawbridge opened as the largest bridge of its type in the world. Omaha's Missouri River road bridges are now entering their second generation, including the Works Progress Administration-financed South Omaha Bridge, now called Veteran's Memorial Bridge, which {{was added to the}} National Register of Historic Places. In 2006, Omaha and Council Bluffs announced joint plans to build the Missouri River <b>Pedestrian</b> <b>Bridge,</b> which opened in 2008.|$|E
