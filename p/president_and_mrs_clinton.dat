50|$|As {{editor of}} Self magazine, Penney succeeded the founder, Phyllis Starr, {{who died of}} breast cancer. Wanting {{to pay tribute to}} Starr and knowing that breast cancer was nationally underfunded, Penney, working with Nancy Smith, the {{executive}} editor of Self, created the first pink ribbon with SI Newhouse Jr's, (owner of Conde Nast), permission. At a meeting {{on the same day that}} the ribbon was created, she called Evelyn Lauder, a friend and breast cancer survivor, to edit the first breast cancer issue of Self and to ask for her help in getting the pink ribbon to Estee Lauder customers. Lauder, then Sr VP of Estee Lauder, immediately responded positively and began to take the pink ribbon global through Estee Lauder sales counters. Lauder and Penney worked tirelessly to popularize the ribbon through the magazine and through the Breast Cancer Research Foundation, which was founded by Lauder. Both Penney and Lauder were commended at the White House by <b>President</b> <b>and</b> <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Anick started {{classical}} violin {{lessons at}} age six {{but it was}} the summers spent learning fiddle tunes from his father that trained his ear and liberated him early on from the printed page. He was eleven when he met Stephane Grappelli and twelve when he fiddled for <b>President</b> <b>and</b> <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Clinton</b> when they showed up at a fiddle showcase on Martha's Vineyard. In junior high school, he took a detour and started a rock band on guitar, but videos of European Gypsy jazz players piqued a renewed fascination with the violin - and a passion for jazz. He entered the unique [...] "acoustics and music" [...] program at the University of Hartford, combining an engineering degree with music performance studies at the Jackie McLean Institute of Jazz, part of the Hartt School. There he worked with the likes of trombonist Steve Davis and bassist Nat Reeves to hone his straight-ahead and bebop chops. He was still attending college when guitarist John Jorgenson invited him to join his Quintet, having seen a YouTube video of Anick playing at the Montreal Jazz Festival with the Robin Nolan Trio. Anick managed to complete school while touring with Jorgenson, beginning a professional relationship that has lasted for six years. The apprenticeship allowed him to hone his improvisational skills and stage presence while earning him {{a reputation as one of}} the top Gypsy jazz/world music violinists on the scene today. He has recorded one CD with the John Jorgenson Quintet, One Stolen Night.|$|E
40|$|The {{nation has}} {{undergone}} a watershed change in examining health insurance {{on a national level}} in the past two years. Many American Presidents since World War II have tried to influence the growth of health care in America. <b>President</b> <b>and</b> <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Clinton</b> made the strongest attempt to bring about change since the Truman Era. Credibility issues surrounding costs, the spectre of government waste and control, divided opinions among the electorate, and strong political partisanship resulted in a legislative impasse. Modest market-based changes at the state level may come about over the next several years. The problem of educating young people concerning the pertinent issues in national health care policy and encouraging their involvement as citizens and employees is being addressed in management education at Cal Poly and other universities across the country...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} relay {{selection}} schemes in mobile communication system over Nakagami-m channel. To make {{efficient use of}} licensed spectrum, both single relay selection (SRS) scheme <b>and</b> multirelays selection (<b>MRS)</b> scheme over the Nakagami-m channel are proposed. Also, the intercept probability (IP) and outage probability (OP) of the proposed SRS <b>and</b> <b>MRS</b> for the communication links depending on realistic spectrum sensing are derived. Furthermore, this paper assesses the manifestation of conventional direct transmission scheme to compare with the proposed SRS <b>and</b> <b>MRS</b> ones based on the Nakagami-m channel, and the security-reliability trade-off (SRT) performance of the proposed schemes and the conventional schemes is well investigated. Additionally, the SRT of the proposed SRS <b>and</b> <b>MRS</b> schemes is demonstrated better than that of direct transmission scheme over the Nakagami-m channel, which can protect the communication transmissions against eavesdropping attacks. Additionally, simulation results show that our proposed relay selection schemes achieve better SRT performance than that of conventional direct transmission over the Nakagami-m channel...|$|R
