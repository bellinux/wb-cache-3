30|$|Lesson 6 is {{that the}} short run effect of {{austerity}} on the <b>public</b> <b>debt</b> <b>ratio</b> and in extreme cases also on the deficit might well be upward.

If consumption was above its steady state level (as {{in the case of}} GIPSI countries), then reallocation of employment is necessary anyway. However, even then there is a point beyond which further austerity leads to excessive overshooting. A similar reasoning applies to the level of public debt. The short run effect of austerity might well be to increase public debt.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Fiscal {{consolidation}} is {{the implementation}} of policies to reduce government expenditures and the <b>public</b> <b>debt</b> <b>ratio</b> to GDP. These policies are used to ensure fiscal discipline and minimize the debt stock by either tax or expenditure side. In this respect, the importance of fiscal consolidation policy is to ensure fiscal discipline without making negative effects on economic growth and economic life. Besides the conceptual framework, periods and the success criteria of fiscal consolidation are important factors for evaluating {{the success or failure}} of fiscal consolidation. In this study, it has been identified that there is no consensus on these criteria in the literature.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{evolution}} of the public debt to GDP ratio during 40 fiscal consolidation episodes in 21 OECD countries in 1980 - 2008. We test within a multivariate regression framework seven hypotheses put forward in the literature on {{the success or failure of}} consolidation programmes. These hypotheses concern (i) the composition of the consolidation programme, (ii) its size and persistence, (iii) the gravity of the debt situation, (iv) the influence of the international macroeconomic environment, (v) the role of labour and product market institutions and institutional reform, (vi) the ideological orientation of the government, and (vii) the role of strict fiscal rules. We add a new hypothesis emphasizing the influence of public sector efficiency. We also improve on the literature methodologically by controlling for one-off budgetary measures. Consolidation programmes imply a stronger reduction of the <b>public</b> <b>debt</b> <b>ratio</b> when they mainly rely on spending cuts (except public investment), are large but of short duration, take place when growth in the international economy is high and interest rates are low, are accompanied by product market deregulation, are adopted by left-wing governments, are embedded in a regime of strict and wide fiscal rules, and are executed by highly efficient administrations. Public sector efficiency is important also for the composition hypothesis. Government wage bill cuts do not contribute to lower public debt ratios when public sector efficiency is high. On the hypothesis that consolidation is more likely to succeed in a situation of fiscal emergency, our evidence is mixed. Finally, we find no evidence that labour market deregulation contributes to a reduction of the <b>public</b> <b>debt</b> <b>ratio</b> during consolidation periods. public debt, fiscal consolidation, fiscal policy composition, fiscal rules, labour and product market institutions, government efficiency...|$|E

40|$|Surging <b>public</b> <b>debt</b> {{since the}} Great Recession has focused {{increasing}} {{attention on the}} issue of debt sustainability. This paper provides debt sustainability analyses for the Czech Republic and Slovakia by estimating their <b>public</b> <b>debt</b> to GDP, and primary balance to GDP ratios up until 2022 under three different projections. The first, labelled the baseline projection, predicts their <b>debt</b> <b>ratios</b> to 2022, if neither their <b>public</b> <b>debt</b> to GDP <b>ratios</b> nor their primary balance to GDP ratios change. This projection uses the official forecasts of the key variables. The second projection answers the question of how much the two counties have to consolidate, measured by their primary balance to GDP ratios, if they want to hold their <b>public</b> <b>debt</b> to GDP <b>ratios</b> at their current levels. The third projection answers the question of how much the countries have to consolidate if they aim to reattain their December 2008 pre-crisis <b>public</b> <b>debt</b> to GDP <b>ratios.</b> All three projections are made for the same five scenarios, which cover a status quo case, where official forecasts are realized, and both optimistic and pessimistic scenarios for growth and consolidation outcomes.
