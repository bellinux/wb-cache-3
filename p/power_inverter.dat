25|$|The {{internal}} circuits of most electroshock {{weapons are}} fairly simple, based on either an oscillator, resonant circuit (a <b>power</b> <b>inverter),</b> and step-up transformer or a diode-capacitor voltage multiplier {{to achieve an}} alternating high-voltage discharge or a continuous direct-current discharge. It may be powered {{by one or more}} batteries depending on manufacturer and model. The amount of amperage generated depends on what stunning capabilities are desired, but without proper amperage calculations, the cause and effect of high voltage is muted. Output voltage is claimed to be in the range of 100 V up to 6 KV; current intensity output is claimed to be in the range of 100 to 500 mA; individual impulse duration is claimed to be in the range of 10 to 100 µs (microseconds); frequency of impulse is claimed to be in the range of 2 to 40 Hz; electrical charge delivered is claimed to be in the range of 15 to 500 µC (micro-Coulomb); energy delivered is claimed to be in the range of 0.9 to 10 J.|$|E
25|$|In {{second half}} of 2008 the Solaris Urbino 18 Hybrid model went through several levels of {{modernisation}} {{and now it is}} considered to be at the second generation by the producer. Most of the changes are that of the power system of the electric hybrid engine, making a smaller and lighter engine, the Cummins ISBe5 250B with a volume of 6.7litre and the power of 178kW. The changes meant even lower fuel consumption - the older engine has reduced fuel usage by 15% compared to purely diesel propulsion while the new engine saves 23-24%. Thanks to further optimisation the Solaris is planning to reduce fuel consumption by 30%. Due to a lighter engine, the other power systems, like the batteries and Dual <b>Power</b> <b>Inverter</b> Module which are on the roof, work at an increased rate and produce more power. Due to this the model has also undergone a makeover of the general body, such as the aerodynamics, meaning only an air conditioning module can be fitted {{on the front of the}} bus. The estimated time for future modernisation, when new modules will be able to be added, is said to be about in 6–7 years, with an average usage of 60000km per year.|$|E

The Ev system looks like an ordinary transmission where the torque summation of {{the internal combustion engine}} and the electric motor is performed. It consists of two electric motors, two synchronous clutches and three planetary gears. Rechargeable nickel-metal hydride batteries [...] weighing 410kg store energy recovered during the braking process. By this they do not require additional charging from external power sources. The service life of the battery set is about 6 years depending on the characteristics of the bus. Dual inverter module DPIM (Dual <b>Power</b> <b>Inverter</b> Module) consists of two modules of AC/DC - DC/AC weighing 75kg in total. It is cooled with oil. The control unit consists of 2 control modules of the Allison 1000/2000 series. The first of these controls manage the operation of the hybrid engine, while the second unit is responsible for cooperation of the other vehicle systems.|$|E
