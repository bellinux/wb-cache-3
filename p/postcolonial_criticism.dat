I focused on Jean Rhys's famous novel Wide Sargasso Sea, which has often been examined through a postcolonial approach.

Folklore has allowed me to explore the novel from a wider spectrum because it provides a deeper understanding of the characters, their identities, places, and dreams in the novel. Folklore not only studies the individuals and their societies, but also goes beyond the stereotypes and generalizations.   M. A...|$|R

This article attempts to understand this reluctance, recognising that some of the unfamiliar feel of the discourse stems from the dominance of diasporal sites in its ongoing theorisation, some from its tendency to reify, commodify, and consume anything home-grown and local, some from its failure to envisage a clear liberation project, and some from the way in which postcolonial analysis has been projected back into ancient biblical contexts, and in so doing diminishing current contexts of actual postcolonial contestation. 1...|$|R
40|$|This thesis investigates four utopias, Plato’s Republic, Sir Thomas More’s Utopia, Edward Bellamy’s Looking Backward, and H. G. Wells’s A Modern Utopia, in {{relation}} to <b>postcolonial</b> <b>criticisms</b> that present them as outlining ostensibly ‘universal’ values and as being inherently colonial, expansionist, and imperialist. This critique is often applied to the utopian genre as a whole, yet while widespread and popular, it is often {{in contrast with the}} ideas contained and measures proposed within the texts. In fact, a close reading shows that they resist such generalisations. The key themes investigated in each of these texts are: how they characterise their utopian people; how they construct their utopias physically; how they manage them in terms of education, law, family, and economics; how they imagine and map their boundaries; and, finally, how they view and interact with the ‘other’ – the non-utopian. These four canonical texts often outline philosophies and proposals intended for the benefit of humanity as a whole, which might be misinterpreted by some as imperialist in intent. It will be argued, however, that there is also a strong but under-recognised tendency within them not to expand, conquer, and incorporate, as commonly thought, but instead to withdraw and contract, a dynamic of non-interference. Along the way, {{it will be necessary to}} negotiate the difficult, slippery status of these texts, about which the reader is never fully clear whether they were intended to be taken as literal blueprints for real future societies, as non-committal thought-experiments, or as ‘mere’ literary entertainments...|$|R

Teachers mainly use traditional reading strategies, therefore, they are not aware of, for example, Eurocentric biases which can be examined only by using <b>postcolonial</b> literary <b>criticism.</b> As a result, these teachers are not able to encourage their students to admit uncritically challenging representations of various cultural groups as they encounter these representations in their literary texts. Thus, teachers by using the postcolonial literary theory will lead their students to understand more effectively the representations of dominant and subaltern cultures to be found in both Eurocentric and postcolonial literary texts, and will achieve higher levels of multicultural literacy, which makes them more effective intercultural communicators...|$|R

50|$|Gerry Smyth (14 September 1961) is an academic, {{actor and}} {{musician}} from Dublin, Ireland. He {{works in the}} Department of English at Liverpool John Moores University. His early publications were mainly {{in the field of}} Irish literature, although since 2002 he has also written widely on the subject of Irish music. Smyth was an early advocate of <b>postcolonial</b> <b>criticism</b> in Irish Studies, although more recently he has been keen to emphasise the autobiographical dimension of critical discourse. Decolonisation and Criticism won the American Conference for Irish Studies' Michael J. Durkan Prize for best book published in literary criticism, arts criticism or cultural studies in 1999. Beautiful Day: Forty Years of Irish Rock (co-authored with Sean Campbell) was launched in the Clarence Hotel in Dublin in September 2005. Our House: The Representation of Domestic Space in Contemporary Culture (co-edited with Jo Croft) was launched at the Tate Liverpool in September 2006. His collection of critical essays Music in Irish Cultural History also won the Michael J. Durkan Prize (2009). Smyth has lectured throughout Europe and the United States on various aspects of Irish culture. In September / October 2006 he was Academic-in-Residence at the Princess Grace Irish Library in Monaco. He was appointed Visiting Professor of Irish Studies at the University of Vienna between October 2010 and February 2011.Smyth's latest book is The Judas Kiss: Treason and Betrayal in Six Modern Irish Novels (Manchester University Press, 2015), and includes analyses of work by James Joyce, Liam O'Flaherty, Elizabeth Bowen, Francis Stuart, and Anne Enright.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{approaches the}} work of South African/Botswanan novelist Bessie Head, especially the novel A Question of Power, as positioned within the critical framework of the postcolonial paradigm, the genius of which accommodates both African and African American literature without recourse to racial essentialism.

A key contested concept is that of universality, which has been widely regarded as a witting or unwitting tool of the metropolis, having the effect of denigrating the colonial subject. It is my thesis that Bessie Head, neither entirely collusive nor oppositional, advocates an Africanist universality that paradoxically eliminates the bias implicit in metropolitan universality...|$|R

40|$|This new {{collection}} places {{the short story}} {{at the heart of}} contemporary postcolonial studies. In so doing, it also questions what <b>postcolonial</b> literary <b>criticism</b> may be. Focusing upon short fiction from 1975 to the present day – the period during which critical theory came to determine postcolonial studies – it argues for a more sophisticated critique exemplified by the ambiguity of the short story form. Short fiction is discussed from India, New Zealand, Singapore, North America, the UK, Egypt, the Caribbean and Africa. Themes include trauma, diaspora, language, national identity, democracy, the city, women's writing, the body, sexuality, and new media. Canonical figures such as Alice Munro are featured alongside emerging talents such as Jhumpa Lahiri and Wena Poon, genre writers such as Nalo Hopkinson, and writers new to an Anglophone or Western audience. The contributors, too, include established figures in postcolonial and short story criticism alongside new or emerging scholars. ...|$|R

It combines partnership epistemological models with <b>postcolonial</b> literary <b>criticism,</b> thus creating methodological connections with non-binary and inter/multi-disciplinary cultural paradigms. Its main focus of attention is on the 'archetypical' sources of texts, especially in relation to stories or 'narrations' related to the Goddess figure, metaphor of a more caring and eco-sustainable vision of life. The book investigates the persistence of the ancient Triune Goddess and of other feminine archetypes, prototypical energy present in our past and present traditions, in two periods regarded as specular and conceptually linked: contemporary literatures in English (Australian, Indian, Canadian, South African, West-Indian) and Renaissance/Late Renaissance British literature. The awakening of the Goddess is also celebrated in the arts: poetry, drama, narrative, dance, and a photographic and sculptural exhibition of the Sacred Feminine, which can be enjoyed both in the book itself and in the two accompanying DVDs...|$|R

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I {{investigate}} and problematize the historical {{location of the}} term 'religion' and examine how this location has affected the analytical reading of postcolonial fiction and poetry. The term 'religion' has been developed {{in response to a}} Western Enlightenment and Christian history and its adoption outside of this context should therefore be treated with caution. Within <b>postcolonial</b> literary <b>criticism,</b> there has been either a silencing of the category {{as a result of this}} caution or an uncritical and essentialising adoption of the term 'religion'. I argue that a vital aspect of how writers articulate their histories of colonial contact, migration, slavery and the re-forging of identities in the wake of these histories is illuminated by the classificatory term 'religion'. I demonstrate this through the close reading of Guyanese fiction and poetry, as critical themes are seen and discussed that would be otherwise ignored. Aspects of postcolonial theory and Religious Studies theory are combined to provide a new insight into the literature and therefore expand the field of <b>postcolonial</b> literary <b>criticism.</b> The way in which writers 'remember' history through writing is central to the way in which I theorize and articulate 'religion' throughout the thesis; the act of remembrance is persuasively interpreted in terms of 'religion'. The title 'Memory and Myth' therefore refers to both the syncretic mythology of Guyana, and the key themes in a new critical understanding of 'religion'. Chapter One establishes the theoretical framework to be adopted throughout the thesis by engaging with key developments made in the past decade by Religious Studies theorists. Through this dialogue, I establish a working definition of the category religion whilst being aware of its limitations, particularly within a discussion of postcolonial literature. I challenge the reluctance often shown by postcolonial theorists in their adoption of the term `religion' and offer an explanation for this reluctance. Chapter Two attends to the problems involved in carrying out interdisciplinary research, whilst demonstrating the necessity for such an enquiry. Chapters Three, Four and Five focus on selected Guyanese writers and poets and demonstrate the illuminating effect of a critical reading of the term 'religion' for the analysis of postcolonial fiction and poetry. Chapter Three provides a close reading of Wilson Harris's novel Jonestown alongside theoretical and historical material on the actual Jonestown tragedy. Chapter Four examines the mesmerising effect of the Anancy tales on contemporary writers, particularly poet John Agard. And Chapter Five engages with the work of Indo-Guyanese writer, David Dabydeen and his elusive character Manu...|$|R

40|$|This thesis explores textual {{and visual}} {{representations}} of the military prostitution during the Occupation in Japan, the pan pan girl. Many works on representations of pan pan girls in postwar literature and film interpret the pan pan girl {{as a symbol of}} Japan’s defeat and the trauma of the Allied Occupation. Nevertheless, these popular interpretations fail {{to take into account the}} way that the figure of the pan pan girl revealed, for both the U. S. and Japan, a tenuous politics of race and sexuality that often dismantles an accepted narrative about the Occupation and the postwar. The pan pan girl, I will argue, is a figure that acts as a point of attachment for a collective fantasy on racial and gender relations during the immediate postwar. My discursive analysis looks to explain the components of what I see as a rhetorical crossroads in the framings of sex and race not only in fictional representation, but also in the context of academic representation. An inquiry into the possibility of understanding representation beyond national concepts of the figure of the pan pan, “Akarui Uncanny” draws from concepts and theories in psychoanalysis, trauma studies, translation studies, and <b>postcolonial</b> feminist <b>criticism</b> to develop upon narratives and analyses of representations of postwar military prostitution. 2019 - 05 - 2...|$|R
