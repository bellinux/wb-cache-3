As New York City continued to expand, many proposals were made to link The Bronx with Westchester County, hoping to capitalize on increasing real estate values. Banking that the city would continue to grow northward, the New York, Westchester and Boston Railway Company developed new lines of service to serve the large populations moving to the suburbs. Two main lines were built as part of the NYW, the Port Chester line and the White <b>Plains</b> <b>line.</b> The Port Chester Line ran along the same route as the New York Railroads New Haven line which remains in service today.

This was the final conclusion of a three-stage development that began in 2002. The project was set for 24 months and required the installation of 36 new point ends of switches and crossings, the recovery and plain lining of 37 switch and crossings units, installation of significant lengths of <b>plain</b> <b>line</b> track, signalling mechanical installations, design and erection of 100 new overhead line (OLE) structures, and 19 km of new OLE conductors. This new upgrade would allow Network Rail to increase its line speeds and capacity enhancements between Euston and Glasgow. The project was completed in 2008.|$|E
5000|$|Winchester Chesil {{station was}} chosen for an {{innovative}} system of signalling, developed in about 1923 by L M G Ferreira of Siemens Brothers and Co Ltd and R J Insell of the GWR. A route setting frame was installed, with miniature levers: the frame was small, measuring 2 ft 10 in by 2 ft 4 in (863 mm by 711 mm). It was a forerunner of the one control switch system; the levers set up routes; when the lever was moved to mid-stroke the interlocking proved that the route was free and no conflicting move had been set up; and the points moved to the required position, after which the lever could be moved to the reverse position and the signal cleared. There were 16 miniature levers and 15 routes could be selected; the sixteenth was a king lever. The points were operated by a 120-volt supply from the signal box. Track circuits were provided at the points: they were described as [...] "point protection tracks", that is, route locking track circuits, {{but there were no}} track circuits in the <b>plain</b> <b>line.</b> The night illumination was provided by oil lamps except for two signals located in the tunnel; ground signals were miniature semaphores of novel design.|$|E
5000|$|Ernest Scott, first Professor of History at the University of Melbourne, {{wrote on}} the {{significance}} of Dieppe Maps in several books between 1916 and 1929. He argued that while intriguing, the Dieppe maps alone could not be accepted as evidence the Portuguese had a knowledge of Australia in the 16th century. In the Introduction to Australian Discovery by Sea, Scott explained that the Dieppe mapmaker Desceliers had: [...] "connected up Java with Ptolemy's imaginary outline of Terra Incognita, and also with {{the outline of the}} land which Magellan saw to the south of him when he sailed through his strait in 1520. But in so doing he played tricks with Ptolemy's frank confession of ignorance. He did not like the look of Ptolemy's <b>plain</b> <b>line,</b> so he serrated it. He actually attributed names to the teeth of the saw as if they were real capes, and showed rivers flowing into the gaps between. He produced a pretty and mysterious-looking map, which geographically was a hoax. There is no land where Desceliers marked those capes and streams. There is no continent stretching from Java to South America on the one side and to the south of Africa on the other. In joining up Java with Ptolemy's line he necessarily covered the area where the real continent of Australia was, and accidentally produced a certain delusive resemblance to part of the outline of that land. Desceliers' map does not prove that up to this date any navigator had seen any portion of Australia".|$|E

40|$|Objectives: The {{principal}} objective {{of a healthy}} living environment {{is to improve the}} quality of everyday life. Visually impaired persons (VIPs) encounter many difficulties in everyday life through a series of barriers, particularly in relation to public toilets. This study aimed to explore the concerns of VIPs in accessing public toilets, and identify methods for improvement. Considerations about user participation are also discussed. Study design: Adopting a case study approach, VIPs were invited to participate in the research process. Methods: In addition to in-depth interviews and field visits, models and a simulated full-scale environment were produced to facilitate the VIPs to voice their opinions. Results: The key findings indicate that the design of public toilets for promoting public health should be considered and tackled from a three-level framework: <b>plain,</b> <b>line</b> and point. Governments, professionals and the public need to consider the quality of public toilets in terms of policy, implementation and management. Conclusions: VIPs have the right to access public toilets. Governments and professionals should respect the particular needs and concerns of VIPs. A three-level framework (<b>plain,</b> <b>line</b> and point) is required to consider the needs of VIPs in accessing public toilets, and user participation is a good way to reveal the actual needs of VIPs.
