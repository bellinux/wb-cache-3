40|$|The {{mechanical}} {{behavior and}} fragmentation response of rock materials is investigated in this work. In particular, Bohus granite is selected with application to <b>percussive</b> <b>drilling.</b> It {{is well known}} that rock behaves totally different in compression and tension and dynamic loading conditions and high strain rates under the <b>percussive</b> <b>drilling</b> process makes the material behavior even more complicated. The KST-DFH material model is shown in this work to be appropriate in order to constitutively describe granite at dynamic fragmentation. It consists of a plasticity model in compression and a damage model in tension. The yield surface locus is a quadratic function of the mean pressure in the principal stress space and the damage model is anisotropic. Several experiments are performed in order to define the mechanical behavior and dynamic response of granite and calibrate the KST-DFH model parameters for this material. The material model is implemented as in a commercial finite element program and validated based on dynamic tests such as Edge-on Impact (EOI) and spalling test using Hopkinson bar. The numerical tool is then used to model the rock response during the <b>percussive</b> <b>drilling</b> process. In doing so, only one spherical tool button and just the first impact are considered for simplicity. The anticipated fracture mechanism in <b>percussive</b> <b>drilling</b> is captured and the penetration stiffness obtained is in agreement with practical drilling experiments. In paper A, the experimental work is described and the granite mechanical response is explained. In particular, the influence from pre-existing cracks and defects is examined in great detail. In paper B, the experimental results are used to calibrate the material model parameters. The numerical tool discussed earlier is employed to investigate the rock fracture mechanisms at <b>percussive</b> <b>drilling.</b> In paper C, the effect of pre-existing, or structural, cracks on dynamic fragmentation of granite is investigated in detail. These cracks may be the result from former impact of the drill bit, or by means of other unconventional methods such as microwave and laser that are used to increase the effectiveness of the <b>percussive</b> <b>drilling</b> process. In paper D, the dynamic tensile behavior of granite samples is investigated. Spalling tests using a Hopkinson bar are performed and a strain rate of order 102 1 /s is obtained. This experimental technique involves the same order of strain rate as present in rock materials during <b>percussive</b> <b>drilling.</b> A dynamic tensile strength of 18. 9 MPa is obtained at a strain rate of 70 1 /s. This is more than twice the tensile strength of the specimen (with the same size) at quasi-static conditions, which is 8 MPa. QC 20150212 </p...|$|E

40|$|The need to {{maintain}} optimal energy efficiency is critical during the drilling operations performed on future and current planetary rover missions (see figure). Specifically, this innovation seeks to solve the following problem. Given a spring-loaded <b>percussive</b> <b>drill</b> driven by a voice-coil motor, one needs to determine the optimal input voltage waveform (periodic function) and the optimal hammering period that minimizes the dissipated energy, while ensuring that the hammer-to-rock impacts are made with sufficient (user-defined) impact velocity (or impact energy). To solve this problem, it was first observed that when voice-coil-actuated <b>percussive</b> <b>drills</b> are driven at high power, it {{is of paramount importance}} to ensure that the electrical current of the device remains in phase with the velocity of the hammer. Otherwise, negative work is performed and the drill experiences a loss of performance (i. e., reduced impact energy) and an increase in Joule heating (i. e., reduction in energy efficiency). This observation has motivated many drilling products to incorporate the standard bang-bang control approach for driving their <b>percussive</b> <b>drills.</b> However, the bang-bang control approach is significantly less efficient than the optimal energy-efficient control approach solved herein. To obtain this solution, the standard tools of classical optimal control theory were applied. It is worth noting that these tools inherently require the solution of a two-point boundary value problem (TPBVP), i. e., a system of differential equations where half the equations have unknown boundary conditions. Typically, the TPBVP is impossible to solve analytically for high-dimensional dynamic systems. However, for the case of the spring-loaded vibro-impactor, this approach yields the exact optimal control solution as the sum of four analytic functions whose coefficients are determined using a simple, easy-to-implement algorithm. Once the optimal control waveform is determined, it can be used optimally in the context of both open-loop and closed-loop control modes (using standard realtime control hardware) ...|$|R

40|$|An {{in-depth}} look at <b>percussive</b> <b>drilling</b> {{shows that}} the transmission efficiency is very important; however, data for <b>percussive</b> <b>drilling</b> in hard rock or permafrost is rarely available or the existing data are very old. Transmission efficiency {{can be used as}} a measurement of the transmission of the energy in the piston to the drill steel or bit and from the bit to the rock. Having a plane and centralized impact of the piston on the drill steel can optimize the transmission efficiency from the piston to the drill steel. A transmission efficiency of near 100 % between piston and drill steel is possible. The transmission efficiency between bit and rock is dependent upon the interaction within the entire system. The main factors influencing this transmission efficiency are the contact area between cutting structure and surrounding rock (energy loss due to friction heat), damping characteristics of the surrounding rock (energy dampening), and cuttings transport. Some of these parameters are not controllable. To solve the existing void regarding available drilling data, an experiment for gathering energy data in permafrost for <b>percussive</b> <b>drilling</b> was designed.

40|$|The {{influence}} of springy impact interface and of curved drill rods on energy transfer in <b>percussive</b> rock <b>drilling</b> was studied. Analytical models for pneumatic and hydraulic rock drills were introduced, {{in which the}} springy piston-rod impact interface was taken into account. A nonlinear model for the springy impact interface was also implemented in a computer simulation program for <b>percussive</b> rock <b>drilling</b> systems. Laboratory tests were performed and the experimental results were compared with the results by three theoretical models. The agreement between theoretical and experimental incident stress waves {{was found to be}} satisfactory. The factors affecting the rock drilling efficiency were analysed. For the hydraulic rock drills investigated, it was found that a springy impact interface slightly decreases the drilling efficiency. For pneumatic rock drills, however, the analysis showed that an appropriate springy impact interface might increase the drilling efficiency significantly. The reflection and transmission of harmonic stress waves at a constant curvature bend of an ilifinite uniform bar was analysed theoretically. The energy fluxes of the reflected and transmitted extensional and flexural waves were obtained for an incident wave which may be either extensional or flexural. Results are shown in polar radiation diagrams for an incident extensional wave. It was found that for bends of small angles, the radius of curvature has little effect on the transmission of extensional stress waves and a significant amount of extensional wave energy is transmitted through the bends. Furthermore, the efficiency of <b>percussive</b> rock <b>drilling</b> with a bent drill rod was investigated using a combined approach of FFT and matrix method. In <b>percussive</b> rock <b>drilling</b> with slightly bent rods (bend angle up to 100), {{it was found that the}} efficiency is practically the same as with straight rods.

The bit usually recovers from the stroke by means of a spring. The earliest form of a jackhammer, a [...] "percussion drill" [...] was invented in 1848 and patented in 1849 by Jonathan J.

At the same time the oil prize has been highly unstable resulting in an increased focus on reducing drilling costs. The aim of this thesis is to look for cost reducing measures when drilling in hard rock formations offshore. Drilling in hard formations is both challenging and time consuming as a consequence of Low Rate of Penetration (ROP) and high None Productive Time (NPT). Typically hard rock stones encountered offshore are limestone, basalt, chart and chalk which for instance {{can be found in the}} NCS, on Iceland and offshore Faroe Islands. This thesis presents: •	The status of the current drilling technologies and its potential while identifying the current problems experienced when drilling in hard rocks. •	Mitigation for hard rock drilling problems •	Development of a procedure that can be used for planning wells offshore with aim to reduce cost •	Case study of the procedure with a well from the NCS The developed procedure is based on analysis of old well and when planning new well.

Drilling and planetary soil/rock sample acquisition provides information about history of past events, minerals and chemical composition of the soil/rock of the planetary body, available resources for future manned missions and the mechanical behavior of the planetary soil/rock. Several types of drilling devices have been proposed for lunar, Mars, and planetary subsurface exploration. However, these devices have limitations (e. g. heavy equipment and need for large axial force) {{that need to be}} addressed in order to be feasible for extraterrestrial bodies’ exploration. A special type of ultrasonic <b>percussive</b> <b>drill</b> have been proposed by Honeybee Spacecraft Mechanisms Corporation and NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) to address the limitations of current drilling devices. In this study, the mechanical system of the ultrasonic <b>percussive</b> <b>drill</b> and its interaction with the supporting medium is studied. The percussive mechanism consists of an ultrasonic horn, a free mass, and the drill rod. Special attention is given to the impact between the free mass and the drill rod, including the effects of structural damping, the supporting medium of the rod, plastic deformation in the contact area, and repeated impacts of the free mass on the drill rod. A general methodology to analyze the impact of the free mass on the drill rod, analogous to the longitudinal impact of a mass on a rod, is developed. The methodology involves uncoupling the nonlinear problem by determining the response of each body independently under the contact force to find the local indentation, then using Hertz force-indentation relation to find the contact force. This method is applied using mode superposition method and finite element technique for various support conditions of the rod (e. g. rigid, elastic, free, viscoelastic). Additionally, a model to account for drill rod penetration into the supporting medium due to impact of the free mass is also presented. It was found that for an undamped rod, the support condition of the rod does not affect the contact force if the contact ends before the arrival of the reflected wave to the point of contact. It was also observed that the contact force due to impact, for a given support condition, increases with increasing damping of the rod. Moreover, a modified Hertz equation is introduced to include plastic deformation on the rod due to impact of the free mass. The study was performed for identical repetitive impacts and it was found that the largest plastic deformation occurs in the first impact, with additional plastic deformation decreasing with the increasing number of impacts. The dynamic response of the overall <b>percussive</b> <b>drill</b> was investigated with a finite element model, including the interaction of the free mass with the ultrasonic horn and the drill rod. A numerical example indicated that the dynamic response of the ultrasonic drill is directly affected by the supporting medium.

Thus, {{it is important to}} develop a fully autonomous drilling platform that will be capable of accessing the required depth and retrieving cores for scientific analysis. The method of drilling most likely to succeed will be a conventional mechanical core drill, either rotary or percussive, with a mechanical system for removing the cuttings and rock core from the hole.

50|$|His next {{innovation}} was {{a hydraulic}} drill, powered by high-pressure water. A number of quarries were experimenting with compressed air <b>percussive</b> <b>drills,</b> but Kellow disliked them, {{because they were}} noisy, created clouds of dust, and were uncomfortable {{to the men who}} had to use them for long periods. His design of twist drill was attached to the rock by making two 2.5 in holes, which acted as anchorages, and pressure of 2 to 3 tons was applied, which enabled a 7.5 ft hole to be drilled in under two minutes. Previously, hand drilling of such a hole took around ten hours, and the new process created no dust. Kellow implemented another change in working practice, so that rockmen in a chamber would create the two small anchorage holes where they needed a hole to be drilled, and then call for the drilling team, probably one man and an assistant, who would set up the drill, drill the hole, and {{move on to the next}} chamber. The drilling team had an interest in maintaining the drill, and the rockmen could get on with blasting the rock and extracting blocks. Kellow refined the design of the drill over the years, and they were used extensively at Croesor and Parc, and found some use at Llechwedd quarry in Blaenau Ffestiniog, but Weaver has suggested that it failed to find wider markets because Kellow did not emphasise the changes in working practice which made it a success in his own quarries.|$|R

Heat flow measurements are a high priority for the geophysical network missions to the Moon recommended by the latest Decadal Survey and previously the International Lunar Network. One of the difficulties associated with lunar heat flow measurement on a robotic mission is that it requires excavation of a relatively deep (approx 3 m) hole {{in order to avoid the}} long-term temporal changes in lunar surface thermal environment affecting the subsurface temperature measurements. Such changes may be due to the 18. 6 -year-cylcle lunar precession, or may be initiated by presence of the lander itself. Therefore, a key science requirement for heat flow instruments for future lunar missions is to penetrate 3 m into the regolith and to measure both thermal gradient and thermal conductivity. Engineering requirements are that the instrument itself has minimal impact on the subsurface thermal regime and that it must be a low-mass and low-power system like any other science instrumentation on planetary landers.

40|$|Traditional rotary {{drilling}} for planetary rock sampling, in situ analysis, and sample return are challenging because {{the axial force}} and holding torque requirements are not necessarily compatible with lightweight spacecraft architectures in low-gravity environments. This paper seeks to optimize an ultrasonic <b>percussive</b> <b>drill</b> tool to achieve rock penetration with lower reacted force requirements, with a strategic view toward building an ultrasonic planetary core drill (UPCD) device. The UPCD is a descendant of the ultrasonic/sonic driller/corer technique. In these concepts, a transducer and horn (typically resonant at around 20 kHz) are used to excite a toroidal free mass that oscillates chaotically between the horn tip and drill base at lower frequencies (generally between 10 Hz and 1 kHz). This creates a series of stress pulses that is transferred through the drill bit to the rock surface, and while the stress at the drill-bit tip/rock interface exceeds the compressive strength of the rock, it causes fractures that result in fragmentation of the rock. This facilitates augering and downward progress. In {{order to ensure that}} the drill-bit tip delivers the greatest effective impulse (the time integral of the drill-bit tip/rock pressure curve exceeding the strength of the rock), parameters such as the spring rates and the mass of the free mass, the drill bit and transducer have been varied and compared in both computer simulation and practical experiment. The most interesting findings and those of particular relevance to deep drilling indicate that increasing the mass of the drill bit has a limited (or even positive) influence on the rate of effective impulse delivered...|$|R

As {{a result of this}} analysis, a control algorithm is formulated to enhance the drilling process efficiency. This algorithm calculates the specific energy (SE) of the rock and adjusts the applied feed force based on this SE value, using a relationship obtained from the field data analysis. A model of the <b>percussive</b> <b>drilling</b> process is developed and simulated in software. The proposed control algorithm is tested through simulations on this simulated drilling process. The results of the simulation show a significant increase in efficiency of the drilling process. As a result of vibration data analysis it is concluded that vibration should be controlled through an improved design of the shock-absorber, rather than through drilling variables. A detailed shock-absorber test data analysis is therefore presented. Recommendations for design changes in the shock-absorber are also given. Deviation analysis is also presented in the thesis, which shows a poor correlation between the machine variables and the hole deviation data. Hence, it is recommended that deviation be controlled by steering. An innovative guided drilling mechanism for controlling the hole deviation is also proposed. This mechanism consists of an eccentric ITH percussive hammer with controlled rotational speed, which can be employed as an actuator to steer the drill string in a desired direction without using any down hole instrumentation. Modelling and simulation analysis of this system is also presented...|$|E
40|$|Rock {{drilling}} {{is essential}} in the mining industry. Complexities involved in the drilling process encompassing not only rock properties but also {{the nature of the}} drilling action impact the drilling performance and operational costs. Brittleness is a fundamental rock property relevant to rock drilling and excavation works. However, rock brittleness is a concept yet to be investigated. In this study, a new brittleness index developed upon fracture energy quantities withdrawn from the complete stressstrain characteristics in uniaxial compression of rock is presented. A vast independent data on the drilling performance reported elsewhere in the literature was evaluated against the new brittleness index. The results show that the proposed brittleness index successfully describes the performance of different drilling methods including PDC (Polycrystalline Diamond Compact) rotary drilling, roller-cone rotary drilling and <b>percussive</b> <b>drilling.</b> Munoz, H.

40|$|To the north-west of Slade Hall {{localised}} uranium {{and base}} metal mineralisation has been traced by radiometric and geochemical soil surveys. It is confmed to two narrow structures in a fault zone trending NW-SE and at surface {{it has a}} strike length {{of no more than}} 200 m. <b>Percussive</b> <b>drilling</b> down to the shallow water table indicated persistence of the secondary metalliferous minerals but narrow diameter cored drilling failed to intersect any recognisable well-mineralised structure at a depth of only 50 m. It remains uncertain whether a small ore shoot exists below the surface anomalies; if so, it must be presumed to pitch south-eastwards. Only oxidised, and possibly enriched, mineralisation has been sampled; this yielded a little cassiterite, sphalerite, pyrite, pyrrhotite and covellite, abundant hydrated iron and manganese oxides with adsorbed uranium, lead, bismuth, zinc, copper and arsenic, and flakes of secondary uranium and silver minerals. Radiometry confirmed gross uranium disequilibrium...|$|E
50|$|Other {{innovations}} {{included a}} new type of planing machine which he invented, which worked between six and ten times faster than traditional designs. Removal of water form the mine was improved by the installation of centrifugal pumps, capable of pumping 400 imp gal per minute. Productivity was improved by the replacement of hand-drills with another of Kellow's inventions. His Kellow drill used high pressure water, produced no dust, and could drill a 7.5 ft hole in under two minutes, instead of the ten hours required when a hand-drill was used. At the time, <b>percussive</b> <b>drills</b> powered by compressed air were being introduced in many quarries, but Kellow disliked them because they were very noisy, created clouds of dust, and were uncomfortable to the men who had to use them for long periods. His drill was basically a twist drill, similar to those used to drill wood or metal. In order to hold it against the rock face, two small holes were drilled to a depth of 2.5 in, into which two rods on the drill were inserted, and jacked apart to secure it. The drill was powered by a small Pelton wheel, supplied with water at , equivalent to a head of 1100 ft. He obtained a patent for the design in 1898, the year in which he introduced the drills to the quarry. The drills were still noisy, and discharged the spent water into the quarry, typically 400 imp gal in the 90 seconds it took to drill a hole.|$|R
40|$|The noise {{produced}} by a pneumatic <b>percussive</b> rock <b>drill</b> was studied both under field conditions and when the machine was reciprocating without load in an anechoic chamber. Sound pressure levels were measured at two standard locations, one of which corresponded to the average position for an operator 2 ̆ 7 s ear, where the order of importance of the individual noise sources contributing to the overall intensity was determined to be: exhaust process, mounting rattle, movement of the rifle bar, rock penetration, valve movement and the percussion action. It was possible to reduce the overall intensity of the drill noise from 117 to 98. 5 dB at the ear position {{with a loss of}} approximately 45...|$|R
40|$|Impact-loaded conical and {{cylindrical}} friction joints are studied theoretically and experimentally. The system considered {{consists of}} a long, straight, cylindrical and linearly elastic rod which is impacted axially at one end, and which has a body attached {{by means of a}} friction joint at the opposite end. The conditions are such that the wave propagation is 1 -D in the rod and can be neglected in the attached body. Slip and energy dissipation due to an impact load are determined. The theoretical results of the impact-loaded conical friction joints exhibit phenomena which sometimes have spectacular appearance. The agreement between theoretical and experimental results is fair. The influence of blow frequency and thrust on the performance of a <b>percussive</b> rock <b>drill</b> is studied theoretically. The drill considered consists of hammer, adapter, rod and bit. Two different rock drills are studied. The first is a simple drill with constant characteristic impedance throughout the drill. The second is a prototype of a high frequency <b>percussive</b> rock <b>drill.</b> The efficiency and the maximum (maximum tensile) and minimum (maximum compressive) stresses are determined. For the simple drill the average efficiency in the range from soft to hard rock is only weakly dependent on the blow frequency up to relatively high blow frequencies but strongly dependent for extremely high blow frequencies. It is also found that the maximum and minimum stresses in the drill in the range from soft to hard rock are only weakly dependent on the blow frequency up to high frequencies but strongly dependent for extremely high frequencies. The maximum stress increases and the minimum stress decreases with thrust. Godkänd; 1986; 20070108 (mlk...|$|R
