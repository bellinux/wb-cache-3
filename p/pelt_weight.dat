40|$|Objectives were {{to analyse}} {{absolute}} and relative size of mink at maturity, and to test effects of selection line, sex and interaction on size. For {{male and female}} mink selected for high or low feed efficiency, size at 30 weeks was analyzed for body weight, carcass weight, <b>pelt</b> <b>weight,</b> subcutaneous fat weight, and pelt length. For absolute size, an ANOVA model included effects of line, sex, and interaction. For relative size, two models were used: an allometric model and an extended allometric model, which included effects of line, sex, and interaction. For the ANOVA model, sexes differed for each variable; females were less than males. As a percentage of body weight, however, carcass weight was larger in females than males, whereas fat weight was smaller in females than males. For the extended allometric growth model, sexes differed for carcass weight and subcutaneous fat weight; females fattened faster than males...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to evaluate the effects of dietary cysteine, a sulphur containing amino acid supplementation on growth performance, pelt quality and a number of serum biochemical parameters of young Rex Rabbit. One hundred and twenty Rex Rabbits aged 45 days were divided into five dietary treatment groups including one control group and 4 experimental groups. Each group was composed of 24 animals and was fed with different diets for 56 days corresponding to the fattening period. Diet was incorporated with 0 % of cysteine (control group) and 0, 10 %, 0, 20 %, 0, 30 % and 0, 40 % respectively for the experimental groups. At the end of the experiment, results showed that cysteine supplementation to the diet affected average daily gain, live weight,skin length, skin area and <b>pelt</b> <b>weight</b> at the late phase of 42 to 56 days (P 0. 05...|$|E
40|$|Forty Kacang doe (average initial BW, 10. 2 kg) {{were used}} in 4 x 2 {{factorial}} arrangement to determine carcass characteristics. Dose of the testosterone as first factor were assigned to four levels, i. e. : control (T 0), 1 dose of testosterone propionate (T 1), 2 doses of TP (T 2), and 3 doses of TP (T 3). The age of animals as the second factor, i. e. : 7 - 8 months of age (U 1) and 9 - 12 months of age (U 2), referred to chevon method. The treatment combinations were replicated 5 times, respectively, so that there were 40 heads of doe. Animals were injected with 0. 77 mg of TP/kg BW/d weekly for first dose and the goats were fed for 90 days. The diet were assigned to met or exceed 50 g ADG. The variables included slaughter weight, carcass weight, <b>pelt</b> <b>weight,</b> and Kidney Pelvic Heart (KPH) fat weight. There were significant interaction (P< 0. 01), except on KPH weight.

40|$|This study {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that increased maternal nutrition during early and mid-pregnancy could affect placental and fetal development at mid-gestation and fetal weight at term. Mixed-aged Romney ewes (n= 136) were mated at a synchronised oestrus and then randomly allocated to a M ("maintenance", average live weight 54. 5 ± 1. 5 kg) or H ("high", equal to 1. 5 M, average live weight 55. 3 ± 1. 5 kg) feeding level from day 19 of pregnancy (P 19). At P 47, the M group was {{divided into two groups}} and each group was allocated to either a M or H feeding level until P 102. Thirty ewes (10 per group) were slaughtered at P 102 - 104. The remaining ewes from each group were further subdivided into either a M or H feeding level from P 102 to P 136. These ewes were slaughtered at P 136 - 140. Maintenance requirements for a 55 kg ewe were assumed to be 11 MJ ME/day at an energy concentration of 10 MJ ME/kg DM. Over the period from P 19 to P 102, mean herbage dry matter (DM) intake ranged from 0. 98 to 1. 24 kg ewe- 1 day- 1 resulting in ewe live weight changes of 3. 1, 4. 8 and 5. 9 kg for the MM, MH and HH groups (P< 0. 05) respectively. From P 102 to P 131, mean herbage DM intake ranged from 0. 97 to 1. 66 kg ewe- 1 day- 1 resulting in ewe live weight changes of 5. 2, 9. 0, 8. 4, 14. 0, 9. 2 and 14. 8 kg for the MMM, MMH, MHM, MHH, HHM and HHH groups (P< 0. 05) respectively. Feeding level had no significant effect on placental and fetal weights at either of the two slaughter periods (P 102 - 104 and P 136 - 140). Placental weights at P 102 - 104 were 658. 0 ± 49. 5, 612. 1 ± 49. 5 and 676. 7 ± 50. 6 g, and fetal weights were 1281. 7 ± 50. 4, 1296. 0 ± 50. 8 and 1258. 2 ± 53. 4 g for the MM, MH, and HH groups, respectively. At P 136 - 140 placental weights were 583. 2 ± 81. 9, 545. 8 ± 72. 8, 602. 3 ± 77. 4, 551. 5 ± 72. 8, 622. 5 ± 84. 6 and 547. 3 ± 86. 7 g, and fetal weights were 4535. 9 ± 175. 4, 4640. 5 ± 162. 7, 4836. 6 ± 166. 3, 4651. 5 ± 159. 3, 4408. 5 ± 186. 1 and 4389. 2 ± 189. 1 g for the MMM, MMH, MHM, MHH, HHM and HHH groups, respectively. <b>Pelt</b> <b>weights</b> were significantly (P< 0. 05) affected by pregnancy rank at P 102 but final ewe live weights and carcass weights were not. Other components (i. e., total placentome and total cotyledon) were significantly (P< 0. 05) heavier in twins than in singles but were not affected by feeding level. Ewes carrying twin fetuses had significantly (P< 0. 05) more placentomes and tended to have more caruncles than single-bearing ewes. Caruncle occupancy was significantly (P< 0. 05) higher in twins than in singles (87 % vs 80 %, respectively). Pre-partum nutritional treatments from P 102 to P 136 affected final ewe live weights, carcass <b>weights</b> and <b>pelts</b> <b>weights</b> (P< 0. 05). Pregnancy rank had no effects on final ewe live <b>weights</b> or <b>pelt</b> <b>weights</b> but did affect carcass weights at P 136. Carcasses of ewes carrying a single fetus were heavier than those of ewes carrying twins. Single-bearing ewes had lower weights of mammary glands, uterus, myoendometrium, fetal membranes, total placentomes, and total cotyledons, and had lower placentome numbers compared to ewes carrying twins (P< 0. 05) at P 136. Weights of gravid uterus, total caruncle weights and total caruncle numbers were not affected pregnancy rank at day 136 of gestation. Based on the comparison of these results with earlier studies, it can be concluded that quite severe nutritional treatments are required to influence placental and fetal weights at P 102 - 104 and P 136 - 140...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to study the interaction between slaughter age and restricted feed, as well as the influence of each factor on the production of rex rabbits pelt. Randomized Block Design with Factorial was used in this experiment with the first factor was 3 levels of restricted feeding treatment where the amount of feed as follow: P 1 = 100 % from the total feed requirement, P 2 = 80 % from total feed requirement and P 3 = 60 % from the total feed requirement. Feed was given in the amount of rabbits requirement, in which 100 % of the total requirement was calculated based on body weight (6. 7 % of body weight in dry matter basis), and second factor was 3 levels of slaughter age (U 1 = 120 d, U 2 = 150 d, U 3 = 180 d) and each treatment was repeated 6 times. The data were analyzed by Anova, and analyzing between the treatments used Contrast Orthogonal. The variable measured were <b>pelt</b> production (<b>weight</b> <b>pelt,</b> width pelt, thickness dermis and epidermis) of Rex rabbit. There was an interaction betwen slaughtered age and the amount of feed given to Rex rabbits. Feeding 80 % from the total feed requirement and the slaughtered age at 150 d were the most efficient in producing pelt of Rex rabbits, with weight 261. 0 ± 30. 33 g, width 928. 0 ± 75. 5 cm 2, and epidermal thickness 32. 50 ± 1. 1 µ, and dermis 2685. 50 ± 15. 0 µ...|$|R
50|$|The {{presence}} of calcium hydroxide {{results in the}} alkaline swelling of skin. The result is the influx of water into the hide/skin and a marked increase in fibre diameter and fibre shortening. The thickness of the skin increases, but the surface area of the <b>pelt</b> decreases. The <b>weight</b> increase, due to the uptake of water results in a doubling of the hide/skin weight. But this weight also needs {{to take into consideration}} that proteins (especially the hair) have been removed and the fleshing operation is often performed after liming.|$|R

For each treatment used, three sides of cow hide with twice replications. The treatment was nine time done. Before the waste chrome liquor was used for tanning it must be adjusted for the quantity of the flood, the pH and the, consenteration. Ther more 7 % basic chrome-sulphate base on the <b>pelt</b> <b>weight</b> was added. The leathers out put were visual investigated, and chemically analysed. The waste chrome liquor was chemically analysed. Statistically analyse point out that there is no significance different (P ≤ 0. 05) degree of Cr 2 O 3 either in the leather or in the waste chrome liquor due to the treatment. Degree of Cr 2 O 3 of the leather revolve from 3, 17 up to 3, 82 %, whereas degree of, Cr 2 O 3 of the liquor revolve from 7, 81 %, up to, 13, 4 gram per litre.

40|$|Over {{the last}} few years a great deal of {{information}} has been obtained on the different mechanisms whereby small mammals maintain thermal balance in cold environments. The physiological adjustments that take place to acclimation (exposure to a constant temperature in the laboratory) and acclimatization to cold have recently been reviewed at the International Symposium on Cold Acclimation Fed. Proc. 22 No. 3 1964. These studies have been confined mainly to the white rat and the Norway rat exposed in the laboratory and outdoors to cold temperatures. Few attempts have been made to investigate genetic differences in the possible adjustments that take place on exposure to cold within any one species of mammal. The amount of data concerning the mechanisms whereby small mammals adjust to high temperatures is small. Again, no attempts have been made using small mammals to investigate genetic differences in the response to high temperatures within any one species. The present study was designed to investigate the possibility of differences in response of four strains of mice to high and low temperatures. The factors studied were:- 1. Body Temperatures. 2. Body weight and tail length and the relationships between these two factors. 3. Tail weight. 4. Hair weight. 5. <b>Pelt</b> <b>weight.</b> 6. Total body fat. 7. Abdominal fat. 8 Food intake. Differences in the adjustments to temperature treatments in the four strains were considered likely to show as differences in some or all of these more easily measured factors. If such differences were found to occur between the four strains this should then provide a basis for more detailed studies of their genetic and physiological basis...|$|E
40|$|The {{feeding trial}} {{was carried out}} on 172 blue foxes during growing-furring period (94 males and 78 females). The feeding trial was {{conducted}} as a field study 25. 8. - 11. 11. 2003 in private fur farm in Evijärvi, Finland (Oy Turkistarha Jussi Eilonen). The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effects of two phase protein feeding on growth, health and fur quality parameters of blue foxes during growing-furring period. The groups were control group and research group. Control feed contained normal protein level (recommendation of Finnish Fur Breeders Association) without amino acid supplement (commercial blue fox feed with 28 % protein of ME during 25. 8. - 22. 9. and 25 % protein of ME during 23. 9. - 11. 11.). Research feed contained 25 % protein of ME during 25. 8. - 22. 9 and 20 % protein of ME during 23. 9. - 11. 11. both with supplemented methionine. The control feed was made and delivered to the farm daily. The research feed was made once a week and stored in the farm. Both groups were fed with the same amount of food daily. Animals were weight biweekly during the trial and they were pelted at the end of the trial. Pelt length (cm) and weight (g) was measured after which they were graded at the Finnish Fur Sales Company Ltd for colour, clarity, fur density, guard hair quality, coverage, quality and overall impression. The faeces were analysed for phosphorus, liquid nitrogen and total nitrogen. All blue foxes maintained good health during the feeding trial nor did high amount of cereals cause any faecal problems. No statistically significant differences between treatments were found in mean weight gain in the trial. Final average weight (per cage) was 16, 92 kg in control group and 16, 67 kg in research group. In the trial no statistically significant differences between treatments were found in pelt length, <b>pelt</b> <b>weight,</b> color, clarity, fur density, quard hair quality, coverage, quality and in overall impression. Phosphorus and nitrogen content of the faeces were much lower in the control group: P 8. 8 and N 5. 3 g/kg in research group, P 13. 0 and N 9. 7 g/kg in control group. In conclusion, the experiment showed that with two phase protein feeding during growing-furring period with supplemented methionine blue foxes grow normally and the pelts are similar fed with higher protein containing feed. By using less expensive raw materials such as cereals and methionine in blue fox feed the producing costs are lower. By using less protein and ash containing raw materials in feed also phosphorus and nitrogen loads are getting smaller. Although supplemental methionine is essential for normal hair priming in low protein feeds. Without adequate methionine the hair growth and the skin development is abnormal. Generally, the two phase feeding during growing-furring perioid produces healthy animals and high-quality pelts, even the effect of lower (15 % protein of ME) protein level on growth and fur properties should be studied. vo...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1977 Three {{products}} {{derived from}} shrimp processing waste (Pandalus jordani) and a protein concentrate extracted from king crab waste (Paralithodes camschatica) were evaluated as feed supplements for standard dark and sapphire pelter mink (Mustela vison) replacing approximately 10 and/or 20 {{percent of the}} protein in a standard wet diet (33 percent protein) on an equal-protein basis. Partial mean analyses of waste products were as follows: untreated shrimp waste (25. 5 percent corrected crude protein (CCP), 14. 4 percent calcium, 19. 3 percent chitin); shrimp meal (26. 6 percent CCP, 13. 8 percent calcium, 17. 6 percent chitin); sieved shrimp meal (34. 0 percent CCP, 10. 3 percent calcium, 10. 6 percent chitin); and crab protein concentrate (67. 1 percent CCP, 0. 1 percent calcium, trace chitin). Mink of both sexes and strains fed crustacean waste diets generally showed lower final weights and weight gains and increased feed consumption as compared to control groups fed a standard ration. These effects were most pronounced in males and, {{with the exception of}} the 20 percent protein replacement level (PRL) shrimp meal group, appeared to result primarily from the lower fat concentrations of the test diets. Significantly lower weight gains of males (P<. 01 darks, P<. 05 sapphires) on the 20 percent PRL shrimp meal diet appeared to be related to an excessive amount of dietary calcium (Ca/P = 3. 48), resulting from shrimp waste supplementation, interfering with nutrient utilization. Pelt sizes and <b>pelt</b> <b>weights</b> varied directly with final body weights. General condition and fur color and quality were not appreciably affected. It is concluded crustacean waste products could be used satisfactorily as protein supplements for mink providing the protein and energy concentration of the diet is maintained at a sufficient level and dietary calcium does not become excessive. The Ca/P ratio of the diet (Ca/P I. 2) is suggested as a guideline for determining the maximum level of crustacean waste supplementation. From an economic standpoint, wet-ground shrimp waste is probably the only shellfish waste product potentially valuable as a mink feed in the Pacific Northwest at the present time...|$|R
