40|$|Development of an optical, {{laser-based}} flow-field {{measurement technique}} for large wind tunnels is described. The technique uses laser sheet illumination and charged coupled device detectors to rapidly measure flow-field velocity distributions over large planar {{regions of the}} flow. Sample measurements are presented that illustrate the capability of the technique. An analysis of measurement uncertainty, which focuses on the random component of <b>uncertainty,</b> shows that <b>precision</b> <b>uncertainty</b> is not dependent on the measured velocity magnitude. For a single-image measurement, the analysis predicts a <b>precision</b> <b>uncertainty</b> of +/- 5 m/s. When multiple images are averaged, this uncertainty is shown to decrease. For an average of 100 images, for example, the analysis shows that a <b>precision</b> <b>uncertainty</b> of +/- 0. 5 m/s can be expected. Sample applications show that vectors aligned with an orthogonal coordinate system are difficult to measure directly. An algebraic transformation is presented which converts measured vectors to the desired orthogonal components. Uncertainty propagation is then used {{to show how the}} uncertainty propagates from the direct measurements to the orthogonal components. For a typical forward-scatter viewing geometry, the propagation analysis predicts <b>precision</b> <b>uncertainties</b> of +/- 4, +/- 7, and +/- 6 m/s, respectively, for the U, V, and W components at 68 % confidence...|$|R

These uncertainties are then employed to calculate the uncertainties of force-moment values computed from observed balance output readings obtained during tests.

40|$|Experimental {{aerodynamic}} researchers require estimated <b>precision</b> and bias <b>uncertainties</b> of measured physical quantities, typically at 95 percent confidence levels. Uncertainties {{of final}} computed aerodynamic parameters are obtained by propagation of individual measurement uncertainties through the defining functional expressions. In this paper, rigorous mathematical techniques are extended to determine <b>precision</b> and bias <b>uncertainties</b> of any instrument-sensor system. Through this analysis, instrument uncertainties determined through calibration are now expressed as {{functions of the}} corresponding measurement for linear and nonlinear univariate and multivariate processes. Treatment of correlated measurement precision error is developed. During laboratory calibration, calibration standard uncertainties {{are assumed to be}} an order of magnitude less than those of the instrument being calibrated. Often calibration standards do not satisfy this assumption. This paper applies rigorous statistical methods for inclusion of calibration standard uncertainty and covariance due to the order of their application. The effects of mathematical modeling error on calibration bias uncertainty are quantified. The effects of experimental design on uncertainty are analyzed. The importance of replication is emphasized, techniques for estimation of both bias and <b>precision</b> <b>uncertainties</b> using replication are developed.

40|$|A high {{precision}} and high resolution time-to-digital converter (TDC) implemented in a 40 nm fabrication process Virtex- 6 FPGA {{is presented in}} this paper. The multi-chain measurements averaging architecture is used to overcome the resolution limitation determined by intrinsic cell delay of the plain single tapped-delay chain. The resolution and precision are both improved with this architecture. In such a TDC, the input signal is connected to multiple tapped-delay chains simultaneously (the chain number is M), {{and there is a}} fixed delay cell between every two adjacent chains. Each tapped-delay chain is just a plain TDC and should generate a TDC time for a hit input signal, so totally M TDC time values should be got for a hit signal. After averaging, the final TDC time is obtained. A TDC with 3 ps resolution (i. e. bin size) and 6. 5 <b>ps</b> <b>precision</b> (i. e. RMS) has been implemented using 8 parallel tapped-delay chains.

Historically, ice cover has been detected and ice concentration has been measured using relatively low-resolution space-based passive microwave data. This study presents an algorithm to detect ice and estimate ice concentration in clear-sky areas over the ocean and inland lakes and rivers using high-resolution data from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) onboard the Suomi National Polar Orbiting Partnership (S-NPP) and on future Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS) satellites, providing spatial detail that cannot be obtained with passive microwave data.

This paper presents an inverse modeling approach to quantify the recharge contribution from both an ephemeral river channel and an introduced artificial recharge system based on floodwater spreading in arid Iran.
