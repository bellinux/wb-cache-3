40|$|Results from 29 semi-mature {{trials of}} New Zealand Pinus radiata D. Don {{indicate}} that height growth is {{positively correlated with}} final-crop stocking in certain circumstances, and where stockings are less than 800 stems/ha (higher stockings were not analysed). A subsidiary dataset, with ages from planting to 7 years, gave results that confirmed these. Twelve of the trials demonstrated a significant (p< 0. 05) decrease in annual height increment with a reduction in stocking. For these trials there was an average height loss of 0. 13 m/year after thinning to final stockings, or approximately 2 m over one typical rotation, for every halving in stocking. One possibility is that this effect is due to wind: lower stockings incur greater wind turbulence, which reduces height growth.

The study area was closed-canopy evergreen coniferous plantations dominated by Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica) and hinoki cypress (Chamaecyparis obtusa) in Japan. The stand age ranged from 33 to 100 years and the area was undulating terrain with a variation in elevation ranging from 135 to 391 m above sea level. A total of 33 circular sample plots (0. 04 ha) were established and <b>predominant</b> <b>mean</b> tree <b>heights</b> for each plot were calculated using individual tree heights within each sample plot. Data from three different flight altitudes (500 m, 1000 m, and 1500 m) were acquired with Optech ALTM 3100 sensor in late summer 2006. The settings of lidar system were paid attention as the laser footprints should cover the targeted area without omission, i. e. the laser spot spacing should be close to footprint diameter in the resultant data. Owing to this idea, {{we were able to}} theoretically avoid missing treetops and passing through the canopy gaps just by chance for a given transmitted laser pulse. The results of this study demonstrate that the higher platform altitude would reduce both the penetration rates and the intensities of laser pulses, and affect not only the quality of digital surface model, but also the quality of digital terrain model more significantly in forests with undulating topographies, thus indicating the less accurate estimates of lidarderived tree heights. 1...|$|R

60|$|But {{in those}} cases in which plants {{of the same species}} were {{observed}} during several generations, a general average of their heights in all the generations together may be made; and such averages are given in Table 7/A; for instance, under Ipomoea the general average for the plants of all ten generations is as 100 for the crossed, to 77 for the self-fertilised plants. This having been done in each case in which more than one generation was raised, it is easy to calculate the average of the average heights of the crossed and self-fertilised plants of all the species included in Table 7/A. It should however be observed that as only a few plants of some species, whilst a considerable number of others, were measured, the value of the <b>mean</b> or average <b>heights</b> of the several species is very different. Subject to this source of error, it may be worth while to give the mean of the <b>mean</b> <b>heights</b> of the fifty-four species in Table 7/A; and the result is, calling the mean of the <b>mean</b> <b>heights</b> of the crossed plants 100, that of the self-fertilised plants is 87. But it is a better plan to divide the fifty-four species into three groups, as was done with the previously given eighty-three cases. The first group consists of species of which the <b>mean</b> <b>heights</b> of the self-fertilised plants are within five per cent of 100; so that the crossed and self-fertilised plants are approximately equal; and of such species there are twelve about which nothing need be said, the mean of the <b>mean</b> <b>heights</b> of the self-fertilised being of course very nearly 100, or exactly 99.58. The second group consists of the species, thirty-seven in number, of which the <b>mean</b> <b>heights</b> of the crossed plants exceed that of the self-fertilised plants by more than five per cent; and the mean of their <b>mean</b> <b>heights</b> is to that of the self-fertilised plants as 100 to 78. The third group consists of the species, only five in number, of which the <b>mean</b> <b>heights</b> of the self-fertilised plants exceed that of the crossed by more than five per cent; and here the mean of the <b>mean</b> <b>heights</b> of the crossed plants is to that of the self-fertilised as 100 to 109. Therefore if we exclude the species which are approximately equal, there are thirty-seven species in which the mean of the <b>mean</b> <b>heights</b> of the crossed plants exceeds that of the self-fertilised by twenty-two per cent; whereas there are only five species in which the mean of the <b>mean</b> <b>heights</b> of the self-fertilised plants exceeds that of the crossed, and this only by nine per cent.|$|R

One is whether, and how, growth patterns of stand <b>mean</b> <b>height</b> {{have changed in}} Hungary {{in the last few}} decades, and the other is whether recently observed increases in mean annual temperature might have caused changes in growth trends. Changes in tree growth were investigated for beech (Fagus sylvatica), sessile oak (Quercus petraea) and Turkey oak (Quercus cerris) by comparing stand <b>mean</b> <b>heights</b> over age using data from the forest inventories of 1981 and 2001, and for sessile oak using stand <b>mean</b> <b>height</b> data from permanent sample plots since 1961. Tree growth was found to have accelerated for each species mentioned, with Turkey oak showing the largest acceleration. To study the second issue, stand <b>mean</b> <b>height</b> was related to elevation, wich in turn was related to mean annual temperature and precipitation. For these analyses, too, data of many thousands of stands in the forest inventory was used. Stand <b>mean</b> <b>height</b> was found to increase with decreasing elevation, i. e. with increasing mean annual temperature, {{for each of the three}} species. As the annual precipitation and air humidity decreases with decreasing elevation, it was concluded that increases of mean annual temperature could positively have affected tree growth in the last few decades. However, this effect is expected to be soon limited by water availability...|$|R

40|$|The {{application}} of airborne laser scanning (ALS) technologies in forest inventories has shown great potential {{to improve the}} efficiency of forest planning activities. Precise estimates, fast assessment and relatively low complexity can explain the good results in terms of efficiency. The evolution of GPS and inertial measurement technologies, {{as well as the}} observed lower assessment costs when these technologies are applied to large scale studies, can explain the increasing dissemination of ALS technologies. The observed good quality of results can be expressed by estimates of volumes and basal area with estimated error below the level of 8. 4 %, {{depending on the size of}} sampled area, the quantity of laser pulses per square meter and the number of control plots. This paper analyzes the potential of an ALS assessment to produce certain forest inventory statistics in plantations of cloned Eucalyptus spp with precision equal of superior to conventional methods. The statistics of interest in this case were: volume, basal area, <b>mean</b> <b>height</b> and dominant trees <b>mean</b> <b>height.</b> The ALS flight for data assessment covered two strips of approximately 2 by 20 Km, in which clouds of points were sampled in circular plots with a radius of 13 m. Plots were sampled in different parts of the strips to cover different stand ages. The clouds of points generated by the ALS assessment: overall <b>height</b> <b>mean,</b> standard error, five percentiles (height under which we can find 10 %, 30 %, 50 %, 70 % and 90 % of the ALS points above ground level in the cloud), and density of points above ground level in each percentile were calculated. The ALS statistics were used in regression models to estimate <b>mean</b> diameter, <b>mean</b> <b>height,</b> <b>mean</b> <b>height</b> of dominant trees, basal area and volume. Conventional forest inventory sample plots provided real data. For volume, an exploratory assessment involving different combinations of ALS statistics allowed for the definition of the most promising relationships and fitting tests based on well known forest biometric models. The models based on ALS statistics that produced the best results involved: the 30 % percentile to estimate mean diameter (R(2) = 0, 88 and MQE%= 0, 0004); the 10 % and 90 % percentiles to estimate <b>mean</b> <b>height</b> (R(2) = 0, 94 and MQE%= 0, 0003); the 90 % percentile to estimate dominant height (R(2) = 0, 96 and MQE%= 0, 0003); the 10 % percentile and <b>mean</b> <b>height</b> of ALS points to estimate basal area (R(2) = 0, 92 and MQE%= 0, 0016); and, to estimate volume, age and the 30 % and 90 % percentiles (R(2) = 0, 95 MQE%= 0, 002).
