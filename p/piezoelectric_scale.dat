40|$|The ever {{increasing}} demand for data processing requires different paradigms for electronics. Excellent performance capabilities such as low power and high speed in electronics can be attained through several factors including using functional materials, which sometimes acquire superior electronic properties. The transduction-based transistor switching mechanism {{is one such}} possibility, which exploits the change in electrical properties of the transducer {{as a function of}} a mechanically induced deformation. Originally developed for deformation sensors, the technique is now moving to the centre stage of the electronic industry as the basis for new transistor concepts to circumvent the gate voltage bottleneck in transistor miniaturization. In issue 37 of Nanotechnology, Chang et al show the piezoelectronic transistor (PET), which uses a fast, low-power mechanical transduction mechanism to propagate an input gate voltage signal into an output resistance modulation. The findings by Chang et al will spur further research into <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>scaling,</b> and the PET fabrication techniques needed to advance this type of device in the future...|$|R
40|$|Background and aims. Basic {{periodontal}} treatment aims at eliminating supra- and sub-gingival plaque {{and establishing}} conditions {{which will allow}} effective self-performed plaque control. This aim is primarily achieved with sonic and ultrasonic scalers. However, generation of bacterial aerosols during these procedures is of great concern to patients, the dentist and the dental assistant. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the reduction in aerosol with and without high-volume evacuator through a microbiological study. Materials and methods. For this clinical study a fumigated closed operatory was selected. Maxillary incisors and canines were selected as an area for <b>scaling.</b> <b>Piezoelectric</b> ultrasonic <b>scaling</b> was performed in the absence and in the presence of a high-volume evacuator at 12 and 20 inches from the patient's oral cavity. In both groups scaling was carried out for 10 minutes. Nutrient agar plates were exposed for a total of 20 minutes. After this procedure, nutrient agar plates were incubated in an incubator at 37 °C for 24 hours. The next day the nutrient agar plates were examined for colony forming units by a single microbiologist. Results. The results showed no statistically significant differences in colony forming units (CFU) with and without the use of a high-volume evacuator either at 12 or 20 inches from the patient’s oral cavity.

40|$|The generated, {{prior to}} the Izmit Turkey large EQ, preseismic {{electric}} signals were recorded in Greece by the VOL Earth's electric field monitoring site. In order to explain their peculiar character and their generating mechanism, a large <b>scale</b> <b>piezoelectric</b> mechanism was assumed that was initiated in the Izmit seismogenic region long before the EQ occurrence time. The theoretical analysis of the adopted physical model justifies the generation {{of a number of}} specific electric signals that can be emitted from the focal area before the rock formation failure. The processing of the registered by the VOL monitoring site raw data revealed the presence of similar signals as the expected theoretical ones. Therefore, it is concluded that long before the Izmit EQ occurrence a large <b>scale</b> <b>piezoelectric</b> mechanism was initiated that was modulated too by the tidally triggered lithospheric oscillation and therefore generated the observed preseismic electric signals. The adopted piezoelectric model provides critical information about the time of occurrence of the seismogenic area rock formation failure and therefore the possibility for a real short-term time prediction of a large EQ. The other two predictive EQ parameters, location and magnitude, are discussed in the frame of electric field triangulation and the Lithospheric Seismic Energy Flow Model (LSEFM).

Because the physical space requirements for pediatric ventricular assist devices (PVADs) implantation are smaller in children, these motors are susceptible to decreased power output and efficiency as they are <b>scaled</b> down. <b>Piezoelectric</b> actuators, which <b>scale</b> down favorably in terms of power output and efficiency, have yielded novel compact piezoelectric hydraulic pumps in the aerospace industry.

40|$|Objectives: Cavitation arising {{within the}} water around the {{oscillating}} ultrasonic scaler tip {{is an area}} that may lead to advances in enhancing biofilm removal. The aim {{of this study is to}} map the occurrence of cavitation around scaler tips under loaded conditions. Materials and methods: Two designs of <b>piezoelectric</b> ultrasonic <b>scaling</b> probes were evaluated with a scanning laser vibrometer and luminol dosimetric system under loaded (100 g/ 200 g) and unloaded conditions. Loads were applied to the probe tips via teeth mounted in a load-measuring apparatus. Results: There was a positive correlation between probe displacement amplitude and cavitation production for ultrasonic probes. The position of cavitation at the tip of each probe was greater under loaded conditions than unloaded and for the longer P probe towards the tip. Conclusions: Whilst increasing vibration displacement amplitude of ultrasonic scalers increases the occurrence of cavitation, factors such as the length of the probe influence the amount of cavitation activity generated. The application of load affects the production of cavitation at the most clinically relevant area-the tip. Clinical relevance: Loading and the design of ultrasonic scalers lead to maximising the occurrence of the cavitation at the tip and enhance the cleaning efficiency of the scaler...|$|R

In this work, we investigate the size dependence of piezoelectric coefficients in nanowires of two such materials- zinc oxide and gallium nitride. Nanowires, oriented along their polar axis, ranging from 0. 6 to 2. 4 nm in diameter were modeled quantum mechanically. A giant piezoelectric size effect is identified for both GaN and ZnO nanowires. However, GaN exhibits a larger and more extended size dependence than ZnO. The observed size effect is discussed {{in the context of}} charge redistribution near the free surfaces leading to changes in local polarization.

The observed preseismic electric signals comply quite well with the theoretical ones that are expected to be generated by a large <b>scale</b> <b>piezoelectric</b> mechanism been activatsd at the focal area due to its excess stress-load. Preseismic electric signals of the total piezoelectric field, its first time derivative, its oscillation due to M 1 and K 1 tidal components have been observed by single monitoring sites during the actual 1999 to 2012 experiment in Greece. Moreover, the "strange attractor like" electric preseismic signal was detected by the simultaneously use of two distant monitoring sites. It is demonstrated that the preseismic electric signals can not only determine quite accurately a very short time window for the EQ occurrence and its epicentral location but the latter can be achieved without any prior knowledge of the geological, tectonic setting or past seismic history of the seismogenic area. The predicted pending EQ is treated as a single isolated destructive nature event which sends clear warning signals well before its occurrence. Real examples are presented from the Greek territory.

Above a critical input power, the strong substrate vibration displacement can also force the molecules out of the graphene film to form a thin fluid layer, which subsequently destabilizes and breaks up to form a mist of micron dimension aerosol droplets. We provide physical insight into this coupling through a simple numerical model, verified through experiments, and show several-fold improvement in the rate of fluid transport through the film, and up to 55 % enhancement in the rate of fluid atomization from the film using this simple method...|$|R

AUVs traditionally are classified as highly efficient, payload capable, and can be utilized as reconnaissance or surveillance vehicles. Undullatory and oscillatory propulsion devices have been conceived to replace the present propulsion technologies, of propellers, with highly maneuverable, efficient, and quiet propulsion systems. Undullatory and oscillatory propulsion {{has been around for}} centuries employed by aquatic life, but only recently have the mini-technologies been available to present such propulsion devices economically and with enough materials research as to mimic biologic life on the same <b>scale.</b> <b>Piezoelectric</b> properties coupled with a thin plate allow for actuation properties, similar to bimetallic metals. Applying two piezoelectrics to the fixed end of a cantilevered beam or plate, on opposite sides, and actuating them with an opposite phase shift in electrical voltage potential results in transverse motion of the beam from the orthogonal plane to the vertical axis of the piezoelectric device. Coupling this property to a particular fiber orientation, composite thin plate, significantly increases the actuation properties. In addition, placing more than two piezoelectrics {{along the length of the}} thin composite plate gives the potential to increase actuation properties and change the motion from oscillatory to undullatory. These motions can again be increased by utilizing the natural vibration modes of the thin composite plate with piezoelectrics near resonance actuation.
