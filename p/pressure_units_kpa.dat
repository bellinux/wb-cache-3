40|$|A {{combined}} geometry plasto-hydrodynamic <b>pressure</b> <b>unit</b> {{has been}} investigated theoretically and experimentally. Previous investigators have used either stepped parallel or tapered bore <b>pressure</b> <b>unit</b> for die-less drawing and/or coating of wires, tubes and stripes. In the present study a combined parallel and tapered bore unit {{has been used in}} conjunction with polymer melts as pressure fluid. In this present work a <b>pressure</b> <b>unit</b> is heated to convert the polymer feed into a viscous melt and the pressure in the fluid is generated by hydrodynamic action when a wire is drawn through it. Experimental work has been carried out on different <b>pressure</b> <b>units</b> with similar external but different internal geometries to investigate the performance of new <b>pressure</b> <b>unit.</b> Different types of polymer were used as the pressure medium. In this work analytical models based on Newtonian and pseudo-Newtonian characteristics have been developed to investigate the performance of the <b>pressure</b> <b>unit</b> and to optimise the process. The predicted results showed reasonable agreement those observed experimentally in magnitudes of maximum pressure. Experimental and theoretical results, showed that there exists a gap ratio (optimum) for which the pressure is maximum. For greater or smaller values of the gap ratio than the optimum value, a decreased magnitude for the maximum pressure was obtained. The maximum pressure at that gap ratio(optimum) is much higher compared to those obtained using either stepped or tapered bore <b>pressure</b> <b>unit</b> at similar conditions...|$|R

40|$|In plasto-hydrodynamic die-less {{wire drawing}} process, the {{conventional}} reduction die {{is replaced by}} a <b>pressure</b> <b>unit</b> of certain internal geometry. The deformation is induced by the combined effect of hydro-dynamic pressure and stress generated in the unit due to the motion of the wire and the viscous action of the polymer melt. The dimensions of the unit are such that the smallest bore size is greater than the incoming wire diameter. In this system, larger magnitude of the hydro-dynamic pressure is advantageous in obtaining greater deformation. In the present study, theoretical models have been developed for both the combined parallel and tapered geometry and simple taper bore <b>pressure</b> <b>units,</b> assuming non-Newtonian characteristics of the pressure medium, which enabled prediction of the maximum pressure and drawing stress, which gives better indication about the unit and it’s performance.

40|$|An {{experimental}} protocol to harmonize {{the pressure and}} temperature-histories of model samples treated in different individual high <b>pressure</b> pilot <b>units</b> was developed.

Step zero of this protocol consisted of an exploratory measurement of the pressure, temperature-history of the pressure transmitting medium in the different chambers without the use of a container. In steps one and two of the protocol, the temperature of a sample was measured, which was placed in a container. Two types of samples were considered, a pure water sample allowing free convection (step 1) and a viscous water-based system (using a water soluble thickener) preventing free convection in the sample container (step 2). The high <b>pressure</b> <b>units</b> differed primarily in pressure build-up and pressure release times. The suggested endpoint strategy enabled the minimization of differences in temperature-histories during the pressure holding phase. Pressure, temperature-histories measured in the different high <b>pressure</b> <b>units</b> and information on the inactivation kinetics of a-amylase based systems were used to compare the process impact of different pressure, temperature-histories on the enzyme inactivation.
