The first distinguishing {{feature is the}} unique nature of the services and consequent products supplied by multinational banks, which are aimed at meeting client global demand. The second distinguishing feature is the non-traditional organisational structure that is adopted. This structure, also designed to meet client global demand, introduces issues previously not recognised in the traditional taxation system, which is designed for the structure of traditional multinational entities. The unique differences between traditional multinational entities and multinational banks means there may be {{the need for a}} distinct international tax regime. It is argued that there are “outmoded economic assumptions” upon which the <b>present</b> <b>tax</b> <b>laws</b> relating to multinational banks are based.

40|$|The {{basic problem}} {{investigated}} {{in this thesis}} is that the free rental housing market in Houston has functioned {{in the past in}} a way that is not completely satisfactory to society; that is, it has permitted or perhaps caused the existence of some housing which does not meet the standards of acceptability. The problem of substandard housing may be solved in one or both of the following ways: 1) the free market may be encouraged to function more effectively at low rents, so that a greater supply of adequate low-rent housing may be created, or 2) the public sector may intervene in the housing market in order to enlarge the present subsidization of the city's poor and thereby to include a larger portion of the inadequately housed segment of the population. An analysis was made of the first alternative by examining the main determinants of the supply of acceptable low-rent housing in order to discover the sources of friction or the existence of barriers to efficient market functioning at low levels of rent. The principal sources of friction that were considered in this analysis were those that arise from attitudes and capabilities of owners, builders and lending institutions. Furthermore, the effects of the building code upon the private market were examined. First, it is found that the contribution of the owners of substandard housing to the problem is more a reflection of the economic situation in which they find themselves than the result of malicious neglect. Therefore, it is suggested that conditions be improved by initiating a program of civic encouragement and by changing the <b>present</b> <b>tax</b> <b>laws</b> that are relevant to the problem. Furthermore, it is found that, although builders are striving to provide lower-cost housing, they are not yet capable of building for profit for the low-rent market. Lending institutions, moreover, represent a direct control on the lower limit of effective, financed demand because of their requirements for credit eligibility. It is found that lowering credit requirements, even if this results in higher borrowing costs at the lower limit, would improve the quantity and quality of low-cost housing by increasing the effective demand for it. From our examination of the Houston Building Code, it is concluded that because some of its requirements may be excessive an impartial review of the code should be made by experts for the express purpose of enabling builders to construct less expensive housing for low-income families. The enforcement of the building code has been lax, as witnessed by the chronic substandard conditions in certain areas of the city. Although stricter enforcement of the code is recommended as a necessary tool for combating the problem, the effect of this action would be a reduction in the total low-rent housing supply. Therefore it is mandatory to complement this action with programs designed to increase the supply of adequate low-rent housing. The major conclusion of the thesis is that the most direct way to solve the problem is by public intervention in the market. Although public housing may be subject to criticism if it competes with private enterprise, it is shown that public housing cannot compete with private under present regulations. Furthermore, the expansion of public housing is seen to be the most effective way of meeting the problem in compacted areas. The need for more subsidized housing in Houston at levels which are virtually inaccessible to private enterprise points to its important role in any serious attack on the substandard housing problem...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper was}} {{presented}} to the Forty-Fourth Annual Meeting of the Western Economic Association, "Tax Reform and Voting" concurrent session VII at 10 : 30 a. m. Thursday 21 August 1969, and is abstracted in the Western Economic Journal, VII No. 4 (September 1969). Unless tax policy is evaluated not only from a short-run macroeconomic fiscal policy standpoint but also from a longer-run microeconomic policy standpoint that considers taxation's effects upon equity and resource allocation efficiency, federal taxation's unnecessary excess burden will become no lighter and may grow heavier. This paper attempts to redress the balance of the current federal personal and corporate income tax reform discussion, which has paid minimal attention to the case for heavier capital gains taxation. It reviews the capital gains tax policy literature, argues that <b>present</b> <b>tax</b> <b>law's</b> special treatment of capital gains and losses (compared with its treatment of ordinary income and loss) is not justified, and offers specific recommendations for taxing capital gains more heavily. Special treatment is horizontally and vertically inequitable. It is a major cause of income <b>tax</b> <b>law</b> complexity. And it misallocates the resources invested in new physical capital, by distorting taxpayers' financial decisions and disrupting movements of financial capital, more seriously than heavier capital gains taxation would. Capital gains tax reform should decrease the differential between the effective tax rates on capital gains and ordinary income, and narrow the legal definition of capital assets qualifying for special treatment.

40|$|The tax-free {{treatment}} oflike-kind exchanges <b>presents</b> one of <b>tax</b> <b>law’s</b> {{most compelling}} equity conundrums. <b>Tax</b> <b>law</b> generally does not tax property holders on the property’s appreciation but does tax gain or loss recognized by property sellers and exchangers of non-like-kind property. In the basic Aristotelian system, equity requires that likes be treated alike, {{but the system}} does not provide criteria {{to determine what is}} alike. Depending upon the criteria, exchangers of like-kind property can be similar either to holders or to sellers and exchangers of non-like-kind property. The equity conundrum asks whether <b>tax</b> <b>law</b> should treat exchangers of like-kind property either the same as holders of property or the same as sellers and exchangers of non-like-kind property. This Article frames the conundrum in Rawlsian and Hohfeldian concepts. This framing suggests first that holders should not be taxed on property’s appreciation. Second, this framing explains that once <b>tax</b> <b>law</b> exempts holders’ appreciation from taxation, equity requires that exchanges of like-kind property should also be exempt from taxation. Thus, equity suggests that the <b>tax</b> <b>law</b> should treat exchangers of like-kind property and property holders similarly...|$|R

40|$|U. S. Government {{statistics}} {{are the product}} of a decen-tralized statistical system that involves over 70 Federal Government organizations, one of which is the Statistics of Income Division of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in the Department of the Treasury [11. Another characteristic of the U. S. system is that {{statistics are}} often a by-product of an administrative function and are based on an administrative record. In the case of the Statistics of Income Division, the economic, financial, and tax statistics it produces are a by-product of tax returns that are processed in administer-ing the <b>tax</b> <b>laws.</b> The report series in which the data are released is called Statistics of Income (SOI). This paper reviews the relationships between processing for tax administration and processing for statistics through about 1985. It begins with a description of some of the SOI programs and their uses. It then reviews IRS and SOI processing and their limitations and some of the improve-ments in SOI processing now under consideration. These improvements will help the Statistics of Income Division to operate more efficiently and effectively in meeting the needs of its major users and to adjust to the continuing climate of reduced budgets for statistics. THE STATISTICS OF INCOME PROGRAM The SOI series came into being after the adoption of the Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution and the subse-quent enactment of the first modern U. S. income <b>tax</b> <b>law,</b> the Revenue Act of 1916. This Act specifically called for the annual publication of statistics. The wording contained in the 1916 Act has been repeated, with practically no change, in each major rewrite of the tax statute since that time. It is currently contained in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, which is the basis for the <b>present</b> <b>tax</b> <b>law</b> [2]. SOI data from the very beginning (1913) have been used extensively for tax research and for estimating revenue, especially by officials in the Office of the Secretary of the Treasury. At the start, the reports were almost entirely designed to meet these needs. With the growth of research groups both within and outside the Federal Government and with the increased needs of the tax planners and revenue estimators, new types of data soon were also required. At the same time, the tax returns were expande...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, federal {{government}} agencies have increasingly attempted to use plain language in written communications with the public. The Plain Writing Act of 2010, for instance, requires agencies to incorporate “clear and simple” explanations {{of rules and}} regulations into their official publications. In the tax context, {{as part of its}} “customer service” mission, the Internal Revenue Service bears a “duty to explain” the <b>tax</b> <b>law</b> to hundreds of millions of taxpayers who file tax returns each year. Proponents of the plain language movement have heralded this form of communication as leading to simplicity in tax compliance, more equitable access to federal programs and increased open government. This Article casts plain language efforts in a different light. As we argue, rather than achieving simplicity, which would involve reform of the underlying law, the use of plain language to describe complex legal rules and regulations often yields “simplexity. ” As we define it, simplexity occurs when the government presents clear and simple explanations of the law without highlighting its underlying complexity or reducing this complexity through formal legal changes. We show that in its numerous taxpayer publications, the IRS frequently uses plain language to transform complex, often ambiguous <b>tax</b> <b>law</b> into seemingly simple statements that (1) <b>present</b> contested <b>tax</b> <b>law</b> as clear <b>tax</b> rules, (2) add administrative gloss to the <b>tax</b> <b>law</b> and (3) fail to fully explain the <b>tax</b> <b>law,</b> including possible exceptions. Sometimes these plain language explanations benefit the government; at other times, they benefit taxpayers. While simplexity offers a number of potential tax administration benefits, such as making the <b>tax</b> <b>law</b> understandable and even bolstering the IRS’s ability to collect tax revenue, it can also threaten vital values of transparency and democratic governance and can result in inequitable treatment of different taxpayers. We offer approaches for preserving some of the benefits of simplexity while also responding to some of its drawbacks. We also forecast the likely emergence of simplexity in potential future tax compliance measures, such as government-prepared tax returns, interactive tax return filing and increased third-party reporting...|$|R
