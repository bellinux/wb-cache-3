This completes a circuit which energises a coil around the iron <b>pivot</b> <b>arm</b> and functions as an electromagnet. The magnetic polarity is so arranged that a permanent magnet underneath the arm then repels the <b>pivot</b> <b>arm</b> and causes the circuit to break, but the prongs at the other end of the <b>pivot</b> <b>arm</b> then close an identical circuit at that end and the procedure repeats endlessly. The output of the interrupter is fed to an induction coil which greatly increases the voltage applied to the patient by transformer action.|$|E

5000|$|These {{were simple}} engines {{compared}} to modern engine design. However, they incorporate some very clever designs in several areas, many times because the designer {{was attempting to}} circumvent infringing a patent for a particular part of the engine. This is particularly true {{in the area of}} the governor. Governors are centrifugal, swinging arm, <b>pivot</b> <b>arm,</b> and many others. The actuator mechanism to govern speed is also varied depending on patents existing and the governor used. See, for example, U.S. Patents 543,157 from 1895 or 980,658 from 1911. However accomplished, the governor has one job - to control the speed of the engine. In modern engines, power output is controlled by throttling the flow of the air through the intake by means of a butterfly valve; the only exception to this being in diesels and Valvetronic petrol engines.|$|E
50|$|In the 1930s, the Ordnance Bureau {{developed}} a new bottom plate, which had side flanges that came up on both side of {{the bottom of the}} receiver, that was attached to the side plates by rivets. This fixed the problem of the original bottom plates and became standard for all M1917 and M1919 series machine guns. While the US Arsenal at Rock Island was the leader in converting the existing stocks of M1917 series guns over to 1917A1 configuration, other arsenals took part. In addition, the rear sights were updated for the new ammunition and the new sights did away with the World War I multiple aperture disk on the rear sight. The top covers also had a stronger feed pawl <b>pivot</b> <b>arm</b> installed, so the gun could handle the stress of pulling an ammunition belt the distance from the ground. Rock Island Arsenal also {{developed a}}n all-steel water jacket that went into production around 1943; this was stronger than the earlier brass capped jackets. These steel components were interchangeable with the earlier brass ones to allow for repair of worn or damaged water jacket components.|$|E

40|$|The {{magnitude}} {{and duration of}} corn transpiration reduction during center-pivot sprinkler irrigation was analyzed on a commercial plot. The irrigation event {{was defined as the}} period during which the <b>pivot</b> <b>arm</b> was passing over the transect AC and water droplets were moistening the plants (moist treatment). Corn transpiration rates were measured at three spots of that transect and simultaneously at another spot (dry treatment) located approximately 270 m east from the transect AC. Corn transpiration rates for the moist treatment location were reduced by 30 – 36 % compared to the dry treatment location during the irrigation event. After irrigation, the transpiration reduction lasted for 1. 8 – 2. 6 h, and ranged from 22 – 29 %. The gross wind drift and evaporation losses ranged from 10 – 13 % of the applied water, whereas the net interception losses were 2 % of the applied water. Considering the observed corn transpiration reduction during and after the irrigation, the net sprinkler evaporation losses ranged from 11 – 13 % of the applied water, with no relevant differences along the <b>pivot</b> <b>arm.</b> Read More: [URL]...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to evaluate the impacts of a mechanical macrophyte removal device on changes in littoral sediment substrate. BACKGROUND: Commercially available mechanical macrophyte removal devices have become a popular tool for controlling localized aquatic plant growth near docks and swimming areas. Some use a floating <b>pivot</b> <b>arm</b> with attached dangling underwater rakes to entangle and sweep macrophytes from an area. Others consist of an underwater roller arm located on or immediately above the sediment surface that is attached to a <b>pivot</b> <b>arm</b> and motor mounted on a boat dock or nearshore structure. Paddles are often attached to the roller arm to dig into sediments and uproot macrophytes. Mechanical removal devices can be run continuously for several weeks to clear the area of macrophytes, then run intermittently throughout the growing season (up to 10 hr or more per week) to maintain macrophyte control. Advantages of this type of macrophyte control technique include macrophyte removal in a specific area, low operational costs, and mechanical rather than herbicidal control. One negative impact of mechanical macrophyte removal devices that use an underwater arm with paddles is disturbance and scouring of silty sediment and associated nutrients and contaminants in shallow littoral regions.

40|$|Traditional {{methods for}} center pivot {{evaluation}} {{depend on the}} water depth distribution along the <b>pivot</b> <b>arm.</b> Estimation and mapping the water depth under pivot irrigation systems using remote sensing data is essential for calculating the coefficient of uniformity (CU) of water distribution.

Landsat OLI 8 image was geometrically and radiometrically corrected to calculate the vegetation and water indices (NDVI and NDWI) in addition to land surface temperature. Results of the statistical analysis showed that the collected water depth in catchment cans is also highly correlated negatively with NDVI.

40|$|In this paper, the rst {{experimental}} results of tests {{with a new}} model support designed for simulations of high frequency and high amplitude pitching maneuvers are presented. A generic missile model with a blunt nose was used for which static test data from earlier experiments with a conventional model support were existing.

Afterwards, dynamic tests with sine oscillations at frequencies of fa = 0. 05 Hz [...] . 4 Hz and angles of attack varying between a = 0 ° [...] . 45 ° were performed. Beside the qualication of this new test rig, the tests were used to study the "Phantom Yaw Effect" and to prove an interactive method of its control. This phenomenon is characterized by unwanted yawing moments resulting from asymmetric vortices which can occur on slender bodies at high angles of attack. In the tests, a leevortex control device with symmetrically arranged longitudinal slot nozzles producing "air-jet strakes" was demonstrated to decrease the yawing moments both under static and dynamic conditions...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A six-span center pivot {{irrigation}} system {{was used as}} a platform for testing two wireless sensor networks (WSN) of infrared thermometers. The cropped field was a semi-circle, divided into six pie-slice sections of which three were irrigated manually and three were irrigated automatically based on the time temperature threshold method. One network was mounted on masts fixed to the <b>pivot</b> <b>arm</b> (Pivot-WSN) and was programmed with mesh networking firmware. The second wireless network was comprised of sensors programmed with non-mesh firmware and was deployed in the field (Field-WSN). Our objectives were to: (1) compare the performance of a mesh and non-mesh networking systems of wireless sensors on a center pivot platform; (2) investigate the relationships between crop canopy, sensor body, and air temperatures; and (3) investigate automatic irrigation scheduling using data from wireless sensor networks. The Field-WSN outperformed the Pivot-WSN; data packet retrieval was more than 90 % successful for 93 % of the growing season using the non-mesh networking firmware for the WSN established in the field. The Pivot-WSN performed only 70 % of the time at this same level of success. Temperature differences between the body temperature of the infrared thermometer and crop canopy varied as much as- 5. 1 and 7. 6 ºC.

40|$|A {{variation}} of a hanging pendulum thrust stand capable of measuring {{the performance of}} an electric thruster operating in the vertical orientation is presented. The vertical orientation of the thruster dictates that the thruster must be horizontally offset from the pendulum <b>pivot</b> <b>arm,</b> necessitating {{the use of a}} counterweight system to provide a neutrally-stable system. Motion of the pendulum arm is transferred through a balance mechanism to a secondary arm on which deflection is measured. A non-contact light-based transducer is used to measure displacement of the secondary beam. The members experience very little friction, rotating on twisting torsional pivots with oscillatory motion attenuated by a passive, eddy current damper. Displacement is calibrated using an in situ thrust calibration system. Thermal management and self-leveling systems are incorporated to mitigate thermal and mechanical drifts. Gravitational restoring force and torsional spring constants associated with flexure pivots provide restoring moments. An analysis of the design indicates that the thrust measurement range spans roughly four decades, with the stand capable of measuring thrust up to 12 N for a 200 kg thruster and up to approximately 800 mN for a 10 kg thruster. Data obtained from calibration tests performed using a 26. 8 lbm simulated thruster indicated a resolution of 1 mN on 100 mN-level thrusts, while those tests conducted on 200 lbm thruster yielded a resolution of roughly 2. 5 micro at thrust levels of 0. 5 N and greater...|$|E
40|$|Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASV) {{have many}} {{potential}} {{applications in the}} maritime industry and ocean science. To subsist in the ocean space, an ASV must {{have the ability to}} scavenge energy from the surrounding environment. Waves are an abundant source of energy on the ocean surface and a suitable resource for an ASV to scavenge. Flapping foils have been shown to generate thrust in a wavy flow and power in a uniform flow. The aim of this experimental study is to investigate the relationship between flapping foil propulsion and power generation in the context of ASVs. Initial experiments incorporating fully passive flapping foils submerged at the bow and stern of a surface vessel in head waves were performed in a towing tank. The spring-loaded foils were located at the end of rigid pivot arms protruding at the bow and abaft of the vessel. The pivot arms were free to rotate about a location beneath the keel line and restrained by adjustable rotational dampers. In this free condition, wave energy is recovered in the form of work applied by the flapping foils through the rotary dampers which were used to simulate the damping effects of a power take-off device. Thrust was generated under conditions when the <b>pivot</b> <b>arm</b> was fixed. This system, referred to as the Flapping Energy Utilization and Recovery (FLEUR) system, could serve as a dualpurpose wave energy scavenging propulsor and power generator for long-endurance ASVs...|$|E
40|$|The microclimatic (air {{temperature}} and vapor pressure deficit (VPD)) and physiological (canopy {{temperature and}} plant transpiration) changes due to center pivot sprinkler irrigation were monitored at a commercial plot of maize (Zea mays L.). Two treatments were considered: (a) moist, measurements taken at three spots on a transect when the pivot was running over it; (b) dry, measurements taken simultaneously at a fourth spot D, 270 m apart. A total of 34 irrigation events were monitored, seven of which included plant transpiration measurements. For the transpiration-measured irrigation events, significant (P = 0. 05) {{reductions in the}} monitored variables for the moist treatment were observed for 0. 6 – 2. 1 h before, during and 0. 5 – 2. 4 h after the irrigation. The average decreases for the phase during were 1. 8 – 2. 1 °C for air temperature, 0. 53 – 0. 61 kPa for VPD, 3. 1 – 3. 8 °C for canopy temperature, and 0. 22 – 0. 28 mm h− 1 (30 – 36 %) for transpiration. Lower reductions were found for the phases before and after. The duration of the microclimatic changes decreased as {{the distance from the}} center of the pivot increased (from 3. 9 to 2. 2 h), but the duration of the physiological changes was similar in the different <b>pivot</b> <b>arm</b> portions (≈ 4 h). Microclimatic and physiological changes were higher in drier and warmer days. Transpiration reduction due to irrigation was higher as closer to the center of the pivot and represented 5 – 7 % of the applied water. The estimated reduction of ET represented 1. 5 – 1. 8 % of the applied water. The reduction of transpiration and ET is positive because it represents a reduction in irrigation requirements. The decrease in maize canopy temperature could be positive or negative depending on its effect on photosynthesis...|$|E

40|$|For good crop emergence, {{the seed}} {{should be placed}} at a depth where good {{conditions}} concerning oxygen, temperature and water are provided. To place the seed in the soil, some type of see d coulter is used. Väderstad-Verkens Rapid is a seed drill that places the seed at a certain depth {{in relation to a}} wheel running on the ground. This can lead to a to shallow seed placement. On fields with clayey soils and spring sown cereals a to shallow seed placement can lead to poor emergence, especially if there is no rainfall after seeding. To improve the ability of the Rapid drill to place the seed in moist soil, Väderstad-Verken has developed a spring-loaded coulter. This coulter, like the ordinary Rapid coulter, is placed beside a disc but it can move up and down approximately 15 mm. The idea is to make a coulter which is adjusted to follow the soil mechanical resistance and place the seed in an environment favorable for germination. The aim of this thesis was to compare the performance of the new spring-loaded coulter with the ordinary Rapid coulter. A field experiment was carried out to investigate seed placement and germination. Oats were sown in the spring with three different coulters, one ordinary Rapid coulter and two spring-loaded coulters with different spring-forces, at three different sowing depths. In another experiment the go al was to study how the spring-loaded coulters were moving during sowing. Two linear position sensors were used to measure the movement, one on a coulter with high spring-force and one on a coulter with low spring-force. Three different working speeds and four different sowing depths were used during the test. Compared with the ordinary Rapid coulter the spring-loaded coulters placed a higher proportion of the seeds at a correct depth. Also the plant emergence was better for the spring-loaded coulter. There was little difference in seed placement and plant emergence between the high and low spring-force coulter. The coulter with high spring-force worked deeper and with less standard deviation than the coulter with low spring-force. Both coulters worked more shallow in relation to the disc when the sowing depth or working speed was increased. The standard deviation of the coulter movements was only slightly affected by the sowing depth. The coulter movements were compared with the relief of the seedbed bottom, as measured by a laser. There was no significant relation between the coulter movements and the shape of the seedbed bottom. The advantage of the spring-loaded coulter was that it manages to work deeper than the ordinary Rapid coulter. To make the spring-loaded coulter more able to follow the uneven bottom under the harrowed layer some changes in the design might be necessary. The coulter must be able to move more, especially downwards. The coulter should have longer <b>pivot</b> <b>arm</b> with a low pivot axis and less friction in the suspension joint. Furthermore the spring force should be adjustable. To conclude which is the best design more experiments on different prototypes are necessary...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} the lateral motion of rigid, soil-engaging {{implements}} hitched to a tractor with a one-point or a three-point hitch, {{as well as}} the vertical motion of seed drill coulters for use in tilled seedbeds are investigated. The motion of most tractor-hitched soil-engaging implements is heavily overdamped, it was therefore described by a first order model, based on a quantitative description of the lateral properties of the implement and a functional description of the hitch. For each hitch-implement combination an effective hitch-point, towards which the implement tends to move, was defined and a method to calculate the effective hitch length was developed. The return of a laterally disturbed implement was shown to be exponential. The disturbance is reduced to 10 % of its initial value when the implement moves forward a distance of 2. 3 times the effective hitch length. The tractional hitch point and the directional hitch point coincide for one-point hitches but not for three-point hitches. This gives the three-point hitches unique properties: The angular {{as well as the}} lateral deflection of a three-point hitched implement will normally be smaller compared to those of a one-point hitched version of the same implement. This is true both when it is used on a hillside and when it is used with an asymmetric load. The three-point hitch is also shown to be versatile enough to enable the construction of a laterally movable and, for both directional and non-directional implements, self-centring front mounted three-point hitch. The horizontal and vertical soil forces on coulters with different rake angles (70 - 135 °) were measured under both pseudostatic (no vertical velocity and no accelerations) and fully dynamic conditions. Most of the measurements were made in a soil bin with dried sand, but some of the pseudostatic measurements were made in a clay field. Empirical models were developed for the soil forces acting on the coulter under both pseudostatic and dynamic conditions. These models were used to simulate coulter equilibrium depth and coulter penetration. The simulations led to the following conclusions: Coulters with a large rake angle (≥ 1 l 0 °) have several advantages when compared to coulters with smaller rake angles; their equilibrium depth is less sensitive both to speed and to soil parameters and their penetration is faster, better damped and less sensitive to suspension parameters (<b>pivot</b> <b>arm</b> length and pivot axis height) and to suspension type (single armed or parallel armed). The coulter penetration was found to improve with decreasing speed, decreasing moment of inertia and increasing depth of operation. No reasons were found for complicating the coulter suspension by using a parallel arm suspension or by using separate pivot axes for front and rear row coulters. The above conclusions apply to well tilled seedbeds without stones or clods. If there are frequent stones or clods in the seedbed the present recommendation of using coulters with rake angles around 90 ° seems valid...|$|E
