A number of <b>public</b> <b>buildings,</b> including 28 governmental office buildings, 15 emporiums and 5 hotels, were selected for the investigation from the aspect of energy cost.

30|$|The work of {{this paper}} is as follows. Firstly, a short term load {{forecasting}} method of <b>public</b> <b>building’s</b> CAC baseline load will be discussed in Section  2.

Next, the load reduction control strategies for the <b>public</b> <b>building’s</b> CSCAC and NCSCAC system will be presented respectively in Section  4. Also, the schedulable capacity of CAC system will be calculated by adopting the proposed control strategies. Furthermore, based on a proposed multiple-rank control pattern for the CAC system, the model of DAPND with the participation of a VPU which is composed of large-scale <b>public</b> <b>building’s</b> CAC loads will be set up in Section  5.

With profits from the Gilbert and Sullivan operas and his concert and lecture agency, he bought property along the Strand in 1880 with frontage onto the Thames Embankment, where he built the Savoy Theatre in 1881. Carte chose the name in honour of the Savoy Palace, which had been built on the site in the thirteenth century by Peter, Count of Savoy. It later passed to John of Gaunt but was destroyed in the Peasants' Revolt in 1381. The Savoy Theatre was a state-of-the-art facility, setting a new standard for technology, comfort and decor. It was the first <b>public</b> <b>building</b> in the world to be lit entirely by electric lights and seated nearly 1,300 people (compared to the Opera Comique's 862).|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} years of the Supreme Court, {{business}} was conducted at a variety of locations in downtown Salem. The first <b>public</b> <b>building</b> to house the court was the Territorial Capitol Building in Salem that was built between 1854 and 1855. In that building the courtroom was in a chamber measuring 20 feet by 27 feet on the first floor. On December 29, 1855, after the building was partially occupied, it burned to the ground. In 1876, the state finished construction on a second capitol building where the court was located on the third floor. This courtroom measured 54 feet by 46 feet, while the state law library was 75 feet by 70 feet. A separate building was built by the state in 1914 to house the Supreme Court, and this is now the oldest building on the Capitol Mall after the second capitol building burned down on April 25, 1935.|$|E
