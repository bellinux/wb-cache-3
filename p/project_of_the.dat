5|$|Another <b>project</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Laboratory for Nuclear Science was a {{synchrotron}} particle accelerator, {{which was}} designed to accelerate electrons to an energy of 350MeV. The accelerator was funded by the Office of Naval Research and built under the supervision of Ivan A. Getting, who was a professor of electrical engineering and had worked at the Radiation Laboratory on the extremely successful SCR‑584 radar. Although its construction began in 1946, the accelerator had not begun to work by 1949. In response, Zacharias asked Sands to assist. This was Sands's introduction to accelerator physics, and with his help the machine became operational early in 1950.|$|E
