40|$|Relative <b>permeabilities</b> {{are widely}} used by the {{petroleum}} industry in reservoir simulations of recovery strategies. In recent years, pore level modeling {{has been used to}} determine relative <b>permeabilities</b> at zero capillary number for a variety of more and more realistic model porous media. Unfortunately, these studies cannot address the issue of the observed capillary number dependence of the relative <b>permeabilities.</b> Several years ago, we presented a method for determining the relative <b>permeabilities</b> from pore-level modeling at general capillary number. We have used this method to determine the relative <b>permeabilities</b> at several capillary numbers and stable viscosity ratios. In addition, we have determined these relative <b>permeabilities</b> using one of the standard dynamic methods for determining relative <b>permeabilities</b> from core flood experiments. Our results from the two methods are compared {{with each other and with}} experimental results...|$|R

5|$|Most polar {{molecules}} {{have low}} solubility in the hydrocarbon {{core of a}} lipid bilayer and, as a consequence, have low <b>permeability</b> coefficients across the bilayer. This effect is particularly pronounced for charged species, which have even lower <b>permeability</b> coefficients than neutral polar molecules. Anions typically have {{a higher rate of}} diffusion through bilayers than cations. Compared to ions, water molecules actually have a relatively large <b>permeability</b> through the bilayer, as evidenced by osmotic swelling. When a cell or vesicle with a high interior salt concentration is placed in a solution with a low salt concentration it will swell and eventually burst. Such a result would not be observed unless water was able to pass through the bilayer with relative ease. The anomalously large <b>permeability</b> of water through bilayers is still not completely understood and continues to be the subject of active debate. Small uncharged apolar molecules diffuse through lipid bilayers many orders of magnitude faster than ions or water. This applies both to fats and organic solvents like chloroform and ether. Regardless of their polar character larger molecules diffuse more slowly across lipid bilayers than small molecules.|$|E

25|$|MMP-3 {{also does}} {{damage to the}} blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB), the {{functional}} equivalent of the blood-brain barrier, after spinal cord injury (SCI). In a similar study conducted using MMP-3 WT and KO mice, MMP-3 was shown to increase BSCB <b>permeability,</b> with the WT mice showing greater BSCB <b>permeability</b> than the KO mice after spinal cord injury. The same study also found decreased BSCB <b>permeability</b> when spinal cord tissues were treated with a MMP-3 inhibitor.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a determination of}} critical gas saturations and relative <b>permeabilities</b> relevant to the depressurisation of two North Sea fields. A series of reservoir condition coreflood experiments and associated numerical simulations is described. Four experiments were conducted with aged cores and fluids and each comprised of a waterflood, followed by depressurisation at different rates. The laboratory data included extensive three-phase, in-situ saturation measurements which were used to derive gas relative <b>permeabilities</b> through the simulations. The rate dependent critical gas saturations varied between 0. 03 and 0. 21 and gas relative <b>permeabilities</b> {{of the order of}} 0. 0001 were deduced. These laboratory results are consistent with published data and demonstrate that conventional Corey-type gas relative <b>permeabilities</b> are an order of magnitude too large and do not represent the depressurisation process. ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{characterization}} of gas permeation through Nafion, {{the most commonly used}} polymer electrolyte membrane (PEMs) for low-temperature fuel cells and water electrolyzers. In {{the first part of this}} study, novel modifications of the electrochemical monitoring technique to precisely measure the hydrogen and oxygen <b>permeabilities</b> of Nafion are presented. With these techniques, the gas <b>permeabilities</b> of Nafion were observed to be independent of pressures, which was ascribed to a solely diffusive process. Moreover, the temperature dependence of the hydrogen and oxygen <b>permeabilities</b> through Nafion in the fully hydrated state (where the water content is independent of the temperature) were measured in order to determine the activation energies of the permeation mechanisms. On the basis of the measured influence of temperature and relative humidity on the gas <b>permeabilities</b> of Nafion, the pathways for gas permeation through its aqueous and solid phase are qualitatively discussed. The second part of this study presents a resistor network model to quantitatively correlate the microscopic structure of Nafion and its gas <b>permeabilities...</b>|$|R

25|$|In {{addition}} to anisotropy {{in the electric}} polarizability (electric susceptibility), anisotropy in the magnetic polarizability (magnetic <b>permeability)</b> can also cause birefringence.

25|$|Due to {{the strong}} depolarization, the <b>permeability</b> of the {{membrane}} for potassium ions increases fast, resulting in a potassium reflux to release the positive charge out of the cell. Not only the <b>permeability</b> for potassium ions but also the <b>permeability</b> for calcium ions increases {{as a result of}} the depolarization of the membrane. A calcium influx takes place. The increase of the calcium concentration in the cell stimulates the release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine into the synaptic cleft. Acetylcholine binds to acetylcholine receptors at the postsynaptic membrane to open the sodium-channels there, generating a new action potential.|$|E

25|$|Scientists {{previously}} {{believed that}} the skin was an effective barrier to inorganic particles. Damage from mechanical stressors {{was believed to be}} the only way to increase its <b>permeability.</b> Recently, however, simpler and more effective methods for increasing skin <b>permeability</b> have been developed. For example, ultraviolet radiation (UVR) has been used to slightly damage the surface of skin, causing a time-dependent defect allowing easier penetration of nanoparticles. The UVR’s high energy causes a restructuring of cells, weakening the boundary between the stratum corneum and the epidermal layer. The damage of the skin is typically measured by the transepidermal water loss (TEWL), though it may take 3–5 days for the TEWL to reach its peak value. When the TEWL reaches its highest value, the maximum density of nanoparticles is able to permeate the skin. Studies confirm that UVR damaged skin significantly increases the <b>permeability.</b> The effects of increased <b>permeability</b> after UVR exposure can lead to an increase in the number of particles that permeate the skin. However, the specific <b>permeability</b> of skin after UVR exposure relative to particles of different sizes and materials has not been determined.|$|E

The effect of wettability alteration on gas and water relative <b>permeabilities</b> shows a trend similar to that for gas and oil relative <b>permeabilities</b> (see Fig.  9 b). Residual water saturation decreased from 0.45 to 0.35  PV. Water saturation at the cross point, krg = krw, for treated cores was less than 0.4  PV, implying gas-wetting. This result {{is in line with}} the spontaneous imbibition measurements. These results imply that gas well deliverability may increase substantially when wettability is altered to intermediate gas-wetting.|$|R

Due to relatively high crystallinity, in combination with the ability of the nanofibers to form a dense network held together by strong inter-fibrillar bonds (high cohesive energy density), {{it has been suggested that}} nanocellulose might act as a barrier material. Although the number of reported oxygen <b>permeability</b> values are limited, reports attribute high oxygen barrier properties to nanocellulose films. One study reported an oxygen <b>permeability</b> of 0.0006 (cm3µm)/(m2daykPa) for a ca. 5µm thin nanocellulose film at 23°C and 0% RH.

Another disadvantage is that the relative <b>permeabilities</b> only can be determined for the usually small saturation interval outside the shock. We present a method to interpret displacement experiments with the capillary pressure included, using in-situ measurements of saturations and phase pressures.
