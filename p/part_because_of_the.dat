5|$|A {{possible}} way to detect an eruption is studying Silverthrone's geological history since every volcano {{has its own}} pattern of behavior, {{in terms of its}} eruption style, magnitude and frequency, so that its future eruption is expected to be similar to its previous eruptions. But this would likely be abandoned in <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> volcano's remoteness.|$|E

5|$|Law {{enforcement}} at {{the county}} level, {{and to some degree}} at the state level, became notoriously tolerant of the illegal activities in Galveston, in no small <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prosperity they generated, and the bribery and influence peddled by the Maceos. The city police very early on became entirely complicit.|$|E

5000|$|Durand's {{inspiration}} for the poem was a marabou woman named Marie Noel Belizaire—nicknamed Choucoune—who ran a restaurant in Cap-Haïtien. She met Durand, and the two had a romantic liaison. In the poem, Choucoune deserts the poet for a Frenchman's favors. Reportedly the real Choucoune and Durand <b>parted</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> poet's serial philandering.|$|R

It has a cruciform plan, with five bays, and north and south two-bay transepts. Each bay contains a large round-headed window with a sandstone archivolt; in the west bay the window is divided into two <b>parts</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gallery. <b>The</b> west front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church is rendered, and has a bellcote on the gable, and a semicircular Tuscan porch.|$|R
5|$|In 1945, much of {{the area}} that forms today's Cleland Conservation Park was {{purchased}} by the State Government, in large <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lobbying efforts of Professor Sir John Cleland. Most of this land, including the Waterfall Gully area, was later combined in 1963 to create the park that extends eastwards up into the hills to the summit of Mount Lofty and northwards to Greenhill Road. During 1943, the Municipality of Burnside was proclaimed the City of Burnside.|$|E
5|$|In {{the board}} (and card) game domain, 4X {{is less of}} a {{distinct}} genre, in <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> practical constraints of components and playing time. The Civilization board game that gave rise to Sid Meier's Civilization computer game, for instance, has no exploration and no extermination. Unless extermination is targeted at non-player entities, it tends to be either nearly impossible (because of play balance mechanisms, since player elimination is usually considered an undesirable feature) or certainly unachievable (because victory conditions are triggered before extermination can be completed) in board games.|$|E
5|$|Often in <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{threat of}} hurricanes, many coastal regions had sparse {{population}} between major ports until {{the advent of}} automobile tourism; therefore, the most severe portions of hurricanes striking the coast may have gone unmeasured in some instances. The combined effects of ship destruction and remote landfall severely {{limit the number of}} intense hurricanes in the official record before the era of hurricane reconnaissance aircraft and satellite meteorology. Although the record shows a distinct increase in the number and strength of intense hurricanes, therefore, experts regard the early data as suspect.|$|E

5|$|Richard Nixon: The Shaping of His Character was {{published}} in late 1981 and received reviews less enthusiastic than any of her earlier books. Writing in The New Republic, Godfrey Hodgson questioned both her psychoanalytic approach and her motives: “e {{are in danger of}} having the insights of psychotherapy used as a tool for character destruction, certainly for libel, potentially for revenge.” Sales of the book were disappointing, in <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reviews, in part because memoirs by Nixon associates such as Henry Kissinger, John Ehrlichman, and John Dean had recently flooded the market. Perhaps Brodie’s book was most influential in stimulating Oliver Stone to create his controversial 1995 movie Nixon.|$|E
5|$|Some systems use {{parametric}} equalization in {{an attempt}} to correct for room frequency response irregularities. Equalization is often unable to achieve flat frequency response at all listening locations in <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> resonance (i.e., standing wave) patterns at low frequencies in nearly all rooms. Careful positioning of the subwoofer within the room can also help flatten the frequency response. Multiple subwoofers can manage a flatter general response since they can often be arranged to excite room modes more evenly than a single subwoofer, allowing equalization to be more effective.|$|E
5|$|The TRC {{concluded}} {{that it may be}} impossible to ever identify the number of deaths or missing children, in <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> habit of burying students in unmarked graves. The work is further complicated by a pattern of poor record keeping by school and government officials, who neglected to keep reliable numbers about the number of children who died or where they were buried. While most schools had cemeteries on site, their location and extent remain difficult to determine as cemeteries that were originally marked were found to have been later razed, intentionally hidden or built over.|$|E

5|$|The major {{legitimate}} businesses on the island, such as {{banking and}} hotels, {{were able to}} thrive in large <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> illegal activities. Though many of these business leaders steered clear of direct involvement in the business affairs of the Maceos and the gangs, their relationships were hardly antagonistic. Some, such as financier, hotelier, and insurance executive William Lewis Moody, Jr., actually welcomed illegal gambling because it brought tourists who filled up his hotels. He was even known to make loans to the Maceos' syndicate.|$|E
5|$|Various {{authors have}} {{proposed}} slightly different {{analyses of the}} Khmer vowel system. This may be in <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wide degree of variation in pronunciation between individual speakers, even within a dialectal region. The description below follows Huffman (1970). The number of vowel nuclei and their values vary between dialects; differences exist even between the Standard Khmer system {{and that of the}} Battambang dialect on which the standard is based.|$|E
5|$|Akishio {{took part}} in the Pacific Reach 2000 drills, which took place from 2 to 14 October 2000, off of Singapore. The navies of the United States, Japan, Singapore, and South Korea took <b>part.</b> <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kursk {{submarine}} disaster which had happened earlier that year, the Pacific Reach 2000 drills involved submarine rescue exercises, which Akishio performed in. This was the first time Japanese ships had taken part in a multilateral submarine rescue drill, although they had taken part in similar exercises bilaterally, with the US Navy. Japan's constitution places limits on their ability to perform collective-defence drills. Because of this, Japan joined the drills from a humanitarian standpoint, rather than a military one.|$|E

50|$|The most {{conspicuous}} and dominant physical features are the numerous hills {{found in all}} parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city.

5|$|American kestrels feed {{largely on}} small {{animals such as}} grasshoppers, dragonflies, lizards, mice, voles, and small birds. The kestrel has also been {{reported}} to have killed snakes, bats, and squirrels. The kestrel is able to maintain high population densities, at least in <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> broad scope of its diet. The American kestrel's primary mode of hunting is by perching and waiting for prey to come near. The bird is characteristically seen along roadsides or fields perched on objects such as trees, overhead power lines, or fence posts. It also hunts by kiting, hovering {{in the air with}} rapid wing beats and scanning the ground for prey. Other hunting techniques include low flight over fields, or chasing insects and birds in the air.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{continued}} defacement, fans rushed to the sites of the installments as soon as they are announced. A group of men took advantage of this and threatened to deface a stencil painting of a beaver in East New York, charging money for people to take photographs. Some took {{matters into their own hands}} by guarding the works, others restoring them once defaced. In <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> defacement, but also because of the great value of the artworks, property owners have also gone to extreme measures to protect the art. Some hired security guards, others covered the art with acrylic glass, and yet others installed metal roll-down gates.|$|E
5|$|As the 1990s began, Pei transitioned into a role of {{decreased}} {{involvement with}} his firm. The staff {{had begun to}} shrink, and Pei wanted to dedicate himself to smaller projects allowing for more creativity. Before he made this change, however, he set {{to work on his}} last major project as active partner: The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio. Considering his work on such bastions of high culture as the Louvre and US National Gallery, some critics were surprised by his association with what many considered a tribute to low culture. The sponsors of the hall, however, sought Pei for specifically this reason; they wanted the building to have an aura of respectability from the beginning. As in the past, Pei accepted the commission in <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> unique challenge it presented.|$|E
