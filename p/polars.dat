5|$|Before {{accretion}} {{of material}} pushes a white dwarf {{close to the}} Chandrasekhar limit, accreted hydrogen-rich material on the surface may ignite in a less destructive type of thermonuclear explosion powered by hydrogen fusion. These surface explosions can be repeated {{as long as the}} white dwarf's core remains intact. This weaker kind of repetitive cataclysmic phenomenon is called a (classical) nova. Astronomers have also observed dwarf novae, which have smaller, more frequent luminosity peaks than the classical novae. These are thought to be caused by the release of gravitational potential energy when part of the accretion disc collapses onto the star, rather than through a release of energy due to fusion. In general, binary systems with a white dwarf accreting matter from a stellar companion are called cataclysmic variables. As well as novae and dwarf novae, several other classes of these variables are known, including <b>polars</b> and intermediate <b>polars,</b> both of which feature highly magnetic white dwarfs. Both fusion- and accretion-powered cataclysmic variables have been observed to be X-ray sources.|$|E
5|$|While RR Telescopii, also {{designated}} Nova Telescopii 1948, {{is often}} called a slow nova, it is now classified as a symbiotic nova system composed of an M5III pulsating red giant and a white dwarf; between 1944 and 1948 it brightened by about 7 magnitudes before being noticed at apparent magnitude 6.0 in mid-1948. It has since faded slowly to about apparent magnitude 12. QS Telescopii is a binary system composed of a white dwarf and main sequence donor star, {{in this case the}} two are close enough to be tidally locked, facing one another. Known as <b>polars,</b> material from the donor star does not form an accretion disk around the white dwarf, but rather streams directly onto it. This is due to the presence of the white dwarf's strong magnetic field.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—New {{decoding}} {{methods for}} <b>polar</b> codes {{are derived from}} a multi-dimensional realization of <b>polar</b> codes. The notion of <b>polar</b> transformation is extended into higher dimensional <b>polar</b> transformations. It is shown that two dimensional <b>polar</b> transfor-mation leads to a rate-adaptive doubly concatenated <b>polar</b> code. The results are generalized to n-dimensional construction and decoding of <b>polar</b> codes, where N 2 n is {{the length of the}} code. The proposed structure for successive cancellation decoding, based on the n-dimensional construction of <b>polar</b> codes, results in efficient decoding latency and space complexity.

25|$|This {{definition}} {{implies that}} the hyperbola is both the locus of the poles of the tangent lines to the circle B, {{as well as the}} envelope of the polar lines of the points on B. Conversely, the circle B is the envelope of <b>polars</b> of points on the hyperbola, and the locus of poles of tangent lines to the hyperbola. Two tangent lines to B have no (finite) poles because they pass through the center C of the reciprocation circle C; the <b>polars</b> of the corresponding tangent points on B are the asymptotes of the hyperbola. The two branches of the hyperbola correspond to the two parts of the circle B that are separated by these tangent points.|$|E

40|$|Large ion outflow {{velocity}} variation at <b>POLAR</b> apogee {{have been}} observed. The observed H+ flow velocities {{were in the}} range of 23 - 110 km/s and 0 + flow velocities were {{in the range of}} 5 - 25 km/s. These velocity ranges lie between those predicted by simulations of the photoelectron-driven <b>polar</b> wind and "baseline" <b>polar</b> wind. The electric current contributions of the photoelectrons and <b>polar</b> rain are expected to control the size and altitude of an electric potential drop which accelerates the <b>polar</b> wind at relatively high altitudes. In this presentation, we compare <b>polar</b> wind characteristics observed near 5000 km and 8 RE altitudes by the Thermal Ion Dynamics Experiment (TIDE) with measurements of low-energy electrons sampled by HYDRA, both from the <b>POLAR</b> spacecraft, to examine possible effects of the <b>polar</b> rain and photoelectrons on the <b>polar</b> wind. Both correlations and anti-correlations are found between the <b>polar</b> wind velocities and the <b>polar</b> rain fluxes at <b>POLAR</b> apogee during different <b>polar</b> cap crossings. Also, the low-altitude upward/downward photoelectron spectra are used to estimates the potential drops above the spacecraft. We interpret these observations in terms of the effects that both photoelectrons and <b>polar</b> rain may have on the electric potential and <b>polar</b> wind acceleration along <b>polar</b> cap magnetic field lines...|$|R
500|$|RZ Gruis is {{a binary}} system of {{apparent}} magnitude 12.3 with occasional dimming to 13.4, whose components—a white dwarf and main sequence star—are thought to orbit each other roughly every 8.5 to 10 [...] hours. It {{belongs to the}} UX Ursae Majoris subgroup of cataclysmic variable star systems, where material from the donor star is drawn to the white dwarf where it forms an accretion disc that remains bright and outshines the two component stars. The system is poorly understood, though the donor star has been calculated to be of spectral type F5V. These stars have spectra very similar to novae that have returned to quiescence after outbursts, yet {{they have not been}} observed to have erupted themselves. The American Association of Variable Star Observers recommends watching them for future events. CE Gruis (also known as Grus V-1) is a faint (magnitude 18–21) star system also composed of a white dwarf and donor star; in this case the two are so close they are tidally locked. Known as <b>polars,</b> material from the donor star does not form an accretion disc around the white dwarf, but rather streams directly onto it.|$|E
