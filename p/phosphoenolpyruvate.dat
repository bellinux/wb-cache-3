5|$|Making these {{predictions}} is not trivial, {{even for}} simple systems. For example, oxaloacetate is formed by malate dehydrogenase within the mitochondrion. Oxaloacetate {{can then be}} consumed by citrate synthase, <b>phosphoenolpyruvate</b> carboxykinase or aspartate aminotransferase, feeding into the citric acid cycle, gluconeogenesis or aspartic acid biosynthesis, respectively. Being able to predict how much oxaloacetate goes into which pathway requires knowledge of the concentration of oxaloacetate {{as well as the}} concentration and kinetics of each of these enzymes. This aim of predicting the behaviour of metabolic pathways reaches its most complex expression in the synthesis of huge amounts of kinetic and gene expression data into mathematical models of entire organisms. Alternatively, one useful simplification of the metabolic modelling problem is to ignore the underlying enzyme kinetics and only rely on information about the reaction network's stoichiometry, a technique called flux balance analysis.|$|E
5|$|Activation of AMPK was {{required}} for metformin's inhibitory effect on liver glucose production. AMPK is an enzyme that {{plays an important role}} in insulin signaling, whole body energy balance and the metabolism of glucose and fats. AMPK Activation {{was required}} for an increase in the expression of small heterodimer partner, which in turn inhibited the expression of the hepatic gluconeogenic genes <b>phosphoenolpyruvate</b> carboxykinase and glucose 6-phosphatase. Metformin is frequently used in research along with AICA ribonucleotide as an AMPK agonist. Mouse models in which the genes for AMPKα1 and α2 catalytic subunits (Prkaa1/2) or LKB1, an upstream kinase of AMPK, had been knocked out in hepatocytes, have raised doubts over the role of AMPK, since the effect of metformin was not abolished by loss of AMPK function. The mechanism by which biguanides increase the activity of AMPK remains uncertain; however, metformin increases the concentration of cytosolic adenosine monophosphate (AMP) (as opposed to a change in total AMP or total AMP/adenosine triphosphate). Increased cellular AMP has been proposed to explain the inhibition of glucagon-induced increase in cAMP and activation of PKA. Metformin and other biguanides may antagonize the action of glucagon, thus reducing fasting glucose levels. Metformin also induces a profound shift in the faecal microbial community profile in diabetic mice and this may contribute to its mode of action possibly through an effect on glucagon-like peptide-1 secretion.|$|E
25|$|<b>Phosphoenolpyruvate</b> carboxykinase (PEPCK) is {{an enzyme}} in the lyase family {{used in the}} {{metabolic}} pathway of gluconeogenesis. It converts oxaloacetate into <b>phosphoenolpyruvate</b> and carbon dioxide.|$|E

25|$|X-ray crystallographic {{studies of}} {{glyphosate}} and EPSPS show that glyphosate functions by occupying the binding {{site of the}} <b>phosphoenolpyruvate,</b> mimicking an intermediate state of the ternary enzyme–substrate complex. Glyphosate inhibits the EPSPS enzymes of different species of plants and microbes at different rates.|$|E
25|$|In bacteria, protists, fungi, and plants, {{melatonin}} is synthesized indirectly with tryptophan as {{an intermediate}} product of the shikimate pathway. In these cells, synthesis starts with D-erythrose 4-phosphate and <b>phosphoenolpyruvate,</b> and in photosynthetic cells with carbon dioxide. The rest of the synthesising reactions are similar, but with slight variations {{in the last two}} enzymes.|$|E
25|$|Hydrazine sulfate was {{specifically}} {{developed as a}} result of a proposal by Joseph Gold for a therapy that could offset the rapid loss of weight that occurs in cancer (cancer cachexia). This hypothesis was based on the fact that cancer cells are often unusually dependent on glycolysis for energy (the Warburg effect), Gold proposed that the body might offset this increased glycolysis using gluconeogenesis, which is the pathway that is the reverse of glycolysis. Since this process would require a great deal of energy, Gold thought that inhibiting gluconeogenesis might reverse this energy requirement and be an effective treatment for cancer cachexia. Hydrazine is a reactive chemical that in the test tube can inactivate one of the enzymes needed for gluconeogenesis, <b>phosphoenolpyruvate</b> carboxykinase (PEP-CK). It was also postulated that if tumor energy gain (glycolysis) and host-energy loss (gluconeogenesis) were functionally interrelated, inhibition of gluconeogenesis at PEP CK could result in actual tumor regression in addition to reversal or arrest of cancer cachexia. In this model, hydrazine sulfate is therefore thought to act by irreversibly inhibiting the enzyme <b>phosphoenolpyruvate</b> carboxykinase.|$|E
25|$|Narrower stomatal {{apertures}} {{can be used}} {{in conjunction}} with an intermediary molecule with a high carbon dioxide affinity, PEPcase (<b>Phosphoenolpyruvate</b> carboxylase). Retrieving the products of carbon fixation from PEPCase is an energy-intensive process, however. As a result, the PEPCase alternative is preferable only where water is limiting but light is plentiful, or where high temperatures increase the solubility of oxygen relative to that of carbon dioxide, magnifying RuBisCo's oxygenation problem.|$|E
25|$|This is well {{illustrated}} by the monosaccharide uptake system in Amanita muscaria. Carbon uptake requires a transporter, AmMST1, that is only expressed when the fungus is cultured at low glucose levels in multiple mycorrhizal associations. This expression, and increased import of monosaccharides by the fungus, is met {{with an increase in}} the supply of photoassimilates from the plant host. In the reverse direction, <b>phosphoenolpyruvate</b> carboxylase (PEPC) moderates the assimilation of ammonium and the transport of amino acids from fungus to plant.|$|E
25|$|Glyphosate kills {{plants by}} {{interfering with the}} {{synthesis}} of the aromatic amino acids phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan in the shikimate pathway. It does this by inhibiting the enzyme 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS), which catalyzes the reaction of shikimate-3-phosphate (S3P) and <b>phosphoenolpyruvate</b> to form 5-enolpyruvyl-shikimate-3-phosphate (EPSP). Glyphosate is absorbed through foliage and minimally through roots, meaning {{that it is only}} effective on actively growing plants and cannot prevent seeds from germinating. After application, glyphosate is readily transported around the plant to growing roots and leaves and this systemic activity is important for its effectiveness. Inhibiting the enzyme causes shikimate to accumulate in plant tissues and diverts energy and resources away from other processes. While growth stops within hours of application, it takes several days for the leaves to begin turning yellow.|$|E
500|$|In C4 plants, sodium is a {{micronutrient}} {{that aids}} metabolism, specifically in regeneration of <b>phosphoenolpyruvate</b> and synthesis of chlorophyll. In others, it substitutes for potassium in several roles, such as maintaining turgor pressure and aiding {{in the opening}} and closing of stomata. Excess sodium in the soil can limit [...] the uptake of water by decreasing the water potential, which may result in plant wilting; excess concentrations in the cytoplasm can lead to enzyme inhibition, which in turn causes necrosis and chlorosis. In response, some plants have developed mechanisms to limit sodium uptake in the roots, to store it in cell vacuoles, and restrict salt transport from roots to leaves; excess sodium may also be stored in old plant tissue, limiting the damage to new growth. Halophytes have adapted {{to be able to}} flourish in sodium rich environments.|$|E

2500|$|Pyruvate kinase enzyme catalyzes {{the last}} step of glycolysis, in which {{pyruvate}} and ATP are formed. [...] Pyruvate kinase catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from <b>phosphoenolpyruvate</b> (PEP) to ADP, yielding one molecule of pyruvate and one molecule of ATP.|$|E
2500|$|PEPCK (...) is one {{of three}} {{decarboxylation}} enzymes used in the inorganic carbon concentrating mechanisms of C4 and CAM plants. The others are NADP-malic enzyme and NAD-malic enzyme. In C4 carbon fixation, carbon dioxide is first fixed by combination with <b>phosphoenolpyruvate</b> to form oxaloacetate in the mesophyll. In PEPCK-type C4 plants the oxaloacetate is then converted to aspartate, which travels to the bundle sheath. [...] In the bundle sheath cells, aspartate is converted back to oxaloacetate. PEPCK decarboxylates the bundle sheath oxaloacetate, releasing carbon dioxide, which is then fixed by the enzyme Rubisco.|$|E
2500|$|Liver {{pyruvate}} kinase is indirectly regulated by epinephrine and glucagon, through protein kinase A. This protein kinase phosphorylates liver {{pyruvate kinase}} to deactivate it. Muscle pyruvate kinase is not inhibited by epinephrine activation of protein kinase A. Glucagon signals fasting (no glucose available). Thus, glycolysis is inhibited {{in the liver}} but unaffected in muscle when fasting. [...] An increase in blood sugar leads to secretion of insulin, which activates phosphoprotein phosphatase I, leading to dephosphorylation and activation of pyruvate kinase. These controls prevent pyruvate kinase from being active {{at the same time}} as the enzymes that catalyze the reverse reaction (pyruvate carboxylase and <b>phosphoenolpyruvate</b> carboxykinase), preventing a futile cycle.|$|E
2500|$|RuBisCO is {{important}} biologically because it catalyzes the primary chemical reaction by which inorganic carbon enters the organic biosphere. [...] While many autotrophic bacteria and archaea fix carbon via the reductive acetyl CoA pathway, the 3-hydroxypropionate cycle, or the reverse Krebs cycle, these pathways are relatively smaller contributors to global carbon fixation than that catalyzed by RuBisCO. <b>Phosphoenolpyruvate</b> carboxylase, unlike RuBisCO, only temporarily fixes carbon. Reflecting its importance, RuBisCO {{is the most}} abundant protein in leaves, accounting for 50% of soluble leaf protein in [...] plants (20–30% of total leaf nitrogen) and 30% of soluble leaf protein in [...] plants (5–9% of total leaf nitrogen).
