40|$|The {{complexity}} of behaviour necessitates {{a clear and}} concise approach in order to comprehend its functioning. An example of such an approach is highlighted by the field of cybernetics. Cybernetic models have been used extensively throughout the various fields of Psychology but perhaps never more so {{as in the case}} of short term memory (STM). This particular field abounds with behavioural models and research workers are constantly developing new models or testing the unviversality of existing models. Universal validity is essential to the strength of the behavioural principles inherent in any model but unfortunately such validity tends to be neglected. The present study attempts to reconcile this position with reference to specific models of STM, with relation to the phenomena of eidetic imagery (EI). Certain studies concerning the incidence of EI in illiterate Africans have produced results which are contradictory to those obtained in the Western culture. Two of the most important contradictions concern the fact that the illiterate Africans experienced the absence of an age parameter on the occurrence of such imagery and the fact that the incidence of imagery was more extensive in the African culture. A reason for these contradictions was sought and it was reasoned that as eidetic images have been closely linked with memory images, it may, therefore, be assumed that these particular cultures may use EI as an aid to memory in the absence of written material. Further, it would not be unreasonable to assume that this visual imagery may tend to dominate the STM process and thereby challenge the universality of those memory models that proposed acoustic domination of this process. No work has been done in investigating the memory process of the Africans. Thus, a study which did so would not only test the universality of specific memory models but would also possibly throw more light on the memory process itself. In this particular study there were three specific aims; (a) to ascertain the relative incidence of EI on a cross-cultural level, (b) to assess the influence of EI on the memory process, and (c) to ascertain the extent to which principles of STM developed in the West applied to the African groups. The groups concerned in the study comprised two Xhosa groups and a European group. The European group (WS) was drawn from a White Student population at Rhodes University and was regarded as a control group. The equivalent literate Xhosa group (BS) was drawn from a Black Student population at the University of Fort Hare. The illiterate Xhosa group (RX) was drawn from a population of Red Xhosa people in the Transkei. Four tasks were administered to the groups with the cross-cultural variable carefully controlled as much as possible. The following comprised the four tasks; (a) eidetic imagery (b) auditory serial recall (c) visual serial recall and (d) an acoustic confusable task. Each subject commenced with the eidetic imagery task and was then confronted with a random presentation of the other three tasks. The EI task began with an after image task which was foIlowed by three selected pictures which comprised the EI task. After each picture presentation the subject was closely questioned as to the presence of imagery. Scoring was of a subjective nature. The visual and acoustic confusion tasks constituted serial presentation of ten items over six randomized trials. Each item was presented for 0, 75 seconds with a negligible inter-item interval. The presentation order of the items was randomized throughout the trials. Presentation was by means of a preprogrammed 16 mm colour film. Items were scored for correct serial position. The auditory task consisted of the serial presentation of ten items over six randomized trials. The items were once again randomized throughout the trials with regards to presentation order. The presentation speed was one word per second. The presentation was by means of a pre-programmed tape. Items were scored for correct serial position. The visual task was common to both language groups whilst the other two tasks correIated with the language group. Thus, the items in the auditory and acoustic confusion tasks were different for each language but an attempt was made to control this variable. The tasks were conducted in the subjects home languagc which was either Xhosa or English. It was assumed that the RX group would demonstrate a greater incidence of EI, irrespective of the age of the subject, and that imagery would be reflected in the recall performance of the memory tasks. It was suggested that imagery may determine or encourage the mode of storage that the subject cmployed, which, in this case, would be the visual modality. If so then it would be expected that visual storage would circumvent the detrimental influence of acoustic confusability. The Xhosa university group (BS) was an unknown quantity but was included to ascertain whether there were any marked differences between the group and the other two. The results revealed that imagery was in fact more prevalent in the Xhosa groups whilst the WS group demonstrated a complete lack of EI but did report the presence of pictorial imagery (PI). However, imagery did not appear to function as an aid to memory. It seemed, however, that in certain instances it correlated with visual encoding. Generally the Xhosa subjects, especially with regards to the visual tasks, tended to encode visually whilst the WS group encoded auditorily. With reference to recall performance, it was found that in all instances the WS group demonstrated superior recall followed by the BS and RX groups in that order. There was a significant difference in the strength of recall between each of the groups. The results of the auditory and visual tasks were interpreted within the STM principles developed in the West. It was found that the WS group adhered to these principles thereby justifying its position as a central group. The BS group followed a similar pattern with exception to the recency effect which was much weaker in their case. The RX group reported the absence of any storage and rehearsal strategies and this was reflected in their poor recall performance. They too were characterized by a very weak recency effect. The interesting point arose, however, when the auditory and visual recency effects were compared. According to Crawder and Norton (1969) the influence or the precategorical acoustic store (PAS) on recall should be reflected by a comparatively stronger auditory recency effect. This trend was observed in relation to the WS group but not to the Xhosa groups who tended to demonstrate a stronger visual recency effect. It was therefore, suspected that PAS did not operate with the same effectiveness with the Xhosa subjects. In fact it was suggested that in the case of the Xhosa subjects the visual <b>peripheral</b> <b>store</b> may be stronger than PAS. Contrary to expectation all three groups exhibited acoustic confusion. This was expected of the WS group as the subjects preferred auditory storage, but not of the Xhosa subjects who preferred visual storage. It was suggested however, that in the case of the Xhosa subjects the visual storage technique would have to be abandoned immediately prior to or during recall as recall was necessarily in the auditory modality. The outcome of the experiment generally confirmed Doab's conclusions as to the incidence of imagery and its relation with memory. However, due to the Xhosa preference for visual storage and their stronger visual recency effect, Sperling's model was slightly modified. Conrad 's findings were, of course, substantiated.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the problem of defining the processes by which a subject selects a response to a stimulus. Initially certain topics in two areas of research, sensory scaling and threshold measurement, are revived. In relation to the first the conflict between Fechner's law, which is derived from threshold measurements, and the more recent 'power law' given by 'direct methods' of scaling, is examined. It is shown that this conflict is due not to differences in the data from which the laws are derived, but to differences in the assumptions underlying the treatment of the data, and it is suggested that the logarithmic function may prove more useful for explaining a number of the findings in experiments on scaling, and that the same central effect of the stimulus say be considered to determine the response whether scales are being derived or thresholds measured. A short account of the development of models of the sensory discrimination process is then given, and evidence is reviewed which appears sufficient to justify applying the theory of signal-detection to the sensory threshold, and rejecting the neural quantum theory. To investigate the threshold mechanism further it was decided to examine the effect of an accessory stimulus given in controlled temporal relation to a critical stimulus on the threshold for the latter. The first experiment was an attempt to confirm Motokawa's finding (Gebhard, 1953) that sensitivity to an electric phosphene is affected a preceding flash of light, reaching a maximum 1 andndash; 3 seconds after the flash, the exact time depending on the colour of the light. The absolute threshold for the electric phosphene was measured by the method of limits at intervals of 1 andndash; 9 seconds after a flash of blue or white light. Motokawa found that sensitivity was maximal when the interval between the stimuli was 2 seconds for the white light, or 3 seconds for blue light. Neither particular could be confirmed. There was no peak of sensitivity in the range studied, nor was there any marked difference in the curves relating threshold level to inter-stimulus interval for the two colours of light. Instead a monotonic relation between threshold and inter-stimulus interval was found, for this range, the threshold falling as the inter-stimulus interval decreased, slowly at long intervals and more rapidly at the shorter ones. This raised two questions: why could Motokawa's findings not be confirmed? and what was the nature of the effect which had been found? The experimental technique of Motokawa and his colleagues is reviewed, and it is suggested that their findings mat be an artefact of certain features of their procedure, in particular the use of large steps where a threshold change is not expected, and small steps where a threshold is expected to appear. Two possibilities are considered for the threshold-lowering effect: it might depend on the use of two visual stimuli and reflect a peripheral interaction at the retina, or it might be a central effect, not specifically visual. To investigate this the light flash was replaced, in the second experiment, by the ring of a bell of the same duration and given at the same inter-stimulus intervals. The same threshold-lowering effect of the accessory stimulus was found as in the first experiment, showing that the effect could be produced by an accessory stimulus in another modality. Further support for this conclusion was provided by Experiment 3, in which both the light-flash and the bell were used, the former at the same intervals as in Experiment 1, but the latter always preceding the critical stimulus by 1 second. Here the threshold did not vary significantly: there was little or no residual effect of the light when the bell was given at a shorter inter-stimulus interval. It appeared that it was the interval of time since the most recent accessory stimulus, whatever its modality, that mainly determined {{the degree to which the}} threshold fell. In Experiment 4 the generality of the threshold-lowering effect was examined further. Using a visual accessory and auditory critical stimulus the possibility that the effect would occur only with visual critical stimuli was excluded. These findings raised two questions: What processes underlie the change in threshold? What determines the relation between threshold level and inter-stimulus interval? Possible answers to the first question were suggested in terms of the analysis offered by signal detection theory. In this theory it is assumed that the decision whether or not a stimulus has been administered is made by a process equivalent to comparing the afferent input with a criterion, and the criterion is computed in a way which may take account of the parameters, the variance (andsigma; 2) and mean (M), of the 'noise' and 'signal + noise' distributions. The possibilities considered were that a change was produced in the functioning of the afferent paths at the time that the message from the critical stimulus was travelling along them, equivalent to a reduction in andsigma; N or M N, with a consequent change in the value of the criterion, c, computed by the subject (a 'distribution effect'), or that the computation of c was affected directly (a 'criterion effect'). Two hypotheses were proposed in answer to the second question (the relation between threshold level and inter-stimulus interval) : (a) The accessory stimulus might have an 'arousing' or 'alerting' effect, causing an immediate central change with a small latency, which then decayed with time. (b) The subject might make use of the accessory stimulus as a 'temporal reference point' or 'warning'. By virtue of temporal information which he might possess he could use the accessory stimulus to determine when he could expect the critical stimulus to arrive. Here two subsidiary hypotheses might be suggested: (i) The subject lovers his threshold for the whole of the 'waiting time'. (ii) He may lover his threshold only when he expect the critical stimulus. Since his time-keeping ability is of limited precision, and the range of error will be greater for long times than for short, the 'range of expectation', if he allows for this, will be smaller the shorter the inter-stimulus interval. In either case, if the reduction in threshold is inversely related to the period for which it is reduced, a relation between threshold level and inter-stimulus interval of the sort found would be produced. In Experiment 5 an attempt was made to test the 'warning' hypothesis directly by using a small range of randomly varied inter-stimulus intervals instead of a single fixed interval as previously, in order to see whether a fall in threshold daring the 'range of expectation' could be demonstrated. Ranges of 0. 5 andndash; 1. 5 seconds were used but no consistent effect was found. In Experiment 6 the same procedure was used but the inter-stimulus intervals were varied at random over a large range andndash; 5 seconds andndash; to prevent the accessory stimulus providing temporal information. Though it was found that the fall in threshold previously shown o^er this range disappeared, the possibility that this was due to 'habituation' of an 'arousal response' could not be excluded. The exact relation between the fall in threshold and the inter-stimulus interval was next considered. It was suggested that a close and simple relation between the threshold and the 'just noticeable difference' for time discrimination would be difficult to reconcile with the arousal hypothesis, and would constitute evidence for the hypothesis of a 'range of expectation' Studies of temporal discrimination were briefly reviewed; it appeared that few results were in agreement, save that Weber's law had usually been found not to hold Since no reliable measures of the temporal differential threshold were available two experiments were performed to measure the j. n. d. in a situation as similar to Experiments 1, 2, and 4 as possible. In each case Weber's law was found to apply for a range of intervals from 0. 5 to 9 seconds. These experiments also provided new evidence on the causation of the classical 'indifference interval', and this was examined further in Experiment 9. It was found that the fall in threshold could be described as an inverse function of either the j. n. d. or the inter-stimulus interval itself, with the latter giving a possibly somewhat better fit. This suggested that the 'range of expectation' might be a constant proportion of the inter-stimulus interval, though the inverse function found was not necessarily incompatible with an arousal explanation. A threshold reduction consequent on a decrease in 'noise' (and 'signal + noise') variance should show a corresponding fall in threshold variance, whereas the variance might be expected to be constant if the threshold reduction were secondly to a change in M N or directly due to a change in c. In Experiment 10 this was examined using the method of constant stimuli. No significant decrease in the threshold variance was found; it appeared to be constant and there we evidence that rises might occur as the threshold fell. Explanations were offered for this finding. It was also shown that the fall in threshold could not be attributed to an increase in 'guessing'. The 'distribution' and 'criterion' hypotheses were tested, farther in Experiments 11, 12, and 14. On the 'distribution hypothesis' the threshold curve would be expected to show a minimum, with a rise in threshold at shorter intervals, due to the latency of any reflex effect on the afferent paths evoked by the accessory stimulus. In Experiment 11 inter-stimulus intervals ranging front 0. 0 andndash; 1. 5 seconds were used, but the threshold fell continuously to the zero interval. Experiment 12 tested the possibility that this was an artefact due to temporal information or arousal provided or caused by the pre-warning; but despite the use of pre warnings varied randomly over a range of 2 andndash; 7 seconds the fall in threshold at the zero interval was confirmed. It remained possible that the conduction of part at least of the afferent message from the critical stimulus might have been sufficiently slow to be affected by a rapid response to the simultaneous accessory stimulus. This was excluded by Experiment 14, which showed that an accessory stimulus administered as much as 500 andnbsp;msec. after the critical stimulus could lover the threshold for the latter. Thus it appeared that a direct effect was exerted on the computation of the criterion, and that stimulus traces could be kept in a short-term <b>peripheral</b> <b>store</b> for 0. 5 andndash; 1. 0 seconds, and could then benefit by a lowered decision criterion. Certain experiments in the literature bearing on the short-term store were discussed. The 'warning' and 'arousal' hypotheses were tested by an experiment for which the 'arousal' and 'waiting time' hypotheses on the one band and the 'range of expectation' hypothesis on the other made different predictions. In Experiment 13 thresholds determined with fixed inter-stimulus intervals were compared with the thresholds given when the inter-stimulus intervals were randomly varied over a small range, 1 second. On the assumption that subjects lowered their thresholds for a range of time about the expected time of arrival of the stimulus, it was predicted that the threshold would fall as the longer intervals decreased, but would be relatively constant at the shorter intervals. This prediction, which was not made by the 'arousal' or 'waiting time' hypotheses, was confirmed. Both arousal and warning hypotheses et a reduced threshold-lowering effect of accessory stimuli which are themselves within the absolute threshold range. A review of some relevant experiments showed that such an effect had not been satisfactorily established. In Experiment 15 its occurrence was demonstrated and a model was proposed to explain certain features of these and other results. Changes in the intensity of supraliminal accessory stimuli would not affect their value as temporal reference points, but would seem likely to alter the decree of arousal caused by them. In Experiment 16 the threshold changes induced by a barely supraliminal and a moderately intense accessory stimulus were compared. No significant differences in the falls in threshold produced by them could be shown, though significant differences in reaction time were found. Finally it was assumed that the temporal reference hypothesis applied, and that the subject computed a criterion would tend to keep the probability of his making false positive responses when the stimulus was expected at or below a minimal rate; this allowed the extent of the changes in frequency of response to a stimulus as the inter-stimulus interval was varied to be predicted. When these predictions were compared with the results of earlier experiments it wan found that the agreement between them was in most cases satisfactorily close. The agreement appeared slightly better it was assumed that the 'range of expectation' was a constant proportion of the inter-stimulus interval than when it was related to the differential threshold for duration. It is concluded that the evidence appears to be sufficient to accept that the subject reduces his threshold about the expected time of arrival of the stimulus, for a period which is related to the inter-stimulus interval, and that the threshold reduction is produced by lowering the criterion applied to threshold judgments for that period. It also appears possible that the range of expectation may be a constant proportion of the inter-stimulus interval, and that the subject may reduce his criterion to an extent calculated to maintain the probability of hie making a false positive response to an input during the range of expectation at or below a limiting value. </p...|$|E

The concentration of dF in plasma was above detection limit only in these two treatment groups. The concentration of 5 -HT in plasma (extracellular) was not modified dose-dependently, although values higher than controls were noted in the 2. 5 mg·kg− 1 group. Significant correlations were observed between the concentration of 5 -HT in whole blood and that of 5 -HT (and 5 -HT + 5 -HIAA) in frontal cortex. Both correlated inversely with the plasma concentration of dF.

40|$|It is well {{established}} that changes in cytosolic free Ca 2 + {{play a role in}} a number of neutrophil responses such as cell shape change and oxidase activation. The release of intracellular stored Ca 2 + occurs with stimuli that either act by occupancy of seven membrane-spanning domain receptors or those which act by receptor cross-linking. Here, two distinct Ca 2 + storage and release sites have been identified in neutrophils. Using chlortetracycline fluorescence as an indicator of Ca 2 + storage, two separate Ca 2 + storage sites have been identified. One site was located peripherally under the plasma membrane and the other was in the juxtanuclear space. Confocal imaging of Fluo 3 -loaded neutrophils demonstrated that the central Ca 2 + storage site released Ca 2 + in response to N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine, whereas engagement and clustering of CD 11 b/CD 18 integrins causes Ca 2 + release from the <b>peripheral</b> <b>stores.</b> The release sites also correlated with organelles that stained with DiOC 6 (3).

(2) An increase, within 20 to 68 hr, in the urinary excretion of adrenaline, even though the urine of rats without adrenal medullae does not usually contain adrenaline.

40|$|Liver {{sinusoidal}} endothelial cells (LSECs) are {{the main}} endothelial cells in the liver and are important for maintaining liver homeostasis as well as responding to injury. LSECs express cellular fibronectin containing the alternatively spliced extra domain A (EIIIA) and increase expression of this isoform in response to liver injury, although its function is not well understood. Here, I examined the role of EIIIA in sinusoid repair and liver regeneration by carrying out partial hepatectomies in mice lacking EIIIA or their wild type littermates. In vitro, I studied LSEC adhesion on decellularized, EIIIA-containing matrices and investigated the role of cellular fibronectins in LSEC tubulogenesis. I found that liver regeneration was significantly delayed and that sinusoidal repair was impaired in EIIIA-/- mice, especially females, as was the lipid accumulation typical of the post-hepatectomy liver. In vitro, I observed that primary LSECs were more adhesive to cell-deposited matrices containing EIIIA and that cellular fibronectin enhanced LSEC tubulogenesis and vascular cord formation. The integrin α 9 β 1, which specifically binds EIIIA, promoted adhesion of LSECs to EIIIA and tubulogenesis. My graduate project’s findings identify a role for EIIIA in liver regeneration.

The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate age-related changes in abdominal fat distribution of Japanese men and women of the general population over a wide range of body mass indices (BMI). Methods A total of 2, 220 non-diabetic, apparently healthy Japanese adults (1, 240 men and 980 women; age range 40 - 69 years) were included in the study sample. All subjects underwent a CT scan at the level of the umbilicus, and the areas of visceral adipose tissue (AT) and subcutaneous AT were quantified. Results When the subjects were stratified by BMI into 18. 5 - 23. 0 kg/m 2, 23. 0 - 27. 5 kg/m 2, and 27. 5 kg/m 2 or higher, visceral AT was positively correlated with age in all of the BMI strata in both genders (p< 0. 01). In contrast, subcutaneous AT was negatively correlated with age in men with BMIs in excess of 23. 0 kg/m 2 (p< 0. 01) and not at all in women. The mean levels of subcutaneous AT were over 2 -fold greater than visceral AT in women aged 60 - 69 years in any BMI stratum.

Portal insulinaemia reached a peak at 9 min, and was respectively 454 +/- 68 and 740 +/- 65 mu-units/ml in starved and post-absorptive rats. Portal glucagonaemia remained stable, but was higher in post-absorptive rats (P less than 0. 05). At 60 min after the gastric glucose load, 30 % of the glucose {{was delivered}} at the periphery in both groups. The total glucose appearance rate was higher in starved rats (P less than 0. 05), as was the glucose utilization rate (P less than 0. 05), whereas the rate of appearance of exogenous glucose was similar. This was due to a non-suppressed hepatic glucose production in the starved rats, whereas it was totally suppressed in post-absorptive rats. At 1 h after the glucose load, the increase in both liver and muscle glycogen concentration was greater in starved rats. Thus short-term fasting induces an increased portal lactate concentration after a glucose load, and produces a state of liver insulin unresponsiveness for glucose production, whereas the sensitivity of peripheral tissues for glucose utilization is unchanged or even increased. This might allow preferential replenishment of the <b>peripheral</b> <b>stores</b> of glycogen...|$|R

We developed mice in which a fluorescent reporter for PI 3 K activity is targeted to either Agrp or POMC neurons and used 2 -photon microscopy to measure dynamic regulation of PI 3 K by insulin and leptin in brain slices. We show that leptin and insulin act in parallel to stimulate PI 3 K in POMC neurons but in opposite ways on Agrp neurons.

40|$|As {{early as}} the {{beginning}} of the 20 th century, changes in appetite and weight were recognized as important symptoms of severe psychiatric disorders.

40|$|The {{pancreatic}} B-cell hormone amylin {{has been}} proposed to be both a satiation signal and an adiposity signal. The effects of peripheral amylin on energy balance are well investigated, but the effects of central amylin are less clear. We determined the effects of low doses of amylin administered into the 3 rd cerebral ventricle (i 3 vt) on food intake, body weight and other indices of energy balance. Amylin (2 pmol/h) significantly lowered body weight compared to saline after 2 weeks of infusion, independent of whether prior body weight was decreased by fasting, increased by voluntary overfeeding or unmanipulated. A bolus injection of amylin (10 pmol, i 3 vt) increased energy expenditure and body temperature, whereas chronic i 3 vt amylin infusion {{had no effect on}} energy expenditure above that of control rats even though body temperature was increased. Chronic amylin also reduced RQ, implying a preferential oxidation of fat.

40|$|The {{effects of}} low- (2 mg) and {{high-dose}} (10 mg) intravenous naloxone administration on circulating plasma catecholamines in four patients with proven and two patients with suspected phaeochromocytomas have been evaluated. In {{three out of}} four patients with confirmed phaeochromocytomas or paragangliomas, 10 mg naloxone resulted in a marked rise (290 - 575 %) in circulating noradrenaline; despite combined alpha and beta-adrenoceptor blockade, in two out of four cases systolic and diastolic pressures rose whilst pulse rate fell. No response was seen to 2 mg naloxone in any patient. No humoral or pressor response was obtained in the fourth patient, who may have been secreting maximal levels of plasma noradrenaline at the time of study. In the two patients with suspected phaeochromocytoma, there was no response to naloxone: further investigations failed to reveal a source of abnormal catecholamine secretion in these patients. It is concluded that naloxone represents a new pharmacological agent which can provoke catecholamine release in patients with phaeochromocytomas; in such patients, endogenous opioids may regulate catecholamine release either from the tumour itself or from the enhanced <b>peripheral</b> catecholamine <b>stores...</b>|$|R

40|$|There is now {{considerable}} {{consensus that}} the adipocyte hormone leptin and the pancreatic hormone insulin are important regulators of food intake and energy balance. Leptin and insulin fulfill many of the requirements to be putative adiposity signals to the brain. Plasma leptin and insulin levels are positively correlated with body weight and with adipose mass in particular. Furthermore, both leptin and insulin enter the brain from the plasma. The brain expresses both insulin and leptin receptors in areas important in the control of food intake and energy balance. Consistent with their roles as adiposity signals, exogenous leptin and insulin both reduce food intake when administered locally into the brain {{in a number of}} species under different experimental paradigms. Additionally, central administration of insulin antibodies increases food intake and body weight. Recent studies have demonstrated that both insulin and leptin have additive effects when administered simultaneously. Finally, we recently have demonstrated that leptin and insulin share downstream neuropeptide signaling pathways. Hence, insulin and leptin provide important negative feedback signals to the central nervous system, proportional to <b>peripheral</b> energy <b>stores</b> and coupled with catabolic circuits. I.

40|$|We have {{proposed}} {{a new model of}} rat intestinal sugar absorption in which high glucose concentrations promote rapid insertion of GLUT 2 into the apical membrane, so that absorptive capacity is precisely regulated to match dietary intake. Construction and building work during expansion and refurbishment of our department permitted opportunistic experiments on the effects of building-induced stress on the GLUT 2 component of absorption. In fed rats perfused with 75 mm glucose in vivo, stress rapidly inhibited glucose absorption 36. 4 ± 3. 0 % compared with control rats. Selective inhibition of the GLUT 2 component with phloretin demonstrated that stress inhibited the GLUT 2 component by 42. 8 ± 3. 8 %, which correlated with a corresponding diminution in apical GLUT 2 levels: the SGLT 1 component and its level were unaltered by stress. Effects of stress were reversed by the administration in drinking water of metyrapone, which inhibits 11 -β-hydroxylase. Injection of dexamethasone into control rats 60 min before perfusion resulted in absorption and transporter properties indistinguishable from stressed rats. Our data are consistent with the view that stress activates the hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis, causing release of glucocorticoid. The ensuing inhibition of GLUT 2 trafficking and absorption seems necessary to prevent enhanced intestinal delivery of glucose to the circulation from antagonizing the essential stress response of glucorticoid in mobilizing <b>peripheral</b> energy <b>stores</b> for emergency purposes...|$|R
40|$|Background: In {{recent years}} the {{physiological}} and pathological importance of fatty acids in both the periphery and central nervous system (CNS) has become increasingly apparent. However surprisingly limited {{research has been conducted}} comparing the fatty acid composition of central and <b>peripheral</b> lipid <b>stores.</b> Methods: The present study compared the distribution of polyunsaturated (PUFA), as well as specific saturated (SFA) and monounsaturated (MUFA) fatty acids in the whole blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of humans. Gas chromatography with flame ionization detection was used to determine the fatty acid profiles of twenty-eight matched CSF and whole blood samples. Multiple linear regression modeling, controlling for age, was used to identify significant relationships. Results: A significant positive relationship was seen between whole blood total omega- 3 fatty acids and the CSF omega- 3 subfractions, docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) (P = 0. 019) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (P = 0. 015). A direct association was also observed between the whole blood and CSF omega- 6 PUFA, arachidonic acid (AA) (P = 0. 045). Interestingly an inverse association between central and peripheral oleic acid was also found (P = 0. 045). Conclusions: These findings indicate a relationship between central and peripheral fatty acids of varying degrees of unsaturation and chain length and support the view that some systemic fatty acids are likely to cross the human blood brain barrier (BBB) and thereby influence central fatty acid concentrations. 8 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Corticotropin-releasing factor （CRF） is primary {{regulator}} of hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal（ HPA） axis, {{which is}} activated by {{various types of}} stress. Starvation is also a potent activating factor of CRF. Because the <b>peripheral</b> energy <b>store</b> refl ects on plasma levels of leptin, secreted from adipose tissue, it is presumed that leptin {{may be involved in}} the CRF activity during starvation. Indeed, the attenuation of CRF or HPA axis activity by leptin treatment has been demonstrated in several reports. While many studies indicate the leptins involvement in CRF activity, its precise regulation has not been elucidated. The aim {{of this study is to}} determine the impact of leptin on the hypothalamic CRF neuron. To exclude the other hypothalamic factors, associated with leptins central eff ect, we employed the in vitro study using immortalized CRF expressing neuron（ IVB cell）. Since the mRNA expression of longform leptin receptor was detected clearly in IVB cell with RT-PCR, we next investigated the impact of leptin on this cell. IVB cell was treated with leptin in diff erent concentrations and periods, then, the mRNA expression and the promoter activity of CRF were analyzed with real-time PCR and luciferase assay, respectively. In result, leptin suppressed CRF promoter activity with dose- and time- dependent manner in IVB cell. This indicates that leptin can suppress the CRF transcription directly in hypothalamus.

40|$|International audienceMost animals {{experience}} {{periods of}} unfavourable conditions, challenging their daily energy balance. During breeding, king penguins fast voluntarily {{for up to}} 1. 5 months in the colony, after which they replenish their energy stores at sea. However, at sea, birds might encounter periods of low foraging profitability, forcing them to draw from previously stored energy (e. g. subcutaneous fat). Accessing <b>peripheral</b> fat <b>stores</b> requires perfusion, increasing heat loss and thermoregulatory costs. Hence, how these birds balance the conflicting demands of nutritional needs and thermoregulation is unclear. We investigated the physiological responses of king penguins to fasting in cold water by: (1) monitoring tissue temperatures, as a proxy of tissue perfusion, at four distinct sites (deep and peripheral); and (2) recording their oxygen consumption rate while birds floated inside a water tank. Despite frequent oscillations, temperatures of all tissues often reached near-normothermic levels, indicating that birds maintained perfusion to peripheral tissues throughout their fasting period in water. The oxygen consumption rate of birds increased with fasting duration in water, while it was also higher when the flank tissue was warmer, indicating greater perfusion. Hence, fasting king penguins in water maintained peripheral perfusion, despite the associated greater heat loss and, therefore, thermoregulatory costs, probably to access subcutaneous fat stores. Hence, the observed normothermia in peripheral tissues of king penguins at sea, upon completion of a foraging bout, is likely explained by their nutritional needs: depositing free fatty acids (FFA) in subcutaneous tissues after profitable foraging or mobilizing FFA to fuel metabolism when foraging success was insufficient...|$|R
40|$|Energy {{balance is}} {{maintained}} via a homeostatic system involving both {{the brain and}} the periphery. A key component of this system is the hypothalamus. Over the past two decades, major advances {{have been made in}} identifying an increasing number of peptides within the hypothalamus that contribute to the process of energy homeostasis. Under stable conditions, equilibrium exists between anabolic peptides that stimulate feeding behavior, as well as decrease energy expenditure and lipid utilization in favor of fat storage, and catabolic peptides that attenuate food intake, while stimulating sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity and restricting fat deposition by increasing lipid metabolism. The equilibrium between these neuropeptides is dynamic in nature. It shifts across the day–night cycle and from day to day and also in response to dietary challenges as well as <b>peripheral</b> energy <b>stores.</b> These shifts occur in close relation to circulating levels of the hormones, leptin, insulin, ghrelin and corticosterone, and also the nutrients, glucose and lipids. These circulating factors together with neural processes are primary signals relaying information regarding the availability of fuels needed for current cellular demand, in addition to the level of stored fuels needed for long-term use. Together, these signals have profound impact on the expression and production of neuropeptides that, in turn, initiate the appropriate anabolic or catabolic responses for restoring equilibrium.

Foot and calf blood flows were measured by venous-occlusion, water plethysmography.
