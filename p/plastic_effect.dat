40|$|Natural enemies such as {{predators and}} parasites {{are known to}} shape {{intraspecific}} variability of behaviour and personality in natural populations, yet several key questions remain: (i) What is {{the relative importance of}} predationvs. parasitism in shaping intraspecific variation of behaviour across generations? (ii) What are the contributions of genetic and <b>plastic</b> <b>effects</b> to this behavioural divergence? (iii) And to what extent are responses to predation and parasitism repeatable across independent evolutionary lineages?We addressed these questions using Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata) (i) varying in their exposure to dangerous fish predators and Gyrodactylus ectoparasites for (ii) both wild-caught F 0 and laboratory-reared F 2 individuals and coming from (iii) multiple independent evolutionary lineages (i. e. independent drainages). Several key findings emerged. First, a population’s history of predation and parasitism influenced behavioural profiles, but to different extent depending on the behaviour considered (activity, shoaling or boldness). Second, we had evidence for some genetic effects of predation regime on behaviour, with differences in activity of F 2 laboratory-reared individuals, but not for parasitism, which had only <b>plastic</b> <b>effects</b> on the boldness of wild-caught F 0 individuals. Third, the two lineages showed a mixture of parallel and nonparallel responses to predation/parasitism, with parallel responses being stronger for predation than for parasitism and for activity and boldness than for shoaling.

50|$|The main Aleut {{method of}} basketry was false {{embroidery}} (overlay). Strands of grasses or reeds were overlaid upon the basic weaving surface, {{to obtain a}} <b>plastic</b> <b>effect.</b> Basketry was an art reserved for women. Early Aleut women created baskets and woven mats of exceptional technical quality, using only their thumbnail, grown long and then sharpened, as a tool. Today, Aleut weavers continue to produce woven grass pieces of a remarkable cloth-like texture, works of modern art with roots in ancient tradition. Birch bark, puffin feathers, and baleen are also commonly used by the Aleut in basketry. The Aleut term for grass basket is qiigam aygaaxsii.

40|$|The <b>plastic</b> <b>effect</b> is {{historically}} used to denote {{various forms of}} stereopsis. The vivid impression of depth often associated with binocular stereopsis can also be achieved in other ways, for example, using a synopter. Accounts of this go back over a hundred years. These ways of viewing all aim to diminish sensorial evidence that the picture is physically flat. Although various viewing modes have been proposed in the literature, their effects have never been compared. In the current study, we compared three viewing modes: monocular blur, synoptic viewing, and free viewing (using a placebo synopter). By designing a physical embodiment that was indistinguishable for the three experimental conditions, we kept observers naive {{with respect to the}} differences between them; 197 observers participated in an experiment where the three viewing modes were compared by performing a rating task. Results indicate that synoptic viewing causes the largest <b>plastic</b> <b>effect.</b> Monocular blur scores lower than synoptic viewing but is still rated significantly higher than the baseline conditions. The results strengthen the idea that synoptic viewing is not due to a placebo effect.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between body {{size and the}} probability of maturing, {{often referred to as}} the probabilistic maturation reaction norm (PMRN), has been increasingly used to infer genetic variation in maturation schedule. Despite this trend, few studies have directly evaluated plasticity in the PMRN. A transplant experiment using white-spotted charr demonstrated that the PMRN for precocious males exhibited plasticity. A smaller threshold size at maturity occurred in charr inhabiting narrow streams where more refuges are probably available for small charr, which in turn might enhance the reproductive success of sneaker precocious males.

Incompressibility and particle anti-clustering are enforced {{with a double}} density relaxation procedure which updates particle positions according to two opposing pressure terms. From this process surface tension effects emerge, enabling drop and filament formation. Elastic and non-linear <b>plastic</b> <b>effects</b> are obtained by adding springs with varying rest length between particles.

40|$|Residual stresses, {{arising from}} welding {{processes}} or nonhomogeneous plastic deformations, broadly influence the {{high cycle fatigue}} behavior of mechanical components.

The influence of roughness, even for small magnitudes, is an important factor that cannot be neglected.

40|$|A dynamic {{analysis}} of a thin shell finite element undergoing large displacements and rotations is here presented.

A conservative time integration scheme for the non-linear dynamics of the hyperelastic damaged-plastic thin shell is applied.

Although neurons in the posterior ectosylvian gyrus (PEG) exhibit similar tuning properties and conform to a tonotopic mapping consistent with prior findings, these areas enhance selectivity to target stimuli.

40|$|Probabilistic {{maturation}} reaction norms (PMRNs) {{with up to}} 3 explanatory dimensions {{were estimated}} for female North Sea plaice "Pleuronectes platessa". The 3 -dimensional PMRNs reported here (1) {{are the first to}} be obtained for any organism, (2) reveal the differential capacity of alternative life-history state variables to predict the onset of reproduction, (3) document consistent temporal trends in maturation, and (4) help disentangle the contributions of genetic and <b>plastic</b> <b>effects</b> to these trends. We first show that PMRNs based on age and weight provide slightly more accurate approximations of maturation probabilities than PMRNs based on age and length. At the same time, weight-based PMRNs imply a much wider spread of maturation probabilities than length-based PMRNs. We then demonstrate that including condition as a third explanatory variable improves predictions of maturation probability. The resultant 3 -dimensional PMRNs for age-length-condition or age-weight-condition not only show how, at given size and age, maturation probability increases with condition, but also expose how this impact of condition decreases with age and has changed over time. Our analysis reveals several interesting temporal trends. First, it is demonstrated that even after removing <b>plastic</b> <b>effects</b> on maturation captured by age, length, weight and condition, residual trends towards maturation at younger ages and smaller lengths remain. Second, we find that the width of both length- and weight-based PMRNs decreased significantly over time. Third, age and condition are nowadays affecting maturation probabilities less than they did decades ago. We conclude that plaice are currently maturing at a very low age, size and body condition, and that the narrow and steep reaction norms do not allow a strong continuation of the observed trends. The findings obtained are in good agreement with predictions from life-history theory based on the hypothesis of evolutionary change caused by heavy exploitation...|$|R
40|$|Phenotypic {{plasticity}} allows organisms with identical genotypes {{to develop}} different phenotypes {{in response to}} different environmental cues. Phenotypic plasticity is a trait in itself, and can be either adaptive or non-adaptive. In this study I test for a potential salinity-induced <b>plastic</b> <b>effect</b> {{on the development of}} lateral bony plates in a fresh water population of the threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), a fish known for having plastic responses to other environmental cues. In order to do this, I bred male and female sticklebacks, partitioned each family of offspring into two groups, and reared each group in two different environments (salt and fresh water). This kind of experiment is called a split-clutch design and makes it easier to differentiate genetic and plastically induced differences. 16 families survived until the experiment s end, and when the fish had reached the size where all plates were fully developed, plate number was counted for all fish. These data were analyzed using a general linear mixed model to see if plate number was affected by the different environments. The results showed that there is a <b>plastic</b> <b>effect</b> on plate number induced by increased salinity: sticklebacks reared in fresh water developed more plates than those in salt water. This was somewhat contrary to my hypothesis, as wild sticklebacks consistently show a considerably lower number of plates in fresh water populations than in salt water populations. This along {{with the fact that the}} observed difference in plate number was relatively small, indicates non-adaptive rather than adaptive plasticity.

The atomic structure of the very tip of a crack front has remained unknown, however. We have carried out a first-principles density functional theory study to reveal the precise alignment of atoms near the crack tip in single-crystalline Al. The calculations demonstrate that the CTOA increases with the opening displacement, thus the observed constant CTOA in millimeter scale is an entirely <b>plastic</b> <b>effect</b> during ductile crack. Besides, we find no significant crack tunneling (crack-front blunting), which can be accounted for from the very small relaxation of the Al free surface.

To study the evolution of plastic recombination, we develop a modifier model using the same theoretical framework used to study conventional (nonplastic) modifiers, thus allowing direct comparison.

Relative to nonplastic effects, selection on the <b>plastic</b> <b>effects</b> of a modifier is both much stronger and less sensitive to {{the specifics of the}} selection regime (e. g., epistasis).

Even a crudely schematic form of the model reproduces the time strengthening of the static friction force and the velocity weakening of the steady motion dynamic one.
