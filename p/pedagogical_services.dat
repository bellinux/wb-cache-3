The evolution cannot neglect the integration of Semantic Web technology within the distance learning system; On the one hand, the computerization of pedagogical contents will open broad prospects to upgrade the quality of learning. On the other hand, the system based on multi-agents system is a fertile field to exercise the pedagogical act cross paths betting on the quality of performance and the generation of new rhythms of learning, taking into account the profile of the learner (level of knowledge, preferences, competences, centers of interest, style of learning, etc.) ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis has investigative and {{empirical}} character. It combines {{an attempt to}} create a theoretical system (a new subdiscipline of special pedagogy) with an attempt to gain arguments by means of empirical investigation.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} “reflexivity” {{as the key}} {{theme for}} understanding how Danish school managers work with the currently influential political vision of including {{students with special needs}} in the common school (educating children aged 5 - 16). Despite repeated attempts to realize the vision of inclusion, the number of students referred to special <b>pedagogical</b> <b>services,</b> and thus segregated from the common school, has continued to grow, especially since 1995. There is a widespread consent that this development is due to the schools’ practices and socially constructed categories of “special needs” and “normalcy. ” Pedagogical scholars and recent policy initiatives posit that schools can achieve the much-wanted cultural change towards inclusion if teachers reflect (more) on their mindsets and practices. When advocating inclusion, scholars often refer to school managers as “leaders of meaning construction,” thus emphasizing their importance in facilitating cultural change. Existing knowledge practices are depicted as too “durable” with the unintended side-effects of segregation and budget overruns, and school managers are, following, encouraged making teachers change their practices through (self-) reflexivity...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} addresses three fundamental {{challenges of}} contemporary critical civic education in Germany. (1) How can we improve reflecting subjective experiences and offering insights into political and socio-economic dynamics that affect personal agency? (2) Which theories render {{answers to the}} question, how participants who share racist views could {{take an interest in}} questioning their views? (3) Does the shift in state-programs from ‘fighting right-wing-extremism’ to ‘promoting diversity’ improve the quality of civic education? Part 1 renders answers to the first question on the basis of four expert interviews. Firstly, it is essential to develop civic education {{from the standpoint of the}} student rather than from the standpoint of the teacher. Secondly, Lebenswelt-experiences should be addressed more instead of relying on experiences made in pedagogical simulations. Thirdly it appeared that methods designed for analyzing societal structures do in fact not transcend the level of subjective experiences and subsequently need to be developed. Finally, the professionals need support in expanding their theoretical knowledge instead of present themselves as perfect suppliers of <b>pedagogical</b> <b>services.</b> Part 2 combines a re-reading of quantitative and qualitative research on racism and right-wing populism with the development of theory with respect to the second question. I argue for instance that the term ‘attitude’ has lost its original conceptual value and that therefore the contribution of attitude research to this question are limited. Consequently the correlation between political and socio-economic deprivation and right-wing attitudes is unravelled in its objective and subjective meaning. The resulting theoretical framework on ethnisation and meritocratisation locates right-wing-extremist and racist phenomena in the history of the neoliberal project and attempts to make visible how personal agency in racist forms may collide with intentions and interests of the performing subject. Herein lie reasons for ‘racist’ participants to question their own views. Part 3 demonstrates that the Kohl-administrations’ program did not leave much space for civic education at all, while the Schröder-government gave way for practical innovations and rich conceptual debates. The rise of ‘diversity’ as a new Leitmotiv is ambivalent. On one hand critique of relations of domination is inhibited and many ideas labelled as an element of ‘diversity-education’ are all but new. Nevertheless, notions such as taking into account interlacing dimensions of domination may enhance civic education, helping to forge alliances across differences, which could expand individual and collective agency...|$|E

40|$|Economics {{teaching}} relies overwhelmingly on faculty lecturing, {{which is}} generally seen as a significant pedagogical problem. But this paper argues that didactic instruction is actually well-suited to the neoclassical economics that is usually taught. This approach – especially its textbook version – is typically sceptical of individual perception and inductive reasoning, relying instead on parsimonious models and deduction. Experiential learning has very limited usefulness in learning such theories. In contrast, heterodox approaches in economics typically employ both inductive and deductive reasoning. Since induction is integral to experiential learning, a pluralist curriculum offers important <b>pedagogical</b> advantages. <b>Service</b> learning exposes students to economic phenomena in their communities and challenges them to learn from that experience. This can call the instrumentalism of the textbook neoclassical approach into question and open up the classroom discussion to alternative approaches. economic pluralism; service learning; ontology; methodology; pedagogy; mathematical logic; deduction; induction; teaching economics; heterodox economics; textbook economics; pluralist economics; economics education; higher education. ...|$|R
40|$|This article {{draws on}} the {{reflections}} of the <b>pedagogical</b> practice of <b>service</b> learning in higher education. Mahlomaholo (2010) described crisply the “context of educational dysfunctionality suffusing the country”. The question often pondered about is: what skill and knowledge can be infused to make teaching at higher education institutions, to reflect the realities of society. Using critical reflection we asked: “[i]s your teaching worthy?”). The business management methods module allows for the <b>pedagogical</b> practice of <b>service</b> learning to {{be incorporated into the}} assessment. By adopting a constructivist approach to teaching business management method content means that the business management instructor is building on students’ previous knowledge and allows the students to draw from their own experiences, thereby providing a scaffold for the students to develop an increased understanding of the business management pedagogical issues being discussed. As a business management method instructor choosing a pedagogical approach, that can address categories of significant learning, is an important step in developing learning that is durable. There are many views about how constructivist approaches to learning can or should, be aligned to constructivist approaches to teaching. The two pedagogical practices that can be effectively incorporated in business management education are: cooperative learning and service-learning. This paper uses auto ethnography to focus on the instructor’s subjective experience of using service learning as a pedagogical approach...|$|R

For this, we will be presenting the case study of the Water Museum of Empresa Portuguesa das Águas Livres (EPAL), through the analysis of its dynamic with schools and more specifically through the analysis of the materials produced by the students in the annual competition promoted by this institution. Culture, family, religion and the society in general where the individual is inserted, all these factors are influences to the values. In this way, we believe that the museum should assume its social responsibility beyond the traditional point of view, of divulging and preserving the patrimony and assume itself as an agent of change and an educator for the values. In {{the first part of the}} work, it is presented a reflection on the necessity of education for the values in terms of the formal point of view and of the main methods used for its teaching, establishing the parallelism with the main learning theories in the museums and of which will be the role of the cultural institutions in the plan of the non formal education. The second part of the work consists in the case study of the EPAL´s Water Museum and its relationship with the school public. The analysis of the works developed by the children of the first and second cycle reveals some environmental concerns with pollution and to the efficient use of the water presenting respectively the environment attitudes: biocentrism (water as an essential to life) and anthropocentric (utilitarian perspective for Man). However we conclude that in terms of values nothing guarantees that the attitudes demonstrated as a child will result in sustainable behaviours in the future.

40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{investigate}} the market of pedagogic consulting and how the customers look upon these kinds of services and what the consultants think about the market. The following five questions were investigated: What is {{the situation of the}} market of pedagogic consulting? -          What needs and what demands are there of <b>pedagogical</b> consulting <b>services?</b> -          What are the economic possibilities for schools and municipalities to buy professional development and consulting services? What do schools and municipalities think about their needs and what do they think about buying professional development from consultants? -          How are the professional development offerings of the consultants recieved by schools and municipalities and is there a difference between the private and public sector of education? -          What impact could professional development have on schools? In what way is the marketing for pedagogic consulting done? Method In this study I have chosen to have a qualitative approach with an abductive perpective. I made these choices to get closer to what I wanted to investigate. Through the abductive methodology it was possible to go between theory and empirics. The empirics consits of seven face-face local interviews. The persons who were interviewed were consultants, principals {{and the head of the}} administration of upper secondary schools. They all helped me to investigate the pedagogical consultation market. Conclusions According to the sources in this paper have the Swedish school results decreased, therefore it is a need to do something about it and professional development for teachers could be one thing that could improve the situation. However, the pedagogical consulting businesses could face a problematic time, because of the economical crises which makes is difficult for schools and municipalities to afford their services. I interpret that schools seem to be unsure of what needs they have although they seem to understand that there is something they lack. It can be hard to see what the basic problem is and therefore difficult to know what changes are needed and what kind of professional development teachers need. Through the offering of professional development services by consultants, the teachers’ quality can become better and the schools competitiveness can improve. Finally, I found out that the municipality and schools I investigated don’t buy <b>pedagogical</b> consulting <b>services</b> very often. The reason for this could be the economic situation due to the economic crises. I also found that the marketing in pedagogical consulting businesses mostly is done through personal networks. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{second edition}} of this highly praised {{textbook}} provides {{an introduction to}} tensors, group theory, and their applications in classical and quantum physics.   Both intuitive and rigorous, it aims to demystify tensors by giving the slightly more abstract but conceptually much clearer definition found in the math literature, and then connects this formulation to the component formalism of physics calculations.   New pedagogical features, such as new illustrations, tables, and boxed sections, as well as additional “invitation” sections that provide accessible introductions to new material, offer increased visual engagement, clarity, and motivation for students.    Part I begins with linear algebraic foundations, follows with the modern component-free definition of tensors, and concludes with applications to physics {{through the use of}} tensor products. Part II introduces group theory, including abstract groups and Lie groups and their associated Lie algebras, then intertwines this material with that of Part I by introducing representation theory.   Examples and exercises are provided in each chapter for good practice in applying the presented material and techniques.   Prerequisites for this text include the standard lower-division mathematics and physics courses, though extensive references are provided for the motivated student who has not yet had these.   Advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate students in physics and applied mathematics will find this textbook to be a clear, concise, and engaging introduction to tensors and groups.

40|$|Background In Sweden {{there is}} one {{consortium}} for virtual references for each public and research library. The research libraries’ service Librarian On Duty, which uses VRLplus, is a <b>pedagogical</b> <b>service</b> where the patron gets a personal guidance by a librarian via chat and co-browsing. Librarian On Duty {{is more of a}} general resource than a specialist one. This means that very specialised questions may not be answered directly, but instead be directed to the most suitable librarian. Depending on the patron’s requirements, the librarian on duty can transfer the question to a colleague at the same library or to another library within the consortia. Librarian on Duty is already in use by half of Sweden’s research libraries. The corresponding service for the public libraries, Ask the Library, is a virtual reference service with many years of experience, the e-mail service was started already in 1995, and now consists of 36 libraries that answer e-mail questions and 14 of these libraries also take part in a chat service. To make a whole new collaboration between and within the consortia possible, the public libraries will change systems to VRLplus, i. e. the same system that is used by the research libraries. A new model for collaboration By organizing in two consortia, using the same software, there is a possibility for the two organizational types to develop a whole new model for collaboration. This new model implies that each organization could have its own local installation to give service to their local users in the first hand. Each organization participates in the national or international consortias where there is a collaboration to give service around the clock. The new possibilities for cooperation mean that each organization, by using the systems bridge between the consortias, can define new collaborative partners on a national or international basis and thus create whole new virtual information services. These new services may consist of university and research organizations and governmental institutions within a region, e. g. ”Ask Scandinavia”, or be built by competence. It may also be a subject-based cooperation within a European Union area, e. g. ”Ask ECDC”. Other examples may include cooperation between different competences and professions, e. g. “Ask EUROPE DIRECT”. This means increased possibilities for specialization and development, and whole new collaborative constellations between libraries and other community-based services can emerge while still maintaining the basic responsibility for the local users. This is enabled by a tool that is under constant development. The leading ideas to make this a successful service are: - Guidance suited {{to the needs of the}} questioner - Creative reference and information work - Competence development for the information professionals - Rationalisation of scarce resources - Higher quality of information services, both off and on campu...|$|R

40|$|Current experiential {{learning}} {{approach in the}} Nigerian Technical and Vocational education (TVE) {{has been criticized for}} not meeting the desired challenges. The TVE departments give less emphasis to service learning due to lack of conceptual framework that can guide its implementation. Hence, this research aimed to develop a conceptual framework of service learning in TVE for Nigerian tertiary education. The research was designed to determine the aspects and their respective areas {{for the development of a}} conceptual framework for effective service learning in TVE. Mixed methods sequential explanatory research design was employed for this research. Two hundred and sixty seven (267) respondents comprised of 206 lecturers, 45 heads of department and 16 faculty deans and deputy deans were chosen using stratified random sampling technique from eight TVE departments of 15 tertiary education institutions in the North Eastern Sub-Region of Nigeria. Six service learning experts in TVE were interviewed. A researcher-made structured questionnaire consisting of 67 items and interview protocol on the six major aspects of service learning were used as instruments for the quantitative and qualitative data collection respectively. The instruments were validated by three experts and the reliability of the questionnaire was established through a pilot study. Stepwise linear regression analysis, structural equation modeling (SEM) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were used to analyse the quantitative research questions whereas content analysis was used to analyse the qualitative research question. The findings revealed a conceptual framework of service learning for TVE in the Nigerian tertiary education which include course learning objective, faculty community involvements, students’ learning outcomes, assessment/reflection procedures, community <b>service</b> needs and <b>pedagogical</b> support <b>services</b> which covers a total of sixty seven areas of service learning in TVE. In conclusion, the research recommended for the implementation of the conceptual framework in TVE at the tertiary institutions in Nigeria...|$|R
