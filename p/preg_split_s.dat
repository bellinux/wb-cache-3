40|$|AbstractMetalloradical EPR signals {{have been}} found in intact Photosystem II at {{cryogenic}} temperatures. They reflect the light-driven formation of the tyrosine Z radical (YZ) in magnetic interaction with the CaMn 4 cluster in a particular S state. These so-called split EPR signals, induced at cryogenic temperatures, provide means to study the otherwise transient YZ and to probe the S states with EPR spectroscopy. In the S 0 and S 1 states, the respective split signals are induced by illumination of the sample in the visible light range only. In the S 3 state the split EPR signal is induced irrespective of illumination wavelength within the entire 415 – 900 nm range (visible and near-IR region) [Su, J. H., Havelius, K. G. V., Ho, F. M., Han, G., Mamedov, F., and Styring, S. (2007) Biochemistry 46, 10703 – 10712]. An important question is whether a single mechanism can explain the induction of the <b>Split</b> <b>S</b> 3 signal across the entire wavelength range or whether wavelength-dependent mechanisms are required. In this paper we confirm that the YZ radical formation in the S 1 state, reflected in the <b>Split</b> <b>S</b> 1 signal, is driven by P 680 -centered charge separation. The situation in the S 3 state is different. In Photosystem II centers with pre-reduced quinone A (QA), where the P 680 -centered charge separation is blocked, the <b>Split</b> <b>S</b> 3 EPR signal could still be induced in the majority of the Photosystem II centers using both visible and NIR (830 nm) light. This shows that P 680 -centered charge separation is not involved. The amount of oxidized electron donors and reduced electron acceptors (QA−) was well correlated after visible light illumination at cryogenic temperatures in the S 1 state. This was not the case in the S 3 state, where the <b>Split</b> <b>S</b> 3 EPR signal was formed in the majority of the centers in a pathway other than P 680 -centered charge separation. Instead, we propose that one mechanism exists over the entire wavelength interval to drive the formation of the <b>Split</b> <b>S</b> 3 signal. The origin for this, probably involving excitation of one of the Mn ions in the CaMn 4 cluster in Photosystem II, is discussed...|$|R

We have studied the flash power dependence of the S state turnover in Photosystem II membranes by monitoring the <b>split</b> <b>S</b> 0, <b>split</b> <b>S</b> 1, <b>split</b> <b>S</b> 3 and S 2 state multiline EPR signals. We demonstrate that quantification of the S 1, S 3 and S 0 states, using the split EPR signals, is indeed possible in samples with mixed S state composition. The amplitudes of all three split EPR signals are linearly correlated to the concentration of the respective S state. We also show that the S 1 → S 2 transition proceeds without misses following a saturating flash at 1  °C, whilst substantial misses occur in the S 2 → S 3 transition following the second flash...|$|R

The percentage of centers in which the S 2 modified signal and the <b>split</b> <b>S</b> 3 signal can be observed has been estimated by using pulsed-EPR spectroscopy. On the basis of one tyrosine D radical per reaction center, the field-swept spin echo spectrum of the modified S 2 state in dark-adapted photosystem II was detected in a large majority of the reaction centers. The derivative of the S 2 field-swept spectrum with respect to the magnetic field resulted in a spectrum similar to that observed by cw-EPR. The additional light-induced <b>split</b> <b>S</b> 3 signal appeared on top of the envelope of the S 2 signal and was detected in the same proportion of centers as that which exhibited the S 2 signal prior to the illumination. In the formal S 3 state, the hyperfine lines of the Mn field-swept echo spectrum were no longer detectable. The storage of PS- 11 at 77 K after formation of the S 3 QA− state by freezing the membranes under continuous illumination resulted in a decrease of the S 3 signal but the pulsed-EPR S 2 manganese signal was conserved...|$|R
