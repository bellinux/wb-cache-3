5|$|Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine {{first used}} {{camouflage}} in the 1940 Norwegian campaign. A {{wide range of}} <b>patterns</b> <b>were</b> authorised, but most commonly black and white diagonal stripes were used. Most <b>patterns</b> <b>were</b> designed to hide ships in harbour or near the coast; they were often painted over with plain grey when operating in the Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|A {{wider variety}} of <b>patterns</b> <b>were</b> used from the 11thcentury. Abstract 6- and 8-point shapes appear in the Tower of Kharaqan at Qazvin, Persia in 1067, and the Al-Juyushi Mosque, Egypt in 1085, again {{becoming}} widespread from there, though 6-point patterns are rare in Turkey.|$|E
5|$|Measure 32 was {{a medium}} pattern of {{obtrusive}} polygons in navy blue or black, against background polygons of lighter grays and greens. This measure emphasized mistaken identity and course deception to complicate submarine attack. <b>Patterns</b> <b>were</b> carried across the bow, and light gray was used aft to blend with the wake. This measure {{was based on}} the World War I dazzle system modified by observations in the western Pacific; and was applied to most surface ships in the Pacific during 1944 and 1945. Different <b>patterns</b> <b>were</b> devised for classes with large numbers of ships so the pattern would not identify the class of ship.|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} method {{used in this}} study is descriptive quantitative with cost calculation pattern method that include incremental costs like the cost of labor turnover, cost savings, overtime costs, and subcontrack costs for each product like bricks, culverts, and hexagon pavingblocks. The study found that total cost to produced bricks paving using using moderat production <b>pattern</b> <b>is</b> Rp. 338. 000, total cost using wavy <b>pattern</b> <b>is</b> Rp. 242. 000, and constant <b>pattern</b> <b>is</b> Rp 30. 400. Total cost to produced culverts is Rp. 900. 000 using moderat pattern, total cost using wavy <b>pattern</b> <b>is</b> Rp. 205. 000 and total cost using constant <b>pattern</b> <b>is</b> Rp. 507. 500. Total cost to produced hexagon pavingblocks using moderat production <b>pattern</b> <b>is</b> Rp. 730. 000, total cost using wavy production <b>pattern</b> <b>is</b> Rp. 450. 000, and total cost using constant <b>pattern</b> <b>is</b> Rp. 125. 000. The results showed that using wavy production pattern to produced culverts and constant pattern to produced pavingblocks is more efficient to decrease incremental costs of company than usage moderate production pattern...|$|R
5|$|All British <b>patterns</b> <b>were</b> different, first {{tested on}} small wooden models viewed through a periscope in a studio. Most {{of the model}} designs were painted by women from London's Royal Academy of Arts. A foreman then scaled up their designs for the real thing. Painters, however, were not alone in the project. Creative people {{including}} sculptors, artists, and set designers designed camouflage.|$|E
5|$|Common motifs of the Parthian period include {{scenes of}} royal hunting expeditions and the {{investiture}} of Arsacid kings. Use of these motifs extended to include portrayals of local rulers. Common art mediums were rock-reliefs, frescos, and even graffiti. Geometric and stylized plant <b>patterns</b> <b>were</b> also used on stucco and plaster walls. The common motif of the Sassanid period showing two horsemen engaged in combat with lances {{first appeared in}} the Parthian reliefs at Mount Behistun.|$|E
5|$|In 1086, 7- and 10-point girih {{patterns}} (with heptagons, 5- and 6-pointed stars, triangles {{and irregular}} hexagons) {{appear in the}} Friday Mosque at Isfahan. 10-point girih became widespread in the Islamic world, except in the Spanish Al-Andalus. Soon afterwards, sweeping 9-, 11-, and 13-point girih <b>patterns</b> <b>were</b> used in the Barsian Mosque, also in Persia, in 1098; these, like 7-point geometrical patterns, are rarely used outside Persia and central Asia.|$|E

50|$|In {{software}} engineering, an amelioration <b>pattern</b> <b>is</b> an anti-pattern {{formed when}} an existing software design <b>pattern</b> <b>was</b> edited (i.e. rearranged, added or deleted) to better suit {{a particular problem}} so as to achieve some further effect or behavior. In this sense, an amelioration <b>pattern</b> <b>is</b> transformational in character.|$|R
30|$|Step 1. Preparation before measurement. It {{includes}} {{the generation of}} dithering pattern and stereo vision calibration. The dithering fringe <b>pattern</b> <b>is</b> insensitive to the gamma of projector which uses 1 -bit binary instead of 8 -bit gray information to approximate the sinusoidal fringe pattern. Dithering fringe <b>pattern</b> can <b>be</b> used for high speed measurement without projector calibration. Another merit of dithering fringe <b>pattern</b> <b>is</b> that it is suitable to measure objects when wide fringe <b>pattern</b> <b>is</b> used. In this paper, the dithering fringe <b>pattern</b> <b>is</b> generated based on the reference [16].|$|R
5|$|Saturn's {{atmosphere}} {{exhibits a}} banded pattern similar to Jupiter's, but Saturn's bands are much fainter and are much wider near the equator. The nomenclature {{used to describe}} these bands {{is the same as}} on Jupiter. Saturn's finer cloud <b>patterns</b> <b>were</b> not observed until the flybys of the Voyager spacecraft during the 1980s. Since then, Earth-based telescopy has improved to the point where regular observations can be made.|$|E
5|$|Terraforming is {{a natural}} {{outgrowth}} of colonizing an alien world. The first playable prototype was just a map generator that tested climate changes during the game. This required the designers to create a world builder program and climatic model far more powerful than anything they'd done before. Temperature, wind, and rainfall <b>patterns</b> <b>were</b> modeled in ways that allow players to make changes: for example, creating a ridge-line and then watching the effects. In addition to raising terrain, the player can also divert rivers, dig huge boreholes into the planet's mantle, and melt ice caps.|$|E
5|$|The thermal {{analysis}} {{was the first}} done for any casting process. This was done by creating an electrical analog of the thermal system. A cross-section of the dies were drawn on Teledeltos paper and then thermal loads and cooling <b>patterns</b> <b>were</b> drawn onto the paper. Water lines were represented by magnets of various sizes. The thermal conductivity was represented by the reciprocal of the resistivity of the paper.|$|E

5|$|A natural {{experiment}} permitted extensive study of attachment issues as researchers followed thousands of Romanian orphans adopted into Western families {{after the end}} of the Nicolae Ceauşescu regime. The English and Romanian Adoptees Study Team, led by Michael Rutter, followed some of the children into their teens, attempting to unravel the effects of poor attachment, adoption, new relationships, physical problems and medical issues associated with their early lives. Studies of these adoptees, whose initial conditions were shocking, yielded reason for optimism as many of the children developed quite well. Researchers noted that separation from familiar people is only one of many factors that help to determine the quality of development. Although higher rates of atypical insecure attachment <b>patterns</b> <b>were</b> found compared to native-born or early-adopted samples, 70% of later-adopted children exhibited no marked or severe attachment disorder behaviours.|$|E
5|$|British ornithologist David Lack {{considered}} that the Puerto Rican amazon had {{evolved from the}} Hispaniolan amazon (A. ventralis) found in Hispaniola, but it has since been argued that he omitted some elements in his analysis, including the similarities found between the black-billed amazon (A. agilis) of Jamaica and the Puerto Rican amazon. Subsequent studies showed that size and color <b>patterns</b> <b>were</b> not sufficient to assess evolutionary relationships, and that patterns changed with relative ease even within {{members of the same}} species. The research concluded that the Puerto Rican amazon may share a common ancestor with the Jamaican A. agilis. Recent phylogenetic studies show that the Puerto Rican amazon is more closely related to the Hispaniolan amazon and the Cuban amazon than to the black-billed amazon.|$|E
5|$|By 2000, {{development}} {{was under way}} to create pixellated camouflage patterns for battledress like the Canadian Forces' CADPAT, issued in 2002, and then the US Marines' MARPAT, rolled out between 2002 and 2004. The CADPAT and MARPAT <b>patterns</b> <b>were</b> somewhat self-similar (in the manner of fractals and patterns in nature such as vegetation), being designed to work at two different scales; a genuinely fractal pattern would be statistically similar at all scales. A target camouflaged with MARPAT takes about 2.5 times longer to detect than older NATO camouflage which worked at only one scale, while recognition, which begins after detection, took 20 percent longer than with older camouflage.|$|E

5|$|The Baltic {{settlement}} <b>patterns</b> <b>were</b> being altered {{beginning in}} the 5th century by the Migration Period population shifts and the pressure from the westbound movement of the Slavic peoples. The Western Balts took over the lands left by the Wielbark culture people and reached {{the eastern part of}} the mouth of the Vistula. A major trade route connecting the southeastern Baltic areas with the Black Sea shores went now through the regions controlled by the Balts. Expansion of the Old Prussian tribes, for example the previously mentioned Galindians and Yotvingians, encompassed today's northeast Poland and the adjacent territories further north. Galindia (today's western Masuria), including the Olsztyn group, became in 6th and 7th centuries the most affluent of the Baltic people settled lands, with highly developed local craftsmanship supplementing the wealth of items brought from distant countries.|$|E
5|$|The Islamic conquests {{reached their}} {{peak in the}} mid-eighth century. The defeat of Muslim forces at the Battle of Tours in 732 led to the reconquest of {{southern}} France by the Franks, but {{the main reason for}} the halt of Islamic growth in Europe was the overthrow of the Umayyad Caliphate and its replacement by the Abbasid Caliphate. The Abbasids moved their capital to Baghdad and were more concerned with the Middle East than Europe, losing control of sections of the Muslim lands. Umayyad descendants took over the Iberian Peninsula, the Aghlabids controlled North Africa, and the Tulunids became rulers of Egypt. By the middle of the 8th century, new trading <b>patterns</b> <b>were</b> emerging in the Mediterranean; trade between the Franks and the Arabs replaced the old Roman economy. Franks traded timber, furs, swords and slaves in return for silks and other fabrics, spices, and precious metals from the Arabs.|$|E
5|$|When Norfolk {{was first}} settled, homes {{were made of}} wood and frame construction, similar to most medieval English-style homes. These homes had wide {{chimneys}} and thatch roofs. Some decades after the town was first laid out in 1682, the Georgian architectural style, which was popular in the South at the time, was used. Brick was considered more substantial construction; <b>patterns</b> <b>were</b> made by brick laid and Flemish bond. This style evolved to include projecting center pavilions, Palladian windows, balustraded roof decks, and two-story porticoes. By 1740, homes, warehouses, stores, workshops, and taverns began to dot Norfolk's streets.|$|E
40|$|Hand Vein <b>patterns</b> <b>are</b> one of {{the safest}} {{biometric}} information due to their strong resilience against the impostor attacks. In the presented work, a new approach for biometric authentication using infrared thermal hand vein <b>patterns</b> <b>is</b> proposed. The proposed work presents a Euclidean distance based vein’s pattern based biometric authentication {{that can be used for}} ascertaining the biometric identity of person under scanner. The vein <b>patterns</b> <b>are</b> grabbed using the infra red (IR) thermal cameras and after applying some image pre-processing operations, a binary image is obtained consisting of veins crossings and intersections. The binary image is thinned using the morphological operations and a single line thinned image <b>pattern</b> <b>is</b> obtained. The thinned image <b>pattern</b> <b>is</b> now examined for intersections extractions and inter-distance between intersections. The inter-distance between intersections of vein <b>patterns</b> <b>are</b> stored in a data base.

5|$|London {{became the}} largest and most populous {{metropolitan}} area in the world during the Victorian era, and trade within the British Empire—as well as the standing of the British military and navy—was prestigious. Political agitation at home from radicals such as the Chartists and the suffragettes enabled legislative reform and universal suffrage. Power shifts in east-central Europe led to World War I; hundreds of thousands of English soldiers died fighting for the United Kingdom as part of the Allies. Two decades later, in World War II, the United Kingdom was again one of the Allies. At the end of the Phoney War, Winston Churchill became the wartime Prime Minister. Developments in warfare technology saw many cities damaged by air-raids during the Blitz. Following the war, the British Empire experienced rapid decolonisation, and there was a speeding up of technological innovations; automobiles became the primary means of transport and Frank Whittle's development of the jet engine led to wider air travel. Residential <b>patterns</b> <b>were</b> altered in England by private motoring, and by the creation of the National Health Service (NHS) in 1948. The UK's NHS provided publicly funded health care to all UK permanent residents free at the point of need, being paid for from general taxation. Combined, these changes prompted the reform of local government in England in the mid-20th century.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} very similar in {{appearance}} to the Fea's petrel, but is smaller. The size difference and lighter flight may not be apparent at sea, especially with lone birds, but a recent study helped to clarify other useful features. Zino's has a diagnostically small, delicate, often rather long and slender bill, which may be obvious in the most slender-billed examples, which are probably mostly females, but {{can be difficult to}} determine in larger-billed, probably adult male, birds. Another useful feature is a large whitish panel on the underwing. The wing panel is exclusive to Zino's but is only shown by 15% of the birds. Zino's has a more rounded wing tip, but P. feae deserti sometimes shows a rounded wing tip, so this feature is not diagnostic. Previously suggested criteria such as head, upperwing and flank <b>patterns</b> <b>were</b> found to be inconclusive. Off the eastern United States and the Azores, both Macronesian petrels are easily distinguished from the larger Bermuda petrel by that species' upperparts, which are uniformly dark but for a pale grey rump.|$|E
