40|$|DE 102008016137 A 1 UPAB: 20090604 NOVELTY - The method {{involves}} arranging a <b>receiver</b> <b>unit</b> of a transmitter and <b>receiver</b> <b>unit</b> (1) in {{a spatial}} area around a transmitter, and receiving signals of the transmitter by the <b>receiver</b> <b>unit.</b> Position signals are {{received by the}} <b>receiver</b> <b>unit,</b> and the signals and the position signals are evaluated for determining a position of the transmitter relative {{to a position of}} the <b>receiver</b> <b>unit.</b> Optical and/or acoustically sensible signals are generated based on the determined relative position of the transmitter to the <b>receiver</b> <b>unit</b> for direction- supported navigation at the position of the transmitter. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a system for positioning a transmitter with a receiving device for receiving position signals. USE - Method for positioning a transmitter i. e. radio transmitter (claimed), to position a person and an object e. g. container and vehicle. ADVANTAGE - The signals of the transmitter received by the <b>receiver</b> <b>unit</b> and the position signals are evaluated for determining the position of the transmitter relative to the position of the <b>receiver</b> <b>unit,</b> thus determining and outputting the positions of the transmitter and <b>receiver</b> <b>units</b> relative to each other in a reliable, accurate and safe manner, and hence positioning the transmitter in a precise, fast and safe manner...|$|R

50|$|A typical HTIB {{generally}} {{consists of}} a central <b>receiver</b> <b>unit</b> which usually contains a DVD player (some systems separate the DVD player into a separate unit), a multi-channel power amplifier {{and a series of}} speakers for surround sound use, generally including a subwoofer. Some HTIB systems also have a radio tuner or an Internet-based streaming audio platform (e.g. Spotify). The least expensive systems usually have a passive subwoofer, which is amplified by the <b>receiver</b> <b>unit.</b> HTIB systems do not include a television set or monitor with which to display the visual material or a stand to place the <b>receiver</b> <b>unit</b> on. Beside auxiliary inputs, many of them are equipped today with HDMI with ARC, optical and SPDIF inputs.|$|R
5000|$|Flash servos {{and radio}} triggers, e.g. PocketWizard, can {{function}} as galvanic isolators as well, since trigger and <b>receiver</b> <b>unit</b> remain physically separate. The camera will only [...] "see" [...] the low voltage {{provided by the}} local trigger unit {{necessary in order to}} detect the camera's trigger impulse, and the remote <b>receiver</b> <b>unit</b> will handle up to 200 volts from its flash port, thus isolating the camera from the flash's high voltage trigger circuit.|$|R
5000|$|HCPVT {{active cooling}} enables {{the use of}} much higher power thermal-photovoltaic <b>receiver</b> <b>units,</b> {{generating}} typically 1-100 kilowatts electric, as compared to HCPV systems that mostly rely upon passive cooling of single ~20W cells. Such high-power receivers utilize dense arrays of cells mounted on a high-efficiency heat sink.

50|$|A {{wireless}} microphone is a microphone without a physical cable connecting it {{directly to the}} sound recording or amplifying equipment with which it is associated. Also known as a radio microphone, it has a small, battery-powered radio transmitter in the microphone body, which transmits the audio signal from the microphone by radio waves to a nearby <b>receiver</b> <b>unit,</b> which recovers the audio. The other audio equipment {{is connected to the}} <b>receiver</b> <b>unit</b> by cable.

40|$|Circuit {{requirements}} of a direct-conversion FLEX <b>paging</b> <b>receiver</b> with the zero-crossing interpolation demodulator are derived by means of high-level simulation.

Official specifications on radio <b>paging</b> <b>receivers</b> are introduced to ensure the minimum performance. It is shown that an RF front end with 25 -dB gain, 5. 3 -dB noise figure, and 11 -dBm second order intercept point makes the receiver qualified for the sensitivity, desensitization, and intermodulation requirements...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1997 Intra- and {{interplant}} {{movement and}} dispersal of the predator mites Neoseiulus californicus (McGregor) and Neoseiulus fallacis (Garman) were studied on both lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus L.) and apple (Malus pumila Miller) branch plant systems that were seeded with excess {{numbers of the}} spider mite Tetranychus urticae Koch. Individuals of either predator {{were randomly selected from}} colonies of well-fed, mixed-age adult females and moved to test plants. When tested separately in each plant system, median leaf positions of N. californicus from the point of release were greater than those of N. fallacis at 1 - 8 d. A fan placed in front of a common source unit (1 x 3 m) containing T. urticae and near equal densities of both predaceous mites, provided continuous air (wind) to 3 isolated <b>receiver</b> <b>units</b> located 2. 5, 5, and 7. 5 m downwind. <b>Receiver</b> <b>units</b> consisted of continuous bean foliage with excess T. urticae, but no predators. Wind speeds at the source and each <b>receiver</b> <b>unit</b> averaged 2. 2, 0. 9, 0. 4, and 0. 03 m/s respectively. As predators eliminated prey, N. fallacis dispersed earlier at higher prey densities and further downwind than N. californicus, but cumulative densities of each predator in all <b>receiver</b> <b>units</b> were alike after 20 d. Results of both plant movement studies supported the hypothesis that N. californicus has dispersal traits more like those of a generalist predator of spider mites than does N. fallacis. Spatial patterns of dispersal and biological control of pest mites are discussed in relation to predation types within the Phytoseiidae...|$|R
