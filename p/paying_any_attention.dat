25|$|The {{treaties}} of 1815 stirred him up up {{like some}} personal offence. He hated Wellington with a straightforward hate that pleased the masses; and for seventeen years, scarcely <b>paying</b> <b>any</b> <b>attention</b> to intermediate events, he had magnificently maintained his sadness over Waterloo. In his death throes, at his final hour, he had hugged to his breast a sword that the {{officers of the}} Hundred Days had presented to him. Napoleon died uttering the word armée, Lamarque uttering the word patrie – homeland.|$|E

2500|$|During the Litany, Dr. Stewart {{was ordered}} by an {{attending}} Union officer {{to say the}} Prayer for the President of the United States that Dr. Stewart had omitted without saying any other prayer in its place. [...] Dr. Stewart proceeded without <b>paying</b> <b>any</b> <b>attention</b> to the interruption; but a captain and six of his soldiers, who {{were present in the}} congregation to provoke an incident, drew their swords and pistols, strode into the chancel, seized the clergyman while he was still kneeling, held pistols to his head, and forced him out of the church, and through the streets, just as he was, in his surplice and stole, and committed him to the guard-house of the 8th Illinois Cavalry. Dr. Stewart was soon released, but was not allowed to continue to officiate at services. [...] Immediately thereafter, the St. Paul’s sanctuary was closed and was used {{for the duration of the}} War as a hospital for the wounded.|$|E

[...] "Joe Jelke and {{two other}} boys were along, {{and none of the}} three could manage to take their eyes off her, even to say hello to me. She had one of those {{exquisite}} rose skins frequent in our part of the country, and beautiful until the little veins begin to break at about forty; now, flushed with the cold, it was a riot of lovely delicate pinks like many carnations. She and Joe had reached some sort of reconciliation, or at least he was too far gone in love to remember last night; but I saw that though she laughed a lot she wasn't really <b>paying</b> <b>any</b> <b>attention</b> to him or any of them. She wanted them to go, so that there'd be a message from the kitchen, but I knew that the message wasn't coming—that she was safe. There was talk of the Pump and Slipper dance at New Haven and of the Princeton Prom, and then, in various moods, we four left and separated quickly outside. I walked home with a certain depression of spirit and lay for an hour in a hot bath thinking that vacation was all over for me now that she was gone; feeling, even more deeply than I had yesterday, that she was out of my life." ...|$|E
2500|$|Confucianism's unchallenged {{domination}} of Chinese culture and thought was greatly weakened during the Jin dynasty, {{which led to}} a wide diversification of political thought and philosophy {{by the time of the}} Northern and Southern dynasties. [...] This era produced a myriad of writers that advocated practical systems of governance and administration, such as Cao Cao and Zhuge Liang in the Three Kingdoms Period, Wang Dao and Bao Jingyan of the Eastern Jin, as well as Fan Zhen, Xing Shao (...) , and Fan Xun (...) of the Northern and Southern period. [...] Much of the philosophy of the period is despondent and dispirited, and a number of scholars and poets became reclusive mountain hermits living apart from society. [...] Of these various trends, the most influential was Neo-Daoism (...) [...] [...] Neo-Daoism was highly influential during the Southern Dynasty, to the point that Emperor Wen of Liu Song established a Neo-Daoist Academy and promoted it, along with Confucianism, literature, and history, as the four great subjects of study. [...] A phenomenon known as [...] "empty chat" [...] (...) became common, where educated men would meet and talk about philosophy all day without <b>paying</b> <b>any</b> <b>attention</b> to [...] "mundane" [...] things such as their profession or family. [...] The phenomenon gradually waned during the Sui dynasty, though it did not fully disappear until the Tang dynasty.|$|E
