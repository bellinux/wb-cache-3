2500|$|Pension trusts are {{the most}} {{economically}} significant kind of trust, as they compose over £1trillion worth of retirement savings in the UK. Partly because of this, and also because occupational pension savers pay for their retirement through their work, the regulation of pensions differs considerable from general trust law. The interpretation and construction of a pension trust deed must comply with the basic term of mutual trust and confidence in the employment relationship. Employees are entitled to be informed by their employer {{about how to make}} the best of their pension rights. Moreover, workers must be treated equally, on grounds of gender or otherwise, in their pension entitlements. The management of a pension trust must be partly codetermined by the <b>pension</b> <b>beneficiaries,</b> so that a minimum of one third of a trustee board are elected or [...] "member nominated trustees". The Secretary of State has the power by regulation, as yet unused, to increase the minimum up to one half. Trustees are charged with the duty to manage the fund in the best interests of the beneficiaries, in a way that reflects their general preferences, by investing the savings in company shares, bonds, real estate or other financial products. There is a strict prohibition on the misapplication of any assets. Unlike the general position for a trustee's duty of care, the Pensions Act 1995 section 33 stipulates that trustee investment duties may not be excluded by the trust deed.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are three}} [...] "pillars" [...] of the UK pension system, which aim to ensure dignity {{and a fair}} income in retirement. The first pillar is the state pension, {{administered}} by the government, and funded by National Insurance contributions. The third pillar is private, or [...] "personal pensions", which individuals buy themselves. The second pillar, and deriving from the contract of employment, is occupational pensions. Traditionally, these came from a collective agreement, or from an employer setting one up. The Pensions Act 2008 gives every [...] "jobholder" [...] (defined as a worker, age 16 to 75, with wages between £5,035 and £33,540) {{the right to be}} automatically enrolled by the employer in an occupational pension, unless the jobholder chooses to opt out. This is a simple [...] "defined contribution" [...] scheme: whatever the jobholder contributes, they get out. Although collectively invested, benefits are individualised, meaning the risk of living longer and running out of money grows. To reduce administration costs, a non-departmental trust fund called the National Employment Savings Trust was established as a [...] "public option" [...] competing with private asset managers. Employers set aside an agreed percentage of jobholders' wages, and negotiate how much they will contribute. This is particularly important for people who do not created a union and collective bargained for an occupational pension. Collectively bargained pensions are often better, and historically had [...] "defined benefits": on retirement, people receive money based either on their final salary, or a career average of earnings {{for the rest of their}} lives. Living longer does not become an individual risk, but is collectivised among all contributors. In principle, the rules for pension trusts differ from ordinary law of trusts as pensions are not gifts and people pay for their benefits through their work. Pensions operating through contracts also engender mutual trust and confidence in the employment relationship. An employer is under a duty to inform their staff about how to make the best of their pension rights. Moreover, workers must be treated equally, on grounds of gender or otherwise, in their pension entitlements. The management of a pension trust must be partly codetermined by the <b>pension</b> <b>beneficiaries,</b> so that a minimum of one third of a trustee board are elected or [...] "member nominated trustees".

40|$|International {{portfolio}} investment of Canadian pension funds {{is restricted to}} 20 per cent {{of the value of}} assets. This policy increases non-diversifiable risk in portfolio returns, which entails costs for <b>pension</b> plan <b>beneficiaries.</b> We provide new estimates of the cost of this policy by comparing performance of mutual funds that are constrained by the limit and those that are not. We further examine the effects of an increase in the limit, from 10 to 20 per cent, during the early 1990 s. The evidence suggests the policy has had a significant negative effect on risk-adjusted returns to retirement savings in Canada. Our estimates imply that a movement in the limit from 20 per cent to 30 percent would increase average annual returns by 0. 31 per cent, which corresponds to an increase of 9. 9 per cent in terminal portfolio wealth over a 20 -year period...|$|R

30|$|In {{order to}} deal with the {{potential}} endogeneity (e.g. reverse causality) of retirement and cognitive functioning, we also estimated an Instrumental Variable (IV) model. As instruments for retirement, we use the number of months since Pension 65 has been operating in the district of the respondent and the total number of <b>Pension</b> 65 <b>beneficiaries</b> in the district in October–November 2012, just before the ESBAM data was collected. Both variables are obtained from administrative data of Pension 65. We exploit the variation in the timing of implementation of the programme across districts and argue that observing a stronger presence of Pension 65 in the district increases the expectation of an individual to receive the transfer. Results from this analysis, at the first stage, show that a stronger presence of the Pension 65 programme in the district is statistically associated with an increase in the probability of retirement. At the second stage, the results show that the error terms of the reduced form and main equation are uncorrelated and there is no endogeneity problem. This suggests that applying a Tobit model is appropriate and brings unbiased estimates.|$|R

Based upon a set of widely recognized problems drawn from the psychology literature, we assess their discount functions, their willingness to risk their own money and others money, their appreciation of probability, and their use of evidence to solve problems. For comparison, where appropriate we report the results of the same testing regime applied to a group of Oxford undergraduates. Our goals are fourfold: first, to demonstrate the nature of trustee competence in decision making; second, to demonstrate the range of trustee responses to problems relevant to investment; third, to assess trustees risk appetites in relation to their own and others money; and fourth, to draw implications from these results for the governance of trustee boards and their relationships with advisers and service providers. It is shown that trustee competence is surprisingly heterogeneous, and the lack of common approaches to problems relevant to investment practice has significant implications for fund governance. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{elaborate}} a detailed survey concerning the access rules to public pensions benefits across twenty European, Asian and American countries, {{which are then}} compared to the Brazilian system. This system has practically no constraint upon death pensions claims, what makes {{it one of the}} world?s most generous arrangements. In the case of retirement benefits, among the sample countries Brazil is the country with the laxest rules for scheduled retirement concessions. Unlike Brazil, all of them define a minimum age limit and most do not distinguish between genders or among social categories. Following this comparison, we empirically simulate the application of each country?s different rules to the Brazilian demographic pattern. We attest that in all of these cases there is either a reduction of beneficiaries, a cut {{in the value of the}} benefits, or both. Finally, we estimate the hypothetic case where we decreased the value of the benefit, but no exclusion of beneficiaries was made. Using that potentially saved amount, we estimated the impact on poverty and on income distribution of an alternative redistribution of that sum. The results indicate a fall in the level of poverty among children and teenagers and stability in the poverty level among the usual public <b>pensions</b> system <b>beneficiaries.</b> ...|$|R
5000|$|Despite habitually {{occupying the}} most privileged {{position}} in UK corporate governance, shareholders in large public companies {{listed on the}} London Stock Exchange infrequently exercise their governance rights. Institutional investors, including pension funds, mutual funds and insurance funds, own most shares. Thousands or perhaps millions of persons, particularly through <b>pensions,</b> are <b>beneficiaries</b> from the returns on shares. Historically institutions have often not voted or participated in general meetings on their beneficiaries' behalf, and often display an uncritical pattern of supporting management. However, institutional investors also often work [...] "behind the scenes" [...] to secure better corporate governance for their members, through informal but direct communication with management. Individual shareholders form an increasingly small part of total investments, while foreign investment and institutional investor ownership have grown their share steadily over the last forty years. Institutional investors, who deal with other peoples' money, are bound by fiduciary obligations, deriving from the law of trusts and obligations to exercise care deriving from the common law. Now the Stewardship Code 2010, drafted by the Financial Reporting Council (the corporate governance watchdog), reinforces the duty on institutions to actively engage in governance affairs by disclosing their voting policy, voting record and voting.

40|$|In Norway, {{pensions}} are conceived to be a right, {{and perhaps}} not an earned benefit. Changes in the demographic structure in the Norwegian population have produced a need for pension accumulation outside the public scope. This is {{taken care of by}} the component anchored in an employment relationship of the pension mix. This thesis occupies itself with the market for occupational pensions in Norway. Specifically, it is occupied with an organization where the employees are enrolled in a defined-benefit pension plan with the Norwegian Public Service Pension Fund. The thesis seeks to view the uncertainties and risks associated with pension accumulation from a corporate perspective, and provides less attention to the <b>pension</b> plan <b>beneficiaries</b> and regulatory frameworks affecting financial service providers. Ideal types are constructed in order to produce variation and comparative outcomes between the two available pension designs, as well as to identify how legislative caps affect pension accumulation. The analysis and discussions provide conclusions that are in line with recent literature. Defined-contribution pension plan design provides full certainty for the employers through transfer of risk to the employees. In addition, the thesis provides arguments contrary to popular belief. Defined-contribution pension plans may very well produce identical lifelong annual retirement income to a defined-benefit design. All it takes are certain returns to capital and substantial annual accumulation rates from the sponsoring organization. This implies that with certain characteristics, a best scenario outcome can be produced for both participants in the employment relationship...|$|R

Marginal benefit incidence analysis for 2003, 2006, and 2009 suggests that the contribution of cash transfers to the reduction of disposable income inequality and poverty rose markedly between 2006 and 2009 primarily due to the launching of a noncontributory pension program - the pension moratorium - in 2004.

Using a hand collected data set on governance factors, the study shows that the external and internal governance mechanisms in pension plans are weak. One explanation for this weakness is the potential conflict between the <b>pension</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> and the fund’s owner, which depends on who bears the investment risk in the pension plan. Hence, different governance factors are found to be important for pension fund return on invested assets and also for its economic performance. Consequently, the overall policy conclusion is that more focus should be put on the governance of the pension funds, taking into account the different interests of the beneficiaries and owners as it may determine their performance...|$|E

30|$|Concerning {{the other}} regressors {{included}} in Table  2, and aside from social security incentives, our {{results show that}} having {{a high level of}} education, approximated by the job qualification, affects the hazard rate to both types of routes negatively.

This is a recurrent finding in empirical studies of retirement behaviour, as also found in Blanco (2000) where individuals with a high qualification try to delay the date of retirement. It is surprising the negative effect that perceiving a disability pension has on the hazard rate to both types of risks. The explanation for this counterintuitive sign is the legislation itself, which states that disability pensions will become retirement <b>pensions</b> once the <b>beneficiaries</b> turn 65  years of age. 11 We finally notice which variables have a differential impact on the hazard rates to both types of risks. In particular, both perceiving an unemployment benefit and the number of years of contribution to the system {{have a negative effect on}} the hazard rate to partial retirement while a positive effect on the hazard rate to full retirement.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{some positive}} and normative {{aspects of the}} inflation indexation {{of public and private}} pensions. The analysis shows that alternative indexing arrangements may have far less impact on actual patterns of risk bearing than is usually thought to be the case. In so far as inflation indexing has real effects, there is no presumption that they are beneficial. In particular, the pre—commitment aspects of public indexing may not be efficient. There are sound reasons to believe that voluntarily agreed on, non—indexed private pensions may well be efficient. Non—indexed pensions may result in an efficient allocation of risks given the other assets and liabilities of <b>pension</b> issuers and <b>beneficiaries.</b> In this case, indexation would impede the efficient allocation of risks. In this paper is also developed an ICOLI (interteinporal cost of living index) which is superior to conventional price indices as a way of evaluating the changes in real well being, associated with changes in wealth. The use of this measure has significant implications for the indexation of pensions, and for the question of what assets should be held in pension portfolios...|$|R
