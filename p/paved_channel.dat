40|$|International audienceOver {{the last}} two centuries, the Upper Rhine River was {{subjected}} to important hydraulic engineering works which have severely damaged its functioning. The Old Rhine is a 50 -km long by-passed single bed <b>paved</b> <b>channel,</b> which is located downstream of the Kembs dam. In 2010, a restoration program was initiated to diversify aquatic and riparian habitats: minimum flow increase and artificial sediment feeding into the channel. A first experimental sedimentary recharge was conducted during the program "INTERREG IV A 2009 - 2012 " in the Rhine by-passed section between Kembs dam and Breisach. In February 2015, ‘Electricité de France’ (EDF, the French hydroelectric power plant manager) implemented a similar artificial sediment recharge in the Old Rhine. In both sediment recharge experiments, the ecological consequences are evaluated with a monitoring program of riparian/aquatic vegetation, benthic macro-invertebrates and fish. A confounding effect with the sediment feeding is the minimum flow increase and an important flood. An analysis {{of the dynamics of}} these biological communities is underway to identify the links between physical changes and ecological functioning. The minimum flow increase induced the development of new habitats on banks. Floods induced bedload transport which makes benthic habitats less stable for invertebrates and plants. The new gravel bars tends to favor the settlement of pioneer plant species and in border, it is characterized by a lower abundance of invasive species compared with the spatio-temporal reference stations. The higher density of invertebrates species which are adapted to sedimentation areas but relatively polluo-tolerant, contributes to a gain in diversity...|$|E

40|$|Mountain debris cones in the Alpine region {{often provide}} space for dense {{population}} and cultivation. Hence, {{a great number}} of buildings are exposed to torrential hazards. In order to protect the settlement areas against flooding and overbank sedimentation, torrent defence structures are implemented at various locations within catchments. Directly at the debris cones, these protection measures often include a deposition basin at the fan apex and/or a confined channel that passes through the settlement. The work presented within this paper deals with the effect of specific outlet structure layouts, situated {{at the lower end of}} a selected deposition basin, on bed-load transport processes and flood protection. A case study analysis was accomplished comprising a 3 -D numerical model (FLOW- 3 D) and a physical scale model test (1 : 30). The subject of investigation was the deposition basin of the Larsennbach torrent in the Austrian Northern Limestone Alps. The basin is situated on a large debris cone and opens out into a <b>paved</b> <b>channel.</b> Since the basin is undersized and the accumulation of sediment in the outlet section reduces the available cross section during floods, adjoining settlements are considerably endangered of lateral overtopping of both clear water and sediment. Aiming for an upgrade in flood protection, certain layouts for a "closing-off structure" at the outlet were tested within this project. For the most efficient design layout, its effect on flood protection, a continuous bed-load output from the basin and the best possible use of the retention volume are pointed out. The simple design of the structure and the key aspects that have to be taken into consideration for implementation are highlighted...|$|E
40|$|In the {{mountain}} territory {{the majority of}} the population and of the productive activities are concentrated in the proximity of torrents or over alluvial fans. Here, when intense rainfall occurs, debris flow or hyper-concentrated flow events can produce serious problems to the population with possible casualties. On the other hand, {{the majority of the}}se problems could be overcome with accurate hazard mapping, disaster prevention planning and mitigation structures (e. g. silt check dams, paved channels, weirs [...] .). Good and reliable mathematical and numerical models, able to accurately describe these phenomena are therefore necessary. Debris flows and hyper-concentrated flows can be adequately represented by means of a mixture of a fluid (usually water) and a solid phase (granular sediment, e. g. sand, gravel [...] .), flowing over complex and composite topography. Complex topography is related to complicated bed elevation variety inasmuch as there are slopes, channels, human artifacts and so on. On the other hand, topography is composite because every type of flow can encounter two different bed behaviors: the mobile bed and the fixed bed. In the first case, mass can be exchanged between the bed and the flow, so the bottom elevation can change in time. In the second case (fixed bed case), this mass transfer is inhibited, due to the presence of a rigid bottom, such as bedrock or concrete, and the bottom cannot change in time. The first objective of the work presented in this thesis concerns the development of a new type of hyperbolic mathematical model for free-surface two-phase hyper-concentrated flows able to describe in a single way the fixed bed, the mobile bed and also the transition between them. The second objective, strictly connected with the first, is the development of a numerical scheme that implements this mathematical model in an accurate and efficient way. In the framework of finite-volume methods with Godunov approach, the fluxes are evaluated solving a Riemann Problem (RP). A RP is an initial value problem related to a set of PDEs equations wherein, in a certain point, there is a discontinuity separating different left and right initial constant states. However, if the topography is composite, a new type of Riemann problem, called Composite Riemann Problem (CRP), occurs. In a CRP, not only the initial constant states, but also the relevant PDEs systems change across the discontinuity. This additional complexity makes the general solution of the CRP quite challenging to obtain. The first part of the work is devoted to the derivation of the PDEs systems describing the fixed- and mobile-bed behaviors. Starting from the 3 D discrete equations valid for each phase (continuous fluid and solid granular) and using suitable average processes the 3 D continuous equations (continuous fluid and solid) are obtained. Introducing the shallow water approximation and performing the depth average process, the 2 D fully two-phase models for free-surface flow over fixed- and mobile-bed are derived. The isokinetic approximation, which states the equality between the velocity of the solid phase and the liquid phase, is then used, ending up with the so-called two-phase isokinetic models. Finally, an exhaustive comparison between the fixed- and the mobile-bed fully two-phase models, the two-phase isokinetic models and others models proposed in the literature is presented. The second part of the work concerns the definition and, mainly, the solution of the CRP from a mathematical point of view. Firstly, a general strategy for the CRP solution is developed. It allows to couple different hyperbolic systems that are physically compatible (e. g. fixed-bed with mobile-bed systems, free-surface flow with pressurized flow), also if they have a different number of equations. The resulting CRP solution is composed of a single PDEs system, called Composite PDEs system, whose properties, under some assumptions, degenerate to the properties of the original PDEs systems. The general strategy is developed using the simplest 1 D isokinetic models for the fixed bed and the mobile bed (i. e. PDEs systems valid only for low concentration). Coherently with the generality of the CRP solution method, the low concentration constraint is then relaxed, ending up with a Composite PDEs system describing also high concentrated flows. From the numerical point of view, all the developed Composite systems are integrated using the finite-volume method with Godunov fluxes. These fluxes are evaluated using three different approximated Riemann solvers: the Generalized Roe solver, the LHLL solver and the Universal Osher solver. All the solvers are analyzed and an exhaustive comparison between them is performed, highlighting pros and cons. The schemes are second order accurate in space and time, and this has been achieved by means of the MUSCL approach. Finally numerical schemes have been parallelized using OpenMP standard. All the models are then tested comparing analytical and numerical solutions. The results are satisfactory, with an accurate agreement between the two solutions in the majority of the physically-based test cases. There is only some small issue when the simulations are performed in a few resonant cases. However, these problems arise in not realistic situations, so it is impossible to encounter them in real situations. Also a realistic application is presented (i. e. the evolution of a trench over partially <b>paved</b> <b>channel),</b> proving the capabilities of both the mathematical approach and the numerical scheme...|$|E

5000|$|Early written {{documents}} {{record the}} local presence of migrating {{salmon in the}} ‘'Rio Guadalupe'’ dating {{as far back as}} the 18th century. Archaeological remains of salmon were found dating through A.D. 300 in the lower watershed in what is now North San Jose. On February 22, 1904 the San Jose Daily Mercury (now the San Jose Mercury News) reported [...] "Several large salmon and steelheads have become stranded in the holes, and after the water has subsided they have become the prey to boys. Several large salmon have been captured even in the city limits." [...] Both steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and chinook or king salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) continue to make spawn in the river, making San Jose the southernmost major U. S. city with known salmon spawning runs, the other major cities being Anchorage; Seattle; Portland and Sacramento. [...] Runs of up to 1,000 chinook salmon swam up the Guadalupe River each fall in the 1990s, but were decimated by man-made barriers to their breeding grounds by impassable culverts, weirs and wide, exposed and flat concrete <b>paved</b> <b>channels</b> installed by the SCVWD for flood control. By 2006 less than 40 king salmon were counted, although two managed to get up to Los Gatos that year and spawn below the California State Route 17 Freeway bridge over Los Gatos Creek in back of the Pruneyard Shopping Center. No Chinook have been seen until November, 2011 when they were documented with photo and video, the apparent offspring of the 2006 spawners. From 1992-1994 a genetic study of mitochondrial DNA in 29 fish showed that some have haplotypes not found in Central Valley wild or hatchery salmon, but found in the Russian River. Two subsequent analyses found that chinook salmon in the Guadalupe River are mainly fall run Central Valley chinook, but also that some were genetically similar to lower Columbia River basin salmon. This is significant because the California Coast Chinook salmon Evolutionarily Significant Unit (ESU) was considered federally threatened September 16, 1999 (64 FR 50394) and reaffirmed June 28, 2005 (70 FR 37160), although the Russian River is normally considered the southernmost limit for this ESU. Chinook salmon are adept at colonizing neighboring and even distant streams and rivers, as evidence by the recent finding of juvenile Chinook salmon from the Klamath River in the Napa River. In 2012, the Santa Clara Valley Habitat Plan reported that Chinook salmon currently spawn in the Guadalupe River and its tributaries, as well as Coyote Creek. Because Chinook spawn in early winter and juveniles may migrate to the ocean in their first spring, Chinook are able to use habitats that turn very warm or have low water quality in summer.|$|R

40|$|Eukaryotic K+ {{channels}} {{from the}} SLO family (SLO 1, SLO 2 and SLO 3) provide {{a link between}} intracellular signaling and the electrical activity of a cell. The opening and closing (gating) of the three different SLO homologs {{is controlled by the}} synergistic action of membrane voltage and specific intracellular cues: Ca 2 + binding in SLO 1, Na+ binding in SLO 2 and pH increase in SLO 3. It is known that intracellular signals activate SLO channels by acting on the large cytoplasmic domains (CTDs) of these proteins, which follows the transmembrane ionconduction pore. However, a molecular description of the mechanisms of intracellular gating in SLO channels is still lacking. In this thesis, I present biochemical, structural and functional studies aiming at understanding how the activity of SLO 1 and SLO 3 channels is controlled by intracellular Ca 2 + binding and pH increase, respectively. First, I describe recombinant methods for the large-scale expression and purification of functional SLO <b>channels,</b> <b>paving</b> the way for a more complete biochemical and structural analysis of these proteins. Then, I report the crystal structures of the large cytoplasmic domains (CTDs) from two different SLO 1 channels. Structures of the Ca 2 +-bound CTDs from human and zebrafish SLO 1 channels define the precise molecular architecture of SLO 1 ’s Ca 2 +-sensing module: CTDs from the four subunits of a tetrameric SLO 1 channel assemble in a so-called gating ring structure at the intracellular face of the membrane. In conjunction with other studies, these results describe how Ca 2 + binding affects the conformation of one layer of the SLO 1 gating ring, which can explain the Ca 2 +-driven opening of SLO 1 ’s ion conduction pore. Next, I present the crystal structure of the human SLO 3 gating ring. A comparison with the SLO 1 structures suggests that the hSLO 3 structure represents the open conformation of the hSLO 3 gating ring. Finally, I describe functional mutagenesis studies on the mouse SLO 3 ortholog, which reveal a possible mechanism for pH sensing in the mouse SLO 3 channel. Surprisingly, the mechanism I propose appears not to be conserved in SLO 3 channels from other species. This could be a dramatic example of how new functional mechanisms can easily evolve within the very versatile scaffold of a gating ring structure. Altogether, the results presented in this thesis provide a molecular framework to understand the mechanisms of intracellular gating in SLO channels...|$|R
40|$|The Naval Auxiliary Air Station, Whiting Field, {{is to have}} a {{stormwater}} disposal {{system in}} which the existing pipes and terraces under and {{in the vicinity of the}} runways and building area will discharge into <b>paved</b> trapezoidal open <b>channels.</b> Many of the channels join other channels as they pass down the sides of the plateau on which the airfield is located. The grades of the main channels and of many of the lateral channels are such that water flows at supercritical velocities or at velocities greater than that of a gravity wave. The difficulties anticipated in joining two streams of water, one or more of which is flowing at supercritical velocities, led to the request for model studies of several of the channel junctions. The primary objectives in the present study include (1) the development of junction designs for specified operating conditions which would result in reasonably smooth flow downstream of the junction and (2) the determination of the necessary wall heights in the vicinity of the junction. Economic and structural considerations involved in the junction designs were considered in the final selection. Dependent upon the junction design, the discharges, velocities, and related phenomena of the flow in the vicinity of the junction, a hydraulic jump may form in one or both of the inlet channels. This may necessitate a large increase in the height of the sidewalls in the vicinity of the junction. On the other hand, if the flow passes through the junction at velocities greater than the critical, standing waves may form which have a height greatly in excess of a normal freeboard and which continue to oscillate back and forth across the channel for a considerable distance downstream from the junction before being damped by frictional forces. These standing waves necessitate higher sidewalls not only in the vicinity of the junction but for a considerable distance downstream. As available information on junctions of this type is almost nonexistent, it was necessary to resort to model studies in order to determine the flow conditions and the minimum sidewall heights. Two general types of junctions were studied. One type consists of the junction of two large channels in which the lateral and inlet main have comparable discharges. The other type, called terrace outlets, consists of a junction between a main channel and a terrace channel having a relatively small discharge. The maximum discharge ranges from 380 to 960 cfs in the main channels and from 25 to 70 cfs in the terrace channels. The maximum velocity of flow encountered is approximately 30 fps...|$|R
