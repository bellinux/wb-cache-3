On the other hand, the practice shows that the existence of the national framework for youth support, as a local service network intended for youths, is not a crucial <b>prerequisite</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> the current situation when it comes to improving {{the quality of life of}} young people, but that the existence of the critical level of youth activism is a key driving force that leads to changes. This paper presents an overview of the level of youth activism in the city of Belgrade. The results show that young people accept a proactive attitude to life when it comes to their personal or family problems and issues whilst the engagement in the social field and especially a political one are not seen as a preferable type of behaviour...|$|E
40|$|This {{review of}} {{research}} literature about {{training in the}} skills of teaching indicates that change in skills can be brought about through different training methods, with different training populations, and in different training settings. This analysis of the literature was designed to assess the comparative contribution {{of a set of}} selected variables to gains in teaching skill. The variables were classified under three general categories: training variables, trainee variables, and setting variables. Of central interest in the review was the conceptual-observational instruction method of training. This instruction is based upon well-defined concepts that include the components of concept definition, exemplification, identification, and application. The favored medium was videotape or film. In over half of the studies reviewed, practice was provided in actually using the targeted skills of teaching. Feedback to the trainee {{on the use of the}} targeted skills was provided in almost all of the studies. The role of conceptual learning in the develipment of teaching skills is analyzed, and it is pointed out that training must result in understanding as a <b>prerequisite</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> in skill. It is also suggested that consistency of practice conditions is conducive to optimal skill acquisition.

A <b>prerequisite</b> <b>to</b> behaviour <b>change</b> is a shift in attitudes. This study sought to identify effective ways of assessing and changing attitudes and behaviours towards IPV to prevent HIV infection in a developing country context. Combining a systematic review of current evidence with advanced statistical analyses of data from a southern Africa regional household survey (n = 20, 639), Soul City Regional Evaluation Phase 1, findings indicate that: a gold standard to measure IPV attitudes and behaviours is needed; interventions targeting structural change and based in the community are more effective; the effectiveness of mass media interventions may not be robust; the interaction of different prevention interventions may mediate overall effectiveness.

40|$|Mutation is {{the engine}} of {{evolution}} in that it generates the genetic variation on which the evolutionary process depends. To understand the evolutionary process we must therefore characterize the rates and patterns of mutation. Starting with the seminal Luria andDelbruck fluctuation experiments in 1943, studies utilizing a variety of approaches have revealed much about mutation rates and patterns and about how these may vary between different bacterial strains and species along the chromosome and between different growth condi-tions. This work provides a critical overview of the results and conclusions drawn from these studies, of the debate surrounding some of these conclusions, and of the challenges faced when studying mutation {{and its role in}} bacterial evolution. Genetic variation is a <b>prerequisite</b> <b>to</b> evolu-tionary <b>change.</b> In the absence of such var-iation, no subsequent change can be achieved. Genetic variation is ultimately all generated by mutation. It is therefore clear that mutation is a major evolutionary force that must be studied and understood to understand evolution. Yet...|$|R
40|$|Despite nearly {{continuous}} poverty, {{farm workers}} in California {{during the past}} cen-tury organized unions and initiated strikes over control issues as well as wages. The control emphases contradicts {{the expectations of the}} dominant paradigm in labor relations, as well as Marxian perspectives which view control or qualitative issues as being concentrated among segments of the working class in advanced industrial sectors. It is proposed that the logic of the farm workers'situation in agriculture ac-counts for the continuity and pervasiveness of their control strikes. Because of the impermanence of wage gains alone, farm workers have had to seek control as a <b>prerequisite</b> <b>to</b> other <b>changes</b> in their conditions of life and work. One means the rural poor have historically taken to improve their living and working condi-tions has been to organize labor unions. Analysts of American labor conflicts have, however, focused on the militancy of white industrial and urban workers as a source of data relevant to theories of labor unionism. They have neglected significant long-term patterns of militancy of the rural, agricultural working class, including workers from minority groups.

40|$|Professionals' {{accounts}} {{of working in}} challenging service environments bring into relief the tensions they experience in their work. An ethical dilemma where the wellbeing of a severely or profoundly learning disabled (LD) and highly dependent person is at stake is conceptually and emotionally challenging to those responsible for finding some resolution. This report develops the findings of empirical research described in an earlier paper on professionals' experiences of addressing serious ethical issues within their work with people with LD. We attempt to make clear how the ethical and policy frameworks {{to which they are}} accountable, their personal desire {{to improve the lives of}} people with LD and the relational aspects of their work raises strong feelings that make the work, at times, intolerable and at other times richly rewarding. Regardless, being in relation to the person with LD is <b>prerequisite</b> <b>to</b> making <b>changes</b> in their lives; therefore, the relational as well as procedural aspects of services provided by professionals need to be theorised. We offer a critique of these professionals' perspectives based on a distinction between instrumental and substantial rationalities, the latter being relatively absent in the managerial and scientific discourses within the NHS. This absence risks dehumanising clients and professionals and neglecting what is core to their work: the privilege of being with unique others, bearing witness to their histories and supporting them to live their lives. © 2009, Emerald Group Publishing Limite...|$|R
40|$|Business process {{improvement}} {{is a common}} approach in increasing the effectiveness of an organization. It {{can be seen as}} an effort to increase coordination between units. Process improvement has proved to be challenging, and most management consultation firms facilitate organizations in this kind of initiatives. Cross-functional improvement {{is one of the main}} areas for internal consultants as well. However, the needs, challenges and means of cross-functional help have been rarely discussed in the literature. The objective of this thesis is on one hand to present a conceptual and descriptive framework to help understand the challenges of facilitating coordination improvement efforts in cross-functional improvement programs, and on the other hand to develop and test feasible solutions for some facilitation situations. The research questions are: 1. 	Why and in what kind of situations do organizations need help in developing coordination in cross-functional processes? 2. 	How can a facilitator help organizations in improving coordination to develop cross-functional processes? The study consists of two parts. The first part is an overview of the dissertation, and the second part comprises six research publications. The theoretical background for the study are the differentiation causing challenges in cross-functional settings, the coordination needed <b>to</b> improve processes, <b>change</b> management principles, methods and tools, and consultation practises. Three of the publications introduce tools for helping in developing prerequisites, planning responsibilities and supporting learning during the cross-functional program. The three other papers present frameworks to help understand and analyse the improvement situation. The main methodological approaches used in this study are design science research, action research and case research. The research data has been collected from ten cases representing different kinds of organizations, processes and developing situations. The data has been collected mainly by observation, semi-structured interviews and questionnaires. The research contributes to the rare literature combining coordination theories and {{process improvement}} practises. It also provides additional understanding of a holistic point of view in process improvement situations. The most important contribution is the addition to the theories of facilitating change in process improvement situations. From the managerial point of view, this study gives advice to managers and consultants in planning and executing cross-functional programs. The main factors increasing the need for facilitation are the challenges for differentiation, challenges of organizational change in general, and the novelty of initiatives and improvement practices concerning process development. Organizations need help in creating the <b>prerequisites</b> <b>to</b> <b>change,</b> in planning initiatives, easing conflict management and collaboration between groups, as well as supporting the learning of cross-functional improvement. The main challenges of facilitation are combining the different roles as a consultant, maintaining the ownership for the improvement project with the client, and supporting learning in the client organization...|$|R
40|$|Corresponding author Understanding {{the process}} of {{activity}} scheduling is a critical <b>prerequisite</b> <b>to</b> an understanding <b>changes</b> in travel behavior. To examine this process, a web-based activity survey program, REACT!, was developed to collect household activity scheduling data. REACT! is unique in that it records the evolution of activity schedules from intentions to final outcomes for a multi-day period. This paper summarizes {{an investigation of the}} structure of activity/travel patterns based on a REACT! data set from a pilot study conducted in Irvine, California. The term structure refers to the outcome of a set of decisions facing individuals as they conduct their daily activities. At a minimum, structure can be interpreted as the sequence by which various activities enter one's daily activity scheduling process. Results of the empirical analyses show that activities of shorter duration {{were more likely to be}} opportunistically inserted in a schedule already anchored by longer duration counterparts. Additionally, analysis of tour structure reveals that many trip-chains were formed opportunistically. Travel time required to reach an activity was also positively related to the scheduling horizon for the activity, with more distant stops being planned earlier than closer locations...|$|R

The {{aim of this}} study was to identify by a proteomic approach the most abundant proteins of equine AF. AF samples were collected at parturition from 24 healthy mares that delivered healthy foals. All samples were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) on 4 – 12 % gels. A pool of the 24 samples, after SDS-PAGE, was cut in 25 slices, trypsin-digested and analysed by mass spectrometry (MS) for protein identification. Mean AF protein concentration was 1. 96  ±  1. 12  g/L. Thirty-four proteins were successfully identified by MS and subsequently categorised according to Gene Ontology (GO). Twelve proteins (e. g. fibronectin, lumican, thrombospondin and fibulin) belonged to or interacted with the extracellular matrix (ECM) playing an important role in the development of foetal tissues. Most of the remaining proteins were classified as transport (e. g. albumin, major allergen Equ c 1 and alpha-fetoprotein) delivering nutrients, ions and lipids essential for foetal growth and development. Among these proteins, major allergen Equ c 1 is widely studied in human medicine because it induces Ig-E mediated type I allergic reaction. The absence of immunoglobulins in equine AF was also confirmed...|$|R

40|$|Alpine springs are {{sensitive}} ecotones which are inhabited by highly adapted organisms. Studies {{on how the}} species assemblages change vertically have not been conducted previously. We investigated 35 natural springs along an altitudinal gradient of about 2000 m in a valley in the Bernese Alps over 2 years. The {{aim of this study}} was <b>to</b> investigate the <b>changes</b> of the macroinvertebrate assemblages of natural springs along this gradient and to find out which environmental factors determine the distribution of the species along the altitudinal gradient. The spring fauna was quantitatively sampled three times and a wide range of environmental parameters were measured. The species richness significantly decreased with increasing altitude and the composition of the species assemblages changed distinctively along the altitudinal gradient. The low-elevation springs were dominated by crenobiont species, whereas high-altitude springs were mostly inhabited by taxa typical for Alpine headwaters in general. The mid-altitudinal range was a transition zone where crenobiont and alpine species co-existed. The water temperature was an important factor determining the species richness and the composition of macroinvertebrate assemblages of the springs at different altitudes. Moss, stones and the degree of forestation also had a significant influence on the composition of the macroinvertebrate assemblages. This study helps to understand the distribution of the spring fauna along altitudinal gradients. Knowing the current distribution ranges is an important <b>prerequisite</b> <b>to</b> predict potential <b>changes</b> of the species distribution, caused by global change, in the future. ...|$|R
