40|$|The {{traverse}} of the Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity {{across its}} Meridiani Planum landing site {{has shown that}} wind has affected regolith by creating drifts, dunes, and ubiquitous ripples, by sorting grains during aeolian transport, by forming bright wind streaks downwind from craters seen from orbit, and by eroding rock with abrading, wind-blown material. Pre-landing orbiter observations showed bright and dark streaks tapering away from craters on the Meridiani plains. Further analysis of orbiter images shows that major dust storms can cause bright streak orientations {{in the area to}} alternate between NW and SE, implying bright wind streak materials encountered by Opportunity are transient, potentially mobilized deposits. Opportunity performed the first in situ investigation of a martian wind streak, focusing on a bright patch of material just outside the rim of Eagle crater.

The dominance of LMXBs indicates that X-ray faint early-type galaxies have lost much of their interstellar gas. On the other hand, a modest portion of the X-ray emission from NGC 4697 is due to hot gas. Of the unresolved emission, {{it is likely that}} about half is from fainter unresolved LMXBs, while the other half (∼ 23 % of the total count rate) is from interstellar gas.

40|$|The {{long-term}} (over {{more than}} one decade) X-ray emission from two massive stellar systems known to be particle accelerators is investigated using XMM-Newton.

The two targets, HD 168112 and HD 167971 appear to be overluminous in X-rays, lending additional support {{to the idea that}} a significant contribution of the X-ray emission comes from colliding-wind regions. The variability of the X-ray flux from HD 168112 is interpreted in terms of varying separation expected to follow the 1 /D rule for adiabatic shocked winds. For HD 167971, marginal decrease of the X-ray flux in September 2002 could tentatively be explained by a <b>partial</b> <b>wind</b> eclipse in the close pair. No long-term variability could be demonstrated despite the significant difference of separation between 2002 and 2014.

40|$|We {{investigated}} the orientation {{in relation to}} wind of common swifts, Apus apus, during nocturnal spring and autumn migration. Swifts are highly adapted to a life in the air, showing wind-dependent orientation during nocturnal roosting flights, and {{may be expected to}} be more efficient in their wind drift/compensation behaviour than nocturnal passerine migrants, which are usually subjected to full or <b>partial</b> <b>wind</b> drift. A tracking radar at Lund in southern Sweden was used to record the orientation of common swifts (identified by their characteristic radar echo signature) on nocturnal migration flights and to measure wind conditions at the altitudes at which the birds were flying. Comparing track and heading directions under easterly and westerly winds revealed that the swifts shifted their heading distinctly into the wind, with the result that track directions were similar under the different wind conditions. As this pattern of complete compensation for drift from cross-winds occurred during both spring and autumn migration, there were no indications of differences between age classes. In addition, we found an effect of side-winds on equivalent airspeeds, with swifts increasing their airspeed with increasing wind speed. Such a response has been theoretically predicted as part of an optimal behaviour for counteracting wind drift but has hereto not been empirically demonstrated. There was also a positive correlation between overall wind speed and equivalent airspeed, making it difficult to interpret whether the swifts respond to the total wind speed rather than specifically to the side-wind effect. Our results suggest that important differences may exist between species in their capacities to orient in relation to the wind and that the swift may be particularly efficient in adjusting heading direction and airspeed to obtain complete compensation for wind drift during high-altitude nocturnal migratory flights.

40|$|The slow inward {{flow of the}} hot gas in {{elliptical}} galaxy cooling flows {{is nearly impossible to}} detect directly due to instrumental limitations. However, in rotating galaxies, if the inflowing gas conserves angular momentum, it will eventually form a disk. The X-ray signature of this phenomenon is a flattening of the X-ray isophotes in the inner 1 - 10 kpc region. This effect is observable, so we have searched for it in X-ray observations of six rotating and non-rotating early-type galaxies, obtained mainly with the ROSAT PSPC and HRI imagers. The ellipticities of the X-ray emission never increase toward the central region, nor are the X-ray ellipticities significantly greater than the ellipticities for the optical stellar emission. Central ellipticities in excess of 0. 5 were expected in rotating ellipticals whereas values of 0 - 0. 2 are measured.

Whilst most migrants at Lund are on passage to and from breeding sites in Fennoscandia, {{the majority of the}} migrants at Abisko are close to their breeding sites, and migration at Abisko thus to a large degree reflects initial departure from breeding sites (autumn) or final approach to breeding destinations (spring). The radar data were used to test predictions about differences in orientation and wind drift effects between adult and juvenile birds (a large proportion of autumn migrants consists of juvenile birds on their first journey), between situations far away from or near the goals and between different phases of migration (initial departure, en route passage, final approach to goal). The concentrations (both total and within-night concentrations) of flight directions differed significantly between seasons as well as sites, with the highest concentration at Lund in spring (mean vector length of track directions, r = 0. 79) and lowest at Abisko during spring (r = 0. 35). <b>Partial</b> <b>wind</b> drift and <b>partial</b> compensation were recorded at Lund, with a similar effect size in spring and autumn, whilst possible wind drift effects at Abisko were obscured by the large directional scatter at this site. The results from Lund support the prediction that the high proportion of juveniles in autumn contributes to increase the directional scatter during this season, whilst there was no support for predictions of differential wind drift effects between seasons and situations with different goal distances. The most striking and surprising result was the exceedingly large scatter of flight directions at Abisko, particularly in spring. We suggest that such an exaggerated scatter may be associated with final approach orientation, where migrants reach their specific goals from all various directions by final navigation within a more wide-ranging goal region. The larger scatter of autumn flight directions at Abisko compared to Lund may be due to exploratory flights in variable directions being more common at initial departure from breeding sites than later during migratory passage. These surprising results highlight the importance of studying and analysing orientation during final approach to (and initial departure from) migratory goals for understanding the orientation systems of migratory birds...|$|R

Firing angle control of an anti- parallel connected pair of thyristors provides continuous variation of reactive power. Modelling of the three winding transformer in PSCAD/EMTDC reveals the design criteria and performance of the proposed scheme. Automatic control of thyristor valves will be achieved by sensing the reactive power in the primary winding, i. e. low voltage winding. The exact magnitude of the firing angle for the thyristors at which the primary winding supplies only real power for overcoming losses and attains almost unity power factor, will be determined by a PI controller. Thus, only the real component of current is required from the supply. Nearly all the reactive power of the iron core and TCR counterbalances the leading VArs produced by the generator insulation. Fine tuning of thyristor firing angles avoids any over or under compensation of the system.

The stellar wind and the orbit may be dominant factors determining the jet properties beyond the binary scales. } An analytical study is performed to characterize the effects of the stellar wind and the orbital motion on the jet properties. Accounting for the wind thrust transferred to the jet, we derive analytical estimates to characterize the jet evolution under the impact of the stellar wind. We include the Coriolis force effect, induced by orbital motion and enhanced by the wind presence. Large-scale evolution of the jet is sketched accounting for wind-to-jet thrust transfer, total energy conservation, and wind-jet flow mixing. If the angle of the wind-induced jet bending is larger than its half-opening angle, the following is expected: (i) a strong recollimation shock; (ii) bending against orbital motion, caused by Coriolis forces and enhanced by the wind presence; and (iii) non-ballistic helical propagation further away. Even if disrupted, the jet can reaccelerate due to ambient pressure gradients, but wind entrainment can weaken this acceleration. On large scales, the opening angle of the helical structure is determined by the wind-jet thrust relation, and the wind-loaded jet flow can be rather slow.

Psycho-acoustic tests evaluating the threshold and <b>partial</b> loudness of <b>wind</b> turbine noise when mixed with natural ambient sounds have been performed. These are accounted for in paper D. The main scientific contributions are the following. Paper A: A semi-empiric prediction model for vegetation sound is proposed. This model uses up-to-date simulations of wind profiles and turbulent wind fields to estimate sound from vegetation. The fluctuations due to turbulence are satisfactory estimated by the model. Predictions of vegetation sound also show good agreement to measured spectra. Paper B: A set of measurements of air-borne sound from breaking waves are reported. From these measurements a prediction method of sound from breaking waves is proposed. Third octave spectra from breaking waves are shown to depend on breaker type. Satisfactory agreement between predictions and measurements has been achieved. Paper C: Long range sound propagation over a sea surface was investigated. Measurements of sound transmission were coordinated with local meteorological measurements. A sound propagation algorithm has been compared to the measured sound transmission. Satisfactory agreement between measurements and predictions were achieved when turbulence were taken into consideration in the computations. Paper D: The paper investigates the interaction between wind turbine noise and natural ambient noise. Two loudness models overestimate the masking from two psychoacoustic tests. The wind turbine noise is completely concealed when the ambient sound level (A-weighed) is around 10 dB higher than the wind turbine noise level.

40|$|Deposition of {{carbonate}} aeolianite {{has long}} been constrained by research models based on the isolated carbonate platforms of Bermuda and the Bahamas; however, models for Quaternary carbonate aeolianites differ depending on the interplay of several key factors that reflect location-specific circumstances. Consequently, real steps forward in carbonate aeolianite research require that the depositional system profile (e. g. steeprimmed platform, ramps), source (e. g. sediment supply) and processes (e. g. transportation, deposition and preservation of sediment) be understood and the timing of aeolianite deposition be constrained. Accordingly, these parameters are targeted in this research of carbonate aeolianite in the distally steepened ramp-like setting of Western Australia. The research conducted here is focussed on the Tamala Limestone of Western Australia, which is known for the thickest intervals of Pleistocene carbonate aeolianite in Australia and the most extensive aeolianite deposit of this age in the world (Ward, 1975; Brooke, 2001). Quaternary deposits in Western Australia form a complex depositional system composed of carbonate aeolianite, protosols, palaeosols, calcretes and marine deposits formed during different glacioeustatic sea levels. Two regions within the Tamala Limestone are investigated in this research, the Garden Island Ridge within the Perth region and the Naturaliste-Leeuwin region of the Margaret River area. The laterally discontinuous nature of the dune packages {{and the lack of}} distinctive marker horizons make unravelling the sedimentary sequence of the aeolian deposits complicated. To improve understanding of carbonate aeolianite transportation, deposition and preservation and the impact of these processes on the depositional model, the strategy employed here involves interrogation of the dune packages set within a chronostratigraphic framework. The temporal framework for this study is acquired through the application of whole-rock amino acid racemisation (AAR) dating. The calibrated age estimates of dune formation on the Garden Island Ridge show that major episodes of dune formation are attributed to interglacial highstands Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5 and MIS 1 – more specifically during MIS 5 e/ 5 d, MIS 5 a and MIS 1. The depositional system profile of the Rottnest Shelf and the AAR dates of aeolian samples indicate that the formation of dunes on the Garden Island Ridge were linked to stands of sea level higher than at least ii the present 40 m isobath. AAR dating refines the palaeo-sea level during the MIS 1 dune depositional episode to a sea level higher than at least the 10 m isobath. The Pleistocene-Holocene succession on the Garden Island Ridge comprises four broad facies – dune accumulation deposits, palaeosols, calcretes and marine deposits – and records three successive depositional episodes (MIS 5 d/ 5 e, MIS 5 a and MIS 1) that are separated by hiatal intervals. The MIS 5 d/ 5 e depositional episode consists of transgressive-phase carbonate aeolianites, a marine highstand unit (Rottnest Limestone Member) and regressive-phase carbonate aeolianites bounded on top by a calcrete horizon with deep solution pipes and a terra rossa palaeosol. The MIS 5 a depositional episode comprises mostly composite sets of regressive-phase carbonate aeolianites that are usually separated by erosional contacts and/or protosols. The long hiatial period in dune development between MIS 5 a and MIS 1 is marked by a discontinuous calcrete marker horizon and a discontinuous black palaeosol. The youngest depositional episode of MIS 1 includes transgressive-phase aeolianites, marine limestones (Hershcell Limestone Member) and other unconsolidated deposits (i. e. swamp and beach sand deposits). The carbonate aeolianites of these depositional episodes exhibit a similar mix of skeletal and shell grains of Bryozoa, foraminifera, coralline algae, Mollusca, corals and echinoderms with a minor proportion of quartz grains. The approach taken in evaluating the stratigraphy and its palaeoenvironmental implications for the Tamala Limestone on the Garden Island Ridge in the Perth Basin was extended to the Tamala Limestone within the Naturaliste-Leeuwin region. The sedimentary succession at Whitecliff was deposited from frequent and short periods of carbonate dune sand accumulation and soil development. At Shelly Beach, a large, single set of aeolian cross-strata was deposited upon a red palaeosol and conglomeratic limestone that is most probably emplaced during MIS 11 and is comparable to the Cowaramup Conglomerate. The calibrated AAR age estimates of dune formation at Whitecliff and Shelly Beach in the Naturaliste-Leeuwin region show that episodes of dune formation are attributed to the overall regressive phase of MIS 5 at Whitecliff and phases during MIS 8 e, MIS 9 or the regressive phase of MIS 11 at Shelly Beach. The depositional system profile of the Naturaliste-Leeuwin shelf and the AAR dates of aeolian samples indicate that the formation of dunes was linked to stands of sea levels higher than the present 30 m isobath. The carbonate aeolianites in both regions are characterised by moderately sorted, medium sand with grainsize distributions that are finely skewed and mesokurtic, much like modern carbonate dune sediment in other world locations. The carbonate aeolianites display sedimentological characteristics that are consistent with an origin by aeolian transportation sourced from a marine environment and provide a detailed insight into sediment supply, transportation and deposition of sediment and its subsequent preservation. The carbonate aeolianites were sourced from the upwind beach environment, which was continually refreshed by sediment from the adjoining shallow marine shelf. The dominant source of sediment to the carbonate aeolianites was an enduring, highly productive, Foramol subtropical-temperate carbonate province on the Rottnest and Naturaliste shelves that was sensitive to the relative strength and position of the warm Leeuwin Current. The insoluble fraction of the carbonate aeolianite is dominated by terrigenous particles attributed to the fluvial discharge of nearby rivers and was not derived from dust from the mainland carried by offshore <b>winds.</b> <b>Partial</b> cementation of aeolianites occurred under freshwater or mixed vadose conditions, as indicated by the dominance of pendant meniscus, grain contact meniscus and partially rimmed cements. The foreset dips of large- and very-large scale tabular crossbeds and sedimentological analysis show that carbonate dune formation and migration occurred from persistent "fresh" winds (> 9 m/s) and record the influence of the westerly wind belt of the Ferrel cell. However, on the Garden Island Ridge, dune formation and migration also records the influence of the southeast trade wind belt of the Hadley cell during MIS 5 e. The movement of the Hadley cell over the Garden Island Ridge is consistent with that expected to accompany the change from a glacial to an interglacial climate at the interglacial highstand of MIS 5 e. The Quaternary deposits in the distally steepened ramp-like morphologies of the Perth Basin show that the depositional model is controlled by a very sensitive relationship between climate, depositional system profile and pattern of sea-level change. The amount and composition of the sediment available for aeolian deposition is ultimately controlled by sea level – when the regions were adjacent to a shallow sea, 10 - 30 / 40 m deep that formed a highly productive Foramol subtropical to temperate carbonate province. However, the size and location of the aeolian accumulations are influenced by palaeoclimate, the depositional system profile and in the Leeuwin Region by the topography of the Leeuwin Block. The very sensitive relationship between climate, depositional system profile and the pattern of sea-level change controlled sediment production, mobilization, deposition and preservation...|$|R
