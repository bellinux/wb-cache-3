The use of <b>piecewise</b> <b>regression</b> analysis implicitly recognizes different functions fit to bedload data over varying ranges of flow. The transition from primarily low rates of sand transport (Phase I) to higher rates of sand and coarse gravel transport (Phase II) is termed “breakpoint ” and {{is defined as the}} flow where the fitted functions intersect. The form of the model used here fits linear segments to different ranges of data, though other types of functions may be used.

In general, the regression {{analysis is}} the study of the relationship of one or more independent variables with the dependent variable. In analyze the functional relationship between X as the independent variables and Y as the dependent variable, there may be a linear relationship is different for each interval X. If the regression of X on Y has a linear relationship on the certain of the interval of X, but also has a distinct linear relationship at another interval of X, so the use of <b>piecewise</b> linear <b>regression</b> is appropriate in this case. <b>Piecewise</b> linear <b>regression</b> is a method in regression analysis that divided the independent variable into several segments based on a particular value called the X-knots, and in each segment of the data contained linear regression model.

40|$|Time lags {{have been}} {{recognized}} as valuable measures of heat stress in animals. Some existing models such as the symmetric harmonic hysteresis and the asymmetric harmonic hysteresis models have been shown beneficial for obtaining time lags and describing the dynamics of thermally challenged animals. Both hysteresis models {{are based on the}} assumption that air temperature (forcing function) follows a sinusoidal pattern. This dissertation will present a simple and more general method for estimating time lags using a <b>piecewise</b> <b>regression</b> lags model that does not require sinusoidal air temperature trends. Time lags are estimated from taking the difference between the body temperature change point and the air temperature change point of the <b>piecewise</b> <b>regression</b> models for each response. The segmented method proposed by Muggeo (2003) is used to estimate parameters of a piecewise linear regression model including the change points and to develop a permutation test for testing the existence of the change points. The idea of a segmented method is then extended to a piecewise quadratic regression model for estimating the pseudo change points. The performance of the <b>piecewise</b> <b>regression</b> lags and hysteresis lags were assessed via simulations and applied to heat stress data on heifers with the conclusion that the <b>piecewise</b> <b>regression</b> lags models are efficient for obtaining the lags in comparison with hysteresis models and the animals’ response differently to heat stress. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} subgroups is {{ubiquitous}} in scientific research (ex. disease heterogeneity, spatial distributions in ecology [...] .), and <b>piecewise</b> <b>regression</b> {{is one way}} to deal with this phenomenon. Morse-Smale regression offers a way to partition the regression function based on level sets of a defined function and that function's basins of attraction. This topologically-based <b>piecewise</b> <b>regression</b> algorithm has shown promise in its initial applications, but the current implementation in the literature has been limited to elastic net and generalized linear regression. It is possible that nonparametric methods, such as random forest or conditional inference trees, may provide better prediction and insight through modeling interaction terms and other nonlinear relationships between predictors and a given outcome. This study explores the use of several machine learning algorithms within a Morse-Smale <b>piecewise</b> <b>regression</b> framework, including boosted regression with linear baselearners, homotopy-based LASSO, conditional inference trees, random forest, and a wide neural network framework called extreme learning machines. Simulations on Tweedie regression problems with varying Tweedie parameter and dispersion suggest that many machine learning approaches to Morse-Smale <b>piecewise</b> <b>regression</b> improve the original algorithm's performance, particularly for outcomes with lower dispersion and linear or a mix of linear and nonlinear predictor relationships. On a real actuarial problem, several of these new algorithms perform as good as or better than the original Morse-Smale regression algorithm, and most provide information on the nature of predictor relationships within each partition to provide insight into differences between dataset partitions.

The evaluation shows that polynomials compare favorably to linear and <b>piecewise</b> <b>regression</b> models, induced by standard regression methods, {{in terms of}} degree of fit and complexity. The bias-variance decomposition of predictive error shows that Ciper has lower variance than methods for inducing regression trees. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{relationships}} among ecological variables are usually obtained by fitting statistical models that {{go through the}} conditional means of the variables. For example, the nonparametric loess regression model and the parametric <b>piecewise</b> linear <b>regression</b> model - that go through the conditional mean of the response variable given the predictor - are used to analyze simple to complex {{relationships among}} variables. In this article, we have proposed to use loess to identify the number and positions of ecological breakpoints, and the <b>piecewise</b> linear <b>regression</b> model to estimate the breakpoints. In contrast, the <b>piecewise</b> linear quantile <b>regression</b> model - which goes through the quantiles of the conditional distribution of the response variable given the predictor - provides much richer information in terms of estimating relationships and breakpoints.

To eliminate the ambiguity in the linear extrapolation, the present study develops a quantitative method based on <b>piecewise</b> linear <b>regression</b> analysis. In this method, the entire polarisation data is divided into small sub-intervals and variation in the regression coefficient and linearity coefficient values are observed. Consistency in these values serves as a quantitative indicator of the linear Tafel regions. The method described is then demonstrated in potentiodynamic polarisation measurement of Al/NaCl (0. 5 M) and Zn/KOH (1. 0 M) systems. The <b>piecewise</b> linear <b>regression</b> analysis positively identified the linear regions from the polarisation branches and thus provided more accurate corrosion parameters of the systems...|$|R
