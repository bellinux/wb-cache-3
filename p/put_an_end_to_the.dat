5|$|From 1530, {{the colonists}} became the arbiters of power, {{installing}} and deposing governors. Spanish government in Honduras was riven by factionalism.

Alvarado arrived in 1536, <b>put</b> <b>an</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> political infighting, and gained an important victory over Sicumba, a Maya leader in the Ulúa valley.

5|$|Collins {{has said}} that the main {{inspiration}} for The Hunger Games trilogy came from the classical account of Theseus and the Minotaur. In Greek mythology, as a punishment for the killing of King Minos's son Androgeos, Athens was forced to sacrifice seven youths and seven maidens to Crete, who were then put in the Labyrinth and killed by the Minotaur. After a while, Theseus, the son of the Athenian king, decided to <b>put</b> <b>an</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Minotaur and Minos's terror, so he volunteered to join the third group of victims, ultimately killing the Minotaur and leading his companions out of the monster's Labyrinth.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} colonial period, {{under the rule}} of the House of Bourbon, the ideas of the Enlightenment on public health and social control shaped the {{development}} of Lima. New buildings undertaken during this period include a cockfighting coliseum and a bullring, the Plaza de toros de Acho, as well as the General Cemetery. The first two were built to regulate these popular activities by centralizing them at a single venue, while the cemetery <b>put</b> <b>an</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> practice of burials at churches which was considered unhealthy by public authorities.|$|E

Limantour, who broadly agreed with Estañol, had the support of the Mexican financiers, who feared the downgrading of Mexican international credit and a general economic crisis as a result of ongoing social unrest, as well as that of the large landowners who were willing to come to terms with Madero if it would <b>put</b> <b>an</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> agrarian uprisings.|$|E
5|$|His {{father had}} him crowned king in 1057 or 1058. Solomon's {{coronation}} was a fundamental condition of his engagement to Judith, a sister of Henry IV, King of Germany. Their engagement <b>put</b> <b>an</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> more than ten-year-long period of armed conflicts between Hungary and the Holy Roman Empire. However, Solomon's coronation provoked his uncle, Béla, who had {{until that time}} held a strong claim to succeed his brother Andrew according to the traditional principle of seniority. Béla had, since around 1048, administered the so-called ducatus or duchy, which encompassed one-third of the kingdom.|$|E
5|$|In 1954, Jean Cocteau, who greatly {{admired the}} film, insisted on Tiefland being {{shown at the}} Cannes Film Festival, which he was running that year. In 1960, Riefenstahl {{attempted}} to prevent filmmaker Erwin Leiser from juxtaposing scenes from Triumph des Willens with footage from concentration camps in his film Mein Kampf. Riefenstahl had high hopes for a collaboration with Cocteau called Friedrich und Voltaire ("Friedrich and Voltaire"), wherein Cocteau was to play two roles. They thought the film might symbolize the love-hate relationship between Germany and France. Cocteau's illness and 1963 death <b>put</b> <b>an</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> project. A musical remake of Das Blaue Licht ("The Blue Light") with an English production company also fell apart.|$|E

5|$|In November of {{that year}} the same group planted a bomb that blew out the front of Nussbaum's house, while {{he and his wife}} were {{sleeping}} there. Nussbaum blamed the bombings on local antisemitism and bigotry, but most of his congregation blamed it on Nussbaum's anti-segregationist activism. Though the congregation officially supported him, a number of members privately urged him to leave Beth Israel and find another pulpit. The synagogue's board of trustees voted to prohibit non-Jewish groups from using the synagogue's premises unless they had prior approval from the board; the intent was to <b>put</b> <b>an</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> interracial meetings that Nussbaum held there.|$|E
5|$|Justinian {{entered the}} arena of ecclesiastical statecraft shortly after his uncle's {{accession}} in 518, and <b>put</b> <b>an</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Acacian schism. Previous Emperors had tried to alleviate theological conflicts by declarations that deemphasized the Council of Chalcedon, which had condemned Monophysitism, which had strongholds in Egypt and Syria, and by tolerating the appointment of Monophysites to church offices. The Popes reacted by severing ties with the Patriarch of Constantinople who supported these policies. Emperors Justin I (and later Justinian himself) rescinded these policies and reestablished the union between Constantinople and Rome. After this, Justinian also felt entitled to settle disputes in papal elections, as {{he did when he}} favoured Vigilius and had his rival Silverius deported.|$|E
5|$|Modern historians {{describe}} the Royal Question {{as an important}} moment in Belgian recovery after World War II. The opposition between Leopoldists and anti-Leopoldists led to the re-establishment of Socialist and Catholic political parties from before the war. The Question was also an important moment in the Belgian linguistic conflict. It also <b>put</b> <b>an</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> federalisation of Belgian institutions which might exacerbate the regional tensions exposed by the Royal Question. In addition, the perceived failure of the PSC–CVP to realise Flemish demands {{for the return of}} Leopold helped to strengthen support for the Flemish nationalist Volksunie party after 1954. In Wallonia, the legacy of trade union and socialist political mobilisation during the general strike paved the way for a left-wing revival of the Walloon Movement.|$|E
