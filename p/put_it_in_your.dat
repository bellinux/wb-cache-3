[...] In 1986, he released his final studio album, The Legendary Paul Butterfield Rides Again, which again {{was a poor}} attempt at a comeback with an updated rock sound. On April 15, 1987, he participated in the concert [...] "B.B. King & Friends", with Eric Clapton, Etta James, Albert King, Stevie Ray Vaughan, and others.|$|E
500|$|Reviews of the ZX81 {{highlighted}} the great {{value for money}} offered by the machine but noted its technical shortcomings. As Tim Hartnell <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>Your</b> Computer, [...] "the ZX81 is both a delight and a disappointment". He applauded the improvements {{that had been made}} over the ZX80, such as a much better manual, display and string handling, and called the ZX81 [...] "a very good first computer" [...] that [...] "will open the world of computing to many who would be denied access to it by cost." [...] However, the built-in memory was so small that use of a memory expansion pack was [...] "mandatory for any worthwhile use". He also found the ZX81 to be alarmingly unreliable, having to have his first two test machines replaced before getting one that worked properly.|$|E
500|$|Kemp was {{a critic}} of {{association}} football, known as soccer in the United States. In 1986, during a House floor debate over whether the United States should host the 1994 FIFA World Cup, Kemp proclaimed: [...] "I {{think it is important}} for all those young out there—who someday hope to play real football, where you throw it and kick it and run with it and <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> hands— a distinction should be made that football is democratic capitalism, whereas soccer is a European socialist sport." [...] Kemp compared his speech to George Carlin's 1984 comedy routine on the differences between baseball and American football and wrote that his [...] "tongue was firmly planted in cheek" [...] when making the speech. Despite the levity of the speech, it garnered significant backlash. However, he continued to insist that soccer's main problem is [...] "it doesn't have a quarterback". Kemp noted that about half of his grandchildren play or have played organized soccer and claimed to have [...] "changed" [...] his position on soccer. He even attended the 1994 FIFA World Cup with longtime soccer fan Henry Kissinger, although he wrote during the 2006 FIFA World Cup that soccer can be interesting to watch but is still a [...] "boring game".|$|E

5000|$|... "Popping" [...] a card {{means that}} you pick it up, follow its {{instructions}}, and then place <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> score pile. If the instructions tell you to pop another card, then the process recurses; you follow the instructions on the new card before <b>putting</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> score pile, and only then do you put the first-popped card <b>in</b> <b>your</b> score pile. (<b>In</b> other words, the current set of popped cards forms a stack.) ...|$|R
500|$|Producer Oren Koules told horror news website ShockTilYouDrop.com {{that there}} are eleven traps in the film, the most ever in the franchise. [...] There is one [...] "trap" [...] scene in the film that {{producers}} would not allow in previous Saw films that they described as [...] "too violent", [...] "too disgusting", and [...] "just wrong". [...] Melton later confirmed that was the [...] "Garage Trap", which involved a car and sets off a [...] "chain reaction" [...] with other characters. Gabby West {{was part of the}} trap. She told VH1, [...] "They molded my entire face, and basically my entire upper body after my belly button. They put layers and layers of different materials on you and you have two straws in your nose so you can breathe. It was so scary! They put so much of it on, you can't see and they <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> ears so you can barely hear anything. That was part of the prep for the film, which was really cool, to have a dummy made of yourself. But scary." [...] Over 25 gallons of fake blood was used in the film, which was two and half times more than Saw II.|$|E

5000|$|Then House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) stated: [...] "Congress vigorously rejects {{any claim}} that the {{president}} has the authority to pocket veto this legislation and will treat any bill returned to the Congress as open to an override vote." [...] On January 1, 2008, Deputy Assistant to the President and Deputy Press Secretary Scott Stanzel stated: [...] "A pocket veto, as you know, is essentially <b>putting</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> pocket and not taking any action whatsoever. And when Congress — the House is out of session — <b>in</b> this case <b>it's</b> our view that bill then would not become law." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I can't {{understand}} it," [...] he said. [...] "Drummond {{always seemed}} a good sort. I {{should have thought}} he would have sent you in for the house like a shot. Are you sure you <b>put</b> <b>it</b> plainly <b>in</b> <b>your</b> letter? What did you say?" ...|$|R
50|$|The other notion {{related to}} prototypes {{is that of}} a basic level in {{cognitive}} categorization. When asked What are you sitting on?, most subjects prefer to say chair rather than a subordinate such as kitchen chair or a superordinate such as furniture. Basic categories are relatively homogeneous in terms of sensory-motor affordances — a chair is associated with bending of one's knees, a fruit with picking <b>it</b> up and <b>putting</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> mouth, etc. At the subordinate level (e.g. chairs, chairs etc.) hardly any significant features can be added to that of the basic level; whereas at the superordinate level, these conceptual similarities are hard to pinpoint. A picture of a chair is easy to draw (or visualize), but drawing furniture would be difficult.|$|R
6000|$|And, likewise, {{it must be}} {{honestly}} {{confessed that}} these professions have, to a certain degree, been exercised before. Do not cry out at this and say it is no discovery! I say it IS a discovery. It is a discovery if I show you--a gentleman--a profession which you may exercise without derogation, or loss of standing, with certain profit, nay, possibly with honor, and of which, until the reading of this present page, you never thought but as of a calling beneath your rank and quite below your reach. Sir, I {{do not mean to}} say that I create a profession. I cannot create gold; but if, when discovered, I find the means of <b>putting</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> pocket, do I or do I not deserve credit? ...|$|R

6000|$|... "If this is so," [...] said Cyrus, [...] "it <b>puts</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> {{power to}} render me a very {{essential}} service." [...] Cyrus then explained to Araspes the necessity {{that he was}} under of finding some confidential agent {{to go on a}} secret mission into the enemy's country, and the importance that the messenger should go under such circumstances as not to be suspected of being Cyrus's friend in disguise. [...] "You can pretend to abscond," [...] said he; [...] "it will be immediately said that you fled for fear of my displeasure. I will pretend to send in pursuit of you. The news of your evasion will spread rapidly, and will be carried, doubtless, into the enemy's country; so that, when you arrive there, they will be prepared to welcome you as a deserter from my cause, and a refugee." ...|$|R
