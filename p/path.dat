5|$|A {{closely related}} problem, the minimax <b>path</b> problem, asks for the <b>path</b> that {{minimizes}} the maximum weight {{of any of}} its edges. It has applications that include transportation planning. Any algorithm for the widest <b>path</b> problem can be transformed into an algorithm for the minimax <b>path</b> problem, or vice versa, by reversing the sense of all the weight comparisons performed by the algorithm, or equivalently by replacing every edge weight by its negation.|$|E
5|$|A <b>path,</b> which {{contains}} data, usually organized in hierarchical form, that {{appears as a}} sequence of segments separated by slashes. Such a sequence may resemble or map exactly to a file system <b>path,</b> but does not always imply a relation to one. The <b>path</b> must begin with a single slash (/) if an authority part was present, and may also if one was not, but must not begin with a double slash. The <b>path</b> is always defined, though the defined <b>path</b> may be empty (zero length), therefore no trailing slash.|$|E
5|$|A {{variant of}} the minimax <b>path</b> problem has also been {{considered}} for sets of points in the Euclidean plane. As in the undirected graph problem, this Euclidean minimax <b>path</b> problem can be solved efficiently by finding a Euclidean minimum spanning tree: every <b>path</b> in the tree is a minimax <b>path.</b> However, the problem becomes more complicated when a <b>path</b> is desired that not only minimizes the hop length but also, among paths with the same hop length, minimizes or approximately minimizes the total length of the <b>path.</b> The solution can be approximated using geometric spanners.|$|E

40|$|Abstraction is a {{powerful}} technique in search and plan-ning. A fundamental problem of abstraction {{is that it can}} create spurious <b>paths,</b> i. e., abstract <b>paths</b> that do not correspond to valid concrete <b>paths.</b> In this paper, we define spurious <b>paths</b> as a generalization of spuri-ous states. We show that spurious <b>paths</b> can be catego-rized into two types: state-independent spurious <b>paths</b> and state-specific spurious <b>paths.</b> We present a prac-tical method that eliminates state-independent spuri-ous <b>paths,</b> as well as state-specific spurious <b>paths</b> when integrated with mutex detection methods. We provide syntactical conditions under which our method can re-move state-independent spurious <b>paths</b> completely.

5|$|Early on, {{the player}} {{is given the}} choice between three {{different}} game modes, each with unique cutscenes, puzzles to solve and locations to visit: the Team <b>Path,</b> the Wits <b>Path,</b> and the Fists <b>Path.</b> In the Team <b>Path,</b> protagonist Indiana Jones is joined by his partner Sophia Hapgood who will provide support throughout the game. The Wits <b>Path</b> features an abundance of complex puzzles, while the Fists <b>Path</b> focuses heavily on action sequences and fist fighting, the latter of which is completely optional {{in the other two}} modes. Atypical for LucasArts titles, it is possible for the player character to die at certain points in the game, though dangerous situations were designed to be easily recognizable. A score system, the Indy Quotient Points, keeps track of the puzzles solved, the obstacles overcome and the important objects found.|$|E
5|$|In an undirected graph, a widest <b>path</b> may {{be found}} as the <b>path</b> between the two {{vertices}} in the maximum spanning tree of the graph, and a minimax <b>path</b> {{may be found}} as the <b>path</b> between the two vertices in the minimum spanning tree.|$|E
5|$|In graph algorithms, {{the widest}} <b>path</b> {{problem is the}} problem of finding a <b>path</b> between two {{designated}} vertices in a weighted graph, maximizing the weight of the minimum-weight edge in the <b>path.</b> The widest <b>path</b> problem is also known as the bottleneck shortest <b>path</b> problem or the maximum capacity <b>path</b> problem. It is possible to adapt most shortest <b>path</b> algorithms to compute widest paths, by modifying them to use the bottleneck distance instead of <b>path</b> length. However, in many cases even faster algorithms are possible.|$|E

The South West Coast <b>Path</b> is no longer used by the Coastguard but it has been transformed from a practical defence system into a resource for recreational walkers. The <b>path</b> is covered by England's right-of-way laws, as amended by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000, which keep historic footpaths open to the public even when they pass through private property.

30|$|For Example A (Fig.  7), we {{see that}} the edges with the highest Edge Gravity ranking are indeed the local bridges (A,B) and (E,I) {{discussed}} by Granovetter.

Indeed, edge (A,B) is included in 8664 <b>paths</b> (59 % of all <b>paths)</b> and edge (E,I) is included in 7884 <b>paths</b> (53 % of all <b>paths).</b> However, the edges ranked third and fourth in this example only appear in 5174 <b>paths</b> each (35 % of all <b>paths).</b> This observation supports the validity of Granovetter’s conjecture that local bridges are important because of their involvement in many network <b>paths.</b>|$|R
