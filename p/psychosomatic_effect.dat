Exposure to fire typically causes her to lose control over some of her powers like Telepathy, Invisibility, Intangibility, Martian vision, and Flight which leaves her very faint and weakened. It was revealed, during the Trial By Fire storyline, that the Martian weakness to fire is an inbuilt <b>psychosomatic</b> <b>effect,</b> placed in the Martian race long ago by the Guardians of the Universe. The purpose of this was to prevent the Martians from reverting to a previous state {{in which they were}} highly aggressive, on the verge of interstellar conquest, and required flames and the psychic suffering of others in order to reproduce.

The 15 subjects included one group each of 8 girls (15 - 17 yrs) and 7 boys (16 - 17 yrs). Both groups were undertaking pre-season training of high volume and increased intensity, totally 30 hours per week. Each sex was divided into a Control (with an inactive magnetic resonance machine as placebo), and a Treatment (massaged) group. Investigations extended over 3 consecutive days between 2 - 4 hours following the morning training session. Day 1 was a rest (control) day for all subjects, Days 2 and 3 involved placebo treatments for Control groups, and massage for Treatment groups. Profile of Mood State (POMS) questionnaires were administered twice to each subject on all days, once immediately prior to treatment and again immediately after treatment. Results indicated that post-training massage can produce positive mood enhancement in subjects who are fatigued but not 'overtrained'. However, subjects who exhibited "burn-out" profiles prior to treatment showed no improvement...|$|R
2500|$|Two {{mutually}} contradictory explanations {{have been}} put forward that rely on <b>psychosomatic</b> <b>effects.</b> On the one hand, a birthday provides a fixed date to focus on, allowing the terminally ill to hold on until the day itself. On the other hand, a birthday also reminds the individual of mortality and offers an occasion {{to look back on}} life. According to the terror management theory, this causes stress which can accelerate death. The uneven mortality rate distribution between men and women, and between more and less successful baseball players, suggests that both {{may play a role in}} the birthday effect: people who have focused on the public sphere of life (for example, career-driven people or professional athletes) might be reminded that their glory days have passed, while those who lived more in the private sphere (such as stay-at-home parents and amateur sports players) are more aware of what they will lose in death and try to hold on.

Partial Least Squares analyses on data from 127 participants were used to determine whether the effects of bullying on negative affect are independent of, or are moderated by, neuroticism. Findings: Revealed that neuroticism does not moderate the relationship between bullying and negative affect. Bullying and neuroticism were found to act independently on negative affect. The results supported the psychosomatic model of bullying. Research limitations/implications: Limitations are the nature of the sample, the use of self-report and cross-sectional data. Future research could use a larger sample, include multi-rater data, and a longitudinal research design.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to reveal both the {{psychosomatic}} and the physical effects of local air velocity from an air conditioner using biomarkers which can be collected noninvasively. Salivary α-amylase activity (SAA) and salivary cortisol were used as the indexes of <b>psychosomatic</b> <b>effects.</b> The total protein (TP) collected from stratum corneum was used as an index of the physical condition of dry skin. A continuous experiment over a 5 days period in summer was conducted using 8 healthy young male adults for 2 -types of airflow conditioners, a whole ceiling-type air conditioner (without local air velocity) and a normal-type air conditioner (with local air velocity). The subjects felt cool, windy, dry and uncomfortable when under the normal-type air conditioner as determined in a subjective evaluation. The SAA under the normal-type air conditioner fluctuated more widely than with the whole ceiling-type air conditioner. The level of salivary cortisol decreased more in a day under the normal-type air conditioner than with the whole ceiling-type air conditioner. These results showed that reducing local air velocity may provide more healthy psychosomatic conditions over the long-term. Moreover, the TP of a drying-exposed skin area showed a significant change during this experiment whereas the TP of drying-protected area was relatively unchanged. It was indicated that one week’s exposure to local air velocity conditions possibly influences the drying of facial skin. Thus, air movement at low velocity can be provides more comfortable conditions not only psychosomatically but also physically. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|The {{analysis}} of the data of the domestic and foreign literature regarding the dynamics of narcotization among children and adolescents is carried out. It has been established that at present the growth rates of the use of psychoactive substances by minors far outstrip those of the adult population. It is also determined that in most cases "adult" drug addiction is formed in a teenage environment and therefore adolescents are a group of high-risk narcotization. Besides, new types of additions are constantly added: non-opioid analgetics, antidepressants, pharmacy products based on medicinal plants with stimulating or sedative properties, new means of perfumery and household chemicals, volatile organic compounds, etc. In this regard, in the clinical picture of drug intoxication, new variations of affective, psycho-organic and <b>psychosomatic</b> <b>effects</b> and complications are noted. In recent years, synthetic cannabinoids has rapidly gained "popularity" among young people that are successfully promoted by marketers. They are the part of the so-called designer drugs, appearing in the markets in the form of bath salts, flavors, fertilizers for indoor plants and "smoking mixtures" - spices. The publications of domestic and foreign authors give a lot of evidence of the ability of these substances not only to cause a state of intoxication, alienation, relaxation, but also leads to dependence on them with severe consequences for the psyche and all organism as a whole. Thus, the powerful anthropogenic damaging effect of designer drugs demonstrates concrete signals of a threat to health, demography and the economy of the society {{as a result of their}} use by the population...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Animal Assisted Therapy (AAT) or Pet Therapy is an {{adjunctive}} therapy {{by taking}} advantage of human and animal interaction, activate the physiological and psychological mechanisms, initiate positive changes improving health in metabolism. In recent years, this interaction are in use to treat psychological and psychiatric disorders such as stress, depression, loneliness, pervasive developmental disorders affect negatively to human health. Furthermore, AAT has been increasingly used to improve quality of life, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, chronic illnesses such as cancer and AIDS. The aim {{of this paper is to}} identify AAT by reviewing human and animal interaction, evaluate how AAT has a scientific background from past to now. Also, we aim to give some information about the risks, institutional applications, some factors referring AAT&# 8217;s mechanism of action and chronic diseases, psychological and physical improvements provided with animal assisted therapies. The therapy results will be evaluated more advisable providing AAT is being applied with public health specialist, veterinarian, physician, psychologist, psychiatrist and veterinary public health experts who are monitor applications. Especially, the <b>psychosomatic</b> <b>effects</b> result from physical, emotional and play mechanism of action of HDT can be used for improving quality of life in individuals with chronic diseases. In Turkey, there is no any investigation which have been performed in this scientific field. It is quitely important to evaluate the benefits of this therapy accurately and to select various methods proper to diseases. Consequently, it is obvious that AAT will be considered by the healthcare services as a supportive therapy process for improving human health in Turkey and needs further studies.

5000|$|Harvard {{professor}} Herbert Benson {{performed a}} [...] "Study of the Therapeutic Effects of Intercessory Prayer (STEP)" [...] in 2006. [...] The STEP, commonly called the [...] "Templeton Foundation prayer study" [...] or [...] "Great Prayer Experiment", used 1,802 {{coronary artery bypass}} surgery patients at six hospitals. Using double-blind protocols, patients were randomized into three groups, individual prayer receptiveness was not measured. The members of the experimental and control Groups 1 and 2 were informed they {{might or might not}} receive prayers, and only Group 1 received prayers. Group 3, which served as a test for possible <b>psychosomatic</b> <b>effects,</b> was informed they would receive prayers and subsequently did. Unlike some other studies, STEP attempted to standardize the prayer method. Only first names and last initial for patients were provided and no photographs were supplied. The congregations of three Christian churches who prayed for the patients [...] "were allowed to pray in their own manner, but they were instructed to include the following phrase in their prayers: [...] "for a successful surgery with a quick, healthy recovery and no complications". [...] Some participants complained that this mechanical way they were told to pray as part of the experiment was unusual for them. Complications of surgery occurred in 52 percent of those who received prayer (Group 1), 51 percent of those who did not receive it (Group 2), and 59 percent of patients who knew they would receive prayers (Group 3). There were no statistically significant differences in major complications or thirty-day mortality. In The God Delusion, evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins wrote, [...] "It seems more probable that those patients who knew they were being prayed for suffered additional stress in consequence: performance anxiety', as the experimenters put it. Dr Charles Bethea, one of the researchers, said, [...] "It may have made them uncertain, wondering am I so sick they had to call in their prayer team?'" [...] Study co-author Jeffery Dusek stated that: [...] "Each study builds on others, and STEP advanced the design beyond what had been previously done. The findings, however, could well be due to the study limitations." [...] Team leader Benson stated that STEP was not the last word on the effects of intercessory prayer and that questions raised by the study will require additional answers.|$|R

Unwanted pregnancy has also extensive <b>psychosomatic</b> adverse <b>effects</b> on pregnant women. More than 60 % of unwanted pregnant women in the word abort, mostly in an unhealthy situation, resulting in high death toll. Therefore, the study of the prevalence and effective factors in unwanted pregnancies is necessary, which was the aim of this study. After delivery, 758 women were interviewed, about their pregnancies (Wanted or unwanted), type of contraceptives used, and their usage accuracy, etc. 28 % of interviewed women had unwanted pregnancies, and 87 % of the unwanted pregnant women were employing a contraception method, but most of them (87 %) incorrectly. Some women have stated negligence, fear of contraceptives adverse effects, medical problems and opposition of their husbands as the common factors of rejecting any contraceptive method. Women employing oral contraceptive pills, interruption and IUD methods, have had 35. 7 %, 38. 2 %, and 7. 2 % unwanted pregnancies, respectively. Illiteracy, in women with unwanted pregnancies was about twice as much as the others.

40|$|Open Access JournalBACKGROUND: The {{present study}} aims to assess <b>psychosomatic</b> and {{physical}} <b>effects</b> of a CBT based stress management program augmented by CAMamong teaching professionals in Hong Kong. METHOD: A random controlled trial (RCT) {{was used to}} compare between CBT group (n = 26) and the CBT-CAM group (n = 30). Interventions were administered for 1. 5 hours once a week for eight consecutive weeks. A self-administered questionnaire including perceived stress scale (PSS) and frequency of psychosomatic symptoms were measured at baseline (T 1), immediate after the program (T 2), and 4 weeks after the program (T 3). Physical parameters were measured at T 1 and T 2. RESULTS: A reduction of 23 % in PSS was observed in the CBT group, while the CBT-CAM group yielded 18 % reductions in PSS from T 1 to T 3 [F(2, 108) = 3. 099; p=. 049]. No significant interactions were observed in the frequency of psychosomatic symptoms and physical parameters. However, a significant downward time trend was observed (p<. 001) and larger percentage changes in physical responses were shown in the CBT-CAM group than CBT group. CONCLUSION: Clinical evidence of both the CBT-CAM and CBT programs has been demonstrated in the current study and both approaches are easy to be self-implemented. The CAM technique might serve as an alternative choice for self-administered stress management to replace the additional time needed for professional follow-up contacts. It might further improve some physical responses such as handgrip strength and resting heart rate, which are associated with better psychosomatic health and better occupational stress management. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R
