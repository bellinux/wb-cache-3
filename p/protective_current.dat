This research also studies the characteristics and features which are relevant and connected when designing the ICCP system. Experimental tests were carried out on an ICCP system which was made of low carbon steel pipes with interval coatings. The experimental test results demonstrated that the distance between anode and protected structure does not affect the total current source supplied, the properties of soil at vicinity of the anode played the main roles. All type of metals can be an anode {{as long as it is}} has electrical conductivity characteristic, the implications are power source, anode consumption, economic and environmental effect. Besides that, anode material can affect the total <b>protective</b> <b>current.</b> The results further indicated that copper anode has the most lower value (< 8 mA) of <b>protective</b> <b>current</b> compared to stainless steel, aluminum, low carbon steel and cast iron. Weather condition like rainy day and temperature can also affect the ICCP parameters. The <b>protective</b> <b>current</b> increased dramatically to 11. 32 mA when it was raining. Location of reference electrode has significant implication for the potential control of ICCP system. The powercrete liquid epoxy (primer coating) and polyken tape (secondary coating) has shown better corrosion resistance and in the uncoated pipeline the corrosion rate went up to 0. 0258 cm/y (without ICCP) and 0. 00442 cm/y (with ICCP) in 30 days...|$|E
40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. Impressed Current Cathodic Protection (ICCP) has contributed {{significantly}} to the repair and maintenance of motorway structures in the U. K. By polarising the steel reinforcement it can arrest and prevent corrosion activity and can take away the necessity to remove chloride contaminated but otherwise sound concrete. The aim of this research was to collect data from full-scale motorway reinforced concrete structures which had ICCP systems applied for a range of years and to assess their performance with regards to corrosion. It was found that for structures which had received a <b>protective</b> <b>current</b> for 5 years or more, the steel reinforcement retained a residual passive corrosion condition for at least 3 years following interruption of the <b>protective</b> <b>current.</b> This was despite the fact that in several structures the residual corrosion risk was high, based on the concentration of chlorides that was found at the depth of the reinforcement.

40|$|<b>Protective</b> <b>current</b> {{transformers}} (CTs) {{are integrated}} into electrical power systems for {{assessment of the}} health of the system. They are intended to provide a scaled-down value of the line current. During major faults, excessive fault currents with decaying DC components could flow through the primary of the CT, causing core saturation and a consequent malfunction of the protection system. This problem is addressed in the paper, and a signal-processing scheme is proposed for fast predetermination of the peak value of the steady-state AC component, instant of occurrence of fault and the time constant of the decaying direct current. Samples of the CT secondary current are collected until the onset of saturation, and are operated upon using a covariance-Prony algorithm to estimate the aforementioned critical parameters. Simulation results in support of the proposed technique are also presented...|$|E

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. Impressed Current Cathodic Protection (ICCP) {{has been one}} of the major {{components}} of the repair and maintenance strategy on many motorway structures in the U. K. It has helped to prolong the life of more than 700 structures, in a significantly sustainable manner, by reducing the need to remove chloride contaminated (but otherwise sound) concrete. This study was initiated after identifying that some of the ICCP systems were reaching the end of their design life and required a significant level of maintenance (including anode replacement) to operate in accordance with the latest Codes of Practice. In addition, there were a number of structures where the application of ICCP has been interrupted due to severe anode deterioration or vandalism. The objective of this work was to collate evidence from structures to support preliminary laboratory results that the application of ICCP to a reinforced concrete structure over a period of time can transform the environment around the reinforcement, even after the <b>protective</b> <b>current</b> has been interrupted. This experimental field study interrupted the current to ten structures which had been protected with ICCP between 5 and 16 years and corrosion rates were monitored to determine when reinforcement corrosion will initiate again. It was found that after five or more years of ICCP, the steel remained passive for at least 30 months after interrupting the <b>protective</b> <b>current,</b> despite the presence of chloride contamination representing a substantial corrosion risk. In some cases, severe anode deterioration meant that the current was interrupted at an unknown point in time prior to the initiation of the scheme. Four main conclusions are drawn regarding this approach: it can give an indication of when repairs to ICCP systems are likely to be critical; provide new evidence for the design lives attributed to systems using lower cost anodes; reduce the requirement to replace systems at the end of their functional lives; and potentially extend the interval between planned maintenance of existing systems with corresponding reduction in monitoring frequency, cost and disruption...|$|E

40|$|Structural {{failures}} {{are closely}} linked to the corrosion of steel reinforcement in concrete. Application of cathodic protection (CP) system helps to improve the immunity against corrosive attack by repairing and rebuilding the passive layer around the steel reinforcement in concrete.

However, this research tried alternative energy viz. solar energy taking advantage of its abundance availability in Malaysia. It is therefore application of solar energy has been tried as an alternative to direct current in hoping to minimize the maintenance of the system. In addition, a total of 35 questionnaires had been sent to corrosion repair related organizations and professionals to get data about the usage of solar energy system application in Malaysia, especially in treating corrosion of reinforcement.

40|$|Inorganic coating {{materials}} {{are being developed}} to slow or stop corrosion of reinforcing steel members inside concrete structures. It is much simpler {{and easier to use}} these {{coating materials}} than it is to use conventional corrosion-inhibiting systems based on impressed electric currents. Unlike impressed electrical corrosion-inhibiting systems, these coatings do not require continuous consumption of electrical power and maintenance of power-supply equipment. Whereas some conventional systems involve the use of expensive arc-spray equipment to apply the metallic zinc used as the sacrificial anode material, the developmental coatings can be applied by use of ordinary paint sprayers. A coating material of the type under development is formulated as a liquid containing blended metallic particles and/or moisture-attracting compounds. The liquid mixture is sprayed onto a concrete structure. Experiments have shown that even though such a coat resides on the exterior surface, it generates a protective galvanic current that flows to the interior reinforcing steel members. By effectively transferring the corrosion process from the steel reinforcement to the exterior coating, the <b>protective</b> <b>current</b> slows or stops corrosion of the embedded steel. Specific formulations have been found to meet depolarization criteria of the National Association of Corrosion Engineers (NACE) for complete protection of steel reinforcing bars ("rebar") embedded in concrete...|$|E

40|$|The NASA LeRC in Cleveland, Ohio, is {{responsible}} for the design, development, and assembly of the Space Station Freedom (SSF) Electrical Power System (EPS). In order to identify and understand system level issues during the SSF program design and development phases, a system Power Management and Distribution (PMAD) dc test bed was assembled. Some of the objectives of this test bed facility are the evaluation of, system efficiency, power quality, system stability, and system protection and reconfiguration schemes. In order to provide a realistic operating scenario, dc Load Converter Units are used in the PMAD dc test bed to characterize the user interface with the power system. These units are dc to dc converters that provide the final system regulation before power is delivered to the load. This final regulation is required on the actual space station because the majority of user loads will require voltage levels different from the secondary bus voltage.

40|$|The use of {{sacrificial}} anodes consisting of sprayed zinc {{on the surface}} of concrete containing corroding reinforcing steel bars has been examined by means of field tests and laboratory experiments. The anodes are sprayed directly on the external surface of spalled regions of marine substructure elements. Electrical contact between the steel and zinc can be achieved efficiently by directly spraying over exposed steel. Field tests were made in the substructure of bridges in the Florida Keys and in Tampa Bay. The installations were performed economically and were functional after as much as 5 years following placement. <b>Protective</b> <b>current</b> densities reaching 1 mAfft 2 (1 J. 1 Afcm 2) of the reinforcing steel were achieved routinely. Tests with reinforcing steel probes and with entire reinforcement assemblies showed steel polarization decays (upontemporary disconnection) typically exceeding 100 mV even after several years of service. The laboratory tests revealed that in the marine substructure conditions of interest concrete resistivity does not represent a main limiting factor in the performance of the galvanic anodes. However, absence of direct wetting of the anode surface can result in long-term loss of adequate current delivery, even when the concrete is in contact with air of 85 % relative humidity. Periodic water contact (as caused by seawater mist, splash or weather exposure) is considered a necessary factor for long-term anode performance. The method is considered as a competitive alternative to impressed-current cathodic protection systems, and a considerable improvement over simple gunite repair of corrosion damaged substructure concrete...|$|E

This is termed secondary traumatic stress (STS; Figley, 1995). This paper reviews the predictors of STS in health and social care professionals followed by a study of the predictors of STS and burnout in paediatric nurses specifically. The literature review aimed to obtain an overview of the main risk and protective factors associated with STS. A systematic search of the literature was carried out, 68 studies met the inclusion criteria and a narrative synthesis was then conducted. The most consistent evidence suggested that increased empathy predicted STS whilst social support appeared <b>protective.</b> <b>Current</b> life stress was also associated with STS but the evidence was limited by methodological issues. Tentative evidence was found for the role of coping styles and compassion satisfaction, whilst evidence for exposure to workrelated trauma, a personal trauma history and emotional detachment was inconclusive. These are discussed in relation to clinical implications and directions for future research. The majority of research regarding predictors of STS and burnout has taken place in professionals working with adult populations and {{there is a lack of}} research regarding paediatric nurses specifically.

40|$|Abstract In {{this paper}} we model and test how general health {{conditions}} affect financial portfolio choices, conditional {{on the presence}} of a National Health System (NHS) and its level of coverage. We further propose a measure of risk of expenses for future health shocks in order to test whether portfolio decisions have a more “myopic ” or “forward-looking ” orientation. To this end, we use data taken from the first wave of SHARE to compare the participation decision of European elderly households in presence of different NHS. The results are consistent with our hypothesis, i. e. that portfolio choices are different across households who shares the same health status but live in countries with higher or lower protection via NHS. More specifically in countries without a protective NHS, a worse current perceived health status sensibly reduces the probability of holding risky assets, while in those with a <b>protective</b> NHS, <b>current</b> health status does not seem to affect portfolio choices.
