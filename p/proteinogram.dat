40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the acute phase response (APR) in 15 horses by quantifying physiological venous blood variables and serum acute phase proteins (APP) at 5 minutes and 6 and 12 hours after a training match of high-goal polo. The horses were divided into three experimental groups based on their team positions, including defense (n = 6), midfield (n = 5), and attack (n = 4). Serum <b>proteinograms</b> were obtained by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Data were evaluated using analysis of variance for repeated measures. The match represented a high-intensity stimulus for all positions. Defenders appeared to use the anaerobic pathway more than the other positions, as shown by their lower pH and greater lactatemia. Alterations in muscle membrane permeability were observed in all horses, as seen by the increase in serum creatine kinase activity without a correlation with APR. Significant elevations in total serum protein, albumin, ceruloplasmin, haptoglobin, alpha- 1 antitrypsin, and 23 -kDa protein were seen only during the course of the physical exertion of the match, although there were no differences in these values among positions of the team. After 6 hours of the match, the concentration of transferrin declined, whereas that of alpha- 1 acid glycoprotein remained unaltered at all assessed times. These results demonstrated that the defenders required the most use of the anaerobic pathway during the match, and that equestrian polo exercise triggers an acute phase response of relatively short duration; this APR is characterized as noninflammatory, as APR appears to be a physiological alteration related to the stress inherent in physical exercise...|$|R

Blood samples were collected for the measurement of total serum protein, electrophoresis of serum proteins, activity of the gamma glutamyl transferase, and concentration of IgG by the method of the zinc sulfate turbidity in periods between 24 and 36 hours of life, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 days. Statistical analysis was performed by ANOVA and Tukey test at 5 % significance level, and correlations between variables were calculated. Variations of serum proteins followed a pattern of physiological behavior over the first six months of life and production of immunoglobulins was active earlier in BWH calves and slower in the Criollo Lageano, without causing any impact on their health. Gamma globulin in the first days of life (24 - 36 h) was correlated with IgG (r= 0. 87 for CL and r= 0. 89 for BWH), PTS (r= 0. 91 for CL and r= 0. 92 for BWH), Glob (r= 0. 99 for CL and r= 0. 98 for BWH) and GGT (r= 0. 14 for CL and r= 0. 83 for BWH).

Objective of the study — identification of clinical and paraclinical features of influenza A (H 1 N 1) in the epidemiological season 2015 – 2016 in children of the Kharkiv region in Ukraine. Materials and methods. The etiology of the disease was established by identifying RNA of influenza viruses (polymerase chain reaction) in nasopharyngeal swabs. Results. Most of infected persons were urban children of the first ten years of life; the source of infection — parents. In one-third of patients, the disease was severe, the half had complications (hyperthermic convulsions, pneumonia). Clinical picture of the disease was characterized by the symptoms of intoxication, hyperthermia, respiratory failure, catarrhal, convulsive, hemorrhagic syndromes. Catarrhal syndrome manifested as a discharge from nose (poor mucous), cough (nonproductive with mucous sputum), pharyngeal hyperemia, hard breathing, whee­zing in lungs. In the presence of pneumonia, the signs of respiratory insufficiency were often detected. Occasionally, there were signs of hemorrhagic syndrome (petechial rash, blood in discharge from nose, sputum). In the half of patients, the peripheral blood changes were characterized by leukopenia with lymphocytosis, with involvement in pathological process of bacterial flora — neutrophilic leukocytosis; in one third — anemia. The clinical analysis of urine showed the symptoms of toxic irritation of kidney parenchyma in the half of patients. Changes of the acute-phase blood parameters were registered in the half of cases, in one-third — of the <b>proteinogram.</b> Bacteriological examinations showed the activation of secondary bacterial flora. Instrumental methods confirmed the presence of intoxication syndrome (parenchymal reaction of the liver, spleen; sinus tachycardia, disturbance of repolarization of ventricular myocardium). Conclusion. The main group of patients included urban children of the first ten years of life; the source of infection — parents. In one-third of patients, the disease was severe, in the half — with complications. Clinical picture of disease was characterized by the symptoms of intoxication, hyperthermia, respiratory failure, catarrhal, convulsive, hemorrhagic syndromes, activation of secondary bacterial flora...|$|E

OBJETIVO - Determinar o perfil clínico, laboratorial e histopatológico dos eritrodérmicos internados no HUCFF-UFRJ. MÉTODOS - No período de 1990 a 2007, 170 casos foram submetidos a hemograma, velocidade de hemossedimentação, bioquímica do sangue, provas de função hepática, proteínas totais e frações, pesquisa de células de Sézary no esfregaço de sangue periférico, radiografia de campos pleuropulmonares e biópsia de pele em três locais. RESULTADOS - Entre 92 homens e 78 mulheres, na faixa de 30 a 80 anos, identificaram-se 99 casos (58, 23 %) com dermatoses preexistentes; 37 (21, 77 %) com farmacodermias; 18 (10, 58 %) com linfomas cutâneos de células T e 16 (9, 4 %) de causa indeterminada. Calafrios, prurido, linfonodomegalias e edema de membros inferiores destacaram-se dentre sinais e sintomas. O perfil laboratorial consistiu de aumento da VHS, eosinofilia, leucocitose, linfocitose e anemia. No grupo de etiologia indeterminada, dois padrões histológicos emergiram: dermatite psoriasiforme e dermatite inespecífica. CONCLUSÃO - A psoríase foi a causa mais freqüente; três biópsias de pele simultâneas podem aumentar a acurácia do diagnóstico histopatológico.

The right mammary gland of ten healthy ewes was inoculated with 1, 0 x 10 (4) UFC/mL of S. aureus. Clinical examination and determination of serum concentrations of proteins by electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gel (SDS-PAGE), cupper, iron and zinc, as well plasma level of fibrinogen were measured before the inoculation (control) and 12 h, 24 h, 36 h, 48 h, 60 h, 72 h, 84 h, 96 h, 108 h, 120 h, 132 h, 168 h, 180 h, 288 h and 336 h after bacteria inoculation. All animals experimentally infected presented clinical mastitis and subsequent loss of mammary gland function. The electrophoretogram allowed the identification of 23 proteins with molecular weights (MW) ranged from 26. 000 to 185. 000 daltons (Da) including acute-phase proteins, IgG and IgA. A significant increase (P< 0, 05) in haptoglobin, ceruloplasmin, IgG and IgA concentrations was observed. Antitrypsin and acid glicoprotein concentrations did not alter. The levels of iron and zinc decreased and the cupper concentration increased. A positive correlation between plasma fibrinogen and serum ceruloplasmin (r= 0. 74), haptoglobin (r= 0. 62) and IgA (r= 0. 62) was also identified. Results showed the importance of ceruloplasmin and haptoglobin as acute-phase proteins in ewes with intramammary infections and confirms fibrinogen as an inflammatory marker because its high correlation with specific proteins. The alterations in the serum levels of Cu, Fe and Zn suggest the action of inflammatory mediators triggered by S. aureus...|$|E

40|$|Sixty eight {{cases of}} Sydenham's chorea (SC) were studied {{with the purpose}} of characterizing biologically the choreic {{individual}} by means of some laboratorial data. Based on antecedents, on the presence of recent infectious disease, on clinical examination, on electrocardiographs and x-rays of the heart, and according to a modified Jones criteria the patients were initially divided in three groups: a) Group 1 — 30 patients (case 1 to 30) which presented SC associated with active rheumatic fever (RF); b) Group 2 — 20 patients (cases 31 to 50) which presented SC associated with a previou or present infectious state without active RF; c) Group 3 — 18 patients (cases 51 to 68) which presented "pure" SC, not having anything in their antecedents, or in present history, nor in their physical examinations that could justify calling them "rheumatic" or "infectious". However the analysis of the clinical data, by means of the homogenization tests (qui square or the exact Fisher test) and Goodman's contrast test showed the artificiality of this grouping, which could not be longer sustained. From the 68 cases studied the average age group was 9. 9 years, with the maximum age being 17 years, and the minimum age being 4. 5 years. 47 of the cases were females as compared to 21 males (2. 2 to 1); 60 patients were white, 7 dark-skinned and one negro. The average evolution time of the choreic syndrome, {{at the time of the}} first consultation, was 6 months and 7 days, with a minimum of 13 days and a maximum of 60 months. The incidence of the outbreak as far as the season of the year is concerned, was as follows: 31 cases between autumn and winter; 14 cases in spring and 22 in summer. The following laboratory examinations have been made: a) "classical acute phase serum reagents" (APSR) : sedimentation rate, differential blood count, Weltmann reaction, mucoproteins, C reactive protein, antistreptolysin-O titter, electrophoresis of serum proteins; b) copper and ceruloplasmin; c) magnesium; d) sulphur; e) electrophoresis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteins; f) electroencephalograms (EEG). For each of the three initial groups, considering the laboratory examinations carried out, the correlations between the APSRs were studied and compared with the electroencephalograms, in accordance with partial correlation tests. The analysis of association tables as made in accordance with the exact Fisher method, the McNemar method and also by using the Goodman method. The real average values were estimated from the APSR results and the electroencephalograms, by points and intervals. The significance levels for these tests were 5 % and the confidence intervals (CI) referred to for the percentages obtained for each APSR and for the electroncephalograms were estimated using tables with a confidence of 95 %. The APSRs that showed the highest positive indexes in the confidence intervale, independently of any correlation, were: a) antistreptolysin-O (n = 43) was high in 60. 46 % (confidence interval (CI) = 45. 86 to 75. 06 %)), when the normal limit was considered up to 250 units; considering the normal limit of up to 333 units, therefore considering high titers starting at 400 units, the percentage of positivity fell to about half of the previous value (37. 2 %); b) copper (n = 39) appeared as the most altered APSR in our casuistics, with 94. 97 % (CI = 81. 0 to 98. 0 %) of high values; the ceruloplasmin (n = 40) kept pace with copper and was increased in 90. 0 % (CI = 80. 7 to 99. 3 %; c) the serum <b>proteinogram</b> (n = 24) showed patterns similar to those of the RF, that is, decrease in albumin in 66. 66 % and increase in alpha- 2 -globulin fraction in 91. 60 % (CI = 30. 00 to 70. 00 %) of the cases; a simultaneous alteration of these two fractions observed in 11 cases (45. 83 %, CI = 25. 9 to 65. 76 %); gamma-globulin, opposing the initial acute rheumatic patterns showed itself to be quite high 83. 33 % (CI = 68. 43 to 98. 23 %); d) magnesium (n = 38) decreased in 86. 84 % (CI = 76. 09 to 97. 59 %), increased in 4 cases (10. 52 %, CI = 2. 5 to 25. 0 %) and was normal in one case (2. 64 %,); e) sulphur (like SO 4 ion) was increased in 71. 79 % of the cases (CI = 57. 68 to 85. 90 %); f) the cerebrospinal fluid's <b>proteinogram</b> (n = 13) showed an increase of prealbumin in 6 cases (46. 15 %); g) the EEG, during the acute phase (n = 42) showed anormality in 45. 24 % of the cases (CI = 30. 19 to 60. 29 %); part of these anormalities persisted up to the phase of remission, when from 34 EEG only 29. 41 % (CI = 14. 11 to 44. 71 %) showed anormalities (10 cases); among these, two were "disorganization of the alpha rhythm", one of which normalized rapidly, another showed only asymmetry and may be considered normal; there remained then only 7 cases in the remission phase, with persistent anormalities, which however, are discussible as to their pathologic significance in the ones labeled as "slow for the age" and "paroxystic dysrhytmia by slow waves" in the occipital areas, in view of the age group to which they belong (4 to 11 years). Only two cases, in the remission phase, had anormalities in the temporal and occipital areas: case 29, with suggestion of "paroxystic dysrhythmia in the left occipital region, by acute atypical waves", and case 33, with "paroxystic dysrhythmia in the left-temporal region, by hypersynchronic waves"; this one was the only case that required anticonvulsive treatment. In concluding, the attempt to characterize Sydenham's chorea by means of some laboratory serum examinations showed that: 1) The classical "acute phase serum reagents" (sedimentation rate, blood count, Weltmann reaction, C reactive protein and mucoproteins) were not conclusive for this purpose; 2) the "acute phase serum reagents" that presented the greatest alterations in Sydenham's chorea were copper and ceruloplasmin, electrophoresis of serum proteins (alpha- 2 and gamma globulin fractions) and antistreptolysin-O; 3) the "acute phase serum reagents" when evaluated separately were of little value, but it is quite possible that two or more taken altogether could, in certain instances of the evolution of the disease, characterize "an infectious and/or inflammatory stage"; 4) eosinophilia was observed in a high percentage of cases (81. 66 %) requiring further studies for confirmation purposes; 5) the correlation of the various "acute phase serum reagents" studied among them and in comparison with other determined parameter (magnesium, sulphur, and EEGs) did not show statistical significance, not only when comparing the three initial groups, but also in its totality, facts that may suggest a unitarian pathogeny for Sydenham's chorea; 6) a high percentage of hypomagnesemia was found (86. 84 %) although at not too low levels; 7) sulphur was high in 71. 79 % of the cases. The EEG is not an element allowing distinction between a "pure" and a "rheumatic" chorea, and its valorization may not be based on a unique record, but on evolutive records, because only with a prolonged follow-up is it possible to be certain of the persistence or not of the encephalographic abnormalities...|$|E
