5|$|Smaller {{numbers of}} {{children}} show less positive development at age 12 months. Their less desirable attachment styles may be <b>predictors</b> <b>of</b> poor later social development. Although these children's behavior at 12 months is not a serious problem, {{they appear to be}} on developmental trajectories that will end in poor social skills and relationships. Because attachment styles may serve as <b>predictors</b> <b>of</b> later development, it may be appropriate to think of certain attachment styles as part of the range of attachment disorders.|$|E

5|$|For an {{ecosystem}} to support ticks, it must satisfy two requirements: the population density of host {{species in the}} area must be high enough, and humidity must be high enough for ticks to remain hydrated. Due to their role in transmitting Lyme disease, ixodid ticks, particularly the North American I.scapularis, have been studied using geographic information systems to develop predictive models for ideal tick habitats. According to these studies, certain features of a given microclimate – such as sandy soil, hardwood trees, rivers, {{and the presence of}} deer – were determined to be good <b>predictors</b> <b>of</b> dense tick populations.|$|E

40|$|UnrestrictedThis study {{examined}} the unique contributions of social acceptance and popularity in predicting perceived social reputations and perceived dyadic relationships in a cross-sectional sample of 418 sixth and seventh grade students (approximate average age of 12 years). We assessed early adolescents’ social status using peer nominations and measured {{their perceptions of their}} social status, their behavioral reputations, and their friendships from a combination of self-ratings and peer nominations. Social acceptance was a positive <b>predictor</b> <b>of</b> perceptions of social acceptance and friendships and a negative <b>predictor</b> <b>of</b> perceptions of rejection and victimization. Popularity was a positive <b>predictor</b> <b>of</b> perceptions of popularity, rejection, and aggression and a negative <b>predictor</b> <b>of</b> perceptions of unpopularity and withdrawal. The results were consistent with the suggestion that social acceptance is related to perceiving facets of reputations and relationships relevant to forming and maintaining friendships, whereas popularity is related to perceiving facets pertinent to gaining social power...|$|R

It was hypothesized that social anxiety would be a <b>predictor</b> <b>of</b> quantity and quality of social, romantic, and sexual relationships, interpersonal competence, social support and interpersonal dependency. Procedures included recruitment of 299 undergraduate students and administration of several self-report measures. Social anxiety was a significant <b>predictor</b> <b>of</b> number of friends, romantic relationships, and sexual partners, quality of romantic relationships, interpersonal competence, self-perceived social support, and interpersonal dependency.

40|$|Employee {{turnover}} is {{an important}} issue for any organization, but it is of critical importance for volunteer organizations. Research shows that a strong <b>predictor</b> <b>of</b> volunteer turnover is a volunteer’s intention to remain in that organization. This study measured volunteers’ intention to remain and compared the known <b>predictor</b> <b>of</b> burnout to the potential <b>predictor</b> <b>of</b> personality (through personality traits) in order to find a better <b>predictor</b> <b>of</b> a volunteer’s intention to remain in an organization. Using survey data obtained from 65 participants from a single volunteer organization, this study showed that burnout and personality traits failed to predict a volunteer’s intention to remain in an organization. Pearson correlations and a hierarchical regression of the personality traits found that the agreeableness personality trait was a weak <b>predictor</b> <b>of</b> a volunteer’s intention to remain in an organization. Future research into agreeableness and factors of lower burnout scores in an organization are discussed...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} the influence of Big Five personality traits on Facebook usage and examined the interactions of traits in this context based on Torgersen’s (1995) typological approach. The effect of self-esteem, narcissism, loneliness, shyness and boredom proneness on Facebook usage was also investigated. The sample included both student (N = 190) and (N = 184) non-student samples. Narcissism was the strongest <b>predictor</b> <b>of</b> time spent on Facebook per day for both students and non-students. Narcissism was also the strongest <b>predictor</b> <b>of</b> number of daily logins for non-students, however, agreeableness was the strongest <b>predictor</b> <b>of</b> logins for students. Extraversion was the strongest <b>predictor</b> <b>of</b> number of Facebook friends for both students and nonstudents, however the interaction of Extraversion and Neuroticism was also a <b>predictor</b> <b>of</b> Facebook friends for students, and the interaction of Extraversion and Conscientiousness for non-students.

In accordance with this, patients with IAH had higher severity scores and number of CRF for IAH that can independently increase mortality risk.

The direct effect of entrepreneurial strategy on strategic performance is 0.608 while the effect on market-based performance is 0.375. The findings show that entrepreneurial strategy acts as a strong <b>predictor</b> <b>of</b> entrepreneurial implementation. In addition, entrepreneurial strategy even acts as a stronger <b>predictor</b> <b>of</b> strategic performance but a weaker <b>predictor</b> <b>of</b> market performance. Analyses show that entrepreneurial strategy plays a different role between IEC and the two types of international performance.|$|R
40|$|The study {{described}} herein examined personality as a <b>predictor</b> <b>of</b> {{task and}} contextual performance. The Big Five personality dimensions (i. e., Neuroticism, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Openness to Experience, and Conscientiousness) were studied {{in relation to}} both task and contextual performance within an organization in the service industry. The situational factor, autonomy, was examined as a potential moderator for the hypothesized personality-contextual performance relationship. Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that Conscientiousness was a valid <b>predictor</b> <b>of</b> task performance, Neuroticism was a valid <b>predictor</b> <b>of</b> contextual performance, and Extraversion was a valid <b>predictor</b> <b>of</b> delinquent performance. However, results did not yield support for the moderating role of autonomy on the personality-contextual performance relationship. Nevertheless, job satisfaction did moderate the Openness to Experience-delinquent performance relationship. Practical implications of these results and suggestions for future research are discussed. ...|$|R

The Almost Perfect Scale-Revised (APS-R; Slaney, Rice, Mobley, Trippi, & Ashby, 2001) and the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire (BPAQ; Buss & Perry, 1992) were used for data collection. The sub dimensions of the APS-R were high standards, order (adaptive perfectionism), and discrepancy (maladaptive perfectionism). The sub dimensions of the BPAQ were anger, physical aggression, hostility and verbal aggression. As hypothesized, the regression analyses revealed that, discrepancy was the positive <b>predictor</b> <b>of</b> anger, physical aggression and hostility while order was the negative <b>predictor</b> <b>of</b> anger, physical and verbal aggression.
