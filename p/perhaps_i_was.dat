2500|$|On March 6, 1999, Jones was {{involved}} in an accident when he crashed his sport utility vehicle near his home. He {{was taken to the}} Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC), where he was released two weeks later. In May of that year, Jones pleaded guilty to drunk driving charges related to the accident. [...] (In his memoir published three years earlier, Jones admitted that he sometimes [...] had a glass of wine before dinner and that he still drank beer occasionally but insisted, [...] "I don't squirm in my seat, fighting the urge for another drink" [...] and speculated, [...] "...perhaps I'm not a true alcoholic in the modern sense of the word. [...] <b>Perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> always just an old fashion drunk.") ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes; and I {{am afraid}} from that, that my remark was but discouragement, wearing the dress of comfort. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{not quite right}} in--' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You didn't mean {{to neglect}} me. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> foolish, Stephen, but I felt you left me out. There were ways I could have helped." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I shall get to like them. They are an {{acquired}} taste, <b>I</b> expect. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> too. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> the human parsnip, {{and you will}} have to learn to love me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] cried she. [...] "I {{come close}} to you, holding you. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> royal, <b>perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> sacred. If <b>I</b> hold you--Would God we could fly with my arms about you!--it may be, they will not shoot at you--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Now {{there has}} just arisen {{one of those}} rare cases, in which <b>I</b> <b>am</b> willing to depart from my principles. My uncle has given me a box—what you would call a Christmas box. I don’t know what’s in it, and no more do you: <b>perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> an April fool, or <b>perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> already {{enormously}} wealthy; there might be five hundred pounds in this apparently harmless receptacle!’ ...|$|R
60|$|I {{handed over}} the money without a word. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> taking {{advantage}} of the man's present state, but I considered I was doing things for the best.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{felt sure}} {{of it from the}} way in which you speak of him. But I thought also that you had refused him. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> wrong there?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, if {{you mean}} to say it was unconscious, <b>perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> mistaken. The thing may have been {{altogether}} in my own mind. I'd like {{to take another look at}} it----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, but <b>I</b> {{understood}} it. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> touchy; <b>I</b> don't think <b>I</b> <b>am</b> ungrateful. They {{have always}} made you {{like one of}} themselves." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, father, {{you don't}} understand, you can't understand!" [...] Joe broke forth at last. [...] "I try to study--I {{honestly}} try to study; but somehow--I don't know how--I can't study. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> a failure. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not made for study. I {{want to go}} out into the world. I want to see life--to live. I don't want any military academy; I 'd sooner go to sea--anywhere where I can do something and be something." ...|$|R
6000|$|Kit {{looked up}} with an apologetic smile. [...] "You imply I'm dull? <b>Perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> dull. You see, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> pretty strenuously {{occupied}} not long since." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, indeed. I went swimming, you remember. But <b>perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{not strong}} enough to do that. I--I'm very careful of myself, yet I seem to grow weaker all the time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't {{mean to be}} dramatic," [...] Evelyn {{answered}} quietly. [...] "Still, <b>perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> rather highly strung. Reggie {{asked me}} to marry him, and I told him I could not." ...|$|E
60|$|Their pursuit {{surprised}} and perplexed me. Nor was there wanting a vague feeling of alarm to heighten these emotions. But <b>perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> mistaken, {{and this time}} they meant not me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps not. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> talking nonsense. But it is {{only with}} you that I talk nonsense. I never do so with my cousin." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No dangers," [...] I replied. [...] "Some little difficulty, <b>perhaps.</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{thinking}} of the safest way of putting my two letters into Fanny's hands." ...|$|R
60|$|CRICHTON (thoughtfully). I admit I do prefer it. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{a little}} old-fashioned in these matters. (Her tears again threaten.) Ah, don't, Polly; that's nothing.|$|R
6000|$|<b>Perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> already doubting my {{decision}} to part for ever from Nettie, for I think I had it in mind to tell him all that had been said and done. [...] .|$|E
6000|$|I {{found it}} hard work to keep back the words that seemed most suitable, and <b>perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not {{altogether}} successful, while Aline's forehead turned crimson and she clenched her hand viciously as she added: ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I did {{not mean}} that, but, as I say, <b>perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> no fair judge. One thing is well, the {{relations}} will be {{much less likely to}} take them from you when you are living here.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There, <b>perhaps,</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not a judge, as I never kept a school;--but I think not. If any father {{writes to}} you, then {{tell him the}} truth." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I do not know," [...] said Lord Roehampton. [...] "Perhaps <b>I</b> <b>am</b> fastidious, <b>perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> content; to {{be noticed}} {{sometimes}} by a Lady Montfort should, I think, satisfy any man." ...|$|R
6000|$|Norgate smiled. [...] "Have I really {{acquired}} the correct diplomatic air?" [...] he asked. [...] "I {{can assure you}} that it <b>is</b> an accident--or <b>perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> imitative." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And I’m sure it’s {{very kind}} of you," [...] {{continued}} the girl, [...] "and if I’ve hurt your feelings by refusing you, it is only because I have thought <b>perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{not good enough for}} you." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{wrong in}} saying 'a pun.' But I thought I apprehended a double sense in your {{application}} of the term 'Apostolical succession' to Oxford's 'breeding' and 'hatching,' words which imply succession in a way unecclesiastical.|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't {{understand}} what you were after. I had misjudged. I didn't know. I think <b>perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> rather stupid." [...] Her eyes were suddenly shining with tears. [...] "You didn't give me much chance to understand." ...|$|E
6000|$|... --I {{should like}} to know, he said, which brother you... I {{understand}} you to suggest there was misconduct {{with one of the}} brothers... But <b>perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> anticipating? ...|$|R
60|$|Don Ferd. Ay, {{to bless}} my rival, <b>perhaps.</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> in a humour to suspect everybody.--You loved her once, and thought her an angel, as I do now.|$|R
60|$|MARGARET (pelting {{him with}} nuts). I can't sleep when the moon's at the full; she keeps calling {{to me to}} get up. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> her {{daughter}} too.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course I have, and I'm {{very much}} obliged {{to you for}} taking me to the theatre," [...] I added. After all, <b>perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> misjudging him. What {{possible}} motive could he have for being my enemy? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] was the answer. [...] "I did not, however, {{tell our}} estimable partner so. It seemed a pity to relieve him prematurely {{of what he}} called his fear of the sick. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> wrong in this." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{spoke with}} great vehemence, as though angry; and <b>perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not very {{willing to be}} put down so shortly, for young men are disputatious. At least I {{remember}} I retorted hotly, crying out upon childish superstitions.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{thought you}} would like the view," [...] she said; [...] "but perhaps you have <b>been</b> here, <b>perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> taking you to {{one of your own}} possessions." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I'm {{dull and}} sad! indeed, indeed [...] I know I have no reason! [...] 270 [...] <b>Perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not well in health, [...] And 'tis a gloomy season.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sufficient," [...] said Sylvia, [...] "is {{a purely}} {{relative}} term. So much depends upon one's temperament, doesn't it? <b>Perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> a little extravagant, and that's why I'm disappointed." ...|$|R
