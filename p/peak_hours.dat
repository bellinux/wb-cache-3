30|$|DRM is {{the process}} of {{adjusting}} consumer’s demand in response to the price of energy and incentives from grid side. The generation unit sends their energy cost pattern of different time periods. The time in which power cost is high is called high <b>peak</b> <b>hour</b> and the time in which power cost is low is called off <b>peak</b> <b>hour.</b> So during high <b>peak</b> <b>hour,</b> consumers can keep their flexible appliances off and run at low <b>peak</b> <b>hour.</b>|$|R
5|$|<b>Peak</b> <b>hours</b> {{rates are}} in effect from 07:00 - 09:00 and from 16:00 - 18:00, Mondays to Fridays except for public holidays.|$|E
5|$|The Yellow Line of the Washington Metro {{consists}} of 17 rapid transit stations from Huntington in Virginia to either Mount Vernon Square (where <b>peak</b> <b>hours</b> trains terminate) or Fort Totten (outside of <b>peak</b> <b>hours).</b> Additional Yellow Line trains may continue passenger service to Greenbelt during off-peak hours and weekends {{in order to}} stage them for Green Line service or for storage at the Greenbelt rail yard. In non rush/peak hours, almost all regularly scheduled trains run to Fort Totten.|$|E
5|$|At {{all times}} of day, but {{particularly}} at <b>peak</b> <b>hours,</b> {{it is common}} for vehicles to have to queue beyond the next ferry departure. Several rearrangements and improvements have been made to the vehicle queueing arrangements over the years, especially to avoid impact on other local traffic.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, Route 12A {{provides}} <b>peak</b> <b>hour</b> {{service and}} limited weekend service to Springbrook. Route 50 provides <b>peak</b> <b>hour</b> {{service to the}} Edgar Industrial Park. The Riverside Industrial Park is served by Route 51, the main <b>peak</b> <b>hour</b> service provider for this area; various limited service deviations are known as Route 52, 53 and 54.|$|R
30|$|Future {{scenarios}} {{are based on}} 50 -year and 100 -year return period of rainfall. The rainfall values with intensity are taken from the IDF curve for period of one <b>hour.</b> Furthermore, <b>peak</b> <b>hour</b> traffic is used of the university road [39]. <b>Peak</b> <b>hour</b> traffic is taken from the previous survey. The extrapolated <b>peak</b> <b>hour</b> volume is used as 3040 veh/h from NIPA to Hasan Square and 2122 veh/h in the opposite direction. In the survey report, the average daily traffic (ADT) is calculated, which is then converted to <b>peak</b> <b>hour</b> by taking 9.5 % of the ADT [40].|$|R
50|$|On 1 April another <b>peak</b> <b>hour</b> variant started, service X41; it was Prittlewell to Green Park via Rochford, Ashingdon and Rayleigh. At {{the same}} time, route X31 was again {{increased}} to 9 <b>peak</b> <b>hour</b> journeys and a Saturday trip was introduced. Route numbers X10 and X30 were introduced for <b>peak</b> <b>hour</b> journeys which ran fast from Corringham to Purfleet via {{the newly opened}} A13 Socketts Heath by-pass on 22 July 1985.|$|R
5|$|Curving {{around the}} north of London before turning south into the City, the North London Line was, for most passengers, a slower route into the {{financial}} district than alternative options like taking the Underground or changing at Euston or King's Cross. By 1960, only 41 trains carrying 6,400 passengers arrived at Broad Street in the three morning <b>peak</b> <b>hours.</b>|$|E
5|$|Horse-drawn {{traffic was}} {{partially}} {{banned from the}} tunnel during <b>peak</b> <b>hours</b> in July 1939 and completely banned in August 1947. Pedestrians have been banned from using the Blackwall Tunnels since May 1969, but pedestrians and cyclists may also use the foot tunnels at Greenwich (close to Island Gardens and Cutty Sark stations) and Woolwich (close to the Woolwich Ferry).|$|E
5|$|Route 41 runs at a {{frequency}} of 6 minutes during <b>peak</b> <b>hours</b> on weekdays, and 15 to 20 minutes at other times. Some trips are truncated to Northgate instead of serving Lake City. In spring 2015, Metro estimated that 10,000 daily riders used route 41 on weekdays.|$|E

40|$|The {{estimated}} demand used in {{the planning}} process of Buenos Aires City Airport Master Plan, developed by the Unit of Renegotiation and Contract Analysis of Public Services from Argentina, has not included infrastructure planning parameters: passenger <b>peak</b> <b>hour</b> and operation <b>peak</b> <b>hour.</b> These parameters must be determined to properly project, for the short, medium and long term development stages, the airport air-side, land-side and support elements. In order to consider infrastructure planning parameters two different methods have been used, all based in the historical data of year 2007 : the <b>peak</b> <b>hour</b> movements and the airplane distribution, determined from the six peak hours; and the <b>peak</b> <b>hour</b> passenger distribution, determined from a FAA index. Also the traffic month distribution and the <b>peak</b> <b>hour</b> transit for national and international passengers for arrivals and departures have been determined. The results and conclusions of these determinations are presented...|$|R
50|$|Pattern 5: Hamilton, all to Warabrook, then Beresfield, Thornton, Metford, Victoria Street, Maitland, and all {{stations}} to Scone {{and vice versa}} (peak and off-peak, 2 services (1 afternoon <b>peak</b> <b>hour,</b> 1 evening <b>peak</b> <b>hour)</b> on weekdays, 1 evening service on weekends).|$|R
5|$|Served {{mostly by}} a shuttle train and having low {{passenger}} numbers, {{the station and}} branch were considered for closure several times. Service was offered only during weekday <b>peak</b> <b>hours</b> from 1962 and discontinued in 1994, when the cost of replacing the lifts was considered too high for the income generated.|$|E
5|$|The Mumbai Suburban Railway, popularly {{referred}} to as Locals forms {{the backbone of the}} city's transport system. It is operated by the Central Railway and Western Railway zones of the Indian Railways. Mumbai's suburban rail systems carried a total of 6.3million passengers every day in 2007. Trains are overcrowded during <b>peak</b> <b>hours,</b> with nine-car trains of rated capacity 1,700 passengers, actually carrying around 4,500 passengers at <b>peak</b> <b>hours.</b> The Mumbai rail network is spread at an expanse of 319 route kilometres. 191 rakes (train-sets) of 9 car and 12 car composition are utilised to run a total of 2,226 train services in the city.|$|E
5|$|The last {{passenger}} train services in Radstock closed in 1966, {{and the last}} coal mines closed in 1973. Manufacturing industries such as printing, binding and packaging provide some local employment. More recently Radstock has become a commuter town for the nearby cities of Bath and Bristol, leading to traffic problems at <b>peak</b> <b>hours.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{station is}} served at 20 minute {{intervals}} by S-Bahn lines 2, 4 and 6, with line S 6 only {{operating in the}} <b>peak</b> <b>hour.</b> In addition, S-Bahn line S 2 services run at 10-minute intervals during the <b>peak</b> <b>hour.</b>|$|R
50|$|All S-Bahn {{services}} run at 30 minute intervals. In the <b>peak</b> <b>hour,</b> extras {{services are}} run {{so that each}} services runs at 15-minute intervals. In the <b>peak</b> <b>hour</b> lines S8 and S9 run on almost the same route, generally at 15 minute intervals. Line S 8 runs only during the <b>peak</b> <b>hour</b> to Hanau; at other times it begins or ends at Offenbach Ost. Line S1 services sometimes begin in Offenbach Ost and then just runs to Frankfurt-Höchst or Hochheim.|$|R
50|$|During {{the initial}} {{operation}} period, the new platforms and track were only operated on weekdays except public holidays, {{during the morning}} <b>peak</b> <b>hour</b> period, from 7:00 am to 9:00 am, as there were only five new C151A trains ready for revenue service. Evening <b>peak</b> <b>hour</b> operation from 5:00 pm to 8:00 pm on weekdays started from 27 December 2011 while the morning <b>peak</b> <b>hour</b> period was extended to end an hour later at 10:00 am after the next batch of trains became ready for revenue service.|$|R
5|$|The {{station has}} six {{platform}}s. All trains call at Waterloo East and most call at London Bridge except for during <b>peak</b> <b>hours,</b> when trains from Charing Cross (AM) or to Charing Cross (PM) {{will not stop}} until the opening of London Bridge's new platform 6.|$|E
5|$|After {{operating}} {{only during}} <b>peak</b> <b>hours</b> {{for more than}} 30years, the closure announcement came on 4 January 1993. The original 1907 lifts at Aldwych required replacement {{at a cost of}} £3million. This was not justifiable as only 450 passengers used the station each day and it was losing London Regional Transport £150,000 per year. The Secretary of State for Transport granted permission on 1 September 1994 to close the station and the branch closed on 30 September.|$|E
5|$|Along Line 2, {{the station}} is located between the Jinke Road station and the Tangzhen station. It takes {{approximately}} 60 minutes to ride the train to the East Xujing station, {{the west end of}} the line, and 34 minutes to the Pudong Airport station, the eastern terminus. The train operates from 5:30 to 22:45 westbound and from 6:30 to 21:00 eastbound. On weekdays, trains leave the station approximately every 3 minutes and 30 seconds during <b>peak</b> <b>hours</b> and every four to ten minutes during non-peak hours. <b>Peak</b> <b>hours</b> are defined as from 7:30 to 9:30 and 17:00 to 19:00 on Monday through Thursday, as well as 7:00 to 9:00 and 12:50 to 20:30 on Friday. On weekends, trains leave the stations every 4 minutes and 5 seconds from 8:00 to 20:30, and every five to ten minutes during other times. The station is a transfer station for passengers traveling to or from points east on Line 2. From Guanglan Road to the east, Line 2 uses 4-carriage trains; to the west Line 2 uses 8-carriage trains.|$|E
50|$|Between {{the hours}} of 7:00 am and 9:15 am, and 3:00 pm and 6:15 pm, Monday through Friday, <b>peak</b> <b>hour</b> service is provided. All routes operate at 30 minute frequency. Route 4 does not receive <b>Peak</b> <b>Hour</b> {{operation}} as it is 30 minute frequency all day.|$|R
50|$|In {{the morning}} <b>peak</b> <b>hour,</b> Frankston bound {{services}} use Platform 3, with Flinders Street bound trains using Platforms 1 and 2.

5|$|As planned, {{counterclockwise}} trains, to {{and from}} Jamaica and Howard Beach, would have run every 2 minutes during <b>peak</b> <b>hours,</b> for a frequency of 30 trains per hour (tph). Each branch would have been served by a train every four minutes, or 15 tph. The final environmental impact statement planned for even higher frequencies of 40 tph, or a train every 90 seconds in the central terminal area. However, , actual frequencies were much lower, with each branch being served by one train every 7 to 12 minutes during <b>peak</b> <b>hours,</b> or 5 to 8.5 tph. During middays, trains come every 10 to 15 minutes, with 4 to 6 tph on each branch. Late night service is less frequent: trains come every 15 to 20 minutes, with 3 to 4 tph on each branch. Weekend service is similar to night service, with trains coming every 16 minutes, or 4 tph on each branch. Trains make the journey between the terminals and either Jamaica or Howard Beach in about eight minutes.|$|E
5|$|Metro fares vary {{based on}} the {{distance}} traveled {{and the time of}} day at entry. During <b>peak</b> <b>hours</b> (weekdays from opening until 9:30a.m. and 3–7p.m.), fares (effective 2014) range from $2.25 to $6.00, depending on distance traveled. At all other times, fares range from $2.00 to $3.85 based on distance traveled. Discounted fares are available for school children, the disabled, and the elderly. Metro charges reduced fares on all federal holidays.|$|E
5|$|On 1 May 2016 {{the route}} saw several changes. Faster buses were {{introduced}} at peak time between Manchester and Burnley, and the route was extended twice an hour beyond Burnley to Skipton via the M65 and Colne. Nelson, however, {{is no longer}} served by off-peak X43 buses, although services remain during <b>peak</b> <b>hours.</b> A Sunday extension of the route to Grassington was introduced; these services had already operated, but had previously used route number 872.|$|E
