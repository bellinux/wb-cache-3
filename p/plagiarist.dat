5|$|A {{number of}} other {{characters}} in Little Annie Fanny are derived from Gray's Little Orphan Annie. Sugardaddy Bigbucks, Annie's surrogate father and a powerful, manipulative capitalist, is based on Daddy Warbucks. His mysterious assistant, the Wasp, derives from Warbucks' assistant the Asp, and Punchjab, his bodyguard, comes from the character Punjab. Other supporting characters include ad man Benton Battbarton (whose name is taken from the advertising agencies Batten, Barton, Durstine & Osborn and Benton & Bowles), Battbarton's rival Huck Buxton (modeled on gap-toothed British actor Terry-Thomas), Duncan Fyfe Hepplewhite (an art <b>plagiarist),</b> and Freddie Flink (who resembles comic actor Fred Gwynne from Car 54, Where Are You?).|$|E

Lauder's work was a hoax that painted Milton as a <b>plagiarist.</b>|$|E
25|$|Nicolae and Alexandru Xenopol {{were both}} {{involved}} in nationalistic agitation {{for the cause}} of Romanians in Transylvania and other regions of Austria-Hungary. In 1911, some of their books had been censored in Transylvania, and were subject to confiscation by the Hungarian Gendarmes. The same year, in May, N. Xenopol was called upon as an expert witness in the trial between antisemitic academic A. C. Cuza and lawyer Emil Socor. Xenopol was supposed to testify as to whether Socor had been right to call Cuza a <b>plagiarist,</b> but he recused himself.|$|E

It must be owned, at the same time, that Sterne selects the materials of his mosaic work with so much art, places them so well, and polishes them so highly, that in most cases we are disposed to pardon the want of originality, in consideration of the exquisite talent with which the borrowed materials are wrought up into the new form.|$|E

25|$|According to Mazzarella's 1818 {{biography}} of Lalli, {{on his return}} to Venice he recited some of his poetry to Zeno and asked for his opinion. Zeno recognized the poems which had been published several years earlier in Naples and {{said that while the}} poetry had merit, Lalli was either a <b>plagiarist</b> or was actually Sebastiano Biancardi. At this point, Lalli revealed his true identity to Zeno and confessed to the reason he had left Naples. Zeno took him under his wing and introduced him to the Grimani family who hired Lalli to assist in the management of their theatres (Teatro San Samuele and Teatro San Giovanni Grisostomo) and to re-work older libretti for new productions.|$|E
25|$|By {{the late}} 1930s, Ciprian had also {{established}} himself as a leading modernist dramatist and director, with plays such as The Man and His Mule. Although his work in the field is described as the product of 1920s Expressionist theater, he was sometimes branded a <b>plagiarist</b> of his dead friend's writings. This claim was traced back to Arghezi, and was probably a publicity stunt meant to increase Urmuz's exposure, but taken with seriousness by another opinion maker, journalist Constantin Beldie. The ensuing scandal was amplified by the young Dadaists and Surrealists, who took the rumor to be true: Avramescu-Uranus, himself accused of plagiarizing Urmuz, made an ironic reference to this fact in a 1929 contribution to Bilete de Papagal. Unwittingly, Arghezi's allegations cast a shadow of doubt on Ciprian's overall work for the stage.|$|E
25|$|In a 2010 {{interview}} with the Los Angeles Times, Mitchell {{was quoted as saying}} that singer-songwriter Bob Dylan, with whom she had worked closely in the past, was a fake and a <b>plagiarist.</b> The controversial remark was widely reported by other media. Mitchell did not explain the contention further, but several media outlets speculated that it may have related to the allegations of plagiarism surrounding some lyrics on Dylan's 2006 album Modern Times. In a 2013 {{interview with}} Jian Ghomeshi, she was asked about the comments and responded by denying that she had made the statement while mentioning the allegations of plagiarism that arose over the lyrics to Dylan's 2001 album Love and Theft in the general context of the flow and ebb of the creative process of artists.|$|E
40|$|Information {{integrity}} and security {{are of the}} utmost importance in both an academic and a business setting. In an academic setting, the most often talked about information integrity violation is plagiarism. The current means for detecting and controlling plagiarism in a university setting relies on the use of plagiarism detection software. Though this software is able to detect certain types of plagiarism, many forms will go unnoticed. Consequently, as a sole means to police information integrity violations in the academic domain, this software is ineffective. The research here looks to provide an improved user interface design for the results of such software in the hopes that it can modify the behaviour of potential <b>plagiarists.</b> The goal of this research is to attack the problem of plagiarism from a different angle by focusing on modifying the behaviour of potential <b>plagiarists</b> rather than focus on a simple law based system. In the view of Lessig, this thesis introduces a technological regulator to plagiarism prevention. In addition, links have been made to the potential use cases of such software in a business environment for the security of enterprise information. This research has found that the introduction of a technological regulator has been helpful to change the behaviour of potential <b>plagiarists.</b> This research is conducted using the method of design science research...|$|R

25|$|He {{took his}} journalistic career further when he a new daily, Prezentul ("The Now") and, in 1908, the weekly Cuvinte Libere ("Free Words"). Prezentul {{was engaged in}} polemics with Furnica, the satirical magazine. The latter hosted rhyming jokes about Streitman's {{supposed}} sensationalism. Streitman's coworkers and employees were Rudolf Uhrinowsky, ridiculed by Furnica for his unusual surname, poet Victor Eftimiu, and (Eftimiu noted) Adrien Le Corbeau, already famous as a habitual <b>plagiarist.</b> Joining them as literary contributors were three young poets, all of them representing the Romanian Symbolist movement: Mihail Cruceanu, Al. T. Stamatiad, and Eugeniu Sperantia. According to Eftimiu, Prezentul was a struggling business, occupying an unheated room on Macca Arcade, with Streitman often missing out on payments for his staff. In March 1910, Streitman's entire mobile property was confiscated by court order, and auctioned off to pay off his debt to an R. Goldemberg.|$|E
25|$|In 1900, Rosetti {{ultimately}} {{graduated from}} the Bucharest law faculty with a thesis on press infractions in Romanian law. He performed service in the Romanian Land Forces, reaching the rank of Lieutenant in an artillery regiment stationed at Chitila fort. After working in minor positions for the tribunals of Brăila and Constanța, by 1903 he had been advanced to prosecutor for the Prahova County court. Living in Ploiești, he married and divorced a Marioara Naumescu. This period also saw his debut as a dramatic author, with plays on social topics. In the 1898 O lecție ("A Lesson"), {{the wife of a}} <b>plagiarist</b> expresses her contempt by pursuing an adulterous affair and getting pregnant; Păcate ("Sins"), which appeared in 1901, unveils the love triangles that break apart a middle-class family. Both plays were taken up by the National Theater Bucharest, with Livescu in one of the title roles.|$|E

These were ethnic Romanian writers from Transylvania, region that was then still part of Austria-Hungary, including many traditionalists published by Sămănătorul.

As one critic described the transformation, [...] "In barely over a year, a young <b>plagiarist</b> had been reborn as a songwriter of substance, and his first album of fully realized original material got the 1960s off their musical starting block."
