25|$|Voltec, {{formerly}} known as E-Flex, is a General Motors powertrain released in November 2010. The Voltec architecture is primarily a plug-in capable, battery-dominant electric vehicle with additional fossil fuel powered series and <b>parallel</b> <b>hybrid</b> capabilities.|$|E
25|$|Parallel hybrids, such as Honda's Insight, Civic, and Accord hybrids, can {{simultaneously}} {{transmit power}} to their drive wheels from two distinct sources—for example, an {{internal combustion engine}} and a battery-powered electric drive. Although most parallel hybrids incorporate an electric motor between the vehicle's engine and transmission, a <b>parallel</b> <b>hybrid</b> can also use its engine to drive one of the vehicle's axles, while its electric motor drives the other axle and/or a generator used for recharging the batteries. This type is called a road-coupled hybrid. The Audi Duo plug-in hybrid concept car {{is an example of}} this type of <b>parallel</b> <b>hybrid</b> architecture. Parallel hybrids can be programmed to use the electric motor to substitute for the ICE at lower power demands as well as to substantially increase the power available to a smaller ICE, both of which substantially increase fuel economy compared to a simple ICE vehicle.|$|E
2500|$|In <b>parallel</b> <b>hybrids,</b> the ICE and the {{electric}} motor are both {{connected to the}} mechanical transmission and can simultaneously transmit power to drive the wheels, usually through a conventional transmission. Honda's Integrated Motor Assist (IMA) system as found in the Insight, Civic, Accord, {{as well as the}} GM Belted Alternator/Starter (BAS Hybrid) system found in the Chevrolet Malibu hybrids are examples of production <b>parallel</b> <b>hybrids.</b> The internal combustion engine of many <b>parallel</b> <b>hybrids</b> can also act as a generator for supplemental recharging. [...] Currently, commercialized <b>parallel</b> <b>hybrids</b> use a full size combustion engine with a single, small (<20nbsp&kW) electric motor and small battery pack as {{the electric}} motor is designed to supplement the main engine, not to be the sole source of motive power from launch. <b>Parallel</b> <b>hybrids</b> are more efficient than comparable non-hybrid vehicles especially during urban stop-and-go conditions where the electric motor is permitted to contribute, and during highway operation.|$|R
50|$|<b>Parallel</b> <b>hybrids</b> can {{be further}} {{categorized}} by the balance between the different motors are at providing motive power: the ICE may be dominant (engaging the electric motor only in specific circumstances) or vice versa; while in others can run on the electric system alone but because current <b>parallel</b> <b>hybrids</b> are unable to provide electric-only or internal combustion-only modes they are often categorized as mild hybrids (see below).|$|R
50|$|Power-split hybrid or series-parallel <b>hybrid</b> are <b>parallel</b> <b>hybrids</b> that {{incorporate}} power-split devices, allowing for power paths from the ICE to the wheels {{that can be}} either mechanical or electrical. The main principle is to decouple the power supplied by the primary source from the power demanded by the driver.|$|R
25|$|In 2006, General Motors Saturn Division {{began to}} market a mild <b>parallel</b> <b>hybrid,</b> the 2007 Saturn Vue Green Line, which {{utilized}} GM's Belted Alternator/Starter (BAS Hybrid) system {{combined with a}} 2.4-litre L4 engine and an FWD automatic transmission.

25|$|General Motors {{revealed}} several prototype {{variants of}} the EV1 drivetrain at the 1998 Detroit Auto Show. The models included diesel/electric <b>parallel</b> <b>hybrid,</b> gas turbine/electric series hybrid, fuel cell/electric version and {{compressed natural gas}} low emission internal combustion engine version. In addition, during this period, GM reorganized their electronics divisions (among them Hughes Electronics and Delco Divisions) into Delco Propulsion Systems in order to attempt to commercialize this technology in niche markets. Several non-affiliated companies purchased inverter and drivetrain systems from DPS for vehicle/fleet conversion purposes.|$|E
25|$|The Solaris Urbino 12 Hybrid uses a <b>parallel</b> <b>hybrid</b> system HDU {{made by the}} American company Eaton. It {{comprises}} {{inter alia}} with a 6-speed Eaton automatic gearbox and one electric motor with maximum power of 44kW (60hp). In normal traffic movement the power is on about 28kW (38hp). It operates with a Cummins ISB6.7EV 225B diesel engine, meeting {{the requirements of the}} EEV standard, with a maximum power of 165kW (225hp) and the volume of 6.7 dm. The Eaton gearbox transmits power to the rear axle. All batteries are lithium-ion (Li-Ion) made by the Japanese company Hitachi which have been placed under the platforms inside the vehicle. By this the appearance of the bus has changed and the look is different when compared with the traditional diesel engine powered buses. The cost of this system is about 70 thousand Euros.|$|E

2500|$|The Evoque was {{developed}} from the LRX concept vehicle {{with the goal of}} producing a smaller more environmentally conscious and more affordable vehicle. [...] The size of the LRX complemented a wide array of efficiency improving technologies in the form of Land Rover’s e_Terrain technologies.

2500|$|The {{general layout}} of the initial {{production}} platform is considered {{by some to be}} a plug-in series hybrid design (since mechanical power initially drives the generator, which in turn charges the battery pack), despite its transmission design that makes it, by definition, a <b>parallel</b> <b>hybrid.</b> Power is drained from the batteries to run the electrical motors which move the vehicle. The internal combustion engine can run at a constant speed for both optimal efficiency and mechanical simplicity (i.e., {{there is no need for}} variable cam phasing). [...] The Voltec, like the Prius, uses a planetary gearset to couple power from two sources to the wheels. Unlike the Prius, the Voltec only rarely drives the wheels with mechanical assist from the engine, and only when battery charge is depleted. The Voltec could therefore be considered a power-split hybrid.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} ways to create an electric-Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) hybrid. The variety of electric-ICE designs can be {{differentiated}} by how the electric and combustion portions of the powertrain connect, at what times each portion is in operation, and what percent of the power is provided by each hybrid component. Two major categories are series <b>hybrids</b> and <b>parallel</b> <b>hybrids,</b> though <b>parallel</b> designs are most common today.|$|R
25|$|In series hybrids, {{only the}} {{electric}} motor drives the drivetrain, {{and a smaller}} ICE works as a generator to power the electric motor or to recharge the batteries. They also usually have a larger battery pack than <b>parallel</b> <b>hybrids,</b> making them more expensive. Once the batteries are low, the small combustion engine can generate power at its optimum settings at all times, making them more efficient in extensive city driving.|$|R

As part of a project of the Alliance for Global Sustainability between the MIT, the SFITs and the University of Tokyo, a new evolutionary multi-objective optimisation algorithm has been developed and applied to various problems including vehicle drivetrain configurations. The simulation of a potential vehicle is complex and calculation intensive. The new algorithm, the Clustering Pareto Evolustionary Algorithm (CPEA) is attractive {{in this kind of}} problems because it allows an efficient use of each vehicle simulation- gathering more information about the solution domain for the same effort as a single point optimisation. In addition it allows optimisation of disparate objectives, for example, costs and emissions to be considered separately.

Adopting a <b>hybrid</b> <b>parallel</b> model, this algorithm combines the cyclic reduction method and the partition method. This hybrid algorithm has simple backward substitution on parallel computers comparing with the cyclic reduction method. In this paper, the operation count and execution time are obtained to evaluate and make comparison for these methods. On the basis of results of these measured parameters, the hybrid algorithm using the hybrid approach with a multi-threading implementation achieves better efficiency than the other parallel methods, i. e., the cyclic reduction and the partition methods. In particular, the approach involved in this paper has the least scalar operation count and the shortest execution time on a multi-core computer when the size of equations meets some dimension threshold. The <b>hybrid</b> <b>parallel</b> algorithm improves the performance of the cyclic reduction and partition methods by 19. 2 % and 13. 2 % respectively.
