40|$|A {{total of}} 93 Yersinia spp. were {{isolated}} from 68 of 252 dogs in Shimane Prefecture, Japan. The Yersinia spp. were 70 Yersinia enterocolitica isolates from 50 dogs, 2 Yersinia frederiksenii isolates from 2 dogs, 5 Yersinia intermedia isolates from 5 dogs, and 16 Yersinia pseudotuberculosis isolates from 16 dogs. Fifteen of 70 Y. enterocolitica isolates belonged to biotype 4 serotype O 3 <b>phagotype</b> 8 (6 isolates), biotype 4 (maltose negative) serotype O 3 <b>phagotype</b> 8 (4 isolates), biotype 3 (Voges-Proskauer and sorbose negative) serotype O 3 <b>phagotype</b> 9 (2 isolates), and biotype 2 serotype O 5. 27 (3 isolates). The other 55 Y. enterocolitica isolates belonged to biotype 1 and were classified into serotypes O 4, O 5, O 7. 8, O 9, O 10, O 12, O 13. 7, O 14, O 15, and untypable. Sixteen Y. pseudotuberculosis isolates belonged to serotypes IB (two), IIB (two), IVA (two), IVB (three), VA (five), and untypable (two). These isolates were mostly detected in cold months. Y. enterocolitica serotype O 3 and Y. pseudotuberculosis were isolated more frequently from puppies. Y. enterocolitica serotype O 3 was recovered {{at less than}} 10 (7. 0) cells per g of the jejunal-to-rectal contents and at less than 10 (2) cells per g of mesenteric lymph nodes. Y. pseudotuberculosis was recovered at less than 10 (4. 3) cells per g of the cecal-to-rectal contents and at less than 10 (2. 9) cells per g of mesenteric lymph nodes.

40|$|Abstract. The {{molecular}} epidemiology, antimicrobial susceptibility, {{and mechanisms}} of resistance of 34 Salmonella spp. strains causing acute gastroenteritis, isolated from different provinces in Cuba, were determined. Sixty-four {{percent of the}} strains showed multiresistance. Salmonella typhimurium was the most frequent with 15 strains (44 %), 13 of which belonged to <b>phagotype</b> 104 and presented similar genetic profiles of pulsed field gel electrophoresis. High levels of resistance to tetracycline (53 %), spectinomycin (50 %), ampicillin (44 %), and chloramphenicol (41 %) were found. Resistance to tetracycline {{was associated with the}} tet G and tet A genes. Resistance to ampicillin was caused by the presence of -lactamases, mainly the CARB type. The floR gene was the main mechanism of resistance to chloram-phenicol. Our results showed an antimicrobial susceptible clone of Salmonella enterica serotype Agona in two separate regions. This is the first report of the widespread dissemination of a multiresistant clone of S. enterica serotype Typhi-murium definitive phage type 104 in Cuba...|$|E

40|$|Today, Salmonella enterica {{subspecies}} enterica serovar Enteritidis (S. Enteritidis) {{represents one}} of the most common serotypes that causes enterocolitis. Since S. enteritidis identification methods are advanced permanently, the following phenotyping methods could be applied for this purpose: biotyping, <b>phagotyping</b> (phage typing – PT), and resistotyping. From methods for genotyping of S. Enteritidis, plasmid profile analysis (PP), restriction analysis of the virulence plasmid, ribotyping, pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), insertion sequences, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), random amplified polymorphic DNA analysis (RAPD) could be applied. On the one hand, S. Enteritidis expresses clearly homogenous structure which is reflected by domination of few <b>phagotypes,</b> presence of one plasmid profile in most of strains, merely three clonal lines, as well as a large number of electrophoretic types in a single dendrogram line. Insufficient discrimination of typing systems of S. Enteritidis suggests the introduction of new typing methods as well as improvement of the old ones...|$|R
40|$|Background: Salmonella enteritidis (SE) is a {{frequent}} cause of diarrhea, and is transmitted mainly by SE contaminated eggs or poultry meat. The frequency of SE contaminated eggs or chicken meat and the risk for acquiring this pathogen is unknown in Chile. Aim: To measure SE contamination in eggs poultry meat and entrails offered in retail markets in the Metropolitan Area during two consecutive years (1998 - 1999). Material and methods: Samples were placed in sterile bags and transported to the laboratory before 4 hours at 4 °C. Microbiologic detection was done using a standard procedure and an immunodetection assay. Results: SE was found in one of 1081 egg samples (0. 09 %). The contaminated sample was offered in a supermarket under their own commercial name. Six percent of 1154 poultry meat samples were contaminated by SE and 2. 3 % by other Salmonella serotypes. Entrails had even higher rates with 10. 2 % of 370 samples harboring SE and 2, 7 % other serotypes. Total Salmonella sp. isolates and SE isolates declined during 1999. Nine SE <b>phagotypes</b> were identified, predominating types 4 and 7. Conclusions: Eggs and other avian products are contaminated by different SE <b>phagotypes</b> and other Salmonella serotypes, implicating a risk for the consumers (Rev Méd Chile 2000; 128 : 1075 - 83) ...|$|R

40|$|Salmonella enterica is {{frequently}} associated with outbreaks of human salmonellosis, and products of avian origin, such as eggs and chicken meat, {{are the main}} vehicles of its transmission. The present study describes the occurrence of different serovars of Salmonella enterica and phagotypes of S. enterica serovar Enteritidis in eggs destined for human consumption. Four thousand eggs obtained from commercial egg laying farms and one thousand discarded hatching eggs from broiler farms, which were acquired at farmers' markets and informal shops, were analyzed. Salmonella spp. was isolated from 52. 0 % of the discarded hatching eggs, in which the predominant serovar was Enteritidis (84. 6 %), and the predominant Salmonella Enteritidis <b>phagotype</b> (PT) was PT 7 (26. 9 %). Salmonella spp. was not isolated from eggs obtained from commercial egg laying farms. The antimicrobial resistance profile showed that 23. 1 % (n = 6) of the SE strains were resistant to nalidixic acid.

40|$|In 1994 - 1996, the Republic of Moldova was {{stricken}} with {{an epidemic of}} diphtheria after > 30 years of routine diphtheria immunization and the near absence of the disease for nearly 20 years. The intensity of the epidemic gradually grew, reaching a peak in 1994 - 1995. The epidemiology of diphtheria in Moldova during this period is described along with laboratory findings and control measures. Pharyngeal diphtheria was the predominant clinical form of the disease (97 % of cases), and it most often developed in a localized form (70 %), with 20 % in the toxic form. The clinical diagnosis of diphtheria was bacteriologically confirmed in 91 % of cases: Of the cases tested for biotype, 91. 3 % were gravis, 8. 5 % were mitis, and 0. 2 % were intermedius. Of 494 toxigenic isolates from cases and carriers {{at the beginning of}} the epidemic, 47 % were nonphagotypeable strains, and 25. 7 % were <b>phagotype</b> VI strains. Aggressive population-based diphtheria control measures, a mass immunization campaign, rapid case identification, antibiotic prophylaxis and supplemental immunization of close contacts in clusters of infection, and high coverage with routine immunization rapidly controlled the epidemic within Moldova...|$|E

Foram realizados dois experimentos, distribuídos em quatro tratamentos (T) cada, com 200 e 194 ovos incubáveis das linhagens Ross e ISA Label, respectivamente. Utilizaram-se ovos não sanitizados e inoculados na casca com Salmonella Enteritidis (T 1) ou com placebo (T 2); ou inoculados no albúmen com Salmonella Enteritidis (T 3) ou com placebo (T 4). Imediatamente após a inoculação, os ovos foram incubados, e a mortalidade embrionária avaliada após 96, 432 e 528 horas. Salmonella Enteritidis inoculada na casca manteve-se viável na casca e nas membranas durante todo o período de incubação e migrou para o interior dos ovos, entretanto não afetou os parâmetros de incubação. O patógeno inoculado no albúmen determinou mortalidade embrionária tardia nas linhagens Ross, 17, 0 %, e ISA Label, 13, 0 %, e originou pintos com maior freqüência de colonização intestinal por Salmonella Enteritidis, 76, 7 % e 26, 7 % para Ross e ISA Label, respectivamente. The experimental {{infection of}} Salmonella Enteritidis <b>phagotype</b> 4 (SEpt 4) was evaluated in broilers embryos {{to verify the}} ability of penetration through eggshell {{and the effect of}} albumen inoculation considering embryo mortality, hatchability, and intestinal colonization of hatched chicks. Two trials were conducted using in four treatments each, totaling 200 and 194 fertile eggs of Ross and ISA Label lineages, respectively. Non-sanitized eggs were inoculated on the shell with Salmonella Enteritidis (Treatment 1) or placebo (Treatment 2); and eggs were inoculated in albumen with Salmonella Enteritidis (Treatment 3) or placebo (Treatment 4). Immediately after inoculation, the eggs were incubated and embryo mortality was evaluated after 96, 432, and 528 hours. The results showed that Salmonella Enteritidis inoculated on egg shell remained active there and in shell membranes during all incubation period and migrated to the interior of the eggs; however, it did not affect the incubation parameters. It was observed that Salmonella Enteritidis inoculated in albumen caused late embryo mortality in Ross (17. 0 %) and ISA Label (13. 0 %) lineages, and originated chicks with high frequency of intestinal colonization by Salmonella Enteritidis, being 76. 7 % and 26. 7 % for Ross and ISA Label, respectively...|$|E
40|$|The work {{is aimed}} at {{studying}} the morphology and physico-chemical parameters of the phages, isolated from the typical strains of Bacillus thuringiensis. Established has been the lysogenicity of 11 phages, not investigated earlier. All phages have been related to BI-morphotype, by the ultrastructure to the two subgroups. The phages with the lateral discs on the tail appendix have been isolated. On {{the base of the}} morphology and restriction analysis, the phages have been divided into five groups. The DNA of the phages of each group form the equal number of proteins with the same molecular masses. The genomes of the phages code from 4 to 8 proteins. The correlation between the morphology of the phages, the structure of genomes and the set of proteins have been detected. On the base of collection of the new phages, the diagram of the <b>phagotyping</b> has been compiled. It has been shown, that two phages overcame the immunity of the bacterium-host.

40|$|Foi demonstrada a etiologia das infecções adquiridas em hospitais da cidade de Araraquara, S. Paulo, Brasil, verificando-se o comportamento das bactérias isoladas frente a 10 antimicrobianos. A metodologia bacteriológica seguida conduziu à especiação bacteriana, com exceção do estafilococos que foi identificado através da fagotipagem. Dos 171 processos infecciosos, adquiridos nos hospitais no período de setembro de 1974 a maio de 1975, foram isolados 211 microrganismos, sendo 73, 0 % de bactérias Gram negativas e 27, 0 % de bactérias Gram positivas. Verificou-se um alto nível de resistência à maioria dos antibióticos. As bactérias Gram negativas apresentaram menor resistência à Gentamicina (22, 2 %), enquanto as Gram positivas apresentaram menor resistência à Cefalotina (17, 7 %), à Fosfomicina (25, 5 %) e à Gentamicina (29, 4 %). Os resultados permitiram antever sérias dificuldades quanto à ação dos antimicrobianos sobre as bactérias, assim como a intensa disseminação das bactérias Gram negativas, especialmente a Escherichia coli e as Pseudomonas. The ethiology of the infections {{acquired}} in the City Hospitals and the behaviour of isolated bacteria by means of ten (10) antimicrobians, were demonstrated. The bacteriologic methodology was followed which conducted to the identification only of the bacterian species, except Stafilococci that were individualized through <b>phagotyping.</b> A hundred and seventy one (171) infectious processes in hospitals were collected from September, 1974 to May, 1975 from these processes, two hundred and eleven (211) microorganisms were isolated, 72. 99 % being Gram negative and 27. 05 % Gram positive. A high level of antibiotic resistence was verified. The Gram negative bacteria presented smaller resistence to Gentamicine and the Gram positive, a better sensibility to Cefalotine, Fosfomicine and Gentamicine. An analysis of the results allows us to foresee serious difficulties as regards the action of antimicrobians on bacteria, and also the intense spread of Gram negative bacteria, specially Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas...|$|R
