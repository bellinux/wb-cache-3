50|$|The <b>photoelastic</b> method {{relies on}} the fact that some {{materials}} exhibit birefringence on the application of stress, and the magnitude of the refractive indices at each point in the material {{is directly related to the}} state of stress at that point.

50|$|For {{materials}} {{that do not}} show <b>photoelastic</b> behavior, {{it is still possible}} to study the stress distribution. The first step is to build a model, using <b>photoelastic</b> materials, which has geometry similar to the real structure under investigation.

50|$|The <b>photoelastic</b> {{phenomenon}} {{was first}} {{described by the}} Scottish physicist David Brewster.Experimental frameworks were developed {{at the beginning of}} the twentieth century with the works of E. G. Coker and L. N. G. Filon of University of London. Their book Treatise on Photoelasticity, published in 1930 by Cambridge Press, became a standard text on the subject. Between 1930 and 1940, many other books appeared on the subject, including books in Russian, German and French. At the same time, much development occurred in the field - great improvements were achieved in technique, and the equipment was simplified. With refinements in the technology, <b>photoelastic</b> experiments were extended to determining three-dimensional states of stress. Many practical problems were solved using photoelasticity, and it soon became widely used. A number of <b>photoelastic</b> laboratories were established at educational institutions and in industry.|$|E
50|$|The {{principle}} of operation of <b>photoelastic</b> modulators {{is based on}} the <b>photoelastic</b> effect, in which a mechanically stressed sample exhibits birefringence proportional to the resulting strain. <b>Photoelastic</b> modulators are resonant devices where the precise oscillation frequency is determined by the properties of the optical element/transducer assembly. The transducer is tuned to the resonance frequency of the optical element along its long dimension, determined by its length and the speed of sound in the material. A current is then sent through the transducer to vibrate the optical element through stretching and compressing which changes the birefringence of the transparent material. Because of this resonant character, the birefringence of the optical element can be modulated to large amplitudes, but also by the same reason, the operation of a PEM is limited to a single frequency, and most commercial devices manufactured today operate at about 50 kHz.|$|E

5000|$|Most {{noted for}} his {{contributions}} {{to the field of}} optics, he studied the double refraction by compression and discovered the <b>photoelastic</b> effect, which gave birth to the field of optical mineralogy.

From either definition, it is clear that deformations to the body may induce optical anisotropy, which can cause an otherwise optically isotropic material to exhibit birefringence.|$|E
5000|$|PEM {{was first}} invented by J. Badoz in the 1960s and {{originally}} called a [...] "birefringence modulator." [...] It was initially developed for physical measurements including optical rotary dispersion and Faraday rotation, polarimetry of astronomical objects, strain-induced birefringence, and ellipsometry. Later developers of the <b>photoelastic</b> modulator include J.C Kemp, S.N Jasperson and S.E Schnatterly.|$|E
50|$|The {{basic design}} of a <b>photoelastic</b> {{modulator}} consists of a piezoelectric transducer and a half wave resonant bar; the bar being a transparent material (now most commonly fused silica). The transducer is tuned to the natural frequency of the bar. This resonance modulation results in highly sensitive polarization measurements. The fundamental vibration of the optic is along its longest dimension.|$|E
50|$|After {{acoustic}} reflection {{from the}} film-substrate interface, the strain pulse {{returns to the}} film surface, {{where it can be}} detected by a delayed optical probe pulse through optical reflectance or (for films that are thin enough) transmittance changes. This time-resolved method for generation and <b>photoelastic</b> detection of coherent picosecond acoustic phonon pulses was proposed by Christian Thomsen and coworkers in a collaboration between Brown University and Bell Laboratories in 1984.|$|E
50|$|Photoelasticity {{describes}} {{changes in}} the optical properties of a material under mechanical deformation. It is a property of all dielectric media and {{is often used to}} experimentally determine the stress distribution in a material, where it gives a picture of stress distributions around discontinuities in materials. <b>Photoelastic</b> experiments are an important tool for determining critical stress points in a material, and are used for determining stress concentration in irregular geometries.|$|E

5000|$|When a ray {{of light}} passes through a <b>photoelastic</b> material, its {{electromagnetic}} wave components are resolved along the two principal stress directions and each component experiences a different refractive index due to the birefringence. The difference in the refractive indices leads to a relative phase retardation between the two components. Assuming a thin specimen made of isotropic materials, where two-dimensional photoelasticity is applicable, {{the magnitude of the}} relative retardation is given by the stress-optic law: ...|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} detection mechanism used in picosecond ultrasonics {{is based}} on the <b>photoelastic</b> effect. The refractive index and extinction coefficient near the surface of the solid are perturbed by the returning strain pulses (within the optical absorption depth of the probe light), resulting in changes in the optical reflectance or transmission. The measured temporal echo shape results from a spatial integral involving both the probe light optical absorption profile and the strain pulse spatial profile (see below).|$|E
50|$|A son of {{the famous}} {{mathematician}} Vito Volterra, Enrico Volterra received in 1928 his degree in civil engineering from the Sapienza University of Rome and, in the same year, his professional qualification (abilitazione) in bridges and roads from the Polytechnic School of Engineering in Naples. He became in Rome an academic assistant to the Chair of Marine Construction and then in Paris a researcher in <b>photoelastic</b> methods at the École Nationale des Ponts et Chausées, before returning in Rome to start work as a civil engineer.|$|E
50|$|The {{experimental}} procedure {{relies on}} the property of birefringence, as exhibited by certain transparent materials. Birefringence is a phenomenon in which a ray of light passing through a given material experiences two refractive indices. The property of birefringence (or double refraction) is observed in many optical crystals. Upon the application of stresses, <b>photoelastic</b> materials exhibit the property of birefringence, and {{the magnitude of the}} refractive indices at each point in the material {{is directly related to the}} state of stresses at that point. Information such as maximum shear stress and its orientation are available by analyzing the birefringence with an instrument called a polariscope.|$|E

50|$|If {{the signal}} is either slowly varying or {{otherwise}} constant (essentially a DC signal), then 1/f noise typically overwhelms the signal. It may then {{be necessary to}} use external means to modulate the signal. For example, when detecting a small light signal against a bright background, the signal can be modulated either by a chopper wheel, acousto-optical modulator, <b>photoelastic</b> modulator at a large enough frequency so that 1/f noise drops off significantly, and the lock-in amplifier is referenced to the operating frequency of the modulator. In {{the case of an}} atomic-force microscope, to achieve nanometer and piconewton resolution, the cantilever position is modulated at a high frequency, to which the lock-in amplifier is again referenced.|$|E
5000|$|Photoelasticity can {{successfully}} {{be used to}} investigate the highly localized stress state within masonry [...] or in proximity of a rigid line inclusion (stiffener) embedded in an elastic medium. In the former case, the problem is nonlinear due to the contacts between bricks, while {{in the latter case}} the elastic solution is singular, so that numerical methods may fail to provide correct results. These can be obtained through <b>photoelastic</b> techniques. Dynamic photoelasticity integrated with high-speed photography is utilized to investigate fracture behavior in materials.Another important application of the photoelasticity experiments is to study the stress field around bi-material notches. Bi-material notches exist in many engineering application like welded or adhesively bonded structures ...|$|E
5000|$|A heating due to Ohmic losses {{may also}} induce {{mechanical}} stress via thermal expansion. This changes the birefringence of the optical element {{according to the}} <b>photoelastic</b> effect and hence may influence the optical behavior.

The equations governing linear elasticity follow from the minimum principle for the elastic energysubject to fixed or free displacement boundary conditions. The quantities are the stiffness tensor , the linear strain , the prescribed initial strain , the displacement [...] (due to thermal expansion), and the prescribed force [...] The linear strain [...] relates to the displacement [...] by [...] The computed strain {{can be used as}} an input to optical computations to account for the stress dependence of the refractive index.

5000|$|While {{the team}} found {{evidence}} of trials of <b>photoelastic</b> lacquers for stress tests, it proved impossible to interview any of the laboratory staff to learn more. (Fedden considered the LFA Engine Department lacking in modern equipment, but the LFA complex possessed a better altitude test bed installation than any in Britain; a better example still would be seen at BMW's Munich facility.) [...] The turbojet engine research artifacts found included examples of turbine and stator blade forms, blade cooling, blade construction (including hollow and ceramic types), piston cooling, and other matters. While at Völkenrode, the Americans stole equipment from under the noses of the British (including an interferometer), {{only to have the}} thefts denied when confronted by Britain at Potsdam. The Fedden Mission spent two days at Völkenrode, its sub-team returning ten days later.|$|E
5000|$|This {{signal is}} often {{presented}} {{as a function of}} wavelength λ, temperature T or magnetic field H. MCD spectrometers can simultaneously measure absorbance and ΔA along the same light path. This eliminates error introduced through multiple measurements or different instruments that previously occurred before this advent.The MCD spectrometer example shown below begins with a light source that emits a monochromatic wave of light. This wave is passed through a Rochon prism linear polarizer, which separates the incident wave into two beams that are linearly polarized by 90 degrees. The two beams follow different paths- one beam (the extraordinary beam) traveling directly to a photomultiplier (PMT), and the other beam (the ordinary beam) passing through a <b>photoelastic</b> modulator (PEM) oriented at 45 degrees to the direction of the ordinary ray polarization. The PMT for the extraordinary beam detects the light intensity of the input beam. The PEM is adjusted to cause an alternating plus and minus 1/4 wavelength shift of one of the two orthogonal components of the ordinary beam. This modulation converts the linearly polarized light into circularly polarized light at the peaks of the modulation cycle. Linearly polarized light can be decomposed into two circular components with intensity represented as ...|$|E
50|$|Working {{further on}} the Raman Effect, Krishnan {{discovered}} the reciprocity {{relations between the}} intensity of the horizontally polarised incident light getting scattered with horizontal polarization irrespective of the colloidal particles. This is known as Krishnan (reciprocity) Effect and the article was published in IISc journal on recommendation from C. V. Raman in 1936. He is credited with researches on Second Order Raman Spectra in diamond and in alkali halide crystals and is reported to have successfully recorded the phenomena for the first time, using the ultraviolet (mercury 2536 Å) technique of excitation for Raman spectroscopy, a technique he developed, on which he published a number of articles in peer reviewed journals. This is known to have provided conformation of Born's lattice dynamical theory. He was the first scientist to perform Brillouin scattering experiments in diamond, crystalline and fused quartz, alumina and alkali halides {{and is the author of}} a theory on Brillouin scattering in cubic and birefringent crystals, along with his student, Chandrasekhar. He also had documented investigations on thermal expansion, elastic constants and <b>photoelastic</b> constants of crystals and he initiated efforts on dating of Indian rock formations using nuclear geochronological techniques. He was the author of a monograph, two volumes of 'Source Book on Raman Effect' and contributed chapters to several scientific texts, besides delivering several orations.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the late}} eighties, Rosakis {{introduced}} {{the concept of}} [...] "laboratory earthquakes" [...] and since then his research interests have mainly focused on the mechanics of seismology, the physics of dynamic shear rupture and frictional sliding and on laboratory seismology. The goal of this body of work is to create, in a controlled and repeatable environment, surrogate laboratory earthquake scenarios mimicking various dynamic shear rupture process occurring in natural earthquake events. Such, highly instrumented, experiments are used to observe new physical phenomena and to also create benchmark comparisons with existing analysis and field observations. The experiments use high-speed photography, full-field photoelasticity, and laser velocimetry as diagnostics. The fault systems are simulated using two <b>photoelastic</b> plates held together in frictional contact. The far field tectonic loading is simulated by pre-compression while the triggering of dynamic rupture (spontaneous nucleation) is achieved by suddenly dropping the normal stress in a small region along the interface. The frictional interface (fault) forms various angles with the compression axis to provide the shear driving force necessary for continued rupturing. Rosakis and his co-workers, investigate the characteristics of rupture, such as rupture speed, rupture mode, associated ground motion under various conditions such as tectonic load, interface complexity and roughness. Both homogeneous and bimaterial interfaces (abutted by various elastic and damaged media) are investigated. Rosakis and his coworkers have been credited with the experimental discovery of the [...] "intersonic" [...] or [...] "supershear rupture" [...] phenomenon. They also have investigated this new phenomenon in various engineering and geophysical settings involving shear dominated rupture {{in the presence of}} weak interfaces or faults. Their experimental discoveries of supershear rupture has refocused the attention of the geophysics community to the study of supershear earthquakes.|$|E
