50|$|The Subcommittee is {{satisfied}} after {{consideration of the}} available evidence that hypnotism is of value and may be the treatment of choice in some cases of so-called <b>psycho-somatic</b> <b>disorder</b> and Psychoneurosis. It may also be of value for revealing unrecognized motives and conflicts in such conditions. As a treatment, {{in the opinion of}} the Subcommittee it has proved its ability to remove symptoms and to alter morbid habits of thought and behavior...In addition to the treatment of psychiatric disabilities, there is a place for hypnotism in the production of anesthesia or analgesia for surgical and dental operations, and in suitable subjects it is an effective method of relieving pain in childbirth without altering the normal course of labor.|$|E
40|$|Presented {{the case}} of an 11 -year-old boy with vocal-cord {{dysfunction}} (VCD) {{as an example of a}} rare clinical phenomenon that may result in clinical and systemic challenges for the pediatric psychologist. VCD presents as highly similar to asthma, yet is best treated with speech therapy and psychosocial intervention. The physical symptomatology of VCD and its conceptualization as a <b>psycho-somatic</b> <b>disorder</b> are described. Difficulties inherent in integrating psychological factors into medical case formulation are discussed, and possible pitfalls and strategies are delineated. KEY WORDS: vocal-cord dysfunction; asthma; consultation-liaison; case study. Patients whose symptoms are unresponsive to conventional medical approaches provide a great challenge for medical and psychosocial care providers. Initially, the treatment team may exhaust the realm of potential underlying or comorbid medical conditions by ordering multiple consultations and auxiliary evaluations. If these fail to clarify the disease picture, the medical care providers may consid-er the possibilities of nonadherence to medication regimens, malingering, or deliberate induction of symptoms as potential explanations for the clinical pre-sentation. How staff address these concerns within the team and with the family can have a pivotal impact on treatment alliance and subsequent patient care. 'All correspondence should be sent to Elizabeth L. McQuaid, Child and Family Psychiatry, Rhod...|$|E
40|$|The {{distinct}} {{division of}} clinical symptoms {{into what is}} somatic and what is psychological in human sciences, {{has its roots in}} Cartesian thinking which may have been given a lopsided emphasis. This essay argues against this strict division, using examples and data mainly referring to gastrointestinal functional somatic syndromes (<b>psycho-somatic</b> <b>disorders).</b> The effects of context and also of psychotropic agents on this interaction between psyche and soma is discussed...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Depression is a {{well defined}} mood {{disorder}} which is characterized by state of disposition of mind and dislike or antipathy to activity that can affect an individualâ€Ÿs thoughts, demeanor, sense of emotional touch and physical well- being. Depressed people may feel mournful, troubled, uneasy in mind, meaningless, helpless and unworthy, experiencing as if having committed an offence. They are easily annoyed and disinclined to rest. It {{is a very important}} public health problem which is devastating millions of life all over world and making the scenario very pathetic. Number of the patients is suffering with <b>psycho-somatic</b> <b>disorders</b> where placebo and psycho therapies work well. Efficacy of placebo on depression due to vague reasons and with vague symptoms is significant and wonderful. It comes through exchange of belief and trust between patient and physician. Placebo response can be vividly observed and measured. Therefore, by applying placebo therapy in genuine cases of aforesaid type of depression, one can be saved from side effects of drugs and un-necessary expenditure as well...|$|R
40|$|Starting {{from the}} {{statement}} that in {{the onset of the}} <b>psycho-somatic</b> <b>disorders</b> an important role is played by psychological factors and the personality of the patient together with cardiovascular risk factors, we believe {{that it is important to}} highlight and correlate all the possible aspects. Aim: The objectives of the study are to stress the differences in the structure of personality between the patients with arterial hypertension (AHT) and depression and the ones diagnosed only with depression syndrome. Material and methods: the 200 patients studied were divided in two groups: 100 patients with depression and 100 with depression + AHT. Results: After processing the data obtained by anamnesis and questionnaires focused on the individual characteristics of the patients, we observed that the group diagnosed with depression and AHT has a significantly increased level in dynamism, domination, perseverance and meticulosity while the group with depression has a significantly increased level of cooperation, amiability and openness for culture. Conclusions: There are important differences between the two study groups regarding their personality traits...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Cardiac {{diseases}} are <b>psycho-somatic</b> <b>disorders,</b> and psychological aspects play {{an essential role}} in their initiation and exacerbation. The aim {{of this study was to}} gain appropriate knowledge in the epidemiology of co-morbid depression and anxiety disorder in cardiovascular outpatients. Method: This study is descriptive with a sample of patients attending a cardio-vascular clinic. 238 individuals were included in this study using a consecutive sampling method. The study instrument was Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) questionnaire, which is a clinical scale for assessing anxiety and depression. Results: Of the 238 participants in this study, 93 (38. 7 %) were male and 146 (61. 3 %) female. 28. 5 % of patients suffered from anxiety disorders, and 41. 9 % had depression. Regarding comorbid diseases such as diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia and hypertension, the severity of depression was just related to hypertension. There was a meaningful relationship between gender and symptoms of anxiety so that symptoms were more severe in women. Conclusion: Considering the high prevalence of depression and anxiety in patients suffering from cardio-vascular diseases, it is necessary to screen psychological disorders in patients with cardio-vascular diseases and improve their cardio-vascular health and quality of life as mush as possible...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Emotions {{represent}} {{reactions of}} living organisms to changes of one's inner sphere, {{as well as}} to different factors from our surroundings. Emotions manifest in many ways. Failing to fulfill one's needs on chronic or acute basis leads to conflict situations. These needs may be either biological or social. Conflict situations occur prior to stress itself. Emotional stress Modern technology development provides no friendly environment for workers, with many consequences causing <b>psycho-somatic</b> <b>disorders.</b> Researches have been made to evaluate the amount of inflicted stress on patients. One of successful theories regarding this question is the theory of functional systems. The idea was to quantify processes of everyday living. Prophylaxis and rehabilitation of persons exposed to emotional stress The primary goal was to measure one's adaptation abilities. In order to follow up these parameters a machine was created. This appliance can determine the level of stress, by measuring certain physiological parameters. That is way scientists may apply preventive measures in order to increase stress resistance. Conclusion We differ hereditary and individual resistance to stress factors. That is why it is necessary to assess each patient individually. This type of individual approach offers an opportunity to create a specific program, in order to increase stress resistance...|$|R
