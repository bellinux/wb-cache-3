40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to {{evaluate}} the potential for enhancing {{the performance of the}} once-through PWR fuel cycle by appropriate design of thorium containing fuel with concurrent consideration of neutronics, thermal-hydraulics, and proliferation resistance. CASMO- 4 is employed to model a fuel assembly consisting of a homogeneously fueled ThO 2 -UO 2 lattice of conventional design. It is found that homogeneously mixed ThO 2 -UO 2 fuel in general has better physics behavior than all-UO 2 fuel, e. g. more negative MTC and less reactivity swing. The H/HM ratio can be optimized to extend the burnup of both ThO 2 -UO 2 and all-UO 2 fuel about 10 % and 5 % respectively. However, it is found that the all-UO 2 fuel provides higher potential energy generation (or achievable burnup) than the homogeneously mixed ThO 2 -UO 2 fuel. MOCUP (MCNP+ORIGEN) is used to model unit cells of the micro-heterogeneous fuel. The key findings for the best micro-heterogeneous configurations are as follows: (1) For a given U- 235 inventory, a 20 % to 30 % increase in fuel cycle achievable bumup above the homogeneous case is possible, therefore 10 % to 15 % above the all-UO 2 fuel; (2) For certain axially heterogeneous configurations, a "burnable poison" reactivity suppression effect appears at the beginning of irradiation. Analysis of the possible mechanisms behind these effects shows that they are due to a combination of changes in self-shielding, local fissile worth, and conversion ratio. (cont.) Economic evaluations show that the homogeneous ThO 2 -UO 2 fuel is 20 %- 30 % more expensive than the equivalent all-U fuel but micro-heterogeneous fuel can be comparable to or even cheaper than the all-UO 2 fuel. In terms of the plutonium content, the micro-heterogeneous Th/U fuel is more <b>proliferation-resistant</b> than the homogeneous Th/U fuel, and the homogeneous Th/U fuel is more <b>proliferation-resistant</b> than the all-UO 2 fuel. However, the uranium produced in the ThO 2 zone of any undenatured micro-heterogeneous design should be considered of proliferative concern. Adding natural or depleted uranium to the ThO 2 zone can make the material not weapon-usable at the expense of degrading the neutronic performance. Placing some enriched uranium within the thorium zone may be needed to reduce local thermal peaking to a manageable level. by Xiaofeng Zhao. Thesis (Ph. D.)
