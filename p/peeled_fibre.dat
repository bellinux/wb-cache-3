The concentration of antioxidant [AA 50] required to achieve a 50 % inhibition of oxidation of linoleic acid at 40 °C was measured using the ferric-thiocyanate method. The higher the [AA 50], the lower the antioxidant capacity. Lime <b>peel</b> <b>fibre</b> [AA 50] was half the value of DL-α-tocopherol and 23 times lower than orange peel fibre; the [AA 50] of commercial butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) was half the value of lime fibre.

Comparatively to lime, ambarella and mango fibres were prepared from their corresponding peels using ethanolic treatment (85 % at 70 A degrees C/ 5 min). The peels were characterised for their dry matter content, pH and apparent viscosity. The soluble dietary fibre (SDF) and insoluble dietary fibre (IDF) contents of the samples were determined. Hydration capacity of these fibres was evaluated. Results showed that the ethanolic treatment of the peels (85 % at 70 A degrees C/ 5 min) had significant (p < 0. 05) effects on the contents of neutral sugars and uronic acid (from 105 to even 203 mg/g in case of mango fibre). For ambarella fibres, the proportion of IDF (51 %) was highest and that of SDF (34 %) was lowest. Mango and lime fibres exhibited similar values of IDF (40 - 43 %) and SDF (50 - 57 %).

Pineapple <b>peel</b> <b>fibres</b> (PAPF) have good potential as reinforcement in thermoplastic composite. It is {{the objective of the}} current research to develop a new formulation of PAPF biodegradable reinforced high density polyethylene as the material. Both HDPE and PAPF were compounded using extruder machine and then prepared for tensile test (ASTM D 638), flexural test (ASTM D 790) and impact test (ASTM D 256) by using injection moulding machine. The PAPF/HDPE composites were characterized using Melt Flow Index (MFI), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Fourier Transform Infra-Red (FTIR). MFI values of PAPF/HDPE composites decreased as the content of PAPF increased. SEM analysis clarified that the structure of 30 wt % PAPF/HDPE has fewer voids introduced by fibre pull out. FTIR results showed that O-H peak become broader with the increment of the fibre loading. As the PAPF loading in HDPE increased in term of wt%, the Youngâ€™s Modulus increased with fibre loading at the beginning and experienced optimum raise at 30 wt % of fibre loading. Conversely, it is found that the tensile strength declined as the fibre concentration in composite increased. It was also observed that the flexural modulus and strength of PAPF reinforced HDPE composite increased linearly with increment of fibre loadings. This trend was different for impact strength where it decreased as the fibre loading increased. The study concluded that the optimum fibre loading for the best performance of the composite is at 30 wt% fibre loading...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{describes}} {{an analysis of}} the parameters that influence the adherence properties between flaxfibres and PLLA. Microdroplet debonding tests have been used, together with Atomic Force and Scanning Electron Microscopy. The apparent interfacial shear strength of flax/PLLA is significantly higher than that of glass/PP and similar to that of glass/unsaturated polyester. Comparison of results for glass fibres and flax with and without release agent indicate a large contribution of thermal residual stresses to interface properties. The multi-layer nature of vegetal fibres affects debonding mechanisms and partial <b>peeling</b> of the <b>fibre</b> is noted. The cohesion of the fibre cell-wall must therefore also be considered. Awatertreatment of flaxfibres (72 h at 23 °C) is shown to result in a small drop in tensile properties but a significant increase in interfacial shear strength and friction stress.

40|$|Abstract The {{objective}} of this thesis was to obtain new information about mechanisms of thermomechanical pulp refining in the inner area of a refiner disc gap by studying inter-fibre refining and by calculating the distribution of energy consumption in the refiner disc gap. The energy consumption of thermomechanical pulping process is very high although theoretically {{a small amount of}} energy is needed to create new fibre surfaces. Mechanisms of refining have been widely studied {{in order to understand the}} high energy consumption of the process, however, phenomena in the inner area of disc gap has had less attention. It is likely that this important position is causing high energy consumption due to the high residence time of pulp located there. The power distribution as a function of the refiner disc gap was calculated in this work. The calculation was based on mass and energy balances, as well as temperature and consistency profiles determined by mill trials. The power distribution was found to be dependent on segment geometry and the refining stage. However, in the first stage refiner with standard refiner segments, a notable amount of power was consumed in the inner area of the disc gap. Fibre-to-fibre refining is likely to be the most important mechanism in the inner area of disc gap from the point of view of energy consumption. In this work the inter-fibre refining was studied using equipment for shear and compression. Fibre-to-fibre refining was found to be an effective way to refine fibres from coarse pulp to separated, fibrillated and <b>peeled</b> <b>fibres</b> if frictional forces inside the compressed pulp were high enough. It was proposed that high energy of today’s thermomechanical pulping process could derive from too low frictional forces that heated pulp and evaporated water without any changes in fibre structure. The method to calculate power distribution and results of fibre-to-fibre refining experiments may give ideas for developing today’s thermomechanical pulp refiners’ or for developing totally new energy saving mechanical pulping processes...|$|R

The chemical treatment led to degradation of lignin and hemicelluloses, significantly influencing the cell wall assembly and structure. The cell wall polymers of mechanically isolated fibres remained in their natural constitution. As expected, the peeling process caused separation of cell wall layers. Our examinations indicate that delamination predominately took place at the interface between the secondary cell wall and the compound middle lamella. However, fracture between the S 1 and S 2 layers was examined as well.

40|$|A {{significant}} {{recent development}} in the composite field is the appearance of biocomposites (biopolymers reinforced by plant fibres) which combine mechanical performance and low environmental impacts. However, to replace conventional composites a significant effort is needed to understand their mechanical behaviour under complex loading (both in-plane and out-of-plane). The interfacial behaviour (fibre/matrix) of these materials also requires particular attention in order to optimize mechanical properties. With this aim modified Arcan, transverse tension and microdroplet debonding tests have been performed on flax reinforced PLLA biocomposites, as very few data of this type are available. The out-of-plane tensile and tensile-shear properties of these biocomposites are lower than those measured in shear.

40|$|The {{process of}} retting (the {{dissociation}} of the fibre bundles {{from the central}} stele {{by the action of}} microbes) in two varieties of flax (Linum usitatissimum; cvs. Laura and Escalina) was investigated by studying the morphology and mechanics of plants after treatment with a translocated herbicide, glyphosate. The mechanical changes in the stems were measured on a weekly basis, by carrying out a series of mechanical peel and tear tests on the stem tissue of mature plants. There was a pronounced drop in the moisture content of the stem 14 days after application of the herbicide, from a moisture content of ~ 60 to 10 %. This was consistent with the onset of senescence and subsequent dehydration of the plant tissues. The dehydration of the stem tissues corresponded with an increase in the work required to <b>peel</b> the <b>fibre</b> bundles from the secondary phloem tissue, from 212 ± 7. 9 to 539 ± 22 J m− 2 (P< 0. 001). However, 27 days after application of the herbicide there was a more gradual but significant drop in the work required to peel the stem, by ~ 45 % to a mean work to peel of 297 ± 19. 8 J m− 2. This is thought to be a result of the retting process.

To manufacture blades in a vacuum-assisted resin infusion process (VARI), a binder {{is needed for}} fibre fixation and preform stability. Moreover, solubility and mechanical compatibility of the binder and the epoxy resin matrix are important parameters for processa-bility and the mechanical properties of the composite. The present study therefore character-ised and evaluated five chemically different binders {{with regard to their}} solubility in a rotor-blade-proven epoxy resin using microscopy, viscometry and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The solubility tests enabled a binder-classification into critically soluble (KE- 60, Epikote 05390), strongly soluble (Grilon MS), partially soluble (D 2433 E), and non-soluble (K- 140) binder types. In subsequent mechanical and thermo-mechanical testing of resin-binder plates, the strongly soluble binder Grilon MS showed the best performance, followed by the non-soluble binder K- 140 and the partially soluble binder D 2433 E. These results suggest that binders developing no interfaces within the resin should be preferred. Furthermore, interply adhesion for these three binders was investigated in a <b>peeling</b> test using <b>fibre</b> preforms.

The polysaccharide was characterized by NMR and subjected to partial degradation protocols, including chemical and enzymatic approaches. The oligosaccharide fragments obtained were fractionated by gel permeation chromatography and analyzed for their molecular mass with MALDI-TOF MS. The obtained data show that this flax galactan is a complex RG-I polysaccharide with variable side chain structures. The backbone is composed of the common GalA-Rha repeats {{with a high degree}} of branching. These side chains are mainly composed of ß- 1, 4 -linked Gal oligomers: (1) short branches of only one or two Gal residue(s); (2) long (linear) branches of up to 26 Gal residues; (3) mixed branches of between 3 and 12 Gal residues (possibly derived from longer linear side chains), that are resistant to galactanase cleavage; (4) side chains of at least 17 Gal residues, decorated with single Ara moieties. The linkage between RG backbone and galactan side chains was confirmed by the presence of fragments with (Rha-GalA) nHexm structure type. Neither chemical, nor enzymatic hydrolysis yielded oligomeric GalA residues, indicating that RG-I blocks are not interrupted by HGA regions. The polymer can be cleaved only partially by the rhamnogalacturonan hydrolase used, while the remaining part is resistant, probably due to peculiarities of side chain structure. Novel Rha-GalA oligomers were liberated by RG-hydrolase containing two or three Gal attached to Rha near the cleavage site.

These materials were used as pulp for paper production industries to promote the concept “from waste to wealth” and “recyclable material to available product” for reducing the environmental issues. In order to maximize the utilization of non-wood fibres for pulp and paper production, a more complete understanding of its chemistry is required. In this context, the main objective of this work is to improve and investigate the chemical composition of different material fibers used for pulp and papermaking.

The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to visualize the surface morphological of materials. In order to propose the suitability of the studied plant as alternative fibre resources in pulp and paper making, the obtained result is compared to other literatures especially wood sources. Results indicated the amount of holocellulose contents in cassava peel (66 %) is lower than wood plants.

40|$|This thesis asks two questions. First, {{is there}} an efferent control system of the {{arterial}} chemoreceptors other than by control of the vasculature? Secondly, do single chemoreceptors show an oscillation in their discharge with respiration and, if so, what is {{the natural history of}} the oscillations? The general methods for the recording of the discharge of single chemoreceptor fibres of the sinus nerve of the cat are described. Specific experimental details are described in the appropriate chapters. Efferent control Microelectrodes were used to record intracellular potentials from the carotid body in vitro and in vivo in an attempt to link efferent inhibition arising from electrical stimulation of the sinus nerve with changes in the membrane potentials of the cells. 176 cells were recorded from in vitro and 24 cells in vivo. These were probably Type I cells. Membrane potentials ranged from 15 andndash; 60 andnbsp;mV with a mean of about 30 andnbsp;mV. No 'physiological' or pharmacological stimulus that was used affected these potentials. Potassium chloride solution depolarised the cells reversibly. Stimulation of the sinus nerve at intensities sufficient for maximal excitation of the 'C' fibres within it had no effect on the recorded potentials. Neither transient junctional-type potentials nor slow drifts of potential were seen. In parallel experiments the sinus nerve was stimulated electrically whilst recording the discharge in single chemoreceptor <b>fibres</b> <b>peeled</b> from the nerve distal to the stimulating electrodes. Stimulation could cause adventitious excitation of the recorded afferent resulting in antidromic depression, which mimicked a true physiological inhibition of the discharge. Some of the features of this adventitious excitation and the ease with which it occurred were investigated using an isolated segment of vagus, baroreceptor fibres, and chemoreceptor fibres. Low concentrations of local anaesthetic could raise the threshold for adventitious excitation whilst not affecting the normal passage of impulses. When looking for true inhibition, a continuous check for adventitious excitation was kept, utilizing the fact that chemoreceptors show a minimum interspike interval of about 10 andnbsp;msec. With this check, stimulation of the sinus nerve still caused a reduction in discharge in afferent fibres, to about 70 % of control, though this was rather variable. In four out of five fibres tested, the inhibition was reduced or abolished by close intra-arterial injection of atropine. In conclusion: the true inhibition of discharge would seem not to be synaptic but vasomotor in origin. Oscillations in discharge Most single fibres of the cat and dog showed oscillations in discharge in phase with respiration when summed by computer over many respiratory cycles. The trough in the oscillation followed inspiration with a delay equal to the lung to carotid body circulation time. The amplitude of these oscillations was increased by decreasing respiratory frequencies or by increasing metabolism by poisoning with dinitrophenol. Hypercapnia or hypoxia decreased the relative amplitude of the oscillations but the absolute amplitude remained approximately constant. Oscillations from pairs of fibres recorded simultaneously were similar in phase and relative amplitude. The oscillations were not affected by sectioning or stimulating the cervical sympathetic trunk, nor by sectioning the sinus nerve whilst recording from an afferent from the otherwise intact nerve. The most likely source of the oscillation is thought to be the respiratory oscillation of P a,CO 2 in the carotid blood. It is proposed that the responses can be explained in terms of families of parallel transient P a,CO 2 -response curves that are steeper than the fans of response curves described for the steady state by other workers and cut these curves at the mean P a,CO 2. A non-sympathetic efferent fibre that was recorded from showed no oscillation in the discharge with respiration, and interval distribution histograms of its discharge did not have the simple exponential form shown by afferent discharge. Earlier workers had described the discharge of single chemoreceptors as random and this was seemingly at variance with an oscillating discharge. In an attempt to resolve this it was assumed that the mean frequency of the random process varied over the respiratory cycle, and statistical tests showed that, with this assumption, the impulses were random with respect to each other although they were not random with respect to the respiratory cycle. That is, the probability of the occurrence of an impulse varies with a respiratory periodicity but not with the time since the occurrence of the previous impulse. The technique of recording from two fibres simultaneously on separate electrodes was originally used to see if it would be justifiable to apply the results of summing the discharge of one fibre over many cycles to the response of the whole nerve, i. e. many fibres over one cycle. This recording method allowed farther comparisons between fibres, when the arterial stimulus must have been the same for both receptors, by going back over the experimental records and comparing the frequencies of discharge of the pair of fibres at any time. In some experiments specific manoeuvres were performed to obtain further information. The frequencies of discharge of fibres were compared: at steady mean rates; during the responses to various ventilatory stimuli; at the intra-arterial injection of 100 % CO 2 -saline; as well as in their oscillatory behaviour over the respiratory cycle. If allowances were made for differences in characteristic mean frequencies of discharge, the sensitivities to any change of arterial stimulus proved remarkably similar, that is the discharge of one receptor could give as much information as that of the whole population. There were indications that receptors might differ in threshold, peak response, and adaptation. The most striking finding was that the sensitivity of a receptor could change with time, although, at any one moment, the chemoreceptors are a surprisingly homogeneous population. The results suggest that there is a single mechanism responsible for the sensitivity to hypoxia and hypercapnia. </p...|$|R
