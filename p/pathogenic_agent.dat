40|$|The poultry red mite, D. gallinae {{has been}} {{involved}} in the transmission of many <b>pathogenic</b> <b>agents,</b> responsible for serious diseases both in animals and humans. Nowadays, few effective methods are available to control the ectoparasite in poultry farms.

This paper addresses the vector capacity of the ectoparasite with special emphasis on salmonellae, <b>pathogenic</b> <b>agents</b> responsible for many of the most important outbreaks of food-borne diseases worlwide. It has been experimentally shown that D. gallinae could act as a biological vector of S. enteritidis and natural carriage of these bacteria by the mite on poultry premises has also been reported. It was also found that D. gallinae carried other pathogens such as E. coli, Shigella sp., and Staphylococcus, thus increasing the list of <b>pathogenic</b> <b>agents</b> potentially transmitted by the mite...|$|R

In this context, the genetic resistance of the plants confronted with the attack of <b>pathogenic</b> <b>agents</b> is very much evolved, especially when it is correlated with a high quality and productivity.
