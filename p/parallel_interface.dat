5|$|Godbout {{also sold}} {{components}} to Processor Technology for their 4K Static RAM board and serial / <b>parallel</b> <b>interface</b> board. Lee Felsenstein designed an Altair compatible video board that provided 16 lines of 64 {{upper and lower}} case characters on {{a black and white}} television. This $160 board became very popular and led to the Processor Technology Sol-20 Computer in 1976.|$|E
5|$|The Altair 8800 kit {{came with}} a front panel, a CPU board with the Intel 8080 microprocessor, 256 bytes of RAM, a 4-slot {{backplane}} and an 8-amp power supply for $439. A 1k byte memory board was $176 and the 4k byte was $264. The serial interface board was $124 and the <b>parallel</b> <b>interface</b> was $119. There was a special price for an 8k byte system with BASIC for $995. The Teletype Model 33 ASR was $1500.|$|E
25|$|Apple {{released}} the Macintosh Plus on January 10, 1986, {{for a price}} of US$2,600. It offered one megabyte of RAM, easily expandable to four megabytes {{by the use of}} socketed RAM boards. It also featured a SCSI <b>parallel</b> <b>interface,</b> allowing up to seven peripherals—such as hard drives and scanners—to be attached to the machine. Its floppy drive was increased to an 800kB capacity. The Mac Plus was an immediate success and remained in production, unchanged, until October 15, 1990; on sale for just over four years and ten months, it was the longest-lived Macintosh in Apple's history. In September 1986, Apple introduced the Macintosh Programmer's Workshop, or MPW, an application that allowed software developers to create software for Macintosh on Macintosh, rather than cross compiling from a Lisa. In August 1987, Apple unveiled HyperCard and MultiFinder, which added cooperative multitasking to the Macintosh. Apple began bundling both with every Macintosh.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the most}} common uses of a shift {{register}} is to convert between serial and <b>parallel</b> <b>interfaces.</b> This is useful as many circuits work on groups of bits in <b>parallel,</b> but serial <b>interfaces</b> are simpler to construct. Shift registers can be used as simple delay circuits. Several bidirectional shift registers could also be connected in parallel for a hardware implementation of a stack.|$|R
40|$|Parallel {{discrete}} event simulation, cellular automata, <b>parallel</b> <b>interfaces,</b> fire modelling and simulation. In this paper, {{we study}} principles and techniques of Parallel Discrete Event Simulation {{that are used}} for the simulation of environmental complex phenomena on parallel computers. The rise of new concepts in this domain allows to develop tools {{for the study of}} such systems. Among them, the paradigm of cellular automata facilitates the building of spatial models and the integration of parallel techniques. Some <b>parallel</b> programming <b>interfaces</b> are developed to accelerate the simulation treatments and exploit the computing ressources provided by the parallel computers. The Combination of the cellular automata and the <b>parallel</b> <b>interfaces</b> makes it possible to solve the modelling and simulation problems arisen by the complex systems considered. We present the modelling tools available for the expression of the space dynamics of the complex phenomenon considered and how to extend the possibilities of the traditional models for spatial modelling and simulation...|$|R
