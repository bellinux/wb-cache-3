A homogeneous catalytic system based on water-soluble ruthenium catalysts selectively decompose HCOOH into H2 and CO2 in aqueous solution.

25|$|The {{study of}} {{materials}} at extreme conditions, high pressure and high temperature uses {{a wide array}} of techniques to achieve these conditions and probe the behavior of material while in the extreme environment. Percy Williams Bridgman, the great pioneer of high-pressure research {{during the first half of}} the 20th century, revolutionized the field of high pressures with his development of an opposed anvil device with small flat areas that were pressed one against the other with a lever-arm. The anvils were made of tungsten carbide (WC). This device could achieve pressure of a few gigapascals, and was used in electrical resistance and compressibility measurements. The principles of the DAC are similar to the Bridgman anvils but in order to achieve the highest possible pressures without breaking the anvils, they were made of the hardest known material: a single crystal diamond. The first prototypes were limited in their <b>pressure</b> <b>range</b> and there was not a reliable way to calibrate the pressure.|$|E

The existence of a hydrogen sulfide cloud layer is only possible if the ratio of sulfur and nitrogen abundances (S/N ratio) is significantly greater than its solar value of 0.16. Otherwise all hydrogen sulfide would react with ammonia, producing ammonium hydrosulfide, and the ammonia clouds would appear instead in the <b>pressure</b> <b>range</b> 3–10bar. The elevated S/N ratio implies depletion of ammonia in the <b>pressure</b> <b>range</b> 20–40bar, where the ammonium hydrosulfide clouds form.

2500|$|In 1986 Voyager 2 {{discovered}} that the visible southern hemisphere of Uranus can be subdivided into two regions: a bright polar cap and dark equatorial bands (see figure on the right).

It is called a southern [...] "collar". The cap and collar {{are thought to be}} a dense region of methane clouds located within the <b>pressure</b> <b>range</b> of 1.3 to 2bar.

So Uranus appeared to be asymmetric: bright near the south pole and uniformly dark in the region north of the southern collar. In 2007, however, when Uranus passed its equinox, the southern collar almost disappeared, whereas a faint northern collar emerged near 45 degrees of latitude. The visible latitudinal structure of Uranus is different from that of Jupiter and Saturn, which demonstrate multiple narrow and colorful bands.|$|E
