25|$|Corresponding {{with the}} attitudes of {{humanistic}} psychology, the developmental potential of the child- as in the acknowledgement of their strengths {{as well as their}} handicaps, and the importance of the therapist- child relationship are central factors in Orff music therapy. Theoretical foundations are also influenced by the strong emphasis on social integration and the involvement of parents in the therapeutic process found in social <b>paediatrics.</b> Knowledge of developmental psychology puts into perspective how developmental disabilities influence the child, as do their social and familial environments. The basis for interaction in this method is known as responsive interaction, in which the therapist meets the child at their level and responds according to their initiatives, combining both humanistic and developmental psychology philosophies. Involving the parents in this type of interaction, by having them participate directly or observe the therapist's techniques, equips the parents with ideas of how to interact appropriately with their child, thus fostering a positive parent-child relationship.|$|E

25|$|The Government of India {{had focused}} {{primarily}} on increasing the hospital-based services for gas victims thus hospitals had been built after the disaster.

25|$|Tristan (2011) by Hogan was a {{follow up}} film to Yajilarra and was {{commissioned}} by Oscar and the Lililwan Project, The George and the University of Sydney Discipline of <b>Paediatrics</b> and Child Health. The documentary {{was part of the}} campaign to support children affected by FASD. When Tristan was released, the Australian government had yet to recognise FASD as a disability. Tristan highlighted the danger in drinking alcohol in pregnancy by portraying the struggle of a 12-year old Aboriginal boy who suffered from severe FASD. The boy lived in Fitzroy Crossing, loved Australian rules football and was much like other boys his age. Hogan’s film told how Tristan struggled more than the other children in his family who were less affected by FASD, needed to have regular breaks when focusing on a task, and often needed to have instructions repeated to him. His uncle was worried the police and other authorities could easily misunderstand his inability to communicate, or comprehend the consequences of his actions. But Tristan wanted to become a policeman one day and just wanted to be ‘normal’. Tristan was shown at the 11th session of the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues in New York, from 7 to 18 May 2012. The film concluded with a message from Oscar: “The attitude of society towards FASD must change, since the children with the condition can’t”.|$|E

500|$|Conklin's fasting {{therapy was}} adopted by neurologists in {{mainstream}} practice. In 1916, a Dr McMurray wrote to the New York Medical Journal claiming to have successfully treated epilepsy patients with a fast, followed by a starch- and sugar-free diet, since 1912. In 1921, prominent endocrinologist H. Rawle Geyelin reported his experiences to the American Medical Association convention. He had seen Conklin's success first-hand and had attempted to reproduce the results in 36 of his own patients. He achieved similar results despite only having studied the patients for a short time. Further studies in the 1920s indicated that seizures generally returned after the fast. Charles Howland, the parent of one of Conklin's successful patients and a wealthy New York corporate lawyer, gave his brother John a gift of $5,000 to study [...] "the ketosis of starvation". As professor of <b>paediatrics</b> at Johns Hopkins Hospital, John Howland used the money to fund research undertaken by neurologist Stanley Cobb and his assistant William G. Lennox.|$|E
