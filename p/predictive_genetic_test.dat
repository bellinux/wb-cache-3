There is a delicate balance that presides over predictive medicine and occupational health: if an employee were dismissed because he was found to be at risk of a certain chemical agent used in his workplace, would his termination be considered discrimination or an act of prevention? Several organizations believe that legislation is needed to prevent insurers and employers from using <b>predictive</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>test</b> results to decide who gets insurance or a job: [...] "Ethical considerations, and legal, are fundamental to the whole issue of genetic testing. The consequences for individuals with regard to insurance and employment are also of the greatest importance, together with the implications for stigma and discrimination." [...] In the future, people may be required to reveal genetic predictions about their health to their employers or insurers. The grim prospect of discrimination based on a person's genetic make-up can lead to a [...] "genetic underclass" [...] which does not receive equal opportunity for insurance and employment.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to gather {{information}} from European clinical geneticists about their practices and attitudes with regard to presymptomatic and predictive genetic testing in minors. European clinical institutes where genetic counseling is offered to patients were contacted. One hundred seventy-seven of the 287 eligible respondents (63 %) answered a questionnaire. There was strongest support for testing young children when it provides a clear medical benefit, such as in the case of FAP and MEN 2 A. However, there is disagreement about when to provide predictive genetic testing for childhood-onset disorders for which therapeutic or preventive measures exist with some supporting the rule of earliest onset and others giving parents wider discretion. However, for childhood-onset disorders that do not have therapeutic measures, the majority of the respondents is unwilling to provide a presymptomatic or <b>predictive</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>test.</b> With respect to adolescents, many held a cautious position regarding presymptomatic and predictive genetic testing. Most clinical geneticists were unwilling to provide a presymptomatic or <b>predictive</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>test</b> for adult-onset diseases, except if it might provide a medical benefit. Although adolescents might be legally in the position to request a presymptomatic or <b>predictive</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>test</b> personally, the clinical geneticists are significantly more willing to provide a test if this request is made together with the minor's parents.

40|$|Genetic {{testing has}} long been part of Canada’s health system, but the scope of genetic testing is growing into new areas. Whereas {{traditional}} tests predominantly foretell the health of future generations, new tests increasingly tell individuals about their own health and risks. And whereas traditional tests have focused on rare, single-gene, genetically determined disorders, new tests target common, complex, and multifactorial diseases in which genetics plays only a part. These trends lead to unprecedented clinical and popular interest in genetic tests, and the expanded use of testing will affect both population health and health care costs. Whether the net effects will be positive or negative {{is a matter of}} heated debate. Early policy decisions about how tests will be disseminated, provided, and funded will greatly influence the cost and other impacts of new predictive genetic tests. This report examines the potential effect of new <b>predictive</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>test</b> services on health care costs.

Converting these discoveries into genetic tools would enhance efficiency of apple breeding via marker-assisted selection compared to conventional phenotype-based approaches. Developing new cultivars that produce delicious fruit in abundance is the major goal of the Washington apple breeding program. A component of this deliciousness in fruit of new cultivars would be consistent delivery of a fresh sensation after long term storage. We define apple fresh sensation as a combination of crispness, acidity, and juiciness. A location in the apple genome associated with these valuable traits, the Malic acid or Ma locus, was reported a decade ago. We have identified variants of the Ma locus that appear to predispose certain cultivars to more consistently produce apples with a fresh sensation – high acidity, crispness, and juiciness. Refinement is underway of a <b>predictive</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>test</b> that can identify these variants through pedigree-based analysis and thereby predict genetic potential for fresh sensation. Screening many apple varieties for two simple sequence repeat markers flanking the Ma locus revealed numerous variants associated with fresh sensation differences.

40|$|Abstract While {{recently}} performed genome-wide association {{studies have}} advanced {{the identification of}} genetic variants predisposing to type 2 diabetes (T 2 D), the potential application of these novel findings for disease prediction and prevention has not been well studied. Diabetes prediction and prevention have become urgent issues owing to the rapidly increasing prevalence of diabetes and its associated mortality, morbidity, and health care cost. New prediction approaches using genetic markers could facilitate early identification of high risk sub-groups of the population so that appropriate prevention methods could be effectively applied to delay, or even prevent, disease onset. This paper assessed 18 recently identified T 2 D loci for their potential role in diabetes prediction. We built a new <b>predictive</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>test</b> for T 2 D using the Framingham Heart Study dataset. Using logistic regression and 15 additional loci, the new test was slightly improved over the existing test using just three loci. A formal comparison between the two tests suggests no significant improvement. We further formed a <b>predictive</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>test</b> for identifying early onset T 2 D and found higher classification accuracy for this test, not only indicating that these 18 loci have great potential for predicting early onset T 2 D, but also suggesting that they may play important roles in causing early-onset T 2 D. To further improve the test's accuracy, we applied a newly developed nonparametric method capable of capturing high order interactions to the data, {{but it did not}} outperform a logistic regression that only considers single-locus effects. This could be explained by the absence of gene-gene interactions among the 18 loci. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background With {{a growing}} number of <b>genetic</b> <b>tests</b> {{becoming}} available to the health and consumer markets, genetic health care providers in Canada are faced with the challenge of developing robust decision rules or guidelines to allocate a finite number of public resources. The objective {{of this study was to}} gain Canadian genetic health providers' perspectives on factors and criteria that influence and shape resource allocation decisions for publically funded <b>predictive</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>testing</b> in Canada. Methods The authors conducted semi-structured interviews with 16 senior lab directors and clinicians at publically funded Canadian <b>predictive</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>testing</b> facilities. Participants were drawn from British Columbia, Alberta, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec and Nova Scotia. Given the community sampled was identified as being relatively small and challenging to access, purposive sampling coupled with snowball sampling methodologies were utilized. Results Surveyed lab directors and clinicians indicated that <b>predictive</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>tests</b> were funded provincially by one of two predominant funding models, but they themselves played a significant role in how these funds were allocated for specific tests and services. They also rated and identified several factors that influenced allocation decisions and patients' decisions regarding testing. Lastly, participants provided recommendations regarding changes to existing allocation models and showed support for a national evaluation process for predictive testing. Conclusion Our findings suggest that largely local and relatively ad hoc decision making processes are being made in relation to resource allocations for <b>predictive</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>tests</b> and that a more coordinated and, potentially, national approach to allocation decisions in this context may be appropriate. </p...|$|R

Also, the standard approach easily allows comparison of nested models via likelihood ratio tests and incorporation of covariates - the Lu-Elston approach is shown to have some difficulties with such analyses.

Aim and methodsWe performed a prospective study about the psychological impact of <b>predictive</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>testing</b> in adults seen in our out-patient multidisciplinary consultation (cardiologist, genetic counsellor, and psychologist). Self-report questionnaires were proposed {{during the initial}} consultation (Q 1) and 1 to 3 month after genetic result was given (Q 2). Questionnaires used validated scales to evaluate anxiety, depression, hopelessness, self-esteem, impact of announcement, quality of life (QOL), and motivations. ResultsSixty-six adults completed questionnaire Q 1 and 38 completed questionnaire Q 2 (15 mutation carriers, 23 non carriers). Analysis of psychometric tests revealed no significant modification before/after genetic results. However, genetic status influenced the level of general anxiety, depression score and QOL. The consultation process was evaluated as useful (97 %) and reassuring (80 %). The interview with the pyschologist was useful especially for the anticipation of the result (73 %).

40|$|Background: Prevention {{benefits}} from <b>predictive</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>testing</b> for cancer {{will only be}} fully realized if appropriate screening is adopted after testing. The current study assessed screening and preventive behaviors during 12 months after <b>predictive</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>testing</b> for hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal carcinoma (HNPCC) in an Australian clinical cohort. Methods: Participants received <b>predictive</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>testing</b> for HNPCC at one of five Australian familial cancer clinics. Data on self-reported screening behaviors (colonoscopy, and endometrial sampling and transvaginal ultrasound for women) and prophylactic surgery (colectomy, and hysterectomy and bilateral oophorectomy for women) were collected using postal questionnaires before (baseline) and 12 months after receipt of <b>genetic</b> <b>test</b> results. Age, gender, perceived risk of cancer, and cancer-specific distress were assessed as predictors of colonoscopic screening. Results: In the current study, 114 participants returned baseline questionnaires (32 carriers and 82 noncarriers of an HNPCC mutation). Ninety-eight participants also returned a 12 -month follow-up questionnaire. Of those 25 years, 73 % reported having had a colonoscopy before <b>genetic</b> <b>testing.</b> At follow-up, 71 % (15 of 25) of carriers and 12 % (8 of 65) of noncarriers reported having a colonoscopy in the 12 months after receipt of test results. The reduction in colonoscopy among noncarriers was statistically significant (P < 0. 001). High perceived risk was associated with colonoscopy at baseline. At follow-up, mutation status was the only variable significantly associated with colonoscopy. Among female mutation carriers, 47 % reported having transvaginal ultrasonography and 53 % endometrial sampling during follow-up. There was low uptake of prophylactic surgery for colorectal, endometrial, or ovarian carcinomas.

All our respondents perceived strong benefits, either medical or emotional, in being tested. However, different concerns were raised by the respondents {{that need to be}} addressed during counseling. Greater family awareness was reported by the majority of the respondents, and the ability to provide information to children was a strong motivation for being tested. Conclusion: This study provides valuable information on the personal and familial impacts of having <b>predictive</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>testing</b> for glaucoma, which will help health professionals to better address the issues faced by patients and provide them adequate support...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWhile new {{defects in}} {{are still being}} found, {{it is unclear whether}} current breast cancer {{diagnostics}} misses many -associated cases. A reliable test that is able to indicate the involvement of deficiency in cancer genesis could support decision making in genetic counselling and clinical management. To find -specific markers and explore the effectiveness of the current diagnostic strategy, we designed a classification method, validated it and examined whether we could find -like breast tumours in a group of patients initially diagnosed as non- mutation carriers. A classifier was built based on array-CGH profiles of 18 -related and 32 control breast tumours, and validated on independent sets of 16 -related and 16 control breast carcinomas. Subsequently, we applied the classifier to 48 breast tumours of patients from Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer (HBOC) families in whom no germ line mutations were identified. The classifier showed an accuracy of 91 % when applied to the validation sets. In 48 non- patients, only two breast tumours presented a BRCA 1 -like CGH profile. Additional evidence for dysfunction was found in one of these tumours. We here describe the specific chromosomal aberrations in -related breast carcinomas. We developed a <b>predictive</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>test</b> for -association and show that -related tumours can still be identified in HBOC families after routine DNA diagnostics...|$|E
40|$|Huntington’s disease (HD) is a {{neurodegenerative}} genetic {{condition for}} which a <b>predictive</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>test</b> by mutation analysis has been available since 1993. However, whilst revealing the future presence of the disease, testing may have an adverse psychological impact given that the disease is progressive, incurable and ultimately fatal. The current literature review aimed to explore the published evidence base examining the psychological impact of predictive genetic testing for HD. Based on the synthesis of eight research studies, the process of predictive genetic testing was {{not found to be}} psychological neutral with fluctuating levels of distress irrelevant of test result. Methodological weaknesses were identified highlighting the needs of individuals not accessing testing or follow-up services, warranting further assessment. The research study sought to understand the lived experiences of partner carers of individuals diagnosed with HD throughout the disease trajectory. Qualitative interviews were conducted with six carers whose partners were currently accessing HD services. Analysis using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) revealed five super-ordinate themes with 18 sub-themes allowing for idiosyncrasies of respondents’ experiences to be accounted for. Themes were considered in relation to previous literature within HD and parallel fields with clinical implications highlighted. A need for further exploratory and subsequent quantitative research of phenomena was warranted and recommended. The critical appraisal provides the Researcher’s reflective account of the research process...|$|E
40|$|The {{past decade}} has seen rapid {{advances}} {{in the identification of}} associations between candidate genes and a range of common multifactorial disorders. This paper evaluates public attitudes towards the complexity of genetic risk prediction in psychiatry involving susceptibility genes, uncertain penetrance and gene–environment interactions on which successful molecular-based mental health interventions will depend. A qualitative approach was taken to enable the exploration of the views of the public. Four structured focus groups were conducted with a total of 36 participants. The majority of participants indicated interest in having a genetic test for susceptibility to major depression, if it was available. Having a family history of mental illness was cited as a major reason. After discussion of perceived positive and negative implications of predictive genetic testing, nine of 24 participants initially interested in having such a test changed their mind. Fear of genetic discrimination and privacy issues predominantly influenced change of attitude. All participants still interested in having a <b>predictive</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>test</b> for risk for depression reported they would only do so through trusted medical professionals. Participants were unanimously against direct-to-consumer genetic testing marketed through the Internet, although some would consider it if there was suitable protection against discrimination. The study highlights the importance of general practitioner and public education about psychiatric genetics, and the availability of appropriate treatment and support services prior to implementation of future predictive genetic testing services...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Knowledge on children’s {{capacities}} {{to consent}} to medical treatment is limited. Also, age limits for asking chil-dren’s consent vary considerably between countries. Decision-making on <b>predictive</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>testing</b> (PGT) is espe-cially complicated, considering the ongoing ethical debate. In {{order to examine}} just age limits for alleged competence to consent in children, we evaluated feasibility of a standardized assessment tool, and investigated cutoff ages for children’s competence to consent to PGT. We performed a pilot study, including 17 pediatric outpatients between 6 and 18 years at risk for an autosomal dominantly inherited cardiac disease, eligible for <b>predictive</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>testing.</b> The reference standard for competence was established by experts trained in the rel-evant criteria for competent decision-making.

40|$|<b>Predictive</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>tests</b> for {{familial}} adenomatous polyposis (FAP) {{are routinely}} offered to young people during early adolescence. While this is not controversial, due to the medical benefit conferred by the test, it is nonetheless challenging {{as a consequence of}} the stage of life of the young people, and the simultaneous involvement of multiple family members. Despite these challenges, it is possible to ensure that the test is offered in such a way that it actively acknowledges and facilitates young people's developing autonomy and psychosocial well-being. In this paper we present findings from ten in-depth interviews with young people who have undergone <b>predictive</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>testing</b> for FAP (four male, six female; five gene-positive, five gene-negative; aged 10 - 17 years at the time of their predictive test; aged 12 - 25 years at the time of their research interview). We present five themes that emerged from the interviews which highlight key ethical challenges associated with such testing. These are: (1) the significance of the test; (2) young people's lack of involvement in the decision to be tested; (3) young people's limited understanding; (4) provision of the blood test at the first visit; and (5) group testing of family members. We draw on these themes to make eight recommendations for future practice. Together, these recommendations highlight the importance of providing developmentally appropriate care to young people undergoing <b>predictive</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>testing</b> for FAP...|$|R
