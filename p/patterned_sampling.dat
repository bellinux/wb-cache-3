40|$|Random {{sampling}} is {{a technique}} for signal acquisition which is gaining popularity in practical signal processing systems. Nowadays, event-driven analog-to-digital converters make random sampling feasible in practical applications. A process of random sampling is defined by a <b>sampling</b> <b>pattern,</b> which indicates signal sampling points in time. Practical random <b>sampling</b> <b>patterns</b> are constrained by ADC characteristics and application requirements. In this paper authors introduce statistical methods which evaluate random <b>sampling</b> <b>pattern</b> generators with emphasis on practical applications. Furthermore, the authors propose a new random pattern generator which copes with strict practical limitations imposed on patterns, with possibly minimal loss in randomness of sampling. The proposed generator is compared with existing <b>sampling</b> <b>pattern</b> generators using the introduced statistical methods. It is shown that the proposed algorithm generates random <b>sampling</b> <b>patterns</b> dedicated for event-driven-ADCs better than existed <b>sampling</b> <b>pattern</b> generators. Finally, implementation issues of random <b>sampling</b> <b>patterns</b> are discussed. Comment: 29 pages, 12 figures, submitted to Circuits, Systems and Signal Processing journa...|$|R

40|$|<b>Pattern</b> <b>sampling</b> {{has been}} {{proposed}} as a potential solution to the infamous pattern explosion. Instead of enumerating all patterns that satisfy the constraints, individual <b>patterns</b> are <b>sampled</b> proportional to a given quality measure. Several sampling algorithms have been proposed, but each of them has its limitations {{when it comes to}} (1) flexibility in terms of quality measures and constraints that can be used, and/or (2) guarantees with respect to sampling accuracy. We therefore present Flexics, the first flexible <b>pattern</b> <b>sampler</b> that supports a broad class of quality measures and constraints, while providing strong guarantees regarding sampling accuracy. To achieve this, we leverage the perspective on pattern mining as a constraint satisfaction problem and build upon the latest advances in sampling solutions in SAT as well as existing pattern mining algorithms. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm is applicable to a variety of pattern languages, which allows us to introduce and tackle the novel task of <b>sampling</b> sets of <b>patterns.</b> We introduce and empirically evaluate two variants of Flexics: (1) a generic variant that addresses the well-known itemset sampling task and the novel <b>pattern</b> set <b>sampling</b> task as well as a wide range of expressive constraints within these tasks, and (2) a specialized variant that exploits existing frequent itemset techniques to achieve substantial speed-ups. Experiments show that Flexics is both accurate and efficient, making it a useful tool for pattern-based data exploration. status: publishe...|$|R

Microgalvanic effects {{can lead to}} severe corrosion, particularly important in miniature devices with small-sized metallic components. To elucidate the mechanism of micro-galvanic corrosion effects, well-defined zinc-copper <b>patterned</b> <b>samples</b> were investigated during exposure to 100 ppb formic acid (HCOOH) and 80 % relative humidity at 20 degrees C. The corrosion effects were monitored quantitatively with in situ infrared absorption spectroscopy, and the corrosion products characterized with scanning electron microscopy, confocal Raman microscopy, and atomic force microscopy. The nature of corrosion on zinc on the <b>patterned</b> <b>samples</b> was compared with that on pure zinc and turned out to result, not only in several times higher corrosion kinetics, but also in different corrosion products with respect to distribution, morphology, and composition. Local electrochemical and chemical gradients across the copper-zinc borders resulted in characteristic hemispherically shaped corrosion products at the zinc-copper junction, and {{in the formation of}} zinc formate dihydrate (Zn(HCOO) (2) center dot 2 H(2) O) and crystalline zinc oxide (ZnO), phases not identified on pure zinc.

40|$|This paper {{shows how}} {{coupling}} {{from the past}} (CFTP) {{can be used to}} avoid time and memory bottlenecks in direct local <b>pattern</b> <b>sampling</b> procedures. Such procedures draw controlled amounts of suitably biased samples directly from the pattern space of a given dataset in polynomial time. Previous direct <b>pattern</b> <b>sampling</b> methods can produce patterns in rapid succession after some initial preprocessing phase. This preprocessing phase, however, turns out to be prohibitive in terms of time and memory for many datasets. We show how CFTP can be used to avoid any super-linear preprocessing and memory requirements. This allows to simulate more complex distributions, which previously were intractable. We show for a large number of public real-world datasets that these new algorithms are fast to execute and their pattern collections outperform previous approaches both in unsupervised as well as supervised contexts...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Periodic {{nonuniform}} sampling {{can be used}} {{to achieve}} sub-Nyquist sampling of bandlimited multiband signals. In this paper, we examine the question of selecting the <b>sampling</b> <b>pattern</b> in such a scheme, so that the reconstruction robustness—measured by the condition-number of the modulation matrix—is maximized. Contrary to previous work, where the <b>sampling</b> <b>pattern</b> was chosen from a discrete set, we let the <b>sampling</b> <b>patterns</b> vary continuously, but impose a structural constraint. Using this approach, we de-rive necessary and sufficient conditions on the spectral support of the signal for which perfect conditioning exist, namely, for which a <b>sampling</b> <b>pattern</b> can be found so that the resulting modulation matrix has a condition number equal to 1. A simple test to check for these conditions is developed and the desired <b>sampling</b> <b>patterns</b> are found. An algorithm for choosing the <b>sampling</b> <b>pattern</b> when the aforementioned conditions are not satisfied is also introduced. Finally, we present some simulation results.

40|$|With an ageing {{population}} {{the demand}} for cheap, efficient implants is ever increasing. Laser surface treatment offers a unique means of varying biomimetic properties to determine generic parameters to predict cell responses. This paper details how a KrF excimer laser can be employed for both laser-induced patterning and whole area irradiative processing to modulate the wettability characteristics and osteoblast cell response following 24 hour and 4 day incubation. Through white light interferometry (WLI) {{it was found that}} the surface roughness had considerably increased by up to 1. 5 µm for the laser-induced <b>patterned</b> <b>samples</b> and remained somewhat constant at around 0. 1 µm for the whole area irradiative processed samples. A sessile drop device determined that the wettability characteristics differed between the surface treatments. For the <b>patterned</b> <b>samples</b> the contact angle, θ, increased by up to 25 ° which can be attributed to a mixed-state wetting regime. For the whole area irradiative processed samples θ decreased owed to an increase in polar component, γP. For all samples θ was a decreasing function of the surface energy. The laser whole area irradiative processed samples gave rise to a distinct correlative trend between the cell response, θ and γP. However, no strong relationship was determined for the laser-induced <b>patterned</b> <b>samples</b> due to the mixed-state wetting regime. As a result, owed to the relationships and evidence of cell differentiation one can deduce that laser whole area irradiative processing is an attractive technology for employment within regenerative medicine to meet the demands of an ageing population...|$|R

Sample plans were evaluated by the accuracy and reliability of their estimation {{of the population and}} by the cost of collecting, processing, and counting the samples. Interactive FORTRAN programs were constructed to simulate four collecting patterns: random; division of the field into square sub-units (cells); and division of the field into rectangular sub-traits (strips) running in two directions.
