40|$|Mobile {{phones and}} related gadgets in {{networks}} {{are on the}} spot to deliver sufficient performance for rich multimedia applications and communication. In this report we introduce a video conferencing software, which seamlessly integrates mobile with stationary users into fully distributed multi-party conversations. Innovations related to this work are twofold. At first we report on a highly optimized realisation of a H. 264 codec and our implementation experiences of the video conference software on a consumer mobile. Within the tight bounds of real-time requirements on mobiles, the coding software outperforms compatible H. 264 realizations. At second we present an integrated <b>peer-to-peer</b> group <b>communication</b> solution, which scales well for medium-size conferences and accounts for the heterogeneous nature of mobile and stationary participants.

The function of the cross-media CIP Safety protocol is performed by the end units, {{making it possible to}} simultaneously operate standard and safety devices in the same network. Reliable communication can take place between all network levels, including <b>peer-to-peer</b> <b>communication</b> and cross-network communication. The master does not necessarily have to be a safety controller. It can also route data without being able to interpret it.

50|$|Although many {{developers}} {{had been}} a part of the Invisible IRC Project (IIP) and Freenet communities, there are significant differences between their designs and concepts. IIP was an anonymous centralized IRC server. Freenet is a censorship-resistant distributed data store. I2P is an anonymous <b>peer-to-peer</b> distributed <b>communication</b> layer designed to run any traditional internet service (e.g. Usenet, email, IRC, file sharing, Web hosting and HTTP, Telnet), as well as more traditional distributed applications (e.g. a distributed data store, a web proxy network using Squid, or DNS).|$|R
50|$|Net {{neutrality}} is {{the practice}} of keeping internet service providers from offering tiered service and controlling the ability to block out competition by restricting certain pipelines within the internet. By blocking these pipelines, the provider creates an unfair transfer of packets across the internet, diminishing the quality of service. Internet service providers seek to discriminate against <b>peer-to-peer</b> (P2P) <b>communication,</b> FTP, online games, and high bandwidth video streaming. This practice is called bandwidth throttling, {{which is used to}} control congestion within the network created by these processes.|$|R

30|$|We propose two new MN-initiated schemes, {{in which}} the {{discovery}} procedure is activated by the MN. These two schemes can find appropriate MRT routers within fewer control messages than HA-initiated schemes. Therefore, the signaling overhead can be significantly reduced. These two MN-initiated schemes can provide a more efficient discovery procedure while avoiding the security problems that affect other schemes. However, if the <b>communication</b> model is <b>peer-to-peer,</b> the <b>communication</b> may be started with the CN. The MN can activate the discovery procedure when the MN receives the first tunneled packet sent by the CN.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Recently, botnets {{utilizing}} <b>peer-to-peer</b> style <b>communication</b> infrastructures {{have been}} discovered, requiring {{new approaches to}} detec-tion and monitoring techniques. Current detection methods analyze net-work communication patterns, identifying systems {{that may have been}} recruited into the botnet. This paper presents a localized botnet com-munication model that enables a portion of compromised systems to hide from such detection techniques without a potentially significant in-crease in network monitoring points. By organizing bot systems at the the subnet level the amount of communication with the outside network is greatly reduced, requiring switch-level monitoring to identify infected systems. ...|$|R
