Up to now, organotitanate compounds are used as catalysts on an industrial scale only for the synthesis of <b>poly(butylenes</b> <b>terephthalate)</b> (<b>PBT),</b> poly(trimethylene <b>terephthalate)</b> (PTT), and related copolyesters; for poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), synthesis antimony-based catalysts are preferred.

50|$|<b>Polybutylene</b> <b>terephthalate</b> (<b>PBT)</b> is a {{thermoplastic}} {{engineering polymer}} {{that is used}} as an insulator in the electrical and electronics industries. It is a thermoplastic (semi-)crystalline polymer, and a type of polyester.

5000|$|In {{glass fibre}} {{reinforced}} (GF) polyamide 6 (Nylon 6) and 66 (Nylon 66) formulations {{as well as}} in polyesters like <b>polybutylene</b> <b>terephthalate</b> (<b>PBT)</b> and PET, aluminium diethyl phosphinate shows excellent performance in the UL 94 flammability tests [...] (UL 94 V0 specification is met down to 0.4 mm), {{as well as in}} the glow wire tests required for appliances. Here, formulations with aluminium diethyl phosphinate meet the glow wire ignition test (GWIT) [...] at 775 °C and the glow wire flammability test (GWFI) at 960 °C. Another important criterion in E&E applications is the Comparative Tracking Index (CTI), which determines the risk of electrical tracking of insulating material that is exposed to contaminating environments and surface conditions. With formulations containing aluminium diethyl phosphinate, the highest requirement of 600 V (numeric value of the highest voltage at which an electrical insulating material withstands 50 drops of electrolytic test solution) is achieved. Further benefits of polyamides and polyesters containing aluminium diethyl phosphinate are low smoke density which makes them suitable for rolling stock applications to EN 45545, as well as good light stability which is needed for outdoor applications.|$|E

In this work, composites based on post-industrial waste or primary recycled <b>poly(butylene</b> <b>terephthalate)</b> and 5 [*]wt. % of organic modified montmorillonite clays were melt compounded using a twin-screw extruder. A 2 (2) factorial experimental design was used to study the compounding and processing variables: Organic modified montmorillonite with one or two hydrogenated tallow (initial basal spacing) and screw speed of the extruder. X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy suggest that a partial exfoliation of the organoclay in the recycled <b>poly(butylene</b> <b>terephthalate)</b> matrix was achieved for organic modified montmorillonite with lower initial basal spacing. On the other hand, formulations containing organic modified montmorillonite with higher initial basal spacing showed only intercalated structure.

5000|$|The most {{important}} flame retardants systems used act {{either in the}} gas phase where they remove the high energy radicals H and OH from the flame or in the solid phase, where they shield the polymer by forming a charred layer and thus protect the polymer from being attacked by oxygen and heat.Flame retardants based on bromine or chlorine, {{as well as a}} number of phosphorus compounds act chemically in the gas phase and are very efficient. Others only act in the condensed phase such as metal hydroxides (aluminum trihydrate, or ATH, magnesium hydroxide, or MDH, and boehmite), metal oxides and salts (zinc borate and zinc oxide, zinc hydroxystannate), as well as expandable graphite and some nanocomposites (see below). Phosphorus and nitrogen compounds are also effective in the condensed phase, and as they also may act in the gas phase, they are quite efficient flame retardants. Overviews of the main flame retardants families, their mode of action and applications are given in.
