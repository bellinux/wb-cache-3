50|$|<b>Plague</b> is an {{infectious}} disease that {{is caused by}} the bacterium Yersinia pestis. Depending on lung infection, or sanitary conditions, <b>plague</b> can be spread in the air, by direct contact, or very rarely by contaminated undercooked food. The symptoms of <b>plague</b> depend on the concentrated areas of infection in each person: bubonic <b>plague</b> in lymph nodes, septicemic <b>plague</b> in blood vessels, pneumonic <b>plague</b> in lungs. It is treatable if detected early. <b>Plague</b> is still relatively common in some remote parts of the world.|$|R

50|$|A <b>plague</b> {{vaccine is}} used for an {{induction}} of active specific immunity in a susceptible organism to <b>plague</b> by means of administration an antigenic material (a vaccine) via a variety of routes to people at risk of contracting any clinical form of <b>plague.</b> This method is known as <b>plague</b> immunization. There is strong evidence for the efficacy of administration of some <b>plague</b> vaccines in preventing or ameliorating {{the effects of a}} variety of clinical forms of infection by Yersinia pestis. <b>Plague</b> immunization also encompasses incurring state of passive specific immunity to <b>plague</b> in a susceptible organism after administration of a <b>plague</b> serum or <b>plague</b> immunoglobulin in people with an immediate risk of developing the disease. Many areas that are affected by <b>plague</b> in modern times are third world countries, and therefore cannot get accurate diagnosis or decent medical care for any sufferers of bubonic or pneumonic <b>plague.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Plague</b> {{is present}} among rodents in Africa, the Americas, and Asia.

40|$|A 56 -year {{time series}} of human <b>plague</b> cases (Yersinia pestis) {{in the western}} United States was used to explore the effects of climatic {{patterns}} on <b>plague</b> levels. We found that the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), together with previous <b>plague</b> levels and above-normal temperatures, explained much of the <b>plague</b> variability. We propose that the PDO's impact on <b>plague</b> is conveyed via its effect on precipitation and temperature {{and the effect of}} precipitation and temperature on <b>plague</b> hosts and vectors: warmer and wetter climate leading to increased <b>plague</b> activity and thus an increased number of human cases. Our analysis furthermore provides insights into the consistency of <b>plague</b> mechanisms at larger scales...|$|R
25|$|The {{three types}} of <b>plague</b> {{are the result of}} the route of infection: bubonic <b>plague,</b> septicemic <b>plague,</b> and pneumonic <b>plague.</b> Bubonic <b>plague</b> is mainly spread by {{infected}} fleas from small animals. It may also result from exposure to the body fluids from a dead <b>plague</b> infected animal. In the bubonic form of <b>plague,</b> the bacteria enter through the skin through a flea bite and travel via the lymphatic vessels to a lymph node, causing it to swell. Diagnosis is made by finding the bacteria in the blood, sputum, or fluid from lymph nodes.|$|R

50|$|The {{disease is}} {{generally}} {{believed to have}} been bubonic <b>plague,</b> an infection by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, transmitted via a rat vector. Other symptom patterns of the bubonic <b>plague,</b> such as septicemic <b>plague</b> and pneumonic <b>plague</b> were also present.|$|R
50|$|Pneumonic <b>plague</b> can {{be caused}} in two ways: primary, which results from the {{inhalation}} of aerosolised <b>plague</b> bacteria, or secondary, when septicaemic <b>plague</b> spreads into lung tissue from the bloodstream. Pneumonic <b>plague</b> is not exclusively vector-borne like bubonic plague; instead it can be spread from person to person. There have been cases of pneumonic <b>plague</b> resulting from the dissection or handling of contaminated animal tissue. This is one type of the <b>plague</b> {{formerly known as the}} Black Death.|$|R
50|$|The pneumonic form {{may occur}} {{following}} an initial bubonic or septicemic <b>plague</b> infection. It may also result from breathing in airborne droplets from another person or cat infected with pneumonic <b>plague.</b> The {{difference between the}} forms of <b>plague</b> is the location of infection; in pneumonic <b>plague</b> the infection is in the lungs, in bubonic <b>plague</b> the lymph nodes, and in septicemic <b>plague</b> within the blood. Diagnosis is by testing the blood, sputum, or fluid from a lymph node.|$|R
