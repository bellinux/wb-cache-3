50|$|The {{electromagnetic}} <b>parking</b> <b>sensor</b> (EPS) was re-invented and patented in 1992 by Mauro Del Signore. Electromagnetic sensors rely on {{the vehicle}} moving slowly and smoothly towards the object to be avoided. Once detected, the obstacle, if the vehicle momentarily stops on its approach, the sensor continues to give signal of presence of the obstacle. If the vehicle then resumes its manoeuvre the alarm signal {{becomes more and more}} impressive as the obstacle approaches. Electromagnetic parking sensors are often sold as not requiring any holes to be drilled offering a unique design that discreetly mounts on the inner side of the bumper preserving the 'new factory look' of your vehicle. Now they also come equipped with a camera to go with the sensor. By 2018 the US is requiring back up camera with sensors on all cars.|$|E
50|$|In December 2006, Toyota and Daihatsu in Indonesia {{launched}} {{the second generation}} of Rush and Terios which have longer wheelbase. However, the car only comes with rear wheel drive. The Daihatsu Terios and Toyota Rush are available only with the long wheelbase in Indonesia. The difference between Rush and Terios: Rush is designed for five people only, and Terios is designed for seven people, so the Rush lacks third row seating (although third-row seat is available as a dealer option). Also both cars have different rim, with seven bespoked wheel from JDM version of Toyota Rush installed on Daihatsu Terios and five-bespoked wheel from European market Daihatsu Terios installed on Toyota Rush.In Indonesia, the second generation Daihatsu Terios came with three trim levels: X, X Extra, R and R Adventure. X and X Extra have almost spotless unsimilarities apart from <b>parking</b> <b>sensor,</b> wheel hub, and automatic transmission. Whilst Daihatsu Terios R have a striking differences even from the previous versions and facelifts, such as body kit design (R Adventure) and wheel arches, brand new bespoked alloy wheels, spoiler as standard (previous one was optional) and satnav with DVD player double din stereo, rear parking camera and HDMI input.|$|E

D 3 Programs Computer Science Faculty of Mathematics and NaturalSciences University of Eleven March. Car drivers often experience difficulties to park their {{cars in the}} narrow location, because the parking area is narrower. Not a few drivers hit the power pole or deface the walls when parking the car. The goal of this final task is to design a car <b>parking</b> <b>sensor</b> prototype based on AT 89 S 51 microcontroller. This tools system uses a AT 89 S 51 microcontroller as a main control. Used as input SRF 04 ultrasonic sensor module which, it consists TX (transmitter) and RX (receiver). Output use an LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) to display the distance and uses speakers for sound indicators. Results obtained from that car <b>parking</b> <b>sensor</b> prototype based on AT 89 S 51 microcontroller is a tool {{can be used to}} measure the distance of parking.

40|$|Abstract. In China, {{finding a}} vacant parking {{space in a}} {{congested}} area or a large parking lot is always time consuming and frustrating. To minimize hassle and inconvenience to the automatic drivers, this paper proposed a novel smart parking system which consists of many <b>parking</b> <b>sensor</b> nodes and one parking gateway in one large parking lot. <b>Parking</b> <b>sensor</b> node is used as vehicle occupancy detector and parking gateway is used as parking lot manager. All <b>parking</b> <b>sensor</b> nodes compose wireless sensor networks with Zigbee transmission protocol. With the GPRS/ 3 G transmission function of parking gateway, large parking lot can provide friendly parking information to the running vehicles and subscribed users. In a word, the proposed novel smart parking system is provided with innovative and practicability. I...|$|E

30|$|This work {{describes}} how a commercial trike with already integrated E-bike motor, was additionally equipped with self-developed devices which helps {{to compensate the}} perception problems. For this purpose, an ultrasonic distance sensors system was developed and adapted. It works similar to a <b>parking</b> <b>sensor</b> in a car. If a defined threshold distance of the bicycle to another object is registered, an acoustic feedback is generated. Also, a force plate was developed which enables testing {{to what extent the}} E-bike motor provides a reduction in the use of muscle power. To confirm that the E-bike motor helps not to overstrain the patient, measurements of health parameters like heart rate and blood pressure were done with and without the use of the motor.|$|E
