2500|$|In August 2012, Stephen M. Walt, Robert and Renée Belfer {{professor}} of international relations at Harvard University, argued that the collective sabre rattling from Israel's politicians, and repeated assertions about [...] "closing windows," [...] "red lines," [...] and [...] "zones of immunity," [...] with regard to an imminent Israeli attack against Iran, was bluff. In his analysis Israel lacks the military means alone to cause sufficient damage to Iran's nuclear facilities. The wave of public declarations constitutes a campaign, he continues, whose purpose is to pressure the Obama administration to impose both stricter sanctions and extract a <b>public</b> <b>undertaking</b> by President Obama that {{he is willing to}} use force. In his view, this ploy intends to inch the U.S. closer to declaring a war that Israel on its own itself cannot undertake.|$|E
