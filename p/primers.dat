5|$|A small {{fraction}} of the zircon is converted to the metal, which finds various niche applications. Because of zirconium's excellent resistance to corrosion, it is often used as an alloying agent in materials that are exposed to aggressive environments, such as surgical appliances, light filaments, and watch cases. The high reactivity of zirconium with oxygen at high temperatures is exploited in some specialised applications such as explosive <b>primers</b> and as getters in vacuum tubes. The same property is (probably) the purpose of including Zr nano-particles as pyrophoric material in explosive weapons such as the BLU-97/B Combined Effects Bomb.|$|E
5|$|Conservation {{efforts for}} Hydnellum are {{hindered}} {{by the fact}} that some species are difficult to discriminate in the field, making it hard to determine an appropriate conservation status. Techniques based on species-specific PCR <b>primers</b> and DNA extraction from soil have been developed to detect the mycelia of various Hydnellum species without having to rely on the presence of fruitbodies, which may help conservation efforts as well as improve understanding of below-ground ecology. Similar techniques have been used to show that, in the case of H.aurantiacum and H.caeruleum, the fungus can persist below the ground for at least four years without producing fruitbodies.|$|E

5|$|Lessons for Children is {{a series}} of four age-adapted reading <b>primers</b> written by the {{prominent}} 18th-century British poet and essayist Anna Laetitia Barbauld. Published in 1778 and 1779, the books initiated a revolution in children's literature in the Anglo-American world. For the first time, the needs of the child reader were seriously considered: the typographically simple texts progress in difficulty as the child learns. In perhaps the first demonstration of experiential pedagogy in Anglo-American children's literature, Barbauld's books use a conversational style, which depicts a mother and her son discussing the natural world. Based on the educational theories of John Locke, Barbauld's books emphasise learning through the senses.|$|E

25|$|The {{branched-chain}} {{fatty acid}} synthesizing system uses α-keto acids as <b>primers.</b> This system {{is distinct from}} the branched-chain fatty acid synthetase that utilizes short-chain acyl-CoA esters as <b>primers.</b> α-Keto acid <b>primers</b> are derived from the transamination and decarboxylation of valine, leucine, and isoleucine to form 2-methylpropanyl-CoA, 3-methylbutyryl-CoA, and 2-Methylbutyryl-CoA, respectively. 2-Methylpropanyl-CoA <b>primers</b> derived from valine are elongated to produce even-numbered iso-series fatty acids such as 14-methyl-pentadecanoic (isopalmitic) acid, and 3-methylbutyryl-CoA <b>primers</b> from leucine {{may be used to}} form odd-numbered iso-series fatty acids such as 13-methyl-tetradecanoic acid. 2-Methylbutyryl-CoA <b>primers</b> from isoleucine are elongated to form anteiso-series fatty acids containing an odd number of carbon atoms such as 12-Methyl tetradecanoic acid. Decarboxylation of the primer precursors occurs through the branched-chain α-keto acid decarboxylase (BCKA) enzyme. Elongation of the fatty acid follows the same biosynthetic pathway in Escherichia coli used to produce straight-chain fatty acids where malonyl-CoA is used as a chain extender. The major end products are 12–17 carbon branched-chain fatty acids and their composition tends to be uniform and characteristic for many bacterial species.|$|E
25|$|Researchers {{commonly}} replicate DNA {{in vitro}} using the {{polymerase chain reaction}} (PCR). PCR uses a pair of <b>primers</b> to span a target region in template DNA, and then polymerizes partner strands in each direction from these <b>primers</b> using a thermostable DNA polymerase. Repeating this process through multiple cycles amplifies the targeted DNA region. At {{the start of each}} cycle, the mixture of template and <b>primers</b> is heated, separating the newly synthesized molecule and template. Then, as the mixture cools, both of these become templates for annealing of new <b>primers,</b> and the polymerase extends from these. As a result, the number of copies of the target region doubles each round, increasing exponentially.|$|E
25|$|When {{transcription}} {{takes place}} on the heavy strand a polycistronic transcript is created. The light strand produces either small transcripts, {{which can be used}} as <b>primers,</b> or one long transcript. The production of <b>primers</b> occurs by processing of light strand transcripts with the Mitochondrial RNase MRP (Mitochondrial RNA Processing). The requirement of transcription to produce <b>primers</b> links the process of transcription to mtDNA replication. Full length transcripts are cut into functional tRNA, rRNA, and mRNA molecules.|$|E

METODOLOGIA: incisivos bovinos (60) foram divididos em 6 grupos: (1) controle sem contaminação salivar (sem adesivo), (2) controle com contaminação salivar (sem adesivo), (3) adesivo auto-condicionante sem contaminação salivar, (4) adesivo auto-condicionante com contaminação salivar antes do adesivo, (5) adesivo hidrofílico sem contaminação salivar e (6) adesivo hidrofílico com contaminação salivar antes do adesivo. Braquetes metálicos foram colados com compósito (Transbond XT, 3 M Unitek, Monrovia, Califórnia).

RESULTS: Under dry uncontaminated enamel conditions comparable results were found between the control (1) and the self-etching <b>primer</b> (3), while the hydrophilic <b>primer</b> (5) presented higher bond strength. Under saliva contamination, a significant difference was found between the control (2) and the self-etching <b>primer</b> (4), however, there was no difference between the self-etching <b>primer</b> (4) and the hydrophilic <b>primer</b> group (6).

40|$|The {{application}} of isothermal amplification technologies is rapidly expanding and currently covers different {{areas such as}} infectious disease, genetic disorder and drug dosage adjustment. Meanwhile, many of such technologies have complex reaction processes and often require a fine-tuned <b>primer</b> set where existing <b>primer</b> design tools are not sufficient. We have developed a <b>primer</b> selection system for one important <b>primer,</b> the turn-back <b>primer</b> (TP), which is commonly used in loop-mediated amplification (LAMP) and smart amplification process (SmartAmp). We chose 78 parameters related to the <b>primer</b> and target sequence, and explored their relationship to amplification speed using experimental data for 1344 <b>primer</b> combinations. We employed the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method for parameter selection and estimation of their numerical coefficients.

25|$|Nested PCR: {{increases}} {{the specificity of}} DNA amplification, by reducing background due to non-specific amplification of DNA. Two sets of <b>primers</b> are used in two successive PCRs. In the first reaction, one pair of <b>primers</b> is used to generate DNA products, which besides the intended target, may still consist of non-specifically amplified DNA fragments. The product(s) are then used in a second PCR {{with a set of}} <b>primers</b> whose binding sites are completely or partially different from and located 3' of each of the <b>primers</b> used in the first reaction. Nested PCR is often more successful in specifically amplifying long DNA fragments than conventional PCR, but it requires more detailed knowledge of the target sequences.|$|E
25|$|In {{species or}} {{population}} analysis, {{for example in}} conservation work, PCR <b>primers</b> which amplify microsatellites in one individual or species can work in other species. However, the risk of applying PCR <b>primers</b> across different species is that null alleles become likely, whenever sequence divergence is too great for the <b>primers</b> to bind.

25|$|Primase adds RNA <b>primers</b> {{onto the}} lagging strand, which allows {{synthesis}} of Okazaki fragments from 5' to 3'. However, primase creates RNA <b>primers</b> {{at a much}} lower rate than that at which DNA polymerase synthesizes DNA on the leading strand. DNA polymerase on the lagging strand also has to be continually recycled to construct Okazaki fragments following RNA <b>primers.</b> This makes the speed of lagging strand synthesis much lower than that of the leading strand. To solve this, primase acts as a temporary stop signal, briefly halting the progression of the replication fork during DNA replication. This molecular process prevents the leading strand from overtaking the lagging strand.|$|E

This process involves significant trial and error on the part of researchers, as microsatellite repeat sequences must be predicted and <b>primers</b> that are randomly isolated may not display significant polymorphism. Microsatellite loci are widely distributed throughout the genome and can be isolated from semi-degraded DNA of older specimens, as all that is needed is a suitable substrate for amplification through PCR.|$|E
