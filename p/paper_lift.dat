40|$|In this <b>paper,</b> <b>lift</b> {{and drag}} {{coefficients}} were numerically investigated using NUMECA software {{in a set}} of 4 -digit NACA airfoils. Two metamodels based on the evolved group method of data handling (GMDH) type neural networks were then obtained for modeling both lift coefficient (CL) and drag coefficient (CD) with respect to the geometrical design parameters. After using such obtained polynomial neural networks, modified non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGAII) was used for Pareto based optimization of 4 -digit NACA airfoils considering two conflicting objectives such as (CL) and (CD). Further evaluations of the design points in the obtained Pareto fronts using the NUMECA software showed the effectiveness of such an approach. Moreover, it was shown that some interesting and important relationships as the useful optimal design principles involved in the performance of the airfoils can be discovered by the Pareto-based multi-objective optimization of the obtained polynomial meta-models. Such important optimal principles would not have been obtained without using the approach presented in this paper...|$|E

Electrodynamic suspension is based on repulsive force between two magnetic fields with the same polarity. In this research the electrodynamic suspension system consists of a moving permanent magnet block levitated over a flat conducting plate with 2 mm thickness. At first, the analytical model of the PMEDS is proposed. For this propose, permanent magnet poles are modeled by the current sheets. Then the eddy current is calculated on aluminum sheet by considering the skin effect. Finally, the lift and drag forces are calculated in difference speed. The 2 D finite element method is utilized to investigate the effect of speed variations {{on the performance of}} PMEDS at two different airgap. Two-dimensional finite element model, the accuracy of proposed analytical model is validated. The results of the finite element method are compared with results obtained by analytical model. It shows the accuracy of the analytical model in the estimation of the lift and drag forces of an electrodynamic suspension system...|$|E

Previous solutions to this problem are restricted to composite services with well-structured orchestration models. Yet, in existing languages such as WS-BPEL and BPMN, orchestration models may be unstructured. This <b>paper</b> <b>lifts</b> this limitation by providing equations to compute the aggregate QoS for general types of irreducible unstructured regions in orchestration models. In conjunction with existing algorithms for decomposing business process models into singleentry-single-exit regions, these equations allow us to cover a larger set of orchestration models than existing QoS aggregation techniques. ...|$|R

Deriving an operational system from a set of scenarios is the main challenge that is typically addressed by either synthesizing system components or by providing operational semantics. Over the last years, several established scenario-based techniques have been adopted to Petri nets. Their adaptation allows for verifying scenario-based models and for synthesizing individual components from scenarios within one formal technique, by building on Petri net theory. However, current adaptations of scenarios face two limitations: a system modeler (1) cannot abstract from concrete behavior, and (2) cannot explicitly describe data in scenarios.

The original framework, however, does not deal satisfactorily with stateful external environments: the possibility of predictably influencing external environments has thus not yet been considered explicitly. This <b>paper</b> <b>lifts</b> hex programs to acthex programs: acthex programs introduce the notion of action atoms, which are associated to corresponding functions capable of actually changing the state of external environments. The execution of specific sequences of action atoms can be declaratively programmed. Furthermore, acthex programs allow for selecting preferred actions, building on weights and corresponding cost functions. We introduce syntax and semantics of acthex programs; acthex programs can successfully be exploited as a general purpose language for the declarative implementation of executable specifications, which we illustrate by encodings of knowledge bases updates, action languages, and an agent programming language. A system capable of executing acthex programs has been implemented and is publicly available. 1...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis <b>paper</b> <b>lifts</b> earlier category-theoretic {{results on}} datatypes {{to the level}} of an {{abstract}} language suitable for categorical programming language implementation. The earlier work built a strongly normalizing categorical combinator reduction system based entirely on functorial strength which allows the distribution of context to the interior of datatypes. Here we declare inductive (initial) and coinductive (final) datatypes in a Hagino-Wraith style to provide an expressive computing environment. An inductive (resp. coinductive) datatype consists of a strong type-forming functor accompanied by (1) a collection of constructors (resp. destructors) and (2) a fold (resp. unfold) which is parametrized by state transformations to realize the appropriate universal property. The high complexity of programming exclusively in categorical notation (combinators) warrants the development of a friendlier language isomorphic to the distributive categorical setting. In this paper such a term logic, which is also the programming language of the charity programming system, is described. This logic is first-order and is dictated directly by the underlying categorical semantics. It embodies primitive inductive and coinductive principles which reflect the uniqueness properties of the fold and unfold combinators. Several basic progam equivalences are demonstrated to illustrate how these inductive and coinductive principles can be used...|$|R
