40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{comprehensive}} analysis {{of the effects of}} seed orientation, row direction and planting population on grain yield, kernel composition, and silage yield and composition. Producers are striving to increase profit by efficiently using their available land area to maximize crop production. However, little research is available testing the effect of seed orientation on grain or silage production. Quantifying the impacts of seed orientation and row direction on grain and silage is essential for maximum crop production. Dissemination of the results should benefit grain and silage producer. Two experiments were conducted to evaluate the effects of manipulating seed orientation at planting. In the first experiment, maize yield and kernel composition characteristics were evaluated during the 2011 growing season. The first experiment supported yield increases from controlled manipulation of kernels into the soil. This experiment did support that through alternative <b>planting</b> <b>methods,</b> grain and silage yields can be increased compared to the conventional <b>planting</b> <b>methods</b> that are currently practiced. In the second experiment, maize grain, kernel composition, silage yield and silage composition were evaluated to observe differences from controlled <b>planting</b> <b>methods</b> compared to conventional <b>planting</b> <b>methods</b> during the 2012 growing season. Researchers observed increases in maize grain and silage yield from controlled <b>planting</b> <b>methods</b> compared to conventional <b>planting</b> <b>methods.</b> Differences were observed in direction of leaves in the canopy between planting treatments indicating that plants are able to change the orientation of leaves due to competition of neighboring plants. These studies suggest controlling seed orientation at planting can increase grain and silage yields with no additional changes to production practices. Additional research is warranted to evaluate differences during different growing conditions of different years and to evaluate hybrid differences for planting treatments...|$|R

5000|$|Gray {{was also}} sent on {{collecting}} trips by Dave Gordon. During one three-month trip, seeds and detailed growing conditions were collected {{for more than}} 1000 species. By the time Gray left Myall Park in 1957, he (like his predecessor Len Miller) had made a major and important contribution {{to the development of}} the garden and herbarium. Many of the plants that grow in the garden derive from seeds collected by Gray and Miller. Albert Robinson replaced Alf Gray and worked for ten years in the garden, continuing propagation projects and cultivating existing plants. Bob Doney also worked in the Myall Park garden during the 1960s. Gordon's employment of nurserymen for what was, at this time, essentially a private hobby, illustrates his passion and serious investment in the garden.A range of methods were used at Myall Park to provide successful raising and growing conditions, including the preparation of special growing beds, and experiments with soil structure and composition. The influence of Gordon's father was evident in the layout of the garden, through the practice of planting in clumps rather than lines. The garden was organised into divisions and Gordon methodically planted as much of a genus as was available together in the garden. Beyond aesthetic and environmental benefits, this <b>planting</b> <b>method</b> was also a way of encouraging natural hybridisation. The genus Grevillea had been a focus during plant collecting trips and in 1963 a new Grevillea hybrid appeared in the garden. Displaying the low growing characteristics of the Grevillea bipinnatifida, together with the vibrant flame coloured flowers of the G. banksii, and the ability to flower throughout the year and attract birds, the hybrid featured highly desirable attributes for gardeners. Gordon named the hybrid Grevillea [...] "Robyn Gordon" [...] after his eldest daughter (who died aged 16 from illness in 1969) and distributed it freely to nurseries in Brisbane and Sydney, without payment. Two other hybrids, named after the Gordon's other daughters, Grevillea [...] "Sandra Gordon" [...] (also a popular garden plant) and G.'Merinda Gordon' were also produced at Myall Park.|$|E
40|$|A {{stochastic}} {{optimization model}} is developed {{to make a}} selection between the <b>planting</b> <b>method</b> and the seed-tree method, {{taking into account the}} uncertainty of, and the legal requirement on, the stocking level of the established seedlings in a given year after regeneration action. Uncertainty is quantified as the variation of the mortality rate of planted seedlings for the <b>planting</b> <b>method,</b> and as the prediction error for the seed-tree method. The objective of the forest landowner is assumed to maximize the expected net present value (NPV). Numerical simulations show that the owner should prefer the seed-tree method to the <b>planting</b> <b>method</b> for Scots pine stand. However, if the risk-free selection model is used, it overestimates the expected NPV by about 2 %. Sensitivity analysis shows that a less restrictive forest act could improve the expected net present value both for the <b>planting</b> <b>method</b> and the seed-tree method. Sensitivity analysis also shows that decreasing the level of variation of the mortality rate (or prediction error) increases the expected NPV. ...|$|E

40|$|Public {{parks and}} gardens (planting structures) {{in urban areas}} are subject to various forms of human intervention, based on {{traditional}} planting methods. These forms of intervention {{are related to the}} creation of individual space required for mature growth of ligneous plants by thinning or by limiting growth in cases where plants exceed the space delineated for them. Such intervention is costly, must be executed timely in order to prevent irreversible deformity, and influences undamaged growth. The objective {{of this study is to}} resolve the contradiction between human intervention and undamaged growth by adopting a <b>planting</b> <b>method</b> which is based on a dynamic approach to the design of planting schemes. This dynamic approach has led to the integral <b>planting</b> <b>method</b> as a theoretical model; in this method, the space required for maximum growth in a plant's mature phase is combined with the realisation of architectural functions. The desired effect is defined by the initial size of the trees and shrubs. The growth movement towards the dimensions of the maturity phase is part of a composition in time and space in accordance with a so-called 'planting-film'. Because the growth rate of the plants defines the above-mentioned composition, human intervention can be reduced to a minimum. In addition, the integral <b>planting</b> <b>method</b> contains a set of instruments to define the space for growth to a certain size at a certain point in time in location-specific circumstances. By providing sufficient room for growth and by relating life span to environment dynamics, unexpected changes in future growth development can, to a certain extent, be compensated. The retrospective in Chapter 2 shows that with the <b>planting</b> <b>method</b> applied in the three cases (Haarzuilens, Amsterdamse Bos, Bijlmermeer Groenstructuur), people are always aiming for quick results and planning for future growth requires much effort, which must be enforced timely and systematically to ensure that the desired effect is not affected irreversibly (Bijlmermeer Park Structure) or operational backlog is not increased further. It is essential that the terminology used is unambiguous to define and legitimize the objective or intended development of a planting structure during the analysis phase. To achieve this unambiguousness, Chapter 3 provides a description of the morphology and morphodynamics (dimensions, growth rate, life span) of the elements used to describe the defined situation. This description, as defined in the tables 'Classification of free-standing forms', Planting typology I, II, III and IV, has led to unambiguous terms and definitions. This will lead to the motivation for the planting scheme (initial situation: initial dimensions, planting distances, assortment) and the planting film (the defined situation). Next, the 'growth', as the effect of movement, is derived from the growth curve survey for each element. The growth curve survey reproduces the morphodynamic aspects in a simplified linear growth curve. The transformations of planting types are shown tobe brought about on the basis of morphodynamics. The Cd-rom supplied with this thesis shows these dynamics from different angles, in the form of a planting film. Chapter 4 describes the principles of the adopted, not-adopted, identical and shifted position, with which the morphodynamic aspects of the plant can be applied strategically to also realise transformations of the plant types. The implementation of the growth curve survey shows how larger plant material can be used to start with. The example of a 2 -acre park in Boxmeer shows what the principles for freestanding plant shapes bring about in real situations. The operating method and manual clarify how a starting situation (the planting scheme) and its related management regime (execution and maintenance plan) can be derived from the defined situation to which it should lead. In chapter 5 a comparison is made to ascertain how the integral <b>planting</b> <b>method</b> behaves in relation to the traditional method. When designing parks and gardens, the definition of assortment, planting interval, initial size and construction and maintenance method covers many variables such as architecture, micro climate, soil, opinions on contruction and maintenance method, quality of base materials, organisation of implementation and so on. These aspects are covered in anumber of cases (Polderpark Almere, Bakenhof Arnhem, Prins Bernhardbos Hoofddorp). The method applied in the comparison covers four steps. Step one describes the defined situation and the set-up according to the original <b>planting</b> <b>method.</b> Step two covers the growth curve survey which defines the location-specific morphodynamic characteristics of the plants involved for their actual as well as projected or future growth. Step three contains a fully worked-out planting and maintenance plan based on the alternative <b>planting</b> <b>method</b> and starting from the same defined situation as in step one. In step four the architectural and cost aspects of both planting methods are compared. The architectural aspects show the morphodynamics of the plant structure in the long term with the aid of views and diagrams drawn to scale, elucidated with data from the location-specific growth curve survey and field observations of the actual situation. The cost aspects are based on construction and maintenance for the first 30 years, expressed in cumulative, indexed and hard cash amounts, shown graphically for each <b>planting</b> <b>method</b> in the different cases. The results of the comparison show that a screen or block based on the traditional <b>planting</b> <b>method</b> will reach full functionality at eye level after 4 - 7 years. With the integral <b>planting</b> <b>method,</b> the results of a screen or block will be visible at eye level from the start, and full functionality will be reached after 8 - 13 years. With the traditional method, it appears to be almost impossible to realise free-standing forms, in practice as well as in simulation during the growth curve survey. Empirical research of the Prince Bernhard forest, which was developed according to the integral <b>planting</b> <b>method,</b> shows that the head start of the larger initial sizes of the free-standing forms in this method provides the visitor with an increased sense of security because of the openness of the plant structure and the fact that this method leads to a completed planting structure in a shorter period of time. In addition, the comparison shows that the construction costs using the integral <b>planting</b> <b>method</b> are about double the costs using the traditional <b>planting</b> <b>method.</b> However, the maintenance costs for free-standing forms when the integral <b>planting</b> <b>method</b> has been applied are so low, that cost recovery will occur within a foreseeable period, as compared with the traditional <b>planting</b> <b>method</b> (urban variant). The integral <b>planting</b> <b>method</b> can be applied to small- and large-scale urban and small-scale rural park projects. For large-scale rural projects application of the integral <b>planting</b> <b>method</b> requires further investigation of the relation between architectural functions of planting structures and forest ecology and forest management. Tree nurseries will need to put more effort into the methods for breeding and planting larger plant material. Some growers already guarantee that their plants will start growing immediately after planting and they offer care and maintenance of these larger inital sizes of trees and shrubs for a maintenance period of 10 years and longer...|$|E
