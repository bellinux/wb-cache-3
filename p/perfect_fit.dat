5|$|By 1931, {{more than}} 80percent of the {{services}} offered by industrial laundries were sold to individual families. However, as the Great Depression continued, many people {{could no longer afford}} the services, and business declined. The decline continued after World War II when electric washers and dryers meant for home use became affordable to {{a large percentage of the}} populace. As individual customers disappeared, factory laundries turned to specialized services such as washing diapers or linens. In 1950, the American Linen Supply Company bought the Yale Laundry Company. In 1959, <b>Perfect</b> <b>Fit</b> Manufacturing began to use the building to make auto seat covers, tire covers, and other automotive fabrics. <b>Perfect</b> <b>Fit</b> remained in the building through 2006.|$|E

The base layer was made of a polyester mesh that is utilized by the military and high-tech sports manufacturers because of its breathability and moisture-wicking properties. Molded pieces of flexible urethane were then attached to the mesh, to form the overall body armor plating. Carbon fiber panels were placed inside the sections on the legs, chest and abdomen.

Credit derivatives market has grown rapidly in recent years in response to the growing need for transferring and hedging credit risk. Growing innovations in this market has made understanding these products more urgent than ever. Various models have been developed to understand the role of default correlation on the prices of such products referencing a portfolio of underlying assets. A method for pricing these correlation products that has become standard is based on the Gaussian copula. There are some well known shortcomings in this approach.

Kennedy was a <b>perfect</b> <b>fit</b> into coach Hap Day's emphasis on defense and positional play. He gained a reputation for scoring the important goal and excelling in the playoffs. Kennedy holds the Toronto Maple Leafs' all-time record for career points in the Stanley Cup Finals and is the youngest player in the history of the NHL to have scored a Stanley Cup winning goal.

40|$|This article empirically {{studies the}} pricing kernel {{implicit}} in option prices.

A cubic pricing kernel provides almost <b>perfect</b> <b>fits</b> in the sample. Nonlinearity in the pricing kernel is crucial for in-sample performance. Both excess kurtosis and skewness are very important. The claim-based market line sharply distinguishes various estimates of the pricing kernel and tracks the market sentiment.

With a well-specified factor dynamics model, the linear pricing kernel beats the other competitors at a 2 -week horizon. ...|$|R

On August 16, 1996, the Republican Party chose Kemp as its vice presidential , running alongside former Senator Dole. Kemp {{was seen as}} a means to attract conservative and libertarian-minded voters like those of tough nomination-challengers Forbes and Pat Buchanan. Kemp was chosen over Connie Mack, John McCain, and Carroll Campbell, and it is assumed that this was partly because Kemp had several former staffers in influential positions as Dole's senior advisors. Dole had had a long history of representing the budget-balancing faction of the Party, while Kemp had had a long history of representing the tax-cutting advocates, and Kemp's tax-cutting fiscal track record was seen as the <b>perfect</b> <b>fit</b> for the ticket.

Many of the numerical results differ substantially from the corresponding quantities in a smaller inhomogeneous CDS portfolio. Furthermore, the studies indicate that market CDO spreads imply extreme default clustering in upper tranches. The default contagion is introduced by letting individual intensities jump when other defaults occur, but be constant between defaults. The model is translated into a Markov jump process.
