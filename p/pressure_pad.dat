5|$|Alongside his {{theatrical}} career, Barrowman {{has appeared}} in various films including the musical biopic De-Lovely (2004) and musical comedy The Producers (2005). Before venturing into British television, he featured in the American television dramas Titans and Central Park West but he is better known for his acting and presenting work for the BBC that includes his work for CBBC in its earlier years, his self-produced entertainment programme Tonight's the Night, and his BAFTA Cymru-nominated role of Captain Jack Harkness in the science fiction series Doctor Who and Torchwood. Barrowman has also {{had a number of}} guest roles in television programmes both in the US and the UK. He appeared as a contestant on the first series of celebrity ice skating show Dancing on Ice while his theatrical background allowed him to become a judge on Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical talent shows How Do You Solve a Problem like Maria?, Any Dream Will Do and I'd Do Anything. In 2006, he was voted Stonewall's Entertainer of the Year. Starting in 2013, he hosts the BBC One quiz show <b>Pressure</b> <b>Pad.</b> Barrowman starred in the CW's Arrow and Legends of Tomorrow as Malcolm Merlyn, the show's version of the DC villain Merlyn and one of the two series' main antagonists.|$|E

40|$|Fuer die Untersuchung des Kompaktierungsverhaltens von Salzgrus, das in den deutschen Endlagerkonzepten eine wichtige Rolle als Versatzmaterial fuer die Resthohlraeume spielt, wurde eine triaxiale Messeinrichtung entwickelt und in Betrieb genommen. Ihre Pruefkammer weist einen wuerfelfoermigen Innenraum mit einer Kantenlaenge von 250 mm auf. Sie ist fuer eine {{maximale}} Druckbelastung von 35 MPa ausgelegt. Die Druckbelastung des Pruefmaterials und die Messung der Verformung erfolgt unabhaengig in den 3 Raumrichtungen ueber 6 an den Innenwaenden der Pruefkammer angeordnete hydraulische Druckkissen aus Edelstahlblech, die fuer jede Messung erneuert werden. Der Hydraulikteil fuer die Beaufschlagung der Druckkissen ist primaer fuer druckgeregelte Versuche (Kriechversuche) ausgelegt, jedoch koennen auch wegegeregelte Versuche durchgefuehrt werden. Die Bestimmung der den Druckkissen zugefuehrten Mengen an Hydraulikfluessigkeit erfolgt mit hoher Genauigkeit, so dass damit die Messung sehr kleiner Verformungsraten, wie sie in einem Endlager in einer Steinsalzformation zu erwarten sind (ca. 10 "-" 9 /s), moeglich ist. Eine zusaetzliche Messung der Verformungsraten mit Hilfe von induktiven Wegaufnehmern, die die zentrale Auslenkung der Druckkissen erfassen, ist in Erprobung. Bei Raumtemperatur durchgefuehrte Testmessungen belegen die Funktionstuechtigkeit der Messeinrichtung. Die Ergebnisse von Messungen der zeitabhaengigen Kompaktierung bzw. Verformung von Salzgrus bei verschiedenen hydrostatischen und deviatorischen Spannungszustaenden (3 - 17 MPa) und Endlager-relevanten Kompaktierungsraten werden dargestellt. Erste Versuche bei Temperaturen bis 150 C zeigten, dass die ungeschuetzten Druckissen auf Grund des am Pruefmaterial adsorptiv gebundenen Wassers sehr schnell durch Salzlaugenkorrosion angegriffen werden und undicht werden. Mit der Entwicklung eines wirksamen Korrosionsschutzes fuer die Druckkissen wurde begonnen. (orig. /HP) A triaxial {{testing apparatus}} {{has been developed}} for {{the investigation of the}} consolidation behaviour of crushed salt which plays an important role as a backfill material in German disposal plant concepts. The apparatus has a cubic testing volume of 250 mm side length and is designed for a maximum pressure loading of 35 MPa. The stress loading of the test material and the measurement of the strains are performed independently in the 3 spatial directions witth the aid of 6 hydraulic <b>pressure</b> <b>pads</b> mounted at the walls of the testing volume. The <b>pressure</b> <b>pads</b> are made of stainless steel sheets. They are replaced for each new experiment. The hydraulic device for the supply of the <b>pressure</b> <b>pads</b> is primarily designed for pressure controlled experiments (creep tests), but displacement controlled tests can be performed too. The amounts of hydraulic liquid supplied to the <b>pressure</b> <b>pads</b> are registrated with high accuracy, such that very low consolidation rates can be measured as they are expected to occur in nuclear waste repositories in salt formations (about 10 "-" 9 /s). An additional technique for the measurement of the stain rates is installed and is being tested. Here the central deformation of the <b>pressure</b> <b>pads</b> is registrated with the aid of 6 inductive linear displacement gages. Several tests performed at room temperature have demonstrated the functioning of the apparatus. It is reported about the results of measurements of the time dependent consolidation and deformation at various hydrostatic and deviatoric stress states (3 - 17 MPa) and at consolidation rates comparable to repository conditions. First tests performed at elevated temperatures (150 C) have shown that due to the presence of adsorbed water in the test material the unprotected <b>pressure</b> <b>pads</b> are rapidly attacked by brine corrosion and get untight. Experiments with a corrosion protection for the <b>pressure</b> <b>pads</b> are under way.

5000|$|A {{cassette}} tape {{contains a}} [...] "pressure pad" [...] of some type, usually made of felt (...) [...] This pad {{is within the}} cassette tape shell (located just behind the tape opening) and opposes the magnetic head of the cassette deck, providing pressure against the head(s) when the tape is being played. Nakamichi found that this pad provided uneven and fairly inaccurate pressure and was therefore inadequate for reliable tape/head contact. Furthermore, Nakamichi found that the <b>pressure</b> <b>pad</b> {{was a source of}} audible noise, particularly scrape flutter (the tape bouncing across the head, a result of uneven pressure), and also contributed to premature head wear. Nakamichi's dual-capstan tape decks provide such accurate and precise tape tension that, unlike other decks, the cassette's <b>pressure</b> <b>pad</b> is not needed at all. To remedy this problem, the vast majority of Nakamichi dual-capstan decks contain a [...] "cage" [...] around the record/playback heads that lifts the <b>pressure</b> <b>pad</b> out of the way so that the deck itself—specifically, the dual capstan mechanism—is able to maintain much more consistent tape tension and tape/head contact during playback.|$|E

Three patients who underwent augmented trabeculectomy with mitomycin C with early bleb leak between January 2009 and June 2010 were reviewed. Case 1 and Case 2 exhibited bleb leak on postoperative Day 1 and Case 3 showed leak on follow-up at postoperative Day 7. Case 1 was successfully sealed with CATG at postoperative Day 3, after failed <b>pressure</b> <b>padding</b> and bandage contact lens. Case 2 was successfully sealed with CATG at postoperative Day 3, after failed <b>pressure</b> <b>padding</b> and conjunctiva flap resuturing. In Case 3, the leaking conjunctival flap was managed with combined techniques of resuturing and applying CATG at postoperative Day 9, after failed <b>pressure</b> <b>padding.</b> During leakage, the intraocular pressure was low (6 – 8 mmHg) {{in all three}} cases, with shallow anterior chamber depth and absence of other complications such as choroidal detachment, hypotony maculopathy, or endophthalmitis. Foreign body sensation was the main complaint following the procedure. No clinical allergy reaction was documented.

In this study, the effects of U-geometry parameters, including channel width, bend angle, material thickness, tool radius, as well as workpiece length, and their design, were investigated using a combination of finite element method (FEM) simulation, and statistical analysis techniques. Based on stress distribution analyses, the FEM simulation results clearly identified the different bending mechanisms and effects of U-geometry parameters on the spring-back characteristic in the U-bending process, with and without <b>pressure</b> <b>pads.</b> The statistical analyses elucidated that the bend angle and channel width have a major influence in cases with and without <b>pressure</b> <b>pads,</b> respectively.

40|$|In this {{prospective}} study, {{the effectiveness}} and biomechanical factors of spinal orthoses {{in the treatment}} of moderate adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) patients were investigated. In the first 20 months of orthotic treatment, the values of standing AP Cobb's angle, apical vertebral rotation, lumbar lordosis as well as thoracic kyphosis showed significant reduction (P< 0. 05), however, the angle of trunk inclination and trunk listing did not. The values of those reducible parameters reached their lowest values within the first 12 months of orthotic treatment and then the values gradually increased but they were still below the pre‐brace values. The mean pressure of The <b>pressure</b> <b>pads</b> was found to be 7. 09 ± 1. 77 kPa (53. 2 ± 13. 3 mmHg) while the mean tension of the straps was 26. 8 ± 5. 2 N. The standing AP Cobb's angle strongly correlated with the <b>pad</b> <b>pressure</b> (correlation coefficient= 0. 931, p< 0. 05) and strap tension (correlation coefficient= 0. 914, p< 0. 05). The strap tension and <b>pad</b> <b>pressure</b> strongly correlated and the correlation coefficient was 0. 873 (p< 0. 05). This suggests that in the consideration of biomechanical function of spinal orthoses, the focus may be upon how tightly the orthosis was fastened and if the location and direction of the <b>pressure</b> <b>pads</b> are correct. Therefore, for enhancing the effectiveness of orthotic treatment, an independent standard tension should be set in each strap, and regular and close monitoring is needed.
