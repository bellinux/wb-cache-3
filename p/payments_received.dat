25|$|Pass-through {{securities}} {{are issued}} by a trust and allocate the cash {{flows from the}} underlying pool to the securities holders on a pro rata basis. A trust that issues pass-through certificates is taxed under the grantor trust rules of the Internal Revenue Code. Under these rules, the holder of a pass-through certificate is taxed as a direct owner of {{the portion of the}} trust allocatable to the certificate. In order for the issuer to be recognized as a trust for tax purposes, there can be no significant power under the trust agreement to change the composition of the asset pool or otherwise to reinvest <b>payments</b> <b>received,</b> and the trust must have, with limited exceptions, only a single class of ownership interests.|$|E

25|$|On August 17, 2007, Dell Inc. {{announced}} that after {{an internal investigation}} into its accounting practices it would restate and reduce earnings from 2003 through to {{the first quarter of}} 2007 by a total amount of $50–150 million, or 2 cents to 7 cents per share. The investigation, begun in November 2006, resulted from concerns raised by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over some documents and information that Dell Inc. had submitted. It was alleged that Dell had not disclosed large exclusivity <b>payments</b> <b>received</b> from Intel for agreeing not to buy processors from rival manufacturer Advanced Micro Devices. In 2010, Dell paid $100 million to settle the SEC's charges of fraud. Michael Dell and other executives also paid penalties and suffered other sanctions, without admitting or denying the charges.|$|E
500|$|In 2008, the SEIU {{would shift}} {{part of its}} focus from attacking private equity firms {{directly}} toward the highlighting the role of sovereign wealth funds in private equity. [...] The SEIU pushed legislation in California that would disallow investments by state agencies (particularly CalPERS and CalSTRS) in firms with ties to certain sovereign wealth funds. [...] Additionally, the SEIU has attempted to criticize the treatment of taxation of carried interest. [...] The SEIU, and other critics, point out that many wealthy private equity investors pay taxes at lower rates (because {{the majority of their}} income is derived from carried interest, <b>payments</b> <b>received</b> from the profits on a private equity fund's investments) than many of the rank and file employees of a private equity ...|$|E
500|$|The {{controversy}} rumbled on {{and there}} was a long debate in the press through the winter of 1878–79 about the various <b>payments</b> <b>received</b> by the [...] "amateurs" [...] of Gloucestershire. The enquiry at Gloucestershire CCC took place in January 1879. W. G. and E. M. Grace were forced to answer charges that they had claimed [...] "exorbitant expenses", {{one of the few times}} that their money-making activity was seriously challenged. The claim had been submitted to Surrey re the controversial 1878 match in which Billy Midwinter was brought in as a late replacement, but Surrey refused to pay it and this provoked the enquiry. The Graces managed to survive [...] "a protracted and stormy meeting" [...] with E. M. retaining his key post as club secretary, although he was forced to liaise in future with a new finance committee and abide by stricter rules. The incident served to highlight an ongoing issue about the nominal amateur status of the Grace brothers. Like all amateur players, they claimed expenses for travel and accommodation to and from cricket matches, but there is plenty of evidence that the Graces made rather more money by playing than their basic expenses would allow and W. G. in particular [...] "made more than any professional".|$|E

2500|$|Currently, {{under the}} rules {{governing}} monetary operations of major central banks (including the central bank of the United States), seigniorage on bank notes is simply defined as the interest <b>payments</b> <b>received</b> by central banks on {{the total amount of}} currency issued. [...] This usually takes the form of interest payments on treasury bonds purchased by central banks, putting more dollars into circulation. [...] However, if the currency is collected, or is otherwise taken permanently out of circulation, the back end of the deal never occurs (that is, the currency is never returned to the central bank). Thus the issuer of the currency keeps the whole seigniorage profit, by not having to buy worn out issued currency back at face value.|$|E
2500|$|The {{political}} groups which supported violence {{were referred to}} as [...] "non-constitutional". [...] Chief amongst them was Provisional Sinn Féin (now referred to as [...] "Sinn Féin") – the political arm of the Provisional IRA. The weekly [...] republican newspaper An Phoblacht carried reports highlighting what it saw as naked state oppression. In its editorials An Phoblacht referred to the UDR as, [...] "not Dad's Army but a sectarian militia". To help emphasise their message they produced posters which supporters pasted over walls in Republican areas such as [...] "The Loyalist Murderers" [...] and [...] "Blood Money," [...] referring to the redundancy <b>payments</b> <b>received</b> by former UDR soldiers still serving with the Royal Irish Regiment {{at the end of}} Operation Banner [...] (The official army title for operations in Northern Ireland).|$|E
2500|$|There {{are various}} risks {{involved}} with master trusts specifically. One {{risk is that}} timing of cash flows promised to investors might be different from timing of payments on the receivables. [...] For example, credit card-backed securities can have maturities of up to 10 years, but credit card-backed receivables usually pay off much more quickly. To solve this issue these securities typically have a revolving period, an accumulation period, and an amortization period. [...] All three of these periods are based on historical experience of the receivables. During the revolving period, principal <b>payments</b> <b>received</b> on the credit card balances are used to purchase additional receivables. During the accumulation period, these payments are accumulated in a separate account. During the amortization period, new payments are passed through to the investors.|$|E

He also argued that his wife's [...] "salary was perfectly justified", adding that everything reported by the press on the issue was [...] "legal and transparent". He said he would not reimburse the <b>payments</b> <b>received</b> by his wife or children, and, saying that he had [...] "nothing to hide", divulged his property holdings. In addition to promising that his lawyers would question the competency of the PNF to carry out the investigation, he lambasted a [...] "media lynching" [...] of his campaign. His remarks followed Juppé's declaration that [...] "NO means NO" [...] earlier in the day in response to rumors that he might replace Fillon as the party's candidate should he decide to drop his bid.|$|E

50|$|A common {{approach}} taken {{by insurance companies}} is to take 100% of regular premiums, being the annual premiums received for a policy, and 10% of single premiums.
