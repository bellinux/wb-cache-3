40|$|The present paper {{seeks to}} {{delineate}} how female revisits and reformulates her Image through artistic discourse (Literary) {{by taking the}} case study of the female writings in the novel The Blind Assassin of Margaret Atwood. It elaborates on the vicissitudes of life of Iris, the female protagonist of Atwood. She appropriates her voice to fight back against the oppressive patriarchal forces that are instrumental in her harassment and subordination. The proposed study is significant as it focuses on how retelling {{of the history of}} the ‘self’ through artistic discourse pushes the ‘self’ to the centre and in turn, it is recognised as Subject. The methodology applied in the present study is analytical and deconstructive. Extant feminist literary theories have also been contrasted contextually. The study endeavours to show that women have been capable of identifying their unique potential and their writing back can overthrow patriarchal hegemony. Iris, by conquering her body and then writing from it, defeats her silence and deconstructs her identity over the social structure, which prioritizes and propagates binary division of male/female and in which the female is always the ‘other’. Atwood destabilizes and deconstructs the gendered identity prevalent for women so farby letting the protagonist write <b>her</b> memoir which <b>paves</b> <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> transcend from the passive, subordinate position of victim to that of assertive, independent subject. The voice that emanates while writing from the body has made explicit so many truths that otherwise would have remained unnoticed, hence reconfiguring Self...|$|R
