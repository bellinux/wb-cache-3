40|$|In {{the past}} decades, the spatial {{structure}} of metropolitan areas has progressively changed towards a more <b>polycentric</b> <b>structure.</b> Many researchers have studied this <b>polycentric</b> <b>structure</b> {{in the context}} of North American and European metropolitans by identifying sub-centers, mainly using two methods which are analyzing the employment or population density or mobility data. In spite of huge effort in identifying sub-centers, fewer studies characterize the identified sub-centers and classify them based on their patterns and features simultaneously. And this research will identify sub-centers and then classify them as well. Following the introduction of polycentricity and a review of previous methodologies for identification and classification of sub-centers, this study introduces two different algorithms: flow-based and distance-based for identifying sub-centers based on passenger flows data at public transport stations. In addition, the study presents the classification process of identified clusters based on time-dependent passenger flows data. Temporal profiles of each cluster are created and used to describe their characteristics, and then classification is conducted based on hierarchical clustering analysis. As a case study, the emergence of <b>polycentric</b> <b>structure</b> in Stockholm County is analyzed using public transport passenger flows at each station including metros, commuter trains, buses and light rails. After comparing results of the two proposed algorithms, the distance-based is chosen for Stockholm case. The identification algorithm yields 17 clusters. These 17 clusters are then classified using three different indicators based on flow data by time intervals. As a result, we have three classification results. Finally, the classification results are analyzed and synthesized by considering the urban environment of clusters and their roles in transport network, providing a comprehensive interpretation of resulted clusters. Clusters are classified into seven more general classes of center, business, residential, hub or combinations of them. The result suggests that each cluster is associated with distinctive functions and they are all active, unlike ‘’sleeping towns’’, however, clusters in the inner city are still able to generate and attract more flows and flows are still more concentrated in the central part, indicating the aim to release pressure from central part by <b>polycentric</b> <b>structure</b> hasn’t been fully achieved yet...|$|E

The concept of accessibility may provide a useful conceptual framework for this interaction.

Fractal dimensions can be used as indicators of urban sprawl, of the degree of fragmentation of the urban landscape and of the transition from monocentric to <b>polycentric</b> <b>structures.</b> The exploration of the above notions is based on the application of the models on an area at the outskirts of Thessaloniki, Greece.

The {{aim of this study}} is to verify if urban morphology reflects the transition from a mono-centric and hyper-compact form centred on Barcelona (Spain) towards a polycentric agglomeration based on subcentres functionally distinct from the head city. The spatial distribution of impervious land by municipal unit has been investigated under three spatial domains (province, metropolitan region and metropolitan area of Barcelona). Soil sealing indicators have been analysed using descriptive, inferential and multivariate statistical techniques. Sealing intensity and diversification decreased with the distance from the centre of Barcelona, while per-capita sealed land was low in the central city and much higher and stable in peripheral municipalities.

However, most modeling approaches, including those based on complex network theory, do not fully account for real-life traffic patterns and may provide an incomplete view of network functions.

A directed weighted passenger flow network was constructed from the subway infrastructure network topology by incorporating trip data. The passenger flow networks exhibit several properties that can be characterized by power-law distributions based on flow size, and log-logistic distributions based on the fraction of boarding and departing passengers. The study also characterizes the temporal patterns of in-transit and waiting passengers and provides a hierarchical clustering structure for passenger flows. This hierarchical flow organization varies in the spatial domain. Ten cluster groups were identified, indicating a hierarchical urban <b>polycentric</b> <b>structure</b> composed of large concentrated flows at urban activity centers.

In {{the last}} twenty years, urban areas have {{experienced}} strong but heterogeneous sprawl {{which led to the}} <b>structuring</b> of <b>polycentric</b> <b>structures</b> (Anas, Arnott and Small, 1998). The links between urban sprawl and travel behaviour have already been the focus of much research, however the specific impact of urban polycentrism is still relatively unknown in Europe (Schwanen, Dieleman and Dijst, 2002). This motivated the setting up of a research programme on the interrelationship between polycentrism and commuting through the study of seven urban areas i 1, {{on the basis of the}} INSEE (French National Institute for Statistics) Census of 1990 and 1999.

This paper tackles {{the problem of}} defining and measuring polycentricity under an integrated and multi- dimensional perspective. Firstly, the policy relevance of polycentricity is analysed. Then, the paper identifes the definitions and measures of polycentricity by surveying the literature. It also provides a taxonomy among two main aspects involved {{in the definition of}} polycentricity: the morphological dimension and the functional dimension. Based on this background, an empirical analysis is carried out, by using data about population and commuting flows in the Tuscany Region (Italy).

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{intractable}} debates {{in the field of}} world politics concerns the linkage of systemic structure to international conflict. The dialogue has focused on the relative merits of bipolar versus multipolar and, more recently, <b>polycentric</b> <b>structures.</b> Advocates of each System have their adherents and, for some time now, have agreed to disagree. Most of the debate over structure and conflict thus far has been cast in terms that do not facilitate its resolution. The objective {{of this study is to}} work toward a more compelling empirical judgment of the competing claims. Specifically, that involves revision of the central concepts. Structure cannot be assessed only in terms of distribution of power; the concept also should incorporate the notion of autonomous decision centres. With respect to conflict, most commonly referred to as instability, war is held to be a less comprehensive measurement than international crisis. Renewed testing focuses on the linkage of structure to conflict as so defined. Data from the International Crisis Behaviour Project on 280 cases from 1929 to 1979 provide the evidence to compare the phases of structure. The differences that emerge among multipolarity, bipolarity and polycentrism with respect to patterns of conflict are generally consistent with theoretical expectations...|$|R
40|$|In the European context, Spain has a {{consolidated}} trajectory in {{the study}} of polycentrism; {{a number of studies have}} identified, measured and created new methods to identify subcenters. Polycentrism has been widely studied from the morphological and functional perspective, both intra-metropolitan and regional scales. However, little or no attention has been put to the impact of <b>polycentric</b> <b>structures</b> on the efficiency of urbanisation. In this paper, we explore the relationship between polycentricity and labor mobility. Starting from the mobility matrix contained in the Population Census and some previous studies, we have built a series of indicators to measure the incidence of polycentricity on the distances travelled by the working population. In addition, once the structure of the spatial distribution of employment and population has been controlled by the algorithm of M. White 1988, we study, using a statistical model, the relationship between the excess of labor mobility and different urban indicators. The results show that polycentricity effectively reduces mobility, at the time that other obvious urban attributes such as infrastructures (both intended for cars and public transportations) and other planning features, such as the employment to housing ratio and the specialisation in manufacturing, increase it. Conversely, the diversity of housing reduces mobility. These findings show clear implications for urban policies. Postprint (published version...|$|R
