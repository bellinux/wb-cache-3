40|$|AbstractThe {{cytokine}} macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is inducibly secreted by {{immune cells}} and certain other cell types to critically {{participate in the}} regulation of the host immune response. However, MIF does not contain a N-terminal signal sequence and the mechanism of MIF secretion is unknown. Here we show in a model of endotoxin-stimulated THP- 1 monocytes that MIF does not enter the endoplasmatic reticulum and that MIF secretion is not inhibited by monensin or brefeldin A, demonstrating that MIF secretion occurs via a non-classical export route. Glyburide and <b>probenicide</b> but not other typical inhibitors of non-classical protein export strongly block MIF secretion, indicating that the export pathway of MIF involves an ABCA 1 transporter...|$|E
