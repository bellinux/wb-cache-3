50|$|Magnetostrictive {{position}} sensors use the Wiedemann {{effect to}} excite an ultrasonic pulse. Typically a small magnet {{is used to}} mark a position along a magnetostrictive wire. The magnetic field from a short current pulse in the wire combined with that from the <b>position</b> <b>magnet</b> excites the ultrasonic pulse. The time required for this pulse to travel {{from the point of}} excitation to a pickup {{at the end of the}} wire gives the position. Reflections from the other end of the wire could lead to disturbances. In order to avoid this the wire is connected to a mechanical damper that end.|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, the {{electromagnetic}} shunt damper was newly developed to passively suppress the vibration of the flexible cantilever beams. The electromagnetic shunt damper, which is electro-mechanically {{coupled with the}} flexible structures, simply consists of a coil, a permanent magnet, and an R-L-C circuit. The ends of the conductive coil {{are connected to the}} R-L-C series shunt circuit and the battery as well. The aim of electronic magnetic shunt damper is to achieve the damping effect. This effect is affected by the position of the conductor and magnet. The data was record by using the DAQ cable and Accelerometer. The position of the magnet which is {{at the bottom of the}} coil does not able to induce the damping effect. Since then it has been replaced by spherical conductor by placed inside the coil. Present results show that {{the electromagnetic}} shunt damper can be successfully applied to reduce the vibration of the flexible structures. The vibration and damping characteristics of the flexible beams with the electromagnetic shunt damper were investigated by tuning the circuit parameters. The change in value of resistor, voltage, and capacitor were investigated towards the effect of damping characteristic. There are four different of resistor, three different of voltage, and three different of capacitors were employed to study this effect. The vibration of the flexible beam was reduced most with R= 1. 5 Ohm, V= 9 V, C = 2000 µF. With this tuning, the vibration of the flexible beam was reducing up to 91. 6 %. The data will be more significant if the disturbance employed on the aluminium plate in harmonic motions. This can achieve by using Mechanical Shaker machine. The magnet can use to induce the eddy current if the <b>position</b> <b>magnet</b> is placed inside the coil...|$|E

Various methods were developed to improve the angular displacement of the scanner while maintaining the scanner frequency. However the effects of rotor <b>magnet</b> radial <b>position</b> on scanner characteristics were not well investigated. In this study, {{the relationships between the}} <b>magnet</b> <b>position</b> and the scanner characteristics such as natural frequency, angular displacement and stress level were studied.

40|$|The superparamagnetic {{properties}} of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) {{allow them to}} be guided by an externally <b>positioned</b> <b>magnet</b> and also provide contrast for MRI. However, their therapeutic use in treating CNS pathologies in vivo is limited by insufficient local accumulation and retention resulting from their inability to traverse biological barriers. The combined use of focused ultrasound and magnetic targeting synergistically delivers therapeutic MNPs across the blood–brain barrier to enter the brain both passively and actively. Therapeutic MNPs were characterized and evaluated both in vitro and in vivo, and MRI was used to monitor and quantify their distribution in vivo. The technique could be used in normal brains or in those with tumors, and significantly increased the deposition of therapeutic MNPs in brains with intact or compromised blood–brain barriers.

40|$|The NASA Langley 6 -inch Magnetic Suspension and Balance System (6 -in. MSBS) {{requires}} an independently controlled bidirectional dc power source {{for each of}} six positioning electromagnets. These electromagnets provide five-degree-of-freedom control over a suspended aerodynamic test model. Existing power equipment, which employs resistance-coupled thyratron-controlled rectifiers as well as ac to dc motor-generator converters, is obsolete, inefficient, and unreliable. A replacement six-phase bidirectional controlled bridge rectifier is proposed, which employs power MOSFET switches sequenced by hybrid analog/digital circuits. Full-load efficiency is 80 percent compared with 25 percent for the resistance-coupled thyratron system. Current feedback provides high control linearity, adjustable current limiting, and current overload protection. A quenching circuit suppresses inductive voltage impulses.

This article proves the possibility of magnetic field influence on individual construction parts of a positioning mechanism. The {{first part of the}} article deals with the problem of magnetic surface levitation of diamagnetic object and with the description of principle of mechatronic positioning mechanism.

40|$|The {{smoothness}} of a beam line {{refers to}} the quality of the relative positioning of a number of adjacent beam guiding components. The fact that smoothness is of highest priority when <b>positioning</b> <b>magnets</b> can be seen in the local tolerances imposed by the beam optics. In the past, smoothing has been done by separating horizontal and vertical misalignments and then applying some sort of analytical or manual ''feathering'' technique. The Stanford Linear Collider (SLC) did not easily lend itself to this sort of smoothing because of the highly coupled nature of its pitched and rolled beam line. This paper will discuss an attempt to develop a repeatable method which is independent of the inconsistencies of human judgment and can simultaneously smooth in two or more dimensions. Four major goals were defined for the smoothing algorithm used on the SLC alignment. The first, was to simultaneously model errors for both horizontal and vertical directions. Secondly, a smooth curve whose shape was suggested by the data and not by a predetermined model was implied by the fact that unknown systematic errors were being eliminated. Thirdly, this curve must be a reproducibly fit, independent of the inconsistent nature of human judgment. Fourth, the result of the procedure was to minimize the number and size of magnet movements to reach the final alignment criteria...|$|R
