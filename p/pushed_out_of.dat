The 8th Squadron, leading the regiment, was moving around to the north of village, when the Turkish defenders opened fire on them. The regiment galloped forward, and one of their troops captured fifty prisoners at a police post. The remainder captured an uncompleted trench system, and another 171 prisoners, six of them German officers. The regiment was now position to block the Turkish withdrawal east, and were also able to observe the main Turkish defences.|$|E

5|$|In March 1944, when Hungary {{realised}} {{that it was}} on {{the losing}} side in the war and began to negotiate with the Allies, Germany took control of the country, including the annexed territories, during Operation Margarethe I. This was followed by the collection and transport of the remaining Jews in the occupied territories to extermination camps, resulting in the deaths of 85 per cent of the Jews in the occupied territories. Prior to their withdrawal from the Balkans {{in the face of the}} advance of the Soviet Red Army, the Germans evacuated 60,000–70,000 Volksdeutsche from Bačka and Baranja to Austria. Bačka and Baranja were restored to Yugoslav control when the Germans were <b>pushed</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the region by the Red Army in late 1944.

5|$|In May, General Gaskin began {{planning}} to retake {{the city of}} Karmah, which sat astride a main supply route between Fallujah and Baghdad and was an important insurgent stronghold. Unlike other locales, Karmah had no definable perimeter, making it easy for outsiders to access, as when insurgents fled to Karmah after being <b>pushed</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Baghdad. Gaskin sent one of his aides to Jordan to meet with Sheikh Mishan, head of Karmah's largest tribe, the Jumayli. Sheikh Mishan fled to Jordan in 2005 after receiving threats from AQI. Gaskin's aide was able to persuade the sheikh to return in June, partnered with 2nd Battalion 5th Marines. By October, insurgent attacks had dropped to almost zero.|$|E

5|$|The dreaded North Vietnamese wet season {{offensive}} (Campaign Z) {{began on}} 17 December 1971. The multi-division offensive was commanded by Major General Le Trong Tan, who had commanded the PAVN counteroffensive against Operation Lam Son 719. Once again the communists rolled across the Plain of Jars {{and to the}} outskirts of Long Tieng. This time however, they had brought along a battery of 130mm artillery, which proceeded to pummel the defenders. By 17 January 1972, reinforcement by Unity troops and strikes by B-52s had driven the PAVN from the high ground surrounding the valley, but they could not be <b>pushed</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the area. General Tan then shifted the focus of his forces to the southwest and seized Sam Thong on 18 March. The fighting around Long Tieng did not cease until 28 April.|$|E
5|$|The lungs {{of mammals}} are spongy and honeycombed. Breathing is mainly {{achieved}} with the diaphragm, which divides the thorax from the abdominal cavity, forming a dome convex to the thorax. Contraction of the diaphragm flattens the dome, increasing {{the volume of}} the lung cavity. Air enters through the oral and nasal cavities, and travels through the larynx, trachea and bronchi, and expands the alveoli. Relaxing the diaphragm has the opposite effect, decreasing {{the volume of the}} lung cavity, causing air to be <b>pushed</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the lungs. During exercise, the abdominal wall contracts, increasing pressure on the diaphragm, which forces air out quicker and more forcefully. The rib cage is able to expand and contract the chest cavity through the action of other respiratory muscles. Consequently, air is sucked into or expelled out of the lungs, always moving down its pressure gradient. This type of lung is known as a bellows lung due to its resemblance to blacksmith bellows.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, X Corps, with the 7th Infantry Division and 1st Marine Division, {{attacked}} Incheon, striking the North Korean army from the rear.

The 24th Infantry Division advanced to Songju, then to Seoul. The Army advanced {{north along the}} west coast of Korea through October. By mid-October, the North Korean Army had been almost completely destroyed, and US President Harry S. Truman ordered General MacArthur to advance all units into North Korea as quickly as possible to end the war. The 24th Infantry Division, with the South Korean 1st Infantry Division, moved to the left flank of the advancing Eighth Army, and moved north along Korea's west coast. The 24th Division then moved north to Chongju. On 1 November, the division's 21st Infantry captured Chonggodo, 18 miles from the Yalu River and Korea's border with China. Units of the Eighth Army and X Corps spread out as they attempted to reach the Yalu and complete the conquest of North Korea as quickly as possible.|$|E

5|$|In 1796, Klenau {{commanded}} the advance guard of Peter Quasdanovich's right column in northern Italy. As the column {{descended from the}} Alps at the city of Brescia, reconnaissance found the local French garrison unprepared. At midnight, Klenau led two squadrons of the 8th Hussar Regiment Wurmser (named for its Colonel-Proprietor Dagobert von Wurmser), a battalion of the 37th Infantry Regiment De Vins, and one company of the Mahony Jäger. With their approach masked by fog and darkness, the small force surprised the Brescia garrison {{on the morning of}} 30 July, capturing not only the 600–700 French soldiers stationed there, but also three officials of the French Directory: Jean Lannes, Joachim Murat, and François Étienne de Kellermann. However, within two days, Klenau's force had to face Napoleon Bonaparte and 12,000 Frenchmen; his small advance guard was quickly <b>pushed</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Brescia on 1 August. At the subsequent Battle of Lonato of 2–3 August 1796, the French forced Quasdanovich's column to withdraw into the mountains. This isolated Quasdanovich's force from Wurmser's main army by Lake Garda, and freed the French to concentrate on the main force at Castiglione delle Stiviere, further south; Bonaparte's victory at the Battle of Castiglione forced Wurmser across the Mincio River, and allowed the French to return to the siege of Mantua.|$|E

Devin Hester {{attempted}} to respond on the ensuing kickoff, but was <b>pushed</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> bounds at the Vikings' 32-yard line. The Bears fought back with a one-yard touchdown pass by Jay Cutler to Martellus Bennett, which Chicago added to with Cutler's touchdown pass to Brandon Marshall. In the second quarter, Jared Allen stripped the ball from Cutler, and Brian Robison returned the fumble 61 {{yards for a touchdown}} with 7:34 to go in the half. Afterwards, Hester returned the kickoff 80 yards to Minnesota's 23-yard line. The Bears offense later reached Minnesota's one-yard line, but Cutler had his pass intercepted by Kevin Williams in the end zone for a touchback. The Vikings failed to capitalize on the turnover after Tim Jennings intercepted Christian Ponder and scored on a 44-yard interception return. Minnesota retaliated with Ponder's 20-yard touchdown pass to Kyle Rudolph with 1:11 remaining, and the half ended with the Bears settling for a field goal. In the second half, the Vikings scored two field goals from Blair Walsh to take the 30–24 lead. However, the Bears scored on Cutler's 16-yard touchdown pass to Bennett, and ultimately prevailed after recovering a fumbled squib kick.|$|E
5|$|The first {{indication}} of the wing buds is of a thickening of the hypodermis, which {{can be observed in}} insect species as early the embryo, and in the earliest stages of the life cycle. During the development of morphological features while in the embryo, or embryogenesis, a cluster of cells grow underneath the ectoderm which later in development, after the lateral ectoderm has grown dorsally to form wind imaginal disc. An example of wing bud development in the larvae, can be seen in those of White butterflies (Pieris). In the second instar the histoblast become more prominent, which now form a pocket-like structure. As of the third and fourth instars, the histoblast become more elongated. This greatly extended and evaginated, or protruding, part is what becomes the wing. By the close of the last instar, or fifth, the wing is <b>pushed</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the wing-pocket, although continues to lie under the old larval cuticle while in its prepupal stage. It is not until the butterfly is in its pupal stage that the wing-bud becomes exposed, and shortly after eclosion, the wing begins to expand and form its definitive shape.|$|E
