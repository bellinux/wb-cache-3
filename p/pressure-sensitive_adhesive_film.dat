40|$|ABSTRACT Statistical {{copolymer}} {{films that}} consist of {{two types of}} monomers, a sticky and a glassy monomer, are investigated. These model systems of <b>pressure-sensitive</b> <b>adhesive</b> <b>films</b> are probed with X-ray reflectivity and mechanical tack measurements. For the first time, composition profiles along the surface normal in the near-surface region are monitored. The influence {{of the type of}} monomers being copolymerized, the monomer ratio, and the sample age on the near-surface composition as well as the resulting adhesive performance of the films are analyzed. The copolymers contain ethylhexyl acrylate as the majority component and styrene, maleic acid anhydride, or methylmethacrylate as a minority component. Regardless of the composition, we find a surface enrichment of one component in all samples. In the case of freshly prepared samples, this enrichment is driven by solubility due to the preparation based on solution casting. The minimization of the surface free energy results in an internal reorganization and the component of the statistical copolymer with the lower surface tension enriches at the free surface. The mechanical behavior is not dominated by the surface but by the surface-near part of the composition profile...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{successful}} {{incorporation of}} a NCO-terminated polyurethane (PU) prepolymer in a hybrid miniemulsion is described {{with the purpose}} to develop waterborne, high solids, acrylic-PU hybrid nanoparticles {{to be used in}} <b>pressure-sensitive</b> <b>adhesive</b> (PSA) applications. To ensure efficient chemical incorporation of the reactive PU into the hybrid latex particles, the NCO moieties were reacted with 2 -hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA). The NCO-HEMA coupling reaction was thoroughly studied by conductimetry in order to control the extent of HEMA. incorporation into the PU chains. The resulting HEMA-end-capped prepolymers were chain extended in situ with Bisphenol A (BPA) and polymerized with n-butyl acrylate, methyl meth acrylate, and acrylic acid in the presence of small amounts of a chain transfer agent to form PU/acrylic particles. The amount of chain transfer agent, the ratio between HEMA and BPA, and the amount of PU were varied step by step to study their influence on the final film properties. The miniemulsions and resulting hybrid latexes were characterized in terms of size, monomer conversion, evolution of the ratio of the number of polymer particles to the number of droplets (N-p/N-d), and gel content. In parallel, the mechanical and adhesive properties of the films were tested using probe tack experiments. This allowed us to identify the reaction conditions making it possible to obtain high solids content PU/acrylic hybrid latexes, usable to prepare waterborne <b>pressure-sensitive</b> <b>adhesive</b> <b>films</b> with good <b>adhesive</b> properties, using a simple miniemulsion polymerization method...|$|R
40|$|The {{gradient}} gold layer morphology {{below the}} percolation threshold along a channel groove imprinted into a <b>pressure-sensitive</b> <b>adhesive</b> polymer <b>film</b> is studied. In order to elucidate the complex nanostructure of the sputter-deposited gold nanoparticle layer, nanobeam grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering and imaging ellipsometry are used. Thus, the complex nanostructure of this metal–polymer nanocomposite can be detected, distinguished and identified. The presence of macroscopically curved structures, as {{introduced by the}} imprinted ridges, can cause deviations from the mean metal nanoparticle morphology, probed on the `flat' sample area outside the ridges. The phase-separated morphology of the polymer film is rather unaffected by the imprint structure but leads, in addition, to a selective growth of gold on polystyrene-rich domains...|$|R
40|$|Tackifying resins (TRs) {{are often}} added to <b>pressure-sensitive</b> <b>adhesive</b> <b>films</b> to {{increase}} their peel strength and adhesion energy. In waterborne adhesives, the TR is dispersed in water using surfactants and then blended with colloidal polymers in water (i. e., latex). In such waterborne systems, {{there are problems with}} the colloidal stability and difficulty in applying coatings of the particle blends; the films are often hydrophilic and subject to water uptake. Here, an alternative method of making waterborne, tackified adhesives is demonstrated. The TR is incorporated within the core of colloidal polymer particles via miniemulsion polymerization. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) combined with force spectroscopy analysis reveals there is heterogeneity in the distribution of the TR in films made from particle blends and also in films made from miniemulsion polymers. Two populations, corresponding to TR-rich and acrylic-rich components, were identified through analysis of the AFM force-displacement curves. The nanoscale maximum adhesion force and adhesion energy were found to be higher in a miniemulsion film containing 12 wt % tackifying resin in comparison to an equivalent blended film. The macroscale tack and viscoelasticity are interpreted by consideration of the nanoscale structure and properties. The incorporation of tackifying resin through a miniemulsion polymerization process not only offers clear benefits in the processing of the adhesive, but it also leads to enhanced adhesion properties...|$|R
40|$|Surfactant {{distributions}} {{in model}} <b>pressure-sensitive</b> <b>adhesive</b> (PSA) <b>films</b> were investigated using {{atomic force microscopy}} (AFM) and confocal Raman microscopy (CRM). The PSAs are water-based acrylics synthesized with n-butyl acrylate, vinyl acetate, and methacrylic acid and two commercially available surfactants, disodium (nonylphenoxypolyethoxy) ethyl sulfosuccinate (anionic) and nonylphenoxypoly(ethyleneoxy) ethanol (non-ionic). The ratio of these surfactants was varied, while the total surfactant content was held constant. AFM images demonstrate the tendency of anionic surfactant to accumulate at the film surfaces and retard latex particle coalescence. CRM, which was introduced here {{as a means of}} providing quantitative depth profiling of surfactant concentration in latex <b>adhesive</b> <b>films,</b> confirms that the anionic surfactant tends to migrate to the film interfaces. This is consistent with its greater water solubility, which causes it to be transported by convective flow during the film coalescence process. The behavior of the nonionic surfactant is consistent with its greater compatibility with the polymer, showing little enrichment at film interfaces and little lateral variability in concentration measurements made via CRM. Surfactant distributions near film interfaces determined via CRM are well fit by an exponential decay model, in which concentrations drop from their highs at interfaces to plateau values in the film bulk. It was observed that decay constants are larger at the film-air interface compared with those obtained at the film-substrate side indicating differences in the mechanism involved...|$|R

40|$|For optimal application, <b>pressure-sensitive</b> <b>adhesives</b> {{must have}} {{rheological}} properties in between {{those of a}} viscoplastic solid and those of a viscoelastic liquid. Such adhesives can be produced by emulsion polymerisation, resulting in latex particles which are dispersed in water and contain long-chain acrylic polymers.

40|$|This thesis {{serves to}} {{investigate}} how miniemulsion polymerization, {{as an alternative}} to the conventional emulsion polymerization, can be used to produce <b>pressure-sensitive</b> <b>adhesives.</b> The key advantage that miniemulsion polymerization offers is its droplet nucleation mechanism, where polymer particles are created in such a way that intra- and extra-particle diffusion resistance is maximized. This results in the in-situ production of populations of polymer particles with different properties. The main objective of this thesis was to create an adequately stabilized miniemulsion to create bimodal distributions of particle size or molecular weight for <b>pressure-sensitive</b> <b>adhesives</b> applications. The performance of <b>pressure-sensitive</b> <b>adhesives</b> is characterized by the quantification of an adhesion as well as a cohesion component. On the one hand, <b>pressure-sensitive</b> <b>adhesives</b> must be able to wet the surface and be able to flow under low stresses and on the other hand, they must be able to be removed from the surface and be able to dissipate energy. This leads to a conflicting set of properties wherein a compromise must be made in the final properties. In order to tackle this conflict, miniemulsion polymerization can potentially be used to create latexes with compensating properties at the nanoscale through the preparation of particles with different particle sizes and/or microstructures such as different molecular weights and copolymer composition. Our work started by investigating the influence of surfactant concentration, copolymer composition and chain transfer agent concentration on the resulting latex, polymer and <b>adhesive</b> properties of <b>pressure-sensitive</b> <b>adhesives</b> prepared with poly(2 -ethyl hexyl acrylate/vinyl acetate/methacrylic acid). It was found that a combination of an anionic surfactant (sodium dodecyl sulfate) with an ethoxylated linear fatty alcohol non-ionic surfactant adequately stabilized this copolymer yielding latexes with 43 wt. -% solids content and with a maximum change in the number of particles (Np) with respect to the number of droplets (Nd) of ∼ 6 %. Nevertheless, this copolymer showed considerable homogeneous nucleation in the water phase due to its water solubility, which unavoidably led to inadequate <b>pressure-sensitive</b> <b>adhesives</b> properties. The second part of the study employed methyl methacrylate as a substitute for vinyl acetate to produce a 2 -ethyl hexyl acrylate/methyl methacrylate/acrylic acid terpolymer. It was found that the surfactant mixture, sodium dodecyl sulfate/Disponil A 3065, was also able to stabilize this miniemulsion. The <b>adhesive</b> properties of <b>films</b> cast from this polymer system were systematically compared to those produced by conventional emulsion polymerization using a factorial design. Significant differences between the latexes (or films) produced by these two techniques were found due to their different particle nucleation mechanisms. The most significant difference between the films obtained was shown via a viscoelastic analysis. The analysis showed that miniemulsion-based films presented more entangled networks, i. e., larger values of Mw/M e (which is a measure of the entanglement density) compared to emulsion-based ones even though the weight-average Mw was generally lower for the latexes produced by miniemulsion polymerization. In subsequent work, a one-pot two-step miniemulsion polymerization approach was used to create poly (2 -ethyl hexyl acrylate/methyl methacrylate/acrylic acid) <b>pressure-sensitive</b> <b>adhesives</b> with well-defined and predictable bimodal particle size distributions or bimodal molecular weight distributions. The "in-situ bimodal" latexes produced using this approach were compared to monomodal latexes as well as bimodal latexes produced via conventional post-polymerization blending on the basis of their viscoelastic and <b>pressure-sensitive</b> <b>adhesives</b> properties. Finally, an exploratory study of the use of Atomic Force Microscopy to investigate <b>pressure-sensitive</b> <b>adhesives</b> performance was conducted. Atomic force microscopy was used to acquire adhesion-force curves to investigate the effect of monomodal and bimodal distributions of molecular weight and particle size on the adhesion force and energy at the nanoscale. In conclusion, this is a first attempt to engineer bimodal distributions of molecular weights and particle sizes using miniemulsion polymerization specifically for the production of <b>pressure-sensitive</b> <b>adhesives.</b> Our conclusions are broadly applicable to a large class of soft materials based on deformable polymeric networks such as adhesives, coating and paints. It is expected that in the future, production of latexes with concurrent multimodal distributions of molecular weights, particle sizes and compositions can be produced using this approach...|$|R
