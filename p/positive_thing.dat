25|$|The man {{who started}} the whole {{gambling}} scandal, Salvatore Sollazzo, served 12years in prison and was handed a $1,128,493lien for evasion of taxes. One <b>positive</b> <b>thing</b> to come of the scandal, a journalist for Time wrote in the March 5, 1951 issue, was the awareness of how much influence the game had over gambling and illicit money-making ventures, which got the ball rolling to clean not just college basketball, but all college sports across the country.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} couple of decades there was no {{traditional}} marriage in the kibbutz. If a man and woman wanted to get married, they went to the housing office and requested a room together. Not having traditional marriage was seen as a way to dissolve the patriarchy and give women their own standing without depending on a man (economically or socially) and was also viewed as a <b>positive</b> <b>thing</b> for the community as a whole, as communal life was the main aspect of the kibbutz.|$|E

25|$|I {{think in}} casual {{conversation}} I {{would have told}} anybody I wanted to direct. At the same time I knew Hollywood was a closed off place... It was much harder to get in. To be an older director was a very <b>positive</b> <b>thing.</b> It meant you had survived, knew your way, could make things and make them meet your economic responsibilities. It was always paramount in studio minds, especially in those days... If I was going to direct I was going to write my way in. No TV, no play, I was simply somebody who said I have a sensibility, I think I can do this, based on nothing other than my scripts basically.|$|E
25|$|Soon this {{movement}} expanded {{outside of the}} youth realm and became a more widespread Muslim practice. Women viewed this way of dress {{as a way to}} both publicly announce their religious beliefs as well as a way to simultaneously reject western influences of dress and culture that were prevalent at the time. Despite many criticisms of the practice of hijab being oppressive and detrimental to women’s equality, many Muslim women view the way of dress to be a <b>positive</b> <b>thing.</b> It is seen as a way to avoid harassment and unwanted sexual advances in public and works to desexualize women in the public sphere in order to instead allow them to enjoy equal rights of complete legal, economic, and political status. This modesty was not only demonstrated by their chosen way of dress but also by their serious demeanor which worked to show their dedication to modesty and Islamic beliefs.|$|E

VanDerWerff wrote, [...] "I can buy that Finn and Rachel would be that stupid as to think getting married would perk everybody right on up", as could Votta, who likened it to [...] "people needing to find [...] positive to focus" [...] on, [...] "even if that supposedly <b>positive</b> <b>thing</b> is its own train wreck".

500|$|In 2006, Mauboy {{audition}}ed {{for the fourth}} season of Australian Idol in Alice Springs, Northern Territory singing Whitney Houston's [...] "I Have Nothing". Her audition impressed all three judges, and she progressed through to the semi-finals. Following the semi-final process, Mauboy had advanced through to the toptwelve. The media cited her previous Sony contract as grounds for dismissal, but since the contract had expired, Australian Idol producers refused to remove her from the show. Throughout the series, Mauboy continued to impress the judges with her performances. In the final eleven week, following her rendition of Kelly Clarkson's [...] "Walk Away", judge Kyle Sandilands commented on Mauboy's weight, that if she wished {{to succeed in the}} music industry, she should [...] "lose the jelly belly". Mauboy appeared stunned by the comment. In an interview with Who magazine's Alicia Neil, two years after the comment was made, Mauboy stated [...] "I kind of took it as a joke...I look back on it as a <b>positive</b> <b>thing</b> – it made me a stronger person." ...|$|E

One of the <b>positive</b> <b>things</b> was that the Europeans discovered copper in the bioregion which later became a place for cooper mining. They also found gold, silver, antimony and zinc which really helped their economy going. Miners who would mine in the area would grow crops such as apple, cherry and plum trees. This gave people more resources and benefited them a lot.|$|R

500|$|That same year, Mutrux and Linson {{eventually}} {{took the}} property to Paramount Pictures, who began developing screenplays, offered Steven Spielberg the director's position, and brought in Universal Pictures to co-finance. Universal put John Landis forward {{as a candidate for}} director, courted Clint Eastwood for the title role, and commissioned Jim Cash and Jack Epps, Jr. to write the screenplay. [...] "Before we were brought on, there were several failed scripts at Universal," [...] reflected Epps, [...] "then it went dormant, but John Landis was interested in Dick Tracy, and he brought us in to write it." [...] Cash and Epps' simple orders from Landis were to write the script in a 1930s pulp magazine atmosphere and center it with Alphonse [...] "Big Boy" [...] Caprice as the primary villain. For research, Epps read every Dick Tracy comic strip from 1930 to 1957. The writers wrote two drafts for Landis; Max Allan Collins, then writer of the Dick Tracy comic strip, remembers reading one of them. [...] "It was terrible. The only <b>positive</b> <b>thing</b> about it was a thirties setting and lots of great villains, but the story was paper-thin and it was uncomfortably campy." ...|$|E
500|$|Stead {{finds that}} kids today {{are much less}} {{independent}} since her childhood. She wrote, [...] "rom age nine, my friends and I were on the streets, walking home, going to each other's houses, going to the store. I really {{wanted to write about}} that: the independence that's a little bit scary but also a really <b>positive</b> <b>thing</b> in a lot of ways. And I'm not sure that most kids have that today". Throughout the novel, Miranda and her friends often walk around town without any adults. They are even found working in a sandwich store at lunch and walking home from school while trying to avoid the laughing man. While writing the novel, Stead hoped to show her sons the time period in which she lived, [...] "send them on a little time-travel journey of their own". Laura Miller of The New Yorker found that this lack of independence in today's youth is mainly {{due to the fact that}} kids now grow up with adults constantly watching them. Miller noted how, despite the lower crime rate in current times, the [...] "characters, middle-class middle school students, routinely walk around the Upper West Side by themselves, a rare freedom in today's city." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{decision}} of the United States Congress to pass the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937 was based on poorly attended hearings and reports based on questionable studies. In 1936 the Federal Bureau of Narcotics (FBN) noticed an increase of reports of people smoking marijuana, which further increased in 1937. The Bureau drafted a legislative plan for Congress seeking a new law, {{and the head of}} the FBN, Harry J. Anslinger, ran a campaign against marijuana. Newspaper mogul William Randolph Hearst's empire of newspapers used the [...] "yellow journalism" [...] pioneered by Hearst to demonize the cannabis plant and spread a public perception that there were connections between cannabis and violent crime. Several scholars argue that the goal was to destroy the hemp industry, largely as an effort of Hearst, Andrew Mellon and the Du Pont family. They argue that with the invention of the decorticator hemp became a very cheap substitute for the wood pulp that was used in the newspaper industry. However, Hearst newspapers owed large debts to Canadian suppliers of paper, who used wood as raw material. If an alternative raw material for paper had emerged, it would have lowered the price of the paper needed to print Hearst's many newspapers—a <b>positive</b> <b>thing</b> for Hearst. Moreover, by the year 1916 there were at least five [...] "machine brakes" [...] for hemp and it is unlikely that in 1930s hemp became a new threat for newspapers owners.|$|E

When Malachy discovered her lies, he hit Mercedes, who felt, according to Metcalfe, that she [...] "deserved it" [...] because she was [...] "awful" [...] and [...] "the lies she told were just disgusting. She doesn't resent Malachy for hitting her at all". Mercedes reconciled with Malachy; Metcalfe explained that Mercedes still loved Malachy {{but was unable to}} stay away from other men. She added that seeing Malachy with Lynsey helped Mercedes [...] "realise" [...] how much she loved him. After Malachy is injured in an explosion, Metcalfe explained that Mercedes regretted her affair with Calvin and she [...] "desperately" [...] wanted the chance to [...] "make things work" [...] with Malachy. She added that if he died, Mercedes would find it difficult to live with her guilt. If Malachy were to die Mercedes would be [...] "devastated" [...] as he was [...] "the only <b>positive</b> <b>thing</b> in her life. [...] She thinks that she's nothing without him". Malachy died. Metcalfe felt that when Malachy shielded Mercedes from the explosion by throwing himself over her it [...] "proves to her how much he loves her. She knows that's special and regrets she ever took him and his love granted". Metcalfe felt that she and Wallace [...] "had amazing storylines", opining that Malachy's death was the most emotional scene she had filmed while with the serial.|$|E
500|$|Several reviewers re-watched {{the episode}} {{after the end}} of the series. Keith DeCandido {{reviewed}} the episode for Tor.com in June 2011. He summed it up by saying [...] "What a dreadful episode. While it's important in the grand scheme of things in what it establishes about Data's background, the episode itself is horrendously bad, from the clumsy script to the embarrassingly inept body-double work." [...] He thought the ending was anticlimactic, and that the characters all acted [...] "as dumb as posts" [...] in the episode. The most <b>positive</b> <b>thing</b> he said of the episode was that [...] "Spiner's teeth marks are all over the scenery when he's onscreen as Lore". DeCandido gave [...] "Datalore" [...] a score of four out of ten. Cast member Wil Wheaton watched the episode for AOL TV in December 2007. While he credited the art direction of the episode, he criticised the story, saying that [...] "it comes down to lazy writing that has things happen because they're supposed to happen, rather than having them happen organically. The characters are credulous when they should be skeptical, the audience isn't surprised by anything after the second act, and there are story problems that should have never gotten past the first draft." [...] He remembered really enjoying the episode as a child, but felt that it didn't hold up on repeat watchings as an adult, and stated that Spiner's [...] "fantastic job creating distinctly different characters in Data and Lore" [...] wasn't enough to remedy the other faults in the episode. He gave it a D grade.|$|E
2500|$|He {{explained}} the thinking behind {{his work in}} Germany in an interview published in the Aufbau on March 11, 1966: [...] "A new generation is growing up that was not born when the horrible crime was committed and for which they cannot be held responsible.

2500|$|The term white stolen generations {{is used to}} {{distinguish}} this group from the Indigenous stolen generations. It is estimated that around 250,000 Australian-born non-Indigenous children were removed from their mothers from the 1930s to 1982 in what was widely seen by {{society as a whole}} at the time as a <b>positive</b> <b>thing</b> for both the mothers and the children.
