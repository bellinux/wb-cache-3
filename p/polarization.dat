5|$|Because the cuticle layers are {{arranged}} in rows, with a cylindrical curve, {{the amount of the}} second type of reflection is dependent on the <b>polarization</b> of the incoming light. This makes the moth's overall colour polarization-dependent.

5|$|Hale–Bopp {{showed the}} highest ever linear <b>polarization</b> {{detected}} for any comet.

30|$|The only {{situation}} {{for which the}} couple of linear <b>polarizations</b> could appear more effective corresponds {{to the existence of}} linear limiting <b>polarizations</b> at the ionosphere entry point. This case presents a low occurrence and, additionally, would demand that the axes of the transmitted fields be superimposed with the directions of the limiting <b>polarizations,</b> the orientation of which varies with time: the technical challenge appears unrealistic to overcome. Only the generation of linear <b>polarizations</b> with fixed field directions seems possible, and as demonstrated on Figures  1 and 2, it is better anyway to consider the excitation of two complementary circular <b>polarizations.</b>|$|R

25|$|When an {{arbitrary}} {{beam of light}} strikes {{the surface of a}} birefringent material, the <b>polarizations</b> corresponding to the ordinary and extraordinary rays generally take somewhat different paths. Unpolarized light consists of equal amounts of energy in any two orthogonal <b>polarizations,</b> and even polarized light (except in special cases) will have some energy in each of these <b>polarizations.</b> According to Snell's law of refraction, the angle of refraction will be governed by the effective refractive index which is different between these two <b>polarizations.</b> This is clearly seen, for instance, in the Wollaston prism which is designed to separate incoming light into two linear <b>polarizations</b> using a birefringent material such as calcite.|$|R
5|$|The {{most recent}} disk {{responsible}} for these phase changes was formed in 1972. What's intriguing, however, is that Pleione's long-term polarimetric observations show the intrinsic <b>polarization</b> angle has changed, providing direct evidence for a spatial motion of the disk axis. Because Pleione has a stellar companion with a relatively close orbit, the shift in the <b>polarization</b> angle {{has been attributed to}} the companion causing a precession (wobble) of the disk, with a precession period of roughly 81 years.|$|E

25|$|In all {{electromagnetic}} radiation, {{the electric}} field is {{perpendicular to the}} direction of propagation, and the electric field direction is the <b>polarization</b> of the wave.

We study P systems with active membranes without non-elementary membrane division, working in minimally parallel way. The main question we address is what number of <b>polarizations</b> is sufficient for an efficient computation depending on the types of rules used. In particular, we show that {{it is enough to}} have four <b>polarizations,</b> sequential evolution rules changing <b>polarizations,</b> polarizationless non-elementary membrane division rules and polarizationless rules of sending an object out.

25|$|Many {{animals are}} capable of perceiving some of the {{components}} of the <b>polarization</b> of light, e.g., linear horizontally polarized light. This is generally used for navigational purposes, since the linear <b>polarization</b> of sky light is always perpendicular to the direction of the sun. This ability is very common among the insects, including bees, which use this information to orient their communicative dances. <b>Polarization</b> sensitivity has also been observed in species of octopus, squid, cuttlefish, and mantis shrimp. In the latter case, one species measures all six orthogonal components of <b>polarization,</b> and is believed to have optimal <b>polarization</b> vision. The rapidly changing, vividly colored skin patterns of cuttlefish, used for communication, also incorporate <b>polarization</b> patterns, and mantis shrimp are known to have <b>polarization</b> selective reflective tissue.

40|$|Studies of {{transmission}} holographic grating (HG) relaxation (recorded with s-s, p-p, s-p, L-L, L-R laser beam <b>polarizations)</b> {{have been carried}} out in organic molecular azobenzene glassy films W- 50 and W- 75, and in chalcogenide glassy a-As 2 S 3 film. Results previously obtained with azobenzene molecular glassy K-RJ- 9 films also are used for comparison. HG with the periods of 0. 50, 2. 0 and 8. 6 μm were studied in these films. It is found that recording efficiency in the same sample depends on both recording <b>polarizations</b> and HG period. The HG stability in the course of relaxation also depends on these factors. Anticorrelation has been observed of HG recording efficiency and stability. Recording was efficient with p-p or L-R <b>polarizations</b> at 2. 0 μm HG period whereas it was stable with s-s L-L <b>polarizations</b> at 8. 6 μm HG period. As a rule, HG stability was higher in the samples with higher glass transition temperature.
