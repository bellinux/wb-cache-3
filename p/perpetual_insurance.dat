50|$|A {{deposit premium}} {{is a type}} of {{insurance}} premium where the insured deposits money with the insurer to obtain <b>perpetual</b> <b>insurance</b> against the risk of a loss. Deposit premiums are unique from regular insurance premiums, as they are refundable should if either the insured or the insurer chooses to terminate the <b>perpetual</b> <b>insurance.</b>|$|E
50|$|Typically {{payment is}} made annually. <b>Perpetual</b> <b>insurance</b> which {{continues}} indefinitely {{can also be}} obtained in certain areas.|$|E
50|$|In 2016, Baltimore Equitable Insurance {{unveiled}} a new marketing campaign which included three new radio ads, direct mail and various internet marketing. Although Baltimore Equitable offers perpetual renters, condominium owners and homeowners insurance, Baltimore Equitable's marketing campaign focuses on <b>perpetual</b> homeowners <b>insurance.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Perpetual</b> <b>{{insurance}}</b> {{is a type}} {{of homeowners}} insurance policy written to have no term, or date, when the policy expires. From the effective start date, the coverage exists for perpetuity. The insured deposits money, called a deposit premium, with the insurer for insurance {{for the life of the}} risk. The deposit is many times larger than the cost of a non-refundable, annual premium for an equivalent policy with a one-year term. The insurer must earn enough income from investing the deposits to cover losses and operating expenses for the model to be economically viable. Upon cancellation, the insured is entitled to a full refund of the initial deposit premium, usually without interest. <b>Perpetual</b> <b>insurance,</b> first issued in the U.S. in Philadelphia in 1752, is still used for fire and homeowner's insurance.|$|E
50|$|In Colonial America, Benjamin Franklin {{helped to}} popularize and make {{standard}} {{the practice of}} insurance, particularly Property insurance to spread the risk of loss from fire, {{in the form of}} <b>perpetual</b> <b>insurance.</b> In 1752, he founded the Philadelphia Contributionship for the Insurance of Houses from Loss by Fire. Franklin's company refused to insure certain buildings, such as wooden houses, where the risk of fire was too great.|$|E
50|$|At this time, {{the company}} merged its Harris Scarfe and FitzGerald's {{retailing}} operations, which {{continued to grow}} to become Australia's third largest department store group. It also once owned interests in <b>Perpetual</b> <b>Insurance</b> and Securities, owner of Eastlands Shopping Centre which increased from 83 % to 91 % in 1973-1974 and also in Co-Operative Motors Ltd, manufacturer of Toyota, Triumph Motor Company, Mercedes Benz and Rambler.|$|E
50|$|In the United States, {{there are}} also tax {{advantages}} to <b>perpetual</b> <b>insurance.</b> The deposit premium does not yield any income to the insured. However, {{the expense of the}} annual premium for term homeowners insurance is eliminated. Therefore, the tax-adjusted, equivalent rate of return to the insured homeowner on the deposit premium can be calculated by taking the gross amount of money he or she needs to earn to net the amount of an annual premium for a term policy, divided by the amount of the deposit premium. For example, a house which costs $150,000 may typically be charged an annual premium of $1,000 for a term policy. That same house would likely require a $10,000 single deposit premium for a <b>perpetual</b> <b>insurance</b> policy of equivalent coverage. A person in the 28% Tax bracket would need to earn $1,389 in gross income to pay the annual premium. Since that amount no longer needs to be paid annually, the tax-adjusted, equivalent rate of return to the insured homeowner on the single deposit premium would be $1,389, less the after-tax returns that would have been earned on investing the deposit premium (or $600, assuming a 6% after-tax rate of return) divided by $10,000, in other words, 7.89%.|$|E
50|$|In Colonial America, {{the first}} {{insurance}} company that underwrote fire insurance {{was formed in}} Charles Town (modern-day Charleston), South Carolina in 1732. Benjamin Franklin helped to popularize and make standard the practice of insurance, particularly Property insurance to spread the risk of loss from fire, {{in the form of}} <b>perpetual</b> <b>insurance.</b> In 1752, he founded the Philadelphia Contributionship for the Insurance of Houses from Loss by Fire. Franklin's company made contributions toward fire prevention. Not only did his company warn against certain fire hazards, it refused to insure certain buildings where the risk of fire was too great, such as all wooden houses.|$|E
50|$|In 1871, while convalescent from {{a severe}} attack of {{congestion}} of the lungs, {{he wrote the}} Genealogy of General Richard Montgomery. Failing to regain his normal health, {{on the advice of}} his physician, he decided to spend the winter at the south, and, October, 1871, sailed from New York for Frederickstadt, Island of St. Croix. A six monthsâ€™ sojourn there saved his life and made him physically stronger than he had ever been before. On October 31, 1871, the Enterprise Insurance Company failed, owing to heavy losses in the Great Chicago Fire, and on his return to Philadelphia, Montgomery was, in 1872, appointed general agent of the National Board of Underwriters, and the same year moved with his family to New York. This position he filled six years, and on his retirement, 1878, was the subject of complimentary testimonials to his good work in leading insurance journals, as well as of resolutions adopted by the National Board. In 1878 he accepted the position of manager of the department of <b>perpetual</b> <b>insurance,</b> in the Insurance Company of North America, Philadelphia. In 1880, he was elected vice-president of the American Fire Insurance Company, in the same city, and, 1882, became its president, which office he filled until his death.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} a dual risk process {{which can be}} used to model the surplus of a business that invests money constantly and earns gains randomly in both time and amount. The occurrences of the gains and their amounts are assumed follow a semi-Markovian structure (e. g. Reinhard (1984)). We analyze a quantity resembling the Gerber-Shiu expected discounted penalty function (Gerber and Shiu (1998)) that incorporates random variables defined before and after the time of ruin, such as the minimum surplus level before ruin and {{the time of the first}} gain after ruin. General properties of the function are studied, and some exact results are derived upon exponential distributional assumptions on either the inter-arrival times or the gain amounts. Applications in a <b>perpetual</b> <b>insurance</b> and the last inter-arrival time containing the time of ruin are given along with some numerical examples. postprin...|$|E
40|$|In the {{literature}} of ruin theory, there have been extensive studies trying to generalize the classical insurance risk model. In this thesis, we look into two particular risk processes considering multi-dimensional risk and dependent structures respectively. The first one is a bivariate risk process with a dividend barrier, which concerns a two-dimensional risk model under a barrier strategy. Copula is used to represent the dependence between two business lines when a common shock strikes. By defining the time of ruin {{to be the first}} time that either of the two lines has its surplus level below zero, we derive a discrete approximation procedure to calculate the expected discounted dividends until ruin under such a model. A thorough discussion of application in proportional reinsurance with numerical examples is provided as well as an examination of the joint optimal dividend barrier for the bivariate process. The second risk process is a semi-Markovian dual risk process. Assuming that the dependence among innovations and waiting times is driven by a Markov chain, we analyze a quantity resembling the Gerber-Shiu expected discounted penalty function that incorporates random variables defined before and after the time of ruin, such as the minimum surplus level before ruin and {{the time of the first}} gain after ruin. General properties of the function are studied, and some exact results are derived upon distributional assumptions on either the inter-arrival times or the gain amounts. Applications in a <b>perpetual</b> <b>insurance</b> and the last inter-arrival time before ruin are given along with some numerical examples. published_or_final_versionStatistics and Actuarial ScienceMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|E
