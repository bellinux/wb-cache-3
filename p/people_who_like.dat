500|$|Kubrick's {{rationale}} for editing {{the film was}} to tighten the narrative. Reviews suggested the film suffered from its departure from traditional cinematic storytelling.

However, as Bathurst observes, [...] "there's an underground of <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>like</b> it". The show rated highly on the Appreciation Index, meaning that viewers thought very highly of the programme. Bathurst says that drunks on the London Underground tell him in detail the plot of their favourite episode. The cast claim that the programme has a timeless, universal appeal as there are no time-specific references apart from the typewriter {{and the size of the}} mobile telephones. Gillies says that her accountant watches it to cheer himself up, while Bathurst recalls that a friend cheered so loudly when Mark pushes avocado into Trevor's face in the third episode that he woke his son.|$|E

[...] Joe Colly of Pitchfork noted that Robyn [...] "primarily sticks with the quick-moving, clubby synth-pop that is her calling card."

500|$|The {{gameplay}} {{was praised}} for its deep single-player missions and varied enemy types. Game Revolution highlighted {{the long and}} complex levels, but admitted that players may [...] "" [...] around in circles for hours {{trying to figure out}} where to go next. This may be enjoyable for <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>like</b> puzzles and long gameplay, but it is aggravating for more action-oriented players." [...] N64 Magazine gave high marks to the game's level design and explained that the addition of mission objectives [...] "gives the game more focus and betters its predecessor's pretty limited and fairly simple key-collection." [...] The artificial intelligence of enemies was considered more advanced than GoldenEye 007s, as enemies can take refuge behind objects and pop up to throw explosives towards the player. GamePro also noted that they were more aggressive than Dinosaur Hunters. The game's large arsenal of weapons was also praised, with GameSpot remarking that the Cerebral Bore is [...] "possibly the grossest weapon ever conceived". The multiplayer mode was praised for its use of 3D space and innovative game types.|$|E

500|$|The {{new feature}} {{continued}} {{to be known as}} The Concert Feature or Musical Feature as late as November 1938. Hal Horne, a publicist for Disney's film distributor RKO Radio Pictures, wished for a different title, and gave the suggestion Filmharmonic Concert. Stuart Buchanan then held a contest at the studio for a title that produced almost 1,800 suggestions including Bach to Stravinsky and Bach and Highbrowski by Stokowski. Still, the favorite among the film's supervisors was Fantasia, an early working title that had even grown on Horne, [...] "It isn't the word alone but the meaning we read into it." [...] From the beginning of its development, Disney expressed the greater importance of music in Fantasia compared to his past work: [...] "In our ordinary stuff, our music is always under action, but on this... we're supposed to be picturing this music—not the music fitting our story." [...] Disney had hoped that the film would bring classical music to <b>people</b> <b>who,</b> <b>like</b> himself, had previously [...] "walked out on this kind of stuff".|$|E
500|$|The episode's {{reference}} to A Clockwork Orange {{was named the}} 10th-greatest film reference {{in the history of}} the show by Total Films Nathan Ditum.

[...] He added that the episode is unlikely to satisfy devoted fans, and the relationship between the family and Santa's Little Helper will not [...] "register" [...] to casual viewers; [...] "Still, there are enough laughs (especially in the animal hospital) to keep the audience entertained." [...] DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson also praised the parody of A Clockwork Orange, describing it as [...] "possibly the funniest Clockwork Orange parody I've ever seen." [...] Jacobson added that the episode as a whole offers [...] "a terrific program. [...] From the cracks about the lottery and public hysteria that open the program to the calamities that befall the family when Santa's Little Helper gets sick to the bizarre escapades that greet the pooch when he splits, 'Dog of Death' provides a hilarious piece." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode's {{title is}} a pun. It refers to both {{cartoonist}} Rube Goldberg, who {{was famous for}} his drawings of incredibly complex machines made out of everyday objects that performed rudimentary tasks, {{as well as the}} harpsichord piece, the [...] "Goldberg Variations", by Johann Sebastian Bach. The elaborate contraptions Henry Weems created are physical examples of such machines. Episode writer Jeffrey Bell noted that he wanted the episode to function [...] "as a Rube Goldberg device" [...] and so he wrote the story to revolve around the ideas of good luck and bad luck. Originally, the episode's opening scene was to have featured Weems falling thirty thousand feet from an airplane and walking away unscathed. Although Bell's pitch was met with enthusiasm, many writers and producers for the show were cautious, because they realized the episode would have several humorous moments. Executive producer Frank Spotnitz explained: [...] "The episode had a lot of humorous moments that we were afraid of doing because as many <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>like</b> the funny ones hate the funny ones." [...] Eventually, the episode was green-lighted, but pushed to later in the season because, according to Spotnitz, [...] "we wanted to scare the hell out of everybody during the first few episodes." ...|$|E

On his own website, Carlin wrote of the show: [...] "always check mental health of creative partner beforehand. Loved the actors, loved the crew. Had a great time. Couldn't wait to get the fuck out of there." [...] In his final book, the posthumously published Last Words (2009), Carlin elaborated: [...] "I had a great time. I never laughed so much, so often, so hard as I did with cast members Alex Rocco, Chris Rich, Tony Starke. There was a very strange, very good sense of humor on that stage ... The biggest problem, though, was that Sam Simon was a fucking horrible person to be around. Very, very funny, extremely bright and brilliant, but an unhappy person who treated other people poorly."

Andrew Greer of Christianity Today commented that [...] " [...] uses a distorted vocal bridge and grungy half-time chorus groove to depict evangelism from a non-believer's perspective", while Glen McCarty of Crosswalk.com stated the song [...] "is propelled by a thudding kick drum" [...] while also regarding it as [...] "tightly-constructed". Lindsay Williams of Gospel Music Channel commented that [...] "Mac Powell’s smoky vocals take on a muffled effect that is both modern and vintage at the same time". John DiBiase of Jesus Freak Hideout opined that [...] "'Make Your Move' has that edgy, gutsy rock attitude that [...] "You Make Me Mad" [...] had on Conspiracy No. 5" [...] and also described the song's bassline as [...] "delicious".
