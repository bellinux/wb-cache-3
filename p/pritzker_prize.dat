5|$|Expressionist {{architecture}} {{developed in}} the 1910s in Germany and influenced Art Deco and other modern styles, with e.g. Fritz Höger, Erich Mendelsohn, Dominikus Böhm, and Fritz Schumacher being influential architects. Germany was particularly important in the early modernist movement: it {{is the home of}} Werkbund initiated by Hermann Muthesius (New Objectivity), and of the Bauhaus movement founded by Walter Gropius. Consequently, Germany is often considered the cradle of modern architecture and design. Ludwig Mies van der Rohe became one of the world's most renowned architects {{in the second half of}} the 20th century. He conceived of the glass façade skyscraper. Renowned contemporary architects and offices include Hans Kollhoff, Sergei Tchoban, KK Architekten, Helmut Jahn, Behnisch, GMP, Ole Scheeren, J. Mayer H., OM Ungers, Gottfried Böhm and Frei Otto (the last two being <b>Pritzker</b> <b>Prize</b> winners).|$|E

Sydney is home to Australia's first building by renowned Canadian architect Frank Gehry, the Dr Chau Chak Wing Building (2015), based on the design of a tree house. An entrance from The Goods Line–a pedestrian pathway and former railway line–is located on the eastern border of the site.|$|E
25|$|Before the merger, Victoria University of Manchester and UMIST counted 23 Nobel Prize winners amongst {{their former}} staff and students. Manchester has {{traditionally}} been strong in the sciences; it is where the nuclear nature of the atom was discovered by Ernest Rutherford, and the world's first stored-program computer was built at the university. Notable scientists associated with the university include physicists Ernest Rutherford, Osborne Reynolds, Niels Bohr, James Chadwick, Arthur Schuster, Hans Geiger, Ernest Marsden and Balfour Stewart. Contributions in other fields such as mathematics were made by Paul Erdős, Horace Lamb and Alan Turing and in philosophy by Samuel Alexander, Ludwig Wittgenstein and Alasdair MacIntyre.

25|$|Specifics {{about the}} third phase, which {{initially}} was to involve renovations to older buildings, long remained undisclosed. In November 2009, plans were made public that LACMA's director Michael Govan was working with Swiss architect and <b>Pritzker</b> <b>Prize</b> laureate Peter Zumthor on plans for rebuilding the eastern section of the campus from the two new Renzo Piano buildings to the tar pits. With an estimated cost of $650 million, his first proposal called for a horizontal building along Wilshire Boulevard. It would be wrapped in glass on all sides and its main galleries would be lifted one floor into the air. The wide roof would be covered with solar panels. In a later concession to concerns raised by its neighbor, the Page Museum, LACMA had Zumthor alter {{the shape of his}} proposed building to stretch across Wilshire Boulevard and away from the La Brea Tar Pits.|$|E
25|$|The USC School of Architecture was {{established}} in 1916, the first in Southern California. From at least 1972 to 1976, and likely {{for a number of}} years prior to 1972, it was called The School of Architecture and Fine Art. The School of Fine Art (known as SOFA {{for a number of years}} after Architecture and Fine Art separated) was eventually named the Roski School of Fine Arts in 2006 during a ceremony to open, the then, new Masters of Fine Art building occupying the previous and completely refurbished, Lucky Blue Jean factory. This small department grew rapidly with the help of the Allied Architects of Los Angeles. A separate School of Architecture was organized in September 1925. The school has been home to teachers such as Richard Neutra, Ralph Knowles, James Steele, A. Quincy Jones, William Pereira and Pierre Koenig. The school of architecture also claims notable alumni Frank Gehry, Jon Jerde, Thom Mayne, Raphael Soriano, Gregory Ain, and Pierre Koenig. Two of the alumni have become <b>Pritzker</b> <b>Prize</b> winners. In 2006, Qingyun Ma, a distinguished Shanghai-based architect, was named dean of the school.|$|E

500|$|When {{the city}} first {{determined}} that a new pavilion should be built, the commission {{was supposed to go}} to Skidmore, Owings and Merrill. The original pavilion design was much more modest than the structure that was eventually built, with a smaller shell structure and speakers affixed to poles interspersed throughout the seating area. However, two factors led to the cancellation of the original plans. First, the project's scope changed as a result of additional funds raised by John H. Bryan, former CEO of the Sara Lee Corporation. The second factor was the intervention of the Pritzker family as potential donors. Unimpressed with the pavilion's original design, Cindy Pritzker [...] "mandated that Frank Gehry be involved in its re-design". Jay Pritzker, a prominent Chicago businessman, had died in January 1999; his family own several businesses, including Hyatt Hotels. Jay and Cindy Pritzker had founded the <b>Pritzker</b> <b>Prize</b> in architecture in 1979, and the Pritzker family's Hyatt Foundation continues to award it annually. Architect Frank Gehry had received the <b>Pritzker</b> <b>Prize</b> in 1989.|$|E
500|$|... was a Japanese architect, and {{winner of}} the 1987 <b>Pritzker</b> <b>Prize</b> for architecture. He {{was one of the}} most {{significant}} architects of the 20th century, combining traditional Japanese styles with modernism, and designed major buildings on five continents. Tange was also an influential patron of the Metabolist movement. He said: [...] "It was, I believe, around 1959 or at the beginning of the sixties that I began to think about what I was later to call structuralism", (cited in Plan 2/1982, Amsterdam), a reference to the architectural movement known as Dutch Structuralism.|$|E

500|$|The <b>Pritzker</b> <b>Prize</b> {{presentation}} ceremony, which {{moves to}} an architecturally significant location each year, {{was held in}} the Pritzker Pavilion in April 2005. Among the annual performers at the pavilion are Steppenwolf Theatre, Lyric Opera of Chicago and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra (CSO). [...] At the end of the Grant Park Music Festival season in August, the Festival's Grant Park Orchestra and Carlos Kalmar presented Pulitzer Prize-winning composer John Adams' On the Transmigration of Souls, which was written {{at the request of the}} New York Philharmonic to honor the victims of the September 11 attacks. On Sunday September 11, 2005, United States Senator Barack Obama (who was later elected President of the United States) served as guest narrator for a 9/11 tribute concert by the CSO. The focal work of the concert was Aaron Copland's [...] "Lincoln Portrait" [...] and the concert was led by former CSO resident conductor William Eddins.|$|E
500|$|The {{pavilion}} by Hadid, {{the first}} woman to win the <b>Pritzker</b> <b>Prize,</b> is a tensioned fabric shell fitted over a curving aluminum framework exceeding 7,000 pieces. [...] Although the frame is composed of 7,000 individually bent pieces, no two of which are alike, the shell is made up of a mere 24 custom-made panels of fabric. As expected it accommodates a centennial-themed, audio and video presentation on its interior fabric walls. Its opening was originally expected to be delayed until at least mid-July 2009. [...] The themed presentation that portrays Chicago’s transformation as a result of Burnham's plan is by London-based, Chicago-trained filmmaker Thomas Gray. It is accompanied by a multi-channel soundtrack created by Chicago's Lou Mallozzi of Experimental Sound Studio. The pavilion is described as resembling a [...] "futuristic camping tent". Hadid conceptualized how tension alters appearance as fabric is pulled taut or twisted, which resulted in the elliptical structure and its strategic light-availing gashes and pod-like openings for visitors to experience. The diagonal lines in the structure are a reflection of Burnham’s 1909 city plan, which envisioned a fanned grid of streets emanating diagonally from Chicago’s city center out into the suburbs.|$|E
500|$|In 2013, [...] "Women in Design", {{a student}} {{organization}} at the Harvard Graduate School of Design started a petition {{on behalf of}} Denise Scott Brown to receive joint recognition with her partner, past prize winner Robert Venturi, furthering a debate about sexism in architecture. The petition, according to The New York Times has [...] "reignited long-simmering tensions in the architectural world over whether women have been consistently denied the standing they deserve in a field whose most prestigious award was not given to a woman until 2004, when Zaha Hadid won." [...] Although the petition received international support of several past recipients, the jury said that it cannot revisit the work of past juries, in order to acknowledge the work of Denise Scott Brown and Lu Wenyu, both women and equal partners to their spouses Venturi and Wang Shu, who won in 1991 and 2012 respectively. Scott Brown told CNN that [...] "as a woman, she had felt excluded by the elite of architecture throughout her career," [...] and that [...] "the <b>Pritzker</b> <b>Prize</b> {{was based on the}} fallacy that great architecture was the work of a 'single lone male genius' at the expense of collaborative work." ...|$|E
