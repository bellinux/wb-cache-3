40|$|We {{develop a}} new {{numerical}} self-consistent field theory (SCFT) scheme for examining thin film nanostructures of cylinder-forming AB diblock copolymers on a chemically patterned substrate. Using this, we make a systematic analysis to achieve a fundamental understanding of the model system, and the conditions to create various novel film morphologies are scrutinized by varying the <b>pattern</b> <b>period</b> and film thickness. At a fixed <b>pattern</b> <b>period,</b> eight candidate phases which are {{divided into two groups}} according to the film thickness are found, and then their free energies are compared to identify the stable morphology. Among the thinner film morphologies, a crossed cylinder geometry is found to be stable with a comfortable margin. While for the thicker film morphologies, the stability of the phases depends strongly on both the <b>pattern</b> <b>period</b> and film thickness. In addition, we identify an unstable phase capable of thinning the films and consequently providing instability for the ordering of the thicker film nanostructures.

40|$|This work {{reports on}} the {{fabrication}} of 1 D fringed patterns on nanostructured porous silicon (nanoPS) layers (563, 372, and 290 nm thick). The patterns are fabricated by phase-mask laser interference using single pulses of an UV excimer laser (193 nm, 20 ns pulse duration). The method is a single-step and flexible approach to produce a large variety of patterns formed by alternate regions of almost untransformed nanoPS and regions where its surface has melted and transformed into Si nanoparticles (NPs). The role of laser fluence (5 - 80 mJcm- 2), and <b>pattern</b> <b>period</b> (6. 3 - 16 µm) on pattern features and surface structuring are discussed. The {{results show that the}} diameter of Si NPs increases with fluence up to a saturation value of 75 nm for a fluence ˜ 40 mJcm- 2. In addition, the percentage of transformed to non-transformed region normalized to the <b>pattern</b> <b>period</b> follows similar fluence dependence regardless the period and thus becomes an excellent control parameter. This dependence is fitted within a thermal model that allows for predicting the in-depth profile of the pattern. The model assumes that transformation occurs whenever the laser-induced temperature increase reaches the melting temperature of nanoPS that {{has been found to be}} 0. 7 of that of crystalline silicon for a porosity of around 79 %.

The considered homogeneous networks demonstrate a great multistability of various travelling time- and space-periodic waves which can propagate either along the direction of coupling or in opposite direction. Such a multistability significantly enhances the variability of possible spatio-temporal patterns and potentially increases the coding capability of oscillatory neuronal loops.
