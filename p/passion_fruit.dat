5|$|In North America, California is {{the leading}} {{producer}} of Sauvignon blanc with plantings also found in Washington state and on the Niagara Peninsula and Okanagan Valley in Canada. Sauvignon Blanc is also grown in small regions in Ohio along Lake Erie and the Ohio River. In California wine produced from the Sauvignon blanc grape {{is also known as}} Fumé Blanc. This California wine was first made by Napa Valley's Robert Mondavi Winery in 1968. Mondavi had been offered a crop of particularly good Sauvignon blanc grapes by a grower. At that time the variety had a poor reputation in California due to its grassy flavor and aggressive aromas. Mondavi decided to try to tame that aggressiveness with barrel agings and released the wine under the name Fumé Blanc as an allusion to the French Pouilly-Fumé. The usage of the term is primarily a marketing base one with California wine makers choosing whichever name they prefer. Both oaked and unoaked Sauvignon blanc wines have been marketed under the name Fumé Blanc. California Sauvignon blancs tend to fall into two styles. The New Zealand-influenced Sauvignon blanc have more tropical fruit undertones with citrus and <b>passion</b> <b>fruit</b> notes. The Mondavi-influenced Fumé Blanc are more round with melon notes.|$|E

Studies have been conducted since 1987 by the National Agricultural Research Institute (ISAR) who maintains a substation in Rwerere, Western Province within the highlands. In order to increase agricultural production with use new commercial crops have been adopted in the project area. The crops adopted are maracuja (<b>passion</b> <b>fruit),</b> an export item, and potatoes. In addition, modern livestock breeding techniques have also been adopted.
