50|$|Tawing is {{a method}} that uses alum and {{aluminium}} salts, generally {{in conjunction with other}} products such as egg yolk, flour, and other salts. The leather becomes tawed by soaking in a warm <b>potash</b> <b>alum</b> and salts solution, between 20 and 30 °C. The process increases the leather's pliability, stretchability, softness, and quality. Adding egg yolk and flour to the standard soaking solution further enhances its fine handling characteristics. Then, the leather is air dried (crusted) for several weeks, which allows it to stabilize. Tawing is traditionally used on pigskins and goatskins to create the whitest colors. However, exposure and aging may cause slight yellowing over time and, if it remains in a wet condition, tawed leather will suffer from decay. Technically, tawing is not tanning.|$|E

This was done using Completely Randomised Design with loading doses of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 g/l of the powder processed from Moringa seeds, and potash aluminium sulphate (alum) as coagulant. A control (water from the pond with only distilled water without alum and Moringa treatments) was also included.

The turbidity for the samples ranged from log 100. 37 to log 101. 00 NTU while the conductivity ranged from log 101. 56 to log 102. 86 µS/cm.

30|$|Being {{primarily}} metallic salts, a mordant {{acts as a}} sort of {{glue that}} fixes fiber firmly with dye resulting in a durable color on the textile substrate. The process of mordanting usually enhanced the performance of dye besides achieving a wide spectrum of colors on both natural and synthetic textile fibers having extended shade ranges associated with colorfastness properties (Kadolph and Casselman 2004). Different types of metallic mordants (such as <b>potash</b> <b>alum,</b> iron, tin, copper and chrome) either individually or in combination are applied to the dyebath of natural colorants as well as henna in order to obtain the desired performance of dyed fibers (Kamel et al. 2011). However, to some extent, these metallic mordants are hazardous and normally generate wastewater that contains residual toxic metal ions from metal salts which may adversely impact the environment as well as public health (Shahid and Mohammad 2013; Lee et al. 2010). Hence, the main objectives of this study were to explore the scope of dyeing polyester fiber with henna dye at a high temperature and pressure without using any mordants followed by the analysis of color strength and colorfastness properties of the resulting dyed fabrics.|$|E

A design parameter for supersaturation controlled processes is introduced {{as a function of}} the supersaturation and time. Based on the design parameter and the simplified analytical model, the supersaturation setpoint and batch time are determined using an optimization approach to obtain a target distribution with a desired shape. A methodology is also described, which can be used to obtain the temperature profiles in the time domain, corresponding to a desired target CSD, providing a systematic direct design approach for practical applications and scale-up. Additionally, a method for designing the seed distribution is proposed, which can be used in conjunction with the supersaturation setpoint design, for shaping the product CSD.
