50|$|A single {{nanotube}} {{experiences a}} change in electrical resistance when experiencing stress or strain. This piezoresistive effect changes the current flow through the nanotube, which {{can be measured in}} order to accurately quantify the applied stress. A semi-random positioning of many overlapping nanotubes forms an electrically conducting network composed of many piezoresistive nanotubes. If the variance of the tube lengths and angles are known and controllable during manufacture, an eigensystem approach can be used to determine the expected current flow between any two points in the network. The tube network is embedded within orthopedic plates, clamps, and screws and in bone grafts {{in order to determine the}} state of bone healing by measuring the effect of a load on the <b>plate,</b> <b>clamp,</b> screw, or other fixation device attached to the bone. A healed bone will bear most of the load while a yet unhealed bone will defer the load to the fixation device wherein the nanotube network may measure the change in resistivity. Measurement is done wirelessly by electrical induction. This allows the doctor to accurately assess patient healing and also allows the patient to know how much stress the affected area may safely tolerate. Wolff's law indicates that bone responds positively to safe amounts of stress, which may be necessary for proper healing.|$|E

40|$|On {{the basis}} of {{three-dimensional}} elasticity, this paper presents a free vibration analysis of cross-ply laminated rectangular <b>plates</b> with <b>clamped</b> boundaries. The analysis {{is based on a}} recursive solution suitable for three-dimensional vibration analysis of simply supported <b>plates.</b> <b>Clamped</b> boundary conditions are imposed by suppressing the edge displacements of a number of planes which are parallel to the mid-plane. This is achieved by coupling a number of different vibration modes of the corresponding simply supported plate using a Lagrange multiplier method. A satisfactory solution can be obtained by choosing suitably larger numbers of the coupled vibration modes and the fixed planes across the thickness of the plate. Numerical results are presented to show the convergence of the solution. Results are also obtained for either isotropic or cross-ply laminated plates having different combinations of simply supported and clamped boundaries...|$|R

30|$|The {{values of}} ϖ shown in Figs.  7 and 8 clearly {{establish}} {{the superiority of}} <b>clamped</b> <b>plates</b> {{when compared to the}} simply supported ones for different aspect ratios and for any particular number of stiffeners considered here with two different orientations (i.e., along y- and both x- and y-directions). For such <b>clamped</b> <b>plates,</b> the preference of the aspect ratio is 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 for higher enhancement of fundamental frequency. It is evident from the above figures that for the same aspect ratio, the value of ϖ in case of simply supported boundary conditions is much less than that of the same number of stiffeners placed on the <b>clamped</b> <b>plates.</b> Hence, the <b>clamped</b> <b>plates</b> are preferred over the simply supported plates with/without placing any number of stiffeners with any type of orientation. Comparing the aspect ratios, it is observed that the square plates with aspect ratio 1 are more efficient than the rectangular plates having aspect ratios 1.5 and 2.0. Hence, the non-dimensional fundamental frequencies (ϖ) decrease with the increase in aspect ratios.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, we {{investigate}} universal inequalities for eigenvalues of a <b>clamped</b> <b>plate</b> problem on a bounded domain in an n-dimensional hyper-bolic space. It {{is well known}} that, for a bounded domain in the n-dimensional Euclidean space, Payne, Pólya and Weinberger (1955), Hook (1990) and Chen and Qian (1990) studied universal inequalities for eigenvalues of the <b>clamped</b> <b>plate</b> problem. Recently, Cheng and Yang (2006) have derived the Yang-type universal inequality for eigenvalues of the <b>clamped</b> <b>plate</b> problem on a bounded domain in the n-dimensional Euclidean space, which is sharper than the other ones. For a domain in a unit sphere, Wang and Xia (2007) have also given a universal inequality for eigenvalues. For a bounded domain in the n-dimensional hyperbolic space, although many mathematicians want to obtain a universal inequality for eigenvalues of the <b>clamped</b> <b>plate</b> problem, there are no results on universal inequalities for eigenvalues. The main reason that one could not derive a universal inequality is that one cannot find appropriate trial functions. In this paper, by constructing “nice ” trial functions, we obtain a universal inequality for eigenvalues of the <b>clamped</b> <b>plate</b> problem on a bounded domain in the hyperbolic space. Furthermore, we can prove that if the first eigenvalue of the <b>clamped</b> <b>plate</b> problem tends to (n− 1) 4 16 when the domain tends to the hyperbolic space, then all of the eigenvalues tend t...|$|R

40|$|The figure {{depicts a}} {{miniature}} cantilever-type anemometer {{that has been}} developed as a prototype of compact, relatively nonintrusive anemometers that can function at temperatures up to 600 C {{and that can be}} expected to be commercially mass-producible at low cost. The design of this anemometer, and especially the packaging aspect of the design, is intended to enable measurement of turbulence in the high-temperature, high-vibration environment of a turbine engine or in any similar environment. The main structural components of the anemometer include a single-crystal SiC cantilever and two polycrystalline SiC <b>clamping</b> <b>plates,</b> all made from chemical-vapor-deposited silicon carbide. Fabrication of these components from the same basic material eliminates thermal-expansion mismatch, which has introduced spurious thermomechanical stresses in cantilever-type anemometers of prior design. The <b>clamping</b> <b>plates</b> are heavily oxidized to improve electrical insulation at high temperature. A cavity that serves as a receptacle for the clamped end of the cantilever is etched into one end of one <b>clamping</b> <b>plate.</b> Trenches that collectively constitute a socket for a multipin electrical plug (for connection to external electronic circuitry) are etched into the opposite end of this <b>clamping</b> <b>plate.</b> Metal strips for electrical contact are deposited on one face of the other <b>clamping</b> <b>plate.</b> Piezoresistive single-crystal SiC thin-film strain gauges are etched in the n-type SiC epilayer in a Wheatstone-bridge configuration. Metal contact pads on the cantilever that extend into the clamping-receptacle area, are obtained by deposition and patterning using standard semiconductor photolithography and etching methods. The cantilever and the two <b>clamping</b> <b>plates</b> are assembled into a sandwich structure that is then clamped in a stainless-steel housing. The Wheatstone- bridge carrying SiC cantilever with the metal contact pads on the piezoresistors is slid into the receptacle in the bottom <b>clamping</b> <b>plate.</b> The top <b>clamping</b> <b>plate</b> is brought into contact with the bottom plate so that the narrow section of the metal strips on the top <b>clamp</b> <b>plate</b> aligns with the metal contact pads on the cantilever. When the parts are clamped together, the metal strips provide electrical connections between the Wheatstone-bridge contact points and the sides the trenches that constitute the socket for the multipin electrical plug. Hence, to connect the Wheatstone bridge to external circuitry for processing of the anemometer readout, one need only insert the plug in the socket. In operation, the cantilever end of the stainless-steel housing is mounted flush with an engine wall and the unclamped portion of the cantilever is exposed into the flow. The cantilever is deflected in direct proportion to the force induced by component of flow parallel to the engine wall and perpendicular to the broad exposed face of the cantilever. The maximum strain on the cantilever occurs at the clamped edge and is measured by the piezoresistors, which are located there. The corresponding changes in resistance manifest themselves in the output of the Wheatstone bridge...|$|R
