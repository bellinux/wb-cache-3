5000|$|Some {{supporters}} thought McPherson {{should have}} {{insisted on the}} jury trial and cleared her name. The grand jury inquiry concluded while enough evidence did not exist to try her, it did not indicate her story was true with its implication of kidnappers still at large. [...] Therefore, anyone could still accuse her of a hoax without fear of slander charges and frequently did so. McPherson, though, was treated harshly in many previous sessions at court, being verbally pressured in every way possible to change her story or elicit some bit of incriminating information. [...] Moreover, court costs to McPherson were estimated as high as US $100,000 dollars. <b>Payments</b> <b>to</b> <b>lawyers</b> and other defense costs, according to the IRS, {{were not part of}} church operating expenditure and therefore constituted a tax liability that the Angelus Temple had to raise money to cover. A jury trial could take months. McPherson moved on to other projects. In 1927 she published a book about her version of the kidnapping: In the Service of the King: The Story of My Life.|$|E
5000|$|The {{result was}} {{a system that is}} vastly more {{efficient}} and reliable in delivering compensation than the American tort system. Tanase estimated that legal fees comprised only two percent of the total compensation paid to injured persons and that mediating and claims process costs amounted to about 0.2 percent of the total. In the United States, according to a survey in the late 1980s, 24 percent of individuals hurt in motor vehicle accidents involving potential defendants hired a lawyer, and the figure went up to 57 percent for victims with [...] "serious injuries" [...] (fractures, burns, or worse). When the claimant hires a lawyer, the defendant or her insurance company generally employ a lawyer too. In consequence, according to two big studies of motor vehicle accident tort claims (not just lawsuits), <b>payments</b> <b>to</b> <b>lawyers</b> equalled 47 percent of the total personal injury benefits paid by liability insurers to third-party accident victims. This expense drives up the cost of insurance to the point that huge numbers of drivers are uninsured or underinsured, which means that victims of their negligent driving will get little or nothing from the tort system.|$|E

500|$|On January9, {{newspapers}} printed {{allegations that}} Hanna had arranged to bribe John Otis, {{one of the}} Silver Republicans from Cincinnati. [...] Otis alleged that he was offered $10,000 and was actually paid $1,750. [...] The individual said to have offered the money, a New Yorker named Henry H.Boyce, had met with Hanna adviser Estes Rathbone at least twice. [...] Boyce denied trying to bribe Otis, though he did admit to giving a retainer <b>payment</b> <b>to</b> Otis's <b>lawyer,</b> and fled the state when the matter became public. [...] Hanna denied any involvement. His opponents hoped that the incident would preface his defeat, while his supporters feared the story would prompt a public outcry. Croly and Horner agree that the allegations had little impact on public opinion.|$|R
