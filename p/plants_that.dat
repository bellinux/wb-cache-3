5|$|The terms {{cultigen}} and cultivar may {{be confused}} with each other. Cultigen is a general-purpose term for <b>plants</b> <b>that</b> have been deliberately altered or specially selected by humans, while cultivar is a formal classification category. Cultigens include not only plants with cultivar names but also those with names in the classification categories of grex and Group. The Cultivated Plant Code points out that cultigens are: deliberately selected <b>plants</b> <b>that</b> may have arisen by intentional or accidental hybridization in cultivation, by selection from existing cultivated stocks, or from variants within wild populations that are maintained as recognizable entities solely by continued propagation. Included within the group of plants known as cultigens are genetically modified plants, plants with binomial Latin names that {{are the result of}} ancient human selection, and any <b>plants</b> <b>that</b> have been altered by humans but which have not been given formal names. In practice most cultigens are cultivars.|$|E

5|$|Turkey's {{extraordinary}} ecosystem {{and habitat}} diversity has produced considerable species diversity.

The diversity of Turkey's fauna is even greater than that of its flora. The number of animal species in the whole of Europe is around 60,000, while in Turkey there are over 80,000 (over 100,000 counting the subspecies).|$|E

5|$|In {{regions of}} the Old World where they are indigenous, honeybees (Apis mellifera) {{are among the most}} {{important}} pollinators, vital to sustain natural habitats there in addition to their value for human societies (to sustain food resources). Where honeybee populations decline, there is also a decline in plant populations. In agriculture, some plants are completely dependent on honeybees to pollinate them to produce fruit, while other plants are only dependent on honeybees to enhance their capacity to produce better and healthier fruits. Honeybees also help plants to reduce time between flowering and fruit set, which reduces risk from harmful factors such as pests, diseases, chemicals, weather, etc. Specialist <b>plants</b> <b>that</b> require honeybees will be at more risk if honeybees decline, whereas generalist <b>plants</b> <b>that</b> use other animals as pollinators (or wind pollinating or self-pollinating) will suffer less because they have other sources of pollination.|$|E
5|$|Many pets {{have escaped}} or been {{released}} into the Everglades from the surrounding urban areas. Some find the conditions quite favorable and have established self-sustaining populations, competing for food and space with native animals. Many tropical fish have been released, but blue tilapias (Oreochromis aureus) cause damage to shallow waterways by creating large nests and consuming aquatic <b>plants</b> <b>that</b> protect native young fish.|$|E

5|$|Many {{species of}} insects are toxic or distasteful {{when they have}} fed on certain <b>plants</b> <b>that</b> contain {{chemicals}} of particular classes, but not when they have fed on <b>plants</b> <b>that</b> lack those chemicals. For instance, some species of the subfamily Danainae feed on various species of the Asclepiadoideae in the family Apocynaceae, which render them poisonous and emetic to most predators. Such insects frequently are aposematically coloured and patterned. When feeding on innocuous plants however, they are harmless and nutritious, but a bird that once has sampled a toxic specimen is unlikely to eat harmless specimens that have the same aposematic coloration. When regarded as mimicry of toxic {{members of the same}} species, this too may be seen as automimicry.|$|E

5|$|One {{prevailing}} {{idea is that}} carnivory {{in plants}} is not {{a black and white}} duality, but rather a spectrum from strict non-carnivorous photoautotrophs (a rose, for example) to fully carnivorous plants with active trapping mechanisms like those of Dionaea or Aldrovanda. However, passive traps are still considered fully carnivorous. <b>Plants</b> <b>that</b> fall between the definitions in the strict carnivorous/non-carnivorous demarcation can be defined as being protocarnivorous.|$|E
