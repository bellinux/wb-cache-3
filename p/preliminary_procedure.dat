50|$|Innovative {{aspects of}} the codes notwithstanding, certain {{provisions}} reflected traditional attitudes toward authority. The prosecutor represented the state and sat with the judge on a raised platform—his position above the defendant and the defense counsel suggesting their relative status. Under a semi-inquisitorial system, primary responsibility for questioning witnesses lay with the judge, and defense counsel could question witnesses only through the judge. Cases were referred to trial only after a judge presided over a preliminary fact-finding investigation in which the suspect was not permitted counsel. Because in all trials available evidence had already convinced the court in a <b>preliminary</b> <b>procedure,</b> the defendant's legal presumption of innocence at trial was undermined, and the legal recourse open to his counsel was further weakened.|$|E
5000|$|The 1876 Larousse dictionary, p. 1479, wrote thus:The name of zététiques, {{which means}} seekers, {{indicates}} a rather original nuance of skepticism: it is provisional skepticism, it {{is close to}} Descartes' idea about doubt as a means, not as an end, as a <b>preliminary</b> <b>procedure,</b> not as a definitive result. If all skeptics really were zététiques and only zététiques, they would have said with Pyrrho: [...] "We do not arrive at doubt, but at the suspension of judgement" [...] (...) skeptics literally mean examiners, people who think, reflect, study attentively; {{but in the long}} run they take a more negative than doutbful stance, and has meant that those who are under the pretext of always examining never decide. (...) the word zététiques is not made to resolve the debate between the two meanings of all these terms (...) Moreover, the name zététiques has remained on the ground of the school that created it; and, despite its wide expansion, which would have helped make the term general for all seekers of truth in all fields, it is exclusively applied to skeptics, and we could even say to Greek skeptics or Pyrrhonists.|$|E

40|$|<b>Preliminary</b> <b>procedures</b> {{have been}} {{developed}} for the ball milling of pristine and brominated P- 100 graphite fibers. Because of the lubricative properties of graphite, large ball loads (50 percent by volume) are required. Use of 2 -propanol as a milling medium enhances the efficiency of the process. The fibers, when allowed to settle from the milling medium, tend to be preferentially aligned with rather few fibers standing up. Milled, brominated P- 100 fibers have resistivities that are indistinguishable from their pristine counterparts, apparently because of loss of bromine. This suggests that bromine would not be the intercalate of choice in applications where milled fibers of this type are required.

Awarded the European Association of Tax Law Professors (EATLP) 2016 Tax Thesis Award in Munich, Germany, June 2016. This {{dissertation}} {{purports to}} connect the <b>preliminary</b> reference <b>procedure</b> with direct taxation. The aim of my dissertation is to lay down how this essential mechanism {{for the development of}} EU law – the <b>preliminary</b> reference <b>procedure</b> – deals with the cases in the field of direct taxation. By analyzing the preliminary rulings in the particular field, this thesis will shed light on the meaning of judicial cooperation between the Court of Justice of the European Union (“Court”) and the national courts. The almost absence of harmonized direct taxation reached at the European level enables the Court throughout the <b>preliminary</b> reference <b>procedure</b> to become the only available actor to safeguard the rights conferred to the individuals by EU law. In the area of direct taxation, it encompasses the rights of the individuals to exercise the fundamental Treaty freedoms of circulation. Therefore, the entrenchment of the rights of the individuals requires national courts requesting questions for preliminary rulings whereby national tax law in breach of EU law is challenged. Accordingly, this narrative of “protection of EU rights” which is embedded within article 267 TFEU enables the Court to adopt the role of a constitutional court assessing the compatibility of national law with EU law. The current asymmetries and conceptual mismatches of the substantive case law in the field of direct taxation are firmly anchored in a <b>preliminary</b> reference <b>procedure</b> in which the Court, as a constitutional court, is endowed with discretionary powers to drive it...|$|R

The limitations stem from the consideration of the <b>preliminary</b> reference <b>procedure</b> as a tool to ensure effective judicial protection.
