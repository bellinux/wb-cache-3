500|$|In April 2008 {{a former}} Mayor, Mohammed Choudhary, was convicted {{for making a}} false instrument, namely a <b>poll</b> <b>card,</b> in {{connection}} with vote-rigging allegations during the 2004 election. In May 2008 chief executive, Gillian Beasley, said [...] "People can have confidence in this result because measures that {{have been put in}} place have ensured that the vote was carried out within the law." [...] Beasley also revealed the city council was to write a report on tackling election fraud, after the Electoral Commission said it could be adopted as best practice. As part of the drive to reduce election fraud, the council sent out blank registration forms, resulting in more than 8,000 people falling off the electoral roll.|$|E
5000|$|An {{official}} <b>poll</b> <b>card</b> is {{a document}} which {{is sent to}} all registered voters shortly before an election in the United Kingdom. The <b>poll</b> <b>card</b> gives information about the election and the voter such as {{the date of the}} election, the location of the polling station, opening and closing times and the name, address and electoral number of the voter.|$|E
50|$|For {{the first}} time, voters could print out their <b>polling</b> <b>cards</b> from the Elections Department website {{if they do}} not receive them in the mail.|$|R
50|$|Kingston-upon-Thames Council and the Electoral Commission {{stated that}} Jakub Pawlowski, a Polish voter in Kingston-upon-Thames {{declared}} himself as being British on his registration form, and hence, received a referendum <b>polling</b> <b>card</b> in the post, {{although he is}} not a UK citizen and did {{not have the right to}} receive such a <b>polling</b> <b>card.</b> The voter stated that he specified that he is a Polish citizen when registering on the electoral roll, but, still received the card in the post. The matter had been referred to the police.|$|R
50|$|Sections 91 to 94 entitle the {{candidate}} to one free mailshot of election material to all {{voters in the}} constituency. It is also illegal to print fake <b>polling</b> <b>cards.</b>|$|R

50|$|While Foy, who legally {{changed her}} first names in November 1993, {{was able to}} obtain passport, driving license, medical <b>card,</b> and <b>polling</b> <b>card</b> in the new name, her request to amend the sex on her birth {{certificate}} was refused.|$|R
5000|$|The {{second phase}} of the {{election}} was also marred by violence, misuse of state resources, and other violations of election laws. Hundreds of incidents were reported including one murder. Events in the north of the country were particularly bad. There were reports of vote buying, intimidation by armed groups, grabbing of <b>polling</b> <b>cards,</b> election violations and a general fear psychosis in the north. Independent monitors observed blatant violations including open bribery and the transporting of party supporters to the wide abuse of state machinery and other resources, all in favour of the UPFA. Voters were offered food or even cash for their <b>poll</b> <b>cards.</b> Numerous UPFA government ministers and even the President visited the north during the election campaign, and very often they inaugurated new development projects. The whole state machinery in the north, including the military, police, provincial council and district secretariats, were used to support the campaign of the UPFA. A TNA election meeting in Alaveddy on 16 June 2011 was attacked by the Sri Lankan military. Other acts of intimidation against the TNA by the military and the paramilitary EPDP include the severed head of a dog being impaled on the gates of a TNA candidate in Manipay; a shot dead dog being thrown into the private well of leading TNA member in Thirunelvely; sewage, mud and stones being thrown onto the house of a TNA candidate in Valvettithurai; funeral wreath and cremation ash being left at the home of a TNA candidate in Kodikamam; and motor oil being thrown onto the house of a TNA candidate in Sandilipay. On the eve of voting government backed paramilitaries confiscated thousands <b>polling</b> <b>cards</b> from voters in Kilinochchi and threatened them violence.|$|R
50|$|At each polling station, tellers {{for each}} party will collect the unique poll numbers of voters from their <b>polling</b> <b>cards.</b> These numbers are {{regularly}} {{collected from the}} polling stations and collated in a campaign headquarters for each ward, often {{referred to in the}} UK as a committee room. 'Promised voters' who have already voted are then crossed off the list of voters canvassed as supporting Labour. This enables campaigners to then focus more efficiently on the remainder of their supporters who have not voted. Computerisation has heralded further increases in efficiency, but nearly all subsequent methodologies can be traced back in some form to the Reading system.|$|R
50|$|Polling {{stations}} (also {{known as}} polling places) are open from 7am to 10pm on polling day. Voters receive a <b>poll</b> <b>card</b> from the returning officer at their local authority with {{details of their}} allocated polling place. They {{are not required to}} show their <b>poll</b> <b>card</b> (unless they are an anonymous elector) or any other form of identification at the polling place in order to vote, except in Northern Ireland, where one piece of photographic ID (current or expired) must be presented at the polling station - a NI Electoral Identity Card, a photographic NI or GB or other EEA driving licence, a British or other EU passport, a Translink 60+ SmartPass, a Translink Senior SmartPass, a Translink Blind Person's SmartPass or a Translink War Disabled SmartPass.|$|E
50|$|Tellers {{are often}} present outside the polling station {{and record the}} elector number (as it appears on the Electoral Register and <b>poll</b> <b>card)</b> {{of those who have}} voted. Tellers {{volunteer}} on behalf of political parties (identifiable by their rosette), but have no legal or official status, and voters are not obliged to give them their elector number. By recording who has voted, tellers help their parties identify supporters who have not yet voted, {{so that they can be}} contacted and encouraged to vote, and offered assistance — such as transport to the polling station — if necessary.|$|E
50|$|Each {{party or}} coalition, by law, had to {{register}} and announce whether it supported or disapproved {{of the proposed}} amendment; this was announced in the short gazette that was distributed along with the <b>poll</b> <b>card.</b> Since this assertion was binding on the members elected, the election was de facto {{a referendum on the}} proposed amendments. Only the Kuomintang, the governing DPP, and the three minor party registered their support for the amendments; the others have announced objection.Notably, the political tendencies dubbed pan-green and pan-blue coalitions were each split down the middle in their opinions on the proposed amendments, with the dominant partner in each coalition supporting the amendments, probably because the proposed electoral system would benefit large parties.|$|E
50|$|Several unusual events {{attracted}} attention {{during the}} campaign {{with one of the}} Labour candidates, James Grant, having to withdraw a campaign leaflet after it was sent out with his name spelt wrongly as Jim Gant. In another incident a yorkshire terrier was reported as having received a <b>polling</b> <b>card</b> for the election, with his owner being faced with being charged with supplying false electoral information and as a result had to write a letter of apology. Meanwhile, Swindon council got a look-alike of Captain Jack Sparrow to hand out balloons and leaflets on the election in an attempt to increasse interest in the election.|$|R
2500|$|In Chester {{there were}} reports that 600 {{registered}} voters were unable to vote because the electoral roll had not been updated, while in Hackney, Islington, Leeds, Lewisham, Manchester, Newcastle and Sheffield long queues led to many voters being turned away and unable to vote as the [...] deadline arrived. Some dissatisfied voters staged sit-ins to protest against what some of them had called [...] "disenfranchisement". In Liverpool, higher than expected turnout meant several polling stations ran out of ballot papers, with defeated council leader Warren Bradley stating that some residents were unable to cast their votes. In Wyre and Preston North, a 14-year-old boy cast a vote after being sent a <b>polling</b> <b>card.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{constituency}} or municipal electoral committees supervise local {{implementation of}} the elections and their compliance with law, form polling district committees, control expenditure of the polling district committees, register election observers, monitor voting by post, voting at health care institutions, military units, penal institutions, as well as organize early voting. Constituency or municipal electoral committees also monitor political advertising. The polling district committees provide conditions for voters to familiarize themselves with electoral lists, deliver <b>poll</b> <b>cards</b> to voters, investigate complaints about the errors made in electoral rolls, monitor postal voting, organize voting at home, prepare polling stations, organize voting on the election day, count votes and consider complaints from voters and observers. Members of the committees are remunerated for their work by the state.|$|R

2500|$|Voters receive <b>poll</b> <b>cards</b> informing them of {{the polling}} {{stations}} where they can cast their votes in person. Polling day at a general election is a public holiday, and voting is compulsory. Unless the returning officer decides otherwise, polling stations are open from 8:00am to 8:00pm on polling day. To vote, voters {{must go to the}} polling stations assigned to them. Applying for a ballot paper or voting in the name of someone else, or attempting to vote more than once, amounts to the offence of personation. If a person claiming to be a voter named in the electoral register turns up at a polling station after someone also claiming to be that voter has already voted, the second person is permitted to cast what is called a [...] "tendered vote" [...] using a ballot paper of a different colour after taking an oath to confirm his identity.|$|R
50|$|Working as a pundit for the Austrian Broadcasting Corporation ORF, Prohaska {{suggested}} at the 2006 World Cup that referee Graham <b>Poll's</b> famous yellow <b>card</b> blunder was {{a result}} of heavy alcohol consumption before the match.|$|R
5000|$|In Canada, the Federal {{government}} mails an Elections Canada {{registration confirmation}} card, which the voter {{takes to the}} <b>polling</b> station. The <b>card</b> tells the individual where and when to vote. Voters must prove their identity and address with one of three options: ...|$|R
50|$|VSATs {{are used}} to {{transmit}} narrowband data (e.g., point-of-sale transactions using credit <b>cards,</b> <b>polling</b> or RFID data, or SCADA), or broadband data (for the provision of satellite Internet access to remote locations, VoIP or video). VSATs are also used for transportable, on-the-move (utilising phased array antennas) or mobile maritime communications.|$|R

He began racing in the USAC sprint car series in 2004, and in 2006 won National Sprint Car Hall of Fame Driver <b>Poll</b> Wild <b>Card</b> in both the 360 and 410 winged sprint car divisions. Stenhouse won dual Rookie of the Year honors in the United States Auto Club sprint car (finished 6th in the standings) and midget (finished 3rd in the standings) series in 2007.|$|R
50|$|It {{should be}} noted that the results {{displayed}} in this article excludes results for spontaneous <b>polls</b> (in which <b>cards</b> with the names of likely candidates are not presented to researched voters), due to the significant amount of voters that would vote on Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. By law, leaders of all stances of the Executive branch can only be re-elected once.|$|R
50|$|In {{some states}} an unenrolled voter who votes {{in a presidential}} primary {{automatically}} becomes enrolled in the party for which their vote was cast, unless they take a simple step to elect to do otherwise. Typically these states allow unenrolled Americans to switch parties after casting their vote in national elections by providing them with signature <b>cards</b> at <b>polling</b> stations. These <b>cards</b> have a box where party affiliation may be declared as Democrat, Republican, Unenrolled or other.|$|R
