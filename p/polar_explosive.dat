40|$|Even {{a single}} excess {{electron}} or ion migrating {{on the surface}} of sensitive explosives can catalyze their gradual exothermic decomposition. Mechanisms underlying such a charge-induced gradual thermal decomposition of highly sensitive explosives can be different. If sensitive explosive is a polar liquid, intense charge-dipole attraction between excess surface charges and surrounding explosive molecules can result in repetitive attempts of solvation of these charges by <b>polar</b> <b>explosive</b> molecules. Every attempt of such uncompleted nonequilibrium solvation causes local exothermic decomposition of thermolabile polar molecules accompanied by further thermal jumping unsolvated excess charges to new surface sites. Thus, ionized mobile hot spots emerge on charged explosive surface. Stochastic migration of ionized hot spots on explosive surface causes gradual exothermic decomposition of the whole mass of the <b>polar</b> <b>explosive.</b> The similar gradual charge-catalyzed exothermic decomposition of both polar and nonpolar highly sensitive explosives can be also caused by intense charge-dipole attacks of surrounding water vapor molecules electrostatically attracted from ambient humid air and strongly accelerated towards charged sites on explosive surfaces. Emission of electrons, photons and heat from ionized hot spots randomly migrating on charged surface of highly sensitive explosive aerosol nanoparticles converts such particles into the form of short-circuited thermionic nanobatteries.

40|$|Organic {{pollutants}} {{that are}} {{released into the}} environment are subjected to various chemical, photochemical and microbiological transformation processes. As a result, {{a variety of new}} and unexpected transformation products can be formed and, as a rule, they are more polar than the parent compounds. While the parent compounds and some of their known metabolites are analyzed with optimized analytical methods (target analysis) unknown transformation products and metabolites have often been overlooked in the past. Today, the combined use of LC-NMR and LC-MS techniques offer the possibility to identify unknown compounds in environmental samples routinely (non-target analysis). General aspects of this new analytical approach are discussed and examples of application are reported, which cover the characterization of <b>polar</b> <b>explosives</b> and related compounds in groundwater samples from ammunition waste sites. Via the example of biodegradation of mononitrotoluenes, it is further sho wn how non-target analysis can complement the investigation of the fate of environmental pollutants...|$|R

40|$|High {{performance}} specifications and unique functionality of chromatographic techniques is a demand of pharmaceutical industry and research. This {{leads to the}} origin of Supercritical Fluid Chromatography (SFC). It is a rapidly expanding analytical technique. The main feature that differentiates SFC from other chromatographic techniques is the replacement of either the liquid or gas mobile phase with a supercritical fluid mobile phase. It is considered a hybrid of GC and LC technique. High diffusion coefficient and low viscosity of supercritical fluids is responsible for high speed analysis, high efficiency and high sensitivity. Low mobile-phase flow rate, density programming and compatability with GC and LC detectors make SFC a versatile chromatographic technique in analytical re-search and development. It has a unique characteristic of analyzing thermo labile or non-volatile substances. This review highlights the role of supercritical fluid chromatography in the separation of polymers, thermally labile pesticides, fatty acids, metal chelates and organometallic compounds, chiral and achiral molecules, identification and analysis of <b>polar</b> samples, <b>explosives,</b> drugs of abuse and application of SFC in forensic science (fingerprint-ing) ...|$|R
40|$|A large {{observation}} network with the SuperDARN radars and other ground-based instruments at manned and unmanned stations is currently {{developed in the}} Antarctic area from sub-auroral latitudes to polar cap region and from nightside to dayside hours under international collaboration. Such a wide-spread circumpolar {{observation network}} is very unique and powerful for studies on the phenomena which occur due to the Sun-Earth interaction, e. g., direct entry of solar wind energy and momentum into the cusp and <b>polar</b> cap regions, <b>explosive</b> energy dissipation during substorm-time, highly energetic particle precipitation into the atmosphere during storm-time. In the coming phase IX of the Japanese Antarctic Research project, coordinated observations with several magnetospheric satellite projects, e. g., MMS (Magnetospheric Multiscale Mission), ERG (Energization and Radiation in Geospace), etc., can be expected第 4 回極域科学シンポジウム特別セッション：[S] 南極研究の将来展望―第Ⅸ期 6 か年計画策定に向けて 11 月 14 日（木） 国立極地研究所 ２階大会議...|$|R
