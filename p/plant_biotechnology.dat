25|$|Costing around $600 million, over 50 years, the {{revolution}} brought new farming technology, increased productivity, expanded crop yields and mass fertilization to many countries throughout the world. Later it funded over $100 million of <b>plant</b> <b>biotechnology</b> research and trained over four hundred scientists from Asia, Africa and Latin America. It also {{invested in the}} production of transgenic crops, including rice and maize. In 1999, the then president Gordon Conway addressed the Monsanto Company board of directors, warning of the possible social and environmental dangers of this biotechnology, and requesting them to disavow the use of so-called terminator genes; the company later complied.|$|E

500|$|The {{hypothesis}} that plant {{growth and development}} is coordinated by plant hormones or plant growth regulators first emerged in the late 19th century. Darwin experimented on the movements of plant shoots and roots towards light and gravity, and concluded [...] "It is hardly an {{exaggeration to say that}} the tip of the radicle [...] [...] acts like the brain of one of the lower animals [...] [...] directing the several movements". About the same time, the role of auxins (from the Greek auxein, to grow) in control of plant growth was first outlined by the Dutch scientist Frits Went. The first known auxin, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), which promotes cell growth, was only isolated from plants about 50 years later. This compound mediates the tropic responses of shoots and roots towards light and gravity. The finding in 1939 that plant callus could be maintained in culture containing IAA, followed by the observation in 1947 that it could be induced to form roots and shoots by controlling the concentration of growth hormones were key steps in the development of <b>plant</b> <b>biotechnology</b> and genetic modification.|$|E

40|$|Public {{debate about}} the ethical {{acceptability}} of genetically modified (GM) plants in general and GM food in particular, is highly polarized. Proponents of GM products passionately argue that novel gene technologies {{have the potential to}} contribute to more efficient agricultural processes, promote environmental sustainability, and curb malnutrition in the developing world. Opponents of novel <b>plant</b> <b>biotechnologies,</b> counter with equal vehemence, that GM products are unnatural, potentially harmful to humans, and capable of catastrophic environmental injury. As more uses for GM products are realised, and investment in <b>plant</b> <b>biotechnologies</b> continues to grow, both groups have stepped up advocacy of their respective views in academic and public forums. Both sides continue to be at loggerheads with one another, in trying to force the public to choose between their two opposing views. This research discusses in detail the most prominent arguments put forward in favour of, and in opposition to, the development and use of novel <b>plant</b> <b>biotechnologies.</b> It covers developing and industrialized contexts and describes the most likely applications of GM products within these contexts. The principal approach used in this analysis is one that embraces a spirit of pragmatism in its commitment to moving forward through the traditional impasse in which ethical and policy debates often finds themselves. This project sets out to clarify the issues, explore the most salient of these, and make suggestions about the best ways to move the debate forward. Early on in this work it is established that within specified constraints, novel plant technologies have the capacity to make a substantial contribution to agricultural practices, the environment, and the wider community. These assumptions are carried throughout the project and serve as points of departure in discussions about the ethical concerns raised by the application of novel genetic technologies to plants. One of the aims of this research is to produce a piece of work that can inform future policy decisions related to agricultural and environmental applications of GM technologies in Australia and elsewhere. I hope that the discussion presented here goes some way to achieving this goal and that it provides a coherent and plausible articulation of the issues...|$|R
