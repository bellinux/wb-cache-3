Also, some single-engined general aviation aircraft that are primarily meant to operate from unimproved surfaces, such as bush planes and cropdusters, have their taildragger gear's main wheels equipped with positive-cambered main wheels to better handle the deflection of the landing gear, as the aircraft settles on rough, unpaved airstrips.|$|E
40|$|Summary The {{induced drag}} of non-planar wings is {{compared}} to that of planar wings which result from unfolding the non-planar ones. It is shown that due to the induced lift, there exist non-planar configurations with <b>positive</b> span <b>camber</b> that have an overall aerodynamic performance increase in comparison to the planar ones. The induced lift and increment of aerodynamic performance increases with decreasing aspect ratio. The effect is opposite for configurations with negative camber. Without the induced lift, the positive non-planar configuration would have more induced drag. Analysis is performed using a lifting line method, which takes into account the induced lift, and using Euler solutions. For the inviscid solutions, the induced drag is obtained with a far-field drag analysis method. ...|$|R
50|$|A {{dependent}} suspension normally has a beam (a simple 'cart' axle) or (driven) {{live axle}} that holds wheels parallel {{to each other}} and perpendicular to the axle. When the camber of one wheel changes, the camber of the opposite wheel changes in the same way (by convention on one side this is a <b>positive</b> change in <b>camber</b> {{and on the other side}} this a negative change). De Dion suspensions are also in this category as they rigidly connect the wheels together.|$|R
40|$|In this study, flutter {{analyses}} are performed for generic adaptive camber wings with hingeless trailing edge control surfaces. These control surfaces {{operate based on}} a concept that exploits the controlled flexibility of the semi-open secondary wing structure. By introducing structural modifications that allow for chordwise sliding between upper and lower skin panels, <b>positive</b> or negative <b>camber</b> changes may be realized for the wing. Using MSC ® PATRAN package, wing finite element models are created. In these models, components of the adaptive camber wing, i. e. front and rear spars, spar caps, skins, ribs, stringers and control bars are defined as separate property regions. In order to model the hingeless control surfaces, multi-point-constraints (MPC) are used to represent the sliding action, {{as well as the}} interactions between several components. In aeroelastic models created using MSC® FLDS, structural and aerodynamic degrees-of-freedom (dof) are coupled to each other using infinite plate spline functions. The unsteady aerodynamic loads are represented using the Doublet-Lattice Method (DLM). In numerical analyses performed, two different wing configurations are considered, namely Wings A and B. In Wing A, a single hingeless control surface extends throughout the full wing span. Wing B has the same structural properties as Wing A, except for the hingeless control surface, which is split into two equal sized parts. The results of the free vibration analyses show that for both wing configurations, the control surface motion is highly coupled to the bending and torsion type global modes. Furthermore, in the second configuration, additional local modes are observed for the control surface. As a final study, p-k method is employed to calculate flutter speeds for Wings A and B and to identify the modes of instability...|$|R

50|$|Double {{wishbone}} suspension provides the engineer more free parameters {{than some other}} types do. It is fairly easy {{to work out the}} effect of moving each joint, so the kinematics of the suspension can be tuned easily and wheel motion can be optimized. It is also easy to work out the loads that different parts will be subjected to which allows more optimised lightweight parts to be designed. They also provide increasing negative camber gain all the way to full jounce travel, unlike the MacPherson strut, which provides negative camber gain only at the beginning of jounce travel and then reverses into <b>positive</b> <b>camber</b> gain at high jounce amounts.|$|E
5000|$|The {{double-wishbone}} suspension {{can also be}} referred to as [...] "double A-arms", though the arms themselves can be A-shaped, L-shaped, or even a single bar linkage. A single wishbone or A-arm can also be used in various other suspension types, such as variations of the MacPherson strut. The upper arm is usually shorter to induce [...] negative camber as the suspension jounces (rises), and often this arrangement is titled an [...] "SLA" [...] or [...] "short long arms" [...] suspension. When the vehicle is in a turn, body roll results in <b>positive</b> <b>camber</b> gain on the lightly loaded inside wheel, while the heavily loaded outer wheel gains negative camber.|$|E
50|$|The Hillman Imp {{designers}} {{learned from}} {{the problems with the}} Corvair, having crashed one at a relatively low speed, and designed their rear-engined car with semi-trailing arm suspension at the rear. To attain correct handling balance, they actually used swing axle geometry at the front, with the steering pivots mounted at the outer ends of single swing wishbones. These caused too much understeer and uneven tyre wear, and modifications were made to reduce the <b>positive</b> <b>camber</b> of the front wheels by lowering the swing axle pivot points. Aftermarket kits were also available to do this, and an inexpensive alternative was to insert a tapered shim to change the inclination of the kingpin carrier relative to the wishbone.|$|E
50|$|When a {{wheel is}} set up to have some camber angle, the {{interaction}} between the tire and road surface causes the wheel to tend to want to roll in a curve, as if it were part of a conical surface (camber thrust). This tendency to turn increases the rolling resistance as well as increasing tire wear. A small degree of toe (toe-out for negative camber, toe-in for <b>positive</b> <b>camber)</b> will cancel this turning tendency, reducing wear and rolling resistance. On some competition vehicles such as go-karts, especially where power is extremely limited and is highly regulated by the rules of the sport, these effects can become very significant in terms of competitiveness and performance.Toe-in and toe-out give the steering stability.|$|E
50|$|Camber angle {{alters the}} {{handling}} qualities {{of a particular}} suspension design; in particular, negative camber improves grip when cornering. This is because it places the tire at a better angle to the road, transmitting the forces through the vertical plane of the tire rather than through a shear force across it. Another reason for negative camber is that a rubber tire tends to roll on itself while cornering. The inside edge of the contact patch would begin to lift off of the ground if the tire had zero camber, reducing {{the area of the}} contact patch. This effect is compensated for by applying negative camber, maximizing the contact patch area. Note that this is only true for the outside tire during the turn; the inside tire would benefit most from <b>positive</b> <b>camber.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A {{number of}} {{performance}} upgrades {{were available for}} Vitesses, during and after production. Many were provided by SAH Accessories, later owned by Dunham and Haines in Dunstable, north of London. The [...] "Tite-a-turn" [...] modification {{was an attempt to}} tame the early swing axle suspension by increasing the resistance to suspension extension on the inside rear wheel (and the transition into <b>positive</b> <b>camber)</b> while allowing normal compression into negative camber on the outer wheel. Engine modifications went from simple cosmetics like an alloy rocker cover to more serious changes. Alloy manifolds for triple twin-choke Weber or Dellorto carburetors were available and gave considerable improvements in acceleration and top speed especially if coupled with SAH's tubular exhaust manifolds (2x3 into 1, then 2 into 1), straight through rear box/twin boxes and camshaft changes.|$|E
50|$|A {{lift and}} drag curve {{obtained}} in wind tunnel testing is {{shown on the}} right. The curve represents an airfoil with a <b>positive</b> <b>camber</b> so some lift is produced at zero angle of attack. With increased angle of attack, lift increases in a roughly linear relation, called {{the slope of the}} lift curve. At about 18 degrees this airfoil stalls, and lift falls off quickly beyond that. The drop in lift {{can be explained by the}} action of the upper-surface boundary layer, which separates and greatly thickens over the upper surface at and past the stall angle. The thickened boundary layer's displacement thickness changes the airfoil's effective shape, in particular it reduces its effective camber, which modifies the overall flow field so as to reduce the circulation and the lift. The thicker boundary layer also causes a large increase in pressure drag, so that the overall drag increases sharply near and past the stall point.|$|E

40|$|The fifth digits (D 5) of 22 {{species of}} Australian bats were compared. Unloaded, all species had {{positive}} wing camber values between 6. 5 and 11. 4 %. During the measurements on live individuals two species were observed to entirely straighten D 5, including the inherently cambered metacarpal- 5 (M 5) (1. 5 to 5. 6 %). To explain this capability, preserved specimens of all species were assessed {{in terms of}} the metacarpal's unloaded camber, tendon alignments, cross-sectional aspect ratio, various length ratios, bending stiffness, bone density and tendon insertions onto the metacarpo-phalangeal joint. The four species that migrate or commute long distances at high speeds have anatomical mechanisms that could eliminate the camber of their fifth digit, including its metacarpal, thereby optimising their high flight speed performance (Mormopterus beccarii, M. loriae, M. planiceps and Tadarida australis). They were distinctive among the 22 species assessed because: (1) their extensor tendon was aligned directly above the M 5 's elastic axis over the full length of the bone, (2) this tendon had additional insertions in the metacarpo-phalangeal joint that were correctly positioned to straighten the <b>positive</b> <b>camber</b> inherent in the M 5, (3) the metacarpo-phalangeal joint capsule was appropriately reinforced to support the additional insertions, (4) their M 5 showed a distinctive pattern of bending stiffness values in the sagittal plane appropriately graded for straightening the bone and (5) when exposed and tensioned manually, the extensor tendon did straighten the shaft of M 5...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe use {{of small}} RPAS (Remotely Piloted Aircraft System) in {{atmospheric}} research has increased {{because of their}} compact size and ease of operation. However, their relatively lower performance compared to bigger UAVs highly limits the endurance, range, and payload capabilities. This paper presents an optimized RPAS which is designed for atmospheric research mission in mind particularly for the VOLTIGE (Vecteur d'Observation de la Troposphère pour l'Investigation et la Gestion de l'Environnement) project where a fleet of UAVs will fly simultaneously {{in and out of}} fog. A flying-wing configuration with four control-surface is designed to separate elevator and aileron controls. Span-wise surface area distribution is optimized with vortex-lattice method in order to take advantage of individual elevator use for better span efficiency and lift generation by <b>positive</b> <b>camber</b> change. This particular behavior on a flying-wing configuration reduces the required pitch angle envelope and oscillations which is beneficial for the turbulence and albedo measurements. High frequency data logging system is integrated into the main autopilot and communication between payload is improved in order to synchronize attitude and payload measurements and have an efficient sensor-based navigation. The result of the synergetic optimization leads to an RPAS (called FENIX) with the capability of flying up to two hours with 150 grams of payload, while keeping the hand-launch capability as a constraint, for regular atmospheric research missions. After several flight campaigns and field tests, further improvements are taken into consideration for a better mission performance and ease of operation. The modifications are in-progress within the hopes that they will change the way scientists utilize the small RPAS, and adapt the missions with the new available improved performance...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{influence}} of road camber on the stability of single-track road vehicles. Road camber changes the magnitude {{and direction of the}} tire force and moment vectors relative to the wheels, as well as the combined-force limit one might obtain from the road tires. Camber-induced changes in the tire force and moment systems have knock-on consequences for the vehicle’s stability. The study makes use of computer simulations that exploit a high-fidelity motorcycle model whose parameter set is based on a Suzuki GSX-R 1000 sports machine. In order to study camber-induced stability trends for a range of machine speeds and roll angles, we study the machine dynamics as the vehicle travels over the surface of a right circular cone. Conical road surfaces allow the machine to operate at a constant steady-state speed, a constant roll angle, and a constant road camber angle. The local road-tire contact behavior is analyzed by approximating the cone surface by moving tangent planes located under the road wheels. There is novelty {{in the way in which}} adaptive controllers are used to center the vehicle’s trajectory on a cone, which has its apex at the origin of the inertial reference frame. The results show that at low speed both the weave- and wobble-mode stabilities are at a maximum when the machine is perpendicular to the road surface. This trend is reversed at high speed, since the weave- and wobble-mode dampings are minimized by running conditions in which the wheels are orthogonal to the road. As a result, <b>positive</b> <b>camber,</b> which is often introduced by road builders to aid drainage and enhance the friction limit of four-wheeled vehicle tires, might be detrimental to the stability of two-wheeled machines...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{interest}} in developing micro air vehicles (MAVs) {{for a variety of}} both civil and military uses has driven significant research into the aerodynamics of natural flyers, such as insects, birds and bats. Insects, in particular, exhibit desirable flight characteristics that MAV designers wish to incorporate into their designs, however our understanding of how these animals fly is still limited. Research into insect flight has shown that they employ a number of unsteady mechanisms, the most prevalent of these being the formation of a leading-edge vortex (LEV) which provides the wing with enhanced lift. While this research has greatly improved our understanding of insect flight, the effect of the wing's shape on these unsteady mechanisms is not well understood. This thesis describes an investigation into the effect of two wing morphological parameters, aspect ratio and camber, on the flow structures around flapping and rotating wings in an insect-like flight regime. The effect of wing aspect ratio is first explored at different Reynolds numbers using a numerical model of an altered fruit fly wing revolving at a constant angular velocity. Increasing the Reynolds number for an aspect ratio of 2. 91 resulted {{in the development of a}} dual LEV structure, however increasing aspect ratio at a fixed Reynolds number generated the same flow structures. This result shows that the effects of Reynolds number and aspect ratio are linked. An alternate flow scaling method, using the wing span as the characteristic length, is presented to decouple the effects of Reynolds number from those of aspect ratio. This resulted in a span-based Reynolds number, which can be used to independently describe the development of the LEV. Indeed, universal behaviour was found for various parameters using this scaling. The effect of aspect ratio on the vortex structures was then assessed at different span-based Reynolds numbers and it was found the wing aspect ratio had the effect of shortening the wing's chord length relative to a fixed LEV size. Scaling the flow using the wing span was found to apply for revolving wings at large angles of attack, such that the flow separates from the leading-edge and a strong spanwise velocity is generated on the leeward side of the wing. These conditions are typical of those seen in nature, and hence this scaling could be applied to similar investigations involving insects and birds as well as nature-mimicking MAVs. The effect of wing aspect ratio was then explored at different advance ratios using a numerical model that mimicked a flapping insect wing. It was demonstrated that increasing the advance ratio enhances vorticity production at the leading-edge during the downstroke, and this results in more rapid growth of the LEV for non-zero advance ratios. This effect, combined with that of aspect ratio, determines whether the LEV remains stably attached to the wing or if it is shed. For high advance ratios and large aspect ratios the LEV was observed to quickly grow to envelop the entire wing during the early stages of the downstroke. Continued rotation of the wing resulted in the LEV being eventually shed as part of a vortex loop that peels away from the wing's tip. It is shown that the shedding of the LEV for high aspect ratio wings at non-zero advance ratios leads to reduced aerodynamic performance of these wings. This helps to explain why a number of insect species have evolved to have low aspect ratio wings, as they outperform high aspect ratios across a wide range of flight speeds. Finally, wing deformation is observed during the flight of some insect species, which results in the wing becoming cambered throughout each half stroke. In this study, the effect of wing camber on the flow structures and aerodynamic forces for insect-like wings is investigated using the rotating-wing numerical model. Both positive and negative camber was investigated at Reynolds numbers of 120 and 1500, along with the chordwise location of maximum camber. It was found that negatively cambered wings produce similar LEV structures to non-cambered wings at both Reynolds numbers, but high <b>positive</b> <b>camber</b> resulted in the formation of multiple streamwise vortices at the higher Reynolds number, which disrupt the development of the main LEV. Despite this, positively cambered wings were found to produce higher lift on drag ratios than flat or negatively cambered wings. It was determined that a region of low pressure near the wing's leading edge, combined with the curvature of the wing's upper surface in this region, resulted in a vertical tilting of the net force vector for positively cambered wings, which explains how insects can benefit from wing camber...|$|E
