40|$|The general {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to determine the effectiveness of ampalaya leaf extract against gastrointestinal parasites of native chicken. Specifically, it aimed to:(1) to evaluate the anthelmintic property of ampalaya leaf extract in the treatment of gastro-intestinal parasites of native chicken;(2) find out the most effective variety of ampalaya leaves as purgatives for native chicken; and(3) to compare the efficacy of ampalaya leaf extract with commercial purgative in the treatment of gastro-intestinal parasites. A total of fifteen (15) experimental native chickens were used in each study which was distributed into five (5) treatments. For study 1 and 2, Commercial purgative (Piperazine dihydrocloride) and commercial purgative (mebendasole, niclosamide and levamisole) were used respectively as positive control. Based on the result of the study, ampalaya leaf extract shows comparable effect to positive control (<b>Piperazine</b> <b>dihydrochloride)</b> in treating and controlling gastro-intestinal parasites of native chicken. However, commercial purgative with triple ingredient (mebendasole, niclosamide and levamisole) shows more effective than the ampalaya extract. The researcher concludes that efficacy of ampalaya leaf extract as purgative is comparable to the effect of commercial purgative with single active ingreadient (<b>Piperazine</b> <b>dihydrochloride),</b> commercial purgative with triple active ingredients (mebendasole, niclosamide and levamisole) excelled over the ampalaya extract because of its multi-ingredients...|$|E

40|$|It is {{established}} that the serotonin systemmodulates hippocampal functions by regulating neuronal activity of both the medial sep-tum and hippocampus. Inhibition of serotonin neurons leads to theta oscillation of septal neurons and theta wave activity in the hippocampus, indicating a tonic regulation of the septo-hip-pocampal system by serotonin neurons. Because the postsynap-tic 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) receptor subtypes mediating this tonic inhibition have not been identified, a putative role of 5 -HT 2 C receptors has been evaluated in the present study. Extracellular single units were recorded from the medial septum/vertical limb of diagonal band (MS/DBv) and hippocampal CA 1 or dentate gyrus with simultaneous hippocampal EEG recordings from anesthe-tized rats.

40|$|Stroke {{leads to}} brain damage with {{subsequent}} slow and incomplete recovery of lost brain functions. Enriched housing of stroke-injured rats provides multi-modal sensorimotor stimulation, which improves recovery, although the specific mechanisms involved {{have not been}} identified. In rats housed in an enriched environment for two weeks after permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion, we found increased sigma- 1 receptor expression in peri-infarct areas. Treatment of rats subjected to permanent or transient middle cerebral artery occlusion with 1 -(3, 4 -dimethoxyphenethyl) - 4 -(3 -phenylpropyl) <b>piperazine</b> <b>dihydrochloride,</b> an agonist of the sigma- 1 receptor, starting two days after injury, enhanced the recovery of lost sensorimotor function without decreasing infarct size. The sigma- 1 receptor {{was found in the}} galactocerebroside enriched membrane microdomains of reactive astrocytes and in neurons. Sigma- 1 receptor activation increased the levels of the synaptic protein neurabin and neurexin in membrane rafts in the peri-infarct area, while sigma- 1 receptor silencing prevented sigma- 1 receptor-mediated neurite outgrowth in primary cortical neuronal cultures. In astrocytic cultures, oxygen and glucose deprivation induced sigma- 1 receptor expression and actin dependent membrane raft formation, the latter blocked by sigma- 1 receptor small interfering RNA silencing and pharmacological inhibition. We conclude that sigma- 1 receptor activation stimulates recovery after stroke by enhancing cellular transport of biomolecules required for brain repair, thereby stimulating brain plasticity. Pharmacological targeting of the sigma- 1 receptor provides new opportunities for stroke treatment beyond the therapeutic window of neuroprotection...|$|E

The present {{study was conducted to}} investigate if Sig- 1 R activation after experimental stroke affects mediators of the inflammatory response in the ischemic hemisphere. Male Wistar rats were subjected to transient occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCAO) and injected with the specific Sig- 1 R agonist 1 -(3, 4 -dimethoxyphenethyl) - 4 -(3 -phenylpropyl) <b>piperazine</b> <b>dihydrochloride</b> (SA 4503) or saline for 5 days starting on day 2 after MCAO. Treatment did not affect the increased levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin 1 beta (IL- 1 b), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a), interferon gamma (IFN-c), interleukin 4 (IL- 4), interleukin 5 (IL- 5), and interleukin 13 (IL- 13) in the infarct core and peri-infarct area after MCAO. In addition, treatment with SA 4503 did not affect elevated levels of nitrite, TNF-a and IL- 1 b observed in primary cultures of microglia exposed to combined Hypoxia/Aglycemia, while the unspecific sigma receptor ligand 1, 3 -di-o-tolylguanidine (DTG) significantly decreased the production of nitrite and levels of TNF-a. Analysis of the ischemic hemisphere also revealed increased levels of ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba 1) levels in the infarct core of SA 4503 treated animals. However, no difference in Iba 1 immunoreactivity was detected in the infarct core. Also, levels of the proliferation marker proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and OX- 42 were not increased in the infarct core in rats treated with SA 4503.

40|$|Human GABAA receptors {{containing}} different α and β subunits with {{or without}} the γ 2 S or γ 2 L subunits were expressed in Xenopus oocytes and the effects of the insecticides γ- and δ-hexachlorocyclohexane (γ-HCH and δ-HCH, respectively) on these receptor subunit combinations were examined using two electrode voltage-clamp procedures. γ-HCH produced incomplete inhibition of GABA responses on all receptor combinations examined with affinities in the range of 1. 1 [*]–[*] 1. 9 [*]μM. Affinity was not dependent on subunit composition but the maximum percentage of inhibition was significantly reduced in β 1 -containing receptors. δ-HCH both potentiated GABAA receptors and activated them in the absence of GABA at concentrations higher than those producing potentiation. Allosteric enhancement of GABAA receptor function by δ-HCH was not affected by the subunit composition of the receptor, By contrast the GABA mimetic actions of δ-HCH were abolished in receptors containing either α 4, β 1 or γ 2 L subunits. Sensitivity to the direct actions were not restored in receptors containing the mutant β 1 (S 290 N) subunit, but α 1 β 2 γ 2 L receptors became sensitive to the direct actions of δ-HCH when oocytes were treated for 24 [*]h with the protein kinase inhibitor isoquinolinesulphonyl- 2 -methyl <b>piperazine</b> <b>dihydrochloride</b> (H- 7). We have shown the influence of various α, β and γ subunits on the inhibitory, GABA mimetic and allosteric effects of HCH isomers.

40|$|Involucrin {{is one of}} the {{precursor}} proteins of keratinocyte cornified envelope. Although the formation of the cornified envelope is induced by tumor-promoting phorbol esters, the effect of 12 -O-tetradecanoylphorbol- 13 -acetate (TPA) on the involucrin gene expression remains unknown. We have isolated a 5 '-upstream region of human involucrin gene and examined its TPA-dependent promoter activity. The involucrin upstream region with the untranslated first exon was connected to chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) -involucrin promoter expression vector (INV-CAT) and was transfected into fetal rat keratinizing epidermal (FRSK) cells. The INV-CAT-transfected FRSK cells showed considerable CAT activity that was significantly augmented by the treatment of cells with TPA. FRSK cells that were transfected with a reversely oriented 5 '-upstream sequence revealed little CAT activity and did not respond to TPA. The effect of TPA was significantly inhibited by the protein kinase C inhibitor 1 -(5 -isoquinoline-sulfonyl) – 2 -methyl <b>piperazine</b> <b>dihydrochloride</b> (H- 7). Other protein kinase C activators (1 -oleoyl- 2 -acetylglycerol and mezerein) also induced the INV-CAT promoter activity, whereas 4 -O-methyl phorbol myristate acetate, a very weak protein kinase C activator, had only a slight effect. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence of the 5 '-upstream region detected several 5 '-TGANTACA- 3 ' sequences that are highly conserved TPA-response elements (TRE). Cotransfection of both c-jun and c-fos expression vectors with the INV-CAT vector into FRSK cells resulted in increased CAT activity. Cotransfection of either the c-jun or c-fos vector singly with the INV-CAT vector into FRSK cells had negligible effects. Dexamethasone significantly inhibited the TPA-induced promoter activity in the INV-CAT-transfected FRSK cells. These results indicate that involucrin gene expression is positively controlled by TPA through the activation of the protein kinase C/TRE system...|$|E
40|$|Rationale Serotonin in the dorsal periaqueductal gray (DPAG) {{through the}} {{activation}} of 5 -HT(1 A) and 5 -HT(2 A) receptors inhibits escape, a defensive behavior associated with panic attacks. Long-term treatment with antipanic drugs that nonselectively or selectively blocks the reuptake of serotonin (e. g., imipramine and fluoxetine, respectively) enhances the inhibitory effect on escape caused by intra-DPAG injection of 5 -HT(1 A) and 5 -HT(2 A) receptor agonists. It {{has been proposed}} that these compounds exert their effect on panic by facilitating 5 -HT-mediated neurotransmission in the DPAG. Objectives The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate whether facilitation of 5 -HT neurotransmission in the DPAG is also observed after treatment with alprazolam, a pharmacologically distinct antipanic drug that acts primarily as a high potency benzodiazepine receptor agonist. Materials and methods Male Wistar rats, subchronically (3 - 6 days) or chronically (14 - 17 days) treated with alprazolam (2 and 4 mg/kg, i. p.) were intra-DPAG injected with (+/-) - 8 -hydroxy- 2 -(di-n-propylamino) tetralin hydrobromide (8 -OH-DPAT), (+/-) - 1 -(2, 5 -dimethoxy- 4 -iodophenyl) <b>piperazine</b> <b>dihydrochloride</b> (DOI), and midazolam, respectively, 5 -HT(1 A), 5 -HT(2 A/ 2 C), and benzodiazepine receptor agonists. The intensity of electrical current that needed to be applied to the DPAG to evoke escape behavior was measured before and after the microinjection of these agonists. Results Intra-DPAG injection of the 5 -HT agonists and midazolam increased the escape threshold in all groups of animals tested, indicating a panicolytic-like effect. The inhibitory effect of 8 -OH-DPAT and DOI, but not midazolam, was significantly higher in animals receiving long-, but not short-term treatment with alprazolam. Conclusions Alprazolam as antidepressants compounds facilitates 5 -HT(1 A) - and 5 -HT(2 A) -receptor-mediated neurotransmission in the DPAG, implicating this effect in the mode of action of different classes of antipanic drugs...|$|E
40|$|In the hippocampus, axon {{collaterals}} of CA 1 pyramidal cells project locally onto neighbouring CA 1 pyramidal cells and interneurones, forming a local excitatory network which, in disinhibited conditions, feeds polysynaptic epscs (poly-epscs). 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) {{has been shown}} to inhibit poly-epscs through activation of a presynaptic receptor. The aim of the present work was the pharmacological characterization of the 5 -HT receptor involved in this 5 -HT action. Poly-epscs, evoked by electrical stimulation of the stratum radiatum and recorded in whole-cell voltage-clamp from CA 1 pyramidal neurones, were studied in mini-slices of the CA 1 region under pharmacological block of GABAA, GABAB, and 5 -HT 1 A receptors. The 5 -HT 1 B receptor selective agonist 1, 4 -dihydro- 3 -(1, 2, 3, 6 -tetrahydro- 4 -pyridinyl) - 5 H-pyrrolo[3, 2 -b]pyridin- 5 -one dihydrochloride (CP 93129) inhibited poly-epscs (EC 50 = 55 nM), an effect mimicked by the 5 -HT 1 B ligands 5 -carboxamidotryptamine (5 -CT; EC 50 = 14 nM) and methylergometrine (EC 50 = 78 nM), but not by 1 -(3 -chlorophenyl) <b>piperazine</b> <b>dihydrochloride</b> (mCPP; 10 μM) or 7 -trifluoromethyl- 4 (4 -methyl- 1 -piperazinyl) -pyrrolo[1, 2 -a]quinoxaline dimaleate (CGS 12066 B; 10 μM). The effects of CP 93129 and 5 -CT were blocked by the selective 5 -HT 1 B receptor antagonist 3 -[3 -(dimethylamino) propyl]- 4 -hydroxy-N-[4 -(4 -pyridinyl) phenyl]benzamide dihydrochloride (GR 55562; KB≈ 100 nM) and by cyanopindolol (KB= 6 nM); methiothepin (10 μM) and dihydroergotamine (1 μM). For both GR 55562 and methiothepin, application times of at least two hours were required in order to achieve their full antagonistic effects.

40|$|The {{presence}} of a phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2) activity in rabbit neutrophil membrane preparation that is able to release [1 - 14 C]oleic acid from labelled Escherichia coli has been demonstrated. The activity is critically dependent on the free calcium concentration and marginally stimulated by GTP gamma S. More than 80 % of maximal activity is reached at 10 microM-Ca 2 +. The chemotactic factor, fMet-Leu-Phe, does not stimulate the PLA 2 activity in this membrane preparation. Pretreatment of the membrane preparation, under various experimental conditions, or intact cells, before isolation of the membrane with phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate (PMA), does not affect PLA 2 activity. Addition of the catalytic unit of cyclic AMP-dependent kinase to membrane preparation {{has no effect on}} PLA 2 activity. Pretreatment of the intact neutrophil with dibutyryl-cAMP before isolation of the membrane produces a small but consistent increase in PLA 2 activity. The activity of PLA 2 in membrane isolated from cells treated with the protein kinase inhibitor 1 -(5 -isoquinolinesulphonyl) - 2 -methyl <b>piperazine</b> <b>dihydrochloride</b> (H- 7) is significantly decreased. Furthermore, although the addition of PMA to intact rabbit neutrophils has no effect on the release of [3 H]arachidonic acid from prelabelled cells, it potentiates significantly the release produced by the calcium ionophore A 23187. This potentiation is not due to an inhibition of the acyltransferase activity. H- 7 inhibits the basal release of arachidonic acid but does not inhibit the potentiation by PMA. These results suggest several points. (1) fMet-Leu-Phe does not stimulate PLA 2 directly, and its ability to release arachidonic acid in intact neutrophils is mediated through its action on phospholipase C. (2) The potentiating effect of PMA on A 23187 -induced arachidonic acid release is most likely due to PMA affecting either the environment of PLA 2 and/or altering the organization of membrane phospholipids {{in such a way as}} to increase their susceptibility to hydrolysis. (3) The intracellular level of cyclic AMP probably does not directly affect the activity of PLA 2...|$|E
40|$|Involucrin {{is one of}} the {{precursor}} proteins of the cornified cell envelope that is formed beneath the cell membrane during terminal differentiation of keratinocytes. 12 -O-tetradecanoylphorbol- 13 -acetate (TPA), which is a potent protein kinase C (PKC) activator, induces terminal differentiation of keratinocytes. We previously demonstrated that involucrin promoter activity is stimulated by TPA in cultured fetal rat skin keratinocytes. PKC is a large family of proteins and keratinocytes containing five PKC isozymes: α, δδ, ε, ηη, and ζζ. In order to determine the role of the PKC isozyme(s) on involucrin gene expression, we constructed the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) -involucrin promoter expression vector by connecting the 5 ′-upstream region of the human involucrin gene containing the untranslated first exon to the CAT reporter gene. The CAT-involucrin promoter expression vector was transfected with various PKC isozyme expression vectors into SV 40 -transformed human keratinocytes (SVHK cells). Transfection of the CAT-involucrin promoter expression vector with PKC-α or PKC-ηη expression vectors resulted in {{a significant increase in the}} TPA-dependent involucrin promoter activity. The PKC inhibitor, 1 -(5 -isoquinoline-sulfonyl) - 2 -methyl <b>piperazine</b> <b>dihydrochloride,</b> inhibited the promoter activity stimulated by TPA. Transfection of PKC-δδ, -ε, and -ζζ had no effect on the involucrin-promoter activity. Although the promoter activity was stimulated by transfection of PKC-γγ, TPA did not enhance the promoter activity in the PKC-γγ-transfected SVHK cells. Previously we showed three AP- 1 binding sites (AP 1 – 1, – 2, and – 3) on the involucrin promoter region. Both the basal and the TPA-stimulated involucrin promoter activities were suppressed by deleting the AP 1 – 1 site (– 119 to – 113) that is the most proximal to the transcription start site. The deletion of AP 1 – 2 (– 297 to – 303) or AP 1 – 3 (– 447 to – 453) did not affect the involucrin promoter activity. Gel retardation analyses disclosed that TPA stimulated the specific DNA binding of the nuclear protein(s) of control, PKC-α, or PKC-ηη-transfected SVHK cells, but not of PKC-γγ-transfected cells. Addition of anti-c-Jun and anti-c-Fos antibodies decreased the specific protein-DNA complex band with a concomitant appearance of supershifted bands. These results indicate that PKC, specifically PKC-α and PKC-ηη, mediates the TPA-dependent activation of involucrin gene expression of SVHK cells. PKC-γγ, which is not present in keratinocytes, also induces involucrin gene expression in a TPA-independent manner, when introduced into SVHK cells. Key word: cornified cell envelope.
