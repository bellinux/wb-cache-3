40|$|This report {{recommends}} {{a set of}} complementary measures designed to strengthen the system of committees in the House of Representatives. Most of these recommendations suggest incremental change, which, in the past, {{has been the most}} effective means of bringing about practical improvements.   The current system of House and joint committees has been operating since 1987. Apart from some significant reforms in 1998, changes to its structure and operation since that time have been largely incremental. This may be because the committee system has continued, in large measure, to meet the House’s needs. Nevertheless, Members’ and the public’s changing expectations have meant that the pressure for reform has been building over recent years. For example, relatively recent developments in information and communication technology present opportunities for committees to change the way they do their work, including how they conduct inquiries and engage with the community. The range of demands on Members has also evolved, partly because of technological developments, and partly due to the public’s changing expectations of Members and the Parliament as a whole. This inquiry into the effectiveness of the House committee system is therefore timely. The Committee looked at ways to make the House committee system more workable and responsive {{to the needs of the}} community and of the Parliament. It considered the structure of the committee system, the <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> <b>committees,</b> and the types of work committees do. A range of structural factors were also considered, including ensuring that committees are properly resourced and appropriately integrated into the structures of the Parliament to carry out their vitally important work...|$|E

50|$|The Lieutenant Governor of Texas {{serves as}} the President of the Senate. Unlike most {{lieutenant}} governors who are constitutionally designated as presiding officers of the upper house, the Lieutenant Governor regularly exercises this function. The Lieutenant Governor's duties include appointing chairs <b>of</b> <b>committees,</b> committee members, assigning and referring bills to specific committees, recognizing members during debate, and making procedural rulings. The Lieutenant Governor may also cast a vote should a Senate floor vote end in a tie. If the Senate votes to dissolve itself into the <b>Committee</b> <b>of</b> the Whole, in which all members are part <b>of</b> the <b>Committee,</b> the President Pro-Tempore presides over the proceedings, with the Lieutenant Governor acting as a regular voting member. Due to the various <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> <b>committee</b> selection and bill assignment, the Lieutenant Governor {{is considered one of}} the most powerful lieutenant governorships in the United States.|$|R

The 9 / 11 Commission recommended that the Senate adopt rules requiring hearings and votes to confirm or reject national security nominees within 30 days of their submission at the start of each new presidential administration. Implementing the commission's proposal would involve imposing new restrictions on both the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>committee</b> chairs to control the agenda <b>of</b> their <b>committees</b> and the rights of Senators to delay or block nominations through holds and extended debate.

40|$|Abstract. Congleton (1984) {{shows that}} a rent awarded by a {{committee}} results in smaller aggregate rent-seeking expenditures than a similar rent awarded by a single administrator. This note modifies Congleton’s model by considering a model in which voting is probabilistic instead of deterministic. I show that the relative magnitudes of rent-seeking expenditures {{could go either way}} depending on the relative weighted sensitivities (to rent-seeking efforts) <b>of</b> the <b>committee</b> and the single administrator. I show how the distribution <b>of</b> voting <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> <b>committee</b> members affects rent-seeking efforts. I also examine the case where there is some probability that the rent may not be awarded, if the committee is unable to reach a majority decision. My results diverge from Congleton (1984) because of the absence of majoritarian cycles in my model. 1...|$|R

50|$|The Parliament {{can form}} {{parliamentary}} standing committees as it sees fit, {{for the purposes}} of examining bills, reviewing law enforcements and any other matter of public importance.

25|$|The Congress {{includes}} joint committees, {{which include}} members {{from both the}} Senate and the House of Representatives. Some joint committees oversee independent government bodies; for instance, the Joint Committee on the Library oversees the Library of Congress. Other joint committees serve to make advisory reports; for example, there exists a Joint Committee on Taxation. Bills and nominees are not referred to joint <b>committees.</b> Hence, the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> joint <b>committees</b> is considerably lower than those <b>of</b> standing <b>committees.</b>|$|R

For example, four of them--Samuel Randall (D-PA), Joseph Cannon (R-IL), Joseph Byrns (D-TN) and Nancy Pelosi (D-CA)--have gone on to become the Speaker of the House, and one, James Garfield, has gone on to become President.|$|R

50|$|One of {{the most}} {{influential}} Speakers in history was Democrat Sam Rayburn. Rayburn was the longest-serving Speaker in history, holding office from 1940 to 1947, 1949 to 1953, and 1955 to 1961. He helped shape many bills, working quietly in the background with House committees. He also helped ensure the passage of several domestic measures and foreign assistance programs advocated by Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry Truman. Rayburn's successor, Democrat John William McCormack (served 1962-1971), was a somewhat less influential speaker, particularly because of dissent from younger members of the Democratic Party. During the mid-1970s, the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> the speakership once again grew under Democrat Carl Albert. The Committee on Rules ceased to be a semi-independent panel, as it had been since 1910. Instead, it once again became an arm of the party leadership. Moreover, in 1975, the Speaker was granted the authority to appoint a majority of the members <b>of</b> the Rules <b>Committee.</b> Meanwhile, the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>committee</b> chairmen was curtailed, further increasing the relative influence of the Speaker.|$|R

40|$|The study {{investigated}} the interest {{of male and female}} legislators in social legislation as measured by the number of bills each group introduced. Legislators included in the study were the entire female population of the North Carolina General Assembly House of Representatives serving between January and July 1981, and an equal number of their male colleagues randomly selected. Comparisons of the female and male legislators in the study criteria such as number of legislative terms served, relative <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>committees</b> on which they served, number <b>of</b> <b>committee</b> chairpersonships and independent rankings and effectiveness by colleagues, lobbyists and the media revealed that the male legislators lead by significant margins on all criteria. Results of the study were that the women introduced more bills and more social legislation. Of the 159 bills introduced by the women, 64 percent were identified as social legislation, while of the 111 bills introduced by the men, only 37 percent were identified as social legislation. The designations of social legislation or non-social legislation were submitted to a jury of experts for validation. Recommendations were made for further study of the interests of male and female legislators in more specific content areas...|$|R
5000|$|The Appropriations {{committee}} is widely recognized by political scientists {{as one of}} the [...] "power committees," [...] since it holds the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> the purse. Openings on the Appropriations committee are often hotly demanded, and are doled out as rewards. It is one <b>of</b> the exclusive <b>committees</b> <b>of</b> the House, meaning its members typically sit on no other committee. Under House Rules, an exception to this is that five Members <b>of</b> the Appropriations <b>Committee</b> must serve on the House Budget Committee—three for the Majority and two for the Minority. Much <b>of</b> the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> the <b>committee</b> comes from the inherent utility of controlling spending.
