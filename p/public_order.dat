5|$|Since {{the court}} had no {{capacity}} to review {{the merits of the}} decision and conclude whether Jehovah's Witnesses were a threat to <b>public</b> <b>order,</b> it was sufficient that the Minister had made Order 179 with the view that the existence of Jehovah's Witnesses, which forbade national service, was contrary to public peace, welfare and good order. The judge also remarked that notion of public peace, welfare and good order in the SA was similar to the concept of <b>public</b> <b>order</b> envisaged by Article 15(4) of the Constitution. Thus the rationale of maintaining <b>public</b> <b>order</b> behind Order 179 fell within the permitted categories spelt out in both section 24(1)(a) of the SA and Article 15(4) respectively.|$|E

5|$|The appellants {{contended that}} under Article 15(4) of the Constitution {{restrictions}} {{on the right of}} freedom of religion could be imposed only if <b>public</b> <b>order,</b> public health or morality is affected, and section 24(1)(a) of the SA provides for registered organizations to be dissolved only if they threaten public peace, welfare or good order. The appellants therefore submitted that {{there had to be a}} clear and immediate danger to <b>public</b> <b>order</b> before freedom of religion can be circumscribed. Since the activities of Jehovah's Witnesses posed no such threat, the deregistration order was unconstitutional and ultra vires the SA.|$|E

The police officers wear full uniform, and are intended to be a highly visible presence. Their uniform is sometimes different from normal police officers in that the upper half of their yellow fluorescent jackets is blue. Civilian photographers are also employed by the police to work alongside FITs. According to Scotland Yard, the aim of FIT teams at protests is to record evidence of protesters in case disorder occurs later on at a protest.|$|E

5|$|In the 1930s Yeats {{was fascinated}} with the authoritarian, anti-democratic, {{nationalist}} movements of Europe, and he composed several marching songs for the far right Blueshirts, although they were never used.

On the other hand, he was also an elitist who abhorred the idea of mob-rule, and saw democracy as a threat to good governance and <b>public</b> <b>order.</b> After the Blueshirt movement began to falter in Ireland, he distanced himself somewhat from his previous views, but maintained a preference for authoritarian and nationalist leadership.|$|E

5|$|Singapore's {{political}} {{model has}} been described as a representative democracy, and Singaporeans have constitutional rights to freedom of speech and assembly under Articles 14(1)(a) and (b) of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore. The constitutional rights to free speech and assembly extend only to Singapore citizens. Hence, the Singapore Court of Appeal has held that non-citizens enjoy only common law free speech. Articles 14(1)(a) and (b) are then subject to Articles 14(2)(a) and (b) which allow Parliament to impose, by law, restrictions on the rights to freedom of speech and assembly. The grounds for restrictions are, for freedom of speech, Singapore's security, friendly relations with other states, <b>public</b> <b>order,</b> public morality, protecting parliamentary privilege, defamation, contempt of court and incitement to any criminal offence; and for freedom of assembly, <b>public</b> <b>order</b> only. These restrictions made it a lengthy and difficult process to obtain the licence required to address a public gathering.|$|E
5|$|The Miscellaneous Offences (<b>Public</b> <b>Order</b> and Nuisance) (Assemblies and Processions) Rules {{made under}} the Miscellaneous Offences (<b>Public</b> <b>Order</b> and Nuisance) Act require a permit for any public {{assembly}} or procession {{of five or}} more persons in any public place. The rationale given for this law is that {{a large group of}} people who gather for a peaceful purpose can turn violent. In the 1950s and 1960s there were several violent riots in Singapore, the last incident being the 1964 race riots in which 36 people were killed. Although there have only been a few minor protests since then, the authorities continue to take a tough stance against unlicensed outdoor protests. On 31 December 2000, 15 members of Falun Gong consisting of 13 foreigners and two Singaporeans were arrested at MacRitchie Park for holding an illegal assembly.|$|E

40|$|An {{influential}} {{literature in}} economics explores {{the phenomenon of}} “safe assets” – when participants across financial markets act “as if” certain debt is risk free – {{as well as its}} role in the global financial crisis and its implications for post-crisis reform. We highlight the role of private ordering in constructing safe assets. Private ordering, including contractual devices and transaction structures, contributes to the creation of these debt contracts, to their collective treatment in financial markets as low risk investments, and to the making of deep and liquid markets in them. These contracts and transaction structures also provide a template for understanding the role of government regulation in constructing safe assets. Safe asset supply and demand does not occur organically. Rather, whether through private or <b>public</b> <b>ordering,</b> three types of legal tools operate to construct safe assets: 1. Making Assets Safe: one set of tools contributes to the production of safe assets by regulating the cash flows into and out of an issuer of safe assets to increase the likelihood of full and prompt payment to investors. These tools might take the form of: engineering the asset side of an issuer’s balance sheet {{to reduce the risk of}} inputs in safe assets; engineering the liability side of an issuer’s balance sheet to give holders of safe assets priority over other claimants on the issuer; or creating and regulating the secondary market for safe assets. 2. Labeling Assets Safe: another set of legal tools focuses on the demand for safe assets by granting special status to these contracts when held on the books of investors. These tools create liquid markets for certain assets by either: signaling the low risk of default by issuers of those assets; or coordinating the collective treatment of those assets as having low risk and high liquidity. 3. Guaranteeing Asset Safety: financial intermediaries and governments can also guarantee the performance of safe assets, putting their own credit on the line. Guarantees may be ex ante or ex post, explicit or implicit. A comparison of private and <b>public</b> <b>ordering</b> in safe asset markets reveals how difficult it is to separate the two. Indeed, much of private ordering relies on statute and regulation. <b>Public</b> <b>ordering</b> succeeds at creating safe assets when it enables private ordering and herding by investors into safe asset markets. Understanding this complex interplay between public and private tools becomes vital for understanding how safe asset markets operate, how they fail, and how they must be reformed. The Article concludes with two lessons. First, it deconstructs the notion that there is purely private or <b>public</b> <b>ordering</b> in safe asset markets. Second, it underscores a kind of first law of thermodynamics for safe assets: neither private nor <b>public</b> <b>ordering</b> can banish risk altogether from safe asset markets or financial markets in general. They merely move risk around or, worse, obscure risk until it rematerializes...|$|R
