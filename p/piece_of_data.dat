5|$|The Federation fleet try {{to destroy}} the Kukai base as {{it appears to be}} the source of the Song, but Wilhelm—who has been {{secretly}} observing events—arrives with a private fleet that destroys the Gnosis and protects the base. KOS-MOS then uses an advanced weapon to detect the Song's source in a cloaked spaceship. Boarding the spaceship, the group rescue MOMO and fight Albedo, but are stopped by a blue-cloaked man who allows Albedo to escape with a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> extracted from MOMO that could grant access to Miltia. Albedo then summons Proto Merkebah, a research ship created by Mizrahi to summon U-DO, and destroys the Federation fleet before aiming Proto Merkebah's weapons at Second Miltia's capital. The blue-cloaked man—revealed to be a resurrected Virgil—observes events before being summoned away. Shion's group infiltrates Proto Markebah and destroys its core while Albedo flees. Escaping Proto Merkebah as it self-destructs, KOS-MOS shields the damaged Elsa as it enters Second Miltia's atmosphere.|$|E
25|$|Street Fighter IV {{takes place}} {{several months after}} the events of Street Fighter II (thus is {{chronologically}} set between Street Fighter II and III). After M.Bison's survival following his encounter with Akuma, the S.I.N. corporation began another fighting tournament in order to draw out the most powerful fighters on Earth to complete the BLECE project. Each character has their own reasons for entering this tournament, but S.I.N.'s real desire is to lure Ryu to {{them in order to}} analyze the Satsui no Hadō, believed to be the last <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> needed to complete BLECE.|$|E
25|$|By {{a similar}} token, Cocoa {{provides}} a pervasive data manipulation method called key-value coding (KVC). This allows a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> or property {{of an object}} to be looked up or changed at runtime by name. The property name acts {{as a key to}} the value. In traditional languages, this late binding is impossible. KVC leads to great design flexibility. An object's type need not be known, yet any property of that object can be discovered using KVC. Also, by extending this system using something Cocoa terms key-value observing (KVO), automatic support for undo-redo is provided.|$|E

At this step, the privacy specifications characterize the sensitive <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> that can uniquely identify a user or an entity. Privacy terms can likewise indicate which <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> {{can be stored}} and for how long. At this step, schema restrictions can take place as well.|$|R
50|$|Many <b>of</b> the <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> {{which the}} player needs are {{gathered}} through various mini-games. Successfully completing a mini-game often reveals {{one or more}} <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>data,</b> including the names and photos of those involved, as well as locations connected to the plot. The player is allowed to decide which skills his agent has mastered ahead of time, making the associated mini-games easier.|$|R
25|$|The {{following}} {{table is}} a list of AET secondary schools including current and former secondary schools, accurate to data available in November 2015. The table includes an indication of exam results, OFSTED grade and any letters from the Department for Education expressing concerns about standards. There is a footnote in each case, so that the individual accuracy of each <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> can be verified. In 2016 the reporting of school data changed in the DfE performance tables. 2011-2015 the percentage given was only the percentage of pupils gaining a C and above in English and Maths. From 2016 it is the percentage of pupils gaining C and above in only a Maths and English GCSE grade, therefore the figures are higher. Nationally the results have resulted in a 6.6% rise in data and this should be taken into account when comparing the two figures.|$|E
500|$|The DATA step has {{executable}} {{statements that}} result in the software taking an action, and declarative statements that provide instructions to read a data set or alter the data's appearance. The DATA step has two phases: compilation and execution. In the compilation phase, declarative statements are processed and syntax errors are identified. Afterwards, the execution phase processes each executable statement sequentially. Data sets are organized into tables with rows called [...] "observations" [...] and columns called [...] "variables". Additionally, each <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> has a descriptor and a value.|$|E
500|$|AMS {{counts the}} atoms of [...] and [...] {{in a given}} sample, {{determining}} the / ratio directly. The sample, often {{in the form of}} graphite, is made to emit C− ions (carbon atoms with a single negative charge), which are injected into an accelerator. The ions are accelerated and passed through a stripper, which removes several electrons so that the ions emerge with a positive charge. The C3+ ions are then passed through a magnet that curves their path; the heavier ions are curved less than the lighter ones, so the different isotopes emerge as separate streams of ions. A particle detector then records the number of ions detected in the [...] stream, but since the volume of [...] (and , needed for calibration) is too great for individual ion detection, counts are determined by measuring the electric current created in a Faraday cup. Some AMS facilities are also able to evaluate a sample's fractionation, another <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> necessary for calculating the sample's radiocarbon age.|$|E

500|$|At 02:25 MYT, the aircraft's {{satellite}} communication system sent a [...] "log-on request" [...] message—the first {{message on the}} system since the ACARS transmission at 01:07—which was relayed by satellite to a ground station, both operated by satellite telecommunications company Inmarsat. After logging on to the network, the satellite data unit aboard the aircraft responded to hourly status requests from Inmarsat and two ground-to-aircraft phone calls, at 02:39 and 07:13, which went unanswered by the cockpit. The final status request and aircraft acknowledgement occurred at 08:10, about 1 hour and 40 minutes after it was scheduled to arrive in Beijing. The aircraft sent a log-on request at 08:19:29, which was followed, after a response from the ground station, by a [...] "log-on acknowledgement" [...] message at 08:19:37. The log-on acknowledgement is the last <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> available from Flight 370. The aircraft {{did not respond to}} a status request from Inmarsat at 09:15.|$|E

An ordered list of parameters is usually included in the definition of a subroutine, so that, each time the subroutine is called, its arguments for that call can be assigned to the corresponding parameters.|$|R
