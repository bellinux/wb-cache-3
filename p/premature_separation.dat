Watermarks were originally used by governments for documents, currency and other applications to help prevent counterfeiting. The U.S. Post office began using a double-line watermark bearing the initials USPS in 1895, when the Bureau of Engraving and Printing introduced it into the previously unwatermarked Bureau Triangles stamp issues. The same double-line watermark paper used then was used on the various issues leading up to and used in the production of the 1908 and 1909 versions of the Washington-Franklin issues. In 1910 the watermark was changed to a single-line watermark and with initials which were smaller in size, partly because the double-line watermark tended to weaken the sheets at the perforations causing <b>premature</b> <b>separation</b> of stamps at the Post Office, and partly because postal officials suspected that the double-line watermark caused the stamp paper to shrink unevenly when the sheets dried after printing.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThere {{are several}} syndromes in which {{specific}} mitotic chromosomal abnormalities can be seen, like <b>premature</b> centromere <b>separation,</b> <b>premature</b> (sister) chromatid <b>separation,</b> and somatic aneuploidies.

40|$|Roberts syndrome/SC {{phocomelia}} is a rare, {{autosomal recessive}} syndrome characterised by pre- and postnatal growth retardation, microcephaly, craniofacial anomalies, mental retardation, and tetraphocomelia {{in varying degrees}} of severity. The clinical diagnosis can be challenging in phenotypically mild cases. In the extremely mild case presented here, specific mitotic abnormalities were detected and proved to be very helpful, since Roberts syndrome/SC phocomelia could be diagnosed after finding <b>premature</b> centromere <b>separation</b> and somatic aneuploidy at routine karyotyping. We discuss these and other mitotic cytogenetic abnormalities that can be of significant diagnostic importance, but which will be missed if only array studies are performed.

40|$|DNA {{replication}} is tightly regulated, but paradoxically {{there is}} reported to be an excess of MCM DNA replication proteins over the number of replication origins. Here, we show that MCM levels in primary human T cells are induced during the G(0) [...] >G(1) transition and are not in excess in proliferating cells. The level of induction is critical as we show that a 50 % reduction leads to increased centromere <b>separation,</b> <b>premature</b> chromatid <b>separation</b> (PCS) and gross chromosomal abnormalities typical of genomic instability syndromes. We investigated the mechanisms involved and show that a reduction in MCM levels causes dose-dependent DNA damage involving activation of ATR & ATM and Chk 1 & Chk 2. There is increased DNA mis-repair by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and both NHEJ and homologous recombination are necessary for Mcm 7 -depleted cells to progress to metaphase. Therefore, a simple reduction in MCM loading onto DNA, which occurs in cancers as a result of aberrant cell cycle control, is sufficient to cause PCS and gross genomic instability within one cell cycle...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{evidence that}} {{during the first year}} or so of a worker 2 ̆ 7 s tenure, wages rise more slowly than productivity net of training costs when training is predominantly general and that many employers are, in effect, induced to share {{the costs and benefits of}} general on-the-job training with their employees. This occurs for three reasons. First, sorting, high job search costs and the reputational damages that result from <b>premature</b> <b>separations</b> make a dismissed worker 2 ̆ 7 s next best alternative decidedly unattractive and this causes workers to prefer front loaded compensation packages which reduce the likelihood of involuntary terminations. Second, since most young workers are liquidity constrained and cannot afford to self-finance general training, employers take advantage of their better access to credit and take over the financing of a portion of the costs of general on-the-job training. Finally, the minimum wage and union contracts prevent young workers from agreeing to the low starting wages that would be necessary if they were to self-finance general on-the-job training. Analysis of data comparing the growth of compensation to the growth of productivity net of training costs in jobs reported to involve skills that were useful at other firms found {{that during the}} first two years of tenure that net productivity grows on average 4 to 5 times faster than compensation. While the effective specificity of training that is reported to be useful elsewhere accounts for a portion of this difference, it does not account for all of it. Consequently, one or more of the forces listed above is probably contributing to the front-loading of compensation during the first year or so on a job...|$|R

40|$|Abstract In budding yeast, we {{have found}} that sister rDNA arrays marked with {{fluorescent}} probes can be visualized as two distinguishable strands during metaphase. Upon ana-phase, these arm loci are drawn into the spindle, where they adopt a cruciform-like structure and stretch 2. 5 -fold as they migrate to the poles. Therefore, while sister rDNA arrays appear separated in metaphase, mechanical linkages between sister arm loci persist throughout anaphase in yeast, as shown in grasshopper spermatocytes (Paliulis and Nicklas 2004). These linkages are partially dependent on the protector of cohesin, SGO 1. In anaphase, the spatially regulated dissolution of these mechanical linkages serves to prevent <b>premature</b> sister <b>separation</b> and restrain the rate of spindle elongation. Thus, sister separation is temporally controlled and linkages between sister chromatids contribute to the regulation of anaphase spindle elongation...|$|R
