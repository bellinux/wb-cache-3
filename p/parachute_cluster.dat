40|$|The Landing Parachute Demonstrator (LPD) was {{conceived}} as a low-cost, rapidly-developed means of providing soft landing for the Max Launch Abort System (MLAS) crew module (CM). Its experimental main <b>parachute</b> <b>cluster</b> deployment technique and off-the-shelf hardware necessitated a full-scale drop test prior to the MLAS mission {{in order to reduce}} overall mission risk. This test was successfully conducted at Wallops Flight Facility on March 6, 2009, with all vehicle and parachute systems functioning as planned. The results of the drop test successfully qualified the LPD system for the MLAS flight test. This document captures the design, concept of operations and results of the drop test...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} two key {{improvements}} to the photogrammetric analysis capabilities of the Capsule Parachute Assembly System (CPAS) for the Orion vehicle. The Engineering Development Unit (EDU) system deploys Drogue and Pilot parachutes via mortar, where an important metric is the muzzle velocity. This can be estimated using a high speed camera pointed along the mortar trajectory. The distance to the camera is computed from the apparent size of features of known dimension. This method was validated with a ground test and compares favorably with simulations. The second major photogrammetric product is measuring the geometry of the Main <b>parachute</b> <b>cluster</b> during steady-state descent using onboard cameras. This is challenging as the current test vehicles are suspended by a single-point attachment unlike earlier stable platforms suspended under a confluence fitting. The mathematical modeling of fly-out angles and projected areas has undergone significant revision. As the test program continues, several lessons were learned about optimizing the camera usage, installation, and settings to obtain the highest quality imagery possible...|$|E
40|$|The aerodynamics, both {{static and}} dynamic, {{of a test}} vehicle are {{critical}} to determining {{the performance of the}} <b>parachute</b> <b>cluster</b> in a drop test and for conducting a successful test. The Capsule Parachute Assembly System (CPAS) project is conducting tests of NASA's Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV) parachutes at the Army Yuma Proving Ground utilizing the Parachute Test Vehicle (PTV). The PTV shape is based on the MPCV, but the height has been reduced in order to fit within the C- 17 aircraft for extraction. Therefore, the aerodynamics of the PTV are similar, but not the same as, the MPCV. A small series of wind tunnel tests and computational fluid dynamics cases were run to modify the MPCV aerodynamic database for the PTV, but aerodynamic reconstruction of the flights has proven an effective source for further improvements to the database. The acceleration and rotational rates measured during free flight, before parachute inflation but during deployment, were used to con rm vehicle static aerodynamics. A multibody simulation is utilized to reconstruct the parachute portions of the flight. Aerodynamic or parachute parameters are adjusted in the simulation until the prediction reasonably matches the flight trajectory. Knowledge of the static aerodynamics is critical in the CPAS project because the parachute riser load measurements are scaled based on forebody drag. PTV dynamic damping is critical because the vehicle has no reaction control system to maintain attitude - the vehicle dynamics must be understood and modeled correctly before flight. It will be shown here that aerodynamic reconstruction has successfully contributed to the CPAS project...|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{conventional}} hand grenades, {{a personal}} grenade launcher {{can easily be}} used to launch flares as a signaling or illumination device. Like 40 mm smoke grenades, in the US military they are all of 40×46mm caliber, serving more of a use in the individual rather than the crew-served capacity. They also come in two main types, <b>cluster</b> flares and <b>parachute</b> flares. <b>Cluster</b> flares are used primarily for signaling, while parachute flares are used primarily for illumination.|$|R
40|$|The Team for Advanced Flow Simulation and Modeling (T*AFSM) at Rice University {{has been}} {{developing}} fluid-structure interaction (FSI) modeling techniques using Stabilized Space-Time FSI (SSTFSI) core technology to model spacecraft parachutes and carry out informative dynamical analysis of parachute performance. Computer modeling of spacecraft parachutes, which are quite often used in clusters {{of two or three}} large parachutes, involves FSI between the parachute canopy and the air, geometric complexities created by the construction of the ringsail parachute with hundreds of gaps and slits, and the contact between the parachutes. The computational challenges related to the FSI have successfully been addressed, and one of the special techniques used to deal with the geometric complexities is the Homogenized Modeling of Geometric Porosity. The technique for modeling, {{in the context of an}} FSI problem, the contact between two structural surfaces is described and the results of FSI computations using this technique are presented. The results obtained from FSI computations of single <b>parachutes</b> and <b>parachute</b> <b>clusters,</b> the related dynamical analysis, and a special decomposition technique for parachute descent speed are presented. A special technique for extracting model parameters from a parachute FSI computation is also presented...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the implementation of}} a flight dynamical simulation for cargo airdrop and its application. The corresponding software called PARALAB was developed by the DLR Institute of Flight Systems as toolbox and blockset for the MATLAB/Simulink® environment for the purpose of evaluation and assessment of airdrop missions in future military transport aircraft (FMTA) applications. The tool {{is a result of the}} further development of the coupled airdrop simulation presented at the AIAA ADS conference in 2011. Compared to the preceding version, the new version has been extended to general multi-body systems and 3 -dimensional motion. This extension provides the possibility of a realistic simulation of previ-ously unmodeled elements and features in complex parachute systems. The PARALAB toolbox includes models of several essential elements like ramp, payload, slings & risers, suspension lines & parachutes, but also static line, pendulum, tow plate and others. At present, several types of standard airdrop systems using round <b>parachutes,</b> <b>clusters</b> and multi-stage systems, as well as single-row and double-row airdrop with multiple payloads, can be simulated stand-alone or in connection with the simulation of a military transport aircraft. The paper concludes showing some preliminary validation results from scaled wind tunnel tests...|$|R
40|$|The Ballistic Precision Aerial Delivery System (BPADS) is a High Altitude Low Opening (HALO) {{delivery}} system intended to deliver cargo {{in the weight}} range of 16, 000 to 30, 000 pounds {{at an altitude of}} up to 25, 000 feet MSL (mean sea level) using Air Force C- 130 or C- 17 cargo aircraft. This United States Army sponsored program is in the early developmental stage with proof of concept anticipated to be completed by early 2010. The system is intended to provide a low cost 30, 000 pound high altitude low opening (HALO) aerial delivery capability, primarily using standard fielded equipment and limited commercial off –the-shelf (COTS) components. The program will utilize standard airdrop extraction techniques for both the C- 130 and C- 17. Upon leaving the aircraft, the extraction parachutes transition into free fall drogue parachutes and are retained until a predetermined altitude, at which time they are released to deploy a cluster of G- 11 parachutes for a low velocity landing. Desirable features of this system include short time duration in the air, minimal unrestrained components during the descent, and the predominant use of already fielded aerial delivery components. For drop accuracy, the operational BPADS system will utilize the Joint Precision Aerial Delivery System Mission Planner (JPADS-MP) to acquire real-time wind data and to calculate a release point. Main parachute deployment occurs at a predetermined altitude via the Wireless Activation Device (WAD) detecting a preset time or altitude. Once the specific time or altitude is acheived, the WAD fires a zero second cutter releasing the drogue and deploying the main <b>parachute</b> <b>cluster.</b> Flight testing is underway at Yuma Proving Ground and BPADS is scheduled for demonstration at PATCAD 2009. This paper reports on progress of the overall program to date, milestones achieved through testing, and future goals for the program...|$|E
40|$|Spacecraft {{parachute}} recovery systems, {{especially those}} with a <b>parachute</b> <b>cluster,</b> require testing to identify and reduce failures. This is especially important when the spacecraft in question is human-rated. Due to the recent effort to make spaceflight affordable, the importance of determining a minimum requirement for testing has increased. The number of tests required to achieve a mature design, with a relatively constant failure rate, can be estimated from a review of previous complex spacecraft recovery systems. Examination of the Apollo parachute testing and the Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster recovery chute system operation will clarify at which point in those programs the system reached maturity. This examination will also clarify the risks inherent in not performing {{a sufficient number of}} tests prior to operation with humans on-board. When looking at complex parachute systems used in spaceflight landing systems, a pattern begins to emerge regarding the need for a minimum amount of testing required to wring out the failure modes and reduce the failure rate of the parachute system to an acceptable level for human spaceflight. Not only a sufficient number of system level testing, but also the ability to update the design as failure modes are found is required to drive the failure rate of the system down to an acceptable level. In addition, sufficient data and images are necessary to identify incipient failure modes or to identify failure causes when a system failure occurs. In order to demonstrate the need for sufficient system level testing prior to an acceptable failure rate, the Apollo Earth Landing System (ELS) test program and the Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Recovery System failure history will be examined, as well as some experiences in the Orion Capsule Parachute Assembly System will be noted...|$|E
40|$|Due to uneven {{load sharing}} and lagging {{inflation}} rates, {{the design of}} the Large Main <b>Parachute</b> (LMP) <b>cluster,</b> used to recover the Space Shuttle steel case Solid Rocket Boosters, had to be modified. The cause of the problem was excessive variation in effective porosity in the crown area of the LMP during first stage inflation. The design modification consisted of adding horizontal ribbons above the existing vent band to reduce the vent porosity and better control the position and attitude of the vent lines. Performance of modified LMP's since introduction indicates that the load sharing between the clustered chutes has been significantly improved...|$|R
40|$|The Capsule Parachute Assembly System (CPAS) has {{undergone}} {{the transition from}} modeling a skipped stage event using a simulation that treats a <b>cluster</b> of <b>parachutes</b> as a single composite canopy to the capability of simulating each parachute individually. This capability along with data obtained from skipped stage flight tests has been crucial in modeling {{the behavior of a}} skipping canopy as well as the crowding effect on non-skipping ("lagging") neighbors. For the finite mass inflation of CPAS Main <b>parachutes,</b> the <b>cluster</b> is assumed to inflate nominally through the nominal fill time, at which point the skipping parachute continues inflating. This sub-phase modeling method was used to reconstruct three flight tests involving skipped stages. Best fit inflation parameters were determined for both the skipping and lagging canopies...|$|R

Flight characteristics of single and <b>clustered</b> ringsail <b>parachutes</b> are explained. Ringsail modeling techniques are employed to examine and discern the parachute's aerodynamic characteristics. Several design modifications, including suspension line length ratio, over-inflation control line and canopy loading are investigated. The application of the ringsail modeling techniques to two and three <b>parachutes</b> in a <b>cluster</b> is demonstrated...|$|R
50|$|After the {{re-entry}} {{the vehicle}} performed a descent and splashdown during which an end-to-end {{validation of the}} parachute system was performed, including the demonstration of the apex cover separation and the <b>parachute</b> deployment in <b>cluster</b> configuration. The deployment sequence started when CARE had slowed down to a speed of 233 m/s. The crew module carried three stages of parachutes, all of which came in pairs. First, both 2.3-meter diameter pilot parachutes came out, followed by the 6.2-meter drogue parachutes, which cut the capsule’s velocity down to 50 m/s. Then both main parachutes were deployed at a height of about 5 km. These parachutes, each 31 meters in diameter, were the largest ever made in India.|$|R
40|$|The Crew Exploration Vehicle Parachute Assembly System (CPAS) {{is being}} {{designed}} {{to land the}} Orion Crew Module (CM) at a safe rate of descent at splashdown. Flight test performance must be measured to {{a high degree of}} accuracy to ensure this requirement is met with the most efficient design possible. Although the design includes three CPAS Main parachutes, the requirement is that the system must not exceed 33 ft/s under two Main parachutes, should one of the Main parachutes fail. Therefore, several tests were conducted with clusters of two Mains. All of the steady-state rate of descent data are normalized to standard sea level conditions and checked against the limit. As the Orion design gains weight, the system is approaching this limit to within measurement precision. <b>Parachute</b> "breathing," <b>cluster</b> interactions, and atmospheric anomalies can cause the rate of descent to vary widely and lead to challenges in characterizing parachute terminal performance. An early test had contradictory rate of descent results from optical trajectory and Differential Global Positioning Systems (DGPS). A thorough analysis of the data sources and error propagation was conducted to determine the uncertainty in the trajectory. It was discovered that the Time Space Position Information (TSPI) from the optical tracking provided accurate position data. However, the velocity from TPSI must be computed via numerical differentiation, which is prone to large error. DGPS obtains position through pseudo-range calculations from multiple satellites and velocity through Doppler shift of the carrier frequency. Because the velocity from DGPS is a direct measurement, it is more accurate than TSPI velocity. To remedy the situation, a commercial off-the-shelf product that combines GPS and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) was purchased to significantly improve rate of descent measurements. This had the added benefit of solving GPS dropouts during aircraft extraction. Statistical probability distributions for CPAS Main parachute rate of descent and drag coefficient were computed and plotted. Using test data, a terminal rate of descent at splashdown can be estimated as a function of canopy loading...|$|R
40|$|The Crew Exploration Vehicle Parachute Assembly System (CPAS) {{is being}} {{designed}} {{to land the}} Orion Crew Module (CM) at a safe rate of descent at splashdown with a cluster of two to three Main parachutes. The instantaneous rate of descent varies based on parachute fly-out angles and geometric inlet area. <b>Parachutes</b> in a <b>cluster</b> oscillate between significant fly-out angles and colliding into each other. The former presents a sub-optimal inlet area and the latter lowers the effective drag area as the parachutes interfere with each other. The fly-out angles are also important in meeting a twist torque requirement. Understanding cluster behavior necessitates measuring the Mains with photogrammetric analysis. Imagery from upward looking cameras is analyzed to determine parachute geometry. Fly-out angles are measured from each parachute vent to an axis determined from geometry. Determining {{the scale of the}} objects requires knowledge of camera and lens calibration as well as features of known size. Several points along the skirt are tracked to compute an effective circumference, diameter, and inlet area as a function of time. The effects of this geometry are clearly seen in the system drag coefficient time history. Photogrammetric analysis is key in evaluating the effects of design features such as an Over-Inflation Control Line (OICL), Main Line Length Ratio (MLLR), and geometric porosity, which are varied in an attempt to minimize cluster oscillations. The effects of these designs are evaluated through statistical analysis...|$|R
40|$|To {{increase}} aerodynamic performance, {{the geometric}} porosity of a ringsail spacecraft parachute canopy is sometimes increased, beyond the "rings" and "sails" {{with hundreds of}} "ring gaps" and "sail slits. " This creates extra computational challenges for fluid [...] structure interaction (FSI) modeling of <b>clusters</b> of such <b>parachutes,</b> beyond those created by the lightness of the canopy structure, geometric complexities of hundreds of gaps and slits, and the contact between the <b>parachutes</b> of the <b>cluster.</b> In FSI computation of parachutes with such "modified geometric porosity," the flow through the "windows" created by {{the removal of the}} panels and the wider gaps created by the removal of the sails cannot be accurately modeled with the Homogenized Modeling of Geometric Porosity (HMGP), which was introduced to deal with the hundreds of gaps and slits. The flow needs to be actually resolved. All these computational challenges need to be addressed simultaneously in FSI modeling of <b>clusters</b> of spacecraft <b>parachutes</b> with modified geometric porosity. The core numerical technology is the Stabilized Space [...] Time FSI (SSTFSI) technique, and the contact between the parachutes is handled with the Surface-Edge-Node Contact Tracking (SENCT) technique. In the computations reported here, in addition to the SSTFSI and SENCT techniques and HMGP, we use the special techniques we have developed for removing the numerical spinning component of the parachute motion and for restoring the mesh integrity without a remesh. We present results for 2 - and 3 -parachute clusters with two different payload models. We also present the FSI computations we carried out for a single, subscale modified-porosity parachute...|$|R
