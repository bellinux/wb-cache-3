40|$|Our {{purpose was}} to compare {{the effect of a}} periodized <b>preparation</b> <b>consisting</b> <b>of</b> power {{endurance}} training and high-intensity power training on the contractile properties of the quadriceps muscle and functional performances in well trained male sprinters (n = 7). After 4 weeks of high-intensity power training, 60 -m sprint running time improved by an average of 1. 83 % (SD = 0. 96; p <. 05). This improvement was inversely related to an increase in maximal voluntary contraction torque (r = -. 89, p <. 05) and poorly correlated with changes in the contractile kinetics of the quadriceps muscle (r range from. 36 to -. 46). These findings suggest that sprint performance is poorly predicted by muscle intrinsic properties and that a neural adaptation appears to explain most of the observed functional adaptations.

The potential of the proposed method is shown with its application to some industrial powders.

However, the underlying mechanisms have not yet been elucidated. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the influence of OCT on blood levels of an oxidative stress maker in pre-menopausal women. Methods: Oxidative stress was determined in 87 pre-menopausal healthy women (24 with and 63 without OCT) using a blood assay for reactive oxygen metabolites (by the d-ROMs test). The subjects with OCT received a triphasic <b>preparation</b> <b>consisting</b> <b>of</b> ethinyl estradiol and norethisterone.

The results remained the same after adjusting for potential confounders.

A fibre optic motion sensor has been developed for monitoring the proximity and direction of motion of a ferrous bead travelling axial to the sensor. By integrating an array of these sensors into our previously developed fibre optic manometry catheters we demonstrate simultaneous detection of peristaltic muscular activity and the associated motion of ferrous beads through a colonic lumen. This allows the motion of solid content to be temporally and spatially related to pressure variations generated by peristaltic contractions without resorting to videoflouroscopy to track the motion of a radio opaque bolus.

From a comparison of the magnitude of the effect of ions on both the DNA- and RNA-directed systems, we conclude that potassium ions may also have a marked stimulatory effect on transcription of the deoxynucleotide kinase gene of T 4 DNA.

40|$|A <b>preparation</b> <b>consisting</b> <b>of</b> {{isolated}} dimeric peripheral antenna complexes {{from green}} plant photosystem I (light-harvesting complex I or LHCI) {{has been characterized}} by means of (polarized) steady-state absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy at low temperatures. We show that this preparation can be described reasonably well by a mixture of two types of dimers. In the first dimer about 10 % of all Q(y) absorption of the chlorophylls arises from two chlorophylls with absorption and emission maxima at about 711 and 733 nm, respectively, whereas in the second about 10 % of the absorption arises from two chlorophylls with absorption and emission maxima at about 693 and 702 nm, respectively. The remaining chlorophylls show spectroscopic properties {{comparable to those of}} the related peripheral antenna complexes of photosystem II. We attribute the first dimer to a heterodimer of the Lhca 1 and Lhca 4 proteins and the second to a hetero- or homodimer of the Lhca 2 and/or Lhca 3 proteins. We suggest that the chlorophylls responsible for the 733 nm emission (F- 730) and 702 nm emission (F- 702) are excitonically coupled dimers and that F- 730 originates from one of the strongest coupled pair of chlorophylls observed in nature...|$|E

CVs were dislodged from a cell surface complex preparation by gentle homogenization in an isotonic dissociation buffer, and purified by differential centrifugation. CV-free plasma membrane fragments {{were obtained by}} mechanically dislodging CVs from cortical lawn (CL) preparations with a jet of CL isolation buffer. This procedure produced a "plasma membrane lawn " <b>preparation,</b> <b>consisting</b> <b>of</b> plasma membrane fragments attached via their vitelline layer (an extracellular glycocalyx) to a polylysine-coated microscope slide. When freshly prepared CVs were incubated with plasma membrane lawns, CVs reassociated with the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane, forming an exocytotically competent, reconstituted cortical lawn (RL). Exocytosis in RLs was monitored by phase-contrast microscopy, and quantitated with a sensitive microphotometric assay. Half-maximal exocytosis in RLs occurred at 18. 5 #M free Ca 2 +; half-maximal exocytosis in control lawns occurred at 5. 7 tzM free Ca 2 +. Greater than 90 % of the purified CVs that were not attached to a plasma membrane lawn remained intact when bathed in a buffer containing millimolar Ca 2 +.
