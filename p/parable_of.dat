This article {{reflects}} on a possible methodology {{that can be}} used to interpret the <b>parables</b> <b>of</b> Jesus preserved in the Synoptics (and the Gospel of Thomas). It is argued that the available versions <b>of</b> the <b>parables</b> <b>of</b> Jesus have already been allegorised, and that this should be taken into consideration when the extant versions <b>of</b> <b>parables</b> are interpreted as <b>parables</b> <b>of</b> the historical Jesus. The parables should also, as far as possible, be interpreted against the social realia evoked by the parables. In this endeavour, Roman-Egypt inscriptions and papyri are in most cases the only sources available.

25|$|In the New Testament, Jesus {{speaks of}} the {{importance}} of Christians forgiving or showing mercy towards others. Jesus used the <b>parable</b> <b>of</b> the unmerciful servant (Matthew 18:21-35) to say that we should forgive without limits. <b>Parable</b> <b>of</b> the Prodigal Son is perhaps the best known parable about forgiveness and refers to God's forgiveness for his people.|$|E
