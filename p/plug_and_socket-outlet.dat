[...] A household plug and socket is defined in SANS164-1, and is essentially a modernised version of the BS546 15A (the essential differences are that pins can be hollowed {{to reduce the amount}} of metal used, the dimensions are metricated, and it is rated 16A). [...] SANS164-3 defines a 6A plug and socket based on the BS546 5A. [...] The South African Wiring Code now defines the plug and socket system defined in SANS164-2 (IEC 60906-1) as the preferred standard, and it is expected that SANS164-1 and SANS164-3 devices will be phased out by around 2035.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>plug</b> <b>and</b> <b>socket-outlet</b> system {{defined in}} BS1363 {{is a result}} of one of the report's recommendations.

[...] The main report listed 8 points to consider in deciding the design of the new standard. The first of these was stated as “To ensure the safety of young children it is of considerable importance that the contacts of the socket-outlet should be protected by shutters or other like means, or by the inherent design of the socket-outlet.” [...] Others included flush fitting, no need for a switch, requirements for terminals, bottom entry for the cable, and contact design.

5000|$|The {{design was}} based on an American <b>plug</b> <b>and</b> <b>socket-outlet</b> {{intended}} for use at 120 V which was patented in 1916 under US patent 1,179,728. [...] Australian plugs will fit these obsolete American outlets perfectly. (While this socket-outlet never became a NEMA standard design, the 50 A NEMA 10-50R, has a similar pin configuration in a larger form.) Argentina, Uruguay and China based their plugs and sockets on the same design. New Zealand also adopted the Australian design, since Australian equipment and many electrical appliances were exported to that country.|$|E

5000|$|Within the IEC 62196 {{framework}} {{they propose}} an automotive plug {{derived from the}} earlier Scame plugs (the Libera series) that are already in use for light electric vehicles.Gimélec joined the Alliance on May 10 {{and a number of}} more companies joined on May 31: Gewiss, Marechal Electric, Radiall, Vimar, Weidmüller France & Yazaki Europe. The new connector is able to provide 3-phase charging up to 32 A as being examined in the Formula E-Team tests. Schneider Electric emphasises that the [...] "EV Plug" [...] uses shutters over the socket side pins which is required in 12 European countries and that none of the other proposed EV charger plugs is featuring. Limiting the plug to 32 A allows for cheaper plugs and installation costs. The EV Plug Alliance points out that the future IEC 62196 specification will have an annexe categorizing electric vehicle charger plugs into three types (Yazaki's proposal is type 1, Mennekes' proposal is type 2, Scame's proposal is type 3) and that instead of having a single plug type at both ends of a charger cable one should choose the best type for each side — the Scame / EV Plug would be the best option for the charger side / wall box leaving the choice for the car side open. On 22 September 2010, the companies Citelum, DBT, FCI, Leoni, Nexans, Sagemcom, Tyco Electronics joined the Alliance. As of early July 2010 the Alliance has completed the test of products from several partners and the <b>plug</b> <b>and</b> <b>socket-outlet</b> system are made available on the market.|$|E
