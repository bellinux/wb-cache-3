5000|$|Comb binding (sometimes {{referred}} to as [...] "cerlox or surelox binding") {{is one of many}} ways to bind pages together into a book. This method uses round plastic spines with 19 rings (for US Letter size) or 21 rings (for A4 size) and a hole puncher that makes rectangular holes. Comb binding is sometimes {{referred to}} as <b>plastic</b> <b>comb</b> <b>binding</b> or spiral comb binding.|$|E
50|$|In the past, some comb binding {{machines}} {{would come}} with a wire closer. These machines were designed {{to be used with}} 19 loop wire. Nineteen loop wire is designed to be used with a <b>plastic</b> <b>comb</b> <b>binding</b> pattern. This hole pattern will have longer rectangular holes that are 9/16 in on center. This style of binding used to be referred to as Ibiwire which was Ibico's name for this style of binding. However, when Ibico was purchased by the General Binding Corporation this type of supplies was discontinued. Today, 19-loop wire is commonly called Spiral-O Wire.|$|E
50|$|To prepare {{documents}} for <b>comb</b> <b>binding</b> there are special 19-hole punches for letter paper and 23-hole punches for A4 paper.

5000|$|An {{unbreakable}} <b>plastic</b> <b>comb</b> is a comb that, {{despite being}} {{made of plastic}} rather than (more expensive) metal, does not shatter into multiple pieces if dropped on a hard surface such as bathroom tiles, a hardwood floor, or pavement. [...] Such combs were introduced in the mid-twentieth century. [...] Today most <b>plastic</b> <b>combs</b> are unbreakable as technology has reached a point of understanding the causation of brittleness in these products.|$|R

Comb supplies are typically available {{in a wide range}} of colors and diameters. The supplies themselves can be re-used or recycled. In the United States, <b>comb</b> <b>binding</b> is often referred to as 19-ring binding because it uses a total of 19 holes along the 11-inch side of a sheet of paper.|$|R

50|$|The Special 20 (#560) was {{introduced}} in the mid 1970s. It has the same reeds as a Marine Band, but it has a <b>plastic</b> <b>comb</b> instead of a wooden comb, and rounded edges. It was the first Hohner harmonica to have a <b>plastic</b> <b>comb,</b> which not only made the instrument more airtight, but also eliminated the swelling wood combs go through as they moisten from use. Made in Germany, this model quickly became the preferred choice of many rock and blues players. Now, most harmonicas being manufactured from all companies are based upon the Special 20. Its most noted user is John Popper, who appears on the blister. Like the 1896, the Special 20 also has tuning variations available, like the #560C in country styled tuning, and the #560N in natural minor.|$|R

50|$|Ideally, the two {{different}} materials used for a heterojunction {{would have the same}} lattice constant (spacing between the atoms). In practice, the lattice constants are typically slightly different (e.g. AlGaAs on GaAs), resulting in crystal defects. As an analogy, imagine pushing together two <b>plastic</b> <b>combs</b> with a slightly different spacing. At regular intervals, you'll see two teeth clump together. In semiconductors, these discontinuities form deep-level traps and greatly reduce device performance.|$|R

50|$|Harmonicas were {{in short}} supply in the United States during World War II. Wood and metal {{materials}} for harmonicas were {{in short supply}} because of military demand. Furthermore, the primary harmonica manufacturers were based in Germany and Japan, the enemies of the United States and the Allied forces in the war. During this time, Finn Haakon Magnus, a Danish-American factory worker and entrepreneur, developed and perfected the molded plastic harmonica. The plastic harmonica used molded <b>plastic</b> <b>combs</b> and far fewer pieces than traditional metal or wood harmonicas, which made the harmonica more economical to mass-produce and more sanitary. Though the plastic reeds in these harmonicas produced a less distinctive (and, to many ears, inferior) sound than their metallic counterparts, Magnus harmonicas and several imitators soon became commonplace, particularly among children. The patent for the <b>plastic</b> <b>comb,</b> however, was awarded to William Kratt of Wm. Kratt Company in 1952. During World War II, the War Department allotted a rationed supply of brass to Kratt's factory so they could continue to produce harmonicas that the Red Cross distributed to American troops overseas to boost morale.|$|R
