25|$|Both {{have higher}} risks than a vaginal birth with no {{previous}} caesarean section. There are many issues {{which must be}} taken into account when planning the mode of delivery for every pregnancy, not just those complicated by a previous caesarean section and there is a list of some of these issues in the list of indications for section in the first part of this article. A vaginal birth after caesarean section (VBAC) confers a higher risk of uterine rupture (5 per 1,000), blood transfusion or endometritis (10 per 1,000), and <b>perinatal</b> <b>death</b> of the child (0.25 per 1,000). Furthermore, 20% to 40% of planned VBAC attempts end in caesarean section being needed, with greater risks of complications in an emergency repeat caesarean section than in an elective repeat caesarean section. On the other hand, VBAC confers less maternal morbidity and a decreased risk of complications in future pregnancies than elective repeat caesarean section.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the various causes of <b>perinatal</b> <b>deaths</b> and adopt strategies to improve perinatal outcome at a referral teaching hospital in North Kerala. METHODS: A prospective observational study conducted at Institute of Maternal and Child Health, Government Medical College, Kozhikode. All <b>perinatal</b> <b>deaths</b> {{during the period}} January 2013 to December 2014 were analysed and from this factors responsible for <b>perinatal</b> <b>deaths</b> were identified. RESULTS: Out of total 30, 042 deliveries, there were 966 <b>perinatal</b> <b>deaths</b> during the study period. 566 were still births and 400 early neonatal <b>deaths.</b> The <b>perinatal</b> mortality rate was 31. 1 per 1000 live births.

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{the proportion of}} <b>perinatal</b> <b>deaths</b> that could be reduced by midwives providing primary obstetric services. Method: The {{study was conducted in}} a rural region of the Eastern Cape, South Africa. The primary obstetric and final causes of <b>perinatal</b> <b>deaths</b> and avoidable factors related to these deaths were determined in a large town and two small towns. Results: In the three towns 52 (48. 6 %) of the 107 avoidable factors were related to medical care while 20 (38. 5 %) of these had the potential to be prevented at the level of care rendered by midwives. In the large town 21 (20. 6 %) of 102 and in the smaller towns 15 (24. 6 %) of 61 <b>perinatal</b> <b>deaths</b> had potential for intervention by midwives.

2500|$|PGD/PGS is an {{invasive}} procedure {{that requires a}} serious consideration, according to Michael Tucker, Ph.D., Scientific Director and Chief Embryologist at Georgia Reproductive Specialists in Atlanta. [...] One of the risks of PGD includes damage to the embryo during the biopsy procedure (which in turn destroys the embryo as a whole), according to Serena H. Chen, M.D., a New Jersey reproductive endocrinologist with IRMS Reproductive Medicine at Saint Barnabas. [...] Another risk is cryopreservation where the embryo is stored in a frozen state and thawed later for the procedure. About 20% of the thawed embryos do not survive. [...] There has been a study indicating a biopsied embryo has a less rate of surviving cryopreservation. [...] Another study suggests that PGS with cleavage-stage biopsy results in a significantly lower live birth rate for women of advanced maternal age. [...] Also, another study recommends the caution and a long term follow-up as PGD/PGS increases the <b>perinatal</b> <b>death</b> rate in multiple pregnancies.|$|E

40|$|Objective. The Gambia {{has one of}} the world's highest {{perinatal}} mortality rates. We explored barriers of timely access to emergency obstetric care services resulting in <b>perinatal</b> <b>deaths</b> and in survivors of severe obstetric complications in rural Gambia. Method. We applied the “three delays” model as a framework for assessing contributing factors to <b>perinatal</b> <b>deaths</b> and obstetric complications. Qualitative in-depth interviews were conducted with 20 survivors of severe obstetric complications at home settings within three to four weeks after hospital discharge. Family members and traditional birth attendants were also interviewed. The interviews were translated into English and transcribed verbatim. We used content analysis to identify barriers of care. Results. Transport/cost-related delays are the major contributors of <b>perinatal</b> <b>deaths</b> in this study. A delay in recognising danger signs of pregnancy/labour or decision to seek care outside the home was the second important contributor of <b>perinatal</b> <b>deaths.</b> Decision to seek care may be timely, but impaired access precluded utilization of EmOC services. Obtaining blood for transfusion was also identified as a deterrent to appropriate care. Conclusion. Delays in accessing EmOC are critical in <b>perinatal</b> <b>deaths.</b> Thus, timely availability of emergency transport services and prompt decision-making are warranted for improved perinatal outcomes in rural Gambia...|$|R
40|$|Background: In Nigeria, of {{the over}} 900, 000 {{children}} under the age of 5 years that die every year, perinatal mortality is responsible for a little over 20 %. Previous reports are largely from the southern part of the country. This is the first report of perinatal data from the northwest of Nigeria. Methods: A case control study of <b>perinatal</b> <b>deaths</b> in the three major public hospitals in Katsina metropolis was carried out to determine the pattern of <b>perinatal</b> <b>deaths</b> in the metropolis. Data were collected over a 6 week period on maternal socio-demographic, antenatal, and delivery variables. Data were similarly obtained on neonatal profile and morbidities. Results:There were 143 <b>perinatal</b> <b>deaths</b> (94 stillbirths and 49 early neonatal deaths) out of 1104 live and stillbirths during the study period. The perinatal mortality rate was thus 130 per 1000 births with a stillbirth rate of 85 per 1000 births and an early neonatal mortality rate of 49 per 1000 live births. Stillbirths during the intrapartum period were twice as frequent as macerated stillbirths (2 : 1).
