Of these studies there were main purposes treating this reaction at the temperature near the boiling <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>reaction</b> mixture as the autocatalytic reaction with aluminum chloride, but the worth of this reaction as the representative of reaction between chlorohydrocarbons and metals has been noticed.

In the present paper, the study showed as heading is carried out as the preliminary stage of {{the reaction}} between other metals and carbon tetrachloride. The outline of the experimental results are summarized in the following: [...] (i) For the reaction between aluminum particles and carbon tetrachloride, iron powder, 20 mesh spongy zinc or 20 mesh spongy titanium varied this induction perlod relating their quantities added, and the relation of the both was showed by the somewhat resembling curves having two minimum and one maximum for each case. (ii) This reaction was promoted by the addition of iron powder or spongy titanium, and especially this effect was remarkable with the fitted quantities for each metal. It is suggested by this fact that some attention for the treating of aluminum containing these metals with chlorohydrocarbon at the temperature near the boiling point should be paid. (iii) The present study is not sufficient to explain the mechanism for the effect of the addition of these metals, but that may be concerned with the chlorides produc ing from these metals. 金属アルミニウムと四塩化炭素との反応については著者の一人浅岡等が昭和 21 年以来種々の実験を行いその結果を発表して来ており，雑誌『化学』の昭和 31 年 6 月号にはその頃までの報告の総括をなしている。それ以後も引続きこの反応に関しての発表をなして来ている。これ等の研究は主として夜相の沸点附近に於けるこの反応を塩化アルミニウム自己触媒反応とて取扱うのを主目標として来たのであるが，これは叉塩素化炭化水素と金属との反応の一つの代表としての価値をも認めて来たものでもある。そして塩素化炭化水素としては四塩化エタン，五塩化エタン及びトリクロロエチレン等を用いた実験も一部行って来ているが，一方に於て金属の側についてもアルミニウムの代りにアルミニウム合金とか他の金属とかの場合の反応を定性的には少し行ったりして来たのである。先ず鉄粉と四塩化炭素を液相の沸点附近に長時間加熱すれば六塩化エタンの生成が認められるから，これはアルミニウムの場合と全く類似の次式で示される反応が起ったものと推定される。 6 CCl_ 4 + 2 Fe = 3 C_ 2 Cl_ 6 + 2 FeCl_ 3 ところがこの反応の反応誘導期は極めて長く，自己触媒反応の過程に入ってからも反応の進行は極めて緩徐である。更にこの反応は予め塩化鉄や塩化アルミニウムを添加した場合には反応誘導期の可成の知縮が起り，後者の添加の方が著しく良好な事が知られた。本報に於てはアルミニウム以外の金属と四塩化炭素との反応の研究の予備段階として標題の研究をなした結果について述べるものである...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{application}} of load path algorithms to define trajectories for placement of reinforcing fibres in membrane tension structures. Load paths can define how a structure performs its intended load carrying function transferring loads from a point of application to a <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>reaction.</b> In recent years, a novel method to compute these paths has emerged in the literature using finite element analysis yet common FEA packages do not have options to generate these paths. Therefore load path generation needs to be performed by integration of an external numerical computing environment (i. e. MATLAB or FORTRAN). In this thesis a method of visualizing of load paths in membrane structures has been achieved by overlaying of link and shell elements in the commercial finite element program ANSYS. The method is based on equilibrium of nodal forces and starts with consideration of trusses. Load flow is identified by removing elements from an over populated model using an evolutionary method. The design procedure is iterated {{for a number of}} loops by slowly deactivating inefficient elements by a scalar criterion in ANSYS programming language. The integrity of this design technique is verified by analyzing number of models (trusses and shells). The work is then extended to membrane structures. Static structural analysis using finite element geometric nonlinear analysis due to the large deflection is conducted for a rectangle membrane under uniform pressure. Shell and link elements in the model represent the main cloth and possible carbon fibre paths respectively. By introducing the procedure of elimination, two diagonal straps of link elements bridging the corners remained in the corner fixed structure. The final application of this research is cruising boat sails which are analyzed with the proposed nonlinear programming formulation. The results from this work are compared to the patterns in existing sails. Finally, this work concludes that defining load paths using overlaid link and shell elements for reinforcement of the structure can provide qualitative information on the trajectories followed by load in structures and it can predict trajectories for reinforcing carbon fibre paths. This thesis has focused on developing the numerical algorithms. A deeper investigation of manufacturing methods and collaboration with manufacturers of shade structures or yacht sails is recommended as future work...|$|E

40|$|The aim in {{this study}} was to find the {{precursor}} for low halogenated hydrocarbon contaminated in the tap water from the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>reaction</b> chemistry. When a 100 ppb solution containing any of these organic compounds (ethanol, acetoaldehyde, acetone, dimedone, 5 -methylfurfural, acetophenone, hydroquinone, resorcinol, catecoal, pyrogallol, frorogurcinol and humic acid) was allowed to react with the 10 ppm chlorine water at 25 ℃ and pH= 7. 0, trichloromethane was undoubtedly formed from the acctone, dimedone, 5 -methylfurfural, resorcinol and humic aeid. When acetone or acetophenone was reactant, it seemed that the typc of the trichloromethane reaction at pH= 7 reprcsented seccesivefirst order kinetics. Next, three reaction experiments detcrmining whether CHCl₃ and CHCl₂Br could be formed or not were conducted by using the test waters which was made from raw water removing humic acid by the pretreatmcnts. In the casc of the test water that was eluated through anion exchange resin (IRA- 402), CHCl₃ and CHCl₂Br were not detected. But, in the other test waters, CHCl₃ and CHCl₂Br were formed, the amounts of CHCl₃ and CHCl₂Br which were produced in both the test waters, One filtered with No. 6 filter paper and the other filtered with the same paper after precipitation treatment at pH= 1, were less than those of raw water, The normal concentration of acetone, 5 -methylfurfural, and acetophenone in raw water was extremely less than 100 ppb used in this experiment. So, it would not seem that these compounds are the precursor for low halogenated hydrocarbon in tap water. On other hand, humic acid {{is considered to be a}} brccursor, because ofthe experimental facts (1) that the low halogenated hydrocarbons were formed from humic acid (2) that the low halogenated hydrocarbons were not detected in the effluent through the anion exchange resin and (3) that this concentration of humic acid was thought to be present in raw water. The low brominated hydrocarbon in tap water would be formed in the following ways: The concentration of Brˉ was about 80 ppb. The Brˉ is changed to Br₂ with the addition of Cl₂.

40|$|Spectrochemical {{observations}} were chiefly attempted on the formation process of verdohemochrome from protohemin dimethyl ester by O(2) {{in the presence}} of ascorbic acid. And the results were as follows. 1. Verdohemochrome was obtained from pyridine hemin dimethyl ester by the action of ascorbic acid and O(2). And the process of this reaction was spectrophotometrically similar to that of hemin. 2. The reaction construction was same to that of hemin and the compound with the absorption maximum at 630 mμ. was found {{in the course of this}} reaction, as a intermediate product. This product was purely obtained from pyridine hemin dimethyl ester by the action of H(2) O(2) {{in the presence of}} ascorbic acid, and it was transformed into verdohemochrome by O(2). 3. It was supposed that the compound with the absorption maximum at 630 mμ. and verdohemochrome were dimethyl ester. Biliverdin could be extracted from the latter by HCl and it was difficult to conclude if it was dimethyl ester, but it was thought that some part of it was probably ester. The absorption curves of these reaction products were nearly same to that obtained from hemin. 4. The necessary concentration of ascorbic acid for the formation of verdohemochrome in 60 % pyridine water was 9. 4 Mol. to 1 Mol. of hemin dimethyl ester, and it was equivalent to 3 / 4 on the occation of hemin. It was thought that the difference was caused by the reactivity. And the necessary concentration of ascorbic acid decreased with increasing pyridine concentration. 5. The most appropriate concentration of ascorbic acid was the smallest amount described the above, on the view <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>reaction</b> velocity and verdohemochrome yield, and they decreased with the higher concentration of ascorbic acid than the above. However, the formation velocity of the compound with the absorption maximum at 630 mμ. was increased with increasing the ascorbic acid concentration. 6. It was supposed that the catalytic action of the compound with the absorption maximum at 630 mμ. and verdohemochrome was remarkably reinforced in the higher concentration of pyridine and it was thought that the secondary reaction by the excessive concentration of ascorbic acid was caused by the above action. The secondary reaction velocity of them was 1 / 2 of that obtained from hemin. 7. The abnormal reaction of the compound with the absorption maximum at 630 mμ. was observed as the absorption band around 610 mμ. The process of the further oxidation of verdohemochrome by ascorbic acid was, spectrophotometrically, quite similar to the oxidation of it by H(2) O(2), and both of them were oxidized to yellow substances. Positive pentdyopent reaction was observed in this process. 8. Since the above results, the reactivity of hemin was fairly declined by the esterification of carboxylic acid groups in the side chains, but it was recognized that the formation process of verdohemochrome was not essentially effected by the above esterification...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} work, {{which was}} part of {{collaborative}} research centre 442 was the synthesis of two lubricants with special focus on optimized application requirement and batch comparability in a 25 -l-batch production. On one hand a low viscosity lubricant based on technical grade oleic acid methyl ester with the main component HISM, on the other hand a high viscosity one based on glycerintrioleate with the main component HIGTS was synthesized. Both lubricants were synthesized in a two-step reaction via epoxidation of the double bond and ring opening via alcoholysis afterwards. With this modification the fatty acid esters were stabilized against air-aging and their viscosity was raised. Further on many side reactions were minimized and the main components HISM and HIGTS were abuzz in each lubricant system. For lubricant characterization analytical methods as e. g. GC were developed and used to determine conversions, selectivity and kinetic values (chapter 3. 4). With developing an alkaline decomposition reaction according to the DGF-Einheitsmethoden [47] the HIGTS lubricant (high temperature GC) was converted into the lower boiling HISM-system and both systems were directly comparable. Further more inline ATR IR spectroscopy was used to monitor the reaction progress. With a small failure in measurement between 1 and 5 % the method delivered a high data density at each <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>reaction</b> progress. As a lubricant specification and quality control typical oil-values as e. g. viscosity, neutralization-, saponification- and iodine numbers were determined. In lab scale different reaction setups (order of reactants, stirring speed…) were tested to study the influence of mass transport limitation during the epoxidation. The variation of hydrogen peroxide concentration led to heavy losses in conversion. However the major reaction influence was monitored with temperature variation for both epoxidation and alcoholysis (rising temperature > 60 °C caused DHSM production). For the alcoholysis reaction the influence of catalyst mass as well as different catalyst systems were tested in conversion and selectivity. Best results were obtained with Amberlyst 15 and the similar Dowex Marathon C catalyst. With the collected expertises in lab scale the 25 -l-pilot plant was optimized. An automated and computer controlled reaction procedure minimized unwanted side reactions (over-night stand still times) and also raised batch reproducibility. With a special catalyst cleaning process using scCO 2 and vacuum drying afterwards the catalyst could be recycled at least three times in reaction without any remarkable losses in selectivity and conversion. But with recycling the catalyst it starts to leach H 2 SO 4 and aryl-sulphuric acid groups in the lubricant that decreased biodegradability and even caused toxicity against algae. This problem was fixed with integrating a steam stripping unit into the pilot plant. Finally optimizing the pilot plant not only led to a successful batch reproducibility and comparability but also a biodegradable production rout with e. g. small solvent amounts could be developed. Further more the optimized production process with methyl esters based on animal waste could be assigned on methyl esters based on rape seed (inapplicable for application requirement because of high unsaturated fatty acid grades, a weak anti air-aging behavior and contents of antioxidants; compare chapter 3. 5. 6). The high grade of synthesis optimization and batch reproducibility in this work was not only reached by process optimization. Further more multidisciplinary feedback of other CRC 442 Project partners with their research topics (e. g. changing biodegradability during synthesis optimization; TP A 4; TP A 6) led to the high grade of reproducibility in synthesis and characterizing the lubricants...|$|E
