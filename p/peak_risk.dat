40|$|Natural catastrophes {{and global}} {{reinsurance}} – exploring the linkages 1 Natural disasters resulting in significant losses {{have become more}} frequent in recent decades, with 2011 being the costliest year in history. This feature explores how risk is transferred within and beyond the global insurance sector and assesses the financial linkages that arise in the process. In particular, retrocession and securitisation allow for risk-sharing with other financial institutions and the broader financial market. While {{the fact that most}} risk is retained within the global insurance market makes these linkages appear small, they warrant attention due to their potential ramifications and the dependencies they introduce. JEL classification: G 22, L 22, Q 54. The physical destruction caused by severe natural catastrophes triggers a series of adverse effects. Damaged production facilities, shattered transportation infrastructure and business interruption produce both direct losses and indirect macroeconomic costs in the form of foregone output (von Peter et al (2012)). Beyond these economic costs are enormous human suffering and a host of longerterm socioeconomic consequences, documented by the World Bank and United Nations (2010). By examining catastrophe-related losses over the past three decades, this special feature explores the linkages that arise in the transfer of risk from policyholders {{all the way to the}} ultimate bearer of risk. It describes the contracts and premiums exchanged for protection, and the way reinsurers diversify and retain risks on their balance sheets. In so doing, the feature traces how losses cascade through the system when large natural disasters occur. Losses from insured property and infrastructure first affect primary insurers, who in turn rely on reinsurers to absorb <b>peak</b> <b>risks</b> – low-probability, high-impact events. Reinsurers, in turn, use their balance sheets and, to a lesser extent, retrocession and securitisation arrangements, to manage <b>peak</b> <b>risks</b> across time and space. 2 1...|$|R
40|$|Catastrophe risk models allow insurers, reinsurers {{and governments}} {{to assess the}} risk of loss from catastrophic events, such as hurricanes. These models rely on {{computer}} technology and the latest earth and meteorological science information to generate thousands if not millions of simulated events. Recently observed hurricane activity, particularly in the 2004 and 2005 hurricane seasons, in conjunction with recently published scientific literature has led risk modelers to revisit their hurricane models and develop climate conditioned hurricane models. This paper discusses these climate conditioned hurricane models and compares their risk estimates to those of base normal hurricane models. This comparison shows that the recent 50 year period of climate change has potentially increased North Atlantic hurricane frequency by 30 percent. However, such an increase in hurricane frequency would result {{in an increase in}} risk to human property that is equivalent to less than 10 years’ worth of US coastal property growth. Increases in potential extreme losses require the reinsurance industry to secure additional risk capital for these <b>peak</b> <b>risks,</b> resulting in the short term in lower risk capacity for developing countries. However, reinsurers and investors in catastrophe securities may still have a long-term interest in providing catastrophe coverage in middle and low-income countries as this allows reinsurers and investors to better diversify their catastrophe risk portfolios.

40|$|Background. When 12 -to- 21 -year-olds {{start using}} {{prescription}} pain relievers extra-medically, {{some of them}} transition into opioid dependence within 12 months after such use. Our main aim for this epidemiological research on 12 -to- 21 -year-olds in the United States (US) is to estimate the risk of becoming a newly incident case of opioid dependence within 12 months after onset of using prescription pain relievers extra-medically (EMPPR). Methods. Meta-analyses from multiple independent replication samples now are possible, based upon nationally representative survey samples of US adolescents age 12 – 21 years. All 12 -to- 21 -year-olds were sampled and recruited for the US National Surveys on Drug Use and Health, with standardized assessments of EMPPR use and opioid dependence (NSDUH, 2002 – 2013). Results. <b>Peak</b> <b>risk</b> for a transition from start of EMPPR use to opioid dependence within 12 months is seen at mid-adolescence among 14 -to- 15 -year-olds (6. 3 %, 8. 7 % per year), somewhat earlier than <b>peak</b> <b>risk</b> for starting EMPPR use (seen for 16 -to- 19 -year-olds at 4. 1 %, 5. 9 % per year). Applied to 12 -to- 21 -year-olds in the US between 2002 – 2013, an estimated 8 million started using PPR extra-medically. Each year, roughly 42, 000 to 58, 000 transitioned into opioid dependence within 12 months after onset of such use. Discussion. These epidemiological estimates for the US in recent years teach us to expect one transition into adolescent-onset opioid dependence within 12 months for every 11 – 16 newly incident EMPPR users, yielding perhaps 120 newly incident opioid dependent cases in need of practitioner attention or treatment services, each day of each year. This evidence {{can be used to}} motivate more effective public health prevention, outreach, and early intervention programs as might prevent or delay occurrence of EMPPR use and opioid dependence...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT-The {{occurrence}} of tumors in 236 female and 74 male BN/Bi rats that {{were allowed to}} live out their normal life-spans was described. For most neoplasms, {{the risk of a}} rat dying with a specific tumor increased with age. Some tumors, however, had a peak incidence; therefore, animals surviving these periods were at less risk than were their younger cohorts. The number dying with metastatic cancers was greatest in females over 30 months of age. Unexpectedly, males had a <b>peak</b> <b>risk</b> period at 25 - 30 months, so that males that died in older age groups had less risk of dying with a metastatic tumor.

40|$|International audienceThe {{fatality}} risk {{caused by}} avalanches on road networks can be analysed using a long-term approach, {{resulting in a}} mean value of risk, and with emphasis on short-term fluctuations due to the temporal variability of both, the hazard potential and the damage potential. In this study, the approach for analysing the long-term fatality risk has been adapted by modelling the highly variable short-term risk. The emphasis was on the temporal variability of the damage potential and the related <b>risk</b> <b>peaks.</b> For defined hazard scenarios resulting from classified amounts of snow accumulation, the fatality risk was calculated by modelling the hazard potential and observing the traffic volume. The avalanche occurrence probability was calculated using a statistical relationship between new snow height and observed avalanche releases. The number of persons at risk was determined from the recorded traffic density. The method resulted in a value for the fatality risk within the observed time frame for the studied road segment. The long-term fatality risk due to snow avalanches {{as well as the}} short-term fatality risk was compared to the average fatality risk due to traffic accidents. The application of the method had shown that the long-term avalanche risk is lower than the fatality risk due to traffic accidents. The analyses of short-term avalanche-induced fatality <b>risk</b> provided <b>risk</b> <b>peaks</b> that were 50 times higher than the statistical accident risk. Apart from situations with high hazard level and high traffic density, <b>risk</b> <b>peaks</b> result from both, a high hazard level combined with a low traffic density and a high traffic density combined with a low hazard level. This provided evidence for the importance of the temporal variability of the damage potential for risk simulations on road networks. The assumed dependence of the risk calculation on the sum of precipitation within three days is a simplified model. Thus, further research is needed for an improved determination of the diurnal avalanche probability. Nevertheless, the presented approach may contribute as a conceptual step towards a risk-based decision-making in risk management...|$|R

Results: CJD developed in 38 patients. Risk of CJD was significantly increased by treatment with hGH prepared by the Wilhelmi method of extraction from human pituitaries. Risk was further raised if this treatment was administered at ages 8 to 10 years. The <b>peak</b> <b>risk</b> of CJD was estimated to occur 20 years after first exposure, and the estimated lifetime cumulative risk of CJD in Wilhelmi-treated patients was 4. 5 %.

40|$|International audienceA spatio-temporal {{analysis}} {{was carried out}} {{to see how the}} risk distribution of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in France changed depending on the period of birth. The data concerned the 539 BSE cases born in France after the ban (BAB) of meat and bone meal (MBM) in 1990 and detected between July 1, 2001 and December 31, 2003, when the surveillance of BSE was comprehensive. Seventy-two of these cases were born after the reinforced (second) ban (BASB) in 1996, which involved the removal of BSE-risk materials and cadavers from the processing of MBM. The Ederer-Myers-Mantel (EMM) time and space cluster test was applied, after classifying the cases by trimester and region of birth, BAB or BASB status, and dairy or beef status. Then disease mapping was performed for four successive birth periods, three for the BAB cases (January 1991 through June 1994, July 1994 through June 1995, July 1995 through June 1996), and one for the BASB (July 1996 through October 1998). It was elaborated with the Bayesian graphical modelling methods and based on a Poisson distribution with spatial smoothing. The parameters were estimated by a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation method. The main finding was that the areas with the highest risk of BSE changed largely from one birth period to another; from the west, it reached the east of France for birth cohort 1994 - 1995 and the southwest for birth cohort 1995 - 1996. The EMM test identified a <b>peak</b> <b>risk</b> in this region both for dairy and beef cattle in the fall 1995. The spatial distribution of the risk for the BASB cases matched the spatial pattern of risk for the preceding BAB birth cohort quite well; this was in favour of a common origin of the infection of the BAB and BASB cases, despite the complementary control measures...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn France, {{implementation}} of systematic screening programs in 2000, as a complement to the mandatory reporting of animals with clinical signs of BSE (passive surveillance), revealed certain {{limitations of the}} mandatory system. Indeed, systematic screening showed that some BSE cases were not detected by the clinical surveillance system, implying considerable BSE case under-reporting throughout the epidemic. As the most likely explanation for variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) is exposure to the aetiologic agent of BSE, {{it is essential to}} reconstruct the French BSE epidemic pattern accounting for this under-reporting. We estimated age- and year-specific incidence rates of BSE by using a back-calculation method. This approach relies on the principle that the number of clinical BSE cases is the consequence of the number of BSE-infected animals after a known incubation time, defined as the time between infection and clinical onset. We generalized this model to take into account epidemiological characteristics of BSE, such as French cattle mortality, BSE case reporting probability, and age-dependent susceptibility and/or exposure to the BSE agent. We confirmed that the average BSE incubation period is five years and that the <b>peak</b> <b>risk</b> of bovine infection occurs between 6 and 12 months of age. The results also showed that the proportion of underreporting is the most influential parameter in the model, and that BSE was substantially underreported until rapid tests were introduced. Indeed, only 103 BSE cases were detected by passive surveillance up to June 2000, while we estimated that there was 301 200 (95 % confidence interval (CI) [27 600 - 837 600]) cattle infected by the BSE agent. Despite uncertainty over the beginning of the epidemic, we showed that the French BSE epidemic in the late 1980 s was completely undetected, and only the second wave, after 1990, was observed...|$|E
40|$|Tick {{transmission}} of Borrelia spirochetes to humans results in significant morbidity from Lyme disease. Animal {{studies have demonstrated}} that {{transmission of}} Borrelia from tick vector to the mammalian host can be blocked by antibodies against outer surface protein A (OspA). We have recently developed borreliacidal human IgG 1 monoclonal antibodies (HuMabs) directed against OspA. HuMab 319 - 44 was borreliacidal against B. burgdorferi (IC 50 Borreliatransmission after a single dose of 2 mg/kg administered on the day of tick challenge. Since passively administered IgG 1 antibodies do not have a sufficient half-life to provide protection for the 6 - 7 month <b>peak</b> <b>risk</b> period, we investigated a novel approach of vector-mediated gene transfer of HuMabs that could potentially provide protection against Lyme disease during the seasonal risk period. A modified HuMab, 319 - 44 mod, expressed by a synthetic DNA plasmid (DMAb) was optimized and characterized in in vitro OspA binding and bactericidal assays. To assess in vivo protection, mice were administered a single DMAb injection into the quadriceps followed by electroporation. The mice were then challenged by B. burgdorferi-infected nymphs. Tissue samples were monitored by dark-field microscopy for spirochete growth. Serum samples were analyzed by ELISA to determine antibody concentrations. The modified 319 - 44 DMAb maintained in vitro biological activity comparable to the un-modified wild type antibody, and formulation-based delivery of DMAb resulted in long-term expression. This led to effective pre-exposure prophylaxis preventing transmission of spirochetes in 80 % of mice in the murine model of tick-transmitted Lyme disease. These studies represent the first demonstration of employing DNA transfer as a rapid, novel delivery system for biologically relevant functional full-length HuMAbs in an in vivo animal model and provide support for such an approach for pre-exposure immunoprophylaxis to prevent Lyme disease...|$|E
40|$|Climate change {{impact on}} {{hydrological}} extremes (floods and low flows) {{has been investigated}} for rivers in highly urbanized catchments in the Flanders region of Belgium. Results of 24 simulations with 10 Regional Climate Models (RCMs) delivered by the PRUDENCE project and processed by the Royal Meteorological Institute of Belgium, were statistically analyzed for both the control period 1961 - 1990 and the scenario period 2071 - 2100. They were summarized in high, mean and low climate change scenarios for rainfall and potential evapotranspiration (ETo), and applied to the input of lumped conceptual hydrological models of the studied catchments. The climate change impacts generally tend towards wetter winters and drier summers. The runoff <b>peaks</b> (flood <b>risk)</b> systematically increase and decrease depending on the scenario showing high uncertainty and can reach increases up to + 35 %. Low flows decrease severely in all cases. The findings show that {{the intensity of the}} impacts is only slightly dependent on the location. The local physico-morphological characteristics seem to weakly influence the differences seen in hydrological responses due to climate change scenarios forcing leaving their place to natural variability and to uncertainty brought through hydrological models. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Orthotopic liver {{transplantation}} (OLT) with donation after circulatory death (DCD) {{often leads}} to a higher first week peak alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and {{a higher rate of}} biliary nonanastomotic strictures (NAS) as compared to donation after brain death (DBD). This retrospective study was to evaluate whether an association exists between peak ALT and the development of NAS in OLT with livers from DBD (n= 399) or DCD (n= 97) from two transplantation centers. Optimal cutoff value of <b>peak</b> ALT for <b>risk</b> of development of NAS post-DCD-OLT was 1300 IU/l. The 4 -year cumulative incidence of NAS after DCD-OLT was 49. 5 % in patients with a high ALT peak post-OLT, compared with 11. 3 % in patients with a low ALT peak. (...|$|R
