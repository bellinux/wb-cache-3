5|$|Retrograde {{signaling}} is {{a hypothesis}} {{that attempts to}} explain that, while LTP is induced and expressed postsynaptically, some evidence {{suggests that it is}} expressed presynaptically as well. The hypothesis gets its name because normal synaptic transmission is directional and proceeds from the presynaptic to the <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>cell.</b> For induction to occur postsynaptically and be partially expressed presynaptically, a message must travel from the <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>cell</b> to the presynaptic cell in a retrograde (reverse) direction. Once there, the message presumably initiates a cascade of events that leads to a presynaptic component of expression, such as the increased probability of neurotransmitter vesicle release.|$|E
5|$|Late LTP (L-LTP) is {{the natural}} {{extension}} of E-LTP. Unlike E-LTP, which is independent of protein synthesis, L-LTP requires gene transcription and protein synthesis in the <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>cell.</b> Two phases of L-LTP exist: the first depends upon protein synthesis, while the second depends upon both gene transcription and protein synthesis. These phases are occasionally called LTP2 and LTP3, respectively, with E-LTP referred to as LTP1 under this nomenclature.|$|E
5|$|LTP can {{be induced}} either by strong tetanic {{stimulation}} {{of a single}} pathway to a synapse, or cooperatively via the weaker stimulation of many. When one pathway into a synapse is stimulated weakly, it produces insufficient postsynaptic depolarization to induce LTP. In contrast, when weak stimuli are applied to many pathways that converge on a single patch of postsynaptic membrane, the individual postsynaptic depolarizations generated may collectively depolarize the <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>cell</b> enough to induce LTP cooperatively. Synaptic tagging, discussed later, may be a common mechanism underlying associativity and cooperativity. Bruce McNaughton argues that any difference between associativity and cooperativity is strictly semantic.|$|E
25|$|The {{synaptic}} cleft is {{a gap between}} the pre- and <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>cells</b> that is about 20nm wide. The small volume of the cleft allows neurotransmitter concentration to be raised and lowered rapidly.|$|R
40|$|SummaryA {{new study}} {{describes}} cellular mechanisms establishing synaptic specificity during development and remodeling of a zebrafish mechanosensory organ.

2500|$|These {{proteins}} change shape, {{causing the}} membranes of some [...] "docked" [...] vesicles to fuse with the membrane of the presynaptic cell, thereby opening the vesicles and dumping their neurotransmitter contents into the synaptic cleft, the narrow {{space between the}} membranes of the pre- and <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>cells.</b>|$|R
5|$|Even {{in studies}} {{restricted}} to postsynaptic events, investigators have not determined {{the location of}} the protein synthesis that underlies L-LTP. Specifically, it is unclear whether protein synthesis takes place in the <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>cell</b> body or in its dendrites. Despite having observed ribosomes (the major components of the protein synthesis machinery) in dendrites as early as the 1960s, prevailing wisdom was that the cell body was the predominant site of protein synthesis in neurons. This reasoning was not seriously challenged until the 1980s, when investigators reported observing protein synthesis in dendrites whose connection to their cell body had been severed. More recently, investigators have demonstrated that this type of local protein synthesis is necessary for some types of LTP.|$|E
25|$|Immediately {{opposite}} is {{a region of}} the <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>cell</b> containing neurotransmitter receptors; for synapses between two neurons the postsynaptic region may {{be found on the}} dendrites or cell body. Immediately behind the postsynaptic membrane is an elaborate complex of interlinked proteins called the postsynaptic density (PSD).|$|E
25|$|Chemical synapses pass {{information}} directionally from a {{presynaptic cell}} to a <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>cell</b> {{and are therefore}} asymmetric in structure and function. The presynaptic terminal, or synaptic bouton, is a specialized area within the axon of the presynaptic cell that contains neurotransmitters enclosed in small membrane-bound spheres called synaptic vesicles (as {{well as a number}} of other supporting structures and organelles, such as mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum). Synaptic vesicles are docked at the presynaptic plasma membrane at regions called active zones.|$|E

40|$|In flies, {{retrograde}} BMP signaling is {{an important}} mechanism by which <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>cells</b> regulate the structure and function of presynaptic terminals, ostensibly through changes in gene expression.

25|$|In general, if an {{excitatory}} synapse is strong enough, an action {{potential in the}} presynaptic neuron will trigger an action potential in the <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>cell.</b> In many cases the excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) will not reach the threshold for eliciting an action potential. When action potentials from multiple presynaptic neurons fire simultaneously, or if a single presynaptic neuron fires at a high enough frequency, the EPSPs can overlap and summate. If enough EPSPs overlap, the summated EPSP can reach the threshold for initiating an action potential. This process is known as summation, and {{can serve as a}} high pass filter for neurons.|$|E
25|$|Receptors on the {{opposite}} side of the synaptic gap bind neurotransmitter molecules. Receptors can respond in either of two general ways. First, the receptors may directly open ligand-gated ion channels in the <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>cell</b> membrane, causing ions to enter or exit the cell and changing the local transmembrane potential. The resulting change in voltage is called a postsynaptic potential. In general, the result is excitatory in the case of depolarizing currents, and inhibitory in the case of hyperpolarizing currents. Whether a synapse is excitatory or inhibitory depends on what type(s) of ion channel conduct the postsynaptic current(s), which in turn is a function of the type of receptors and neurotransmitter employed at the synapse. The second way a receptor can affect membrane potential is by modulating the production of chemical messengers inside the postsynaptic neuron. These second messengers can then amplify the inhibitory or excitatory response to neurotransmitters.|$|E
500|$|While {{the above}} model of E-LTP {{describes}} entirely postsynaptic mechanisms for induction, maintenance, and expression, an additional component of expression may occur presynaptically. One hypothesis of this presynaptic facilitation is that persistent CaMKII {{activity in the}} <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>cell</b> during E-LTP {{may lead to the}} synthesis of a [...] "retrograde messenger", discussed later. According to this hypothesis, the newly synthesized messenger travels across the synaptic cleft from the postsynaptic to the presynaptic cell, leading to a chain of events that facilitate the presynaptic response to subsequent stimuli. Such events may include an increase in neurotransmitter vesicle number, probability of vesicle release, or both. In addition to the retrograde messenger underlying presynaptic expression in early LTP, the retrograde messenger may also {{play a role in the}} expression of late LTP.|$|E
25|$|Exogenous excitotoxins {{refer to}} {{neurotoxins}} that also act at <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>cells</b> {{but are not}} normally found in the body. These toxins may enter the body of an organism from the environment through wounds, food intake, aerial dispersion etc. Common excitotoxins include glutamate analogs that mimic the action of glutamate at glutamate receptors, including AMPA and NMDA receptors.|$|R
40|$|Endocannabinoids {{serve as}} {{retrograde}} messengers that are released by <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>cells</b> to regulate neurotransmitter release from presynaptic boutons. A new study {{in this issue}} of Neuron by Tanimura et al. establishes that most endocannabinoid signaling in the brain is a consequence of the calcium-dependent or receptor-driven generation of the retrograde signal 2 -arachidonoylglycerol (2 -AG) by diacylglycerol lipase α (DGLα) ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceDuring {{developmental}} synaptogenesis, the pre- and <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>cells</b> undergo specific {{interactions that}} lead to the establishment of the mature circuit. We have studied the roles of the pre- and <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>cells</b> in establishing this mature innervation by using an in vitro model of synaptic development. We describe climbing fiber (CF) -Purkinje cell (PC) synaptogenesis in cultured mouse hindbrain explants and show that synaptic competition occurs during early development in vitro. By manipulating the maturation stage of each of the synaptic partners in a coculture experimental paradigm, we found that multi-innervation does not occur when both synaptic partners are mature and have already experienced synapse elimination; in contrast, mature PCs can be multi-innervated when they have never experienced synapse elimination and/or when CFs are immature. However in these cases, the normal process of synapse elimination is impaired. These results show that CF-synapse elimination occurs only during a PC-dependant critical period and triggers indelible signals that prevent synapse competition in the mature system...|$|R
500|$|Lømo's {{experiments}} {{focused on}} connections, or synapses, from the perforant pathway to the dentate gyrus. These experiments {{were carried out}} by stimulating presynaptic fibers of the perforant pathway and recording responses from a collection of postsynaptic cells of the dentate gyrus. As expected, a single pulse of electrical stimulation to fibers of the perforant pathway caused excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) in cells of the dentate gyrus. What Lømo unexpectedly observed was that the postsynaptic cells' response to these single-pulse stimuli could be enhanced {{for a long period}} of time if he first delivered a high-frequency train of stimuli to the presynaptic fibers. When such a train of stimuli was applied, subsequent single-pulse stimuli elicited stronger, prolonged EPSPs in the <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>cell</b> population. This phenomenon, whereby a high-frequency stimulus could produce a long-lived enhancement in the postsynaptic cells' response to subsequent single-pulse stimuli, was initially called [...] "long-lasting potentiation".|$|E

40|$|Fine {{temporal}} {{patterns of}} firing {{in much of}} the brain are highly irregular. In some circuits, the precise pattern of irregularity contains information beyond that contained in mean firing rates. However, the capacity of neural circuits to use this additional information for computational purposes is not well understood. Here we employ computational methods to show that an ensemble of neurons firing at a constant mean rate can induce arbitrarily chosen temporal current patterns in <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>cells.</b> If the presynaptic neurons fire with nearly uniform interspike intervals, then current patterns are sensitive to variations in spike timing. But irregular, Poisson-like firing can drive current patterns robustly, even if spike timing varies by tens of milliseconds from trial to trial. Notably, irregular firing patterns can drive useful patterns of current even if they are so variable that several hundred repeated experimental trials would be needed to distinguish them from random firing. Together, these results describe an unrestrictive set of conditions in which <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>cells</b> might exploit virtually any information contained in spike timing. We speculate as to how this capability may underlie an extension of population coding to the temporal domain...|$|R
