5000|$|Two molybdopterin cofactors bind tungsten, as {{observed}} in many related enzymes. Tungsten is not bonded {{directly to the}} protein. Phosphate centers pendant on the cofactor are bound to a Mg2+, which is also bound by Asn93 and Ala183 to complete its octahedral coordination sphere. Thus, <b>pterin</b> and Tungsten atoms {{are connected to the}} AOR enzyme primarily through pterin's Hydrogen bonding networks with the amino acid residues. In addition, two water ligands that occupy the octahedral geometry take part in hydrogen bonding networks with <b>pterin,</b> phosphate, and Mg2+. While Fe4S4 cluster is bound by four Cys ligands, <b>Pterin</b> - rich in amino and ether linkages - interacts with the Asp-X-X-Gly-Leu-(Cys/Asp) sequences in the AOR enzyme. In such sequence, Cys494 residue is also hydrogen bonded to the Fe4S4 cluster. This indicates that Cys494 residue connects the Tungsten site and the Fe4S4 cluster site in the enzyme. Iron atom in the cluster is additionally bound by three other Cystein ligands: [...] Also, another linker amino acid residue between ferredoxin cluster and <b>pterin</b> is the Arg76, which hydrogen bonds to both <b>pterin</b> and ferredoxin. It is proposed that such hydrogen bonding interactions imply <b>pterin</b> cyclic ring system as an electron carrier. Additionally the C=O center of the <b>pterin</b> binds Na+. The W=O center is proposed, not verified crystallographically.|$|E

The condensation of 5 -deoxy- and 5 -O-protected pentofuranos- 2 -uloses with 3 at pH 8 afforded 6 -substituted <b>pterins</b> as major isomers, whereas the same reaction at pH 3 yielded the 7 -substituted <b>pterins</b> predominantly...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} found that <b>pterins</b> exist in tissues of animals {{belonging}} to nearly all groups; their occurrence as pigments, however, is restricted to insects and cold-blooded vertebrates. Among Lepidoptera, they are always present in the wing-scales of the Pieridæ and appear to be a biochemical characteristic of that natural family. Becker and Schöpf and Becker also found <b>pterins</b> in the integument of Hymenoptera and gave evidence of their wide distribution within this order...|$|R
50|$|The Isay {{reaction}} is an organic reaction in which certain diaminopyrimidines are transformed into <b>pterins</b> by condensation with a 1,2-dicarbonyl compound, such as 2,3-butanedione. The {{reaction is}} named after Otto Isay.|$|R
50|$|Despite much {{research}} on the topic, cryptochrome photoreception and phototransduction in Drosophila and Arabidopsis thaliana is still poorly understood. Cryptochromes are known to possess two chromophores: <b>pterin</b> (in the form of 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolic acid (MTHF)) and flavin (in the form of FAD). Both may absorb a photon, and in Arabidopsis, <b>pterin</b> appears to absorb at a wavelength of 380 nm and flavin at 450 nm. Past studies have supported a model by which energy captured by <b>pterin</b> is transferred to flavin. Under this model of phototransduction, FAD would then be reduced to FADH, which probably mediates the phosphorylation of a certain domain in cryptochrome. This could then trigger a signal transduction chain, possibly affecting gene regulation in the cell nucleus.|$|E
50|$|Febuxostat is a non-purine-selective {{inhibitor}} of xanthine oxidase. It {{works by}} non-competitively blocking the molybdenum <b>pterin</b> center {{which is the}} active site on xanthine oxidase. Xanthine oxidase is needed to successively oxidize both hypoxanthine and xanthine to uric acid. Hence, febuxostat inhibits xanthine oxidase, therefore reducing production of uric acid. Febuxostat inhibits both oxidized as well as reduced form of xanthine oxidase because of which febuxostat cannot be easily displaced from the molybdenum <b>pterin</b> site.|$|E
5000|$|Dihydropteroate is a <b>pterin</b> {{created from}} para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) by the enzyme dihydropteroate synthase. It is an {{important}} intermediate in folate synthesis.|$|E
5000|$|Xanthine oxidase {{can also}} act on certain other purines, <b>pterins,</b> and aldehydes. For example, it {{efficiently}} converts 1-methylxanthine (a metabolite of caffeine) to 1-methyluric acid, but has little activity on 3-methylxanthine.|$|R
50|$|Enzyme {{activity}} in the layer of yellow xanthopterin granules was demonstrated to be higher in hornets kept in dark environments and lower in those exposed to UV light. Measuring the electric voltage between the hypocuticle and the exocuticle of the yellow stripe shows a negative electric potential at the hypocuticle {{with respect to the}} positive exocuticle. If the yellow stripe is exposed to light, the potential difference between light and dark conditions increases. In dark conditions, the stripe decreases in electric potential. <b>Pterins</b> have a role in photoreception and phototransduction of near-UV light to blue light and it is possible that <b>pterins</b> {{may play a role in}} photosynthesis.|$|R
40|$|The {{interaction}} between phenylalanine 4 -mono-oxygenase and analogues {{of the natural}} cofactor (6 R) -tetrahydrobiopterin [(6 R) -BH 4] was studied. The rate of cyclic AMP-dependent phosphorylation of phenylalanine 4 -mono-oxygenase was inhibited only by those <b>pterins</b> [(6 R) -BH 4, (6 S) -BH 4 and 7, 8 -dihydrobiopterin (BH 2) ] that were able to decrease the potency and efficiency of phenylalanine as an allosteric activator of the hydroxylase. Since BH 2 lacks cofactor activity, this was not required to modulate either the phosphorylation or the phenylalanine-activation of the hydroxylase. Half-maximal inhibition of the phosphorylation was observed at 1. 9 microM-(6 R) -BH 4, 9 microM-(6 S) -BH 4 and 17 microM-BH 2. Competition experiments indicated that all three <b>pterins</b> acted through binding to the cofactor site of the hydroxylase. Since the phosphorylation site and the cofactor binding site are known to reside, respectively, in the N- and C-terminal domains of the hydroxylase, the <b>pterins</b> were able to induce an interdomain conformational change. BH 2, whose dihydroxypropyl group {{is not subject to}} epimerization, and (6 S) -BH 4 both inhibited the phosphorylation less efficiently than did the (6 R) -epimer of BH 4. <b>Pterins</b> with different spatial arrangements of the dihydroxypropyl side chain thus appeared to elicit different conformations of the phosphorylation site. The hydroxylase reaction showed a higher apparent Km for (6 S) -BH 4 than for (6 R) -BH 4 both when the native and the phenylalanine-activated enzyme were tested. For the activated enzyme Vmax was 40 % lower with the (6 S) -epimer than the (6 R) -epimer, also when the more rapid enzyme inactivation occurring with the former cofactor was taken into account...|$|R
50|$|Formation and {{cleavage}} of the iron-peroxypterin bridge. Although evidence strongly supports Fe(IV)=O as the hydroxylating intermediate, the mechanistic details {{underlying the}} formation of the Fe(II)-O-O-BH4 bridge prior to heterolytic cleavage remain controversial. Two pathways have been proposed based on models that differ in the proximity of the iron to the <b>pterin</b> cofactor and the number of water molecules assumed to be iron-coordinated during catalysis. According to one model, an iron dioxygen complex is initially formed and stabilized as a resonance hybrid of Fe2+O2 and Fe3+O2−. The activated O2 then attacks BH4, forming a transition state characterized by charge separation between the electron-deficient <b>pterin</b> ring and the electron-rich dioxygen species. The Fe(II)-O-O-BH4 bridge is subsequently formed. On the other hand, formation of this bridge has been modeled assuming that BH4 is located in iron's first coordination shell and that the iron is not coordinated to any water molecules. This model predicts a different mechanism involving a <b>pterin</b> radical and superoxide as critical intermediates. Once formed, the Fe(II)-O-O-BH4 bridge is broken through heterolytic cleavage of the O-O bond to Fe(IV)=O and 4a-hydroxytetrahydrobiopterin; thus, molecular oxygen is the source of both oxygen atoms used to hydroxylate the <b>pterin</b> ring and phenylalanine.|$|E
50|$|In R. sphaeroides, DMSOR is a single-subunit, {{water-soluble}} {{protein that}} requires no additional cofactors beyond <b>pterin.</b> In E. coli, DMSOR is embedded within the membrane and has three unique subunits, {{one of which}} includes the characteristic <b>pterin</b> cofactor, another which contains four 4Fe:4S clusters, and a final transmembrane subunit that binds and oxidizes menaquinol. The transfer of an e- from menaquinol to the 4Fe:4S clusters and finally to the pterin-Mo active site generates a proton gradient used for ATP generation.|$|E
50|$|AOR {{consists}} of three domains, domain 1, 2, and 3. While domain 1 contains <b>pterin</b> bound to tungsten, the other two domains provide a channel from tungsten to protein's surface (15 Angstroms in length) {{in order to allow}} specific substrates to enter the enzyme through its channel. In the active site, this <b>pterin</b> molecules is in a saddle-like conformation (500 to the normal plane) to “sit” on the domain 1 which also takes on a form with beta sheets to accommodate the Tungsten-Pterin site.|$|E

40|$|Pteridine reductase (PTR 1) is a short-chain reductase (SDR) {{responsible}} for the salvage of <b>pterins</b> in parasitic trypanosomatids. PTR 1 catalyzes the NADPH-dependent two-step reduction of oxidized <b>pterins</b> to the active tetrahydro-forms and reduces susceptibility to antifolates by alleviating dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) inhibition. Crystal structures of PTR 1 complexed with cofactor and 7, 8 -dihydrobiopterin (DHB) or methotrexate (MTX) delineate the enzyme mechanism, broad spectrum of activity and inhibition by substrate or an antifolate. PTR 1 applies two distinct reductive mechanisms to substrates bound in one orientation. The first reduction uses the generic SDR mechanism, whereas the second shares similarities with the mechanism proposed for DHFR.

40|$|The {{ability of}} various {{structural}} analogs of tetrahydrobioptenn {{to enter the}} rat brain and remain in the reduced form after i. p. administration was tested because tetrahydrobioptenn itself en-ters poorly.

50|$|Male C. eurytheme hindwings {{demonstrate}} an ultraviolet {{reflectance pattern}} while female C. eurytheme hindwings demonstrate ultraviolet absorbing patterns. According to studies, these ultraviolet reflecting wing scales found in males also contain <b>pterin</b> pigments that absorb wavelengths below 550 nm. Although {{this may seem}} paradoxical, the <b>pterin</b> pigments {{have been found to}} decrease the amount of diffuse ultraviolet reflectance that comes from the wing scales. By suppressing the diffuse ultraviolet reflectance, the directionality and spectral purity of the iridescence is heightened. In addition, the presence of the <b>pterin</b> pigments increases the signal's chromaticity and potential signal content, suggesting that these pigments are responsible for amplifying the contrast between ultraviolet reflectance and background colors as a male's wings move during flight. Further studies have found that the ultraviolet reflectance signal is brightest within a wing beat cycle when viewed from directly above the male. This supports the idea that male wing color should be able to be readily distinguished from that of females and the visual background that consists mostly of UV-absorbing vegetation.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{describe}} three unrelated {{children with}} a distinctive variant of Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS) characterized by microcephaly, severe mental and motor retardation, dyskinesia or spasticity, and occasional seizures. Results: Neuroimaging showed bilateral calcification of basal ganglia and white matter. CSF glucose, protein, cell count, and interferon alpha were normal. Abnormal CSF findings included extremely high neopterin (293 to 814 nmol/L; normal 12 to 30 nmol/L) and biopterin (226 to 416 nmol/L; normal 15 to 40 nmol/L) combined with lowered 5 -methyltetrahydrofolate (23 to 48 nmol/L; normal 64 to 182 nmol/L) concentrations in two patients. The absence of pleocytosis and normal CSF interferon alpha was a characteristic finding compared to the classic AGS syndrome. Genetic and enzymatic tests excluded disorders of tetrahydrobiopterin metabolism, including mutation analysis of GTP cyclohydrolase feed-back regulatory protein. CSF investigations in three patients with classic AGS also showed increased <b>pterins</b> and partially lowered folate levels. Conclusions: Intrathecal overproduction of <b>pterins</b> is the first biochemical abnormality identified in patients with AGS variants. Long-term substitution with folinic acid (2 - 4 mg/kg/day) resulted in substantial clinical recovery with normalization of CSF folates and <b>pterins</b> in one patient and clinical improvement in another.
