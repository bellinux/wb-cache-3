5|$|The {{majority}} of the European population before industrialization lived in rural communities or isolated farms and households. The norm was self-sufficiency with only a small <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> being exported or sold in markets. Large towns were exceptions and required their surrounding hinterlands to support them with food and fuel. The dense urban population could support {{a wide variety of}} food establishments that catered to various social groups. Many of the poor city dwellers had to live in cramped conditions without access to a kitchen or even a hearth, and many did not own the equipment for basic cooking. Food from vendors was in such cases the only option. Cookshops could either sell ready-made hot food, an early form of fast food, or offer cooking services while the customers supplied {{some or all of the}} ingredients. Travellers, such as pilgrims en route to a holy site, made use of professional cooks to avoid having to carry their provisions with them. For the more affluent, there were many types of specialist that could supply various foods and condiments: cheesemongers, pie bakers, saucers, waferers, etc. Well-off citizens who had the means to cook at home could on special occasions hire professionals when their own kitchen or staff could not handle the burden of throwing a major banquet.|$|E
25|$|Numerous {{records of}} {{government}} tax collection in Europe {{since at least}} the 17th century are still available today. But taxation levels are hard to compare to the size and flow of the economy since production numbers are not as readily available. Government expenditures and revenue in France during the 17th century went from about 24.30 million livres in 1600–10 to about 126.86 million livres in 1650–59 to about 117.99 million livres in 1700–10 when government debt had reached 1.6 billion livres. In 1780–89, it reached 421.50 million livres. Taxation as a <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> of final goods may have reached 15–20% during the 17th century in places such as France, the Netherlands, and Scandinavia. During the war-filled years of the eighteenth and early nineteenth century, tax rates in Europe increased dramatically as war became more expensive and governments became more centralized and adept at gathering taxes. This increase was greatest in England, Peter Mathias and Patrick O'Brien found that the tax burden increased by 85% over this period. Another study confirmed this number, finding that per capita tax revenues had grown almost sixfold over the eighteenth century, but that steady economic growth had made the real burden on each individual only double over this period before the industrial revolution. Effective tax rates were higher in Britain than France the years before the French Revolution, twice in per capita income comparison, but they were mostly placed on international trade. In France, taxes were lower but the burden was mainly on landowners, individuals, and internal trade and thus created far more resentment.|$|E

50|$|The company {{operates}} a unique business model: instead of committing a large <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> {{for the next}} fashion season, the company commits a small amount and uses customer feedback and an efficient production network to replenish stores with new and different products weekly.

40|$|Financial theory {{offers an}} array of {{explanations}} for corporate hedging. However, financial economists have not reached any definitive conclusions regarding whether corporations 2 ̆ 7 hedging policies are consistent with theory. To examine this question, this study uses a database of the risk management activities of one-hundred oil and gas producers. For the years 1992 - 1994, I empirically investigate the influence of financing policy, tax structure, operating technology, compensation policy, and ownership structure on hedging policy. ^ I find that a company 2 ̆ 7 s hedging policy is significantly linked to its capital structure. The <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> hedged is strongly positively correlated with the ratio of total debt-to-total assets. Likewise, I find that companies that retain cash instead of paying dividends and companies with unrated debt hedge a greater <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>production.</b> In addition, after controlling for factors that influence the likelihood of hedging, smaller firms hedge more extensively. The {{results are consistent with}} what I label the 2 ̆ 2 underinvestment 2 ̆ 2, 2 ̆ 2 probability of financial distress 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 financing and investment coordination 2 ̆ 2 hypotheses. Collectively, these results suggest that hedging serves to alleviate financial contracting costs. ^ Additionally, consistent with the predictions of 2 ̆ 2 managerial risk aversion 2 ̆ 2 hypothesis and Tufano (1996), I find an inverse relationship between the extent that corporations hedge and their use of performance-contingent managerial compensation. Variables pertaining to the number of options held by managers, the ratio of stock option pay-to-cash salary and bonus, and the use of a stock option plan are all significantly negatively related to the <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> hedged. ^ Although a company 2 ̆ 7 s hedging policy is strongly correlated with its compensation policy, I find no evidence of a positive relation between the <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> hedged and managerial ownership. The results provide no evidence that a company 2 ̆ 7 s tax structure or operating technology influences its hedging policies. ...|$|E
