5|$|The Pirates {{have failed}} once in signing a draft <b>pick.</b> <b>This</b> {{occurred}} in 2012, when the Pirates selected RHP Mark Appel from Stanford University, who sought a significant bonus which, {{according to new}} MLB rules, would have cost the Pirates a future draft pick. The Pirates will receive the 9th overall pick in the 2013 draft for their failure to sign Appel.|$|E
5|$|The 2007 Draft {{marked the}} first time three players drafted in the top 10 came from the same school: the University of Florida. Florida, the 2007 National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Basketball champion, tied the record set by the University of Connecticut in 2006 with five players {{selected}} in the first two rounds of an NBA draft. Florida joined nine other schools, including Connecticut, that had five players selected in an NBA draft, second only to UNLV, which had six players selected in the eighth-round 1977 draft. Five players who competed in the 2007 NCAA Basketball National Championship Final were selected in the top 10; three players came from Florida, and two players came from the runner-up, Ohio State University. This draft also set the record number of freshmen drafted in the first round when eight freshmen were selected. Of the 60 players drafted, eight were freshmen, five were sophomores, 14 were juniors, 20 were seniors, and 13 were international players without U.S. college basketball experience. The Cleveland Cavaliers, Denver Nuggets, Indiana Pacers and Toronto Raptors all did not have a draft <b>pick</b> <b>this</b> year, although Indiana and Toronto each acquired a drafted player's rights after the draft.|$|E
25|$|On June 30, 2003 Mark Messier's {{rights were}} {{traded to the}} San Jose Sharks for a fourth round draft <b>pick.</b> <b>This</b> draft pick ended up being used to select Rochester, NY native and future Rangers captain Ryan Callahan. The Sharks held his rights {{for just a few}} hours as soon he re-signed with the Rangers as a free agent.|$|E

25|$|In the off season, the Kings were {{involved}} in the controversial three-way-team trade with Coca-Cola and Air21. The first part of the trade saw the Express sending Ryan Bernardo and its 2007 and 2008 first-round draft picks to the Tigers for Rafi Reavis, Billy Mamaril and the rights to Rudy Hatfield. The second part sent Reavis, Mamaril and Hatfield's rights from the Express to the Kings for Kalani Ferreria, Aries Dimaunahan, Manny Ramos, and Ervin Sotto plus Ginebra's two second round draft picks that year and a future first-round pick. The third part was voided by former commissioner Noli Eala, which would have allowed the Express to regain its own 2007 and 2008 picks plus the Tigers' 2008 second round draft pick from Coke, in exchange for Ferreria and Ramos plus the second-round <b>pick</b> <b>this</b> year and the future first-round pick. Air21 and Coca-Cola submitted a revised version of that part of the trade and was approved by Eala.|$|E
500|$|On February 21, 2017, the Lakers fired {{general manager}} Mitch Kupchak, while Magic Johnson was named as the {{president}} of basketball operations. The team's governor Jeanie Buss, also announced the removal of her brother, Jim Buss, from his position as executive vice president of basketball operations. [...] On March 7, 2017, the Lakers hired Rob Pelinka as the general manager, signing him to a five-year deal. The Lakers again earned the second overall <b>pick,</b> <b>this</b> time, in the 2017 NBA draft, and selected Lonzo Ball from UCLA.|$|E

Butterfield felt that the dungeon {{was not an easy}} challenge, especially with the strong and numerous monsters (such as the roughly eighty trolls on one level). In conclusion, he stated, [...] "I advise all DMs who are looking for an exciting, worthwhile adventure for their players to <b>pick</b> <b>this</b> one up. You won't be disappointed." ...|$|E

500|$|Among the disappointments {{during the}} early years of the resurrected Senators was Alexandre Daigle, the number one overall pick in the 1993 NHL Entry Draft. During the 1992–93 season, it had become clear that Daigle would be the number one pick. The Quebec Nordiques {{publicly}} announced that they would trade several players for him, as they wished to build a new arena and needed a marquee francophone player. As the season progressed, both the Senators and the San Jose Sharks were neck-and-neck in last place, and at that time, NHL rules meant the worst team would receive the first overall <b>pick.</b> <b>This</b> [...] "competition" [...] was variously dubbed the [...] "Daigle Cup" [...] and the [...] "Yelnats Puc." ...|$|E
500|$|New Noise Magazines Joseph Tucker said, [...] "The {{score on}} this record is {{incredibly}} diverse and of equally incredible quality, unlike so many others. <b>Pick</b> <b>this</b> up {{before or after}} you go and see Dallas Buyers Club." [...] Matt of Homo Razzi said about the album, [...] "Overall this soundtrack {{has a little bit}} of everything and it works perfectly, mirroring some of the themes, emotions and moments of the film." [...] Stephanie Ochona reviewed for Renowned for Sound and gave the soundtrack 4.5 out of 5 ratings, she said, [...] "Set in the 80s where drugs and other experimentation was all the rage, music plays a big factor in the entire atmosphere of the movie. The soundtrack includes a diverse group of artists, from country stars, indie icons and modern rockers. All the songs featured help bring out the kind of mood a movie like Dallas Buyers Club is." [...] Ochona also said that, [...] "Without such an accurate soundtrack, the film wouldn't have made such a big impact, and both the visual and aural aspects work together to create a beautiful story of a man fighting for the right to live his life." ...|$|E

2500|$|Evelyn Pettigano, {{who lost}} a sister, said: [...] "I don't like it. I'm not prejudiced ... It's {{too close to the}} area where our family members were murdered." [...] Dov Shefi, whose son Haggai was killed, said: [...] "the {{establishment}} of a mosque in this place ... is like bringing a pig into the Holy Temple. It is inconceivable that in all the city of New York, this site was specifically chosen."

2500|$|The overall {{reception}} of Art of Conquest was lukewarm. GameRankings averaged it at 66%, and Metacritic averaged it slightly lower, at 63%. IGN, {{who gave it}} a 7.8 out of 10, stated [...] "While it's a solid game, there's just not enough here to compel me to reawaken the substantial addiction the first game generated. Whether or not it's worth it for you to <b>pick</b> <b>this</b> one up depends almost entirely {{on how much you}} enjoyed the original game. With so few significant changes it plays almost exactly the same. For those who couldn't get enough of Empire Earth, the expansion should be a perfect fit. Just don't expect the breadth and scope of the first game." [...] Finally, GameSpot gave it a 5.2 out of 10, and said [...] "Ultimately, The Art of Conquest doesn't add enough to make much of a difference." [...] A notable criticism from GameSpot was regarding the way Space was implemented in the game. Spaceships were only available on certain maps and the gameplay was very similar to water—a dock-type building is built and spaceships travel much like naval ships. Other reviewers found fault with the game's price of 30 USD. The IGN reviewer said [...] "I like Art of Conquest enough but it just falls short of being worth the $30 price tag." ...|$|E
2500|$|One {{reason for}} Arizona's success was the re-emergence of 37-year-old quarterback Kurt Warner. [...] After going undrafted and {{spending}} a few years in the Arena Football League, Warner became the St. Louis Rams starting quarterback in 1999 due to a pre-season injury of starter Trent Green. [...] He went on to lead the Rams to two Super Bowls and one Super Bowl win (in which Warner was named MVP), while also winning two NFL MVP Awards. [...] But in 2002, Warner's production was drastically reduced by injuries and he soon lost his starting job to Marc Bulger. He eventually left the team to join the New York Giants, but once again he lost his starting job (replaced by Eli Manning) and signed on with the Cardinals in 2005. For the third time, Warner lost his starting job due to mediocre performances and injuries. After the season, Arizona selected Heisman Trophy winning quarterback Matt Leinart with their first round draft <b>pick.</b> <b>This,</b> combined with another mediocre performance in the 2006 season, appeared to severely limit Warner's chances of ever being a permanent starter on the team. However, early in the 2007 season, Warner was thrust into the starting lineup to replace an injured Leinart, {{and by the end}} of the team's season, he had re-emerged as one of the top quarterbacks in the league, throwing 27 touchdown passes with a passer rating of 89.8.|$|E

After the camp was formed they walked about, like barn-door fowls, picking up any scraps of food that were thrown to them, and indeed getting so bold as sometimes to attempt to snatch it from the men's hands.
