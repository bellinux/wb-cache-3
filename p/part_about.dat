The episode featured the musical group R.E.M., who appeared as themselves. It received mixed reviews from critics following the thirteenth season's release on DVD and Blu-ray.|$|E
5|$|December 44 Museum, La Gleize, Belgium. A cosmetically {{restored}} Tiger II (production turret) Hull number 280273, {{built in}} October 1944. Turret number 213 from s.SS Pz.Abt 501. Displayed {{at the entrance}} to DECEMBER 44 MUSEUM Collections, a museum devoted entirely to the Battle of the Bulge. This tank was abandoned in La Gleize on 24 December 1944, where the advance of Kampfgruppe Peiper was halted. The front <b>part,</b> <b>about</b> 1/3, of the gun barrel is restored with a Panther gun barrel and muzzle brake. It also has restored mudguards. It is stripped of exterior and internal fittings and most of the torsion bars are broken, but it still has its gearbox and engine in place.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the twelfth}} century, {{education}} within the Byzantine Greek population was {{more advanced than}} in the West, particularly at primary school level, resulting in comparatively high literacy rates. Success came easily to Byzantine Greek merchants, who enjoyed a very strong position in international trade. Despite the challenges posed by rival Italian merchants, they held their own throughout {{the latter half of}} the Byzantine Empire's existence. The clergy also held a special place, not only having more freedom than their Western counterparts, but also maintaining a patriarch in Constantinople who was considered the equal of the pope. This position of strength had built up over time, for at the beginning of the Byzantine Empire, under Emperor Constantine the Great (r. 306–337), only a small <b>part,</b> <b>about</b> 10%, of the population was Christian.|$|E

5|$|Astronomical {{observations}} of the cosmological expansion rate allow {{the total amount of}} matter in the universe to be estimated, although the nature of that matter remains mysterious in <b>part.</b> <b>About</b> 90% of all matter appears to be dark matter, which has mass (or, equivalently, gravitational influence), but does not interact electromagnetically and, hence, cannot be observed directly. There is no generally accepted description of this new kind of matter, within the framework of known particle physics or otherwise. Observational evidence from redshift surveys of distant supernovae and measurements of the cosmic background radiation also show that the evolution of our universe is significantly influenced by a cosmological constant resulting in an acceleration of cosmic expansion or, equivalently, by a form of energy with an unusual equation of state, known as dark energy, the nature of which remains unclear.|$|E
5|$|Douglas's most {{important}} patrons were the Grosvenor family of Eaton Hall, Cheshire. In 1865 he was commissioned {{to design the}} entrance lodge and other structures for Grosvenor Park in Chester, and StJohn's Church {{in the village of}} Aldford in the Eaton Hall estate for Richard Grosvenor, 2nd Marquess of Westminster. When the marquess died in 1869 he was succeeded by his son Hugh Grosvenor, 1stDuke of Westminster. Douglas received a large number of commissions from the 1st Duke and from his son, the 2nd Duke, throughout his career. It is estimated that for the 1stDuke alone he designed four churches and chapels, eight parsonages and large houses, about 15schools, around 50farms (in whole or in <b>part),</b> <b>about</b> 300cottages, lodges and smithies, two factories, two inns and about 12commercial buildings on the Eaton Hall estate alone. He also designed buildings on the duke's Halkyn estate in Flintshire, including another church.|$|E
5|$|On {{designing}} the battle system, Kitao {{said that his}} two main aims were creating something never before seen in an RPG and designing something accessible yet challenging. Adjustments to the battle system went on all through development, with some changes being made {{at the very last}} minute. The gun customization system was originally a puzzle-based system, but was later converted to a diagram set-up. Weapons were originally going to be represented in three-dimensions, but technical issues prevented this. On the whole, the development was a taxing one for him. The most difficult <b>part</b> <b>about</b> incorporating guns into the system was creating a workable system that did not rely on first-person and third-person shooter mechanics. The two types of damage and various special moves in the game were born from the team's discussions about how the three playable characters might be directed to work in unison, dealing different types of attacks. Being able to attack while moving was inspired by a suggestion from staff members stemming from more traditional action games and scenes from Hollywood action films. For the camera, the team decided to balance it between limited control during player turns and a more dynamic feel during attacks.|$|E

The most common method of discovering nests is giving a piece of frog or fish meat attached to a cotton ball to a wasp and following it back to its nest. With V. mandarinia, this is particularly difficult considering its common home flight radius of 1–2km. V. mandarinia travels up to 8km away from the nest.|$|E
25|$|The greater <b>part</b> (<b>about</b> 58%) of the Lüneburg Heath Nature Reserve {{consists}} of woods, primarily pine forests, which were {{planted in the}} second half of the 19th century on former heathland and drifting sand. In some cases the dunes simply became naturally overgrown, again with pines. There are only a very few old stands of sessile oaks, which stem from the logging industry during the time of the Kingdom of Hanover. In many parts of the nature reserve there are so-called Stühbüsche (a form of coppice), trees that were coppiced by repeatedly being cut short. In the meantime they have grown wild again and have a characteristic and unusual appearance with their multiple trunks. Near Wilsede there is the remnant of a Hutewald, a wood pasture with giant, multi-stemmed beech trees.|$|E
25|$|The Longhorns {{came into}} Lincoln, Nebraska as the 16th {{best team in}} the country and one year removed from being in the College World Series. The Longhorns were the heavy {{favorite}} heading into the weekend series but found themselves down in the series after being defeated Friday night by the Huskers. In front of a crowd of 5,852, the Husker's made history. The Husker pitching staff combined for 19 strikeouts, 3 walks, 4 hits, 210 pitches thrown and 15 innings of work. The impressive <b>part</b> <b>about</b> this stat line wouldn't of even been noticed unless you attended the game. The Husker pitching staff threw 9 innings of no-hit baseball during this 15 inning marathon. From the 4th inning to the 14th inning, the Longhorns were unable to record a single hit off the Husker pitching staff of Kyle Kubat, Jake Hohensee, Colton Howell and Jeff Chesnut. These four pitchers were honored with the Louisville Slugger National Players of the week award; {{for the first time in}} NCAA history, this award was given to four pitchers from the same school, in the same week.

25|$|Due to {{the varying}} {{accounts}} and hadiths on {{the collection and}} canonization of the Quran, some scholars debate whether the 'Uthmanic text comprehends the entire body of material that was revealed to Muhammad, or {{if there has been}} material that is missing from the 'Uthmanic text. For example, some Sunni literature contains reports that suggest that some of the revelations had already been lost before the collection of the Quran initiated by Abu Bakr. In one version of a report at the time, 'Umar was once looking for the text of a specific verse of the Quran on stoning as a punishment for adultery, which he remembered. Later, he discovered that the only person who had any record of that verse had been killed in the battle of Yamama and as a result the verse was lost. Later, some of the Companions recalled that same verse, one person being 'A'isha, Muhammad's youngest wife. She is believed to have said that a sheet on which two verses, including the one on stoning, were under her bedding and that after Muhammad died, a domestic animal got into the room and gobbled up the sheet. Experts on hadith literature have rejected this hadith, as all routes of transmission either contain narrators charged with dishonesty in disclosing sources or simply conflict with the majority version of the report, which all have authentic routes of transmission but omit the <b>part</b> <b>about</b> the piece of paper being eaten.|$|E
25|$|At Sacrifice, Daniels and Kazarian cost Styles his {{match against}} Kurt Angle, who however saved Styles from a beatdown. On May 31, Styles {{defeated}} Daniels {{in the main}} event of Impact Wrestlig, after which Daniels and Kazarian played audio of a phone conversation to prove an affair between Styles and Carter. At Slammiversary, Styles and Angle defeated Daniels and Kazarian to win their TNA World Tag Team Championship. On the following episode of Impact Wrestlig, Styles entered the 2012 Bound for Glory Series, where he was eliminated in opening gauntlet match by Daniels. On the June 21 episode of Impact Wrestling, Styles and Carter revealed their secret – they were not having an affair, but were helping an addicted pregnant woman named Claire Lynch overcome her problems. The following week on Impact Wrestling, Styles and Angle lost the TNA World Tag Team Championship back to Daniels and Kazarian, after which Daniels admitted that Styles and Carter had told the truth about Claire, but claimed that they had left out the <b>part</b> <b>about</b> Styles being {{the father of her}} unborn baby. Styles defeated Daniels in a Last Man Standing match at Destination X, and again in a Bound for Glory Series match and, per the pre-match stipulations, earned the right to get a paternity test on Claire's baby. The following week on Impact Wrestling it was revealed that Claire was not pregnant after all and her attorney revealed Daniels' and Kazarian's plot to blackmail Styles.|$|E
25|$|The tension {{resulted}} in a fallout between Chappell and Ganguly lead to a confidential email sent by Chappell to the BCCI being leaked, in which he condemned the leadership and performance of Ganguly. After a series of high-profile board meetings and public jousting including some players, Rahul Dravid was installed as the captain, triggering a revival in the team's fortunes. The Indians subsequently defeated Sri Lanka 6-1 in a home series. An important <b>part</b> <b>about</b> this series was {{the discovery of the}} young talent of the team, including Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Suresh Raina, Gautam Gambhir and Irfan Pathan. The team also beat the Sri Lankans in the Test series 2-0 to displace England from its position in second place in the ICC Test rankings, but India slipped back by losing the high-profile series to Pakistan. Indian team continued its good form in ODIs, beating Pakistan 4-1 in Pakistan. India achieved the world-record of winning 17 successive matches chasing the total. India convincingly won England's tour of India winning the series 5-1. After leveling the DLF Cup series 1-1 in Abu Dhabi, India travelled to West Indies where they lost the ODI series 1-4 to a weak West Indies team which was ranked 8th in the ICC ODI Ranking. The series loss again questioned the Indian team's ability to play away from the Sub-continent and the chances of the Indian team to win the 2007 Cricket World Cup. The Indian team later clinched the Test series against West Indies 1-0, the first Indian series win in the Caribbean since 1989. For the statistics of Indian cricket team after 2011 world cup, watch Indian cricket from 2011. Recently the Indian Cricket team has beaten the Australian cricket team with an impressive 2-1 victory in the 2017 Border-Gavaskar trophy and England by 4-0 in the 2016-17 Antony De Mello Trophy in the 5 match test series.|$|E
