5|$|As Sylvester himself observed, Sylvester's {{sequence}} {{seems to}} be unique in having such quickly growing values, while simultaneously having a series of reciprocals that converges to a rational number. This sequence <b>provides</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> showing that double-exponential growth {{is not enough to}} cause an integer sequence to be an irrationality sequence.|$|E
5|$|As {{pointed out}} by Paul Krugman, the Brander–Spencer model, due to the {{sensitivity}} of the results to its assumptions, does not establish a generally applicable policy prescription in favor of government subsidies. Rather, it <b>provides</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> for when such intervention may be justifiable and points to some conditions which may favor it.|$|E
5|$|Every {{configuration}} of Rule 90 has exactly four predecessors, other configurations {{that form the}} given configuration after a single step. Therefore, in contrast to many other cellular automata such as Conway's Game of Life, Rule 90 has no Garden of Eden, a configuration with no predecessors. It <b>provides</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> of a cellular automaton that is surjective (each configuration has a predecessor) but not injective (it has sets {{of more than one}} configuration with the same successor), showing that the converse of the Garden of Eden theorem is not true.|$|E

5|$|The {{fact that}} every {{configuration}} has a predecessor may be summarized {{by saying that}} Rule 90 is surjective. The function that maps each configuration to its successor is, mathematically, a surjective function. Rule 90 is also not injective. In an injective rule, every two different configurations have different successors, but Rule 90 has pairs of configurations with the same successor. Rule 90 <b>provides</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> of a cellular automaton that is surjective but not injective. The Garden of Eden theorem of Moore and Myhill implies that every injective cellular automaton must be surjective, but this example shows that the converse is not true.|$|E
5|$|The work of George Akerlof and Janet Yellen on {{efficiency}} wages {{based on}} notions of fairness <b>provides</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> of a feminist model of economic actors. In their work, agents are not hyperrational or isolated, but instead act in concert and with fairness, {{are capable of}} experiencing jealousy, and are interested in personal relationships. This work is based on empirical sociology and psychology, and suggests that wages can be influenced by fairness considerations rather than purely market forces.|$|E
5|$|In {{computational}} complexity theory, 2-satisfiability <b>provides</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> of an NL-complete problem, {{one that}} can be solved non-deterministically using a logarithmic amount of storage and that is among the hardest of the problems solvable in this resource bound. The set of all solutions to a 2-satisfiability instance can be given the structure of a median graph, but counting these solutions is #P-complete and therefore not expected to have a polynomial-time solution. Random instances undergo a sharp phase transition from solvable to unsolvable instances as the ratio of constraints to variables increases past 1, a phenomenon conjectured but unproven for more complicated forms of the satisfiability problem. A computationally difficult variation of 2-satisfiability, finding a truth assignment that maximizes the number of satisfied constraints, has an approximation algorithm whose optimality depends on the unique games conjecture, and another difficult variation, finding a satisfying assignment minimizing the number of true variables, is an important test case for parameterized complexity.|$|E

5|$|People have {{struggled}} to live in deserts and the surrounding semi-arid lands for millennia. Nomads have moved their flocks and herds to wherever grazing is available and oases have provided opportunities for a more settled way of life. The cultivation of semi-arid regions encourages erosion of soil {{and is one of}} the causes of increased desertification. Desert farming is possible with the aid of irrigation and the Imperial Valley in California <b>provides</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> of how previously barren land can be made productive by the import of water from an outside source. Many trade routes have been forged across deserts, especially across the Sahara Desert, and traditionally were used by caravans of camels carrying salt, gold, ivory and other goods. Large numbers of slaves were also taken northwards across the Sahara. Some mineral extraction also takes place in deserts and the uninterrupted sunlight gives potential for the capture of large quantities of solar energy.|$|E
