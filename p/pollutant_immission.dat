Information concerning the percentage of total emissions in the stratosphere was obtained by analyzing computer flight plans, prepared by a central computer before each flight. In the process, special attention was to be paid to any influences of the seasons, different flight routes and aircraft types. After evaluation of the flight plans provided by various airlines, different influences of the season, flight route and aircraft type were found. The geographical location of the flight route has the highest impact on <b>pollutant</b> <b>immission</b> into the stratosphere. The farther north a flight route runs, the higher is the percentage of emissions. In addition to this, one can establish that beyond a certain geographical latitude the stratosphere is penetrated by no pollutants at all. Another import factor that influences fuel consumption above the tropopause is the seasonal variation of the boundary layer between the troposphere and the stratosphere. Using the results obtained under the present study and taking into account the air traffic data of international organizations such as ICAO and Eurocontrol the global load of the stratosphere is projected at another point within the joint program. In an international cooperation, an attempt should be made to cover more flight regions, such the American and Russian domestic air spaces, with stratospheric pollution data. (orig.)

40|$|<b>Pollutants</b> <b>immission</b> episodes are {{monitored}} in a {{semi-rural area}} of Belgium. The {{responsibility for the}} episodes is attributed to more or less distant industrial zones. Sulfur dioxide to sulfate conversion is studied {{as a function of}} transfer duration between the industrial sources and the immission site. Ambient temperatures, mixing heights and deposition velocities seem to be the main parameters likely to influence the conversion rates which have been estimated at 0. 020 h/sup - 1 / at 0 degrees C up to 0. 040 h/sup - 1 / at 20 degrees C, with a global activation of 5. 7 kcal. mole/sup - 1 /.

40|$|The urban {{wastewater}} system (sewer {{and treatment}} plant) {{has a major}} impact on the river water quality of urban streams. To minimise this impact, real time control is a valuable option. Since the ultimate goal of any control strategy is to optimise the quality of the river system, it is useful to take <b>pollutant</b> <b>immissions</b> into account when determining the control strategy and/or the setpoints of the controller. However, a simultaneously simulating model of the complete system is needed in order to allow design and evaluation of such control strategies. In this work an integrated model of the urban wastewater system is created. This has been accomplished by implementing surrogate models of the three subsystems within a single software platform. The coupled submodels are subsequently used in a semi-hypothetical case study to optimise the resulting river water quality. An ammonia sensor in the river has been used to control the amount of water treated biologically in the treatmen [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Behaviouristic {{models of}} the {{immission}} of particulate matter PM 10 have been analysed in this paper. One-dimensional models based on an assumption of linear dependence of the particulate matter PM 10 immission on the nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide immissions have been examined. Results of an empirical survey of <b>pollutant</b> <b>immissions,</b> carried out at the "Warszawa-Komunikacyjna" air quality monitoring station in Warsaw at Al. Niepodległości, {{have been used to}} identify the model coefficients. The model coefficients have been identified for sets covering the measurement results taken for the whole year and individual months. As a result of the examination carried out, strong correlation between the sets examined as well as significant non. repeatability of both the coefficients of correlation of the sets examined and the model coefficients have been revealed. It has been ascertained that the identification of behaviouristic {{models of the}} particulate matter PM 10 immission must be statistically treated for the categories describing the properties of pollutant emission sources and the pollutant dissemination conditions.

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} the external {{effects of the}} parent's decisions {{on the number of}} newly born children and the firm's decisions on the amount of polluting emissions that occur in industrial production. We employ an optimal control model which comprises three stock variables representing population, the economic capital stock and the <b>pollutant</b> <b>immissions</b> in the natural environment. We distinguish two different types of households, in which the decision on the number of births takes place. These two types may be regarded as two extremes: dynastic households, in which the family sticks together forever and micro-households, in which children leave their parent's household immediately after birth. We conclude that in both cases the decentralized outcome is not optimal due to two externalities: one occurs in the individual decision on polluting emissions, the other one in the individual decision on the number of births. It turns out that whereas the environmental externality is of the same form in both cases, the type of external effect from the household's decision on fertility is qualitatively different. The different types of population externalities require different policy instruments in order to internalize them. We discuss a Pigouvian tax on emissions as well as taxes on population: if an appropriate tax on the household size is applied in the case of dynastic households and an appropriate tax on children is applied in the case of small households a first best development of the economy is obtained. sustainability, endogenous fertility, externalities...|$|R
