The current density images give the {{magnitude}} of the current, while the current peak images reveal the current path with a ± 3 μm resolution.

The critical step is to overlay the SSM current images or current path images with CAD files such as bonding diagrams or RTX images to pinpoint the faultlocation. To make alignment of overlaying possible, an optical two-point reference alignment is made. The package edge andpackage fiducial are the most convenient package markings to align to.

40|$|In recent years, with {{increasing}} demand for high-density assembly in mobile electronics products, a package-on-package (PoP) structure has been standardized. The demand for lowering the PoP profile is getting stronger as consumers demand thinner mobile devices. To assemble {{a low profile}} PoP and mount it on a mother board, {{it is necessary to}} have a precise warpage control of PoP components, including its bottom package. It is expected that a flip-chip chip-scale-package (FCCSP) with thin mold cap will be used as the bottom package of the PoP in the next 2 - 3 years. In order to control the package warpage, it is necessary to optimize a large number of parameters related to the <b>package</b> <b>substrate,</b> silicon die and mold compound. Among them, equivalent coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of the <b>package</b> <b>substrate</b> {{is one of the most}} important factors. In this paper, control of the package warpage was studied by focusing on the glass-cloth content ratio in the <b>package</b> <b>substrate.</b> Glass-cloth has the lowest CTE among the constituent materials of the substrate, so it contributes to reduce the equivalent CTE of the substrate. To maximize the glass-cloth content, a substrate with a thick core and thin build-up structure was prepared, and the package with thin mold cap was subsequently formed. Compared with a similar package with a conventional substrate structure, its warpage, measured experimentally, was about 20 % smaller. Consequently, it was concluded that the glass-cloth content ratio is a key factor to control package warpage behavior in the PoP assembly process...|$|E
