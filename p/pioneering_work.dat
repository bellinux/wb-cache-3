5|$|Another {{area where}} the Antiquary led was in {{recording}} folklore and folktales.

5|$|Aside from dancewear and conventions, {{developments}} in agency representation occurred as well. Although limited, representation for individual dancers had existed since the 1980s {{at the beginning}} of the music video era due to the <b>pioneering</b> <b>work</b> of talent agent Julie McDonald. However, the UK-based dance agencies ProDance and Superbad Talent were created to exclusively represent street dancers.|$|E

5|$|As {{part of the}} summit, {{the winners}} of the first Kavli Prizes were {{announced}} in a simulcast linking New York City and Oslo. The first Kavli Prize for astrophysics was awarded to Maarten Schmidt and Donald Lynden-Bell for their <b>pioneering</b> <b>work</b> on quasars. Louis E.

5|$|During the 1930s, the {{orchestra}} became {{renowned for its}} high standard of playing and for performing new and unfamiliar music. The <b>pioneering</b> <b>work</b> of Boult and the BBC SO included an early performance of Schoenberg's Variations, Op. 31, British premieres, including Berg's Wozzeck and Three Movements from the Lyric Suite, and world premieres, including Vaughan Williams's Symphony No. 4 in F minor. Anton Webern conducted eight BBC SO concerts between 1931 and 1936.|$|E
5|$|E. O. Wilson is an American biologist, specialising in {{the study}} of ants, social insects on which he is the world's leading expert. He is known also for his <b>pioneering</b> <b>work</b> on island biogeography, which relates species {{richness}} to island size, an important consideration in nature conservation. Wilson however favours group selection over the Neo-Darwinian kin selection as an explanation of co-operation in social animals.|$|E
5|$|Harold Clayton Urey (April 29, 1893 – January 5, 1981) was an American {{physical}} chemist whose <b>pioneering</b> <b>work</b> on isotopes {{earned him the}} Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1934 for the discovery of deuterium.

5|$|QED {{has served}} as the model and {{template}} for all subsequent quantum field theories. One such subsequent theory is quantum chromodynamics, which began in the early 1960s and attained its present form in the 1970s work by H. David Politzer, Sidney Coleman, David Gross and Frank Wilczek. Building on the <b>pioneering</b> <b>work</b> of Schwinger, Gerald Guralnik, Dick Hagen, and Tom Kibble, Peter Higgs, Jeffrey Goldstone, and others, Sheldon Glashow, Steven Weinberg and Abdus Salam independently showed how the weak nuclear force and quantum electrodynamics could be merged into a single electroweak force.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the famous}} names {{associated}} with Bristol in this early period is Paul Dirac, who graduated in 1921 {{with a degree}} in engineering, before obtaining a second degree in mathematics in 1923 from Cambridge. For his subsequent <b>pioneering</b> <b>work</b> on quantum mechanics, he was awarded the 1933 Nobel Prize for Physics. Later in the 1920s, the H.H. Wills Physics Laboratory was opened by Ernest Rutherford. It has since housed several Nobel Prize winners: Cecil Frank Powell (1950); Hans Albrecht Bethe (1967); and Sir Nevill Francis Mott (1977). The Laboratory stands on the same site today, close to the Bristol Grammar School and the city museum.|$|E

5|$|Frances Elizabeth Somerville Alexander (née Caldwell; 13 December 1908 – 15 October 1958) was a British geologist, academic, and physicist, whose wartime {{work with}} radar and radio led to early {{developments}} in radio astronomy. Alexander earned her PhD from Newnham College, Cambridge, {{and worked in}} Radio Direction Finding at Singapore Naval Base from 1938 to 1941. In January 1941, unable to return to Singapore from New Zealand, she became Head of Operations Research in New Zealand's Radio Development Lab, Wellington. In 1945, Alexander correctly interpreted that anomalous radar signals picked up on Norfolk Island were caused by the sun. This interpretation became <b>pioneering</b> <b>work</b> {{in the field of}} radio astronomy, making her one of the first women scientists to work in that field, albeit briefly.|$|E
5|$|Generally {{seen as a}} <b>pioneering</b> <b>work</b> of zoology, Aristotle frames {{his text}} by {{explaining}} that he is investigating the what (the existing facts about animals) prior to establishing the why (the causes of these characteristics). The book is thus an attempt to apply philosophy to {{part of the natural}} world. Throughout the work, Aristotle seeks to identify differences, both between individuals and between groups. A group is established when it is seen that all members have the same set of distinguishing features; for example, that all birds have feathers, wings, and beaks. This relationship between the birds and their features is recognized as a universal.|$|E
5|$|Ion I. Agârbiceanu (1907–1971) was {{the author}} of <b>pioneering</b> <b>work</b> in spectroscopy, famed for his {{invention}} of a gas laser. Another one of the writers' sons was a surveyor. He and his family remained in possession of Agârbiceanu's large villa in Cluj, which was later declared a historic monument. The writer's grave was awarded the same status by Romania's Culture Ministry in 2012. Among the localities associated with Agârbiceanu's work, Bucium is home to a Fefeleaga Memorial House, a modern reconstruction which used Romanian folk houses as a blueprint; Sofia Danciu's actual home burned down in summer 2014.|$|E

5|$|Shen Kuo's Dream Pool Essays {{argued against}} {{traditional}} Chinese beliefs in anatomy (such as his argument for two throat valves instead of three); this perhaps spurred {{the interest in}} the performance of post-mortem autopsies in China during the 12th century. The physician and judge known as Song Ci (1186–1249) wrote a <b>pioneering</b> <b>work</b> of forensic science on the examination of corpses in order to determine cause of death (strangulation, poisoning, drowning, blows, etc.) and to prove whether death resulted from murder, suicide, or accidental death. Song Ci stressed the importance of proper coroner's conduct during autopsies and the accurate recording of the inquest of each autopsy by official clerks.|$|E
5|$|A <b>pioneering</b> <b>work</b> of {{the fantasy}} genre was The King of Elfland's Daughter, a 1924 novel by Lord Dunsany. The Elves of Middle-earth {{played a central}} role in Tolkien's legendarium, notably The Silmarillion and The Lord of the Rings; this legendarium was {{enormously}} influential on subsequent fantasy writing. Tolkien's writing had such influence that in the 1960s and afterwards, elves speaking an elvish language similar to those in Tolkien's novels became staple non-human characters in high fantasy works and in fantasy role-playing games. Post-Tolkien fantasy elves (which featured not only in novels but also role-playing games such as Dungeons & Dragons) are often portrayed as being wiser and more beautiful than humans, with sharper senses and perceptions as well. They are said to be gifted in magic, mentally sharp and lovers of nature, art, and song. They are often skilled archers. A hallmark of many fantasy elves is their pointed ears.|$|E
5|$|In India, Fairley {{continued}} his research into schistosomiasis. The disease was unknown in India but snails were abundant {{and there was}} danger that troops returning from Egypt might introduce it. In the absence of human schistosoma, Fairley investigated bovine schistosoma, which infected water buffalo and other domesticated animals in the Bombay area. Experiments with monkeys proved that daily intravenous doses of tartaric acid were an effective treatment. Fairley also carried out <b>pioneering</b> <b>work</b> on Guinea worm disease (dracunculiasis). However, his main interest was Tropical sprue. But {{he was unable to}} determine its cause or discover a cure; in spite of contracting the disease himself and making some advances in its treatment. He was invalided out of India, travelling to the United Kingdom to recuperate in 1925. While in India he had met Mary Evelyn Greaves, and they were married at the Presbyterian Church, Marylebone, on 28 October 1925.|$|E
