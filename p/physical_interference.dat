500|$|Trespass to goods {{is defined}} as [...] "wrongful <b>physical</b> <b>interference</b> with goods {{that are in the}} {{possession}} of another". It is covered not only by the common law, but also by the Torts (Interference with Goods) Act 1977, which was written to clear up the confusing rules on trespass to goods which had evolved over the centuries. It is similar to the tort of conversion, which covers the interference with goods in a way which is inconsistent with the rights of the owner. [...] "Physical interference" [...] is usually the taking or destroying of goods, but can be as minor as touching or moving them in the right circumstances. In Kirk v Gregory, the defendant moved jewellery from one room to another, where it was stolen. The deceased owner's executor successfully sued her for trespass to goods. Goods cover almost any physical object, including animals, as in Slater v Swann, but not organs, as in AB & Ors v Leeds Teaching Hospital NHS Trust. [...] "Possession" [...] has the standard legal meaning, referring to the claimant's right to use, control or deal with the item. This can include owners, but also bailees.|$|E
40|$|Consensus {{dynamics}} in decentralised multiagent systems {{are subject to}} intense studies, and several different models have been proposed and analysed. Among these, the naming game stands out for its simplicity and applicability {{to a wide range}} of phenomena and applications, from semiotics to engineering. Despite the wide range of studies available, the implementation of theoretical models in real distributed systems is not always straightforward, as the physical platform imposes several constraints that may have a bearing on the consensus dynamics. In this paper, we investigate the effects of an implementation of the naming game for the kilobot robotic platform, in which we consider concurrent execution of games and <b>physical</b> <b>interferences.</b> Consensus dynamics are analysed in the light of the continuously evolving communication network created by the robots, highlighting how the different regimes crucially depend on the robot density and on their ability to spread widely in the experimental arena. We find that <b>physical</b> <b>interferences</b> reduce the benefits resulting from robot mobility in terms of consensus time, but also result in lower cognitive load for individual agents.

2500|$|These {{holdings}} {{gave the}} court license {{to expand the}} applicability of trespass to chattels to computer networks even further. In Oyster Software v.

Although Oyster conceded that there was no evidence that the defendant's activities had interfered in any way with the functioning of Oyster's computer system, the court nonetheless denied FPI's motion for summary judgment.

40|$|The prototypical {{normative}} intuition against direct <b>physical</b> <b>interferences</b> {{underlies the}} trespassory torts and is entrenched in current tort law doctrine. That such interferences are actionable without proof of damage distinguishes these torts from the compensation-dominated mainstream and requires explanation (found in: psychology; legal history; and Maine’s ‘interstices of procedure’) and justification (found in vindication and deterrence). Trespass doctrine instantiates Schauer’s ‘presumptive formalism’—a legal-systemic analogue of Kahneman’s ‘fast thinking’. But—as {{the analysis of}} direct acts, intention, harm, standing and the available forms of redress demonstrates—trespass doctrine is both over and under inclusive. Consequently, it is sometimes manipulated by means of intra-systemic ‘slow thinking’. Furthermore, occasionally extra-systemic review from standpoints outside the citadel of doctrine seems appropriate. Choosing between these modes entails difficult issues of judgement. Because the argument draws from several disciplines, the lengthy text can show {{only the tip of}} the several conceptual icebergs.

40|$|Abstract — In {{large-scale}} wireless networks, interferences among nodes limit channel spatial re-use {{and are a}} main hurdle for scalable performance. There are {{two types}} of interferences: 1) <b>physical</b> <b>interferences</b> due to the receiver’s inability to decode a signal when the powers received from other signals are large; and 2) protocol interferences imposed by the specific multi-access protocol being used. This paper models interference types 1 and 2 in terms of a set of inequality constraints for the IEEE 802. 11 CSMA/CA protocol. Based on the inequalities, we investigate the impact of the parameters basic-rate, data-rate, and physicalpreamble-rate, on channel spatial re-use. Regardless of the parameter settings, the total capacity in an 802. 11 network reaches a ceiling as the number of node n increases. We identify the fundamental causes for the non-scalable performance, and show that 802. 11 can be made to be scalable with a simple modification, achieving O(n) throughput without adaptive power control. We believe {{that this is the first}} paper that has demonstrated this...|$|R

40|$|The Italian Regulations for airport {{construction}} and service, {{drawn up by}} ENAC, recommend the airport manager to adopt a Safety Management System (SMS), {{by the end of}} 2005. The SMS is the instrument considered necessary in order to enhance the safety levels in the airport. This need arises from the fact that, in the last few years, air traffic has continuously increased and consequently, airfield operations have similarly grown. This has caused an increase in “runway incursion” phenomena, associated with <b>physical</b> <b>interferences</b> and “contacts” between aircraft manoeuvring in the aprons or taxiways. This paper highlights that, with the objective of appropriate airport activity, each component of the airport area being designed according to the operational standards of the airport itself it is not sufficient, whereas rules and procedures suitable for different functional scenarios are a necessity for a safe exploitation of the infrastructure. The paper explains the requirements for a correct airport system implementation: a safety-oriented management approach, an organization effectively based on safety requirements and a system with safety being its main goal. The paper also presents the guidelines to be followed for drawing up an airport SMS, paying attention to each single phase of the procedures, such as: identification of the objectives to be reached, planning of the intervention priorities, selecting the most suitable procedures to achieve these objectives, evaluation of the performance levels through continuous monitoring of the system condition...|$|R
