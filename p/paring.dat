5|$|Sessions for Living in the Material World {{took place}} at Apple Studio in central London and at Harrison's Friar Park studio, FPSHOT, {{beginning}} in October 1972. Despite his original intention to co-produce with Phil Spector as before, Harrison was sole producer throughout the sessions, with Phil McDonald again serving as recording engineer. While Harrison succeeded in <b>paring</b> down the album's production after the Wall of Sound excesses of All Things Must Pass, commentators note that he incorporated aspects of Spector's signature style on this and other songs on Material World, {{through the use of}} orchestral strings and brass, a choir and multiple drummers.|$|E
5|$|In early September1972, a {{tropical}} disturbance developed within a near-equatorial trough near the Northern Mariana Islands. On September11, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) began monitoring this system as {{a tropical}} depression shortly after moving through the island chain. Initially, the system tracked southwestward before turning northwestward {{along the edge of}} a ridge. On September13, a United States Air Force reconnaissance plane flew into the system and found that it had intensified into a tropical storm. At this time, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began monitoring the newly named Tropical Storm Helen. Additionally, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration began warning on the system, assigning it the local name <b>Paring.</b> The following day, Helen attained typhoon status as it turned northward. Subsequently, a deepening trough over the East China Sea caused the typhoon to turn north-northeastward and accelerate.|$|E

Northbound PA 222 turns south onto 12th Street and east onto Walnut Street while southbound PA 222 runs west along Linden Street to 12th Street, following 12th Street south to Hamilton Street. Walnut Street is two lanes and two-way until 10th Street, where it becomes one-way with two northbound lanes heading east, while Linden Street {{is one way}} southbound with two lanes heading west. The one-way <b>paring</b> continues east past homes and businesses in the downtown area.

PA 222 intersects 7th Street, which carries southbound PA 145, before it reaches its northern terminus at 6th Street, which carries northbound PA 145.|$|E
40|$|This study aims to {{determine}} the genetic diversity of locally rice germplasm based on RAPD analysis. Totally eighten of locally rices were used in this research : <b>Pare</b> Ambo, <b>Pare</b> Bau, <b>Pare</b> Birrang, <b>Pare</b> Bumbungan, <b>Pare</b> Kobo, <b>Pare</b> Lalodo, <b>Pare</b> Lea, <b>Pare</b> Rogon, <b>Pare</b> Tallang, <b>Pare</b> Kamida, <b>Pare</b> Lambau, <b>Pare</b> Solo, Pulu Mandoti, <b>Pare</b> Lotong, Pallan, Mansur, <b>Pare</b> Pinjan and <b>Pare</b> Salle. Extraction of DNA was made according the method of Doley and Doley (1987) with modification. Molecular analysis was performed using six different RAPD primers, there were OPF- 14, OPH- 14, OPM- 05, OPM- 12, OPU- 15 and OPX- 09. PCR products were separated on 1. 8 % agarose gel and vizualised in EtBr solution. DNA bands were then analyzed with NTSYS program. The results showed a highly variation in the DNA band profiles, the bands number of each primer varied between 4 - 10 bands {{with an average of}} 7 bands from a total of 42 bands. Primers that generated most polymorphic DNA fragments are OPF- 14 and OPU- 15, as many as 10 fragments/bands. Dendrogram analysis separated 18 local rice accessions in three groups. <b>Pare</b> Pallan, Mansur, Lambau, Solo, Tallang and Lotong has similarity cooeficient of 96 %, while <b>Pare</b> Bumbungan has farther most similarity with other rice genotypes that only 35 %...|$|R

25|$|On 21 April at dawn, Marshal Louis-Nicolas Davout {{moved his}} III Corps east from Haugen against Rosenberg's {{positions}} {{to open the}} two-day Battle of Eckmühl. Suspecting an attack, Rosenberg put Stutterheim in command of three battalions, six squadrons, and a horse artillery battery and ordered him to hold the village of <b>Paring,</b> which is midway between Hausen and Eckmühl. At 6:00 AM Stutterheim reported the French advance and his corps commander reinforced him {{to a total of}} six battalions. The French division of Louis Friant soon attacked <b>Paring</b> with the 108th and 111th Line Infantry Regiments. While the 108th mounted a frontal assault, the 111th turned Austrian right flank. <b>Paring</b> fell and 400 Austrians were captured, but the contest occupied the French until 11:00 AM. Meanwhile, Stutterheim's cavalry harassed the Bavarian division of Bernhard Erasmus von Deroy in its efforts to capture the town of Schierling to the west of Eckmühl. Deroy managed to wrest Schierling from Josef Philipp Vukassovich's defenders, but got no farther east that day.|$|E

25|$|Later economists, as well {{as people}} at the time, also criticised Churchill's budget measures. These were seen as {{assisting}} the generally prosperous rentier banking and salaried classes (to which Churchill and his associates generally belonged) at the expense of manufacturers and exporters which were known then to be suffering from imports and from competition in traditional export markets, and as <b>paring</b> the Armed Forces, and especially the Royal Navy, too heavily.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} better provide stark, contrasting, analogies, the Futurist {{literature}} promoted a kind of hyper-conciseness. It was dubbed essential and synthetic lyricism. The former refers to a <b>paring</b> down of any and all superfluous objects while the latter expresses an unnatural compactness of the language unseen elsewhere. This idea explains where poetry became the preferred literary medium of Futurism and why there are no Futurist novels (since novels are neither pared down nor compressed).|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the victims}} had been {{rendered}} unconscious prior to their murder, although some had {{died as a result}} of having acid or boiling water injected into their brain. (As he had no memory of the murder of Tuomi, he was unsure whether he was unconscious when beaten to death, although he did concede it was possible that his viewing the exposed chest of Steven Tuomi while in a drunken stupor may have led him to unsuccessfully attempt to tear Tuomi's heart from his chest.) Almost all the murders Dahmer committed after moving into the Oxford Apartments had involved a ritual of posing the victims' bodies in suggestive positions—typically with the chest thrust outwards—prior to dismemberment. He readily admitted to performing necrophilia with several of his victims' bodies, including performing sexual acts with their viscera as he dismembered their bodies in his bathtub. Having noted that much of the blood pooled inside his victims' chest after death, Dahmer would first remove the internal organs, then suspend the torso so the blood would drain into his bathtub, before dicing any organs he did not wish to retain and <b>paring</b> the flesh from the body. The bones he wished to dispose of would be pulverized or acidified, with Soilex and bleach solutions used to aid in the preservation of the skeletons and skulls he wished to keep. In addition, he confessed to having consumed the hearts, livers, biceps, and portions of thighs of several victims killed within the previous year.|$|E
