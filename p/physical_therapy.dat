5|$|Non-surgical {{treatment}} is rarely an option {{as the ability}} for articular cartilage to heal is limited. As a result, even moderate cases require some form of surgery. When possible, non-operative forms of management such as protected reduced or non-weight bearing and immobilization are used. Surgical treatment includes arthroscopic drilling of intact lesions, securing of cartilage flap lesions with pins or screws, drilling and replacement of cartilage plugs, stem cell transplantation, and joint replacement. After surgery rehabilitation is usually a two-stage process of immobilization and <b>physical</b> <b>therapy.</b> Most rehabilitation programs combine efforts to protect the joint with muscle strengthening and range of motion. During the immobilization period, isometric exercises, such as straight leg raises, are commonly used to restore muscle loss without disturbing the cartilage of the affected joint. Once the immobilization period has ended, <b>physical</b> <b>therapy</b> involves continuous passive motion (CPM) and/or low impact activities, such as walking or swimming.|$|E

However, it was uncertain as to how complete of a recovery it would be. Mustaine stated his hopes to regain the ability to play guitar. He subsequently recovered following months of <b>physical</b> <b>therapy.</b>|$|E
5|$|Prevention {{measures}} include use {{of protective}} technology in vehicles, such as seat belts and sports or motorcycle helmets, {{as well as}} efforts {{to reduce the number}} of collisions, such as safety education programs and enforcement of traffic laws. Depending on the injury, treatment required may be minimal or may include interventions such as medications, emergency surgery or surgery years later. <b>Physical</b> <b>therapy,</b> speech therapy, recreation therapy, occupational therapy and vision therapy may be employed for rehabilitation. Counseling, supported employment, and community support services may also be useful.|$|E

5|$|A {{rehabilitation}} program often involves {{protection of the}} compromised articular surface and underlying subchondral bone combined with maintenance of strength and range of motion. Post-operative analgesics, namely a mix of opioids and NSAIDs, are usually required to control pain, inflammation and swelling. Straight leg raising and other isometric exercises are encouraged during the post-operative or immobilization period. A six to eight-week home or formal <b>physical</b> <b>therapy</b> program is usually instituted once the immobilization period has ended, incorporating range of motion, stretching, progressive strengthening, and functional or sport-specific training. During this time, patients are advised to avoid running and jumping, but are permitted to perform low impact activities, such as walking or swimming. If patients return to activity before the cartilage has become firm, they will typically complain of pain during maneuvers such as squatting or jumping.|$|E
5|$|For {{those with}} pain {{localized}} {{to the lower}} back due to disc degeneration, fair evidence supports spinal fusion as equal to intensive <b>physical</b> <b>therapy</b> and slightly better than low-intensity nonsurgical measures.

There are a number of different surgical procedures to achieve fusion, with no clear evidence of one being better than the others. Adding spinal implant devices during fusion increases the risks but provides no added improvement in pain or function.|$|E

40|$|SummaryBackgroundA {{range of}} <b>physical</b> <b>therapies</b> (including airway {{clearance}} and physical training) {{are used in}} cystic fibrosis (CF). The aim {{of this paper is}} to summarise the main findings from Cochrane systematic reviews that have considered the evidence for <b>physical</b> <b>therapies</b> in CF. MethodsAll outcomes reported in relevant Cochrane systematic reviews are summarised. ResultsReview 1 provides some evidence from short-term trials of the benefit of airway clearance over no airway clearance in improved mucus transport but no definitive evidence from long-term trials to support the efficacy of airway clearance over no airway clearance; review 2 provides some evidence that conventional chest physiotherapy (CCPT) is at least as effective as other forms of airway clearance, but that patients may have a preference for self-administered treatments over CCPT; review 3 provides some evidence that positive expiratory pressure (PEP) is at least as effective as other forms of airway clearance; review 4 provides some evidence to support the use of non-invasive ventilation during airway clearance in patients with moderate to severe disease who have difficulty clearing sputum; review 5 provides some evidence of the benefits of different types of physical training. ConclusionThe Cochrane systematic reviews summarised in this paper provide some evidence to support the inclusion of <b>physical</b> <b>therapies</b> in the care-management plan of CF. They also provide information to steer the direction and focus of future research in this area...|$|R

5|$|The McMaster Model is the university's {{policy for}} a student-centred, problem-based, {{interdisciplinary}} approach to learning, a policy {{which has been}} adopted by several other universities around the world. During the 1960s the McMaster University Medical School pioneered problem-based learning (PBL) tutorials that have since been adopted by other programs and faculties within the university. PBL is now used in medicine, occupational therapy, <b>physical</b> <b>therapy,</b> nursing, midwifery, and other allied fields. Most medical schools in Canada and more than 80 percent of medical schools in the United States employ PBL in their curriculum, and many international universities do the same.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{cure for}} HD, but there are {{treatments}} available to reduce the severity {{of some of its}} symptoms. For many of these treatments, evidence to confirm their effectiveness in treating symptoms of HD specifically are incomplete. As the disease progresses the ability to care for oneself declines, and carefully managed multidisciplinary caregiving becomes increasingly necessary. Although there have been relatively few studies of exercises and therapies that help rehabilitate cognitive symptoms of HD, there is some evidence for the usefulness of <b>physical</b> <b>therapy,</b> occupational therapy, and speech therapy. An association between caffeine intake and earlier age of onset in Huntington's disease has been found but, since this finding was based on retrospective questionnaire data rather than a blinded, randomized trial or case-control study, this work is a poor basis for guiding lifestyle decisions.|$|E
5|$|There is {{no known}} cure for {{multiple}} sclerosis. Treatments attempt to improve function after an attack and prevent new attacks.

Many people pursue alternative treatments, {{despite a lack of}} evidence. The long-term outcome is difficult to predict, with good outcomes more often seen in women, those who develop the disease early in life, those with a relapsing course, and those who initially experienced few attacks. Life expectancy is on average 5 to 10 years lower than that of an unaffected population.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, {{the number of}} {{patients}} residing in mental hospitals increased significantly while {{little in the way of}} effective medical treatment was available. Lobotomy was one of a series of radical and invasive <b>physical</b> <b>therapies</b> developed in Europe at this time that signaled a break with a psychiatric culture of therapeutic nihilism that had prevailed since the late nineteenth-century. The new [...] "heroic" [...] <b>physical</b> <b>therapies</b> devised during this experimental era, including malarial therapy for general paresis of the insane (1917), deep sleep therapy (1920), insulin shock therapy (1933), cardiazol shock therapy (1934), and electroconvulsive therapy (1938), helped to imbue the then therapeutically moribund and demoralised psychiatric profession with a renewed sense of optimism in the curability of insanity and the potency of their craft. The success of the shock therapies, despite the considerable risk they posed to patients, also helped to accommodate psychiatrists to ever more drastic forms of medical intervention, including lobotomy.|$|R
