5|$|The classic {{point in}} <b>polygon</b> test from {{computational}} geometry applies the above ideas. To {{determine if a}} point lies within a <b>polygon,</b> one casts a ray from infinity to the point and counts {{the number of times}} the ray crosses the edge of <b>polygon.</b> The crossing number is even if and only if the point is outside the <b>polygon.</b> This algorithm works because if the ray never crosses the <b>polygon,</b> then its crossing number is zero, which is even, and the point is outside. Every time the ray does cross the <b>polygon,</b> the crossing number alternates between even and odd, and the point at its tip alternates between outside and inside.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the number of}} <b>polygons</b> generated by map overlay. Overlay of maps yields {{a number of small}} <b>polygons,</b> and often causes problems in computation, handling, and storage of derived <b>polygons.</b> One method to deal with these problems is to expect the number of derived <b>polygons</b> before executing overlay operation. To this end a stochastic model is proposed by which the expectation of the number of derived <b>polygons</b> is calculated. The major results are summarized as follows: 1) the number of <b>polygons</b> generated by map overlay depends on the number of original <b>polygons</b> and their perimeter; 2) the number of derived <b>polygons</b> increases with the perimeter of original polygons; 3) McAlpine and Cook (1971) 's conjecture on the number of derived <b>polygons</b> is underestimate; 4) the number of <b>polygons</b> generated by overlay of maps having the same lattice system is proportional to the square of the number of overlaid maps and the number of <b>polygons</b> on the map, and inversely proportional to the area-perimeter ratio of the unit cell. 1...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe {{present a}} new method that allows to enumerate many classes of column-convex <b>polygons,</b> {{according}} to their perimeter, width and area. The first step of this method leads to a functional equation which defines implicitly the generating function for the class of <b>polygons</b> under consideration. The second step consists in solving this equation. We apply systematically our method to all the usual classes of column-convex polygons: thus, we first refine some already known results for parallelogram <b>polygons,</b> directed and convex <b>polygons,</b> and convex <b>polygons,</b> and then we obtain two new results, namely the generating function for column-convex <b>polygons</b> and directed column-convex <b>polygons...</b>|$|R

5|$|Similar {{methods can}} be used to enclose an {{arbitrary}} simple <b>polygon</b> within a curve of constant width, whose width equals the diameter of the given <b>polygon.</b> The resulting shape consists of circular arcs (at most as many as sides of the <b>polygon),</b> can be constructed algorithmically in linear time, and can be drawn with compass and straightedge. Although the regular-polygon based Reuleaux polygons all have an odd number of circular-arc sides, it is possible to construct constant-width shapes based on irregular polygons that have an even number of sides.|$|E

40|$|Algorithms to {{generate}} walks (chains of unit-length, freely-jointed segments) and <b>polygons</b> (closed walks) in spherical confinements {{have been developed}} {{in the last few}} years. These algorithms generate <b>polygons</b> inside spherical confinement based on their mathematically derived probability distributions. The generated <b>polygons</b> do not occupy any volume { although that would be useful for some applications. This thesis investigates how {{to generate}} walks and <b>polygons</b> which occupy some volume in spherical confinement. More specifically, in this thesis, existing methods described in the literature have been studied and implemented to generate walks and <b>polygons</b> in confinement. Additionally, these methods were adapted to design, develop, and implement an algorithm which generates walks and <b>polygons</b> in confinement with thick segments, that is, segments which occupy volume. Data is collected by generating walks and <b>polygons</b> of different lengths with and without thickness inside the spherical confinements of various radii to compare walks and <b>polygons</b> with thickness with those generated without thickness. The analysis of the collected data shows that a. the newly developed algorithm indeed generates <b>polygons</b> which are thicker than those generated with the volumeless algorithm; and b. the newly developed algorithm generates <b>polygons</b> which are different from the <b>polygons</b> generated by the volumeless algorithm. The analysis also includes an assessment of the computational cost of generating thick <b>polygons...</b>|$|R
