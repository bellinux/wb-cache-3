5|$|Arguably the Taylor administration's {{definitive}} accomplishment {{in foreign}} policy was the Clayton–Bulwer Treaty of 1850, regarding a proposed inter-oceanic canal through Central America. While the U.S. and Britain were on friendly terms, {{and the construction of}} such a canal was decades away from reality, the mere possibility <b>put</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> nations in an uneasy position. For several years, Britain had been seizing strategic points, particularly the Mosquito Coast on the eastern coast of present-day Nicaragua. Negotiations were held with Britain that resulted in the landmark Clayton–Bulwer Treaty. Both nations agreed not to claim control of any canal that might be built in Nicaragua. The treaty promoted development of an Anglo-American alliance; its completion was Taylor's last action as president.|$|E

[...] American Life became Madonna's final studio album with Maverick Records, and marked the end of an eleven-year recording history with the label. In an interview with VH1 titled Madonna Speaks, the singer discussed her 20 years in the music industry, and revealed her motivations behind American Life, about [...] "material things" [...] being unimportant. [...] "I have lots of 'material' things and I've had lots of beliefs about things and what's important, and I look back at the 20 years behind me and I realized that {{a lot of things that}} I'd valued weren't important", she concluded.

500|$|Killigrew's {{investment}} in the new playhouse <b>put</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> companies on a level as far as technical resources were concerned, but the offerings at the Theatre Royal nevertheless continued {{to be dominated by}} actor-driven [...] "talk" [...] drama, contrasting with William Davenant's baroque spectacles and operas at Lincoln's Inn Fields. Internal power structures were the main reason for this difference: while Davenant skilfully commanded a docile young troupe, Killigrew's authority over his veteran actors was far from absolute. Experienced actors Michael Mohun (who Pepys called [...] "the best actor in the world") and Charles Hart held out for shares and good contracts in the King's Company. Such a division of power between the patentee, Killigrew, and his chief actors led to frequent conflicts that hampered the Theatre Royal as a business venture. Nevertheless, it was mostly at the struggling Theatre Royal, rather than at the efficiently run Lincoln's Inn Fields, that the plays were acted that are classics today. This applies especially to the new form Restoration comedy, dominated in the 1660s by William Wycherley and the Theatre Royal's house dramatist John Dryden. Actors such as Hart and Charles II's mistress Nell Gwyn developed and refined the famous scenes of repartee, banter and flirtation in Dryden's and Wycherley's comedies. With the appearance of actresses {{for the first time at}} Drury Lane and Lincoln's Inn Fields in the 1660s, British playwrights wrote parts for outspoken female characters, daring love scenes and provocative breeches roles. In any case, the competition between the King's Company and the Duke's was good for the rebirth and development of English drama.|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film {{three and a}} half stars out offour, calling it [...] "well-cast" [...] and commending it for playing to each actor's strengths.

Ebert called Horrible Bosses [...] "cheerful and wicked". Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly reacted positively, calling the film [...] "abouncy, well-built, delightfully nasty tale of resentment, desperation, and amoral revenge" [...] and complimented the casting of the protagonists and antagonists. The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin also praised the cast, stating that the picture [...] "succeeds almost entirely on the chemistry of its three leads, who remain likeable even while resorting to homicide", adding the [...] "acting more than compensates for the film's other failings." [...] Rabin singled out Day's performance as [...] "apotent illustration of how a brilliant character actor with a spark of madness can elevate a ramshackle lowbrow farce into a solid mainstream comedy through sheer force of charisma." [...] Edward Douglas of ComingSoon.net credited director Seth Gordon with having assembled [...] "the perfect cast", claiming [...] "the six leads kill in every scene", but echoed Nathan Rabin's sentiments that Day is the [...] "real standout". Douglas summarized the picture as [...] "dark fun that works better than expected due to a well-developed script, an impeccable cast and a director who knows how to <b>put</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> together". A. O.
