5|$|Like most {{legislation}} of its kind, {{the act of}} 1893 {{imposed a}} time limit for the compulsory <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> and the raising of capital. To keep the powers granted by the act alive, the CCE submitted a series of further bills to Parliament for extensions of time. Extensions were granted by the Charing Cross Euston and Hampstead Railway Acts, 1897, 1898, 1900, and 1902.|$|E
5|$|Holmes was keenly {{involved}} with {{the details of the}} Agricultural College, influencing everything from the <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> for the campus, layout of the buildings, and even the placement of the chairs and tables. Once the College opened, he assumed the role of treasurer and later Professor of Horticulture. By 1861, Holmes had fallen out of favor with the other College administrators, and retired to his home in Detroit. Nevertheless, he continued to support and visit the college until his death in 1887.|$|E
5|$|Like most {{legislation}} of its kind, {{the act of}} 1893 {{imposed a}} time limit for the compulsory <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> and the raising of capital. To keep the powers alive, the BS announced a new bill in November 1895, which included an application for an extension of time. The additional time and permission to raise an extra £100,000 of capital was granted when the Baker Street and Waterloo Railway Act, 1896 received royal assent on 7 August 1896.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the early}} 19th century the Everglades {{have been a}} subject of {{interest}} for agricultural development. The first attempt to drain the Everglades occurred in 1882 when a Pennsylvania land developer named Hamilton Disston constructed the first canals. Though these attempts were largely unsuccessful, Disston's <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> spurred tourism and real estate development of the state. The political motivations of Governor Napoleon Bonaparte Broward resulted in more successful attempts at canal construction between 1906 and 1920. Recently reclaimed wetlands were used for cultivating sugarcane and vegetables, while urban development began in the Everglades.|$|E
5|$|However, {{following}} Manchester United's first league {{title in}} 1908 and the FA Cup a year later, {{it was decided}} that Bank Street was too restrictive for Davies' ambition; in February 1909, six weeks before the club's first FA Cup title, Old Trafford was named as the home of Manchester United, following the <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> for around £60,000. Architect Archibald Leitch was given a budget of £30,000 for construction; original plans called for seating capacity of 100,000, though budget constraints forced a revision to 77,000. The building was constructed by Messrs Brameld and Smith of Manchester. The stadium's record attendance was registered on 25 March 1939, when an FA Cup semi-final between Wolverhampton Wanderers and Grimsby Town drew 76,962spectators.|$|E
5|$|On 23 November 1900, the CCE {{announced}} its most wide-ranging {{modifications to the}} route. Two bills were submitted to Parliament, referred to as No. 1 and No. 2. Bill No. 1 proposed {{the continuation of the}} railway north from Hampstead to Golders Green, the <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> and properties for stations and the construction of a depot at Golders Green. Also proposed were minor adjustments to route alignments previously approved. Bill No. 2 proposed two extensions: from Kentish Town to Brecknock Road, Archway Tavern, Archway Road and Highgate in the north and from Charing Cross to Parliament Square, Artillery Row and Victoria station in the south.|$|E

5|$|Prince George's County {{officials}} {{continued to}} worry that cutbacks in federal funding for mass transit might lead to the cancellation of the four proposed stations (Southern Avenue, Naylor Road, Suitland, and Branch Avenue) in the county. Prince George's officials vetoed in July 1981 any further expenditure of Metro's construction funds unless Metro diverted $100 million from the Red Line extension in Montgomery County to Glenmont and began the immediate <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> and rights-of-way in Prince George's County. Metro agreed a month later to the plan, {{with the proviso that}} $90 million per year would be spent to begin work on the inner-city portion of the Green Line (the Gallery Place, Waterfront, and Navy Yard stations).|$|E
5|$|Like most {{legislation}} of its kind, {{the act of}} 1891 {{imposed a}} time limit for the compulsory <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> and the raising of capital. The original date specified for completion of construction {{was the end of}} 1896, but the time required to raise the finance and purchase station sites meant that construction had not begun by the start of that year. To give itself extra time, the CLR had obtained an extension of time to 1899 by the Central London Railway Act, 1894. Construction works were let by the ETCL as three sub-contracts: Shepherd's Bush to Marble Arch, Marble Arch to St Martin's Le Grand and St Martin's Le Grand to Bank. Work began with demolition of buildings at the Chancery Lane site in April 1896 and construction shafts were started at Chancery Lane, Shepherd's Bush, Stanhope Terrace and Bloomsbury in August and September 1896.|$|E
5|$|Lord Selkirk was {{involved}} with the first permanent settlement (known as the Red River Colony), the <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> from the Hudson's Bay Company, and a survey of river lots in the early 19th century. The North West Company built Fort Gibraltar in 1809, and the Hudson's Bay Company built Fort Douglas in 1812, both {{in the area of}} present-day Winnipeg. The two companies competed fiercely over trade. The Métis and Lord Selkirk's settlers fought at the Battle of Seven Oaks in 1816. In 1821, the Hudson's Bay and North West Companies merged, ending their long rivalry. Fort Gibraltar was renamed Fort Garry in 1822 and became the leading post in the region for the Hudson's Bay Company. A flood destroyed the fort in 1826 and it was not rebuilt until 1835. A rebuilt section of the fort, consisting of the front gate and a section of the wall, is near the modern-day corner of Main Street and Broadway Avenue in downtown Winnipeg.|$|E
50|$|One simple type {{of forest}} {{protection}} is the <b>purchasing</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> {{in order to}} secure it, or in order to plant trees (afforestation). It can also mean forest management or the designation of areas such as natural reservoirs which are intended to be left to themselves. However, merely <b>purchasing</b> a piece <b>of</b> <b>land</b> does not prevent it from being used by others for poaching and illegal logging.|$|R
25|$|Although the Netherlands {{remained}} wealthy, investors for the nation's money {{became more}} difficult to find. Some investment went into <b>purchases</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> for estates, but most went to foreign bonds and Amsterdam remained one of Europe's banking capitals.|$|R

5|$|While Pierce {{was popular}} and outgoing, his family {{life was a}} grim affair, with his wife Jane {{suffering}} from illness and depression for much of her life. All of their children died young, their last son being gruesomely killed in a train accident while the family was traveling shortly before Pierce's inauguration. As president, Pierce simultaneously attempted to enforce neutral standards for civil service while also satisfying the diverse elements of the Democratic Party with patronage, an effort which largely failed and turned many in his party against him. Pierce was a Young America expansionist who signed the Gadsden <b>Purchase</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> from Mexico and led a failed attempt to acquire Cuba from Spain. He signed trade treaties with Britain and Japan, while his Cabinet reformed their departments and improved accountability, but these successes were overshadowed by political strife during his presidency.|$|E
5|$|As {{the popular}} choice {{leading into the}} election, he handily {{defeated}} fellow councillor Arthur Cushing by a count of 627 votes to 355, and thus became mayor of Edmonton. He served in this capacity for one term of one year, but did not seek re-election in 1906 and retired from political life thereafter. It was during May's term as mayor in which the municipal foundations of Edmonton were set; he oversaw {{the purchase of the}} road maintenance equipment, the city's first telephone system as well as the upgrade of the street car system to steel rails and posts, <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> for municipal use, paving of roads, and negotiations {{for the establishment of a}} manufacturing plant in the city. He also travelled to Toronto to lobby for a new union railway station in Edmonton to be constructed for use by the Grand Trunk, Canadian Northern and Canadian Pacific Railways. It was also during May's term which the Alberta Legislature Building would first open its doors, which he would participate in its opening ceremonies. In 1911, he would be named a returning officer for Edmonton, in charge of overseeing the Canadian federal election, 1911.|$|E
5|$|The {{meeting on}} 17 January was crowded. Many {{attendees}} were not electors, as franchise {{was attached to}} land ownership in excess of £50, or yearly rental over £10, and the resulting roll was only about 160 names long, including absentee owners in England. There had been rumours beforehand that somebody would come forward to oppose Sewell. William Thomson was elected to chair the meeting. Sewell spoke at length about various issues: {{that he should be}} elected because of the service that he had given Canterbury as their representative when in financial crisis, that he even delayed his departure to England to resolve the issues, that he had no conflict of interest with the steam ship company that provided New Zealand's postal service with England, {{that he did not have}} land holdings in the North Island more valuable than holdings in Canterbury, that he gave qualified support to the Lyttelton Rail Tunnel project and he gave his reasons for leaving the Stafford Ministry so soon after his return to the colony last year. He disagreed with Stafford's government on some issues. The two most important disagreements were land policy, where Sewell wanted the land revenue to be retained by the provincial governments, rather than the southern provinces pay a high proportion of their revenue to enable <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> in the north, and native policy, where Sewell predicted that the land policy being pursued would result in strong conflict with Māori; in fact, the First Taranaki War started in March 1860. As a solution, Sewell suggested the possible separation of the North Island and the South Island into separate countries; this was the first time, as far as the editor of the Lyttelton Times was aware, that such a suggestion had been made in public by a politician. The politician who is today known to have favoured separation is Julius Vogel, and he started campaigning for this idea in 1862. The Lyttelton Times argued, against the objection of many, that such an idea had merit for further consideration.|$|E

50|$|After George Washington {{was elected}} President, he asked Stoddert to <b>purchase</b> key parcels <b>of</b> <b>land</b> {{in the area}} that would become the nation's capital, before the formal {{decision}} to establish the federal city {{on the banks of the}} Potomac drove up prices there. Stoddert then transferred the parcels to the government.
