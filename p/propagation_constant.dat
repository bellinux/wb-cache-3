For the distributions calculated by the coupled mode theory, we reveal the similarity and differences of the band made of eigenvalues of the coupled mode equations matrix when compared to the first band of <b>propagation</b> <b>constants</b> found by the exact solution. Analysis of two numeric beam propagation methods shows that the relative accuracy of the calculated field distributions of each of these methods depends on excitation conditions. The presented analysis of the slowly varying envelope equation provides guide lines for selecting the value of the reference refractive index to be incorporated in these numeric methods where an analytic solution is difficult to work out or in the frequently occurring cases where an analytic solution does not exist at all.
