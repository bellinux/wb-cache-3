40|$|A new {{performance}} measure for target date funds Target date funds {{are becoming increasingly}} important as investment solutions for retirement savings plans. In 2007 the Department of Labor recognized target date funds as a possible suitable choice as the default investment option for defined contribution plans, and subsequently {{there has been a}} surge of assets into these funds. As of April 2009, assets under management in target date funds are estimated to be close to $ 314 billion. 1 Investment managers have responded with new products and redesigns of existing products. For the individual investor, <b>investment</b> advisor or <b>plan</b> sponsor, selecting from among the variety of target date products is a formidable task. One of the fundamental problems is the lack of an objective, returns-based measure of performance that is appropriate for evaluating target date funds. While investment decisions should never be based solely on past performance, any investor choosing among families of target date funds (whether an individual investor, <b>personal</b> <b>investment</b> advisor, <b>plan</b> sponsor or plan participant) is going to ask: “How have they performed? Have they done better than some simple but reasonable benchmark? How has the family of funds I am considering done relative to peers? ” Over time, the investor will also need to know: “How will I be able to tell if my fund is doing what the investment manager said it would do?” Russell has developed the Russell Target Date Metric (TDM) 2 to meet this need. Russell has long been a leader in {{performance measure}}ment and benchmarking. The TDM i...|$|R
40|$|Research {{and policy}} on {{financing}} old age in Australia has focused very heavily upon superannuation {{as a major}} income source. The focus of policy, marketing and interest in superannuation {{has been on the}} worker during the accumulation phase of superannuation scheme membership. This is exemplified by the papers delivered at this symposium over the years, the articles in the popular media providing advice on <b>personal</b> <b>investment</b> and retirement <b>planning.</b> With the possible exception of financial planners there has been little corresponding interest in members after they claim their superannuation, and purchase their pension or annuity. This however is where, for most Australians the purpose of superannuation, namely supporting themselves through retirement, really begins. Relatively little is known about • how people manage their income and income streams in retirement • how prepared people are to manage income in retirement and • what happens to the capacity to manage multiple income sources and income streams as people enter advanced old age? This paper focuses on the implications of choice for income management in old ag...|$|R
40|$|The Chinese {{diaspora}} in the Netherlands {{is undergoing}} a dramatic diversification since the 1990 s. This is manifested sociolinguistically in a shift from Cantonese and traditional character script to Mandarin and simplified characters as default registers of Chinese. Young people of Chinese heritage critically respond to and (re-) position themselves against these changes. This paper explores their identity work and language identifications and adopts a view from digital media to this end. Such a view provides insight into the unstable and shifting conditions and contexts of being, speaking and learning Chinese in the diaspora. Theoretically the paper builds on a view of language as practice, translanguaging, repertoires and linguistic citizenship, and revisits Heinz Kloss' notion of “ausbau” as a concept in language policy and planning. Applied to both language and identity, the revisited notion of ausbau is meant to capture the tension between language/identity as an individual, biographic project involving <b>personal</b> <b>investment</b> and <b>planning,</b> and language/identity as a social, historical project sponsored by nations and states (such as the PRC). In the discussion threads that are presented and analysed, both of these poles provoke critical reflection and stancetaking: critique and resistance to the hegemonic power of the PRC's language ausbau, and self-critique {{in the form of}} self-depreciating evaluation of personally accomplished language ausbau. This contribution draws on a recently completed two-year ethnographic study in and around a Chinese complementary school in the Netherlands {{as part of a larger}} funded project investigating discourses of inheritance and identities in four multilingual European settings...|$|R

40|$|<b>Investment</b> <b>planning</b> (as {{one of the}} key {{components}} of financial planning) is seen as an important solution to investment problems and challenges. Previous research however indicated that compare to men, women are not as confident and knowledgeable about financial and investment matters. As a result, women do not conduct <b>investment</b> <b>planning</b> until it is often too late and when they are confronted with a financial crisis or a life predicament such as a divorce or death. Given the lack of research attention focusing on women‟s perceptions of financial and <b>investment</b> <b>planning</b> in South Africa, and in particular the Eastern Cape, the objective of this research is to investigate the factors that influence women‟s Perceived successful <b>investment</b> <b>planning</b> in the Nelson Mandela Bay area. After conducting a comprehensive literature study, seven factors (independent variables) namely Values, Attitudes, Time horizon, Personal life cycle, Risks and Returns, Investment Knowledge, were identified as influencing the Perceived successful <b>investment</b> <b>planning</b> (dependent variable) of women. Various hypotheses were formulated to be tested in the empirical investigation. The validity and reliability of the measuring instrument were tested among 207 respondents. The Exploratory Factor Analysis, as well as the Cronbach‟s alpha coeffient analysis, revelead that <b>Investment</b> knowledge, <b>Personal</b> life cycle and Values are important factors that influence the women‟s Perceived successful <b>investment</b> <b>planning.</b> As a result of these analyses, the hypotheses had to be reformulated. In order to establish whether correlations existed between the various factors investigated in this study, Pearson Product Moment Correlation Coefficients were calculated. Positive correlations were found between all the variables, except between Values and Personal life cycle and between Values and Perceived successful <b>investment</b> <b>planning.</b> To analyse the association in which the effects of the independent variables (<b>Investment</b> knowledge, <b>Personal</b> life cycle and Values) have on the dependent variable (Perceived successful <b>investment</b> <b>planning)</b> of this study, multiple regression analysis was conducted. Only one independent variable emerged as having a significant influence on Perceived successful <b>investment</b> <b>planning</b> of women, namely Investment knowledge. In order to investigate the influence of the various demographic variables on the dependent variable, an Analysis of Variance was performed. No {{significant differences were found between}} the selected demographic variables, namely Age, Ethnic group, Marital status, Education and Investment experience and the independent variables or dependent variable of this study. By investigating the influence of women‟s Perceived successful <b>investment</b> <b>planning,</b> this study has added to the body of knowledge of both financial and <b>investment</b> <b>planning.</b> Based on the empirical results of this study, several recommendations have been made in an attempt to assist women to make better investment decisions and manage their <b>investment</b> <b>planning</b> more effectively...|$|R
