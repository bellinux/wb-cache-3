500|$|Paul Hainault, {{a retired}} <b>professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>engineering</b> from Michigan Technological University, {{promoted}} {{a theory that}} began as a student class project. His hypothesis held that Fitzgerald grounded at 9:30a.m. on November 10 on Superior Shoal. This shoal, charted in 1929, is an underwater mountain {{in the middle of}} Lake Superior about [...] north of Copper Harbor, Michigan. It has sharp peaks that rise nearly to the lake surface with water depths ranging from , making it a menace to navigation. Discovery of the shoal resulted in a change in recommended shipping routes. A seiche, or standing wave, that occurred during the low-pressure system over Lake Superior on November 10, 1975, caused the lake to rise [...] over the Soo Locks's gates to flood Portage Avenue in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, with [...] of water. Hainault's theory held that this seiche contributed to Fitzgerald shoaling [...] of her hull on Superior Shoal, causing the hull to be punctured mid-body. The hypothesis contended that the wave action continued to damage the hull, until the middle third dropped out like a box, leaving the ship held together by the center deck. The stern section acted as an anchor and caused Fitzgerald to come to a full stop, causing everything to go forward. The ship broke apart on the surface within seconds. Compressed air pressure blew a hole in the starboard bow, which sank 18degrees off course. The rear kept going forward with the engine still running, rolled to port and landed bottom up.|$|E

2500|$|Jacot was {{at least}} partly right {{concerning}} vortices. George Vatistas, [...] a researcher and <b>professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>engineering</b> at Concordia in Montreal, {{was the first to}} discover geometrical shapes in the centers of vortices in the lab, and some galaxies have similar central shapes, squares or triangles. Spiral galaxies are, in fact, vortices. Other geometrical shapes have been found in vortices in nature: a hexagon at the South Pole of Saturn's atmosphere observed by Cassini and a pentagon in Hurricane Isabel seen in 2003.|$|E
