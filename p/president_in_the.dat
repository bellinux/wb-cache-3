5|$|In 1951, Evita set her {{sights on}} earning {{a place on}} the ballot as {{candidate}} for vice-president. This move angered many military leaders who despised Evita and her increasing powers within the government. According to the Argentine Constitution, the Vice President automatically succeeds the <b>President</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> event of the President's death. The possibility of Evita becoming <b>president</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> event of Juan Perón's death was not something the military could accept.|$|E
5|$|Although {{he owned}} a number of slaves, and his {{marriage}} to Virginia Shelby had {{left him with a}} good many more, Breckinridge had been a supporter of gradual emancipation and colonization of blacks since his early political career. As the sectional crisis worsened, this led him into several high-profile debates, notably with fellow Kentuckian Robert Wickliffe, the uncle of Robert C. Wickliffe. His support of Abraham Lincoln for <b>president</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> election of 1860 pitted him against his own nephew, Vice President John C. Breckinridge.|$|E

5|$|As the {{sectional}} conflict {{leading up}} to the Civil War escalated, Breckinridge was put in the unusual position of being a slaveholder who opposed slavery. His support of Abraham Lincoln for <b>president</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> election of 1860 put him at odds with his nephew, John C. Breckinridge. The tragic scenario of brother against brother literally played out in Breckinridge's family, with two of his sons joining each side during the war. Following the war, Breckinridge retired to his home in Danville, where he died on December 27, 1871.|$|E

5|$|By July 1803, {{citizens}} of the western states, desiring more representation {{in the federal government}} and intent on breaking the pattern of nominating a Virginians and New Yorkers for most important federal offices, were advocating Breckinridge's nomination as vice <b>president</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1804 presidential election. Thomas Jefferson was expected to be reelected, but most Democratic-Republicans had grown disenchanted with Vice President Aaron Burr; he would not be Jefferson's running mate. Breckinridge's service as Senate floor leader made him a natural choice.|$|E
