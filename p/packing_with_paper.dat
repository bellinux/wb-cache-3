40|$|Intoduction: Sterile gauze {{is one of}} {{the medical}} devices that are often used to prevent infection. Several things, one of them is {{materials}} for packaging, can affect the sterility of gauze. Parchment paper {{is one of the}} packaging materials for sterilization. The study was done to analyze the sterility of gauze <b>packed</b> <b>with</b> parchment <b>paper</b> one layer and three layers on the growth of microorganism. Method: This study was an experimental study with a quasi-experimental design. Samples were 60 gauze <b>packed</b> <b>with</b> one layer parchment paper and 60 gauze <b>packed</b> <b>with</b> three layers of parchment paper. The sterility of sterile gauze tested at weeks 0, 2 and 4. Results: There {{was no significant difference in}} the sterility of gauze <b>packed</b> <b>with</b> 1 layer of parchment paper on the growth of microorganisms at 0, 2, 4 weeks (p = 0. 126). No significant difference in the sterility of sterile gauze <b>packed</b> <b>with</b> 3 layers of parchment paper at 0, 2, 4 weeks (p = 0. 675). There was a significant difference in the sterility of sterile gauze <b>packed</b> <b>with</b> parchment <b>paper</b> 1 layer and 3 layers on the growth of microorganisms (p = 0. 002). Conclusion There is a significant difference of sterile gauze <b>packed</b> <b>with</b> parchment <b>paper</b> 1 layer and 3 layers against the growth of microorganisms. The sterility of the packaged sterile gauze with a layer of parchment paper is better than the three layers...|$|R
5000|$|Ackley's {{pendulum}} used pendulum arms {{of exactly}} 66.25 inches (168.3 cm) in length, from bearing surface to bearing surface, and used turnbuckles {{located in the}} middle of the arms to provide a means of setting the arm length precisely. Ackley recommends masses for the body of the pendulum for various calibers as well; 50 pounds (22.7 kg) for rimfire up through the [...]22 Hornet, 90 pounds (40.9 kg) for [...]222 Remington through [...]35 Whelen, and 150 pounds (68.2 kg) for magnum rifle calibers. The pendulum is made of heavy metal pipe, welded shut at one end, and <b>packed</b> <b>with</b> <b>paper</b> and sand to stop the bullet. The open end of the pendulum was covered in a sheet of rubber, to allow the bullet to enter and prevent material from leaking out.|$|R
50|$|Some while ago, {{when buying}} tea leaves at tea houses, the staff {{would take the}} tea leaves out of a large, foil container, weigh it and then <b>pack</b> it <b>with</b> <b>papers</b> and a plastic bag. This kind of {{packaging}} was not considered very attractive and it would negatively {{affect the quality of}} the tea leaves as they would oxidise quickly, thereby losing their aroma. The packaging of tea leaves has greatly improved since then. Now tea leaves are vacuum-packed in high density plastic <b>packs</b> <b>with</b> fancy packaging. Not only is the quality raised, but the market value of the tea is also increased.|$|R
50|$|One of Yale's {{earliest}} medical graduates was Dr. Asaph Leavitt Bissell of Hanover, New Hampshire, {{who graduated}} in 1815, {{a member of}} the school's second graduating class. Following his graduation, Dr. Bissell moved to Suffield, Connecticut, a tobacco-farming community where his parents came from, and where he practiced as a country physician {{for the rest of his}} life. The saddlebags that Dr. Bissell carried in his practice, <b>packed</b> <b>with</b> <b>paper</b> packets and glass bottles, are today in the school's Medical Historical Library. The original building (at Grove and Prospect) later became Sheffield Hall, part of the Sheffield Scientific School (razed in 1931). In 1860, the school moved to Medical Hall on York Street, near Chapel (this building was razed in 1957). In 1925, the school moved to its current campus, neighboring the hospital. This campus includes the Sterling Hall of Medicine, Boyer Center for Molecular Medicine (1991, designed by Cesar Pelli), Anlyan Center (2003, designed by Payette and Venturi Scott Brown) and the Amistad Building (2007, designed by Herbert Newman).|$|R

It is used in applications where air and water flow are desired as well as when light weight is desired at cost of a solid flat surface. A similar process is used in other materials such as paper to create a low cost <b>packing</b> <b>paper</b> <b>with</b> better supportive properties than flat paper alone.|$|R
40|$|Growing {{worldwide}} {{concerns of}} nitrates and phosphorus in ground water led to research efforts directed towards developing a sorption media for a septic tank drainfield. Extensive {{research has been}} conducted in the past few decades, in order to find suitable media for denitrification with high selectivity towards nitrogen and phosphorus simultaneously. To explore a new design of septic tank underground drainfield with cost-effective, reliable, and longer life expectancy features, material characterization, packed bed column experiments, batch isotherm identification and microcosm study were collectively conducted and presented together in this paper so as to illuminate the potential of a suite of new material mixes. After initial literature review and multi-criteria decision making process, one of the columns was <b>packed</b> <b>with</b> tire crumb, saw dust and sand while the other column was <b>packed</b> <b>with</b> tire crumb, <b>paper</b> and sand. Under the hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 24 hours, samples illustrated treatment efficiencies of greater than 90 % for both the columns for all pollutants of concerns. The batch adsorption isotherm data was fitted in the Langmuir isotherm and Freundlich isotherm models, and adsorption capacity for phosphorus was found to be 34. 4 mg g- 1 Langmuir isotherm.

60|$|We had a sort {{of endless}} band of bottles sliding along an {{inclined}} glass trough made slippery with running water. At one end a girl held them up to the light, put aside any that were imperfect and placed the others in the trough; the filling was automatic; at the other end a girl slipped in the cork and drove it home with a little mallet. Each tank, the little one for the vivifying ingredients and the big one for distilled water, had a level indicator, and inside I had a float arrangement that stopped the slide whenever either had sunk too low. Another girl stood ready with my machine to label the corked bottles and hand them to the three packers, who slipped them into their outer papers and put them, with a pad of corrugated paper between each pair, into a little groove from which they could be made to slide neatly into position in our standard packing-case. It sounds wild, I know, but I believe I was the first man in the city of London to pack patent medicines through the side of the packing-case, to discover there was a better way in than by the lid. Our cases packed themselves, practically; had only to be put into position on a little wheeled tray and when full pulled to the lift that dropped them to the men downstairs, who padded up the free space and nailed on top and side. Our girls, moreover, <b>packed</b> <b>with</b> corrugated <b>paper</b> and matchbook-wood box partitions when everybody else was using expensive young men to pack through the top of the box with straw, many breakages and much waste and confusion.|$|R
