5|$|<b>Promiscuity,</b> {{in which}} {{both males and females}} mate with {{multiple}} partners, also occurs in rodents. In species such as the white-footed mouse, females give birth to litters with multiple paternities. <b>Promiscuity</b> leads to increased sperm competition and males tend to have larger testicles. In the Cape ground squirrel, the male's testes can be 20 percent of its head-body length. Several rodent species have flexible mating systems that can vary between monogamy, polygyny and <b>promiscuity.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{compounds}} can also bind to cCTnC with low affinity: EMD 57033, resveratrol, bepridil, and EGCG. All of these compounds are renowned for their <b>promiscuity,</b> and the biological {{significance of these}} interactions is unknown. In particular, it is unknown how interaction with cCTnC influences the calcium affinity of cNTnC.|$|E
5|$|Conversely, {{some enzymes}} display enzyme <b>promiscuity,</b> having broad {{specificity}} and {{acting on a}} range of different physiologically relevant substrates. Many enzymes possess small side activities which arose fortuitously (i.e. neutrally), which may be the starting point for the evolutionary selection of a new function.|$|E
5|$|Other mating systems, {{including}} polygyny, polyandry, polygamy, polygynandry, and <b>promiscuity,</b> also occur. Polygamous breeding systems {{arise when}} females {{are able to}} raise broods {{without the help of}} males. Some species may use more than one system depending on the circumstances.|$|E
5|$|Cognition {{can also}} be {{affected}} in Wilson's disease. This comes in two, not mutually exclusive, categories: frontal lobe disorder (may present as impulsivity, impaired judgement, <b>promiscuity,</b> apathy and executive dysfunction with poor planning and decision making) and subcortical dementia (may present as slow thinking, memory loss and executive dysfunction, without signs of aphasia, apraxia or agnosia). It is suggested that these cognitive involvements are related and closely linked to psychiatric manifestations of the disease.|$|E
5|$|Anne's {{drug use}} {{results in the}} loss of many of her inhibitions, and the film shows her actions under the influence, {{including}} scenes implying sexual <b>promiscuity.</b> As the film progresses, she is fired from her job and begins selling drugs for Markey. Her brother hangs himself when he learns of her new job, and she is arrested and given a tour of the various psychiatric wards and jails in which drug users end up. Finally, after 50 days in jail, she is released, cleaned up and ready to cooperate with the authorities regarding Markey.|$|E
5|$|Leigh next {{sought the}} role of Blanche DuBois in the West End stage {{production}} of Tennessee Williams's A Streetcar Named Desire and was cast after Williams and the play's producer Irene Mayer Selznick saw her in The School for Scandal and Antigone; Olivier was contracted to direct. The play contained a rape scene and references to <b>promiscuity</b> and homosexuality, and {{was destined to be}} controversial; the media discussion about its suitability added to Leigh's anxiety. Nevertheless, she believed strongly in the importance of the work.|$|E
5|$|Most rodents {{are small}} animals with robust bodies, short limbs, and long tails. They use their sharp incisors to gnaw food, {{excavate}} burrows, and defend themselves. Most eat seeds or other plant material, but some have more varied diets. They {{tend to be}} social animals and many species live in societies with complex ways of communicating with each other. Mating among rodents can vary from monogamy, to polygyny, to <b>promiscuity.</b> Many have litters of underdeveloped, altricial young, while others are precocial (relatively well developed) at birth.|$|E
5|$|Radio is {{the debut}} studio album by American rapper LL Cool J. It was on November 18, 1985, by Def Jam Recordings {{and was the}} record label's first {{full-length}} album release. Radio was recorded during 1984 to 1985 at Chung King House of Metal in New York City and produced primarily by Rick Rubin, who provided a sparse and minimal production style. The album also features a sound punctuated by DJ scratching, often brief samples, and emphasis of the downbeat. LL Cool J's aggressive b-boy lyrics explored themes of inner city culture, teenage <b>promiscuity,</b> and braggadocio raps.|$|E
5|$|The Nazi regime {{promoted}} a liberal {{code of conduct}} regarding sexual matters and was sympathetic to women who bore children out of wedlock. <b>Promiscuity</b> increased as the war progressed, with unmarried soldiers often intimately involved with several women simultaneously. The same {{was the case for}} married women, who liaised with soldiers, civilians or slave labourers. For example, sex was sometimes used as a commodity to obtain better work from a foreign labourer. Pamphlets enjoined German women to avoid sexual relations with foreign workers as a danger to their blood.|$|E
5|$|The {{mating system}} of bears has {{variously}} {{been described as}} a form of polygyny, <b>promiscuity</b> and serial monogamy. During the breeding season, males take notice of females in their vicinity and females become more tolerant of males. A male bear may visit a female continuously {{over a period of several}} days or weeks, depending on the species, to test her reproductive state. During this time period, males try to prevent rivals from interacting with their mate. Courtship may be brief, although in some Asian species, courting pairs may engage in wrestling, hugging, mock fighting and vocalising. Ovulation is induced by mating, which can last up to 30 minutes depending on the species.|$|E
5|$|As {{the years}} pass, the rural area {{gives way to}} a more {{urbanized}} setting. New buildings and highways spring up, more housing developments are built, and the farmers are pushed out. Though much of the wildlife has left and hunting grows increasingly difficult, Tod stays because it is his home range. The other foxes that remain become unhealthy scavengers, and their natures changelife-bonds with their mates are replaced by <b>promiscuity,</b> couples going their separate ways once the mating act is over. The Master has lost most of his own land, and the only dog he owns now is Copper. Each winter they still hunt Tod, and {{in an odd way}} he looks forward to it as the only aspect of his old life that remains.|$|E
5|$|Bats {{employ a}} number of {{reproductive}} strategies. Most species are polygynous, where males mate with multiple females. Male pipistrelle, noctule and vampire bats may claim and defend resources that attract females, such as roost sites, and mate with those females. Males that are unable to claim a site are forced {{to live on the}} periphery where they have less reproductive success. <b>Promiscuity,</b> where both sexes mate with multiple partners, exists in species like the Mexican free-tailed bat and the little brown bat. Nevertheless, there does appear to be bias towards certain males among females in these bats. In a few species, such as the yellow-winged bat and spectral bat, adult males and females form monogamous pairs. Lek mating, where males aggregate and compete for female choice though display, is rare in bats but notably occurs in the highly sexually dimorphic hammer-headed bat (Hypsignathus monstrosus).|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Pandora {{comes out of}} the bathroom, Cook is the only person left at the house. Together they play Twister, which was all Pandora had wanted to do, along with {{learning}} from her friends about human sexuality. Cook offers to have sex with her, and they spend the night together. Effy visits Pandora the next morning, and sees Cook share a kiss with her as he leaves. Feeling hurt, she confronts Pandora, but to no avail, as Pandora is slightly empowered after losing her virginity. Pandora defiantly tells Effy that Cook, due to his <b>promiscuity</b> and impulsive, carnal behavior, belongs to no one. Effy appears to understand, and makes no rebuttal. Suddenly, Thomas appears and runs up to Pandora, and she sobs in his arms as a thoughtful Effy looks on.|$|E
5|$|Divine {{considered}} {{himself to be}} male, and was not transgender or transsexual. He was gay, and during the 1980s had an extended relationship with a married man named Lee, who accompanied him almost everywhere that he went. They later separated, and Divine went on to have a brief affair with gay porn star Leo Ford, which was widely reported upon by the gay press. According to his manager Bernard Jay, Divine regularly engaged in sexual activities with young men that he would meet while on tour, sometimes becoming infatuated with them; in one case, he met {{a young man in}} Israel whom he wanted to bring back to the United States, but was prevented from doing so by Jay. This image of <b>promiscuity</b> was disputed by his friend Anne Cersosimo, who claimed that Divine never exhibited such behavior when on tour. Divine initially avoided informing the media about his sexuality, even when questioned by interviewers, and would sometimes hint that he was bisexual, but {{in the latter part of}} the 1980s changed this attitude and began being open about his homosexuality. Nonetheless, he avoided discussing gay rights, partially at the advice of his manager, realizing that it would have had a negative effect on his career.|$|E
5|$|Specific {{proposed}} high-risk transmission channels, {{allowing the}} virus to adapt to humans and spread throughout the society, depend on the proposed timing of the animal-to-human crossing. Genetic studies of the virus suggest that the most recent common ancestor of the HIV-1 M group dates back to circa 1910. Proponents of this dating link the HIV epidemic {{with the emergence of}} colonialism and growth of large colonial African cities, leading to social changes, including a higher degree of sexual <b>promiscuity,</b> the spread of prostitution, and the concomitant high frequency of genital ulcer diseases (such as syphilis) in nascent colonial cities. While transmission rates of HIV during vaginal intercourse are typically low, they are increased many fold if one of the partners suffers from a sexually transmitted infection resulting in genital ulcers. Early 1900s colonial cities were notable due to their high prevalence of prostitution and genital ulcers to the degree that as of 1928 as many as 45% of female residents of eastern Leopoldville were thought to have been prostitutes and as of 1933 around 15% of all residents of the same city were infected by one of the forms of syphilis.|$|E
25|$|Among the Hominidae, gorillas {{have little}} female <b>promiscuity</b> and sperm {{competition}} and the testes are small compared to body weight (0.03%). Chimpanzees have high <b>promiscuity</b> and large testes compared to body weight (0.3%). Human testicular size falls between these extremes (0.08%).|$|E
25|$|<b>Promiscuity</b> {{is common}} in many animal species. Some species have {{promiscuous}} mating systems, ranging from polyandry and polygyny to mating systems with no stable relationships where mating between two individuals is a one-time event. Many species form stable pair bonds, but still mate with other individuals outside the pair. In biology, incidents of <b>promiscuity</b> in species that form pair bonds are usually called extra-pair copulations.|$|E
25|$|<b>Promiscuity</b> is the {{practice}} of having casual sex frequently with different partners or being indiscriminate {{in the choice of}} sexual partners. The term can carry a moral judgment if the social ideal for sexual activity is monogamous relationships. A common example of behavior viewed as promiscuous by many cultures is the one-night stand, and its frequency is used by researchers as a marker for <b>promiscuity.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{challenges}} generally {{begin with}} Holden's {{frequent use of}} vulgar language, with other reasons including sexual references, blasphemy, undermining of family values and moral codes, encouragement of rebellion, and promotion of drinking, smoking, lying, and <b>promiscuity.</b>|$|E
25|$|The top-10-ranking OECD {{nations with}} a {{population}} over 10million on the study's <b>promiscuity</b> index, in descending order, were the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands, the Czech Republic, Australia, the United States, France, Turkey, Mexico, and Canada.|$|E
25|$|Severe and {{impulsive}} <b>promiscuity,</b> {{along with}} a compulsive urge to engage in illicit sex with attached individuals is a common symptom of borderline personality disorder, histrionic personality disorder and antisocial personality disorder but most promiscuous individuals do not have these disorders.|$|E
25|$|The Housewife's Handbook on Selective <b>Promiscuity</b> by Rey Anthony (real name Maxine Sanini), {{published}} by Ralph Ginzburg (New York Documentary Books, 1962. This book has no ISBN {{because it was}} banned by order of the court; this order has never been lifted).|$|E
25|$|Judaism forbids {{intercourse}} outside marriage (which is termed znut or <b>promiscuity),</b> {{but has no}} {{ideal of}} chastity. Within marriage abstinence is also required during and following a woman's menstruation. The husband {{is not allowed to}} deprive sex from his wife, even if she is not fertile (known as mitzvat onah).|$|E
25|$|Later 20th-century events {{included}} the 1982 broadcast of DPT: Vaccine Roulette, which sparked {{debate over the}} DPT vaccine, and the 1998 publication of a fraudulent academic article by Andrew Wakefield which sparked the MMR vaccine controversy. Also recently, the HPV vaccine has become controversial due to concerns that it may encourage <b>promiscuity</b> when given to 11- and 12-year-old girls.|$|E
25|$|Ferguson {{emphasised}} that Fred, {{before meeting}} Rose, had committed {{at least one}} murder strikingly similar to those at issue in the present trial, and that the prosecution's case was largely circumstantial. He contended that Rose {{was unaware of the}} extent of Fred's sadism, and urged the jury to not be prejudiced by her <b>promiscuity</b> and domineering manner.|$|E
25|$|Little {{is known}} about Hawtrey's early years or later private life. He guarded his {{relationships}} very carefully in an era (lasting until 1967 in the UK) when male homosexual behaviour was illegal and punishable by a prison sentence. His outrageous drunken <b>promiscuity</b> did not attract sympathy, nor did his general peevish demeanour and increasing eccentricity earn him many (if any) close friends.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, a U.S. {{university}} {{study of}} international <b>promiscuity</b> found that Finns {{have had the}} largest number of sex partners in the industrialized world, and British people have the largest number among big western industrial nations. The study measured one-night stands, attitudes to casual sex, and number of sexual partners. A 2014 nationwide survey in the United Kingdom named Liverpool the country's most promiscuous city.|$|E
25|$|The {{remarkable}} reactivity and substrate <b>promiscuity</b> of P450s {{have long}} {{attracted the attention}} of chemists. Recent progress towards realizing the potential of using P450s towards difficult oxidations have included: (i) eliminating the need for natural co-factors by replacing them with inexpensive peroxide containing molecules, (ii) exploring the compatibility of P450s with organic solvents, and (iii) the use of small, non-chiral auxiliaries to predictably direct P450 oxidation.|$|E
25|$|Evolutionary psychologists {{hold that}} {{behaviors}} or traits that occur universally in all cultures are good candidates for evolutionary adaptations including the abilities to infer others' emotions, discern kin from non-kin, identify and prefer healthier mates, and cooperate with others. They report successful tests of theoretical predictions related to {{such topics as}} infanticide, intelligence, marriage patterns, <b>promiscuity,</b> perception of beauty, bride price, and parental investment.|$|E
25|$|He is {{considered}} a literary iconoclast and, alongside William S. Burroughs and Allen Ginsberg, a pioneer of the Beat Generation. Kerouac is recognized for his method of spontaneous prose. Thematically, his work covers topics such as Catholic spirituality, jazz, <b>promiscuity,</b> Buddhism, drugs, poverty, and travel. He became an underground celebrity and, with other beats, a progenitor of the hippie movement, although he remained antagonistic toward some of its politically radical elements.|$|E
25|$|Many writers, {{including}} Thomas Jefferson, {{supported and}} legitimized African colonization {{by arguing that}} tropical climates made peoples uncivilized. Jefferson argued that tropical climates encouraged laziness, relaxed attitudes, <b>promiscuity</b> and generally degenerative societies, while the frequent variability in the weather of the middle and northern latitudes led to stronger work ethics and civilized societies. Adolf Hitler also made use of this theory to extol the supremacy of the Nordic race.|$|E
25|$|Evidence for {{an effect}} of AVP on monogamy vs <b>promiscuity</b> comes from {{experimental}} studies in several species, which indicate that the precise distribution of vasopressin and vasopressin {{receptors in the brain}} is associated with species-typical patterns of social behavior. In particular, there are consistent differences between monogamous species and promiscuous species in the distribution of AVP receptors, and sometimes in the distribution of vasopressin-containing axons, even when closely related species are compared.|$|E
25|$|The community, {{while in}} theory {{should be more}} liberal than other {{communities}} in Western and Southern Asia, has some paternal aspects that clash with liberal western youth values. A number of second generation have commented on how their first generation parents tend to look down on many elements of western youth culture (binge drinking, illegal drugs, <b>promiscuity,</b> etc.), and issues such as mental illness, homophobia, and misogyny have often received minor vocal opposition from first generation Sri Lankans.|$|E
25|$|A nonscientific survey {{conducted}} in 2007 by condom-maker Durex measured <b>promiscuity</b> by a {{total number of}} sexual partners. The survey found Austrian men had {{the highest number of}} sex partners of males globally with 29.3 sexual partners on average. New Zealand women had the highest number of sex partners for females in the world with an average of 20.4 sexual partners. In all of the countries surveyed, except New Zealand, men reported more sexual partners than women.|$|E
25|$|The sonnet is a {{confession}} of the poets committed sins and <b>promiscuity,</b> which quickly escalates to his confession of love {{to the young}} man. With Shakespeare's heavy use of double meanings to words have scholars perplexed {{as to whether the}} sonnet is about Shakespeare's career as an actor or {{a confession}} of love to the young man. The sonnet is written in traditional Shakespearean sonnet form consisting of 14 lines with Iambic Pentameter and ending with a couplet.|$|E
