40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we present new {{concurrent}} and re-coverable B-link-tree algorithms. Unlike previous algorithms, ours maintain {{the balance of}} the B-link tree at all times, so that a logarithmic time bound for a search or an update operation is guaranteed under arbitrary sequences of record insertions and deletions. A database transaction can contain any number of operations of the form “fetch the first (or next) matching record”, “insert a record”, or “delete a record”, where database records are identified by their primary keys. Repeatable-read-level isolation for transactions is guaranteed by key-range locking. The algorithms apply the write-ahead logging (WAL) protocol and the steal and no-force buffering policies for in-dex and data pages.

40|$|Abstract: The B±tree is {{the most}} widely used index {{structure}} in the current commercial database systems. This paper introduces new B±tree algorithms in which tree-structure modifications such as <b>page</b> <b>splits</b> or merges are executed as atomic actions. A B±tree structure modification, once executed to completion will never be undone no matter if the transaction that triggered such a structure modification commits or aborts later on. In restart recovery from a system crash, the redo pass of the recovery algorithm will always produce a structurally consistent B±tree, on which undo operations by backward-rolling transactions can be performed. A database transaction can contain any number of operations of the form “fetch the first (or next) matching record”, “insert a record”, or “delete a record”, where database records are identified by their primary keys.

40|$|As {{traffic on}} the World Wide Web increases, more power is needed to serve web pages. But large, {{powerful}} servers are expensive and proprietary. An alternative is to split up the task of serving web pages between multiple, smaller servers.

In this paper we propose a distributed packet rewriting system. In this system, not only is the task of serving web <b>pages</b> <b>split</b> between the servers, but so is the task of routing packets. Incoming requests are initially distributed between servers using round-robin DNS; then the web servers themselves route connections as necessary to balance the load more equally. We use an adaptive non-uniform hashing function in routing connections. The use of this function guarantees even load distribution, and allows for both new servers entering the system and server capacities changing due to load or outage, with no downtime. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{external}} multi-dimensional access methods, Forced Splitting is {{an approach}} used to ensure that, when a <b>page</b> <b>splits,</b> no sub-tree {{of the page}} belongs under both halves, thereby guaranteeing that only one path from the root need be searched to find any point in the tree. This reduces occupancy of forcibly <b>split</b> <b>pages,</b> possibly down to single entries in pathological cases. Freeston introduced a novel approach to obtaining the benefits of forced splitting while avoiding the negative consequences for a class of access methods he called BV-Trees. Perhaps because of its rather abstract presentation {{and the lack of}} complete algorithm descriptions, we believe that this idea has not achieved the recognition it deserves. We present a different view of the BV-Tree concept {{in terms of what we}} call Virtual Forced Splitting (VFS), show how the semantics of a VFS tree can be understood by its relationship to a much simpler Forced Split tree obtained by reduction from the VFS tree. This allows an explanation of the complex issue of demotion; a requirement for correct implementation that is acknowledged but not discussed in the literature before now. We show how various multi-dimensional algorithms such as k-Nearest Neighbour and Range Search can be effectively implemented on such trees, and, finally, discuss our own implementation of a BV-Tree, and report performance results in comparison to the R*-Tree. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{develop new}} {{algorithms}} {{for the management}} of transactions in a page-shipping client-server database system in which the physical database is organized as a sparse B-tree index. Our starvation-free fine-grained locking protocol combines adaptive callbacks with key-range lock-ing and guarantees repeatable-read-level isolation (i. e., serializability) for transactions containing any number of record insertions, record deletions, and key-range scans. Partial and total roll-backs of client transactions are performed by the client. Each structure modification such as a <b>page</b> <b>split</b> or merge is defined as an atomic action that affects only two levels of the B-tree and is logged using a single redo-only log record, so that the modification never needs to be un-done during transaction rollback or restart recovery. The steal-and-no-force buffering policy is applied by the server when flushing updated pages onto disk and by the clients when shipping updated data pages to the server, while pages involved in a structure modification are forced to the server when the modification is finished. The server performs the restart recovery from client and system failures using an ARIES/CSA-based recovery protocol. Our algorithms avoid access-ing stale data but allow a data page to be updated by one client transaction and read by many other client transactions simultaneously, and updates may migrate from a data page to anothe...|$|R

If π is a smooth R[G]-representation, {{the space of}} invariants π^U is a right module over the Hecke algebra H of U in G. Let P be a parabolic subgroup of G with a Levi decomposition P = MN adapted to U. We complement previous investigation of Ollivier-Vignéras on the relation between taking U-invariants and various functor like Ind_P^G and right and left adjoints. More precisely the authors' previous work with Herzig introduce representations I_G(P,σ,Q) where σ is a smooth representation of M extending, trivially on N, to a larger parabolic subgroup P(σ), and Q is a parabolic subgroup between P and P(σ). Here we relate I_G(P,σ,Q) ^U to an analogously defined H-module I_H(P,σ^U_M,Q), where U_M = U∩ M and σ^U_M {{is seen as a}} module over the Hecke algebra H_M of U_M in M. In the reverse direction, if V is a right H_M-module, we relate I_H(P,V,Q) ⊗c-Ind_U^G 1 to I_G(P,V⊗_H_Mc-Ind_U_M^M 1,Q). As an application we prove that if R is an algebraically closed field of characteristic p, and π is an irreducible admissible representation of G, then the contragredient of π is 0 unless π has finite dimension.

40|$|Abstract This paper {{provides}} a comprehensive treatment of index management in transaction systems. We present a method, called ARIESIIM (A/gorlthm for Recovery and /so-/atIon Exploiting Semantics forlndex Management), for concurrency control and recovery of B +-trees. ARI ES/lM guarantees serializability and uses write-ahead logging for recovery. K supports very high concurrency and good performance by (1) treating as the lock {{of a key}} the same lock as {{the one on the}} corresponding record data in a data page (e. g., at the record level), (2) not acquiring, in the interest of permitting very high concurrency, commit duration locks on index pages even during index structure modification operations (SMOS) like <b>page</b> <b>splits</b> and <b>page</b> deletions, and (3) allowing retrievals, inserts, and deletes to go on concurrently with SMOS. During restart recovery, any necessary redos of index changes are always performed in a pageoriented fashion (i. e., without traversing the index tree) and, during normal processing and restart recovery, whenever possible undos are performed in a page-oriented fashion. ARIES/lM permits different granularities of locking to be supported in a flexible manner. A subset of ARIES/lM has been implemented in the 0 S/ 2 Extended Edition Database Manager. 1 Since the locking ideas of ARIES/lM have general applicability, some of them have also been implemented in SQUDS and the VM Shared File System, even though those systems use the shadow-page technique for recovery. 1...|$|R
