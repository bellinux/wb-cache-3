In this paper {{we present a}} performance comparison of three distinct EUL scheduling schemes (one-by-one, partial <b>parallel</b> and <b>full</b> <b>parallel)</b> taking into account both the packet level characteristics and the flow level dynamics due to the (random) user behaviour. Using a very efficient hybrid analytical and simulation approach we analyse the three schemes with respect to performance measures such as mean file transfer time and fairness. In UMTS, {{a significant part of the}} system capacity will be used to support non-elastic voice traffic. Hence, part of our investigation is dedicated to the effects that the volume of voice traffic has on the performance of the elastic traffic supported by the EUL. Finally, we evaluate the impact that implementation specifics of a <b>full</b> <b>parallel</b> scheduler has on these measures. Our main conclusion is that our partial parallel scheduler, which is a hybrid between the one-by-one and <b>full</b> <b>parallel,</b> outperforms the other two schedulers in terms of mean flow transfer time, and is less sensitive to volume and nature of voice traffic.

The critical obstacle size to generate a compressed plasma region ahead of these objects is determined by independently varying {{the magnitude of the}} dipolar magnetic moment and the plasma magnetization. We find that the effective size of the obstacle depends on the relative orientation between the dipolar and plasma internal magnetic fields, and we show that this may be critical to form a shock in small-scale structures.

But it causes the zero-sequence circulating-current (ZSCC), which brings current discrepancy, current waveform distortion, power losses, and electromagnetic interference (EMI), etc. The paper proposes a new topology of full power converters which are composed of n full power converters. The n converters have the same structures and are in parallel with each other. Besides, the average models of the system are analyzed and the fundamental mechanism of ZSCC generation is given. Based on the above analysis, the control strategy of the system is designed. The simulation and experiment results of two <b>parallel</b> <b>full</b> power converters show the feasibility of the proposed theory and control scheme.

40|$|Abstract. Optimization {{problems}} {{constrained by}} nonlinear partial differential equations {{have been the}} focus of intense research in scientific computing lately. Current methods for the parallel numerical solution of such problems involve sequential quadratic programming (SQP), with either reduced or full space approaches. In this paper we propose and investigate a class of <b>parallel</b> <b>full</b> space SQP Lagrange-Newton-Krylov-Schwarz (LNKSz) algorithms. In LNKSz, a Lagrangian functional is formed and differentiated to obtain a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) system of nonlinear equations. Inexact Newton method with line search is then applied. At each Newton iteration the linearized KKT system is solved with a Schwarz preconditioned Krylov subspace method. We apply LNKSz to the parallel numerical solution of some boundary control problems of two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. Numerical results are reported for different combinations of Reynolds number, mesh size and number of parallel processors. ...|$|R

In this talk, we show first steps towards afull equivalence between PFASST and classical multigrid schemes. We showthat, under certain assumptions, the PFASST algorithm can be conveniently andrigorously described as a multigrid-in-time. Since multigrid methods wherestudied extensively in the past, a lot can be gained from this equivalence fora better understanding of PFASST.

PFASST is based on intertwining SDC iterations with differing resolution in a manner similar to the Parareal algorithm and uses a Full Approximation Scheme (FAS) correction to improve the accuracy of coarser SDC iterations. It is demonstrated that SDC and PFASST can generate highly accurate solutions, and the performance in terms of function evaluations required for a certain accuracy is analyzed and compared to a standard Runge–Kutta method...|$|R

Several factors that affect the performance of a parallel I/O application in this type of computing environment are discussed. The advantages of a workstation cluster are its large combined I/O buffer capacity, and possible concurrent accesses to disks local to each workstation.

40|$|A new small {{full bridge}} module for MMCC {{research}} is presented. Each {{full bridge converter}} cell is a single small (65 × 30 mm) multilayer PCB with two low voltage high current (22 V, 40 A) integrated half bridge ICs and the necessary isolated control signals and auxiliary power supply (2500 V isolation). All devices are surface mount, minimising cell height (4 mm) and parasitic inductance. Each converter cell can be physically stacked with PCB connectors propagating the control signals and inter-cell power connections. Many cells can be trivially stacked to create a large multilevel converter leg with isolated auxiliary power and control signals. Any of the MMCC family members is then easily formed. With a change in placement of stacking connector, a parallel connection of bridges is also possible.

The scheduling schemes are evaluated and compared under different approaches for reserving part of the allowed noise rise at the base station for inter-cell interference. For our analysis, we have developed a hybrid analytical/simulation approach allowing for fast evaluation of performance measures such as the mean flow transfer time and fairness expressing how the performance depends on the user’s location.
