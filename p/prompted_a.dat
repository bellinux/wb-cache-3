5|$|Treasure {{hunters have}} {{sought out the}} Eshmun Temple since antiquity; around 1900 {{artifacts}} bearing Phoenician inscriptions from the temple site {{found their way to}} Beirutine antiquities markets where they stirred the interest of the Ottoman authorities and <b>prompted</b> <b>a</b> series of archeological digs.|$|E
5|$|As one of {{the larger}} towns in the French Basque Country, Bayonne had been {{one of the}} main bases of ETA {{organisation}} there. From 1975 onwards this had <b>prompted</b> <b>a</b> reaction from anti-ETA groups. In April 1975, Mugalde, a Basque bookshop in the town, was bombed, though no one was injured. On 25 June 1979, Enrique Gómez Álvarez, an alleged ETA member, was killed by the Batallón Vasco Español (BVE), a right-wing paramilitary group active since 1975.|$|E

5|$|During {{his major}} league career, Wiggins {{struggled}} with drug addiction, {{which resulted in}} multiple arrests and suspensions from baseball. His drug problems <b>prompted</b> <b>a</b> 1985 trade from San Diego to Baltimore, where Wiggins spent three seasons. After leaving baseball, {{he was diagnosed with}} AIDS. He was the first MLB player known to die of AIDS. Long after his death, two of Wiggins' children, Candice and Alan, Jr., became professional basketball players.|$|E
5|$|Following these events, Bourassa {{proclaimed that}} a {{referendum}} would occur in 1992, with either sovereignty {{or a new}} Constitutional agreement as the subject. This <b>prompted</b> <b>a</b> national referendum on the Charlottetown Accord of 1992, a series of amendments that included the proposals of Meech Lake as well as concerns of the broader Canadian federation. The Accord failed in Quebec and English Canada.|$|E
5|$|Fort Steuben Bridge's replacement, the Veterans Memorial Bridge, was {{completed}} in 1990. The Ohio Department of Transportation capped funding for maintaining the Fort Steuben Bridge in 1998 at around $200,000 (US$ with inflation) per year. The Fort Steuben Bridge was weight-restricted in 2006 due to the weakening of the structure over time. The assessment <b>prompted</b> <b>a</b> weight limit; reducing the bridge's traffic which consisted of heavy trucks. The bridge {{was known to be}} affected by rain vibration.|$|E

This <b>prompted</b> <b>a</b> long guerrilla war and {{the assassination of the}} party's leader, Ruben Um Nyobé. In the more peaceful British Cameroons, the question was whether to reunify with French Cameroun or join Nigeria.|$|E
5|$|In 1846, the Andover workhouse scandal, where {{conditions}} in the Andover Union Workhouse {{were found to be}} inhumane and dangerous, <b>prompted</b> <b>a</b> government review and the abolition of the Poor Law Commission which was replaced with a Poor Law Board which meant that a Committee of Parliament was to administer the Poor Law, with a cabinet minister as head. Despite this another scandal occurred over inhumane treatment of paupers in the Huddersfield workhouse.|$|E
5|$|In April 2007, {{a case of}} {{copyright}} infringement was filed on the film's producer and director that <b>prompted</b> <b>a</b> court to stall the screening of the film.

5|$|In {{addition}} to legislative reform, the breaching of coastal flood defense systems during Vera <b>prompted</b> <b>a</b> redesign of such mechanisms. In Nagoya, regulation {{was created for}} coastal construction and their heights. Development of flood defenses in Ise, Osaka, and Tokyo bays was also set into motion. The heights of such defense systems were based on worst-case scenarios and maximum storm surge heights caused by the typhoon.|$|E
5|$|The French {{departure}} <b>prompted</b> <b>a</b> mass {{exodus of}} the American militia, significantly shrinking the American force. On 24 August, Sullivan was alerted by General George Washington that Clinton was assembling a relief force in New York. That evening his council {{made the decision}} to withdraw to positions on {{the northern part of the}} island. Sullivan continued to seek French assistance, dispatching Lafayette to Boston to negotiate further with d'Estaing.|$|E
5|$|The breach between Antony and Octavian <b>prompted</b> <b>a</b> {{large portion}} of the Senators, as well as both of that year's consuls, to leave Rome and defect to Antony. However, Octavian {{received}} two key deserters from Antony in the autumn of 32BC: Munatius Plancus and Marcus Titius. These defectors gave Octavian the information that he needed to confirm with the Senate all the accusations that he made against Antony.|$|E

He and his wife Louise were prominent in Cleveland society; while she was {{a leader of the}} women's suffrage movement, his store (located in Public Square downtown) was significant enough that its destruction by fire in 1882 <b>prompted</b> <b>a</b> front-page story in the New York Times.|$|E
5|$|The {{season ended}} with a few more matches against English counties. Miller struck {{aggressive}} half-centuries in wins against Nottinghamshire and Leveson-Gower's XI. In first-class matches, Miller had scored 725 runs at 72.50 for the season, finishing second in both averages and aggregates. The success of the Australian Services <b>prompted</b> <b>a</b> fundraising tour of India and Ceylon on their return to Australia.|$|E
5|$|The {{uncritical}} {{acceptance of}} Price's reports <b>prompted</b> <b>a</b> formal {{study by the}} Society for Psychical Research (SPR), which rejected most of the sightings as either imagined or fabricated and cast doubt on Price's credibility. His claims are now generally discredited by ghost historians. Neither the SPR's report nor the more recent biography of Price has quelled public interest in these stories, and new books and television documentaries continue to satisfy public fascination with the rectory.|$|E

5|$|A 1983 {{industry}} crash, {{caused by}} the market being overrun with low-quality products, <b>prompted</b> <b>a</b> higher degree of regulation by future console manufacturers: when the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) was launched in the United States in 1985, Nintendo of America instituted requirements and restrictions on third-party developers, including the requirement for all games to be licensed by the company. The console itself also included a lockout chip to enforce this requirement and prevent the console from loading unlicensed games. Such leverage on developers has since become a standard practice among console makers, although Nintendo of America also had stringent content policies, frequently censoring blood, sexual content, and references to religion, tobacco and alcohol from games released on its consoles in the United States.|$|E
5|$|A {{major problem}} was that of loss of feed {{material}} and product. Only 1 part in 5,825 of the feed material became finished product. About 90 percent was splattered over the feed bottles or vacuum tanks. The problem was particularly acute with the enriched feed of the Beta calutrons. Extraordinary {{efforts were made to}} recover product, including burning the carbon receiver liners to recover the uranium in them. Despite everything, some 17.4 percent of Alpha product and 5.4 percent of Beta product was lost. Frank Spedding from the Manhattan Project's Ames Laboratory and Philip Baxter from the British Mission were sent to advise on improvements to recovery methods. The death of a worker from exposure to phosgene also <b>prompted</b> <b>a</b> search for a safer production process.|$|E
5|$|All the Kimberella fossils {{found so}} far are {{assigned}} to one species, K. quadrata. The first specimens were discovered in Australia in 1959. They were originally classified as jellyfish by Martin Glaessner and Mary Wade in 1966, and then as box jellyfish by Wade in 1972, a view that remained popular until the fossils of the White sea region were discovered; these <b>prompted</b> <b>a</b> reinterpretation. Research on these specimens by Mikhail A. Fedonkin, initially with Benjamin M. Waggoner in 1997, led to Kimberella being recognised as the oldest well-documented triploblastic bilaterian organism — not a jellyfish at all.|$|E
