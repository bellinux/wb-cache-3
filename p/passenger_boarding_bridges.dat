50|$|A new {{split-level}} {{passenger terminal}} building, which separates arrivals and departures vertically, a new pier with eight boarding gates, and 14 <b>passenger</b> <b>boarding</b> <b>bridges,</b> with a dedicated gate comprising two <b>passenger</b> <b>boarding</b> <b>bridges</b> {{for the new}} Airbus A380, {{will be included in}} the proposed new complex. There would also be a remote apron and an additional nine parking stands to ease air traffic movement. There would be a tax-free apparel shopping mall at the Katunayake BOI Zone to attract more business visitors to Sri Lanka. The mall is to be adjacent to the arrival terminal and connected by a sky bridge.|$|E
50|$|Terminal 2 {{is planned}} {{to open in}} 2019. It is planned to have 8 gates, with arrival and {{departure}} areas separated vertically. A new terminal with eight more gates is proposed to be built under Stage II of the Phase II Expansion Project. Construction of the new Stage II, Phase II Expansion Project was commenced in April 2017 {{and is expected to}} be completed in 2019. A new pier with eight boarding gates and 14 <b>passenger</b> <b>boarding</b> <b>bridges,</b> with an additional gate comprising two <b>passenger</b> <b>boarding</b> <b>bridges</b> for the Airbus A380, will be included in the proposed new development.|$|E
50|$|Aircraft and <b>Passenger</b> <b>Boarding</b> <b>Bridges</b> Maintenance, Pilot Operations, Commissioning, Training Services, {{aircraft}} rental, and hangar rental {{are most}} often performed by a fixed-base operator (FBO). At major airports, particularly those used as hubs, airlines may operate their own support facilities.|$|E
50|$|There is also {{software}} available {{which is}} specially used for airside planning, design and operations. This type of software includes comprehensive aircraft and <b>passenger</b> <b>boarding</b> <b>bridge</b> libraries together with additional {{features such as}} servicing points for aircraft, jet blast and safe working area calculation, airport specific vehicles, animation capabilities {{and the ability to}} create unusual vehicles from scratch.|$|R
5000|$|The laser, {{which has}} a pulse {{frequency}} of 9.6 kHz and a resolution of 1 cm, ensures that the pilot can stop in the exact stopping position. The system can be connected with the <b>passenger</b> <b>boarding</b> <b>bridge,</b> apron management system or other airport systems via TCP/IP or Ethernet connections. It can also be equipped with a back-up traffic light system.|$|R
50|$|A {{jet bridge}} (also termed jetway, gangway, aerobridge/airbridge, air jetty, portal, skybridge or its {{official}} industry name <b>passenger</b> <b>boarding</b> <b>bridge</b> (PBB)) is an enclosed, movable connector which most commonly extends from an airport terminal gate to an airplane, {{and in some}} instances from a port to a boat or ship, allowing <b>passengers</b> to <b>board</b> and disembark without going outside or being exposed to the elements. Depending on building design, sill heights, fueling positions, and operational requirements, a jet bridge may be fixed or movable, swinging radially and/or extending in length. The jetway was invented by Frank Der Yuen.|$|R
50|$|In {{recent years}} the Airport has {{substantially}} completed several projects: the refurbishment of its primary runway (11/29), piping of an open ditch parallel to that runway, and completion of two phases of the Terminal Renovation project. Three <b>passenger</b> <b>boarding</b> <b>bridges</b> have been installed.|$|E
50|$|Its {{container}} department produces dry freight containers, refrigerated containers, {{special containers}} and other containers. CIMC also offers road transport vehicles, including logistics vehicles, tanker trailers and construction vehicles. In addition, the Company designs and manufactures <b>passenger</b> <b>boarding</b> <b>bridges</b> and cargo handling systems for airports. Based in Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, CIMC is also {{engaged in the}} real estate industry through its subsidiaries.|$|E
5000|$|... "The project {{includes}} {{construction of}} a one-story building addition of approximately 7,400 square feet at {{the west end of}} the terminal building for a checked baggage screening facility and expanded outbound baggage handling system; renovation of approximately 11,200 square feet at the east end of the terminal building for public lobby improvements, expanded passenger security screening checkpoint, tenant office improvements, and concessions. It includes a two-story addition of approximately 33,000 square feet {{at the south end of}} the terminal building for aircraft boarding gates with <b>passenger</b> <b>boarding</b> <b>bridges,</b> passenger holdrooms, public lobbies, restrooms, concessions, airline operations, and mechanical and electrical equipment rooms; renovation of approximately 5,000 square feet at the south end of the terminal building for aircraft boarding gate and passenger holdroom improvements. It includes the replacement of HVAC central plant equipment which has reached the end of its useful life; and refurbishment of five existing <b>passenger</b> <b>boarding</b> <b>bridges.</b> Site work includes replacement of portions of the aircraft apron as required for building construction, underground utilities work, and apron drainage, and pavement marking and striping for aircraft positions and service vehicle lanes. The project includes a phased construction program and temporary facilities and provisions necessary to support ongoing airport operations during construction.|$|E
50|$|However, as {{the airport}} has {{continued}} to incrementally expand through its modern history, some of the original architectural intent of the Concourse A-B complex has been lost. While several expansions to the concourse matched and extended the original architectural style of the building, other additions have altered the original architecture. In 1974, a second floor was added to both Concourses A and B {{to allow for the}} implementation of <b>passenger</b> <b>boarding</b> <b>bridge</b> access to aircraft. The new floors, while sharing some material commonality with the original Heylman and Trogdon concourse, lacked the curvy and sculpted neo-expressionistic forms found in the former. The later additions of the ground transportation facility and Concourse C {{to the ends of the}} concourse building further altered the original architecture by replacing its distinct bookend elevations and entrances with corridors to the adjacent buildings. Interior renovations in the mid-2000s also removed a large amount of the original sculpted forms and monolithic materials of the Concourse A-B complex, replaced in favor of more rectilinear forms and contemporary finish materials. Despite this, a number of original architectural elements remain and are largely integral to the space today (such as the exposed concrete roof trusses and concrete columns), creating a juxtaposition between the newer elements and the original architecture.|$|R
5000|$|Further {{expansion}} {{was completed}} in 2013. Expansions have increased terminal capacity, improved the passenger experience through introduction of travelators, lounges, and retail, {{increased the number of}} gates available for aircraft and improved apron capacity among other improvements. Functional highlights include seven new <b>passenger</b> gates, 14 <b>boarding</b> <b>bridges,</b> six new elevators and moving walkways, over 100 security doors, and advanced baggage handling and scanning systems. Incremental improvements like improving de-icing capacity and implementing common use systems for airlines were also delivered. The Renaissance Hotel and the iconic snow-drift inspired control and office tower are recent major additions to the airport landscape.|$|R

50|$|The {{terminal}} is {{fitted with}} air conditioning, fire protection and emergency power generating systems. It is also equipped with six passenger lifts, one freight lift, three escalators and a baggage handling system. Three {{out of the}} six <b>passenger</b> <b>boarding</b> <b>bridges</b> can handle modern Boeing 747-400 aircraft. There is sufficient space for ten aircraft to anchor, and {{at a rate of}} 8 minutes per plane, aircraft of any size and make can touch down or take off to any destination abroad. MAGS (Mandalay Airport Ground Services) provides both passenger and cargo aircraft ground services.|$|E
50|$|Terminal 1 is {{used for}} {{domestic}} flights. This was the original Santacruz building that was once used for international and domestic operations and was previously known as 1B. It was refurbished several times over the decades, the most recent being during the 2000s. It is used by SpiceJet, GoAir and IndiGo. The terminal has 11 <b>passenger</b> <b>boarding</b> <b>bridges.</b> MIAL renamed the T1B to T1 in January 2017 to help fliers identify it easily. Several airlines operate airconditioned Cerita buses owned by BEST to ferry passengers between the terminal and aircraft.|$|E
5000|$|In November 2007, the new 1,000 m2 {{terminal}} building was opened for operations which improved the capacity and facilities {{of the airport}} and complies {{with the requirements of}} the Schengen agreement. [...] The passenger throughput of the terminal increased, passenger service quality was improved and more stringent aviation security measures were implemented. The new area of the renovated passenger terminal now reaches 3,462 m2. It is equipped with 6 <b>passenger</b> <b>boarding</b> <b>bridges,</b> modern passenger check-in equipment, new travel value and duty-free shops were opened as well as business lounge and VIP Lounge.|$|E

Approximately 247,500 m2 {{were built in}} the first phase, in addition to 11 fixed <b>passenger</b> <b>boarding</b> <b>bridges</b> serving 15 gates out of an original design capacity of 31 fixed boarding bridges. At the present time only 7 out of 11 boarding bridges can be used for international flight arrivals as the southern section of the terminal that hosts the remaining four gates is still unused making those gates unconnected to passport control and customs, however since domestic flights are entirely running from the operating northern section, all eleven boarding bridges can be used for domestic flights as well as the departures of international flights.|$|E
50|$|As {{the storm}} made {{landfall}} in Taiwan, {{almost the entire}} island suspended services as high winds and rains triggered flooding in several locations. Almost 70 inches fell in some areas, ranking Saola within the top 5 wettest cyclones to ever hit the island. Authorities ordered schools and business to shut, {{with the exception of}} few major factories. Financial markets were also closed, and would remain until 3 August. Taiwanese Army soldiers rescued more than 1,000 people from remote mountainous villages in the north and east. Two <b>passenger</b> <b>boarding</b> <b>bridges</b> collapsed at Taoyuan International Airport, which serves Taipei, slightly damaging a China Airlines aircraft and forcing the company to scrap the flight. More than 200 international and domestic flight were reportedly cancelled because of the storm.|$|E
5000|$|Terminal 1-C {{was built}} {{at a cost}} of [...] 3 billion and opened in April 2010. Architectural design was {{provided}} by Hafeez Contractor. EDRC, the inhouse design unit of the EPC contractor Larsen & Toubro (L&T) performed the Structural, MEP and IT / Airport systems design. The terminal had 6 <b>passenger</b> <b>boarding</b> <b>bridges</b> and allowed connectivity between terminals 1A and 1B. It was spread over 297,194 sq ft across three levels and had a seating capacity of about 900 passengers. Level 1 housed the offices of MIAL and some airlines, Level 2 comprised the security-hold area for passengers after checking in at either terminal 1A or 1B. Level 3 accommodated a food court. The building served as a boarding-only facility for all airlines. Passengers entered this facility via T1B.|$|E

50|$|In 2000, {{the airport}} {{recorded}} 43,797 {{domestic and international}} flights, carrying 4,443,856 passengers. By the end of April 2011, the airport's terminals handled 11.1 million passengers a year (yoy), exceeding its capacity of 8 million. PT Angkasa Pura I will relocate 35 guest houses to accommodate the expansion, {{which is expected to}} occupy up to 265.5 hectares of land for a new access road to the airport and a new airport building, {{the construction of a new}} flyover, enlarge airport terminal and improve luggage handling system.There have been several plans made seeking a solution to the expansion problems at Ngurah Rai International airport. There have been proposals to develop a north-south runway however existing land use in the areas adjacent to the airport makes this idea unfeasible due to the considerable land purchase costs. A completely new airport was proposed to ease the airport' congestion due to the area surrounding the existing airport not supporting significant long-term expansion. A masterplan was announced for works at this airport for 2009-2011, which includes a new international terminal with 120,000 square meters in area to be built and the existing international terminal with area of 56.000 square meters will be renovated for use as a new domestic terminal. The new international terminal opened in November 2013, while the domestic terminal opened on 17 September 2014 with an area of 65,800 square meters, eight departure and seven arrival gates, five <b>passenger</b> <b>boarding</b> <b>bridges,</b> five conveyor belts, as well as more number of counters — 62 for check-in, 4 for transit and 19 for ticketing. And can accommodate 25 million passengers a year until 2025. This provided land for building a new horseshoe shaped building for 17 passenger aircraft parking at the east area on the former domestic terminal. The plan also incorporated a runway extension to 3,600 m. Currently airplanes up to the size of Boeing 777-300ER, Boeing 747-400 and Boeing 787 Dreamliner can use the airport. Although Ngurah Rai International Airport already has a parking slot for the Airbus A380, some taxiway turns are still being widened to accommodate the superjumbo jet.|$|E
