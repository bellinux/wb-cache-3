40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Wire <b>pre-tension</b> in the Ilizarov {{frame is}} {{considered}} to be important in order to reduce movements that can impair fracture healing. Wires will eventually lose part of their <b>pre-tension,</b> however. In order to gain more insight into the need for wire <b>pre-tension,</b> we investigated: (1) the amount of pre-ten-sion loss, (2) the relationship between <b>pre-tension</b> loss and bolt-tightening torque, (3) the cause of a possible loss of <b>pre-tension,</b> and (4) the effect of <b>pre-tension</b> on cyclic micromotions and total displacement of the bone segments. METHODS: 3 Ilizarov configurations, with various wire <b>pre-tensions</b> and bolt-tightening torques, were tested 3 times with an MTS machine. For each wire, slippage and tensions were measured {{for the duration of the}} whole experiment. RESULTS: A loss of wire <b>pre-tension</b> (up to 75 %) due to slippage was found. Higher bolt-tightening torques significantly reduced the amount of <b>pre-tension</b> loss. Furthermore, a higher wire <b>pre-tension</b> reduced the maximal axial displacement of the bone fragment. There was, however, least cyclic axial micromotion when no wire <b>pre-tension</b> was present [...] probably due to the lack of wire recoil. INTERPRETATION: Wires in an experimental Ilizarov external fixator lose <b>pre-tension</b> within a limited period of time, and probably also in the clinical setting. This does not seem to lead to increased cyclic axial micromotions of the bone fragements. However, the question remains as to how excessive axial displacement of the bone fragment and other loading configurations will affect the process of fracture healing in a patient...|$|R
40|$|Motivated {{by recent}} studies on {{reversible}} adhesion mechanisms of geckos and insects, we investigate {{the effect of}} <b>pre-tension</b> on the orientation-dependent adhesion strength of an elastic tape adhering on a substrate. Our analysis shows that the <b>pre-tension</b> can significantly increase the peel-off force at small peeling angles while decreasing it at large peeling angles, leading to a strongly reversible adhesion. More interestingly, we find that there exists a critical value of <b>pre-tension</b> beyond which the peel-off force plunges to zero at a force-independent critical peeling angle. We further show {{that the level of}} <b>pre-tension</b> required for such force-independent detachment at a critical angle can be induced by simply dragging a spatula pad along a substrate at sufficiently low angles. These results provide a feasible explanation of relevant experimental observations on gecko adhesion and suggest possible strategies to design strongly reversible adhesives via <b>pre-tension...</b>|$|R
40|$|Motivated by {{our earlier}} {{study on the}} effect of <b>pre-tension</b> in gecko adhesion, here we {{investigate}} whether and how <b>pre-tension</b> in cytoskeleton influences cell adhesion by developing a stochastic-elasticity model of a stress fiber attached on a rigid substrate via molecular bonds. By comparing the variations in adhesion lifetime and observing the sequences of bond breaking with and without <b>pre-tension</b> in the stress fiber under the same applied force, we demonstrate that the effect of <b>pre-tension</b> is to shift the interfacial failure mode from cracklike propagation toward uniform bond failure within the contact region, thereby greatly increasing the adhesion lifetime. Since stress fibers are the primary load-bearing components of cells, as well as the basic functional units of cytoskeleton that facilitate cell adhesion, this study suggests a feasible mechanism by which cell adhesion could be actively controlled via cytoskeletal contractility and proposes that <b>pre-tension</b> may be a general principle in biological adhesion...|$|R

A representative case study was constructed to test the feasibility of the method and to reveal the axial performance of both casing and drill string, and corresponding effects on well design, {{before and after the}} application of the <b>pre-tension</b> load.

40|$|In the fiber-reinforced {{composites}} industry {{together with}} the promotion of environmental friendly production, synthetic materials are attempted {{to be replaced by}} renewable, biodegradable and recyclable materials. The most important challenge is to improve strength and durability of these materials. Matrix that supports the fiber-reinforcement in composite generally is brittle and deformation causes fragmentation of the matrix. <b>Pre-tension</b> of reinforcement is a well-known method to increase tensile strength of woven material. The current study develops the idea to use <b>pre-tension</b> of woven fabric in order to improve quality and strength properties of the obtained composite. Natural (cotton fiber) and synthetic (glass fiber) woven fabrics were investigated. The pressure forming operation was carried out in order to study clamping imposed strain variation across the surface of woven fabric. The uniaxial tension test of single-layer composite specimens with and without <b>pre-tension</b> was performed to study the effect of <b>pre-tension</b> on strength properties of composite.

40|$|The {{results of}} fused {{multilayer}} systems <b>pre-tension</b> level upon biaxial loading {{are presented in}} this research work. The values of initial <b>pre-tension</b> of fused multilayer systems in longitudinal and transverse directions were: 0. 0  %, 0. 4  %, 0. 8  %, 1. 2  %, 1. 7  % and 2. 1  %. The results of the investigations have shown that deformational characteristics (F, N and H max, mm) in longitudinal and transverse directions differ {{with the increase of}} <b>pre-tension</b> level. Thus, seam allowances can be defined more accurately in more deformable direction at the stage of product development. Cotton fabric (100  %) of plain weave was used as base material for fused systems. Biaxial tension testing was performed with three types of interlinings: woven, nonwoven and knitted, which differed not only in surface density, but in the density of adhesive layer, which was 52 and 76 dots/cm 2, as well. The samples of fused systems were punched {{from the side of the}} main cotton fabric in order to maintain the same friction force between the punch and the specimen. Obtained results have shown that different number of force peaks, i. e. breakings is characteristic for different fused systems.

Bench vibrations tests (dry tests) and naturally induced vibrations measurements in a wind tunnel are performed on 15 cm wings with different levels of membrane <b>pre-tension,</b> to ascertain the correlation between the reference strain energy and the modal characteristics. Non-contact measurements (using a laser Doppler vibrometer and a visual image correlation system) and base excitation techniques with an electromagnetic shaker are used. The natural frequencies and damping ratios for the elastic membrane are well defined only in the high and low <b>pre-tension</b> cases; the first three frequencies increase with <b>pre-tension</b> while the damping ratio decreases with both <b>pre-tension</b> and mode number.
