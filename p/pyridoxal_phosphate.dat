Protonation of the amine from tryptophan restores the aromaticity of the pyridine ring and then imine is hydrolyzed to produce 5-hydroxytryptamine and PLP.|$|E
25|$|In animals, {{biosynthesis}} of melatonin occurs through hydroxylation, decarboxylation, acetylation and a methylation {{starting with}} L-tryptophan. L-tryptophan {{is produced in}} the shikimate pathway from chorismate or is acquired from protein catabolism.

This intermediate (5-HTP) is decarboxylated by <b>pyridoxal</b> <b>phosphate</b> and 5-hydroxytryptophan decarboxylase to produce serotonin. Serotonin is itself an important neurotransmitter, but is also converted into N-acetylserotonin by serotonin N-acetyltransferase and acetyl-CoA.

Objective: This study investigated sex-associated differences in nutritional risk among community-dwelling, rural older adults and determined whether weight status [body mass index (BMI; in kg/m 2) and waist circumference] was related to other measures of nutri-tional risk. Design: This cross-sectional study explored relations between weight status and nutritional risk, which was determined {{on the basis of the}} Level II Screen, overall diet quality, nutrient intakes, and plasma biomarkers. Results: Of the 179 subjects, 44 % were overweight (BMI 25 – 29. 9) and 35 % were obese (BMI> 30). There were few dif-ferences in nutrient intakes between older men and women after we controlled for energy intake. In women, BMI was directly associated with multiple additional nutritional risk indicators, including the number of Level II items (r = 0. 30), intakes of fat (r = 0. 26) and saturated fat (r = 0. 21), and homocysteine concen-tration (r = 0. 25). Weight status in women was inversely associ-ated with intakes of carbohydrates (r = 0. 25), fiber (r = 0. 35), folate (r = 0. 24), magnesium (r = 0. 29), iron (r = 0. 22), and zinc (r = 0. 23); Healthy Eating Index scores (r = 0. 22); and plasma <b>pyridoxal</b> 5 <b>phosphate</b> (r = 0. 30).

Methanethiol was formed {{only in the}} headspace of the residue {{but not in the}} filtrate or supernatant fractions like dimethyl disulfide. Freeze-thawing, however, suppressed their formation in all homogenate fractions. The immersion of the fresh residue in a liquid medium decreased the concentration of methanethiol which indicates that this compound is highly likely soluble in water and produces only in the headspace of the environment wherein the condition is free of liquid medium. Hence, methanethiol formation was not possible except for dimethyl disulfide after addition of the co-factor, pyridoxal 5 -phosphate, in the frozen residue. Both compounds were also inhibited by aminooxyacetic acid, a potential inhibitor of pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzymes, which indicates that MT and DMDS are produced upon the action of cysteine sulfoxide lyase. This enzyme, which yielded strong activity in the residue upon extraction with buffer containing Triton X- 100, is highly likely to be a bound enzyme.

In addition, the effect of a vitamin B- 6 deficiency on urinary excretion of dC was examined. The effect of a vitamin B- 6 deficiency on the urinary excretion and tissue retention of ³H label from ip injected ³H-dC was monitored. Rats were assigned in groups of six to one of four treatment groups: ad libitum control (ALC), pair fed control (PFC), ad libitum deficient (ALD) or meal fed deficient (MFD). At the end of weeks 2 and 6, rats from each treatment group received an ip injection of ³H-dC. Urines were collected for 24 hours following the ip inhibited due to lack of cofactor, then dTMP levels would fall. In an attempt to increase the concentration of dTMP, enzymes active in the conversion of dC and dCMP to dUMP would be expected to increase. Thus, dC salvage pathways would increase and dC synthesis would decrease as metabolism shifts toward production of deoxythymidine triphosphate (dTTP). The result would be lower urinary dC excretion. The present study was undertaken to explore the relationship between vitamin B- 6 and pyrimidine deoxynucleotide metabolism. There were four hypothesis tested: Vitamin B- 6 deficient rats will excrete less urinary dC than either ad libitum or pair fed controls; vitamin B- 6 deficient rats will excrete a lower percentage of labeled dC in urine than control rats; vitamin B- 6 deficient rats will incorporate less labeled dC into DNA than control rats but may retain more label in tissues as dC metabolites; activity of STHM from tissues of vitamin B- 6 deficient rats will be lower than that from the control rats...|$|R

Lymphocyte proliferation {{in response to the}} mitogens concanavalin A (Con A) and pokeweed mitogen (PWM) was significantly higher (p < 0. 05) at 2. 44 mg than at 0. 84 mg intake and the pre-study value. In Study II, 10 women who consumed their self-selected diets were randomly divided into a PN and a placebo group of five each. Following a 5 -d baseline period, the PN group received a daily supplement of 1. 5 mg (7. 29 μmols) and 50 mg (243 μmols) pyridoxine. HC 1 (PN. HC 1) for 7 and 6 d, respectively. This was followed by a 28 -d washout period during which no supplement or placebo was administered. After daily 1. 5 mg supplementary PN. HC 1 for seven days, lymphocyte proliferation in response to phytohemagglutinin (PHA), Con A and PWM, and IL- 2 production were significantly higher than the baseline (p < 0. 05) and that of the placebo group (p < 0. 05).

40|$|Cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) plays {{a central}} role in {{cysteine}} metabolism, and malfunction of the enzyme leads to homocystinuria, a devastating metabolic disease. CBS contains a <b>pyridoxal</b> 5 ′- <b>phosphate</b> (PLP) cofactor which catalyzes the synthesis of cystathionine from homocysteine and serine. Mammalian forms of the enzyme also contain a heme group, which is not involved in catalysis. It may, however, play a regulatory role, since the enzyme is inhibited when CO or NO are bound to the heme. We have investigated the mechanism of this inhibition using fluorescence and resonance Raman spectroscopies. CO binding is found to induce a tautomeric shift of the PLP from the ketoenamine to the enolimine form. The ketoenamine is key to PLP reactivity because its imine C=N bond is protonated, facilitating attack by the nucleophilic substrate, serine. The same tautomer shift is also induced by heat inactivation of Fe(II) CBS, or by an Arg 266 Met replacement in Fe(II) CBS, which likewise inactivates the enzyme; in both cases the endogenous Cys 52 ligand to the heme is replaced by another, unidentified ligand. CO binding also displaces Cys 52 from the heme. We propose that the tautomer shift results from loss of a stabilizing H-bond from Asn 149 to the PLP ring O 4 atom, which is negatively charged in the ketoenamine tautomer. This loss would be induced by displacement of the PLP as a result of breaking the salt bridge between Cys 52 and Arg 266, which resides on a short helix that is also anchored to the PLP via H-bonds to its phosphate group. The salt bridge would be broken when Cys 52 is displaced from the heme. Cys 52 protonation is inferred to be the rate-limiting step in breaking the salt bridge, since the rate of the tautomer shift, following CO binding, increases with decreasing pH. In addition, elevation of the concentration of phosphate buffer was found to diminish the rate and extent of the tautomer shift, suggesting a ketoenamine-stabilizing phosphate binding site, possibly at the protonated imine bond of the PLP. Implications of these findings for CBS regulation are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Vitamin B 6 {{deficiency}} {{as measured}} by plasma concentrations of <b>pyridoxal</b> 5 ` <b>phosphate</b> (P 5 P), the active form of vitamin B 6, {{has been reported in}} several organ transplant recipients. The highest incidence of vitamin B 6 deficiency has been observed in small bowel transplant recipients. The current study evaluated the potential mechanisms (increased degradation of P 5 P due to higher levels of alkaline phosphatases; or decreased formation of P 5 P due to decreased expression and activity of pyridoxal kinase) that may contribute to such observations. Higher plasma concentrations of alkaline phosphatases, decreased plasma albumin concentrations and higher amount of excretion of 4 -pyridoxic acid in the urine of small bowel transplant patients supported the role of increased degradation of P 5 P. Of the various medications used by transplant patients that were tested using computation approach, pantoprazole, trimethoprim, acyclovir, valganciclovir and mycophenolic acid appeared to be most likely to inhibit pyridoxal kinase. Tacrolimus, the primary immunosuppressive drug used in most transplant recipients had limited impact on pyridoxal kinase expression and activity. A pro-inflammatory cytokine, TNF-α, decreased the expression and activity of pyridoxal kinase in primary cultures of human hepatocytes. The higher plasma concentrations of TNF-α observed in small bowel transplant patients is consistent with a decreased activity of pyridoxal kinase in the liver of these patients, and supported decreased formation of P 5 P also as a contributor to the observed vitamin B 6 deficiency. Additional studies in an animal model where an organ that was not directly involved in the absorption, formation or degradation of vitamin B 6 (a composite allograft tissue transplantation), showed a significant reduction in the expression of pyridoxal kinase in the liver. This suggested that the process of organ transplantation (immune activation and inflammation) itself led to vitamin B 6 deficiency. Our studies indicate that vitamin B 6 deficiency is expected in all transplant recipients; however, the magnitude of deficiency is likely to be affected by the immunogenicity of the transplanted organ and the immune status of the patient. Given the potential effect of vitamin B 6 deficiency (neurotoxicity), and the low cost of vitamin B 6, it is prudent to consider supplementation of all transplant patients with vitamin B 6...|$|R

Incomplete knowledge of Mtb functional genomics undermines efforts {{to understand the}} complex biological repertoire of this deadly human pathogen. While bioinformatics provides useful clues about gene function, biochemical characterisation of gene products remains essential to accurate annotation, particularly in cases where functional redundancy is suggested based {{on the presence of}} multiple homologous proteins. The Mtb genome includes 7 genes which encode conserved hypothetical proteins with unknown function that are annotated as “pyridoxine 5 ’-phosphate (PNPOx) -like” proteins based on structural similarity: Rv 2607, Rv 2991, Rv 1155, Rv 2074, Rv 3369 c, Rv 1875, Rv 0121 c. PNPOx is a flavin mononucleotide (FMN) -dependent enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of the crucial cofactor, <b>pyridoxal</b> 5 ’- <b>phosphate</b> (PLP). The work presented in this thesis shows that while Rv 2607 exhibits canonical PNPOx activity, Rv 1155 and Rv 2991 do not have affinity for FMN as do other members of the PNPOx class. They instead bind tightly to the unusual flavin coenzyme F 420 by isothermal calorimetry (ITC), saturation transfer difference (STD) NMR, and X-ray crystallography. Although recent studies have drawn attention to F 420 due to its role in activating the promising anti-tuberculosis drug PA- 824, {{little is known about the}} function of this coenzyme in Mtb metabolism. In order to identify the substrate recognition properties of Rv 1155 and Rv 2991 respectively, a novel application of fragment-based approaches was employed. A library of fragments was designed based on known ligands to flavoenzymes and screened for binding to Rv 1155 and Rv 2991 in the presence and absence of F 420 using STD NMR and differential scanning fluorimetry. Rv 1155 and Rv 2991 show affinity for distinct classes of fragments. Using a computational method known as “virtual fragment linking,” fragment binding data was used to predict and test potential substrates.

40|$|The {{diversity}} of biosynthetic pathways in prokaryotes and eukaryotes {{has led to}} numerous bioactive natural products (NPs) which occupy a vast chemical space. Despite the current challenges in NP research, these molecules are still relevant today as they are {{a major source of}} human medicine as well as being useful biological tools. The elucidation of their biosynthetic pathways has also provided information about the biochemical and biophysical properties of fascinating enzyme families such as the α- oxoamine synthases (AOSs). The AOSs are an expanding group of <b>pyridoxal</b> 5 ’- <b>phosphate</b> (PLP) -dependent enzymes, which are involved in the biosynthesis of several important NP, including those essential for life. This study reports the characterization and structural analysis of a unique AOS denoted as TamD from Pseudoalteromonas tunicata. This enzyme {{plays a major role in}} tambjamine biosynthesis and consists of both an acyl carrier protein (ACP) domain and a PLP-binding catalytic domain. UV/vis spectroscopy and mass spectrometry (MS) of the recombinant TamD purified from E. coli revealed that the enzyme forms a Schiff base with PLP via Lys 380, which is responsible for its characteristic yellow colour. It binds L-serine as a natural substrate with a Kd of 5. 01 ± 0. 64 mM. This thesis also reports structural data for TamD from xray crystallography at a resolution of 4. 98 Å, which shows four molecules in the asymmetric unit (ASU) suggesting the enzyme exist as a dimer. The absence of the Nterminal region where the ACP domain is located in the crystal strucuture also suggests intrinsic flexibility and disorder within that region. With the increasing demand for new anti-infective therapies, investigations of the molecular interactions between NPs and their protein targets are vital in understanding the inhibition or activation properties of these molecules. The cysteine transpeptidases known as sortases produced by Gram positive bacteria have been identified as attractive targets for NP inhibitors. In this thesis, the molecular basis for the inhibition of Streptococcus mutans sortase A (SrtA) by the plant flavonoid, trans-chalcone is explored, using a combination of MS, enzyme kinetics, molecular modelling and x-ray crystallography. This study reports the first high resolution crystal structure of the H 139 A mutant of S. mutans SrtA, which reveals a unique N-terminal α-helix domain. Trans-chalcone was found to inhibit the in vitro activity of S. mutans SrtA in a slow, tight–binding manner, with a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50) of 5. 0 ± 0. 6 μM. The interaction resulted in a covalent adduct with the active site cysteine residue (Cys 205) via a Michael addition mechanism. Additionally, trans-chalcone showed evidence of S. mutans anti-biofilm activity in a concentration dependent manner up to 250 μM with an efficacy cut-off point at higher concentations. These results indicate that chalcone flavonoids are worth further investigation as potential antibiofilm inhibitors. A renewed interest in plant NPs has also led to a collaborative investigation on the antimicrobial potential of garlic-derived allicin, against Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc), the major bacterial phytopathogen for alliums and an intrinsically multiresistant and life-threatening human pathogen. Allicin is the principal antibacterial agent in fresh preparations of garlic extracts. This investigation reports the first evidence that allicin and allicin-contaning garlic extracts possess inhibitory and bactericidal activities against Bcc. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of aqueous garlic extract (AGE) against 38 Bcc isolates ranged from 0. 5 to 3...|$|R
40|$|Sphingolipids (SL) are {{essential}} structural components of membranes {{found in all}} eukaryotes and have also been identified in some bacteria. The first step of the SL biosynthetic pathway across all species is catalysed by serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT), {{a member of the}} alpha-oxoamine synthase (AOS) family of <b>pyridoxal</b> 5 ’- <b>phosphate</b> (PLP) -dependent enzymes. AOS enzymes are involved in the biosynthesis of a range of important natural products such as heme, vitamins and antibiotics where they catalyse the reaction between amino acid and acyl-thioester substrates. Substrate specificity across the family is of great importance, as human mutant SPTs shift the substrate specificity from L-serine to glycine or L-alanine that lead to production of deoxy-sphingolipids that are toxic to mammalian cells. PLP, a form of vitamin B 6, is one of nature’s most versatile catalysts and is involved in over 160 enzymes that carry out diverse reactions on amine-containing substrates. This work probes the functional role of the phosphate group of PLP, usually housed in a phosphate binding cup (PBC) and investigates the need for a novel and unexpected H-bond between the hydroxyl group of the L-serine substrate and the 5 ’-phosphate group of PLP in SPT. In this study, the PLP cofactor was removed from SPT with amino-thiol substrates which act as mechanism-based inhibitors of SPT via production of a thiazolidine adduct. Replacement of natural PLP with the dephosphorylated form of the cofactor, pyridoxal, allowed a study on the importance of the PLP phosphate:L-serine H-bond on substrate specificity and optimal SPT activity. Furthermore, analysis of the phosphate binding cup of the ALAS:PLP:glycine external aldimine, a related AOS family member; revealed an important residue that could possibly be involved in determining substrate specificity of different members of the AOS family. PBC analysis also expanded, with a detailed and interesting study of a novel SPT:PLP:myriocin inhibitor complex. Human SPT is a heterodimeric, membrane-bound enzyme composed of two subunits (hLCB 1 /hLCB 2) which is thought to contain a single PLP-containing active site. Mutations in human hLCB 1 have been linked to the rare sphingolipid metabolic disease hereditary sensory neuropathy I (HSAN 1). Recent studies identified three heterozygous missense mutations in the second human SPT subunit hLCB 2 that show a significant loss in SPT activity. The three human SPT mutations V 359 M, G 385 V and I 504 F were mapped onto the bacterial S. paucimobilis SPT as V 246 M, G 268 V and G 385 F. These bacterial SPT mutant mimics reveal that the amino acid changes have varying impacts; they perturb the PLP cofactor binding, reduce the affinity for both substrates, decrease the enzyme activity, and, in the most severe case, cause the protein to be expressed in an insoluble form. SPTs and most of {{the other members of the}} AOS family utilise an acyl-CoA thioester substrate. In contrast, a sphingolipid-producing bacterium, S. wittichii, is thought to use a small type II acyl carrier protein (ACP) to deliver the acyl chain to its homodimeric SPT target. Converting the unmodified apo-ACP to the activated “substrate” acyl-ACP, has proven difficult and amino acid sequence alignment, combined with modelling studies revealed an unusual tryptophan residue that could prevent modification to the acyl-ACP form. In this study a double mutant ACP E 36 G/W 37 A has been prepared and characterised. Both wild-type and mutant S. wittichii ACP are expressed in the recombinant E. coli host in their inactive apoform. The transfer of a phosphopantethiene (4 ’PP) linker by a specific PPTase (also known as an acyl carrier protein synthase (AcpS)) has been successful in modifying the mutant form of ACP to its holo-form but could not transfer a palmitoyl group (C 16). E. coli ACP has been successfully expressed, purified and characterised in this study. For the first time, ion mobility mass spectromerty (IM-MS) has been used on this protein to gain structural insight into the different forms of ACP. Collisional cross section (CCS) distributions have been calculated for different acylated states of the ACP concluding that the protein exists in equilibrium between two states: a compact and an extended conformation...|$|R
