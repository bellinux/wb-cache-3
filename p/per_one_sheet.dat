40|$|Wiechert {{seismograph}} {{was designed}} by Professor Wiechert in the early this century. Vertical and two horizontal components were installed in 1930 at Abuyama Seismological Observatory, Kyoto University. We observed many earthquakes by this seismograph for the period over the half century. The instruments are, however, old and decrepit nowadays. The observation system equivalent to the wiechert seismograph was developed. New system is constructed from servo-type seismoneter, analogue electric circuits and recording systems. The servo-type seismometer responses to the ground velocity for wide frequency range. The ground displacement, resonant frequency, damping ratio equal {{to those of the}} wiechert seismograph are obtained by the analogue computing circuits which solve a second linear differential equation. Two kind recording systems are adopted, namely digital and pen-writing system. The former is trigger-compile system and the latter is drum-type one which can record continuously four days <b>per</b> <b>one</b> <b>sheet...</b>|$|E
5000|$|Dinter {{returned}} to Germany in 1914 and {{was obliged to}} remain there until {{after the end of}} the war. South Africa had been given a mandate to administer the former Deutsch-Südwest-Afrika and Dinter applied to the authorities to be reinstated as the regional botanist. To this end he {{returned to}} Okahandja in 1922 and helped with the planning of Ernst Julius Rusch's succulent garden on the farm Lichtenstein. Dr. IB Pole Evans had discussions with the South West African government and as a result Dinter was given an ox-wagon, transport and labour expenses, and free rail travel. In return he would prepare four sets of specimens at a fixed price <b>per</b> <b>sheet,</b> <b>one</b> for himself and the other three to various herbaria.|$|R
