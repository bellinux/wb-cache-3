Gypsy tore down the <b>Panhead,</b> Roy molded his first frame, his brother Gypsy's <b>Panhead</b> frame. This was not the pop-off gas tank yet, the gas tank was welded onto the frame and then molded, this was the old approach. Gypsy ran all his wiring inside the stock <b>Panhead</b> frame which gives a cleaner look which was not being done at that time. In 1970 Chicano Roy molded his first Molded pop-off gas tank frame on his own Pan-Shovelhead (Gypsy built motor) Chopper {{at his home in}} San Fernando, California.

50|$|As {{the design}} of Harley-Davidson engines evolved through the years, the {{distinctive}} shape of the valve covers has allowed Harley enthusiasts to classify an engine simply {{by looking at the}} shape of the covers, and the <b>panhead</b> has covers resembling an upside-down pan.|$|E

50|$|The <b>panhead</b> was a Harley-Davidson {{motorcycle}} engine, so nicknamed {{because of}} the distinct shape of the rocker covers. The engine is a two-cylinder, two-valve-per-cylinder, pushrod V-twin, made in both 61 c.i. (EL) and 74 c.i. (FL, FLH) displacements. The engine replaced the Knucklehead engine in 1948 and was manufactured until 1965 when it {{was replaced by the}} Shovelhead.|$|E

5000|$|The knucklehead is a retronym used by enthusiasts {{to refer}} to a Harley-Davidson {{motorcycle}} engine, so named because of the distinct shape of the rocker boxes. The engine is a two-cylinder, 45 degree, pushrod actuated overhead valve V-twin engine with two valves per cylinder. It was the third basic type of V-Twin engine used by Harley-Davidson, replacing the Flathead-engined VL model in 1936 as HD's top-of-the-line model. The engine was manufactured until 1947 and was replaced by the <b>Panhead</b> engine in 1948. The Knucklehead-engined models were originally referred to as [...] "OHVs" [...] by enthusiasts of the time and in Harley's official literature; the nickname arose from the California chopper culture of the late 1960s.|$|E
50|$|Uhl {{has become}} known for using black and white photos from the Harley-Davidson photo archive to create painted images of the company’s {{motorcycles}} with accurate colors and mechanical details. In 2013, he was commissioned by both Harley-Davidson and the Vatican to create paintings commemorating Harley-Davidson’s 110th anniversary celebration in Rome. Uhl presented the piece Chance Encounter to Pope Francis and the Vatican during a private meeting. The painting depicts a group of clergy noticing a 1948 Harley-Davidson FL <b>panhead</b> while walking in St. Peter’s Square and {{is now part of}} the Vatican’s art collection. The image is also sold as a commemorative postcard with a Pope Francis stamp. The Vatican Post Office designed a mark for the postcard based on Uhl’s painting.|$|E
5000|$|The Shovelhead {{engine is}} a {{motorcycle}} engine that {{was produced by}} Harley-Davidson from 1966 to 1984, built as a successor to the previous <b>Panhead</b> engine. When the engine was first produced, the Shovelhead had a shallower combustion chamber, larger valve drop for both intake and exhaust, better porting, and stronger valves and pistons. This gave the new engine an extra 10 horsepower, along with a different appearance. The engine gained the nickname “Shovelhead” due to {{the look of the}} rocker heads the heads having the appearance of an old coal shovel that was flipped upside down, giving the appearance of a shovel. While the engine did have problems earlier in its timeline, the new and improved motor gave Harley-Davidson a 26% sales increase.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} choppers {{tended to}} be based on Harley-Davidson motorcycles, at first making use of the Flathead, Knucklehead and <b>Panhead</b> engines - many of which could be found in surplus military and police motorcycles bought cheaply at auction. As new engines became available they were soon utilized in choppers. British bikes, particularly Triumphs, were also a popular motor for choppers early on. As the Japanese manufacturers began offering larger engines in the late 1960s these motors were also quickly put to use by chopper builders. The Honda 750-4 was the most widely used Japanese motor for chopper builders early on. Choppers have been created using almost every available engine, but builders have always shown a preference for older air cooled designs. It is rare to see a chopper with a radiator.|$|E
5000|$|In 1930, the [...] VL {{flathead}} {{replaced the}} JD Big Twin, which had featured intake-over-exhaust (IoE) valve configuration. The VL {{had a single}} downtube frame and total loss oiling, culminating in an [...] version (VLH) in 1935. In 1937, that engine was redesigned to include a recirculating lubrication system, and designated the model U, and it went into the same frame and running gear configuration as the model E Knucklehead, which had originated in 1936. The U continued to be produced in varying configurations as a 74 cubic inch U & UL (1937 to 1948), and 80 cubic inch UH & ULH engine (1937 to 1941). By that time, {{the first year of}} the aluminum-head <b>Panhead,</b> it had been thoroughly superseded and outsold in the marketplace by the superior performance of the overhead valve model Big Twins.|$|E
50|$|The Shovelhead {{engine was}} created {{due to the}} {{previous}} <b>Panhead</b> engine starting to become obsolete, with many Harley-Davidson owners demanding more power {{to compete with the}} more modern motorcycles. Throughout the Shovelhead’s run, the engine had many different changes made to it to improve power, cooling and oil consumption. The engines had only 10 fins for cooling, which caused them to run hot. Another problem was that oil would pool in the cylinder heads, causing it to leak into the valves and burn oil. Another problem was that oil would pool in the crankcase rather than being pumped, causing the engine to overheat and seriously harm performance. Oil leakage and consumption became such a problem with the bikes, many owners reported losing as much as a quart of oil every 500 miles. The excessive overheating in the motors also caused serious problems, which frequently led to failure. With a lack of oil and excessive heat, the valves were prone to sticking and destroying the top end. Numerous Harley technicians even stated that without necessary top-end modifications, the motors would often last only between 500 and 5,000 miles. With Harley-Davidson trying to fix the engine rather than research and develop, they fell far behind the competition of the cheaper and more reliable Japanese bikes taking control over the market.|$|E
5000|$|Foot {{clutches}} with tank shifters were {{standard on}} American motorcycles such as Harley-Davidson and Indian {{up to the}} mid-20th century and many custom bikes today still employ this system. The system used by Harley-Davidson arranged the controls with the tank shifter {{on the left side}} of the motorcycle, with the throttle operated by the right hand and the shifter, spark contol and front brake operated by the left hand. The Harley-Davidson rocker clutch was operated with the left foot with the heel down position to disengage the clutch (with an over-center spring to hold the clutch disengaged) and the toe down position to engage it ("Toe-to-go"). The right foot operated the rear brake, as is the practice in modern times. Indian, meanwhile arranged things differently. On an Indian, the tank shifter was located on the right side of the motorcycle, with the throttle operated by the left hand and the shifter, spark control and front brake operated by the right hand. (Indian promoted their system to police departments saying that the officer could fire his service weapon with his right hand while riding) The Indian rocker clutch was also operated by the left foot, but the toe down position disengaged the clutch and the heel down position engaged it. Harley-Davidson introduced the hand clutch on the 1952 <b>Panhead,</b> and simultaneously on the K model, their all-new sport model. The transmissions of the foot shift and the hand shift models were different. The hand shift gear selector mechanism was referred to as the [...] "jockey top" [...] or [...] "jockey lid." [...] On this transmission, the gears were selected in a linear fashion with the selector arm moving further and further forward with each successive gear and the gear lever moved in a slotted gate on the side of the tank. When modified to operate as a [...] "jockey shifter," [...] The lever would be pushed back for 1st gear and then step by step more forward for each subsequent gear. The foot shift gear selector mechanism was referred to as the [...] "ratchet top". On this transmission, the gears were selected in a ratcheting motion, returning to its default, central position after each shift. When modified to operate with short, transmission mounted hand lever and a foot suicide clutch, this type of set-up was referred to as a [...] "slap shifter" [...] or [...] "slapper". In contrast to the jockey shifter, the slap shifter would always stay in one central position between shifts. Throughout the 50s and 60s on the Panheads and subsequent Shovelheads, foot clutches and hand clutches coexisted, with the hand clutch being progressively more popular over time. After foot clutches had all but disappeared from Harley-Davidson civilian models, the last holdout of foot clutches were the police models up to the early 70's, presumably because the police officers could use their 2-way radio with the left hand while clutching with their foot.|$|E
40|$|In this investigation, the pantograph/catenary {{contact is}} {{examined}} using two different formulations. The first is an elastic contact formulation {{that allows for}} the catenary/panhead separation and {{for the analysis of}} the effect of the aerodynamic forces, while the second approach is based on a constraint formulation that does not allow for such a separation by eliminating the freedom of relative translation in two directions at the catenary/panhead contact point. In this study, the catenary system, including the contact and messenger wires, is modeled using the nonlinear finite element (FE) absolute nodal coordinate formulation (ANCF) and flexible multibody system (MBS) algorithms. The generalized aerodynamic forces associated with the ANCF position and gradient coordinates and the pantograph reference coordinates are formulated. The new elastic contact formulation used in this investigation is derived from the constraint-based sliding joint formulation previously proposed by the authors. By using a unilateral penalty force approach, separation of the catenary and <b>panhead</b> is permitted, thereby allowing for better evaluating the response of the pantograph/catenary system to wind loading. In this elastic contact approach, the <b>panhead</b> is assumed to have six degrees-of-freedom with respect to the catenary. The coordinate system at the pantograph/catenary contact point is chosen such that the contact model developed in this study can be used with both the fully parameterized and gradient deficient ANCF elements. In order to develop a more realistic model, the MBS pantograph model is mounted on a detailed three-dimensional MBS rail-vehicle model. The wheel/rail contact is modeled using a nonlinear three-dimensional elastic contact formulation that accounts for the creep forces and spin moment. In order to examine the effect of the external aerodynamic forces on the pantograph/catenary interaction, two scenarios are considered in this investigation. In the first scenario, the crosswind loading is applied on the pantograph components only, while in the second scenario, the aerodynamic forces are applied on the pantograph components and also on the flexible catenary. For the configuration considered in this investigation, {{it was found that the}} crosswind assists the uplift force exerted on the pantograph mechanism, increasing the mean contact force value. Numerical results are presented in order to compare between the cases with and without the wind forces...|$|E
30|$|A {{great deal}} of {{research}} {{has been carried out}} to investigate the aerodynamic characteristics of pantographs of high-speed trains. Zhang et al. [6] studied the influence of the fairing and windshield on the aerodynamic drag of pantographs through wind tunnel tests. Guo et al.
