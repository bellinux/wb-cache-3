We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} logical data erasure, contrasting with <b>physical</b> <b>erasure</b> {{in the same way}} that end-to-end information flow control contrasts with access control. We present a semantic hierarchy for erasure policies, using a possibilistic knowledge-based semantics to define policy satisfaction such that there is an intuitively clear upper bound on what information an erasure policy permits to be retained. Our hierarchy allows a rich class of erasure policies to be expressed, taking account of the power of the attacker, how much information may be retained, and under what conditions it may be retained. While our main aim is to specify erasure policies, the semantic framework allows quite general information-flow policies to be formulated for a variety of semantic notions of secrecy. ...|$|E
40|$|Of the 202 mosques in the Banja Luka {{region of}} Bosnia-Herzegovina in 1992, only one has escaped not being dynamited, bulldozed or shelled out of existence. According {{to the vice}} {{president}} of the Banja Luka municipality, the systematic <b>physical</b> <b>erasure</b> of mosques from the landscape- some of which dated from the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries- is the only way to teach minorities to respect Serbian law (Pomfret, 1994). In 1994 this region was the site of a resurgent campaign of ethnic cleansing against the Bosnian Muslims and Croats who had lived there for centuries and survived the first waves of ethnic cleansing in 1992 and 1993. Once again, rape was used as a weapon of terror by the Bosnian Serbs against Muslim and Croat women just as it had been in the previous two years (Amnesty International, 1993). Women’s bodies were brutalized to realize male fantasies of identity and purity. This systematic erasure of history, organized sexual terrorism and relentless drive to create ethnically cleansed territory in the Banja Luka region of Bosnia is a microcosm of a world marked by crises of governance. As a result of war, persecution and human rights abuses, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees estimates that roughly one i...|$|E
40|$|My work {{is about}} the inevitability of change and the {{concomitant}} longing for stability. It explores various manifestations of loss – death, <b>physical</b> distance, <b>erasure</b> – {{and the desire to}} hold tight to something that is already passing. The videos in this body of work convey intensely personal narratives about cultural assimilation, sexual orientation, and departure, in hopes that my own vulnerability can reveal something that is not identity-specific but human.

Threats to media that must be considered when archiving important record media include accidental <b>erasure,</b> <b>physical</b> loss due to disasters such as fires and floods, and media degradation.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} some reliability mechanisms which may be put {{at work in the}} context of Satellite Digital Multimedia Broadcasting (SDMB) to mobile devices such as handheld phones. These mechanisms include error correcting codes, interleaving at the <b>physical</b> layer, <b>erasure</b> codes at intermediate layers and error concealment on the video decoder. The evaluation is made on a realistic satellite channel and takes into account practical constraints such as the maximum zapping time and the user mobility at several speeds. The evaluation is done by simulating different scenarii with complete protocol stacks. The simulations indicate that, under the assumptions taken here, the scenario using highly compressed video protected by erasure codes at intermediate layers seems to be the best solution on this kind of channel...|$|R
40|$|Erasure of {{information}} {{stored in a}} quantum state requires energy cost and is inherently an irreversible operation. If quantumness of a system is <b>physical,</b> does <b>erasure</b> of quantum correlation as measured by discord also need some energy cost? Here, we show that change in quantum correlation is never larger than the total entropy change {{of the system and}} the environment. The entropy cost of erasing correlation has to be at least equal to the amount of quantum correlation erased. Hence, quantum correlation can be regarded as genuinely physical. We show that the new bound leads to the Landauer <b>erasure.</b> The <b>physical</b> cost of erasing quantum correlation is well respected in the case of bleaching of quantum information, thermalization, and can have potential application for any channel leading to erasure of quantum correlation.

40|$|Landauer's {{principle}} {{introduces a}} symmetry between computational and <b>physical</b> processes: <b>erasure</b> of information, a logically irreversible operation, must be underlain by an irreversible transformation dissipating energy. Monitoring micro- and nano-systems needs {{to enter into}} the energetic balance of their control; hence, finding the ultimate limits is instrumental to the development of future thermal machines operating at the quantum level. We report on the experimental investigation of a bound to the irreversible entropy associated to generalized quantum measurements on a quantum bit. We adopted a quantum photonics gate to implement a device interpolating from the weakly disturbing to the fully invasive and maximally informative regime. Our experiment prompted us to introduce a bound taking into account both the classical result of the measurement and the outcoming quantum state; unlike previous investigation, our new entropic bound is based uniquely on measurable quantities. Our results highlight what insights the information-theoretic approach can provide on building blocks of quantum information processors...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} adding redundancy to a collection of physical objects so that the overall system is more robust to failures. In contrast to its information counterpart, which can exploit parity to protect multiple information symbols from a single <b>erasure,</b> <b>physical</b> redundancy can only be realized through duplication and substitution of objects. We propose a bipartite graph model for designing defect-tolerant systems in which defective objects are replaced by judiciously connected redundant objects. The fundamental limits of this model are characterized under various asymptotic settings and both asymptotic and finite-size systems that approach these limits are constructed. Among other results, we show that simple modular redundancy is in general suboptimal. As we develop, this combinatorial problem of defect tolerant system design has a natural interpretation as one of graph coloring, and the analysis is significantly different from that traditionally used in information redundancy for error-control codes...|$|R
