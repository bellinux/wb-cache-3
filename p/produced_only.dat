5|$|When Hotspur {{production}} {{ended in}} early 1943, {{a total of}} 1,015 gliders had been produced. The primary sub-contractor, Harris Lebus was responsible for 996 Mk IIs and Mk IIIs while the parent company <b>produced</b> <b>only</b> 10 Mk Is and a single Mk II prototype. Slingsby {{was the only other}} sub-contractor involved in production with eight Mk Is completed.|$|E
5|$|A production–possibility {{frontier}} (PPF) or {{production possibility}} curve (PPC) is a graphical representation of possible combinations of two goods (such as butter and guns) {{that can be}} produced with constant technology and resources per unit of time, such that more of one good could be <b>produced</b> <b>only</b> by diverting resources from the other good, resulting in less production of it; i. e. production tradeoffs, usually for an economy, but which can also be interpreted as applying for an individual, household, etc.|$|E
5|$|Ceolnoth, Archbishop of Canterbury {{throughout}} Æthelwulf's reign, also minted coins {{of his own}} at Canterbury: {{there were}} three different portrait designs, thought to be contemporary {{with each of the}} first three of Æthelwulf's Canterbury issues. These were followed by an inscribed cross design that was uniform with Æthelwulf's final coinage. At Rochester, Bishop Beornmod <b>produced</b> <b>only</b> one issue, a cross-and-wedges design which was contemporary with Æthelwulf's Saxoniorum issue.|$|E
50|$|It is true {{that animals}} also produce. They build nests and dwellings, like the bee, the beaver, the ant, etc. But they <b>produce</b> <b>only</b> their own {{immediate}} needs or those of their young; they <b>produce</b> <b>only</b> when immediate physical need compels them to do so, while man produces even when he is free from physical need and truly <b>produces</b> <b>only</b> in freedom from such need; they <b>produce</b> <b>only</b> themselves, while man reproduces the whole of nature; their products belong immediately to their physical bodies, while man freely confronts his own product. Animals <b>produce</b> <b>only</b> according to the standards {{and needs of the}} species to which they belong, while man is capable of producing according to the standards of every species and of applying to each object its inherent standard; hence, man also produces in accordance with the laws of beauty.|$|R
25|$|In the {{majority}} of species with sex specialization, organisms are either male (<b>producing</b> <b>only</b> male gametes) or female (<b>producing</b> <b>only</b> female gametes). Exceptions are common—for example, the roundworm C. elegans has an hermaphrodite and a male sex (a system called androdioecy).|$|R
50|$|The {{cultivated}} land is relatively unproductive: paddy fields <b>produce</b> <b>only</b> 424 tonnes of rice per square mile, compared to 547 nationally. Most farmers can <b>produce</b> <b>only</b> one crop of rice a year. Many farmers still use water buffalo rather than tractors.|$|R
5|$|Excluding these, {{surprisingly}} few documents {{dating to}} Unas' reign have survived to this day, considering the 30-year length that later records give for his reign. Excavations at Abusir, the royal necropolis of the Fifth Dynasty, have <b>produced</b> <b>only</b> four dated inscriptions safely attributable to Unas. They explicitly mention his third, fourth, sixth and eighth {{years on the}} throne. Unas also left a rock inscription {{on the island of}} Elephantine, next to the First Cataract of the Nile in Nubia.|$|E
5|$|Four {{additional}} tornadoes {{touched down}} this day. A tornado that {{was associated with}} the main supercell touched down briefly near Fulda, Minnesota, at 3:55pm, while the Comfrey tornado was also on the ground. It was rated as an F1 and caused minor damage. Three other tornadoes that were all unrelated to the main supercell were confirmed as well; one in southeast Minnesota near Wabasha and two in Wisconsin. All three were rated F0 on the Fujita Scale and <b>produced</b> <b>only</b> minor damage.|$|E
5|$|In 1945, B. B. Cunningham {{obtained}} the first bulk chemical compound of a transplutonium element, namely americium hydroxide. Over {{the next three}} to four years, milligram quantities of americium and microgram amounts of curium were accumulated that allowed production of isotopes of berkelium (Thomson, 1949) and californium (Thomson, 1950). Sizeable amounts of these elements were <b>produced</b> <b>only</b> in 1958 (Burris B. Cunningham and Stanley G. Thomson), and the first californium compound (0.3µg of CfOCl) was obtained only in 1960 by B. B. Cunningham and J. C. Wallmann.|$|E

5|$|In the 14th century, {{recurrent}} civil wars, {{attacks from}} Bulgaria and Serbia in the Balkans and the devastation caused by ever-increasing Turkish raids hastened {{the collapse of}} the Byzantine state, which would culminate in its final fall to the Ottoman Turks in 1453. Several emperors after Andronikos II also tried to re-build a fleet, especially in order to secure the security and hence the independence of Constantinople itself from the interference of the Italian maritime powers, but their efforts <b>produced</b> <b>only</b> short-term results.|$|E
5|$|In the universe, thorium {{is among}} the rarest of the {{primordial}} elements, because {{it is one of}} the two elements that can be <b>produced</b> <b>only</b> in the r-process, and also because it has slowly been decaying away from the moment it formed. The only primordial elements rarer than thorium are uranium, also <b>produced</b> <b>only</b> by the r-process, and thulium, lutetium, tantalum, and rhenium, the odd-numbered elements just before the third peak of r-process abundances around the heavy platinum group metals. Neutron capture by nuclides beyond A = 209 often results in nuclear fission instead of neutron absorption, reducing the fraction of nuclei that cross the gap of instability past bismuth to become actinides such as thorium. In the distant past the abundances of thorium and uranium were enriched by the decay of plutonium and curium isotopes, and thorium was enriched relative to uranium by the decay of 236U to 232Th and the natural depletion of 235U, but these sources have long since decayed and no longer contribute.|$|E

Since the 10th century, Nabulsi soap has enjoyed a {{reputation}} for being a fine product, and has been exported across the Arab world and to Europe. Though the number of soap factories decreased from a peak of thirty in the 19th century to only two today, efforts to preserve this important part of Palestinian and Nabulsi cultural heritage continue.|$|E

Koteswara Rao of Bharani Studios worked on the re-recording and songs. RCA and Western Electric sound systems were used for the same.|$|E
5|$|The Sex Pistols were an English {{punk rock}} band formed in London in 1975.

5|$|The first curium {{samples were}} barely visible, and were {{identified}} by their radioactivity. Louis Werner and Isadore Perlman created the first substantial sample of 30µg curium-242 hydroxide at the University of California in 1947 by bombarding americium-241 with neutrons. Macroscopic amounts of curium(III) fluoride were obtained in 1950 by W. W. T. Crane, J. C. Wallmann and B. B. Cunningham. Its magnetic susceptibility {{was very close to}} that of GdF3 providing the first experimental evidence for the +3 valence of curium in its compounds. Curium metal was <b>produced</b> <b>only</b> in 1951 by reduction of CmF3 with barium.|$|E
5|$|The {{possibility}} of progress {{is embedded in}} the mediaeval great chain of being, with a linear sequence of forms from lowest to highest. The concept, indeed, had its roots in Aristotle's biology, from insects that <b>produced</b> <b>only</b> a grub, to fish that laid eggs, and on up to animals with blood and live birth. The mediaeval chain, as in Ramon Lull's Ladder of Ascent and Descent of the Mind, 1305, added steps or levels above humans, with orders of angels reaching up to God at the top.|$|E
5|$|While {{the lightest}} (252Lr to 254Lr) and {{heaviest}} (266Lr) lawrencium isotopes are <b>produced</b> <b>only</b> as alpha decay products of dubnium (Z=105) isotopes, the middle isotopes (255Lr to 262Lr) {{can all be}} produced by bombarding actinide (americium to einsteinium) targets with light ions (from boron to neon). The two most important isotopes, 256Lr and 260Lr, are both in this range. 256Lr can be produced by bombarding californium-249 with 70MeV boron-11 ions (producing lawrencium-256 and four neutrons), while 260Lr can be produced by bombarding berkelium-249 with oxygen-18 (producing lawrencium-260, an alpha particle, and three neutrons).|$|E

5|$|Any {{point that}} lies {{either on the}} {{production}} possibilities curve or {{to the left of}} it is said to be an attainable point: it can be produced with currently available resources. Points that lie {{to the right of the}} production possibilities curve are said to be unattainable because they cannot be produced using currently available resources. Points that lie strictly to the left of the curve are said to be inefficient, because existing resources would allow for production of more of at least one good without sacrificing the production of any other good. An efficient point is one that lies on the production possibilities curve. At any such point, more of one good can be <b>produced</b> <b>only</b> by producing less of the other.|$|E
5|$|Born {{and raised}} in Scottsdale, Arizona, Stone began acting as a child, in a theater {{production}} of The Wind in the Willows in 2000. As a teenager, she relocated to Los Angeles with her mother, and made her television debut in VH1's In Search of the New Partridge Family (2004), a reality show that <b>produced</b> <b>only</b> an unsold pilot. After small television roles, she won a Young Hollywood Award for her film debut in Superbad (2007), and received positive media attention {{for her role in}} Zombieland (2009). The 2010 teen comedy Easy A was Stone's first starring role and earned her nominations for the BAFTA Rising Star Award and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress. This breakthrough was followed with further success in the romantic comedy Crazy, Stupid, Love and the drama The Help (both 2011).|$|E
5|$|For his String Quartet, Lutosławski had <b>produced</b> <b>only</b> {{the four}} {{instrumental}} parts, refusing to bind {{them in a}} full score, because he was concerned that this would imply that he wanted notes in vertical alignment to coincide, {{as is the case}} with conventionally notated classical ensemble music. The LaSalle Quartet, however, specifically requested a score from which to prepare for the first performance. Bodman Rae relates that Danuta Lutoslawska solved this problem by cutting up the parts and sticking them together in boxes (which Lutosławski called mobiles), with instructions on how to signal in performance when all of the players should proceed to the next mobile. In his orchestral music, these problems of notation were not so difficult, because the instructions on how and when to proceed are given by the conductor.|$|E
