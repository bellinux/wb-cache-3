To date, the use of 3 C-SiC for photovoltaics has not been considered due to the band gap of 2. 3 eV being too large for conventional solar cells. Doping of 3 C-SiC with boron introduces an energy level of 0. 7 eV above the valence band. Such energy level may form an intermediate band (IB) in the band gap. This IB concept has been presented in the literature {{to act as an}} energy ladder that allows absorption of sub-bandgap photons to generate extra electron-hole pairs and increase the efficiency of a solar cell. The main challenge with this concept is to find a materials system that could realize such efficient photovoltaic behavior. The 3 C-SiC bandgap and boron energy level fits nicely into the concept, but has not been explored for an IB behavior. For a long time crystalline 3 C-SiC has been challenging to grow due to its metastable nature. The material mainly consists {{of a large number of}} small domains if the 3 C polytype is maintained. In our work a crystal growth process was realized by a new approach that is a combination of initial nucleation and step-flow growth. In the process, the domains that form initially extend laterally to make larger 3 C-SiC domains, thus leading to a pronounced improvement in crystalline quality of 3 C-SiC. In order to explore the feasibility of IB in 3 C-SiC using boron, we have explored two routes of introducing boron impurities; ion implantation on un-doped samples and epitaxial growth on un-doped samples using <b>pre-doped</b> <b>source</b> material. The results show that 3 C-SiC doped with boron is an optically active material, and thus is interesting to be further studied for IB behavior. For the ion implanted samples the crystal quality was maintained even after high implantation doses and subsequent annealing. The same was true for the samples grown with <b>pre-doped</b> <b>source</b> material, even with a high concentration of boron impurities. We present optical emission and absorption properties of as-grown and boron implanted 3 C-SiC. The low-temperature photoluminescence spectra indicate the formation of optically active deep boron centers, which may be utilized for achieving an IB behavior at sufficiently high dopant concentrations. We also discuss the potential of boron doped 3 C-SiC base material in a broader range of applications, such as in photovoltaics, biomarkers and hydrogen generation by splitting water.
