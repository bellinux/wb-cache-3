5000|$|A three-month {{investigation}} by the <b>parliamentary</b> <b>fees</b> office resulted in McCabe calling for Commons officials to be sacked. He later admitted: [...] "I did make an error in my claim and, as the letter from the fees office shows, this money was repaid in a deduction from my next claim". Between 2004 and 2008, McCabe claimed £54,699 in expenses for his second home, on which he has a £60,000 mortgage. The claims included £5,500 for a new kitchen.|$|R
2500|$|The {{information}} in the leaks published by The Daily Telegraph originated from the <b>parliamentary</b> <b>fees</b> office, and had been offered to other newspaper organisations for more than £150,000. In September 2009, the assistant editor of the Telegraph, Andrew Pierce, revealed {{in an interview that}} the newspaper had paid £110,000 for the information, and described it as [...] "money well spent in the public interest". The Times and The Sun had turned down an offer to buy the leaked expenses file.|$|R
50|$|After {{details of}} MPs' expense claims were {{released}} by the press it was shown that Laing had avoided paying £180,000 capital gains tax {{on the sale of}} her Westminster flat by declaring it as her primary residence. This was due to its having a higher value than her constituency home, making it her primary residence under CGT rules. However she had registered the flat as her second home with the <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>Fees</b> Office, and by doing so had claimed through her Additional Costs Allowance some of the interest due on her mortgage.|$|R
25|$|Capital gains tax: MPs {{were able}} to {{designate}} a property as their second home with the <b>parliamentary</b> <b>fees</b> office so as to claim the cost of renovating it on expenses, {{but a number of}} MPs had concurrently described a property as their second home to claim expenses, and to the UK tax authority HM Revenue and Customs as their primary residence in order to sell it without capital gains tax. Some also designated a property as a primary or secondary residence for tax or expenses benefits which was apparently little if at all used by them in that role.|$|R
5000|$|In 2009, Gummer was {{involved}} in the United Kingdom parliamentary expenses scandal, after claiming £36,000 for gardening over 4 years, as an parliamentary expense. Although the claims were encouraged and initially approved by the <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>Fees</b> Office, rules state claims should only be made on expenses essential to parliamentary duties. He repaid £11,538 for gardening and household bills and donated £11,500 to charity, saying that he was paying above the minimum required in order to demonstrate [...] "corporate social responsibility" [...] for the expenses system.Subsequently, the Legg Report showed that 343 MPs had been asked to repay some money with Gummer paying the 7th highest figure.|$|R
5000|$|Kaufman {{was found}} to have {{submitted}} expense claims that included £8,865 for a 40-inch LCD television, £1,851 for an antique rug imported from New York, and £225 for a rollerball pen. He blamed his self-diagnosed obsessive compulsive disorder for his claims, and also said that his condition led him to purchase a pair of Waterford Crystal grapefruit bowls on his parliamentary expenses. Between 2005 and 2007, Kaufman claimed £28,834 for home improvements. He was subsequently summoned to the <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>Fees</b> Office to explain these claims, and in the end was reimbursed £15,329. He was also challenged over regular claims for [...] "odd jobs", which he submitted without receipts at a rate of £245 per month, then £5 below the limit for unreceipted expenses, to which he replied by asking why these expenses were being queried.|$|R
2500|$|A February 2008 Freedom of Information Act {{request for}} the release of details of MPs' {{expenses}} claims was allowed by an Information Tribunal but challenged by The House of Commons Authorities {{on the grounds that it}} was [...] "unlawfully intrusive". In May 2008 the High Court (England and Wales) ruled in favour of releasing the information. In April 2009 the House of Commons authorities announced that publication of expenses, with certain information deemed [...] "sensitive" [...] removed, would be made in July 2009. But before this could take place the expenses records and documentation were leaked to The Daily Telegraph newspaper, which began publishing details in daily installments from 8 May 2009. These disclosures dominated the British media for weeks. On 18 June 2009 the details of all MPs' expenses and allowance claims approved from 2004 to 2008 were published on the official Parliament website with detail such as addresses, claims that were not approved for payment and correspondence between MPs and the <b>parliamentary</b> <b>fees</b> office removed, bringing further accusations of unnecessary secrecy and allegations that this might have prevented serious abuses from being disclosed.|$|R
