40|$|Background and objectives:Drimia maritima (L.) Stearn {{also known}} as squill is a medicinally {{important}} plant {{that has been used}} for various ailments such as dropsy, respiratory disorders, jaundice and epilepsy from ancient times. <b>Proscillaridin</b> A is identified {{as one of the most}} effective compounds in the plant with remarkable pharmacological features including efficacy against congestive heart failure, antitumor, t-cell suppressive and analgesic activities. In the present study, a reliable high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method has been developed for quantification of <b>proscillaridin</b> A in D. maritima.  Methods: The separation of compounds was performed using gradient elution (methanol: water) on a reversed phase ACE C 18 with flow rate of 1 mL/min and UV detection at 300 nm for 50 min. The method was evaluated using validation parameter such as selectivity, linearity, precision, recovery, limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantization (LOQ). Results: The separation technique was selective for quantification of <b>proscillaridin</b> A. The calibration graph was linear with r 2 > 0. 998. The intra and inter-day precision (RSD%, 3. 8 - 4. 16 and 7. 5) were satisfactory. LOD and LOQ were calculated as 0. 6 and 1. 8 µg/mL respectively. The recovery average was 93. 7 %.

40|$|Background and objectives:  Squill [Drimia maritima (L.) Stearn] is an {{important}} medicinal plant {{that has been used}} for medicinal purposes such as cardiovascular diseases and asthma since ancient times. Bufadienolides are the main compounds of this plant and are responsible for some reported adverse effects. In order to reduce adverse effects, different methods like boiling with vinegar were applied by traditional practitioners. In the present study, the acute oral toxicity, cytotoxic effects, <b>proscillaridin</b> A content and antibacterial properties of methanol and vinegar extracts of squill white variety were compared for exploring the efficacy of traditional processing method. Methods: Different doses of extracts (1000 - 5000 mg/kg) were administered during oral gavage in rats to analyze the acute oral toxicity. Cytotoxicity against HT- 29, Caco- 2 and NIH 3 T 3 cell lines and antibacterial activity (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli) were investigated using MTT assay and conventional agar dilution method, respectively. <b>Proscillaridin</b> A content was evaluated in the extracts (vinager and methanol) by a validated high performance liquid chromatography method. Results: During the in vivo research no death or observed effect occurred in animals that received the extracts. Our results showed that all of the extracts exhibited no cytotoxic effects in experimented cell lines (IC 50 > 1000 μg/mL). <b>Proscillaridin</b> A was only detected in the methanol extract and no significant antibacterial effect was detected in methanol extract. Conclusion: According to results of the present study, processing squill with vinegar according to traditional experiences can reduce possible the side effects of bufadienolids...|$|E
40|$|Digitalis-like {{compounds}} (DLCs), {{the ancient}} medication {{of heart failure}} and Na,K-ATPase inhibitors, are characterized by their toxicity. Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) at absorption and excretion levels {{play a key role}} in their toxicity, hence, knowledge about the transporters involved might prevent these unwanted interactions. In the present study, the transport of fourteen DLCs with human P-glycoprotein (P-gp; ABCB 1) was studied using a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) quantification method. DLC transport by P-gp overexpressing Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) and immortalized human renal cells (ciPTEC) was compared to vesicular DLC transport. Previously, we identified convallatoxin as a substrate using membrane vesicles overexpressing P-gp; however, we could not measure transport of other DLCs in this assay (Gozalpour et al., 2014 a). Here, we showed that lipophilic digitoxin, digoxigenin, strophanthidin and <b>proscillaridin</b> A are P-gp substrates in cellular accumulation assays, whereas the less lipophilic convallatoxin was not. P-gp function in the cellular accumulation assays depends on the entrance of lipophilic compounds by passive diffusion, whereas the vesicular transport assay is more appropriate for hydrophilic substrates. In conclusion, we identified digitoxin, digoxigenin, strophanthidin and <b>proscillaridin</b> A as P-gp substrates using cellular accumulation assays and recognized lipophilicity as an important factor in selecting a suitable transport assay...|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} digitoxin, 3 alpha-methyl-digitoxigenin- 3 beta-monoglucoside (3 alpha-MDM), 3 alpha-methyl-digitoxigenin (3 alpha-MD), <b>proscillaridin,</b> 4, 5 -methylene-procillaridin (4, 5 -MP), and 3 beta-hydroxy- 4, 5 -methylene-A, B-trans-scillarenin (3 beta-HMTS) on force of {{contraction}} {{and on the}} transmembrane action potentials were examined in isolated papillary muscles of guinea-pigs. All derivatives exhibited the typical cardiac glycoside effects: i. e. they increased the force of contraction and shortened the action potential duration at 20 % (plateau phase) and 90 % of repolarization. With digitoxin, 3 beta-HMTS and 4, 5 -MP a transient prolongation in action potential duration was observed at the lower concentrations. The action potential amplitude and the resting membrane potential were reduced consistently only with the higher concentrations used. The onset of the positive inotropic effects of 3 alpha-MDM, 3 alpha-MD and 3 beta-HMTS was more rapid than that of digitoxin and <b>proscillaridin.</b> The increment in contractile force reached a maximum well before the full shortening effect on the action potential duration had developed. The shortening of the action potential {{is thought to be}} responsible for the biphasic nature of the positive inotropic effect. With 3 alpha-MD and 3 alpha-MDM even toxic effects, e. g. increase in baseline tension, were completely reversible after washing in drug-free solution. The dose-response curves for the positive inotropism can only be compared reliably once the equilibrium of drug action has been established. This steady state is probably reflected by the development of the full shortening in action potential duration...|$|E
40|$|Digitalis-like {{compounds}} (DLCs), or cardiac glycosides, {{are produced}} and sequestered by certain {{plants and animals}} as a protective mechanism against herbivores or predators. Currently, the DLCs digoxin and digitoxin {{are used in the}} treatment of cardiac congestion and some types of cardiac arrhythmia, despite a very narrow therapeutic index. P-glycoprotein (P-gp; ABCB 1) is the only known ATP-dependent efflux transporter that handles digoxin as a substrate. Ten alanine mutants of human P-gp drug-binding amino acids-Leu(65), Ile(306), Phe(336), Ile(340), Phe(343), Phe(728), Phe(942), Thr(945), Leu(975), and Val(982) -were generated and expressed in HEK 293 cells with a mammalian baculovirus system. The uptake of [(3) H]-N-methyl-quinidine (NMQ), the P-gp substrate in vesicular transport assays, was determined. The mutations I 306 A, F 343 A, F 728 A, T 945 A, and L 975 A abolished NMQ transport activity of P-gp. For the other mutants, the apparent affinities for six DLCs (cymarin, digitoxin, digoxin, peruvoside, <b>proscillaridin</b> A, and strophanthidol) were determined. The affinities of digoxin, <b>proscillaridin</b> A, peruvoside, and cymarin for mutants F 336 A and I 340 A were decreased two- to fourfold compared with wild type, whereas that of digitoxin and strophanthidol did not change. In addition, the presence of a hydroxyl group at position 12 beta seems to reduce the apparent affinity when the side chain of Phe(336) and Phe(942) is absent. Our results showed that a delta-lactone ring and a sugar moiety at 3 beta of the steroid body are favorable for DLC binding to P-gp. Moreover, DLC inhibition is increased by hydroxyl groups at positions 5 beta and 19, whereas inhibition is decreased by those at positions 1 beta, 11 alpha, 12 beta, and 16 beta. The understanding of the P-gp-DLC interaction improves our insight into DLCs toxicity and might enhance the replacement of digoxin with other DLCs that have less adverse drug effects...|$|E

Twenty drugs inhibited HIF- 1 -dependent gene transcription by > 88 % at a concentration of 0. 4 μM. Eleven of these drugs were cardiac glycosides, including digoxin, ouabain, and <b>proscillaridin</b> A, which inhibited HIF- 1 α protein synthesis and expression of HIF- 1 target genes in cancer cells. Digoxin administration increased latency and decreased growth of tumor xenografts, whereas treatment of established tumors resulted in growth arrest within one week.

The taxonomic {{proximity}} between Scilla L. and Urginea Steinh. genus, {{and also the}} knowledge that bulbs of Urginea maritima (L.) Baker (Scilla maritima L.) contain cardiac glycosides of the bufadienolide type, led us to a phytochemical and pharmacological study of S. maderensis. Extracts obtained from the bulbs were screened by TLC and tested in the isolated frog heart preparation. The TLC screening revealed spots with colours and Rf values similar to those obtained for <b>proscillaridin</b> and scillaren A. In the frog heart preparation the extracts showed a positive inotropic effect and toxic doses induced the arrest of the heartbeat in systole. We can conclude that the bulbs of S. maderensis contain substances exerting pharmacological effects on the heart.

DUTTA: The {{effects of}} six cardiac glycosides on the transmembrane {{potential}} and contractile {{characteristics of the}} right ventricle of guinea pigs. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 172 : 188 - 195, 1970. The effects of six glycosides (ouabain, dihydro-ouabain, digitoxin, digoxin, <b>proscillaridin</b> and convallatoxol) on ventricu-lar transmembrane potential and contractile charcteristics were studied in order to compare their mode of action.

The dose-response curves of dig-itoxin and ouabain were also approximately equal. It was also found that these six glycosides may be divided into two groups: group I, consisting of digitoxin and proscil-laridin, showed a dose-related prolongation of the duration of the action potential and time to peak developed tension; and group II, including ouabain and convallatoxol, primarily shortened the plateau of the action potential, whereas digoxin and dihydro-ouabain wer...|$|E
40|$|Na+/K(+) ATPase is a {{transport}} {{membrane protein}} which contains the functional receptor for digitalis compounds, In this work we compare the inhibition curves of Na+/K(+) ATPase {{measured by the}} inhibition of Rb- 86 uptake in human red blood cells by cardiac glycosides and by an endogenous digitalis like factor (EDLF) extracted from human newborn cord blood. The curves of Na+/K(+) TPase inhibition show a monophasic shape for ouabain, strophantidin, digitoxin, <b>proscillaridin</b> and EDLF whereas a biphasic shape for ouabagenin, digoxin, digoxigenin and digitoxigenin. All the drugs are potent inhibitors of erythrocyte Na+/K(+) ATPase with an IC 50 ranging from 1. 8 x 10 (- 9) M to 1. 4 x 10 (- 11) M for the higher affinity binding site and from 1. 8 X 10 (- 6) M to 5. 5 X 10 (- 9) M for the lower affinity site. Digitoxigenin is the most active showing the higher active site at 1. 4 X 10 (- 11) M. Ouabain and digoxin have higher affinity compared with their corresponding genins, while digitoxigenin shows a binding site with higher affinity than the respective cardiac glycosides, The increased affinity of the drugs to Na+/K(+) ATPase {{may be related to}} a lipophilic region in correspondence of the carbons 10, 9, 11, 12, 13 of the steroid nucleus, situated in the opposite side with respect of the C-OH- 14. The comparison of the inhibition curves and the HPLC profile of newborn EDLF and of the investigated cardenolides suggest that EDLF may be a compound identical or very similar to ouabain.

40|$|Summary: The {{process of}} {{hemodialysis}} (HD) produces a pro-inflammatory state {{that can lead}} to an increased risk for cardiovascular disease. In part, this is the result of activation of the pro-inflammatory transcription factor NF-kB in response to uremia as well as in response to HD itself, which not only involves exposure of blood leukocytes to abnormal surfaces but also potentially to any bacterial contamination associated with HD. Previously, we used lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to activate isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), as a model of HD-induced stress, and demonstrated that specific natural products that are known to inhibit the activation of NF-kB exhibited a broad anti-inflammatory activity.   These natural products, however, were not effective when whole blood was used. In the present study, a natural product library (TimTec NPL 480) was screened, using whole blood, for the abilities of these natural products to protect against LPS-induced expression and secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNFa, IL- 1 b and IL- 6.   We report here that the cardiac glycosides strophanthidin, ouabain, <b>proscillaridin</b> A, digoxin, digitoxin and lanatoside C are effective natural products that limit the development of a pro-inflammatory state by preventing the activation of these pro-inflammatory signals. These active natural products also inhibited the stress-induced activation of NF-kB in a reporter assay, suggesting that inhibition of NF-kB is at least partly the mechanism by which these natural products protect whole blood leukocytes from activation by LPS. Industrial relevance: Media for hemodialysis is used millions of times annually for patients with end stage renal disease, each use representing a potential pro-inflammatory insult. It would be useful to have a drug that could be added to the media which would protect blood leukocytes from any pro-inflammatory activation that may accompany the dialysis procedure. A natural product, if demonstrated to have low toxicity, could be especially attractive as a drug candidate for this application. </p...|$|E
40|$|Digitalis-like {{compounds}} (DLCs) such as digoxin, digitoxin, and ouabain, {{also known}} as cardiac glycosides, are among the oldest pharmacological treatments for heart failure. The compounds have a narrow therapeutic window, {{while at the same}} time, DLC pharmacokinetics is prone to drug-drug interactions at the transport level. Hepatic transporters organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1 B 1, OATP 1 B 3, and Na(+) -dependent taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (NTCP) influence the disposition of a variety of drugs by mediating their uptake from blood into hepatocytes. The interaction of digoxin, digitoxin, and ouabain with hepatic uptake transporters has been studied before. However, here, we systematically investigated a much wider range of structurally related DLCs for their capability to inhibit or to be transported by these transporters in order to better understand the relation between the activity and chemical structure of this compound type. We studied the uptake and inhibitory potency of a series of 14 structurally related DLCs in Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing NTCP (CHO-NTCP) and human embryonic kidney cells expressing OATP 1 B 1 and OATP 1 B 3 (HEK-OATP 1 B 1 and HEK-OATP 1 B 3). The inhibitory effect of the DLCs was measured against taurocholic acid (TCA) uptake in CHO-NTCP cells and against uptake of beta-estradiol 17 -beta-d-glucuronide (E 217 betaG) in HEK-OATP 1 B 1 and HEK-OATP 1 B 3 cells. <b>Proscillaridin</b> A was the most effective inhibitor of NTCP-mediated TCA transport (IC 50 = 22 muM), whereas digitoxin and digitoxigenin were the most potent inhibitors of OATP 1 B 1 and OAPTP 1 B 3, with IC 50 values of 14. 2 and 36 muM, respectively. Additionally, we found that the sugar moiety and hydroxyl groups of the DLCs play different roles in their interaction with NTCP, OATP 1 B 1, and OATP 1 B 3. The sugar moiety decreases the inhibition of NTCP and OATP 1 B 3 transport activity, whereas it enhances the inhibitory potency against OATP 1 B 1. Moreover, the hydroxyl group at position 12 reinforces the inhibition of NTCP but decreases the inhibition of OATP 1 B 1 and OATP 1 B 3. To investigate whether DLCs can be translocated, we quantified their uptake in transporter-expressing cells by LC-MS. We demonstrated that convallatoxin, ouabain, dihydroouabain, and ouabagenin are substrates of OATP 1 B 3. No transport was observed for the other compounds in any of the studied transporters. In summary, this work provides a step toward an improved understanding of the interaction of DLCs with three major hepatic uptake transporters. Ultimately, this can be of use in the development of DLCs that are less prone to transporter-mediated drug-drug interactions...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} {{of different}} cardiac glycosides are altered by renal dysfunction in different ways, {{depending on their}} basic pharmacokinetic properties. Digoxin: The linearity of digoxin pharmacokinetics is unchanged by renal dysfunction, as is the bioavailability. Protein binding may be slightly reduced, but the change is of no clinical significance. The apparent volume of distribution is reduced by one-third to one-half, the change being roughly proportional {{to the degree of}} renal impairment. The significance of this change in terms of adjustment of the loading dose is controversial. The renal clearance of digoxin is reduced in renal dysfunction and becomes very closely related to the measured creatinine clearance at values of creatinine clearance below 30 ml/min. Digitoxin: There are technical problems with the measurement of digitoxin because of the need to separate digitoxin and its metabolites chromatographically before using the measurement techniques commonly applied. Such separation has not always been carried out, and this makes the interpretation of the available data more difficult. The bioavailability of digitoxin is unaffected by renal dysfunction. Protein binding is probably significantly reduced but the clinical significance of this effect is unclear since the apparent volume of distribution and total body clearance of digitoxin appear to be unchanged. In the nephrotic syndrome, which must be considered separately from the other forms of renal dysfunction, there is impaired protein binding but also probably loss of protein bound drug via the renal glomerulus. This leads to a proportionately large increase in total body and renal clearances, a shortening of the half-life and a fall in the steady-state plasma digitoxin concentrations. In other forms of renal dysfunction there is probably no change in half-life or in steady-state plasma digitoxin concentrations. There does seem to be a decrease in digitoxin renal clearance but this may be compensated for by increases in non-renal clearance, both by non-renal excretion of unchanged digitoxin and by metabolic clearance, with increased formation of the active hydroxylated and hydrolysed metabolites, as well of the relatively inactive reduced metabolites. Overall, the changes seem to contribute little of clinical importance. Little digitoxin is removed from the body by dialysis procedures. Lanatoside C, deslanoside, and the acylated digoxins: Since these glycosides are largely metabolised to digotxin, one would expect changes in their pharmacokinetics similar to those of digoxin. However, there is only enough information to conclude that this is probably so in the case of β-methyldigoxin. The protein binding of β-methyldigoxin is reduced, as is its apparent volume of distribution, and total body clearance. The reduction in total body clearance is mostly attributable to a reduction in renal clearance, which falls in parallel with creatinine clearance, although always remaining lower than creatinine clearance. Non-renal clearance falls little or not at all. As a result of these changes the ovarall half-life of β-methyldigoxin is prolonged and the fractional daily loss at steady-state is decreased. Dosages of β-methyldigoxin therefore need to be reduced in renal dysfunction. Little-β-methyldigoxin is removed by haemodialysis. For α-acetyldigoxin, renal clearance is reduced in proportion to renal function, and the half-life is prolonged. Little is removed by haemodialysis. Other glycosides: Little information is available about other cardiac glycosides. What little information there is, however, suggests that, as one would expect, the half-life is prolonged and renal clearance reduced for those glycosides which are mostly eliminated via the urine, while little or no change occurs for those glycosides which are mostly metabolised. Thus, for ouabain (g-strophanthin), and k-strophanthin, the half-life is prolonged and renal excretion decreased, while for <b>proscillaridin,</b> methylproscillaridin, and peruvoside there is no change. None of these glycosides is much affected by haemodialysis. Despite the changes in pharmacokinetics of digoxin compared with digitoxin, there is little to choose between the two drugs for use in patients with renal dysfunction. Arguments in favour of one or other can be marshalled but there is no good evidence that one is preferable to the other...|$|E
