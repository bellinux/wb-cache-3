60|$|A furious battle {{took place}} in the Irish Parliament. There, while nobody could deny that the eleven propositions would benefit the mercantile {{interests}} of the country, it was passionately urged that the last of the propositions, that which concerned the apportionment of Irish revenue to imperial purposes, meant the enslavement of their unhappy island. Their fetters, they went on, were clenched, if the English Government was to be allowed thus to take the initiative in Irish legislation. The factious course pursued by the English Opposition was much less excusable than the line of the Anglo-Irish leaders. Fox, who was ostentatiously ignorant of political economy, led the charge. He insisted that Pitt's measures would annihilate English trade, would destroy the Navigation Laws, and with them would bring our maritime strength to the ground. Having thus won the favour of the English manufacturers, he turned round to the Irish Opposition, and conciliated them by declaring with equal vehemence that the propositions were an insult to Ireland, and a nefarious attempt to tamper with her new-born liberties. Burke followed his leader. We may almost say that for once he allowed his political integrity to be bewildered. In 1778 and 1779 he had firmly resisted the pressure which his mercantile constituents in Bristol had endeavoured to put upon him; he had warmly supported the Irish claims, and had lost his seat in consequence. The precise ground which he took up in 1785 was this. He appears to have discerned in Pitt's proposals the germ of an attempt to extract revenue from Ireland, identical in <b>purpose,</b> <b>principle,</b> and probable effect with the ever-memorable attempt to extract revenue from the American colonies. Whatever stress may be laid upon this, we find it hard to vindicate Burke from the charge of factiousness. Nothing can have been more unworthy of him than the sneer at Pitt in the great speech on the Nabob of Arcot's debts (1785), for stopping to pick up chaff and straws from the Irish revenue instead of checking profligate expenditure in India.|$|E

40|$|Given {{the variety}} of {{approaches}} to mapping the universe of knowledge that have been presented and discussed in the literature, {{the purpose of this}} paper is to systematize their main principles and their applications in the major general modern library classification schemes. We conducted an analysis of the literature on classification and the main classification systems, namely Dewey/Universal Decimal Classification, Cutter’s Expansive Classification, Subject Classification of J. D. Brown, Colon Classification, Library of Congress Classification, Bibliographic Classification, Rider’s International Classification, Bibliothecal Bibliographic Klassification (BBK), and Broad System of Ordering (BSO). We conclude that the arrangement of the main classes can be done following four principles that are not mutually exclusive: ideological principle, social <b>purpose</b> <b>principle,</b> scientific order, and division by discipline. The paper provides examples and analysis of each system. We also conclude that as knowledge is ever-changing, classifications also change and present a different structure of knowledge depending upon the society and time of their design...|$|E
