2500|$|The {{traditional}} land or sea based MARS Radio <b>Phone</b> <b>Patch</b> {{is largely}} {{a thing of the}} past because land and sea based MARS stations have been dismantled in favor of Satellite Phones. However, modern military aircraft are still equipped with [...] HF radios, and many military aircrews still use MARS Phone Patches as a backup or substitute to Satellite Communications. The [...] provides 24/7 HF Radio <b>Phone</b> <b>Patch</b> service to all branches of United States military aircraft worldwide.|$|E
2500|$|The {{crew was}} awakened at 07:58 UTC. The day {{that began with}} some {{exciting}} news from Randolph Bresnik to Mission Control in Houston. Bresnik reported {{the birth of his}} daughter, Abigail Mae Bresnik at 17:04 UTC Saturday. [...] He had got the news by private <b>phone</b> <b>patch</b> through mission control shortly after the crew was awakened. Mission specialist Bresnik is the second astronaut to become a father while in space. The first was astronaut Michael Fincke, whose wife gave birth to a baby girl while he was working at the International Space Station in 2004.|$|E
5000|$|An autopatch, {{sometimes}} called a <b>phone</b> <b>patch,</b> is {{a feature of}} an amateur radio (or other type of two-way radio) repeater or base station to access an outgoing telephone connection. [...] Users with a transceiver capable of producing touch tones (DTMF signals) can make a telephone call, typically limited by settings in the autopatch module to be only to flat-rate numbers, such as local calls or toll-free numbers. The term <b>phone</b> <b>patch</b> more accurately describes {{a system that is}} dialed and connected by a user manually operating a base station, which was more common before computer technology made automation of the process easier.|$|E
5000|$|Gillies Rock (...) is an {{isolated}} rock lying 6 nautical miles (11 km) north of Mount Dasinger. Mapped by USGS from surveys and U.S. Navy air photos, 1956-66. Named by US-ACAN for Betty Gillies, ham radio operator of San Diego, CA, who for several seasons from 1960-70 arranged <b>phone</b> <b>patches</b> {{for members of}} USGS field parties in the Thiel Mountains, Pensacola Mountains, and elsewhere in Antarctica.|$|R
50|$|Current mobile {{software}} generally {{must allow}} a connection using a temporary state {{initiated by the}} user {{in order to be}} 'paired' with another device to copy content. There seem to have been, in the past, available reports of phones being Bluesnarfed without pairing being explicitly allowed. After the disclosure of this vulnerability, vendors of mobile <b>phone</b> <b>patched</b> their Bluetooth implementations and, at the time of writing, no current phone models are known to be vulnerable to this attack.|$|R
5000|$|Madey Ridge (...) is a ridge {{trending}} northwest from Mount Moffat {{along the}} north side of Berquist Ridge in the Neptune Range, Pensacola Mountains, Antarctica. It was mapped by the United States Geological Survey from surveys and U.S. Navy air photos, 1956-66, and was named by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names for Jules Madey of Clark, New Jersey, a ham radio operator who arranged innumerable <b>phone</b> <b>patches</b> between personnel in Antarctica and parties in the U.S. in the period 1957-67.|$|R

5000|$|Some {{countries}} {{allow the}} direct connection of amateur transceivers to telephone lines called [...] "phone patching". Thus, a traveler {{may be able}} to call another amateur station and, via a <b>phone</b> <b>patch,</b> speak directly with someone else by telephone.|$|E
5000|$|Skilton Ledge (...) is a {{relatively}} flat rectangular rock platform at the southeast margin of Midnight Plateau, Darwin Mountains. The upper surface (2070 m) is ice covered but a rock cliff forms the south end. Named after Larry Skilton, Connecticut ham radio operator who made <b>phone</b> <b>patches</b> in the United States to complete radio communications from United States Antarctic Program (USAP) science stations including Palmer, McMurdo, Byrd surface station, and particularly South Pole. He worked a regular nightly schedule for 11 years (1990-2001) and arranged the completion of several thousand calls.|$|R
5000|$|Upon {{successful}} linking, {{the receiving}} station generally emits an audible alarm and shows a visual {{alert to the}} operator, thus indicating the incoming call. It also indicates the callsign or other identifying information of the linked station, similar to Caller ID. The operator then un-mutes the radio and answers the call then can talk in a regular conversation or negotiates a data link using voice or the ALE built-in short text message format. Alternatively, digital data can be exchanged via a built-in or external modem (such as a STANAG 5066 or MIL-STD-188-110B serial tone modem) depending on needs and availability. The ALE built-in text messaging facility {{can be used to}} transfer short text messages as an [...] "orderwire" [...] to allow operators to coordinate external equipment such as <b>phone</b> <b>patches</b> or non-embedded digital links, or for short tactical messages.|$|R
5000|$|The {{history of}} mobile phones {{can be traced}} back to two-way radios {{permanently}} installed in vehicles such as taxicabs, police cruisers, railroad trains, and the like. Later versions such as the so-called transportables or [...] "bag phones" [...] were equipped with a cigarette lighter plug so that they could also be carried, and thus could be used as either mobile two-way radios or as portable <b>phones</b> by being <b>patched</b> into the telephone network.|$|R

40|$|The {{popularity}} of camera phones enables many exciting multimedia applications. In this paper, {{we present a}} novel technology and several applications that allow users to interact with paper documents, books, and magazines. This interaction {{is in the form}} of reading and writing electronic information, such as images, web urls, video, and audio, to the paper medium by pointing a camera <b>phone</b> at a <b>patch</b> of text on a document. Our application does not require any special markings, barcodes, or watermarks on the paper document. Instead, we propose a document recognition algorithm that automatically determines the location of a patch of text in a large collection of document images given a small document image. This is very challenging because the majority of phone cameras lack autofocus and macro capabilities and they produce low quality images and video. W...|$|R
50|$|Their short {{wavelength}} allows narrow {{beams of}} microwaves {{to be produced}} by conveniently small high gain antennas from a half meter to 5 meters in diameter. Therefore, beams of microwaves are used for point-to-point communication links, and for radar. An advantage of narrow beams is that they don't interfere with nearby equipment using the same frequency, allowing frequency reuse by nearby transmitters. Parabolic ("dish") antennas are {{the most widely used}} directive antennas at microwave frequencies, but horn antennas, slot antennas and dielectric lens antennas are also used. Flat microstrip antennas are being increasingly used in consumer devices. Another directive antenna practical at microwave frequencies is the phased array, a computer-controlled array of antennas which produces a beam which can be electronically steered in different directions. Where omnidirectional antennas are required, for example in wireless devices and Wifi routers for wireless LANs, small monopoles, such as the inverted F antenna (PIFA) in cell <b>phones,</b> dipole, or <b>patch</b> antennas are used.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Recently, {{cellular}} phone networks have begun allowing third-party applications {{to run over}} certain open-API phone operating systems such as Windows Mobile, Iphone and Google’s Android platform. However, with this increased openness, the fear of rogue programs written to propagate from one phone to another becomes ever more real. This paper proposes a countermechanism to contain the propagation of a mobile worm at the earliest stage by patching an optimal set of selected phones. The counter-mechanism continually extracts a social relationship graph between mobile phones via {{an analysis of the}} network traffic. As {{people are more likely to}} open and download content that they receive from friends, this social relationship graph is representative of the most likely propagation path of a mobile worm. The counter mechanism partitions the social relationship graph via two different algorithms, balanced and clustered partitioning and selects an optimal set of <b>phones</b> to be <b>patched</b> first as those which have the capability to infect the most number of other phones. The performance of these partitioning algorithms is compared against a benchmark random partitioning scheme. Through extensive trace-driven experiments using real IP packet traces from one of the largest cellular networks in the US, we demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed counter-mechanism in containing a mobile worm.

5000|$|With {{her past}} persona as Samantha Caine all but dead Charly decides {{to flee the}} country, needing only one thing: the key she had given Caitlin to {{remember}} her by. The key gives her access to a bank where she has stored a vast sum of money, funds which will help her to leave the US undetected and set up wherever she wanted. Paying a visit to her old town, she takes the key off of the stuffed bear of Caitlin's she had previously attached it to. Before leaving she has a quiet moment viewing Caitlin through the scope of her sniper rifle at the church across the street. While doing this, Mitch is besieged by a car of agents and is must flee in the car to evade capture. Samantha saves him by ice skating across the pond she had previously taken Caitlin to for ice skating lessons and kills all three men before they can get to Mitch. During the chase, Timothy has snuck into the church where Caitlin is and kidnaps her, using her as bait and calling Charly to surrender. While he has set a meeting place at a nearby hotel for her to mostly likely be ambushed in, Mitch suggests they reroute to the local <b>phone</b> company and <b>patch</b> in from there. Charly and Mitch successfully are able to fool Timothy, and Charly realizes that they can also trace Timothy's signal.|$|R

5000|$|On the {{afternoon}} of October 16, the last day for filing of COC and a day after her father's submission for the same position, Duterte's daughter, Sara, posted on her Instagram account a photo of her COC, while hinting that her father would seek a higher post and withdraw his COC for mayoral re-election. However, in a radio interview with Bong Go, he stated that while Sara's COC was filled out, it was not received by the Comelec in Davao City. Hundreds of supporters were reportedly rallying outside the Comelec office expecting Duterte to file his candidacy {{on the last day}} of submission before the cut-off at 5:00 pm. Duterte's possibility of substitution until December 10 was opened after Martin Diño, father of celebrity Liza Diño and chairman of the Volunteers Against Crime and Corruption (VACC) and former barangay captain of Brgy. San Antonio, Quezon City, filed his candidacy for president at the last minute. Diño is a member of PDP-Laban, the same party advocating the federalism system where Duterte belongs. Diño clarified that there was a [...] "clerical error" [...] on his submitted COC (running for Pasay City mayor, instead of president). On their general meeting held in Pasay City on October 26, members of PDP-Laban had expressed their support to Diño in his presidential bid. On October 21, Duterte told CNN Philippines' News.PH via <b>phone</b> <b>patch</b> interview that there was still a chance he would change his mind.

Pamu and Kevin fooled around about Filipino women's {{behaviour}} while Steph and Unad had serious discussions about the Philippines with Seichang and Ryan. The OFKs were also taught how to do the maglalatik dance and create a routine. Lyn said in her <b>phone</b> <b>patch</b> that she'd like to give her mother a gift for Christmas. While talking about her mother at the confession room, Big Brother played a message of Lyn's sister telling her that their mother died the night before; the housemates comforted Lyn after the message was played all over the house. At the Luxury House, the housemates chose a luxury item from a list of items in a colored wheel. They did not like threading; Big Brother gave them a second chance to spin the wheel and won a maniped, but only half the group will take advantage of it. Kigoy went to the Industrial House confession room for an elegant date with Pamu, and his tutors watched the date take place. Big Brother brought Kigoy to a secret room with a bank of TVs which aired a This is Your Life-style presentation, complete with footage from a recent interview by the production staff with his mother, whom he had not seen in years and also shared some revelations about his past. Kigoy confirmed to Carlo that the earlier news report was about him indeed. Voting for both houses was stopped because of a housemate preparing a voluntary exit and another being force-evicted. The housemates were briefed on their next major inter-House contest: posing for ten hours in a tableau about the Nativity of Jesus, complete with the animals and the three Kings. The object was to keep still for the entire duration and move as less as possible, with shift changes every hour. Wayuk resolved to work harder and win the battle for Lyn, while Big Brother agreed with Luz' proposal to donate the prize money to Lyn to help cover the funeral expenses.|$|E
