2500|$|Critics {{were divided}} about Villa's [...] "comma poems". On one side, they were irritated by them, calling them [...] "gimmicky". Leonard Casper wrote in New Writings from the Philippines that the {{technique}} of <b>putting</b> <b>commas</b> after every word [...] "is as demonstrably malfunctional as a dragging foot". Ten years later, Casper continued to criticize Villa because he [...] "still uses the 'commas' with inadequate understanding and skill". On the other hand, Sitwell wrote in The American Genius magazine that the comma poem [...] "springs with a wild force, straight from the poet's being, from his blood, from his spirit, as a fire breaks from wood, or as a flower grows from its soil".|$|R

50|$|Despite {{persistent}} {{attempts by}} the Language Council to promote it, the new comma was not widely used and it was often criticized in the public debate. In 2003, the Language Council suddenly changed the comma rules {{with support from the}} Ministers of Culture and of Education. The two rather similar grammatical comma systems were merged into a single system under which one is free to choose one or other approach to the single issue on which they differed. The 2003 changes are therefore more a matter of naming than of actual content. One of the few real changes is that it is no longer mandatory to <b>put</b> a <b>comma</b> (or other punctuation mark) in front of the word men (which means but).|$|R
30|$|When a word first {{appears in}} a language, whether as a loan or calque, or as a nonce formation, it appears that {{speakers}} are aware of its newness, that is they are aware that they are exploiting the productivity of the language system.

5000|$|The key to {{this style}} is naturalism, a studied, but unselfconscious, attempt to leave the {{impression}} that the grounds are untouched by human hands. The landscaper employs his artistry, through the use of various forms of asymmetric balance, to convince the visitor that the apparent wildness and randomness of the terrain is the product of artful Nature, rather than the artifice of Man. In contrast to previous formal gardens, with their geometrically designed parterres and pathways, their severely clipped shrubbery, and the artificiality of their topiary, which reflect an attempt to impose the gardener's will on Nature, the English garden adopts a more cooperative or collaborative approach. The English gardener and landscape architect, Capability Brown, compared his role as a garden designer to that of a poet or composer: [...] "Here I <b>put</b> a <b>comma,</b> there, when it's necessary to cut the view, I put a parenthesis; there I end it with a period and start on another theme.".|$|R

5000|$|R. Novaković (1973) {{does not}} support {{that he was a}} duke of Dalmatian Croatia, as no {{contemporary}} sources name him as such. According to him, Borna could only be the duke of that area that was at the time under Frankish supreme rule, and that he was active only in the area included in the rebellion against Frankish rule, that is, only west of the Una river. It is possible that Borna was the duke of an archonty not yet part of Croatia {{in the beginning of the}} 9th century, neither was Croatia at all included in the events of Ljudevit's rebellion. The war was fought only in the area under Frankish rule, while Dalmatian Croatia was outside those events, as it at that time was under Byzantine supreme rule. M. Atlagić and B. Milutinović (2002) treat him as a Dalmatian Slavic ruler. Another view is that it seems that after the Timociani did not receive aid, a part of them settled in Slavonia, it seems also that Borna moved with them; S. Prvanović (1962) viewed him as a duke from Timok-Kučevo that founded the first Croatian state, while M. S. Milojević (1872) treated him as a Frankish vassal in [...] "Littoral Croatia" [...] that originally held three counties in the Timok region. Prvanović claimed that F. Racki had falsified the RFA, that Borna actually was the duke of Guduscani and Timociani, combined, and that Racki had <b>put</b> a <b>comma</b> after Guduscani, based on the identification with Gacka in Lika and presumption that due to the geographical distance between the two meant that the two could not have had nearer contact nor a joint duke. Prvanović was not the first to put the Guduscani in the Timok region; 19th-century P. J. Šafárik and V. Karić located them around the Timok and Danube.|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{investigation}} is to point out common elements of reasoning in to two domains which appear to belong to very different disciplines: image analysis and philosophy.

Thus they emerge from the same source which unfortunately can only be classified as “unreliable ” in the light of rigorous investigation. 1. HUMAN´S DIFFICULTY WITH “REALITY” Both image analysis and philosophy set off from the same challenge: analysis and formal structuring of the “real world”. This “real world ” as the basic object of consideration, is beyond man´s capacity to perceive, i. e., the human is not able to wholly analise the “real world ” in an absolute way. This has been repeatedly formulated by philosophy, e. g. in Platon´s allegory of the cave.

40|$|Adverb Clauses, English GrammarThis {{lesson was}} {{developed}} by John Nelson and Tymofey Wowk, 2012 Making English Grammar Meaningful and Useful Mini Lesson # 14 Adverb Clauses: Don’t Use Future Tense The purpose of this lesson is to describe Adverb Clauses and illustrate a few characteristics of their use. Adverb Clauses provide information about the Main Clause of the sentences {{in which they are}} found. They are the only kind of Dependent Clause that is {{not a part of the}} Main Clause. They can be found either before the Main Clause or after it. There are a few important aspects to learn about them. Adverb Clauses and Adverb Phrases have several meanings, which are illustrated in the following chart. Notice the differences in some cases between the CONNECTORS used with Adverb Clauses and those used with Adverb Phrases. Meanings of Adverb Clauses and Phrases Meaning Adverb Clause Adverb Phrase Time The game was played after it stopped raining. The game was played after the rain. Reason The game was not played because it rained. The game was not played because of the rain. Purpose The game was delayed so that the field could dry. The game was delayed in order to let the field dry. Contrast Both teams came to the game although it rained. Both teams came to the game in spite of the rain. Since Adverb Clauses are not found within the Main Clause, they can be found either before it or after it. All of the sentences in the chart above could be expressed with the Adverb Clauses and Phrases coming before the Main Clauses. When an Adverb Clause precedes the Main This lesson {{was developed by}} John Nelson and Tymofey Wowk, 2012 Clause, it is preferable to <b>put</b> a <b>comma</b> between the Adverb Clause and the Main Clause. When the Main Clause comes first, a comma is not needed because the Adverb Clause Connector indicates the beginning of the Adverb Clause. (For example, notice the 3 commas in the preceding sentences.) Adverb Clauses have one characteristic that ELLs need to be made aware of. The Simple Future Tense cannot be used in an Adverb Clause when the clause expresses a future time. The Simple Present Tense or the Present Continuing Tense is used instead. Note the following examples: 1. Tomorrow, he will drive home. Tomorrow, he will wash his car. 2. Tomorrow, he will drive home and he will wash his car. 3. Tomorrow, he will drive home and wash his car. 4. Tomorrow, after he drives home, he will wash his car. 5. Tomorrow, he will drive home before he washes his car. All the examples in these sentences will take place tomorrow. When the two ideas are presented in separate sentences, as in example 1, they employ the Simple Future Tense. When they are combined by a Simple Connector, as in sentence 2, the Simple Future Tense is used with both clauses. Even in Sentence 3, where the Simple Connector connects phrases, the Simple Future Tense is used with both verbs. However, Adverb Clauses are used in both sentences 4 and 5. Notice that the Simple Present Tense is used in both Adverb Clauses in both sentences despite the obvious future meaning of the clauses. Future Tenses cannot be used in Adverb Clauses of time...|$|R
