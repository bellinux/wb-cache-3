Preliminary cytotoxicity experiments using B 16 F 10 melanoma cells showed lower toxicity in the con- centration range of 1 – 100 g/mL with increased rr triads.

These results are related to polymer, chemical and biological sensors, and tissue engineering and artificial organ studies.

40|$|Abstract—The {{correlation}} between the electrochemical (Donnan) potential and volume swelling was studied for synthetic polyelectrolyte hydrogels considered as models of cytoskeleton gel-forming biopolymers. Hydro-gels involving polyacrylic and <b>polymethacrylic</b> <b>acids</b> with varying network density were synthesized by a radical polymerization in aqueous solution. Electrical charge was introduced into the gel network by partial neutralization of monomer acids with several alkali and alkali earth (hydr) oxides. The electrochemical (Donnan) potential of synthetic gels was determined using conventional microelectrode tools for cell potential determination. It was demonstrated that the negative electrical potential of many anionic gels with various charges and network densities decreased with the degree of equilibrium swelling, i. e., with the decrease in water content in the gel. It was shown that a drastic phase transition in the gel structure from a swollen to a compressed state induced by K+/Ca 2 + exchange is accompanied by an analogous decrease in the absolute Donnan potential of the gels. A kinetic study demonstrated that the gel volume changed ahead of its electrical potential. This suggests that the volume phase transition in gel is {{the main cause of}} the electrical response.

40|$|Semiconductor/polymer nanocomposites are of {{increasing}} importance with their tunable properties {{being used as}} dielectric materials. This thesis focused on cadmium sulfide (CdS) /polymer nanocomposites. CdS has been combined with three polymer matrices, i. e. poly(styrene-divinylbenzene) [P(S-DVB) ], <b>poly(methacrylic</b> acid-ethyleneglycoldimethacrylic <b>acid)</b> [P(MAA-EGDMA) ] and sulfonated poly(styrene-divinylbenzene) [SO 3 H-P(S-DVB) ]. CdS/P(S-DVB) nanocomposite was synthesized by in-situ polymerization in a miniemulsion system using monomer as oil-phase. CdS/P(MAA-EGDMA) nanocomposite has been synthesized by ion exchange and precipitation processes. While, the CdS/SO 3 -P(S-DVB) nanocomposite has been prepared by sulfonation, ion exchange and precipitation. Agglomerated nanoclusters of CdS {{were obtained from the}} above in-situ preparation methods. The structure-dielectric property relationship of the nanocomposites is elucidated by various techniques such as UV – Vis, FTIR, UV-Vis DR, TEM, SEM, XRD, impedance analyzer, AAS, EDX, thermal conductivity analyzer and thermogravimetric analysis. Dielectric properties of the CdS/polymer nanocomposites have been studied at frequencies of 0. 1 – 1, 000 kHz. The decrease in dielectric constant was found in CdS/SO 3 H-P(S-DVB) nanocomposite. Considering that the SO 3 H-P(S-DVB) has very high dielectric constant due to its proton mobility, the replacement of the proton of SO 3 H-P(S-DVB) with the CdS particles caused the decrease in dielectric constant of the nanocomposite. Interestingly, an increase in the dielectric constant was also observed in CdS/P(S-DVB) and CdS/P(MAA-EGDMA) nanocomposites compared to that of CdS nanoparticles or pure polymers. It is also demonstrated that the unusual enhancement of dielectric constant of CdS/P(MAAEGDMA) depended on the concentration of CdS nanoparticles. The occurrence of strong interfacial interaction between CdS nanoparticles with P(MAA-EGDMA) polymer has been proved by FTIR spectra. One explains that an increase in dielectric constant is due to the increase of interfacial interaction among CdS nanoparticles and also CdS nanoparticles with polymer. These interactions increase the mobility of charge carriers and polarizability of electron. Based on the results of this study, it can be suggested that dielectric properties of CdS/polymer nanocomposites {{can be explained by the}} following unique properties i. e. nanosize of CdS particles, semiconductor property of CdS, the interfacial interaction between CdS nanoparticles and polymer and intrinsic properties of polymer.

40|$|Bacterial {{adhesion}} to soft-contact lenses is a {{major risk}} factor for microbial keratitis. Microbial keratitis, a potentially blinding condition, {{is the most serious}} complication associated with soft-contact-lens wear. Thus, curtailing adhesion of bacteria to soft contact lenses is a method of preventing microbial keratitis. One of the most implicated bacteria in soft-contact-lens related microbial keratitis is Pseudomonas aeruginosa. However, binding of bacteria to solid substrates is complex and incompletely understood. This thesis investigates and elucidates the mechanisms of P. aeruginosa binding to soft-contact lenses in order to advance antifouling science. 	This study consists of three main parts. First, the bacterium's motility appendages, which have been implicated in bacterial adhesion, were studied. Changes in bacteria surface association due to modifications of the appendages were investigated. Following this, the influence of anionic membrane surfaces on bacteria association was studied. Finally, utilizing what was learned, surface modifications via surfactants were explored for antifouling efficacy. 	Most current studies involving binding to contact lenses report end-point analyses with little understanding of the mechanisms of adhesion. Under phase-contrast microscopy, a parallel plate flow chamber, which provides a well-defined flow field, was utilized. P. aeruginosa binding was visualized and investigated, and its binding mechanisms were dissected. P. aeruginosa swimming motility increased attachment rates by increasing the bacterium's effective diffusion but did not change the bacterium's ability to bind. Additionally, pili are not necessary for attachment. Hyperpiliation, infact, hinders attachment. By direct observation individual bacteria, it is shown that P. aeruginosa has multiple binding sites. Removal of one binding site givs way to binding via other binding sites. 	Many contact lenses are anionic. Membranes with addition of anionic <b>poly(methacrylic)</b> and poly(acrylic <b>acid)</b> were investigated. Wild-type P. aeruginosa strain PAK exhibits an accumulation burst-attachment phenomenon on anionic hydrogel membranes when the suspending medium contains divalent cations and the membrane initially does not. Early-time accumulation rates of are larger than on counterpart nonionic hydrogels. The initial high accumulation rate is followed by spontaneous bacterial detachment to a low number of strongly bound bacteria. The bursting phenomenon arises from reversible divalent-cation bridging between the anionic bacterium and anionic charged sites on the hydrogel surface. Few strongly bound PAK bacteria remain on the gel surface is most likely due to increased water wettability compared to the nonionic hydrogels. Soft-contact-lens surface wettability can be increased by addition of surfactants. The ability of polymeric surfactants to modify contact lenses and prevent adhesion was studied. A polyethylene oxide/polypropylene oxide surfactants (Pluronic F 127) and ethylene oxide/butylene oxide (EOBO) polymeric surfactants were capable of increasing the wettability of soft-contact lenses. Surfactants absorbed into the lens matrix. Over time, the surfactants leach from the lens matrix and adsorb at the external lens surface. The surfactants increase the lens wettability by decreasing the air/water surface tension while also increasing the adhesion tension of the lens surface. A highly wettable surface slightly reduces bacterial adhesion of PAK bacteria in agreement with previous studies. However, prevention of PAO 1 bacteria was not possible, as surface wettability did not play a role. This study emphasizes the delicate balance of forces at play during bacterial adhesion to substrates. In addition, the many factors such as substrate, bacterium, and adhesive factors that play a role stress the difficulty of preventing adhesion...|$|R

The TR-ESR spectra for the ketyl radical show a dramatic change in {{electron spin}} polarization mechanism, from a predominantly triplet mechanism (TM) at low pH (below 6) to a predominantly radical pair mechanism (RPM) at high pH (above 7). The ratio of RPM/TM polarization exhibits a sigmoidal behavior as a function of pH which passes through an inflection point at pH 6. 9 (0. 1. The inflection point agrees well with previous estimates for pH-dependent cluster opening in <b>poly(methacrylic</b> <b>acid).</b> These results indicate that the pH-dependent cluster is capable of forming a cage around the geminate radical pair which restricts its motion at low pH.

40|$|Molecular {{dynamics}} {{was utilized}} {{to investigate the}} ability of anionic macromolecules to drastically change the morphology of calcite {{in the presence of}} magnesium ions. Anionic poly(acrylic acid) and <b>poly(methacrylic</b> <b>acid)</b> were compared with cationic poly(ethylene imine) in their binding behavior on calcite (104) and (110) surfaces. Poly(acrylic acid) and <b>poly(methacrylic</b> <b>acid)</b> showed preferential binding on (110) with strong electrostatic attractions, whereas poly(ethylene imine) was only weakly attracted to (104). The extent of the charge imbalance on the surfaces appeared responsible for the current results, which originated from the deficient number of the coordinating oxygen atoms of carbonate around the surface calcium. The results of the current study were in accordance with the previous experimental observations, where the {hk 0 } surfaces of calcite were elongated under the coexistence of the anionic polymers and magnesium ions. These results could be generally utilized in the polymer-controlled crystallization with broad implications in the specific interactions with crystal surfaces...|$|E
