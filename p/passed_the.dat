5000|$|Native {{inhabitants}} of the Alps were naturally {{the first to use}} <b>the</b> <b>passes.</b> <b>The</b> <b>passes</b> first became known to the outside world when the Romans crossed them to raid or conquer the region beyond. Romans, once having found an [...] "easy" [...] way across the chain, did not trouble to seek for harder and more devious routes. Hence, passes that can be shown as certainly known to them are relatively few in number: they are, in topographical order from west to east, the Col de l'Argentiere, the Col de Montgenèvre, the col du Mont Cenis, the two St Bernard passes (Little St Bernard Pass and Great St. Bernard <b>Pass),</b> <b>the</b> Splügen <b>Pass,</b> <b>the</b> Septimer <b>Pass,</b> <b>the</b> Reschen <b>Pass,</b> <b>the</b> Brenner <b>Pass,</b> <b>the</b> Plöcken <b>Pass,</b> <b>the</b> Pontebba <b>Pass</b> (or Saifnitz <b>Pass),</b> <b>the</b> Radstädter Tauern <b>Pass</b> and <b>the</b> Solkscharte <b>Pass</b> or Sölk Pass.|$|R

Both the Goal Attack and Wing Attack should be familiar with <b>the</b> long <b>passes</b> and <b>the</b> lob and drop <b>pass.</b> <b>The</b> Goal Attack should also be familiar with all styles of <b>passing.</b> <b>The</b> Goal Shooter should know how to do penalty <b>passes.</b> <b>The</b> Wing Defence should also be comfortable making lob <b>passes.</b> <b>The</b> Goal Defence should know how to make goal-line <b>passes.</b> <b>The</b> Goal Keeper should be comfortable making penalty <b>passes</b> and inbounding <b>the</b> ball.|$|R
50|$|The {{effect of}} <b>the</b> card <b>pass</b> {{is that an}} {{identified}} card is inserted somewhere into a deck. However, following rapid and concealed manipulation by the performer, it is then revealed {{to be on the}} top (or bottom) of <b>the</b> deck. A <b>pass</b> is achieved by swapping the portion of the deck from the identified card downwards, with the portion of the deck above <b>the</b> identified card. <b>Pass</b> techniques include: <b>the</b> invisible turn-over <b>pass,</b> <b>the</b> Zingone Perfect Table <b>pass,</b> <b>the</b> flesh grip <b>pass,</b> <b>the</b> jog <b>pass,</b> <b>the</b> Braue <b>pass,</b> <b>the</b> Charlier <b>pass,</b> <b>the</b> finger palm <b>pass</b> and <b>the</b> Hermann <b>pass.</b> Simply, a card pass is a secret cut of the deck (not to be confused with a coin pass which is a false transfer of a coin from one hand to the other).|$|R

The 41st Congress <b>passed</b> <b>the</b> Enforcement Act of 1870 to enforce its civil rights Amendments among a hostile Southern population. That Act, written by John Bingham of Ohio to mirror the Fourteenth Amendment, created penalties for violating another person's constitutional rights. The next year, Congress <b>passed</b> <b>the</b> Ku Klux Klan Act, which strengthened the Enforcement Act by allowing federal trials and federal troops to be used. Sherman voted in favor of both Acts, which had Grant's support.|$|E

5|$|According to polls, {{support for}} capital {{punishment}} had been steadily declining since the 1990s, {{but the majority}} of people in Utah still supported the death penalty in the period leading up to Gardner's scheduled execution. In 2010, Kay McIff of the Utah House of Representatives sponsored legislation to require condemned inmates to raise all appeal arguments in their first post-conviction petition, noting that Gardner's multiple appeals kept his case lingering on death row for nearly 25years. The bill, HB202, <b>passed</b> <b>the</b> Utah House by a margin of 67-to-5 on February 1, 2011, and unanimously <b>passed</b> <b>the</b> Utah State Senate on February 17. The legislation was signed into law by the Governor on 22 March 2011. The law denies any stay of execution after a first appeal, without a judicial review of new evidence (or a pregnant appellant), that a judge determines would have materially affected the original case.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{compromise}} <b>passed</b> <b>the</b> Senate in March 1970, it was blocked in the House by Representative Patman, who {{was determined to}} end silver in the coinage. The Senate <b>passed</b> <b>the</b> bill again in September, this time attaching it as a rider to a bank holding company bill sought by Patman. The bill, which also included provisions to eliminate silver from the half dollar and to transfer the rare silver dollars to the GSA, was approved by a conference committee and passed both houses. Nixon had intended to let the bill pass into law without his signature. When aides realized that as Congress had adjourned, not signing the bill would pocket veto it, Nixon hastily signed it just before midnight on December 31, 1970, only minutes before the deadline.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of the attacks, many governments across the world passed {{legislation}} to combat terrorism. In Germany, where several of the 9/11 terrorists had resided and taken advantage of that country's liberal asylum policies, two major anti-terrorism packages were enacted.

5|$|Calhoun was reelected to the Senate in 1845 {{following}} {{the resignation of}} Daniel Elliott Huger. He soon became vocally opposed to the Mexican–American War. He believed that it would distort the national character by undermining republicanism in favor of empire and by bringing non-white persons into the country. (See §The evils of war and political parties.) When Congress declared war against Mexico on May 13, he abstained from voting on the measure. Calhoun also vigorously opposed the Wilmot Proviso, an 1846 proposal by Pennsylvania Representative David Wilmot to ban slavery in all newly acquired territories.
