5|$|During the Suez Crisis of 1956, future Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson eased {{tensions}} {{by proposing}} {{the inception of}} the United Nations <b>Peacekeeping</b> Force, for which he was awarded the 1957 Nobel Peace Prize. As this was the first UN <b>peacekeeping</b> mission, Pearson is often credited as the inventor of the concept. Canada has since served in over 50 <b>peacekeeping</b> missions, including every UN <b>peacekeeping</b> effort until 1989, and has since maintained forces in international missions in Rwanda, the former Yugoslavia, and elsewhere; Canada has sometimes faced controversy over its involvement in foreign countries, notably in the 1993 Somalia Affair.|$|E
5|$|There {{are about}} 50,000 Jordanian troops {{working with the}} United Nations in <b>peacekeeping</b> {{missions}} across the world. Jordan ranks third internationally in participation in U.N. <b>peacekeeping</b> missions, {{with one of the}} highest levels of <b>peacekeeping</b> troop contributions of all U.N. member states. Jordan has dispatched several field hospitals to conflict zones and areas affected by natural disasters across the region.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, Marvel {{announced}} plans to release a series of educational comics the following year {{in partnership with the}} United Nations, depicting Spider-Man alongside UN <b>Peacekeeping</b> Forces to highlight UN <b>peacekeeping</b> missions. A BusinessWeek article listed Spider-Man {{as one of the top}} ten most intelligent fictional characters in American comics.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} governments linked the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to UN Peacekeepers in 1988 to the UNTAG operation, but the award {{was shared by}} peacekeepers and <b>peacekeeping</b> {{operations}} worldwide. Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar mentioned a number of UN <b>peacekeeping</b> operations (including Namibia) in his Nobel lecture in Oslo on 9 January 1989. Senator Graham Richardson also made similar comments in the Australian Senate.|$|E
5|$|Canada is {{recognized}} as a middle power for its role in international affairs with a tendency to pursue multilateral solutions. Canada's foreign policy based on international <b>peacekeeping</b> and security is carried out through coalitions and international organizations, and through the work of numerous federal institutions. Canada's <b>peacekeeping</b> role during the 20th century has {{played a major role}} in its global image. The strategy of the Canadian government's foreign aid policy reflects an emphasis to meet the Millennium Development Goals, while also providing assistance in response to foreign humanitarian crises.|$|E
5|$|Clark's divisional command {{came with}} the 1st Cavalry Division at Fort Hood, Texas. Clark was in command during three {{separate}} deployments of forces from Fort Hood for <b>peacekeeping</b> in Kuwait.|$|E
5|$|Expulsions of the non-Serb {{civilian}} population {{remaining in the}} occupied territories continued despite the presence of the UNPROFOR <b>peacekeeping</b> troops, and in some cases, with UN troops being virtually enlisted as accomplices.|$|E
5|$|In September 2013, the UN had <b>peacekeeping</b> {{soldiers}} deployed on 15 missions. The largest was the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO), {{which included}} 20,688 uniformed personnel. The smallest, United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP), included 42 uniformed personnel responsible for monitoring the ceasefire in Jammu and Kashmir. UN peacekeepers with the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO) have been {{stationed in the}} Middle East since 1948, the longest-running active <b>peacekeeping</b> mission.|$|E
5|$|Indonesia, in dire {{economic}} straits relented. President BJ Habibie {{announced on}} 12 September that Indonesia would withdraw Indonesian soldiers and allow an Australian-led international <b>peacekeeping</b> force to enter East Timor.|$|E
5|$|Malaysia {{has never}} {{recognised}} Israel {{and has no}} diplomatic ties with it, and has called for the International Criminal Court {{to take action against}} Israel over their Gaza flotilla raid. Malaysia has stated it will only establish official relations with Israel once a peace agreement with the State of Palestine has been reached and called for both parties to find a quick resolution. Malaysian <b>peacekeeping</b> forces have contributed to many UN <b>peacekeeping</b> missions, such as in Congo, Iran–Iraq, Namibia, Cambodia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Somalia, East Timor and Lebanon.|$|E
5|$|NATO {{air strikes}} that year helped bring the Yugoslav wars to an end, {{resulting}} in the Dayton Agreement in November 1995. As part of this agreement, NATO deployed a UN-mandated <b>peacekeeping</b> force, under Operation Joint Endeavor, named IFOR. Almost 60,000 NATO troops were joined by forces from non-NATO nations in this <b>peacekeeping</b> mission. This transitioned into the smaller SFOR, which started with 32,000 troops initially and ran from December 1996 until December 2004, when operations were then passed onto European Union Force Althea. Following the lead of its member nations, NATO began to award a service medal, the NATO Medal, for these operations.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the late}} 1980s, the Government has {{increasingly}} called upon the ADF to contribute forces to <b>peacekeeping</b> missions around the world. While {{most of these}} deployments involved only small numbers of specialists, several led to the deployment of hundreds of personnel. Large <b>peacekeeping</b> deployments were made to Namibia in early 1989, Cambodia between 1992 and 1993, Somalia in 1993, Rwanda between 1994 and 1995 and Bougainville in 1994 and from 1997 onwards.|$|E
5|$|The TAM {{has never}} seen combat, {{although}} 17 VCTP were deployed to Croatia for the United Nations UNPROFOR <b>peacekeeping</b> mission.|$|E
5|$|The United Nations Confidence Restoration Operation in Croatia, {{commonly}} abbreviated UNCRO, was a United Nations (UN) <b>peacekeeping</b> {{mission in}} Croatia. It was established under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter {{and approved by}} the UN Security Council (UNSC) Resolution 981 on 31 March 1995. UNCRO inherited personnel and infrastructure from the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR). Its command was located in Zagreb; the <b>peacekeeping</b> troops were deployed in four sectors named North, South, East, and West. Twenty different countries contributed troops to the mission.|$|E
5|$|A {{string of}} new <b>peacekeeping</b> {{missions}} were launched in Namibia, Yugoslavia, Somalia, and Angola by the Security Council which also triggered {{interest in the}} reform of the 15-member body. Germany and Japan in particular, as well as India and Brazil, launched efforts to gain permanent seats and veto rights at the Council. In the late 1990s, Secretary-General Kofi Annan improved the coherence of the United Nations, with a better coordinated development system and more effective humanitarian structures. The fight against the HIV/AIDS pandemic was energized, and a new concept of partnership between the United Nations and international business developed under the Global Compact. Other reforms included the revamping of <b>peacekeeping</b> operations following the Brahimi Report. The World Summit in 2005 recognized, albeit mainly symbolically, an international ‘responsibility to protect’ populations from genocide and the Human Rights Council replaced the discredited Commission on Human Rights.|$|E
5|$|As Africa's most {{populated}} country, Nigeria has repositioned {{its military}} as a <b>peacekeeping</b> {{force on the}} continent. Since 1995, the Nigerian military, through ECOMOG mandates, have been deployed as peacekeepers in Liberia (1997), Ivory Coast (1997–1999), and Sierra Leone (1997–1999). Under an African Union mandate, it has stationed forces in Sudan's Darfur region to try to establish peace.|$|E
5|$|Because of its {{neutrality}} policy, the Swiss army {{does not}} currently {{take part in}} armed conflicts in other countries, but is part of some <b>peacekeeping</b> missions around the world. Since 2000 the armed force department has also maintained the Onyx intelligence gathering system to monitor satellite communications.|$|E
5|$|Ex-spies and ex-spouses Bobbi Morse and Lance Hunter {{are on the}} run {{trying to}} uncover a {{conspiracy}} against them. With no help from S.H.I.E.L.D., the <b>peacekeeping</b> and spy agency that previously employed them, they enter into an uneasy partnership with rogue adventurer Dominic Fortune and his niece Christina Santos.|$|E
5|$|However, {{with the}} {{widespread}} support from various countries, the Philippines finally changed its policy. After Timorese Independence, the Philippines contributed medical and logistics personnel to Interfet, rather than ground troops. The UN named a Filipino, Lieutenant General Jaime delos Santos, {{to command the}} full-fledged UN <b>peacekeeping</b> force which takes over from Interfet on Tuesday.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, the UN {{deployed}} United Nations Operation in the Congo (UNOC), {{the largest}} military force of its early decades, to bring {{order to the}} breakaway State of Katanga, restoring it to {{the control of the}} Democratic Republic of the Congo by 1964. While travelling to meet with rebel leader Moise Tshombe during the conflict, Dag Hammarskjöld, often named as one of the UN's most effective Secretaries-General, died in a plane crash; months later he was posthumously awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. In 1964, Hammarskjöld's successor, U Thant, deployed the UN <b>Peacekeeping</b> Force in Cyprus, which would become one of the UN's longest-running <b>peacekeeping</b> missions.|$|E
5|$|In May 2014, Prime Minister Shinzō Abe said Japan {{wanted to}} shed the passiveness it has {{maintained}} {{since the end}} of World War II and take more responsibility for regional security. Abe said Japan wanted to play a key role and offered neighboring countries Japan's support. In recent years, they have been engaged in international <b>peacekeeping</b> operations including the UN <b>peacekeeping.</b> Recent tensions, particularly with North Korea, have reignited the debate over the status of the JSDF and its relation to Japanese society. New military guidelines, announced in December 2010, will direct the JSDF away from its Cold War focus on the former Soviet Union to a focus on China, especially regarding the territorial dispute over the Senkaku Islands.|$|E
5|$|Most Star Trek stories {{depict the}} adventures of humans and aliens who serve in Starfleet, the space-borne {{humanitarian}} and <b>peacekeeping</b> armada of the United Federation of Planets. The protagonists have altruistic values, and must apply these ideals to difficult dilemmas.|$|E
5|$|Operation Grandslam or Operation Grand Slam was an {{offensive}} undertaken by United Nations <b>peacekeeping</b> forces from 28December 1962 to 15January 1963 against the gendarmerie (military) of the State of Katanga, a secessionist state rebelling against the Republic of the Congo in central Africa. The Katangese forces were decisively defeated and Katanga was forcibly reintegrated into the Congo.|$|E
5|$|Returning to England in 1818, the 52nd were {{stationed}} in the Midlands, where they were responsible for domestic <b>peacekeeping</b> and policing {{under the command of}} Lt. Col. Charles Rowan, experience which fitted Rowan for his 1829 posting to establish a military-style metropolitan police service under Sir Robert Peel.|$|E
5|$|Roosevelt flew patrols {{in support}} of the Kurds over {{northern}} Iraq as part of Operation Provide Comfort in 1991. In 1996, George Washington played a <b>peacekeeping</b> role in Operation Decisive Endeavor in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In 1999, Roosevelt was called to the Ionian Sea to support Operation Allied Force alongside other NATO militaries.|$|E
5|$|Section 2.3(b): The AFL shall also {{participate}} in international <b>peacekeeping</b> peace enforcement and other by the UN, the AU, ECOWAS, MRU, and/or all international institutions of which Liberia {{may be a}} member. All such activities shall be undertaken only upon authorization of the President of Liberia {{with the consent of}} the Legislature.|$|E
5|$|Tharoor's {{career in}} the United Nations began in 1978 as a staff member of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Geneva. From 1981 until 1984 he {{was head of the}} UNHCR office in Singapore, during the boat people crisis, for which he led the organisation's rescue efforts at sea and succeeded in resettling a backlog of Vietnamese refugees. He also {{processed}} Polish and Acehnese refugee cases. After a further stint at the UNHCR headquarters in Geneva, during which he became the first chairman of the staff elected by UNHCR personnel worldwide, Tharoor left UNHCR. In 1989 he was appointed special assistant to the Under-Secretary General for Special Political Affairs, the unit that later became the <b>Peacekeeping</b> Operations Department in New York. Until 1996, he led the team responsible for <b>peacekeeping</b> operations in the former Yugoslavia, spending considerable time on the ground during the civil war there.|$|E
5|$|The Australian UNTAG contingents {{were awarded}} a Chief of the General Staff Commendation. The award was {{presented}} to both contingents by Defence Minister Beazley at a 2 March 1990 parade in Holsworthy honouring those who had served in eleven UN (and other) <b>peacekeeping</b> operations.|$|E
5|$|The Nigerian {{military}} {{are charged with}} protecting the Federal Republic of Nigeria, promoting Nigeria's global security interests, and supporting <b>peacekeeping</b> efforts, especially in West Africa. This is {{in support of the}} doctrine sometimes called Pax Nigeriana.|$|E
5|$|The Remembrance Garden {{features}} a pool, waterfall and Harcourt granite wall bearing {{the names of}} the conflicts and <b>peacekeeping</b> operations in which Australia participated following World War II, such as Kuwait (Gulf War) and East Timor.|$|E
5|$|The UN Charter {{was drafted}} {{at a conference}} between April–June 1945 in San Francisco, and was signed on 26 June 1945 at the {{conclusion}} of the conference; this charter took effect 24 October 1945, and the UN began operation. The UN's mission to preserve world peace was complicated in its early decades by the Cold War between the US and Soviet Union and their respective allies. The organization participated in major actions in Korea and the Congo, as well as approving the creation of the state of Israel in 1947. The organization's membership grew significantly following widespread decolonization in the 1960s, and by the 1970s its budget for economic and social development programmes far outstripped its spending on <b>peacekeeping.</b> After the end of the Cold War, the UN took on major military and <b>peacekeeping</b> missions across the world with varying degrees of success.|$|E
5|$|The UN {{has also}} drawn {{criticism}} for perceived failures. In many cases, member states have shown reluctance to achieve or enforce Security Council resolutions. Disagreements in the Security Council about military action and intervention {{are seen as}} having failed to prevent the Bangladesh genocide in 1971, the Cambodian genocide in the 1970s, and the Rwandan genocide in 1994. Similarly, UN inaction is blamed for failing to either prevent the Srebrenica massacre in 1995 or complete the <b>peacekeeping</b> operations in 1992–93 during the Somali Civil War. UN peacekeepers have also been accused of child rape, soliciting prostitutes, and sexual abuse during various <b>peacekeeping</b> missions in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Haiti, Liberia, Sudan and what is now South Sudan, Burundi, and Ivory Coast. Scientists cited UN peacekeepers from Nepal as the likely source of the 2010–13 Haiti cholera outbreak, which killed more than 8,000 Haitians following the 2010 Haiti earthquake.|$|E
5|$|The {{parties to}} the accord also agreed to the {{deployment}} of a UN <b>peacekeeping</b> mission in Croatia, which was later authorized through United Nations Security Council Resolution 721 of 27 November, following a formal request for deployment of the peacekeepers submitted by the Yugoslav government the previous day.|$|E
5|$|The {{squadron}} was re-equipped with F/A-18 Hornet {{fighters and}} moved to RAAF Base Tindal in 1988. It was placed on alert to support the Australian-led INTERFET <b>peacekeeping</b> deployment to East Timor in 1999, and saw combat in 2003 {{as part of the}} Australian contribution to the invasion of Iraq and in 2015 during the military intervention against ISIL.|$|E
5|$|Though the UN's primary mandate was <b>peacekeeping,</b> the {{division}} between the US and USSR often paralysed the organization, generally allowing it to intervene only in conflicts distant from the Cold War. (A notable exception was a Security Council resolution in 1950 authorizing a US-led coalition to repel the North Korean invasion of South Korea, passed {{in the absence of}} the USSR.) In 1947, the General Assembly approved a resolution to partition Palestine, approving the creation of the state of Israel. Two years later, Ralph Bunche, a UN official, negotiated an armistice to the resulting conflict. In 1956, the first UN <b>peacekeeping</b> force was established to end the Suez Crisis; however, the UN was unable to intervene against the USSR's simultaneous invasion of Hungary following that country's revolution.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the overall}} command of Australian Major General Peter Cosgrove, INTERFET began {{arriving}} on 12 September 1999 and was tasked with restoring peace and security, protecting and supporting UNAMET, and facilitating humanitarian assistance operations. With {{the withdrawal of}} the Indonesian armed forces, police and government officials from East Timor, UNAMET re-established its headquarters in Dili on 28 September. On 19 October 1999, Indonesia formally recognised the result of the referendum and shortly thereafter a UN <b>peacekeeping</b> force, the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) was established, becoming fully responsible for the administration of East Timor during its transition to independence. The hand-over of command of military operations from INTERFET to UNTAET was completed on 28 February 2000. Australia continued to support the UN <b>peacekeeping</b> operation with between 1,500 and 2,000 personnel, as well as landing craft and Blackhawk helicopters and remained the largest contributor of personnel to the <b>peacekeeping</b> mission. During these operations Australian forces regularly clashed with pro-Indonesian militia and {{on a number of occasions}} Indonesian forces as well, especially along the border with West Timor. Significant actions occurred in Suai, Mota'ain and at Aidabasalala in October 1999. However, with the security situation stabilised the bulk of the Australian and UN forces were withdrawn by 2005. Two Australians died from non-battle related causes, while a number were wounded in action.|$|E
