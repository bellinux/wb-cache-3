5|$|Waylon Smithers {{is offered}} {{a job at the}} Globex Corporation. When he refuses, the offer is passed down to Homer, the next-longest-employed {{individual}} at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. He informs his family that the new job pays better and provides free health-care for the family, but involves moving to Cypress Creek. The Simpson family initially opposes the move, but after they watch a promotional video about the planned community, they agree that it is much better than Springfield. Abandoning their house, the Simpsons <b>pack</b> <b>up</b> and leave town.|$|E
5|$|Modern writers {{all agree}} that Andrée's North Pole scheme was unrealistic. He relied on the winds blowing {{more or less in}} the {{direction}} he wanted to go, on being able to fine-tune his direction with the drag ropes, on the balloon being sealed tight enough to stay airborne for 30 days, and on no ice or snow sticking to the balloon to weigh it down. In the attempt of 1896, the wind immediately refuted his optimism by blowing steadily from the north, straight at the balloon hangar at Danes Island, until the expedition had to <b>pack</b> <b>up,</b> let the hydrogen out of the balloon, and go home. It is now known that northerly winds are to be expected at Danes Island; but in the late 19th century, information on Arctic airflow and precipitation existed only as contested academic hypotheses. Even Ekholm, an Arctic climate researcher, had no objection to Andrée's theory of where the wind was likely to take them. The observational data simply did not exist.|$|E

5|$|Squads {{from the}} larger group broke off and moved up the hill toward coal pit number three. One squad took up a {{position}} at the pit number three coal shed; another, at the pump house. A warning party was sent ahead of the squads into Chinatown. They warned the Chinese they had one hour to <b>pack</b> <b>up</b> and leave town. After only 30 minutes, the first gunshots were fired by the squad at the pump house, followed by a volley from those at the coal shed. Lor Sun Kit, a Chinese laborer, was shot {{and fell to the}} ground. As the group at coal pit number three rejoined them, the crowd pressed on toward Chinatown, some men firing their weapons as they went. The smaller group of white miners at the plank bridge divided itself into squads and surrounded Chinatown. One squad stayed at the plank bridge to cut off any Chinese escape.|$|E

25|$|Later in {{the same}} month, Key West {{suffered}} a fire that ravaged much of the city. Hundreds of homes and several cigar factories were destroyed, including Ybor’s still-operational main location. Needing jobs and not willing to wait for their homes and workplaces to be rebuilt, many tabaqueros decided to <b>pack</b> <b>up</b> their surviving belongings and board a steamship for Tampa. The fire also encouraged several Key West cigar manufacturers to either build a branch factory in Ybor City or relocate altogether. Cigar makers in New York and Cuba also took note, and many followed suit in the coming years.|$|E
25|$|On 28 April 1975, North Vietnamese forces fought {{their way}} into the {{outskirts}} of the capital. Later that afternoon, as President Minh finished his acceptance speech, in which he called for an immediate cease-fire and peace talks, a formation of five A-37s, captured from the Republic of Vietnam Air Force, bombed Tân Sơn Nhứt. As Biên Hòa fell, General Nguyễn Văn Toàn, the III Corps commander, fled to Saigon, saying that most of the top ARVN leadership had virtually resigned themselves to defeat. The inauguration of Minh had served as a signal to South Vietnamese officers who would not compromise with the communists. They began to <b>pack</b> <b>up</b> and leave, or commit suicide to avoid capture.|$|E

25|$|In 2013, the Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) {{sought the}} ability to <b>pack</b> <b>up</b> an MQ-9 in less than eight hours, fly it {{anywhere}} in the world aboard a C-17 Globemaster III, and then have it ready to fly in another eight hours to support special operations teams at places with no infrastructure. MQ-1 and MQ-9 drones must fly aboard cargo aircraft to travel long distances as they lack the refueling technology or speed to travel themselves; the C-17 is large enough to carry the aircraft and support systems and can land on short runways. Pilots traveling with the Reaper will use the ground control station to launch and land the aircraft, while most of the flying will be done by US-based pilots.|$|E
25|$|Silvio and Patsy rush to <b>pack</b> <b>up</b> {{important}} {{items from}} the Bing. They are intercepted by two Lupertazzi hit men, Ray-Ray and Petey B, and fired upon. Silvio is hit multiple times while Patsy abandons the car and flees while returning fire. Silvio is left in a medically-induced coma, from which doctors do not think he will awaken. Tony arrives back home and, hearing about the hits, orders his family to go into hiding. Carmela and Meadow visit the Baccalieris, who are all in shock over Bobby's death. At nightfall, Tony, Paulie, Carlo, and Dante Greco drive to an old suburban safe house. Tony goes upstairs to get some sleep, clutching the AR-10 assault rifle that Bobby gave him for his birthday.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Daryl (Norman Reedus) {{has been}} forced to travel with the Claimers, led by Joe (Jeff Kober). Daryl gets into a {{confrontation}} with Len (Marcus Hester) over a claim on who shot, and thus owns, a rabbit, and Joe informs Daryl of the rules, then splits the rabbit's meat between then. That night, when they rest, Len sneaks his half of the rabbit into Daryl's bag, and feigns the next morning that Daryl took it. Joe, however, reports he saw Len frame Daryl, and drags him away to beat him up. Joe returns alone and instructs the others to <b>pack</b> <b>up</b> and move out. As they walk away, Daryl's sees Len's dead body, an arrow struck through his head. They come across the train tracks and discover the candy wrapped left behind by Rick.|$|E

Goaded by other boys his age, Jack commits acts of vandalism and animal abuse. He later trespasses into a neighbor's house and steals her sheer nightgown.

25|$|In 1802 Napoleon {{built the}} Ourcq canal which brought 70,000 {{cubic meters of}} water a day to Paris, while the Seine river {{received}} up to 100,000 cubic meters of wastewater per day. The Paris cholera epidemic of 1832 sharpened the public awareness of the necessity for some sort of drainage system to deal with sewage and waste water in a better and healthier way. Between 1865 and 1920 Eugene Belgrand lead the development of a large scale system for water supply and waste water management. Between these years approximately 600 kilometres of aqueducts were built to bring in potable spring water, which freed the poor quality water to be used for flushing streets and sewers. By 1894 laws were passed which made drainage mandatory. The treatment of Paris sewage, though, was left to natural devices as 5,000 hectares of land were used to spread the waste out to be naturally purified. Further, the lack of sewage treatment left Parisian sewage pollution to become concentrated downstream in the town of Clichy, effectively forcing residents to <b>pack</b> <b>up</b> and move elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Lame Beaver discovers {{a strange}} rock in a creek in the mountains. It is {{actually}} gold, but the Arapaho chief knows nothing of its value. He makes {{it into a}} bullet for his new rifle. Pasquinel and his new bride Lise set up a proper household in St. Louis, but the fur trader feels out of place with the aristocratic society in which she lives. The citizens of St. Louis regard Indians as inferior, and hold {{that they must be}} assimilated into the white world, a view opposed by the more knowledgeable voyageur. He and McKeag eventually <b>pack</b> <b>up</b> and head westward to Lame Beaver's village. In the meantime, Lame Beaver leads his braves in a raid against the Pawnee, killing their chief using one of the golden bullets. But the Pawnee soon rally and the brave Arapaho is slain. Clay Basket is devastated when, with her widowed mother forsaken and her own fiance Pasquinel gone, the rest of the tribe ransacks their teepee. The old woman has to live out in the cold because no male family member is around to take her in.|$|E
