5|$|Abundant worldwide, most fungi are {{inconspicuous}} {{because of}} the small size of their structures, and their cryptic lifestyles in soil or on dead matter. Fungi include symbionts of plants, animals, or other fungi and also parasites. They may become noticeable when fruiting, either as mushrooms or as molds. Fungi perform an essential role in the decomposition of organic matter and have fundamental roles in nutrient cycling and exchange in the environment. They have long been used as a direct source of human food, in the form of mushrooms and truffles; as a leavening agent for bread; and in the fermentation of various food products, such as wine, beer, and soy sauce. Since the 1940s, fungi have been used for the production of antibiotics, and, more recently, various enzymes produced by fungi are used industrially and in detergents. Fungi are also used as biological pesticides to control weeds, plant diseases and insect pests. Many species produce bioactive compounds called mycotoxins, such as alkaloids and <b>polyketides,</b> that are toxic to animals including humans. The fruiting structures of a few species contain psychotropic compounds and are consumed recreationally or in traditional spiritual ceremonies. Fungi can break down manufactured materials and buildings, and become significant pathogens of humans and other animals. Losses of crops due to fungal diseases (e.g., rice blast disease) or food spoilage can have a large impact on human food supplies and local economies.|$|E

Using this approach, lipids may be divided into eight categories: fatty acids, glycerolipids, glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, saccharolipids, and <b>polyketides</b> (derived from condensation of ketoacyl subunits); and sterol lipids and prenol lipids (derived from condensation of isoprene subunits).|$|E
25|$|The {{biosynthesis}} of the rapamycin core {{is accomplished}} by a type I <b>polyketide</b> synthase (PKS) {{in conjunction with a}} nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS).

40|$|AbstractBackground: It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that Streptomyces malonyl CoA:holo acyl carrier protein transacylases (MCATs) provide a link between fatty acid and <b>polyketide</b> biosynthesis. Two recent studies have provided evidence {{that the presence of}} MCAT is essential for <b>polyketide</b> synthesis to proceed in reconstituted minimal <b>polyketide</b> synthases (PKSs). In contrast to this, we previously showed that the holo acyl carrier proteins (ACPs) from type II PKSs are capable of catalytic self -malonylation in the presence of malonyl CoA, which suggests that MCAT might not be necessary for <b>polyketide</b> biosynthesis. Results: We reconstituted a homologous actinorhodin (act) type II minimal PKS in vitro, When act holo-ACP is present in limiting concentrations, MCAT is required by the synthase complex in order for <b>polyketide</b> biosynthesis to proceed. When holo-ACP is present in excess, however, efficient <b>polyketide</b> synthesis proceeds without MCAT, The rate of <b>polyketide</b> production increases with holo-ACP concentration, but at low ACP concentration or equimolar ACP:KS:CLF (KS, ketosynthase; CLF, chain length determining factor) concentrations this rate is significantly lower than expected, indicating that free holo-ACP is sequestered by the KS/CLF complex. Conclusions: The rate of <b>polyketide</b> biosynthesis is dictated by the ratio of holo-ACP to KS and CLF, {{as well as by the}} total protein concentration, There is no absolute requirement for MCAT in <b>polyketide</b> biosynthesis in vitro, although the role of MCAT during <b>polyketide</b> synthesis in vivo remains an open question. MCAT might be responsible for the rate enhancement of malonyl transfer at very low free holo-ACP concentrations or it could be required to catalyse the transfer of malonyl groups from malonyl CoA to sequestered holo-ACP...|$|R

2500|$|It {{is unknown}} whether the same KS/CLF/ACP ternary complex chaperones {{the growth of}} a full length polyketide chain through the entire {{catalytic}} cycle, or whether the ACP dissociates after each condensation reaction. [...] A 2.0-Å [...] resolution structure of the actinorhodin KS/CLF, which is very similar to the dps KS/CLF, shows <b>polyketides</b> being elongated inside an amphipathic tunnel formed at the interface of the KS and CLF subunits. [...] The tunnel is about 17-Å long and one side has many charged amino acid residues which appear to be stabilizing the carbonyl groups of the chain, while the other side is hydrophobic. [...] This structure explains why both subunits are necessary for chain elongation and how the reactive growing chain is protected from random spontaneous reactions until it is positioned properly for orderly cyclization. The structure also suggests a mechanism for chain length regulation. [...] Amino acid side groups extend into the tunnel and act as [...] "gates". [...] A couple of particularly bulky residues may be impassable by the chain, causing termination. [...] Modifications to tunnel residues based on this structure were able to alter the chain length of the final product. [...] The final condensation causes the polyketide chain to [...] "buckle" [...] allowing an intramolecular attack by the C-12 methylene carbanion, generated by enzyme catalyzed proton removal and stabilized by electrostatic interactions in the tunnel, on the C-7 carbonyl (see 3 in Figure 1). This tunnel aided intramolecular aldol condensation provides the first cyclization when the chain is still in the tunnel.

40|$|AbstractBackground: Mithramycin, chromomycin, and {{olivomycin}} {{belong to}} the aureolic acid family of clinically important anti-tumor agents. These natural products share a common aromatic aglycone. Although isotope labeling studies have firmly established the <b>polyketide</b> origin of this aglycone, they do not distinguish between alternative biosynthetic models in which the aglycone is derived from one, two or three distinct <b>polyketide</b> moieties. We set out to determine the biosynthetic origin of this moiety using a recombinant approach in which the ketosynthase and chain-length factor proteins from the antibiotic-producer strain, which determine the chain length of a <b>polyketide,</b> are produced in a heterologous bacterial host. Results: The ketosynthase and chain-length factor genes from the <b>polyketide</b> synthase gene cluster from the mithramycin producer, Streptomyces argillaceus ATCC 12956, and the acyl carrier protein and ketoreductase genes from the actinorhodin <b>polyketide</b> synthase were expressed in Streptomyces coelicolor CH 999. The recombinant strain produced a 20 -carbon <b>polyketide,</b> comprising the complete backbone of the aglycone of mithramycin. Conclusions: The aglycone moieties of mithramycin, chromomycin, and olivomycin are derived from a single <b>polyketide</b> backbone. The nascent <b>polyketide</b> backbone must undergo a series of regiospecific cyclizations to form a tetracenomycin-like tetracyclic intermediate.
