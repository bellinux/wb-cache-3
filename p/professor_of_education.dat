5|$|During the First World War, {{relief work}} helped keep the women's {{societies}} in Wales active, though membership numbers began to fall. After the People's act of 1918, {{many of the}} regional branches began to wither. The Llangollen WSS resolved to disband in December 1918, handing their marching banner to the National Council, believing their work was done. While others, such as the Newport branch, revised their aims to form a Women's Citizen Association taking an active interest in welfare and social issues. Other branches continued the political vision of equal suffrage, notably Bangor, while the Cardiff WSS busied itself by attempting to secure the election of women to local government posts. The fact that the terms of enfranchisement were not equal to men ensured that the surviving suffragist societies still had a focus, and the first point of order was the bill to admit women as MPs. This was passed in October 1918 and seventeen women stood at the 1918 General Election. There was one female candidacy in Wales, Millicent Mackenzie, a former <b>professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>education</b> from the University College of South Wales and Monmouthshire, who unsuccessfully contested the newly formed University of Wales seat. It took until 1929 for Wales to return its first female MP, Megan Lloyd George, the youngest daughter of the former Prime Minister.|$|E

25|$|Klonsky {{became one}} of the leaders of the modern small schools {{movement}} which has done much to transform the face of secondary school education in the United State. His academic work focused on small school size as a solution to the problems of inner city schools; his early research on issues of school size and its impact on student achievement, school violence, and dropout rates, helped pave the way towards the development of thousands of new small and charter schools across the country. By 1996, he was the director of the Small Schools Workshop at the University of Illinois, Chicago, and in 1999, he was named by president Bill Clinton to the Academic Advisory Council of the National Campaign Against Youth Violence, where he advocated small schools as a mechanism for violence reduction. Klonsky is now a retired <b>professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>education</b> after teaching at several universities, including UIC and the Fischler School of Education at Nova Southeastern University.|$|E

500|$|God's Choice: The Total World of a Fundamentalist Christian School is a 1986 {{book written}} by Alan Peshkin. It is {{a profile of}} an Illinois Christian {{fundamentalist}} school—its policies, practices, and participants. Peshkin, then <b>Professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>Education</b> at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, intended his account to be both impartial and [...] "empathetic". He presents the fundamentalists as disciplined, dedicated, and determined with [...] "formulas for success" [...] opposite [...] "fragmented and defensive" [...] detractors. They believe in [...] "one Truth"—God's plan—and reject philosophies of multiple truths. A teacher told Peshkin that {{their job is to}} prepare students for this [...] "one pattern" [...] of thought. In turn, the community's constituents do not wish to leave, but appreciate conformity as an end in itself. Peshkin describes the school as a [...] "total institution": a place where many similar people live by their own formal rules apart from outside society, as based on Erving Goffman's 1961 essay. Peshkin asserts that this was a natural conclusion from a school [...] "based on absolute truth". God's Choice was the third book in his series of studies on school–community relationships. It was published by the University of Chicago Press.|$|E
500|$|Players' {{reactions}} to MissingNo. {{have been the}} subject of sociological studies. Sociologist William Sims Bainbridge stated that Game Freak created [...] "one of the most popular glitches ever in game history", and cited its creative usage by players. In the book Pikachu's Global Adventure: The Rise and Fall of Pokémon, <b>professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>education</b> Julian Sefton-Green noticed that in his study of his son's reaction to MissingNo.'s usage as a [...] "cheat", the child's outlook towards the game was altered drastically, and added that the presence of such elements as a result broke the illusion of the game as an enclosed world and reminded them that [...] "at heart, it is a computer program". The book Playing with Videogames contains an in-depth study of MissingNo., which details players' curiosity when encountering the Pokémon. It describes their tendency to compare notes on its appearance, and to give assessment and critique to each other's findings. The book states that, in their attempts to interpret MissingNo. as part of the series's narrative through fan art and fiction, Pokémon communities celebrated the game's imperfections and tried to imprint themselves on its canon. The author described these circumstances as unique to MissingNo., and called its popularity an unusual case.|$|E
