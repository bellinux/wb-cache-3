If at any point in their life the person develops numerous polyps, this would tend to suggest a diagnosis of FAP. (Absence of polyps does not 'clear' a person, as polyps can develop later in life; also a few polyps over time are not that uncommon in people without FAP. However a substantial number or a profusion of polyps would generally tend to suggest a diagnosis of FAP, and histopathology to determine whether or not any polyps are cancerous.) ...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher Education, 2001. Background: The term 'metabolic syndrome' {{is used to}} {{describe}} the clustering in a <b>person</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> factors 'which is associated with the chronic diseases of lifestyle. Considerable evidence exists that insulin resistance is the underlying common factor {{in the development of the}} metabolic syndrome. At present, urbanisation occurs very rapidly in the South African population. According to the literature urbanisation is accompanied by the adoption of Western lifestyles and dietary habits. Therefore, overnutrition, the prevalence of risk factors, morbidity and mortality from chronic diseases of lifestyle arc expected to increase among urbanising communities. Objectives: 1. The questions addressed were whether the metabolic syndrome exists in the African population of the Northwest province and if it does, what are the characteristics of this syndrome in this population? 2 The hypothesis tested in this study was that despite the concept of "healthy obesity" in black women (Walker et al [...] 1991) the metabolic syndrome will also develop in black South Africans when they adopt Western lifestyles, Study design: This study was part of the larger THUSA-study. THUSA was a cross-sectional study of 1854 "apparently healthy" African men and women volunteers, recruited from 37 randomly selected sites in the Northwest province and stratified for age, gender and level of urbanisation. A sub-sample of all the fasted Subjects, 193 men and 233 women, between the ages of 15 and 65 years was selected to investigate the characteristics of the metabolic syndrome. Research methods: A variety of research techniques were used by a multidisciplinary team to collect the data. The results were statistically analysed by using the SPSS 9. 0 programme, performing non-parametric statistical tests. Spearman's correlations were used to identify relationships between risk factors of chronic diseases of lifestyle and insulin sensitivity. The GLM Multivariate procedure was used to investigate interactions between risk markers for the chronic diseases of lifestyle and the insulin sensitivity index. Cross-tab statistics were used to calculate odds ratios. Logistic regression analyses were used to investigate the influence of lifestyle factors in the development of the metabolic syndrome. These relationships were used to investigate conditional probabilities in the predictive value of variables for early detection in the development of the metabolic syndrome. Results: The influence of urbanisation on this population was reflected in a deterioration in lipid profiles, an increased body mass index: (BMI) and percentage body fat (calculated from girths), increased iron status and an increase in insulin resistance. Although age was inversely associated with insulin sensitivity in the women, no linear association between insulin resistance and age was found. An increase in serum urea levels in women was associated with insulin resistance which should be further investigated as it may hold a key between kidney function and hypertension in African women. A progressive increase in the risk factors for type 2 diabetes (NIDDM), coronary heart disease (CHD) and obesity was detected in these subjects from a condition of high insulin sensitivity towards high insulin resistance. However, these risk factors were still within the boundaries of normal ranges (Chapter 6). Clusters of two and more (up to five in men and six in women) traditional risk factors for the metabolic syndrome were also found in these "apparently healthy" subjects. Clustering of two and more risk factors occurred in 25...|$|E

Most of what has been written involved institutional recruitment, yet the past two decades have seen an exponential rise in the delivery of home care. This shift has been accom-panied by an increase in the volume of research conducted in homecare, and the majority of home care recipients are elderly. The elderly experience a disproportionate occurrence of consumer fraud and are increasingly reluctant to give strangers access to their homes.

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{simultaneously}} examine a wide range <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> factors and clinical characteristics in their predictive value for the 1 -year severity of depressive symptoms. Data from 789 participants in the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA), a large psychiatric cohort study, with a major depressive disorder (MDD) at baseline were used. Depression severity at 1 -year follow-up was studied using linear and multinomial logistic regression models. Results of the analyses showed that high neuroticism, no partner and older age were found predictive of a poorer outcome independent of baseline clinical characteristics. Further, comorbid anxiety disorder, first episode, having a moderate subtype (vs. melancholic), and higher baseline depression severity predicted poorer outcome. To conclude, both risk factors and clinical characteristics independently predicted 1 -year severity of depressive symptoms.

40|$|ABSTRACT Quaternary {{prevention}} {{consists in}} the identification <b>of</b> <b>persons</b> at <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> excessive medicalization and their protection against new unnecessary interventions, avoiding iatrogenic damages. Here, we argue {{about the importance of}} quaternary prevention in specific primary and secondary prevention. The recent great development of preventive medicine, biomedicalization <b>of</b> <b>risks</b> and their treatment as if they were diseases, and the powerful influence of the commercial interests of pharmaceutical industries on the production of medical-sanitary knowledge alter classifications, create diseases and pre-diseases, lower cutoff points, and erase the distinction between prevention and healing. This situation converts larger amounts <b>of</b> asymptomatic <b>persons</b> into sick individuals and diverts clinical attention and resources from sick persons to the healthy, from older adults to young persons, and from the poor to the rich. Quaternary prevention facilitates and induces the development and systematization of operational knowledge and guidelines to contain hypermedicalization and the damages of preventive actions in professional care, especially in primary health care...|$|R

A particularly striking finding was a strong association with recent suicide attempt, suggesting common mechanisms contributing to aggression toward the self and toward others (Perroud et al. 2011; Tsiouris et al. 2011; Volavka 2013; Stefansson et al. 2015).
