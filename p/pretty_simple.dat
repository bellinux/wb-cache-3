President Barack Obama personally called Stevens to congratulate him on Butler's season. David Letterman had Stevens on his show for a guest appearance. Butler admissions inquiries shot up 67%. Stevens received fan letters from around the world, and his phone rang off the hook. He was invited to throw the ceremonial first pitch before the Chicago Cubs vs. Florida Marlins game in Chicago on May 10. [...] "It's all been very surreal," [...] Stevens said. [...] "If you are the runner-up, you don't expect to talk to the president." [...] "It's been a little overwhelming, because I'm a <b>pretty</b> <b>simple</b> guy," [...] he added.|$|E

She noted that Kesha [...] "manages to embrace her inner party animal and throw a neon-colored party at an abandoned motel {{in the middle of}} nowhere." [...] She stated that [...] "While the concept of [...] "a lot of pretty people dancing at dusk" [...] is <b>pretty</b> <b>simple,</b> the neon colors manage to amp up the video, as does the colored sand that's thrown around in the air and mixed with glitter." [...] Her conclusion of the video and of Kesha was that as simple as it may be, [...] "she manages to be both sexy and fun while rolling around in the desert." [...] Melinda Newman of HitFix criticized the video's first half, calling it [...] "predictable." [...] The video's second half, however, was met with praise with Newman commenting that the 'special effects at the end almost redeem it." ...|$|E

500|$|New York {{magazine}} writer Steve Kendell said [...] "Jerry's Painting" [...] was {{an excellent}} episode, and that he appreciated seeing Leslie portrayed in a sexier and more confident way than previous episodes had. Joel Keller of TV Squad said the main story with Leslie was funny, but the subplot was even better. He said it showcased the deadpan comedic talents of Adam Scott, and that April and Andy continue to be an excellent pairing. The A.V. Club writer Claire Zulkey called the episode [...] "a <b>pretty</b> <b>simple</b> episode that got funnier and more quotable as the episode rolled on". She particularly praised Adam Scott's performance, but {{said she did not}} look forward to the romantic pairing of Scott and Amy Poehler because she feels they lack chemistry. Alan Sepinwall of HitFix said the episode featured great scenes about government inaction and the way small-time media can make a frenzy out of any minor thing. He also praised the subplot with April and Andy, which he said demonstrated how the two characters getting married hasn't at all changed who they are.|$|E
500|$|The show resembles Desperate Housewives in many ways, {{including}} {{having a}} [...] "pilot" [...] that revolves around a death, according to Daily News critic David Hinckley. Hinckley {{states that the}} pilot presents {{each of the five}} main characters {{in a way that makes}} them intriguing, while tackling contemporary issues with a mix of comedy and drama. Hinckley lauded the show by saying [...] "... a Cherry drama rises or falls on the <b>pretty</b> <b>simple</b> test of whether it’s fun, and 'Devious Maids' has the right stuff to get to there." [...] Alessandra Stanley, the chief television critic for The New York Times, at first described the show as a [...] "landmark" [...] where the rich [...] "Beverly Hills employers are mere foils for the real heroines, who are poor, Hispanic and striving: desperate housekeepers." [...] Stanley felt that servant heroines are a bit of an overused perspective in 2013 as is the use of tongue-in-cheek humor. After describing the evolution of maid, butler and nanny roles on television, Stanley notes that this was not a show that depicts [...] "how the other half really lives", but rather [...] "an over-the-top dramedy".|$|E

On the game's puzzles, Honeywell stated that [...] "some of the puzzles are <b>pretty</b> <b>simple,</b> while others are difficult in the extreme. One nice thing is the almost complete absence of red herring items. Everything you find can be put to use somewhere". As with other reviews, Allgame praised the audio work, noting that [...] "the music is decent throughout the game, and the voice talent is stellar", closing with the comment that the game takes point-and-click adventures to [...] "insane new heights {{in terms of both}} fun and comedy". GamersHell praised the graphics of the game as [...] "superb" [...] but noted that [...] "it's not so friendly that it can only be played by kiddies". Although describing sound setup as [...] "a bit tricky", the reviewer praised the voice acting as [...] "very good" [...] and the music as [...] "top quality". However, although the review noted that the game had [...] "easy to use" [...] interfaces and menus, it was critical of the fact that [...] "at times it can be the frustrating 'hunt for the correct pixel' syndrome".|$|E
500|$|Wilhelm [...] "Deathshead" [...] Strasse, the game's main antagonist, {{has been}} {{previously}} featured as an antagonist of Return to Castle Wolfenstein (2001) and main antagonist of Wolfenstein (2009). For The New Order, the team achieved closure on his story; {{to do so in}} an effective way, they wanted to find an interesting angle to portray him: his personality is full of enthusiasm, and he appreciates life after his near-death experience in the previous game. When developing the Nazis, Matthies states that the team [...] "didn't want to cartoon-ify them", instead opting to treat them seriously. Gideon Emery, who portrayed Fergus Reid, auditioned {{for his role in the}} game. He described Fergus as [...] "a tough as nails soldier, who gives [...] both support and a pretty hard time in the process". Matthies felt that Fergus is a type of father figure to Blazkowicz, and that he [...] "only gives negative reinforcement". Conversely, he saw Wyatt as a [...] "sort of son surrogate", as Blazkowicz is tasked as being his protector and mentor, and that he gives [...] "positive reinforcement". Max Hass, a seemingly brain-damaged member of the Resistance, was inspired by the character of Garp from John Irving's novel The World According to Garp. Alex Solowitz portrayed Max in the game. [...] "Max was the most challenging character to cast, which seems counter-intuitive because he's a <b>pretty</b> <b>simple</b> guy on paper, but it took a tremendous actor to pull that off and a long time to find him," [...] Matthies said.|$|E
500|$|Erin Mullally {{was cast}} in the role and began filming {{immediately}} after Sorensen's departure from the production. In {{a statement from the}} press office at Five, they stated: [...] "As the character of Declan is extremely popular, and with some sensational storylines planned, it was decided that the character would be recast" [...] Sorensen expressed his delight that his character would continue {{as a part of the}} series saying: [...] "I'm really happy the character's going to continue because the producers and writers have given Declan some fantastic storylines. I'm really proud he's become as popular as he has." [...] At the time it was noted that recasts have occurred repeatedly throughout the history of the programme, creator of Neighbours, Reg Watson previously explained why he thought recasts were quintessential in the show saying: [...] "I always believed it was a pity, when actors chose to leave a serial that the character should go as well. A lot of time and money is invested in the character so we decided to recast if the character was important to the future of the storyline and the show itself." [...] It was this explanation that backed up Declan's recast. Sorensen also explained that the hand-over process would be simple adding: [...] "It'll be nothing over the top. I'm Declan one day and the next day it's Erin. <b>Pretty</b> <b>simple.</b> That's how it works, I can't continue, so Erin comes in and picks up the baton. I think it's easier for the viewers to accept when it's a simple change-over." [...] The recast had also upset fans of the character under the portrayal of Sorensen, in response to this he said: [...] "Erin will come in and play his version of Declan, he can't play it exactly as I do and I and the producers would never expect him to do it any other way. All I can say to the Declan supporters is that Erin will be terrific, give him a go, you'll be surprised." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Integration of {{explanations}} into a CSP solver {{is a technique}} addressing difficult question “why my problem has no solution”.

For edge-finding algorithm, this technique is then further improved. ...|$|R

Without resuming her seat, she quietly placed an arm in mine, and turned to her father, as much as to say we were ready. Mr. Hardinge led the way to the church, which was but a step from the rectory, and, in a minute or two, all stood ranged before the altar, with the divine in the chancel. The ceremony commenced immediately, and in less than five minutes I folded Lucy in my arms, as my wife. We had gone into the vestry-room for this part of the affair, and there it was that we received the congratulations of those humble, dark-coloured beings, who then formed so material a portion of nearly every American family of any means.|$|R

But Zenobia (whose part among the maskers, as may be supposed, was no inferior one) appeared in a costume of fanciful magnificence, with her jewelled flower as the central ornament of what resembled a leafy crown, or coronet. She represented the Oriental princess by whose name we were accustomed to know her. Her attitude was free and noble; yet, if a queen's, {{it was not that}} of a queen triumphant, but dethroned, on trial for her life, or, perchance, condemned already. The spirit of the conflict seemed, nevertheless, to be alive in her. Her eyes were on fire; her cheeks had each a crimson spot, so exceedingly vivid, and marked with so definite an outline, that I at first doubted whether it were not artificial. In a very brief space, however, this idea was shamed by the paleness that ensued, as the blood sunk suddenly away. Zenobia now looked like marble.|$|R

There's a ton of polygon dropout. And when things get busy, with dozens of onscreen enemies, projectiles, and explosions (which is in almost every scene), things slow way, way down, or animation frames disappear."

60|$|In writing Phineas Finn, {{and also}} some other novels which {{followed}} it, I was conscious that I could not make a tale pleasing chiefly, or perhaps in any part, by politics. If I write politics for my own sake, I must put in love and intrigue, social incidents, with perhaps a dash of sport, {{for the benefit of}} my readers. In this way I think I made my political hero interesting. It was certainly a blunder to take him from Ireland--into which I was led by the circumstance that I created the scheme of the book during a visit to Ireland. There was nothing to be gained by the peculiarity, and there was an added difficulty in obtaining sympathy and affection for a politician belonging to a nationality whose politics are not respected in England. But in spite of this Phineas succeeded. It was not a brilliant success,--because men and women not conversant with political matters could not care much for a hero who spent so much of his time either in the House of Commons or in a public office. But the men who would have lived with Phineas Finn read the book, and the women who would have lived with Lady Laura Standish read it also. As this was what I had intended, I was contented. It is all fairly good except the ending,--as to which till I got to it I made no provision. As I fully intended to bring my hero again into the world, I was wrong to marry him to a <b>simple</b> <b>pretty</b> Irish girl, who could only be felt as an encumbrance on such return. When he did return I had no alternative but to kill the <b>simple</b> <b>pretty</b> Irish girl, which was an unpleasant and awkward necessity.|$|R
40|$|Fundamentalists {{typically}} avoid influences {{from the}} outside world and form intense social bonds with members of their own group. Yet, active fundamentalists must create relationships with the objects of their missionary action, the Other. In this article I address the connections between the cultural practice of missionary work and the formation and maintenance of social ties among ultra-Orthodox Jewish missionaries belonging to the fundamentalist Hasidic sect Chabad-Lubavitch. These missionaries attempt to bring Jews to the beliefs and practices of Chabad by hosting Jews at Sabbath meals. This missionary act is an utterance that “speaks ” with multiple voices, indexing the missionaries as both friendly members of their local Jewish community and ideal Lubavitchers. Through these meals, the missionaries engage not only the local Jews but also other Lubavitchers in dialogue, constructing a community that transcends face-to-face interaction. A week after I arrived in Robertsville, Great Britain, Rabbi Sandler and his wife invited me over for Sabbath lunch. 1 Nervous about my first extended interaction with ultra-Orthodox Jews and aware that Orthodox Jews demonstrate their respect for the Sabbath by looking their best, I dressed carefully. 2 I selected a long, dark skirt that covered not only my knees but my ankles as well. My long-sleeved shirt was suitably conservative in cut and color and I accented my outfit with <b>pretty</b> but <b>simple</b> jewelry...|$|R

2500|$|After the race, Michael Schumacher accused Coulthard of [...] "unsporting behaviour" [...] in {{the battle}} for the race lead.
