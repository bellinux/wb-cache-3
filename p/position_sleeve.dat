40|$|Graduation date: 1975 This study compares {{remaining}} {{dresses that}} were worn by Mormon girls, ages one to twelve years, with dresses for girls {{of the same}} age group shown in the leading fashion magazines of the time. The review of literature indicates that little research has been done concerning dresses of Mormon girls during the first half century of settlement and colonization of the area known as Great Salt Lake and Utah Valleys. Only dresses were studied as it was felt that other clothing may not have been kept and preserved; this proved to be the case. Twenty-one dresses known to have been worn by girls ages one to twelve in the Great Salt Lake and Utah Valleys were located and documented. With the exception of one, these dresses dated from the decades beginning 1860 and 1890. Fashion magazines of the last century were researched for illustrations of dresses for girls {{of the same age}} group. One hundred and sixteen illustrations were photocopied. Eighteen general dress features were investigated and comparisons of the two groups of dresses were made on thirty-nine specific dress characteristics, including bodice style, neckline shape and <b>position,</b> <b>sleeve</b> length and shape, use of collar and skirt style. Comparisons were made with respect to the percentage occurrence of the specific dress characteristics for those decades for which sufficient data were available. Because of the inability of the author by {{the very nature of the}} study to make random selections for comparison, the statistical methods of comparison used were rank-order correlations and percentage occurrence by decades. Subjunctive comparisons of specific dress characteristics were also made. The results of the rank-order correlation of the specific dress characteristics studied showed a moderate degree of similarity between the dresses of Mormon girls and the fashion illustrations for the decades beginning 1860, 1870 and 1880, and a relativity high degree of similarity for the decade beginning 1890. The correlations were found to be + 0. 46, + 0. 40, + 0. 39 and + 0. 77 respectively. The study of percentage occurrence by decades showed a tendency toward lag in the usage in Mormon girl's dresses of some new styles shown in the fashion magazines for the decades beginning in 1880. This lag was less by the decade beginning 1890. Subjective study of the individual Mormon dresses revealed a high degree of skill in workmanship on the part of those individuals who made them, and similarities to specific dress characteristics as shown in the fashion magazines of each decade. The dresses with the highest number of similarities were those of the 1890 's. The usage of specific dress characteristics explains and supports the findings of the rank-order correlations and percentage comparisons. Comparisons of individual dresses worn by Mormon girls also showed a persistent usage throughout all the decades studied of a style of dress similar to those found in the fashion magazine illustrations of the late 1650 's and early 1860 's. Comparisons for the decades beginning 1840, 1850 and 1870 were impossible due to the lack of or small numbers of Mormon dresses. The findings of this study would indicate that, for the decades beginning 1860, 1880 and 1890, those who constructed dresses for the Mormon girls of the Great Salt Lake and Utah Valleys had knowledge of and used some of the styles shown in the fashion magazines of the time and that this usage increased with time...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Recently, guided implant surgery {{has been}} {{introduced}} and several studies verified its accuracy. While those studies reported on {{the accuracy of the}} entire procedure, this experiment wanted to evaluate the degree of deviation that can occur during the drilling procedure alone, due to the tolerance of the drill in the sleeve insert. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Drilling was executed in a plexi-glass box with a maximal inclination of the drills within the sleeve insert. Different <b>sleeve</b> inserts, <b>sleeve</b> <b>positions,</b> <b>sleeve</b> heights, sleeve insert heights and diameters were evaluated. RESULTS: The two tested sleeve inserts gave a maximum deviation in angulation of 5. 2 ° and a maximum horizontal deviation of 1. 3  mm at the implant shoulder and 2. 4  mm at the apex for a 13  mm implant. These deviations decreased if the distance of the sleeve above the plexi-glass box became smaller and hand hold sleeve inserts gave less deviation than drill hold sleeve inserts. The deviation increased by longer implant length, larger drill key diameter, shorter sleeves and/or drill key heights. CONCLUSIONS: For a minimal deviation during the surgery with a stereolithographic guide, {{it is very important to}} use the drill in a centric position, parallel to the cylinder. The use of longer drill keys and sleeves are critical for optimal accuracy. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} the sevoflurane concentrations produced within the Stephens anaesthetic machine circuit (vaporizer in-circle system) at different fresh gas flow rates (FGFRs), temperatures, vaporizer settings and vaporizer <b>sleeve</b> <b>positions</b> when used to anaesthetize dogs of different body sizes. Study design: Experimental non-blinded studies. Animals: Eighteen mixed breed dogs, weights 4 - 39 kg. Methods: Anaesthetic induction with propofol {{was followed by}} maintenance with sevoflurane in oxygen via the Stephens anaesthetic machine. In study 1, the vaporizer setting, temperature and circuit FGFRs were altered with the vaporizer sleeve down (n = 3), or in separate experiments, up (n = 3). Delivered (Fi′SEVO) and expired sevoflurane concentrations were recorded. Study 2 determined the vaporizer settings (sleeve up) required to achieve predetermined multiples of minimal alveolar concentration (MAC) of Fi′SEVO when sevoflurane was delivered to dogs (n = 12) of different bodyweights and at different FGFRs. Results: Delivered concentrations of sevoflurane were sufficient to maintain anaesthesia in all dogs, regardless of bodyweight, FGFR, vaporizer temperature and <b>sleeve</b> <b>position.</b> Fi′SEVO increased with increasing temperature, when the vaporizer sleeve was down, when vaporizer setting was increased and when FGFR was decreased. As the FGFR increased or the dog 2 ̆ 7 s bodyweight decreased, higher vaporizer settings were required to produce the same Fi′SEVO. The median Stephens vaporizer settings to achieve an Fi′SEVO of 1. 3 MAC ranged from 4. 3 to 5. 0 for a small dog (1 - 10 kg), 2. 5 to 5. 6 for a medium dog (15 - 25 kg) and 2. 5 to 3. 5 for a large dog (30 - 40 kg), depending on the FGFR. Conclusion and clinical relevance: The Stephens anaesthetic machine can deliver to dogs, weighing 4 kg and above, concentrations of sevoflurane sufficient or in excess of that required to maintain anaesthesia, at temperatures from 10 to 35 °C, FGFRs of 1 to 5 times the patient 2 ̆ 7 s estimated metabolic oxygen requirement and at any vaporizer <b>sleeve</b> <b>position...</b>|$|R

40|$|A new {{instrument}} used for treating femoral head osteonecrosis was recently proposed: the umbrella-shaped, Ni-Ti memory femoral head support device. The device has an efficacy rate of 82. 35 %. Traditional radiographic study provides limited {{information about the}} mechanical behaviour of the support device during an implant operation. Thus, this study proposes a finite element analysis method, which includes a 3 -step formal head model construction scheme and a unique material assignment strategy for evaluating mechanical behaviour during an implant operation. Four different scenarios with different constraints, initial positions and bone qualities are analyzed using the simulation method. The max radium of the implanted device was consistent with observation data, which confirms {{the accuracy of the}} proposed method. To ensure that the device does not unexpectedly open and puncture the femoral head, the constraint on the impact device should be strong. The initial <b>position</b> of <b>sleeve</b> should be in the middle to reduce the damage to the decompression channel. The operation may fail because of poor bone quality caused by severe osteoporosis. The proposed finite element analysis method has proven to be an accurate tool for studying the mechanical behaviour of umbrella-shaped, Ni-Ti memory alloy femoral head support device during an implant operation. The 3 -step construct scheme can be implemented with any kin...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} effects of <b>{{position}}ing</b> and <b>sleeve</b> type bracing on passive position sense of shoulder joints of healthy untrained subjects. Method: A cross over study was carried out on 26 subjects (13 male, 13 female) with a proprioception measurement device. The selected method of testing was passive reproduction of a target angle. Both shoulder joints of all the subjects were evaluated with and without a compressive neoprene sleeve type of brace at two different start positions (45 ˚ internal rotation, 75 ˚external rotation) with an angular rotational movement at a constant speed of 0. 5 /̊s. The angular displacements from the target angles {{at the end of the}} reproduction tests were recorded as position sense deficit scores. Results: The overall mean (SD) deficit score (0. 99 (0. 06)) was significantly (p, 0. 001) lower with the brace than without, and the overall mean deficit score was significantly (p, 0. 001) higher at the 45 ˚ internal rotation start position than at the 75 ˚ external rotation start position. However, there was no significant (p. 0. 05) interaction between brace application and start position. Conclusion: Terminal limits of range of motion facilitate the position sense of shoulder joints. Compressive brace application improves the passive positioning sense possibly by stimulating cutaneous mechanoreceptors. ...|$|R
40|$|The Dual Clutch Transmission (DCT) is a {{relatively}} new kind of transmission which shows increased efficiency and comfort compared to manual transmissions. Its construction is much like two parallell manual transmissions, where the gearshifts are controlled automatically. The gear-shift of a manual transmission involves a synchronization process, which synchronizes and locks the input shaft to the output shaft via the desired gear ratio. This process, which means transportation of a synchronizer sleeve, is performed by moving the gear shift lever which is connected to the sleeve. In a DCT, there is no mechanical connection between the gear-shift lever and the sleeve. Hence, an actuator system, controlled by a control system, must be used. This report includes modelling, control system design and simulation results of a DCT synchronization process. The thesis work is performed at GM Powertrain (GMPT) in Trollhättan. At the time of this thesis, there is no DCT produced by GM, and therefore the results and conclusions rely on simulations. Most of the used system parameters are reasonable values collected from employees at GMPT and manual transmission literature. The focus of the control design is to achieve a smooth, rather than fast, movement of the synchronizer sleeve. Simulations show that a synchronization process can be performed in less than 400 ms under normal conditions. The biggest problems controlling the <b>sleeve</b> <b>position</b> occur if there is a large amount of drag torque affecting the input shaft. Delay problems also worsen the performance a lot. An attempt to predict the synchronizer <b>sleeve</b> <b>position</b> is made and simulations shows advantages of that. Some further work is needed before the developed control software can be used on a real DCT. Investigations of sensor noise robustness and the impact of dogging forces are the most important issues to be further investigated. Implementation of additional functionality for handling special conditions are also needed...|$|R

40|$|Electrophysiologic {{studies have}} shown that {{spontaneous}} initiation of atrial fibrillation (AF) by ectopic beats may originate from within pulmonary veins. The extensions of left atrial myocardium are considered to play a role, but there is little detailed anatomic information available, particularly in humans. Thirty-nine human autopsy hearts were studied; 22 with AF and 17 without atrial arrhythmias. The muscle fiber arrangement of the left atrial wall and pulmonary veins was dissected. In 18 hearts, myocardial sleeves were studied microscopically; in five hearts, three-dimensional reconstruction of the fiber arrangement in the myocardial sleeves was performed. Of 99 pulmonary veins examined, 96 contained a myocardial sleeve. The length of the sleeves was largest in the superior pulmonary veins (P < 0. 01). There were no statistically significant differences between uniform and nonuniform muscle fiber arrangements. Microscopic evaluation revealed myocardial <b>sleeves</b> <b>positioned</b> on the adventitial side of the pulmonary vein, separated from the muscular media by a fibrofatty tissue plane. The most distal zone of the myocardial sleeves showed increasing fibrosis with encapsulation of small groups of myocardial cells and eventually with total disappearance of atrophic cells within fibrous tissue. Node-like structures were not encountered. There was no relationship with presence or absence of AF. The observation that the peripheral zones of myocardial sleeves are associated with increasing connective tissue deposition between myocardial muscle groups suggests a degenerative change that, from the histologic viewpoint, fits with progressive ischemia. These changes could provide a basis for microreentry and, hence, for atrial arrhythmia...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Enterally {{administered}} glucose modifies gut sensation, diminishes hunger, and slows gastric emptying by suppressing antral motility {{and stimulating}} pyloric pressures. We aimed {{to clarify the}} mechanism of small intestinal glucose sensing. METHODS: We studied eight healthy males twice, in random order. An antroduodenal manometry catheter was <b>positioned</b> with a <b>sleeve</b> sensor across the pylorus. Benzocaine, or vehicle alone, was given into the proximal duodenum as a bolus, followed by continuous infusion for 105 min (T=- 15 to 90 min). Glucose was also infused into the proximal duodenum at 3 kcal/min for 90 min (T= 0 - 90 min). Sensations of hunger, bloating, and nausea were assessed with visual analog questionnaires, blood was sampled at intervals, and energy intake at a buffet meal (T= 90 - 120 min) was measured. RESULTS: Perceptions of bloating and nausea were markedly less with benzocaine when compared with vehicle (P< 0. 05 for each), with no difference in hunger, or energy intake. In contrast, the suppression of antral waves and stimulation of phasic and tonic pyloric pressures, duodenal waves, and propagated duodenal wave sequences by intraduodenal glucose infusion did not differ between the 2 days. No difference in blood glucose, plasma insulin, or plasma glucagon-like peptide 1 between benzocaine and control was observed, whereas glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and cholecystokinin concentrations were slightly higher with benzocaine (P< 0. 05 for both). CONCLUSION: Mucosal anesthesia ameliorates unpleasant sensations induced by enteral glucose, but does not inhibit the release of gut peptides that feed back on appetite and gastroduodenal motility.

40|$|Abstract—Long-range {{underwater}} acoustic systems, such {{as those}} used in ocean acoustic tomography, require low-frequency signals covering a broad frequency band. To meet this requirement, a novel design based on of a tunable narrow-band high-efficiency sound projector has been exploited. The projector transmits a frequency sweep signal by mechanically tuning a resonator tube (or organ pipe) to match the frequency and phase of a reference signal. The resonator tube projector consists of a symmetrical pressure-balanced Tonpilz driver placed between two coaxially mounted tubes. The Tonpilz acoustical driver is composed of two pistons separated by preloaded ceramic stacks. The resonant tube is a simple. efficient, narrow-band, medium-output projector that operates at any ocean depth. Both projector tubes have slots (or vents), which are progressively covered or uncovered by sliding coaxial tubular sleeves. The frequency varies with the <b>sleeves</b> <b>position.</b> A computer-controlled electromechanical actuator moves the cylindrical sleeves along the tubes, keeping the projector in resonance at the instantaneous frequency of a swept frequency signal. The actuator smoothly tunes {{the frequency of the}} resonator tube in the bandwidth of 200 to 300 Hz during a 135 -s transmission. A computer synthesizes the linear frequency-modulated signal; compares the phase between transmitted and reference signals; and, using a phase-lock loop (PLL) system, keeps the resonator tube frequency in resonance with the driver frequency. The estimated PLL precision is better than 3 phase error. The system was analyzed by means of finite element analysis and electrical equivalent circuit simulation. The projector prototype was first tested at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) dock in Woods Hole, MA and later in the Pacific Ocean during a voyage of the R/V “Point Sur, ” November 2001.

40|$|The paper furthers the {{analysis}} of a recently proposed balancing methodology for high-speed, flexible shafts. This mechanism imparts corrective balancing moments, having the effect of simulating the fixing moments of equivalent double or single encastre mounted shafts. This is shown to theoretically eliminate/nullify the 1 st lateral critical speed (LCS), and thereby facilitate safe operation with reduced LCS margins. The paper extends previously reported research to encompass a more generalised case of multiple, concentrated, residual imbalances, thereby facilitating analysis of any imbalance distribution along the shaft. Solutions provide greater insight of the behaviour of the balancing sleeve concept, and the beneficial implications for engineering design. Specifically: 1) a series of concentrated imbalances {{can be regarded as}} an equivalent level of uniform eccentricity, and balance sleeve compensation is equally applicable to a generalised unbalanced distribution, 2) compensation depends on the sum of the applied balancing sleeve moments and can therefore be achieved using a single balancing sleeve (thereby simulating a single encastre shaft), 3) compensation of the 2 nd critical speed, {{and to a lesser extent}} higher orders, is possible by use of two balancing <b>sleeves,</b> <b>positioned</b> at shaft ends, 4) the concept facilitates on-site commissioning of trim balance which requires a means of adjustment at only one end of the shaft, 5) the Reaction Ratio, RR, (simply supported/ encastre), is independent of residual eccentricity, so that the implied benefits resulting from the ratio (possible reductions in the equivalent level of eccentricity) are additional to any balancing procedures undertaken prior to encastre simulation. Analysis shows that equivalent reductions in the order of 1 / 25 th, are possible. Experimental measurements from a scaled model of a typical drive coupling employed on an industrial gas turbine package, loaded asymmetrically with a concentrated point of imbalance, are used to support {{the analysis}} and conclusions...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{promoted}} {{the concept that}} rectus muscles pass through connective tissue pulleys located near the equator of the eye and act, in effect, as the muscle origins. Orbital muscle fibres (facing bone) terminate in pulleys, permitting adjustment of their position independent of the global fibres responsible for rotating the eye. The structure of pulleys (or muscle sleeves) and the passage taken by their muscle fibre insertions are unclear, and a detailed description is presented here together with {{a review of the}} active pulley hypothesis. Segments including the full width of single muscles were removed from the full orbital contents of dissection room cadavers and fresh perfusion-fixed rhesus and cynomolgus monkeys and prepared for light microscopy. Thin longitudinal sections were cut as facets from resin-embedded tissue blocks and montages assembled. Interrupted serial sections of selected regions of both species and ultrathin sections of monkey material were prepared for light and electron microscopy, respectively. Slender tendons leave the orbital surface of rectus muscles at intervals, aggregating and entering sleeves in humans and monkey; less frequently, tendons pass from the global surface to sleeves or insert directly in the posterior fascia bulbi. The orbital sides of sleeve rings are continuous with the fascial canopy of the globe and are 5 – 6 times as thick as the global sides; sleeve structure differs in the four recti. Medial rectus sleeves are the thickest, and contain smooth muscle, whereas little or none is present in the other rectus sleeves. Superior rectus sleeves are variable in structure and relatively insubstantial. A narrow interval separates muscles from the surrounding connective tissue equatorially in some preparations, consistent with a capacity to slide, but the tissues are contiguous in others, especially in monkey material. The structural organization of sleeves and their tendons, together with other presented factors, is inconsistent with a facility for the separate adjustment of <b>sleeve</b> <b>position.</b> The results favour the theory that sleeve tendons have just one role, to counter the viscoelastic resistance of global fascia – ocular and sleeve muscle fibres acting in unison. Whether the fragile sleeve structure can meet the physical demands of pulleys is questionable; but otherwise the veracity of the pulley hypothesis cannot be assessed from the structural relations of muscles and fascia bulbi reported...|$|R
