Additionally, in this publication the larger (parent) data elements that were previously comprised {{of two or more}} (child) sub-elements data elements, have been broken out into separate data elements. The current element (<b>parent)</b> <b>name</b> will remain and be displayed as a heading and the sub-elements (children) listed below and shown with their own reporting requirements and formats. These changes represent title and presentation changes only and no changes have been made to the reporting requirement. The element/sub-element changes are identified in the “Reason for Update ” column as such. Also, concurrent with this publication, the WCIO has removed all hardcopy and pre-ASWG references from the WCSTAT. If data providers still need instruction on how to report pre-ASWG units or hardcopy Unit Statistical Reports (USRs), they should use the archived versions of WCSTAT that reside on the archive section of the WCIO website. Furthermore, the hardcopy Unit Statistical Report form will be repositioned on the WCIO website as a stand alone product and be presented as a standard WCIO USR viewing format. If you have any questions about reporting report pre-ASWG or hardcopy USRs you can also contact a specific jurisdiction for more information on their reporting requirements...|$|E
