The transfer of potassium ions through nerve cell membranes is necessary for normal nerve transmission; <b>potassium</b> <b>deficiency</b> and excess can each result in numerous abnormalities, including an abnormal heart rhythm and various electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities. Fresh fruits and vegetables are good dietary sources of potassium.

5|$|Due {{to their}} similar atomic radii, {{rubidium}} and caesium {{in the body}} mimic potassium and are taken up similarly. Rubidium has no known biological role, but may help stimulate metabolism, and, similarly to caesium, replace potassium in the body causing <b>potassium</b> <b>deficiency.</b> Partial substitution is quite possible and rather non-toxic: a 70kg person contains on average 0.36g of rubidium, {{and an increase in}} this value by 50 to 100 times did not show negative effects in test persons. Rats can survive up to 50% substitution of potassium by rubidium. Rubidium (and to a much lesser extent caesium) can function as temporary cures for hypokalemia; while rubidium can adequately physiologically substitute potassium in some systems, caesium is never able to do so. There is only very limited evidence in the form of deficiency symptoms for rubidium being possibly essential in goats; even if this is true, the trace amounts usually present in food are more than enough.|$|E

We demonstrated that the recombinant inbred lines responded in different ways to nutrient stress. On average they developed longer coleoptyles, shorter roots and less numerous roots in the medium with high N and K content in comparison with the deficient medium. Also other responses were observed, which included RILs developing significantly shorter roots in the low-nitrogen-potassium treatment when compared to the high-nitrogen-potassium treatment. The lines were clustered depending on their individual response to stress with the use of Ward’s agglomerative method. The dendrogram shows four main groups (a-d) with RILs with similar response to caused stress. Susceptible lines were identified in groups ‘a’-‘b’, while tolerant lines clustered in groups ‘c’-‘d’. Cytological analyses of the elongation zone of the seminal roots of seedlings subjected to caused stress were carried out with the use of an inverted microscope. The analysis showed fluorescence of dichlorofluorescein (DCF) in the epidermal zone of the seminal roots, which proves the presence of reactive oxygen species (ROS).

A ten-week growth experiment was conducted where fish were reared in reconstituted inland saline water containing K+concentrations equivalent to 15 %, 40 % and 100 % (denoted as: Trt 15, Trt 40, and Trt 100, respectively) of potassium in 15 ppt seawater. A 15 ppt seawater treatment (CSW) was used as a control. Fish weight, length, survival, Fulton-type condition index, blood and water osmolality, and serum Na+and K+concentrations were evaluated. Gill NKA activity was also estimated. Fish reared in Trt 15 died during week 8. At the end of the experiment (week 10), no differences were observed in fish survival and total length among treatments Trt 40 and Trt 100 and control (P> 0. 05). Final weight was less in Trt 40 and Trt 100 than in CSW. Fulton-type condition index results showed that Trt 100 was more suitable for fish than Trt 40, but still not as suitable as 15 ppt sea water. Sodium(Na+) in serum was not affected by aqueous K+levels, whereas serum K+varied congruently with aqueous K+. Rabbitfish reared in Trt 40 and Trt 100 had greater blood osmolality than those reared in control seawater. Gill NKA activity also increased by 50 % in Trt 40 and Trt 100 as compared to control. The present study shows that potassium-deficient 15 ppt inland well water is not suitable for long-term culture of Siganus rivulatus. Results suggest that inland saline well waters greatly increase activity of NKA and consequently energy expenditure. Furthermore, K+does not appear to be the only limiting mineral in inland low salinity groundwater that affects fish osmoregulation...|$|R

40|$|Soil {{acidification}} can be {{accelerated by}} intensive farming or prevented by sustainable management practices. Soil acidification in a managed agricultural production system {{is caused by the}} transformation of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and sulfur (S), which releases protons (H⁺) to soil solution. Soil acidification decreases soil pH, causing adverse effects on plants and soil microorganisms. Acidification, coupled with aluminum, manganese, and iron toxicities, and phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and <b>potassium</b> <b>deficiencies,</b> can lead to low soil fertility. Soil acidity influences soil C and N cycles by controlling activities of microorganisms involved in the transformations of these two elements. Traditionally, lime materials are added to neutralize acidic soils and to overcome the problems associated with soil acidification, but they also influence C and N cycles, thereby affecting greenhouse gas (GHG) flux in soils. For example, liming has been shown to decrease nitrification-induced nitrous oxide (N₂O) emission from many agricultural lands. However, there are concerns that liming increases the availability of soil nitrate (NO₃̅), which is a substrate for N₂O emission through denitrification. The dissolution of liming materials can act as either a net source or sink for carbon dioxide (CO₂). Lime-derived CO₂ reacts with microbial respiration-derived carbonic acid in soils to yield carbonate material, serving as a sink of CO₂ in soil. In calcareous soils with high pH, agricultural lime (CaCO₃) serves as a net sink for CO₂ whereas in acid soils it serves as a net source of CO₂. In acid soils, increased availability of aluminum (Al³⁺) ions inhibits activity of methane (CH₄) oxidizers. Adding lime to soils has shown to increase CH₄ oxidation and reduce GHG emission. The present review brings together basic concepts of soil acidification and recent developments on the implications of liming in relation to C and N transformations and cycling, particularly GHG emissions from soils. Given the major influence of lime addition on soil microorganisms relating to C and N cycles, future research should focus on the role of liming on soil microbial communities to provide insight into combined mitigation of N₂O, CO₂, and CH₄ gases from agricultural soils...|$|R
