50|$|The {{fundamental}} quotient of square-inch {{analysis is}} item profit <b>per</b> square <b>inch</b> {{according to the}} formula item gross profit (dollars) / offer area (square inches) = item profit <b>per</b> square <b>inch.</b> Secondary calculations include unit volume <b>per</b> square <b>inch,</b> item revenue <b>per</b> square <b>inch,</b> gross profit and revenue per offer and per page. The elementary mathematical formulas involved in deriving the results of square-inch analysis can be easy modeled by formulas in a software spreadsheet. Support for page planning decisions requires that these results be numerically sortable.|$|R
50|$|Bentley used {{multi-valve}} engines {{from the}} beginning. The Bentley 3 Litre, introduced in 1921, used a monobloc straight-4 with aluminium pistons, pent-roof combustion chambers, twin spark ignition, SOHC, and four valves per cylinder. It produced appr. 70 bhp (0.38 bhp <b>per</b> cubic <b>inch).</b> The 1927 Bentley 4½ Litre was of similar engine design. The NA racing model offered 130 bhp (0.48 bhp <b>per</b> cubic <b>inch)</b> and the 1929 supercharged 4½ Litre (Blower Bentley) reached 240 bhp (0.89 bhp <b>per</b> cubic <b>inch).</b> The 1926 Bentley 6½ Litre added two cylinders to the monobloc straight-4. This multi-valve straight-6 offered 180-200 bhp (0.45-0.50 bhp <b>per</b> cubic <b>inch).</b> The 1930 Bentley 8 Litre multi-valve straight-6 produced appr. 220 bhp (0.45 bhp <b>per</b> cubic <b>inch).</b>|$|R
25|$|Another {{problem with}} shellac {{was that the}} size of the disks tended to be larger because it was limited to 80–100 groove walls <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> before the risk of groove {{collapse}} became too high, whereas vinyl could have up to 260 groove walls <b>per</b> <b>inch.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{font size}} was {{measured}} not in points but in pitches {{that is the}} number of letters per one inch of the typed line. As a result, 12-pitch fonts (12 letters <b>per</b> <b>inch)</b> were actually smaller than 10-pitch fonts (10 letters <b>per</b> <b>inch),</b> and roughly corresponded to the 10pt and 12pt traditional typographic font sizes.|$|E

25|$|Most American law {{enforcement}} agencies use Wavelet Scalar Quantization (WSQ), a wavelet-based system for efficient storage of compressed fingerprint images at 500 pixels <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> (ppi). WSQ {{was developed by the}} FBI, the Los Alamos National Lab, and the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST). For fingerprints recorded at 1000 ppi spatial resolution, {{law enforcement}} (including the FBI) uses JPEG 2000 instead of WSQ.|$|E
50|$|Mechanical Concrete is strong.

25|$|A {{variety of}} sieve sizes are available. The {{boundary}} between {{sand and silt}} is arbitrary. According to the Unified Soil Classification System, a #4 sieve (4 openings <b>per</b> <b>inch)</b> having 4.75mm opening size separates sand from gravel and a #200 sieve with an 0.075mm opening separates sand from silt and clay. According to the British standard, 0.063mm is the boundary between sand and silt, and 2mm is the boundary between sand and gravel.|$|E
25|$|Most {{web pages}} employ {{sans-serif}} type. Hinting information, spatial anti-aliasing, and subpixel rendering technologies have partially mitigated {{the perception of}} serif fonts on screen. Due to the basic constraint of screen resolution (typically 100 pixels <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> or less) the serifs in some fonts {{can be difficult to}} discern on screen. Some serif fonts, such as Georgia, are specially designed for web readability, employing higher x-heights in the letters, as well as sturdier serifs.|$|E

50|$|Pounds <b>per</b> square <b>inch</b> {{absolute}} (psia) {{is used to}} make {{it clear}} that the pressure is relative to a vacuum rather than the ambient atmospheric pressure. Since atmospheric pressure at sea level is around 14.7 psi, this will be added to any pressure reading made in air at sea level. The converse is pounds <b>per</b> square <b>inch</b> gauge or pounds <b>per</b> square <b>inch</b> gauge (psig), indicating that the pressure is relative to atmospheric pressure. For example, a bicycle tire pumped up to 65 psi above local atmospheric pressure (say, 14.7 psia locally), will have a pressure of 65 + 14.7 = 79.7 psia or 65 psig. When gauge pressure is referenced to something other than ambient atmospheric pressure, then the units would be pounds <b>per</b> square <b>inch</b> differential (psid).|$|R
25|$|The {{weight of}} an arrow shaft can be {{expressed}} in GPI (Grains <b>Per</b> <b>Inch).</b> The length of a shaft in inches multiplied by its GPI rating gives {{the weight of the}} shaft in grains. For example, a shaft that is 30 inches long and has a GPI of 9.5 weighs 285 grains, or about 18 grams. This does not include the other elements of a finished arrow, so a complete arrow will be heavier than the shaft alone.|$|E
25|$|Only five {{laminations}} or {{plates are}} shown in this example, so as to show the subdivision of the eddy currents. In practical use, the number of laminations or punchings ranges from 40 to 66 <b>per</b> <b>inch,</b> and brings the eddy current loss down to about one percent. While the plates can be separated by insulation, the voltage is so low that the natural rust/oxide coating of the plates is enough to prevent current flow across the laminations.|$|E
25|$|Characters were {{proportionally}} spaced, {{being from}} 3 to 9 units wide, {{with the size}} of a unit being selectable as either 1/72", 1/84", or 1/96", to allow for different sizes of type (10, 12, or 15 characters <b>per</b> <b>inch).</b> Tab stops could only be positioned at intervals of one-sixth of an inch, or one pica. To support backspacing over previously typed characters, the spacing code for the last 40 or so characters typed was mechanically stored by small sliding plates in a carrier wheel.|$|E

25|$|Cotton lisle is a finely-spun, tightly twisted type {{of cotton}} that is noted for being strong and durable. Lisle is {{composed}} of two strands that have each been twisted an extra twist <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> than ordinary yarns and combined to create a single thread. The yarn is spun {{so that it is}} compact and solid. This cotton is used mainly for underwear, stockings, and gloves. Colors applied to this yarn are noted for being more brilliant than colors applied to softer yarn. This type of thread was first made in the city of Lisle, France (now Lille), hence its name.|$|E
25|$|The Correcting Selectric II used a new ribbon {{cartridge}} mechanism. The cartridge contained both supply and take-up spools, permitting both easy ribbon {{changes and the}} use of several types of ribbon on one machine. The ribbons were wider than had been used previously, giving more typed characters <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> of ribbon. Successive characters were staggered vertically on the ribbon, which incremented less than a full character position each time. Different types of ribbons had different-depth holes {{in the bottom of the}} cartridge, which set the mechanism to advance the ribbon by the amount appropriate for the type of ribbon.|$|E
25|$|Doubling and twisting. The silk {{is far too}} fine to be woven, so now it is doubled {{and twisted}} to make the warp, known as {{organzine}} and the weft, known as tram. In organzine each single is given a few twists <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> (tpi), and combine with several other singles counter twisted hard at 10 to 14 tpi. In tram the two singles are doubled with {{each other with a}} light twist, 3 to 6 tpi. Sewing thread is two tram threads, hard twisted, and machine-twist is made of three hard-twisted tram threads. Tram for the crepe process is twisted at up to 80 tpi to make it 'kick up'.|$|E
