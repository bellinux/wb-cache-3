40|$|International audienceHereby, {{we report}} {{the case of}} a 12 -year-old girl {{developing}} oligoarthritis and progressing into a <b>polyarticular</b> <b>form.</b> Rheumatoid factor was positive, and juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) was diagnosed. After a poor response to DMARDs, an anti-TNF agent (infliximab) was initiated, but to be discontinued due to an allergic reaction. The same complication was observed with the fully human derivative, adalimumab. At the age of 22, the patient presented septicemia with severe anemia and subsequent development of leukopenia, myocarditis with heart failure, and ANA, aSm, aSS-A, aCL positives, and nephrotic syndrome. These new clinical manifestations fulfilled the classification criteria for the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus. Due to the poor therapeutic responses for both diseases, alternative medical options have to be considered, such as targeted therapy with anti-CD 20 or interleukin- 6 receptor antagonist monoclonal antibodies. This patient may also be a candidate for autologous hemopoietic stem cell transplantation...|$|E
40|$|Objective. To {{specify the}} {{diagnosis}} of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and to define the significance of pathogenetic changes, the authors have studied cellular and humoral immunological parameters, which are of the greatest informative value in this pathology: CD 4 +, CD 4 +/CD 8 +, CD 8 +, CD 16 +, CD 95 + in the serum, {{as well as a}} spectrum of interleukins (IL) : tumor necrosis factor-а, IL- 6, IL- 1, and IL- 4.

40|$|A {{successful}} {{treatment of}} {{juvenile idiopathic arthritis}} with rituximab: A report of two cases Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is defined as arthritis of unknown cause that starts before 16 {{years of age and}} lasts at least 6 weeks. It is the most common chronic inflammatory disease in childhood and often persists through adulthood and can lead to severe disability. Biolog-ics are an important therapeutic option for treating patients with JIA. The efficiency of rituximab has not been proven for this indication. Its use has rarely been reported in the literature. We report two new cases of severe and refractory polyarticular JIA with positive rheumatoid factor affecting two African females aged 17 and 18 years successfully treated with rituximab. According to our experience, the use of rituximab in the treatment of JIA, especially in severe <b>polyarticular</b> <b>forms</b> with positive rheumatoid factor, might be a good alternative. Larger therapeutic trials should be conducted in this direction in order to prove the effectiveness of this biotherapy for this indication.

40|$|Association of {{juvenile}} spondyloarthritis (jSpA) with the HLA-B 27 genotype is well established, {{but there is}} little knowledge of other genetic factors with a {{role in the development of}} the disease. To date, only a few studies have tried to find those associated genes by obtaining expression profiles, but with inconsistent results due to various patient selection criteria and methodology. The aim of the present study was to identify and confirm gene signatures and novel biomarkers in highly homogeneous cohorts of untreated and treated patients diagnosed with jSpA and other forms {{of juvenile}} idiopathic arthritis (JIA) according to ILAR criteria. For the purposes of the research, total RNA was isolated from whole blood of 45 children with jSpA and known HLA genotype, 11 children with oligo- and <b>polyarticular</b> <b>forms</b> of JIA, as well as 12 age and sex matched control participants without diagnosis of inflammatory disease.

40|$|Structural {{studies of}} human {{monoclonal}} rheumatoid factors (RF) derived from patients with monoclonal gammapathies have revealed a restriction in {{the usage of}} heavy and light chain variable regions. These {{studies have suggested that}} germline genes with little if any somatic mutation can generate RF specificity. However, there is no information presently available regarding the primary structure and genetic origin of RF in rheumatoid arthritis. In this study, we have isolated and sequenced the VH regions of six monoclonal RF derived from the synovial membranes of two patients with rheumatoid arthritis and one with the juvenile <b>polyarticular</b> <b>form</b> of the disease. We found the same VH families as previously reported among monoclonal paraproteins with RF activity. However, our sample was diverse regarding the VH, DH, and JH gene segments used. Among VHI RF there was conservation in the length of CDRIII as well as restriction in the amino acid generated at the V-D junction, as opposed to VHIII RF and non-RF VHI molecules that are highly heterogeneous in these two aspects. We also found that different JH gene segments may contribute to RF specificity. The VH, DH, and JH elements of one RF in our study all had clearly identifiable germline counterparts. This RF displays a nearly germline configuration throughout its entire heavy chain and represents another example of an autoantibody encoded by one of the VH gene segments from the preimmune fetal repertoire...|$|E
40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{determine}} the frequency of celiac disease (CD) in a group of children with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) and determine the correlation between the presence of the serologic markers and the histological diagnosis of CD. Patients and Methods : Forty-two children (24 females) with JRA, aged between 5 - 15 years underwent study of serologic markers for CD (gliadin-IgA, gliadin-IgG, reticulin and endomysium-IgA antibodies). Endoscopic intestinal biopsy was performed in patients who had positive serologic markers for CD. The diagnosis of CD was based on the classic finding of villous atrophy and crypt hypertrophy. Results: Eighteen patients (42. 8 &#x 0025;) had serologic markers for CD; ten of them with a systemic form, five with a <b>polyarticular</b> <b>form</b> and three with a pauciarticular form of JRA. Levels of AGA -IgG were high in 14 patients (77. 8 &#x 0025;), four patients (22. 2 &#x 0025;) had high levels of AGA-IgA and seven patients (38. 9 &#x 0025;) had anti-endomysium antibodies (AEA). One patient had anti-reticulin antibodies (ARA) 5. 5 &#x 0025;. Sixteen patients underwent intestinal biopsy; in only one patient with AEA antibodies (2. 38 &#x 0025;), biopsy revealed typical finding of CD. The patient with CD showed improvement in both growth parameter as well as articular symptoms after starting gluten-free diet Conclusion: Our study shows that the screening for silent CD among children with JRA may be useful.

40|$|Edward J Oberle, Julia G Harris, James W VerbskyDepartment of Pediatrics, Division of Rheumatology, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, USAAbstract: Juvenile {{idiopathic}} arthritis (JIA) is a {{group of}} disorders characterized by arthritis persisting for at least 6 weeks with onset before the age of 16 years. Within this cluster of conditions, the <b>polyarticular</b> <b>form</b> (involving more than four joints within the first 6 months) is further divided based on the presence of rheumatoid factor. Children with polyarticular JIA pose unique diagnostic and therapeutic challenges compared to children with involvement of fewer joints. Polyarticular JIA patients tend to have a more refractory course and therefore are at increased risk for joint damage, resulting in poorer functional outcomes and decreased quality of life. Although the ability to treat this disorder continues to improve, especially with the advent of biologic agents, there is still much about the epidemiology and pathogenesis of polyarticular JIA that is unknown. The epidemiology of polyarticular JIA varies worldwide with a vast difference in reported cases between different global regions as well as within individual countries. Several genetic risk loci have been identified conferring increased susceptibility to JIA, many within the human leukocyte antigen region. Beyond the genome, environmental factors also seem to contribute to the etiology of polyarticular JIA. This review article will focus on the epidemiology and current treatments of polyarticular JIA and briefly discuss genetic and environmental influences on the pathogenesis of JIA as well as new and emerging therapies.

40|$|Psoriatic {{arthritis}} (PsA) {{has been}} classically {{defined as an}} inflammatory arthritis associated with psoriasis. However, in comparison with other relevant inflammatory arthropathies, in which a definite diagnosis is frequently possible only by means of laboratory investigations, in PsA true laboratory diagnostic markers are lacking. Some markers are utilised more to differentiate other diseases than to characterise PsA. For example in polyarticular PsA, which may be in some cases indistinguishable from RA, the rheumatoid factor (RF) or the more specific and recently introduced antibodies to cyclic citrullinated peptides (anti-CCP), {{may be useful to}} better identify RA. However, RF was found in 5 % to 13 % of patients with PsA, and anti-CCP may be observed in almost similar percentage. The determination of ESR and/or CRP is frequently disappointing in PsA, since they are both elevated in only half of the patients with PsA. However, ESR and/or CRP are included in the most utilised response criteria for RA, such as ACR and DAS, and, in addition are also considered reliable in the assessment of PsA. Furthermore, elevated levels of ESR have been proposed {{as one of the best}} predictors of damage progression and, in addition, a low ESR seems protective, while an ESR > 15 mm/h is one of the factors associated with an increased mortality in PsA. The synovial fluid (SF) effusion is much higher in PsA, in comparison with other arthropathies. When available, SF analysis may offer additive information useful for the diagnosis, such as the increased number of leukocytes, which underlines the inflammatory nature of the effusion even in a patient with normal serum levels of acute phase response. We found that elevated IL- 1 levels in SF of patients with early disease (< 6 months), may be predictive of an evolution in <b>polyarticular</b> <b>form</b> at follow-up. This observation is in keeping with the crucial role that inflammatory cytokines play in PsA, probably related to a genetic predisposition. The recent introduction in PsA of anti-TNF-α agents and the demonstration of their efficacy in the management of many clinical disease expressions including peripheral arthropathy, axial involvement, enthesopathy and skin manifestations, have stimulated the research also in the field of the possible laboratory markers.

The mean ANB values were 4. 2 degrees (SD = 2. 9 degrees) in the oligoarticular group and 5. 1 degrees (SD = 3. 8 degrees) in the polyarticular group. Just under one-third of children had a moderate or severe class II skeletal pattern and a further quarter of children had a mild class II skeletal pattern. Clinical signs and symptoms of temporomandibular joint pain dysfunction syndrome were low (< 20 %), except for crepitus and click which affected between 24 and 40 % of JIA children. Radiographically, 57 % of oligoarticular and 77 % of polyarticular cases exhibited condylar erosion. Use of systemic corticosteroids varied between centres, but overall, was prescribed more in polyarticular cases (P = 0. 001). Just under one-third of oligoarticular and polyarticular JIA patients exhibited a moderate or severe class II skeletal pattern. It is, therefore, likely that any future clinical trial to investigate the effect of functional appliance treatment in JIA patients, will need multicentre co-operation to fulfil potential sample size requirements. Clinical signs and symptoms of temporomandibular joint pain dysfunction syndrome were low except for crepitus and click. However, radiographic evidence of condylar erosion was high particularly in the polyarticular group.

40|$|At present only few {{biological}} {{data are}} available to indicate whether psoriatic arthritis (PsA) {{is part of the}} spondyloarthropathy (SpA) concept, whether it is a separate disease entity or a heterogeneous disease group with oligoarticular/ axial forms belonging to SpA and <b>polyarticular</b> <b>forms</b> resembling rheumatoid arthritis (RA). To address this issue with regard to peripheral synovitis, we compared the synovial characteristics of PsA with those of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) /undifferentiated SpA (USpA) and RA, and compared the synovium of oligoarticular versus polyarticular PsA. Synovial biopsies were obtained from patients with RA, nonpsoriatic SpA (AS + USpA), and oligoarticular and polyarticular PsA. The histological analysis included examination(s) of the lining layer thickness, vascularity, cellular infiltration, lymphoid aggregates, plasma cells and neutrophils. Also, we performed immunohistochemical assessments of CD 3, CD 4, CD 8, CD 20, CD 38, CD 138, CD 68, CD 163, CD 83, CD 1 a, CD 146, alpha(V) beta(3), E-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule- 1, vascular cell adhesion molecule- 1, S 100 A 12, intracellular citrullinated proteins and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) -human cartilage (HC) gp 39 peptide complexes. Comparing SpA (PsA + AS + USpA) with RA, vascularity, and neutrophil and CD 163 + macrophage counts were greater in SpA (P < 0. 05), whereas lining layer thickness and the number of CD 83 + dendritic cells were greater in RA (P < 0. 05). In RA, 44 % of samples exhibited positive staining for intracellular citrullinated proteins and 46 % for MHC-HC gp 39 peptide complexes, whereas no staining for these markers was observed in SpA samples. We excluded influences of disease-modifying antirheumatic drug and/or corticosteroid treatment by conducting systematic analyses of treated and untreated subgroups. Focusing on PsA, no significant differences were observed between PsA and nonpsoriatic SpA. In contrast, vascularity (P < 0. 001) and neutrophils were increased in PsA as compared with RA (P = 0. 010), whereas staining for intracellular citrullinated proteins and MHC-HC gp 39 peptide complexes was exclusively observed in RA (both P = 0. 001), indicating that the same discriminating features are found in PsA and other SpA subtypes compared with RA. Exploring synovial histopathology between oligoarticular and polyarticular PsA, no significant differences were noted. Moreover, intracellular citrullinated proteins and MHC-HC gp 39 peptide complexes, which are specific markers for RA, were observed in neither oligoarticular nor polyarticular PsA. Taken together, these data indicate that the synovial histopathology of PsA, either oligoarticular or polyarticular, resembles that of other SpA subtypes, whereas both groups can be differentiated from RA {{on the basis of these}} same synovial features, suggesting that peripheral synovitis in PsA belongs to the SpA concept...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Rheumatic manifestations, in {{particular}} joint complaints, are frequent features in {{inflammatory bowel disease}} (IBD), with a prevalence varying from 10 to 35 %. Their spectrum is almost wide, involving bone, tendons, entheses and joints. Joint manifestations {{may be seen as}} arthralgia and/or inflammatory arthropathies. These latter may in turn be found in three principal forms: the peripheral, the axial or spondylitis and that overlapping between these two varieties. Peripheral arthritis may be classified in oligoarticular (type I) and <b>polyarticular</b> (type II) <b>forms.</b> Oligoarthritis is the most frequent. Usually asymmetric, involving large joints of lower limbs, it is transient, commonly associated with IBD flares, and may disappear after few weeks, although in 10 % of cases it may evolves to chronic arthritis. Type II arthritis is polyarticular and symmetric, involving hands and feet but also large joints. The prevalence is about 2 - 4 % of IBD patients, its course is independent from IBD flares and usually evolves in chronic disease. Peripheral arthritis is classically nondeforming, non erosive, and seronegative for the rheumatoid factor. Axial involvement is equally frequent in both CD and UC and varies in different studies from 10 to 30 % for sacroiliitis and from 3 to 10 % for ankylosing spondylitis. Its course is independent from IBD state, the extension of IBD involvement and the occurrence of flares. The treatment of rheumatic manifestations in IBD is frequently problematic, due to the possibility of frequent side effects. Among drugs used for IBD, corticosteroids, also effective in joint complaints, may have osteopenic effects; sulfasalazine, sometimes able to control peripheral arthritis, is ineffective for the axial involvement. A potential gut toxicity is associated with the use o...|$|R
