500|$|The 3rd Parachute Brigade dropped {{nine minutes}} later than planned, but {{otherwise}} landed accurately on drop zone 'A'. Hill landed {{near to the}} Diersfordterwald forest, which was occupied by German soldiers [...] "who are switched-on people," [...] killing a number of paratroopers whose parachutes became tangled up in the trees. His brigade headquarters was positioned by a copse {{which was supposed to}} have been immediately cleared, but when he arrived it was still occupied by German troops; Hill immediately ordered a company commander of the 8th Parachute Battalion to clear the copse. The officer did so, but was killed in the process. Hill then moved his headquarters to the copse, but was then nearly killed by an approaching glider which barely managed to <b>pull</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> time, landing in the trees above him; upon investigation, Hill discovered that it contained his batman and personal Jeep, which took some time to lower down safely. The brigade suffered a number of casualties as it engaged the German forces in the Diersfordter Wald, but by 11:00hours the drop zone was all but completely clear of enemy forces and all battalions of the brigade had formed up. The key town of Schnappenberg was captured by the 9th Parachute Battalion in conjunction with the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion, the latter unit having lost its commanding officer to German small-arms fire only moments after he had landed. Despite taking casualties the brigade cleared the area of German forces, and by 13:45 Hill could report that the brigade had secured all of its objectives.|$|E
500|$|Joe Nick Patoski, {{an author}} and {{contributor}} to The New York Times, said that [...] "La Carcacha" [...] is [...] "an optimum piece of modern music", noting that the recording makes use of call-and-response and includes chants, shouts, whistles, [...] "searing guitar fills", and the singer's [...] "mesmerizing snake-charmer vocals". The lyrical content of the song describes the singer waiting at a street corner for her lover to <b>pull</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> his jalopy. Patoski found that the storyline seemed to relate to a life that the singer never had, a [...] "tale of barrio teen romance". Guerra summed up the lyrics as a song [...] "about a boyfriend's beat-up old car". American musicologist Ilan Stavans wrote in Encyclopedia Latina that the song is a [...] "vivid poetic portrait of barrio life." [...] Ramiro Burr said that Selena [...] Burr, who [...] said that the band was inspired by cumbia singer Fito Olivares when they recorded [...] "La Carcacha", and called the song a [...] "marvelous" [...] and [...] "danceable cumbia" [...] track. Pérez was asked to perform [...] "Las Cadenas" [...] in a rock style by A.B., who later changed his mind, deciding that the song {{should be in a}} conjunto (small band) style instead. Pérez was nonetheless overjoyed to record the song, due of the conjunto nature of the track, which brought back memories of his childhood. Pérez added that Selena's vocals would greatly compliment the song, a conjunto song about a jubilant protagonist who regains control of her life after feeling trapped in a relationship. The song made use of the squeezebox, and according to Mario Tarradell of the Dallas Morning News, was [...] "well-crafted, catchy and proficiently played".|$|E
