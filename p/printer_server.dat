5000|$|Printer Spooling - Later {{versions}} of the Econet <b>printer</b> <b>server</b> software used printer spooling to locally cache print jobs before sending to the remote printer. This ensured whole print jobs {{were sent to the}} printer in one go.|$|E
50|$|A print server, or <b>printer</b> <b>server,</b> is {{a device}} that connects {{printers}} to client computers over a network. It accepts print jobs from the computers and sends the jobs to the appropriate printers, queuing the jobs locally to accommodate the fact that work may arrive more quickly than the printer can actually handle. Ancillary functions include the ability to inspect the queue of jobs to be processed, the ability to reorder or delete waiting print jobs, {{or the ability to}} do various kinds of accounting (such as counting pages, which may involve reading data generated by the printer(s)).|$|E
5000|$|At {{the time}} and in the markets for which Econet was developed, {{the main purpose of}} {{computer}} networking was to provide local area shared access to expensive hardware such disc storage and printers. Acorn provided software for the BBC Micro to implement a file server, and optionally a <b>printer</b> <b>server</b> also. The original file server was very basic, essentially allowing limited access to a floppy disc over the network. The server software was further developed over many years, and Acorn and other manufacturers also produced dedicated Econet servers based on various technologies. So the servers available fell into roughly three categories: ...|$|E
5000|$|Broadcasting - By using host 255, an Econet host {{could send}} {{broadcast}} packets to all hosts {{on the network}} segment. Later implementations of the client software used this to automatically locate file and <b>printer</b> <b>servers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Print {{services}} provide centralized {{background printing}} on terminal printers, line <b>printers,</b> or Terminal <b>Server</b> <b>printers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Ports - Because {{the various}} {{protocols}} (file and <b>printer</b> <b>servers,</b> bridge discovery, and so forth) used defined port numbers, {{it was possible}} to for additional services such as BroadcastLoader, AppFS, a teletext server, and a range of chat programs and multiplayer games to coexist within the Econet system.|$|R
50|$|Interestingly Mach did {{not have}} a naming service of any sort for its ports. This proved to be a serious problem, because {{programs}} had to know in advance what servers they had to call in order to ask the kernel to provide a port. This meant that replacing functionality was much more difficult than it should have been; a new <b>printer</b> <b>server</b> needed to sit on the same ports as the old one for instance: there would be no way to run two side by side for development. If ports were instead referred to by name, servers could sit on different ports and simply use the same name. This functionality, provided by a name server, was considered highly important under Spring.|$|E
5000|$|Spring's {{approach}} essentially inverted the Plan 9 system: under Spring {{the file}} system was {{one example of}} a server which used the single unified name service. The same service could be used to name files on disk, environment variables, hardware devices, programs and even objects inside programs. The system was hierarchical, only the [...] namespace was directly supported, by a server which started at boot time. Other servers would then [...] "bind" [...] the names they knew into the system, the <b>printer</b> <b>server</b> would produce a list of printers, the file system would bind in the directories of attached disks. In this way a mapping of all the objects on the system was built up, potentially at runtime, and could be accessed in a file-like fashion very similar to Plan 9. All of these could be accessed using a single API, although the system also provided a variety of stub libraries to make it appear as classical services as well, notably in the Unix emulation server.|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} in unlimited. This thesis describes the detailed {{design and implementation}} of a <b>printer</b> <b>server</b> in the laboratory environment of sharing resources among multiple Zenith Z- 100 microcomputers. The <b>Printer</b> <b>Server</b> System is a controller box which consists of a power supply, a single board computer, and the BLC 8538 eight channel I/O expansion boards. Each Z- 100 microcomputer {{is connected to the}} controller thru the RS- 232 C port. The <b>Printer</b> <b>Server</b> System has three software utilities: BOOT, CONTROL and SPOOL. The BOOT process, resident in the controller, downloads the CONTROL file from any one of multiple Z- 100 *s which is turned on. The CONTROL process allows the printer to be used by any one of multiple Z-lOO's at a time. The SPOOL process sends the data thru the CONTROL process to the printer or saves the data on the disk file. [URL] Korea Arm...|$|E
50|$|In May 2010, the {{government}} of the Philippines planned to carry out its first ever entirely electronically tabulated election, using and optical scan voting system. The government invested $160 million into the new system. This included the electronic voting machines, <b>printers,</b> <b>servers,</b> power generators, memory cards, batteries, and broadband and satellite transmission equipment. This national implementation of electronic voting was intended to increase the accuracy and speed of vote tallying. In addition, it was expected to decrease the fraud and corruption found in past Philippine elections.|$|R
40|$|A {{local area}} network (LAN) is a {{high-speed}} data network over a small physical area (i. e. an office, a building, or a campus).

50|$|The Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) is an Internet {{protocol}} for communication between computers and <b>printers</b> (or print <b>server).</b> It allows programs to send {{one or more}} print jobs to the <b>printer</b> or print <b>server</b> and perform administration such as querying {{the status of a}} printer, obtaining the status of print jobs, or cancelling individual print jobs.|$|R
40|$|Sharing {{resources}} {{on a computer}} network, especially in heterogeneous environments, has m any benefits: new applications become possible, and use of technology cheaper. This dissertation investigates how resources— in particular printing resources—may b e shared. While still incomplete, an existing theoretical framework for data communication and resource sharing, the ISO- 051 Reference Model, provides useful background information and tools for analysis. A discussion o f this framework complements a survey o f the principles and current state of file and printer servers, and distributed systems. An analysis of the design and implementation of a <b>printer</b> <b>server</b> acting as a b ridge between two networks illustrates problem s and results found in distributed system s generally. The dissertation concludes by analyzing the strengths and shortcomings of the Reference Model and distributed systems. This and developments in technology lead to a proposal of an extended model for printer services, and clarification of printer servers' needs and requirements...|$|E
40|$|During several years, the CERN PRINT service {{consisted}} {{of a wide variety}} of printing server platforms handling more than 1300 network printers. Whereas a single UNIX <b>printer</b> <b>server</b> mainly served the 5000 UNIX clients, printing services for the 3500 Windows 9 x and 1500 Windows NT PCs went mostly through Novell and NT servers. At the end of 1997, the CERN Printing Project was launched to define a single server model for all clients. Linux PCs running the RFC 1179 (lpd daemon) protocol were adopted as a common solution as queue servers for all CERN network printers. A CERN Printing Package has been designed to integrate the PC-Windows based printing clients into this lpr based environment. This software package is built around a central database, holding the configuration data (printer name, driver, settings, [...] .) of all corporate network printers. This paper will give an overview of the new architecture including the Linux server environment, the UNIX clients and the CERN Printing. Additionally Java and Perl print clients have been developed in order to provide a GUI for Unix systems and to support other operating systems such as VMS...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, the {{architecture}} of an application-level Internet-fax gateway to facilitate multimedia messaging and to extend Internet services to the home or office is presented. We propose {{the use of the}} latest developments in the facsimile and Internet worlds, notably BFT support for Group 3 protocols and MIME, for the exchange of multimedia messages (documents) between both environments as well as providing Internet e-mail, file transfer and Internet news services to fax users. Such services would be of most benefit to Internet novices and those users who {{do not have access to}} Internet via dialup/SLIP or Freenet facilities. The gateway services would allow a smooth transition into the widespread proliferation of multimedia communications. Implementation of such a gateway would make multimedia at home a very practical reality. A remote <b>printer</b> <b>server,</b> whose functionality is a subset of the proposed multimedia fax-Internet gateway was configured and setup at the MCRLab. This server became operational on February 3, 1994 and covers the local calling areas of the Ottawa/Hull region. This exercise gave us better insight into the practical aspects of the Internet Remote Printing Experiment. Further, a demo for inbound multimedia messaging was developed using the Binary File Transfer extensions to CCITT Group 3 facsimile. This prototype serves as a proof of concept for the proposed gateway services...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Wireless Local Area Networks are {{important}} and necessary in university campuses and large enterprise areas. Such networks allow us to have data connection anywhere without wires and many other benefits such as to obtain {{the location of the}} users. Moreover, they can be used to track the users. Tracking the user’s mobility we can know which places are most visited, if people have to go to places that are far from their office, detect the best location for emergency points, etc. Moreover, we can study the mobility pattern of several users. According to this pattern, the network can use reconfiguration systems to reallocate resources and improve its connectivity. This paper shows us the case study of a university campus of two square kilometers and how we have taken advantage of the information gathered from the wireless network. Two studies (macro and micro mobility) have been done in order to make this survey. This approach can be used by the enterprises to optimize the sites to place their resources (network <b>printers,</b> <b>servers,</b> meeting rooms, etc.). Furthermore, the network’s administrators can use these parameters to improve the network’s behavior by providing a better connection, better roaming, etc...|$|R
