40|$|A twin {{caliper brake}} system is {{investigated}} using {{the whole body}} visual technique of holographic interferometry. It is shown that the disc mode of vibration has a preferred position where a disc antinode is situated under one caliper and a disc node under the second caliper. The maximum angular space occupied by the pad antinode is, as predicted by the theoretical study of the disc/pad interface geometry, the angle subtended by the pad length. For a four- piston opposed caliper the minimum distance is slightly larger than the piston centers. There {{is evidence that the}} disc mode position, in relation to the two calipers, may be antinode/node, node/node or antinode/antinode. With these arrangements an accompanying revised theoretical study of the disc/pad interface geometry predicts two stable conditions are possible - if the calipers are positioned either at an angle between 125 to 130 or 165 to 175. The smaller angle was not tested but the brake became quiet at angles greater than 166. A brief study of the caliper modes and <b>pad</b> <b>spring</b> retainer is included in the holographic results...|$|E

50|$|Upholstery is {{the work}} of {{providing}} furniture, especially seats, with <b>padding,</b> <b>springs,</b> webbing, and fabric or leather covers. The word upholstery comes from the Middle English word upholder, which referred to a tradesman who held up his goods. The term is equally applicable to , automobile, airplane and boat furniture, and can be applied to mattresses, particularly the upper layers, though these often differ significantly in design. A person who works with upholstery is called an upholsterer; an apprentice upholsterer is sometimes called an outsider or trimmer. Traditional upholstery uses materials like coil springs (post-1850), animal hair (horse, hog and cow), coir, straw and hay, hessians, linen scrims, wadding, etc., and is done by hand, building each layer up. In contrast, modern upholsterers employ synthetic materials like dacron and vinyl, serpentine springs, and so on.|$|R

40|$|A {{mechanical}} {{model has}} been developed to reproduce the dynamics of a disk brake assembly. The final aim is to derive an accurate model for predicting brake squeal {{at an early stage}} of development, when changing the geometry of the brake is still possible. The disk has been modeled analytically as a thin plate, its parameters have been identified by considering a complex FE model able to reproduce accurately the actual disk vibration modes. The brake caliper assembly (i. e. stationary part of the brake) has been modeled by a lumped parameter model for both the caliper and the pistons and by a simple finite element model representing the two pads. Also the parameters of the stationary part have been identified. Both the disk model and the stationary part model have been assembled together, by connecting them by means of constant stiffness springs. A complex eigenvalue analysis has been completed to investigate the dynamic stability of the system. The noise index, defined as the ratio between real part of eigenvalue and the module of the eigenvalue, has been used to predict the brake squeal phenomenon. Some unstable modes have been identified.

40|$|Create a System-Level design {{representation}} for a “black box ” system {{tailored to}} the functional needs of an Army Transportation Vehicle. A black box design should include both a vehicle data recorder and also a voice and visual recorder so that an incident can be accurately reconstructed from the vehicle’s status and visual recordings. This particular design will allow analysts {{to determine whether the}} cause of the incident was a vehicle error, operating error, or environmental factors. This design is similar to Flight Data Recorder and Cockpit Voice Recorder {{with the addition of a}} similar On-Board Diagnostics (OBD) II design in modern automotive vehicles.

The basic functions of a black box should include continuous audio/visual recording for both the front and rear of the vehicle. This will be part of the voice and visual recorder. Because this design must withstand 3400 g in the event of an incident, a typical disk drive will not suffice.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a novel, general methodology for designing a Passive Assist Device (<b>PAD)</b> (e. g., <b>spring)</b> to augment an actuated system using optimization {{based on a}} known maneuver of the active system. Implementation of the PAD can result in an improvement in system performance with respect to efficiency, reliability, and/or safety. The methodology is experimentally demonstrated with a parallel, torsional spring designed to minimize energy consumption of a prototypical, single link UGV robot arm. The method is extended to series systems as well as dual PAD systems that contain both a series and a parallel component. We show that the proposed method {{is not limited to}} robot manipulator joints, can be applied to multi-DOF systems, and can be used to design PADs that are robust against variation in the maneuver. Furthermore, for certain situations a significant increase in performance can be realized if the maneuver is redesigned considering that a PAD will be added to the system. The addition of properly designed energy minimizing springs can lead to a decrease in energy consumption, as shown in various engineering examples, by as much as 60 - 80 % while also improving reliability and/or safety...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIt is {{well-known}} that {{the occurrence of}} squeal depends on numerous phenomena still relatively unknown. Furthermore, squeal is affected by several factors on both the micro and macro scales. The present paper proposes some potential interactions between stiffness heterogeneities of the contact surface {{and the potential for}} triggering the squeal. Consequently, an analytical model has also been developed to highlight the impact of certain parameters on the squeal phenomenon. The contact surface has been modeled by connecting the disc with the <b>pad</b> via distributed <b>springs</b> (contact stiffness). From this model, a static equilibrium and a complex modal analysis were performed to determine respectively the pressure distribution and the natural frequencies of the system. In this configuration, the results demonstrate that the introduction of heterogeneities could change the dynamic behavior of the system. Moreover, the influence {{of the size of the}} heterogeneities was studied and results show that this parameter had an influence on the likelihood of squeal occurrence. The paper also points out a heterogeneities correlation length that is reasonable to consider for this special configuration. Such information is relevant when interpreting the occurrence of noise as a function to the sizes of the components of the brake pad and the morphology of the surfaces in contact...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} sound and {{vibration}} are closely related. Sound or "pressure waves" are generated by vibrating structures (e. g. vocal cords); these pressure waves can also induce the vibration of structures (e. g. ear drum). Hence, when trying to reduce noise it is often a problem in trying to reduce vibration. The high speed engines and machines when mounted on foundations and supports cause vibrations of excessive amplitude because of unbalance forces setup during their working. These are the disturbing forces which damage the foundation on which the machines are mounted. So the vibration transmitted to the foundation should be eliminated or reduced considerably by using some devices such as springs, dampers etc. between the foundation and machine. "Passive vibration isolation" refers to vibration isolation or mitigation of vibrations by passive techniques such as rubber <b>pads</b> or mechanical <b>springs,</b> as opposed to "active vibration isolation" or "electronic force cancellation" employing electric power, sensors, actuators, and control systems. Passive vibration isolation is a vast subject, since there are many types of passive vibration isolators used for many different applications. [1 - 6]. The proposed isolator {{is divided into three}} portions. The upper portion is a table on which the isolated objects are placed. The upper portion consists of one horizontal top plate and two vertical hexagonal plates. The middle portion consists of two shafts connected by elements to provide a nonlinear restoring force. Constant force springs, coil springs and wires are examples of such elements. Here constant force springs are composed of rolled spring steel and have constant restoring force regardless of their stretch. At both ends of each shaft, inner and outer roller bearings are installed. In the lower portion one screw connected by two beams. The beams are connected to the cranks using pin connections. Half of the length of the screw jack is threaded by the opposite direction to that of the outer half. With such a composition the horizontal restoring force provides by the middle portion can be converted into the vertical restoring force. In conversion, the vertical resisting force can be adjusted simply by changing the angle of the inclined bars of the cranks which is the key ingredient of the present vibration isolator. All the 3 different portions are designed using CATIA V 5 and assembled together [1]...|$|R
40|$|The OSIRIS-REx {{asteroid}} sample return mission launched to asteroid Bennu Sept. 8, 2016. The spacecraft {{will arrive}} at Bennu in late 2019, orbit and map the asteroid, and perform a {{touch and go}} (TAG) sampling maneuver in July 2020. After sample is stowed and confirmed the spacecraft will return to Earth, and the sample return capsule (SRC) will land in Utah in September 2023. Samples will be recovered from Utah [2] and then transported and stored in a new sample cleanroom at NASA Johnson Space Center in Houston [3]. The materials curated for the mission are described here. a) Materials Archive and Witness Plate Collection: The SRC and TAGSAM were built between March 2014 and Summer of 2015, and instruments (OTES,OVIRS, OLA, OCAMS, REXIS) were integrated from Summer 2015 until May 2016. A total of 395 items were received for the materials archive at NASA-JSC, with archiving finishing ~ 30 days after launch (with the final archived items being related to launch operations) [4]. The materials fall into several general categories including metals (stainless steel, aluminum, titanium alloys, brass and BeCu alloy), epoxies, paints, polymers, lubricants, non-volatile-residue samples (NVR), sapphire, and various miscellaneous materials. All through the ATLO process (from March 2015 until late August 2016) contamination knowledge witness plates (Si wafer and Al foil) were deployed in the various cleanrooms in Denver and KSC to provide an additional record of particle counts and volatiles that is archived for current and future scientific studies. These plates were deployed in roughly monthly increments with each unit containing 4 Si wafers and 4 Al foils. We archived 128 individual witness plates (64 Si wafers and 64 Al foils); one of each witness plate (Si and Al) was analyzed immediately by the science team after archiving, while the remaining 3 of each are archived indefinitely. Information about each material archived is stored in an extensive database at NASA-JSC, and key summary information for each will be presented in an online catalog. b) Bulk Asteroid sample: The Touch and Go Sampling Mechanism (TAGSAM) head will contain up to 1. 5 kg of asteroid material. Upon return to Earth, the TAGSAM head with the sample canister will be subjected to a nitrogen purge and then opened in a nitrogen cabinet in Houston. Once the TAGSAM head {{is removed from the}} canister, it will be dis-assembled slowly and carefully under nitrogen until the sample can be removed for processing in a dedicated nitrogen glovebox. Bennu surface samples are expected to be sub-cm sized, based on thermal infrared and radar polarization ratio measurements [1]. The upper limit on material collected by the TAGSAM head is ~ 2 cm. Therefore, we will be prepared to handle, subdivide, and characterize materials of a wide grain size (from ~ 10 m to 2 cm), and for both organic (UV fluorescence) and inorganic (SEM, FTIR, optical) properties. Representative portions of the bulk sample will be prepared for JAXA (0. 5 %; see also [5]) and Canadian Space Agency (4 %), with the remaining divided between the science team (75 %). c) Contact Pad samples: The base of the TAGSAM head contains 24 contact pads that are designed to trap the upper surface layer of material and thus offer an opportunity to study asteroid samples that have resided at the very top surface of the regolith. Asteroid material is trapped on the <b>pads</b> in <b>spring</b> steel Velcro hooks, and material will have to be removed from these pads by curation specialists in the lab. d) Hardware: Some canister and SRC hardware items will contain information that will be important to understanding the collected samples, including the canister gas filter, temperature strips, flight witness plates, and the TAGSAM and canister parts that might have adhering dust grains. Some challenges remaining for both bulk sample and contact pad samples include: i) working with intermediate size range (200 to 500 micron) samples - a size range NASA has not previously worked in such detail; ii) techniques for removal of contact pad material from the spring steel hooks, iii) static electrical effects of dust sized particles during sample handling and curation is likely to be significant, and iv) the TAGSAM head and associated canister hardware will undoubtedly be coated with fine adhering dust grains from Bennu. In the case of collection of a large bulk sample mass, the adhering dust grains may be of lower priority. If a small sample mass is returned, the adhering dust may attain a higher priority, so recovery of adhering dust grains is an additional challenge to consider. In the year leading up to sample return we plan a variety of sample handling rehearsals that will enables the curation team to be prepared for many new aspects posed by this sample suite...|$|R
40|$|The {{literature}} on age-grading techniques of adult insects, published since 1968, is reviewed. This {{is followed by}} a study of the phenologies of two dung beetle species: the native Onthophagus granulatus Boheman, and the introduced Onitis alexia Klug, using age-grading techniques together with field and laboratory experiments. At Uriarra, NSW, Ot. granulatus is a univoltine species which emerges in the summer or early autumn. It spends the remainder of the warm season in the maturation-feeding phase, a period which generally coincides with the presence of dung produced from a senescent and dried-off pasture. A proportion of beetles may begin breeding before the onset of cold weather, but the progeny do not survive the winter. The species over-winters underground in the adult stage, and reappears in the dung <b>pads</b> in the <b>spring,</b> when dung is generally produced from actively growing pastures. Oviposition occurs in the spring and early summer, and the adults die about the time of the emergence of the new generation. Periodic drought reduces the population by causing follicle resorption in the females and larval mortality. This was confirmed in laboratory experiments which showed that dung from hayed-off pasture caused high mortality in teneral adults, reduced fecundity in sexually mature females and caused high mortality in the pre-adult population. Additionally, dry conditions during larval development caused total mortality in the laboratory. At Armidale, NSW, the species has basically the same life cycle except that a small proportion of larvae survive the winter and emerge as adults in the following spring. Newly emerged Oi. alexia at Araluen begin to appear in pads in the late spring, and new emergence continues into the summer. The maturation-feeding phase is short, and oviposition starts within a week or two of emergence. Eggs laid in December/January develop to emerge as adults in late summer and autumn, eggs laid in February and later do not give rise adults until the following season. The species over-winters mainly in the larval stages, though a proportion of adults may survive the winter in some years. The species at Araluen is thus partly univoltine and partly bivoltine. The population was greatly reduced by cold, wet winters. Dung from hayed-off pasture caused some decrease in fecundity, though not as great as occurred in Ot. granulatus, and it also caused some mortality in the larvae. Follicle resorption occurred in response to rainfall. Additionally, older Oi. alexis were more likely to resorb their follicles than were younger beetles, whereas all sexually mature Ot. granulatus were equally likely to resorb. Temperature summation calculations showed that the predicted and observed times of emergence of Ot. granulatus arising from eggs laid in the field under experimental conditions coincided well, and they occurred at times of peaks of new emergence as determined by age-grading. Predicted times of emergence of the 1982 - 83 summer population of Oi. alexis always preceeded the observed emergence time, indicating the presence of a larval diapause. Diapause in the third instar larvae of Oi. alexis was found to be facultative, and occurred in response to cold temperature and dry conditions during larval development, and to short daylength experienced by the parents. As well, progeny of young parents were more likely to enter diapause than were the progeny of older parents. Ot. granulatus is dependent on summer rainfall, and is unable to survive and breed well in dung produced from hayed off pastures. Temperatures above 30 °C are lethal to the species. Its distribution is therefore very limited. Oi. alexia, in contrast, can survive dry summers and cold, dry winters (down to about 0 °C) by entering diapause, and can breed in dung produced from dry pastures, though the survival of larvae is reduced. Its distribution appears to be limited only by cold wet winters. It has therefore spread from hot summer rainfall areas through regions of even rainfall and into temperate winter rainfall climates...|$|R

The {{origin of}} the railway systems is {{considerably}} old. In very old times, {{it is known that}} people were carrying heavy freights by the similar way in concept to railway transportation. From history to present day, there have been significant improvements in the rail system. With the industrial revolution and the appearance of motor vehicles together with the rapid population growth, the need of railway transportation gradually increased and that demands resulted in modern railway establishment. Today, maglev trains have been exceeded 500 km/h speed but this type of railway transportation is not in public use yet. Only one line of maglev train in China known in service carrying passengers with high-speed (maximum velocity is 430 km/h).   On the other hand, conventional rapid trains recently have reached over 300 km/h velocity. These rapid trains nowadays have significant share of transportation in the world. Thanks to all these developments, the railway transportation has been taking more important place in human life. To fulfill the increased demands, many types of railway systems have been implementing and more passengers have been benefiting from railway transportation day by day. Therefore, to provide a secure and comfortable transportation system concurrently with favorable cost, railway track design becomes more prominent. In this study, 2 nd chapter explains conventional railway and the layers of the railway track by giving technical properties. The layers that form the track superstructure are the formation, sub-ballast, ballast, geotextile, frost protection layer. Since the topic of this study is a ballastless track design, sub-ballast and ballast layers are not explained here. Add to this, brief information about sub-base soil condition is given. Besides, according to UIC Code, formation layer thickness has been shown by table depending on the different types of soil quality class.   Types of slab track systems used worldwide and their cross-section properties are also briefly shown together with figures of cross section properties. Some of these balastless tracks have been examined more detailed and their advantages are introduced in general. Lots of different balasstless track systems have been classified in a table and the advantages of ballastless track systems are given in general. In the 3 rd chapter, the components of the cast in-situ slab track system which are rail, fasteners, sleepers and concrete plate or plinth beams are examined and the components of these in worldwide use are classified and introduced. Rail types are described as flange rail, double headed rail and Vignol rail. Technical properties of the rail types briefly given and the specification, features that they should have and information about pros and cons of these elements explained. Rail fasteners systems are described as two types, rigid system fasteners and elastic system fasteners. The features of these types of fasteners are shown together with figures. After that sleepers defined under the titles of wooden, steel, concrete and plastic sleepers. Some types of the sleepers that tried and currently being used in the world explained. In concrete sleeper title, post-stressed and pre-stressed concrete sleepers have been described. In this chapter we also give some information about plinth concrete beam and explain the measures must be taken during its construction stage briefly. In the 4 th chapter, a type of slab track systems LVT has been chosen and explained in more detail. Here we also mentioned about ground born noise and vibration mitigation which has an inspiration to choosing LVT slab track. Some measures that should be taken for special buildings such as hospital and theater are given. Besides this, LVT systems features and advantages are explained. In 5 th chapter, design of railway superstructure with an example of LVT system has been explained. At first, we explain how the wheel loads are transferred from top (rail) to sub-base showing modeling of railway superstructure in figure. Slab track modeling has springs between the layers that form the superstructure. From bottom to top, first springs take place under the rigid concrete slab which represents the soil elasticity. Since we examined LVT system here, second spring is between rigid slab and LVT concrete block so called block pad as explained in chapter 4 and the third spring for modeling takes place under the rail representing rail pad stiffness. This type of modeling can also be seen in figure.   In chapter 5 we also introduce the forces which effect railway superstructure. Forces studied under the titles of vertical forces, horizontal forces, temperature stresses and other forces and technical information about these forces are given. Vertical forces investigated under two titles, static and dynamic vertical forces. As for the horizontal forces, they are shown under two titles either as the forces acting parallel to longitudinally direction of railway superstructure and forces acting perpendicular direction to the railway. In temperature stresses section, the calculation of forces emanating from temperature has been given by equation depending on unit length change and temperature change. Railway roadway design is performed assuming that railway is a beam laid on elastic platform, and therefore, determination of soil type and coefficient of soil stiffness or soil spring value is important. Here in chapter 5, we give information about calculation of coefficient of soil stiffness in light of Winkler and Zimmermann’s equations. For obtain one soil coefficient of stiffness when multi-layer case is subject, Eisenmann’s equivalent layers theory has been used and introduced by the help of a figure and the calculation of this method has been explained. Another coefficient used for superstructure static analyses is dynamic impact factor. Today many types of calculation method developed for taking into consideration of the impact of dynamic forces acting on railway. In this study we used Eisenmann’s equations for the speed until 200 km/h.   5 th chapter also explain the analyses and concrete slab design calculation for LVT system under different vehicle loads. The loads chosen here have been taken from UIC and EN 1991 standards. For freight train maximum speed taken as 100 km/h. As for the passenger train and high-speed train maximum speed taken as 120 km/h and 250 km/h respectively. Load Model 71 from UIC is used for freight train. For passenger and high speed train, type- 2 and type- 3 load model from EN 1991 has been used. It should be kept in mind that there is much more different type of load models depending on vehicle style. For analysis, FEA base computer program SAP 2000 has been preferred. This program allows engineers to model almost every type of structure realistically. To model LVT system in the program, modeling technique of which illustration is given by figure in chapter 5 has been used. Rail pad which take place under the rails at joints and rubber boot and LVT block <b>pad</b> represented by <b>springs.</b> Here LVT concrete block pad and the rubber boot which contains the block thought together and their stiffness combined calculating an equivalent spring coefficient.   Soil condition considered as good and class of the subbase soil taken as QS 3 according to soil classification of UIC Code. In the model soil represented with springs either. Slab area that considered here a bearing beam laid on elastic platform divided into small finite elements for analysis. The analysis results are shown in figures as contours diagram and concrete design has been performed using the longitudinally and transverse moment values. There might be lots of soil types and geometrical properties on the route of railway track. Thus, quite a lot different conditions may be needed to take into account. In this study the chosen part is regarded as an alignment and calculation is performed accordingly. In final section we explained our assessments and thoughts about the results of the study.
