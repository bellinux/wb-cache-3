40|$|Eclipta Alba (L.) {{is small}} {{branched}} annual herbaceous plant {{with a long}} history of traditional medicines uses in many countries especially in tropical and subtropical regions. The herb has been known for its curative properties and has been utilized as antimytotoxic, analgesic, antibacterial, antihepatotoxic, antihaemorrhagic, antihyperglycemic, antioxidant, immunomodulatory properties and it is considered as a good rejuvenator too. Recent studies showed an antivenom property & corrosion <b>pickling</b> <b>inhibitor</b> action on mild steelin hydrochloric acid. A wide range of chemical compounds including coumestans, alkaloids, thiopenes,flavonoids, polyacetylenes, triterpenes and their glycosides have been isolated from this species. Extracts and metabolites from this plant have been known to possess pharmacological properties. This contribution provides an comprehensive review on ethnomedicinal uses, chemical composition, and the pharmacological profile as medicinal plant. Particular attention is given to antihepatotoxic, analgesic, antioxidant, antihyperglycemic, antiaggresive, wound healing properties and insecticidal effects presented in this review such that the potential use of this plant either in pharmaceutics or as an agricultural resource can be evaluated...|$|E

He held twenty-eight patents, the best known being Bakelite (named for its inventor, Leo Baekeland). He also held patents on lacquers, antiknock fuels, <b>pickling</b> <b>inhibitors,</b> and laminated safety glass.|$|R
30|$|The {{displayed}} {{data showed}} that icorr decreases with increasing Crataegus oxyacantha and Prunus Avium leaf extracts concentrations accompanied {{with an increase in}} %P. The slight variations in anodic and cathodic Tafel slopes, βa and βc, in the presence of these extracts indicate that the inhibiting action is taking place the simple blocking of existing cathodic and anodic sites on the metal surface [28]. The studied leaf extracts could be classified as <b>pickling</b> type <b>inhibitors</b> since they approximately have no effect on the corrosion potential (Ecorr) [29].|$|R
40|$|International audienceTo {{avoid the}} {{dissolution}} of steel in industrial <b>pickling</b> process, tetramine <b>inhibitors</b> {{are added to the}} pickling bath. This study is devoted {{to the understanding of the}} action mechanism of these inhibitors in hydrochloric and sulphuric baths on non-alloyed and alloyed steels. Pickling experiments and characterization with XPS, Raman and infrared spectroscopies have shown that inhibitors work only in acid media and leached out from the steel surfaces during the rinsing operation just after pickling. The effectiveness of inhibitors depends on the acid media and the temperature. Experimental data are consistent with a surface mechanism, i. e., the so-called "outer-sphere" adsorption...|$|R
