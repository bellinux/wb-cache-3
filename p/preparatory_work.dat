5|$|Despite such unpromisingly reactionary trappings the Schimmelpenninck regime {{actually}} accomplished more in its short existence {{than the}} previous regimes had accomplished in the ten years since 1795. This was, of course, mainly due to the diligent <b>preparatory</b> <b>work</b> that Agents like the ubiquitous Gogel; Johannes Goldberg, for National Economy; and Johannes van der Palm, for National Education; had done.|$|E

50|$|The DMRC {{felt that}} it was {{necessary}} to undertake <b>preparatory</b> <b>works</b> to avoid disruptions to commuters during the construction of the Kochi Metro. The agency suggested five <b>preparatory</b> <b>works</b> to the State government, which approved all five projects in March 2010. The <b>preparatory</b> <b>works</b> were intended to be completed before constructing the metro. The works included the widening of 3 arterial roads and {{the construction of a new}} rail overbridge (RoB) near KSRTC station and a foot overbridge. The A.L. Jacob RoB near the KSRTC stand, commissioned on 12 May 2013, was the first of the five works to be completed. Apart from the five originally proposed projects, some additional projects such as the construction of the Ernakulan North RoB, and the flyover at Edapally were also carried out.|$|R
5|$|By mid-1917, Haig was {{planning}} an offensive in the heavily defended Ypres region of Flanders. His plan involved {{a series of}} steps, {{the first of which}} was the capture of Messines Ridge by II ANZAC Corps. The New Zealand Division, already in the Messines sector, was given the task of capturing Messines Village and it began intensive training for the forthcoming battle under the close supervision of Russell. Extensive <b>preparatory</b> <b>work</b> was carried out, with transportation infrastructure laid down and ample supplies of shells brought forward for the artillery.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{transfer}} of Eurostar services from Waterloo, the former Eurostar platforms 20–24 of Waterloo International have remained unused. Waterloo suffers significant capacity problems, and proposals {{have been put in}} place to convert the former international station to domestic use. In December 2008 <b>preparatory</b> <b>work</b> was carried out to enable platform 20 to be used by South West Trains suburban services. However, the conversion of the remaining platforms was delayed as it would require alterations to the track layout outside the station.|$|E
5|$|Some <b>preparatory</b> <b>work</b> for the {{renovation}} began in November 1995. On May 3, 1996, City Hall closed and offices relocated for {{the renovation}} project.

5|$|Although some <b>preparatory</b> <b>work</b> {{was carried}} out, the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War in 1939 brought the electrification north of Rickmansworth to a halt. First class travel was abandoned by the LPTB, along with the Pullman cars, and the line was operated entirely as a shuttle service. In 1940 the Chesham branch was converted to autotrain working, in which the trains could be driven from each end, thus avoiding the time-consuming repositioning of the locomotive. LNER C13 Class locomotives were used for this push-pull working, along with two three-car sets of antiquated Ashbury passenger cars dating from 1898.|$|E
5|$|Development {{began in}} July 2006 after work was {{completed}} on Titan Quest, with <b>preparatory</b> <b>work</b> beginning prior to this. Staff members returned while assuming different roles {{to the original}} game: Michael Verrette produced, Michael Sheidow acted as art director, the script was written by Dean O'Donnell, while Arthur Bruno took over as main designer. Scott Morton returned to compose new tracks. The concept was to both expand upon the narrative of Titan Quest and improve the gameplay experience. It also went for a darker aesthetic compared to the original. Announced in November 2006, it released to a positive critical reception and favorable sales.|$|E
5|$|No {{work was}} done to the ship over the {{following}} two years. On 18 January 1904, Ottoman negotiators began {{a new round of}} talks with Krupp, demanding a reduction in the cost of the modernization from 282,000lira to 65,000lira; this amount does not cover the <b>preparatory</b> <b>work</b> that had been initially carried out, let alone the reconstruction. In return, the Ottoman government would order a pair of torpedo cruisers—the —from Germaniawerft. With the armament contract still under negotiation, Krupp was forced to concede, despite the significant financial loss the reconstruction deal represented. By April, the armament contract was signed, and so work began slowly on Asar-i Tevfik. Work was completed by late 1906. The reconstructed ship departed Kiel on 19 November, and arrived in Constantinople on 4 January 1907.|$|E

5|$|Santoso, the {{daughter}} of a politician, became interested in women's rights after seeing numerous injustices in her youth. Despite pressure to become a doctor, she graduated with a degree in law from Leiden University in 1933; while in the Netherlands she also became involved in the Indonesian nationalist movement, Upon returning to the Dutch East Indies, Santoso began teaching and working towards marriage reform. She {{was a member of the}} Committee for <b>Preparatory</b> <b>Work</b> for Indonesian Independence, and later became the social minister from 12 March 1946 to 26 June 1947. After her term, she continued to work with the government in various capacities.|$|E
5|$|While {{preparing}} for his southern journey, Shackleton gave instructions to Edgeworth David {{to lead a}} Northern party to Victoria Land to carry out magnetic and geological work. The party {{was to try to}} reach the Magnetic Pole, and was to carry out a full geological survey in the Dry Valley area. David's party consisted of himself, Douglas Mawson and Alistair Mackay. It would be a man-hauling party; the dogs remained at base to be used for depot-laying and other routine work. The party had orders to plant the Union Jack at the Magnetic Pole and to take possession of Victoria Land for the British Empire. After several days' <b>preparatory</b> <b>work,</b> they started out on 5 October 1908, drawn for the first few miles by the motor car.|$|E
5|$|After the Japanese {{occupied}} Indonesia in 1942, Santoso {{left her}} work as a teacher and found employment as legal assistant to Soepomo, who later became the country's first minister of justice. In 1945, with the Japanese preparing to withdraw from the Indies and the proclamation of independence looming, Santoso {{became a member of the}} Committee for <b>Preparatory</b> <b>Work</b> for Indonesian Independence. On 12 March 1946, Santoso became the first ever female cabinet member when she was selected as services minister in the Second Sjahrir Cabinet. Working quickly and efficiently, she found herself organising the return of internees from Japanese-run camps. She was kept on through the Third Sjahrir Cabinet, but when it dissolved on 26 June 1947, Santoso refused another term as social minister. She instead chose to work as head of prime minister Amir Sjarifuddin's secretariat. She kept this position into the First Hatta Cabinet. During Operation Kraai, a Dutch-led offensive on the city of Yogyakarta on 19 December 1948, her husband was killed outside Maguwo.|$|E

5|$|In February 1921 {{he met the}} 21-year-old {{photographer}} Charlotte ("Yolla") Niclas; {{the close}} romantic {{relationship between the two}} was to last many years, despite their age difference. The same year, following a family vacation to the Baltic coast, he began <b>preparatory</b> <b>work</b> on his science fiction novel Berge Meere und Giganten (Mountains Seas and Giants), which would be published in 1924. In 1920 Döblin joined the Association of German Writers (Schutzverband Deutscher Schriftsteller), and in 1924 he became its president. In November 1921 he began reviewing plays for the Prager Tagblatt, and in 1925 joined the Gruppe 1925, a discussion circle of progressive and communist intellectuals including Bertolt Brecht, Johannes R. Becher, Ernst Bloch, Hermann Kasack, Rudolf Leonhard, Walter Mehring, Robert Musil, Joseph Roth, Ernst Toller, Kurt Tucholsky, and Ernst Weiß, among others. It was likely Brecht, who counted Döblin among his significant influences, who introduced him to Erwin Piscator in 1928.|$|E
5|$|Since 1954, a {{year ahead}} of the 1955 general election, an Electoral Boundaries Review Committee (EBRC) has been {{appointed}} to advise the executive on the number and geographical division of electoral divisions. Even though neither the Constitution nor any law requires this to be done, the Prime Minister has continued to do so from Singapore's independence in 1965. This is generally done just before a general election to review the boundaries of electoral divisions and recommend changes. In recent decades, the Committee has been chaired by the Cabinet Secretary and has had four other members who are senior public servants. In the EBRC appointed before the general election of 2006, these were {{the head of the}} Elections Department, the Chief Executive Officer of the Singapore Land Authority, the Deputy CEO of the Housing and Development Board and the Acting Chief Statistician. Since the Committee is only convened shortly before general elections, the <b>preparatory</b> <b>work</b> for boundary delimitation is done by its secretariat the Elections Department, which is a division of the Prime Minister's Office.|$|E
5|$|The {{position}} of Keeper of the Archives at the University of Oxford in England dates from 1634, {{when it was}} established by new statutes for the university brought in by William Laud (Archbishop of Canterbury and Chancellor of the University). The first holder of the post was Brian Twyne, who prepared an index of the archives in 1631 {{as part of the}} <b>preparatory</b> <b>work</b> for the statutes: he was appointed Keeper of the Archives as a reward for his work. The archives were moved from the University Church of St Mary the Virgin into the Tower of the Five Orders in the Bodleian Library under Twyne and his successor, and some of the storage cupboards built at that time are still in use. The archives include charters, title deeds, university registers and records, and other official documentation from the university (but not from the colleges of the university, which keep their own archives). Most of the material dates from the 19th and 20th centuries, with few photographs and no sound or video recordings.|$|E

5|$|Development on Immortal Throne {{began in}} early June 2006, {{a few weeks}} after the {{original}} Titan Quest went gold. <b>Preparatory</b> <b>work</b> was in progress during the late development stages of Titan Quest, with staff drawing up feature lists and choosing what features to improve and what additions to make. According to producer Michael Verrette, Immortal Throne was considered an extension of Titan Quest, as many of the elements it included were features that could not be included in the original game due to time constraints. Multiple staff from Titan Quest returned, either in their original roles or different roles: Verrette became producer after being a sound designer for the original game, Arthur Bruno became lead gameplay designer, and Michael Sheidow and Scott Morton returned as art director and composer respectively. The original graphics engine was carried over from the original game with some accompanying refinements. The level design was based around the increased vertical elements in environments, giving a wider variety of gameplay spaces and vistas. A big addition to the game was the Dream Mastery character class, which was both designed to fit in among the existing character classes and to be a useful skill in cooperative multiplayer. The level editor, a feature present in the original game, was left mostly intact, although additional development features were added such as lockable day and night cycle and preview features for new elements. Visually, the game was themed around a descent into the Underworld: the deeper the player went on their journey, the darker the environments became. Immortal Throne would be the last original property worked on by Iron Lore Entertainment: after completing work on , an expansion to , the studio was forced to close in February 2008 due to difficulties in securing any funding for future projects.|$|E
