5|$|Although modern {{scholars}} know of some surviving {{cases where}} Han law dealt with commerce and domestic affairs, the spheres of trade (outside the monopolies) {{and the family}} were still largely governed by age-old social customs.

His time was spent pre-occupied with the religious tensions of the University, having spent time opposing changes to religious services in Oxford on behalf of Oxford Tories.|$|E
