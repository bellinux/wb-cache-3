40|$|The article defi nes the {{typology}} and {{the chronology}} of the arched rustling <b>pendants</b> with horses, which belong to typical antiquities of the Azelino culture. Earlier, they were studied {{in a number}} of works (by L. A. Golubeva, N. A. Leshchinskaya, D. G. Bugrov), yet they received a much later dating. Formation and development of the arched <b>pendants</b> are illustrated by the materials found on Tyum-Tyum burial ground and published in 2010. While the earlier types of such <b>pendants</b> appear as late as the middle fourth century, the later types exist along the fi rst half of the sixth century. Later, the arched <b>pendants</b> with horses are sporadically found {{on the periphery of the}} Azelino antiquities...|$|R

It is likely that the gold came from melted-down coins of the Merovingian dynasty of Francia. The Frankish currency underwent a similar debasing at around this time. The link with Francia is illustrative of the trading and cultural links that existed between Anglo-Saxon England and continental Europe at the time.|$|E
