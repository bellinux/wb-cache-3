40|$|U. <b>S.</b> <b>strategy</b> toward Southern Caucasus and Central Asia has {{not been}} studied sufficiently. The present study, which takes the {{disintegration}} of the Soviet Union and the subsequent independence of the states of CASC (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia) as its starting point, is probably the most detailed tracing of the evolution of U. <b>S.</b> <b>strategy</b> toward this specific region hitherto available. The study is methodologically committed to process-tracing and covers U. <b>S.</b> <b>strategy</b> toward CASC over a 15 -year period covering three separate presidential administrations. A vast material has been collected and studied, and the primary contribution of the study is empirical. The study also sets out develop a neoclassical realist framework for analysing U. <b>S.</b> <b>strategy,</b> which introduces strategic culture as an intervening variable between the external actions of the U. S and the international environment.  The theory in this study is based on three pillars. The first is structural realism. With its focus on the international environment and the pressure that is exerts, the study accepts the systemic imperative described by structural realists. The second pillar is cultural/constructivist theory. The study presupposes the notion of malleable norms and identities promoted by such theories. The third and most important pillar is neoclassical realism, which aims at finding intervening variables between a state´s external actions and the international environment. The definition of U. S. strategic culture relies heavily on American political and diplomatic history, the main argument being that U. S. policymakers constantly draw on U. S. strategic culture and have strong incentives to frame their policies so as to be culturally acceptable. The strategic culture thus both constrains and enables actions. The framework contributes to the ongoing effort {{to bridge the gap between}} realist and constructivist perspectives. This study will demonstrate that U. <b>S.</b> <b>strategy</b> toward CASC was shaped by specific U. S. strategic culture to a considerable extent. Throughout the entire period studied, the declared goal of the U. S. was the integration of CASC into the community of liberal market democracies. One very important theoretical finding of this study is that U. S. strategic culture had a powerful impact on U. <b>S.</b> <b>strategy,</b> independently of international pressures. This study will also demonstrate that U. <b>S.</b> <b>strategy</b> was incoherent, inconsistent, bureaucratically uncoordinated, susceptible to domestic pressure, and frequently subordinated to more important strategic goals outside of the region. ...|$|R

40|$|With {{the end of}} the Cold War, {{the context}} and {{challenges}} to the security strategies of the United States {{and the role of the}} North Atlantic Treaty Organization changed. Even so, a complete new understanding of post-Cold War strategies did not, and still has not, evolved. Not until the War on Terrorism and Iraq did the security policies of the U. S. again seem focused, and NATO found itself in a new continent with the engagement in Afghanistan. In order to understand the evolution of U. <b>S.</b> <b>strategies</b> and the transformation of the role of NATO within them, and to comprehend the foundation for present security strategies, the research question of this project is: How did U. <b>S.</b> national security <b>strategies</b> evolve from {{the end of the}} Cold War to the War on Terrorism, and how did the role of NATO change within that strategy? The thesis argues that U. <b>S.</b> national security <b>strategies</b> evolved as strategies of engagement. From relying on containment and deterrence to secure U. S. interests during the Cold War, strategies of engagement gradually came to constitute a new type of approach. In an intermediate phase, with a new primary position, and without an existential, monolithic threat, the three post-Cold War presidencies’ strategic deliberations were largely captured by a question of when and how to engage in the now more fragmented international security situation. In line with such U. <b>S.</b> <b>strategies,</b> NATO moved from a territorially defensive organization towards a new role engaging “out of area”. Through the Balkan engagements, NATO obtained such a role within U. <b>S.</b> <b>strategy</b> in Europe, but the alliance stayed separate from U. <b>S.</b> <b>strategy</b> beyond Europe, as part of the fragmented nature of the post-Cold War world. As U. S. strategic outlook coalesced in the War on Terrorism, NATO did attain a more global role through the Afghanistan engagement. But the Cold War structure of alliances was not integral to U. <b>S.</b> <b>strategy</b> in the War on Terrorism, and consequently, NATO’s new role was not as cohesive as that of the Cold War. The project empirically investigates the period 1989 - 2003, based on an extensive set of primary sources, including annual U. <b>S.</b> national security <b>strategy</b> reports and interviews conducted in Washington D. C. and the NATO headquarters. A synthesis of U. <b>S.</b> <b>strategies</b> and their implications for NATO’s role is provided through a four-step systematic analysis, discussing the three successive post-Cold War American presidencies’ approach to U. S. interests and objectives; perception of threats; assessment of strategic areas, allies and partners; as well as strategic thinking and implementation, and within these, NATO’s changing role...|$|R

Context dependency refers to the well-established phenomenon that a player, when choosing from a given opportunity set created by the other player 2 ̆ 019 <b>s</b> <b>strategy,</b> chooses differently in different situations because of different alternatives to the other player 2 ̆ 019 <b>s</b> <b>strategy.</b> The utility model used to explain this kind of context dependency incorporates a preference for net-loss reciprocation.
