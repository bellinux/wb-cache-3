25|$|Acute MI is {{most often}} caused by endocarditis, mainly S. aureus. Rupture or {{dysfunction}} of the <b>papillary</b> <b>muscle</b> are also common causes in acute cases, dysfunction, which can include mitral valve prolapse.|$|E
25|$|Acute MI (as {{may occur}} {{due to the}} sudden rupture of a chorda tendinae or <b>papillary</b> <b>muscle)</b> causes a sudden volume {{overload}} of both the left atrium and the left ventricle. The left ventricle develops volume overload because with every contraction it now has to pump out not only the volume of blood {{that goes into the}} aorta (the forward cardiac output or forward stroke volume) but also the blood that regurgitates into the left atrium (the regurgitant volume). The combination of the forward stroke volume and the regurgitant volume is known as the total stroke volume of the left ventricle.|$|E
50|$|There {{are five}} total <b>papillary</b> <b>muscles</b> in the heart; {{three in the}} right {{ventricle}} and two in the left. The anterior, posterior, and septal <b>papillary</b> <b>muscles</b> of the right ventricle each attach via chordae tendineae to the tricuspid valve. The anterior and posterior <b>papillary</b> <b>muscles</b> of the left ventricle attach via chordae tendineae to the mitral valve.|$|R
40|$|<b>Papillary</b> <b>muscles</b> {{are part}} of the {{myocardium}} and are very important in the proper functioning of the atrioventricular valve. Normal tricuspid valve function depends upon the maintenance of the proper spatial relationship between the <b>papillary</b> <b>muscles,</b> the chordae tendineae and the tricuspid valve leaflets through all phases of the cardiac cycle In recent years various anomalies of the right ventricular <b>papillary</b> <b>muscles</b> have been observed. These include solitary hypertrophy (a...|$|R
25|$|Ischemic {{heart disease}} causes MI by the {{combination}} of ischemic dysfunction of the <b>papillary</b> <b>muscles,</b> and the dilatation of the left ventricle. This {{can lead to the}} subsequent displacement of the <b>papillary</b> <b>muscles</b> and the dilatation of the mitral valve annulus.|$|R
500|$|The right atrium is {{connected}} to the right ventricle by the tricuspid valve. The walls of the right ventricle are lined with trabeculae carneae, ridges of cardiac muscle covered by endocardium. In addition to these muscular ridges, a band of cardiac muscle, also covered by endocardium, known as the moderator band reinforces the thin walls of the right ventricle and plays a crucial role in cardiac conduction. It arises from {{the lower part of the}} interventricular septum and crosses the interior space of the right ventricle to connect with the inferior <b>papillary</b> <b>muscle.</b> The right ventricle tapers into the pulmonary trunk, into which it ejects blood when contracting. The pulmonary trunk [...] branches into the left and right pulmonary arteries that carry the blood to each lung. The pulmonary valve lies between the right heart and the pulmonary trunk.|$|E
2500|$|In acute MI {{secondary}} to a mechanical {{defect in the}} heart (i.e., rupture of a <b>papillary</b> <b>muscle</b> or chordae tendineae), the treatment of choice is mitral valve surgery. [...] If the patient is hypotensive prior to the surgical procedure, an intra-aortic balloon pump may be placed {{in order to improve}} perfusion of the organs and to decrease the degree of MI.|$|E
2500|$|The {{symptoms}} {{associated with}} MI {{are dependent on}} which phase of the disease process the individual is in. [...] Individuals with acute MI are typically severely symptomatic and will have the {{signs and symptoms of}} acute decompensated congestive heart failure (i.e. shortness of breath, pulmonary edema, orthopnea, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea), as well as symptoms of cardiogenic shock (i.e., shortness of breath at rest). Cardiovascular collapse with shock (cardiogenic shock) may be seen in individuals with acute MI due to <b>papillary</b> <b>muscle</b> rupture, rupture of a chorda tendinea or infective endocarditis of the mitral valve.|$|E
500|$|The <b>papillary</b> <b>muscles</b> {{extend from}} {{the walls of the}} heart to valves by {{cartilaginous}} connections called chordae tendinae. These muscles prevent the valves from falling too far back when they close. During the relaxation phase of the cardiac cycle, the <b>papillary</b> <b>muscles</b> are also relaxed and the tension on the chordae tendineae is slight. As the heart chambers contract, so do the <b>papillary</b> <b>muscles.</b> This creates tension on the chordae tendineae, helping to hold the cusps of the atrioventricular valves in place and preventing them from being blown back into the atria.|$|R

2500|$|Emergency {{bypass surgery}} for the {{treatment}} of an acute myocardial infarction (MI) is less common than PCI or thrombolysis. From 1995 to 2004, the percentage of people with cardiogenic shock treated with primary PCI rose from 27.4% to 54.4%, while the increase in coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) was only from 2.1% to 3.2%. [...] Emergency CABG is usually undertaken to simultaneously treat a mechanical complication, such as a ruptured <b>papillary</b> <b>muscle,</b> or a ventricular septal defect, with ensuing cardiogenic shock. In uncomplicated MI, the mortality rate can be high when the surgery is performed immediately following the infarction. If this option is entertained, the patient should be stabilized prior to surgery, with supportive interventions {{such as the use of}} an intra-aortic balloon pump. In patients developing cardiogenic shock after a myocardial infarction, both PCI and CABG are satisfactory treatment options, with similar survival rates.|$|E
2500|$|Surgery is {{curative}} of {{mitral valve}} regurgitation. [...] There are two surgical {{options for the}} treatment of MI: mitral valve replacement and mitral valve repair. Mitral valve repair is preferred to mitral valve replacement where a repair is feasible as bioprosthetic replacement valves have a limited lifespan of 10 to 15 years, whereas synthetic replacement valves require ongoing use of blood thinners {{to reduce the risk of}} stroke. [...] There are two general categories of approaches to mitral valve repair: [...] Resection of the prolapsed valvular segment (sometimes referred to as the 'Carpentier' approach), and installation of artificial chordae to [...] "anchor" [...] the prolapsed segment to the <b>papillary</b> <b>muscle</b> (sometimes referred to as the 'David' approach). [...] With the resection approach, any prolapsing tissue is resected, in effect removing the hole through which the blood is leaking. [...] In the artificial chordae approach, ePTFE (expanded polytetrafluoroethylene, or Gore-Tex) sutures are used to replace the broken or stretched chordae tendonae, bringing the natural tissue back into the physiological position, thus restoring the natural anatomy of the valve. [...] With both techniques, an annuloplasty ring is typically secured to the annulus, or opening of the mitral valve, to provide additional structural support. [...] In some cases, the [...] "double orifice" [...] (or 'Alfieri') technique for mitral valve repair, the opening of the mitral valve is sewn closed in the middle, leaving the two ends still able to open. This ensures that the mitral valve closes when the left ventricle pumps blood, yet allows the mitral valve to open at the two ends to fill [...] the left ventricle with blood before it pumps. [...] In general, mitral valve surgery [...] requires [...] "open-heart" [...] surgery in which the heart is arrested and the patient is placed on a heart-lung machine (cardiopulmonary bypass). [...] This allows the complex surgery to proceed in a still environment.|$|E
5000|$|The anterolateral <b>papillary</b> <b>muscle</b> more {{frequently}} receives two blood supplies: left anterior descending (LAD) artery {{and the left}} circumflex artery (LCX). It is therefore {{more frequently}} resistant to coronary ischemia (insufficiency of oxygen-rich blood). On the other hand, the posteromedial <b>papillary</b> <b>muscle</b> is usually supplied only by the PDA. [...] This makes the posteromedial <b>papillary</b> <b>muscle</b> significantly more susceptible to ischemia. The clinical significance {{of this is that}} a myocardial infarction involving the PDA is more likely to cause mitral regurgitation.|$|E
50|$|The normal {{tricuspid valve}} usually has three {{leaflets}} and three <b>papillary</b> <b>muscles.</b> They {{are connected to}} the <b>papillary</b> <b>muscles</b> by the chordae tendineae, which lie in the right ventricle. Tricuspid valves will not always consist of three leaflets and may also occur with two or four leaflets; the number may change during one's lifetime.|$|R
40|$|Background. Sarcolemmal Na+-Ca 2 + {{exchange}} system {{is believed to}} be fundamental to the control of cardiac contractility. However, the relation between Na+-Ca 2 + exchange and the control of contractile force has not been studied in senescent myocardium. Methods. The role of Na+-Ca 2 + exchange in the regulation of the cardiac muscle's contractile force was studied in adult and senescent <b>papillary</b> <b>muscles</b> by simultaneously measuring intracellular sodium activity (a'Na), action potential, and contractile force while varying extracellular concentration of sodium and/or calcium. Results. Reduction of [Na+] 0 decreased a!Na from 8. 0 ± 1. 8 to 4. 1 ± 0. 8 in adult (- 3. 9 mM) and from 8. 7 ± 1. 9 to 4. 7 ± 0. 9 in senescent (- 4. 0 mM) <b>papillary</b> <b>muscles,</b> while developed tension (DT) increased by 80. 2 % in adult and by 135. 6 % in senescent <b>papillary</b> <b>muscles</b> (p <. 01 vs adult). During low [Ca 2 +] 0 and high [Na+j 0, a'N, and DT modifications were similar both in adult and senescent <b>papillary</b> <b>muscles.</b> During high [Ca 2 +] 0, a'Na decreased to a similar extent in both adult and senescent <b>papillary</b> <b>muscles,</b> while DT increased by 37. 8 % in adult and by 67. 8 % in senescent {p <. 05 vs adult).

40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the electrophysiological effects of resveratrol on guinea pig <b>papillary</b> <b>muscles</b> and the underlying mechanism. Action potentials were recorded by using intracellular microelectrode technique. The results obtained are as follows: (1) In normal <b>papillary</b> <b>muscles,</b> resveratrol (30, 60, and 120 µmol/L) shortened the duration of action potential (APD) in a concentration-dependent manner. (2) In partially depolarized <b>papillary</b> <b>muscles,</b> resveratrol (60 µmol/L) not only shortened APD, but also decreased the amplitude of action potential (APA), overshoot (OS) and maximal rate of depolarization in phase 0 (Vmax). (3) Perfusion with Ca 2 +-free K-H solution, completely abolished the effects of resveratrol (60 µmol/L) on <b>papillary</b> <b>muscles.</b> (4) Applica-tion of potassium channel blocker tetraethylammonium chloride (TEA, 20 mmol/L) did not prevent the effect of resveratrol (60 µmol/L) on action potential. (5) Pretreatment with NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 1 mmol/L), a nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor, failed to abolish the effect of resveratrol (60 µmol/L). All these results indicate that the electrophysiological effects of resveratrol on guinea pig <b>papillary</b> <b>muscles</b> are likely due to the reduction of calcium influx, which might not be mediated by NO...|$|R

40|$|Change of interval–force {{dependence}} of rat <b>papillary</b> <b>muscles</b> at acute and course use of amiodarone was investigated. Methods. The experiments {{were performed on}} isolated <b>papillary</b> <b>muscles</b> of Wistar rats. The extrasystolic (0, 2 - 1, 5 s), postextrasystolic contractions and post-rest (4 - 60 s) reactions of rat left <b>papillary</b> <b>muscles</b> perfused Krebs-Henseleit solution with amiodarone (1 μM) and <b>papillary</b> <b>muscles</b> of rat treated amiodarone in dose 20 mg/kg/day for 14 days were investigated.

At the same time, only acute use of amiodarone leads to additional enhancement of potentialtion of contractile response at extrasystolic impulse and performance of post-rest test. Conclusion was made, that both acute and course use of amiodarone decreases excitability of cardiomyocytes but only at course use this antiarrythmic drug increases effective refractory period of myocardium.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether the impairment of con-tractility in the myocardium obtained from hypertrophied and failing hearts is due to a decreased store of energy and whether an imbalance exists between energy production and energy utilization in these hearts in vivo.

50|$|The term {{parachute}} {{mitral valve}} {{stems from the}} morphological appearance of the valve; that is to say, the mitral valve leaflets appear as the canopy of the parachute, the chordae as the strings and the <b>papillary</b> <b>muscle</b> as the harness. As in the normal human heart, there exists two mitral valve leaflets, each with their own set of chordae. Unique to the parachute mitral valve is that the chordae insert on one <b>papillary</b> <b>muscle,</b> rather than two distinct papillary muscles. Often, the chordae are short and thick and this combination of factors leads to restricted movement of the mitral valve leaflets and obstruction of blood flow into the left ventricle.|$|E
50|$|Secondary mitral {{insufficiency}} {{is due to}} the dilatation of the left ventricle that causes stretching of the mitral valve annulus and displacement of the <b>papillary</b> <b>muscles.</b> This dilatation of the left ventricle can be due to any cause of dilated cardiomyopathy including aortic insufficiency, nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, and Noncompaction cardiomyopathy. Because the <b>papillary</b> <b>muscles,</b> chordae, and valve leaflets are usually normal in such conditions, it is also called functional {{mitral insufficiency}}.|$|R
50|$|The {{mitral valve}} {{apparatus}} comprises two valve leaflets, the mitral valve annulus, which forms a {{ring around the}} valve leaflets, and the <b>papillary</b> <b>muscles,</b> which tether the valve leaflets to the left ventricle and prevent them from prolapsing into the left atrium. The chordae tendineae are also present and connect the valve leaflets to the <b>papillary</b> <b>muscles.</b> Dysfunction {{of any of these}} portions of the mitral valve apparatus can cause regurgitation.|$|R
