Assessments of muscle strength, physical function, quadriceps cross sectional (CSA) area, health-related quality of life, and clinical and laboratory parameters were assessed at baseline and after the intervention.

The experimental preparation was an isolated, isovolumic retrograde blood-perfused rabbit heart. Both developed pressure (r = 0. 94) and dp/dt (r = 0. 95) exhibited strong linear correlations with myocardial oxygen consumption that were stable {{for up to}} 45 min after blood flow reduction. In contrast, tissue high energy phosphate content exhibited nonlinear relationships with both developed pressure and oxygen consumption such that systolic mechanical function and oxidative metabolism declined to 20 and 30 % of control values, respectively, before significant abnormalities in myocardial high energy phosphate stores were observed. Similarly, developed pressure and oxygen consumption decreased to 36 and 48 % of control, respectively, before abnormal tissue lactate content was detected.

40|$|International audienceTraffic matrix {{estimation}} is well-studied, but {{in general}} has been treated simply as a statistical inference problem. In practice, however, network operators seeking traffic matrix information {{have a range of}} options available to them. Operators can measure traffic flows directly; they can perform <b>partial</b> <b>flow</b> measurement, and infer missing data using models; or they can perform no flow measurement and infer traffic matrices directly from link counts. The advent of practical flow measurement makes the study of these tradeoffs more important. In particular, an important question is whether judicious modeling, combined with <b>partial</b> <b>flow</b> measurement, can provide traffic matrix estimates that are signficantly better than previous methods at relatively low cost. In this paper we make a number of contributions toward answering this question. First, we provide a taxonomy of the kinds of models that may make use of <b>partial</b> <b>flow</b> measurement, based {{on the nature of the}} measurements used and the spatial, temporal, or spatio-temporal correlation exploited. We then evaluate estimation methods which use each kind of model. In the process we propose and evaluate new methods, and extensions to methods previously proposed. We show that, using such methods, small amounts of traffic flow measurements can have significant impacts on the accuracy of traffic matrix estimation, yielding results much better than previous approaches. We also show that different methods differ in their bias and variance properties, suggesting that different methods may be suited to different applications...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Adding a {{small amount}} of {{nanoparticles}} to conventional fluids (nanofluids) has been proved to be an effective way for improving capability of heat transferring in base fluids. The change in micro structure of base fluids and micro motion of nanoparticles may be key factors for heat transfer enhancement of nanofluids. Therefore, it is essential to examine these mechanisms on microscopic level. The present work performed a Molecular Dynamics simulation on Couette flow of nanofluids and investigated the microscopic flow characteristics through visual observation and statistic analysis. It was found that the even-distributed liquid argon atoms near solid surfaces of nanoparticles could be seemed as a reform to base liquid and had contributed to heat transfer enhancement. In the process of Couette flow, nanoparticles moved quickly in the shear direction accompanying with motions of rotation and vibration in the other two directions. When the shearing velocity was increased, the motions of nanoparticles were strengthened significantly. The motions of nanoparticles could disturb the continuity of fluid and strengthen <b>partial</b> <b>flowing</b> around nanoparticles, and further enhanced heat transferring in nanofluids...|$|R
