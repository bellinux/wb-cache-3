Different analytic methods were chosen and {{used to try to}} verify the degradation of epoxy resin. In this work nine microorganisms were chose, which could potentially be able to degrade epoxy resin. Five of these nine are able to split Lignin, which has a similar chemical structure. This work used different analytic methods. Preliminary experiments were performed to determine if these methods are applicable to the subject of this work. The experiment to validate the folin-ciocalteuassay revealed that it is not adequate to verify the presence of phenols for the probes created in this work. Color reactions are caused by proteins and other reducing substances, which cannot be removed in preliminary steps. Color reactions falsifying the assay are caused by proteins and other reducing substances, which cannot be removed in preliminary steps. Verification using iron(III) -chloride to detect phenols also is not possible. Probes containing a mineral medium crystalize into a salt which prevents the detection of phenols. There is no improvement when re-examining the probe after dilution or removal of the salt. In the following experiments, microorganisms were cultivated using epoxy resin. Growth of the microorganisms was monitored. After being incubated for a period of time, the cultures were examined using different analytic methods. A first experiment mainly examined lignin-reducing microorganisms. Those were incubated with liquid epoxy resin and epoxy resin grates. The medium used was isotonic saline inoculated using <b>preparatory</b> <b>cultures</b> in medium 90. There are indications that a degradation of epoxid resin took place. However, {{it was not possible to}} prove this with analytic methods, like the determination of dry cell concentration, or thin layer chromatography. In a further experiment, the microorganisms were cultivated with epoxy resin using a mineral medium. This incubation inhibited the growth of some microorganisms like, for example, Phanerochaete chrysosporium. For other microorganisms it promoted growth like, for example, Rhodococcus rhodochrous. There are some growth characteristics that imply a degradation. One of them is increased growth near epoxy resin. The analytic methods are not able to detect changes in the cultures caused by degradation. Degradation of epoxy resin by microorganisms could not be proven. To be able to prove degradation, further experiments using different analytic methods will be necessary in the future...|$|R
60|$|For a {{long time}} {{previous}} {{to the death of}} Miss Custis, her mother, despairing of her recovery, had centred her hopes in her son, John Parke Custis. This rendered Washington's guardianship of him a delicate and difficult task. He was lively, susceptible, and impulsive; had an independent fortune in his own right, and an indulgent mother, ever ready to plead in his behalf against wholesome discipline. He had been placed under the care and instruction of an Episcopal clergyman at Annapolis, but was occasionally at home, mounting his horse, and taking a part, while yet a boy, in the fox-hunts at Mount Vernon. His education had consequently been irregular and imperfect, and not such as Washington would have enforced had he possessed over him the absolute authority of a father. Shortly after the return of the latter from his tour to the Ohio, he was concerned to find that there was an idea entertained of sending the lad abroad, though but little more than sixteen years of age, to travel under the care of his clerical tutor. Through his judicious interference, the travelling scheme was postponed, and it was resolved to give the young gentleman's mind the benefit of a little <b>preparatory</b> home <b>culture.</b>|$|R
40|$|Teaching Romanian to {{international}} students represents {{an important element}} for the image of our educational system and for our culture. All universities offer study programs {{to international}} students, which include <b>preparatory</b> language and <b>culture</b> courses that can facilitate, {{on the one hand}} students’ cultural adaptation and orientation in both the new educational system and the society and, on the other hand, their successful intercultural communication. The article is based on a qualitative research done at The Polytechnic University of Bucharest. Students of different nationalities participated in two exploratory focus groups, and the findings reflect a set of principles and methodological recommendations referring to: perceptions regarding the competences of an “intercultural speaker”, obstacles in communication and in the cultural adaptation, opinions on the teaching objectives of the intercultural communication competence in a language classroom. We consider that the study programmes for teaching Romanian to international students in universities should take into account both the linguistic aspect and the intercultural competence...|$|R
