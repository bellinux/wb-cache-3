COMPETITIVE DYNAMICS OF PRICE PROMOTIONS Given the large dollar amounts at stake, manufacturers and retailers devote considerable time and effort designing and updating promotion calendars. While designing the promotion schedule, some questions that managers need to address are: How does an unusually large <b>promotional</b> <b>discount</b> offered impact the timing of the next “sale ” and the depth of discount to be offered? Should a deep discount by a competitor affect the timing or depth of the next promotion? More generally, should one respond to competitive promotion by adjusting the timing of the next “sale”, the discount to be offered, or both? To address these issues, we examine a duopolistic market wherein brands repeatedly compete for heterogeneous consumers: the loyal consumers buy from only one of the brands; the semi-loyal consumers consider both brands but are willing to pay a premium for the brand purchased last period; the switchers value the two brands identically and buy the lowest priced brand. Unlike static models of price promotion, our model incorporates dynamics by explicitly considering “purchase event feedback”:...|$|E
40|$|Purpose of the article: The {{article is}} based on the theory of price {{elasticity}} of demand. The theory brings the possibility of practical use in promotional discounts planning. Therefore the article is trying to utilize price elasticity of demand as a tool for planning of successful promotional discounts. Due to the shopping behavior of Czech customers, the topic is very current. More than 40 presents of the whole purchases in the Czech Republic are purchased in promotional discounts. Methodology/methods: The general procedure of the price elasticity analysis is based on secondary data which come from scientific works done by other researchers in the area. The second and most important data source are the real date on sales, purchase and sales prices and their changes before during and after the discount action, that comes from the company materials of one Czech retail chain. The price elasticity of demand was calculated as arc price elasticity. As the main criteria for evaluation of discount efficiency were selected changes in sales volumes as a result of promotional discounts, that are shown in the price elasticity of demand and changes in gross margin. Scientific aim: The study is aimed at Czech food retail. The objective of this paper is a proposal of the rules for promotional discounts planning, which are based on the knowledge of price elasticity of demand. Findings: Among the products whose value of the price elasticity of demand is the smallest, are included the products such bread, salami, sausages and mineral water, which can be considered as normal part of consumers’ diet. Conclusions: The most important rules for the choice of products in <b>promotional</b> <b>discount</b> can be characterized as high level of price elasticity, wide variety of products without close substitutes and new products for which will be subsequently analyzed price elasticity of demand...|$|E

Obesity {{is associated with}} a host of health and economic problems, and as such is becoming a prevelant topic for discussion among academics and the public in general, and is therefore of particular concern to the business world. There is a strong focus on reducing sugar consumption, ans with the announcement of the implementation of a sugar tax in South Africa, retailers have been identified as a crucial element in the value chain in providing healthier alternatives to consumers. They have the ability to utilise elements of the marketing mix to influence consumers' in-store purchase decisions and respond to the demand for healthier, sugar-free products. This study focuses on the effectiveness of price, placement and assortment as levers of the marketing mix with which retailers can drive demand. Quasi-experimental and experimental event-based time series studies were conducted with a focus on carbonated soft drinks. Quantitative price and sales units data were gathered from a prominent South African retailer. Two separate studies were conducted, one to understand the impact of the presence of promotional pricing as well as the depth of discount, and the second to understand the impact of a shelf format on consumer demand for sugar-free products. Data were analysed using multiple regression analysis in order to gain insights into the impact of changes of the marketing mix on consumer demand. Key findings of these studies are summarised in a framework that outlines the priority of marketing mix elements for retailers to utilise in order to drive demand for sugar-free products. Assortment was found to be the first requirement, ensuring there is availability of sugar-free variants to meet purchase motivations. Secondly, the presence of a pricing promotion was key, followed by the depth of the <b>promotional</b> <b>discount.</b> It was established that consumers within the CSD category were attuned to pricing promotions, and if retailers take the decision to drive sugar-free products, these products should be prioritised for pricing investment over sugar-sweetened alternatives. Results showed that merchandising the shelf according to sugar content (shelf format) had no impact on the demand for sugar-free products. The findings of this research built on the literature around marketing mix elements within retail, as well as studies around influencing consumers to purchase and consumer healthier products.

The primary aim of this study was to examine the association between healthy, diet-based, social marketing interventions in grocery stores and frequency of fruit and vegetable intake. MethodsA social marketing campaign was conducted among 17 grocery stores (N = 240 participant surveys) over 4 months in 5 rural Kentucky counties. Interventions included providing food samples, recipe cards, and <b>promotional</b> <b>discounts</b> on fruits and vegetables and moving high-calorie foods to side aisles. ResultsMost survey participants reported that recipe cards influenced their desire to purchase ingredients as well as fruits and vegetables in general. Results indicated a significant association between the influence of recipe cards and frequency of fruit and vegetable consumption. ConclusionSmall-scale interventions in grocery stores influenced purchasing choices among Appalachian residents. Working with various store managers and food venues in rural high-obesity communities is a promising way to encourage purchasing of fruits and vegetables.

Consumer behaviour changes drastically in times of crisis. Czech consumer is addressed daily by a specific communication media of store chains – the leaflets.

Respondents were asked about their financial situation, to what extent they change their buying behaviour with respect to the income level of households.

40|$|Applying revenue {{management}} techniques for the entertainment industries, such as theaters, faces several specific challenges. Many theaters increase their audience and revenues through <b>promotional</b> <b>discounts</b> and pricing strategies {{based on the}} quality of the seats. Due to the varying quality of shows, and the high availability of seats, many customers purchase tickets or postpone their purchases in anticipation of future promotion periods and discounts. In order to respond to such purchasing habits, it is vital to understand the underlying process that governs the timing of the customer’s purchases. To this end, we develop a competing proportional hazard framework that models the dynamic effects of an organization’s show and time related pricing decisions on the customer’s propensity to purchase a ticket for a variety of dates and times during a specified timeframe. We test our model on data from a leading performing arts organization located in the Northeast USA, covering theater ticket sales over two seasons. We demonstrate the model’s descriptive capabilities by reviewing the effects of discounts, the timing of the show, the base price of the ticket category, and multiple factors for the sales figures for the fifty-three individual performances. Finally, we define dynamic pricing and discounting strategies to increase the organization’s revenues. For instance, we provide and empirically test our suggestions to identify attractive ticket price tiers for subscribers and occasional buyers over time; and to develop discount decisions that increase the revenues from each performance. 1...|$|R
40|$|Background: Diarrheal {{diseases}} kill {{two million}} children every year despite {{the availability of}} effective and inexpensive technologies to improve water quality and limit the spread of pathogens. There is a growing literature {{on the effectiveness of}} such technologies but important gaps remain in understanding the demand for these products and the adoption decision. Methods: This review expands upon and complements several existing summary articles by focusing on willingness to pay for cleaner water. Willingness to pay can be measured by price randomizations that induce people to reveal their valuation in real purchase decisions or by other methods such as contingent valuation exercises in hypothetical situations and discrete choice analysis. The review conducts a systematic search for experimental evidence on willingness to pay for cleaner water. Results: This review finds few studies that have used randomized approaches or even attempted to measure households’ willingness to pay for cleaner water, but a very clear picture emerges from the existing evidence: willingness to pay is often less than the cost of these technologies and demand is very sensitive to price. Existing evidence suggests that positive prices do not effectively target products to those who need them the most and that positive prices are a key barrier to realizing potential gains associated with water treatment. Implications: Given the evidence of low valuation for water quality, despite the impact of water-borne disease on child health, the challenge for research and policy is to identify innovative service delivery models and technological innovations that drive prices down and make public subsidies more feasible. Future willingness to pay studies should be based on real purchases and use. Experimental methods to collect estimates of willingness to pay are easily justified as <b>promotional</b> <b>discounts</b> and could be implemented via coupon programs that make it possible to assemble large datasets quickly and cheaply...|$|R
40|$|Discount pricing – the {{strategy}} of reducing regular prices through quantity, seasonal, cash or <b>promotional</b> <b>discounts,</b> coupons, customer loyalty programs and the like – {{plays an important role}} in retail pricing and is widespread business practice in virtually all retail industries in Austria. This is the main result of our study, for which we surveyed major Austrian retailers and analyzed empirical data compiled by A. C. Nielsen. Moreover, we found that shoppers who participate in customer loyalty programs benefit from discounts more frequently and pay less on average than shoppers who do not. In Austria, three out of four consumers held at least one loyalty card in 2008. All in all, some 30 million loyalty cards were circulating in Austria at the time, with five cards per cardholder being the average. 90 % of respondents indicated the prospect of instant rebates as the main incentive for holding loyalty cards. The retailers participating in the OeNB survey generate roughly one-third of their sales revenue under customer loyalty programs. On the consumer side, the average level of retail discounting (as established in the OeNB survey) adds up to a purchasing power effect of approximately EUR 300 million a year. In addition, the paper assesses the HICP coverage of discounts with a view to drawing lessons for policymaking. The current measurement practices are found to reflect some but not all forms of discounting. Looking ahead, it would be advisable to change measurement practices to catch the effect of customer loyalty programs, as they are common in many industries and tend to generate higher discounts than other discounting practices. The most suitable method would be to cover retailers who run loyalty programs throughout Austria and offer the same terms to all cardholders. Retail scanners could provide useful price data for inflation measurement. discount pricing, price differentiation, customer loyalty program, retail business,...|$|R

Sepe, Ling, and Glantz (2002) found that when tobacco companies increase their marketing and promotion practices in nightclubs and bars concurrently there is a rise in young adults smoking. To better understand the perceptions and experiences surrounding tobacco use and tobacco marketing, we conducted four focus groups in two mid-size U. S. cities with young adults. The analysis of these focus groups produced five complementary findings: (1) tobacco marketing and tobacco use {{was associated with the}} social scene of college, (2) tobacco marketers give personal attention to young adults, (3) smokers and nonsmokers perceive tobacco marketers differently, (4) tobacco marketing promotes tobacco use, (5) and smoking status was ambiguously defined. In 1999, the tobacco industry spent $ 335. 7 million on promotional items such as t-shirts, coasters, and lighters (Federal Trade Commission, 2001). The tobacco industry spent 33. 7 million dollars just on free cigarettes that same year (Federal Trade Commission, 2001). In 2002, advertising and marketing by five major tobacco companies totaled nearly 12. 5 billion dollars (Federal Trade Commission, 2004). Obviously, the tobacco industry spends this magnitude of money on marketing because it persuades many people to experiment and use tobacco products (Pierce, et al., 1998).
