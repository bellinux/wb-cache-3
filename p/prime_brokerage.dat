50|$|Upon Lehman's collapse, investors {{realized}} that no prime broker {{was too big}} to fail and spread their counterparty risk across several <b>prime</b> <b>brokerages,</b> especially those with strong capital reserves. This trend towards multi-prime brokerage is also not without its problems. From an operational standpoint, it is adding some complexity and hedge funds have to invest in technologies and extra resources to manage the different relationships. Also, from the investors' point of view, the multi-prime brokerage is adding some complexity to the due diligence as it becomes very complicated to perform proper assets reconciliation between the fund's administrator and its counterparties.|$|R
40|$|A {{two state}} Markov chain model {{is used to}} {{describe}} and forecast the over time behavior of the best retail customers at Merrill Lynch. This model has 4 behaviorally meaningful parameters which capture the effect of recently being a prime customer, the differing average commissions generated across customers and the exiting {{of some of these}} customers from the Merrill Lynch system. This model helps management to understand the dynamics of the prime customers' behavior. In particular, the forecasts generated by the model allow for better analyses of possible strategies for providing special services for these very good customers. The model which was developed with 1976 – 1979 data is validated against the actual 1980 behavior of Merrill Lynch customers. retail <b>brokerage,</b> <b>prime</b> customers, Markov process, forecasting...|$|R

25|$|Institutional investors buy {{and sell}} {{on behalf of their}} {{individual}} clients, be they pension funds, endowments and the like, or pooled funds such as mutual funds, unit trusts or hedge funds. As such, their client assets are safe kept with either custodian banks or broker-dealers (<b>Prime</b> <b>brokerage).</b> Furthermore, institutional investors may {{buy and sell}} through any number of broker-dealers which in turn settle such trades at the designated custodians and prime brokers. Investment managers generally differ from hedge funds on how much risk each pursues in its investment strategies. For example, investment managers generally do not sell short, but hedge funds do.|$|E
25|$|Prime brokers are broker-dealers {{which offer}} custody and other {{services}} to hedge funds. <b>Prime</b> <b>brokerage</b> has generally been considered as more risky than traditional custody, primarily because hedge funds have been viewed as more risky than institutional investors. Moreover, in the US a hedge fund may execute trades through any number of broker-dealers. But in the settlement process, those trades become the trades of the prime broker, as though the hedge fund had executed the trades only through that broker. The risk of the hedge fund's inability to settle those trades becomes that of the prime broker.|$|E
500|$|According to a 2011 {{article in}} Investments & Pensions Europe, the risk parity {{approach}} has [...] "moderate risks" [...] which include: [...] communicating its value to boards of directors; [...] unforeseen {{events like the}} 2008 market decline; market timing risks associated with implementation; the use of leverage and derivatives and basis risks associated with derivatives. Other critics warn {{that the use of}} leverage and relying heavily on fixed income assets may create its own risk. Portfolio manager Ben Inker has criticized risk parity for being a benchmarking approach that gives too much relative weight to bonds when compared to other alternative portfolio approaches. However, proponents of risk parity say that its purpose is to avoid predicting future returns. Inker also says that risk parity requires too much leverage to produce the same expected returns as conventional alternatives. Proponents answer that the reduced risk from additional diversification more than offsets the additional leverage risk and that leverage through publicly traded futures and <b>prime</b> <b>brokerage</b> financing of assets also means a high percentage of cash in the portfolio to cover losses and margin calls. Additionally Inker says that bonds have negative skew, (small probability of large losses and large probability of small gains) which makes them a dangerous investment to leverage. Proponents have countered by saying that their approach calls for reduced exposure to bonds as volatility increases and provides less skew than conventional portfolios.|$|E

50|$|Where {{collateral}} is pledged in <b>prime</b> <b>brokerage</b> transactions, it {{is common}} for the broker to rehypothecate the collateral. Concerns remained, however, that because the rehypothecation might theoretically mean that the lender could lose title to the collateral, and thereby possibly be unable to reconvey it to the primary customer, it was speculated that such rehypothecation is possibly unlawful.|$|E

Counterparty diversification saw the largest flows of client assets out of Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs (the two firms who had historically had the largest share of the business, and therefore had the most exposure to the diversification process), and into firms which were perceived, at the time, {{to be the most}} creditworthy. The banks which captured these flows to the greatest degree were Credit Suisse, JP Morgan, and Deutsche Bank.

5000|$|The {{concept and}} term [...] "prime brokerage" [...] is {{generally}} {{attributed to the}} U.S. broker-dealer Furman Selz in the late 1970s. However, the first hedge fund operation is attributed to Alfred Winslow Jones in 1949. In the pre-prime brokerage marketplace, portfolio management was a significant challenge; money managers had {{to keep track of}} all of their own trades, consolidate their positions and calculate their performance regardless of which brokerage firms executed those trades or maintained those positions. The concept was immediately seen to be successful, and was quickly copied by the dominant bulge bracket brokerage firms such as Morgan Stanley, Bear Stearns, Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse, Citigroup, and Goldman Sachs. At this nascent stage, hedge funds were much smaller than they are today and were mostly U.S. domestic long-short equities funds. The first non-U.S. <b>prime</b> <b>brokerage</b> business was created by Merrill Lynch's London office in the late 1980s. Post the 2007 - 09 financial crisis new entrants came to the market with custody-based <b>prime</b> <b>brokerage</b> offerings.|$|E
