40|$|The {{principle}} of national <b>procedural</b> <b>autonomy</b> stipulates that Member states {{are free to}} {{set up their own}} (procedural) rules (and remedies therein) which govern the enforcement of EU law. However, Member states do not enjoy thorough autonomy in doing so, since they are (primarily) limited with the {{principle of}} effectiveness and the principle of equivalence. Because the array of procedural rules is vast and diversified throughout administrative, civil and criminal law, {{it comes as no surprise}} that the actual scope of <b>procedural</b> <b>autonomy</b> differs signifi cantly from one issue to another. Academic discourse has occasionally tackled with the fractured scope of <b>procedural</b> <b>autonomy,</b> attempting to defi ne the principle and its internal workings in various ways, while some authors have even gone so far as to deny its very existence. In this article, the author avoids the pursuit of a unified conceptualization of the subject-matter. Rather, the article fully embraces the fragmented reality of <b>procedural</b> <b>autonomy</b> and ascribes it to the particularities stemming from the demanding goals of procedural law. The article provides the reader with a brief, yet fairly concise descriptive presentation on the current state of play in regards to the understanding of the principle of national <b>procedural</b> <b>autonomy</b> and reinforces the need for pursuing a balanced approach to the principle and its limitations...|$|E

The empirical findings add further strength to economists’ argument that, net of values and personality traits, autonomy and independence are the mechanisms by which self-employment leads to higher levels of job satisfaction.

40|$|This study {{contributes}} {{to our understanding}} of state constitutional provisions designed to provide constitutional authority for state college and university governing boards to direct the internal affairs of institutions under their control. In these states, independent constitutional authority for public colleges and universities is meant to limit excessive political interference from other parts of state government (Beckham, 1977, 1978; Glenny & Dalglish, 1973). This authority granted to governing boards of public colleges and universities is commonly referred to as constitutional autonomy (Beckham, 1977, 1978; McKnight, 2004). While constitutional language serves as the initial grant of internal control, court cases interpreting the provisions determine to a significant extent the legally recognized constitutional authority exercised by these governing boards (Beckham, 1977, 1978; Glenny & Dalglish, 1973). This study builds on the work of Beckham (1977, 1978) to update the current legal status of constitutional autonomy. The study shows that Michigan, California and Minnesota continue as the states with the most substantial legal recognition of constitutional autonomy. Court decisions in six states (Louisiana, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota and Oklahoma) and attorney general opinions in Idaho confirm the existence of moderate to limited constitutional authority for public higher education governing boards. A substantially restricted form of constitutional autonomy may exist in Nebraska and South Dakota. In Florida and Georgia, the legal status of constitutional autonomy is ambiguous. The status of constitutional autonomy was still not completely settled in the four states of Alabama, Alaska, Hawaii and Mississippi, but cases suggest judicial recognition of constitutional autonomy in these states unlikely. For Arizona, Colorado, Missouri and Utah, legal opinions reflect judicial rejection of constitutional autonomy. In addition to assessing whether case law suggests strong, weak or ambiguous judicial treatment of constitutional autonomy or outright rejection of the legal doctrine, the study also analyzes constitutional autonomy cases using the concepts of <b>procedural</b> and substantive <b>autonomy</b> derived from the higher education literature. This analysis indicates that the concepts of <b>procedural</b> and substantive <b>autonomy</b> provide a useful analytical lens to better understand the impact of the legal doctrine on institutional autonomy...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to examine how the EU {{directive}} 2004 / 35 /EC on environmental liability impacts the Swedish administrative legal order. The thesis examines the directive through two main EU principles - the principle of good administration and the principle of <b>procedural</b> <b>autonomy.</b> The EU principle of good administration as a concept contains various procedural and substantive obligations {{that make up the}} subject for examination of the directive, both as regulated in the directive and as general principles of EU law. The directive is analyzed using a comparative method to determine to what extent the procedural and substantive principles of the directive impacts the Swedish administrative law, and weather or not the Swedish regulations comply with the EU principle of good administration. The results of the study shows that, althought there’s a general principle of national <b>procedural</b> <b>autonomy,</b> the EU principles of good administration do affect the Swedish administrative regulation in various aspects, through the implementaion of the directive on environmental liability as well as general principles of EU law. Furthermore the study shows that the Swedish regulations that are used to implement the directive don’t always act in accordance with the EU principles of good administration in certain areas, which potentially could restrain the impact of the directive in the Swedish legal order...|$|E

Gormley, University of Groningen and College of Europe. Defence date: 16 September 2013 First made {{available}} online on 15 January 2015. While {{the law is}} often highly harmonized at EU level, {{the ways in which}} it is realized in the various national courts are not. This thesis looks at enforcement through damages claims for violations of EU public procurement rules. Despite important recent amendments to the procurement remedies regime, the damages provision remains indeterminate. The legislative inertia pressures the CJEU to give an interpretation and raises the question as to how the Court should deal with damages. The requirements on damages claims are clarified under both general and public procurement EU law. The action for damages is conceived as a legal process which incorporates the national realm. Therefore, a comparative law part (covering England, France, Germany and the Netherlands) examines national damages litigation in public procurement law. A horizontal discussion of the legal issues which structurally frame damages claims is provided. The remedy of damages is analyzed as a bundle of rules and its constitutive and quantification criteria are studied, thereby refining the the Member States’ common conceptual base of damages claims. Functionally, the lost chance emerges as a compromise capable of mitigating the typically problematic nature of causation and uncertainty in public procurement constellations. An adjudicative approach to damages in EU law is developed through Member State liability and the <b>procedural</b> <b>autonomy</b> doctrine. Member State liability is construed as a form of constitutional liability which is distinct from damages arising under the 'effectiveness’ postulate of <b>procedural</b> <b>autonomy.</b> <b>Procedural</b> <b>autonomy</b> as currently used is legally indeterminate and inadequate {{from the point of view}} of procedural theory. The thesis proposes to sharpen the effectiveness test in three dimensions: material, based on the intrinsic connection between enforcement rules and substantive law; vertical, in delimiting the spheres of influence of national and EU courts; and in terms of institutional balance vis-à-vis the EU legislator...|$|E

40|$|While {{harmonization}} and {{convergence of}} national substantive laws are well advanced in the European Union, a similar convergence and harmonization of the procedural rules and institutional frameworks {{has not taken}} place. The implementation, supervision, and enforcement of EU law are left to the Member States {{in accordance with the}} so-called national <b>procedural</b> and institutional <b>autonomy.</b> This "procedural competence" of the Member States means that the Member States have to provide remedies and procedures governing actions intended to ensure the enforcement of rights derived from EU law. Harmonized substantive rules are implemented through diverging procedures and different kinds of enforcement bodies, but this decentralized enforcement challenges the coherent and uniform application of EU law. In an enforcement system where Member States apply divergent procedures, may impose a variety of sanctions and remedies administered by various actors the effectiveness of EU law, effective judicial protection and effective law administration may be at risk. This chapter analyzes the development of EU law concerning law enforcement and takes a critical look at the EU’s aim to harmonize the national procedural rules when EU law is enforced. It will examine the question of which legal basis can be used in order to harmonize procedural rules, whether harmonizing procedural rules would be more efficient than the existing legal diversity and the economics of harmonization will be applied to assess the top-down harmonization by the EU and comparative law, and economics is applied to evaluate the bottom-up voluntary harmonization of the Member States...|$|R

How does it fit into our systems and into our way of thinking? If we look at the current trends in criminal proceedings fairness, procedural justice, conflict resolution, negotiated law, pragmatically acceptable compromise, <b>procedural</b> truth, party <b>autonomy,</b> court service, communication and interaction are good examples of the topics which are currently being discussed.

At least the legislator has pointed out the efficiency, the appropriate allocation of resources and the simplifying the criminal proceedings when suggesting adopting the plea bargaining in Finland. The novelty has not been put into philosophical context or into the systemic context of criminal proceedings.

However, there seem to be more coherent trends behind all of that as well - namely, the change of paradigm...|$|R

40|$|This work {{analyses}} {{the limits}} that {{the principle of}} State liability for damages suffered by individuals because of breach of EU law poses to the <b>procedural</b> <b>autonomy</b> of the Member States of the EU.

The first part of the research, instead, focuses on the specific limits that european law poses on the rules of procedure related to the legal regime of the right to compensation and its operating conditions; in particular, this first part explores respectively the “substantive” and “procedural” limits that EU law poses to the State’s autonomy to regulate actions for damages for breaches of EU law. The substantial limits concern the conditions of eligibility of liability and the constitutive conditions of the right to compensation; the procedural limits to the action for damages refer to the concrete organization and characteristics of the judicial action. The second part of the research is devoted to rules of procedure governing the relations between judicial remedies explicitly aimed at protecting the right to reparation and other remedies that may be relevant, both europeans and nationals. The first chapter of the second part of this work focuses on the rules governing the relations between the action for damages brought up at the national level and the remedies provided by european Treaties; finally, I explore the relations between the action for damages brought up at the national level and other remedies present in the same national juridical order.

Directors are particularly influential in this regard, as they are often responsible for instigating an infringement or could have prevented it from taking place. After considering various political, cultural, and legal factors, it will be contended that criminalization of competition law is not, at the current stage of development, the appropriate step forward. Instead, a system of disqualification would be a more proportionate and workable solution that would combat the underlying causes of competition law breaches and have a significant deterrent effect.

40|$|This Article {{examines}} {{the validity of}} the Commission 2 ̆ 7 s position on the private enforceability of commitment decisions in national courts in the European Union in light of the current state of European law and other important procedural and practical considerations for third parties wishing to bring enforcement proceedings. As will become apparent, national courts faced with an application for private enforcement will have to grapple with a series of challenging legal issues concerning the nature of commitment decisions. The first of these questions will concern whether a commitment decision, which is a Community measure, will be capable of enforcement by application of the concept of direct effect of Community law. Our examination of the principles of direct effect indicates, however, that reliance on this concept may cause difficulties for national courts. Secondly, the principle of national <b>procedural</b> <b>autonomy</b> requires that enforcement proceedings will be governed by the procedural rules of the national court seized of the action. Even if commitment decisions are directly effective, there may consequently be substantial impediments to their effective private enforcement due to the national rules of procedure in the Member States...|$|E
40|$|Summary: This paper {{discusses}} the Köbler case, {{in which the}} Court of Justice confirmed that the principle of Member States’ liability for breaches of Community law (the “Francovich” Principle) also applies to breaches committed by national judiciaries. The author looks at this decision and, more importantly, at the Court’s reasoning {{from the point of}} view of the concept of multi-constitutionalism, which, he believes, is a viable model for a pluralistic entity such as the European Union. Several shortcomings of the decision are discussed in this paper, including the Court’s avoidance of difficult questions by reference to the principle of national <b>procedural</b> <b>autonomy,</b> or its unpersuasive comparative reasoning. One further shortcoming is the lack of any balancing argumentation, which would have seemed appropriate in a case where two legal principles (the effectiveness of Community law, on the one hand, and legal certainty and res judicata, on the other) stood in opposition. In the final part of the paper, the author points out that the problem of gaining acceptance for this decision may be even more difficult with regard to judges in the new Member States, as their legal systems are simultaneously undergoing not only Europeanisation but also transition...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{the ways}} in which Community law influences national laws in order to ascertain effective and uniform protection of individual Community rights. Two levels of influence were examined: first, the one at which the techniques and principles of bestowing the rights on individuals were developed, and second, the one at which national provisions on remedies and judicial procedures are influenced. The theoretical context within which the analysis was placed was Hohfeld's analysis of legal rights. Placed within this theoretical context, the inconsistencies in Community principles bestowing rights on individuals were found.
