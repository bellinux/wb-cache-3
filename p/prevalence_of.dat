The relative <b>prevalences</b> <b>of</b> SCA 1 and SCA 2 were significantly higher in Caucasian pedigrees (15 % and 14 %, respectively) than in Japanese pedigrees (3 % and 5 %, respectively), corresponding to the observation that the frequencies of large ANs of SCA 1 (alleles > 30 repeats) and of SCA 2 (alleles > 22 repeats) were significantly higher in Caucasians than in Japanese.

40|$|Introduction: Adolescence is a {{stressful}} period due to physical, psychological, sexual changes, {{and the presence}} of psychiatric disorders such as depression, anxiety, and stress at this stage of life is a matter of concern. Objectives: The objectives of the study were to determine the <b>prevalences</b> <b>of</b> depression, anxiety, and stress among higher secondary school students of Imphal and to determine the association between depression, anxiety, and stress and selected variables such as gender, standard, and religion. Materials and methods: From September 2014 to October 2014, a cross-sectional study was conducted among higher secondary school students of Imphal. The sample size was calculated to be 750. Seven schools were randomly selected, and all the students in that school were enrolled in the study. The study tool used was a questionnaire containing DASS (Depression Anxiety Stress Scale) and sociodemographic characteristics. Results: The <b>prevalences</b> <b>of</b> depression, anxiety, and stress among 830 valid respondents were 19. 5 %, 24. 4 %, and 21. 1 %, respectively. In total, 81. 6 % of the respondents had {{at least one of the}} studied disorders and 34. 7 % of the respondents had all the three negative states. The <b>prevalences</b> <b>of</b> depression, anxiety, and stress were high among females and were significant for anxiety (P = 0. 00) and stress (P = 0. 04). The <b>prevalences</b> <b>of</b> depression and stress were significantly higher among 12 th standard students with P-values of 0. 00 and 0. 02. Conclusion: The <b>prevalences</b> <b>of</b> depression, anxiety, and stress were high with anxiety and stress significantly higher among females, whereas <b>prevalences</b> <b>of</b> depression and stress were significantly higher among 12 th standard students.

40|$|Summary. Factors {{influencing}} <b>prevalences</b> <b>of</b> heteroxenous coccidia in {{the populations}} of small mammals and buzzards (Buteo buteo) were studied in the Czech Republic. Seventy one percent of buzzard broods were positive for Frenkelia-like sporocysts. Prevalence increased with nestling age and number, and reached 100 % at nest desertion. The <b>prevalences</b> <b>of</b> brain sarcosporidia (Frenkelia glareoli and F. microti) in rodents were higher in ecotones than in open habitats, in spring than in autumn, in heavier individuals, and on 2 nd and 3 rd day of trapping. These factors were significant although the overall prevalence was different in different host species (Clethrionomys glareolus, Microtus arvalis, Apodemus flavicollis, A. sylvaticus). The <b>prevalences</b> <b>of</b> muscle sarcosporidia in rodents and Sorex araneus were also positively influenced by habitat and host weight, while only for M. arvalis was the prevalence higher in spring. Host sex, locality and year did not show any effects on the prevalences. Besides two Frenkelia species, five Sarcocystis species were found (S. putorii, S. cernae, S. cf sebeki, and two undescribed species from C. glareolus and Sorex araneus). Natural infections of C. glareolus with F. microti and of A. flavicollis with F. glareoli are reported for the first time. Our study demonstrates that <b>prevalences</b> <b>of</b> brain and muscle sarcosporidians in small mammals are influenced by similar factors (intermediate host habitat and age) in different host-parasite combinations...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Objective: To {{assess the}} <b>prevalences</b> <b>of</b> asthma, {{allergic}} rhinitis, and allergic rhinoconjunctivitis in {{adolescents in the}} city of Belo Horizonte, Brazil, in 2012 by administering the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) questionnaire, as well as to compare the observed prevalences with those found in studies performed 10 years earlier and employing the same methodology used here. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study conducted between May and December of 2012 and involving adolescents in the 13 - to 14 -year age bracket. Participants were randomly selected from among adolescents studying at public schools in Belo Horizonte and completed the ISAAC questionnaire. Proportions were calculated in order to assess the <b>prevalences</b> <b>of</b> asthma, allergic rhinitis, and allergic rhinoconjunctivitis in the sample as a whole, and the chi-square goodness-of-fit test was used in order to compare the prevalences observed in 2012 with those found in 2002. Results: The <b>prevalences</b> <b>of</b> symptoms of asthma, allergic rhinitis, and allergic rhinoconjunctivitis in 2012 were 19. 8 %, 35. 3 %, and 16. 3 %, respectively, being significantly higher than those found in 2002 (asthma, p = 0. 006; allergic rhinitis, p < 0. 01; and allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, p = 0. 002).
