In December 2011, Russia finally joined the World Trade Organisation, allowing it a greater access to overseas markets. Some analysts estimate that WTO membership could bring the Russian economy a bounce of up to 3% annually. Russia ranks as the second-most corrupt country in Europe (after Ukraine), according to the Corruption Perceptions Index. The Norwegian-Russian Chamber of Commerce also states that [...] "orruption {{is one of the}} biggest problems both Russian and international companies have to deal with". Corruption in Russia is perceived as a significant problem impacting all aspects of life, including public administration, law enforcement, healthcare and education. The phenomenon of corruption is strongly established in the historical model of <b>public</b> <b>governance</b> in Russia and attributed to general weakness of rule of law in Russia. According to 2016 results of Corruption Perception Index of Transparency International, Russia ranked 131th place out of 176 countries with score 29.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Within {{the context}} of recent post-localism {{developments}} in English local government the paper shows firstly how management controls have become more enabling in response to changes in rules of <b>public</b> sector corporate <b>governance,</b> and secondly how changes in management control systems gave rise to new corporate governance practices. Design/methodology/approach: Theoretically the paper mobilises the concept of enabling control to reflect on contemporary changes in <b>public</b> sector corporate <b>governance.</b> It draws on the International Federation of Accountants’ (IFAC) and Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy (CIPFA) new <b>public</b> sector <b>governance</b> and management control system model and data gathered from a longitudinal qualitative field study of a local authority in north east England. The field study used interviews, observation and documentation review. Findings: This paper suggests specific {{ways in which the}} decentralisation of policy making and performance measurement in our case local authority gave rise to enabling corporate governance, and how corporate governance and management control practices went some way to aid in the pursuit of the public interest. In particular it shows that the management control system can be designed at the operational level to be enabling. We notice the significance of global transparency for supporting corporate <b>governance</b> practices around <b>public</b> interest. This paper reaffirms that accountability is but one element of <b>public</b> sector corporate <b>governance.</b> Rather, <b>public</b> sector corporate <b>governance</b> also pursues integrity, openness, defining outcomes, determining interventions, leadership and capacity, and risk and performance management. Practical implications: Insights into uses of such enabling practices in <b>public</b> sector corporate <b>governance</b> are relevant for many countries in which public sector funding has been cut, especially since the 2007 / 08 global financial crisis. Originality/value: This paper introduces the concept of enabling control into the <b>public</b> sector corporate <b>governance</b> and control debate by fleshing out the categories of <b>public</b> sector corporate <b>governance</b> and management control suggested recently by IFAC and CIPFA drawing on observed practices of a local government entity...|$|R
