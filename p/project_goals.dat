5|$|According to {{developer}} Matthew Dillon, {{progress is}} being made to provide both device input/output (I/O) and virtual file system (VFS) messaging capabilities that will enable the remainder of the <b>project</b> <b>goals</b> to be met. The new infrastructure will allow many parts of the kernel to be migrated out into userspace; here they will be more easily debugged as they will be smaller, isolated programs, instead of being small parts entwined in a larger chunk of code. Additionally, the migration of select kernel code into userspace has the benefit of making the system more robust; if a userspace driver crashes, it will not crash the kernel.|$|E

25|$|After an {{extensive}} situation analysis, a project or program is developed. The program needs to address human rights deficits related to certain groups, communities, or countries facing abuses or discrimination. Baselines and benchmarks are set, which create {{transparency and accountability}} in the <b>project.</b> <b>Goals</b> are also created during this step in order to analyze the program's effectiveness in a human rights context {{at the end of}} the project. Finally, NGOs encourage control over the project by the affected peoples, utilizing the Right to Participate principle.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{challenge}} of project management {{is to achieve}} all of the <b>project</b> <b>goals</b> within the given constraints. This information is usually described in project documentation, created {{at the beginning of}} the development process. The primary constraints are scope, time, quality and budget. The secondary — and more ambitious — challenge is to optimize the allocation of necessary inputs and apply them to meet pre-defined objectives. The object of project management is to produce a complete project which complies with the client's objectives. In many cases the object of project management is also to shape or reform the client's brief in order to feasibly be able to address the client's objectives. Once the client's objectives are clearly established they should impact on all decisions made by other people involved in the project-project managers, designers, contractors, sub-contractors, etc. If the project management objectives are ill-defined or too tightly prescribed it will have a detrimental effect on decision making.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the purest}} Coasian {{solutions}} {{today is the}} new phenomenon of Internet crowdfunding. Here rules are enforced by computer algorithms and legal contracts {{as well as social}} pressure. [...] For example, on the Kickstarter site, each funder authorizes a credit card purchase to buy a new product or receive other promised benefits, but no money changes hands until the funding goal is met. [...] Because automation and the Internet so reduce the transaction costs for pooling resources, <b>project</b> <b>goals</b> of only a few hundred dollars are frequently crowdfunded, far below the costs of soliciting traditional investors. [...] Other crowdfunded projects have raised over a million dollars, like the Arkyd-100 space satellite telescope funded on Kickstarter in June 2013.
