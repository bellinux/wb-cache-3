500|$|Peake {{is first}} heard of professionally in 1576 in {{the pay of}} the Office of the Revels, the {{department}} that oversaw court festivities for Elizabeth I. When Peake began practising as a portrait painter is uncertain. According to art historian Roy Strong, he was [...] "well established" [...] in London by the late 1580s, with a [...] "fashionable clientele". Payments made to him for portraits are recorded in the Rutland accounts at Belvoir in the 1590s. [...] A signed portrait from 1593, known as the [...] "Military Commander", shows Peake’s early style. Other portraits have been grouped with it {{on the basis of}} similar lettering. Its three-quarter-length <b>portrait</b> <b>format</b> is typical of the time.|$|E
2500|$|Kunimasu's {{earliest}} known {{print is}} a banzuke theatre playbill dating to early 1830. Signed [...] "eshi Utagawa Sadamasu ga" [...] , the print {{was almost certainly}} produced {{while he was in}} Edo studying under Utagawa Kunisada. Kunimasu has been described as an [...] "influential" [...] figure on the Osaka art scene, one of his greatest achievements being the popularization of the chūban format. Kunimasu began experimenting with close-up actor portraits in this size in 1840, not long before the Tenpō Reforms were to disrupt yakusha-e production. He encouraged his student and fellow pupil of Kunisada, Hirosada, to follow suit. With the repeal of the Tenpō Reforms in the spring of 1847, Hirosada was to pioneer a revival of the chūban <b>portrait</b> <b>format,</b> likely through the financial support of Kunimasu.|$|E
2500|$|Apart {{from the}} many values of normal-sized stamps, {{there have been two}} {{different}} formats used for [...] "high-value" [...] definitives. In 1969 a larger and more square format was used to issue stamps of 2/6, 5/-, 10/- and £1 face value, and was used again in 1970 for the decimal currency values of 10p, 20p and 50p. (The £1 stamp had the lettering re-designed in 1972 and was re-issued. This version is usually seen as a 'decimal' edition as opposed to the 'pre-decimal' stamp.) In 1977 a taller <b>portrait</b> <b>format</b> was used for the large £1, £2, and £5 stamps, and also at various times between 1983 and 1987 for the odd values of £1.30, £1.33, £1.41, £1.50 and £1.60. These values were withdrawn after the introduction of the [...] "Castles" [...] high-value stamps of 1988.|$|E
