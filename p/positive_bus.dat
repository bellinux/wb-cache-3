The proposed algorithm utilizes {{a group of}} three neighbor voltage vectors to construct the reference voltage space vector. In the proposed algorithm in each sector any one of the phases is clamped to either <b>positive</b> dc <b>bus</b> or negative dc bus. Hence, the proposed algorithm reduces the switching frequency and switching losses of the inverter.

40|$|A unified {{approach}} has been proposed in the paper for processing unbalanced operating conditions in transient stability calculations. The suggested method combined advantages of both abc phase coordinates and 012 sequence coordinates. The former is used to describe faults since it is suitable to modeling simultaneous faults and the latter is used for time simulation for its sparse nature. Novel fault description and coordinate conversion formulation is presented. The equivalent <b>positive</b> sequence <b>bus</b> admittance matrix is derived for interface with generators in stability simulation. With the new method, the sequence network constitution can be avoided; multiple and simultaneous faults and element parameter unbalance can be simulated easily; and the sparse technology can still be applied for study efficiency.

30|$|The major {{advantage}} of the proposed algorithm {{is that it can}} detect and classify faults with high accuracy and speed as demonstrated in this paper. Apart from being able to distinguish between the transient event and persistent fault, another {{advantage of}} the proposed technique is that the system remains protected even when one of the PMU fails. This is because the fault detection and faulted line identification is based on the presence of negative sequence voltage in the system and lowest <b>positive</b> sequence <b>bus</b> voltage. When PMU present {{at one end of the}} faulted line fails, the PMU at the other end of fault line will still record the presence of negative sequence voltages and will have lower bus voltage than the other buses in the system. Hence, the loss or damage of a PMU does not jeopardize the power system, which is an important feature. The proposed fault location algorithm utilizes PMU measurements from both ends of the faulted line and is shown to be more accurate than other impedance-based techniques. These features are additional advantages for PMU placement at all the buses in the network.|$|R

Exploiting fine-granularity transit GPS data, this research proposes a novel method to estimate travel-time percentiles and confidence intervals. Novel transit reliability measures based on travel-time percentiles are proposed to identify and rank low-performance hotspots; the proposed reliability measures can be utilized to distinguish peak-hour low performance from whole-day low performance. As a case study, the methodology is applied to a bus transit corridor in Portland, Oregon.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 20 th Annual South African Transport Conference 16 - 20 July 2001 "Meeting the transport challenges in Southern Africa", CSIR International Convention Centre, Pretoria, South Africa. ABSTRACT: The advent of low floor bus technology has raised {{the profile of the}} bus mode of public transport throughout the developed world. The fact that people no longer have to negotiate steps when boarding and alighting makes getting on and off the bus easier and quicker for all passengers. It also makes it possible for persons with disabilities to use the mainstream public transport service and since it is accessible to more people, there is the potential for more off-peak trips to be made. Shorter dwell time at stops raises the productivity of staff and equipment and can also lead to a reduction in harmful exhaust emissions. User response to the introduction of low floor buses is overwhelmingly <b>positive</b> and <b>bus</b> services that use these vehicles have the potential to effectively compete with the private car for patronage from non-captive public transport users. Low floor buses are part of an end-to-end service delivery chain,which also includes infrastructure, the ticketing system, information and marketing, driver training as well as traffic management and enforcement. Higher initial capital cost of new buses is offset by higher productivity and lower lifecycle costs. The use of low floor buses has become the norm in the developed world. A demonstration project undertaken in Cape Town has shown that low floor buses can be deployed in South African cities with the same measure of success experienced elsewhere in the world.

40|$|Objective: Our {{objective}} was to study the accuracy of emergency physician (EP) performed bedside ultrasonography (BUS) in patients with suspected anterior talofibular ligament (ATFL) injury. Materials and Methods: After a 6 -h training program, from January to December 2011, an EP used BUS to prospectively evaluate patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with suspected ATFL injury. Then, patients underwent ankle X-ray and Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging. Outcome was determined by official radiology reports of the MR imaging. BUS and MR imaging results were compared using Chi-square testing. Results: Of the 65 enrolled patients, 30 patients were <b>BUS</b> <b>positive.</b> Of these, MR imaging results agreed with the BUS findings in 30 patients. In 35 cases, BUS was negative, and 33 of these were corroborated by MR imaging. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and negative likelihood ratio for BUS were 93. 8 %, 100 %, 100 %, 94. 3 %, and 0. 06 %, respectively. The diagnostic accuracy of BUS was not statistically different from MR imaging (K = 0. 938, P = 0. 001). Conclusion: BUS for the diagnosis of ATFL injury is another application of BUS in the ED.

40|$|The Shared/Common bus {{operation}} of AC drives is becoming popular in many industrial applications due to it's advantages such as cost reduction, reduced space requirements, and improved reliability. Depending {{on the application}} requirements, there are presently two methods to interconnect DC buses of AC drives; Shared-bus and common-bus. Very little or no {{work has been done}} in analyzing the use of such system configurations in industrial applications. In a shared-bus configuration, complete drive units are connected through dc bus fuses to form a common bus. These schemes require individual devices for protection and control, and still may cause bus fuse failures due to poor coordination among each drive's DC bus precharge circuits consisting of different converter front ends, such as diode and SCR. During the normal motoring {{operation of}} such systems, the proper load sharing of input converters must also be ensured, not to cause any device failures or nuisance tripping by exceeding the front end converter ratings. This may also require additional hardware between <b>positive</b> and negative <b>busses</b> depending upon the precharge configurations. The common bus drive systems used in a coordinated system can also be beneficial to user by using regenerative energy of larger drives to supply the other small drives which are motoring. The reliability of such operations must be ensured by analyzing the system and properly selecting the bus fuse sizes. The other version of common bus configuration is the concept of one large converter supplying many inverters {{to reduce the number of}} supporting components.

40|$|The Massachusetts Bay Transit Agency (MBTA) has {{the stated}} service {{objectives}} of customer service excellence, accessibility, reliability, and state-of-the-art technology. Over {{the last few}} years, the MBTA has been concerned about a possible decline in bus service quality. In response, the MBTA launched the Key Bus Route Initiative (KBRI) program in 2009. Funded entirely by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, the program is intended to improve bus service reliability on six key bus routes in the Boston area. The program uses an array of new initiatives to achieve this goal. In September 2009, our team of four students in the Master of Engineering Program was asked to provide an independent impact analysis of the KBRI program. In response, we worked to analyze KBRI as well as expand {{the scope of the}} study to answer the two-part question of how to best improve bus service performance with limited resources and how to best use existing technology to strategically plan for future performance improvements. To this end, performance metrics were developed, which focus on customer's perception of both bus service efficiency and reliability. These metrics and the methodology provide a short term tool to analyze KBRI, but also a strategic framework for continuous improvement in overall MBTA bus service. This report demonstrates that additional resources deployed on KBRI selected routes had considerable <b>positive</b> impacts on <b>bus</b> service performance. As a result of the KBRI initiatives, MBTA customers riding these routes saved a total wait time of 56 hours per day in the AM and PM peak travel periods. In addition to demonstrating how these results were achieved, this report provides further in-depth analysis of MBTA bus service performance. Several cases are shown where performance was improved without adding additional resources. For that reason, we provide general schedule related findings, which are summarized as recommendations for future efficient schedule adjustments on other MBTA routes. Additionally, our analysis has shown that tremendous potential exists for expanded use of automated data collection systems at the MBTA. By linking several systems, which to this point have not interfaced with one another, we provide to the MBTA a framework for how to use these existing technologies to strategically plan for future performance improvements. by Yann Krysinski [...] .

40|$|Transit {{service is}} a for-hire, shared urban {{passenger}} transportation service that is fixed-route and scheduled. The study of the economics of transit systems (especially U. S. public transit systems and U. K. public transport) {{has been responsible for}} many developments in transport economics, including advances in demand forecasting, cost modeling, pricing policy, regulatory studies and appraisal techniques. It has attracted the attention of Nobel laureates such as Robert Fogel, Daniel McFadden and William Vickrey. The developments have only periodically been brought together, typically in textbooks such as those of Nash (1982) and Berechman (1993) or in best practice guides such as those produced by TRL in the U. K. and TRB in the U. S. ([Balcombe et al., 2004] and [TRB, 2005]). This peer-reviewed issue advances the transit economics literature by its papers written by some of the world's leading academic researchers in transit economics. The issue begins with Ken Gwilliam's review of the evolution of transit economics. As well as illustrating the depth and breadth of the extant literature, this paper shows that some issues – such as the analysis of cost and demand parameters – are perennial, with development mostly in the mathematical sophistication of the analytical techniques employed, while others – such as issues of ownership and competitive form – reflect wider trends in economic thinking. In addition, some issues – such as the relationship between transit and development – are universal, while others – such as the role of small vehicles and the informal sector- impact mostly on developing countries. Many of these topics are explored in subsequent papers in this issue, albeit largely from a developed country perspective. The overall conclusion – that transit is critical to the achievement {{of a wide range of}} social, economic and environmental objectives and therefore needs appropriate institutions to ensure its integration with the strategic management of the rest of urban development policy – is also supported by a number of papers in this issue. With respect to developments in demand analysis, David Hensher presents an error component, mixed logit model that can account for – between-alternative error structures, scale differences between revealed preference and stated preference data sets, unobserved preference heterogeneity and state or reference dependency. This model is compared with the nested logit models for which revealed and stated preference data sets are choice-based weighted for pooling. The error component, mixed logit and the nested logit models are used to investigate individual preference choices for bus, train and car commuting trips. The empirical results suggest that nested logit models are incapable of accounting for the potential correlation induced through repeated observations in pooled preference data sets. Further, the nested logit model does not recognize the impact of heterogeneity on choice outcomes. Unlike the nested logit model, the error component, mixed logit model can account for scale differences among multiple data sets. This suggests that the error component, mixed logit model should replace the nested logit model as the state-of-the-art tool in the analysis of transit choices. Kjell Jansson, Harald Lang and Dan Mattsson investigate optimal economic interventions in scheduled public transport. Passengers for a given origin–destination pair are assumed to be homogenous (as much as possible) with respect to travel time valuation. Given passenger demand for various time periods, the public transport firm is assumed to reach decisions regarding inputs and prices well ahead of their use and implementation. Further, the generalized cost for a passenger trip consists of a component that is common to all passengers and a passenger-specific component. In utilizing these assumptions Jansson et al. investigate the relationships between optimal price, frequency of service and public transport firm size under welfare and profit maximization. They conclude, unsurprisingly, that a monopoly profit maximizing public transport firm has too few passengers and too low a service frequency from a welfare maximization point of view. However, a price subsidy formula can result in the transport operator choosing a welfare optimal price, frequency of service and public transport firm size. Alternatively, for profit maximizing transport firms under competition, a tax per departure can lead to outcomes closer to welfare optimum, by preventing excess supply. This suggests that financial interventions by governments in public transport markets need to be re-thought. Odd Larsen and Øyvind Sunde also undertake a largely theoretical study to re-assess the role of waiting time and information in transit service. They find that for real-life networks determination of optimal waiting times, onboard times, transfers and even walking time becomes rather complicated. The reason is that several route and path options may be available for a given transit trip – the so called ‘common lines’ problem. In the authors' view the assumptions used in most current transit assignment models are unrealistic with respect to system characteristics and traveler behavior – not least of which when it comes to the issue of information available to transit users and how this information is used. Most transit systems, at least in developed countries, are reasonably reliable and timetable information is frequently available at transit stops. Experienced transit users may even have information that surpasses the information provided by timetables or displays at transit stops. However, at the same time transit users are not a homogeneous group with respect to preferences and information. Therefore, a new transit assignment principle is proposed that is based on a weighted logit model specification that embeds an accurate description of the routes with respect to headways and riding times, assuming that timetable information is available. The specification allows for a trade-off between riding time and waiting time. Simple formulas for route probabilities and expected waiting times are derived. The specification also provides a solution for three important issues: The relevant choice set, the formulation and scaling of “utilities” and the estimation of average waiting time. Tests suggest that the specification is robust and produces results that are realistic and could provide an improved algorithm for transit assignment. Moving on to the topics of productivity and cost efficiency, Borger, Kerstens and Staat study problems commonly encountered in efficiency studies that use non-parametric Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). These problems include – the inability to draw conclusions about the statistical properties of the efficiency estimators, the inability of small samples to adequately represent technology thus resulting in biased estimates of efficiency, and the difficulty of testing relevant economic hypotheses. To overcome these problems they employ recent developments in the application of bootstrap techniques in non-parametric frontier analysis and apply them to Norwegian transit data. More specifically, they use a selection of the most recently developed techniques for estimating non-parametric convex (DEA) cost frontiers for transit systems to show their usefulness in testing characteristics of transit cost structures, and to derive cost efficiency scores. The authors adopt a four-stage approach. The first derives bootstrap cost efficiency measures, the second uses bootstrap techniques to test for constant returns to scale, the third relates cost efficiency to firm characteristics in a two-stage bootstrap procedure similar to that found in Simar and Wilson (2007), and the fourth applies a Monte Carlo simulation technique as found in Zhang and Bartels (1998) to compare the results in two samples of different sizes, and to alleviate the sample size problem. The paper thus brings together some of the most recent developments in bootstrap DEA techniques. The findings include a substantial bias (as much as 25 %) in the parametric efficiency measures, a rejection of constant returns to scale and an identification of only one covariate of cost efficiency. The Monte Carlo simulation results show that the efficiency scores of Norwegian and French transit systems were similar under variable returns to scale but diverged considerably under constant returns to scale. Johan Holmgren, Jan Owen Jansson and Anders Ljungberg bring together demand and cost issues by addressing the following questions: Is local public transport under the threat of extermination in medium-sized cities and smaller towns? If so, what can be done to elevate this threat? They investigate these questions via a case study of the Swedish town of Linkoping that has a population of 140, 000 citizens and where bus transport is the only mode of local public transport. Using bus trips per capita from 1946 to 2006 as the dependent variable in an empirical model, Holmgren et al. found negative effects of fare and car ownership on ridership, but <b>positive</b> effects from <b>bus</b> vehicle-kilometers, female labor force participation and the proportion of people living in the outer suburbs. The steady increase in female car ownership, with the increase in the number of two-car households, has been the main cause of the decline in total bus trips in Linkoping over the years. The authors conclude that the declining ridership trend in Linkoping can be reversed by not charging fares for off-peak service, regarding local bus services as merit goods and providing a level of service above the basic minimum to the extent that the incremental benefits of the service exceed its incremental costs. John Preston also brings together transit demand and cost by developing simulation models to analyze competition in the rail and bus transit sectors in the U. K. and Sweden. For U. K. rail, he|$|R
