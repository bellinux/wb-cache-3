25|$|When done in high productivity, <b>press</b> <b>forging</b> is more {{economical}} than hammer forging. The operation also creates closer tolerances. In hammer forging {{a lot of}} the work is absorbed by the machinery; when in <b>press</b> <b>forging,</b> the greater percentage of work is used in the work piece. Another advantage is that the operation can be used to create any size part because there is no limit {{to the size of the}} <b>press</b> <b>forging</b> machine. New <b>press</b> <b>forging</b> techniques have been able to create a higher degree of mechanical and orientation integrity.

25|$|<b>Press</b> <b>forging</b> {{can be used}} {{to perform}} all types of forging, {{including}} open-die and impression-die forging.

25|$|The main {{advantage}} of <b>press</b> <b>forging,</b> {{as compared to}} drop-hammer forging, {{is its ability to}} deform the complete workpiece. Drop-hammer forging usually only deforms the surfaces of the work piece in contact with the hammer and anvil; the interior of the workpiece will stay relatively undeformed. Another advantage to the process includes the knowledge of the new part's strain rate. By controlling the compression rate of the <b>press</b> <b>forging</b> operation, the internal strain can be controlled.|$|E
25|$|A forging press, {{often just}} called a press, {{is used for}} <b>press</b> <b>forging.</b> There are two main types: {{mechanical}} and hydraulic presses. Mechanical presses function by using cams, cranks and/or toggles to produce a preset (a predetermined force at a certain location in the stroke) and reproducible stroke. Due {{to the nature of}} this type of system, different forces are available at different stroke positions. Mechanical presses are faster than their hydraulic counterparts (up to 50 strokes per minute). Their capacities range from 3 to 160 MN (300 to 18,000 short tons-force). Hydraulic presses use fluid pressure and a piston to generate force. The advantages of a hydraulic press over a mechanical press are its flexibility and greater capacity. The disadvantages include a slower, larger, and costlier machine to operate.|$|E

50|$|Magnesium alloys harden rapidly {{with any}} type of cold work, and {{therefore}} cannot be extensively cold formed without repeated annealing. Sharp bending, spinning, or drawing must be done at about 500 to 600 F, although gentle bending around large radii can be done cold. Slow forming gives better results than rapid shaping. <b>Press</b> <b>forging</b> is preferred to hammer forging, because the press allows greater time for metal flow. The plastic forging range is 500 to 800 F. Metal worked outside this range is easily broken.|$|E
