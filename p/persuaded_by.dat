50|$|In 2015, Halstrøm and Galle {{picked up}} on {{constitutive}} rhetoric {{within the field of}} design studies. They explained how it may provide useful concepts for analysing designed artefacts.

5|$|His {{frustration}} {{turned to}} depression, and in 1971 Drake was <b>persuaded</b> <b>by</b> {{his family to}} visit a psychiatrist at St Thomas's Hospital, London.

50|$|David Morley in The Guardian commented:Poetry <b>persuades</b> <b>by</b> the {{precision}} of its language, and this necessary exactness is carefully and coldly won over years of drafting and redrafting. Jane Draycott's first collection, Prince Rupert's Drop, was well received and rightly so. Her work had a patient intelligence of practice, and concision of address, not only in every poem in that book but in the very philosophy of perception informing her poetics.|$|R
5000|$|Most {{cultures}} {{agree that}} the purpose of criminal law is to control deviancy—the Chinese traditionally have sought to do so through peer groups rather than through the courts. This practice continued after 1949. Ideally, peers helped the deviant through criticism or shuofu (<b>persuading</b> <b>by</b> talking). The stress was on education and rehabilitation, a policy linked to the Confucian and Maoist [...] that, with patience and persuasion, a person can be reformed.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{introduce}} {{an approach}} to digital persuasive technology. In this approach, computing machines are given the power to <b>persuade</b> <b>by</b> generating what we call illusory arguments. These arguments derive their power in significant part by exploiting the empirical fact that humans succumb to cognitive illusions. The persuasion technology we present {{can be used for}} weal or woe, but at least for now, we approach the subject purely as AI engineers, not ethicists. ...|$|R

Vsevolod, who had {{previously}} fought against him, was appointed Prince of Chernigov and thus heir to the Kievan throne, explaining perhaps Vsevolod's lack of opposition. The Poles were <b>persuaded</b> <b>by</b> the papacy to give Izyaslav assistance recovering his kingdom, and on July 15, 1077, Izyaslav re-entered Kiev.|$|E

5000|$|During this period, {{influential}} {{members of}} the Scottish court were paid pensions from the Treasury of England, presumably for influence over James, the heir presumptive of the English throne.

5000|$|A fallacy {{is the use}} of invalid or {{otherwise}} faulty reasoning, or [...] "wrong moves" [...] in the construction of an argument. A fallacious argument may be deceptive by appearing to be better than it really is.

Lawyers acknowledge that the extent to which an argument is sound or unsound depends on {{the context in which the}} argument is made.|$|R

5|$|The {{following}} year, Henry prepared {{an invasion}} of Deheubarth. Rhys made plans to resist, but was <b>persuaded</b> <b>by</b> his council to meet the king to discuss peace terms.

5|$|Allardyce {{was offered}} the chance to join Tranmere Rovers, but instead joined Preston North End after being <b>persuaded</b> <b>by</b> manager John McGrath, who promised to make Allardyce the {{backbone}} of his team.

5|$|Although heavily outnumbered, the Greek Allies were <b>persuaded</b> <b>by</b> the Athenian general Themistocles {{to bring}} the Persian fleet to battle again, {{in the hope that}} a victory would prevent naval {{operations}} against the Peloponnese. The Persian king Xerxes was also eager for a decisive battle. As a result of subterfuge on the part of Themistocles, the Persian navy rowed into the Straits of Salamis and tried to block both entrances. In the cramped conditions of the Straits, the great Persian numbers were an active hindrance, as ships struggled to maneuver and became disorganized. Seizing the opportunity, the Greek fleet formed in line and scored a decisive victory.|$|E

5|$|As he {{was unable}} to travel during 1916, Kropotkin found himself in {{frequent}} correspondence with others, including Jean Grave, who visited Kropotkin from France with his wife. Together, they discussed the war and Kropotkin's firm support for it. At Kropotkin's suggestion {{that he would like to}} have been a combatant were he younger, Grave suggested publishing a document urging anarchists to support the war effort on the side of the Allied Powers. Initially hesitant, due to his personal inability to sign up for active duty, Kropotkin was eventually <b>persuaded</b> <b>by</b> Grave.|$|E
5|$|By 1943, the {{war effort}} had a devastating effect on many rosters. The Red Wings lost nine players and the Maple Leafs lost six to the military.

Young phenom Maurice Richard tried to enlist, but was turned down due to his medical history.

The filmmakers were initially reluctant about filming in Mississippi; they expressed interest in filming in Forsyth County, Georgia before being <b>persuaded</b> <b>by</b> John Horne, head of the Mississippi's film commission. Parker also met with Mississippi governor Ray Mabus, who voiced his support of the film's production.|$|E
