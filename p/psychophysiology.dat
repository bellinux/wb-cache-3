Prior to his arrival a laboratory was constructed at the clinic so that Burckhardt could continue his research into neuroanatomy and <b>psychophysiology.</b> In February 1884 he presented at the Préfargier asylum his findings on the heredity and the surface configuration of the brain. He continued to publish on psychiatric and neurological topics such as cerebral vascular movements, brain tumours and optic chiasm, traumatic hysteria, and writing disorders.|$|E

The operator manipulates the tone arm to keep the needle {{near the center of}} the dial so its motion is easily observed. A simple E-meter powered by direct current, such as that used by the Scientologists and the like, displays several kinds of electrodermal activity (EDA) on the one dial without distinction, including changes in conductance, resistance, and bioelectric potential. Researchers in <b>psychophysiology</b> are also exploring admittance and impedance aspects of EDA that can be observed only with alternating current.|$|E

The ultimate aim is to develop an ″affective brain computer interface″ with which patients suffering from language disorders, due to neurological diseases such aphasia, autism, and dementia, can express their emotions via EEG without using facial expressions, gestures or other forms of muscular activity. Professor Maytesian has successfully promoted this project at universities in Belarus, Armenia and Russia (Moscow).|$|E
60|$|If {{we wish to}} {{pass from}} the law of habit, stated as a {{tendency}} or average, to something more precise and invariable, we seem driven to the nervous system. We {{can more or less}} guess how an occurrence produces a change in the brain, and how its repetition gradually produces something analogous to the channel of a river, along which currents flow more easily than in neighbouring paths. We can perceive that in this way, if we had more knowledge, the tendency to habit through repetition might be replaced by a precise account of the effect of each occurrence in bringing about a modification of the sort from which habit would ultimately result. It is such considerations that make students of <b>psychophysiology</b> materialistic in their methods, whatever they may be in their metaphysics. There are, of course, exceptions, such as Professor J. S. Haldane,* who maintains that it is theoretically impossible to obtain physiological explanations of psychical phenomena, or physical explanations of physiological phenomena. But I think the bulk of expert opinion, in practice, is on the other side.|$|E
