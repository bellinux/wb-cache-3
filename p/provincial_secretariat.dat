40|$|The {{research}} aimed 			at {{studying the}} implementation of Devolution Plan in education 			sector in Pakistan and identifying variations across the provinces 			and districts. The research study was descriptive in nature for 			which a survey was conducted through questionnaires and data 			collected from different stake-holders. The objectives of the study 			were: To identify {{nature and extent of}} decentralization in education 			sector at provincial and district level, to find out the variations 			in the nature of decentralization and the devolution of decision 			making across the provinces and across districts within a single 			province and identify the problems/difficulties in the 			implementation of the process and achievement of the laid down 			objectives. The population of study comprised all Executive District 			Officers (Education), District Officers (Secondary Education), Heads 			of Higher Secondary Schools and Subject Specialists and Heads of 			Secondary and Secondary School Teachers in Balochistan Province. The 			sample of the study comprised, 87 EDOs and DOs, 348 Heads of higher 			secondary and secondary schools and 870 subject specialists and SST 			of different 87 districts of four provinces of Pakistan. For the 			purpose of the data collection, four questionnaires were prepared in 			consultation with the Supervisor and other experts in the field. The 			questionnaires were improved by 14 experts in the field of education 			particularly in educational planning and management. These 			questionnaires were, later on, pilot-tested on five percent of the 			population of four provinces not included in the sample. After 			getting feedback and comments/views of pilot testing/launching, the 			questionnaires were revised and improved. For the purpose of the 			data collection, 71 persons were identified and imparted training to 			act as research assistants in all the four provinces of Pakistan. 			For this purpose, their qualification, experience and affiliation 			with AIOU and the field of research were kept in view. 			The Vice-Chancellor of AIOU issued a D.

Lack of adequate resources, manpower, capacity building and teacher 			training was also common problem. 			The study concluded that the political interference in the 			educational affairs at district level needs to be looked into by the 			provincial and federal governments.

40|$|Integrative {{taxonomy}} {{tests the}} validity of taxa using methods additional to traditional morphology. The existence of two different morphotypes in specimens identified as Chrysotoxum vernale Loew (Diptera: Syrphidae) prompted their taxonomic study using an integrative approach that included morphology, wing and male-surstylus geometric morphometrics, genetic and ecological analyses. As a result, a new species is recognised, Chrysotoxum montanum Nedeljković & Vujić sp. nov., and C. vernale is re-defined. A lectotype and paralectotypes are designated for C. vernale to stabilize this concept. An additional species, Chrysotoxum orthostylum Vujić sp. nov., with distinctive male genitalia is also described. The three species share an antenna with the basoflagellomere shorter than the scape plus pedicel and terga with yellow fasciae not reaching the lateral margins. This study confirms the value of integrative approach for resolving species boundaries.

40|$|Abstract. Genetic factors play an {{important}} role, but {{most important of all}} is their interaction with metabolical syndromes, specifically obesity. So far it has been confirmed in certain studies that blood pressure value is connected to age and obesity. The aim of his study was {{to determine whether or not}} there is a relation between body composition and age that affects systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Material and methods: The data from the current research have been collected within the scientific research project titled “Anthropological status and physical activity of the population in Vojvodina”, which was realized by the Faculty of Sports and Physical Education in Novi Sad, financed by the <b>Provincial</b> <b>Secretariat</b> for Science and Technological Development. Based on 102 female participants, aged 20 to 49, from the city of Novi Sad, an assessment of blood pressure and body composition parameterswas conductedusing a digital camera OMRON M 4 - 1 and bioelectric impedance Maltron 920. The relations between the studied variables were examined using Pierson’s correlation analysis and a regression analysis. Results: Based on the gathered multiple correlation coefficients (R) and other parameters (F tests and statistical significance P), it can b...|$|E
40|$|Fruška gora lakes Sot, Bruje and Moharač are {{the lakes}} {{that can be}} used in many ways for sports and {{recreation}} tourism. Nevertheless, the current tourism offer in these lakes is based only on offer for sports fishing. Bearing in mind that Fruška gora National Park, where there are three zones of protection, is of great importance the fact that the second and third zones are, with regard to territorial perspective, areas where it is desirable to develop sports and recreational tourism. Cycling is becoming an increasingly popular form of sports and recreational tourism, so tourism networking of Fruška gora lakes with system of cycle paths would represent only the first step to turn the whole mountain into the European cycle mainstream. In this sense, the aim of this paper is set to map the FJSA cycling paths connected to the system. The field research resulted in the mapping of the terrain. The interviews with experts from the <b>Provincial</b> <b>Secretariat</b> of Environmental Protection, the National Park and the Cycling Association of Vojvodina helped in the SWOT analysis of cycle tourism on Fruška gora lakes...|$|E
40|$|Determination of fungal species by {{traditional}} morphological approach {{can often be}} problematic. In the phylum Basidiomycota, sporocarps of different species can share very similar morphoanatomical characteristics. Using molecular markers and phylogenetic species concept this problem can be reduced. In this study identification of six autochtonous fungal species, collected from several locations in Serbia (Tara, Kopaonik, Stara planina) was done by comparison between morphological and molecular data of fungal species, {{as well as information}} obtained from phylogenetic tree. ITS sequences amplified from 11 specimens of two genera of ph. Basidiomycota: Marasmius and Ganoderma, were compared with ITS sequences from database using basic local alignment search tool (BLAST). Phylogenetic tree was constructed using Neighbor joining method based on differences between analyzed ITS sequences. Our results showed that within genera Marasmius and Ganoderma morphological and molecular determinations are usually in accordance, but for proper species delimitation both approaches should be used.
