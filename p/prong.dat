5|$|To {{satisfy the}} {{prejudice}} <b>prong</b> of Strickland, a defendant who pleads guilty must {{show that there}} is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's deficient performance, he or she would not have plead guilty. In Padilla v. Kentucky (2010), the Court held that counsel's failure to inform an alien pleading guilty of the risk of deportation fell below the objective standard of the performance <b>prong</b> of Strickland and permitted an alien who would not have plead guilty but for such failure to withdraw his guilty plea.|$|E
5|$|Fossils of Dermotherium {{chimaera}} {{come from}} Phetchaburi Province, {{further to the}} north in Thailand. The fossil deposits, located in the Cha <b>Prong</b> pit in a coal mine called Nong Ya Plong, are dated to the Late Oligocene. Other mammals found here include the rodent Fallomus ladakhensis, the rhinoceros Diceratherium sp. cf. D.lamilloquense, the carnivoran Chaprongictis phetchaburiensis, the lipotyphlan Siamosorex debonisi, and a pteropodid bat.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, the ACLU became {{involved}} in a case involving the distribution of child pornography (New York v. Ferber). In an amicus brief, the ACLU argued that child pornography that violates the three <b>prong</b> obscenity test should be outlawed, but that the law in question was overly restrictive because it outlawed artistic displays and otherwise non-obscene material. The court did not adopt the ACLU's position.|$|E
5000|$|Following the playoffs, <b>Pronger</b> {{underwent}} arthroscopic knee surgery. <b>Pronger</b> {{missed the}} first two games of the [...] season. Various other injuries would limit <b>Pronger</b> to just 50 games, marking the first time that <b>Pronger</b> missed significant time since the [...] season, where <b>Pronger</b> missed 77 games. On September 16, 2011, <b>Pronger</b> was named the 18th captain in Philadelphia Flyers history, replacing Mike Richards, traded to the Los Angeles Kings just before the 2011 draft. However, multiple hits resulting in post-concussion syndrome (the last being a collision with Martin Hanzal, who, like <b>Pronger,</b> is 6'6") limited <b>Pronger</b> to 13 games before <b>Pronger</b> was shut down for the season in mid-December, with the post-concussion syndrome placing Pronger's career in jeopardy. <b>Pronger</b> also had problems in his right eye after being struck by the stick of Mikhail Grabovski in October 2011.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} years of his St. Louis career, <b>Pronger</b> played under coach and general manager Mike Keenan who insisted on <b>Pronger</b> {{improving}} his conditioning and reducing his mistakes. Late in his first season, the acquisition of Wayne Gretzky took pressure off of <b>Pronger,</b> which combined with Keenan's practices, allowed <b>Pronger</b> to concentrate on improving his defensive play.|$|R
50|$|On September 28, 2007, <b>Pronger</b> {{was named}} {{the captain of the}} Ducks, {{replacing}} Scott Niedermayer. Although Niedermayer returned to the lineup later in the season, <b>Pronger</b> remained captain until the start of next season when Niedermayer was renamed captain. <b>Pronger</b> retained a role as alternate captain.|$|R
5|$|To {{satisfy the}} {{prejudice}} <b>prong</b> of Strickland, a defendant who rejects the prosecution's plea offer must {{show that there}} is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's deficient performance, the offer would have been accepted by the defendant, not withdrawn by the prosecution, and accepted by the court, and that the sentence actually received exceeded that which would have been received under the plea.|$|E
5|$|US 113 {{continues}} through Showell, where the U.S. Highway crosses Church Branch, Middle Branch, and Birch Branch; these three streams together form Shingle Landing <b>Prong</b> of the St. Martin River, which empties into Isle of Wight Bay, a lagoon {{on the west}} side of Ocean City. Within Showell, the highway parallels Old US 113 (unsigned MD 575B), which is accessed at its south end with a right-in/right-out junction with southbound US 113 and full access via Shingle Landing Road. US113 intersects MD367 (Bishopville Road) at Bishop and has an oblique grade crossing with the rail line, then the route intersects the east end of MD610 (Whaleyville Road). The U.S. Highway crosses Carey Branch, which flows into the Bishopville <b>Prong</b> of the St. Martin River, before it enters Delaware at the Transpeninsular Line, one of the lines surveyed as part of the 18th-century Penn–Calvert boundary dispute.|$|E
5|$|The main German {{attack was}} {{to be made by}} the 50th Reserve Division of the XXIII Reserve Corps, a Prussian {{division}} that had been involved in the Spring Offensive from the outset. It had a few days' rest before the advance was delayed by the Allies at Albert and Dernancourt, and its morale was still high. The right <b>prong</b> of the attack would be made by the 229th Reserve Infantry Regiment (RIR) advancing through the 9th Reserve Division north of Dernancourt against the sector held by the 48th Battalion. The left <b>prong</b> would consist of the 230th RIR, advancing from the area of Morlancourt through Dernancourt against the 47th Battalion and 2nd Tyneside Pioneers. In this sector, I Battalion of the 230th RIR (I/230 RIR) would cross the Ancre and seize Dernancourt, then III/230 RIR would assault the embankment. After the capture of the embankment, the assaulting troops would push northwest over the Albert–Amiens road, then advance west towards Amiens. II/230 RIR was to follow up the assault of III/230 RIR. Both regimental commanders considered that the plan could only succeed if the embankment was weakly held, and made representations to their brigade commander, but to no avail. The German artillery preparation was to last only 45 minutes.|$|E
50|$|Today, many clothes-pegs (also clothespins) are {{manufactured}} very cheaply by creating two interlocking plastic or wooden <b>prongs,</b> in between {{which is often}} wedged a small spring. This design was invented by David M. Smith of Springfield, Vermont, in 1853.By a lever action, when the two <b>prongs</b> are pinched {{at the top of}} the peg, the <b>prongs</b> open up, and when released, the spring draws the two <b>prongs</b> shut, creating the action necessary for gripping.|$|R

5|$|Burton's death left Metallica's {{future in}} doubt. The three {{remaining}} members decided Burton would {{want them to}} carry on, and with the Burton family's blessings the band sought a replacement. Roughly 40 people, including Hammett's childhood friend, Les Claypool of Primus, Troy Gregory of <b>Prong,</b> and Jason Newsted, formerly of Flotsam and Jetsam, auditioned for the band. Newsted learned Metallica's entire set list; after the audition Metallica invited him to Tommy's Joynt in San Francisco. Hetfield, Ulrich, and Hammett decided on Newsted as Burton's replacement; Newsted's first live performance with Metallica was at the Country Club in Reseda, California. The members initiated Newsted by tricking him into eating a ball of wasabi.|$|E
5|$|In late April, the {{division}} loaded onto troop trains {{for a trip}} to the Sudetenland of Czechoslovakia {{along with the rest of}} the 31st Army, which was transferring to the 1st Ukrainian Front for the final push to Prague. It disembarked in Saxony on the night of May 6. The army's role was as a flank guard on the left of the 1st Ukrainian Front, protecting the northern <b>prong</b> of the attack on the Czech capital. Advancing against little organized resistance, the 331st was on the outskirts of the town of Schlewitz when it got word of the German surrender.|$|E
5|$|The German {{plans for}} the {{invasion}} of Poland were conceived under the codename Fall Weiss (Case White). This operation called for simultaneous attacks on Poland from three directions, the north, {{the west and the}} south, beginning at 04:45 on the early morning of 1 September 1939. On this morning Helmut Lent, with Kubisch as his wireless operator and rear gunner, escorted a formation of Heinkel 111 bombers of I. and III./Kampfgeschwader 4 (KG4) attacking the airfields at Krakow in support of the southern <b>prong</b> of the German attack. At 16:30 on 2 September 1939, {{the second day of the}} German attack, Lent took off in the direction of Łódź and claimed his first aerial-victory of the war, shooting down a PZL P.11.|$|E

5|$|The Lemon {{test has}} been criticized by justices and legal scholars, but it remains the {{predominant}} {{means by which the}} Court enforces the Establishment Clause. In Agostini v. Felton (1997), the entanglement <b>prong</b> of the Lemon test was demoted to simply being a factor in determining the effect of the challenged statute or practice. In Zelman v. Simmons-Harris (2002), the opinion of the Court considered secular purpose and the absence of primary effect; a concurring opinion saw both cases as having treated entanglement as part of the primary purpose test. Further tests, such as the endorsement test and coercion test, have been developed to determine whether a government action violated the Establishment Clause.|$|E
5|$|The element was {{probably}} {{named by the}} alchemist Paracelsus after the German word Zinke (<b>prong,</b> tooth). German chemist Andreas Sigismund Marggraf is credited with discovering pure metallic zinc in 1746. Work by Luigi Galvani and Alessandro Volta uncovered the electrochemical properties of zinc by 1800. Corrosion-resistant zinc plating of iron (hot-dip galvanizing) is the major application for zinc. Other applications are in electrical batteries, small non-structural castings, and alloys such as brass. A variety of zinc compounds are commonly used, such as zinc carbonate and zinc gluconate (as dietary supplements), zinc chloride (in deodorants), zinc pyrithione (anti-dandruff shampoos), zinc sulfide (in luminescent paints), and zinc methyl or zinc diethyl in the organic laboratory.|$|E
5|$|After {{securing}} {{the area around}} Arleux {{at the end of}} April, the British determined to launch another attack east from Monchy to try to break through the Boiry Riegel and reach the Wotanstellung, a major German defensive fortification. This was scheduled to coincide with the Australian attack at Bullecourt to present the Germans with a two–pronged assault. British commanders hoped that success in this venture would force the Germans to retreat further to the east. With this objective in mind, the British launched another attack near the Scarpe on 3 May. However, neither <b>prong</b> was able to make any significant advances and the attack was called off the following day after incurring heavy casualties. Although this battle was a failure, the British learned important lessons about the need for close liaison between tanks, infantry and artillery, which they would use in the Battle of Cambrai, 1917.|$|E

5000|$|On March 12, 2008, <b>Pronger</b> was {{involved}} in an incident with Vancouver's Ryan Kesler. <b>Pronger,</b> after being tangled up with Kesler behind the Anaheim blue line, stomped unnecessarily on Kesler's leg. Kesler was not injured, and upon initial review the NHL did not suspend <b>Pronger.</b> However, upon new video evidence, which provided a better angle, the league once again reviewed the incident and gave <b>Pronger</b> an 8-game suspension. The suspension was criticized by some as insufficient, as Chris Simon had received a 30-game suspension for a stomp the previous year, with some suggesting that the league gave preferential treatment towards <b>Pronger</b> as a league MVP and an [...] "ambassador for the game". He returned to the ice April 6 against the Phoenix Coyotes in Anaheim's last regular season game of the year.|$|R
5|$|Cladistic {{analyses}} of tyrannosaurid phylogeny often find Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus to be sister taxa, with Daspletosaurus more basal than either. A {{close relationship between}} Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus is supported by numerous skull features, including the pattern of sutures between certain bones, {{the presence of a}} crescent-shaped crest on the postorbital bone behind each eye, and a very deep maxilla with a noticeable downward curve on the lower edge, among others. An alternative hypothesis was presented in a 2003 study by Phil Currie and colleagues, which found weak support for Daspletosaurus as a basal member of a clade also including Tarbosaurus and Alioramus, both from Asia, based on the absence of a bony <b>prong</b> connecting the nasal and lacrimal bones. Alioramus was found to be the closest relative of Tarbosaurus in this study, based on a similar pattern of stress distribution in the skull.|$|E
5|$|Tarbosaurus and Alioramus shared several skull features, {{including}} a locking mechanism {{in the lower}} jaw between the dentary and angular bones, and both lacked the <b>prong</b> of the nasal bones which connected to the lacrimal bones in all other tyrannosaurids except adult Daspletosaurus. The two genera may be closely related, representing an Asian branch of the Tyrannosauridae. Some specimens of Tarbosaurus have a row of bumps on the nasal bones like those of Alioramus, although much lower. The long and low shape of the only known Alioramus remotus skull indicated that it was immature when it died and might even have been a juvenile Tarbosaurus, which {{lived in the same}} time and place. The more prominent nasal crests and much higher tooth count of Alioramus, however, suggested it was a separate taxon, even if it is known only from juvenile remains, confirmed by the discovery of A. altai. Specimens identified as immature Tarbosaurus have the same tooth count as adults.|$|E
5|$|When Yugoslavia {{was drawn}} into the war by the German-led Axis {{invasion}} on 6 April 1941, Beograd and Zagreb were allocated to the 1st Torpedo Division at the Bay of Kotor along with Dubrovnik, but Ljubljana was still under repair at Šibenik. On 9 April, Beograd and other vessels were tasked with supporting {{an attack on the}} Italian enclave of Zara on the Dalmatian coast, but the naval <b>prong</b> of the attack was aborted when Beograd suffered engine damage from near misses by Italian aircraft. She returned to the Bay of Kotor for repairs. Beograd and Ljubljana were captured in port by Italian forces on 17 April, but on the same day, two of Zagrebs officers scuttled her to prevent her capture, and were killed by the resulting explosions.|$|E
