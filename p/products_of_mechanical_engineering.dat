40|$|Testing new {{automotive}} driver-assistance-systems {{is already}} diffi-cult, {{because they are}} not a <b>product</b> <b>of</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>engineering</b> but <b>of</b> psychological research. In addition with new technical interfaces, such as augmented reality (AR), the evaluation of the system becomes more difficult. As the technical part of Systems is not yet sufficiently engineered and serviceable, especially the development of the inter-face metaphor must be tested with other means. This paper reflects about the current and upcoming methods of usability testing for AR-Systems in cars. The technical and psychological engineering goes hand-in-hand and step-by-step, therefore testing, even with todays approaches, is a crucial part of further solutions...|$|R
40|$|The {{globalization}} {{of the world}} economy has forced many enterprises to merge and/or to acquire enterprises worldwide. in the next phase of this development, rationalization calls for specialization of functions such as product development and production in one or a few sites, if not being outsourced to external suppliers. These new divisions of the “virtual” enterprise have to collaborate within internal and external networks, where efficient and effective transportation, handling and storing of intermediary and final products is a must. In order to obtain this objective, an integration concept of the design <b>of</b> <b>product</b> and packaging has been proposed by Bjärnemo et al. [1]. The acceptance of the need for such a concept in industry has been established by Bramkiev [2]. In this paper an industrially implementable, integrated procedure model for the concurrent design <b>of</b> <b>product</b> and packaging, confined to the <b>product</b> area <b>of</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>engineering,</b> is presented...|$|R
