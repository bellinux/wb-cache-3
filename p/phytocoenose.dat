40|$|The {{present study}} showed the {{ecological}} differentiation of <b>phytocoenoses</b> dominated either by Myriophyllum alterniflorum or by Littorella uniflora, which in Poland are classified within the Myriophylletum alterniflori or Myriophyllo-Littorelletum association. The properties which best differentiated {{the waters of}} the above types of <b>phytocoenoses</b> were calcium and factors associated with the carbonate complex (pH, electrolytic conductivity, total and carbonate hardness), and pH in the case of substrates. The most distinct differences in the habitats were found between the <b>phytocoenoses</b> dominated by L. uniflora from the Pomeranian Lobelia lakes and those dominated by M. alterniflorum from the Łęczna-Włodawa Lake District, in which other species from the Littorelletea uniflorae class were absent. The L. uniflora <b>phytocoenoses</b> are associated with soft waters poor in Ca 2 + and with the lowest values of pH, electrolytic conductivity, dissolved organic matter (COD-KMnO 4) and dissolved SiO 2. The substrates they inhabit are mineral and more acidic. By contrast, the values of the above-mentioned properties are considerably higher {{in the case of the}} <b>phytocoenoses</b> from the Łęczna-Włodawa Lake District. The habitats of the M. alterniflorum <b>phytocoenoses</b> from the Pomeranian Lobelia lakes occupy an intermediate position and are more similar to those of M. alterniflorum from the Łęczna-Włodawa Lake District. The results obtained in this study suggest that the <b>phytocoenoses</b> of L. uniflora and M. alterniflorum should not be included in the same association. Further studies are, therefore, necessary to resolve this problem. The comparative analysis of the present ecological findings and data obtained from other regions of Europe show that in Poland the <b>phytocoenoses</b> dominated either by L. uniflora or by M. alterniflorum, in which the contribution of Littorelletea uniflorae species is appreciable, are clearly associated with soft waters and their habitats are representative of the Littorelletea uniflorae class. The massive development of the <b>phytocoenoses</b> with both L. uniflora and M. alterniflorum in the Lobelia lakes is not always indicative of the increase in water hardness and euthrophication of waters typical of the communities of the Littorelletea uniflorae class. The M. alterniflorum dominated <b>phytocoenoses</b> without other Littorelletea species could be good indicators of the above processes taking place in such water ecosystems...|$|R

The comparison of habitat properties of these three types of <b>phytocoenoses</b> with those of Nuphar lutea common in the area under study was also performed. It was demonstrated that the plant communities studied were ecologically distinct. The habitats of the <b>phytocoenoses</b> of N. pumila differed most significantly {{from those of the}} other <b>phytocoenoses.</b> They often inhabited softer waters poor in Mg 2 +, dissolved SiO 2, but rich in total Fe, PO 4 3 −, NO 3 −, and were associated with acidic substrates containing lower levels of Ca 2 + and Na+, but greater amounts of total Fe and NO 3 −. The differences in the habitats of H. verticillata and N. candida <b>phytocoenoses</b> were most pronounced in the case of four properties of water: Na +, K +, Cl −, and Mg +. Their values were lower in waters of the H. verticillata <b>phytocoenoses.</b> The habitats of all the three types of rare <b>phytocoenoses</b> differed considerably from those of N. lutea.

The properties of water were more important in differentiating the habitats of the <b>phytocoenoses</b> studied than the substrate properties. Due to alkalization and increase in water hardness in the lakes studied the stands of N. pumila are among the most threatened.

40|$|A {{comparative}} analysis of three regional groups of <b>phytocoenoses</b> dominated by Phragmites australis was undertaken {{in order to}} find if they reveal any interregional differentiation in the habitat (water and substratum) conditions and if the differences are followed by floristic composition. A group of 60 phy-tocoenoses studied in mesotrophic and (mostly) eutrophic lakes of midwestern Poland were compared to two groups investigated in moderately nutrient-rich lakes of northeastern Poland (32 <b>phytocoenoses)</b> and nutrient-poor lakes of northern Poland (20 <b>phytocoenoses).</b> Statistical analyses revealed significant habitat differences. Although the groups of <b>phytocoenoses</b> were studied in different regions and different types of water bodies, they occupied habitats poor in bioavailable forms of nutrients in water and organic matter content and sodium in the substratum, which is inconsistent with the general opinion concerning the reed community as indicative for the high trophy level of lakes.

Among 52 <b>phytocoenoses,</b> the participation of bee flora was considerable. Most voluble <b>phytocoenoses</b> represent ruderal and segetal associations (Artemisietea vulgaris, Stellarietea mediae classes - 87 species), meadow and pasture associations (Mollinio-Arrhenatheretea - 56 species), psammophilous and xerothermic grasslands (Festuco - Brometea, Koelerio glauce - Corynophoretea canescensis - 38 species), thermophilous forest edge communities and thickets (Trifolio - Geranietea and Rhamno - Prunetea - 33 species). Significantly fewer melliferous and polleniferous taxons were noticed in mesophilous deciduous forests or thermophilous oak forests - 29 species. Most simple in structure and species richness are associations with Rumex acetosa, Reseda lutea, Linaria vulgaris, Papaver rhoeas, Cirsium arvense, Oenothera biennis, Viola arvensis and Potentilletum anserine or Sisymbrietum altissimi. The communities form patches (15 - 20 m 2) with 80 - 100 % cover of the diagnostic taxon and are of low or medium stability. The most persistent and floristically stable are Tanaceto Artemisietum, Rudbeckio - Solidaginetum, Echio - Melilotetum, Sambucetum nigrae, Rubo fruticosi - Prunetum spinosae and communities with Rosa rugosa, Rubus caesius, Geranium robertianum, Pastinaca sativa, Trifolium medium or Euphorbia cyparissias. The maintenance of the mosaic of <b>phytocoenoses</b> in anthropogenically transformed habitats, including those along railway lines, is of decisive importance for the protection of floristic diversity and adaptation processes of Apoidea...|$|R

Pop et al. 1974), found in the pure European beech forests of the Orăştie river basin, lying in the central-western part of Romania. The characterisation of the association under analysis {{as well as the}} presentation of the synthetic table have been done byselecting the most representative relevées of pure European beech forests belonging to the Orăştie river basin. The <b>phytocoenoses</b> of these beech forests were analysed in terms of physiognomy and floristic composition, life forms spectrum, floristic elements, and ecological indices...|$|R

Popescu 1988) identified in the Orăştie river basin, situated in the central-western part of Romania. The characterisation of the association under analysis {{as well as the}} presentation of the phytosociological table have been done by selecting the most representative relevés performed in the Turkey and Sessile oak forests of the lower and central parts of the Orastie river basin (Culoarul Orăştiei). This paper aims at analysing the <b>phytocoenoses</b> of the association Quercetum petraeae-cerris Soó 1963 in terms of physiognomy and floristic composition, life forms spectrum, floristic elements, and ecological indices...|$|R

After conducting a 70 phytocoenologic relevées on limestones and silicate rocks from the Codru-Moma Mountains there have been {{identified a number of}} five vegetal associations from which only two are examined in this work: Asplenietum trichomanorutae-murariae R. Tx. 1937 and Asplenietum septentrionali-adianti-nigri E. Oberdorfer 1938. The saxicol-sciadophilous <b>phytocoenoses</b> (shady) and sciadophilous-helsciadophilous <b>phytocoenoses</b> (shady-semishady) belonging to groups that we are reffering to were studied in terms of the ecological factors (moisture, temperature and chemical reaction of the soil) and of the distribution of species in the spectrum of life forms and in the spectrum of floristic elements...|$|R
