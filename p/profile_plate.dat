40|$|Axis {{tear drop}} {{fractures}} are infrequent injuries attributed to hyper extension and flexion of neck. In unstable tear drop fractures {{there will be}} posterior displacement of vertebral body, anterior longitudinal ligament disruption and anterior rotation of antero-inferior vertebral body fragment. Most of the unstable tear drop fractures are associated with neurological deficit due to incomplete spinal cord injuries like anterior cord syndrome. We present a case of traumatic unstable C 2 flexion tear drop fracture without neurological deficit. We have treated the patient successfully with anterior cervical plating and tricortical bone grafting after removal of tear drop fragment and discectomy. This patient was mobilized on next day after surgery and neck mobilization started after 3 weeks. The patient in our study was followed up for 6 years and found to have no sequlae related to the injury. Unstable tear drop fracture needs to be fixed irrespective of {{the presence or absence}} of neurological deficit.

40|$|Open {{reduction}} and anatomic reduction can create better function for the temporomandibular joint, compared with closed treatment in mandible fracture surgery. Therefore, the double miniplate fixation technique via mini-retromandibular incision {{was used in}} order to make the most stable fixation when performing subcondylar fracture surgery. Those approaches provide good visualization of the subcondyle from the posterior edge of the ramus, allow the surgeon to work perpendicularly to the fracture, and enable direct fracture management. Understanding the biomechanical load in the fixation of subcondylar fractures is also necessary in order to optimize fixation methods. Therefore, we measured the biomechanical loads of four different plate fixation techniques in the experimental model regarding mandibular subcondylar fractures. It was found that the loads measured in the two-plate fixation group with one dynamic compression plate (DCP) and one adaption plate showed the highest deformation and failure loads among the four fixation groups. The loads measured in the one DCP plate fixation group showed higher deformation and failure loads than the loads measured in the two adaption plate fixation group. Therefore, we conclude that the selection of the high <b>profile</b> <b>plate</b> (DCP) is also important in order to create a stable load in the subcondylar fracture...|$|E
40|$|The {{most stable}} pattern of {{internal}} fixation for mandibular condyle fractures {{is an area}} of ongoing discussion. This study investigates the stability of three patterns of plate fixation using readily available, commercially pure titanium implants. Finite element models of a simulated mandibular condyle fracture were constructed. The completed models were heterogeneous in bone material properties, contained approximately 1. 2 million elements and incorporated simulated jaw adducting musculature. Models were run assuming linear elasticity and isotropic material properties for bone. No human subjects were involved in this investigation. The stability of the simulated condylar fracture reduced with the different implant configurations, and the von Mises stresses of a 1. 5 -mm X-shaped plate, a 1. 5 -mm rectangular plate, and a 1. 5 -mm square plate (all Synthes (Synthes GmbH, Zuchwil, Switzerland) were compared.

30|$|Despite the {{euphoria}} {{of the good}} and very good clinical results {{in addition to the}} lower complication rates of the volar plate system compared to an external fixation technique [24, 25, 26], surgeons must {{keep in mind that the}} use of this implant may cause serious complications: tendon irritation to rupture is a major problem with a rate of 0 to 38  % [8] reported in the current literature. Flexor tendon irritation to rupture is due to very distal plate positioning, whereas extensor problems are the consequence of a screw too long in length [8]. As we had a high incidence of very distal osteoporotic fractures and did not use other implants throughout the duration of this study, we found adequate soft tissue coverage of even the very low <b>profile</b> <b>plate</b> to be important. Although the pronator quadratus muscle might often be insufficient to cover the implant completely, we found it large enough in most cases to cover at least the ulnar parts of the plate to prevent damage to the most radial positioned flexor pollicis longus tendon. The orthopedic and trauma surgeon’s technique of intraoperative observation of the flexor pollicis longus tendon during thumb movement might be the reason for the relatively low incidence of one patient with flexor irritation, even in distal plate application.|$|E
30|$|A direct radial {{approach}} to the radius over the CORA was performed with the superficial branch of the radial nerve visualized and protected. In most cases, a closing wedge osteotomy was performed using the Fragment Fixation System (FFS; Orthofix®) for temporary fixation and a low <b>profile</b> <b>plate</b> (Depuy Synthes® or Medartis®) for definitive fixation. Great care was taken not to damage the distal growth plate of the radius (Fig.  3). From the preoperative planning, four fixator pins (typically 80  mm length with 20  mm thread length (conical blunt-tipped and hydroxyapatite coated, Orthofix®) were placed into the distal ulna through stab incisions. Using special screw and drill guides and with predrilling and cooling, different angles of pin placement with regard to rotation and abduction allowed for pre-emptive correction of the deformity of the ulna (Fig.  4). Meticulous care was taken for good purchase and bicortical penetration of all pins, which was difficult due to previous or simultaneous resection of osteochondromas in the area. The osteotomy was performed using a sharp drill and a chisel whilst preserving the periosteum. The monolateral lengthening fixator was mounted, the acute re-alignment of the ulna was documented, and a test distraction performed (Fig.  3). Wounds were closed using resorbable subcutaneous and skin sutures. A posterior backslab cast with the wrist in neutral position was applied. After a waiting period of 5  days (usually), lengthening was performed following a written protocol (0.25  mm ×  3 per day) until the required length was reached. The fixator was removed under light anaesthesia when callus maturation was documented by standard radiographs (three cortices visible).|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the results of}} "biologic fixation" with a minimally invasive plating technique using a newly designed low profile "Scallop" plate {{in the treatment of}} pilon fractures. DESIGN: Retrospective case series. SETTING: A tertiary referral center. PATIENTS/PARTICIPANTS: Seventeen patients were treated between 1999 and 2001 for a tibial plafond fracture at the Hospital for Special Surgery with a newly designed low-profile plate. Eleven of the fractures (65 %) were high-energy injuries. Two fractures were open. INTERVENTION: Staged surgical treatment with open reduction and fixation of the fibular fracture and application of an external fixator was performed in 12 cases. As soon as the soft tissues and swelling allowed, i. e. skin wrinkling, the articular surface was reconstructed and simply reduced, if necessary through an small incision, and the articular block was fixed to the diaphysis using a medially placed, percutaneously introduced flat scallop plate. In the remaining five cases the operation was performed in one session. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Time to healing and complications including delayed union, non-union, instrument failure, loss of fixation, infection, quality of reduction and number of reoperations were evaluated. Quality of results and outcome were graded using the ankle-hindfoot-scale and a modified rating system. RESULTS: All patients went on to bony union at an average time of 14 weeks. There were no plate failures or loss of fixation/reduction. Two superficial wound-healing problems resolved with local wound care. At an average follow up of 17 months (range 6 - 29 months) eight patients (47 %) had an excellent result; seven (41 %) had a fair result whereas two (12 %) had a poor result. The average ankle-hindfoot-score was 86. 1 (range 61 - 100). Four patients have had the hardware removed {{and one of them is}} awaiting an ankle arthrodesis.

40|$|As the {{oil price}} is {{relative}} high, oil companies continue their quest for oil in new areas where it was supposed impossible earlier. 25 % of the world petroleum reserves {{are assumed to be}} in Arctic areas. In these areas ice contribute to significant engineering challenges. Ice conditions, emergency response, winterization and extreme low temperatures are some of the challenges that have to be address for design and operation purpose. Ice is an interesting material for an engineer. The knowledge of ice mechanics and physics is essential for understanding how ice forces are developed and acts. The agreement in estimating of forces and development of ice loads have been over time been evaluated for the writing of new structural code. Structural layout proofs to be a significant factor in how ice is managed and therefore in reducing ice actions. However studies have showed that prediction of ice actions is hard to establish and therefore it is difficult to establish proper loading cases. For designing a FPSO in the arctic waters, the classification criteria for floating units need to be complied with. The DNV rules for offshore structure refer to the class rules for ship with additional ice strengthening class. The ISO (International Organization for Standardization) the world's largest developer and publisher of International Standards have issued a draft for a design code for Arctic offshore structures. These two rules and codes have been compared in connection with local structural arrangement. For arctic structures, two design checks ELIE and ALIE are required. These design checks are less established. ELIE ice checks have a return period of one hundred year (10 - 2) and ALIE one thousand year (10 - 4). The SEVAN-FPU ice is designed for handling level ice up to 3 m according the DNV Polar 30 Class Notation. Structures are according to the codes required to withstand the ice actions from ELIE within the elastic region. ALIE action will involve plastic damage, but the requirement is to maintain structural integrity to survive a ULIE check. The master thesis purpose is to determine ELIE and ALIE. The ELIE and ALIE are clearly depended on local field data which makes it a challenge in estimations. The ELIE design load for the Sevan FPU-ice is based on a pressure-area equation for massive ice feature. The pressure-area equation is based on empirical data measurement from several field programs. The load area for a plate design is assumed to be the whole plate area, while for the stiffener design 80 % of the plate height times four stiffener spacing. The ELIE pressure is respectively 5. 11 MPa and 2. 37 MPa. For arctic structures, iceberg is the governing factor for ALIE. Designing for an impact of a large iceberg in 100 or 10 000 years storm may be impossible due to the massive energy involved. Sevan FPU-ice is designed with possibility of disconnecting. This may reduced the ALIE load, however the possibility of failure in disconnecting should be included in ALIE. In estimation of iceberg impact, kinetic energy is the load applied for calculations. Structural resistance for impact is measured in energy dissipated in strain before fracture. The plastic strain gives the dominating dissipated energy and elastic strain is in a small magnitude. By equating kinetic energy applied and strain energy dissipated before fracture can be seen as what the structure can withstand. ABAQUS standard has been applied for analyzing different structural layout with the intentional structural layout for SEVAN- FPU-ice as a basis. A non linear finite element analysis is preformed to investigate structural capacity and the energy dissipated in plastic strain in order to check for ELIE and ALIE. The model has been created using the ABAQUS CAE. The ELIE design loads for plate and stiffener design are applied for the ABAQUS for the intentional structural layout. Both plate and stiffener design check was applied in the elastic region. Six different models were made with different stiffener <b>profile.</b> <b>Plate</b> and stiffener spacing were hold constant with the structural layout given from Sevan. For finding the ultimate strength of the, a plate patch load was applied with three different load intensity. The load intensity was found in the using the same pressure area curve as for the ELIE design load. The loads were scaled up to an assumed strain level beyond critical strain. The result showed that a T-bar stiffener withstands the pressure loads significant better. The results from the analysis should be handled with care. In particular the boundary conditions should be evaluated further. The results should be verified by more extensive use of finite element programs. </p...|$|E

40|$|Background: Distal radius {{fractures}} {{are among}} the most common fractures seen in the hospital emergency department. Of these, over 40 % are considered unstable and require some form of fixation. In recent years with the advent of low <b>profile</b> <b>plating,</b> open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) using volar plates has become the surgical treatment of choice in many hospitals. However, it is currently unknown which plating system has the lowest complication rate and/or superior clinical and radiological outcomes following surgery. Few studies have compared different types of plates, which may have various features, different plate and screw designs or may be manufactured from different materials (for example, stainless steel or titanium). This study will specifically investigate and compare the clinical and radiological outcomes and complication rates of two commonly used volar plating systems for fixation of distal radius fractures: one made from stainless steel (Trimed (TM) Volar Plate, Trimed (TM), California, USA) and the other made from titanium (Medartis (R) Aptus Volar Plate, Medartis (R), Basel, Switzerland).

40|$|This is {{the first}} in a series of papers {{presenting}} the development of a comprehensive multiscale model with focus on fiber energy efficiency in thermo mechanical pulp processes. The fiber energy efficiency is related to the defibration and fibrillation work obtained when fibers and fiber bundles interact with the refining bars. The fiber energy efficiency differs from the total refining energy efficiency which includes the thermodynamical work as well. Extracting defibration and fibrillation work along the radius in the refining zone gives information valuable for fiber development studies. Models for this process must handle physical variables as well as machine specific parameters at different scales. To span the material and energy balances, spatial measurements from the refining zone must be available. In this paper, measurements of temperature <b>profile</b> and <b>plate</b> gaps from a full-scale CD-refiner are considered as model inputs together with a number of process variables. This enables the distributed consistency in the refining zone as well as the split of the total work between the flat zone and the CD-zone to be derived. As the temperature <b>profile</b> and the <b>plate</b> gap are available in the flat zone and the CD-zone at different process conditions it is also shown that the distributed pulp dynamic viscosity can be obtained. This is normally unknown in refining processes but certainly useful for all fluid dynamic models describing the bar-to-fiber interactions. Finally, it is shown that the inclusion of the machine parameters will be vital to get good estimates of the refining conditions and especially the split between the thermodynamical work and the defibration/fibrillation work...|$|R
