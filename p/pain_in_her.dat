5|$|In June 1911, Charlotte {{attended}} {{her cousin}} George V's coronation in England, but the country's summer heat left her bed-ridden with a swollen face and <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> limbs. On 25 June 1914, her husband inherited his father's dukedom and became Bernhard III, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen. World War I broke out on 28 July; Bernhard {{left for the}} front while Charlotte remained behind to oversee the duchy, serving mainly as a figurehead. During the war, Charlotte increasingly experienced various pains including chronic aches, swollen legs, and kidney problems. The degree of the pain became so severe that she took opium as her only comfortable treatment.|$|E
25|$|In 1985, after {{experiencing}} severe {{fatigue and}} suffering from <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> upper legs {{on the set}} of Haunted Honeymoon in the United Kingdom, Radner sought medical treatment. For a period of 10 months, various doctors, most of them in Los Angeles, gave her several diagnoses that all {{turned out to be wrong}} as she continued to experience pain.|$|E
25|$|In May Ennis {{withdrew from}} the {{heptathlon}} competition at the Hypo-Meeting in Götzis, Austria after the first day's events citing <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> right foot.

25|$|During her German tour, {{she began}} to suffer agonizing <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> right knee, {{probably}} connected with a fall she had suffered on stage during her tour in South America. She was forced to reduce her movements in L'Aiglon. A German doctor recommended that she halt the tour immediately and have surgery, followed by six months of complete immobilization of her leg. Bernhardt promised {{to see a doctor}} when she returned to Paris, but continued the tour.|$|E
25|$|Ennis-Hill {{returned}} to {{action in a}} meeting at Loughborough where she recorded a javelin personal best of 48.33metres. She also competed in the long jump, reverting to the right-foot take off she used before her 2008 injury. Afterwards she still complained of <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> ankle. At the London Anniversary Games she finished fourth in the 100metres hurdles in 13.08seconds and eighth in the long jump, recording 6.16metres but four days later decided not to compete at the Moscow World Championships as she had not fully recovered from injury.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the medical}} {{treatment}} {{she had received}} in San Francisco, Kahlo's health problems continued throughout the 1940s. Due to her spinal problems, she wore twenty-eight separate supportive corsets, varying from steel and leather to plaster, between 1940 and 1954. She also experienced <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> legs, while the infection on her hand had become chronic, and she also underwent treatment for syphilis. In addition, {{the death of her}} father in April 1941 plunged her into a depression. Her ill health made her increasingly confined to La Casa Azul, which became the center of her world. She enjoyed taking care of the house and its garden, and was kept company by friends, servants, and various pets, including spider monkeys, Xoloitzcuintlis, and parrots.|$|E

25|$|Williams was the {{defending}} champion {{and one of the}} favorites to win the singles title at Wimbledon. However, she lost in the third round to 26th-seeded Jelena Janković. After the loss, Williams said that she was having <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> left wrist, although she admitted that the injury was not the cause of her loss. Williams did not play in the US Open series or the US Open itself due to the wrist injury. In October, during her first tournament in almost three months, she reinjured her wrist at the tournament in Luxembourg and lost in the second round to qualifier Agnieszka Radwańska. Williams finished the season as world No. 46, her lowest finish since she began to play on the WTA Tour full-time in 1997. It was the second consecutive year she finished higher than Serena, who finished the year at world No. 95.|$|E
25|$|Mary and Cathleen {{return home}} from their {{drive to the}} drugstore, where Mary has sent Cathleen in to {{purchase}} her morphine prescription. Not wanting to be alone, Mary does not allow Cathleen {{to go to the}} kitchen to finish dinner and offers her a drink instead. Mary does most of the talking and discusses her love for fog but her hatred of the foghorn and her husband’s obvious obsession with money. It is obvious that Mary has already taken some of her “prescription.” She talks about her past in a Catholic convent and the promise she once had as a pianist {{and the fact that it}} was once thought that she might become a nun. She also makes it clear that while she fell in love with her husband from the time she met him, she had never taken to the theatre crowd. She shows her arthritic hands to Cathleen and explains that the <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> hands is why she needs her prescription – an explanation which is untrue and transparent to Cathleen.|$|E

50|$|Historical texts {{reveal that}} she was afflicted with a {{debilitating}} disease, sharing many characteristics with multiple sclerosis, such as the age of onset, duration, and course of disease. Lidwina’s disease began soon after her fall. From that time onward, she developed walking difficulties, headaches and violent <b>pains</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> teeth. By the age of 19, both her legs were paralyzed and her vision was disturbed.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the age of}} 33, Göttlich {{started to}} have severe <b>pains</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> {{abdominal}} section, believing the pain {{to be caused by}} herniated organs. Professor Friedrich Tiedmann from the University of Heidelberg examined Göttlich in November 1832. Upon examination, he found Göttlich [...] "was evidently a man, with genitals of uncommon formation. She will dress herself, therefore, in men's clothes, and adopt the name of Gottlieb." ...|$|R
40|$|The {{patient is}} a 56 -year-old female {{with a history}} of {{hypertension}} who was recently diagnosed with seronegative Rheumatoid arthritis.

She denied significant swelling, erythema, or warmth of her joints. She reported that these symptoms began subtly several years prior but had now become rather incapacitating and had limited her ability to exercise and even ambulate on her "bad days". Her past medical history includes GERD, eczema, skin cancer, as well as fatty liver and peptic ulcer disease. Her only current medication was etanercept...|$|R
500|$|From Lisbon the Imperial couple {{went on to}} Porto. Isabel and {{her family}} {{departed}} to Spain on a trip. On 24 December, the Imperial Family received official news {{that they had been}} banished forever from the country. Up until that point, they had only been requested to leave with no indication as to how long they were to stay away. The [...] "news broke D. Teresa Cristina's will to live." [...] PedroII wrote in his journal on 28 December 1889: [...] "Hearing the Empress complain I went to see what it was. She is cold with a <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> sides; but she does not have any fever." [...] As the day passed, Teresa Cristina's breathing became increasingly labored, and the failure of her respiratory system led to cardiac arrest and death at 2:00pm.|$|E
500|$|Edina Müller {{was born}} on 28 June 1983, [...] {{and raised in the}} Rhineland town of Brühl. In 2000, at the age of 16, she was playing volleyball, and felt <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> back. A doctor {{straightened}} her back, but within two hours she lost feeling in her legs. She was rushed to hospital where a blood clot was discovered. Diagnosed with paraplegia, she spent the next four months in hospital. She had to repeat Year 10 at Max Ernst Gymnasium, but graduated in 2003. Although she began using a wheelchair, she longed to return to playing sport, and initially tried sitting volleyball. She then took up wheelchair tennis, winning the Hungarian Open in 2005, but ultimately switched to wheelchair basketball, playing for ASV Bonn. In 2005, she was invited to attend a German national team training camp [...] by its coach, Holger Glinicki. The following year she made the national team and won bronze at the World Championships in Amsterdam.|$|E
500|$|The {{protagonist of}} the prior film, Alex Browning (Devon Sawa), was killed {{off-screen}} in the film. Rumors indicated that Sawa had a contract dispute with New Line concerning the deduction of his salary; however, Perry resolved {{the issue with}} the statement that [...] "it had everything to do with narrative, and nothing to do with money or Devon’s unwillingness to come back." [...] Despite this, New Line reinstated Ali Larter to reprise her character as Clear Rivers. [...] "When New Line asked me to come back, I thought it was great. They showed me the script and let me have some input, and it was really terrific," [...] Larter revealed. Larter indicated that Clear [...] " [...] gotten to a hardened place and tucked herself inside because she has felt so much <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> life. By having herself committed to a mental hospital, she has created a safehouse so that Death can't get her." [...] Tony Todd also resumed his character as mortician William Bludworth. [...] "It’s the same character that we saw before that the audience loved," [...] Ellis expressed.|$|E
50|$|In mid-May 2009, she {{was hospitalized}} in the Hospital Sírio-Libanês in São Paulo, with severe <b>pains</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> legs.

In early September that same year, she revealed she had completed her radiotherapy treatment, claiming to be cured, which was later confirmed by her doctors. She began to wear a wig due to hair loss caused by the chemotherapy.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the spring}} of 2001, Omartian began {{experiencing}} <b>pains</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> legs. It was assumed by doctors that the pains were a result of growth, but she was later diagnosed with Ewing's sarcoma, a cancerous bone tumor, on her right leg. [...] The tumor kept her hospitalized and she experienced many regular cancer symptoms, such as hair loss, trouble walking, and acid reflux disease, as {{she was unable to}} eat many foods.|$|R
500|$|Bruce MacVittie {{auditioned for}} the role of Larry Biedron by mailing a tape of himself {{performing}} to the show's producers. Yoshimura had previously seen MacVittie perform on the New York City stage and thought that he was a [...] "wonderful, wonderful actor". After watching his rehearsal tape, Yoshimura settled on MacVittie for the part based not only on his acting, but also on his short physical stature. Yoshimura said, [...] "I'm watching this tape and I'm thinking, 'Yeah, this little guy! Who would suspect this little guy to have these murderous kinds of tendencies. Laura MacDonald was also cast as Lange's girlfriend Sarah Flannigan based on an audition tape she sent to the show. Wendee Pratt was cast as emergency medical technician Joy Tolson, who works to help Lange throughout the episode but does not get along with him. Yoshimura said that he particularly enjoyed Pratt's performance [...] "because she's not playing at all sympathetic. This guy's a <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> ass." [...] Shari Elliker, a WBAL (AM) disc jockey from the Baltimore area, made a cameo appearance as a witness in the subway.|$|E
500|$|Wilder met Saturday Night Live actress Gilda Radner on August 13, 1981, while filming Sidney Poitier's Hanky Panky. Radner {{was married}} to guitarist G. E. Smith at the time, but [...] Wilder and she became inseparable friends. When the filming of Hanky Panky ended, Wilder found himself missing Radner, so he called her. The {{relationship}} grew, and Radner eventually divorced Smith in 1982. She moved in with Wilder, and the couple married on September 14, 1984, {{in the south of}} France. The couple wanted to have children, but Radner suffered miscarriages, and doctors could not determine the problem. After experiencing severe fatigue and suffering from <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> upper legs on the set of Haunted Honeymoon, Radner sought medical treatment. Following a number of false diagnoses, she was found to have ovarian cancer in October 1986. Over the next year and a half, Radner battled the disease, receiving chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatments. The disease finally went into remission, giving the couple a respite, during which time Wilder filmed See No Evil, Hear No Evil. By May 1989, the cancer returned and had metastasized. Radner died on May 20, 1989. Wilder later stated, [...] "I always thought she'd pull through." ...|$|E
500|$|Beyoncé's {{version of}} [...] "Resentment" [...] {{received}} positive reviews from critics, {{most of whom}} noted the soulful vocal stylings used in the song. Bill Lamb of About.com complimented the song {{as one of the}} album highlights and described it as [...] "gospel-influenced" [...] and [...] "emotion filled" [...] song. A writer of Billboard magazine stated that Beyoncé [...] "shifts into emotive mode" [...] on this song from [...] "rockier, edgier" [...] sound of album and noted that the track [...] "calls to mind the subtle fervor and passion of the best girl groups of the '60s and '70s". Brian Hiatt from Rolling Stone marked the track as [...] "one of the most arresting moments" [...] on the album and described it as an [...] "anguished, sixties-tinged ballad". Spence Abbott of IGN also noted track as a stand out alongside [...] "Irreplaceable" [...] and observed that [...] " [...] track goes straight for Aretha Franklin-inspired territory, with Beyoncé actually getting gritty and dropping her high octave range down a few pegs to get guttural and downright Old School soulful". Jon Pareles of The New York Times stated that the [...] "agitated goodbye" [...] builds a different kind of overwrought drama. Steve Jones of USA Today the song showcases Beyoncé's [...] "maturing vocal chops," [...] describing the song as spare and gritty. Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine noted that the song would have been better if performed by a trio of [...] "talented" [...] vocalists, such as Destiny's Child, rather than Beyoncé by herself. Houston Chronicles Joey Guerra felt that [...] "Doubters of Beyoncé's immense talent need only give one listen to this track [...] from 2006's B'Day. It's a stunner — a visceral, emotional showcase that casts Beyoncé as a scorned, sorrowful woman. You can almost feel the <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> delivery." [...] According to a writer of Irish Independent, the song gives a more soulful feel to B'Day. Jim Farber of Daily News called [...] "Resentment" [...] an [...] "old-school soul shouter". Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker described the song as a [...] "fierce ballad". [...] "Resentment" [...] peaked at number 11 on the US Bubbling Under R/Hip-Hop Singles chart, which acts as an extension to the Hot R/Hip-Hop Songs.|$|E
40|$|With {{an effort}} {{she pushed the}} iron over the last patch of wrinkled, white shirt, {{conscious}} of the stabbing <b>pains</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> back and shoulders. Force of habit made her gently slide the shirt {{off the end of}} the board and start to retouch the collar, pulling the collar after the iron to round it. She tilted the iron up on the board. It settled with a thud, and she rubbed her arm across her forehead, dotted with perspiration...|$|R
60|$|For <b>in</b> <b>her</b> {{latter half}} {{she had to}} visit the slum cases. And such cases! A woman lying on a bare, filthy floor, a few old coats thrown over her, and vermin {{crawling}} everywhere, in spite of sanitary inspectors. But what did the woman, the sufferer, herself care! She ground her teeth and screamed and yelled with <b>pains.</b> <b>In</b> <b>her</b> calm periods she lay stupid and indifferent--or she cursed a little. But abject, stupid indifference was {{the bottom of it}} all: abject, brutal indifference to everything--yes, everything. Just a piece of female functioning, no more.|$|R
25|$|Two years later, Ida {{returned}} to see Freud {{and explained that}} her symptoms had mostly cleared up; that she had confronted the Ks. who confessed {{that she had been}} right all along; but that she had recently developed <b>pains</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> face. Freud added the details of this to his report, but still viewed his work as an overall failure; and (much later) added a footnote blaming himself for not stressing Ida's attachment to Frau K, rather than to Herr K, her husband.|$|R
2500|$|The briefest of the sections, {{at little}} more than three pages in most editions of the novel, [...] "1918" [...] shows us Crosby, now very old and with <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> legs.

Suddenly guns and sirens go off, {{but it is not}} the war, it is the news that the war has ended.|$|E
2500|$|With the new {{recording}} contract, Loveless {{headed into}} the recording studio to record new material for Epic. In the studio, her producer (Gordy) noticed that her voice was {{not as strong as}} it had been when she last recorded two years previously. [...] The fact was that beginning as far back as 1990, Loveless felt some <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> throat when singing, and when she saw a doctor, he noticed a red spot on her vocal cords. [...] By 1992, Loveless was on a regimen of steroid tablets and cortisone to prop up her voice.|$|E

I {{went to see}} {{her last}} Sunday, the 23rd May, and found her in a sad state, {{suffering}} from pains in her toes and the soles of her feet until the tears came into her eyes. I went away because I saw that she refrained from crying out on my account. I thought {{she was in a}} bad way. A consultation was held by her three physicians, the result of which was that they determined to bleed her in the feet. They had some difficulty in persuading her to submit to it, because the <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> feet was so great that she uttered the most piercing screams if the bedclothes only rubbed against them. The bleeding, however, succeeded, and she was in some degree relieved. It was the gout in both feet ...|$|E
5000|$|The band toured {{continuously}} on the album, though {{towards the}} end of the tour, problems began to arise. Govaert began to lose her voice, while Kuijsters experienced severe <b>pains</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> hand that stopped her from playing shows without painkillers. After the tour, Govaert needed an operation on her vocal cords, while Kuijsters was diagnosed as simply not being [...] "made" [...] to play guitar. The band moved her to keyboards and she was replaced as a guitarist by Thomas Holthuis.|$|R

At first it {{was believed to be}} a successful surgery and Clarke was expected to make a full recovery. Unfortunately, gangrene had entered her body due to the infection brought on by the surgery. Anna Mac Clarke died on April 19, 1944, at the age of 24.|$|R
