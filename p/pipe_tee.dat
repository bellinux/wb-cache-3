The configuration of the large corroded pit had {{the shape of an}} imperfect horse's hoof with a completely corroded interior and a honeycomb-like cavity. There is a badly corroded pit at the welded seam at the joint connecting the <b>tee</b> <b>pipe</b> and flange. The material strength of the <b>tee</b> <b>pipe</b> meets the requirement of ASTM-A 234 Gr. WPR, but its chemical composition does not meet the stipulated requirements. A deformed streamline structure or twin crystal in the ferrite phase can be seen near the surface or sub-surface of the perforated corrosion puncture edge. The micro-hardness is also {{different from that of the}} original material. The SEM results show that the puncture appears to have been a mode of quasi-cleavage fractures with secondary cracks along the direction of the crystal grain; thus, the failure has the features of mechanical and chemical corrosion. The corroded surface contains high amounts of O, C, and N, as well as S, Cl, Si, Na, Mg, Al, K, Ti, etc., all of which are corrosion products caused by sea water. The penetrating puncture hole at the turn of the <b>tee</b> <b>pipe</b> is likely the result of cavitation erosion accompanied by chemical/electrochemical corrosion, and the corrosion on the seam connecting the <b>tee</b> <b>pipe</b> and flange is likely the result of electrochemical corrosion...|$|R

40|$|Introduction The mixing {{properties}} of the transverse jet [...] -a jet issuing normally into a uniform crossflow [...] -are important {{to a variety of}} engineering applications. Transverse jets may function as sources of fuel in industrial furnaces, or as diluent jets for blade cooling or exhaust gas cooling in industrial or airborne gas turbines. Other industrial applications include <b>pipe</b> <b>tee</b> mixers and jets of oil and gas entering the flow in oil wells. Transverse jets have also been studied extensively for their relevance to V/STOL aerodynamics and to environmental problems such as pollutant dispersion from chimneys or the discharge of e#uents into the ocean. Enhancement of the mixing rate between jet and crossflow can lead to significant improvements in many performance aspects. In gas turbines, for instance, better transverse jet mixing is essential to achieving a wider range of operability, lower emissions, smaller size, and lower noise output.

The Bradley-Tait equation for the pressure dependence of the water {{refractive index}} is completed by a wavelength-dependent factor. Also, in the considered pressure and wavelength ranges, it is shown that the Sellmeier coefficients can be straightforwardly linked to the pressure, allowing the determination of the refractive index of water for either any wavelength or pressure. A new simple model allows the determination of the density of water {{as a function of the}} measured refractive index.

40|$|Poor knife–to–knife {{distribution}} {{observed in}} stationary tests {{is a concern}} because it may reduce efficiency of use and even lead to intentional over application of nitrogen (N) applied as anhydrous ammonia. To determine {{the magnitude of this}} problem we measured ammonia distribution by conventional, Vertical–Dam, and Cold–flo manifolds and flow division by a <b>pipe</b> <b>tee</b> during field applicator operation with ammonia flows from each port caught in water. Due to limitations of the manifolds and regulator, flow variability due to knife style and condition was determined in a stationary test using water instead of ammonia. Port–to–port variability was less for a Vertical–Dam manifold than a conventional manifold at a 56 –kg N/ha (50 –lb N/acre) application rate, but similar for both manifolds at application rates of 112 and 168 kg N/ha (100 and 150 lb N/acre). The Cold–flo manifold also had similar variability to the other two manifolds at the 112 –kg N/ha (100 –lb N/acre) rate. Ammonia exiting individual outlet ports was typically 10 to 20 % from the mean application rate with highest port flow 150 to 250 % of lowest port flow. Statistically, manifolds had the greatest ammonia output from ports across from incoming flow, intermediate output from ports behind incoming flow, and least output from ports {{on either side of the}} manifold midway between these regions. A straight entry pipe did not improve distribution for a conventional manifold. A pipe–tee divided flow evenly, with only an average 2. 4 % flow difference.

40|$|The problem o f {{piping system}} dead-legs are {{frequently}} encountered in high purity water systems throughout the pharmaceutical and semi-conductor industries. The {{installation of a}} <b>pipe</b> <b>tee</b> in sterile process pipework often creates a stagnant dead-leg zone which can result {{in the formation of}} bio-film and compromise the entire system. Considerable basic research is required to address the lack of understanding of this problem and to assist during design, manufacture, installation and operation of these critical systems. This study involves the application o f CFD (computational fluid dynamics) techniques to the study of turbulent flow in Pharmaceutical pipe teejunctions. Numerical models have been developed to initially study divided turbulent flow in a range of standard Pharmaceutical tee-j unctions and then to study dead-leg flow. Numerical predictions were compared with previously presented experimental results based on Laser Doppler Velocimetry. Turbulent models such as the k - e and Reynolds Stress model (RSM) were used to analyse the flow. Dye injection studies highlighted the lack of penetration o f the dead-leg and complex branch flow patterns for both sharp and round entry tees. Hydrogen bubble techniques gave clear evidence of the presence of a slow rotating vortex at entry to each branch and the presence of stagnation zones throughout the dead-legs. The effect o f mainstream velocity and loop to branch ratios on dead-leg flow patterns was analysed. Stagnation zones were identified within each branch and the presence of a slow rotating cell within the dead-leg resulted in a lack of exchange of mainstream fluid from the distribution to the branch. The 6 D-rule was found to be industrially irrelevant. 1 to 2 D configurations should be used to avoid stagnation. No configuration resulted in high wall shear stress within the branch and a reduction in branch to loop diameter increased branch stagnation. There was no evidence of exchange of fluid between the loop and branch and all configurations had some quiescent (dormant/inactive) water...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Elements {{of water}} supply {{systems such as}} <b>pipes,</b> elbows, <b>tee</b> connections, …etc., are made of {{polymeric}} materials. They are sub-jected to erosion by streams of water and contaminants. The objective of this work is to investigate the erosion resistance of the polymers that are locally used to produce such components. Three materials were examined, namely: High pressure PVC (HP-PVC), Low pressure PVC (LP-PVC), and Polypropylene (PP). Four types of water were used to erode the polymeric specimens: Distilled water (DiW), De-salinated water (DeW), Sea water (SW), and untreated deep ground (Well) water (WW). The effects of water stream velocity and eroding time on the erosion wear behaviour of the polymers were examined. The work was conducted under controlled environment of 23 °C tem-perature and 40 % humidity. Results show that erosive wear of all ma-terials increases {{with the increase in}} stream velocity and/or eroding time. It also indicates that at certain values of velocity and/or eroding time the increase in rate was more pronounced. In addition the pres-ence of water contaminants has drastic effects on the erosion volume. Results also show that HP-PVC has the highest erosion resistance...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} serious {{problems}} on the maintenance of piping system in nuclear power plant is the reduction of pipe-thickness induced by flow accelerated corrosion (FAC). In the design of nuclear power plants, it assumes that the thickness of the pipe used in the piping system is constant. In-service, piping components may experience wall thinning due to cavitations, general corrosion, microbiologically influenced corrosion, pitting, or FAC. The objective of this research is the experimental evaluation of the performance of examination procedures and techniques available for pipe inspection in nuclear power plants. Round robin (RR) test was circulated to the 3 participating organizations. Four kinds of pipe samples were circulated <b>pipe,</b> elbow, <b>tee</b> and reducer. A total of 68 flaws (some of which were combinations of flaws) were introduced into the pipes representing a wide range of types and locations. The major flaws introduced fell into two principle categories: 1) machined flaws simulating typical flaws such as wastage and pitting and 2) naturally introduced flaws due to FAC. The inspection procedures were based on ultrasonic procedures only. For procedures based on ultrasonic testing only, detection was very good for wall thinning flaw. In several cases of teams demonstrated their ability to identify the wall thinning flaw. Conclusions of the exercise indicate that this capability is necessary to qualify in overhaul inspection procedures for piping systems. The analysis proposed in this paper can be widely applied to the secondary piping system in nuclear power plants. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- With the {{increase}} of communication between computers, we need (i) techniques for communication to be handled automatically or implicitly, and (ii) flexible programs capable of handling data from different kinds of correspondents with no reprogramming. The traditional approach of handling input/output, files, inter program communication and man machine interfaces by specific statements in programming languages restricts these two aims. We propose handling these activities implicitly and in a unified manner by separating a program into a pure algorithm with no communication statements (PurAL), and separate declarations which describe externally mapped variables and distribution of programs (DUAL declarations). So, without using I/O or communication statements, just assigning to an externally mapped variable will cause a value to be sent outside the program. Similarly referencing such a variable will cause a value to be fetched from outside the program (if {{it has not been}} fetched already). Another approach, is to perform the input of an externally mapped variable when its storage is allocated (e. g. block entry) and the output when its storage is freed (e. g. block exit). As the mapping of variables is described separately from the program, this enables the program to be used in various contexts (ports, files, networks, windows etc.). By specifying that a variable is mapped to data on another computer, in effect we are dealing with remote data access, i. e. the communication is implicit. By specifying that an output-variable in one program is to be mapped to input-variables in other programs, we have in effect a generalization of the <b>pipe</b> and <b>tee</b> operating system constructs. We also propose rules for open/close and lock/unlock, enabling these operations to be carried out automatically...|$|R
