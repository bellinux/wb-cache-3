5|$|Nickel {{is one of}} four {{elements}} (iron, cobalt, nickel, and gadolinium) {{that are}} ferromagnetic at approximately room temperature. Alnico <b>permanent</b> <b>magnets</b> based partly on nickel are of intermediate strength between iron-based <b>permanent</b> <b>magnets</b> and rare-earth magnets. The metal is valuable in modern times chiefly in alloys; about 68% of world production is used in stainless steel. A further 10% is used for nickel-based and copper-based alloys, 7% for alloy steels, 3% in foundries, 9% in plating and 4% in other applications, including the fast-growing battery sector. As a compound, nickel has a number of niche chemical manufacturing uses, such as a catalyst for hydrogenation, cathodes for batteries, pigments and metal surface treatments. Nickel is an essential nutrient for some microorganisms and plants that have enzymes with nickel as an active site.|$|E
5|$|Dysprosium is used, in {{conjunction}} with vanadium and other elements, in making laser materials and commercial lighting. Because of dysprosium's high thermal-neutron absorption cross-section, dysprosium-oxide–nickel cermets are used in neutron-absorbing control rods in nuclear reactors. Dysprosium–cadmium chalcogenides are sources of infrared radiation, which is useful for studying chemical reactions. Because dysprosium and its compounds are highly susceptible to magnetization, they are employed in various data-storage applications, such as in hard disks. Dysprosium is increasingly in demand for the <b>permanent</b> <b>magnets</b> used in electric car motors and wind turbine generators.|$|E
5|$|In the laboratory, {{platinum}} wire {{is used for}} electrodes; platinum pans and supports are used in thermogravimetric analysis because of the stringent requirements of chemical inertness upon heating to high temperatures (~1000°C). Platinum is used as an alloying agent for various metal products, including fine wires, noncorrosive laboratory containers, medical instruments, dental prostheses, electrical contacts, and thermocouples. Platinum-cobalt, an alloy of roughly three parts platinum and one part cobalt, is used to make relatively strong <b>permanent</b> <b>magnets.</b> Platinum-based anodes are used in ships, pipelines, and steel piers.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, the {{partitioned}} rotor flux switching <b>permanent</b> <b>magnet</b> {{machine with}} ferrite <b>permanent</b> <b>magnet</b> is proposed. By {{the adoption of}} the partitioned rotor configuration, the stator flux leakage is eliminated and the <b>permanent</b> <b>magnet</b> utilization is improved. The ferrite <b>permanent</b> <b>magnet</b> machine often suffers from irreversible demagnetization due to the inherent relatively low coercivity of ferrite <b>permanent</b> <b>magnet.</b> To mitigate the machine irreversible demagnetization risk, an improved partitioned rotor flux switching <b>permanent</b> <b>magnet</b> machine with hybrid <b>permanent</b> <b>magnet</b> topology is also proposed. Two little pieces of rare-earth <b>permanent</b> <b>magnet</b> are installed at the corners of ferrite <b>permanent</b> <b>magnet,</b> thus forming the hybrid <b>permanent</b> <b>magnet</b> topology. And the demagnetization mechanisms of both machines are clarified by the magnetic equivalent circuit method, which prove that the rare-earth <b>permanent</b> <b>magnet</b> offer magnetic protection function for the ferrite <b>permanent</b> <b>magnet.</b> Furthermore, by the 2 -D finite element analysis, the demagnetization characteristics and the electromagnetic performances of the two machines are quantitively assessed, revealing that the demagnetization risk is reduced significantly. Both theoretical analysis and simulation results verify that the improved machine can not only maintain low-cost design, but also possess enhanced demagnetization withstand capability and competitive electromagnetic performances as expected...|$|R

5|$|Cobalt-based {{superalloys}} consume {{most of the}} produced cobalt. The {{temperature stability}} of these alloys makes them suitable for turbine blades for gas turbines and jet aircraft engines, though nickel-based single crystal alloys surpass them in performance. Cobalt-based alloys are also corrosion and wear-resistant, making them (along with titanium) useful in medical orthopedic implants that do not wear down over time. The development of wear-resistant cobalt alloys started {{in the first decade}} of the 20th century with the stellite alloys, containing chromium with varying quantities of tungsten and carbon. Alloys with chromium and tungsten carbides are very hard and wear resistant. Special cobalt-chromium-molybdenum alloys like Vitallium are used for prosthetic parts (hip and knee replacements). Cobalt alloys are also used for dental prosthetics as a useful substitute for nickel, which may be allergenic. Some high speed steels also contain cobalt for increased heat and wear-resistance. The special alloys of aluminium, nickel, cobalt and iron, known as Alnico, and of samarium and cobalt (samarium-cobalt magnet) are used in <b>permanent</b> <b>magnets.</b> It is also alloyed with 95% platinum for jewelry, yielding an alloy suitable for fine casting and is also slightly magnetic.|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} <b>permanent</b> <b>magnet</b> {{inductors}} for dc biased inductor applications are considered. The inductor designs utilize the persistent flux of a <b>permanent</b> <b>magnet</b> to partially offset the flux in the magnetic core due to current in the winding. The {{addition of the}} <b>permanent</b> <b>magnet</b> allows for decreased inductor mass for a given inductor current, loss, and inductance rating. This dissertation presents the first formal optimization of <b>permanent</b> <b>magnet</b> inductors. Optimized inductor designs are achieved using a population-based, multi-objective optimization algorithm in which the design parameters consist of the <b>permanent</b> <b>magnet</b> material type and geometry of the magnetic core, conductor, and <b>permanent</b> <b>magnet.</b> By comparing Pareto-optimal fronts, it is shown that the mass of a <b>permanent</b> <b>magnet</b> inductor is significantly {{less than that of}} a traditional EI core inductor for a given loss. Then, an optimization algorithm of a dc-dc power converter utilizing a <b>permanent</b> <b>magnet</b> inductor is presented. The algorithm includes both a magnetic and thermal analysis. ...|$|R
