25|$|Excitotoxicity is {{phenomenon}} in which glutamate receptors are inappropriately activated. It {{can be caused}} by prolonged excitatory synaptic transmission in which high levels of glutamate neurotransmitter cause excessive activation in a <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>neuron</b> that can result in the death of the <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>neuron.</b> Following brain injury (such as from ischemia), it has been found that excitotoxicity is a significant cause of neuronal damage. This can be understandable in the case where sudden perfusion of blood after reduced blood flow to the brain can result in excessive synaptic activity caused by the presence of increased glutamate and aspartate during the period of ischemia.|$|E
25|$|Neuroplasticity is {{the ability}} of a {{particular}} part or region of a neuron to change in strength over time. There are two largely recognized categories of plasticity: synaptic and nonsynaptic. Synaptic plasticity deals directly with the strength of the connection between two neurons, including amount of neurotransmitter released from the presynaptic neuron, and the response generated in the <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>neuron.</b> Nonsynaptic plasticity involves modification of neuronal excitability in the axon, dendrites, and soma of an individual neuron, remote from the synapse.|$|E
40|$|SummaryThroughout the brain, <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>neurons</b> release {{substances}} {{from their}} cell bodies and dendrites that regulate {{the strength of}} the synapses they receive. Diverse chemical messengers have been implicated in retrograde signaling from <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>neurons</b> to presynaptic boutons. Here, we provide an overview of the signaling systems that lead to rapid changes in synaptic strength. We consider the capabilities, specializations, and physiological roles of each type of signaling system...|$|R

40|$|The {{cerebral}} cortex utilizes spatiotemporal continuity {{in the world}} to help build invariant representations. In vision, these might be representations of objects. The temporal continuity typical of objects has been used in an associative learning rule with a short-term memory trace to help build invariant object representations. In this paper, we show that spatial continuity can also provide a basis for helping a system to self-organize invariant representations. We introduce a new learning paradigm "continuous transformation learning" which operates by mapping spatially similar input patterns to the same <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>neurons</b> in a competitive learning system. As the inputs move through the space of possible continuous transforms (e. g. translation, rotation, etc.), the active synapses are modified onto the set of <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>neurons.</b> Because other transforms of the same stimulus overlap with previously learned exemplars, a common set of <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>neurons</b> is activated by the new transforms, and learning of the new active inputs onto the same <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>neurons</b> is facilitated. We demonstrate that a hierarchical model of cortical processing in the ventral visual system can be trained with continuous transform learning, and highlight differences in the learning of invariant representations to those achieved by trace learning...|$|R
25|$|In a {{chemical}} synapse, {{the process of}} synaptic transmission is as follows: when an action potential reaches the axon terminal, it opens voltage-gated calcium channels, allowing calcium ions to enter the terminal. Calcium causes synaptic vesicles filled with neurotransmitter molecules to fuse with the membrane, releasing their contents into the synaptic cleft. The neurotransmitters diffuse across the synaptic cleft and activate receptors on the <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>neuron.</b> High cytosolic calcium in the axon terminal also triggers mitochondrial calcium uptake, which, in turn, activates mitochondrial energy metabolism to produce ATP to support continuous neurotransmission.|$|E
25|$|Lidocaine alters signal {{conduction}} in neurons {{by blocking}} the fast voltage-gated Na+ channels in the neuronal cell membrane responsible for signal propagation. With sufficient blockage, the membrane of the <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>neuron</b> will not depolarize and will thus fail to transmit an action potential. This creates the anaesthetic effect by not merely preventing pain signals from propagating to the brain, but by stopping {{them before they}} begin. Careful titration allows for {{a high degree of}} selectivity in the blockage of sensory neurons, whereas higher concentrations also affect other modalities of neuron signaling.|$|E
25|$|A neuron affects other neurons by {{releasing}} a neurotransmitter that binds to chemical receptors. The effect upon the <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>neuron</b> is determined {{not by the}} presynaptic neuron or by the neurotransmitter, but {{by the type of}} receptor that is activated. A neurotransmitter {{can be thought of as}} a key, and a receptor as a lock: the same type of key can here be used to open many different types of locks. Receptors can be classified broadly as excitatory (causing an increase in firing rate), inhibitory (causing a decrease in firing rate), or modulatory (causing long-lasting effects not directly related to firing rate).|$|E
40|$|We {{show that}} spatial {{continuity}} can enable a network to learn translation invariant representations of objects by self-organization in a hierarchical model of cortical processing in the ventral visual system. During ‘continuous transformation learning’, the active synapses from each overlapping transform are associatively modified onto {{the set of}} <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>neurons.</b> Because other transforms of the same object overlap with previously learned exemplars, {{a common set of}} <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>neurons</b> is activated by the new transforms, and learning of the new active inputs onto the same <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>neurons</b> is facilitated.

40|$|The {{vestibular}} {{system is}} critical for postural balance, orientation, reflexive control of eye movements, and spatial cognition, yet compared with other sensory systems {{little is known about}} its cellular basis. Head motion signals are transduced in the inner ear and carried to brainstem vestibular nuclei by vestibular nerve afferents. The nature and quality of head motion information in the central nervous system depend on the capacity of vestibular nerve synapses to influence firing in <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>neurons.</b> This dissertation examines the functional and molecular features of the vestibular nerve synapse that promote the faithful transmission of head motion signals. Experimental results revealed that these synapses are specialized to provide <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>neurons</b> with unambiguous signals that linearly relate to head velocity. Extensive refinements of cellular machinery enable reliable, fast, linear synaptic transmission while still allowing for modifications of synaptic strength.

25|$|Brief {{activation}} of an excitatory pathway can produce {{what is known}} as long-term depression (LTD) of synaptic transmission {{in many areas of the}} brain. LTD is induced by a minimum level of postsynaptic depolarization and simultaneous increase in the intracellular calcium concentration at the <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>neuron.</b> LTD can be initiated at inactive synapses if the calcium concentration is raised to the minimum required level by heterosynaptic activation, or if the extracellular concentration is raised. These alternative conditions capable of causing LTD differ from the Hebb rule, and instead depend on synaptic activity modifications. D-serine release by astrocytes has been found to lead to a significant reduction of LTD in the hippocampus.|$|E
25|$|The {{distinction}} between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters is not absolute, however. Rather, {{it depends on}} the class of chemical receptors present on the <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>neuron.</b> In principle, a single neuron, releasing a single neurotransmitter, can have excitatory effects on some targets, inhibitory effects on others, and modulatory effects on others still. For example, photoreceptor cells in the retina constantly release the neurotransmitter glutamate in the absence of light. So-called OFF bipolar cells are, like most neurons, excited by the released glutamate. However, neighboring target neurons called ON bipolar cells are instead inhibited by glutamate, because they lack the typical ionotropic glutamate receptors and instead express a class of inhibitory metabotropic glutamate receptors. When light is present, the photoreceptors cease releasing glutamate, which relieves the ON bipolar cells from inhibition, activating them; this simultaneously removes the excitation from the OFF bipolar cells, silencing them.|$|E
25|$|Receptors on the {{opposite}} side of the synaptic gap bind neurotransmitter molecules. Receptors can respond in either of two general ways. First, the receptors may directly open ligand-gated ion channels in the postsynaptic cell membrane, causing ions to enter or exit the cell and changing the local transmembrane potential. The resulting change in voltage is called a postsynaptic potential. In general, the result is excitatory in the case of depolarizing currents, and inhibitory in the case of hyperpolarizing currents. Whether a synapse is excitatory or inhibitory depends on what type(s) of ion channel conduct the postsynaptic current(s), which in turn is a function of the type of receptors and neurotransmitter employed at the synapse. The second way a receptor can affect membrane potential is by modulating the production of chemical messengers inside the <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>neuron.</b> These second messengers can then amplify the inhibitory or excitatory response to neurotransmitters.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} {{applications}} of inhibitory postsynaptic potentials {{to the real}} world. Drugs that affect {{the actions of the}} neurotransmitter can treat neurological and psychological disorders through different combinations of types of receptors, G-proteins, and ion channels in <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>neurons.</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractEndogenous cannabinoids are {{considered}} to function as diffusible and short-lived modulators that may transmit signals retrogradely from <b>postsynaptic</b> to presynaptic <b>neurons.</b> To evaluate this possibility, {{we have made a}} paired whole-cell recording from cultured hippocampal neurons with inhibitory synaptic connections. In about 60 % of pairs, a cannabinoid agonist greatly reduced the release of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA from presynaptic terminals. In most of such pairs but not in those insensitive to the agonist, depolarization of <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>neurons</b> and the resultant elevation of intracellular Ca 2 + concentration caused transient suppression of inhibitory synaptic currents, which is mainly due to reduction of GABA release. This depolarization-induced suppression was completely blocked by selective cannabinoid antagonists. Our results reveal that endogenous cannabinoids mediate retrograde signals from depolarized <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>neurons</b> to presynaptic terminals to cause the reduction of transmitter release...|$|R

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, a {{presynaptic}} neuron releasing an inhibitory neurotransmitter, such as GABA, can cause an {{inhibitory postsynaptic potential}} (IPSP) in the <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>neuron,</b> bringing the membrane potential {{farther away from the}} threshold, decreasing its excitability and making it more difficult for the neuron to initiate an action potential. If an IPSP overlaps with an EPSP, the IPSP can in many cases prevent the neuron from firing an action potential. In this way, the output of a neuron may depend on the input of many different neurons, each of which may have a different degree of influence, depending on the strength and type of synapse with that neuron. John Carew Eccles performed some of the important early experiments on synaptic integration, for which he received the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1963. Complex input/output relationships form the basis of transistor-based computations in computers, and are thought to figure similarly in neural circuits.|$|E
500|$|Once in the synapse, {{dopamine}} binds to and activates dopamine receptors. These can be postsynaptic dopamine receptors, {{which are}} located on dendrites (the <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>neuron),</b> or presynaptic autoreceptors (e.g., the D2sh and presynaptic D3 receptors), which {{are located on}} the membrane of an axon terminal (the presynaptic neuron). [...] After the <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>neuron</b> elicits an action potential, dopamine molecules quickly become unbound from their receptors. They are then absorbed back into the presynaptic cell, via reuptake mediated either by the dopamine transporter or by the plasma membrane monoamine transporter. Once back in the cytosol, dopamine can either be broken down by a monoamine oxidase or repackaged into vesicles by VMAT2, making it available for future release.|$|E

40|$|Brief {{depolarization}} of <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>neurons</b> in hippocampus and cerebellum {{results in}} a transient depression of GABAergic inhibitory input, called "depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition" (DSI).

We found that the depolarization evoked a suppression of IPSC amplitude in 6 out of 26 neuronal pairs tested. The suppression of IPSC amplitude lasted for approximately 70 seconds and was accompanied by changes of paired-pulse ratio and IPSC coefficient of variation (CV), which is suggestive of a presynaptic mechanism. These results are in agreement with previous observations in hippocampal cell cultures and suggest that neocortical neurons express DSI...|$|R

[...] Neurons and synapses may also have a weight that varies as learning proceeds, which can increase or decrease the strength of the signal that it sends downstream.

2500|$|Cocaine blocks DAT by binding {{directly}} to the transporter and reducing the rate of transport. In contrast, amphetamine enters the presynaptic neuron directly through the neuronal membrane or through DAT, competing for reuptake with dopamine. Once inside, it binds to [...] or enters synaptic vesicles through [...] When amphetamine binds to TAAR1, it reduces the firing rate of the <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>neuron</b> and triggers protein kinase A and protein kinase C signaling, resulting in DAT phosphorylation. Phosphorylated DAT then either operates in reverse or withdraws into the presynaptic neuron and ceases transport. When amphetamine enters the synaptic vesicles through VMAT2, dopamine is released into the cytosol. Amphetamine also produces dopamine efflux through a second TAAR1-independent mechanism involving CAMKIIα-mediated phosphorylation of the transporter, which putatively arises from the activation of DAT-coupled L-type calcium channels by amphetamine.|$|E
2500|$|Tetrodotoxin (TTX) is {{a poison}} {{produced}} by organisms {{belonging to the}} Tetradontidae order, which includes the puffer fish, ocean sunfish, and porcupine fish. Within the puffer fish, which is a common delicacy especially in Japan, TTX {{is found in the}} liver, gonads, ovaries, intestines, and skin. TTX can be fatal if consumed, and has become a common form of poisoning in many countries. Common symptoms of TTX consumption include paraesthesia (often restricted to the mouth and limbs), muscle weakness, nausea, and vomiting and often manifest within 30 minutes of ingestion. The primary mechanism by which TTX is toxic is through the inhibition of sodium channel function, which reduces the functional capacity of neuron communication. This inhibition largely affects a susceptible subset of sodium channels known as TTX-sensitive (TTX-s), which also happens to be largely responsible for the sodium current that drives the depolarization phase of neuron action potentials. [...] TTX-resistant (TTX-r) is another form of sodium channel which has limited sensitivity to TTX, and is largely found in small diameter axons such as those found in nociception neurons. When significant levels of TTX is ingested, it will bind sodium channels on neurons and reduce their membrane permeability to sodium. This results in an increased effective threshold of required excitatory signals in order to induce an action potential in a <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>neuron.</b> The effect of this increased signaling threshold is a reduced excitability of postsynaptic neurons, and subsequent loss of motor and sensory function which can result in paralysis and death. Though assisted ventilation may increase the chance of survival after TTX exposure, there is currently no antitoxin. The use of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor Neostigmine or the muscarinic acetylcholine antagonist Atropine (which will inhibit parasympathetic activity), however, can increase sympathetic nerve activity enough to improve the chance of survival after TTX exposure.|$|E
50|$|Photoreceptors {{that are}} part of the {{receptive}} fields of more than one ganglion cell are able to excite or inhibit <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>neurons</b> because they release the neurotransmitter glutamate at their synapses, which can act to depolarize or to hyperpolarize a cell, depending on whether there is a metabotropic or ionotropic receptor on that cell.|$|R
2500|$|Long-term potentiation, {{commonly}} referred to as LTP, is an increase in synaptic response following potentiating pulses of electrical stimuli that sustains at a level above the baseline response for hours or longer.

50|$|In {{response}} to a threshold action potential or graded electrical potential, a neurotransmitter is released at the presynaptic terminal.

50|$|In {{addition}} to being input-specific, the strengthening of a synapse via homosynaptic plasticity is associative, because it {{is dependent on the}} firing of a presynaptic and <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>neuron</b> closely in time.
