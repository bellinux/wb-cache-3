40|$|We {{report the}} cases of 2 {{patients}} who presented with clinical and echocardiographic evidence of cardiac tamponade. Therapeutic echocardiographic-guided pericardiocentesis yielded bloody fluid. In both patients, Definity® <b>perflutren</b> lipid microspheres were used for echocardiographic contrast, which helped to assess the needle's location.

40|$|Background: The second-generation {{contrast}} agent Definity 2 ̆ 7 (R) (a <b>perflutren</b> microsphere) became available in Australia in mid- 2007.

30|$|Definity® (Lantheus Medical Imaging, Billerica, MA, USA) {{contrast}} agent is a <b>perflutren</b> microsphere {{with a mean}} diameter of 1.1 – 3.3  μm. It consists of a central core of octofluoropropane gas, a high molecular weight (188), biologically inert gas and a tri-lipid outer shell [12]. The inactivated ampoule of Definity contrast consists of the clear liquid lipid shell below and the gaseous core above. It requires activation in a VialMix® device, which agitates the ampoule at 4530 [*]±[*] 100 oscillations per minute for 45  s. This generates a solution of <b>perflutren</b> microsphere bubbles, which have an opaque, milky white appearance. Activation results in 1.3  ml of contrast. The activated contrast was then diluted to 50  ml with normal saline and infused using an Alaris® GH Plus (CareFusion, San Diego, CA, USA) infusion pump. Contrast was infused at two different rates, 150 and 300  ml/h. These rates were selected because 150  ml/h is the typical starting rate for a 50 -ml dilution and 300  ml/h is a typical infusion rate for technically difficult patients in the critical care complex.|$|E
40|$|ObjectivesTo compare acute {{mortality}} in critically ill hospitalized patients undergoing echocardiography {{with and without}} an ultrasound contrast agent (UCA). BackgroundBecause of serious cardiopulmonary reactions reported immediately after administration of perflutren-containing UCAs, the FDA required a black box safety warning for this class of agents, including <b>perflutren</b> protein-type A microspheres injectable suspension. MethodsThis study used the largest hospital service-level database in the U. S. All adult patients undergoing in-patient echocardiography between January 2003 and October 2005 were identified (n = 2, 588, 722, of which 22, 499 received <b>perflutren</b> protein-type A microspheres injectable suspension). Of the 22, 499 contrast echocardiography patients, 2, 900 had diagnoses meeting criteria for critical illness (heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, arrhythmia, respiratory failure, pulmonary embolism, emphysema, and pulmonary hypertension). To control for {{the differences between the}} contrast and noncontrast patients, we used propensity score matching. Variables used {{in the construction of the}} propensity score included comorbidities, demographic factors, hospital-specific factors, level of care, and mechanical ventilation status. Patients receiving contrast echocardiography were matched to 4 control patients who received noncontrast echocardiography. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate mortality effects. ResultsThere were 167 deaths in the study among critically ill patients, 38 of 2, 900 from the contrast group and 129 of 11, 600 from the control group. The contrast agent was not associated with an increase in same-day mortality (odds ratio: 1. 18; 95 % confidence interval: 0. 82 to 1. 71; p = 0. 37). Before matching, contrast patients showed greater morbidity than noncontrast patients (Deyo-Charlson comorbidity score 2. 45 vs. 2. 25, p &#x 003 C; 0. 0001). After propensity score matching, these differences were significantly reduced, showing that both groups were well balanced. ConclusionsThere is no increase in {{mortality in}} critically ill patients undergoing echocardiography with the UCA compared with case-matched control patients...|$|E
40|$|A 62 -year-old female with {{supraventricular}} tachycardia underwent a contrast echocardiogram to assess left ventricular {{structure and function}} due to sub-optimal images on conventional imaging. Multi-pulse, phase inversion, low mechanical index imaging was used (left ventricular opacification), combined with bolus dosing of a <b>perflutren</b> microsphere (Definity (R)). In the parasternal short-axis view, during contrast imaging, flow within a septal coronary artery could be directly visualized. The corresponding coronary angiogram demonstrated prominent septal perforators arising from the LAD artery. By exploiting the non-linear oscillation properties of microbubbles and the linear oscillation properties of tissue, at low MI, contrast-specific imaging {{has the ability to}} enhance the contrast signal while suppressing the myocardial signal. This form of contrast imaging has high temporal and spatial resolution, enabling visualization of relatively small structures in real time. Clinical relevance of this finding includes the ability to enhance coronary blood flow evaluation, which would have utility in those studies where spectral Doppler is being used to evaluate coronary blood flow and coronary flow reserve and it may be beneficial in the identification of septal perforator arteries that should be injected with alcohol during percutaneous septal ablation for the management of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy...|$|E
40|$|Aims Contrast-enhanced {{echocardiography}} {{is widely}} used to enhance left ventricular (LV) endocardial border delineation in stable patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease. In patients with acute myocardial infarction, accurate assessment of LV function and size is important, but data on the safety of contrast-enhanced echocardiography in the early stage of myocardial infarction (within 24 h) are lacking. In the current study, the experience on the safety of contrast-enhanced echo-cardiography within 24 h of acute myocardial infarction is reported. Methods and results A total of 115 consecutive patients (58 + 11 years; 77 % male) admitted to the coro-nary care unit for ST-elevation acute myocardial infarction underwent clinically indicated contrast-enhanced echocardiography within 24 h of hospital admission to assess LV size and function. <b>Perflutren</b> (Luminityw, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharma, Bruxelles, Belgium) was used as contrast agent.

40|$|Application of {{contrast}} echocardiography 503 such as during stress echocardiography, delineation of endocardial borders, and visualization of mural thrombus or PFO. 3 While TEE probes {{do not support}} harmonic imaging, which is often needed for bet-ter visualization {{of contrast}} agents, this does not preclude the use of contrast agents with TEE. In fact, this modality has been employed for the de-tection of left atrial appendage thrombi and even for aortic dissections. 4, 5 Within the context of endocarditis, TTE with contrast infusion has proven useful for evaluating complications arising from bacterial endocarditis. 6, 7 The agent used in these cases was agitated saline. Agitated saline disappears quickly, often not allowing for detailed evaluation of the structures of interest. Definity is a contrast agent based on <b>perflutren</b> lipid microspheres which, like agitated saline, remarkably enhance visualization of endocardial borders and in-tracardiac structures; however, Definity lasts longer (1 e 3 min), thus allowing more time for evaluating the regions under investigation against a contrasted background. In this way, {{we were able to}} determine that this patient’s vegetation was attached only to In summary, we report a case of right-sided endocarditis in which the use of contrast agent during TEE was instrumental in identifying the precise attachment sites of the vegetation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Serum {{levels of}} S- 100 B were {{investigated}} {{as a marker}} for infarct volume and response to treatment following acute ischemic stroke in rabbits. Following subselective angiography, rabbits (n= 31) were embolized by injection of a 3 -day-old blood clot (0. 6 x 4. 0 -mm) into the internal carotid artery. Treatment began 1 -hr post-embolization, groups included: Control (n= 8, embolization only), tissue plasminogen activator (tPA, n= 12, 0. 9 mg/kg), and <b>perflutren</b> lipid microbubbles with transcranial ultrasound (MB+US, n= 11, MB at 0. 16 mg/kg, US at 1 -MHz pulsed-wave, 0. 8 W/cm 2 for 1 -hr). Serum S- 100 B levels were significantly increased (P< 0. 01) 24 -hours following embolization in control (3. 1 -fold over baseline) and tPA (2. 9 -fold) groups, while treatment with MB+US resulted in an attenuated, non-significant (P= 0. 221) increase (1. 6 -fold). Twenty-four hour infarct volumes averaged 4. 76 %± 1. 16 % for controls, 2. 25 %± 0. 95 % for rabbits treated with tPA (P= 0. 32 vs. control), and 0. 79 %± 0. 99 % for rabbits treated with MB+US (P= 0. 04 vs. control). Twenty-four hour concentrations of S- 100 B were positively correlated with infarct volume (r= 0. 59, P= 0. 0004) ...|$|E

30|$|Modern {{ultrasound}} contrast {{agents are}} composed of <b>perflutren</b> gas within a stabilising lipid shell. These agents oscillate at a harmonic frequency, and this harmonic can be isolated to produce an image that is almost solely related to the contrast agent with little input from the underlying tissue. Ultrasound contrast agents (UCAs) are administered intravenously, are purely intravascular due to their size of 5 – 10 microns and lack the extracellular phase of CT and MRI contrast agents. Following injection, continuous scanning can be performed, and the phases of contrast are broadly divided into arterial (10 – 25  s), portal venous (30 – 120  s) and late phases (over 120  s) [1], although some variability occurs depending upon the patient’s cardiac function. Further injections can be performed after a delay of 5 – 10  min. Usually only {{a small proportion of}} each dose is injected. For example, Definity (Lantheus, North Billerica, MA) is packaged in a 1.5  ml vial, but typical injections are 0.2 – 0.4  cc each followed by a 5 – 10  ml saline flush. SonoVue (Bracco Milano, Italy) is a sulphur hexofluride agent licensed for use in Europe and is typically diluted in 5  cc of normal saline before being administered in 1.0 – 2.5  cc aliquots. Splitting the dose allows multiple runs to be performed per vial and also minimises attenuation of deep structures that can occur with high contrast doses. Further information regarding UCAs is available in Guidelines produced by the European Federation of Societies for Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology (EFSUMB) [2].|$|E
40|$|The {{anabolic}} {{effects of}} nutrition on skeletal muscle {{may depend on}} adequate skeletal muscle perfusion, which is impaired in older people. Cocoa flavanols {{have been shown to}} improve flow-mediated dilation, an established measure of endothelial function. However, their effect on muscle microvascular blood flow is currently unknown. Therefore, the objective {{of this study was to}} explore links between the consumption of cocoa flavanols, muscle microvascular blood flow and muscle protein synthesis (MPS) in response to nutrition in older men. To achieve this objective leg blood flow (LBF), muscle microvascular blood volume (MBV) and MPS were measured under postabsorptive and postprandial (I. V glamin, dextrose to sustain glucose ~ 7. 5 mmol·l- 1) conditions in 20 older men. Ten of these men were studied with no cocoa flavanol intervention and a further 10 were studied with the addition of 350 mg of cocoa flavanols at the same time as nutrition began. Leg [femoral artery] blood flow was measured by Doppler ultrasound, muscle MBV by contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) using DefinityTM <b>perflutren</b> contrast agent and MPS using [1, 2 - 13 C 2] leucine tracer techniques. Our results show that although older individuals do not show an increase in LBF or MBV in response to feeding, these absent responses are apparent when cocoa flavanols are given acutely with nutrition. However this restoration in vascular responsiveness is not associated with improved MPS responses to nutrition. We conclude that acute cocoa flavanol supplementation improves muscle macro- and microvascular responses to nutrition, independently of modifying muscle protein anabolism...|$|E
40|$|Background and Purpose—Microbubbles (MB) {{combined}} with ultrasound (US) {{have been shown}} to lyse clots without tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) both in vitro and in vivo. We evaluated sonothrombolysis with 3 types of MB using a rabbit embolic stroke model. Methods—New Zealand White rabbits (n 74) received internal carotid angiographic embolization of single 3 -day-old cylindrical clots (0. 64. 0 mm). Groups included: (1) control (n 11) embolized without treatment; (2) tPA (n 20); (3) tPAUS (n 10); (4) <b>perflutren</b> lipid MBUS (n 16); (5) albumin 3 m MBUS (n 8); and (6) tagged albumin 3 m MBUS (n 9). Treatment began 1 hour postembolization. Ultrasound was pulsed-wave (1 MHz; 0. 8 W/cm 2) for 1 hour; rabbits with tPA received intravenous tPA (0. 9 mg/kg) over 1 hour. Lipid MB dose was intravenous (0. 16 mg/kg) over 30 minutes. Dosage of 3 m MB was 5109 MB intravenously alone or tagged with eptifibatide and fibrin antibody over 30 minutes. Rabbits were euthanized at 24 hours. Infarct volume was determined using vital stains on brain sections. Hemorrhage was evaluated on hematoxylin and eosin sections. Results—Infarct volume percent was lower for rabbits treated with lipid MBUS (1. 0 % 0. 6 %; P 0. 013), 3 m MBUS (0. 7 % 0. 9 %; P 0. 018), and tagged 3 m MBUS (0. 8 % 0. 8 %; P 0. 019) compared with controls (3. 5 % 0. 8 %). The 3 MB types collectively had lower infarct volumes (P 0. 0043) than controls.

40|$|ObjectivesThis study {{evaluated}} {{the capacity of}} ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction (UTMD) to deliver angiogenic genes, improve perfusion, and recruit progenitor cells after a myocardial infarction (MI) in mice. BackgroundAngiogenic gene therapy after an MI may become a clinically relevant approach to improve the engraftment of implanted cells if targeted delivery can be accomplished noninvasively. The UTMD technique uses myocardial contrast echocardiography to target plasmid gene delivery to the myocardium and features low toxicity, limited immunogenicity, {{and the potential for}} repeated application. MethodsEmpty plasmids (control group) or those containing genes for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), stem cell factor (SCF), or green fluorescent protein (to visualize gene delivery) were incubated with <b>perflutren</b> lipid microbubbles. The microbubble-deoxyribonucleic acid mixture was injected intravenously into C 57 BL/ 6 mice at 7 days after coronary artery ligation (MI). The UTMD technique facilitated transgene release into the myocardium. Twenty-one days after MI, myocardial perfusion and function were assessed by contrast echocardiography. Protein expression was quantified by Western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Flow cytometry quantified progenitor cell recruitment to the heart. Blood vessel density was evaluated immunohistochemically. ResultsGreen fluorescent protein expression in the infarcted myocardium demonstrated gene delivery. Myocardial VEGF and SCF levels increased significantly in the respective groups (p < 0. 05). The physiologic impact of VEGF and SCF gene delivery was confirmed by increased myocardial recruitment of VEGF receptor 2 – and SCF receptor (c-kit) –expressing cells, respectively (p < 0. 05). Consequently, capillary and arteriolar density (Factor VIII and alpha-smooth muscle actin staining), myocardial perfusion, and cardiac function were all enhanced (p < 0. 01 relative to control group) in recipients of VEGF or SCF. ConclusionsNoninvasive UTMD successfully delivered VEGF and SCF genes into the infarcted heart, increased vascular density, and improved myocardial perfusion and ventricular function. The UTMD technique may be an ideal method for noninvasive, repeated gene delivery after an MI...|$|E
