25|$|In 1993, the Illinois Senator made {{headlines}} when she convinced the Senate Judiciary Committee not to renew a design patent for the United Daughters of the Confederacy because it contained the Confederate flag. The patent had been routinely renewed {{for nearly a}} century, and despite the Judiciary Committee’s disapproval, the Senate was poised to pass a resolution sponsored by Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina that included a provision to authorize {{the extension of the}} federal patent. Moseley Braun threatened to filibuster the legislation “until this room freezes over.” She also made a plea to her colleagues about the symbolism of the Confederate flag, declaring, “It has no <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> modern times, place in this body, <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> society.” Swayed by Moseley Braun’s argument, the Senate rejected the UDC’s application to renew its patent.|$|E

25|$|Curiously, Stirling has {{set this}} novel in 1998 placing us firmly within {{the realms of}} {{alternative}} history. The reason {{for the use of}} this device is not clear, as it doesn't really impact upon the progress of the narrative. Perhaps the author sought after a sense of immediacy garnered by making the events take <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> past rather than our future. Perhaps he sought to avoid the work being viewed as a prediction of things to come – an obvious trap for many speculative works.|$|E
25|$|In , ElBaradei {{said that}} the {{changing}} landscape of nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament may be defined {{by the emergence of}} an extensive black market in nuclear material and equipment, the proliferation of nuclear weapons and sensitive nuclear technology, and the stagnation in nuclear disarmament. To combat proliferation, ElBaradei has suggested keeping nuclear and radiological material {{out of the hands of}} extremist groups, tightening control over the operations for producing the nuclear material that could be used in weapons, and accelerating disarmament efforts. ElBaradei also stated that only one percent of the money spent to develop new weapons would be enough to feed the entire world and that, if we hope to escape self-destruction, nuclear weapons should have no <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> collective conscience and no role in our security.|$|E
25|$|We felt keenly {{that while}} the miraculous events of the {{founding}} of the State of Israel had found fitting expression {in the other Conservative siddurim} the more difficult experience of the Holocaust had yet to find an appropriate <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> prayers, Therefore, we composed a Nahum prayer for Yom Ha-shoah, inspired by that which appeared in Siddur Va-ani Tefillati of the Masorti Movement in 1998. In an insert into the Amidah, similar to that used traditionally on Tisha B'Av, we seek God's comfort in light of our people's losses in Europe during the Holocaust. We felt the need, beyond that, to acknowledge on a daily basis the enormous effect that the Holocaust has had upon our people. At the end of Tahanun papers, in a prayer which reflects our suffering, we added reference to the anguish we still feel.|$|E

500|$|On 20 December 2007, Arabella Churchill, an {{instrumental}} {{figure in the}} conception of the 1971 festival and since the 1980s area coordinator of the Theatre Field, died at St Edmund's Cottages, Bove Town, Glastonbury {{at the age of}} 58. She had suffered a short illness due to pancreatic cancer, for which she had refused chemotherapy and radiotherapy. She was a convert to Buddhism, and arrangements following her death respected her belief. Michael Eavis, paying tribute to her after her death, said [...] "Her vitality and great sense of morality and social responsibility have given her a <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> festival history second to none".|$|E

500|$|On 8 August 2007, Wilders opined in an {{open letter}} to the Dutch {{newspaper}} De Volkskrant that the Koran, which he called a [...] "fascist book", should be outlawed in the Netherlands, like Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf. He has stated that [...] "The book incites hatred and killing and therefore has no <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> legal order". He has also referred to Mohammed as [...] "the devil". In September 2009, Wilders proposed putting what he called a [...] "head rag tax" [...] on Hijab wearing by Muslim women; he suggested that women could purchase a license for €1000 and that the money raised could be used in projects beneficial to women's emancipation.|$|E

500|$|Moran was {{in favor}} of {{stronger}} prohibitions against animal fighting. [...] He sponsored legislation to penalize those who [...] "knowingly attend animal fights and allow minors to attend." [...] He sponsored legislation limiting federal funding for horse slaughter inspection plants, effectively preventing the practice. [...] In the past he promoted reinstating a five-year ban on slaughtering horses for food, noting that [...] "horses hold an important <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> nation's history and culture... they deserve to be cared for, not killed for foreign consumption." [...] Moran in the past promoted safer keeping and treatment of exotic animals used in circus performances. In October 2014, Moran received the Lord Houghton Award from Cruelty Free International for his service and contribution to animal welfare.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} was well received {{in part because}} of her sex appeal. For that reason, Sniper Wolf ranked as 37th [...] "hottest babe in games" [...] by GameDaily in 2008 and was included in UGO's list of the 50 [...] "hottest babes in games" [...] in 2011. She was ranked as the tenth sexiest PlayStation character by PlayStation Universe in 2010, who added that [...] "this character takes a special <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> hearts," [...] and in 2014 was included among the top 10 [...] "hottest" [...] female villains in gaming and [...] "old school hotties that still got it" [...] by Cheat Code Central's Travis Huber, who stated that [...] "she was so loved and talked about that Hideo Kojima and the gang have had to create yet another beautiful but deadly sniper character in the upcoming MGSV: The Phantom Pain." ...|$|E
500|$|On October 3, 2015, in {{a preseason}} {{game against the}} Ducks, Torres was {{assessed}} a match penalty for a late, illegal check {{to the head of}} forward Jakob Silfverberg. The NHL stated the hit would be under review, and, on October 5, Torres was suspended a record 41 games by the league, half of the regular season. Torres forfeited $440,860.29 in salary, which was deposited into the Players' Emergency Assistance Fund. While the record for longest suspension is held by Billy Coutu, who was suspended for life in 1927, Torres holds the distinction of the longest non-lifetime ban, which was previously held by Chris Simon for an incident in 2007. This is also the longest-ever NHL suspension for a hit on another player. Torres did not appeal the suspension and apologized to Silfverberg. Sharks general manager Doug Wilson supported the suspension, saying Torres' hit was [...] "unacceptable and has no <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> game." ...|$|E

500|$|Some media commentators, such as Howard Kurtz and Toby Harnden, criticized {{what they}} {{perceived}} as {{a rush to judgment}} about the shooter's motivation, disputing suggestions that the shooting {{was the result of the}} Tea Party movement or anything in connection to Palin. Paul Krugman wrote an op-ed piece arguing that political rhetoric had become toxic. With renewed calls to tone down political rhetoric after the shooting, Keith Olbermann said, [...] "Violence, or the threat of violence, has no <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> Democracy, and I apologize for and repudiate any act or any thing in my past that may have even inadvertently encouraged violence." [...] Jon Stewart stated that he did not know whether or not the political environment contributed to the shooting, but, [...] "For all the hyperbole and vitriol that's become a part of our political process—when the reality of that rhetoric, when actions match the disturbing nature of words, we haven't lost our capacity to be horrified. ... Maybe it helps us to remember to match our rhetoric with reality more often." ...|$|E
500|$|Partly in {{reaction}} to such theories, another school of thought emerged which argued that Arthur had no historical existence at all. Morris's Age of Arthur prompted the archaeologist Nowell Myres to observe that [...] "no figure on the borderline of history and mythology has wasted more of the historian's time". Gildas' 6th-century polemic De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae (On the Ruin and Conquest of Britain), written within living memory of Badon, mentions the battle but does not mention Arthur. Arthur is {{not mentioned in the}} Anglo-Saxon Chronicle or named in any surviving manuscript written between 400 and 820. He is absent from Bede's early-8th-century Ecclesiastical History of the English People, another major early source for post-Roman history that mentions Badon. The historian David Dumville has written: [...] "I think we can dispose of him [...] quite briefly. He owes his <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> history books to a 'no smoke without fire' school of thought... The {{fact of the matter is}} that there is no historical evidence about Arthur; we must reject him from our histories and, above all, from the titles of our books." ...|$|E
500|$|Sega had {{implemented}} its own voluntary ratings system, the Videogame Rating Council (VRC), {{largely to}} rate games released {{for its own}} consoles. Mortal Kombat and Night Trap were rated [...] "MA-13" [...] and [...] "MA-17" [...] on Sega's scale respectively. During the hearings, Howard Lincoln and Bill White (chairmen of Nintendo and Sega's U.S. divisions respectively) attacked each other's stances on objectionable content in video games; Lincoln condemned Sega for even releasing Night Trap and felt it [...] "simply has no <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> society", while White argued that Sega was more responsible to consumers because they actually had a rating system in place, rather than a blanket presumption that all its games would be suitable for general audiences. Fragmentation would also develop in the classification of games; The 3DO Company created their own age-based rating system, the 3DO Rating System, for games released on its 3DO Interactive Multiplayer platform, and the Recreational Software Advisory Council (RSAC) was formed for rating PC games, which used a system that rated the intensity of specific classes of objectionable content, but did not use age recommendations. However, Lieberman {{did not believe that}} these systems were sufficient, and in February 1994, threatened to propose the creation of a federal commission for regulating and rating video games.|$|E

500|$|In 2001, The Beaumont Enterprise cited Tifa as {{an example}} of a strong female {{character}} in video games in the wake of Lara Croft's introduction. In 2008, Joystiq named her their top pick out of 20 characters from the Final Fantasy franchise they wished to see in Square Enix's crossover fighting game Dissidia Final Fantasy, describing her as one of the series' [...] "greatest heroines." [...] IGN listed Tifa as the 13th-best Final Fantasy character of all time in 2008, describing her as an attempt by Square to [...] "give Final Fantasy characters real sex appeal," [...] and someone who [...] "could take care of herself in a pinch"; in a follow-up Reader's Choice edition of the list, Tifa placed first, with the staff repeating their previous comments while attributing her placement on the list to her breasts. In a 2009 IGN article focusing solely on Final Fantasy VII characters, Tifa placed fourth, with a comment that while her sex appeal contributes to her popularity, [...] "Tifa helped drive a tradition of tough, independent RPG heroines." [...] Other sources too praised Tifa for that aspect of her character. Mania Entertainment placed her tenth in the 2010 list of [...] "video game women that kick ass," [...] stating that while subsequent games in the Final Fantasy series introduced other memorable female characters, [...] "Tifa is our first Final Fantasy girl and holds a special <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> hearts."

500|$|Casting Crowns' lead vocalist, Mark Hall, {{commented on}} the lyrical content of the song, stating that: [...] "For believers, in context with our other songs, the {{messages}} are that God wants to use you, He wants you to grow and He wants {{you to have a}} purpose". Hall elaborated that: [...] "There are a trilogy of songs and messages that go together on the album. , “Glorious Day,” and “To Know You.” [...] reminds me to be more intentional about what I do. I {{may not be able to}} get on a plane and fly to China and give out Bibles and preach the gospel, but how can I witness to my co-workers and my friends and my family." [...] The portion of the chorus that says [...] "like voices in the wilderness we're crying out" [...] is a reference to John the Baptist; Hall said that one of his favorite characters in the New Testament was John the Baptist, and commented that [...] "he [...] was so black and white. This is wrong, and this is right. And he was speaking into a grey world, saying black and white things, and it cost him his life". He elaborated on that, commenting that: [...] "Until the whole world hears are the lines and the things that John the Baptist said into a culture that did not want to hear it. And we've got to be in a <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> walk with Jesus that he's filled us to where we step into something that's unpopular and we can speak the truth, but that we can also speak it in love. We've got to live in such a way that I have the purpose that John had".|$|E
500|$|The {{political}} climate in the United States and in Arizona {{in particular was}} pointed to by some observers as a possible contributing factor for the violent act. For example, Clarence Dupnik, Pima County Sheriff, initially expressed concern that overheated political rhetoric and violence may be related, observing, [...] "When you look at unbalanced people, how they respond to the vitriol {{that comes out of}} certain mouths about tearing down the government. The anger, the hatred, the bigotry that goes on in this country is getting to be outrageous." [...] He believed that Arizona had unfortunately become [...] "the capital" [...] of such feelings. [...] "We have become the mecca for prejudice and bigotry," [...] he said. But, Dupnik later said that he had no evidence that the killings were a result of anything particular which Loughner may have read or heard. International media referred to the {{political climate}} in the United States and the Palin map in particular. The French newspaper Le Monde said that the attack seemed to confirm [...] "an alarming premonition that has been gaining momentum for a long time: that the verbal and symbolic violence that the most radical right-wing opponents have used in their clash with the Obama administration would at some point lead to tragic physical violence." [...] President Obama called the shooting an [...] "unspeakable tragedy", adding that [...] "such a senseless and terrible act of violence has no place in a free society". Arizona Governor Jan Brewer called the attack [...] "senseless and cruel violence" [...] and House Speaker John Boehner said, [...] "An attack on one who serves is an attack on all who serve. Acts and threats of violence against public officials have no <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> society". Chief Justice John Roberts issued a statement noting, [...] "we in the judiciary have suffered the terrible loss of one of our own", with the death of Chief Judge John Roll.|$|E
