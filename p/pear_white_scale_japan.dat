25|$|Such white-silvery scales {{can also}} be found on the tarsus, {{particularly}} on the hind legs that are commonly suspended in the air. The bases of tarsomeres I through IV have a ring of <b>white</b> <b>scales,</b> creating the appearance of white and black rings. On the fore legs and middle legs, only the first three tarsomeres have the ring of <b>white</b> <b>scales,</b> whereas tarsomere V on the hind legs is completely white. The femur of each leg is also black with <b>white</b> <b>scales</b> {{on the end of the}} “knee”.

50|$|Compared {{to other}} {{sparkling}} wines, Prosecco {{is low in}} alcohol, about 11 to 12 percent by volume. The flavor of Prosecco {{has been described as}} intensely aromatic and crisp, bringing to mind yellow apple, <b>pear,</b> <b>white</b> peach, and apricot. Unlike Champagne, appreciated for its rich taste and complex secondary aromas, most Prosecco variants have intense primary aromas and are meant to taste fresh, light and comparatively simple. The view that Prosecco cannot be aged has been challenged by other experts, as a recent vertical tasting going back to 1983 demonstrates the longevity of the wines from one of their top producers.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 22 mm. The head is grey-brown and the antennae are dark brown, with some <b>white</b> <b>scales.</b> The thorax and tegulae are grey-brown, although the mesothorax is mixed whitish in the dorsal parts. The forewings are costally brown-grey and dorsally mixed with numerous <b>white</b> <b>scales.</b> The markings are dark brown. The hindwings are grey-brown and the fringes are brown-grey.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 16-17 mm. The forewings are greyish brown, {{sprinkled with}} greyish <b>white</b> <b>scales.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 25 mm. The forewings are tannish white, {{with a very}} light scattering of linear <b>white</b> <b>scales.</b> The hindwings are clear-translucent, with very scattered <b>white</b> linear <b>scales</b> above and below. Adults are possibly on wing in July.|$|R
50|$|The {{length of}} the {{forewings}} is 5-7 mm for males and 6.5-7 mm for females. Adult males have smooth, brownish fuscous to black forewings, sometimes with a few scattered <b>white</b> <b>scales.</b> The forewings of the females are usually light in colour, with <b>white</b> <b>scales</b> along the costa and scattered over the distal half. Adults are on wing from November to March, probably in one generation per year.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 15-17 mm. The forewings {{are dark}} fuscous, slightly purplish-tinged. The stigmata are black, the plical slightly beyond the first discal, both these edged posteriorly {{with a few}} <b>white</b> <b>scales,</b> the second discal mixed with <b>white</b> <b>scales.</b> There is an obscure pale whitish-ochreous dot on the costa at four-fifths, with traces of a very faint sinuate transverse line from it. The hindwings are grey.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 19 mm. Adults {{are very similar}} to Acleris robinsoniana, but with lessprominent pure <b>white</b> <b>scaling</b> on the rear portion of the thorax and with the basal area of the forewing rather evenly dull grey-brown without contrasting <b>white</b> <b>scaling</b> or obscuring blackish shading frequently found in robinsoniana forms. Adults have been recorded on wing in February and from August to September.|$|R
50|$|The {{species name}} {{refers to the}} narrow band of <b>white</b> <b>scales</b> on the {{underside}} of the hindwings.|$|R
30|$|Eyespot body {{behavior}} and white spot behavior are different and separable, although the same cells may function to organize both in many instances. The size of white spots in adults {{does not necessarily}} reflect the degrees of organizing activity for eyespots. Because white coloration of <b>white</b> <b>scales</b> is structural rather than pigment-based, the differentiation mechanism for <b>white</b> <b>scales</b> may be independent from that for black or other pigmented scales.|$|R

50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 12-13 mm. The forewings are fuscous, {{sprinkled with}} dark fuscous {{and a few}} <b>white</b> <b>scales,</b> {{as well as with}} a broad reddish-ochreous streak along the costa from the base to three-fourths, the lower edge irregular and partially margined with <b>white</b> <b>scales.</b> There is a streak of blackish irroration beneath this from two-fifths to the extremity, with a short whitish-edged projection upwards halfway, and marked with a white dot representing the second discal stigma. There is also a streak of blackish irroration along the fold, marked with two or three white dots. A series of white dots alternating with black scales are found along the posterior half of the costa and the veins towards the termen tend to be lined with dark fuscous, with numerous scattered <b>white</b> <b>scales.</b> The hindwings are light grey.|$|R
50|$|The {{veins of}} the {{forewings}} are delineated by <b>white</b> <b>scales.</b> The subterminal and antemedial lines are white. The hindwings are uniform grey.|$|R

5000|$|Achyrachaena mollis is {{a flower}} which grows to {{approximately}} {{one foot in}} height on a strong, straight stem. Atop the stem is a large, rounded bud which opens into a spherical cluster of flowers. The actual flowers are small and yellow and nearly invisible behind the showy fruits, which extend shiny bright <b>white</b> <b>scales</b> which look like long rectangular flower petals. These silky <b>white</b> <b>scales</b> catch the wind, which allows the single-seeded fruits to be dispersed.|$|R
50|$|This {{mosquito}} has distinct {{white and}} black stripes along its body which help differentiate the genus from others in this family. Females of this species are ectoparasites and can most often be found on mammals living in the tropical forests of Africa. The africanus species can be distinguished from other mosquitoes in the genus Aedes by having <b>white</b> <b>scales</b> on the maxillary palpi, scutum with a patch of large <b>white</b> <b>scales,</b> and 3 large white patches on the mid-femur.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 14-17 mm {{for males}} and 15-18 mm for females. The head, thorax, forewing and abdomen are finely speckled with <b>white</b> and grey <b>scales</b> or white-tipped grey scales, with a wide colour range from pale (predominantly <b>white</b> <b>scales)</b> to dark grey.|$|R
