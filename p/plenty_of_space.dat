5|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, red-tailed black {{cockatoos}} fetched prices of $1750 in Australia and $8900 (~US$6000) overseas. Hand-raised birds {{can be bought}} for anywhere between $15,000 to $40,000 in the United States, where they are seldom seen in aviculture. Hand-reared birds are able to learn a few words and can be quite affectionate, although males may become imprinted and unlikely to breed. The red-tailed black cockatoo is the most commonly seen of the black cockatoos in captivity, and can be hardy and long-lived if given <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>space.</b> Until now, most birds in captivity have been of subspecies C. b. banksii and C. b. samueli. Birds were often previously bred without much attention to subspecies of origin. However, {{with an increase in}} interest in conservation, more aviculturists are concerned about maintaining the integrity of the separate subspecies in cultivation, and so avoid crossbreeding.|$|E
5|$|Rodents {{including}} guinea pigs, mice, rats, hamsters, gerbils, chinchillas, degus and chipmunks make convenient pets {{able to live}} {{in small}} spaces, each species with its own qualities. Most are normally kept in cages of suitable sizes and have varied requirements for space and social interaction. If handled from a young age, they are usually docile and do not bite. Guinea pigs have a long lifespan and need a large cage. Rats also need <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>space</b> and can become very tame, can learn tricks and seem to enjoy human companionship. Mice are short-lived but take up very little space. Hamsters are solitary but tend to be nocturnal. They have interesting behaviors, but unless handled regularly they may be defensive. Gerbils are not usually aggressive, rarely bite and are sociable animals that enjoy the company of humans and their own kind.|$|E

25|$|A {{variation}} of the W–M formation was the M–U formation used to great effect by the Hungary national team against England in 1953, when they became the first non-British side to beat England at the old Wembley Stadium. This formation was so-called because of the deep-lying centre-forward Nándor Hidegkuti, used to draw the opposition centre-back out of position, leaving <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>space</b> between the full-backs for the inside-forwards Ferenc Puskás and Sándor Kocsis to exploit.|$|E
30|$|Remark 3.13. It {{is worth}} {{to mention that}} our results are nontrivial generalizations of the {{corresponding}} known fixed point results in the setting <b>of</b> Banach <b>spaces</b> because there are <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>spaces</b> which are not normable (see, [[7], p. 113]).

25|$|Tings {{were huge}} open-air events, which {{required}} <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>space.</b> The more important ting that king Olof talked about {{was probably the}} Ting of all Swedes, which {{was held at the}} end of February in Uppsala, during the Disting. The king was obliged to obey the common decisions made at this ting, and the most powerful man at this assembly was not the king, but the lawspeaker of Tiundaland. Locally important tings were the Westrogothic Ting of all Geats in Skara and the Ostrogothic Lionga ting in the vicinity of today's Linköping.|$|E
25|$|The crusaders {{organized}} into five divisions: the Burgundians, Raymond and the Byzantines, the Germans, the French, and the Lombards. The Turks nearly destroyed the crusaders’ army near {{the mountains of}} Paphlagonia at Mersivan. The land was well-suited to the Turks—dry and inhospitable for their enemy, it was open, with <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>space</b> for their cavalry units. The Turks had been troublesome to the Latins for some days, at last making certain that they went where Kilij Arslan I {{wanted them to be}} and making sure that they only found a small amount of supplies.|$|E
25|$|Switching the attack: Using a 'square' or 'cross' pass {{across the}} whole width of the pitch to a player in <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>space</b> is a very {{effective}} way of both relieving pressure and building a fresh attack. The defending team {{will be required to}} adjust its positions and this usually creates spaces which can be exploited. In this example, the player numbered 1 has moved out of position, allowing more space for the opposing player. By playing the ball to the other side (the curved line represents an aerial pass), the recipient of the pass finds themselves in space which can be exploited.|$|E
30|$|There are <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>spaces</b> {{which are}} not normable (see [[21], p. 113]).

25|$|While the new 19-story Capitol {{building}} {{was expected to}} have <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>space</b> for years to come, it quickly filled as the Government of the state expanded. The Liberty Memorial Building, which was completed in 1924, was able to contain some of the additional workers, but more space was needed by 1955 when construction was begun for the State Office Building. The building originally housed the Bismarck Junior College, but the Legislature purchased it in 1959. The 1960s {{was a period of}} rapid development of the grounds. In 1960, the new North Dakota Governor's Residence was built on the grounds to replace the old residence which was beginning to deteriorate. In 1980, the North Dakota Heritage Center was built to accommodate the expanding State Historical Society of North Dakota, and in 1968, the North Dakota Department of Transportation {{building was}} built to provide more office space for that agency. It is the last new building built as of 2007, although a Judicial Wing was added onto the base of the Capitol tower in 1977 (completed in 1981). While the space needed by state government has increased since the original construction of the Capitol in the 1930s, the state's population has decreased since that time.|$|E
500|$|Another {{method of}} {{peaceful}} protesting was {{demonstrated in the}} formation of Camp Solidarity which was located {{in the center of the}} protesting, in southern Virginia. Supporters came from all over the country to show their outrage against the actions of Pittston but there was no place that they could stay. Although many people in the local towns would offer shelter, they could not provide enough beds and food for all the people who came. Union member supporters found a solution to the problem. [...] A local recreational park near Castlewood, Virginia was turned into a campground where these supporters could stay. A small shelter equipped with bunk beds was built and an already existing snack bar was opened to provide food for the people staying at Camp Solidarity. Because the location was a recreational park, there was <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>space</b> for others to bring campers and tents into the area.|$|E
500|$|The {{layout of}} the [...] long {{anti-clockwise}} track was revealed on 17 October. Nelson Piquet Jr. felt {{it would be a}} fast circuit because it was purpose-built for motor racing and other series had visited the track before. He described it as seeming like it would be slightly wider and easier along with relying less on driver skill and making competitive racing closer. Heidfeld stated that the track layout would mean the drivers would be challenged on electrical energy management and there would a high chance of a full course yellow flag being shown or a safety car being deployed because of the large amount of barriers lining the circuit. José María López, who raced on the track in the WTCC, said it would be [...] "tricky" [...] having been used to touring cars which require more space and it would feel wider with Formula E vehicles and there would be <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>space</b> for overtaking manoeuvres.|$|E

500|$|Delius later {{liked to}} {{represent}} his house at Solano Grove as [...] "a shanty", {{but it was}} a substantial cottage of four rooms, with <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>space</b> for Delius to entertain guests. Ward sometimes stayed there, as did an old Bradford friend, Charles Douglas, and Delius's brother Ernest. Protected from excessive summer heat by river breezes and a canopy of oak trees, the house was an agreeable place to live in. Delius paid little attention to the business of growing oranges, and continued to pursue his musical interests. Jacksonville had a rich, though to a European, unorthodox musical life. Randel notes that in local hotels, the African-American waiters doubled as singers, with daily vocal concerts for patrons and passers-by, giving Delius his introduction to spirituals. Additionally, ship owners encouraged their deckhands to sing as they worked. [...] "Delius never forgot the singing as he heard it, day or night, carried sweet and clear across the water to his verandah at Solano Grove, whenever a steam-ship passed; {{it is hard to imagine}} conditions less conducive to cultivating oranges—or more conducive to composing." ...|$|E
500|$|A further development, {{known as}} Hazel Court (after Alfred Hazel, {{principal}} 1925–1944), {{was built in}} 2000, bringing {{the total number of}} students who can be housed at the sports ground to 135. Writing in the Royal Institute of British Architects Journal in 2002, Jeremy Melvin praised the architects of Hazel Court, Maguire & Co., for their [...] "crispness of detail" [...] and [...] "richness of composition"; he said that [...] "the sense of ordered space... recalls {{the way in which the}} traditional collegiate quads gave architectural expression to the then-new idea of a university". He noted that, whilst the first impression of the houses was Elizabethan with the air of a courtyard garden, [...] "closer inspection reveals a contemporary design sensibility"; there was, he wrote, [...] "the impression of an order that comes from making the construction explicit whils combining sensitivity to function and use". However, he commented that whilst there was <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>space</b> inside, the furniture [...] "would not look out of place in a motorway hotel".|$|E
2500|$|To {{enable the}} {{necessary}} routing, the City of Norfolk's civic leaders provided a [...] long right-of-way around their city through rural Norfolk County. Page-Rogers' interests purchased 1000 feet (300 m) of the waterfront and [...] of adjoining land. There would be <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>space</b> {{for the new}} coal pier, storage yards, tracks, and support facilities at Sewell's Point.

2500|$|Jamsetji's {{plan for}} the city was clear. He envisioned {{far more than a}} mere row of workers hutments.

As a result, many areas in the city are well planned and there are public leisure places such as the Jubilee Park. While building the city, Jamsetji Tata had said, [...] "Be sure to lay wide streets planted with shady trees, every other of a quick-growing variety.
