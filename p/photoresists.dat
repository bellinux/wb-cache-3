25|$|In other words, {{the less}} {{absorbing}} the resist, the more vertically uniform the absorption. Conventionally, <b>photoresists</b> are made as transparent {{as possible to}} strive for this vertical uniformity, which enables straighter resist profiles.

40|$|Silylation is {{a surface}} imaging {{technique}} which allows silicon to absorb into <b>photoresist</b> in specified areas. <b>Photoresist</b> containing silicon creates a hard-mask which is resistant to oxygen plasma. This {{allows for the}} development process to occur strictly in dry etch systems. Surface imaging is a desirable technique because it removes the need to expose through the <b>photoresist</b> stack. Traditional lithography techniques require a high dose of ultra-violet (UV) light in order to penetrate {{to the bottom of}} a <b>photoresist</b> stack. It is critical, for quality imaging, that the <b>photoresist</b> not be over or under exposed. This creates a process window dependent on two main variables; the <b>photoresist</b> thickness and the dose needed to penetrate through the <b>photoresist</b> stack. Surface imaging allows for a larger process window because the dose is not depended on the thickness of the resist. In surface imaging, the UV light only exposes the top-most layer of the <b>photoresist</b> material. Surface imaging removes the resist thickness variable, this will allow for a wider process window. Variation in <b>photoresist</b> thickness is also important; traditional lithography requires a uniform <b>photoresist</b> thickness {{across the surface of the}} wafer in order to optimize depth of focus (DOF). Surface imaging tends to be less effected by <b>photoresist</b> variation due to short depth requirements of the exposure.
