However, the common information for designers to select specific device has not gathered. Therefore, a full scale vibration test was conducted to grasp the difference of the isolated response by replacing only base-isolated devices system using common superstructure on the shaking table in which three directional simultaneous vibrations was possible. The base-isolated system used for this test was 2 kinds of ball bearing type and one slide type, which had been used for actual base-isolated houses. The result of the test tells that each devices system fulfills the basic performance demanded for base-isolated houses; response acceleration was reduced to input acceleration, and damage on superstructure was not found. Each devices system is evaluated from the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>response</b> of each input wave, influence of vertical simultaneous vibration...|$|E

Since this information is created by volunteers, its reliability and credibility issues bring restriction on use of them as main source of information. The available methods of VGI credibility assessment mainly focus on meta data analysis, VGI spatial pattern analysis and comparison of VGI data with reference data. This paper thoroughly discusses recent development in these three groups of VGI assessment methods. At the end we highlighted several research gaps and potentials of combining and improving these methods to support flood hazard mapping...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThere {{is growing}} {{interest}} regarding {{the role of}} the right inferior frontal gyrus (RIFG) during a particular form of executive control referred to as response inhibition. However, tasks used to examine neural activity at the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>response</b> inhibition have rarely controlled for the potentially confounding effects of attentional demand. In particular, it is unclear whether the RIFG is specifically involved in inhibitory control, or is involved more generally in the detection of salient or task relevant cues. The current fMRI study sought to clarify {{the role of the}} RIFG in executive control by holding the stimulus conditions {{of one of the most}} popular response inhibition tasks–the Stop Signal Task–constant, whilst varying the response that was required on reception of the stop signal cue. Our results reveal that the RIFG is recruited when important cues are detected, regardless of whether that detection is followed by the inhibition of a motor response, the generation of a motor response, or no external response at all...|$|E

40|$|Gasses and fluids are transported via an {{extensive}} infrastructure of steel pipelines. In {{the design of}} pipeline systems the use of elbows (pipe bends) is important because their flexibility makes them able to sustain significant deformations. These bends can be subjected to permanent deformations due to various load combinations {{which can lead to}} progressive material damage. There are three stages commonly observed in ductile damage: void nucleation, growth and coalescence. When subjected to varying bending loads low cycle fatigue damage may occur. Within this research project Finite Element Analysis is used to simulate the response of pipeline bends. Two element types are implemented to model a pipe bend, the classical shell element and an efficient tube element (pipe elbow element), respectively. To predict the structural response when subjected to monotonic loading a damage model is implemented for both elements. When subjected to cyclic loading three phases can be identified. During the first few cycles the permanent deformation increases rapidly. After some cycles, the rate of permanent deformation stabilizes until the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>response</b> degradation. In order to capture this response a new material model, based upon the afore mentioned model, is proposed. Experiments have indicated that this model is well suited to determine the point of material failure. Structural MechanicsCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
30|$|CANOVA is {{a measure}} for non linear {{correlation}} between two continuous variables, as an extension to ANOVA for continuous variables by making generalization on “within category variance”. CANOVA first define a neighborhood for each data <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>response</b> variable based on its predictor value, and then the variance of the response value within the neighborhood is calculated. The hypothesis of CANOVA “similar neighbor predictor values lead to similar response values” is tested for smaller value of statistic “within neighborhood sum square” compared to “random expectation”. Since, a statistic “within neighborhood variance” does not follow any familiar distribution, its significance is tested by permutation test. The grid of a larger K has more power on slow-varying functions, while a smaller K has more power on quick-oscillating functions depending on the data. The suggested choice for the neighborhood structure of the dataset is n/ 20 [20]. CANOVA is related to local regression (like, K nearest neighbor (kNN) regression), and CANOVA {{can be viewed as}} an analogy of the model fitness test of the kNN model as Pearson’s correlation coefficient can be viewed as the model fitness test of a linear regression model. This method reduce algorithm complexity to O(nlogn+np) by ordering the data values of response with respect to the ordered value of predictors, and can easily explore the non linear correlation between two continuous variable.|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{improved}} information {{communication infrastructure}} (primarily the internet), the growth publicly available spatially enabled applications (such as Google Earth) and accessible positioning technology (GPS) {{have combined to}} enable users from many differing and diverse backgrounds to share geographically referenced information. In an increasingly spatial enabled society, user generated or volunteered geographic information is now becoming the first <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>response</b> {{in the immediate aftermath}} of a natural disaster. With the prediction of more severe weather events in the coming decades, emergency response personnel must be prepared to react quickly and utilize the latest information and communication technologies where appropriate. Crowd source mapping platforms can be operation in a matter of hours of a natural disaster occurring and can utilize the information provided by citizens on the ground to collect timely and relevant information with respect to the disaster. Information can be contributed through multiple channels to inform others of the impact of the event. This paper examines the growth and development of volunteered geographic information over the recent years. The use of volunteered information and social networking in three natural disasters during 2011 are explored. The timeliness of the responses, the types of information volunteered and the impact of the information during and after the natural disasters are assessed. The relevance of these initiatives to the ongoing development of spatial data infrastructures and their contribution to formal response efforts and authoritative mapping is discussed. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{difficult}} classification problems <b>of</b> the z-dimensional <b>points</b> {{into two}} groups giving 0 - 1 responses due to the messy data structure, we {{try to find the}} denser regions for the favorable customers <b>of</b> <b>response</b> 1, instead <b>of</b> finding the boundaries to separate the two groups. Such regions are called the bumps, and finding the boundaries of the bumps is called the bump hunting. The main objective {{of this paper is to}} find the largest region of the bumps under a specified ratio of the number <b>of</b> the <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>response</b> 1 to the total. Then, we may obtain a trade-off curve between the number <b>of</b> <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>response</b> 1 and the specified ratio. The decision tree method with the Gini 2 ̆ 7 s index will provide the simple-shaped boundaries for the bumps if the marginal density for response 1 shows a rather simple or monotonic shape. Since the computing time searching for the optimal trees will cost much because of the NP-hardness of the problem, some random search methods, e. g., the genetic algorithm adapted to the tree, are useful. Due to the existence of many local maxima unlike the ordinary genetic algorithm search results, the extreme-value statistics will be useful to estimate the global optimum number of captured points; this also guarantees the accuracy of the semi-optimal solution with the simple descriptive rules. This combined method of genetic algorithm search and extreme-value statistics use is new. We apply this method to some artificial messy data case which mimics the real customer database, showing a successful result. The reliability of the solution is discussed...|$|R

40|$|The Wing-Kristofferson (WK) {{model of}} {{movement}} timing emphasises {{the separation of}} central timer and motor processes. Several studies of repetitive timing have shown that increase in variability at longer intervals is attributable to timer processes; however, relatively {{little is known about}} the way motor aspects of timing are affected by task movement constraints. In the present study, we examined timing variability in finger tapping with differences in interval to assess central timer effects, and with differences in movement amplitude to assess motor implementation effects. Then, we investigated whether effects of motor timing observed at the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>response</b> (flexion offset/tap) are also evident in extension, which would suggest that both phases are subject to timing control. Eleven participants performed bimanual simultaneous tapping, at two target intervals (400, 600 ms) with the index finger of each hand performing movements of equal (3 or 6 cm) or unequal amplitude (left hand 3, right hand 6 cm and vice versa). As expected, timer variability increased with the mean interval but showed only small, non-systematic effects with changes in movement amplitude. Motor implementation variability was greater in unequal amplitude conditions. The same pattern of motor variability was observed both at flexion and extension phases of movement. These results suggest that intervals are generated by a central timer, triggering a series of events at the motor output level including flexion and the following extension, which are explicitly represented in the timing system. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Background: Gemcitabine {{remains the}} {{mainstay}} of palliative treatment of advanced pancreatic carcinoma (APC). Adding capecitabine or a platinum derivative each significantly prolonged survival in recent meta-analyses. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine dose, safety and preliminary efficacy of a first-line regimen combining all three classes of active cytotoxic drugs in APC. Patients and methods: Chemotherapy-naive patients with locally advanced or metastatic, histologically proven adenocarcinoma of the pancreas were treated with a 21 -day regimen of gemcitabine [1000 mg/m 2 day (d) 1, d 8], escalating doses of oxaliplatin (80 - 130 mg/m 2 d 1) and capecitabine (650 - 800 mg/m 2 b. i. d. d 1 -d 14). The recommended dose (RD), determined in the phase I part of the study by interpatient dose escalation in cohorts of three to six patients, was further studied in a two-stage phase II part with the primary end <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>response</b> rate by RECIST criteria. Results: Forty-five patients were treated with a total of 203 treatment cycles. Thrombocytopenia and diarrhea were the toxic effects limiting the dose to an RD of gemcitabine 1000 mg/m 2 d 1, d 8; oxaliplatin 130 mg/m 2 d 1 and capecitabine 650 mg/m 2 b. i. d. d 1 - 14. Central independent radiological review showed partial remissions in 41 % [95 % confidence interval (CI) 26 % to 56 %] of patients and disease stabilization in 37 % (95 % CI 22 % to 52 %) of patients.

We performed a phase-II trial of RA in relapsed, sensitive SCLC with the primary end <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>response</b> rate. Patients with previously treated SCLC who relapsed more than 60 days {{after the completion of}} first-line chemotherapy were treated with RA-administered intravenously at a dose of 140 mg/m 2 on days 1 to 5 of 21 -day cycles for a maximum of six cycles. Eligibility included Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 to 2 and adequate organ function. A two-stage design was employed. Twenty evaluable patients were enrolled. Median age was 61 years. Two patients (10 %) had a partial response and six had stable disease. The clinical benefit rate was 40 % (95 % confidence interval [CI], 23 – 64 %).

40|$|Summary: The {{inhibitory}} receptor CTLA 4 has a {{key role}} in peripheral tolerance of T cells for both normal and tumor-associated antigens. Murine experiments suggested that block-ade of CTLA 4 might have antitumor activity and a clinical experience with the blocking antibody ipilimumab in patients with metastatic melanoma did show durable tumor regressions in some patients. Therefore, a phase II study of ipilimumab was conducted in patients with metastatic renal cell cancer with a primary end <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>response</b> by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. Two sequential cohorts received either 3 mg/kg followed by 1 mg/kg or all doses at 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks (with no intention of comparing cohort response rates). Major toxicities were enteritis and endocrine deficiencies of presumed autoimmune origin. One of 21 patients receiving the lower dose had a partial response. Five of 40 patients at the higher dose had partial responses (95 % confidence interval for cohort response rate 4 % to 27 %) and responses were seen in patients who had previously not responded to IL- 2. Thirty-three percent of patients experienced a grade III or IV immune-mediated toxicity. There was a highly significant association between autoimmune events (AEs) and tumor regression (response rate= 30 % with AE, 0 % without AE). CTLA 4 blockade with ipilimumab induces cancer regres-sion in some patients with metastatic clear cell renal cancer, even if they have not responded to other immunotherapies. These regressions are highly associated with other immune-mediated events of presumed autoimmune origin by mechanisms as yet undefined.

40|$|IntroductionAflibercept (vascular endothelial {{growth factor}} [VEGF] trap), a {{recombinant}} fusion protein, blocks {{the activity of}} VEGF-A and placental growth factor and has demonstrated activity in pretreated patients with lung cancer in a phase I trial. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of intravenous aflibercept in patients with platinum- and erlotinib-resistant lung adenocarcinoma. MethodsAn open-label, single arm, multicenter trial was conducted, with the primary end <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>response</b> rate (modified RECIST). Additional endpoints included safety, duration of response, progression-free survival, and overall survival. Patients with platinum- and erlotinib-resistant lung adenocarcinoma were eligible. Aflibercept 4. 0 mg/kg intravenous every 2 weeks was administered until progression of disease or intolerable toxicity. ResultsNinety-eight patients were enrolled; 89 were evaluable for response. Median age was 60 years, 41 % were men with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 / 1 / 2 in 35 / 55 / 9 % of patients. The overall response rate was 2. 0 %, (95 % confidence interval, 0. 2 - 7. 2 %). Median progression-free survival was 2. 7 months, and overall was survival 6. 2 months. Six- and 12 -month survival rates were 54 and 29 %, respectively. A median of four cycles was administered (range 1 - 22). Common grade 3 / 4 toxicities included dyspnea (21 %), hypertension (23 %), and proteinuria (10 %). Two cases of grade 5 hemoptysis were reported, and one case each of tracheoesophageal fistula, decreased cardiac ejection fraction, cerebral ischemia, and reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy. ConclusionsAflibercept has minor single agent activity in heavily pretreated lung adenocarcinoma, and is well tolerated, with no unexpected toxicities.
