40|$|To develop {{eco-friendly}} diesel engines, accurate combustion {{phase control}} is important {{due to its}} significant effects on harmful emissions and fuel efficiency. In order to accu-rately control the combustion phase, the detection of the combustion phase should pre-cede control system design. Currently, combustion phase detection {{is done by the}} location of 50 % mass fraction burned (MFB 50), because of its close correlation with emissions and fuel efficiency. However, this method is not easily implemented in real-time applications because the calculation of MFB 50 requires a large amount of in-cylinder pressure data and an excessive computational load. For this reason, a com-bustion <b>phase</b> <b>indicator</b> with a simple algorithm is required for real-time combustion con-trol. In this study, we propose a new combustion <b>phase</b> <b>indicator,</b> called the “Central normalized difference pressures (CNDP). ” The CNDP indicates the center of the two crank angles where the normalized difference pressure between firing pressure and motoring pressure (NDP) reaches 90 % of the maximum value before peak (NDPbp 90), and 70 % of the maximum value after peak (NDPap 70). The NDPbp 90 and NDPap 70 are highly correlated with MFB 50 and the correlation is enhanced as the center between the two points obtained. The CNDP is represented by a fixed quadratic polynomial with MFB 50 that robust to changes in various engine operating conditions such as engine speed, main injection timing, injected fuel quantity, fuel-rail pressure, exhaust gas recir-culation (EGR) rate and boost pressure. Furthermore, in performance evaluation, the CNDP requires remarkably fewer in-cylinder pressure data samples, calculation steps and less computation time compared to MFB 50. These results show great potential for the CNDP to be a substitute for the MFB 50 since the proposed combustion phase detec-tion algorithm can be used effectively for real-time combustion phase detection and con-trol.

40|$|In {{order to}} reduce fuel cost and CO 2 emissions, modern spark {{ignition}} (SI) engines need to lower {{as much as possible}} fuel consumption. A crucial factor for efficiency improvement is represented by the combustion phase, which in an SI engine is controlled acting on the spark advance. This fundamental engine parameter is currently controlled in an open-loop by means of maps stored in the electronic control unit (ECU) memory: such kind of control, however, does not allow running the engine always at its best performance, since optimal combustion phase depends on many variables, like ambient conditions, fuel quality, engine aging, and wear, etc. A better choice would be represented by a closed-loop spark timing control, which may be pursued by means of combustion <b>phase</b> <b>indicators,</b> i. e., parameters mostly derived from in-cylinder pressure analysis that assume fixed reference values when the combustion phase is optimal. As documented in literature, the use of combustion <b>phase</b> <b>indicators</b> allows the determination of the best spark advance, apart from any variable or boundary condition. The implementation of a feedback spark timing control, based on the use of these combustion <b>phase</b> <b>indicators,</b> would ensure the minimum fuel consumption in every possible condition. Despite the presence of many literature references on the use combustion <b>phase</b> <b>indicators,</b> {{there is no evidence of}} any experimental comparison on the performance obtainable, in terms of both control accuracy and transient response, by the use of such indicators in a spark timing feedback control. The author, hence, carried out a proper experimental campaign comparing the performances of a proportional-integral spark timing control based on the use of five different in-cylinder pressure derived indicators. The experiments were carried out on a bench test, equipped with a series production four cylinder spark ignition engine and an eddy current dynamometer, using two data acquisition (DAQ) systems for data acquisition and spark timing control. Pressure sampling was performed by means of a flush mounted piezoelectric pressure transducer with the resolution of one crank angle degree. The feedback control was compared to the conventional map based control in terms of response time, control stability, and control accuracy in three different kinds of tests: steady-state, step response, and transient operation. All the combustion <b>phase</b> <b>indicators</b> proved to be suitable for proportionalintegral feedback spark advance control, allowing fast and reliable control even in transient operations.

40|$|Abstract. A novel full Eulerian fluid-elastic {{membrane}} coupling method on the fixed Cartesian coordinate mesh is proposed {{within the framework}} of the volume-of-fluid approach. The present method is based on a full Eulerian fluid-(bulk) structure coupling solver (Sugiyama et al., J. Comput. Phys., 230 (2011) 596 – 627), with the bulk structure replaced by elastic membranes. In this study, a closed membrane is considered, and it is described by a volume-of-fluid or volume-fraction information generally called VOF function. A smoothed indicator (or characteristic) function is introduced as a <b>phase</b> <b>indicator</b> which results in a smoothed VOF function. This smoothed VOF function uses a smoothed delta function, and it enables a membrane singular force to be incorporated into a mixture momentum equation. In order to deal with a membrane deformation on the Eulerian mesh, a deformation tensor is introduced and updated within a compactly supported region near the interface. Both the neo-Hookean and the Skalak models are employed in the numerical simulations. A smoothed (and less dissipative) interface capturing method is employed for the advection of the VOF function and the quantities defined on the membrane. The stability restriction due t...|$|E

Our model extends the FT model developed by van Sint Annaland et al. (2006) to non-isothermal conditions. In FT an unstructured dynamic mesh {{is used to}} represent and track the interface explicitly {{by a number of}} interconnected marker points. The Lagrangian representation of the interface avoids the necessity to reconstruct the interface from the local distribution of the fractions of the phases and, moreover, allows a direct and accurate calculation of the surface tension force circumventing the (problematic) computation of the interface curvature. The extended model is applied to predict the heat exchange rate between the liquid and a hot wall kept at a fixed temperature. It is found that the wall-to-liquid heat transfer coefficient exhibits a maximum {{in the vicinity of the}} bubble that can be attributed to the locally decreased thickness of the thermal boundary layer.

40|$|Objective: Beliefs in one's {{ability to}} perform a task or {{behaviour}} successfully are described as self-efficacy beliefs (Bandura, 1977). Since individuals {{have to deal with}} differing demands during a behaviour-change process, they form phase-specific self-efficacy beliefs directed at these respective challenges. The present study, based on the Health Action Process Approach (Schwarzer, 2001), examines the theoretical differentiation, relative importance, and differential effects of four phase-specific self-efficacy beliefs, including task self-efficacy, preactional self-efficacy, maintenance self-efficacy, and recovery self-efficacy. Design: In a prospective longitudinal study, 112 prostatectomy-patients received questionnaires at 2 days, 2 weeks, 1 month, and 6 months post-surgery. Methods: Participants provided data on phase-specific self-efficacies as well as <b>phase</b> <b>indicators</b> of health-behaviour change, that is, intentions, planning, and pelvic-floor exercise. Hierarchical regression analyses were conducted to test the study hypotheses. Results: Task self-efficacy was not uniquely associated with intentions. Preactional self-efficacy was related to action planning. Maintenance self-efficacy did not predict behaviour. Recovery self-efficacy was associated with re-uptake of pelvic-floor exercise after relapses only. Conclusion: Findings underline the importance of differentiating between task self-efficacy and preactional self-efficacy during early phases of behaviour change as well as of considering the occurrence of relapses as a moderator of potential effects of recovery self-efficacy on the maintenance of behaviour change.

Geomechanical effects may be signiﬁcant for people and infrastructures because the underground dissolution may lead to subsidence or collapse (sinkholes). The knowledge of the cavity evolution in space and time is thus crucial in many cases. In this paper, we describe the use of a local nonequilibrium diffuse interface model for solving dissolution problems involving multimoving interfaces within three phases, that is, solid–liquid–gas as found in superﬁcial aquifers and karsts. This paper generalizes developments achieved in the ﬂuid–solid case, that is, the saturated case [1]. On one hand, a local nonequilibrium dissolution porous medium theory allows to describe the solid–liquid interface as a diffuse layer characterized by the evolution of a <b>phase</b> <b>indicator</b> (e. g., porosity).

Emergency response personnel expressed an interest in deploying a preemption system that would aid ambulances in quickly and safely reaching the hospital. The Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) was interested in quantifying the effects that the proposed signal preemption would have on Route 7 traffic, particularly during the morning rush hour, when inbound traffic, towards Washington, D.

Most of the stream flows considered are driven by snowmelt. The Southern Oscillation index (SOI) is used as the ENSO <b>phase</b> <b>indicator.</b> Both modest (median) and larger (90 th percentile) events were considered. In years with negative SO 1 values (El Niiio), days with high daily precipitation and stream flow are more frequent than average over the Southwest and less frequent over the Northwest.

A more pronounced increase {{is seen in the}} number of days exceeding climatological 90 th percentile values than in the number exceeding climatological 50 th percentile values, for both precipitation and stream flow. Stream flow responses to ENSO extremes are accentuated over precipitation responses. Evidence suggests that the mechanism for this amplification involves ENSO-phase differences in the persistence and duration of wet episodes, affecting the efficiency of the process by which precipitation is converted to runoff. The SO 1 leads the precipitation events by several months, and hydrologic lags (mostly through snowmelt) delay the stream flow response by several more months. The combined 6 - 12 -month predictive aspect of this relationship should be of significant benefit in responding to flood (or drought) risk and in improving overall water management in the western states. 1...|$|E

This dissertation describes {{the development of a}} microfluidic system for immobilizing and culturing of cells that also enables control over the genetic composition of the bacteria and their subsequent response to environmental stimuli via a new nonviral nucleic acid delivery mechanism. This nonviral nucleic acid delivery occurs outside the parameter space of traditional nonviral nucleic acid delivery methods such as electroporation and chemical transformation. The bacteria are immobilized in an optically clear alginate hydrogel which simulates the physical and chemical environment normally experienced by bacteria in a biofilm. Complementing the microfluidic cell culture work, surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), a label-free vibrational spectroscopic technique that lends itself well to use in aqueous systems, was used to detect bacterial signaling molecules. SERS was performed with three different examples of bacterial communication molecules: the universal quorum sensing molecule autoinducer- 2 (AI- 2), the species-specific Pseudomonas Quinolone Signal (PQS), and the stationary <b>phase</b> <b>indicator</b> molecule indole. SERS substrates were formed by galvanic displacement, a substrate fabrication method that can be adapted to many SERS applications. Taken together, these new sensing modalities represent a step toward developing systems that allow researchers to investigate, understand, and ultimately control a cell's response to its environment...|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} of a spark ignition engine strongly depends on the phase of the combustion process with respect to piston motion, and hence on the spark advance; this fundamental parameter is actually controlled in open-loop by means of maps drawn up on the test bench and stored in the Electronic Control Unit (ECU). Bi-fuel engines (e. g. running either on gasoline or on natural gas) require a double mapping process {{in order to obtain}} a spark timing map for each of the fuels. This map based open-loop control however does not assure to run the engine always with the best spark timing, which can be influenced by many factors, like ambient condition of pressure, temperature and humidity, fuel properties, engine wear. A feedback control instead can maintain the spark advance at its optimal value apart from operative and boundary conditions, so as to gain the best performance (or minimum fuel consumption). Such a control can be realized using as pilot variable a combustion <b>phase</b> <b>indicator,</b> i. e. a parameter which depends exclusively on the phase of the heat release process and assumes a fixed value for optimal spark timing. The purpose of the present work is to compare the behaviour of the most used combustion phase indicators using two different fuels one after the other (common gasoline and Compressed Natural Gas, CNG) on the same engine, in order to assess the influence of different heat release progress and to verify the possibility to feedback control the spark timing apart from the fuel used. The comparison has been carried on by means of experimental test on the engine test bench, analysing in-cylinder pressure acquired with varying spark advance for different operative conditions of engine speed, load and air-to-fuel ratio...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose to}} study the $L^ 2 $-norm {{distance}} between classical and quantum phase space distributions, where for the latter we choose the Wigner function, as a global <b>phase</b> space <b>indicator</b> of quantum-classical correspondence. For example, this quantity should provide a key to understand the correspondence between quantum and classical Loschmidt echoes. We concentrate on fully chaotic systems with compact (finite) classical phase space. By means of numerical simulations and heuristic arguments {{we find that the}} quantum-classical fidelity stays at one up to Ehrenfest-type time scale, which is proportional to the logarithm of effective Planck constant, and decays exponentially with a maximal classical Lyapunov exponent, after that time.

40|$|Introduction: Quality control {{programs}} {{are required to}} ensure the effectiveness of Pap smear, which still remain a key strategy for control of cervical cancer worldwide. Objective: This study {{was based on the}} retrospective and quantitative analysis of the post-analytical <b>phase</b> <b>indicators</b> from the internal quality monitoring (IQM) program for cytopathology laboratories, such as: positivity rate, atypical squamous cell (ASC) /satisfactory exams ratio, ASC/abnormal test results ratio, ASC/squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL) ratio, percentage of tests compatible with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL), and total of false negative. Materials and methods: The information was extracted from the computerized system of the Section for Integrated Technology in Cytopathology (Se&# 231;&# 227;o Integrada de Tecnologia em Citopatologia [SITEC]), a reference institution for cancer cytopathology, from July 2013 to June 2014. From a total of 156, 888 Pap smears, 157, 454 were considered satisfactory for indicator analysis and 566 were excluded because they were considered unsatisfactory and/or rejected for analysis. The data was organized in tables using Microsoft Excel 2010 software, and categorized as indicators. Results: The averages for the indicators were: 7. 2 % for positivity rate, 56. 9 for ASC/abnormal test ratio, 4. 1 for ASC/satisfactory tests ratio, 1. 4 for ASC/SIL ratio, 0. 6 % percentage for tests compatible with HSIL, and 2. 1 % for false-negative rate. Conclusion: The results show that an Internal Quality Monitoring Program is essencial to ensure quality for cytopathology laboratories, and a randomized review of at least 10 % of the negative exams, as recommended by the Brazilian Ministry of Health/Instituto Nacional de C&# 226;ncer (INCA), since is an effective method, especially for large laboratories...|$|R
