500|$|Manos Arriba {{consists}} of five tracks. The EP opens with [...] "No Me Mandes Flores" [...] ("Don't Send Me Flowers"), which Agustin Gurza called a [...] "cold kiss-off to a stubborn ex-lover". The second track [...] "A Veces" [...] ("At Times") deals with jealousy, and features salsa horns and tropical influences. The following song [...] "La Duda" [...] ("The Doubt") centers on confusion over a man sending mixed romantic signals; the lyrics {{are accompanied by}} synthesizers. On the fourth track, [...] "Icaro" [...] ("Icarus"), Chana sings about {{the subject of the}} Greek myth. Rather than criticizing Icarus for his hubris, her lyrics have a more positive interpretation that praises his desire to follow his passions despite the risks. Chana identifies closely with Icarus, saying: [...] "I would rather take the risk and fall on my butt. It's about that <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> says just do it." [...] The EP concludes with [...] "The Whistler", which mocks the practice of catcalling. In his verses, rapper Malverde assumes the role of a cat-caller.|$|E
500|$|Alex Timbers {{developed}} {{the concept and}} directed the play, while Kyle Jarrow wrote the accompanying book, music, and lyrics. [...] Timbers and Jarrow were classmates together at Yale University. [...] The script for the play is published by Samuel French, Inc. [...] Jarrow was motivated to write the script {{by what he saw}} as a shift in religious teachings – from an old model involving hell and retribution, to a new system of thought promising money or peace. [...] Jarrow commented on Timbers' idea of using children to tell a story about Scientology: [...] "I did a lot of work on cults in college, and what I learned is that they sort of turn you into a child by appealing to that <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> wants {{to be taken care of}} and given answers. [...] And so it all began to make sense to me." [...] He said Scientology would be [...] "an especially interesting topic for a theater piece" [...] because of its criticism of psychiatry, relative newness compared to Buddhism, Islam, Judaism, and Christianity, and practice of requiring [...] "that the follower take courses which cost significant amounts of money." ...|$|E
500|$|The lyrics address {{aspects of}} a bad relationship, but also {{reference}} fashion in the line, [...] "Walk, walk fashion baby, Work it move that bitch crazy." [...] In an interview, Gaga pointed {{out that in the}} verse, [...] "I want your psycho, your vertigo shtick, Want you in my Rear Window, Baby, you're sick", she was listing Alfred Hitchcock films; she said, [...] "What I'm really trying to say is I want the deepest, darkest, sickest <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are afraid to share with anyone because I love <b>you</b> <b>that</b> much." ...|$|R

5000|$|Ray Bradbury {{once said}} of Chaney, [...] "He {{was someone who}} acted out our psyches. He somehow got into the shadows inside our bodies; {{he was able to}} nail down some of our secret fears and put them on-screen. The history of Lon Chaney is the history of unrequited loves. He brings <b>that</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> out into the open, because <b>you</b> fear <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are not loved, <b>you</b> fear <b>that</b> <b>you</b> never will be loved, you fear there is some <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>that's</b> grotesque, that the world will turn away from." ...|$|R

2500|$|Currents {{has also}} been {{frequently}} characterised as a breakup album. Prior to recording, Parker {{made the decision to}} break up with French singer-songwriter Melody Prochet. Several songs on the album examine it from his angle as the instigator of the breakup, which consists of guilt and self-questioning. Parker downplayed the notion that the album was entirely aimed at former lovers, however, and likened it to an inner monologue: [...] "It's really me talking to myself, another <b>part</b> <b>of</b> myself... to my old self, the <b>part</b> <b>of</b> me that resists change and wants me to stay as I am." [...] For Parker, the album meant [...] "looking forward and a sudden adoption of confidence." [...] The album's title reflects this, with currents being [...] "these unstoppable forces; the <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> are trying to change you." ...|$|R

I am to put in Scotty Briggs (See Buck Fanshaw's Funeral, in [...] "Roughing It.") and he is to put in a Chinaman (a wonderfully funny creature, as Bret presents him--for 5 minutes--in his Sandy Bar play.) This Chinaman is to be the character of the play, and both of us will work on him and develop him. Bret is to draw a plot, and I am to do the same; we shall use the best of the two, or gouge from both and build a third. My plot is built--finished it yesterday--six days' work, 8 or 9 hours a day, and has nearly killed me.|$|E

5000|$|With {{the full}} weight of its network behind it, TNG got away with {{a lot of things that}} would have killed other shows stone-dead. This episode is a prime example of that.

And yet, it works, if only because it tickles the <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> wonders exactly what might be out there.

50|$|In {{one of his}} books, Hilgard {{described}} a classic test demonstrating how this hidden entity {{is part of our}} consciousness. He wrote of a blind student who was hypnotized and, while in a trance state, was told that he would become deaf. The suggestion was so strong that he failed to react to any form of noise, even large sounds next to his ear. Of course, he also failed to respond to any questions he was asked while in his trance state. The hypnotist was keen to discover if anybody else was able to hear. He quietly said to the student, Perhaps there is some <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> is hearing my voice and processing the information. If there is, I should like the index finger of your right hand to rise as a sign that this is the case(Hilgard, 1977, p. 186). The finger rose. At this, the student requested that he be brought out of the hypnotically-induced period of deafness. On beingawakened, the student said that he had requested {{to come out of the}} trance state because I felt my finger rise in a way that was not a spontaneous twitch, so you must have done something to make it rise, and I want to know what you did (p. 186). The hypnotist then asked him what he remembered. Because the trance was light, the student never actually lost consciousness; all that occurred was that his hearing had ceased. In order to deal with the boredom of being deprived of both sight and sound,he had decided to work on some statistical problems in his head. It was while he was doing this that he suddenly felt his finger lift. This was obviously strange to him, because under normal circumstances he was, like all of us, the person who decides on how the body moves. In this case he was not. Not only that, but somebody else in his head was responding to an external request that he had not heard. As far as Hilgard was concerned, the person who responded was the hidden observer.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the more}} popular {{academic}} slogans of this half century is Wittgenstein's characterization of language-in-use as a form of life. Genre theory takes this slogan seriously. In perceiving an utterance as being of a certain kind or genre, we become caught up in a form of life, joining speakers and hearers, writers and readers, in particular relations of a familiar and intelligible sort. As participants orient towards this communicative social space they take on the mood, attitude, and actional possibilities of that placeóthey go that place to do the kinds <b>of</b> things <b>you</b> do there, think the kinds <b>of</b> thoughts <b>you</b> think there, feel the kind <b>of</b> way <b>you</b> feel there, satisfy what you can satisfy there, be the kind <b>of</b> person <b>you</b> can become there (Bazerman 1997, 1998). It is like going to a dining room, or a dance hall, or a seminar, or church. You know what you are getting yourself into and what range of relations and objects will likely be realized there. You adopt a frame of mind, set your hopes, plan accordingly, and begin acting with <b>that</b> orientation. <b>You</b> also know <b>that</b> if <b>you</b> hang around a certain place long enough you will become {{the kind of person who}} hangs around that kind <b>of</b> place [...] <b>you</b> know your way around the place, how to act there, what to say there, who fits or misfits, and who is a newcomer. The places you habituate will develop those <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> are most related to and oriented towards the activities of that space.
