Patients and methods: We report preliminary data of a serie of 11 patients all with a C-peptide values below 0. 0 ng/ml. They were followed for 6 to 60 months (mean 19 months) after surgery. We studied the changes in glycemic control, evolution of the metabolic syndrome and diabetes complications after one anastomosis gastric bypass (BAGUA). Results: All values relative to glycemic control were improved HbA 1 c (from 8. 9 ± 0. 6 to 6. 7 ± 0. 2 %), FPG (Fasting Plasma Glucose) [from 222. 36 ± 16. 87 to 94 ± 5 (mg/dl) ] as well as the daily insulin requirement of rapid (from 40. 6 ± 12. 8 to 0 (U/d) and long-lasting insulin (from 41. 27 ± 7. 3 U/day to 15. 2 ± 3. 3 U/day).

In general, diabetes mellitus -derived from the greek diabainein (to fall through) and mellos (as sweet as honey) - reflects a range of chronic metabolic disorders in which we distinguish two main forms: first, juvenile-onset diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and second, the maturity-onset form or non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.

30|$|Insulin {{resistance}} plays a {{major role}} in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome. Insulin resistance is defined as a state in which the body loses its ability to respond to insulin which is a key factor in the development of diabetes mellitus. Research has stated that the development of insulin resistance is closely associated with obesity, cardiovascular disease type 2 diabetes mellitus along with immune cell infiltration and inflammation [229]. In this condition the muscle, fat, and liver cells are likely to have a decreased responsiveness and cannot absorb glucose easily from the bloodstream and do not respond properly to insulin. As a result, the body demands higher levels of insulin to provide glucose entry into cells. To balance this demand, the beta cells in the <b>pancreas</b> also <b>produce</b> more <b>insulin.</b> As long as the beta cells are able to <b>produce</b> enough <b>insulin</b> to overcome the insulin resistance, blood glucose levels stay in the healthy range. Beta cells have two insulin receptors. If one of them gets insensitive to insulin, the other insulin receptor is activated by a different pathway, which leads to beta cell proliferation.|$|R
2500|$|Diabetes {{mellitus}} is {{a disease}} in which the beta cells of the endocrine <b>pancreas</b> either stop <b>producing</b> <b>insulin</b> or can no longer produce it in enough quantity for the body's needs.

The condition is also referred to as insulin-dependent diabetes, meaning exogenous insulin injections must replace the insulin the pancreas is no longer capable of producing for the body's needs. Dogs can have insulin-dependent, or Type 1, diabetes; research finds no Type 2 diabetes in dogs. Because of this, there is no possibility the permanently damaged pancreatic beta cells could re-activate to engender a remission as may be possible with some feline diabetes cases, where the primary type of diabetes is Type 2. There is another less common form of diabetes, diabetes insipidus, which is a condition of insufficient antidiuretic hormone or resistance to it.|$|R

In this thesis, measurements from Intra Venous Glucose Tolerance Test (IVGTT) for both healthy subjects and type 2 diabetes patients were used together with Bergman’s deterministic minimal model (ODE) to estimate the insulin sensitivity based on a nonlinear mixed effect model. In addition to the IVGTT data some basic covariates were included and tested for significance. Type 2 diabetes patients are shown to be less sensitive to insulin than healthy subjects and thus need larger amount of insulin to lower blood glucose level.

In recent years, some research has directed towards the creation of an artificial pancreas that allows automatically the regulation of glucose levels in blood. However, one of the greatest difficulties in achieving this objective, is that not all internal variables of the mathematical model associated with the controller can be measured directly by physical sensors, either because there are no sensors for all variables, because existing sensors are not commercial, or because they are not viable from the economic point of view. Therefore, it is necessary to use estimation schemes to reconstruct the unknown states by measuring the interstitial glucose, {{in the case of the}} glucose-insulin system. However, the delay between plasma glucose and interstitial glucose has a negative effect on the performance of state estimators, so the treatment of this delay is necessary either from the modeling process of the glucose-insulin system or by a modification of the estimation techniques. According to the results it can be inferred that in the scenario at which the concentration of blood glucose is assumed, the estimated values have upper and lower peaks that are unrealistic from a physiological point of view, this due to the negative effect of the delay in measurement.

The pathogenesis of NAFLD remains obscure, but it has been hypothesized that hepatic fat accumulation in type 1 diabetes may be due to lipoprotein abnormalities, hyperglycemia-induced activation of the transcription factors carbohydrate response element-binding protein (ChREBP) and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 c (SREBP- 1 c), upregulation of glucose transporter 2 (GLUT 2) with subsequent intrahepatic fat synthesis, or a combination of these mechanisms.
