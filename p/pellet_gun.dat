500|$|In October 2006, Uribe was {{alleged to}} have been {{involved}} in a shooting in his native Dominican Republic. A farmer named Antonio Gonzalez Perez accused Uribe of wounding him with a <b>pellet</b> <b>gun.</b> Despite claims by the San Cristóbal Province District Attorney that there was no firm evidence that Uribe was involved in the incident, a judge decided to press forward with the case. Although a defense motion to bar him from leaving the country was rejected, it was ruled on January 5, 2007, that Uribe must appear before a court on the 15 and the 30 of every month until the case was resolved. Uribe, who denied any involvement in the case, suggested that he might not play baseball until the legal proceedings were concluded. He was confident that he would win in court, and the White Sox expected him to be free for spring training. In February, his name was cleared of any involvement with the shooting, and the court ruled he no longer had to appear on the 15 and 30 of every month. Uribe called the incident [...] "blackmail", saying it was an attempt by Perez to get money from him.|$|E
50|$|In {{response}} to the high casualties caused by use of <b>pellet</b> <b>guns,</b> Rajnath Singh announced that a panel would be set up to look for alternatives to <b>pellet</b> <b>guns.</b> During a visit to Kashmir, he asked the security forces to avoid using <b>pellet</b> <b>guns</b> as much as possible. The Director-General of Central Reserve Police Force, K. Durga Prasad, in a statement issued on 25 July, regretted the injuries Kashmiri civilians received due {{to the use of}} the guns but said that they were the least lethal option available to control the protesting crowd and assured they will only be used in most extreme situations. Lieutenant general D. S. Hooda, chief of the Northern Command of the Indian Army, supported his claim regarding <b>pellet</b> <b>guns.</b> Prasad's comments were criticised by Congress leaders Ghulam Nabi Azad and Amarinder Singh as well as Mohammed Yousuf Tarigami, the state chief of CPI-M.|$|R

5000|$|On 6 September, {{the state}} {{government}} justified the use of <b>pellet</b> <b>guns</b> before the state's high court stating they were a modern method to deal with violent protesters and contended that a court couldn't recommend how law and order situations are to be handled. It also claimed that <b>pellet</b> <b>guns</b> were not compatible with the Standard Operating Procedure of firing below the knees as the pellets spread to a diameter of 6 metres when the gun is fired. On 10 September, V.K. Singh {{who is also the}} former chief of Indian Army, supported the use of <b>pellet</b> <b>guns</b> stating they were non-lethal and it was a [...] "sensible and well-thought" [...] decision by the Home Ministry to use them. On 21 September, the state High Court rejected the petition regarding banning of guns, stating that the use of force was inevitable as long as unruly mobs indulged in violence.|$|R
2500|$|DC {{gave the}} Question his own solo series in 1987, written by Dennis O'Neil and {{primarily}} drawn by Denys Cowan. The series was published for thirty-six issues—two annuals and five [...] "Quarterly" [...] specials. In The Question #1, the Question {{was defeated in}} personal combat, first by the martial arts mercenary, Lady Shiva. He was then beaten nearly to death by the villain's hired thugs, {{shot in the head}} with a <b>pellet</b> <b>gun</b> and thrown into the river to drown. Lady Shiva then rescued him for reasons of her own and gave him directions to meet wheelchair-bound Richard Dragon as soon as he recovered enough to get out of bed. Once there, Sage learned both martial arts and eastern philosophy. When he returned to the city, he resumed his journalist and superhero careers with adventures that tended to illustrate various philosophic points. To further illustrate those ideas, Dennis O'Neil had a reading recommendation in the letters page of each issue.|$|E

Jay met Laura when he arrested Sarah for driving her car into a {{playground}} sandbox after drinking too much cough syrup and passing out. Jay is also a closet performer, in the genre of sentimental [...] "gentle comedy" [...] character sketches. Jay dislikes Sarah and calls her [...] "the cuckoo clown" [...] (in the episode [...] "Positively Negative"), but he is so devoted to Laura that he will go {{out of his way}} to help Sarah, even when she vows to kill him. Jay won a [...] "Humanitarian of the Year" [...] award for the work that he does reading to blind people. Growing up, he never celebrated his birthday because his mother told him that every day was his birthday. (She had only told him that to cover up her beer and cake addiction, which ended up killing her on Jay's actual birthday.) Jay also has a brown moustache, which is something Sarah frequently insults or at least mentions in most introductions to each episode. In [...] "Muffin' Man", Jay mentions that his partner, Officer Paul Tompkins, has been suspended for opening fire on a Hispanic youth who pulled a <b>pellet</b> <b>gun</b> on him, and that he had received a temporary new partner named Tig (Tig Notaro) who is a lesbian. Jay was also very attached to a turtle he owned, Toot. Toot was shot to death by Sarah (in the episode [...] "Pee").

The High Court issued notices to {{both the state and}} Union government asking them to file a response to a petition seeking ban on the guns. When Prasad was asked during an interview on 9 August about when will the CRPF stop using <b>pellet</b> <b>guns,</b> he replied it was like asking when will you stop beating your wife.

Deputy Chief Minister Nirmal Singh ruled out a ban on the weapons stating they were only used in extreme situations. The army recommended the CRPF and police to use sound cannons, pepper shotguns and chilli grenades instead of the <b>pellet</b> <b>guns.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The term [...] "BB gun" [...] {{is often}} {{incorrectly}} {{used to describe}} a <b>pellet</b> <b>gun,</b> which fires non-spherical projectiles.

Similarly, the term is also often used incorrectly to address airsoft guns, which shoot plastic balls that are larger but much less dense.|$|E
