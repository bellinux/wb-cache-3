25|$|In Overwatchs Asia servers, {{there were}} {{problems}} with numerous players using hacks tied to {{the growing number of}} younger players using PC bangs in South Korea that allow them to play Overwatch on an inexpensive hourly rate rather than purchasing the game.

Subsequently, Blizzard announced that players from South Korea will be required to log into a Battle.net account to play the game from February 2017 onward, which requires a difficult-to-spoof resident registration number among other unique information, which Blizzard believes will help to alleviate the problem.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{carries out}} a {{quantitative}} comparison of accounting differences between Italian reporting practice and United States generally agreed accounting principles (US GAAP) {{with the purpose}} of examining how alternative accounting treatments impact on the level of conservatism. The analysis investigates the accounting adjustments applied to net income and shareholders’ equity as included in the Form 20 -F reconciliation reported by Italian firms to the Security Exchange Commission (SEC). The methodology first introduced by Gray (1980) is adapted to recognize a multi-period dimension of the accounting choice. In particular, by focussing on the timing of such adjustments – that is their attitude to reverse or become permanent over time – we develop hypotheses based on the interaction of three factors: clean vs dirty-surplus accounting, recurring vs non-recurring operations, long-term vs short-term assets and liabilities. The results are consistent with our general thesis that the level of conservatism is fundamentally measured by the prevailing directional effect of <b>permanent</b> <b>accounting</b> adjustments. Such adjustments arise and intensify when the accounting differences relate to long-term assets and liabilities that are recurring. Amongst them those stemming from the violation of the clean surplus relation are the most controversial for they generate an opposite permanent effect in the measurement of both net assets and earnings...|$|R

As the case filing, scrutiny and case registration services have been automated in the courts, the NJRS project envisages collation of data from such external data sources. The Income Tax Department in India has also developed several computer systems to for its own internal workflows and to manage the data base of the returns filed by the tax payers. The unifying factor across these computer systems is the <b>Permanent</b> <b>Account</b> Number (PAN) allocated to identify each tax payer uniquely. The data collected in from the external court systems will be collated in NJRS {{with the help of}} taxpayers information stored in the PAN database and other computer systems of the tax department. In addition, the appeal case files will also be scanned through a network of 28 regional scanning centers specially established under the project across the country. The scanned case files will be processed at a BPO like facility for writing case summaries, keyphrases, metadata and linking the case files with the case data obtained from external court systems. Creation of NJRS will thus be a mammoth exercise, requiring the active co-operation of a number of agencies, including the judicial bodies.|$|E
