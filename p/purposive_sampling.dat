50|$|Typically a {{population}} is very large, making a census or a complete enumeration of all the values in that population infeasible. A 'sample' thus forms a manageable subset of {{a population}}. In positivist research, statistics derived from a sample are analysed in order to draw inferences regarding {{the population as a}} whole. The process of collecting information from a sample is referred to as 'sampling'. Sampling methods may be either 'random' (random sampling, systematic sampling, stratified sampling, cluster sampling) or non-random/nonprobability (convenience sampling, <b>purposive</b> <b>sampling,</b> snowball sampling). The most common reason for sampling is to obtain information about a population. Sampling is quicker and cheaper than a complete census of a population.|$|E
50|$|Basic {{types of}} data that are needed to {{construct}} the CPI: price data and weighting data. The price data are collected for a sample {{of goods and services}} from a sample of sales outlets in a sample of locations for a sample of times. The weighting data are estimates of the shares of the different types of expenditure in the total expenditure covered by the index. These weights are usually based upon expenditure data obtained from expenditure surveys for a sample of households or upon estimates of the composition of consumption expenditure in the National Income and Product Accounts. Although some of the sampling of items for price collection is done using a sampling frame and probabilistic sampling methods, many items and outlets are chosen in a commonsense way (<b>purposive</b> <b>sampling)</b> that does not permit estimation of confidence intervals. Therefore, the sampling variance cannot be calculated. In any case, a single estimate is required in most of the purposes for which the index is used.|$|E

5000|$|Thus, one cannot say {{the same}} {{on the basis of}} a non{{probability}} sample than {{on the basis of a}} probability sample. The grounds for drawing generalizations (e.g., propose new theory, propose policy) from studies based on nonprobability samples are based on the notion of [...] "theoretical saturation" [...] and [...] "analytical generalization" [...] (Yin, 2014) instead of on statistical generalization. Researchers working with the notion of <b>purposive</b> <b>sampling</b> assert that while probability methods are suitable for large-scale studies concerned with representativeness, non-probability approaches are more suitable for in-depth qualitative research in which the focus is often to understand complex social phenomena (e.g., Marshall 1996; Small 2009). One of the advantages of nonprobability sampling is its lower cost compared to probability sampling. Moreover, the in-depth analysis of a small-N purposive sample or a case study enables the [...] "discovery" [...] and identification of patterns and causal mechanisms that do not draw time and context-free assumptions.|$|E
50|$|Sometimes IPA studies {{involve a}} close {{examination}} of the experiences and meaning-making activities of only one participant. Most frequently they draw on the accounts of {{a small number of}} people (6 has been suggested as a good number, although anywhere between 3 and 15 participants for a group study can be acceptable). In either case, participants are invited to take part precisely because they can offer the researcher some meaningful insight into the topic of the study; this is called <b>purposive</b> <b>sampling</b> it is not randomised. Usually, participants in an IPA study are expected to have certain experiences in common with one another: the small-scale nature of a basic IPA study shows how something is understood in a given context, and from a shared perspective, a method sometimes called homogeneous sampling. More advanced IPA study designs may draw together samples which offer multiple perspectives on a shared experience (husbands and wives, for example, or psychiatrists and patients); or they may collect accounts over a period of time, to develop a longitudinal analysis.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{identify}} the challenges in adding a critical realist epistemological perspective to a positivist approach in research on listed companies by equity researchers and other financial services professionals. Design/methodology/approach – A <b>purposive</b> <b>sample</b> of publicly available equity research reports was examined to assess the dominant epistemological approach to investment analysis. Findings – It was found that there is an absence of a critical realist epistemological approach to investment analysis, confirming the dominance of a positivist approach to obtaining and analysing investment information. Research limitations/implications – This research drew on a small, <b>purposive</b> <b>sample,</b> and could be followed by more wide-scale research. Taking a critical realist approach may create a clash of "institutional logics" which will need to be considered by a range of stakeholders. Originality/value – Equity research reports are examined through the lens of critical realism. This exploration allows for an additional epistemological perspective on analysis of firm value. 20 page(s...|$|R
