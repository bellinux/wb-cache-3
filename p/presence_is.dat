5|$|In Reformed theology, the Lord's Supper or Eucharist is {{a sacrament}} that spiritually nourishes Christians and {{strengthens}} their union with Christ. The outward or physical {{action of the}} sacrament is eating bread and drinking wine. Reformed confessions, which are official statements of the beliefs of Reformed churches, teach that Christ's body and blood are really present in the sacrament, but that this <b>presence</b> <b>is</b> communicated in a spiritual manner rather than by his body being physically eaten. The Reformed doctrine of real <b>presence</b> <b>is</b> sometimes called mystical real presence or spiritual real presence.|$|E

5|$|Alan and Barry {{start to}} learn about the past of Cauldron Lake from other townsfolk. They believe an entity called the Dark <b>Presence</b> <b>is</b> trapped within the lake and is trying to escape by using its powers to turn fiction into reality. It has {{previously}} tried this with a writer known as Thomas Zane—the figure in the diving suit—but Zane was able to resist its will and died during the eruption that sank the island. The Dark Presence has grown strong enough to start to influence the townspeople and create the forces that have chased Alan. That night, as Alan and Barry take shelter, they get drunk on moonshine, and Alan starts to recall memories of being forced to write Departure during the prior week, and realizes that the Dark <b>Presence</b> <b>is</b> now trying to use his writings to escape.|$|E
5|$|Another {{interesting}} {{example that}} does not involve any luring is the zone-tailed hawk, which resembles the turkey vulture. It flies amongst the vultures, suddenly breaking from the formation and ambushing its prey. Here the hawk's <b>presence</b> <b>is</b> of no evident significance to the vultures, affecting them neither negatively or positively.|$|E

5|$|After {{the border}} reopened, the British {{government}} reduced the {{military presence in}} Gibraltar by closing the naval dockyard. The RAF presence was also downgraded; although the airport officially remains an RAF base, military aircraft are no longer permanently stationed there. The British garrison, which had been present since 1704, was withdrawn in 1990 following defence cutbacks {{at the end of}} the Cold War. A number of military units continue to be stationed in Gibraltar under the auspices of British Forces Gibraltar; the garrison was replaced with locally recruited units of the Royal Gibraltar Regiment, while a Royal Navy <b>presence</b> <b>is</b> continued through the Gibraltar Squadron, responsible for overseeing the security of Gibraltar's territorial waters. In March 1988 a British military operation against members of the Provisional IRA (PIRA) planning a car bomb attack in Gibraltar ended in controversy when the Special Air Service shot and killed all three PIRA members.|$|E
5|$|Attached to {{the dome}} is a three-storey {{rectangular}} building which houses the telescope control room, computer room, kitchen etc. Almost no human <b>presence</b> <b>is</b> required inside the dome, {{which means the}} environmental conditions can be kept very stable. As a result, the WHT obtains perfect dome seeing. This building also houses a detector laboratory and a realuminising plant. Because the WHT has the largest single mirror at the Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos, its realuminising plant has a vacuum vessel {{large enough to accommodate}} the mirrors from any other telescope on the mountain. As a result, all of the other telescopes at the observatory contract to use the WHT plant for their realuminising (with the exception of the Gran Telescopio Canarias, which has its own plant).|$|E
5|$|Compared to E.nitidus and E.macconnelli, {{the skull}} is {{relatively}} small and slender. It has broad and short incisive foramina (perforations of the palate between the incisors and the molars) and lacks sphenopalatine vacuities which perforate the mesopterygoid fossa, the gap behind {{the end of the}} palate. The animal is similar to other members of the genus in the pattern of the arteries of the head. The alisphenoid strut, an extension of the alisphenoid bone which separates two foramina (openings) in the skull (the masticatory-buccinator foramen and the foramen ovale accessorium) is rarely present; its <b>presence</b> <b>is</b> more frequent in E.nitidus. The capsular process, a raising of the bone of the mandible (lower jaw) behind the third molar, houses the back end of the lower incisor in most Euryoryzomys, but is absent in E.emmonsae and E.macconnelli. Traits of the teeth {{are similar to those of}} E.nitidus and other Euryoryzomys.|$|E

5|$|Mimesis or cryptic {{aggressive}} mimicry {{is where}} the predator mimics an organism that its prey is indifferent to. Unlike in all cases above, the predator is ignored by the prey, allowing it to avoid detection until the prey are close enough for the predator to strike. This is effectively a form of camouflage. The zone-tailed hawk (Buteo albonotatus), which resembles the turkey vulture (Cathartes aura), may provide one such example. It flies amongst them, suddenly breaking from the formation and ambushing its prey. Here the hawk's <b>presence</b> <b>is</b> of no evident significance to the vultures, affecting them neither negatively or positively. There is some controversy over {{whether this is a}} true case of mimicry.|$|E
5|$|Populations are dense in {{the higher}} {{mountain}} regions of Tasmania. Widespread throughout the state, their <b>presence</b> <b>is</b> known on King Island, located north-west from Tasmania. The ant prefers rural areas, found in warm, dry, open eucalypt woodlands; the climate provides the ant with isolation and warmth. This environment also produces the ant's food, which includes nectar and invertebrate prey. In suburban areas, this ant is found in native vegetation, and use rockeries, cracks in concrete walls, dry dirt and grass to build nests. One study found suburbs with voluminous vegetation cover such as Mount Nelson, Fern Tree and West Hobart host jack jumper populations, while the heavily urbanised suburbs of North Hobart and Battery Point, do not.|$|E
5|$|The Minister of the Interior is {{responsible}} for the national police force, paramilitary force (gendarmerie) and the secret police. The police and gendarmerie are stationed and administered at the local level. However, in 2009 fewer than a third of all communes had access to the services of these security forces, with most lacking local-level headquarters for either corps. Traditional community tribunals, called dina, are presided over by elders and other respected figures and remain a key means by which justice is served in rural areas where state <b>presence</b> <b>is</b> weak. Historically, security has been relatively high across the island. Violent crime rates are low, and criminal activities are predominantly crimes of opportunity such as pickpocketing and petty theft, although child prostitution, human trafficking and the production and sale of marijuana and other illegal drugs are increasing. Budget cuts since 2009 have severely impacted the national police force, producing a steep increase in criminal activity in recent years.|$|E

5|$|The game {{starts with}} an opening crawl {{resembling}} the ones {{featured in the}} Star Wars films. Further story details are presented through the game's instruction manual, pre-mission briefings, characters' conversations during the game and in-game cut scenes. During the Trade Federation's initial invasion of Theed, Lieutenant Gavyn Sykes and Captain Kael are able to escape the capital and head into the surrounding farmland. The two attempt to protect civilian farmers, but Federation <b>presence</b> <b>is</b> too strong, and they retreat into the nearby swamps. There they learn of a smuggler hidden in the mountains who might aid them. With the help of farmer Ved Deviss, Sykes and Kael find Borvo the Hutt. Borvo agrees to assist the resistance movement against the Trade Federation after the group helps him escape Federation forces.|$|E
5|$|The {{main body}} of the {{lacrimal}} is a rounded square with both faces of the bone are concave. Its contact with the nasal is rather limited in both species. The oval-shaped antorbital fenestra is small, being only 9% the length of the eye socket; its <b>presence</b> <b>is</b> unique to both species of the genus among atoposaurids. Meanwhile, the eye socket is large and oval, being 54% longer than it is tall. The drop-shaped palpebrals project out from the tops of the eye sockets. In both species, the back two-thirds of the inner surface of the palpebral is slightly concave. Both species have a squamosal in which the back third is bevelled; in K. langenbergensis, the outer margin is somewhat convex.|$|E
5|$|There are a {{large number}} of battles {{attributed}} to Wellington. Although many leave the impression that he was present or in command at those actions, it was sometimes the case that he entrusted other officers to engage the enemy, such as at remote locations, and that he could not have attended them all in person. Similarly, Wellington was not usually in command of rear guard actions, during advances or retreats, despite his army engaging in them often. Engagements where the lack of his <b>presence</b> <b>is</b> absolutely certain, or where his position is unconfirmed by records and accounts, are not included in his battle record.|$|E

5|$|Twentieth-century Reformed theologian Karl Barth did {{not follow}} the Reformed belief that sacraments are used by God as means of grace. Instead, he saw the Lord's Supper as purely {{symbolic}} and functioning to proclaim God's promises. His position has been called symbolic memorialism because he saw the sacraments function as memorializing Christ's death. Another twentieth-century Reformed theologian, Donald Baillie, took a position {{similar to that of}} John Calvin. Baillie argued that though God is omnipresent, he is present in a special way in the Lord's Supper because he is present by virtue of the believer's faith. Christ's <b>presence</b> <b>is</b> even more real to the believer in the sacrament than is physical reality.|$|E
5|$|Whenever {{the ratio}} of an object's mass to its radius becomes {{sufficiently}} large, general relativity predicts {{the formation of a}} black hole, a region of space from which nothing, not even light, can escape. In the currently accepted models of stellar evolution, neutron stars of around 1.4 solar masses, and stellar black holes with a few to a few dozen solar masses, are thought to be the final state for the evolution of massive stars. Usually a galaxy has one supermassive black hole with a few million to a few billion solar masses in its center, and its <b>presence</b> <b>is</b> thought to have {{played an important role in}} the formation of the galaxy and larger cosmic structures.|$|E
5|$|Cystidia {{that are}} located {{along the edge}} of the cap (called cheilocystidia) are spherical, and 30–120 by 20–74µm. The facial cystidia (called pleurocystidia) are {{club-shaped}} or elongated ellipses, up to 130–155µm in length. The pleurocystidia protrude from the face of the gill and act as guards, preventing adjacent gills from touching each other, and also ensuring that the basidia and spores have sufficient room for development. C.micaceus may also have scattered caulocystidia (cystidia on the stem) that are 60–100 by 5–10µm, but their <b>presence</b> <b>is</b> variable and cannot reliably be used for identification. Both De Bary and Buller, in their investigations into the structure of the cystidia, concluded that there is a central mass of cytoplasm formed where numerous thin plates of cytoplasm meet at the center of the cell. De Bary believed that the plates were filamentous branching processes, but Buller thought that they were formed in a process similar to the walls of foam bubbles, and that the central mass was able to slowly change form and position by altering the relative volumes of the vacuoles enclosed by the numerous thin cytoplasmic walls. In older cells, the cytoplasm may be limited to the periphery of the cell, with one huge vacuole occupying the cell center.|$|E
