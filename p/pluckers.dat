Because of the temperate climate, wheat and potatoes are widely cultivated; they are often intercropped with pumpkin, Phaseolus beans and peas. Because of the temperate climate, also fruit trees, such as plums, peaches, apples and pears, are being cropped in the district. The region {{is well known for}} its bamboo wine (ulanzi), which is prepared from the fermented juice of the wine bamboo (Oxytenanthera). People from Makete District traditionally worked as <b>pluckers</b> on tea plantations of the country. Maize has only recently been introduced. Diverse livestock species are held. While cattle are usually kept on communal grazing land, goats, pigs and poultry are reared close to the homesteads. Inside the houses, {{a large proportion of the}} rural population also keeps domestic cavies (i.e., Guinea pig, Cavia porcellus) for meat production, although they are rarely mentioned in statistics.

50|$|In 2000, the Ahmed {{family of}} Bangladesh {{purchased}} 2,000 {{acres of land}} in the Tetulia region, located against the Himalayas to the north and the Brahmaputra and Ganges rivers to the south. The family hoped the Kazi & Kazi Tea Estate, Ltd. (KKTE), or the Teatulia tea garden, would give the struggling economy a boost by providing the residents of the area with jobs in the tea garden.Plantation for the tea garden began on August 6, 2000. After several years of cultivation, Teatulia’s began to grow organic teas and herbs in its garden. The tea was introduced in the United States in 2005. The tea garden’s foundation is based on Japanese farmer Masanobu Fukuoka's natural farming method, where no machinery, chemicals, or unnatural irrigation are used. For example, naturally growing plants and trees in the region, such as the neem tree (Azadirachta indica), help protect the Camellia sinensis tea plants from insects and pests. The tea is grown in Teatulia’s garden in Bangladesh, handpicked by local tea <b>pluckers,</b> processed in onsite facilities, and then shipped direct to consumers around the world.|$|E
40|$|Managements of tea estates {{have often}} given {{preference}} to female labour over male labour, {{on the assumption}} that women were 'naturally' more suited to plucking tea. They also were thought to be cheaper and more docile than men. In this chapter the author focuses on women <b>pluckers</b> at the Tole Tea Estate, one of the estates in Cameroon owned by the Cameroon Development Corporation (CDC). The estate was constructed in 1954 and marked {{a turning point in the}} history of the CDC. It was the first estate in Cameroon to produce tea and the first estate to recruit predominantly female labour. The author first examines what categories of women tended to sell their labour power to the estate management and how this relates to customary patriarchal controls in the local communities. Then he highlights the intensification of managerial control and exploitation of women <b>pluckers</b> during the economic crisis that has affected the corporation since 1986 - 1987. Finally, he deals with the response of women <b>pluckers</b> to this severe crisis, showing that they have adopted various strategies to cope with the structural adjustment measures which have been planned and implemented by the management in close cooperation with the State-controlled trade union. What emerges from this study is that even during the economic crisis the management has failed to fully control the women <b>pluckers</b> in the labour proces...|$|E
