Testing will include the use of various loads using different input DC voltages not exceeding a maximum output of 90 W. The most important aspects of the outlet are to have a highly-efficient converter efficiency as well as system isolation from the main DC bus on the input. This report will outline the purpose and way of achieving isolation through use of a Flyback DC-DC converter. The user interface is the second significant aspect and details of the <b>plug</b> <b>connection</b> will be detailed along with aspects of how output voltage is selected. Results from the finished project show that the design used does not support the load requirements on the converter.

5|$|To decrypt Enigma messages, {{three pieces}} of {{information}} were needed: (1) a general understanding of how Enigma functioned; (2) the wiring of the rotors; and (3) the daily settings (the sequence and orientations of the rotors, and the <b>plug</b> <b>connections</b> on the plugboard). Rejewski had only the first at his disposal, based on information already acquired by the Cipher Bureau.|$|R
40|$|Development of a nephron is {{induced by}} a {{reciprocal}} exchange of morphogenetic proteins between epithelial and mesenchymal cells within the renal stem/progenitor cell niche. For sustaining concentration of diffusing proteins high, {{it is believed}} that an intimate contact exists between involved cells. However, actual morphological data show that both types of stem/progenitor cell bodies are separated by an interface. To analyze details of this arrangement, neonatal rabbit kidneys were fixed in traditional glutaraldehyde (GA) solution for transmission electron microscopy. For an enhanced contrast fixation of samples was performed in GA solution including either cupromeronic blue, ruthenium red or tannic acid. To record always the same perspective, embedded blocks of parenchyma were cut in orientated vertical and transverse planes to the lumen of lining collecting duct tubules. Screening of samples fixed by GA solution demonstrates a constant separation of stem/progenitor cell bodies by an unobstrusively looking interface. In contrast, improved fixation of specimens in GA solution including cupromeronic blue, ruthenium red or tannic acid unveils between them earlier not visible filigree extracellular matrix. Further projections of mesenchymal cells covered by this matrix cross the interface to contact epithelial cells. The end of a projection does not dangle but is mounted by a special <b>plug</b> <b>connection.</b> At this site the plasma membranes of mesenchymal and epithelial cells are connected via tunneling nanotubes. Regarding this unique arrangement the principal question is to what extent illustrated extracellular matrix and cell-cell connections are involved in the exchange of morphogenetic proteins during induction of a nephron.   Proceedings of the 2 nd International Course on Perinatal Pathology (part of the 11 th International Workshop on Neonatology · October 26 th - 31 st, 2015) · Cagliari (Italy) · October 31 st, 2015 · Stem cells: present and future Guest Editors: Gavino Faa, Vassilios Fanos, Antonio Giordano </p...|$|E
5000|$|The grill {{method is}} {{described}} by Marian Rejewski as being [...] "manual and tedious" [...] and, like the later cryptologic bomb, as being [...] "based... {{on the fact that}} the <b>plug</b> <b>connections</b> the Enigma's commutator, or [...] "plugboard" [...] did not change all the letters." [...] Unlike the bomb, however, [...] "the grill method required unchanged pairs of letters than only unchanged letters." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{order to}} mechanize and {{speed up the}} process, Rejewski, a {{civilian}} mathematician working at the Polish General Staff's Cipher Bureau in Warsaw, invented the [...] "bomba kryptologiczna" [...] (cryptologic bomb), probably in October 1938. Each bomb (six were built in Warsaw for the Cipher Bureau before September 1939) essentially constituted an electrically powered aggregate of six Enigmas and took the place of some one hundred workers. The bomb method was based, like the Poles' earlier [...] "grill" [...] method, {{on the fact that}} the <b>plug</b> <b>connections</b> in the commutator ("plugboard") did not change all the letters. But while the grill method required unchanged pairs of letters, the bomb method required only unchanged letters. Hence it could be applied even though the number of <b>plug</b> <b>connections</b> in this period was between five and eight. In mid-November 1938, the bombs were ready, and the reconstructing of daily keys now took about two hours.|$|R
50|$|In 1944, the Luftwaffe {{introduced}} a plugboard switch, called the Uhr (clock), {{a small box}} containing a switch with 40 positions. It replaced the standard plugs. After connecting the plugs, as determined in the daily key sheet, the operator turned the switch {{into one of the}} 40 positions, each producing a different combination of plug wiring. Most of these <b>plug</b> <b>connections</b> were, unlike the default plugs, not pair-wise. In one switch position, the Uhr did not swap letters, but simply emulated the 13 stecker wires with plugs.|$|R
500|$|After 1 October 1936, German {{procedure}} changed, and {{the number}} of plugboard connections became variable, ranging between five and eight. As a result, the grill method became considerably less effective. However, a method using a card catalog had been devised around 1934 or 1935, and was independent of the number of <b>plug</b> <b>connections.</b> The catalog was constructed using Rejewski's [...] "cyclometer", a special-purpose device for creating a catalog of permutations. Once the catalog was complete, the permutation could be looked up in the catalog, yielding the Enigma rotor settings for that day.|$|R

50|$|Ring {{circuits}} {{are commonly}} used in British wiring with socket-outlets taking fused plugs to BS 1363. Because the breaker rating {{is much higher than}} that of any one socket outlet, the system can only be used with fused plugs or fused appliance outlets. They are generally wired with 2.5 mm2 cable and protected by a 32 A fuse, an older 30 A circuit breaker, or a European harmonised 32 A circuit breaker. Sometimes 4 mm2 cable is used if very long cable runs (to help reduce volt-drop) or derating factors such as very thick thermal insulation are involved. 1.5 mm2 mineral-insulated copper-clad cable (known as pyro) may also be used (as mineral insulated cable can withstand heat more effectively than normal PVC) though more care must be taken with regard to voltage drop on longer runs. The protection devices for the fixed wiring need to be rated higher than would protect flexible appliance cords, so BS 1363 requires that all <b>plugs</b> and <b>connection</b> units incorporate fuses appropriate to the appliance cord.|$|R

50|$|Bad wiring {{junctions}} {{can occur}} in utilization equipment, cords, or in-situ wiring and especially in a defective switch, socket, <b>plug,</b> wiring <b>connection</b> and even at the circuit breaker or fuse panels. Terminal screws loosened by vibration, improper tightening or other causes offer increased resistance to the current, with consequent heating and potential thermal creep, which will cause the termination to loosen further and exacerbate the heating effect. In North America, high resistance junctions are sometimes observed at the terminations of aluminum wire circuits, where oxidation has caused increased resistance, resulting in thermal creep. No technology located in a circuit breaker or fuse panel could detect a high-resistance wiring fault as no measurable characteristic exists that differentiates a glow fault from normal branch circuit operation. Power Fault Circuit Interrupters (PFCI) located in receptacles are designed to prevent fires caused by glowing connections in wiring or panels. From the receptacle a PFCI can detect the voltage drop when high current exists in a high resistance junction. In a properly designed and maintained circuit, substantial voltage drops should never occur. Proper wire terminations inside utilization equipment, such as appliances, and cords prevent high-resistance connections {{that could lead to}} fires.|$|R
