40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} {{strategic}} R&D policy for quality-differentiated products in a thirdmarket trade model. We extend the previous work {{by adding a}} third <b>exporting</b> <b>country,</b> so that the market structure is international triopoly. We show {{that the presence of}} the third <b>exporting</b> <b>country</b> affects strategic R&D policies. With three <b>exporting</b> <b>countries,</b> the lowest-quality <b>exporting</b> <b>country</b> gains from taxing domestic R&D and the middle-quality <b>exporting</b> <b>country</b> gains from subsidizing domestic R&D under both Bertrand and Cournot competition. As in the duopoly case, however, the unilaterally optimal policy for the highest-quality <b>exporting</b> <b>country</b> depends on the mode of competition. Various cases of policy coordination by <b>exporting</b> <b>countries</b> are also examined...|$|R

Some literature measures diversification using {{a country}} scope measure (the {{number of countries}} where there are subsidiary operations {{or the number of}} a firm’s export destinations (George, Wiklund, & Zahra, 2005; Ramaswamy, 1993; Tallman & Li, 1996). However, it is not appropriate when considering export-related exposure to country risks, since firms can export products as samples or in very small quantities but should still be considered as <b>participating</b> in <b>exports.</b> 2 For this research, we use the Herfindahl index to measure <b>country</b> <b>export</b> diversification, since this index measures diversification according to the total sales and sales proportion per destination. The major benefit of the Herfindahl index is that it gives more weight to sales, so it can comprehensively measure diversification. It has also been used in previous research to measure export concentration (Lawless, 2010). Therefore, the <b>export</b> <b>country</b> diversification is: 1 - ∑S [...]...|$|R

Whereas the importing country has the incentive to impose tariffs on the goods coming fi-om the two <b>exporting</b> <b>countries,</b> the <b>export</b> policies chosen by the <b>exporting</b> <b>countries</b> depend on the tariff regime, whether uniform or discriminatory tariffs are used. It is argued that export taxes are chosen by both <b>exporting</b> <b>countries</b> in some cases, and that whereas the importing country prefers a uniform tariff regime, the <b>exporting</b> <b>countries</b> find a discriminatory tariff regime preferable.

40|$|The paper {{explores the}} trade {{competitiveness}} of seven major shrimp <b>exporting</b> <b>countries,</b> namely Vietnam, China, Thailand, Ecuador, India, Indonesia and Mexico, to the USA. Specifically, we investigate whether the United States (US) antidumping petitions {{impact upon the}} bilateral revealed comparative advantage (RCA) indexes {{for each of the}} seven shrimp <b>exporting</b> <b>countries</b> with the USA. Monthly data from January 2003 to December 2014 and the panel data model are used to examine the determinants of the RCA for the shrimp <b>exporting</b> <b>countries.</b> The empirical results show the shrimp <b>exporting</b> <b>countries</b> have superior competitiveness against the shrimp market in the USA. Moreover, the RCA indexes are significantly negatively influenced by shrimp prices, and are positively affected by US income per capita. However, the EMS (Early Mortality Syndrome) shrimp disease, domestic US shrimp quantity, exchange rate, and US antidumping laws are found to have no significant impacts on the RCA indexes. In terms of policy implications, the USA should try to reduce production costs of shrimp in the US market instead of imposing antidumping petitions, and the shrimp <b>exporting</b> <b>countries</b> should maintain their comparative advantage and diversify into new markets...|$|R

40|$|In a three-country model, {{this paper}} investigates {{linkages}} between merger incentives of exporting firms {{and the trade}} policy of an importing <b>country.</b> When <b>exporting</b> firms come from only one country, the tariff response of the importing country reverses the welfare effects of a merger in the <b>exporting</b> <b>country.</b> If there exist two <b>exporting</b> <b>countries,</b> a merger creates two types of conflicting international externalities. First, a merger in one <b>exporting</b> <b>country</b> increases profits of all firms.

40|$|Previous {{work has}} {{documented}} that oil price changes have nonlinear {{effects in the}} economy and in stock market returns. We show that the nonlinear effects are different depending on whether countries are energy dependent or not. While price soars seem to {{have a negative effect on}} the stock markets of oil energy dependent countries, they have a positive effect on the stock markets of oil <b>exporting</b> <b>countries.</b> Stock market returns are negatively affected by oil price volatility in energy dependent countries and positively in oil <b>exporting</b> <b>countries.</b> Moreover, we find bi-directional effects between oil price increases and some oil volatility measures that can be reinforced with volatility feedback. The asymmetric effects found in oil dependent and oil <b>exporting</b> <b>countries</b> seem to fit into the offset mechanism proposed in the literature where oil price shocks interact both with oil price volatility and the economy. The results are also consistent with the finding that oil <b>exporting</b> <b>countries</b> benefit economically from oil price hikes...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{empirical}} determinants of import demand in oil <b>exporting</b> <b>countries.</b> Using a new dataset including a large {{cross section of}} oil <b>exporting</b> <b>countries,</b> we show with a panel cointegration analysis that import demand in these countries depends positively on domestic demand and exports, the real exchange rate {{and the price of}} oil. Fiscal surpluses, on the other hand, tend to reduce the demand for imports. More specifically, our import elasticities estimated for oil <b>exporting</b> <b>countries</b> are not far from estimates found in the literature on industrial countries. In particular, we conclude that the import elasticity with respect to domestic activity is larger than one – a finding which is in contrast to standard theoretical predictions but in line with most empirical findings for other countries. These results are robust over a wide set of alternative specifications. JEL Classification: F 14, F 01, Q 43 Import Equation, oil <b>exporting</b> <b>countries,</b> Panel Cointegration...|$|R

40|$|The {{oil price}} shocks are an {{important}} source that affect on TOT in both oil <b>exporting</b> and importing <b>countries.</b> Hence, this paper compares the effects of real oil price shock on TOT in both oil importing and <b>exporting</b> <b>countries,</b> using Panel Data technique and during 1980 - 2010. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, we applied the nonlinear approach in order to assess the asymmetric impact of the oil price shocks on TOT. The results show that the oil price shocks influenced the TOT in the oil <b>exporting</b> and importing <b>countries,</b> differently. So that, in oil <b>exporting</b> <b>countries,</b> positive (negative) oil price shocks have significantly positive (negative) effect on their TOT, while in oil importing countries, positive (negative) oil price shocks have significantly a negative (positive) effect on TOT. Furthermore, the findings reveal that in the oil <b>exporting</b> <b>countries,</b> the effect of negative oil price shocks on TOT is more than positive oil price shocks.
