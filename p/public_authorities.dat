5|$|Errors of law {{committed}} by <b>public</b> <b>authorities</b> when they act or make decisions {{are within the}} jurisdiction of the High Court of Singapore to correct by way of judicial review. On the other hand, the Court is generally unwilling to intervene where the alleged error is one that concerns the facts of the matter. The rationale for this rule is that it is the Court's role in judicial review of administrative action to scrutinize the legality and not the merits of the decisions of <b>public</b> <b>authorities.</b>|$|E
5|$|By Justinian's time, {{the scheme}} was simpler: instead of {{complementing}} actions for manifest and non-manifest theft, handling stolen goods, or concealing them made one instead liable for non-manifest theft, whose two-times penalty was maintained. Searches {{were carried out}} by <b>public</b> <b>authorities,</b> and the wide definition of theft covered a bad faith receiver of goods.|$|E
5|$|The aim of {{administrative}} law is {{to regulate the}} executive government by providing remedies which individuals can apply for when challenging administrative actions and decisions, and failures to take action and make decisions. Where the exercise of statutory or other discretionary power by <b>public</b> <b>authorities</b> contravenes the Constitution or is unlawful under administrative law, various remedies may be available when a judicial review action is taken.|$|E

40|$|This paper studies {{political}} accountability under various contractual forms of Public Private Partnerships. A critical aspect of any PPP contract is {{the allocation of}} demand risk between the <b>public</b> <b>authority</b> and the private provider. We show that contracts in which the private provider bears all demand risk motivate more the <b>public</b> <b>authority</b> from responding to customer needs, since they empower consumers, which provides the <b>public</b> <b>authority</b> with more credibility in side-trading. The policy implication is that the current greater resort to contracts in which the <b>public</b> <b>authority</b> retains all demand risk may not be optimal in terms of allocative efficiency. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper uses a {{systematic}} literature review {{to suggest that}} three emerging critical approaches {{to the production of}} <b>public</b> <b>authority</b> are identifiable within the contemporary literature on conflict-affected and transitioning regions. The authors term these approaches the ‘public authority from below perspective’, the ‘hybrid political orders lens’, and ‘political settlements analysis’. Although hailing from diverse disciplinary backgrounds, the paper argues that these approaches share important traits. First, they suggest that to understand better the nature of <b>public</b> <b>authority</b> in transitioning and conflict-affected regions it is necessary to uncover how <b>public</b> <b>authority</b> actually works rather than departing from a theory of the state. This includes accounting for how power is legitimated and practiced within each context, and how claims to <b>public</b> <b>authority</b> are connected to the provision of public goods such as security and justice. Second, they view competition, conflict and contestation as enduring features of <b>public</b> <b>authority</b> in such contexts, and call for empirical examinations of these processes to inform understandings of social change. Third, these approaches argue that <b>public</b> <b>authority</b> is an emergent property, always in production and never definitively formed. This implies that neat dichotomies such as formal/informal, private/public, and modern/traditional should be applied with caution by analysts seeking to understand <b>public</b> <b>authority</b> from the perspective of people living with insecurity and change. Despite these similarities, the paper's conclusion suggests that these approaches should be unpacked and their normative assumptions challenged. Each can then be drawn upon to arrive at empirical understandings of how <b>public</b> <b>authority</b> is produced and exercised, and how it relates to the provision of public goods in conflict-affected and transitioning regions...|$|R
5|$|Threshold {{issues are}} legal {{requirements}} in Singapore administrative law {{that must be}} satisfied by applicants before their claims for judicial review of acts or decisions of <b>public</b> <b>authorities</b> {{can be dealt with}} by the High Court. These include showing that they have standing (locus standi) to bring cases, and that the matters are amenable to judicial review and justiciable by the Court.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} colonial period, {{under the rule}} of the House of Bourbon, the ideas of the Enlightenment on public health and social control shaped the {{development}} of Lima. New buildings undertaken during this period include a cockfighting coliseum and a bullring, the Plaza de toros de Acho, as well as the General Cemetery. The first two were built to regulate these popular activities by centralizing them at a single venue, while the cemetery {{put an end to the}} practice of burials at churches which was considered unhealthy by <b>public</b> <b>authorities.</b>|$|E
5|$|Errors as to {{precedent}} facts, {{sometimes called}} jurisdictional facts, in Singapore administrative law are errors committed by <b>public</b> <b>authorities</b> concerning facts that must objectively exist or not exist before the authorities {{have the power}} to take actions or make decisions under legislation. If an error concerning a precedent fact is made, the statutory power has not been exercised lawfully and may be quashed by the High Court if judicial review is applied for by an aggrieved person. The willingness of the Court to review such errors of fact is an exception to the general rule that the Court only reviews errors of law.|$|E
50|$|In 1921, the {{legislature}} chartered {{the first state}} <b>public</b> <b>authority,</b> the Port of New York Authority, as a new vehicle for financing public projects while insulating the state from long term debt obligations. In 1926, the Court of Appeals held in Williamsburgh Savings Bank v. State, 243 N.Y. 231, that the state could disclaim any moral obligation for <b>public</b> <b>authority</b> debts. However, amendments to the 1938 Constitution overruled this case and completely disclaimed the state's responsibility for any <b>public</b> <b>authority</b> debt.|$|R

5|$|The Court of Appeal {{emphasized}} that the approach taken in that case made no formal distinction between procedural and substantive unfairness. Substantive legitimate expectation does not intrude upon the executive's policy-making powers, {{as it is for}} <b>public</b> <b>authorities,</b> acting within their statutory powers, to adopt or change policies. The reasons for doing so are not usually open to judicial review. On the other hand, it is the job of the courts to determine whether an authority's application of a policy to an individual who has been led to expect something different is a just exercise of power.|$|E
5|$|The High Court {{agreed with}} the {{plaintiff}} that since the PSA had authority {{to decide how to}} allocate berths, it was also entrusted with the duty to exercise that discretion after taking various key factors into consideration, and would have acted unlawfully if it had abrogated its responsibility by taking orders from other <b>public</b> <b>authorities</b> such as the Gambling Suppression Branch or the Singapore Tourist Promotion Board unless it was under a statutory duty to do so. However, on the facts of the case, the decision to deny berths to the plaintiff's cruise ship had been taken by the PSA alone.|$|E
5|$|The {{doctrine}} of legitimate expectation in Singapore protects both procedural and substantive rights. In administrative law, a legitimate expectation generally arises when {{there has been}} a representation of a certain outcome by the <b>public</b> <b>authorities</b> to an individual. To derogate from the representation may amount to an abuse of power or unfairness. The {{doctrine of}} legitimate expectation as a ground to quash decisions of <b>public</b> <b>authorities</b> has been firmly established by the English courts. Thus, where a public authority has made a representation to an individual who would be affected by a decision by the authority, the individual has a legitimate expectation to have his or her views heard before the decision is taken. Alternatively, an individual may also have a legitimate expectation to a substantive right. The recognition of substantive legitimate expectations is somewhat controversial as it requires a balancing of the requirements of fairness against the reasons for any change in the authority's policy. This suggests the adoption of a free-standing proportionality approach, which has been said not to apply in administrative law.|$|E

5|$|In 1998, {{the number}} of U.S. {{commercial}} radio stations had grown to 4,793 AM stations and 5,662 FM stations. In addition, there are 1,460 public radio stations. Most of these stations are run by universities and <b>public</b> <b>authorities</b> for educational purposes and are financed by public or private funds, subscriptions and corporate underwriting. Much public-radio broadcasting is supplied by NPR (formerly National Public Radio). NPR was incorporated in February 1970 under the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967; its television counterpart, PBS, was also created by the same legislation. (NPR and PBS are operated separately from each other.) , there are 15,433 licensed full-power radio stations in the U.S. according to the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC).|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that a question of fact involves a matter concerning primary facts such as a new witness or what people saw or heard, while a question of law involves an application of a statutory word or phase to such facts. However, this distinction is debatable, and the view has been taken that courts sometimes simply regard a matter as one involving an error of law if they wish to adopt an interventionist approach, and seek to allow judicial review to take place. In any case, it is said that the courts generally treat errors of fact committed by <b>public</b> <b>authorities</b> differently from errors of law. While errors of law are regarded by the courts as within their jurisdiction and thus subject to judicial review, they show more reluctance to intervene when errors of fact are alleged.|$|E
5|$|Academics have {{expressed}} scepticism {{as to whether}} the doctrine of legitimate expectation should apply to substantive rights. Thio Li-ann argues that legitimate expectations should relate only to procedural rather than substantive rights. Procedural protection only has a minimal impact on the administrative autonomy of the relevant public authority, since the court is only concerned with {{the manner in which the}} decision was made and not whether the decision was fair. Thus, the ultimate autonomy of <b>public</b> <b>authorities</b> is never placed in jeopardy. Conversely, as Mark Elliot posits, giving effect to a substantive legitimate expectation impinges on the separation of powers. The authority has been entrusted by Parliament to make decisions about the allocation of resources in public interest. Applying legitimate expectation substantively allows the courts to inquire into the merits of the decision. Such interference with the public authority's discretion would be overstepping their role and exceeding their proper constitutional function.|$|E
