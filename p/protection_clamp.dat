40|$|Electrostatic {{discharges}} (ESDs) are everywhere—in {{our homes}} and businesses. Even {{the manufacturers of}} the electronics experi-ence ESD failures in their factories. Electronic devices are sensitive to ESD. ESD results in failure of our computers, calculators, and car phones. There are ways to protect these sensitive components. This paper looks at ESD protection from a two-pronged approach: reducing the likelihood of having an ESD event and improving the robustness of the devices themselves. The first approach focuses on {{reducing the amount of}} charge that is developed and controlling the redistribution of any charges that are developed. The second ap-proach reviews ways to improve the circuit robustness by improving individual circuit elements and by adding additional elements for charge flow control and voltage clamping.

40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} {{the design}} strategies {{used to protect}} RF circuits that are implemented in CMOS technologies. It investigates, in detail, the physical mechanisms involved when a ggNMOS structure is exposed to an ESD event and undergoes snapback. The understanding gained is used {{to understand why the}} performance of the current RF ESD clamp is poor and suggestions are made as to how the performance of ggNMOS clamps can be improved beyond the current body of knowledge. The ultimate aim {{is to be able to}} design effective ESD <b>protection</b> <b>clamps</b> whilst minimising the effect the circuit has on RF I/O signals. A current ggNMOS based RF ESD I/O protection circuit is analysed in detail using a Transmission Line Pulse (TLP) tester. This is shown to be a very effective diagnostic tool by showing many characteristics of the ggNMOS during the triggering and conducting phase of the ESD event and demonstrate deficiencies in the clamp design. The use of a FIB enhances the analysis by allowing the isolation of individual components in the circuit and therefore their analysis using the TLP tester. SPICE simulations are used to provide further commentary on the debate surrounding the specification required of a TLP tester for there to be a good correlation between a TLP test and the industry standard Human Body Model (HBM) ESD test. Finite element simulations are used to probe deeper in to the mechanisms involved when a ggNMOS undergoes snapback especially with regard to the contribution parasitic components within the ggNMOS make to the snapback process. New ggNMOS clamps are proposed which after some modification are shown to work. Some of the finite element experiments are repeated in a 0. 18 μπ 7. process CMOS test chip and a comparison is made between the two sets of results. In the concluding chapter understanding that has been gained from previous chapters is combined with the published body of knowledge to suggest and explain improvements in the design of a ggNMOS for RF and standard applications. These improvements will improve homogeneity of ggNMOS operation thus allowing the device size to be reduced and parasitic loading for a given ESD performance. These techniques can also be used to ensure that the ESD current does not take an unintended path through the chip. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|The {{definitive}} {{version is}} available at www. blackwell-synergy. comIntroduction: Inadequate or zero cardiac perfusion, if prolonged beyond about 10 minutes, can result in irreversible cell damage. Paradoxically, much of this damage occurs when perfusion is restored, and {{this appears to be}} linked to an uncontrolled rise in intracellular calcium. This article reviews the causes of this rise in calcium. Methods and results: Data that have arisen from a variety of techniques to measure intracellular ion concentrations in cardiac cells are reviewed. Fluorescence measurements in intact hearts and isolated cells show that the rise in [Ca 2 +]i is preceded by a rise in [Na+]i, a finding that has led to the coupled exchanger theory, which postulates that the high activity of the Na–H exchanger, as a result of intracellular acidification, increases [Na+]i and that this slows or reverses the Na–Ca exchanger. However, the [Na+]i appears to come from several sources: the Na–H exchanger, the Na–HCO 3 symporter, and the persistent Na+ current, INa(p). The latter appears to be important because blockers of Na–H exchange (e. g., Cariporide) {{have been shown to be}} only partially protective against reperfusion damage, whereas TTX and other Na+ channel blockers offer equal or better <b>protection.</b> Patch <b>clamp</b> experiments in isolated cells have shown that INa(p) is increased by hypoxia, although the mechanisms are not known. Conclusion: Blockers of INa(p) may provide an alternative strategy for preventing reperfusion damage in myocardium, either alone or in combination with Na–H exchange blockers. David A. Sain...|$|R

40|$|AIM: The {{aim of this}} Italian {{prospective}} registry was {{to evaluate}} the applicability and efficacy of the Mo. Ma Device (Invatec, Roncadelle, Italy) {{for the prevention of}} cerebral embolization during carotid artery stenting (CAS) in a real world population. METHODS: In 4 Italian centers, 416 patients (300 men; mean age 71. 6 +/- 9 years) between October 2001 and March 2005 were enrolled in a prospective registry. Two-hundred and sixty-four symptomatic (63. 46 %) with > 50 % diameter stenosis and 152 (36. 54 %) asymptomatic patients with > 70 % diameter stenosis were included. The Mo. Ma Proximal Flow Blockage Embolic Protection System was used to perform protected CAS, achieving cerebral <b>protection</b> by endovascular <b>clamping</b> of the common carotid artery (CCA) and of the external carotid artery (ECA). RESULTS: Technical success, defined as the ability to establish protection with the Mo. Ma device and to deploy the stent, was achieved in 412 cases (99. 03 %). The mean duration of flow blockage was 4. 91 +/- 1. 1 min. Transient intolerances to flow blockage were observed in 24 patients (5. 76 %), but in all cases the procedure was successfully completed. No peri-procedural strokes and deaths were observed. Complications during hospitalization included 16 minor strokes (3. 84 %), 3 transient ischemic attacks (0. 72 %), 2 deaths (0. 48 %) and 1 major stroke (0. 24 %). This resulted in a cumulative rate at discharge of 4. 56 % all strokes and deaths, and of 0. 72 % major strokes and deaths. All the patients underwent thirty-day follow-up. At thirty-day follow-up, there were no deaths and no minor and major strokes, confirming the overall cumulative 4. 56 % incidence of all strokes and deaths rate, and of 0. 72 % rate of major strokes and deaths at follow up. In 245 cases (58. 89 %) there was macroscopic evidence of debris after filtration of the aspirated blood. CONCLUSIONS: This Italian multicenter registry confirms and further supports the efficacy and applicability of the endovascular clamping concept with proximal flow blockage in a broad patient series.

40|$|Electrostatic {{discharge}} (ESD) is {{a well-known}} contributor that reduces the reliability and yield of the integrated circuits (ICs). As ICs become more complex, they are increasingly susceptible to such failures due to the scaling of physical dimensions of devices and interconnect on a chip [1]. These failures are caused by excessive electric field and/or excessive current densities and result in the dielectric breakdown, electromigration of metal lines and contacts. ESD can affect the IC in its different life stages, from wafer fabrication process to failure in the field. Furthermore, ESD events can damage the integrated circuit permanently (hard failure), or cause a latent damage (soft failure) [2]. ESD protection circuits consisting of I/O protection and ESD power supply clamps are routinely used in ICs to protect them against ESD damage. The main objective of the ESD protection circuit {{is to provide a}} low-resistive discharge path between any two pins of the chip to harmlessly discharge ESD energy without damaging the sensitive circuits. The main target of this thesis is to design ESD power supply clamps that have the lowest possible leakage current without degrading the ESD protection ability in general purpose TSMC 65 nm CMOS technology. ESD clamps should have a very low-leakage current and should be stable and immune to the power supply noise under the normal operating conditions of the circuit core. Also, the ESD clamps must be able to handle high currents under an ESD event. All designs published in the general purpose 65 nm CMOS technology have used the SCR as the clamping element since the SCR has a higher current carrying capability compared to an MOS transistor of the same area [3]. The ESD power supply clamp should provide a low-resistive path in both directions to {{be able to deal with}} both PSD and NDS zapping modes. The SCR based design does not provide the best ESD protection for the NDS zapping mode (positive ESD stress at VSS with grounded VDD node) since it has two parasitic resistances (RNwell and RPsub) and one parasitic diode (the collector to base junction diode of the PNP transistor) in the path from the VSS to VDD. Furthermore, SCR-based designs are not suitable for application that exposed to hot switching or ionizing radiation [2]. In GP process, the gate oxide thickness of core transistors is reduced compared with LP process counterpart to achieve higher performance designs for high-frequency applications using 1 V core transistors and 2. 5 V I/O option. The thinner gate oxide layer results in higher leakage current due to gate tunneling [4]. Therefore, using large thin oxide MOS transistors as clamping elements will result in a huge leakage. In this thesis, four power supply ESD clamps are proposed in which thick oxide MOS transistors are used as the main clamping element. Therefore, the low-leakage current feature is achieved without significantly degrading the ESD performance. In addition, the parasitic diode of the MOS transistors provides the protection against NSD-mode. In this thesis, two different ESD power supply clamp architectures are proposed: standalone ESD power supply clamps and hybrid ESD power supply clamps. Two standalone clamps are proposed: a transient PMOS based ESD clamp with thyristor delay element (PTC), and a static diode triggered power supply (DTC). The standalone clamps were designed to protect the circuit core against ± 125 V CDM stress by limiting the voltage between the two power rails to less than the oxide breakdown voltage of the core transistors, BVOXESD = 5 V. The large area of this architecture was the price for maintaining the low-leakage current and an adequate ESD <b>protection.</b> The hybrid <b>clamp</b> architecture was proposed to provide a higher ESD protection, against ± 300 V CDM stress, while reducing the layout area and maintaining the low-leakage feature. In the hybrid clamp structure, two clamps are connected in parallel between the two power supply rails, a static clamp, and a transient clamp. The static clamp triggers first and starts to sink the ESD energy and then an RC network triggers the primary transient clamp to sink most of the ESD stress. Two hybrid designs were proposed: PMOS ESD power supply clamp with thyristor delay element and diodes (PTDC), and NMOS ESD power supply clamp with level shifter delay element and diode (NLDC). Simulation results show that the proposed clamps are capable of protecting the circuit core against ± 1. 5 kV HBM and at least against ± 125 V CDM stresses. The measurement results show that all of the proposed clamps are immune against false triggering, and transient induced latch-up. Furthermore, all four designs have responded favorably to the 4 V ESD-like pulse voltage under both chip powered and not powered conditions and after the stress ends the designs turned off. Finally, TLP measurement results show that all four proposed designs meet the minimum design requirement of the ESD protection circuit in the 65 nm CMOS technology (i. e. HBM protection level of ± 1. 5 kV) ...|$|R
