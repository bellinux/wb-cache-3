The <b>common</b> <b>trunk</b> of {{the intermediate}} and left hepatic veins showed 5 types of termination of intermediate and left hepatic vv. : classification of Nakamura. In types A, B, C, and D, the intermediate and left hepatic veins showed a <b>common</b> <b>trunk</b> in 31 / 40 or 77. 5 % of cases, that flowed into the inferior vena cava. Whereas in type A termination (3 / 40 cases) <b>common</b> <b>trunks</b> of 1 cm or over {{which do not}} receive a branch in the last cm, in type B terminations (11 / 40 cases) the trunk received two branches less than 1 cm from the IVC,ie, short trunks, or trunks of over 1 cm associated with one branch, in type C terminations (12 / 40 cases), the <b>common</b> <b>trunks</b> having three branches less than 1 cm from the IVC and in type D terminations (5 / 40 cases),the trunk received four branches. The diameter of the <b>common</b> <b>trunk</b> was 16. 09 ± 3. 3 mm and its length, 7. 5 ± 2. 3 mm. In type E terminations (9 / 40 or 22. 5 % of cases), the intermediate and left hepatic veins ended separately in the inferior vena cava.

40|$|This {{study was}} done to {{identify}} the normal and variants of saphenous tributaries in Korean adults. The pattern of confluence of saphenous tributaries, medial accessory saphenous, lateral accessory saphenous, superficial epigastric, superficial circumflex iliac and superficial external pudendal veins, was carefully examined in 249 lower limbs (right, 129; left, 120) of embalmed Korean cadavers (73 males & 56 females). The medial accessory saphenous vein drained into the great saphenous vein directly (in 82. 3 %) or by a <b>common</b> <b>trunk</b> (in 17. 7 %) with the superficial epigastric or superficial external pudendal vein. The lateral accessory saphenous vein entered the great saphenous (in 67. 1 %) or the femoral vein (in 32. 9 %) directly or, forming a <b>common</b> <b>trunk</b> with other saphenous tributaries. The superficial epigastric vein joined the great saphenous (in 77. 1 %) or the femoral vein (in 22. 9 %) directly or, by a <b>common</b> <b>trunk</b> with other saphenous tributaries. The superficial circumflex iliac vein reached the great saphenous (in 83. 1 %) or the femoral vein (in 16. 9 %) directly or, by a <b>common</b> <b>trunk</b> with other saphenous tributaries. The superficial external pudendal vein opened into the great saphenous (in 95. 2 %) or the femoral vein (in 4. 8 %) directly or by a <b>common</b> <b>trunk</b> with other saphenous tributaries. In Koreans, the incidence of the normal pattern of saphenous tributaries was 23. 7 % and in 76. 3 % any one of variant saphenous tributaries entered the femoral or the great saphenous vein by a <b>common</b> <b>trunk</b> with other saphenous tributaries...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{internal}} iliac artery (IIA) {{is one of}} {{the branches}} of the common iliac artery and supplies the pelvic viscera, the musculoskeletal part of the pelvis, the gluteal region, the medial thigh region and the perineum. During routine cadaveric dissection of a male cadaver for undergraduate Medical students, we observed variation in the course and branching pattern of the left IIA. The artery gave rise to two <b>common</b> <b>trunks</b> and then to the middle rectal artery, inferior vesicle artery and superior vesicle artery. The first, slightly larger, <b>common</b> <b>trunk</b> gave rise to an unnamed artery, the lateral sacral artery and the superior gluteal artery. The second, smaller, <b>common</b> <b>trunk</b> entered the gluteal region through the greater sciatic foramen, below the piriformis muscle and presented a stellate branching pattern deep to the gluteus maximus muscle. Two of the arteries forming the stellate pattern were the internal pudendal artery and the inferior gluteal artery. The other two were muscular branches...|$|R

We report multiple variations of the nerves of gluteal region through this article. In the current case, the sciatic nerve was absent. The common peroneal and tibial nerves arose from sacral plexus and reached the gluteal region through greater sciatic foramen above and below piriformis respectively. The common peroneal nerve gave a muscular branch to the gluteus maximus. The inferior gluteal nerve and posterior cutaneous nerve of the thigh arose from a <b>common</b> <b>trunk.</b> The <b>common</b> <b>trunk</b> was formed by three roots.

40|$|The {{importance}} of the superficial external pudendal artery in cases of lower limb obstructive arteriopathies has been established, and a perfect knowledge of its anatomy is desirable {{for the creation of}} successful flaps involving it. However, little information is available on the morphometry of this artery. PURPOSE: In this study, we conducted a quantitative investigation of the superficial external pudendal artery as the basis for skin grafts. METHOD: Twenty-five right and left sides of the inguinal region of male cadavers were dissected. After retracting the skin at the inguinal region, the femoral vessels and the sapheno-femoral junction were exposed. The following aspects were then analyzed: 1) the presence of the superficial external pudendal artery, 2) the place of origin of the superficial external pudendal artery and the <b>common</b> <b>trunk,</b> 3) the duplication of the superficial external pudendal artery, 4) the distance from the superficial external pudendal artery or the <b>common</b> <b>trunk</b> to the inguinal ligament, and 5) the diameter of the superficial external pudendal artery. RESULTS: The results were the following: 1) superficial external pudendal arteries were found in 46 of 50 sides (92 %); 2) they originated from the femoral artery in 45 cases and from the deep femoral artery in only 1 case; 3) the arteries were found duplicated in 21 cases (46 %), as a <b>common</b> <b>trunk</b> in 11 cases (24 %), and as a single artery in 14 cases (30 %); 4) the distance from the superficial external pudendal artery to the inguinal ligament ranged from 0. 8 cm to 8. 5 cm; from the <b>common</b> <b>trunk,</b> it ranged from 3. 5 cm to 6. 7 cm; 5) the diameter of the superficial external pudendal artery ranged from 1. 2 mm to 3. 8 mm; and 6) the diameter of the <b>common</b> <b>trunk</b> ranged from 1. 35 mm to 5. 15 mm. CONCLUSION: The results show that the superficial external pudendal artery generally originates from the femoral artery. It was found as a <b>common</b> <b>trunk,</b> duplicated, or as a single artery. There was a great variability in both the diameter of the artery and the distance from the artery to the inguinal ligament.

The portal vein was cannulated and perfusedwith a vinyl acetate solution and the liver immersed in sulfuric acid solution to obtain vascular casts. The liver presented five lobes, which were named left lateral, left medial, square, right lateral, right medial, and caudate lobes with caudate and papillary processes. The portal vein, entering the portal fissure, divided into two branches, {{the right and left}} ones, as it entered the portal fissure. The right branch emitted isolated or <b>common</b> <b>trunk</b> branches to the right lateral lobe and to the caudate process of caudate lobe. On its turn, the left main branch of portal vein divided into two other branches. One of them formed a <b>common</b> <b>trunk</b> for the left lateral, left medial, and square lobes, being the two last ones in a common way. The second branch coursed towards to the right medial branch.
