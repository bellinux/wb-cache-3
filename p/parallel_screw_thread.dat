40|$|Abstract. <b>Screw</b> <b>thread</b> {{connection}} {{is a common}} way of detachable connection. The invalidation of <b>screw</b> <b>thread</b> connection will lead to mechanical failure or even retirement. Vibration tapping is essentially a kind of high-energy impact cutting which increases the rigidity of the tool. Composite vibration tapping simultaneously with repeated cutting action reduces the surface recovery of plastic materials and enhances metal cutting rate. Theoretical study and experimental results show that vibration tapping improves the metal cutting rates, enhances the machining accuracy and makes <b>screw</b> <b>thread</b> connection assembly easier. At the same time, vibration tapping process does not reduce the strength of <b>screw</b> <b>thread.</b> As the <b>screw</b> <b>thread</b> can be more uniformed cut at different depths, vibration tapping enhances the strength of <b>screw</b> <b>thread</b> slightly...|$|R

40|$|Fine <b>screw</b> <b>threads</b> {{are widely}} used for the bolted joints under severe running conditions. It {{is well known that}} they are {{effective}} to prevent thread loosening due to fine pitch. As for other mechanical characteristics, it has been reported in the previous paper using complex stress functions that the stress concentration at bolt thread root is higher than coarse <b>screw</b> <b>threads</b> and the fatigue strength of threaded fasteners shows a minimum value for varying pitch. However, the latter is questionable since the calculations were conducted under lots of hypotheses. In this study, stress concentration and stress amplitude along thread root are evaluated by three-dimensional finite element analysis, in which numerical models of the bolted joints are constructed so as to accurately represent the effect of thread helical geometry. It is shown that the stress concentration at thread root of fine <b>screw</b> <b>threads</b> is higher than that of coarse <b>screw</b> <b>threads,</b> and the maximum stress amplitude is likely to be lower on the contrary. Meanwhile, it is sometimes recognized that clamping forces of fine <b>screw</b> <b>threads</b> are smaller comparing to those of coarse <b>screw</b> <b>threads</b> when tightened with same torque. To clarify this contradictory phenomenon, tightening experiments are conducted, and it is found that the difference of the energy needed for tightening <b>screw</b> <b>threads</b> is found to be the major cause. 1...|$|R

The optimized parameters are output power, frequency, and thickness of steel tube wall, high degree of <b>screw</b> <b>threads,</b> induction coil current, relative speed, and medium jet pressure, respectively.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} requirements imposed to the modern mechanisms is economic feasibility. Therefore, considered as advanced are mechanical transducers of rotary motion to translational one, where rolling friction is mainly realized. They include planetary roller-screw mechanisms (PRSM). PRSM has a large variety of features. The design feature of PRSM is multiple starts of <b>screw</b> and nut <b>thread.</b> Rollers, as a rule, are made single-threaded. Number of <b>screw</b> <b>thread</b> starts which equals to a number of nut thread starts, has an effect on almost all performance characteristics of PRSM. This article covers comprehensively enough the influence of <b>screw</b> <b>thread</b> starts quantity on: kinematical parameters of PRSM, transfer function, mechanism radial dimensions, efficiency, power values, required characteristics of electric motor. As a result of investigations the graphs of dimensionless parameters vs. number of <b>screw</b> <b>thread</b> starts have been plotted, which are demonstrative and common. Being high enough the PRSM efficiency can vary within 20 … 25 % and more. It depends on a variety of mechanism part parameters; primarily on geometrical ones, as well as on a number of <b>screw</b> <b>thread</b> starts. Previously the methods of PRSM design calculation consisted in determination of the main geometric parameters of mechanism parts, then in determination of mechanism efficiency. At that, it was not always possible to design the economically feasible PRSM structure. Introduction of a dimensionless value – a relation of PRSM part thread pitch to average <b>screw</b> <b>thread</b> diameter – contributed to successive plotting of the assemblage of curves for relation of efficiency to the indicated ratio and a number of <b>screw</b> <b>thread</b> starts. By taking this assemblage of curves as a basis, the method of economically feasible PRSM structures calculation and design was proposed.   The essence of the developed method lies in that selection or definition of a number of <b>screw</b> <b>thread</b> starts helps to determine the relation of PRSM parts thread pitch to average diameter of <b>screw</b> <b>thread</b> which provides the maximum possible efficiency. Given further are check calculations confirming the operation capability of the selected PRSM design. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Because of the {{importance}} of <b>screw</b> <b>threads</b> in machine elements, <b>screw</b> <b>thread</b> measurement and inspection has been debated extensively for more than 20 years. There are about 30 separate geometrical features and dimensional characteristics in the design and construction of <b>screw</b> <b>threads.</b> Therefore many methods have been developed for measuring and inspecting these features. Most of these methods are limited to measuring or inspecting a small number of features. In this paper, a novel system has been developed, using a Measurescope, personal computer and developed software, for measuring and inspecting most of the common types of <b>screw</b> <b>thread.</b> The system is capable of measuring the most common features of <b>screw</b> <b>threads</b> (16 features). Repeatability of measurements is also provided to obtain accurate measurements and useful statistical parameters. In addition, the system is capable of inspecting threads based on a reference thread and given tolerances for the measured features. The traceability process and the uncertainty budget of the developed system are presented. The developed software, named AutoMIST, is fully written in house using Microsoft Visual Cþþ 6. 0 and it is ready to run on any Windows 1 environment...|$|R
