40|$|First and foremost, I {{would like}} to thank my parents. To them I owe much of who I am and what I have accomplished. Without their {{encouragement}} and support, it would have been impossible for me to even dream of flying across the Pacific Ocean to the United States to <b>pursue</b> <b>my</b> <b>career</b> <b>in</b> science. To my mentor. Dr. Simon C.

Without him, I would {{have not been able to}} accomplish the work presented here. I also feel very grateful for the precious advice that he has provided me not just on sciences but also on life, not just as a mentor but also as a friend. Thanks should also go to the other members of my committee: Drs. Charles Faust, Curt Pfarr, Daniel Hardy, and Elmus Beale. I would also like to thank Demet Nalbant and Jingyong Kim who carried out the RDA experiments described in Chapter IV.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is dedicated}} to my father, Slater Hunter King, who inspired me {{to work for the}} educational betterment of all children. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS There are many people that I would like to recognize who inspired me to move down the path of <b>pursuing</b> <b>my</b> <b>career</b> <b>in</b> Higher Education. First and foremost, I would like to thank my wife Esther, who supported me from the very start, and continued to provide me with unconditional love, encouragement, and sustenance during the hard times and the lean times. Her steadfastness in supporting me during this period was the foundation on which our family rested. I am eternally indebted to her for the sacrifices that she made to keep our family safe and secure while I was away on school and business trips. I am especially grateful to my Mother who was always a source of spiritual strength and guidance to me during my tenure as a graduate student. Her special knack of getting me to see the end in the beginning enabled me to enjoy the process of being a student again, as well as kept my eyes fixed on the prize of finishing my coursework in a timely manner...|$|R
40|$|Ethnographic {{studies of}} youth subcultures, scenes and urban tribes often rely on insiders' accounts, where {{researchers}} investigate a social environment {{of which they}} are presently or formerly members. This approach raises important questions about the positionality of the researcher, and the reflexivity, epistemology and ethics of an ethnographic investigation, as different roles and engagement with the field, as well as the very identity of the 'field' itself, no longer fit into the methodological framework of traditional ethnography. This article explores the difficulties that arise during ethnographic research on one's own social world. I was actively involved in the Russian punk scene before <b>pursuing</b> <b>my</b> academic <b>career</b> <b>in</b> England, and in the framework of a research project on post-socialist punk at the University of Warwick, I went back to study this milieu as a 'field' in two different sites in 2009 and in 2010. The article shows the complexity of researching one's own subculture and demonstrates that active discentring of the 'knowing authority' in studying one's own 'tribe' necessarily involves a transformation of its main research paradigms, where epistemological and ethical issues appear to be rearranged in a new way which radically affects the methodological foundations of such an investigation...|$|R
40|$|In 2011 when I {{was given}} the {{opportunity}} of taking a research leave to explore a topic of my choice, I immediately thought {{of the changes in}} which we find information today both in our work and home lives. This was a natural reaction for me because ever since I had initiated my studies of librarianship and information science, I had been most interested in technology and its impact on libraries. This started with Professor Susan Artandi at Rutgers when I first learned of systems analysis and library automation and reached greater fruition under Professor Leon Montgomery 2 ̆ 7 s instruction on programming languages—learning PIL (Pitt Interpretitive Language) and FORTRAN—and their use in automating library procedures. It continued and gained greater steam as I <b>pursued</b> <b>my</b> <b>career</b> <b>in</b> administering first college and then research libraries. <b>In</b> <b>my</b> administrative <b>career</b> I always tried to either be a pioneer in services enhanced by technology or be close to the curve. This was true when I initiated online database searching {{in the early days of}} DIALOG and also became an early adopter of OCLC integrated online services. At Western Kentucky University where I spent the majority of my library leadership experience, it was a priority that we serve as early adopters of technology that showed the potential of enhancing our services in some considerable way. I was fortunate to have a strong and willing faculty and staff corps to lead. As a result, we launched several firsts, including the first web site in Kentucky and also the first digital institutional repository (TopSCHOLAR). Nationally we also distinguished ourselves as we developed one of the first homegrown information portals, and, as mobile technology took fruit, one of the first library mobile sites. With the availability of iPhone apps, we released one of the first university library apps and also an iPad version of our library newsletter. And when social networking gained prominence, we were early Facebook adopters and Twitter tweeters. Hence I lived and breathed the development of technology and social media throughout <b>my</b> administrative <b>career.</b> During <b>my</b> research leave and for awhile afterward, I looked at the background behind these significant contemporary developments in an effort to better understand them both for myself, and for you, the reader. I hope you will benefit from reading this report as much as I did in researching and writing it. Changes in the topics continue to occur regularly and in this hyper-connected instantaneous world in which we live, are reported on almost every minute. I kid you not. Just follow the twitter commentaries of leading technological and social media gurus and you will understand what I mean, if your initial reaction is, really? To maintain the currency of my understanding of developments in the fields encompassed by the report, I will be posting entries in my soon-to-be launched blog, 2 ̆ 2 Library and Tech Trends Watcher. 2 ̆ 2 I hope you will take a look...|$|R
