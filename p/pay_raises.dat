5|$|On November 20, 1789, New Jersey {{ratified}} {{eleven of}} the twelve amendments, rejecting Article II, which regulated Congressional <b>pay</b> <b>raises.</b> On December 19 and 22, respectively, Maryland and North Carolina ratified all twelve amendments. On January 19, 25, and 28, 1790, respectively, South Carolina, New Hampshire, and Delaware ratified the Bill, though New Hampshire rejected the amendment on Congressional <b>pay</b> <b>raises,</b> and Delaware rejected Article I, which regulated {{the size of the}} House. This brought the total of ratifying states to six of the required ten, but the process stalled in other states: Connecticut and Georgia found a Bill of Rights unnecessary and so refused to ratify, while Massachusetts ratified most of the amendments, but failed to send official notice to the Secretary of State that it had done so.|$|E
5|$|Georgetown University student {{organizations}} {{include a}} {{diverse array of}} groups focused on social justice issues, including organizations run through both Student Affairs and the Center for Social Justice. Oriented against gender violence, Take Back the Night coordinates an annual rally and march to protest against rape {{and other forms of}} violence against women. Georgetown Solidarity Committee is a workers' rights organization whose successes include ending use of sweatshops in producing Georgetown-logoed apparel, and garnering <b>pay</b> <b>raises</b> for both university cleaning staff and police. Georgetown Students for Fair Trade successfully advocated for all coffee in campus cafeterias to be Fair Trade Certified.|$|E
5|$|In February through June 1790, New York, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island {{ratified}} {{eleven of}} the amendments, though all three rejected the amendment on Congressional <b>pay</b> <b>raises.</b> Virginia initially postponed its debate, but after Vermont {{was admitted to}} the Union in 1791, the total number of states needed for ratification rose to eleven. Vermont ratified on November 3, 1791, approving all twelve amendments, and Virginia finally followed on December 15, 1791. Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson announced the adoption of the ten successfully ratified amendments on March 1, 1792.|$|E

50|$|A {{major issue}} of {{contention}} {{in this election}} was the 2005 Pennsylvania General Assembly <b>pay</b> <b>raise</b> controversy. This bill would have seen state legislators receive {{a significant increase in}} salary. Representative Gerber voted against the <b>pay</b> <b>raise.</b> When the bill passed, Gerber refused to take the <b>pay</b> <b>raise</b> and sponsored legislation to repeal it. Ultimately, the bill was repealed.|$|R
5000|$|Title 37 U.S.C. 1009 {{provides}} a permanent formula for an automatic annual military <b>pay</b> <b>raise</b> that indexes the raise {{to the annual}} increase in the Employment Cost Index (ECI). The Fiscal Year 2010 President’s Budget request for a 2.9% military <b>pay</b> <b>raise</b> was consistent with this formula. However, Congress, in financial years 2004, 2005, 2006, 2008, and 2009 approved the <b>pay</b> <b>raise</b> as the ECI increase plus 0.5%. The 2007 <b>pay</b> <b>raise</b> was equal to the ECI.

5|$|Dio {{maintains}} that one purpose for Caracalla issuing the edict was {{the desire to}} increase state revenue; at the time, Rome was in a difficult financial situation and needed {{to pay for the}} new <b>pay</b> <b>raises</b> and benefits that were being conferred on the military. The edict widened the obligation for public service and gave increased revenue through the inheritance and emancipation taxes that only had to be paid by Roman citizens. The provincials also benefited from this edict because they were now able {{to think of themselves as}} equal partners to the Romans in the empire. However, few of those that gained citizenship were wealthy, and while it is true that Rome was in a difficult financial situation, it is thought that this could not have been the sole purpose of the edict.|$|E
5|$|During {{his reign}} as emperor, Caracalla raised the annual pay {{of an average}} legionary from 2000 sesterces (500 denarii) to 2700–3000 sesterces (675–750 denarii). He lavished many {{benefits}} on the army, which he both feared and admired, {{in accordance with the}} advice given by his father on his deathbed always to heed the welfare of the soldiers and ignore everyone else. Caracalla needed to gain and keep the trust of the military, and he did so with generous <b>pay</b> <b>raises</b> and popular gestures. He spent much of his time with the soldiers, so much so that he began to imitate their dress and adopt their manners.|$|E
5|$|The British also {{attacked}} Aguadilla and Punta Salinas. They {{were defeated}} by Colonel Conti {{and the members}} of the militia in Aguadilla, and the British troops that had landed on the island were taken prisoner. The British retreated on April 30 to their ships and on May 2 set sail northward. Because of the defeat given to the British forces, governor Ramon de Castro petitioned Spanish King Charles IV for recognition for the victors; he was promoted to Field Marshal and several others were promoted and given <b>pay</b> <b>raises.</b> The British persisted in invading Puerto Rico, after Abercromby's defeat, with unsuccessful skirmishes on the coastal towns of Aguadilla (December 1797), Ponce, Cabo Rojo, and Mayagüez. This continued to occur until 1802 when the war finally came to an end.|$|E
50|$|Rep. DeWeese {{supported}} a legislative and judicial <b>pay</b> <b>raise</b> in 2005. After {{criticism from the}} media and activist groups, DeWeese joined his colleagues in a near unanimous repeal of the <b>pay</b> <b>raise.</b>|$|R
25|$|On June 30, 2008, Jindal {{reversed}} {{his earlier}} position by vetoing the <b>pay</b> <b>raise</b> legislation, stating {{that he made}} a mistake by staying out of the <b>pay</b> <b>raise</b> issue. In response, the petitioners dropped their recall effort.|$|R
5000|$|The November 2006 General Election claimed {{several more}} members who {{supported}} the <b>pay</b> <b>raise</b> including Reps. Gene McGill, Mike Veon, Matt Wright, Tom Gannon and Matthew Good. The defeats were widely attributed to anger over the <b>pay</b> <b>raise.</b>|$|R
5|$|Although {{found to}} be {{reliable}} and accurate, the M249 was considered to present unacceptable hazards {{in the form of}} an exposed hot barrel and sharp edges. There were complaints that the front sight required special adjustment tools. On August 23, 1985, then-U.S. Under Secretary of the Army James R. Ambrose suspended M249 production pending the development of the product improvement program (PIP) intended to fix these problems. Congress deleted funds for the M249 from the Fiscal Year 1986 defense budget, then retroactively set aside the program's prior year's funds from the M249 program for other purposes, including retirement and <b>pay</b> <b>raises.</b> Over 1,100 M249s already issued were to remain in use, but be retrofitted with the PIP kit when it became available. Over 7,000 remaining M249s were to stay in storage at depots until corrective changes could be made. The PIP kit was eventually developed and implemented, and production of the M249 resumed. In 1994 the M249 squad automatic weapon was re-designated the M249 light machine gun.|$|E
5|$|Other {{business}} in the session included creating a special fund that would allow Jefferson to recover the USS Philadelphia, which had been captured {{off the coast of}} northern Africa, and the repeal of the Bankruptcy Act of 1800; Breckinridge supported the passage of both measures. He feared that passage of an act making permanent the <b>pay</b> <b>raises</b> for executive administrative personnel first enacted in 1799 would hurt his party in the upcoming elections, especially in the House, but the act passed and there was no significant backlash at the polls. Robert Wright's measure adjourning Congress to Baltimore, Maryland, in protest of legislators' poor accommodations in Washington, D.C., was defeated by a vote of 9–19, but Breckinridge considered the issue of moving the U.S. capital worthy of further study. Breckinridge supported the successful impeachment of federal judge John Pickering and also served on the Senate committee that prepared the rules governing the impeachment of Supreme Court Justice Samuel Chase. The latter impeachment was widely seen as politically motivated, and some Democratic-Republicans joined the Federalist minority in voting for acquittal. Majorities were obtained on only three of the eight articles of impeachment, and each of those fell at least three votes short of the required two-thirds majority. Breckinridge and three other Democratic-Republicans voted to convict on every article except the fifth, on which every senator sided with Chase.|$|E
25|$|At the 1979 Convention, Booth asked {{delegates to}} make 1980 a “test year” for negotiations. AUPE then {{took on the}} {{government}} with its “Apples & Oranges Campaign,” a reference to claim by government members that comparing 47-per-cent <b>pay</b> <b>raises</b> for MLAs with single-digit <b>pay</b> <b>raises</b> for public employees was like comparing apples and oranges.|$|E

25|$|The {{fiscal year}} 2006–07 general fund budget, {{approved}} by the Arizona Legislature in June 2006, is slightly less than $10billion.

25|$|Wages: There {{are four}} classes of stagehands. Head {{carpenters}} and electricians, {{who are in}} the top category, made about $1,600 a week. Most stagehands (riggers, winch-workers and operators) were in the lowest class, making about $1,200 a week. The union claimed that the proposed rule changes would cut workers salaries by 38 percent. The League offered different <b>pay</b> <b>raises</b> for different classes of workers, but the union argued these did not make up for the lost income.|$|E
25|$|Contract {{negotiations}} in 1985 were particularly contentious. PEF was especially critical {{of a state}} proposal to restructure the state employee health insurance program. Mediators had to be called in to help settle the contract. PEF settled for 5 percent <b>pay</b> <b>raises</b> {{in each of the}} contract's three years and an accidental-death benefit. Hoke failed to win re-election in 1985 due to member dissatisfaction with 1985 contract. SCDU withdrew its support for Hoke and actively supported challenger Rand Condell.|$|E
