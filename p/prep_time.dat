40|$|Quantitative {{myocardial}} T 2 is {{a promising}} technique to assess myocardial inflammation and edema (1). Recent implementations have utilized T 2 -prepared (T 2 prep) SSFP sequences {{to acquire a}} multiple T 2 weighted images at different echo times, and generate T 2 maps based on a 2 -parameter (2 P-fit) model of T 2 decay (2, 3). Recently, a 3 -parameter fitting (3 P-fit) model was found superior to the conventional 2 P-fit model, as it compen-sates for T 1 relaxation effect, and results in more accu-rate T 2 measurements (4). In this work, we sought to characterize the 3 P-fit approach in terms of precision and reproducibility and to evaluate {{the influence of the}} number of employed T 2 <b>prep</b> echo <b>times</b> on these two metrics. Methods Monte-Carlo simulations (1000 repetitions) were per-formed to study the effect of increasing the number of T 2 prep images. Block equation was used to simulate the signal intensities of a presumed tissue of T 2 = 50 ms at different T 2 <b>prep</b> echo <b>times</b> and different SNR levels. T 2 was then estimated using a 2 - and 3 -parameter fitting model, and the precision was quantified for each model. Ten healthy subjects (27 ± 10 y/o, 5 m) were then imaged using a 1. 5 T Phillips scanner with a free-breathing ECG-triggered single shot T 2 prep bSSFP sequence (FOV = 320 × 320 mm 2, in-plane resolution = 2. 5 × 2. 5 mm 2, slice thickness = 8 mm, TR/TE = 2. 2 / 1. 1 ms, FA = 40 °, SENSE rate = 2, acquisition window = 140 ms, 14 T 2 <b>prep</b> echo <b>times</b> = 0, 25, 35,… 135, 145 ms). A 4 s rest period after each image to allow for full spin relaxation. Data were reconstructed using the 3 P-fit model.

For each subject, both sequences were repeated 5 times. Precision and repro-ducibility were compared using different subset of T 2 <b>prep</b> echo <b>times.</b> Based on these results, an optimized T 2 mapping sequence using 10 T 2 prep echoes and a 3 P-fit model is proposed and evaluated in-vivo in 10 healthy subjects (29 ± 17 y/o, 4 m).

60|$|It {{should be}} remembered, however, {{that there are}} two {{varieties}} of notes. The printed notes {{at the end of your}} Thucydides or Homer are distinctly useful when they aim at acting up to their true vocation, namely, the translating of difficult passages or words. Sometimes, however, the author will insist on airing his scholarship, and instead of translations he supplies parallel passages, which neither interest, elevate, nor amuse the reader. This, of course, is mere vanity. The author, sitting in his comfortable chair with something short within easy reach, recks nothing of the misery he is inflicting on hundreds of people who have done him no harm at all. He turns over the pages of his book of Familiar Quotations with brutal callousness, and for every tricky passage in the work which he is editing, finds and makes a note of three or four even trickier ones from other works. Who has not in his time been brought face to face with a word which defies translation? There are two courses open to you on such an occasion, to look the word up in the lexicon, or in the notes. You, of course, turn up the notes, and find: 'See line 80.' You look up line 80, hoping to see a translation, and there you are told that a rather similar construction occurs in Xenophades' Lyrics from a Padded Cell. On this, the craven of spirit will resort to the lexicon, but the man of mettle will close his book with an emphatic bang, and refuse to have anything more to do with it. Of a different sort are the notes which simply translate the difficulty and subside. These are a boon to the scholar. Without them it would be almost impossible to prepare one's work during school, and we should be reduced to the prosaic expedient of working in <b>prep.</b> <b>time.</b> What we want is the commentator who translates mensa as 'a table' without giving a page and a half of notes on the uses of the table in ancient Greece, with an excursus on the habit common in those times of retiring underneath it after dinner, and a list of the passages in Apollonius Rhodius where the word 'table' is mentioned.|$|E

40|$|There is {{no doubt}} that shaped beam systems have been well {{established}} in the mask write community since the introduction of the 130 nm technology node. Moreover, they are successfully advancing to conquer also the wafer direct write market. To be able to handle today and in the near future the tremendous data volumes with their characteristic complexity as well as to make use of such indispensable methods like PEC and Fogging corrections, new, sophisticated solutions are necessary to master the challenging 45 nm technology node. However, we are aware that the 45 nm node presents only an intermediate step, because, according to the international roadmap, we soon will be confronted with the hardware and software requirements of the next, the 32 nm technology node. In this context it becomes more and more important to consider potential showstoppers, in our case the data preparation process To investigate this complex subject a Linux cluster computer featuring 3. 6 GHz clock rat e CPUs, and a software package supporting distributed computing with a 64 Bit version and address units down to 0. 1 nm were used.
