Adams continued his successful senior year by recording 81 defensive tackles and five sacks.|$|E
5|$|Before 1937–38 he {{had scored}} 43 goals in four seasons, and full-backs began to mark him more tightly; {{because of this}} he decided to drop deeper to collect the ball and aim to play {{pinpoint}} crosses as opposed to going for glory himself. Though he would never again score more than six goals in a season, this made him more an effective team <b>player</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> greater threat to the opposition.|$|E

5|$|All in all, Auerbach coached nine {{championship}} teams {{directly and}} mentored 4 players—Russell, Sharman, Heinsohn and K.C. Jones—who {{would go on}} to win an additional 7 NBA championships as coaches (two each for Russell, Heinsohn and Jones, all with the Celtics, and one for Sharman with the Lakers). Ten players who played for Auerbach have been inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame—Macauley, Ramsey, Cousy, Sharman, Heinsohn, Russell, K. C. Jones, Havlicek, Sam Jones and Bailey Howell. Although Don Nelson played for Auerbach only during his last year as coach, his influence was profound: Nelson would later join Auerbach as one of the 10 Greatest Coaches in NBA history. Sharman and Heinsohn would become two of only four people to be inducted into the Hall of Fame as both a <b>player</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> coach. Few, if any, coaches can match Auerbach's record of wins and successful mentorship of his players.|$|E
5|$|Harvey {{was thus}} {{selected}} in the series against England, his last in international cricket. During the season, Harvey applied to the Australian Cricket Board for permission {{to work as a}} journalist while also playing cricket. The application was refused, but Harvey wrote some bitter criticism of England captain Ted Dexter {{at the end of the}} series. Following a complaint from the Marylebone Cricket Club, the ACB said that it deplored Harvey's comments. Beginning steadily with half-centuries in the first and third Tests, Harvey made his 21st and final century in the fourth Test at Adelaide. Scoring 154 in a drawn match at the venue where his international career began 15 seasons earlier, Harvey then returned to his adopted hometown of Sydney for his farewell match. With the series level at 1–1, the Ashes were still alive but the game turned into a dull draw and Harvey scored 22 and 28. He was bowled by David Allen in the final innings. In the two English innings, he held six catches to equal the world record, a reminder of his prowess as one of Australia's great all-round fielders. Harvey retired as Australia's most capped <b>player,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> tally of runs and centuries second only to Don Bradman.|$|E

5|$|Lehman {{played with}} the Millionaires until the 1925–26 season. During that time, Lehman {{and some of his}} {{teammates}} were involved in a humorous incident when going back to Canada after an exhibition game against the Montreal Wanderers in New York City. In New York, Lehman's wife bought numerous women's designer outfits, after being treated to a shopping spree by him. When going back to Canada, Lehman, on the advice of Cyclone Taylor, who was both a professional ice hockey <b>player</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> Canadian immigration officer, split up all outfits among his teammates to avoid paying additional taxes {{he would have had to}} pay if he had brought all the clothing by himself at once; this puzzled the Customs officers. In 1922–23, the Millionaires were renamed the Maroons, and joined the Western Canada Hockey League (WCHL). The WCHL was renamed to the Western Hockey League in 1925–26; however, the league disbanded at the conclusion of that season. While playing for the Millionaires, Lehman appeared in six Stanley Cup finals, losing every time, except in his first season, in 1914–15.|$|E
5|$|Robin Friday (27 July 1952– 22 December 1990) was an English footballer {{who played}} professionally as a forward for Reading and Cardiff City during {{a career that}} lasted {{four years in the}} mid-1970s. His on-field {{performances}} were regarded as excellent, and he won Reading's player of the year award in both of his full seasons there, as well as being the leading goal scorer. However, his habit of unsettling opponents through physical intimidation contributed to a heavily tarnished disciplinary record, and his personal life was one of heavy smoking, drinking, womanising and drug abuse. Despite his short career, he remains prominent in the memory of Reading and Cardiff supporters, both as a <b>player</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> personality. He has been voted Reading's best ever player three times.|$|E
