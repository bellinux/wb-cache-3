5|$|After {{four weeks}} of filming in Philadelphia, {{the cast and crew}} moved to Wildwood, New Jersey, which doubled for scenes set at the Atlantic City boardwalk. Filming then moved to San Francisco, California. The scene where Birdy and Al climb atop a {{refinery}} building was filmed on the rooftop of an abandoned gasworks in Hercules, California. The scene required Modine and Cage to hang {{off the edge of the}} roof secured by safety wires, while the sequence in which Birdy falls off the roof was <b>performed</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> stunt double.|$|E

5|$|Although most {{cells have}} other enzymes that can degrade RNA, {{either from the}} 3' or from the 5' end of the RNA, the exosome complex is {{essential}} for cell survival. When the expression of exosome proteins is artificially reduced or stopped, for example by RNA interference, growth stops and the cells eventually die. Both the core proteins of the exosome complex, {{as well as the}} two main associated proteins, are essential proteins. Bacteria do not have an exosome complex; however, similar functions are <b>performed</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> simpler complex that includes the protein PNPase, called the degradosome.|$|E
5|$|As {{the elder}} sibling, Durga cares for Apu with motherly affection, but spares no {{opportunity}} to tease him. Together, they share the simple joys of life: sitting quietly under a tree, viewing pictures in a travelling vendor's bioscope, running after the candy man who passes through the village, and watching a jatra (folk theatre) <b>performed</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> troupe of actors. Every evening they are delighted {{by the sound of}} a distant train's whistle. One day, they run away from home {{to catch a glimpse of}} the train, only to discover Indir lying dead on their return.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of McCreary's election, his wife Kate was the {{youngest}} first lady in the Commonwealth's history. Due to the near completion of an annex to the state capitol building by {{the time of}} McCreary's inauguration, he was able to move the official governor's office out of the governor's mansion, freeing his family from the intrusion of public business into their private quarters. McCreary's receipt of the executive journal and Great Seal of the Commonwealth from outgoing Governor Leslie in the mansion's office {{is believed to be the}} last official act <b>performed</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> governor there.|$|E

5|$|Bumblebees {{have been}} {{observed}} to partake in social learning. In a 2017 study involving Bombus terrestris, bees were taught to complete an unnatural task of moving large objects to obtain a reward. Bees that first observed another bee complete the task were significantly more successful in learning the task than bees that observed the same action <b>performed</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> magnet, indicating {{the importance of social}} information. The bees did not copy each other exactly: in fact, the study suggested that the bees were instead attempting to emulate each other's goals.|$|E
5|$|Dataflow {{programming}} languages describe {{systems of}} operations on data streams, and {{the connections between}} the outputs of some operations and the inputs of others. These languages can be convenient for describing repetitive data processing tasks, in which the same acyclically-connected collection of operations is applied to many data items. They can be executed as a parallel algorithm in which each operation is <b>performed</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> parallel process as soon as another set of inputs becomes available to it.|$|E
5|$|Directed by Peter Maris, {{the game}} {{features}} {{a cast of}} 25 actors, all performing {{in front of a}} blue screen. While most games at the time featured 80 to 100 backgrounds, Phantasmagoria includes more than 1,000. A professional Hollywood special effects house worked on the game, and the musical score includes a neo-Gregorian chant <b>performed</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> 135-voice choir. Sierra stressed it was intended for adult audiences. The company willingly submitted it to a ratings system, and included a password-protected censoring option within the game to tone down the graphic content.|$|E

5|$|The most {{widespread}} form of Lucian work song is the chanté siay, which {{accompanies the}} sawing of wood. The vocals are <b>performed</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> lead singer and two responding singers, {{accompanied by a}} ka and tibwa duo. Both instruments are played in an atypical manner. The ka drum is played on the ground rather than upright, and the tibwa percussion sticks are struck against a bamboo or wooden stick rather than the rim of a drum.|$|E

5|$|The {{villages of}} La Grace, Piaye and Laborie in the {{southwest}} area of Saint Lucia were known for a unique song-dance called the koutoumba. The koutoumba was only performed {{for the death of}} a djiné, a person descended from Africans who came to the island {{in the middle of the}} 19th century. The koutoumba is unique among Lucian folk dance in that it is <b>performed</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> sole dancer and using only two to four lines of text, which is evocative of the song's atmosphere rather than narrative. The last drummer who knew this tradition died in 1986.|$|E
5|$|Æthelnoth died in 1038, {{on either}} 28 October, 29 October, 30 October, or 1 November.

He is considered a saint, with a feast day of 30 October.

5|$|After {{entering}} the Indian Ocean, the convoy sailed south-east. The ships manoeuvred {{together in a}} zigzag course; avoiding collisions during the frequent turns placed heavy demands on the watch-keeping officers, who found their shifts exhausting. The troops endured very uncomfortable conditions on the hot and crowded ships, but morale was high. They entertained themselves with sports, sun baking and gambling, and those on Queen Mary could attend concerts <b>performed</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> regimental brass band. The 9th Division's officers enjoyed somewhat better conditions, which frustrated {{some of the other}} ranks. The 9th Division's preparations for jungle warfare continued during the voyage, with all personnel attending daily lectures delivered by officers on the lessons learnt during the previous fighting in the Pacific.|$|E
