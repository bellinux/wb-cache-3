5|$|The federal {{government}} and the states have long been permitted to limit obscenity or pornography. While the Supreme Court has generally refused to give obscenity any protection under the First Amendment, <b>pornography</b> <b>is</b> subject to little regulation. However, the definitions of obscenity and pornography have changed over time.|$|E
5|$|The band, Smith in particular, {{wanted to}} make the album with a {{different}} producer than Mike Hedges, who had produced Seventeen Seconds and Faith. The group settled on Phil Thornalley. <b>Pornography</b> <b>is</b> the last Cure album to feature founding band member Lol Tolhurst as the band's drummer (he then became the band's keyboardist), and also marked the first time he played keyboards on a Cure release. The album was recorded at RAK Studios from January to April 1982.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, <b>pornography</b> <b>is</b> {{considered}} {{a form of}} personal expression, and thus governed by the First Amendment to the Constitution. <b>Pornography</b> <b>is</b> generally protected speech, unless it is obscene, as the Supreme Court of the United States held in 1973 in Miller v. California.|$|E

25|$|Child <b>{{pornography}}</b> <b>is</b> pornography that exploits {{children for}} sexual stimulation. Child pornography may {{use a variety}} of media, including writings, magazines, photos, sculpture, drawing, cartoon, painting, animation, sound recording, film, video, and video games.|$|E
25|$|As stated above, much of Concerned Women for America's {{concern with}} <b>pornography</b> <b>is</b> {{a result of}} their {{familial}} ideals. The CWA sees a problem with men becoming addicted to pornography and women being unable to compete with the ideal woman in pornography.|$|E
25|$|The {{church has}} always been against the creation, {{distribution}} and viewing of pornography. Gordon B. Hinckley had been known to say that <b>pornography</b> <b>is</b> as addictive as the worst drugs. He often talked of what a shame it is to use such great resources (such as the internet) for such material.|$|E

5000|$|Two 2016 {{neurology}} reviews {{found evidence}} of addiction related brain changes in internet pornography users. Psychological effects of these brain changes are described as desensitization to reward, a dysfunctional anxiety response, and impulsiveness. Another 2016 review suggests that internet behaviors, {{including the use of}} <b>pornography,</b> <b>be</b> considered potentially addictive, and that problematic use of online <b>pornography</b> <b>be</b> considered an [...] "internet-use disorder".|$|R
25|$|In 1976, Dershowitz {{handled the}} {{successful}} appeal of Harry Reems, {{who had been}} convicted of distribution of obscenity resulting from his acting in the pornographic movie Deep Throat. In public debates, Dershowitz commonly argues against censorship of pornography on First Amendment grounds, and maintains that consumption of <b>pornography</b> <b>is</b> not harmful.|$|E
25|$|Consumption {{of child}} <b>pornography</b> <b>is</b> a more {{reliable}} indicator of pedophilia than molesting a child, although some non-pedophiles also view child pornography. Child pornography {{may be used}} for a variety of purposes, ranging from private sexual gratification or trading with other collectors, to preparing children for sexual abuse as part of the child grooming process.|$|E
25|$|Virtual child <b>pornography</b> <b>is</b> punished {{with up to}} a {{third of}} the {{sanctions}} for real-life child pornography. Virtual images include images, or parts of images, produced and modified with software from actual photos of minors, where the quality makes it so that fake situations are manipulated to appear realistic. Therefore, lolicon, shotacon, and cartoon pornography in general are not included.|$|E

50|$|The effects {{produced}} {{by those who}} view <b>pornography</b> <b>are</b> mixed and still widely debated. Generally, research has been focused around the effects of voluntary viewing of pornography. There have also been studies analyzing the inadvertent exposure to explicit sexual content, including: viewing naked photographs of people, people engaging in sexual acts, accidental web searches, or opening online links to pornographic material. It {{has been found that}} most exposure to <b>pornography</b> online <b>is</b> unsolicited and by accident. 42% of those who view online <b>pornography</b> <b>are</b> ages ranging between 10 and 17; 66% have experienced inadvertent exposure.|$|R
25|$|When child <b>pornography</b> <b>is</b> {{distributed}} across international borders, customs agencies also {{participate in}} investigations and enforcement, {{such as in}} the 2001–2002 cooperative effort between the United States Customs Service and local operational law enforcement agencies in Russia. A search warrant issued in the USA by the Customs Service resulted in seizing of computers and email records by the Russian authorities, and arrests of the pornographers.|$|E
25|$|ICE {{has played}} a key role in {{investigating}} and arresting citizens suspected of possessing and distributing child pornography. Because the vast majority of child <b>pornography</b> <b>is</b> produced outside the United States, HSI special agents utilize their authority to investigate persons and groups that traffic in this type of contraband, the importation of which via traditional mail or internet channels constitute violations of customs laws.|$|E
25|$|Opponents of COPA {{argued that}} child <b>pornography</b> <b>is</b> already illegal, and COPA {{would not be}} {{effective}} because it would waste too much time going after individual sites within the US which could simply set up shop overseas if shut down. It was also argued that COPA would infringe upon rights of adults to receive non-pornographic/harmful messages, and that COPA was not the least invasive or {{most efficient way to}} protect children from harmful online content.|$|E

25|$|Child <b>pornography</b> <b>is</b> {{illegal and}} censored in most jurisdictions in the world. Ninety-four of 187 Interpol member states had laws {{specifically}} addressing child pornography as of 2008, though {{this does not}} include nations that ban all pornography. Of those 94 countries, 58 criminalized possession of child pornography regardless of intent to distribute. Both distribution and possession are now criminal offenses in almost all Western countries. A wide movement is working to globalize the criminalization of child pornography, including major international organizations such as the United Nations and the European Commission.|$|E
25|$|In Japan, animal <b>pornography</b> <b>is</b> used {{to bypass}} {{censorship}} laws, often featuring Japanese and Swedish female models performing fellatio on animals, because oral penetration of a non-human penis {{is not in}} the scope of Japanese mosaic censor. Sakura Sakurada is an AV idol known to have appeared in animal pornography, specifically in the AV The Dog Game in 2006. While primarily underground, {{there are a number of}} animal pornography actresses who specialize in bestiality movies. A box-office success of the 1980s, 24 Horas de Sexo Explícito featured zoophilia.|$|E
25|$|The {{costs of}} spam {{also include the}} {{collateral}} costs of the struggle between spammers and the administrators and users of the media threatened by spamming. Many users are bothered by spam because it impinges upon {{the amount of time}} they spend reading their email. Many also find the content of spam frequently offensive, in that <b>pornography</b> <b>is</b> one of the most frequently advertised products. Spammers send their spam largely indiscriminately, so pornographic ads may show up in a work place email inbox—or a child's, the latter of which is illegal in many jurisdictions. Recently, there has been a noticeable increase in spam advertising websites that contain child pornography.|$|E

50|$|<b>Pornography</b> <b>was</b> {{banned in}} Germany in February 1933 by Adolf Hitler. The ban was then lifted {{few years after}} World War II.|$|R
25|$|Censorship is more notable in the media. Songs {{and theater}} play in Japanese {{language}} or relating to Japan are generally prohibited. Despite {{the lifting of}} most regulations in 1996 and 1998 following a Constitutional Court ruling that they were illegal, scenes of extreme violence can be barred and <b>pornography</b> <b>is</b> forbidden from showing penetration of any kind, and genitals must be blurred out. Though technically legal, pornography must still meet some minimum standards of artistic integrity, which are not clearly written in the law. In 1997 a human rights film festival was blocked and the organizers arrested for refusing to submit their films for pre-screening. The government blocks access to North Korean websites and, sometimes, to major overseas web sites that host blogs. There is currently a debate over whether to revoke {{the ability to make}} anonymous comments online.|$|E
25|$|The Protect Act §503 of 1992 (codified at 18 U.S.C. §2251 to 18 U.S.C. §2260) {{makes it}} a federal crime to possess or create sexually {{explicit}} images of any person under 18 years of age; this creates a federal age of consent of 18 for pornography. Thus, while some conduct covered by the statute is highly culpable, these penalties apply even when consensual sex between someone {{under the age of}} eighteen and someone over the age of eighteen is entirely legal under state law, the non-commercial possession of an explicit picture or video clip of the person under the age of eighteen (such as a cell phone photograph of a naked sexual partner, under the age of eighteen, of the person taking the photo) may still constitute a serious federal child pornography felony. The sentence for a first time offender convicted of producing child pornography under 18 U.S.C. §2251 (such as taking a suggestive cell phone picture of an otherwise legal sexual partner under the age of eighteen without an intent to share or sell the picture), face fines and a statutory minimum of 15 years to 30 years maximum in prison. While mandatory minimum offenses do not apply to mere possession of child pornography, it is almost always the case that a person in possession of child <b>pornography</b> <b>is</b> also necessarily guilty of either receipt of child pornography, which carries a five-year mandatory minimum sentence, or production of child pornography, which carries a fifteen-year mandatory minimum sentence.|$|E
500|$|Instead {{she offered}} five {{recommendations}} for the Commission, recommending (1) that [...] "the Justice Department instruct law-enforcement agencies to keep records {{of the use of}} pornography in violent crimes", (2) a ban on the possession and distribution of pornography in prisons, (3) that prosecutors [...] "enforce laws against pimping and pandering against pornographers", (4) that the administration [...] "make it a Justice Department priority to enforce RICO (the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act) against the pornography industry", and (5) that Congress adopt federal anti-pornography civil rights legislation which would provide for civil damages for harm inflicted on women. She suggested that the Commission consider [...] "creating a criminal conspiracy provision under the civil rights law, such that conspiring to deprive a person of their civil rights by coercing them into <b>pornography</b> <b>is</b> a crime, and that conspiring to traffic in <b>pornography</b> <b>is</b> conspiring to deprive women of our civil rights". Dworkin compared her proposal to the Southern Poverty Law Center's use of civil rights litigation against the Ku Klux Klan.|$|E
40|$|Frequent use of <b>pornography</b> has not <b>been</b> {{sufficiently}} studied before. In a Swedish survey 2015 {{male students}} aged 18 years participated. A group of frequent users of pornography (N = 200, 10. 5 %) were studied {{with respect to}} background and psychosocial correlates. The frequent users had a more positive attitude to <b>pornography,</b> <b>were</b> more often “turned on” viewing pornography and viewed more often advanced forms of <b>pornography.</b> Frequent use <b>was</b> also associated with many problem behaviours. A multiple logistic regression analysis showed that frequent users of <b>pornography</b> <b>were</b> {{more likely to be}} living in a large city, consuming alcohol more often, having greater sexual desire and had more often sold sex than other boys of the same age. High frequent viewing of <b>pornography</b> may <b>be</b> seen as a problematic behaviour that needs more attention from both parents and teachers and also to be addressed in clinical interviews...|$|R
