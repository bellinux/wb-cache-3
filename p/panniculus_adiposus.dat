50|$|Panniculitis is a {{group of}} {{diseases}} whose hallmark is inflammation of subcutaneous adipose tissue (the fatty layer under the skin - <b>panniculus</b> <b>adiposus).</b> Symptoms include tender skin nodules, and systemic signs such as weight loss and fatigue.|$|E
5000|$|The {{bulk of the}} gluteal {{muscle mass}} {{contributes}} only partially to shape of the buttocks. The other major contributing factor {{is that of the}} <b>panniculus</b> <b>adiposus</b> of the buttocks, which is very well developed in this area, and gives the buttock its characteristic rounded shape. Although the gluteal muscle bulk and tone can be improved with exercise, it is the disposition of the overlying <b>panniculus</b> <b>adiposus</b> which may be responsible for the [...] "sagging butt" [...] phenomenon. Exercise in general (not only of the gluteal muscles but of the body in general) which can contribute to fat loss can lead to reduction of mass in subcutaneal fat storage locations on the body which includes the panniculus, so for leaner and more active individuals, the glutes will more predominantly contribute to the shape than someone less active with a fattier composition. The degree of body fat stored in various locations such as the panniculus is dictated by genetic and hormonal profiles.|$|E

It is a layer of striated muscle deep to the <b>panniculus</b> <b>adiposus.</b> In humans the platysma muscle of the neck, palmaris brevis in the hand, and the dartos muscle in the scrotum are described as a discrete muscle of the panniculus carnosus. Some of the muscles of facial expression in the head are part of the panniculus carnosus. In other parts of the body, the layer is vestigial, and may be absent or may exist only as microscopic, disconnected fibers.|$|E

Calcific uraemic arteriolopathy (CUA), or calciphylaxis, is a life-threatening calcification of arterioles leading to necrotic infarcts of the skin and subcutaneous tissue (<b>panniculus</b> <b>adiposus)</b> with a high potential to progress to bacterial sepsis and death.

40|$|Classically, {{calciphylaxis}} (calcific uraemic arteriolopathy – CUA) {{has been}} considered a disease of patients with advanced or end-stage renal disease. However, calciphylaxis in patients without an incriminating history or renal function is not as rare as previously believed; thus patients may present to dermatology after referral from primary care. Calciphylaxis involves life-threatening calcification of arterioles leading to necrotic infarcts of the skin and subcutaneous tissue (<b>panniculus</b> <b>adiposus),</b> erythema and livedo reticularis, followed by painful, pre-ulcerative, subcutaneous plaques with surrounding pruritic areas. These areas ulcerate revealing regions of necrotic subcutaneous adipose tissue covered by eschars with high potential for infectious complication.

40|$|A patient {{suffering}} from Weber-Christian panniculitis {{was found at}} necropsy to have similar lesions in the visceral adipose tissue. When the lesions occur internally, diagnosis during life {{is complicated by the}} difficulty of examining visceral adipose tissue and the disease may often go unrecognized, but patients {{suffering from}} Weber-Christian panniculitis should be investigated bearing in mind the possibility of internal lesions. Only 11 cases confirmed by necropsy appear to have been reported hitherto. The aetiology remains obscure. It is suggested that the name `systemic Weber-Christian disease' be applied when the lesions occur in adipose tissue other than the <b>panniculus</b> <b>adiposus</b> and that the term `Weber-Christian panniculitis' be used when the lesions are confined to the subcutaneous adipose tissue...|$|E
40|$|Wound healing, {{angiogenesis}} {{and hair}} follicle maintenance are often impaired {{in the skin}} of diabetic patients, but the pathogenesis has not been well understood. Here, we report that circulation levels of kallistatin, {{a member of the}} serine proteinase inhibitor (SERPIN) superfamily with anti-angiogenic activities, were elevated in Type 2 diabetic patients with diabetic vascular complications. To test the hypothesis that elevated kallistatin levels could contribute to a wound healing deficiency via inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, we generated kallistatin-transgenic (KS-TG) mice. KS-TG mice had reduced cutaneous hair follicle density, microvascular density, and <b>panniculus</b> <b>adiposus</b> layer thickness as well as altered skin microvascular hemodynamics and delayed cutaneous wound healing. Using Wnt reporter mice, our results showed that Wnt/β-catenin signaling is suppressed in dermal endothelium and hair follicles in KS-TG mice. Lithium, a known activator of β-catenin via inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase- 3 β, reversed the inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling by kallistatin and rescued the wound healing deficiency in KS-TG mice. These observations suggest that elevated circulating anti-angiogenic serpins in diabetic patients may contribute to impaired wound healing through inhibition of Wnt/β-cateni...|$|E
40|$|Immunologic {{mechanisms}} {{involved in}} homograft rejection and tuberculin sensitivity {{have been suggested}} to be similar modalities of delayed sensitivity (1). Cogent evidence for this proposed similarity has been the consistent finding of the essentiality of the lymphoid cell in the passive transfer of both of these reactions (2). In tuberculin sensitivity, significant numbers of sensitized lymphoid cells {{have been shown to}} accumulate {{at the site of the}} tuberculin skin test following passive intravenous transfer of labeled sensitized ceils. Sensitized lymphoid cells did not accumulate at the injection site of non-specific antigen nor were non-sensitized cells attracted to the site of PPD application (3). In addition, BCG-sensitized cells enclosed in millipore chambers were found to be ineffective in the transfer of tuberculin sensitivity (4). This study was designed to examine the skin homograft site after cells, labeled with tritiated thymidine and sensitized to the homologous skin donor, were passively transferred to homografted isologons hosts. With this technique, the number, types, and distribution of sensitized cells could be ascertained in the rejection site. In addition, the ability of sensitized cells to destroy a homograft at a distance was studied by transferring transplantation immunity with sensitized qells enclosed in millipore chambers impermeable to the passage of cells. I. Tritiated Lymphoid Cells. [...] Materials and Methods Two inbred strains of mice, A and CBA, l were used throughout the study. All skin grafts were prepared as full thickness grafts.

40|$|A Tateishi Denki-made, 13. 56 MHz, {{induction}} heater, Model HEH- 500 C {{was used}} to study heating characteristics, and histologic retrieval of heated organs, and to clarify the following matters. Heating characteristics : Two mini-pigs, weighing 43 kg and 30 kg, respectively, were subjected to five patterns of heating. The results of heating experiment are summarized as follows. 1) Without the large -sized cooling bolus, both abdomen and groin were easily heated to the temperatures higher than 43 °C. 2) With the large-sized cooling bolus, the deeper regions of both abdomen and groin were difficult to be heated to the temperatures higher than 42 °C. 3) The large-sized cooling bolus prevents heating of body surface and <b>panniculus</b> <b>adiposus,</b> but deteriorates heating of the deeper regions. The large-sized cooling bolus should be used after weighing the merits and demerits, and setting the conditions carefully. 4) The small intestines and stomach are easily heated to higher temperatures, but the liver and pancreas are difficult to be effectively heated. Histologic changes : The histologic retrieval {{was made of the}} organs of the two mini-pigs subjected to the heating experiment. The examined organs included the stomach, small intestines, dorsal muscles, adipose tissues, liver, and spleen. Findings after heating showed without exceptions the three items : edema and hyperemia, bleeding, and necrosis. The relationship between the temperatures and the histologic changes were clarified in each organ studied. The histologic changes were most remarkable in the small intestines, then fairly noticeable in the stomach, muscles and adipose tissues, and least remarkable in the liver and spleen. The heating characteristics of 13. 56 MHz induction heater, Model HEH- 500 C and the results of histologic retrieval present the important, basic data for consideration of indications and features of clinical application. rights:日本ハイパーサーミア学会rights:本文データは学協会の許諾に基づきJournal archiveから複製したものであるrelation: isVersionOf: [URL]...|$|E
