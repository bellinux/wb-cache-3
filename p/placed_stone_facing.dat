60|$|Everything was {{happening}} rapidly now. Across {{the street and}} half a block down, high up in a building, I could see heads peering out. I had just pointed them out to Hartman, when a sheet of flame and smoke ran along {{that portion of the}} face of the building where the heads had appeared, and the air was shaken by the explosion. In <b>places</b> the <b>stone</b> <b>facing</b> of the building was torn away, exposing the iron construction beneath. The next moment similar sheets of flame and smoke smote the front of the building across the street opposite it. Between the explosions we could hear the rattle of the automatic pistols and rifles. For several minutes this mid-air battle continued, then died out. It was patent that our comrades were in one building, that Mercenaries were in the other, and that they were fighting across the street. But we could not tell which was which--which building contained our comrades and which the Mercenaries.|$|R

50|$|The Unity Burial Ground {{is a small}} {{graveyard}} {{located on}} the southeast end of White Plain in the Nichols section of Trumbull, Connecticut. It is located a few rods north of {{the site of the}} first meeting house that was built in the parish of Unity, off of White Plains Road. The cemetery was laid out in 1730 and the first burial was that of 7 year old Samuel Bennitt on June 21, 1731. There are over 110 gravestones, 90 unmarked field stones and 241 known grave sites, and most of the original <b>stones</b> <b>face</b> east. This is unusual, as it runs contrary to the common practice of <b>placing</b> <b>stones</b> so that they face the road. The latest known burial was for Charles E Booth Jr. on August 17, 1935.|$|R
