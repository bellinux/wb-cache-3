50|$|In 1892, Achnashellach was {{the scene}} of a runaway train in which the brake in the brakevan had malfunctioned. Subsequently, this train moved off down the slope at {{considerable}} speed without a locomotive to keep it under control. Reaching the bottom of the slope, it had enough energy to proceed back uphill, before running down the slope once again. Unfortunately, another train was approaching Achnashellach in the opposite direction at that very moment, and the two trains collided {{at the bottom of the}} slope with great force, resulting in several injuries in what was a rare accident for the Highland Railway. The cause of the accident was thought to be a result of the HR's lack of using a continuous brake, and a habit of <b>putting</b> <b>goods</b> wagons at the front of mixed passenger and goods trains.|$|E
5000|$|Palda {{summarizes}} {{the importance of}} Nordhaus' insight as follows: [...] "The practical lesson {{to be drawn from}} this fascinating study of lighting is that the way we measure the consumer price index is severely flawed. Instead of <b>putting</b> <b>goods</b> and their prices directly into the index we should reduce all goods to their constituent characteristics. Then we should evaluate how these goods can best be combined to minimize the cost of consuming these characteristics. Such an approach would allow us to include new goods in the consumer price index without worrying about whether the index of today is comparable to that of ten years ago when the good did not exist. Such an approach would also allow governments to more precisely calculate the rate at which welfare and other forms of aid should be increased. At present such calculations tend to overestimate the cost of living because they do {{not take into account the}} manner in which increases in quality reduce the monetary cost of maintaining a certain standard of living." ...|$|E
40|$|This paper takes Bao Steel {{logistics}} automated warehouse {{system as}} an example. The premise {{is to maintain}} {{the focus of the}} shelf below half of the height of the shelf. As a result, the cost time of getting or <b>putting</b> <b>goods</b> on the shelf is reduced, and the distance of the same kind of goods is also reduced. Construct a multiobjective optimization model, using genetic algorithm to optimize problem. At last, we get a local optimal solution. Before optimization, the average cost time of getting or <b>putting</b> <b>goods</b> is 4. 52996 [*]s, and the average distance of the same kinds of goods is 2. 35318 [*]m. After optimization, the average cost time is 4. 28859 [*]s, and the average distance is 1. 97366 [*]m. After analysis, we can draw the conclusion that this model can improve the efficiency of cargo storage...|$|E
