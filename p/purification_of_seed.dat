40|$|Eight saporin peaks were {{obtained}} from the <b>purification</b> <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> extracts of Saponaria officinalis L. Saporin peak No. 6 (SAP- 6) showed the highest activity in the inhibition of protein synthesis (98 %) in an in vitro translation study. An immunotoxin (IT) was prepared from SAP- 6 conjugated to a monoclonal anti-CEA antibody 26 / 5 / 1 (mab B) using N-succinimidyl pyridyl dithiopropionate (SPDP) and 2 -iminothiolane as a cross linker. Under thermal stability study by a DSC (differential scanning calorimetry), the IT showed a denature temperature of 75 degrees C. In in vitro translation studies, the purified IT showed the same activity as SAP- 6 at 10 (- 7) M and 10 (- 9) M protein concentration at 0, 30 and 60 -min incubation effects with mab B and SAP- 6 not conjugated at 24 -hr incubation periods on human promyelocytic cell line HL 60 and on human colon adenocarcinoma cell lines which were SW 403, LoVo and LS 174 T. SAP- 6, mab B and IT had no cytotoxic effect on HL- 60. The IT showed a higher cytotoxic effect than SAP- 6 in CEA-positive cell lines. The IT demonstrated the highest cytotoxic effect of 51 % inhibition of control at 10 (- 7) M on the LS 174 T...|$|E

40|$|The {{contamination}} of 11 commercial grape seed oils with paraffins of mineral oil origin was analyzed by online-coupled HPLC-HPLC-GC-FID and ranged from 43 to 247 mg kg- 1. The {{analysis of the}} marc and seeds indicated that the contamination is primarily from the peels. Since superficial extraction <b>of</b> the <b>seeds</b> with hexane removed most of the mineral paraffins, the contamination <b>of</b> the <b>seeds</b> is largely on the surface, perhaps transferred from the peels during storage of the marc. Mechanical <b>purification</b> <b>of</b> the <b>seeds</b> combined with washing with hexane reduced the {{contamination of}} the oil {{by a factor of}} about 10.

40|$|Amino acid conjugates of IAA can be chromatographed on {{polyvinylpolypyrrolidone}} (PVPP) {{using either}} acidic methanol or aqueous buffers as eluents. In the aqueous system, elution of the compounds is pH-dependent, and the pattern obtained suggests that hydrophobic interactions contribute substantially to the chromatographic behavior of IAA peptides on PVPP. <b>Purification</b> <b>of</b> soybean <b>seed</b> extracts by PVPP chromatography produced fractions containing indole- 3 -acetylaspartate and indole- 3 -acetylglutamate, based on chromatographic and mass spectral analysis, {{as well as}} three other indolic compounds, tentatively identified as N-acyl tryptophan derivatives.

40|$|Passion {{fruit seeds}} must be clean and dry before the {{extraction}} processing to obtain high-quality oil for edible and cosmetic purposes. This research studies {{the viability of}} a cleaning process <b>of</b> <b>seeds</b> by evaluating the oil quality. The research examined 2 maturation stages of the fruit and one <b>purification</b> process <b>of</b> the <b>seeds,</b> compared to the control. The oil quality was evaluated by fatty acid composition, acidity, peroxide value and oxidative stability. The pulp waste suffered a thermal treatment in an alkaline water solution at 60 &# 176;C for 10 min and was further purified in an experimental decanter. In the control treatment, the pulp waste was processed using only water at ambient conditions. The passion fruit seeds were totally cleaned by the thermal/chemical treatment, allowing a faster drying (less than 50 % of the drying time) <b>of</b> the <b>seeds</b> and a bit higher yield of oil extraction (proportionally around 7. 7 %), without changes in quality of the oi...|$|R
40|$|Kupeelu (Strychnos nux-vomica Linn.) {{commonly}} known as nux vomica is a poisonous plant used extensively in various ayurvedic formulations, with great therapeutic significance. Ayurveda recommended the administration of Kupeelu only after purification in different media like cow's urine (Go mutra), cow's milk (Go dugdha), cow's ghee (Go ghrita), Kanji (sour gruel), and so on. Apart from the classical methods some other methods are also adopted by the traditional practitioners using castor oil (Eranda taila), ginger juice (Ardraka swarasa), in the <b>purification</b> <b>of</b> Kupeelu <b>seeds.</b> In the present study an attempt {{has been made to}} purify the seeds by performing two different methods (one classical and another traditional) using Kanji and Ardraka swarasa as Shodhana media. This study reveals that both the methods studied reduce the strychnine and brucine contents in comparison to the raw seeds as determined by high performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC). After purification in Kanji and Ardraka swarasa, the strychnine content was reduced by 39. 25 % and 67. 82 %, respectively, and the brucine content in the purified seeds was also found to have decreased by 17. 60 % and 40. 06 %, in comparison to the raw seeds...|$|R

40|$|Pea fruit (Pisum sativum L.) is a {{model system}} for {{studying}} the effect <b>of</b> <b>seeds</b> on fruit growth {{in order to understand}} coordination of organ development. The metabolism of 14 C-labeled gibberellin A 12 (GA 12) by pea pericarp was followed using a method that allows access to the seeds while maintaining pericarp growth in situ. Identification and quantitation of GAs in pea pericarp was accomplished by combined gas chromatography-mass spectrometry following extensive <b>purification</b> <b>of</b> the putative GAs. Here we report {{for the first time that}} the metabolism of [14 C]GA 12 to [14 C]GA 19 and [14 C]GA 20 occurs in pericarp <b>of</b> <b>seeded</b> pea fruit. Removal <b>of</b> <b>seeds</b> from the pericarp inhibited the conversion of radiolabeled GA 19 to GA 20 and caused the accumulation of radiolabeled and endogenous GA 19. Deseeded pericarp contained no detectable GA 20, GA 1, or GA 8, whereas pericarp with seeds contained endogenous and radiolabeled GA 20 and endogenous GA 1. These data strongly suggest that seeds are required for normal GA biosynthesis in the pericarp, specifically the conversion of GA 19 to GA 20...|$|R

The technique uses a "universal " affinity column for lectins and their conjugates, which consists of hog sulfated gastric mucin glycopeptides covalently coupled to agarose. The procedure involves: (a) <b>purification</b> <b>of</b> lectins by chromatography of aqueous extracts <b>of</b> <b>seeds</b> or other lectin-containing fluids over the affinity column, followed by desorption of the desired lectin with its hapten sugar; (b) iodination of the lectin to serve as a marker during subsequent steps; (c) conjugation of lectin to ferritin with glutaraldehyde; (d) collection of active lectin-ferritin conjugates by affinity chromatography; and (e) separation of monomeric lectin-ferritin conjugates from larger aggregates and unconjugated lectin by gel chromatography. Based on radioactivity and absorbancy at 310 nm for lectin and ferritin, respectively, the conjugates consist of one to two molecule...|$|R
