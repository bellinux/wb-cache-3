5000|$|The {{prisoners of}} Alcatraz were {{permitted}} to play games such as baseball, softball and other sports at these times, and intellectual games such as chess. Basketball also {{appears to have been}} <b>played</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> judging by <b>the</b> markings which are still visible <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> today. Baseball and softball were the most popular. Because of the small size of <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> and <b>the</b> diamond at the end of it, a section of the wall behind the first base had to be padded to cushion the impact of inmates overrunning it. Inmates were provided gloves, bats, and balls, but no sport uniforms. In 1938, there were four amateur teams, the Bees, Oaks, Oilers, and Seals, named after Minor League clubs, and four league teams named after Major League clubs, the Cardinals, Cubs, Giants, and Tigers. Bank robber and kidnapper Volney Davis was a pitching ace for the Oilers, while Lorenzo Murrietta, doing 40 years for assault and robbery, was the best batter in Alcatraz league play. He had a [...]402 batting average, with 9 home runs and 45 RBIs for the Cardinals.Although many of the inmates relished the opportunity to exercise on weekends, violence occasionally occurred, often race related. A notable riot occurred on May 20, 1956 over racial taunts <b>on</b> <b>the</b> diamond between a white and black prisoner during a softball match. Many of the inmates used weekends in <b>the</b> <b>yards</b> to converse with each other and discuss crime, the only real opportunities they had during the week for active conversation. Machine Gun Kelly and Basil [...] "The Owl" [...] Banghart were said to be inseparable in <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> and would spend their whole time walking around it in conversation together. Al Capone, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other hand, avoided <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> in his later years in the penitentiary as his mind deteriorated. Edwin B. Swope, Warden of Alcatraz from 1948 to 1955, once said, in response to an inmate who complained to him <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> about his term of 199 years, which was really a life sentence, [...] "My boy, we're all doing life. Every one of us is doing life." ...|$|R
50|$|There {{were several}} more tragedies at the brickyard, the first being in 1906, when an 18-year-old worker was killed, whilst trying {{to repair a}} loose board. His clothes became {{entangled}} in an overhead revolving shaft, which was spinning at 100 revolutions a minute. Having been dragged around by the machine, he was rushed to hospital, but sadly died of multiple injuries. In the inquest, no blame {{was attached to the}} company, although the worker's father was awarded £40 compensation for the loss of his son. In 1908, a six-year-old boy was killed on Gunville Lane, while <b>playing</b> <b>on</b> one of <b>the</b> <b>yard's</b> moving steam traction-engines. The engine, pulling two trucks, was returning empty from delivering bricks to the new Naval Hospital at Osborne House. Several children were <b>playing</b> by swinging <b>on</b> one of <b>the</b> truck's coupling bar, without the knowledge of the driver and his mate. When one child fell, he was killed instantly by the truck's wheel passing over his head. As the operators had tried to keep children away and had no knowledge that they were still there, an accidental death ruling was given. In 1911, there was almost another tragedy, when a little girl almost drowned in a deep pool at the brickyard. However, she was rescued by a young boy named Thomas Attrill, who received recognition for his bravery.|$|R
5000|$|In 1961, Anthony {{enrolled}} at the University of Michigan. He played at the fullback position for Bump Elliott's Michigan Wolverines football team from 1962 to 1964. He was Michigan's lead rusher in 1963 and 1964. [...] In two games against Iowa in 1963 and 1964, Anthony scored six touchdowns (three each in 1963 and 1964) and rushed for 204 yards (83 in 1963 and 121 yards in 1964). [...] He also rushed for 84 yards on 15 carries (5.6 yards per carry) against the 1963 Ohio State Buckeyes football team. As a senior, Anthony {{was one of the}} leaders of the 1964 Michigan Wolverines football team that won the Big Ten Conference championship and defeated Oregon State in the 1965 Rose Bowl. The 1965 Rose Bowl was Anthony's final game for Michigan, and Anthony was named the game's Most Valuable Player after he rushed for a career-high 123 yards, scored three touchdowns, and averaged 9.5 yards per carry. [...] He also set a Rose Bowl Game record with an 84-yard touchdown run, surpassing the prior record set by Iowa's Bob Jeter in the 1959 Rose Bowl. [...] Following the game, the Long Beach Press Telegram wrote:"Anthony, senior fullback who has been playing in the shadow of Michigan's touted Bob Timberlake, barreled his way into the record books with three touchdowns. His 84-yard dash (it actually was 84, <b>the</b> <b>play</b> starting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 15 <b>yard</b> line) was <b>the</b> longest run in Rose Bowl history [...] [...] [...] while his 18 points tied the Bowl scoring record established 40 years ago by Elmer Layden ... Anthony also recovered the punt that was blocked by tackle Bob Mielke in the third period, grabbing It <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Oregon State 15 — and later going in for the touchdown from a yard out. His other score came on a seven yard run. Although Elliott said he 'probably could name 22 players who could have been voted player of the game,' it was only natural that Anthony received the honor." ...|$|R

6000|$|The {{interview}} in the galley took place {{about half an hour}} before the brig anchored for the night.

This opportunity was much increased by Spike's hailing him, while <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard,</b> and ordering him to take a good look at the sloop-of-war, and at the same time to ascertain if any boats were [...] "prowlin' about, in order to make a set upon us in <b>the</b> night." [...] <b>On</b> receiving this welcome order, Jack answered with a cheerful [...] "Ay, ay, sir," [...] and standing up <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard,</b> he placed an arm around the mast, and remained for a long time making his observations.
