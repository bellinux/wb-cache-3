30|$|Much {{controversy}} {{surrounds the}} existence of the momentum <b>effect</b> and the <b>reversal</b> <b>effect</b> on developed countries’ stock markets. Zhu (2003) is one of the representative scholars and has proved that China does not have a <b>reversal</b> <b>effect</b> through the study of the securities market. Chen Qiao and Wang Shi (2003) found that the inertial strategy based on the industry portfolio showed significant excess returns. Hameed and Ting (2000) found a significant price <b>reversal</b> <b>effect</b> in the Malaysian stock market indicating that there is a <b>reversal</b> <b>effect</b> in developed country stock markets. Gaunt’s (2000) study found that the Australian market also shows a significant <b>reversal</b> <b>effect.</b> His sample interval was from 1974 to 1997, the formation period was five years and, after an 18 -month holding period, the <b>reversal</b> <b>effect</b> appeared. From the theoretical results of these scholars, we conclude that there are divergent views on whether there are momentum and reversal trends in the Chinese market, and the conclusions are totally different. The focus of our study is to clarify medium-term momentum and long-term <b>reversal</b> <b>effects</b> rather than prove their existence. Based on the above literature, we know that the <b>reversal</b> <b>effect</b> is a ubiquitous phenomenon and is concentrated in the medium and long term. Thus, our decision will be more inclined to choose the mature US financial market so that the statement on {{the existence of}} medium-term momentum and long-term reversal will be unified. The US stock market has become a better option for our empirical analysis.|$|R
30|$|The author {{concluded}} that the trading volume of the stock can predict the income of the momentum strategy and {{the duration of the}} momentum effect. When using momentum strategies in high stock returns, the effect of the momentum effect will become less and will continue for a shorter time. In addition to the long-term <b>reversal</b> <b>effects</b> found in the US market, scholars found a <b>reversal</b> <b>effect</b> in other countries. This finding indicates that the effect is not the reason for data mining. Chan et al. (1996) and Chui et al. (2000) found short-term <b>reversal</b> <b>effects</b> in the Japanese market. Baytas and Cakici (1999) note long-term <b>reversal</b> <b>effects</b> in the other seven countries.|$|R
5000|$|The {{expertise}} <b>reversal</b> <b>effect</b> {{refers to}} the reversal {{of the effectiveness of}} instructional techniques on learners with differing levels of prior knowledge. [...] The primary recommendation that stems from the expertise <b>reversal</b> <b>effect</b> is that instructional design methods need to be adjusted as learners acquire more knowledge in a specific domain. Expertise is described as [...] "the ability to perform fluently in a specific class of tasks." ...|$|R
30|$|After {{understanding}} the mid-momentum effect, {{we find that}} the <b>reversal</b> <b>effect</b> becomes easier to interpret. In simple terms, the <b>reversal</b> <b>effect</b> is that the stock that performed poorly in the past period will show a better result in the future. De bondt and Thaler (1985) found that the portfolio of the worst performing 10 % stocks paid 10 % over the stocks that were winners after the three-year formation; the loser portfolio showed a higher than average market return at 19.6 % while the winner portfolio was still lower than 5 %. This study confirmed that the <b>reversal</b> <b>effect</b> exists over a long period, and reversal strategies can be used to achieve substantial returns over a longer period.|$|R

5000|$|Although this {{cognitive}} load theory-driven {{explanation for the}} expertise <b>reversal</b> <b>effect</b> is plausible, {{there are a few}} caveats to keep in mind. First, many studies that demonstrate expertise <b>reversal</b> <b>effects</b> rely on subjective measures of {{cognitive load}}. For example, one common measure is to have learners rate task difficulty by answering the following question on a scale from 1 (extremely easy) to 7 (extremely difficult): [...] "How easy or difficult was it to complete this task?" [...] Some researchers claim that such ratings are increasingly being used as an effective and valid measure of subjective cognitive load. However, others question the use of subjective measures. For example, some question people's ability to provide accurate self-reports of mental effort. Others suggest {{that there is no way}} to know how subjective ratings relate to actual cognitive load. Second, expertise <b>reversal</b> <b>effects</b> have been found in studies outside of the cognitive load paradigm, indicating that alternative explanations remain viable. For example, a number of explanations center on motivational processes.|$|R

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} that more knowledgeable learners do not benefit or even suffer from physically integrated text-picture formats, which work successfully with less knowledgeable learners, {{is called the}} expertise <b>reversal</b> <b>effect</b> in cognitive load theory (CLT) literature. A possible explanation of the expertise <b>reversal</b> <b>effect</b> is offered by CLT researchers, who argue that more knowledgeable learners suffer from extraneous cognitive load. Another explanation is given {{in the context of}} the cognitive theory of multimedia learning (CTML). In the CTML it is assumed that more knowledgeable learners can deal with difficult formats because of being able to invest germane load, that is applying relevant learning strategies. This study examined the different assumptions about the mechanism underlying the expertise <b>reversal</b> <b>effect.</b> Sixty students were assigned to either a group with low or high prior knowledge and to a group with either separated or integrated format, resulting in a 2 x 2 design. All students were eye tracked during learning. Subjective ratings of cognitive load could not support the extraneous load explanation. The results of the eye tracking data rather supported the assumptions made in the CTML...|$|R

50|$|Although {{a number}} of {{research}} have shown that worked-examples have positive effects on learners, Kalyuga et al. (2000, 2001a, b) showed that the worked-example effect {{is related to the}} expertise level of a learner, referred to as expertise <b>reversal</b> <b>effect.</b> In three studies, (Kalyuga et al. 2000, 2001a, b) used worked examples in different experiments, on-screen diagrams in mechanical engineering, examples with explanatory based instruction on writing circuits for relay circuits and programming logic. In the different studies, (Kalyuga et al. 2000, 2001a, b) showed that the efficiency effect of worked examples became ineffective and often resulted in negative effects for more knowledgeable learners (Kalyuga, 2007).However, Nievelstein et al. (2013) argues that both the worked-example effect and the expertise <b>reversal</b> <b>effect</b> that have been previously studied were based on well-structured cognitive tasks such as mechanics (Kalyuga et al. 2000). In a study using less-structured task, using legal cases, Nievelstein et al. (2013) investigates worked example <b>effect</b> and expertise <b>reversal</b> <b>effects</b> on both novice and advanced law students. The results of the study indicate that worked examples had efficiency effect for both the novice students and advanced law students, even though the advanced students had significantly more prior knowledge.|$|R

40|$|This thesis compromises one {{literature}} review chapter and three essays which {{focus on the}} theme of valuation, value premium anomaly, R&D premium anomaly, momentum anomaly and emerging markets. The first essay is entitled “Does Low Book-to-market Predict Low Returns? The Other Side of Growth: Research and Development Investment”. In this essay, I develop a theoretical framework of the risk and return of R&D, and examine the relation between R&D and BM. This paper documents that the intersections of R&D and BM produce enhanced trading strategies, and that the four-factor model, with a R&D factor, outperforms the three-factor model. The second essay, entitled “Firm Characteristics and Momentum”, studies the momentum anomaly. In this essay, I examine the relations of firm characteristics and momentum in US stocks. Momentum effect seems to be less significant in recent years. Most importantly, this paper presents that firm size and growth option may {{plays an important role in}} momentum trading strategy. The returns of large and medium winners/losers tend to sustain, while small winners/losers tend to reverse quickly. Also, it also shows that R&D investment enhance the <b>reversal</b> <b>effect</b> of small firms, especially in high-tech industries. The third essay, entitle “Firm Attributes and Momentum Strategies in China”, focus on the emerging market China. This study investigates the momentum and reversal phenomenon in China, based on most up-to-date data. It shows that Chinese stock market experiences barely momentum <b>effect,</b> but the <b>reversal</b> <b>effect</b> is increasingly significant in the long horizon. Additionally, two risk proxies, size and R&D expense, are employed to explain momentum and <b>reversal</b> <b>effect.</b> It shows that the returns of large stocks are more likely to be persistent, while that of small firms are more likely reverse. Moreover, R&D investment reduces <b>reversal</b> <b>effect,</b> especially for small firms...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} the existence of, and potential causes of, continuation and <b>reversal</b> <b>effects</b> in stock market returns. In {{the first part}} of the research, a timeseries approach is used to consider the profitability of momentum trading strategies on fourteen major stock market indices. Momentum trading strategies exploit continuation in returns, and evidence of significant profits to such strategies therefore implies the presence of continuation effects in the data samples. Significant losses to momentum strategies, on the other hand, are indicative of <b>reversal</b> <b>effects</b> in returns. This part of the research identifies continuation effects in stock index returns over periods of 1 trading day and 10 through 252 trading days. The second part of the research explores the various behavioural and nonbehavioural theories proposed in the literature for the existence of continuation and <b>reversal</b> <b>effects</b> in returns. Such effects imply that stock market trends differ systematically from trends in random data with the same underlying distribution of daily returns. An algorithm from the information technology literature is adapted and used to identify turning points in trends in the fourteen data sets, and the statistical properties of daily returns within stock market trends are analysed. Important patterns are observed in the steepness of trends and the volatility of returns within trends as they develop. These patterns enable some inferences to be drawn as to the most probable factors driving the continuation effects observed in {{the first part of}} the research, with nonsynchronous trading and investor loss aversion highlighted as potential causes of very short-term and medium-term effects respectivel...|$|R

SGC- 7901 and SGC- 7901 / vincristine were cultured in liquid medium RMPI 1640, with the addition of vincristine to the vincristine-resistant line. The <b>reversal</b> <b>effect</b> of Shenghe Powder (using verapamil as con-trol) on the multidrug resistance of SGC- 7901 /vincristine cells was observed using the 3 - 4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 yl) - 2, 5 -diphenylterazolium bromide method.

Shenghe Powder and verapamil decreased the multidrug resistance of SGC- 7901 /vincristine. The effect of Shenghe Powder (10 mg/L) was significantly higher than verapamil (P <. 05). The intracellular concentration of vincristine was increased by Shenghe Powder and verapamil.
