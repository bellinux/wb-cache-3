5|$|Prior to 2007, {{the highway}} was {{extensively}} rehabilitated between Kawartha Lakes Road 121, near Fenelon Falls and Highway 118 in Carnarvon. This included widening the highway {{for a third}} <b>passing</b> <b>lane,</b> {{as well as the}} resurfacing of several sections.|$|E
5|$|The Chickasaw Turnpike {{has only}} two lanes for the {{majority}} of its length; however, there is a short eastbound <b>passing</b> <b>lane.</b> The Chickasaw is the only two-lane turnpike in Oklahoma. Lightly traveled, the road is used by about 2,000vehicles per day.|$|E
5|$|Entering Davis County and North Salt Lake, SR-68 {{reaches a}} second {{interchange}} with I-215 at its Exit 28. The road briefly turns northeast before drifting north again and gaining one lane in each direction. Before passing Skypark Airport, the highway loses one lane in each direction. Redwood Road turns east onto 500 South and enters Bountiful. Past an interchange at I-15, the route gains one <b>passing</b> <b>lane</b> and turns south onto 200 West, a two-lane undivided road. The highway turns southwest and defaults onto southbound US-89 {{within the city}} of Woods Cross.|$|E

Residences and small businesses are also scattered throughout the length of the route.|$|E
5|$|Washington State Route 221 (SR221) {{starts at}} an {{intersection}} with SR14 in the unincorporated community of Paterson. After leaving Paterson the highway travels north through rural farm land as a two-lane highway. A few minor roads are intersected before the roadway {{turns to the}} west after about , before {{turning back to the}} north. After the highway resumes its northerly course it climbs into the Horse Heaven Hills, gaining a <b>passing</b> <b>lane</b> through the uphill segments, before finally terminating at SR22 in south Prosser.|$|E
25|$|State Route 102 near Kraljevica leading {{southbound}} to the Krk Bridge {{used to have}} a three-lane <b>passing</b> <b>lane</b> combination, blind curves, and a steep grade. It {{was later}} changed to a <b>passing</b> <b>lane</b> combination that makes the northbound traffic dominant.|$|E

5000|$|The popular term [...] "West Coast Offense" [...] {{is more of}} a {{philosophy}} and an approach to the game than it is a set of plays or formations. Traditional offensive thinking argues that a team must establish its running game first, which will draw the defense in and open up vertical <b>passing</b> <b>lanes</b> downfield; i.e., <b>passing</b> <b>lanes</b> that run perpendicular to the line of scrimmage.|$|R

25|$|There {{are many}} other little tactics used {{in the game of}} hockey. Cycling moves the puck along the boards in the {{offensive}} zone to create a scoring chance by making defenders tired or moving them out of position. Pinching is when a defenceman pressures the opposition's winger in the offensive zone when they are breaking out, attempting to stop their attack and keep the puck in the offensive zone. A saucer pass is a pass used when an opposition's stick or body is in the <b>passing</b> <b>lane.</b> It is the act of raising the puck over the obstruction and having it land on a teammate's stick.|$|E
25|$|Bird is also {{remembered as}} an {{excellent}} defender. While he was neither fast nor quick-footed, {{and could not}} always shut down an individual player one-on-one, he consistently displayed a knack for anticipating the moves of his opponent, allowing him to intercept passes and create turnovers. His 1,556 career steals ranks 34th all-time. Unspectacular but effective defensive moves, such as jumping into a <b>passing</b> <b>lane</b> to make a steal or allowing his man to step past and drive to the hoop, then blocking the opponent's shot from behind, were staples of Bird's defensive game. In recognition of his defensive abilities, Bird was named to three All-Defensive Second Teams.|$|E
500|$|The highway {{portion of}} SR67 was {{popularly known as}} [...] "Slaughterhouse Alley" [...] {{because of the high}} number of fatal accidents. The road was widened in 1979 to add a {{shoulder}} and <b>passing</b> <b>lane</b> between {{the north end of the}} freeway and Poway Road. During the construction, there were concerns about speeding cars putting the construction workers in danger. The total cost was $927,000 (about $ in [...] dollars), and Asphalt Inc. performed the work.|$|E

500|$|Although {{they are}} usually one lane in either direction, several short {{sections}} with two lanes in one direction as a <b>passing</b> <b>lane</b> exist along the highways. The municipality's lone freeway, Highway 115, is two lanes in either direction for its entire length. There are two off ramps with Highway 115 in the region: One with [...] at the southern boundary with Durham Region; {{and the other one}} with [...] at [...] at the eastern boundary with Peterborough County.|$|E
500|$|The route {{continues}} as a divided two-lane expressway {{in a more}} easterly, then southeasterly, direction as it crosses Tolay Creek and proceeds through the Napa Sonoma Marsh at {{the northern edge of}} San Pablo Bay. Before the construction of the barrier in 1995, this portion of SR 37 was three lanes with the middle lane alternately serving as a <b>passing</b> <b>lane</b> for each direction. This stretch of highway was given the nickname of [...] "Blood Alley" [...] for its high-rate of fatal accidents. With the middle lane removed, accidents dropped dramatically.|$|E
500|$|SH 211 {{currently}} {{exists in}} two separate sections west of San Antonio. [...] The southern section begins at a diamond interchange with US 90 in western Bexar County. [...] The route travels to the north as a two-lane highway with a northbound <b>passing</b> <b>lane</b> {{for the majority of}} the route and is known as either the Texas Research Parkway or the Hill Country Parkway (once it's finally completed), providing access to the Texas Research Park and a Citi service center. [...] This [...] section of the highway ends at FM 1957 just east of the Bexar/Medina county line.|$|E
25|$|SH 1 has varied road conditions. For most of {{its length}} it is a two-lane single {{carriageway}} road with at-grade intersections and access, sealed with chipseal in rural areas or asphalt in urban and high-traffic areas. The highway has frequent <b>passing</b> <b>lanes</b> on these sections, to allow traffic to pass other vehicles safely. Parts of the road are steep by international standards. Most steep sections having a combination of <b>passing</b> <b>lanes</b> (uphill), and crawler lanes or stopping bays (downhill) to allow heavy and slow vehicles {{to pull out of}} the way to let other vehicles pass.|$|R
50|$|It {{has been}} proposed, by the Kansas Department of Transportation, that U.S. Route 50 should be {{converted}} into a 4-lane expressway from Emporia to western Kansas. In the meantime, additional <b>passing</b> <b>lanes</b> may be added.|$|R
50|$|In the AusLink {{project for}} the Junee to Melbourne line, roughly every other section of single line will be {{duplicated}} to provide so-called <b>passing</b> <b>lanes.</b> About 220 km of the 450 km line will be duplicated.|$|R
500|$|The {{northern}} section (Hill Country Parkway) {{begins at}} FM 471 in Medina County and heads north as a two-lane highway, crossing back over into Bexar County and passes briefly through the San Antonio city limits before ending at SH 16. [...] The northern {{section of the}} highway features the occasional <b>passing</b> <b>lane</b> in both directions. [...] This [...] section of the roadway includes a design to provide protection to the Edwards Aquifer, the drinking water supply of San Antonio. [...] To prevent runoff from the highway entering the aquifer, a [...] bridge was sealed {{to prevent it from}} leaking and an aqueduct was constructed nearby to carry the runoff.|$|E
500|$|The , [...] twin tunnels {{serve the}} Central Link light rail line, which uses the tunnel between Westlake and International District/Chinatown {{stations}}, and seven bus routes for King County Metro and Sound Transit Express, which run between Convention Place station and International District/Chinatown station. Entrances {{at the three}} middle stations are built into nearby buildings with variable-message signs over the stairs and elevators leading to the mezzanines. A total of 11 wheelchair-accessible elevators connect the tunnel stations to the surface. As part of the city's public art program that began in 1973, the Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel and its stations were furnished with $1.5 million (equivalent to $million in [...] dollars) in artwork by 25 artists commissioned by King County Metro. All tunnel stations, except Convention Place, are [...] below street level and consist of two side platforms, two pickup lanes, and a <b>passing</b> <b>lane</b> in the middle.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the highway}} was {{designed}} and built to what were, at the time, high standards, with a 100-foot (30 m) wide right-of-way in most places, it was accident-prone because it lacked a median barrier. One segment of the so-called [...] "Bloody Bayshore" [...] was [...] "Boneyard Hill", a steep grade through the Visitacion Valley near the San Francisco city line, running past a bone meal plant. Causes of the crashes included turning conflicts at intersections, and speeding drivers crossing the centerline to use the oncoming lanes as a <b>passing</b> <b>lane.</b> The roadway was entirely at-grade except for crossings of rail lines. It generally followed the present alignment of the Bayshore Freeway, but deviated in several places: Old Bayshore Highway in San Jose, Veterans Boulevard in Redwood City, Bayshore Highway in Burlingame, a destroyed section of road through San Francisco International Airport, and Airport and Bayshore Boulevards from South San Francisco through Brisbane into San Francisco. Within that city, the new highway continued three miles (5km) along the present Bay Shore Boulevard to Army (Cesar Chavez) Street and Potrero Avenue.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{being one}} of the most heavily used roads in the province, as of 2015 only short {{stretches}} of the highway between Saskatoon and Rosetown have been divided to add <b>passing</b> <b>lanes.</b> The only <b>passing</b> <b>lanes</b> west of Rosetown's eastern elevator access interchange, is a small section East and West of Flaxcombe. Extensive oil exploration and development has been occurring since 2010, primarily in the Kindersley Region, from Brock to the Alberta Border. Heavy traffic, agriculture, grain transport, and oilfield service, as well as oil and fuel transports, are common on this highway. Agriculture, and oilfield services are the main industries of the area. [...] The only District hospital on Hwy 7 is located at Kindersley.|$|R
