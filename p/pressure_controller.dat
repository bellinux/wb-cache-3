40|$|Background Cyclic {{redistribution}} of air within the cuff during respiratory pressure changes creates a self-sealing mechanism which allows tracheal sealing, despite tracheal airway pressure being above baseline cuff inflation pressure. The {{aim of the}} present study was to investigate the effect of continuous automated cuff pressure regulation on tracheal sealing during cyclic respiratory pressure changes. Methods In vitro tracheal sealing was studied in four different high volume-low pressure (HVLP) tracheal tube cuffs size internal diameter 8. 0 and 5. 0 mm in combination with a conventional pressure manometer and two different automated <b>pressure</b> <b>controllers</b> (VBM Cuff Controller; Cuff Pressure Control Tracoe™). Experiments were performed at 10, 15, 20, and 25 cm H 2 O cuff pressure during intermittent positive pressure ventilation with peak inspiratory pressures of 20 and 25 cm H 2 O. Air leakage was assessed spirometrically. Experiments were performed four times with each tube brand and size with two exemplars of each of the three cuff <b>pressure</b> <b>controllers.</b> Results Owing to immediate cuff pressure correction, tracheal sealing at cuff pressure below inspiratory pressure was reduced in most of the tracheal tube cuffs, except in those with reduced sealing characteristics when using the Pressure Control Tracoe™ compared with the conventional pressure manometer and the VBM Cuff Controller. Tracheal sealing with the Pressure Control Tracoe™ comparable with the other two devices was only achieved at cuff pressures of 20 and 25 cm H 2 O. Conclusions Automated cuff <b>pressure</b> <b>controllers</b> with rapid <b>pressure</b> correction interfere with the self-sealing mechanism of high sealing HVLP tube cuffs and reduce their improved sealing characteristic...|$|R

50|$|The {{controls}} {{required for}} oil and gas separators are liquid level controllers {{for oil and}} oil/water interface (three-phase operation) and gas back-pressure control valve with <b>pressure</b> <b>controller.</b> Although the use of controls is expensive making the cost of operating fields with separators so high, installations has resulted in substantial savings in the overall operating expense {{as in the case of}} the 70 gas wells in the Big Piney, Wyo sighted by Fair (1968). The wells with separators were located above 7,200 ft elevation, ranging upward to 9,000 ft. Control installations were sufficiently automated such that the field operations around the controllers could be operated from a remote-control station at the field office using the Distributed Control System.

50|$|Most modern {{turbocharged}} aircraft use {{a hydraulic}} wastegate control with engine oil as the fluid. Systems from Lycoming and Continental {{operate on the}} same principles and use similar parts which differ only in name. Inside the wastegate actuator, a spring acts to open the wastegate, and oil pressure acts to close the wastegate. On the oil output side of the wastegate actuator sits the density controller, an air-controlled oil valve which senses upper deck pressure and controls how fast oil can bleed from the wastegate actuator back to the engine. As the aircraft climbs and the air density drops, the density controller slowly closes the valve and traps more oil in the wastegate actuator, closing the wastegate {{to increase the speed}} of the turbocharger and maintain rated power. Some systems also use a differential <b>pressure</b> <b>controller</b> which senses the air pressures {{on either side of the}} throttle plate and adjusts the wastegate to maintain a set differential. This maintains an optimum balance between a low turbocharger workload and a quick spool-up time, and also prevents surging caused by a bootstrapping effect.|$|E

40|$|The use of rotary left {{ventricular}} assist devices (LVADs) has extended to destination and recovery therapy for end-stage heart failure. Incidence of right ventricular failure while on LVAD support requires a second device be implanted {{to support the}} failing right ventricle. Without a commercially available implantable rotary right ventricular assist device, rotary LVADs are cannulated into the right heart and operation modified to provide suitable support for the pulmonary system. While this approach can alleviate the demand for transplant through long-term biventricular support, it uncovers a new challenge with respect to controller strategies for these dual device support systems. This study compares the preload sensitivity of rotary, dual device biventricular assistance controllers {{in light of their}} ability to adjust the flow rate according to physiological demand. A Frank–Starling-like flow controller which requires both inlet pressure and flow sensors is compared to <b>pressure</b> <b>controllers</b> which maintain atrial or inlet cannula pressures {{through the use of a}} single pressure sensor. It was found that cannula selection and the location of a <b>pressure</b> <b>controller’s</b> single <b>pressure</b> sensor can be tailored to adjust the preload sensitivity. When located within the atria, this sensitivity is effectively infinite. Moving the sensor to the base of a 450 -mm cannula, however, decreased the sensitivity to 0. 22 (L/min) /mm Hg. This indicates the potential for simple and reliable VAD controllers with increased preload sensitivity without the need for complex controllers requiring an array of hemodynamic sensors...|$|R
50|$|Balancing an {{installation}} {{is a complicated}} and involved procedure because closing or throttling a valve will increase the flow {{in other parts of}} the installation.

40|$|Background: Inflation and {{assessment}} of the endotracheal tube cuff pressure is often not appreciated as a critical aspect of endotracheal intubation. Appropriate endotracheal tube cuff pressure, endotracheal intubation seals the airway to prevent aspiration and provides for positive-pressure ventilation without air leak. Materials and Methods: Correlations between manual methods of assessing the pressure by an experienced anesthesiologists {{and assessment}} with maintenance of the pressure within the normal range by the automated <b>pressure</b> <b>controller</b> device were studied in 100 patients divided into two groups. In Group M, endotracheal tube cuff was inflated manually by a trained anesthesiologist and checked for its pressure hourly by cuff pressure monitor {{till the end of}} surgery. In Group C, endotracheal tube cuff was inflated by automated cuff <b>pressure</b> <b>controller</b> and pressure was maintained at 25 -cm H 2 O throughout the surgeries. Repeated measure ANOVA was applied. Results: Repeated measure ANOVA results showed that average of endotracheal tube cuff pressure of 50 patients taken at seven different points is significantly different (F-value: 171. 102, P-value: 0. 000). Bonferroni correction test shows that average of endotracheal tube cuff pressure in all six groups are significantly different from constant group (P = 0. 000). No case of laryngomalacia, tracheomalacia, tracheal stenosis, tracheoesophageal fistula or aspiration pneumonitis was observed. Conclusions: Endotracheal tube cuff pressure was significantly high when endotracheal tube cuff was inflated manually. The known complications of high endotracheal tube cuff pressure can be avoided if the cuff <b>pressure</b> <b>controller</b> device is used and manual methods cannot be relied upon for keeping the pressure within the recommended levels...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the feasibility of}} a closed-loop system for simultaneous control of systemic arterial and pulmonary artery blood pressures during cardiac surgery. Design: Feasibility study. Setting: The cardiac surgery operating room. Patients: The performance of the multiple-drug closed-loop system was evaluated during cardiac surgery in 30 patients who required treatment {{with more than one}} vasoactive or inotropic drug. Interventions: A multiple-drug closed-loop system integrated five single-drug blood <b>pressure</b> <b>controllers.</b> Arterial hypertension was controlled using sodium nitroprusside or nitroglycerin, arterial hypotension was controlled using noradrenaline or dobutamine, and pulmonary hypertension was controlled using nitroglycerin. The anesthesiologist selected target pressures and single-drug blood <b>pressure</b> <b>controllers.</b> The multiple-drug closed-loop system had a set of priority rules that automatically activated from the selected single-drug controllers the optimum single-drug controller for each hemodynamic state. Drug infusion rates of the nonactive controllers were kept constant. The initial knowledge that was used to construct the priority rules was obtained from standard anesthetic protocols on perioperative management of cardiac surgical patients. A supervisory computer program defined the actions to be taken in cases of infusion pump problems, invalid pressure measurements, and during unexpected increases and decreases in systemic arterial pressure. Measurements and Main Results: The activation of single-drug controllers by the priority rules was accurate and fast. On average, a different single-drug controller was activated once every 7. 2 mins. As a measure of variability, the average deviation of mean arterial pressure and mean pulmonary artery pressure from their target values was evaluated and was 8. 6 +/- 4. 0 and 4. 4 +/- 4. 0 mm Hg, respectively, before cardiopulmonary bypass and 8. 0 +/- 3. 6 and 2. 4 +/- 0. 9 mm Hg, respectively, after cardiopulmonary bypass.
