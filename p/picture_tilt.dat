The watercraft takes {{the center of}} the <b>picture,</b> <b>tilting</b> sharply to the right, with its hat-donning occupant sitting on the left. The vessel makes its way into the ocean and a misty horizon and toward another sailboat bearing two occupants in the distance. Background is neutral...|$|R
500|$|In {{his writing}} Chatwin experimented with format. With In Patagonia, Clapp said Chatwin {{described}} the book's structure of 97 vignettes as [...] "Cubist." [...] "n other words," [...] she said, [...] "lots of small <b>pictures</b> <b>tilting</b> away and {{toward each other}} to create this strange original portrait of Patagonia." [...] The Songlines was another attempt by Chatwin to experiment with format. The book begins as a novel narrated {{by a man named}} Bruce but about two-thirds of the way through it becomes a commonplace book filled with quotations, anecdotes, and summaries of others' research in an attempt to explore human restlessness. Some of Chatwin's critics did not think he succeeded in The Songlines with this approach, although others applauded his effort at trying an unconventional structure.|$|R

40|$|In {{a popular}} visual illusion, the {{portrait}} on paper currency is folded into an M shape along vertical lines {{through the nose}} and the eyes. When this folded <b>picture</b> is <b>tilted</b> back and forth horizontally the face undergoes striking changes in expression. This distortion reveals two insights concerning 3 D representation in the human visual system and we have explored these with experiments on simple schematic faces and observations on distortions of laser range images of faces. The observations show first that when recovering depicted depth, pictorial cues are interpreted independently of binocular depth information and second, that the recovery of facial expression {{is based on a}} scaled prototypical face structure. 1...|$|R
5000|$|In an interview, de Soto {{discussed}} his {{experience of teaching}} in Mexico, and recalled {{the time when he}} joined an uprising with his fellow teachers to protest their poor compensation, although the school director received money from the GI Bill. [...] De Soto and his fellow teachers created a mural covering 500 square meters in a converted chapel which they called the “Moving Spectator.” José Clemente Orozco, a Mexican artist, worked with them on this project. De Soto explained the title of the mural and described the experience of seeing it in the chapel: “the <b>picture</b> plane <b>tilts</b> so that you’re facing always the picture plane so whether you looked left, down, or in the plane always faced you." ...|$|R

The adobe building, which eventually became the home of Bing Crosby, is <b>pictured</b> at center, <b>tilted</b> slightly to the right background. Several agave plants line the dirt road {{which leads to the}} home at left, while a number of bushes can be seen obscuring the {{view of the}} house in front. The home's spackle is immaculate, as are the tiles of the roof. The building would later become known as the Rancho Santa Fe in 1992...|$|R
5000|$|He {{has spent}} 14 {{years in the}} {{advertising}} industry working across multiple roles including senior art director, head of art, and two creative director titles. In 2010 Geppert was jointly awarded the Crichton Award for new Australian illustrator {{for his work on}} Little Big Tree written by Tim Brown. In 2015 he released his first solo <b>picture</b> book <b>tilted</b> MEEP. The First edition hardcover with dust jacket was published by Tiny Owl Workshop and was selected as a Notable Book by the Children's Book Council of Australia (CBCA) in 2016. It features a baby peacock who gives away his feathers to help his friends feel better about the way they look. It's a story about kindness, friendship and ultimately being happy with the oddities and beautiful imperfections that make you, you and me, me. Or as the author says (inside the dust jacket): For all the people who answer NO to the following question:Are you beautiful? ...|$|R
40|$|Traditions {{encircle}} {{the grieving}} process. These can support mourners in difficult times, for example by prescribing {{how to behave}} appropriately and by expressing a sense of history. On the other hand, this traditional approach can prevent the innovation of this field, thereby missing out on potential support when in sorrow over a lost one. This is what we tried to explore with the work described in this paper. We supported the grieving process by creating two design solutions for mourners. Both concepts focus on communicating commemoration between mourners: the <b>Tilting</b> <b>Picture</b> concept for people that are colocated, and the Mourning Stones concept for people that are not colocated...|$|R
30|$|Figure  5 {{shows the}} text {{recognition}} {{in a complex}} background. Through comparative analysis, {{it can be seen}} that the neural network algorithm accurately detects the English located above and constructs it into a single complete Chinese character. However, because the angle of the text in the <b>picture</b> is <b>tilted</b> and the background contains a lot of horizontal and vertical building disturbances, the Chinese characters and the background of the building also are detected, and they are combined with the noise data to form a larger non-English area. The text located below the image is disturbed by the entrance of the building, and its font is not clear in the figure, and its background is also a strip-shaped building. Therefore, when the stroke area is screened, it is filtered out as a large area together with the background. In the actual identification of the research algorithm of this paper, in addition to the effective elimination of the building part, the Chinese text part can also be eliminated. At the same time, the algorithm only retains the English part, and the English text part is clearly expressed, and the recognition effect is good.|$|R
40|$|International audienceSince human {{behavior}} and perception have evolved within the Earth's gravitational field, humans possess an internal model of gravity. Although gravity {{is known to}} influence the visual perception of moving objects, the evidence is less clear concerning the visual perception of static objects. We investigated whether a visual judgment of the stability of human body postures (static postures of a human standing on a platform and tilted in the roll plane) may also be influenced by gravity and by the participant's orientation. Pictures of human body postures were presented in different orientations with respect to gravity and the participant's body. The participant's body was aligned to gravity (upright) or not (lying on one side). Participants performed stability judgments {{with respect to the}} platform, imagining that gravity operates in the direction indicated by the platform (that was or was not concordant with physical gravity). Such visual judgments were influenced by the picture's orientation with respect to physical gravity. When <b>pictures</b> were <b>tilted</b> by 90 degrees with respect to physical gravity, the human postures that were tilted toward physical gravity (down) were perceived as more unstable than similar postures tilted away from physical gravity (up). Stability judgments were also influenced by the picture's orientation with respect to the participant's body. This indicates that gravity and the participant's body position may influence the visual perception of static objects...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} the {{emergence}} of robust superconducting order in single crystal alloys of 2 H-TaSe_ 2 -xS_x (0 ≤x≤ 2). The critical temperature of the alloy is surprisingly {{higher than that of}} the two end compounds TaSe_ 2 and TaS_ 2. The evolution of superconducting critical temperature T_c (x) correlates with the full width at half maximum of the Bragg peaks and with the linear term of the high temperature resistivity. The conductivity of the crystals near the middle of the alloy series is higher or similar than that of either one of the end members 2 H-TaSe_ 2 and/or 2 H-TaS_ 2. It is known that in these materials superconductivity (SC) is in close competition with charge density wave (CDW) order. We interpret our experimental findings in a <b>picture</b> where disorder <b>tilts</b> this balance in favor of superconductivity by destroying the CDW order.

40|$|We derive the Fundamental Plane (FP) {{relation}} for {{a sample}} of 1430 early-type galaxies in the optical (r band) and the near-infrared (K band), by combining SDSS and UKIDSS data. With such a large, homogeneous dataset, {{we are able to}} assess the dependence of the FP on the waveband. Our analysis indicates that the FP of luminous early-type galaxies is essentially waveband independent, with its coefficients increasing at most by 8 % from the optical to the NIR. This finding fits well into a consistent <b>picture</b> where the <b>tilt</b> of the FP is not driven by stellar populations, but results from other effects, such as non-homology. In this framework, the optical and NIR FPs require more massive galaxies to be slightly more metal rich than less massive ones, and to have highly synchronized ages, with an age variation per decade in mass smaller than a few percent.

40|$|International audienceUnder {{appropriate}} conditions, an observer's {{memory for}} the final position of an abruptly halted moving object is distorted {{in the direction of}} the represented motion. This phenomenon is called "representational momentum" (RM). We examined the effect of mental imagery instructions on the modulation of spatial orientation processing by testing for RM under conditions of picture versus body rotation perception and imagination. Behavioral data were gathered via classical reaction time and error measurements, whereas brain activity was recorded with the help of magnetoencephalography (MEG). Due to the so-called inverse problem and to signal complexity, results were described at the signal level rather than with the source location modeling. Brain magnetic field strength and spatial distribution, as well as latency of P 200 m evoked fields were used as neurocognitive markers. A task was devised where a subject examined a rotating sea horizon as seen from a virtual boat in order to extrapolate either the picture motion or the body motion relative to the picture while the latter disappeared temporarily until a test-view was displayed as a final orientation candidate. Results suggest that perceptual interpretation and extrapolation of visual motion in the roll plane capitalize on the fronto-parietal cortical networks involving working memory processes. Extrapolation of the rotational dynamics of sea horizon revealed a RM effect simulating the role of gravity in rotational equilibrium. Modulation of the P 200 m component reflected spatial orientation processing and a non-voluntary detection of an incongruity between displayed and expected final orientations given the implied motion. Neuromagnetic properties of anticipatory (Contingent Magnetic Variation) and evoked (P 200 m) brain magnetic fields suggest, respectively, differential allocation of attentional resources by mental imagery instructions (<b>picture</b> vs. body <b>tilt),</b> and a communality of neural structures (in the right centro-parietal region) for the control of both RM and mental rotation processes. Finally, the RM of the body motion is less prone to forward shifts than that of picture motion evidencing an internalization of the implied mass of the virtual body of the observer...|$|R
