These were withdrawn prior to the hearings' commencement on 16 January 1968.|$|E

Wilberforce criticised Darwin's theory on ostensibly scientific grounds, arguing that it was not supported by the facts, and he noted that the greatest names in science were opposed to the theory. Nonetheless, Wilberforce's speech is generally only remembered today for his inquiry as to whether it was through his grandmother or his grandfather that Huxley considered himself descended from a monkey.|$|E
2500|$|A {{referendum}} on a proposed {{draft of the}} new Serbian constitution was held on 28 October and 29 October 2006 and {{has resulted in the}} draft constitution being approved by the Serbian electorate. The constitution is Serbia's first as an independent state since the Kingdom of Serbia's 1903 constitution. Over 6.6 million people were entitled to vote in the national referendum. Kosovo did not vote. During the nearly one-century of Serbian rule in Kosovo, this is the only attempt to legally incorporate Kosovo into Serbia, and it was seen by Albanians as an attempt to <b>prejudge</b> the result of the negotiations. In the preamble to the constitution it states that [...] "Kosovo is an autonomous province of Serbia with significant autonomy". Serbian legal scholars found that this unambiguous statement means it would be unconstitutional for Kosovo to secede from Serbia.|$|E

[...] European efforts to [...] "dictate for either party the nature of the outcome on the status of Jerusalem," [...] she said, would only serve to endanger the fulfillment of [...] "our shared vision of two states for two peoples into a reality." [...] Livni also called on France to speak up against the draft during her meeting with Sarkozy in Paris.|$|E
2500|$|Cassius O'Shaugnessy, Alan's college {{friend and}} the actual man who studied yoga, {{is a sort of}} most-interesting-man type {{that seems to be the}} quintessence of {{individuality}} in the novella. A world traveller, Cassius samples all that life has to offer and provides a contrast to Sam, who does not take risks and lives a comfortable life of middle-class security. Bufithis explains that Cassius' life is a critical commentary on the Slovodas and their friends who <b>prejudge</b> and try to rationally control experience—contrasting though with action. O'Shaugnessy is the romantic that seized the day and took control of his own life and destiny, and he, like a hero, has become a topic of conversation for the meek souls on Sunday afternoon. Marvin calls Cassius a [...] "psychopath", presaging Mailer's Hipster in [...] "The White Negro", and explicitly illustrating how Sam and his friends are polar opposites: law-abiding and rational, but lifeless. Cassius' story, then, only validates Sam's notion that his world-view is correct.|$|E
2500|$|In the Comics Journal, Rob Vollmar {{wrote that}} Hagio gives [...] "4/4" [...] and [...] "X+Y" [...] a shōnen-ai beat and explores gender ambiguity; in [...] "4/4" [...] Mori is {{depicted}} as hyper-emotional, and Trill (a woman) has no feelings. Vollmar also highlighted the androgyny of [...] "A, A Primes main characters, noting that Mori and Trill are even more androgynous. In [...] "X+Y", [...] " [...] muted sense of gender identity that is kept to the sub-textual level in '4/4' is transformed into the central conceit ... Hagio effectively scrambles gender awareness until little is left by which to <b>prejudge</b> the dynamic growth of the characters but the result. The resolution of the conflict, then, lies not in whether Mori will overcome his heterosexuality to recognize his biological resonance with the presumably male Tacto, but whether Tacto can remember and thus overcome his childhood experiences in order to accept love from anyone." [...] According to Vollmar, the problems raised by Hagio are not only romantic but [...] "thorny moral and ethical questions".|$|E

[...] Thomas Huxley is said to have replied {{that he would not be}} ashamed to have a monkey for his ancestor, but he would be ashamed to be connected with a man who used his great gifts to obscure the truth. Darwin was not present, but several of his friends replied, with Huxley perhaps the most effective. The general view was and still is that Huxley had got the better of the exchange but there are dissenting voices, and Wilberforce himself thought he had done well. 'Reports from the time suggest that everybody enjoyed himself immensely, and all went cheerfully off to dinner together afterwards.'. [...] As a son of William Wilberforce he was deeply concerned about the ethical consequences of what we now call Social Darwinism.|$|E
2500|$|Caledonian re-applied to the ATLB for a licence {{to launch}} transatlantic {{scheduled}} services from Gatwick, Heathrow or Stansted via Prestwick to New York JFK, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Toronto, and from Birmingham via Prestwick to New York, in 1967. These services {{were to be}} gradually introduced between 1969/70 and 1970/71 utilising the new 707s. BUA, British Eagle and Transglobe Airways simultaneously applied for similar licences. Caledonian objected to the other independent airlines' applications. BOAC opposed all the independents' applications. The Board of Trade (BOT) directed the ATLB to <b>prejudge</b> the four contenders' applications in order to concentrate only on those that stood a reasonable chance of success under existing bilateral arrangements before the route licensing hearings could begin. As a result, BUA withdrew its own applications but objected to Caledonian's and British Eagle's. Transglobe withdrew its applications as well. Caledonian and British Eagle objected to each other's applications. The ATLB heard Caledonian's applications, British Eagle's counter applications [...] and BOAC's objections in early 1968. Following {{the conclusion of the}} transatlantic scheduled licensing hearings in mid-1968, the ATLB rejected Caledonian's and British Eagle's applications. It felt that the independents generally lacked the financial strength to acquire the then latest widebodied and supersonic transport (SST) aircraft for their proposed services, and that these airlines had insufficient economies of scale to enable them to compete with BOAC and the American carriers on a level playing field. It also felt that it would take the independents too long to make these services profitable. In Caledonian's case, the ATLB found that despite having a dedicated North American sales force and its own ground handling operation at John F. Kennedy Airport, the airline's lack of any kind of scheduled service experience and its almost total reliance on Sabena's and Aviation Traders' engineering support counted against granting it a scheduled service licence {{for one of the most}} competitive air markets in the world. Secondary factors for the ATLB's rejection of Caledonian's applications included the delay in the introduction of Concorde and the non-availability within the envisaged timeframe of widebodied aircraft that were smaller and carried a lower price tag than the Boeing 747, which would have made them better suited to the type of operation proposed.|$|E
