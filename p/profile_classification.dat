40|$|This study {{investigated}} the type and stability of temperament profiles in toddlers, and relations of profile probability to negative and positive parenting trajectories. Mothers (N[*] =[*] 96) rated their child’s (41 girls and 54 boys) Sociability, Anger Proneness, and Activity Level four times during 1 year. The assessment of parenting included both maternal self-reports and observational measures. Latent profile analysis indicated three child temperament profiles: a well-adjusted ‘typical’ profile, an ‘expressive’ profile with heightened externalizing problems, and a ‘fearful’ profile with heightened internalizing problems. Although toddlers’ <b>profile</b> <b>classifications</b> were highly stable across 1 year, individual differences in (changes in) toddlers’ temperament profile probability occurred.

40|$|Building a model {{plays an}} {{important}} role in DNA microarray data. An essential feature of DNA microarray data sets is that the number of input variables (genes) is far greater than the number of samples. As such, most classification schemes employ variable selection or feature selection methods to pre-process DNA microarray data. In this paper Flexible Neural Tree (FNT) model for gene expression <b>profiles</b> <b>classification</b> is done. Based on the predefined instruction/operator sets, a flexible neural tree model can be created and evolved.

40|$|Recent {{literature}} {{has noted that}} not all youth who experience adverse circumstances (e. g. poverty, exposure to violence, maltreatment) end up displaying expected unfavorable outcomes (e. g. academic failure, depression, drug dependence); in fact, some youth display “resilience,” broadly understood as adaptive functioning {{in the face of}} adversity (Luthar, Cicchetti, 2 ̆ 6 Becker, 2000). Overall, research on resilience has offered a new approach to the study of at-risk populations, emphasizing the study of strengths, processes, and mechanisms among individuals and communities that may favor positive adaptation, rather than emphasizing deficits among those experiencing adversity (Schoon, 2012). Although resilience research has come a long way, the importance of cultural processes in resilience only recently has been considered, there is still a dearth of studies among diverse contexts and cultural groups (Betancourt et al., 2011), and {{there is a lack of}} prospective analyses examining the stability of resilience over time (O’Dougherty et al., 2015). The present study examined the existence of profiles of adjustment among youth who had experienced some kind of adversity in three contexts: (1) Medellin, Colombia (n = 967); (2) Guatemala (n = 2. 470); and (3) Chicago, USA (n= 491), as well as protective factors associated with <b>profile</b> <b>classification.</b> Furthermore, the continuity of profiles over time was examined in the Chicago sample. Results showed that for each context, diverse profiles of adjustment emerge in the presence of adversity. For all contexts some youth were classified as either resilient (defined as scoring 1 SD above or below the mean on selected indicators) or as holding steady (scoring above the mean but less than 1 SD). Profiles exhibiting high levels of internalizing symptoms, externalizing problems, or problems across domains also were identified across contexts. Protective factors at the individual (e. g. sex, intelligence, prosocial behavior) and at the contextual (e. g. family cohesion, prosocial peers, positive relationship with teacher) levels proved relevant for <b>profile</b> <b>classification,</b> with some factors being relevant in one context but not in another. Prospective analyses revealed both continuity and discontinuity in <b>profile</b> <b>classification</b> among youth in Chicago, with some youth remaining classified in the same group across time points, whereas others transitioned between groups. These results highlight the importance of studying resilience in context, given that what constitutes a salient protective factor for some youth may not be relevant for others. Moreover, these results show that as youth negotiate developmental tasks within their ecologies, there is potential for both continuity and discontinuity in resilience processes. The results can inform prevention and intervention efforts aiming to work from a strength based approach...|$|E

While the mixed results from the load profile generation pattern indicate a general adequacy of the pattern itself, load profile repair did not work out well for training data generated by the optimization models. Since generation based on a control vector and repair are similar tasks, we conclude that this is likely due to the determinacy of the rules applied in the generation pattern, {{as opposed to the}} optimization which generates one of a possibly infinite number of repaired profiles. Hence, for future evaluations of the repair pattern there should be a well-defined solution.|$|E

40|$|Multiple myeloma (MM) is {{a cancer}} of antibody-making plasma cells. It {{frequently}} harbors alterations in DNA and chromosome copy numbers, {{and can be}} divided into two major subtypes, hyperdiploid (HMM) and non-hyperdiploid multiple myeloma (NHMM). The two subtypes have different survival prognosis, possibly due to different but converging paths to oncogenesis. Existing methods for identifying the two subtypes are fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and copy number microarrays, with increased cost and sample requirements. We hypothesize that chromosome alterations have their imprint in gene expression through dosage effect. Using five MM expression datasets that have HMM status measured by FISH and copy number microarrays, we have developed and validated a K-nearest-neighbor method to classify MM into HMM and NHMM based on gene expression <b>profiles.</b> <b>Classification</b> accuracy for test datasets ranges from 0. 83 to 0. 88.

This study examined how the genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and background genes influence the volatile compounds (analysed with Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry or GC/MS) and microbial communities (analysed using Denaturating Gradient Gel Electrophoresis or DGGE) in scent-marks produced by congenic strains of mice. The use of Consensus Principal Components Analysis is described and shows relationships between {{the two types of}} fingerprints (GC/MS and DGGE <b>profiles).</b> <b>Classification</b> methods including Support Vector Machines and Discriminant Partial Least Squares suggest that mice can be classified according to both background strain and MHC-haplotype.

These results indicate that the volatiles in scent-marks provide information about genetic similarity of the mice, and support the idea that the production of these genetically determined volatiles is influenced by commensal microflora.

40|$|This {{research}} {{challenges the}} existing geodemographics ethos by investigating the benefit {{to be gained}} from a move away from conventional areal unit categorisation to systems capable of classifying at the individual level. This research will present a unique framework through which classifications can be developed at this level of resolution.

Issues such as ecological fallacy, Modifiable Areal Unit Problem and generalisation are aspects to be considered when interpreting spatially aggregated data. A move away from such problems is one of the central objectives of this research. Data variables from the UK’s 2001 Small Area Microdata file underpin this research. These variables undergo transformation from categorical states into scale variables based on gross monthly income data present in the British Household Panel Survey therefore enabling effective clustering.

Second, analysis of interview data from industry and government agency participants was carried out using a modified grounded theoretical approach and concept mapping.
