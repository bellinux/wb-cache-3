50|$|From 1738 to 1746, Edward Cave {{published}} in occasional issues of The Gentleman's Magazine semi-fictionalized accounts of contemporary {{debates in the}} two Houses of Parliament under the title of Debates in the Senate of Lilliput. The names of the speakers in the debates, other individuals mentioned, politicians and monarchs present and past, and most other countries and cities of Europe ("Degulia") and America ("Columbia") were thinly disguised {{under a variety of}} Swiftian pseudonyms. The disguised names, and the pretence that the accounts were really translations of speeches by Lilliputian politicians, were a reaction to an Act of Parliament forbidding the <b>publication</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounts</b> of its debates. Cave employed several writers on this series: William Guthrie (June 1738 - November 1740), Samuel Johnson (November 1740 - February 1743), and John Hawkesworth (February 1743 - December 1746).|$|E
5000|$|Bogles {{expedition}} set out {{the same}} year and consisted of himself, an army surgeon named Alexander Hamilton, and Purangir Gosain (an agent of the Sixth Panchen Lama, the effective ruler of Tibet), {{as well as a}} retinue of servants. Despite warnings from the Chinese government and the Panchen Lama that he was not allowed to enter Tibet, he made use of the recent political instability in Bhutan and tension between the Panchen Lama and the regent for the 7th Dalai Lama to win access to Tibet where he was brought before the Panchen Lama in Shigatse. [...] Bogle made a favourable impression on the Sixth Panchen Lama and spent six months overwintering in his palaces learning what he could of Tibetan culture and politics. Bogle was struck by the experience, noting in his journal, When I look upon the time I have spent among the Hills it appears like a fairy dream. It may have been the <b>publication</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounts</b> of his journey which established the myth of Tibet as Shangri-la.

40|$|The late-seventeenth and early-eighteenth centuries saw a {{dramatic}} increase in the <b>publication</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounts</b> of voyages on the London book market. These publications ranged from brief extracts of romantic narratives involving shipwrecks in the East Indies to multi-volume compilations of voyages to all parts of the world, printed in folio and containing numerous maps and engravings. Existing scholarship often views such accounts as entertainment destined for a popular audience. This dissertation shows how the voyage account was used in multiple genres and multiple intellectual contexts, finding its way into debates about natural philosophy, religion, and history, and playing as important a role {{in the work of the}} Royal Society as it did in the literary practices of the period. By investigating these books as key texts in a changing intellectual and cultural climate, and understanding their relationships with other genres, “The Geographicall Compass” offers a reader’s view of empire and the world in England between 1660 and 1730. This project analyses the interaction between the narrative and paratextual elements of accounts of long-range voyages of discovery in the early-modern era, in order to investigate how ideas about the New World found their way into political, scientific and cultural spheres in seventeenth-century Europe. I argue that we can understand how the commercial market shaped knowledge of the New World by considering these books as books – written, published, bought and sold for a reading public, subject to commercial pressures and prone to failure. Focussing mainly but not exclusively on voyages to the New World, this dissertation uses Samuel Purchas’ metaphor – the voyage account as a compass – to discuss these texts in their scientific, religious, literary and political contexts. As the cartographers of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries used the geometrical compass to shape their maps, and seamen used the magnetic compass to find their direction in the expanse of the sea, so I use the compass as a way of understanding texts that are composite, multi-layered, and were produced in multiple, overlapping contexts...|$|E

40|$|The cotton industry, and {{its dark}} satanic mills, {{has long been}} a metaphor for {{the rise and fall of}} Britain as a {{manufacturing}} economy. Useful questions can thus be addressed by examining the industry's transition from growth to maturity. In 1860, no one would have disputed its world supremacy and domination of the British export economy. By 1922 there were as many pessimists as optimists regarding future prospects. It is therefore appropriate to investigate the conditions that governed long-term development in the period between these dates. Many previous authors have addressed the broad agenda of the evolution and growth of the cotton industry.
