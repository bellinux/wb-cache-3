40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{framework}} for contingency management using smart loads, which are realized through the emerging paradigm of the Internet of Things. The framework involves the system operator, the load serving entities (LSEs), and the end-users with smart home management systems, that automatically control adjustable loads. The system operator uses an efficient linear equation solver to quickly calculate the load curtailment needed at each bus to relieve congested lines after contingencies. Given this curtailment request, an LSE calculates a <b>power</b> <b>allowance</b> for each of its end-use customers. We approximate this large-scale, NP-hard, problem to a convex optimization for efficient computation. A smart home management system determines the appliances allowed {{to be used in}} order to maximize the user’s utility within the <b>power</b> <b>allowance</b> given by the LSE. Since the users’ utility depends on the nearfuture utilization of the appliances, we propose the Welch-based Reactive Appliance Prediction (WRAP) algorithm to predict the user behavior and maximize utility. The proposed framework is validated using the New England 39 -bus test system. We show that power system components at risk can be quickly alleviated by adjusting a large number of small smart loads. Additionally, WRAP accurately predicts the users’ future behavior, minimizing the impact on their utility...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} applying simultaneous wireless {{information and}} power transfer (SWIPT) technique to cooperative clustered wireless sensor networks, where energy-constrained relay nodes harvest the ambient radio-frequency (RF) signal {{and use the}} harvested energy to forward the packets from sources to destinations. To this end, we first formulate the energy-efficient cooperative transmission (eCotrans) problem for SWIPT in clustered wireless sensor networks as a non-convex constrained optimization problem. Then, by exploiting fractional programming and dual decomposition, we develop a distributed iteration algorithm for power allocation, power splitting and relay selection to solve the non-convex optimization problem. We find that power splitting ratio plays an imperative role in relay selection. Our simulation results illustrate that the proposed algorithm can converge within a few iterations and the numerical analysis provides practical insights into the effect of various system parameters, such {{as the number of}} relay nodes, the inter-cluster distance and the maximum transmission <b>power</b> <b>allowance,</b> on energy efficiency and average harvested power.

It {{has been estimated that}} in Europe for the year 2015, Broadband {{equipment is}} responsible for an energy consumption of about 50 TWh per year. The European Commission JRC established in 2005 in collaboration with stakeholders (service providers, network operators, equipment and component manufacturers) the Code of Conduct for Broadband Equipment (CoC-BB), with the aim of limiting the energy consumption via the adoption of energy efficient technologies without hampering or limiting the service provided. The BB-CoC covers equipment for broadband services both on the network side and on the customer side. On the customer side, it includes equipment for both the residential sector and Small Office Home Office (SOHO) applications, but not the terminals like, e. g., PCs or TVs. Most of the broadband equipment has a complete set of associated power targets. The Code of Conduct is regularly updated in order to follow the fast technological development in this sector, with potential and concrete advantages compared to minimum efficiency standards set by regulation.

The method uses a combined deterministic and heuristics-based approach for the analysis. Initially, deterministic steady-state tools, such as load flow and EPfast, are used to explore the possibility of uncontrolled islanding. Heuristics are then used to esti-mate additional potential cascading effects, particularly during the transient period. The effects of the electromagnetic pulse are determined on the basis of findings from previous related studies, while the probable system dynamic response is estimated by using heuristics. System resilience is heuristically as-sessed in several aspects, including partial and full-load rejection capability of participating power plants, <b>power</b> swing <b>allowance</b> based on initial power angle values, and over-frequency relay protection suffi-ciency against extreme grid events such as sudden loss of a large load.

40|$|This paper uses a {{bilateral}} oligopoly model {{to study the}} slotting allowances in retailing industries. There are two symmetric manufacturers competing in the upstream market. In the downstream, there are a large retailer with considerable market share, and many small retailers with insignificant market shares. Suppose that only the large retailer is able to require slotting allowances. The retailers engage in price competition with spatial differentiation. The model suggests that the large retailer uses slotting allowances to capitalize its market power. By requiring slotting fees, the large retailer can raise the wholesale prices faced by the competing small retailers, and therefore lower their profit margins and market shares. The large retailer, on the contrary, achieves greater profit margins and market share. The lump sum part of the slotting fees is wholly bore by the manufacturers. But the slotting fees that are linear to the sales are actually bore by the competing small retailers and their customers. In this sense, requiring slotting allowance is an exclusionary strategy of the large retailer. Exclusionary strategy, Market <b>power,</b> Slotting <b>allowance...</b>|$|R

Used interface circuit consists of double charge-pump topology, comprising a storage element (pre-charged reservoir capacitance), dual antiphase variable capacitance and an intermediate storage element, with an inductive flyback return path. Since high voltages are expected {{in the long term}} operation, switch component of the interface circuit is realized as a high-voltage PMOS device from AMSH 35 process by AMS. Concerning the interface circuit, theoretical analysis was introduced, to demonstrate the requirement for precise synchronization of the switch with the circuit voltage levels, with the purpose of optimizing the harvested energy. Previous work was addressed, and this work was built upon it. For decreasing the power consumption of the critical component, a low power clock-signal generator was designed, with power consumption of approximately 0. 35 nW, and accompanying stable current reference with constant power consumption of 0. 57 nW, and 4. 7 %/V current deviation caused by variations in the supply voltage. Additionally, issues accompanying the long term operation, and thus increase in the pre-charge voltage, were discussed in details, and subject of interest for further research and promising possible improvements were suggested...|$|R

A mixed complementarity problem model is used to assess the initial emission allowance allocation methods in the Korean electricity market in [10]. With respect to China’s existing pilot ETSs, their allowance mechanism is compared with schemes in EU and California [11], historical data on the price and trading volume is applied to assess the financial performance of the Shenzhen carbon market [12] and the distinct features of the Hubei ETS are summarized in [13]. As regards China’s future national ETS, a multi-regional computable general equilibrium (CGE) model is adopted to examine the effects of a nationwide carbon market on CO 2 reduction efficiency under different emission reduction targets [14] and an online questionnaire has been conducted to identify the factors affecting companies’ awareness and perception of the ETS [15], however quantitative analysis is still inadequate in this area.

50|$|The {{equipment}} {{needs to}} be housed in suitable enclosures appropriate to {{the environment in which}} the equipment is to be installed. Whether installed in single or multiple enclosures will depend on the site and the way that communications equipment is usually configured on that platform. Each set of equipment will require <b>power</b> and appropriate <b>allowance</b> for cooling.The components of the Link 22 architecture have to be inter-connected via appropriate cabling and communications devices.The DLP-to-SNC interface and the SNC-to-LLC interface both use Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). If TCP/IP is communicating within a processor, no cabling is required for the interface, which would be the case if the DLP and SNC were running on the same processor. When on separate equipment or processors, TCP/IP can use many types of network interfaces. The LLC interface uses Ethernet and so the SNC-to-LLC interface has to be Ethernet. Two Ethernet ports can be joined together with a simple cross-over Ethernet cable (point-to-point), or joined together using an Ethernet hub or switch. The use of an Ethernet hub is recommended to allow for monitoring of the interface. If the SNC host processor only has one Ethernet port then a single hub could be used for both the DLP-to-SNC and the one or more SNC-to-LLC interfaces.The LLC is connected to the SPC via RS-422 serial cable.The SPC is connected to its radio via a media specific interface, and is a national responsibility. It could even be implemented with the SPC being housed within the radio. Refer to the SPC and radio manufacturers’ manuals for exact details of the interface.|$|R
40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis shows that shared spectrum wireless networks can be enhanced {{through the use of}} additional nodes and power control. Network improvement is demonstrated in three key areas: connectivity, capacity and power efficiency. It is also shown that the techniques developed to increase network capacity and power efficiency {{have a positive effect on}} the security of the network. Mobile ad hoc networks are the specific focus of the work, but the results are applicable to both wireless sensor networks and shared spectrum wireless infrastructure based networks. This thesis demonstrates how additional nodes may be used in mobile wireless networks to maintain connectivity by specifically targeting bridges and articulation points. It then takes a graph theoretical approach to networking, with the assumption that lowering interference increases network capacity, to show that additional nodes combined with power control can be used to simultaneously increase the capacity and power efficiency of wireless networks. An implementation of a novel method to generate all possible transmission states under a Request To Send (RTS) / Clear To Send (CTS) scheme is used in the creation of a repeatable metric, Uniform Average Network Capacity (UANC). This metric describes the capacity that can be held within a network, and is suitable for comparing one network to another, enabling its use in optimisations. UANC is used in a multi objective cross entropy optimisation of capacity and power efficiency to create Pareto optimal sets of viable network topologies which exhibit high capacity and low power use. The work presented then derives the conditions under which n simultaneous transmissions are beneficial to capacity. This leads to the definition of a separation multiplier, i. e., the ratio of distances between receivers and between senders and their receivers, which is used to create wireless networks which exhibit high UANC. The separation multiplier is then utilised in existing networks, where topologies are altered through the modification of transmission powers and the use of additional nodes, to create higher capacity networks, showing that additional nodes can benefit network capacity. This technique has the added benefit of increasing network power efficiency. A modification to the RTS/CTS protocol which uses the separation multiplier is then presented. The new scheme has the effect of allowing only beneficial simultaneous transmissions to occur. It is shown through simulation that this approach increases network capacity. Networks which implement the capacity and power efficiency enhancing measures presented are shown to exhibit increased security, in that the lowering of transmission <b>power</b> and <b>allowance</b> of multiple transmissions within the network reduces the distance at which trans- missions can be detected and decoded. Finally, an implementation of the overall knowledge gained through the thesis is presented, augmenting existing networks with additional nodes and power control to create bi-connected, power efficient and high capacity networks.

We first test the standalone model on a 190 km river reach, the Delaware River, where we have detailed flow and temperature data. An R 2 of 0. 88 is obtained on hourly data for this initial test. Next, we integrate the standalone temperature model into a series of models—rainfall-runoff model, water demand model, water resource management model, and power plant uptake and release model—for the contiguous USA (CONUS), with about 19, 000 segments total. With this system in place, we then validate the standalone water temperature model within the system for 16 river stations throughout the CONUS, where we have measured daily temperature data. The model performs reasonably well with a median R 2 of 0. 88. A variety of climate and emissions scenarios are then applied to the model to test regions of higher vulnerability to river temperature environmental violations, making use of output from two GCMs and six emissions scenarios focusing on projections out to 2050. We find that the two GCMs project significantly different impacts to water temperature, driven largely by the resulting changes in streamflow from the two models. We also find significantly different impacts on the withdrawal allowed by thermal power plants due to environmental regulations. Potential impacts on generation are between + 3 % and - 4 % by 2050 for the unconstrained emissions case and + 3. 5 % to - 2 % for the stringent GHG mitigation policy (where 1 % is equivalent to 32 TWh, or about 3 billion USD/year using 2005 electricity prices).

40|$|The goal of {{this work}} is to select the best {{candidate}} fuel materials to deliver high burnup in advanced light water reactors. Uranium and thorium based fuels are considered. These fuel materials {{must be able to}} withstand nearly double the burnup of current LWRs in high irradiation fields. Reactor economics, safety, proliferation resistance, fuel reprocessing and spent fuel disposal are the most important factors to be addressed. High burnup will provide the opportunity for uninterrupted operation over long periods of time, reduction of spent fuel volume and improvement of proliferation resistance. Thus, effective power cycle maintenance and fuel management and reduced fuel storage needs will lead to more economic operation. Several uranium and thorium fuel forms are analyzed to predict their capability to withstand high burnups. Their fuel cycle cost is also considered. To compare the fuel options, simple indices characterizing the behavior of the materials at high burnup are defined. Indices for the thermal stress capability, stored energy and margin for melting are derived from non-dimensional analyses. To evaluate the fuel pin lifetime, a simplified fuel performance analysis code, FUELSIM (FUEL SIMulation code) was developed. The code utilizes the VENSIM simulation system, which allows for great flexibility in the change of governing relations, permits sensitivity analysis, and facilitates graphical outputs. Based on the sensitivity analysis by FUELSIM, dominant parameters are identified and a simplified expression is developed for predicting the increase in the pin internal pressure with burnup. For each material, we obtain a maximum attainable burnup at a given smear density. Cladding strain, internal pressure and fuel melting (or phase-change) temperature are the limiting factors used to obtain these burnups. From neutronic reactivity considerations, the needed [superscript 235]U enrichment can be specified. Thus, the fuel cycle cost for each material and smear density can be estimated. Metals, oxides, carbides and nitrides of uranium and thorium were examined. Although the results show that UN provides the highest potential for attaining high burnup and economic application in once-through cycles, it has limited compatibility with water. UO[subscript 2], at 90 - 95 % smear density, continues being the most feasible option as a nuclear material. Also, ThO[subscript 2]/UO[subscript 2] seems to offer as good or better potential performance and economics as UO[subscript 2]. However, more reliable data on the irradiation behavior of the different materials is needed before a definitive conclusion can be drawn. Also important in the evaluation of thorium/uranium cycles are attributes that were not considered here. These include the reduction in spent fuel volume, the improvement in proliferation resistance, possible <b>power</b> uprates and <b>allowance</b> for a higher peaking factor that may be possible by taking advantage of the increased margin that results from using fuels with lower stored energies.
