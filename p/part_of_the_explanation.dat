A growing number of Scottish scholars emerged who had an increasing confidence in their own literature. <b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>explanation</b> for the sudden flowering of the Scottish Enlightenment, is that the country already had a history of achievements in philosophy, poetry, music, mathematics and architecture and was in close touch with intellectual trends in the rest of Europe. From this period Scotland would make major contributions in the fields of medicine, law, philosophy, geology and history. Among these ideas the limitation of royal sovereignty over the people remained present in Scottish intellectual life and resurfaced to contribute to the major debates of the eighteenth century.|$|E

Wisden commented that his batting {{was as good}} as it had ever been, but his bowling lacked spin and accuracy. He played only four more times in {{first-class}} cricket. <b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>explanation</b> was that he joined Dunlop Rubber as a manager at one of its mills in Rochdale. He played as an amateur for Rochdale Cricket Club in 1920, but by 1921 he had left the club—the Manchester Guardian speculated that he had returned to Surrey. He returned to live with his family in Merton Park, and played for the local cricket club. Of his first-class matches, one was for Surrey against the Australian touring team of 1921 and the others were for teams representing the Gentlemen. In his entire first-class career, Crawford scored 9,488 runs at an average of 32.60 and took 815 wickets at 20.66.|$|E

Objective: This was done {{with a view to}} providing baseline information that will help in <b>the</b> creation <b>of</b> awareness of occupational hazards among cleaners. Methodology: This is a descriptive study that was carried out among 230 cleaners working in a University in South Western Nigeria. Results: The results showed that knowledge about job hazards is exceedingly high among <b>the</b> sampled cleaners. <b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>explanations</b> for this is that most of them had received formal training for the job. Interestingly, having received such training is the only factor that is significantly associated with <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> awareness among <b>the</b> cleaners.

This radiation-induced taurine depletion can itself have various harmful effects (as will also be the case when taurine depletion is due to other causes, such as alcohol abuse or cancer therapy with cytotoxic drugs), but taurine supplementation {{has been shown to}} have radioprotective effects apparently going beyond what might be expected just as a consequence <b>of</b> correcting <b>the</b> harmful consequences <b>of</b> taurine deficiency per se.

He asked Hodgson, during his absence on the Continent, to visit the lady and send him frequent news of her. Hodgson did so, with the result that, at Bland's return, the lady refused to see him. When Byron came back from his Eastern tour, he received a frantic letter from Bland, telling him that Hodgson had stolen her love. To this Byron refers in his letter to Harness, December 15, 1811, and probably told an embellished story to Hobhouse.

Article 9 (on accessibility) in the United Nations’ Convention on <b>the</b> Rights <b>of</b> Persons with Disabilities states that the parties to the convention shall take appropriate measures to ‘promote access for persons with disabilities to new information and communications technologies and systems, including the Internet’.

Analysis is based on survey data where computer and internet use by young people with disabilities (n= 389) are compared with a reference group from general population (n= 940).

2500|$|Shockley, {{angered by}} not being {{included}} on the patent applications, secretly continued his own work to build {{a different sort of}} transistor based on junctions instead of point contacts; he expected this kind of design {{would be more likely to}} be commercially viable.

Shockley was also dissatisfied with certain <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>explanation</b> for how <b>the</b> point contact transistor worked and conceived <b>of</b> <b>the</b> possibility <b>of</b> minority carrier injection. On February 13, 1948 another team member, John N.
