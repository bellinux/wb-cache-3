40|$|Abstract. - The {{problem of}} form {{generation}} {{and of the}} transmission of <b>production</b> <b>instructions</b> is discussed, introducing the concept of “form process”. Examples {{for the use of}} physical models in form-finding with structural motivation and for architectural motivations are presented. In structural design, physical models have been used to determine the figure of equilibrium for structures resistant by form, such as tents, tensile structures or shell structures. For structural design as well as for architectural design not concerning structure, some examples for the application of artistic working methods are discussed, and it is shown how it has become possible to realize the outcome of the form-finding process in industrial production. One can find “free forms ” in buildings for structural or for designing reasons. In the latter case, the designer of a building decided to give a particular form to the building, motivated by his conception of the project and perhaps his sculptural ambitions. Structures that are resistant by form, on the other hand, often present complex forms, forms that in many cases cannot be defined by elementary geometrical concepts, due to the interrelation between form and forces which is essential for these structures. For realizing free forms in buildings, two fundamental tasks must be pursued: first comes th...|$|R

The paper outlines the information requirements of a process plan {{so that they can be}} used for generic shop floor control. These requirements are expressed as a function of the shop floor tasks/activities that are required to produce a product. The process planning requirements represent a basic part of the shop floor control system's ability to change its actions so that alternative products can be produced using the same control schema. By altering data in its databases, new manufacturing process information and alternative process information can be considered and executed by the shop floor control system. The information for process plans must be presented in an unambiguous manner so that the <b>production</b> <b>instructions</b> can be executed in a predictable manner. Specifically, we define the current use and implementation of process plans.

40|$|This thesis {{was carried}} out {{as a case study}} for Granite Partners Ltd, where the {{researcher}} is also employed as a Marketing & Account manager. The aim of this research is to identify critical gaps in the subject company’s value creation process and to provide a framework for future value creation improvement projects. The main research questions of this thesis are: 1) How can value creation to customers and its improvement be approached as a process? 2) What are factors specific to Granite that create value to customers? 3) How can a company conduct systematic value creation improvement projects using a process approach framework? The research was conducted as a pragmatic, mixed-method research utilizing an online survey, semi-structured interview, literature review and expert analysis as its main methods. In addition to a literature review, a customer base wide online survey was conducted and four representatives from two customer companies were interviewed. Based on the findings, the research questions were answered. The online survey provided an overall picture of the current state of customer value creation and customer satisfaction. No major gaps in value creation was found in gap analysis of the online survey, but open ended comments revealed some issues that were further elaborated in the interviews. Customer interviews offered a more detailed picture of issues and concrete improvement areas that were related to four distinct categories: communication, service <b>production,</b> <b>instructions</b> of use and usability & feature improvement. Concrete improvement measures were develpod for each issue and an action plan to implement them. A framework for improving created value to customer was also created based on the theory and empirical results. The final version of the framework offers a systematic way to tackle all future value creation improvement projects at Granite or other companies utilizing the framework.

40|$|The {{heat pipe}} {{augmented}} solar wall operates much more efficiently for domestic air heating than alternative passive solar technologies. The thermal diode effect of heat pipes reduces the insulating losses {{of the unit}} during nighttime and adverse solar conditions. The exceptionally high conductivity of heat pipes allows for much greater heat gains, and significantly reduces the response time of the unit. The response time is also reduced by a smaller thermal mass of preheating components, which allows the system to passively alternate between insulating and heating conditions much more quickly. By separating the thermal mass of the system from external cold temperatures {{through the use of}} insulation and heat pipes, the insulation values of the unit are larger than that of other passive devices. A heat pipe augmented solar wall was designed with emphasis on thermal efficiency and mass manufacturing techniques. Design drafts, solid models, and assembly and <b>production</b> <b>instructions</b> were created to assist and spur future production of these units. Detailed consumer and producer economic analysis of the unit was also performed. The cost of the approximately four foot wide by seven foot tall domestic heating unit to be produced, shipped, and installed is projected to be $ 1580 with current tax credits. Economic analysis yielded a payback period of 14 years and a 30 year return on investment of 130 % based on Louisville, KY weather and East Central United States utilities. A full-scale experimental heat pipe augmented solar wall was constructed {{as close as possible to}} the mass production design and was installed in a classroom at the University of Louisville.
