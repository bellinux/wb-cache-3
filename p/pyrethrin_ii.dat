5000|$|<b>Pyrethrin</b> <b>II</b> is {{an organic}} {{compound}} {{that is a}} potent insecticide. It {{is one of the}} two pyrethrins, the other being pyrethrin I. Thousands of tons this mixture are produced annually from chrysanthemum plants, which are cultivated in warm climates. [...] Whereas pyrethrin I is a derivative of (+)-trans-chrysanthemic acid, in <b>pyrethrin</b> <b>II</b> one methyl group is oxidized to a carboxymethyl group, the resulting core being called pyrethric acid. Knowledge of their chemical structures opened the way for the production of synthetic analogues, which are called pyrethroids.

40|$|In this paper, {{pyrethrin}} levels {{during a}} postharvest treatment on stored durum wheat were studied. Two experiments {{were carried out}} at single and double the dose recommended by the manufacturer. In all trials, the initial deposition of pyrethrins levels was below the fixed maximum residue level of 3 mg/kg. The fate of pyrethrins in the two experiments was similar, and the total content of pyrethrins remained unchanged for 22 days with a complete dissipation in 8 months. In the single dose experiment, half-life times of <b>pyrethrins</b> I and <b>II</b> were 46 and 72 days, while for the double dose, <b>pyrethrins</b> I and <b>II</b> were 41 and 53 days, respectively...|$|R
50|$|Chrysanthemic acid is {{an organic}} {{compound}} that {{is related to}} a variety of natural and synthetic insecticides. It is related to the <b>pyrethrin</b> I and <b>II,</b> as well as the pyrethroids. One of the four stereoisomers, (1R,3R)- or (+)-trans-chrysanthemic acid (pictured), is the acid part of the ester pyrethrin I, which occurs naturally in the seed cases of Chrysanthemum cinerariaefolium. Many synthetic pyrethroids, for example the allethrins, are esters of all four stereoisomers.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} pyrethoids {{are related}} to <b>pyrethrin</b> I and <b>II</b> by changing the alcohol group of the ester of chrysanthemic acid. This relatively modest change can lead to substantially altered activities. For example, the 5-benzyl-3-furanyl ester called resmethrin is only weakly toxic to mammals (LD50 (rat, oral) = 2,000 mg/kg) but is 20-50 times more effective than natural pyrethrum and is also readily biodegraded. Other commercially important esters include tetramethrin, allethrin, phenothrin, barthrin, dimethrin, and bioresmethrin. Another family of pyrethroids have altered acid fragment together with altered alcohol components. These require more elaborate organic synthesis. Members of this extensive class include the dichlorovinyl and dibromovinyl derivatives. Still others are tefluthrin, fenpropathrin, and bioethanomethrin.|$|R
50|$|Well {{after their}} use as {{insecticides}} began, their chemical structures {{were determined by}} Hermann Staudinger and Lavoslav Ružička in 1924. Pyrethrin I (CnH28O3) and <b>pyrethrin</b> <b>II</b> (CnH28O5) are structurally related esters with a cyclopropane core. Pyrethrin I is a derivative of (+)-trans-chrysanthemic acid. <b>Pyrethrin</b> <b>II</b> is closely related, but one methyl group is oxidized to a carboxymethyl group, the resulting core being called pyrethric acid. Knowledge of their structures {{opened the way for}} the production of synthetic analogues, which are called pyrethroids. Pyrethrins are classified as terpenoids. The key step in the biosynthesis of the naturally occurring pyrethrins involves two molecules of dimethylallyl pyrophosphate, which join to form a cyclopropane ring by the action of the enzyme chrysanthemyl diphosphate synthase.|$|E
50|$|Kadethrin is a {{synthetic}} pyrethroid with the chemical formula C23H24O4S {{which is used}} as an insecticide. It is the most potent knockdown pyrethroid (even stronger than <b>pyrethrin</b> <b>II)</b> but it is relatively unstable, especially when exposed to light (due to both the furan ring and the thiolactone group in the molecule).|$|E
50|$|Most of the world's {{supply of}} {{pyrethrin}} and C. cinerariaefolium comes from Kenya, which produces {{the most potent}} flowers. Other countries include Croatia (in Dalmatia) and Japan. The flower was first introduced into Kenya and the highlands of Eastern Africa during the late 1920s. Since the 2000s, Kenya has produced about 70% of the world's supply of pyrethrum. A substantial amount of the flowers is cultivated by small-scale farmers who depend on it {{as a source of}} income. It is a major source of export income for Kenya and source of over 3,500 additional jobs. About 23,000 tons were harvested in 1975. The active ingredients are extracted with organic solvents to give a concentrate containing the six types of pyrethrins: pyrethrin I, <b>pyrethrin</b> <b>II,</b> cinerin I, cinerin II, jasmolin I, and jasmolin II.|$|E
50|$|Pyrethroids were {{introduced}} {{by a team}} of Rothamsted Research scientists following the elucidation of the structures of <b>pyrethrin</b> I and <b>II</b> by Hermann Staudinger and Leopold Ružička in the 1920s. The pyrethroids represented a major advancement in the chemistry that would synthesize the analog of the natural version found in pyrethrum. Its insecticidal activity has relatively low mammalian toxicity and an unusually fast biodegradation. Their development coincided with the identification of problems with DDT use. Their work consisted firstly of identifying the most active components of pyrethrum, extracted from East African chrysanthemum flowers and long known to have insecticidal properties. Pyrethrum rapidly knocks down flying insects but has negligible persistence — which is good for the environment but gives poor efficacy when applied in the field. Pyrethroids are essentially chemically stabilized forms of natural pyrethrum and belong to IRAC MoA group 3 (they interfere with sodium transport in insect nerve cells).|$|R
40|$|The use of botanical {{insecticides}} is in today’s world {{an attractive}} {{alternative to the}} less safe and environmentally malign synthetic chemicals, whose overall longer persistence in the environment does not only make them more contaminant, but also increases their chances of causing a rapid development of resistance in the target pest and having negative-side effects on beneficial organisms. Yet, at present {{only a handful of}} botanical products are in commercial use for insect control on crops. Among the most important botanical insecticides (pyrethrins, rotenone, neem and essential oils), pyrethrins have the longest history of effective use against a wide range of insects and best record of low toxicity to mammals. Although pyrethrins were relegated from their once prominent position in the mid- 1930 ’s, the recent market trends towards “reduced risk” pesticides and host plant resistance have brought pyrethrins back to the attention and initiated the generation of knowledge around them. Pyrethrins refer to an oleoresin extracted from the dried daisy-like flowers of pyrethrum (Tanacetum cinerariifolium). The active constituents are six esters formed by a combination of two acids (chrysanthemic acid and pyrethric acid) and three alcohols (pyrethrolone, cinerolone and jasmolone, collectively called rethrolones). The esters of chrysanthemic acid with the rethrolones constitute type I pyrethrins, whereas the esters of pyrethric acid are collectively known as type <b>II</b> <b>pyrethrins.</b> Apart from being the source of pyrethrins, pyrethrum also produces a range of other defense compounds collectively known as sesquiterpene lactones, which have also been implicated in plant defense against herbivores, pathogens, and competing plant species. Although pyrethrins and sesquiterpene lactones are found throughout the whole plant, the highest concentrations of both types of compounds are found in the achenes of the flowers, which are densely covered with glandular trichomes. GC-MS analysis revealed that trichomes of mature achenes contain sesquiterpene lactones and other secondary metabolites, but no pyrethrins. Although glandular trichomes were known to participate in the production of mono- and sesquiterpene compounds that were stored in or emitted from the subcuticular cavity just outside the apical cells, here we demonstrate that basipetal secretion can also occur. In pyrethrum, the monoterpene-derived portion of pyrethrins, chrysanthemic acid (CA), is translocated from the trichomes to the pericarp, where it is esterified into pyrethrins that accumulate in the intercellular space. We also show that during seed maturation, pyrethrins stored in the pericarp are absorbed by the developing embryo, and that during seed germination these embryo-stored pyrethrins are recruited by the germinating seedling, which, {{due to the lack of}} trichomes, cannot produce defense compounds themselves. At early stages, not only sesquiterpene lactones that diffuse to the soil from the seed coat, but also the pyrethrins found in the seedlings, seem to play a more important role as antimicrobials than as insecticides. Although there has been considerable progress on the chemistry of pyrethrins, the molecular/biochemical basis of their biosynthesis was largely unknown. The acid and alcohol moieties of pyrethrins derive from distinct pathways. Whereas the alcohol portion is believed to be derived from linolenic acid and share a large part of its biosynthetic pathway with jasmonic acid, the acid moieties are monoterpenes with a cyclopropane ring that are supposed to be derived from an irregular monoterpene pathway. Before the start  of this project, only one enzyme, chrysanthemyl diphosphate synthase (TcCDS), had been isolated and demonstrated to catalyze the first step in the biosynthesis of the acid portion of pyrethrins, which consist of the condensation of two molecules of DMAPP to produce chrysanthemol (COH) via chrysanthemyl diphosphate. During this project an additional acyltransferase enzyme (TcGLIP) was isolated by another group and demonstrated to be responsible for the esterification of (1 R, 3 R) -chrysanthemoyl-CoA and (S) -pyrethrolone, one of the last steps in the biosynthesis of pyrethrins, which was demonstrated in this thesis to likely take place in the pericarp. To identify additional genes of the pyrethrin biosynthetic pathway, we generated three EST libraries derived from ovaries, trichomes and leaves. Gene candidates were obtained either by keyword interrogation of the annotated contigs or by blasting the libraries with known genes catalyzing similar reactions in other plants. Given the likelihood of cytochrome P 450 s as potential candidates to catalyze the missing steps in the biosynthesis of the acid moiety of pyrethrins, the pyrethrum EST libraries, were first interrogated for genes encoding cytochrome P 450 (CYP) enzymes with a developmental expression pattern similar to TcCDS, and a specific expression in CA-producing glandular trichomes. Experiments with yeast microsomes allowed the selection of two enzymes capable of converting COH into chrysanthemal. Although after agro-infiltration none of these enzymes affected the background level of CA, one of them (Ct 21854) resulted in a strong reduction of COH emission, which correlates with a significantly higher amounts of a CA conjugate, confirming that Ct 21854 qualifies as a chrysanthemic acid synthase efficiently converting COH into CA. Rethrolones have been proposed to originate from linolenic acid and share part of the oxylipin pathway with jasmonic acid, which in turns implies that one of the first committed steps should involve a lipoxygenase enzyme, catalyzing the hydroperoxidation of linolenic acid at position 13 of the hydrocarbon chain. Based on this assumption the pyrethrum EST libraries were interrogated for genes encoding LOX enzymes. The expression patterns of twenty-five lipoxygenase EST contigs were characterized, and the ones with a developmental regulation similar to TcCDS and TcGLIP were selected. Subsequently, the molecular cloning of a lipoxygenase, TcLOX 1, was carried out.  Recombinant TcLOX 1 was demonstrated to catalyze the peroxidation of the linolenic acid substrate at the C 13    position. The gene shares the developmental and trichome-specific  expression pattern with TcCDS, suggesting that a trichome production and translocation could be operating for the alcohol moiety of pyrethrins as well. Finally, besides pyrethrins, pyrethrum plants are also a source of sesquiterpene lactones. Even though considerable information on bioactivity and industrial significance of pyrethrum sesquiterpene lactones is available, the localization and biosynthetic origins were largely unknown. Like in other species of the Asteraceae family, pyrethrum sesquiterpene lactones are exclusively stored in trichomes and it is shown that germacratrien- 12 -oic acid (GAA) is most likely the central precursor of all known sesquiterpene lactones found in pyrethrum. Candidate genes implicated in the first two committed steps leading from farnesyl diphosphate to GAA were retrieved from the pyrethrum trichome EST library, cloned, and characterized in yeast and in planta. Furthermore, a gene encoding an enzyme capable of catalyzing the C 6 hydroxylation of GAA was characterized. This hydroxylation results in spontaneous lactonization likely resulting in the putatively identified C 6 -C 7 -costunolide-derived STLs in pyrethrum. However, the enzyme may also catalyze the hydroxylation at the C 6 position of the lactonized precursor of all reported C 7 -C 8 -type STLs. In conclusion, the work compiled in this thesis presents new insights into the participation of pyrethrum trichomes in the biosynthesis and selective trafficking of pyrethrins precursors and STLs in opposite directions, and contributes to understanding the role of these flower-stored secondary metabolites in the immunization of the next generation against insect and fungal pathogens. Moreover, this study makes an important contribution towards understanding the biochemical and molecular bases of pyrethrins and STLs, the two most relevant bioactive compounds found in pyrethrum...|$|R

40|$|Dalmatian {{pyrethrum}} (Tanacetum cinerariifolium /Trevir. / Sch. Bip.) is {{a perennial}} herbaceous plant {{belonging to the}} Asteraceae family. It is endemic to the East coast of the Adriatic Sea and its natural habitat extends from Italy to northern Albania and up in the mountainous regions of Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro. Pyrethrum flowers yield an important insecticide, the pyrethrin. Pyrethrin is mainly concentrated in oil glands {{on the surface of}} the seed inside the tightly packed flower head, but they can also be found in the other plant parts, however in much lower concentrations. The pyrethrin exist as a combination of six insecticide active ingredients: pyrethrin I, cinerin I, jasmolin I, <b>pyrethrin</b> <b>II,</b> cinerin II and jasmolin II, with pyrethrin I and <b>pyrethrin</b> <b>II</b> present in higher concentrations. Pyrethrin is non-toxic to mammals and other worm-blooded animals, it is unstable in light, oxygen, water and at elevated temperatures and therefore highly biodegradable. Due to the fact it is environmentally safe it is leading insecticide in organic farming systems. The most scientific work concerning Dalmatian pyrethrum was focused on its morphological and biochemical traits that are relevant in breeding. Breeding programmes are primarily focused on increasing the yield of pyrethrin per unit area. Relative to dry flower weight, flower heads contain the majority of the pyrethrin. Croatian wild populations contain approximately 0. 60 to 0. 79 %, while clones in breeding programmes of Australia and Kenya contain up to 3. 0 % of pyrethrin...|$|E

In this work, a rapid and sensitive LC–(ESI) -MS/MS method has been developed for the individual quantification and confirmation of pyrethrin residues in fruit and vegetable samples by monitoring two specific transitions for each pyrethrin component under Selected Reaction Monitoring (SRM) mode. Samples were extracted with acetone/water or acetone, depending on the sample type, and raw extracts were directly injected in the LC–MS/MS system. Method validation was carried out evaluating linearity, accuracy, precision, specificity, limit of quantification (LOQ) and limit of detection (LOD) in eight types of fruit and vegetable samples at 0. 05 mg/kg and 0. 5 mg/kg (referred to {{the sum of all}} pyrethrins). The method based on acetone/water (70 : 30) extraction led to satisfactory recoveries (70 – 110 %) and good precision (below 14 %) for all pyrethrin components in lettuce, pepper, strawberry and potato. The method based on acetone extraction allowed satisfactory recoveries for lettuce, cucumber, tomato and rice samples with recoveries between 71 and 107 % and RSDs below 15 %. For pistachio samples, satisfactory results were obtained only for some analytes and extracts were also injected using APCI interface, but the lower sensitivity achieved allowed only the validation at 0. 5 mg/kg.

40|$|This thesis {{examined}} the {{supercritical carbon dioxide}} (CO 2) extraction (SFE) of targeted secondary metabolites from selected natural products. Phytochemical characterization and determination of biological efficacy was completed using advanced analytical methods and in-vivo bio-assays. More than 500 SFE extracts were generated and characterized. Sample preparation (particle size, moisture content) and extraction parameters (pressure, temperature and flow rate) were investigated {{and the ability of}} SFE to extract specific biosynthetic classes of compounds was evaluated. Where warranted, pilot scale studies were conducted for larger scale biological trials. SFE of the neotropical vine, Souroubea sympetala, a traditional medicine used for a culture bound syndrome related to anxiety, resulted in an extract rich in betulinic acid (5. 54 +/- 0. 24 mg/g) determined by HPLC-APCI/MS. When subjected to validated rodent anxiety behavioral assays (e. g. elevated plus maze (EPM)) the SFE extract demonstrated significant anxiolysis (anti-anxiety) compared to the vehicle control, with a 50 % increase in time spent in open arms and a 73 % increase in unprotected head dips observed. The significant in-vivo anxiolysis observed provides scientific support for the ethnobotanical use of this traditional medicine and a promising lead for a natural health product (NHP) to treat anxiety. Systematic variation of SFE parameters (pressure and temperature) on pyrethrum (Chrysanthemum cinerariifolium) oleoresin, a natural insecticide, resulted in a residue free pyrethrin concentrate, suitable for organic agricultural applications. The highest pyrethrin concentration (0. 531 g/g) and highest ratio of pyrethrins I (pyrethrin I, cinerin I, jasmolin I) to pyrethrins II (<b>pyrethrin</b> <b>II,</b> cinerin II, jasmolin I) (PI:PII = 1. 95) was obtained at 40 °C; 10 MPa while 40 °C; 30 MPa produced the lowest pyrethrin concentration (0. 436 g/g) and lowest ratio of PI:PII (1. 87). Total pyrethrin recovery was highest at 40 °C; 30 MPa (8. 39 g pyrethrins) vs. 40 °C; 10 MPa (6. 96 g pyrethrins). The insecticidal activity of the SFE extracts of the pyrethrum oleoresin was confirmed (> 70 % mortality at 48 h) using the Colorado potato beetle (CPB) a major pest of agriculture. SFE of piperamides from black pepper (Piper nigrum), a promising botanical insecticide and synergist, was successful at pressures above 30 MPa and temperatures greater than 50 ˙C with total yields greater than 7. 87 % (CV < 0. 10) and piperamide concentrations greater than 150 mg/g (CV < 6. 0). Flow rate, sample size, and particle size were optimized at 5 L/min, 10 g, and 1 mm mesh respectively. Insecticidal activity corroborated dose dependent piperamide bioactivity. Extract from 10 MPa; 60 °C (42. 38 mg/g) produced 10. 0 +/- 6. 8 (24 h) and 13. 3 +/- 6. 7 % (48 h) mortality. Extract from 35 MPa; 40 °C (148. 56 mg/g) produced 70. 0 +/- 10. 0 (24 h) and 73. 3 +/- 8. 4 % (48 h) mortality. Northern shrimp (Pandelus borealis) by-products extracted by SFE (35 MPa; 40 °C) generated a deep red oil rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), specifically eicosapentaenoic acid EPA (7. 8 +/- 0. 06 %) and docosahexaenoic acid DHA (8. 0 +/- 0. 07 %). Optimization of pressure (60 MPa), temperature (80 °C), moisture (13 %), particle size (0. 85 mm), and flow rate (9 L/min) resulted in a more efficient extraction without significantly changing concentrations of EPA and DHA. Pilot scale studies confirmed experimental data and supports further investigation of commercial production of an omega - 3 (o- 3) concentrate from Northern shrimp by-products...|$|E
40|$|Tropical {{parasitic}} {{diseases such as}} malaria, human African trypanosomiasis, chagas disease, and leishmaniasis affect {{hundreds of millions of}} people worldwide and have devastating consequences. Current drugs available to treat these diseases have serious drawbacks. New drugs are urgently needed. Natural products (NPs) play a dominant role in drug discovery for the treatment of human diseases. Particularly, quinine and artemisinin have their origin in nature and have inspired successful drugs for malaria treatment. In a medium throughput screening, a total of 507 extracts from South African plants were assayed for their antiprotozoal activity against Plasmodium falciparum, Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense, Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania donovani. Extracts from Abrus precatorius L. ssp. africanus Verdc. (Fabaceae) and Drypetes gerrardii Hutch. var. gerrardii (Putranjivaceae) inhibited at least one of the parasites at a test concentration considered relevant. With the aim of identifying the compounds responsible for these activities, a HPLC-based activity profiling approach followed by dereplication was applied. Targeted isolation of promising compounds was achieved by a combination of chromatography techniques. Structure elucidation was achieved by HR-ESI-MS and NMR (1 H, 13 C, COSY, HMBC, HSQC, and NOESY spectroscopy). Absolute configuration was determined by comparison of electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectra with calculated ECD data. HPLC-based activity profiling of A. precatorius allowed the identification of abruquinones, as responsible for the trypanocidal activity of the crude extract. A total of ten abruquinones were isolated. Among these were five new compounds. Abruquinone B, I, A, D, K, and L showed remarkable inhibition (0. 16 ± 0. 060, 0. 28 ± 0. 051, 0. 02 ± 0. 003, 0. 01 ± 0. 001, 0. 11 ± 0. 053, and 0. 02 ± 0. 053, respectively) and notable selectivity, expressed as selectivity indices (SIs) which were calculated from cytotoxicity data in L- 6 cells (51, 74, 1379, 668, 508, and 374, respectively). These results warrant in vivo assessment of abruquinones. Abruquinones are promising hits due to their strong and selective in vitro inhibition of T. b. rhodesiense, their good compliance with Lipinski’s “rule-of- 5 ” and other molecular properties, as well as their predicted low/moderate toxic potential. Two different extracts of D. gerrardii showed antiprotozoal activity, and the active constituents were tracked and isolated by HPLC-based activity profiling. The CH 2 Cl 2 /MeOH (1 : 1) stems extract inhibited L. donovani and P. falciparum. The major compound, a new phenanthrenone, showed good in vitro activity (IC 50 of 0. 9 ? 0. 3 mM) and selectivity (SI of 68) against P. falciparum. Based on these promising results, in-vivo studies were conducted. However, the compound was not able to reduce parasitemia in the P. berghei mouse model. A phenanthrenone heterodimer was also isolated and showed in vitro antiplasmodial activity (IC 50 of 2. 04 ? 0. 15 mM and SI of 31). Furthermore, the CH 2 Cl 2 /MeOH (1 : 1) leaves extract displayed trypanocidal properties, and the known saponin putranoside A was isolated and tested against T. b. rhodesiense, (IC 50 of 18. 0 ? 3. 8 mM and a SI of 4). The phenanthrenone was the most active and selective in vitro inhibitor of P. falciparum, but showed no inhibition in vivo against P. berghei. However, the compound fulfilled Lipinski’s “rule-of- 5 ” and other molecular properties, which indicates a potential to meet requirements of an ideal antimalarial drug such as, oral bioavailability and blood-brain barrier permeability. According to Medicines for Malaria Venture compound progressing criteria, the phenanthrenone complies with some of the features of a validated hit such as sufficient activity against P. falciparum in vitro (? 1 ?M). Additionally, as part of a project aimed at investigating antiprotozoal European plants Chrysanthemum cynerariifolium (Trevir.) Vis. (Asteraceae), Laurus nobilis L. (Lauraceae), and Eupatorium cannabinum L. (Asteraceae) were studied. A hexane extract of C. cynerariifolium showed promising activity against P. falciparum. Pyrethrins (irregular monoterpenes) were the metabolites responsible for the antiplasmodial activities. Particularly, <b>pyrethrin</b> <b>II</b> and jasmolin II inhibited P. falciparum (IC 50 4. 0 ? 1. 1 ?M and 5. 0 ? 0. 4 ?M, respectively and SI of 24 and 6, respectively) in vitro. Synthetic pyrethroids were also tested, but they did not show activity. Finally, as a contribution to the structure activity relationship study of sesquiterpene lactones showing activity against T. b. rhodesiense, costunolide and zaluzanin D were isolated from Laurus nobilis L. (Lauraceae) and eupatoriopicrin from Eupatorium cannabinum L. (Asteraceae). Germacrolides, i. e. costunolide and eupatoriopicrin, showed a higher inhibition (IC 50 of 1. 3 ? 0. 4 mM and 1. 2 ± 0. 2 mM, respectively) on the protozoon, than the guaianolide zaluzanin D (IC 50 of 10. 8 mM). In brief, a total of 22 secondary metabolites were isolated from five species. Among them, seven new compounds were discovered. These compounds belong to the structural classes of isoflavonoids, phenanthrenones, and terpenes such as, sesquiterpene lactones, irregular monoterpenes and triterpenoid saponins. Most of them (15 compounds) exhibited in vitro antiprotozoal activity. The most promising compounds were the abruquinones and the phenanthrenone, which strongly and selectively inhibited T. b. rhodesiense and P. falciparum, respectively. Abruquinones and the phenanthrenone are drug-like compounds with a calculated toxic potential ranging from low to moderate. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Tropische parasitäre Krankheiten wie Malaria, afrikanische Trypanosomiasis (Schlafkrankheit), Chagas-Krankheit und Leishmaniose betreffen Hunderte von Millionen Menschen weltweit und haben verheerenden Folgen. Aktuelle Medikamente, die zur Behandlung dieser Krankheiten zur Verfügung stehen, haben gravierende Nachteile. Neue Medikamente werden dringend benötigt. Naturstoffe (NP) spielen eine dominierende Rolle in der Wirkstoffforschung für die Behandlung von menschlichen Erkrankungen. So haben Chinin und Artemisin ihren Ursprung in der Natur und führten zu erfolgreichen Medikamenten zur Malariabehandlung. In einem mittleren Durchsatz-Screening wurden insgesamt 507 Extrakte von südafrikanischen Pflanzen auf ihre Aktivität gegen Protozoen - Plasmodium falciparum, Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense, Trypanosoma cruzi und Leishmania donovani - getestet. Extrakte von Abrus precatorius L. ssp. africanus Verdc. (Fabaceae) und Drypetes gerrardii Hutch. var. gerrardii (Putranjivaceae) haben mindestens einen der Parasiten in einer als relevant bezeichneten Testkonzentration gehemmt. Mit dem Ziel die für diese Aktivitäten verantwortlichen Verbindungen zu identifizieren wurde ein Ansatz bestehend aus HPLC-basiertes Aktivitäts-Profiling gefolgt von Dereplikation verwendet. Gezielte Isolierung der vielversprechenden Verbindungen erfolgte durch eine Kombination von Chromatographie-Techniken. Die Strukturaufklärung wurde durch HR-ESI-MS und NMR (1 H, 13 C, COSY, HMBC, HSQC, und NOESY Spektroskopie) durchgeführt. Die absolute Konfiguration wurde durch den Vergleich der elektronischen Zirkulardichroismus-(ECD) -Spektren mit berechneten ECD-Daten bestimmt. HPLC-basiertes Aktivitäts-Profiling von A. precatorius ermöglichte die Identifizierung von Abruquinonen, als verantwortliche Substanzen für die trypanozide Aktivität des Rohextrakts. Es wurden insgesamt 10 Abruquinone isoliert, darunter fünf neue Verbindungen. Abruquinone B, I, A, D, K und L zeigten bemerkenswerte Hemmung (0. 16 ± 0. 060, 0. 28 ± 0. 051, 0. 02 ± 0. 003, 0. 01 ± 0. 001, 0. 11 ± 0. 053, und 0. 02 ± 0. 053) und beachtenswerte Selektivität, wiedergegeben als Selektivitätsindizes (SIs) die aus der Zytotoxizität in L- 6 Zellen (51, 74, 1379, 668, 508, und 374) ermittelt wurden. Wegen ihrer starken und selektiven in vitro Hemmung von T. b. rhodesiense, ihrer guten Übereinstimmung mit Lipinski’s „ 5 er Regel“ und anderen molekularen Eigenschaften, sowie ihrem niederen/mässigen toxischen Potenzial sind Abruquinone vielversprechende Hits. Deshalb sind weitere Studien notwendig um botanische oder chemische Quellen sicherzustellen und die in-vivo Wirksamkeit dieser Verbindungen zu bestimmen. Zwei verschiedene Extrakte von D. gerrardii zeigten Aktivität gegen Protozoen. Die aktiven Bestandteile wurden mit Hilfe vom HPLC-basiertem Aktivitäts-Profiling identifiziert und isoliert. Der CH 2 Cl 2 /MeOH (1 : 1) Extrakt aus den Stängeln hemmte L. donovani und P. falciparum. Die Hauptverbindung, ein neues Phenanthrenon, zeigte gute in vitro Aktivität (IC 50 von 0. 9 ? 0. 3 mM) und Selektivität (SI von 68) gegen P. falciparum. Basierend auf diesen vielversprechenden Resultaten wurden in vivo Studien durchgeführt. Allerdings war diese Verbindung nicht in der Lage die Parasitenbelastung im P. berghei Mausmodell zu reduzieren. Es wurde ebenfalls ein Phenanthrenon-Heterodimer isoliert, der in vitro Aktivität gegen Plasmodien (IC 50 von 2. 04 ? 0. 15 mM und SI von 31) aufwies. Ausserdem zeigte der CH 2 Cl 2 /MeOH (1 : 1) Blattextrakt ausgewiesene trypanozidale Eigenschaften. Aus diesem Extrakt wurde das bekannte Saponin Putranoside A isoliert und gegen T. b. rhodesiense, (IC 50 von 18. 0 ? 3. 8 mM und SI von 4) getestet. Das Phenanthrenon war der aktivste und selektivste in vitro Inhibitor von P. falciparum, zeigte jedoch keine Hemmung in vivo gegen P. berghei. Die Verbindung erfüllte jedoch Lipinski’s „ 5 er Regel“ und andere molekulare Eigenschaften, wie orale Bioverfügbarkeit und Durchlässigkeit der Blut-Hirn-Schranke, was ein mögliches Potenzial aufzeigt den Anforderungen eines idealen Antimalariawirkstoffs gerecht zu werden. Nach „Medicines for Malaria Venture“-Kriterien für die weitere Entwicklung eines Wirkstoffs erfüllt das Phenanthrenon einige der Merkmale eines validierten Hits wie ausreichende in vitro Aktivität gegen P. falciparum (? 1 ?M). Als weiterer Teil des Projekts wurde die Wirkung von europäischen Heilpflanzen Chrysanthemum cynerariifolium (Trevir.) Vis. (Asteraceae), Laurus nobilis L. (Lauraceae), und Eupatorium cannabinum L. (Asteraceae) gegen Protozoen studiert. Ein Hexan-Extrakt von C. cynerariifolium zeigte vielversprechende Aktivität gegen P. falciparum. Phyrethrine (unregelmässige Monoterpene) waren die Inhaltsstoffe verantwortlich für die antiplasmodiale Aktivität. Besonders <b>Pyrethrin</b> <b>II</b> und Jasmolin II hemmten P. falciparum (IC 50 4. 0 ? 1. 1 ?M und 5. 0 ? 0. 4 ?M, und SI von 24 und 6) in vitro. Es wurden auch synthetische Pyrethroide getestet, sie zeigten aber keine Aktivität. Schliesslich, als Beitrag zu den Struktur-Aktivitätsuntersuchungen von Sesquiterpenlactonen mit Aktivität gegen T. b. rhodesiense, wurden Costunolid und Zaluzanin D aus Laurus nobilis L. (Lauraceae) und Eupatoriopicrin aus Eupatorium cannabinum L. (Asteraceae) isoliert. Germacrolides, d. h. Costunolid und Eupatoriopicrin, zeigten eine höhere Hemmung (IC 50 von 1. 3 ? 0. 4 mM und 1. 2 ± 0. 2 mM) auf Protozoen als das Guaianolid Zaluzanin D (IC 50 von 10. 8 mM). Es wurden insgesamt 22 Sekundärmetaboliten aus fünf Arten isoliert, darunter sieben neue Verbindungen. Diese Substanzen gehören zu den Strukturklassen der Isoflavonoide, Phenanthrenone und Terpene einschliesslich Sesquiterpenelactone, unregelmässige Monoterpene und Triterpenoidsaponine. Die meisten von ihnen (15 Verbindungen) zeigten in vitro Aktivität gegen Protozoen. Die vielversprechendsten Verbindungen waren die Abruquinone und das Phenanthrenon, die starke und selektive Hemmung gegen T. b. rhodesiense und P. falciparum zeigten. Abruquinone und das Phenanthrenon sind drug-like Verbindungen mit einem rechnerischen toxischen Potential von gering bis mässig. ...|$|E
