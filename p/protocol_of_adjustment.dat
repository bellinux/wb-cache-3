40|$|INTRODUCTION: Treat-to-target (T 2 T) {{strategies}} using a <b>protocol</b> <b>of</b> pre-defined <b>adjustments</b> <b>of</b> disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) {{according to}} disease activity improve outcomes {{for patients with}} rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, successful implementation may be limited by deviations from the <b>protocol.</b> The aim <b>of</b> {{this study was to}} determine the prevalence <b>of</b> <b>protocol</b> deviation, explore the reasons and identify subsets of patients in whom treatment protocols are more difficult to follow. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, treatment-naïve patients with RA of less than one year's duration, attending a dedicated early arthritis clinic between 2001 and 2013, were followed for three years from initiation of combination therapy with conventional DMARDs which was subsequently modified according to a T 2 T protocol. At each clinic visit, whether deviation from the protocol occurred, the type of deviation and the reasons for deviation were assessed. The relationship between protocol deviations and baseline variables was determined using linear regression analysis. RESULTS: In total, 198 patients contributed 3, 654 clinic visits. The prevalence <b>of</b> <b>protocol</b> deviations was 24. 5 % and deviation in at least at one clinic visit was experienced by 90. 4 % of patients. The median time to first deviation was 30 weeks. Continuing existing treatment rather than intensifying therapy was the most common type of deviation (59. 9 %). Patient and physician related factors were the most common reasons for deviation, each accounting for 24. 7 % of deviations, followed by toxicities (23. 3 %) and comorbidities (20. 0 %). The prevalence <b>of</b> <b>protocol</b> deviations was lower among patients who achieved remission after three years (13. 1 %; 162 deviations out of 1, 228 visits) compared with those who were not in remission (30. 9 %; 523 / 1692) (P< 0. 0001). On multivariate analysis, only body mass index (P= 0. 003) and helplessness score (P= 0. 04) were independent predictors <b>of</b> <b>protocol</b> deviations although the predictive power of the model was not strong (R 2 = 0. 17). CONCLUSIONS: Deviation from a T 2 T protocol occurred in one quarter of visits, indicating that applying the T 2 T approach is feasible in clinical practice. Failure to escalate dose when indicated was commonly encountered, and just under half of the observed deviations were related to either toxicities or comorbidities and were therefore justifiable on clinical grounds.

40|$|An {{empirical}} {{protocol for}} dosage adjustment in warfarin therapy was evaluated {{by means of}} retrospective analysis of the medical records of 106 outpatients at an anticoagulation clinic followed from January 1981 to August 1984. There were 203 {{cases in which the}} prothrombin time was abnormal (below the therapeutic range in 123 cases and above the range in 80). The protocol was successful in about 60 % of cases in which the prothrombin time before dosage adjustment was below the therapeutic range and in 80 % of cases in which it was above the range. Statistical analysis showed that the success rate could be improved by more precise definition of the percentage of dosage change in certain situations. However, individual variation in response of the prothrombin time to a standard dosage change limits the success that can be expected after the initial adjustment.

Our results suggest that the speed <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> for the 3 -month deposit rate is higher when the monetary policy rate falls. Conversely, the speed <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> for the 3 -month lending rate is higher when monetary policy rate increases. More specifically, the speed <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> for positive deviations is 1.5 times the one for negative deviations in the case of deposit rates, suggesting that negative deviations are more persistent, whereas the speed <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> for negative deviations is two times the one for positive deviations in the case of lending rates, suggesting that positive deviations are more persistent.|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} contains three essays that {{explore the}} speed <b>of</b> <b>adjustment,</b> volatility and {{noise in the}} Indonesia Stock Exchange. The first essay explores the speed <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> in the Indonesia Stock Exchange at daily interval from 2000 to 2004. The model employed is the speed <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> with noise. Firstly, I work on the estimation of the speed <b>of</b> <b>adjustment.</b> The estimated speed <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> coefficient concludes that the large size leads the smaller size group to adjust to new information. Secondly, I analyse the component in the noise that contributes significantly to the speed <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> level. It is confirmed that the factor determining the noise is bid-ask fluctuations. Therefore, {{it is reasonable to}} infer the component in the noise from bid-ask component. The decomposition of bid-ask spread into transaction cost and asymmetric information reveals that the latter is found to be a significant component determining the speed <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> level. The second essay analyses the fine grain dynamics of the speed <b>of</b> price <b>adjustment</b> to new information from 2000 to 2007. The exact time <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> is estimated at intraday frequency instead of at daily frequency. In this work, as an alternative of first moment estimation, second moment model-free estimation using volatility signature plot to estimate of the speed <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> is proposed. Both first and second moment estimation of the speed <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> provide consistent result <b>of</b> 30 minute <b>adjustment</b> period. Negative relation after 5 -minute return interval between speed <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> estimate and realized variance is found implying lower noise leads to smaller deviation between observed and equilibrium price. In the third essay, I concentrate the work on the second moment of continuously compounded returns from 2000 to 2007 in the Indonesia Stock Exchange. The main purpose of the last essay is to estimate the noise and efficient variance in the Indonesia Stock Exchange. The realized variance based estimator is employed in the third essay. During the period of the study, noise variance decreases indicating smaller deviation between the observed and equilibrium price, hence improving market quality in the Indonesia Stock Exchange. The optimal frequency to estimate the efficient variance, on average, is nine minutes. The variance ratio of daily efficient variance to daily open-to-close reveals significant private information underlying price process in the Indonesia Stock Exchange...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Research {{has shown}} that {{individuals}} reporting a low level <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> latitude, defined as having few possibilities to temporarily adjust work demands to illness, have {{a higher risk of}} sick leave. To what extent lack <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> latitude influences the individual when making the decision to take sick leave is unknown. We hypothesize that ill individuals are more likely to take sick leave on days when they experience a lack <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> latitude at work than on days with access to adjustment latitude. Methods: A case-crossover design was applied to 546 sick-leave spells, extracted from a cohort of 1 430 employees at six Swedish workplaces, with a 3 - 12 month follow-up of all new sick-leave spells. Exposure to lack <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> latitude on the first sick-leave day was compared with exposure during several types of control periods sampled from the previous two months for the same individual. Results: Only 35 % of the respondents reported variations in access to adjustment latitude, and 19 % reported a constant lack <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> latitude during the two weeks prior to the sick-leave spell. Among those that did report variation, the risk of sick leave was lower on days with lack <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> latitude, than on days with access (Odds Ratio 0. 36, 95 % Confidence Interval 0. 25 - 0. 52). Conclusions: This is the first study to show the influence <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> latitude on the decision to take sick leave. Among those with variations in exposure, lack <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> latitude was a deterrent of sick leave, which is contrary to the a priori hypothesis. These results indicate that adjustment latitude may not only capture long-lasting effects of a flexible working environment, but also temporary possibilities to adjust work to being absent.

Having commented on basic dilemmas <b>of</b> contemporary <b>adjustment,</b> the author distinguished and discussed five basic types of the youths' participation in culture, determined according to the criterion of the level <b>of</b> social <b>adjustment.</b> The first (the lowest) level consists in participation in massand pop-culture in institutional frames, with the elements of revolt and individualism. A characteristic feature of the second level <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> is the past association with local cultural institutions and the present participation in cultural institutions of more universal character. A determinant of the third level <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> is cultural superficiality and syncretism. The essence of the fourth level <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> is the continuity of interests and the past participation in school extracurricular activities. Finaly, a characteristic symptom of the fifth (the highest) level <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> is the autotelic (in the past) and pragmatic (at present) character of the reading habit. The article ends with the confrontation <b>of</b> the <b>adjustment</b> levels with the character of the youths' participation in culture.

Most critics <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> programs say little about education directly and do not distinguish the effects <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> measures from the effects of internal recession, fiscal constraints, or structural problems. Early adjustment programs ignored education issues - but adjustment lasted longer than expected, so the Bank has broadened its approach to protect education from the negative effects <b>of</b> <b>adjustment.</b> Relevant data are scarce and of poor quality. The most common indicators - aggregate financing and enrollment indicators - are difficult to interpret.
