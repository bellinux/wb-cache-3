The authors {{present a}} {{preventive}} physiotherapy programme intended {{to improve the}} well-being of persons who have been {{blind or visually impaired}} since birth or experience partial or complete loss of vision later in life as a result of injury or disease. Methods. Different methods and techniques of <b>physiotherapy,</b> <b>kinesitherapy</b> and relaxation used in the rehabilitation of visually impaired persons are described. Results. The goals of timely physical treatment are to avoid unnecessary problems, such as improper posture, tension of the entire body, face and eyes, and deterioration of facial expression, that often accompany partial or complete loss of vision. Regular training improves functional skills, restores the skills that have been lost, and prevents the development of defects and consequent disorders of the locomotor apparatus. Conclusions. It is very difficult to change the life style and habits of blind and visually imapired persons. Especially elderly people who experience complete or partial loss of vision later in their lives are often left to their fate. Therefore blind and visually impaired persons of all age groups should be enrolled in a suitable rehabilitation programme that will improve the quality of their life. </p...|$|E
