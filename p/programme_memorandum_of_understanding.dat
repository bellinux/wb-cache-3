40|$|This Executive Summary is {{a summary}} of the author's Engineering Doctorate {{research}} and the application of that research. The Executive Summary has sufficient detail and description to be read independently from the other pieces of research, called submissions, to which this refers. In outline, the three areas of research arose from the three research programmes with which the author was closely involved. The first area of research involved the identification of critical success factors within customer-supplier relationships in the automotive industry. An extensive literature review was performed using Lamming's Lean Supply Model (1993) as a starting point. A number of gaps in the body of knowledge were identified and were grouped into five areas for the purpose of further research. One area was subsequently addressed as part of the second area of research. The second area of research was aimed at assisting small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) in their use of the internet to improve their performance. A means of assessing the effectiveness of the operations of the SMEs was a critical part of this programme. A new tool called the SME (Operations) Assessment Tool, (SOAT) was developed because it focused on key business processes as the basis for assessment instead of the more traditional financial analysis. Having developed SOAT within the specific research programme, it was applied to three SMEs as a test of the methodology as a more general tool. Feedback from the three SMEs and those within the research programme showed that SOAT was straightforward to apply. The third area of research allowed the author to develop his interest in customer supplier relationships, as this was seen to be the main focus of concern within companies within the <b>programme.</b> A <b>Memorandum</b> <b>of</b> <b>Understanding</b> and Intent (MUI) was developed and justified, but {{was in the process of}} being applied by other researchers...|$|R
40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{the main}} {{aspects of the}} Portuguese labour law reform compelled by the financial assistance <b>programme</b> (namely, the <b>Memorandum</b> <b>of</b> <b>Understanding</b> on Specific Economic Policy Conditionality signed by the Portuguese State, the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund) and its potential impact in terms of intergenerational justice. The key points of the labour law reform considered in this study concern wages, working time, termination of the employment contract and collective bargaining. As it will be explained, if {{on the one hand}} these reforms have led to a severe worsening of working conditions standards, on the other hand, they can also compromise classic principles of labour law such as the favor laboratoris principle and undermine intergenerational justice. Some of the measures breach international conventions ratified by Portugal, such as ILO Conventions and the Revised European Social Charter. Still, neither the Portuguese legislator, nor the Portuguese Courts have considered these international instruments. Nevertheless, there were some attempts to invoke the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, referring various questions to the Court of Justice that who refused to intervene, overlooking the European context in which these decisions were taken. In this situation, the main role was played by the Portuguese Constitutional Court, which declared unconstitutional some of the government measures for infringement of the principles of equality, proportionality, protection of trust, collective bargaining and local administration autonomy. Recent studies show a huge social impact of the adjustment programme in terms of equality and poverty in Portugal and supported the controversial decisions of the current left wing government to reverse some of the reforms, with some apparently (debatable) positive economic effects. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
