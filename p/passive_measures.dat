25|$|Preventative {{measures}} {{are employed in}} areas where avalanches pose a significant threat to people, such as ski resorts, mountain towns, roads, and railways. There {{are several ways to}} prevent avalanches and lessen their power and destruction; active preventative measures reduce the likelihood and size of avalanches by disrupting the structure of the snowpack, while <b>passive</b> <b>measures</b> reinforce and stabilize the snowpack in situ. The simplest active measure is repeatedly traveling on a snowpack as snow accumulates; this can be by means of boot-packing, ski-cutting, or machine grooming. Explosives are used extensively to prevent avalanches, by triggering smaller avalanches that break down instabilities in the snowpack, and removing overburden that can result in larger avalanches. Explosive charges are delivered by a number of methods including hand-tossed charges, helicopter-dropped bombs, Gazex concussion lines, and ballistic projectiles launched by air cannons and artillery. Passive preventive systems such as snow fences and light walls can be used to direct the placement of snow. Snow builds up around the fence, especially the side that faces the prevailing winds. Downwind of the fence, snow buildup is lessened. This is caused by the loss of snow at the fence that would have been deposited and the pickup of the snow that is already there by the wind, which was depleted of snow at the fence. When there is a sufficient density of trees, they can greatly reduce the strength of avalanches. They hold snow in place and when there is an avalanche, the impact of the snow against the trees slows it down. Trees can either be planted or they can be conserved, such as in the building of a ski resort, to reduce the strength of avalanches.|$|E
2500|$|Northern pike {{are also}} a problem in Holter Lake. [...] The fish has long been present in small numbers in the lake, where it consumes more {{desirable}} native species like burbot, brown trout, and cuttrout trout. In March 2011, the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks (FWP) set no limit {{on the number of}} northern pike anglers may take from Holter Lake and the waters just above it. A month later, the agency said it had completed an environmental assessment of a plan to remove northern pike from the Missouri River and its feeder streams. The agency sought public comment on the plan, which it said would take three to five years to complete at a cost of $20,000. The agency intended to use nets and [...] "passive" [...] fish traps to remove the pike, but might employ [...] "active" [...] measure like electric fishing, gill netting, or trap netting if the <b>passive</b> <b>measures</b> were not effective. In April 2011, the FWP removed all fishing limits on northern pike from the headwaters of the Missouri River to Holter Dam in order to encourage fishermen to eradicate the species. In March 2012, the state began a project to eradicate all northern pike from the headwaters of the Madison, Gallatin, and Jefferson rivers to Holter Dam on the Missouri River.|$|E
2500|$|To ensure {{survivability}} to {{and effectiveness}} against a target, the LRASM {{is equipped with}} a BAE Systems-designed seeker and guidance system, integrating jam-resistant GPS/INS, passive RF and threat warning receiver, an imaging infrared (IIR infrared homing) seeker with automatic scene/target matching recognition, a data-link, and passive Electronic Support Measure (ESM) and radar warning receiver sensors. [...] Artificial intelligence software combines these features to locate enemy ships and avoid neutral shipping in crowded areas. [...] Automatic dissemination of emissions data is classified, located, and identified for path of attack; the data-link allows other assets to feed the missile a real-time electronic picture of the enemy battlespace. [...] Multiple missiles can work together to share data to coordinate an attack in a swarm. [...] Aside from short, low-power data-link transmissions, the LRASM does not emit signals, which combined with the low-RCS JASSM airframe and low IR signature reduces detectability. [...] Unlike previous radar-only seeker-equipped missiles that went on to hit other vessels if diverted or decoyed, the multi-mode seeker ensures the correct target is hit in a specific area of the ship. [...] An LRASM can find its own target autonomously by using its active radar homing to locate ships in an area, then using <b>passive</b> <b>measures</b> once on terminal approach. [...] Like the JASSM, the LRASM is capable of hitting land targets.|$|E

40|$|The {{automotive}} industry {{is facing the}} problem {{more and more of}} reducing the weight of vehicles but guaranteeing an equivalent level of comfort in terms of noise, vibration and harshness (NVH). To overcome these contradicting requirements traditional design and material choices must be revisited. Besides advanced passive material systems active or smart concepts are being increasingly considered for the NVH optimization of vehicles. Therefore, this chapter addresses different <b>passive</b> and active <b>measures</b> for NVH control with a focus on smart structures. After a general discussion of the NVH problems in automotive engineering, some principle <b>passive</b> and active <b>measures</b> are described.

Besides the information on physical dimensions, it also contains data on the function and the strength of the heart muscle. We must, of course, also consider possible disturbing influences such as changing cardiovascular conditions (e. g. the heart rate). So far we have found no such effects. It should be mentioned that the PCGs have always been picked up at the basal heart rate with no labour activity and not during acclerations nor decelerations. At the present time we are investigating the reliability of this method, and its applicability to routine examinations...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The paper {{assesses the}} {{flexicurity}} index for disabled people in Italy using regional data, {{over the period}} 2006 - 2011. In particular, we develop a multidimensional indicator of flexicurity based on the Mazziotta-Pareto Index. The {{results of the investigation}} show that regions in northern Italy show a higher degree of flexicurity than in southern Italy ones. The low level of flexicurity in south Italy is a consequence of the high concentration of civilian disability pensions among those in working age in this macro-area (<b>passive</b> <b>measure).</b> In addition, the strong link between the flexicurity index and matching rate of people with disabilities undoubtedly leans towards a better balance of active and passive policies, giving more prominence to active measures especially due to their ability to improve social and economic integration of people with disabilities...|$|R
50|$|Thus a {{balanced}} approach to energy efficiency in buildings {{should be more}} comprehensive than simply trying to minimize energy consumed. Issues such as quality of indoor environment and efficiency of space use should be factored in. Thus the measures used to improve energy efficiency can take many different forms. Often they include <b>passive</b> <b>measures</b> that inherently reduce the need to use energy, such as better insulation. Many serve various functions improving the indoor conditions as well as reducing energy use, such as increased use of natural light.|$|E
