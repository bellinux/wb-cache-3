Participants were taught self-management techniques to monitor academic performance, on-task behaviors, and disruptive behaviors. A multiple baseline design across students with intervention withdrawal embedded within each baseline was used to empirically assess the effectiveness of self-management. Self-management associated with increases of on-task behaviors and academic performance, and associated with a decrease of disruptive behaviors when compared to other phases.

40|$|Findings {{from animal}} {{studies suggest that}} stimuli present during the {{administration}} of <b>psycho</b> <b>stimulant</b> drugs can acquire the ability to elicit drug-like conditioned increases in locomotor activity. Human pharmacological drug-like conditioned responses are less well researched. There is evidence suggesting that stimuli paired with <b>psycho</b> <b>stimulant</b> administration can elicit drug-like physiological and subjective changes, as well as increases in drug craving. However, to date, no study has explicitly examined whether drug-induced facilitation of cognitive performance can be conditioned to drug-associated stimuli. The studies in the present thesis set out to test this and examine {{the extent to which}} the pattern of results conformed to the principles of Pavlovian classical conditioning. Caffeine was used as a model <b>psycho</b> <b>stimulant</b> drug, due to its well-reported ability to facilitate various aspects of cognitive performance. However, due to difficulties obtaining reliable effects of caffeine, the factors that may influence the effects of caffeine in a caffeine consumer sample were also investigated and reviewed. These factors included dose, expectancy, absorption interval, type of task, withdrawal and level of habitual consumption. It was concluded that caffeine can enhance cognitive performance, however these effects are inconsistent and may be influenced by individual differences. In addition, findings from a screening procedure indicated that responses to caffeine differ even within an overnight-deprived caffeine consumer population, an effect that appears to be dependent on the level of habitual caffeine intake. Due to such individual variation in the responses to caffeine, the conditioned effects were examined using a differential (i. e. within-subjects) conditioning procedure in which one set of environmental stimuli were paired with caffeine, and another set were paired with placebo. When subsequently tested free of drug, there were no differences in performance or mood responses at the conditioning test. However, there was evidence of caffeine facilitation on performance and mood during early conditioning trials that was lost on later conditioning trials due to a systematic improvement in the placebo condition. It was argued that this may be due to a conditioned response being acquired in the caffeine paired context which generalised to the placebo paired context. To test this hypothesis a second differential conditioning paradigm was conducted with fewer trials to establish whether evidence of a conditioned response could be observed in the caffeine-paired context during a placebo challenge. Evidence of a conditioned facilitation of reaction time was found, suggesting that the environment in which caffeine is ingested can acquire drug-like facilitations of cognitive performance...|$|R
40|$|The {{leaves of}} khat shrub have a {{stimulating}} effect, and the chewing {{of this material}} has been practiced for many centuries in certain areas of East Africa and Arabian Peninsula. Khat is widely consumed among the youth of Ethiopia; especially among high school, College and University {{students as well as}} drivers. The active ingredient of khat responsible for its <b>psycho</b> <b>stimulant</b> effect is an alkaloid chemical known as cathinone, which is structurally and chemically similar to d-amphetamine, and cathine, a milder form of cathinone. Cathinone is a highly potent stimulant, which produces central nervous system stimulation analogous to the effect of amphetamine. The major effects of khat chewing include those on the gastro-intestinal system and on the nervous system. The negative effects of khat also include increased blood pressure, tachycardia, insomnia, anorexia, constipation, urine retention, irritability and impaired sexual potency in men. This review highlights the chemistry of khat, the health, social and economical aspects of khat chewing particularly in Ethiopia...|$|R
40|$|Objective: We {{organized}} this prospective clinical based multidisciplinary {{study in}} order to determine clinical headache types and clinical determinants of headache disorders induced by substance abuse in relation to phases of substance abuse (abuse, abstinence and rehabilitation). Method: The study consisted of 460 consecutive patients who were diagnosed as addicts and were treated as inpatient and/or outpatients at AMATEM. Patients were assessed in three groups: Group I; <b>Psycho</b> <b>stimulant</b> users, Group II; Psycho depressant users and Group III Multiple substance abusers. They were examined during substance abuse (Phase I), withdrawal (Phase II) and rehabilitation (Phase III). Headache diagnosis has been made by a headache specialist according to ICHD-II. Results: In total, 296 subjects (64. 3 %) reported recurrent headaches in all study phases. Patients were diagnosed as tension type headache (TTH) (45. 0 %), migraine (16. 5 %) like headache disorders, and secondary headache disorders (2. 8 %), respectively. The most frequent substance abused headache was related to cannabis (9. 3 %), it's followed by heroine and multiple substances (4. 3 %). Conclusion: It was concluded that primary headache disorders are an important comorbidity of substance abusers. More information has to need about headache triggered by substance addiction...|$|R

With ADHD follows a vast variety of other conditions, which burdens the ADHD individuals even more. The major cause for the disorder is in heritage but also other possible explanations will be discussed. The main treatment for ADHD is <b>psycho</b> <b>stimulants,</b> such as methylphenidate and amphetamine. ADHD is associated with substance abuse and several articles in this essay will provide support for that. Is substance abuse in ADHD individuals a form of self-medication in order to ameliorate the symptoms or is the increased risk for substance abuse due to the stimulant medications?

40|$|Co-administration of N-methyl- D-aspartate (NMDA) {{receptor}} antagonists {{is known}} to block the development of behavioral sensitization to ethanol and other <b>psycho</b> <b>stimulants.</b> Since ethanol sensitization in mice does not occur uniformly in all treated animals, the present study examined the possibility that NMDA receptor binding would be selectively altered in mice susceptible to ethanol sensitization. Mice received 2. 4 g/kg ethanol or saline i. p. daily for 21 days and were sacrificed 24 It later. No differences in [H- 3]dizoeilpine ([H- 3](-) MK- 801) binding were found between sensitized and vehicle-treated mice {{in any of the}} brain regions analyzed. However, ethanol-treated mice that did not develop sensitization showed significantly higher binding in the nucleus accumbens core (+ 32 % and 40 % compared to controls and ethanol-sensitized mice, respectively; P< 0. 04) and the prefrontal cortex (+ 15 % and + 22 %; P< 0. 02). in a separate experiment, sensitization resistant mice challenged with 0. 25 mg/kg (+) MK 801 showed significantly less motor activation than saline-treated or ethanol-sensitized mice. These results point to a clear association between elevated NMDA receptor binding in specific brain regions and resistance to ethanol sensitization. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V.

40|$|The study {{compared}} {{treatment programs}} with EEG biofeedback or stimulants {{as their primary}} components. An EEG group (EEG) was matched with a stimulant group (MED) by age, IQ, gender and diagnosis. The Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA) was administered pre and post treatment. EEG and MED groups improved (p 0. 3) on TOVA change scores. The EEG biofeedback program is an effective alternative to stimulants and may be the treatment of choice when medication is ineffective, has side effects, or compliance is a problem. The {{purpose of the study}} was to examine the efficacy of 20 sessions of EEG biofeedback in reducing AD/HD symptoms and to compare the results with those obtained with <b>psycho</b> <b>stimulant</b> medication. Psychostimulants are the most widely used treatment for AD/HD (Barkley, 1990). In order to be a widely accepted alternative to medication, EEG biofeedback must be able to produce equivalent symptom reduction. Reports documenting the use of EEG biofeedback in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (AD/HD) began to appear in the literature in the mid 1970 's (Lubar & Shouse, 1976). In recent years the use of this treatment has become more widesprea...|$|R

The above two groups were subdivided into two subgroups (n = 20) in accordance on whether they were regular and chronic khat chewers or none into NNK; healthy non-khat chewers, NK; healthy khat chewers, DNK; type 2 diabetic non-khat chewers and DK; type 2 diabetic khat chewers. Khat chewing resulted in elevated resistin, cortisol, FBG, PBG levels and HOMA-IR in either diabetics or healthy khat chewers than those of non-khat chewers and generally in diabetics than healthy. In addition, khat chewing resulted in {{a significant increase in}} calcium and copper serum levels. In contrast, serum zinc and insulin levels in diabetic chewers were significantly lower than those of diabetic’s non-chewers.

40|$|Objective: Food intake {{is highly}} {{regulated}} by central homeostatic and hedonic mechanisms {{in response to}} peripheral and environmental cues. Neutral energy balance stems from proper integration of homeostatic signals with those “sensing” the rewarding properties of food. Impairments in brain insulin signaling causes dysregulation of feeding behaviors and, as a consequence, hyperphagia. Here, we sought {{to determine how the}} mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC 2), a complex involved in insulin signaling, influences high fat feeding. Methods: Rictor is a subunit of mTORC 2, and its genetic deletion impairs mTORC 2 activity. We used Cre-LoxP technology to delete Rictorin tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expressing neurons (TH Rictor KO). We assessed food intake, body weight, body composition and DA dependent behaviors. Results: TH Rictor KO mice display a high-fat diet specific hyperphagia, yet, when on low-fat diet, their food intake is indistinguishable from controls. Consistently, TH Rictor KO become obese only while consuming high-fat diet. This is paralleled by reduced brain DA content, and disruption of DA dependent behaviors including increased novelty-induced hyperactivity and exaggerated response to the <b>psycho</b> <b>stimulant</b> amphetamine (AMPH). Conclusions: Our data support a model in which mTORC 2 signaling within catecholaminergic neurons constrains consumption of a high-fat diet, while disruption causes high-fat diet-specific exaggerated hyperphagia. In parallel, impaired mTORC 2 signaling leads to aberrant striatal DA neurotransmission, which has been associated with obesity in human and animal models, as well as with escalating substance abuse. These data suggest that defects localized to the catecholaminergic pathways are capable of overriding homeostatic circuits, leading to obesity, metabolic impairment, and aberrant DA-dependent behaviors...|$|R
40|$|ADHD is {{a common}} neuropsychiatric {{disorder}} with a strong persistence over time. Medication is frequently used in the clinical management of ADHD. After response, medication is typically prescribed for months to years. It is unclear whether extended medication treatment provides long-term benefits {{and how long it}} should be continued. Furthermore, there is concern about the long-term safety of ADHD medication. The aim of this systematic review is to address these issues and provide recommendations about the decision to stop or not to stop ADHD medication. We performed a search in PubMed and focused on medication studies with a treatment longer than 12 weeks in subjects 6 - 18 years old. Extended placebo-controlled double-blind parallel studies are not available. Placebo-controlled discontinuation studies and prospective long-term observational treatment studies provide evidence that medication management leads to a substantial reduction of ADHD symptoms and less impairment of functioning for a period of about 2 years. There is limited and inconsistent evidence for long-term advantage of medication treatment beyond symptom control, such as improved social functioning, academic achievement, employment status and less adverse psychiatric outcome. In terms of safety, long-term effects of medication on growth, blood pressure and heart rate are limited and the occurrence of suicidal, psychotic and manic symptoms is rare. Animal data about neurotoxic effects of <b>psycho</b> <b>stimulants</b> cannot be directly extrapolated to humans. Therefore, clinical decisions about starting, continuing, and stopping of ADHD medication should be made on an individual basis. Medication free periods should be implemented at regular times to investigate the need for an ongoing benefit of medication. Unfounded assumptions about continuing benefit of medication use should be abandoned. Careful monitoring of side effects is necessary and must be able to detect early alarming signals...|$|E
40|$|Sleep {{disturbance}} is {{the strongest}} predictor of manic relapse and {{is considered one of}} the most important objective measures of treatment response in bipolar disorder (BD). However, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying sleep disturbance in BD are poorly understood. the administration of <b>psycho</b> <b>stimulants</b> to rodents can trigger a number of manic-like behaviors. Therefore, the present study aims to investigate the effects of single and repeated D-amphetamine (AMPH) administration on sleep patterns in rats. Sleep was continuously monitored during light periods after single and repeated (7 days) injections of AMPH (2 mg/kg, i. p.) or saline in adult Wistar rats using electrocorticogram and electromyographic recordings. Acute injections of AMPH suppressed sleep for the first 2 h, and were followed by a gradual increase in the amount of sleep. Both slow wave sleep (SWS) and paradoxical sleep (PS) were compromised. Repeated exposure to AMPH led to a drastic disruption of the sleep-wake cycle that was mainly characterized by a decrease of PS during all time-points recorded in comparison to the saline group. Furthermore, both acute and chronic AMPH administration induced longer latencies to both SWS and PS. These findings suggest that AMPH produces profound sleep disturbances and decreases PS sleep. Given that some of these abnormalities are observed in individuals with BD, this animal model can provide a means to investigate neurobiological aspects of sleep disturbance in BD, as well as their response to mood stabilizers.

40|$|Purpose – Mephedrone is a {{synthetic}} stimulant drug causing entactogenic and hallucinogenic effects. A systematic review of all existing empirical research and literature from 2009 - 2012 {{on this new}} psychoactive drug was conducted. This paper aims to report on that review. Design/methodology/approach – The review was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines. Electronic databases were utilised using the search terms “mephedrone” and product nomenclature; “Plant Food”, “Feeder”, “Meow Meow”, “Miaow”, “Drone”, “Meph” “Bubbles”, “Charge”, and “MCat”. The search was restricted to publications from 2009 - 2012, and produced 702 results. Data were collected by {{one member of the}} research team and cross checked by another. A primary screening was carried out to exclude inaccurate search results and drugs other than mephedrone. The results were studied and duplicates removed; 598 results were discarded, with 104 deemed suitable for inclusion. Findings – The review underscores mephedrone's popularity despite legislative controls. Drug displacement patterns from illicit to licit were observed prior to controls, with blending of mephedrone and other substitute cathinones with street drugs thereafter. User consumptive choices are grounded in availability, perceptions of legality and safety, curiosity and perceived quality of drug outcomes within poly drug taking repertoires. Clinical reports indicate that mephedrone has high abuse potential and toxicity, with several dependence symptoms. Risk assessment, detection, diagnosis and treatment of mephedrone use are difficult due to polydrug use and associated mental health disorders. Research limitations/implications – The review points to the need for further research into the pharmacology and toxicity of mephedrone in order to better equip clinicians with assessment, diagnosis and treatment strategies to reduce morbidity. Practical implications – The increasingly diversified new <b>psycho</b> <b>stimulant</b> market where mephedrone is a major player poses unprecedented challenges for drug surveillance, policy, community and clinical practice. Social implications – Stricter legislative controls including internet vendor responsibility for supply of mephedrone have been suggested, along with raising public awareness on an international level through coordinated efforts. Originality/value – The last review was published in 2009 by the Psychonaut Webmapping Group. This review brings together a comprehensive new set of data sources as they relate to this drug...|$|R
40|$|There {{is a need}} to {{classify}} patients at genetic risk for drug seeking behavior prior to or upon entry to residential and or non-residential chemical dependency programs. We have determined based on a literature review, that there are seven risk alleles associated with six candidate genes that were studied in this patient population of recovering poly-drug abusers. To determine risk severity of these 26 patients we calculated the percentage of prevalence of the risk alleles and provided a severity score based on percentage of these alleles. Subjects carry the following risk alleles: DRD 2 =A 1; SLC 6 A 3 (DAT) = 10 R; DRD 4 = 3 R or 7 R; 5 HTTlRP = L or LA; MAO= 3 R; and COMT=G. As depicted in table 2 low severity (LS) = 1 - 36 %; Moderate Severity = 37 - 50 %, and High severity = 51 - 100 %. We studied two distinct ethnic populations group 1 consisted of 16 male Caucasian <b>psycho</b> <b>stimulant</b> addicts and group 2 consisted of 10 Chinese heroin addicted males. Based on this model the 16 subjects tested have at least one risk allele or 100 %. Out of the 16 subjects we found 50 % (8) HS; 31 % (5) MS; and 19 % LS (3 subjects). These scores are then converted to a fraction and then represented as a Genetic Addiction Risk Score (GARS) whereby we found the average GARS to be: 0. 28 low severity, 0. 44 moderate severity and 0. 58 high severity respectively. Therefore, using this GARS we found that 81 % of the patients were at moderate to high risk for addictive behavior. Of particular interest we found that 56 % of the subjects carried the DRD 2 A 1 allele (9 / 16). Out of the 9 Chinese heroin addicts [one patient not genotyped] (group 2) we found 11 % (1) HS; 56 % (5) MS; and 33 % LS (3 subjects). These scores are then converted to a fraction and then represented as GARS whereby we found the average GARS to be: 0. 28 Low Severity; 0. 43 moderate severity and 0. 54 high severity respectively. Therefore, using GARS we found that 67 % of the patients were at moderate to high risk for addictive behavior. Of particular interest we found that 56 % of the subjects carried the DRD 2 A 1 allele (5 / 9) similar to group 1. Statistical analysis revealed that the groups did not differ in terms of overall severity (67 vs. 81 %) in these two distinct populations. Combining these two independent study populations reveal that subjects entering a residential treatment facility for poly-drug abuse carry at least one risk allele (100 %). We found 74 % of the combined 25 subjects (Caucasian and Chinese) had a moderate to high GARS. Confirmation of these exploratory results and development of mathematical predictive values of these risk alleles are necessary before any meaningful interpretation of these results are to be considered...|$|R
40|$|Rationale: In Pavlovian {{conditioning}} research, nicotine {{is typically}} conceptualized as the unconditioned stimulus (US) that becomes {{associated with an}} exteroceptive conditioned stimulus (CS). This research has not explored the possibility that nicotine can also function as a CS. Objectives: The present research examined whether nicotine served as a CS for the presence (CS+) or absence (CS–) of sucrose and started defining its specificity. Methods and results: Rats trained in the CS+ condition had nicotine (0. 4 mg/kg, base) paired intermittently with brief access to sucrose. Intermixed were saline sessions without sucrose. Nicotine acquired the ability to evoke goal tracking. This conditioned response (CR) decreased across extinction sessions. The CR was sensitive to nicotine dose (ED 50 = 0. 113 mg/kg) and administration to testing interval; 0 -min and 100 -min delays produced no CR. The CS properties were specific to nicotine in that amphetamine and bupropion substitution was incomplete. Rats in the CS– condition received similar discrimination training except that sucrose was paired with saline. Nicotine {{also served as a}} CS–; the saline state CS+ acquired control of goal tracking. Mecamylamine, but not hexamethonium, blocked nicotine’s ability to serve as a CS+ and CS–, indicating a role for central nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Conclusions: Nicotine served as a signal for {{the presence or absence of}} sucrose. The extinction, CS–, and substitution results eliminated a <b>psycho</b> motor <b>stimulant</b> account. The conceptualization of nicotine as a CS suggests novel empirical research in which a drug acquires additional inhibitory and/or excitatory value based on other outcomes present during its effects...|$|R
40|$|The {{developmental}} remodelling of motivational {{systems that}} underlie drug dependence and addiction {{may account for}} the greater frequency and severity of drug abuse in adolescence compared to adulthood. Recent advances in animal models have begun to identify the morphological and the molecular factors that are being remodelled, but {{little is known about the}} culmination of these factors in altered sensitivity to <b>psycho</b> <b>stimulant</b> drugs, like amphetamine, in adolescence. Amphetamine induces potent locomotor activating effects in rodents through increased dopamine release in the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system, which makes locomotor activity a useful behavioural marker of age differences in amphetamine sensitivity. The aim of the thesis was to investigate the neural basis for age differences in amphetamine sensitivity with a focus on the nucleus accumbens and the medial prefrontal cortex, which initiate and regulate amphetamine-induced locomotor activity, respectively. In study 1, I found pre- and post- pubertal adolescent rats to be less active (i. e., hypoactive) than adults to a first injection of 0. 5, but not of 1. 5, mg/kg of intraperitonealy (i. p.) administered amphetamine. Although initially hypoactive, only adolescent rats exhibited an increase in activity to a second injection of amphetamine given 24 h later, indicating that adolescents may be more sensitive to the rapid changes in amphetamineinduced plasticity than adults. Given that the locomotor activating effects of amphetamine are initiated in the nucleus accumbens, age differences in response to direct injections of amphetamine into this brain region were investigated in study 2. In contrast to i. p. injections, adolescents were more active than adults when amphetamine was given directly into the nucleus accumbens, indicating that hypo activity may be attributed to the development of regulatory regions outside of the accumbens. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is a key regulator of the locomotor activating effects of amphetamine that undergoes extensive remodelling in adolescence. In study 3, I found that an i. p. injection of 1. 5, and not of 0. 5, mg/kg of amphetamine resulted in a high expression of c-fos, a marker of neural activation, in the pre limbic mPFC only in pre-pubertal adolescent rats. This finding suggests that the ability of adolescent rats to overcome hypo activity at the 1. 5 mg/kg dose may involve greater activation of the prelimbic mPFC compared to adulthood. In support of this hypothesis, I found that pharmacological inhibition of prelimbic D 1 dopamine receptors disrupted the locomotor activating effects of the 1. 5 mg/kg dose of amphetamine to a greater extent in adolescent than in adult rats. In addition, the stimulation of prelimbic D 1 dopamine receptors potentiated locomotor activity at the 0. 5 mg/kg dose of amphetamine only in adolescent rats, indicating that the prelimbic D 1 dopamine receptors are involved in overcoming locomotor hypoactivity during adolescence. Given my finding that the locomotor activating effects of amphetamine rely on slightly different mechanisms in adolescence than in adulthood, study 4 was designed to determine whether the lasting consequences of drug use would also differ with age. A short period of pre-treatment with 0. 5 mg/kg of amphetamine in adolescence, but not in adulthood, resulted in heightened sensitivity to an injection of amphetamine given 30 days after the start of the procedure, when adolescent rats had reached adulthood. The finding of an age-specific increase in amphetamine sensitivity is consistent with evidence for increased risk for addiction when drug use is initiated in adolescence compared to adulthood in people (Merline et aI., 2002), and with the hypothesis that adolescence is a sensitive period of development...|$|R
