40|$|Manual {{inflation}} of {{the lungs}} by the 'bag squeezing method' (bagging) is commonly used by physiotherapists {{in the management of}} intubated patients. A wide variety of 'bagging' circuits are available and the peak expiratory flow rate that can be achieved is influenced by the circuit components. A high expiratory flow rate is desirable as it is believed {{to be one of the}} factors that determines the effectiveness of secretion mobilisation during a simulated cough in intubated patients. This study was designed to compare the expiratory flow rates resulting from the elastic recoil of a test-lung using the Mapleson-C breathing system and the Laerdal self-inflating resuscitator. Our data demonstrated that for any given pressure gradient the measured peak expiratory flow was higher with the Laerdal self-inflating resuscitator (p < 0. 001).

Part of {{the care of a}} mechanically ventilated patient is frequent suctioning of the trachea to remove secretions. Currently, there is no criterion for documenting the quantity of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>secretions</b> recovered from suctioning a mechanically ventilated patient. The purpose of this research survey is to determine criteria for documenting the quantity of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>secretions</b> retrieved. Methods: A survey has been sent via e-mail to thirteen respiratory therapy managers, with a request to disperse the survey to their employees- 576 employees. Hard copies of the survey were available upon request. The survey asks the participants to state criteria used to define commonly used terms: scant, small, moderate, large and copious when documenting the amount of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>secretions</b> collected after suctioning a trached or intubated patient for one setting. The data will be gathered and compiled into a spread sheet to determine criteria to standardize documentation of the quantity of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>secretions.</b> Data were analyzed to determine the consistency with a set of definitions devised by University based respiratory therapists. By the nature of the questionnaire there were “free text” responses. Each response was compared with the “definition”.

40|$|A high-molecular-weight {{glycoprotein}} was isolated, purified {{and partially}} characterized from the insoluble <b>pulmonary</b> <b>secretions</b> accumulating in lungs of patients suffering from pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. On electrophoresis in 5 % polyacrylamide gel {{in the presence}} of sodium dodecyl sulphate and 2 -mercaptoethanol, the purified protein gave one major band as detected by Coomassie Blue as well as with periodic acid/Schiff staining. An apparent mol. wt. of 250000 was estimated for this glycoprotein. Amino acid analysis showed that it contains hydroxyproline, and relatively high amounts of glycine, glutamic acid, aspartic acid and leucine. It contains approx. 6 % hexose, 3 % sialic acid and 2 % glucosamine. The neutral sugars are galactose, mannose and fucose. An antiserum prepared in rabbits against this high-molecular-weight glycoprotein cross-reacted with two smaller glycoproteins (mol. wts. 62000 and 36000) isolated from the same <b>pulmonary</b> <b>secretions</b> of these patients.

We aim to discover the characteristics of patients with MDR-AB recurrence in the respiratory tract. Methods: We retrospectively collected 106 chronic respiratory failure patients with MDR-AB harvest in <b>pulmonary</b> <b>secretion</b> culture. Results: MDR-AB was successfully eradicated in 69 patients. Diabetes mellitus (p =  0. 030, odds ratio [OR]: 2. 7, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1. 1 – 6. 4) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (p =  0. 001, OR =  4. 8, 95 % CI: 1. 8 – 12. 7) reduce the MDR-AB eradication rate. Besides, a classification of colonization or infection was made beyond the 69 MDR-AB eradicated patients. In the colonization group, diabetes mellitus (p =  0. 009; OR =  5. 1, 95 % CI: 1. 5 – 17. 6) is the only independent factor to increase the recurrence rate. Glycated hemoglobin level is also analyzed for each group to investigate diabetes control effect, but no significant difference found.

40|$|In modern {{emergency}} and critical care, physicians tend {{to choose the}} mode of mechanical ventilation based on spontaneous breathing {{for the purpose of}} promoting discharge of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>secretion</b> and preventing atelectasis in patients with acute respiratory insufficiency. However, we often observe &# 34;differences in recovery&# 34; among patients treated using the same PSV settings beyond &# 34;differences in individual characteristics. &# 34; We evaluated the Pressure Support Ventilation (PSV) mode aiming to certify the difference among 7 representative mechanical ventilators using the Active Servo Lung 5000 (ASL 5000) respiratory simulation system. The following parameters were measured: The time delay that resulted in the lowest inspiratory pressure from {{the point at which the}} ventilator recognized spontaneous breathing (TD), the lowest inspiratory airway pressure (cmH 2 O) generated prior to the initiation of PSV (DeltaPaw), the work of breathing while triggering required to achieve the lowest inspiratory negative pressure from the beginning of inspiratory support (WOBtrig), and the inspiratory work of breathing (WOBi). The mean TD of the Puritan-Bennett type 840 (PB 840) was signifi cantly shorter than those of other ventilators (p 0. 01). The WOBtrig of the PB 840 was significantly lower than those of others (p 0. 01). However, the WOBi values of the Servo-I and T-Bird were greater than the others, with the Evita series showing the smallest WOBi of the 7 ventilators tested. According to this simulation study using ASL 5000, we concluded that PB 840 was the most rapid response ventilator, but the Evita series was the gentlest mechanical ventilator among 7 ventilators from the standpoint of the total work of breathing during the inspiration phase in the setting of PSV. </p...|$|E
40|$|Intravascular {{clotting}} and fibrinolysis (C and F) are {{events which}} often accompany major surgical trauma. Their role in inducing cardiopulmonary failure is debated and prompted {{this study of}} 13 patients undergoing elective AAA. Following intubation, anesthesia and pressure breathing fibrinolytic activity (FA) in arterial blood exceeded that in mixed venous blood (p < 0. 001) indicating <b>pulmonary</b> <b>secretion</b> of proteolytic activity. Fibrinogen, plasminogen and fibrin degradation products (FDPs) were normal. During surgery, fibrinogen and plasminogen fell (p < 0. 001) while nonplasmin mediated FA and FDPs rose (p <. 001). Despite heparinization (5000 U IV) aortic clamping (avg 56 min) led to evidence of C and F within the lungs. Arterial fibrinogen was 33. 2 mg/ml lower than mixed venous blood (p < 0. 01) and plasminogen was 0. 47 Sherry units lower (p < 0. 001). Soluble fibrin monomer appeared in arterial blood (p < 0. 01). At the same time nonplasmin mediated FA was consumed within the lungs (p < 0. 01) and FDPs were produced (44. 6 µg/ml higher in arterial blood, p < 0. 001). Similar changes were noted after aortic declamping. The transient 5. 3 ml/cm H 20 fall in dynamic compliance was unrelated to C and F. Pulmonary vascular resistance and arterial pressure were unchanged. During wound closure intrapulmonary C and F ceased. Postoperatively (6 h), the physiologic shunt of 15. 1 % was similar to tbe preoperative value of 13. 3 %. All C and F factors returned to normal except FDPs which remained elevated. An average of 0. 2 U blood was given prior to aortic clamping and 3. 1 U during clamping. Neither the volume nor the type of blood (7 patients received washed RBCs) influenced pulmonary C and F. The results show that pressure breathing will alter pulmonary metabolism from clearance to secretion of fibrinolytic activity. Surgery leads to systemic C and F while intrapulmonary C and F is triggered by aortic clamping despite IV heparin. Delayed functional consequences of C and F are possible.

40|$|Pulmonary {{exposure}} to multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) {{has been linked}} to an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease in addition to the well-documented physicochemical-dependent adverse lung effects. A proposed mechanism is through a strong and sustained <b>pulmonary</b> <b>secretion</b> of acute phase proteins to the blood. We identified physicochemical determinants of MWCNT-induced systemic acute phase response by analyzing effects of pulmonary {{exposure to}} 14 commercial, well-characterized MWCNTs in female C 57 BL/ 6 J mice pulmonary exposed to 0, 6, 18 or 54 μg MWCNT/mouse. Plasma levels of acute phase response proteins serum amyloid A 1 / 2 (SAA 1 / 2) and SAA 3 were determined on day 1, 28 or 92. Expression levels of hepatic Saa 1 and pulmonary Saa 3 mRNA levels were assessed to determine the origin of the acute phase response proteins. Pulmonary Saa 3 mRNA expression levels were greater and lasted longer than hepatic Saa 1 mRNA expression. Plasma SAA 1 / 2 and SAA 3 protein levels were related to time and physicochemical properties using adjusted, multiple regression analyses. SAA 3 and SAA 1 / 2 plasma protein levels were increased after exposure to almost all of the MWCNTs on day 1, whereas limited changes were observed on day 28 and 92. SAA 1 / 2 and SAA 3 protein levels did not correlate and only SAA 3 protein levels correlated with neutrophil influx. The multiple regression analyses revealed a protective effect of MWCNT length on SAA 1 / 2 protein level on day 1, such that a longer length resulted in lowered SAA 1 / 2 plasma levels. Increased SAA 3 protein levels were positively related to dose and content of Mn, Mg and Co on day 1, whereas oxidation and diameter of the MWCNTs were protective on day 28 and 92, respectively. The results of this study reveal very differently controlled pulmonary and hepatic acute phase responses after MWCNT exposure. As the responses were influenced by the physicochemical properties of the MWCNTs, this study provides the first step towards designing MWCNT that induce less SAA...|$|E

Small hospital outbreaks are frequent and are usually due to a single contaminated environmental source. The pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) is widely used to identify the strain emission sources in cystic fibrosis patients. The aim of this research was to study genotyping of Burkholderia cepacia using PFGE method, and to evaluate diversity complex of clinical strains isolated from cystic fibrosis patients. Methods: This is a descriptive study, in which 100 <b>pulmonary</b> <b>secretion</b> specimens of cystic fibrosis patients admitted in Masih Daneshvari Hospital, Tehran Iran in period of 12 months 2012 to 2013 were collected. The specimens were cultured on BCSA plate’s. After incubation suspected colonies were isolated and identified by biochemical and phenotypic method. All samples were checked by API system (API 20 NE) and by specific PCR method for genus Bulkhorderia and Bcc as well. DNA was extracted by alkaline lysis method and confirmed by PCR analysis of recA genes. Genetic diversity of isolate was performed by PFGE analysis according to Pulsenet guideline by using XbaI, SpeI as restriction enzyme which digests infrequently among the Burkholderia cepacia genome. Results: Out of 100 samples five were identified as Burkholderia cepacia. It is obviously different at variously reports. The electrophoresis data of PCR products and comparison of band in samples from patients with standard strain ATCC 25416 Burkholderia cepacia and compare and analyse the PFGE size marker bands of Salmonella choleransuis serotype Braenderup H 9812 strain, were the same. Conclusion: Application of PFGE and identification of pulse-type is a potential tool to enhance the investigation of apparent nosocomial outbreaks of B. cepacia. Similar type of pulse patterns was observed in this study means that all of infection has been from one source; therefore the hypothesis of transferring person to person will be rejected.

40|$|Introduction & Objective: Nosocomial {{pneumonia}} is pneumonia {{that occurs}} at least 48 hours after hospitalization. In total, this infection {{is the second}} most common cause of hospital-acquired infection in intensive care units. The purpose of conducting this research was the detection of etiology of nosocomial pneumonia in the ICUs of teaching hospitals of Hamadan University of medical sciences. Materials & Methods: In this cross -sectional study, 353 patients hospitalized in the ICUs of Hamadan hospitals (Besat and Ekbatan) were analyzed. Different variables including age, gender, cause of hospitalization and underlying diseases were recorded in a number of questionnaires. On repeated visits to the ICUs, these questionnaires were completed for different patients and in the next weekly visits the patients’ conditions and paraclinical aspects were recorded in the files. The criteria for onset of nosocomial pneumonia was the appearance of fever after 48 hours and leukocytosis, the increasing <b>pulmonary</b> <b>secretion</b> and the alteration of chest x-ray together with the culture results of secretions obtained by suction of tracheal tube. In the case of infecting with nosocomial pneumonia some more variables including connecting a ventilator, the period of connecting the ventilator until infection, the type of consumed antibiotic before the onset of nosocomial pneumonia, the obtained organisms, and the period of hospitalization in the ICU until infection were also recorded for these patients. The chi-square test and Fisher’s exact test were used for data analysis and the meaningful levels for the tests were less than 0. 05. Results: The average age of study population was 51. 2 years with the standard deviation of 21. 9 years. 36 people (10. 2 %) of the hospitalized patients in the ICUs were infected with nosocomial pneumonia. Trauma with a rate of 47. 5 % (168 people) was {{the most common cause of}} patient hospitalization in the ICUs. 66. 5 % of these patients (24 patients) were affected by nosocomial pneumonia (VAP) after connecting to ventilation device. In 91. 7 % of the cases, the hospitalized patients in the ICUs consumed antibiotics, out of which 50 % were treated with cephalosporins. It is also necessary to note that 42. 5 % of patients took more than one type of antibiotics. Conclusion: The findings of this study indicates the high consumption of cephalosporins, a predisposing factor to nosocomial infections, in the ICUs of teaching hospitals of medical university of Hamadan.

O objetivo do estudo foi avaliar o efeito da HM combinada com compressão torácica expiratória (CTE) na duração de internação em UTI e no tempo de ventilação mecânica (VM) em pacientes sob VM. MÉTODOS: Ensaio clínico prospectivo, randomizado e controlado com pacientes de UTI sob VM em um {{hospital}} acadêmico terciário entre janeiro de 2004 e janeiro de 2005. Dentre os 49 pacientes que preencheram os critérios do estudo, 24 e 25 foram randomicamente alocados nos grupos fisioterapia respiratória (FR) e controle, respectivamente, sendo que 6 e 8 foram retirados do estudo. Durante o período de observação de 5 dias, os pacientes do grupo FR receberam HM combinada com CTE, enquanto os controles receberam o tratamento padrão de enfermagem. RESULTADOS: Os dois grupos apresentaram características basais semelhantes. A intervenção teve efeito positivo na duração de VM, alta da UTI e escore de Murray. Houve diferenças significativas entre os grupos controle e FR em relação à taxa de sucesso no desmame nos dias 2 (0, 0 % vs. 37, 5 %), 3 (0, 0 % vs. 37, 5 %), 4 (5, 3 vs. 37, 5 %) e 5 (15, 9 % vs. 37, 5 %), assim como à taxa de alta da UTI nos dias 3 (0 % vs. 25 %), 4 (0 % vs. 31 %) e 5 (0 % vs. 31 %).

Based on these observations, we hypothesized that BCAA would be found at limiting concentrations in <b>pulmonary</b> <b>secretions</b> and that A. pleuropneumoniae mutants unable to synthesize BCAA would be attenuated in a porcine infection model. Quantitation of free amino acids in porcine pulmonary epithelial lining fluid showed concentrations of BCAA ranging from 8 to 30 μmol/liter, which is 10 to 17 % of the concentration in plasma. The expression of both ilvI and lrp, a global regulator that is required for ilvI expression, was strongly upregulated in CDM containing concentrations of BCAA {{similar to those found}} in <b>pulmonary</b> <b>secretions.</b> Deletion-disruption mutants of ilvI and lrp were both auxotrophic for BCAA in CDM and attenuated compared to wild-type A. pleuropneumoniae in competitive index experiments in a pig infection model.

These results clearly demonstrate that BCAA availability is limited in the lungs and support the hypothesis that A. pleuropneumoniae, and potentially other pulmonary pathogens, uses limitation of BCAA as a cue to regulate the expression of genes required for survival and virulence.

An L-S ratio of 2.4 or more indicates fetal lung maturity and a relatively low risk of infant respiratory distress syndrome, and an L/S ratio of less than 1.5 is associated with a high risk of infant respiratory distress syndrome.|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, {{molecular}} biology techniques for identifying mycobacteria in <b>pulmonary</b> <b>secretions</b> {{have become more}} and more sensitive and rapid, even in smear negative samples. Nuclear amplification techniques also allow the rapid detection of resistance to first or second line anti-tuberculous drugs. The sensitivity of these techniques for non respiratory samples is yet to be determined. The diagnosis of latent tuberculous infection (LTBI) has also increased in sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value through the use of interferon-γ release assays (IGRAs), which are tending to replace the tuberculin skin test, except for children aged under five. These tests, however, do have limitations which are important for the clinician; especially their inability to distinguish active from latent tuberculosis and their inability, in most circumstances, to exclude a diagnosis of active TB...|$|R
40|$|Legionella micdadei (Pittsburgh {{pneumonia}} agent) {{was identified}} by direct fluorescent-antibody (DFA) examination of lung tissue {{in six of}} seven persons diagnosed previously as having L. micdadei pneumonia only by histopathology and in four persons who also had positive cultures of the organism. No cross-reactions occurred with monospecific DFA conjugates prepared against Legionella pneumophila serogroups 1 to 6, Legionella bozemanii, Legionella dumoffii, and Legionella gormanii. One person had L. pneumophila serogroup 6 identified by DFA examination of lung tissue and subsequent culture of stored <b>pulmonary</b> <b>secretions.</b> Characterization of the four strains of L. micdadei revealed specific DFA reactions, bacteriological behavior, and cellular fatty acid composition that allow identification of the organism.

40|$|To instill or not {{to instill}} – is it still a question? All intubated adults and {{children}} managed in an intensive care unit (ICU) require endotracheal suctioning {{in order to maintain}} a patent airway. Patients cannot eliminate secretions themselves, partly because the presence of the endotracheal tube (ETT) compromises glottic closure, thereby limiting the pressures and velocity of airflow that can be generated for an effective cough. In addition, normal mucociliary function may be impaired by inadequately humidified inspired gas. The ETT itself may cause irritation of the airways and increased secretion production, and in the presence of respiratory infection the increased amount and viscosity of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>secretions</b> further impede clearance. [1, 2] Instillation of isotonic saline (0. 9 % sodium chloride) remains common practice in many adult and paediatric ICUs under the impression that the fluid could facilitate the removal of pulmonar...|$|R
40|$|Organophosphate (OP) {{poisoning}} is {{a health}} issue worldwide with over 200, 000 deaths per year. Although {{not a problem}} in most developed countries, in some third world countries, one third of a hospital’s population could be patients with OP exposure. Even with the most aggressive therapy, 10 - 40 % of patients admitted to an intensive care unit will die. Research into the best practice for treating OP poisoning is lacking, due somewhat {{to a lack of}} detailed understanding of the physiology of OP poisoning. Our research uses animal models of acute OP poisoning to explore the mechanism of OP-induced respiratory failure. Our research shows that animals poisoned with dichlorvos demonstrated a uniformly fatal central apnea that, if prevented, was followed immediately by a variable pulmonary dysfunction. Potential mechanisms for dichlorvos-induced central apnea can be divided into direct effects on the central respiratory oscillator (CRO) and feedback inhibition of the CRO. Two afferent pathways that can induce apnea include vagal feedback pathways and feed-forward pathways from the cerebral hemispheres. In our studies we found that vagal feedback and feed forward inhibition from the cerebral hemispheres were not required for OP-induced central apnea. The pre-Botzinger complex in the brainstem is thought to be the kernel of the CRO, but exposure of the pre-Botzinger complex to dichlorvos was not sufficient for apnea. Although OP induced central apnea was uniformly fatal, partial recovery of the CRO occurred post apnea with mechanical ventilation. Central apnea was ubiquitous in our rat poisoning model, but pulmonary dysfunction was extremely variable, with a range of pulmonary effects from fulminate pulmonary failure with prominent <b>pulmonary</b> <b>secretions</b> to no <b>pulmonary</b> dysfunction at all. Vagal efferent activity is involved in neural control of pulmonary tissue but the vagus was not involved in OP-induced pulmonary dysfunction. Anti-muscarinic medications are the mainstay of clinical therapy and are commonly dosed by their effects on <b>pulmonary</b> <b>secretions.</b> Our studies found that atropine (the most common therapeutic agent for OP poisoning) resulted in a ventilation-perfusion mismatch secondary to effects on the pulmonary vasculature...|$|R
40|$|Background: High {{frequency}} oscillation vests are {{an important}} therapy in numerous disease states. The therapy vests physically compress and shake the chest serving to loosen and mobilize <b>pulmonary</b> <b>secretions.</b> Aerosolized medications are frequently delivered concurrently with vest therapy. Patients receiving aerosolized medications are instructed to breathe deeply. However, the design and operation of the vest may affect a patient 2 ̆ 7 s ability to do so. It is our hypothesis that a healthy person’s vital capacity (VC) will decrease {{with the use of}} these vests at medium and high pressure and frequency settings. Method: Our study used four subjects with healthy lungs. We obtained a baseline slow VC using a Medical Graphics Corporation 1085 /D Spirometer calibrated following American Thoracic Society guidelines and using BreezeSuite 6. 2 software, these measurements served as our control. Participants were then fitted with the Vest ®Airway Clearance System: Model number 104 and slow VC measurements were repeated. We performed measurements at medium settings of 15 Hz, 6 or 60...|$|R
40|$|Aquaporin {{membrane}} protein channels mediate cellular water flow. Human aquaporin 5 (AQP 5) is highly {{expressed in the}} respiratory system and secretory glands where it facilitates the osmotically-driven generation of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>secretions,</b> saliva, sweat and tears. Dysfunctional trafficking of AQP 5 has been implicated in several human disease states, including Sjögren’s syndrome, bronchitis and cystic fibrosis. In order to investigate how the plasma membrane expression levels of AQP 5 are regulated, we studied real-time translocation of GFP-tagged AQP 5 in HEK 293 cells. We show that AQP 5 plasma membrane abundance in transfected HEK 293 cells is rapidly and reversibly regulated by at least three independent mechanisms involving phosphorylation at Ser 156, protein kinase A activity and extracellular tonicity. The crystal structure of a Ser 156 phosphomimetic mutant indicates that its involvement in regulating AQP 5 membrane abundance is not mediated by a conformational change of the carboxy-terminus. We suggest that together these pathways regulate cellular water flow...|$|R
50|$|Symptoms {{are caused}} by {{vascular}} compression of the airway, esophagus or both. Presentation is often within the first month (neonatal period) and usually within the first 6 months of life. Starting at birth an inspiratory and expiratory stridor (high pitch noise from turbulent airflow in trachea) may be present often in combination with an expiratory wheeze. The severity of the stridor may depend on the patient’s body position. It can be worse when the baby is {{lying on his back}} rather than its side. Sometimes the stridor can be relieved by extending the neck (lifting the chin up). Parents may notice that the baby’s cry is hoarse and the breathing noisy. Frequently a persistent cough is present. When the airway obstruction is significant there may be episodes of severe cyanosis (“blue baby”) that can lead to unconsciousness. Recurrent respiratory infections are common and secondary <b>pulmonary</b> <b>secretions</b> can further increase the airway obstruction.|$|R
40|$|Background and {{objective}} Postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs), especially postoperative pneumonia (POP), directly affect the rapid recovery {{of lung cancer}} patients after surgery. Peak expiratory flow (PEF) can reflect airway patency and cough efficiency. Moreover, cough impairment may lead to accumulation of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>secretions</b> which can {{increase the risk of}} PPCs. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the effect of preoperative PEF on PPCs in patients with lung cancer. Methods Retrospective research was conducted on 433 lung cancer patients who underwent lobectomy at the West China Hospital of Sichuan University from January 2014 to December 2015. The associations between preoperative PEF and PPCs were analyzed based on patients’ basic characteristics and clinical data in hospital. Results Preoperative PEF value in PPCs group (280. 93 ± 88. 99) L/min was significantly lower than that in non-PPCs group (358. 38 ± 93. 69) L/min (P 320 L/min group (9. 4 %) (P< 0. 001). Conclusion Preoperative PEF and PPCs are correlated, and PEF may be used as a predictor of PPCs...|$|R
40|$|Two split {{influenza}} virus vaccines administered intragastrically induced lower titres of haemagglutinin (HA) -specific antibodies in <b>pulmonary</b> <b>secretions</b> than whole virus vaccine or a third split virus vaccine. IgA antibody was the predominant HA-specific Ig class. HA-specific IgA titres decayed substantially within 2 weeks following booster immunization, but persisted {{for at least}} another 3. 5 months. In contrast, HA-specific IgG was maintained at low titres throughout the 4 month study period. When the total vaccine antigenic mass was administered asone dose or as equally divided doses pread over several days, pulmonary antibody responses were comparable. Mice immunized intragastrically with whole virus vaccine were completely protected against intranasal challenge with a homologous virulent virus of the H 3 subtype. Partial protection was obtained when the vaccine used for immunization was a distantly related, antigenically variant strain of the same subtype, but no protection was obtained with a monovalent vaccine of an influenza A subtype different to the challenge virus. These characteristics of the response to intragastric mmunization against influenza are consistent with features of a useful vaccine...|$|R
