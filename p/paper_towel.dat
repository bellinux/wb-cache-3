5|$|After tricking {{his wife}} Marge {{into believing that}} {{the model for the}} Burly <b>paper</b> <b>towel</b> {{corporation}} Chad Sexington would have dinner with the Simpsons, Homer takes the family to the Pimento Grove to watch live performers as compensation. One of the acts is a hypnotist called Mesmerino. Homer volunteers, and Mesmerino hypnotizes him into thinking he is twelve years old again. As Homer starts to reminisce, he starts screaming incessantly all through the night. The next day, Homer's co-workers Lenny and Carl bring him home early from work, still screaming. They finally manage to calm him down with some Yaqui tea. He starts to recall the events leading up to the scream-inducing incident. In a flashback, Homer, Lenny, and Carl are hiking in the woods and are confronted by a young Fat Tony, but they are saved by a young Moe.|$|E

50|$|<b>Paper</b> <b>towels</b> are {{a global}} product with rising {{production}} and consumption. Being second in tissue consumption only to toilet paper (36% vs. 45% in the U.S.), {{the proliferation of}} the mostly non-recyclable <b>paper</b> <b>towels</b> has the same globally adverse effects on the environment as indicated in the tissue article. Better alternatives are still conventional towels or - for hand drying - hand dryers. Though <b>paper</b> <b>towels</b> are more efficient, after only ten seconds, <b>paper</b> <b>towels</b> achieve 90% dryness. Hot air dryers, on the other hand, take 40 seconds to achieve a similar dryness.|$|R
50|$|Research {{conducted}} in 2008 indicated that European consumers much prefer hand towels over hand dryers in public washrooms. 63% {{of respondents said}} <b>paper</b> <b>towels</b> were their preferred drying method, while just 28% preferred a hand dryer. Respondents overwhelmingly considered <b>paper</b> <b>towels</b> to offer faster hand drying than electric hand dryers (68% vs 14%). On the whole they also considered <b>paper</b> <b>towels</b> {{to be the most}} hygienic form of hand drying in public washrooms (53% vs 44%).|$|R

25|$|Where possible, a {{cleaned and}} freshly oiled Dutch oven should {{be stored in}} a clean, dry {{location}} with the lid ajar or off to promote air circulation and to avoid the smell and taste of rancid oil. If the Dutch oven must be stored with the lid on, a <b>paper</b> <b>towel</b> or piece of newspaper should be placed inside the oven to absorb any moisture.|$|E
5000|$|Tissue {{products}} in North American, including <b>paper</b> <b>towels,</b> {{can be divided}} into [...] "consumer" [...] and [...] "commercial" [...] markets, with household consumer usage accounting for approximately two thirds of total North American consumption. Commercial usage, or otherwise any use outside of the North American household, accounts for one third of North American consumption. [...] The growth in commercial use of <b>paper</b> <b>towels</b> {{can be attributed to the}} migration from folded towels (in public bathrooms, for example) to roll towel dispensers, which reduces the amount of <b>paper</b> <b>towels</b> used by each patron.|$|R

25|$|It is {{possible}} to grow orange trees directly from seeds, {{but they may be}} infertile or produce fruit that may be different from its parent. For the seed of a commercial orange to grow, it must be kept moist at all times. One approach is placing the seeds between two sheets of damp <b>paper</b> <b>towel</b> until they germinate and then planting them, although many cultivators just set the seeds straight into the soil.|$|E
25|$|A <b>paper</b> <b>towel</b> has {{the same}} {{purposes}} as conventional towels such as drying hands, wiping windows, dusting, cleaning up spills. However, paper towels can only be used once after they blot wet surfaces. A school teacher in Ashland, Ohio, named Kurt Klier, gave students individual paper squares, so that the single towel in the bathroom would not be infected with germs. When Arthur Scott, head of the Scott Paper Company heard about it, he {{decided to try to}} sell a load of paper that had been made too thick to use as toilet paper.|$|E
25|$|Medical hand-washing is for {{a minimum}} of 15 seconds, using generous amounts of soap and water or gel to lather and rub each part of the hands. Hands should be rubbed {{together}} with digits interlocking. If there is debris under fingernails, a bristle brush may be used to remove it. Since germs may remain in the water on the hands, it is important to rinse well and wipe dry with a clean towel. After drying, the <b>paper</b> <b>towel</b> should be used to turn off the water (and open any exit door if necessary). This avoids re-contaminating the hands from those surfaces.|$|E

25|$|Touch {{surfaces}} {{commonly found}} in hospital rooms, such as bed rails, call buttons, keyboards, touch plates, chairs, door handles, light switches, grab rails, intravenous poles, dispensers (alcohol gel, <b>paper</b> <b>towel,</b> soap), dressing trolleys, and counter and table tops {{are known to be}} contaminated with high levels of potentially dangerous bacteria, including Staphylococcus, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), one of the most virulent strains of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE). Objects in closest proximity to patients have the highest levels of Staphylococcus, MRSA, and VRE. This is why touch surfaces in hospital rooms can serve as abundant sources, or reservoirs, for the spread of bacteria from the hands of healthcare workers and visitors to patients.|$|E
500|$|David Hackl, the film's {{production}} designer, {{took three}} weeks to construct 27 sets on a single sound stage. The puppet Billy, used in the series to give instructions to Jigsaw's victims, was originally created by Wan out of <b>paper</b> <b>towel</b> rolls and papier-mâché. Given the larger budget for the sequel, Billy was upgraded with remote-controlled eyes and a servo-driven mouth. In one trap, [...] "The Needle Room", Smith's character Amanda is thrown into a pit of needles to find a key. In order {{for this to be}} done safely, four people, over a period of four days, removed the needle tips from syringes and replaced them with fiber optic tips. They modified a total of 120,000 fake needles. However, this number was insufficient and the pit had to be filled with styrofoam and other materials to make it appear to have more needles. The needles that were apparently stuck into Smith were actually blunted syringes stuck into padding under her clothing. For certain shots, a fake arm was used.|$|E
500|$|M-57 is a rural, two-lane highway {{crossing}} the south central Lower Peninsula. The western terminus is at US131, [...] north of Grand Rapids near Rockford in northern Kent County. East of the terminus is Rosie's Diner, {{which is the}} original shooting location for the Bounty <b>Paper</b> <b>Towel</b> commercials of the 1970s featuring Rosie the Waitress. The diner was moved from Little Ferry, New Jersey to its current location in 1990. From Rockford, M-57 runs east through rural farmland on 14Mile Road into southern Montcalm County. East of the county line, the highway follows Carson City Road into the outskirts of Greenville. M-57 runs through a retail corridor before becoming Washington Street in town where it meets M-91. [...] Washington Street crosses the Flat River and exits Greenville. Continuing eastward, the trunkline passes through more farmland on Carson City Road. It meets M-66 at a rural four-way intersection before passing into Carson City near the Gratiot county line. M-57 follows Cleveland Road, passing {{to the south of}} the communities of Middleton and Perrinton. Near Pompeii, M-57 meets US127 at a folded diamond interchange along the expressway portion of the latter highway.|$|E

500|$|Kira Schlechter in The Patriot-News {{declares}} [...] "The Body" [...] "one of {{the finest}} episodes of any series ever", stating that the silence and novel cinematography are [...] "remarkable and the writing is brilliant". Buffy and Dawn's conversation at her school, Schlechter says, is [...] "positively wrenching". When the series ended in 2003, Amy Antangelo in the Boston Herald and Siona LaFrance of the New Orleans Times-Picayune both rated the best Buffy episodes giving [...] "The Body" [...] equal billing at the top with [...] "Hush" [...] and [...] "Once More, with Feeling", LaFrance designating the episode an [...] "instant classic". Jonathan Last in The Weekly Standard lists [...] "The Body" [...] eighth out of the ten best Buffy episodes, writing that it is [...] "the series' most difficult episode because it's real—and not real in the way ER or The Practice or Law & Order, all hyper-versions of reality, are real. At some point, {{most of us will}} experience a day like Buffy has in 'The Body' and we sense that the writers have gotten nearly every detail of that day—right down to the absence of a musical score—right." [...] In the A.V. Club, Noel Murray also finds small details compelling, such as the camera's focus on the <b>paper</b> <b>towel</b> Buffy uses to cover the vomit on the carpet. He does, however, write that some of the shots [...] "come off a little gimmicky, but the ones that work are so effective that it seems petty to complain that Whedon overdoes it at times. (Besides, different moments are likely to move different people.)" ...|$|E
2500|$|Dana Kennedy, a {{journalist}} and correspondent, profiled Cosby for the Associated Press (AP) in 1992, noting that even though Cosby was {{at the height of}} his success and did not have any measurably negative publicity, he went on at length about [...] "why he mistrusts the press", saying he likes to [...] "control" [...] his interviews. The AP piece reflected more on how uncomfortable the interview was than the substance of the interview itself. In 2014, Kennedy recalled that after the critical AP piece ran, Cosby sent her a cryptic package with a withered piece of fruit wrapped up in a <b>paper</b> <b>towel.</b> She noted that despite her interviews with some of the most notorious celebrities, it was Cosby—during the time of his highest popularity—who stood out as having a [...] "scary" [...] persona, recalling the mysterious package as something that [...] "has always given" [...] her [...] "the creeps". It was her remembrance of [...] "how intimidating and menacing" [...] Cosby was during that experience that led her to believe the stories of the women who were accusing Cosby.|$|E
2500|$|A strong, {{noxious odour}} {{coming from the}} rear of the plane was first {{reported}} to the cabin crew around 19:00. Flight attendant Judi Davidson, 33, traced the odour to the lavatory. She attempted to look into the lavatory but was forced back by thick grey smoke rapidly filling the small room; she then ordered the third ranking crew member to find Sergio Benetti, 37, the chief cabin crew officer, and ask him to investigate. As Benetti sprayed the interior of the affected lavatory with a CO2 extinguisher, Davidson reported the fire to the captain while 28-year-old flight attendant Laura Kayama began urging the passengers on the sparsely-populated flight to come away from the front and rear of the plane and sit close together near the over-wing exits. At no time did any of the cabin crew mention to either Cameron or Ouimet that they had not yet seen flames. [...] Benetti, the one person who had managed to get a good look at the scene, had not reported seeing anything resembling the traditional causes of airline fires in pre-smoking-ban days: flames from a trash bin fire or the <b>paper</b> <b>towel</b> dispenser, both of which were commonly set ablaze by passengers smoking in the lavatories on long flights. First officer Ouimet went to investigate personally at 19:03, but was driven back by the thick smoke. At 19:04, Benetti reported that he thought the fire was probably out because he had completely doused the lavatory with fire retardant.|$|E

2500|$|The three color {{records are}} stacked as shown at right, with a UV filter on top {{to keep the}} {{non-visible}} ultraviolet radiation from exposing the silver-halide crystals, which are naturally sensitive to UV light. [...] Next are the fast and slow blue-sensitive layers, which, when developed, form the latent image. [...] When the exposed silver-halide crystal is developed, it is coupled with a dye grain of its complementary color. [...] This forms a dye [...] "cloud" [...] (like {{a drop of water}} on a <b>paper</b> <b>towel)</b> and is limited in its growth by development-inhibitor-releasing (DIR) couplers, which also serve to refine the sharpness of the processed image by limiting the size of the dye clouds. The dye clouds formed in the blue layer are actually yellow (the opposite or complementary color to blue). [...] There are two layers to each color; a [...] "fast" [...] and a [...] "slow." [...] The fast layer features larger grains that are more sensitive to light than the slow layer, which has finer grain and is less sensitive to light. [...] Silver-halide crystals are naturally sensitive to blue light, so the blue layers are {{on the top of the}} film and they are followed immediately by a yellow filter, which stops any more blue light from passing through to the green and red layers and biasing those crystals with extra blue exposure. [...] Next are the red-sensitive record (which forms cyan dyes when developed); and, at the bottom, the green-sensitive record, which forms magenta dyes when developed. [...] Each color is separated by a gelatin layer that prevents silver development in one record from causing unwanted dye formation in another. On the back of the film base is an anti-halation layer that absorbs light which would otherwise be weakly reflected back through the film by that surface and create halos of light around bright features in the image. In color film, this backing is [...] "rem-jet", a black-pigmented, non-gelatin layer which is removed in the developing process.|$|E
