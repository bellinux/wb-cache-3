Glees costume designer Lou Eyrich {{said in an}} interview with the Seattle Times that Kurt is one of her favorite characters to dress: [...] "He never, ever repeats and you get to <b>push</b> <b>yourself</b> creatively. He's a perfect doll to dress because he'll try on anything." [...] Eyrich sets out to dress Kurt with tailored pieces that [...] "exude his quietly flashy dapper dandyism", mindful that as the son of a car mechanic, [...] "he doesn't have a lot of money".|$|E
500|$|A new visual for the song, {{directed}} by Sophia Peer, was shot on December 2 {{of that year}} in Franklin, Tennessee. Peer stated that she wanted the video to [...] "reflect" [...] the message she retained from the song—"you had to <b>push</b> <b>yourself</b> out of your comfort zone and challenge yourself". She began by brainstorming ideas for the visual, and she talked to Alexandra Young and the video's editor Winston Case, who suggested her the concept of breaking world records. Peer selected 30 records for the band to break, nonetheless, they reduced the number due to the short length of the video shoot. The records selected were picked to match [...] "different sections of the song" [...] and were based on other already-existent records.|$|E

[...] Of the shoot, Osterman {{said that it was}} a [...] "surprisingly emotional experience" [...] and that [...] "even though I was terrified on set at first, I'm glad I did it.

If we didn't have it, we'd be doing crazy things and getting in sticky situations.” –Stephanie Gilmore.|$|R
2500|$|Pull {{motivation}} {{is the opposite}} of push. It is a type of motivation that is much stronger. [...] "Some of the factors are those that emerge {{as a result of the}} attractiveness of a destination as it is perceived by those with the propensity to travel. They include both tangible resources, such as beaches, recreation facilities, and cultural attractions, and traveler's perceptions and expectation, such as novelty, benefit expectation, and marketing image." [...] Pull motivation can be seen as the desire to achieve a goal so badly that it seems that the goal is pulling us toward it. That is why pull {{motivation is}} stronger than push motivation. It is easier to be drawn to something rather than to <b>push</b> <b>yourself</b> for something you desire.|$|E

5000|$|... "And we rationalized {{this whole}} thing by saying, well, what the devil, life {{is nothing but a}} round of {{cocktail}} parties and manoeuvering and much paranoia of <b>pushing</b> <b>yourself,</b> and -- let's be honest, the heck with it, let's paint when we feel like it and as we feel it, without any commercial intent at all; and let's make our money otherwise." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I had {{to learn}} to be honest with myself. I had to {{recognize}} my pain threshold. When I hit the floor, I have to realize it's not as if I broke a bone. <b>Pushing</b> <b>yourself</b> over the barrier is a habit. I know I can do it and try something else crazy. If you want to win the war, you've got to pay the price." ...|$|R
50|$|This {{is when a}} brand {{encompasses}} a consistent set of traits in which the consumer can relate (Cohen, 2014). For example, Crossfit is a lifestyle brand which encompasses the idea of <b>pushing</b> <b>yourself</b> for your fitness. This idea is consistent on a global level. Through this lifestyle, consumers or participants {{have the opportunity to}} feel a {{part of a group of}} healthy, motivated fitness fanatics (Qing, Rong & Xiaobing, 2015).|$|R

But the long and the short of the thing is this; most men circumstanced as you are have no chance of doing {{anything}} good till they are forty or fifty, and then their energies are worn out. You have had tact enough to <b>push</b> <b>yourself</b> up early, and yet it seems you have not pluck {{enough to take the}} goods the gods provide you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your cricket {{is not a}} {{bad thing}} for you," [...] the elder of the two men said. [...] "It brings you into notice, and will help you to get your stripes earlier than you {{otherwise}} would do; as a man who does his regiment credit either as a good shot or as a cricketer or in the sports is sure to attract notice, and to be pushed on if he is steady and a smart soldier. If you won't mind my giving you a bit of advice, I should say don't try to <b>push</b> <b>yourself</b> forward. Sometimes young fellows spoil their chances by doing so. Some of the old non-commissioned officers feel a bit jealous when they see a youngster likely to make his way up, and you know they can make it very hot for a fellow if they like. So be careful not to give them a chance. Even if you are blown up when you do not deserve it, it is better to hold your tongue than to kick against it. Cheeking a non-commissioned officer never pays." ...|$|E

50|$|These same {{researchers}} {{published a}} second paper in 2007, which provided four dimensions (categories) for mental toughness attributes. One general dimension was outlined: a performer's attitude or mindset (specifically, the performer's focus and self-belief). Three time-specific dimensions were outlined: training, competition, and post-competition. These time-specific dimensions contain attributes of mental toughness (such as handling pressure, handling failure and <b>pushing</b> <b>yourself</b> to your physical limit in training) that pertain to their use at these times.|$|R
5000|$|Hutchison {{subsequently}} {{announced plans}} to head to Crail, Fife to write material for the band's third studio album: [...] The theme I'm going for is <b>pushing</b> <b>yourself</b> out {{to the edge of}} things and being alone, feeling lost and not knowing where you are, which is how I've felt recently. It's not all fun and games, but hopefully it'll just be less obviously personal and brutal than the last record. Less oppressive.|$|R
500|$|While {{other films}} {{tend to use}} only one {{storyboard}} artist, Jumper required six, who each worked on an individual action sequence. The artists were given specific instruction on {{the rules of the}} teleportation used in the film, to ensure accuracy in the storyboarding. One of them, Rob McCallum, reflected on the instructions: [...] "I was just thinking, 'How would a guy that can teleport fight?' So you were really <b>pushing</b> <b>yourself</b> to try to think of inventive, cool, spectacular ways that you could use this jumping talent that these characters have." ...|$|R
5000|$|Cohen won {{the boys}} under-18 single scull {{event at the}} New Zealand Secondary School Rowing Championships in 2003, while {{attending}} James Hargest High School.

5000|$|Another {{product of}} the system is the long and torturous {{training}} sessions, for which Rudić is also famous. It includes 8 hours a day of swimming in the pool, heavy style weight lifting sessions, leg work, and skill and tactical sessions. United States player Layne Beaubien recalls that in the American colleges a daily norm was 3,000 meters, while under Rudić initially 5,000 and later up to 18,000 meters, noting [...] "it's all mental. That's all it is. That's why he makes us do it. Being able to <b>push</b> <b>yourself</b> when you're so tired, being able to <b>push</b> <b>yourself</b> to the next level". As Ricardo Azevedo noted, [...] "if a player quits in practice, he will eventually quit in a game". Dettamanti considered that such methods are unnecessary for the international water polo, and that Rudić's success is rather the result of his game knowledge, teaching of skills and tactics.|$|E
50|$|The {{most popular}} method in grass surfing {{is to find}} an old {{skateboard}} deck and remove the trucks and other hardware. Next find a mildly steep hill of dry grass, gravel, dirt, sand, etc. While standing on the skateboard deck in a crouched position {{at the top of}} the hill, <b>push</b> <b>yourself</b> and gain speed, gradually assuming a more natural standing position.|$|E

Like, I mean, just because, for me, skateboarding was never about just progression; it was about, like, the individual, and the person, {{and what they}} brought to, to skateboarding. Not many skaters could have a career {{as long as he}} has and still {{maintain}} that idea, you know? Like, still, he is skateboarding; that is, everything, is Mark—it's freedom; it's not caring about anything; it's about going on your board and enjoying yourself; <b>pushing</b> <b>yourself</b> physically, mentally, and having as much fun as you can possibly have. That's what skateboarding is and that's what Mark is.|$|R
5000|$|In {{researching the}} 2002 Winter Olympics, NBC News' Domenico Montanaro posited that Romney {{had made a}} similar {{statement}} during his speech during those games' opening ceremony, where he said: Tonight we cheer the Olympians, who only yesterday were children themselves.

We salute you Olympians - both because you dreamed and because you paid the price to make your dreams real. You guys <b>pushed</b> <b>yourself,</b> drove yourself, sacrificed, trained and competed time and again at winning and losing.You Olympians, however, know you didn't get here solely on your own power. For most of you, loving parents, sisters or brothers, encouraged your hopes, coaches guided, communities built venues in order to organize competitions.

5000|$|In {{regards to}} the title track and the message behind the album/song, Tiffany {{explained}} [...] "When New Kids On The Block started opening for me on {{the first round of}} the tour, I think that opened my eyes a lot, too, because I saw so much how they would nurture their ideas rather than squash them.

But where have you learned that, seeing that I have {{inherited}} twenty million sesterces?[207] I am happier in this than you. No one but a friend has made me his heir.

[...] "Did he know of you whether you were a white man or a negro? * * * Would you mind telling me what height Turselius stood?" [...] Here he names another of whose property Antony is supposed to have obtained possession illegally. [...] "I believe all you know of him is what farms he had. * * * Do you bear in mind," [...] he says, [...] "that you were a bankrupt as soon as you had become a man? Do you remember your early friendship with Curio, and the injuries you did his father?" [...] Here it is impossible to translate literally, but after speaking as he had done very openly, he goes on: [...] "But I must omit the iniquities of your private life. There are things I cannot repeat here. You are safe, because the deeds you have done are too bad to be mentioned. But let us look at the affairs of your public life. I will just go through them;" [...] which he does, laying bare as he well knew how to do, every past act. [...] "When you had been made Quæstor you flew at once to Cæsar. You knew that he was the only refuge for poverty, debt, wickedness, and vice. Then, when you had gorged upon his generosity and your plunderings--which indeed you spent faster than you got it--you betook yourself instantly to the Tribunate. * * * It is you, Antony, you who supplied Cæsar with an excuse for invading his country." [...] Cæsar had declared at the Rubicon that the Tribunate had been violated in the person of Antony. [...] "I will say nothing here against Cæsar, though nothing can excuse a man for taking up arms against his country. But of you it has to be confessed that you were the cause. * * * He has been a very Helen to us Trojans. * * * He has brought back many a wretched exile, but has forgotten altogether his own uncle"--Cicero's colleague in the Consulship, who had been banished for plundering his province. [...] "We have seen this Tribune of the people carried through the town on a British war-chariot. His lictors with their laurels went before him. In the midst, on an open litter, was carried an actress. When you come back from Thessaly with your legions to Brundisium you did not kill me! Oh, what a kindness! * * * You with those jaws of yours, with that huge chest, with that body like a gladiator, drank so much wine at Hippea's marriage that in the sight of all Rome you were forced to vomit.* * * When he had seized Pompey's property he rejoiced like some stage-actor who in a play is as poor as Poverty, and then suddenly becomes rich. All his wine, the great weight of silver, the costly furniture and rich dresses, in a few days where were they all? A Charybdis do I call him? He swallowed them all like an entire ocean!" [...] Then he accuses him of cowardice and cruelty in the Pharsalian wars, and compares him most injuriously with Dolabella. [...] "Do you remember how Dolabella fought for you in Spain, when you were getting drunk at Narbo? And how did you get back from Narbo? He has asked as to my return to the city. I have explained to you, O conscript fathers, how I had intended to be here in January, so as to be of some service to the Republic. You inquire how I got back. In daylight--not in the dark, as you did; with Roman shoes on and a Roman toga--not in barbaric boots and an old cloak.* * * When Cæsar returned from Spain you again <b>pushed</b> <b>yourself</b> into his intimacy--not a brave man, we should say, but still strong enough for his purposes. Cæsar did always this--that if there were a man ruined, steeped in debt, up to his ears in poverty--a base, needy, bold man--that was the man whom he could receive into his friendship." [...] This as to Cæsar was undoubtedly true. [...] "Recommended in this way, you were told to declare yourself Consul." [...] Then he describes the way in which he endeavored to prevent the nomination of Dolabella to the same office. Cæsar had said that Dolabella should be Consul, but when Cæsar was dead this did not suit Antony. When the tribes had been called in their centuries to vote, Antony, not understanding what form of words he ought to have used as augur to stop the ceremony, had blundered.
