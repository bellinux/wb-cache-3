40|$|Celiac artery {{compression}} syndrome (CACS) or median arcuate ligament (MAL) {{syndrome is}} a rare vascular disease. The clinical manifestations of CACS include the triad of <b>postprandial</b> pain, <b>vomiting,</b> and weight loss. The pathogenesis of CACS is the external compression of celiac artery by the MAL or celiac ganglion. Moreover, some authors also reported the compression with different etiologies, such as neoplasms of pancreatic head, adjacent duodenal carcinoma, vascular aneurysms, aortic dissection, or sarcoidosis. In the literature, most cases of CACS were reported from Western countries. In contrast, this disease was seldom reported in Oriental countries or regions, including Taiwan. Superior mesenteric artery syndrome (SMAS) is also a rare disease characterized by compression of the third portion of the duodenum by the SMA. The clinical features of SMAS are <b>postprandial</b> pain, <b>vomiting,</b> and weight loss. To date, there are no guidelines to ensure the proper treatment of patients with CACS because of its low incidence. Thus, tailored therapy for patients with CACS remains a challenge {{as well as the}} prediction of clinical response and prognosis. The aim of our present study was to investigate the clinical features, the association with SMAS, treatments, and outcomes of patients with CACS in a single institution in Taiwan...|$|R

40|$|Context: Gangliocytic paragangliomas are {{unusual and}} often {{misunderstood}} tumors that occur {{almost exclusively in}} the second portion of the duodenum, although they have been described in other sites such as the urinary bladder, spermatic cord, prostate, urethra, uterus and scalp. We describe our experience with the surgical management of an endoscopically unresectable gangliocytic paraganglioma located in the third part of the duodenum causing a partial upper gastrointestinal obstruction. Case Report: A fifty-two-year-old male presented to the Geisinger clinic with a four-year history of <b>postprandial</b> projectile <b>vomiting</b> associated with epigastric discomfort. Computed tomography scan revealed an oval-shaped filling defect in the third part of the duodenum. Endoscopic ultrasonography showed a 22 x 16 x 35 mm submucosal mass that was not amenable to an endoscopic resection. Exploratory laparotomy revealed an absence of extraduodenal involvement. A long-stalked tumor was successfully excised and extruded through a longitudinal duodenotomy. The pathology report showed a gangliocytic paraganglioma with negative lymph nodes. Conclusions: In patients presenting with prolonged recurrent attacks of vomiting, diagnostic workup to exclude anatomic causes is mandatory. Gangliocytic paraganglioma {{must be considered in}} the differential diagnosis of an intraduodenal tumor...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Diabetic gastroparesis (DGP), or slow {{emptying}} of the stomach, is {{a well-established}} complication of diabetes mellitus and is typically considered {{to occur in}} individuals with long-standing type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Clinical consequences of DGP include induction of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms (early satiety, abdominal distension, reflux, stomach spasm, <b>postprandial</b> nausea, <b>vomiting),</b> alteration in drug absorption, and destabilization of glycemic control (due to mismatched postprandial glycemic and insulin peaks). Effective nutritional management not only helps in alleviating the symptoms, but also in facilitating better glycemic control. Although {{there have been no}} evidence-based guidelines pertaining to the nutrition care process of the DGP, the current dietary recommendations are based on expert opinions or observational studies. The dietary management of gastroparesis needs to be tailored according to the severity of malnutrition and kind of upper GI symptom by changing the volume, consistency, frequency, fiber, fat, and carbohydrates in the meal. Small frequent meals, using more liquid calories, reducing high fat or high fiber, consuming bezoar forming foods, and adjusting meal carbohydrates based on medications or insulin helps in improving the upper GI symptoms and glycemic control. Enteral nutrition can be an option for patients wh...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{most common}} cause of gastric outlet {{obstruction}} in neonates and infants is hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. Pyloric web as a cause of gastric outlet obstruction is relatively rare in children and presents with non_bilious vomiting, abdominal pain and failure to thrive.

However, esophageal manometric study disclosed normal peristalsis of the esophagus, not suggestive of a typical feature of achalasia. Abdominal computed tomography scan demonstrated a hypovascular tumor in the left lobe of the liver, extending to the gastroesophageal junction and proximal lesser curve of the stomach.

These symptoms can be disabling and are frequently unresponsive to drug therapy. Fifteen patients with documented PGS, including 13 women and two men, were recently treated by completion gastrectomy (CG) over a 5 -year period. Gastric emptying study (GES) was markedly prolonged in 12 of the patients studied, and improved partially in only one patient (8 %) with the administration of metoclopramide alone or combined with other gastrokinetic drugs. Patients were evaluated {{both before and after}} surgery, using a modified Visick rating system and a severity of symptoms (SS) score based on seven gastrointestinal (G. I.) and five systemic variables. All 15 patients underwent CG and reconstruction with a 50 cm Roux-en-Y limb. There were no operative deaths or complications related to the esophagojejunal anastomosis. Mean postoperative follow-up was 13. 9 months, with a range of 2 - 65 months. After CG, the Visick rating and overall SS score improved significantly. The improvement in SS score was primarily due to a significant decrease in G.
