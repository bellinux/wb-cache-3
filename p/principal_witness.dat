Adams told Morris that he had been framed, and that David Harris, who was present {{at the time of the}} murder and was the <b>principal</b> <b>witness</b> for the prosecution, had in fact killed Wood. Morris began researching the case because it related to Dr. Grigson. He was at first unconvinced of Adams's innocence.

The trial began November 14, 1921, in the city courthouse in San Francisco. Arbuckle's defense lawyer was Gavin McNab, a professional and competent local attorney that Arbuckle hired as his lead defense counsel. The <b>principal</b> <b>witness</b> was Ms. Zey Prevon, a guest at the party. At {{the beginning of the}} trial Arbuckle told his already-estranged wife, Minta Durfee, that he did not harm Rappe; she believed him and appeared regularly in the courtroom to support him.

5000|$|On 3 February 1743 the Irish House of Lords {{assembled}} to try Lord Netterville, who pleaded not guilty. The trial {{was something of}} an anti-climax, since the Crown explained that the two <b>principal</b> <b>witnesses</b> for the prosecution had died, and the law of evidence did not permit their depositions to be read. In the circumstances his peers had no hesitation in finding him [...] "Not Guilty".|$|R
25|$|The {{day after}} the homicides, {{a number of people}} were arrested in {{connection}} to the crime, including Noel Dillon. The arrests were not made under anti-terrorist legislation and the suspects were all released unconditionally the same evening. On 27 February 2000, Stephen Brown was brought before the Armagh magistrate's court after he was charged with both murders. The police told the court they had plenty of forensic evidence connecting him to the homicides. Ten months later, Brown was released on bail after the court was told the prosecution had expressed doubts about their <b>principal</b> <b>witness</b> and the forensic evidence was not sufficient to secure a conviction. On 6 February 2001, the charges against Brown were unexpectedly dropped by the Director of Public Prosecutions. In April 2001, Mark Burcombe was arrested under the Prevention of Terrorism Acts in relation to his UVF activities, but was released without charge.|$|E

50|$|The {{time and}} place of authorship are disputed, but since Clement of Alexandria used the book {{in the last quarter}} of the second century, it {{consequently}} predates 200 AD. Its place of origin might be Alexandria, Egypt since two of its <b>principal</b> <b>witnesses,</b> Clement and Origen, were Alexandrians. However, the original language of the Gospel of the Nazarenes was Hebrew, suggesting that it was written specifically for Hebrew-speaking Jewish Christians in Palestine, Syria, and contingencies.|$|R
50|$|Théophile Bidard (11 March 1804, in Rennes - 23 October 1877) was a {{well-known}} law professor in Rennes, France during the 1840s and 1850s.

2500|$|Federal {{extradition}} hearings {{were held}} to compel the six indicted men to come from Michigan to Illinois for trial. During the hearings, <b>principal</b> <b>witness</b> Sidney Jenks, president of the shipbuilding company that built Eastland, testified that her first owners wanted a fast ship to transport fruit, and he designed one capable of making [...] and carrying 500 passengers. Defense counsel Clarence Darrow asked whether he had ever worried about {{the conversion of the}} ship into a passenger steamer with a capacity of 2,500 or more passengers. Jenks replied, [...] "I {{had no way of knowing}} the quantity of its business after it left our yards... No, I did not worry about the Eastland." [...] Jenks testified that an actual stability test of the ship never occurred, and stated that after tilting to an angle of 45° at launching, [...] "it righted itself as straight as a church, satisfactorily demonstrating its stability." ...|$|E
2500|$|Barnett {{joined the}} faculty of Columbia University as {{professor}} of government in 1961. In 1966 he was a <b>principal</b> <b>witness</b> for an extensive Congressional review of China policy conducted by Senator J. William Fulbright, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. At that time China was regarded primarily as an enemy, particularly for its support of North Vietnamese expansion. China was feared as a revolutionary force seeking to topple democratic governments, which would fall like a row of dominoes. Barnett told the committee that China's initial reaction to American overtures was [...] "almost certain to be negative and hostile and that any changes in our posture will create some new problems, but ... initiatives on our part clearly are required {{if we are to}} work, however slowly, toward the long term goal of a more stable, less explosive situation in Asia and to explore the possibilities of trying to moderate Peking's policies." [...] In 1969, Barnett moved to the School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) at the Johns Hopkins University, where he remained until he retired in 1989.|$|E
2500|$|The {{circumstances}} in which the trial took place were unusual in that, while Lever’s legal team were accommodated at Thornton Manor, Lord Northcliffe, the <b>principal</b> <b>witness</b> for the defence, was overseas and, according to Jolly, “had no intention of returning within range of any writ server while the case was on.” It seems clear, therefore, that Northcliffe {{was in the wrong}} and, moreover, he knew that he would most probably lose the case: he reportedly offered Lever a public apology shortly {{before the start of the}} trial. For the plaintiff, Carson accused Associated Newspapers of conduction a malicious campaign ‘with the object of smashing up Lever Brothers.’ Speaking for more than five hours, he listed a number of complaints and asked the jury to award punitive damages. He then called Lever as his first witness, inviting the leader of the defence team to [...] "cross-examine him to his heart's content, and, when his time comes, I hope he will be able to follow my example and do the same, and call as his first witness his own client, Lord Northcliffe..." ...|$|E

2500|$|In United States v.

Noting that prior statements of a witness that [...] "relate generally to the events and activities testified to" [...] by him must be produced in the Jencks Act, the court said that since the statement in question related to the subject matter as to which the witness had testified, the statute left no room for the trial court, nor for the present court, to speculate as to how useful this statement would be for purposes of cross-examination or how important such cross-examination would be to the defendant's case.|$|E
2500|$|Kelly began {{associating with}} bushranger Harry Power. According to The Singleton Argus, on 16 March 1870, Power and Kelly stuck up and robbed a Mr McBean. Later that year on 2 May, Kelly {{was charged with}} robbery in company and accused of being Power's accomplice. The victims could not {{identify}} Kelly and the charges were dismissed. He was then charged with armed robbery, but the <b>principal</b> <b>witness</b> could not be located and the charges were dismissed. He was then charged a third time, for a hold-up with Power against a man named Murray. Although the victims for the third charge {{were reported to have}} also failed to identify Kelly, they had in fact been refused a chance to identify him by Superintendents Nicolas and Hare. Instead, Superintendent Nicolas told the magistrate that Kelly fitted the description and asked for him to be remanded to the Kyneton court for trial. Instead of being sent to Kyneton, he was sent to Melbourne where he spent the weekend in the Richmond lock-up before transferring to Kyneton. No evidence was produced in court, and he was released after a month. Historians tend to disagree over this episode: Some see it as evidence of police harassment; others believe that the Kelly family intimidated the witnesses, making them reluctant to give evidence. Another factor in the lack of identification may have been that the witnesses had described Power's accomplice as a [...] "half-caste". However, Superintendent Nicolas and Captain Standish believed this {{to be the result of}} Kelly going unwashed.|$|E
2500|$|During Easter of 1948, Timothy Evans and {{his wife}} Beryl moved into the top-floor flat at Rillington Place, where Beryl gave birth that October to their daughter, Geraldine. In late 1949, Evans {{informed}} police {{that his wife was}} dead. A police search of 10Rillington Place failed to find her body, but a later search revealed the bodies of Beryl Evans, her daughter, Geraldine, and a 16-week-old male foetus in an outdoor wash-house. Beryl's body had been wrapped twice over in a blanket and then a table cloth. The post-mortem revealed that both mother and daughter had been strangled and that Beryl Evans had been physically assaulted before her death, shown by facial bruising. Evans at first claimed that Christie had killed his wife in a botched abortion operation, but police questioning eventually produced a confession. The alleged confession may have been fabricated by the police themselves, as the statement appears contrived and artificial. After being charged Evans withdrew his confession and once again accused Christie, this time of both murders. On 11January 1950, Evans was put on trial for the murder of his daughter, the prosecution having decided not to pursue a second charge of murdering his wife. Christie was a <b>principal</b> <b>witness</b> for the Crown and gave evidence denying Evans's accusations. The jury found Evans guilty despite the revelation of Christie's criminal record of theft and violence, and, after an appeal on 20 February had failed, Evans was hanged at Pentonville Prison on 9 March 1950. (Christie himself lost the job he had held for four years at the Post Office Savings Bank due to the disclosure of his criminal convictions at the trial.) ...|$|E

The prisoners were charged with having conspired to kill King Charles II and subvert the Protestant religion. They defended themselves by the testimony of their own witnesses and their cross-examinations of their accusers.

50|$|Jeanette Abadie (or l'Abadie) (born c. 1593) was a {{young woman}} of the village of Ciboure in Gascony, France, who was {{supposedly}} lured into witchcraft {{and was one of the}} <b>principal</b> <b>witnesses</b> concerning the supposed practices of the witches' Sabbath. Her account of the Sabbath was contained in the narrative of Pierre de Lancre, a royal councillor of Bordeaux, who made an exhaustive study of witchcraft after being appointed in 1609 to a commission to try people accused of it, apparently including the then sixteen-year-old Jeanette.|$|R
40|$|The {{text of the}} Epistle to the Hebrews {{has been}} {{transmitted}} since the early second century {{as part of the}} corpus Paulinum. The earliest extant copy of the epistle belongs to the earliest extant copy of the corpus, p 46 (ca. A. D. 200), where it appears between Romans and 1 Corinthians. At what point in the second century Hebrews was first included in the corpus cannot be determined. One scholar indeed has argued that it was in the corpus from the beginning (Anderson 1966); Zuntz, however (1953 : 15 - 16), had already shown adequate reason to believe that this cannot have been so, since Christian writers early in the second century who apparently knew the Pauline corpus as such betray no acquaintance with Hebrews. That all surviving copies of Hebrews go back to one archetype, the edition which was originally admitted to the Pauline corpus, is suggested by their having a number of errors in common, including a few primitive corruptions which were taken over into the corpus. The text of the twelve passages discussed below is taken from UBS 3; at the head of each discussion this text is reproduced with its <b>principal</b> <b>witnesses,</b> followed by one or more variant readings with their <b>principal</b> <b>witnesses...</b>|$|R
