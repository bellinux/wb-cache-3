25|$|Court {{cases in}} recent years have {{addressed}} the legality of Taser use by police officers. In Bryan v. MacPherson, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that a Taser had been used in a way that constituted excessive force and hence a violation of the Fourth Amendment. In the latter case Mattos v. Agarano, the same Court of Appeals found that in two situations involving Taser use, one in Drive Stun and one in dart mode, officers had used excessive force. According to an article in Police Chief magazine, this decision implies guidelines for the use of Tasers and other Electronic Control Devices in gaining compliance (in a setting where safety is not an issue), including that the officer must give warning before each application, and that the suspect must be capable of compliance, with enough time to consider a warning, and to recover from the extreme pain of any <b>prior</b> <b>application</b> of the Taser; and that Tasers must not be used on children, the elderly, and women who are visibly pregnant or inform the officer of their pregnancy.|$|E
2500|$|Some visas can {{be granted}} on arrival or by <b>prior</b> <b>application</b> at the country's embassy or consulate, {{or through a}} private visa service {{specialist}} who is specialized in the issuance of international travel documents. [...] These agencies are authorized by the foreign authority, embassy, or consulate to represent international travelers who are {{unable or unwilling to}} travel to the embassy and apply in person. Private visa and passport services collect an additional fee for verifying customer applications, supporting documents, and submitting them to the appropriate authority. If there is no embassy or consulate in one's home country, then one would have to travel to a third country (or apply by post) and try to get a visa issued there. Alternatively, in such cases visas may be pre-arranged for collection on arrival at the border. The need or absence of need of a visa generally depends on the citizenship of the applicant, the intended duration of the stay, and the activities that the applicant may wish to undertake in the country he visits; these may delineate different formal categories of visas, with different issue conditions.|$|E

50|$|The pain of an {{injection}} may be lessened by <b>prior</b> <b>application</b> of ice or topical anesthetic, or simultaneous pinching of the skin. Recent {{studies suggest that}} forced coughing during {{an injection}} stimulates a transient rise in blood pressure which inhibits the perception of pain. Sometimes, as with an amniocentesis, a local anesthetic is given. The most common technique to reduce the pain of an injection is simply to distract the patient.|$|E

50|$|Finally, adding {{appropriate}} multiples of row t, it can {{be achieved}} that all entries in column jt except for that at position (t,jt) are zero. This {{can be achieved by}} left-multiplication with an appropriate matrix. However, to make the matrix fully diagonal we need to eliminate nonzero entries on the row of position (t,jt) as well. This can be achieved by repeating the steps in Step II for columns instead of rows, and using multiplication on the right by the transpose of the obtained matrix L. In general this will result in the zero entries from the <b>prior</b> <b>application</b> of Step III becoming nonzero again.|$|E

50|$|If it is {{ultimately}} adjudicated {{that a state}} may not rescind a <b>prior</b> <b>application,</b> then Ohio's 2013 application {{for a balanced budget}} amendment convention would be the 33rd and Michigan's 2014 application would be the 34th (out of the necessary 34) on that topic, rather than the 20th and 22nd, respectively. The balanced budget amendment applications by Ohio and Michigan were new, first-time convention applications, whereas the renewed applications from Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Tennessee, South Dakota, and Utah simply reprised applications made by those states during the 1970s but which had been rescinded during the period between 1988 and 2010.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the case}} of {{operating}} systems and computer server software, patches have the particularly important role of fixing security holes. Some critical patches involve issues with drivers. [...] Patches may require <b>prior</b> <b>application</b> of other patches, or may require prior or concurrent updates of several independent software components. To facilitate updates, operating systems often provide automatic or semi-automatic updating facilities. Completely automatic updates have not succeeded in gaining widespread popularity in corporate computing environments, {{partly because of the}} aforementioned glitches, but also because administrators fear that software companies may gain unlimited control over their computers. Package management systems can offer various degrees of patch automation.|$|E
50|$|One-day-visas for East Berlin {{were now}} issued in a speeded up procedure; visas for longer stays and visas for East Germany proper needed a <b>prior</b> <b>{{application}},</b> {{which could be}} a lengthy procedure. To ease the application for West Berliners seeking such Eastern visas, the GDR Foreign Ministry was later allowed to open Offices for the Affairs of Visits and Travelling (link=no) in West Berlin, but {{were not allowed to}} show any official symbols of East Germany. The Eastern officials working commuted every morning and evening between East and West Berlin. Their uniforms showed no official symbols except the name Büro für Besuchs- und Reiseangelegenheiten. They accepted visa applications and handed out confirmed visas issued in the East to the West Berlin applicants. A shed formerly housing one such Büro für Besuchs- und Reiseangelegenheiten can be found on Waterlooufer 5-7 in Berlin-Kreuzberg, close to Hallesches Tor underground station.
