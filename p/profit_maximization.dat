25|$|Of great {{importance}} {{in the theory of}} marginal cost is the distinction between the marginal private and social costs. The marginal private cost shows the cost associated to the firm in question. It is the marginal private cost that is used by business decision makers in their <b>profit</b> <b>maximization</b> goals. Marginal social cost is similar to private cost in that it includes the cost of private enterprise but also any other cost (or offsetting benefit) to society to parties having no direct association with purchase or sale of the product. It incorporates all negative and positive externalities, of both production and consumption. Examples might include a social cost from air pollution affecting third parties or a social benefit from flu shots protecting others from infection.|$|E

With a base price of $1,808 (equivalent to approximately $ in today's funds), the Nash Rambler was priced slightly lower than the base convertible models from its intended competition. To further increase the value to buyers, the Nash Rambler was well equipped compared to the competition and included numerous items as standard equipment such as whitewall tires, full wheel covers, electric clock, and even a pushbutton AM radio that were available at extra cost on all other cars at that time.|$|E

2500|$|Martin Shubik {{developed}} the Bertrand–Edgeworth model [...] {{to allow for}} the firm to be willing to supply only up to its profit maximizing output at the price which it set (under <b>profit</b> <b>maximization</b> this occurs when marginal cost equals price). [...] He considered the case of strictly convex costs, where marginal cost is increasing in output. Shubik showed that if a Nash equilibrium exists, it must be the perfectly competitive price (where demand equals supply, and all firms set price equal to marginal cost). However, this can only happen if market demand is infinitely elastic (horizontal) at the competitive price. In general, as in the Edgeworth paradox, no pure-strategy Nash equilibrium will exist. Huw Dixon showed that in general a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium will exist when there are convex costs. [...] Dixon’s proof used the Existence Theorem of Partha Dasgupta and Eric Maskin. [...] Under Dixon's assumption of (weakly) convex costs, marginal cost will be non-decreasing. [...] This is consistent with a cost function where marginal cost is flat for a range of outputs, marginal cost is smoothly increasing, or indeed where there is a kink in total cost so that marginal cost makes a discontinuous jump upwards.|$|E
2500|$|This vision {{produces}} a core proposition in textbook neoclassical economics, i.e., that the income earned by each [...] "factor of production" [...] (essentially, labor and [...] "capital") {{is equal to}} its marginal product. Thus, with perfect product and input markets, the wage (divided by {{the price of the}} product) is alleged to equal the marginal physical product of labor. More importantly for the discussion here, the rate of profit (sometimes confused with the rate of interest, i.e., the cost of borrowing funds) is supposed to equal the marginal physical product of capital. (For simplicity, abbreviate [...] "capital goods" [...] as [...] "capital.") A second core proposition is that a change in the price of a factor of production will lead to a change in the use of that factor [...] an increase in the rate of profit (associated with falling wages) will lead to more of that factor being used in production. The law of diminishing marginal returns implies that greater use of this input will imply a lower marginal product, all else equal: since a firm is getting less from adding a unit of capital goods than is received from the previous one, the rate of profit must increase to encourage the employment of that extra unit, assuming <b>profit</b> <b>maximization.</b>|$|E
