5|$|By {{the fall}} of 1918, the couple's {{popularity}} resulted in their being invited {{to set up a}} children's theater in line with the government's socialist restructuring policy. Her husband arranged for the theater in the Mamonovski Passage to be dedicated to puppet productions. By focusing on children's productions, the Efimovs avoided government pressure to perform communist-oriented themes. Simonovich-Efimova developed glove puppets and shadow puppets to re-enact fables and fairy tales based on the works of Krylov and Hans Christian Andersen. They included adaptations of traditional themes such as the Mena stories, Baba Yaga, Shrovetide, and Nikolay Nekrasov's Peasant Children. In a second theater, they staged marionette productions. The Effimovs put on twenty shows per month for the next eight months, while simultaneously performing with their traveling theater. The theater in the Mamonovski Passage then closed, marking their last engagement in a permanent location. For the next six years, the couples' main means of support came from the traveling theater. Between 1916 and 1924, sometimes assisted by their son Adrian, the couple staged around 600 performances. They were able to help <b>people</b> <b>forget</b> the famines and violence of the times. Simonovich-Efimova performed in children's hospitals and mental asylums, contributing to her family's history of philanthropy.|$|E

He knew that in conversations people do often {{interrupt}} one another and it's not always so easy to get a thought out.

25|$|The Book {{describes}} how {{after a long}} period of peace and prosperity, carelessness and excesses within the society make <b>people</b> <b>forget</b> self responsibility, and the need to follow or protect dharma. Infighting between good people begins, ultimately leading to the destruction of the Yadava dynasty. The end comes through a senseless but brutal internecine war, described as a drunken fight, which kills all the Yadavas along with Krishna's human form. The last chapter describes Krishna's ascent to Vaikuntha. Book eleven also includes the so-called Uddhava Gita, the last discourse of Krishna which he addresses to Uddhava. Book 11 section 7-9 discusses the pastimes and realizations of an Avadhuta.|$|E

500|$|Aside from {{promoting}} {{the rights of}} fellow cartoonists, Lat developed an interest in encouraging conservation of the natural environment. [...] Several of his works caricature the consequences of pollution and over-exploitation of resources. [...] Invited {{to give a speech}} at the 9th Osaka International Symposium on Civilisation in 1988, Lat talked about the environmental problems associated with overpopulation and heavy industrialisation. [...] He further reminisced about the simple cleaner life he had enjoyed as a child in the kampung. [...] In 1977, when a protest was organised against logging activities in the Endau-Rompin Reserves, Lat helped gain support for the movement by drawing cartoons in the newspapers that highlighted the issue. [...] Lat is also particularly concerned over what he sees as the negative side of urban development. [...] He believes that such developments have contributed to the loss of the traditional way of life; <b>people</b> <b>forget</b> the old culture and values as they ingratiate themselves with the rapid pace and sophistication of urban lifestyles. [...] His defence and fondness of the old ways are manifested in his The Kampung Boy, Town Boy, Mat Som, and Kampung Boy: Yesterday and Today, which champion the old lifestyles [...] as spiritually superior.|$|E

There's so much focus on the before that <b>people</b> <b>forget</b> there's an after." [...] The frontman said this was helped by the environment - [...] "a lot of retrospection and introspection and nostalgia going back to the way we used to make records" [...] - and working with Vig again, which [...] "made me think a lot about starting over, and rebirth, and making your way through tragedy and coming out the other side." [...] An example was [...] "I Should Have Known", partially inspired by former Nirvana bandmate Kurt Cobain - [...] "a song like 'I Should Have Known' is about all the people I've lost, not just Kurt". Grohl still tried to do laid-back songs such as [...] "White Limo", which had its lyrics written in just two minutes, specially after Mendel sent him an e-mail saying, [...] "I really like it when you write songs that are silly and mean nothing, too.
