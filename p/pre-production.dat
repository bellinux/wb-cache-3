The two <b>pre-production</b> F-4K aircraft were constructed alongside the prototypes, and were initially used for fit check trials of the various systems to be fitted – the first was used for catapult/arrestor and deck landing trials, and the second was primarily for testing the radar and missile systems.

However, when Lasseter was placed in charge of all Disney and Pixar animation following the 2006 merger of the companies, he put all sequels on hold and Toy Story 3 was cancelled. In May 2006, it was announced that Toy Story 3 was back in <b>pre-production</b> with a new plot and under Pixar's control. The film was released on June 18, 2010, as Pixar's eleventh feature film.|$|E

In August 1994, Sean Connery was cast as Don Diego de la Vega, while Salomon stated {{that the rest of the}} major cast would be Hispanic or Latino. <b>Pre-production</b> proceeded even further in August when Salomon compiled test footage for a planned April 1995 start date.|$|E
5|$|Markowitz's {{script was}} bought by New Line Cinema in 2005 and the film spent six years {{in various states of}} <b>pre-production,</b> with a variety of actors {{attached}} to different roles.

5|$|The opening was {{rejected}} as {{too expensive to}} film; Flinn mentioned the exotic locales would have pushed the budget to $50million. While they tried {{to hold on to}} the opening as long as they could, Paramount threatened to cancel <b>pre-production</b> unless a few million dollars were cut from the budget.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} of Skyfall was suspended throughout 2010 because of MGM's financial troubles.

The film's budget {{is estimated to be}} between $150million and $200million, compared to the $200million spent on Quantum of Solace.|$|E
