500|$|Water {{fluoridation}} is {{the controlled}} addition of fluoride {{to a public}} water supply to reduce tooth decay. Fluoridated water contains fluoride {{at a level that}} is effective for preventing cavities; this can occur naturally or by adding fluoride. Fluoridated water operates on tooth surfaces: in the mouth, it creates low levels of fluoride in saliva, which reduces the rate at which tooth enamel demineralizes and increases the rate at which it remineralizes {{in the early stages of}} cavities. Typically a fluoridated compound is added to drinking water, a process that in the U.S. costs an average of about $ per <b>person-year.</b> Defluoridation is needed when the naturally occurring fluoride level exceeds recommended limits. In 2011 the World Health Organization suggested a level of fluoride from 0.5 to 1.5mg/L (milligrams per litre), depending on climate, local environment, and other sources of fluoride. [...] Bottled water typically has unknown fluoride levels.|$|E

5000|$|Fluoridation costs an {{estimated}} $ per <b>person-year</b> {{on the average}} (range: $-$; all costs in this paragraph are for the U.S. and are in [...] dollars, inflation-adjusted from earlier estimates). Larger water systems have lower per capita cost, and the cost is also affected {{by the number of}} fluoride injection points in the water system, the type of feeder and monitoring equipment, the fluoride chemical and its transportation and storage, and water plant personnel expertise. In affluent countries the cost of salt fluoridation is also negligible; developing countries may find it prohibitively expensive to import the fluoride additive. By comparison, fluoride toothpaste costs {{an estimated}} $-$ per <b>person-year,</b> with the incremental cost being zero for people who already brush their teeth for other reasons; and dental cleaning and application of fluoride varnish or gel costs an estimated $ per <b>person-year.</b> Assuming the worst case, with the lowest estimated effectiveness and highest estimated operating costs for small cities, fluoridation costs an estimated $-$ per saved tooth-decay surface, which is lower than the estimated $ to restore the surface and the estimated $ average discounted lifetime cost of the decayed surface, which includes the cost to maintain the restored tooth surface.

50|$|Although a 1989 {{workshop}} on cost-effectiveness of cavity prevention concluded that water fluoridation {{is one of}} the few public health measures that save more money than they cost, little high-quality research has been done on the cost-effectiveness and solid data are scarce. Dental sealants are cost-effective only when applied to high-risk children and teeth. A 2002 U.S. review estimated that on average, sealing first permanent molars saves costs when they are decaying faster than 0.47 surfaces per <b>person-year</b> whereas water fluoridation saves costs when total decay incidence exceeds 0.06 surfaces per <b>person-year.</b> In the U.S., water fluoridation is more cost-effective than other methods to reduce tooth decay in children, and a 2008 review concluded that water fluoridation is the best tool for combating cavities in many countries, particularly among socially disadvantaged groups.

ParticipantsPedestrians age 5 and older. Main outcome measuresdeath rate per <b>person-year,</b> kilometers walked per <b>person-year,</b> collisions per kilometers walked, and deaths per collision by sex. ResultsThe pedestrian death rate per <b>person-year</b> for males was 2. 3 times that for females. This ratio of male to female rates can be expressed as the product of three component ratios: 0. 995 for walking exposure, 1. 191 for collision risk, and 1. 976 for case fatality rate. The relative contributions of these components were 1...|$|E
30|$|The {{estimates}} of herpes zoster ranged between 320 and 410 per 100, 000 <b>person-years</b> [4]. A recent {{study from the}} Pacific region estimates the overall incidence rate of HZO at 30.9 per 100, 000 <b>person-years,</b> which is approximately 10 % of all {{estimates of}} herpes zoster overall [5].|$|R

40|$|CBTRUS) {{obtained}} 5 {{years of}} incidence data (1990 – 1994) —including reports on all primary brain and CNS tumors—from 11 collaborating state cancer reg-istries. Data {{were available for}} 20, 765 tumors located in the brain, meninges, and other CNS sites, including the pituitary and pineal glands. The average annual incidence was estimated at 11. 5 cases per 100, 000 <b>person-years.</b> The higher incidence of tumors in male patients (12. 1 per 100, 000 <b>person-years)</b> than in female patients (11. 0 per 100, 000 <b>person-years)</b> was statistically signicant (P< 0. 05); the higher incidence in whites (11. 6 per 100, 000 <b>person-years)</b> compared with blacks (7. 8 per 100, 000 per-son-years) was statistically signicant (P< 0. 05). The most frequently reported histologies were meningiomas (24. 0 %) and glioblastomas (22. 6 %). Higher rates fo...|$|R
