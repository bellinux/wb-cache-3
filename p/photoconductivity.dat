The minimum distance between chains is 343.6pm. Gray Se is formed by mild heating of other allotropes, by slow cooling of molten Se, or by condensing Se vapor just below the melting point. Whereas other Se forms are insulators, gray Se is a semiconductor showing appreciable <b>photoconductivity.</b> Unlike the other allotropes, it is insoluble in CS2. It resists oxidation by air and is not attacked by nonoxidizing acids. With strong reducing agents, it forms polyselenides. Selenium does not exhibit the changes in viscosity that sulfur undergoes when gradually heated.|$|E

In addition, the PC mechanism has also been studied by the power, environment, and wavelength-dependent measurements. Both the bulk-controlled (hole trapping effect) and surface-controlled (oxygen-sensitization effect) PC mechanisms have been observed under above- and below-bandgap excitations, respectively. Understanding of the transport properties in this layered V 2 O 5 1 D nanostructure could enable us to design the electronic, optoelectronic, and electrochemical devices by a more efficient way.|$|R

Intrinsic photoconduction (PC) efficiency (i.e., normalized gain) of the PVD-grown V 2 O 5 NWs is two orders of magnitude {{higher than that of}} the V 2 O 5 counterpart prepared by hydrothermal approach. In addition, bulk and surface-controlled PC mechanisms have been observed respectively by above- and below-bandgap excitations. The coexistence of hole trapping and oxygen sensitization effects in this layered V 2 O 5 nanostructure is proposed, which is different from conventional metal oxide systems, such as ZnO, SnO 2, TiO 2, and WO 3.|$|R
40|$|Supramolecular {{assembly}} {{can yield}} ordered structures by {{taking advantage of}} the cumulative effect of multiple non-covalent interactions between adjacent molecules. The thermodynamic origin of many self-assembled structures in water is the balance between the hydrophilic and hydrophobic segments of the molecule. Here, we show that this approach can be generalized to use solvophobic and solvophilic segments of fully hydrophobic alkylated fullerene molecules. Addition of n-alkanes results in their assembly—due to the antipathy of C 60 towards n-alkanes—into micelles and hexagonally packed gel-fibres containing insulated C 60 nanowires. The addition of pristine C 60 instead directs the assembly into lamellar mesophases by increasing the proportion of p-conjugated material in the mixture. The assembled structures contain a large fraction of optoelectronically active material and exhibit comparably high <b>photoconductivities.</b> This method is shown to be applicable to several alkyl–pi-conjugated molecules, and can be used to construct organized functional materials with pi-conjugated sections...|$|R

Although device performance of the individual NW has been demonstrated in several studies, fundamental photoconduction (PC) properties and their corresponding surface effects were less studied than the known hopping transport[6, 21 – 24]. The potential difference of the transport properties of nanomaterials grown by different approaches was also less known. In this paper, we report the study of <b>photoconductivities</b> of V 2 O 5 NWs grown by physical vapor deposition (PVD). The performance of the single-NW device and intrinsic PC efficiency of the material have been defined and discussed. The results are also compared with the reported data of the V 2 O 5 counterpart synthesized by hydrothermal approach. The probable PC mechanisms that originated from the bulk and surface under above- and below-bandgap excitations are also proposed.|$|R

This prompted him to conduct experiments with <b>photoconductivity.</b> Carlson experimented with [...] "electrophotography" [...] in his kitchen and in 1938, applied for a patent for the process.

The words [...] "10-22-38 Astoria" [...] were written on a microscope slide, which was placed on top of more sulfur and under a bright light. After the slide was removed, a mirror image of the words remained. Carlson tried to sell his invention to some companies, but because the process was still underdeveloped he failed. At the time multiple copies were made using carbon paper or duplicating machines and people did not feel the need for an electronic machine. Between 1939 and 1944, Carlson was turned down by over 20 companies, including IBM and GE, neither of which believed there was a significant market for copiers.|$|E

The photocurrent (i sub p) increases with increasing light intensity (I), thus satisfying log i varies as n log I. The n values are 0. 5 - 1. 0. When the nitro group is located at the beta-position of the phenazine ring, the photocurrent becomes larger owing to the electron withdrawing property of the nitro group.

They were copolymerized with methyl methacrylate in different monomer ratios. An ABA triblock copolymer was also synthesized with poly(methyl methacrylate) as the macroinitiator. When 2, 2 '-bipyridine was used as the ligand for the copper catalyst in the polymerizations, it underwent a ligand exchange process with the iminopyridine ligand in the monomer. The neutral rhenium complex in the homopolymers and copolymers could be converted into ionic forms by the replacement of the chloride with an imidazole ligand, and the solubility of the resulting ionic polymers was greatly enhanced.

40|$|Hydrogenated {{microcrystalline}} silicon {{has been}} deposited at elevated deposition rates using an expanding thermal plasma for the decomposition of the precursor gas silane (SiH 4). An extensive {{survey of the}} influence of the deposition parameters on the optical, electrical, and structural material properties is carried out. X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy reveal the transition from amorphous to microcrystalline deposition conditions. Reflection-transmission measurements are used to determine the thickness, the refractive index, and the absorption coefficient. Scanning electron microscopy analyses show columnar growth and infrared absorption shows varying oxygen content. It is demonstrated that the best material is obtained when a pure hydrogen plasma, instead of a mixture of Ar and H 2, is used and the precursor gas (SiH 4) is injected into the plasma at about 55 mm above the growing film. The best material properties are obtained when the SiH 4 flow is adjusted such that the material is near the transition of microcrystalline to amorphous silicon.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{characterization}} of six low-T-g poly(N-vinylcarbazole) -based photorefractive (PR) composites sensitized with (2, 4, 7 -trinitro- 9 -fluorenylidene) -malononitrile (TNFM) in different concentrations, ranging from 0 to 3 wt %. At 780 nm, two-beam coupling gain coefficients, four-wave mixing diffraction efficiencies, and <b>photoconductivities</b> were measured versus electric field, writing beam intensity, and temperature. Dynamic measurements pointed out that chromophore reorientation is not rate-limiting {{in any of the}} six samples. In samples with sensitizer concentrations up to 1. 24 wt %, increasing the sensitizer concentration leads to a faster grating buildup through a faster charge generation. The grating buildup in these samples is rate- limited by the photogeneration speed. We provide evidence that the TNFM- anions, formed by photoreduction of TNFM, can act as a trap, similar to what has been observed in C- 60 -sensitized samples. As a result, above 1. 49 wt % of TNFM, the larger amount of traps produced by photoreduction of the sensitizer reduces the mobility of the charges. Then, the grating buildup speed becomes mobility limited, and smaller buildup rates are observed. Except for the sample with 3 wt % TNFM, increased writing beam intensities or sensitizer concentrations give rise to a larger dynamic range. The different behavior of the sample with the largest sensitizer concentration is explained theoretically in terms of the trap density. The PR phase shifts were found to decrease with increasing writing beam intensity or sensitizer concentration. This provides evidence that the PR phase shifts are controlled by the charge mobility rather than by the photogeneration efficiency. PR measurements as a function of temperature and electric field evolve as predicted by theory. (C) 2001 American Institute of Physics. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Microcrystalline silicon (mu c-Si:H) of {{superior}} quality {{can be prepared}} using the hot-wire chemical-vapor deposition method (HWCVD). At a low substrate temperature (T-S) of 185 degrees C excellent material properties and solar cell performance were obtained with spin densities of 6 x 10 (15) cm(- 3) and solar cell efficiencies up to 9. 4 %, respectively. In this study we have systematically investigated the influence of various deposition parameters on the deposition rate and the material properties. For this purpose, thin films and solar cells were prepared at specific substrate and filament temperatures and deposition pressures (p(D)), covering the complete range from amorphous to highly crystalline material by adjusting the silane concentration. The influence of these deposition parameters on the chemical reactions at the filament and in the gas phase qualitatively explains {{the behavior of the}} structural composition and the formation of defects. In particular, we propose that the deposition rate is determined by the production of reactive species at the filament and a particular atomic-hydrogen-to-silicon ratio is found at the microcrystalline/amorphous transition. The structural, optical, and electronic properties were studied using Raman and infrared spectroscopies, optical-absorption measurements, electron-spin resonance, and dark and <b>photoconductivities.</b> These experiments show that higher T-S and p(D) lead to a deterioration of the material quality, i. e., much higher defect densities, oxygen contaminations, and SiH absorption at 2100 cm(- 1).
