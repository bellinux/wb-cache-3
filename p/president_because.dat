5|$|In 1931, the Methodist Church {{helped the}} merger of her school with the boys' Cookman Institute, forming the Bethune-Cookman College, a coeducational junior college. Bethune became president. Through the Great Depression, Bethune-Cookman School {{continued}} to operate, and met the educational standards of the State of Florida. From 1936 to 1942, Bethune had to cut back her time as <b>president</b> <b>because</b> of her duties in Washington, DC. Funding declined {{during this period of}} her absence. But, by 1941 the college had developed a four-year curriculum and achieved full college status. By 1942 Bethune gave up the presidency, as her health was being adversely affected by her many responsibilities.|$|E
5|$|The Union Greenbackers {{held their}} {{convention}} first, meeting in St. Louis in March 1880. Although {{much of the}} young party's leadership remained with the Eastern faction, the March gathering included Solon Chase and Kersey Graves, among other third-party notables. They nominated Stephen D. Dillaye, a New Jersey lawyer and journalist, for President and Barzillai J. Chambers, a Texas merchant and surveyor, for Vice <b>President.</b> <b>Because</b> Dillaye had previously declared he {{was not interested in}} the nomination, many delegates protested, seeing Dillaye as a placeholder for eventual re-unification with the National Greenbackers. Dillaye himself supported reunification, and Pomeroy also urged the delegates to send representatives to the Easterners' convention, which was set for June 1880 in Chicago. The majority agreed with the sentiment, and Union Greenbackers gathered in Chicago along with National Greenbackers as their convention began a few months later.|$|E
25|$|Due to the two-yearly cycle, Amicus {{does not}} have a <b>President,</b> <b>because</b> {{legislation}} requires the position to be elected annually - either by delegates to annual conference, or the entire membership. In view of the cost of a national postal ballot, the Chair of the NEC was given the role of chairing the 2005 Policy and Rules Conferences.|$|E
50|$|It {{is called}} the Church of the <b>Presidents</b> <b>because</b> two American <b>Presidents,</b> John Adams and John Quincy Adams, {{attended}} the church along with their wives, Abigail Adams and Louisa Catherine Adams. All four are interred beneath the church in a family crypt. The pew in which they sat is marked with a plaque and ribbon on the side.|$|R
50|$|The Piney Point Lighthouse {{was built}} in 1836 located at Piney Point on the Potomac River in Maryland just up the river {{from the mouth of}} the Chesapeake Bay. The Coast Guard {{decommissioned}} it in 1964 and it has since become a museum. It is known as the Lighthouse of <b>Presidents</b> <b>because</b> several early US Presidents visited or stayed on the grounds.|$|R
5000|$|The US had well {{established}} methods of intercepting, jailing, and repatriating Haitians {{by the time}} the largest wave of people seeking refuge arrived. These policies were pursued by multiple US <b>presidents</b> <b>because</b> of American anti-Haitian biases that saw Haitian immigrants as a threat based on a combination of racism, nationalism, xenophobia, classism, and misperceptions that Haitians carried disease at higher numbers than other nationalities.|$|R
25|$|Captain Dyson was {{subsequently}} relieved of his command {{and ordered to}} his home in Alexandria. A court martial found him guilty of abandoning his post and destroying government property. He was dismissed from the service, but received no other punishment. The Secretary of War, General Armstrong, was forced to retire and abandon his ambition to become <b>President</b> <b>because</b> of his failure to protect the Capital.|$|E
25|$|In January 2009, the American Humanist Association and {{eighteen}} other nontheistic organizations sent an {{open letter}} to then President-Elect Obama urging him not to serve as the Boy Scouts' honorary <b>president</b> <b>because</b> of the Scouts' positions on religion. Ignoring this, Obama accepted the position of Honorary President and has received the BSA's annual report from groups of Scouts every February from 2009 through 2013.|$|E
25|$|The next day's {{election}} was not postponed, as Taiwanese law only allows for suspension {{of an election}} {{on the death of}} a candidate. Chen's opponent, Lien Chan, and Lien's campaign manager Wang Jin-ping tried to visit Chen {{on the night of the}} incident, but were unable to see the <b>president</b> <b>because</b> he was resting. Chen appeared in public the next day when he turned out to cast his vote.|$|E
50|$|The college's eighth president, William Pott, {{was elected}} in May 1935. He was unique in respect to {{previous}} <b>presidents</b> <b>because</b> {{he was not a}} clergyman. In fact, he came to Elmira from a position at General Motors. Pott intended to leave after a predetermined length of time, hoping not to stay on as president for too long, as he felt many other presidents did.|$|R
5000|$|After his arrest, Arutyunian {{was shown}} on {{television}} admitting from {{his hospital bed}} that he had thrown the grenade. He {{said that he had}} attempted to assassinate both <b>presidents</b> <b>because</b> he hated Georgia's new government for being a [...] "puppet" [...] of the United States. He further stated that he did not regret what he did and would do it again if he had the chance.|$|R
5000|$|The next {{significant}} {{event in}} the Big East was Marinatto's forced resignation on May 7, 2012. According to one league source, [...] "He was the human pin cushion. Nobody {{in the world could}} have made this work. Look at the things he was dealt." [...] McMurphy remarked that Marinatto [...] "was set up to fail by the league's <b>presidents</b> <b>because</b> they handcuffed his ability to make any relevant changes." ...|$|R
25|$|Ryti's mandate as {{president}} {{was intended to}} extend only {{through the rest of}} Kallio's term, i.e., to 1943, but as the government could not organize elections during the Continuation War, the electors from 1937 gathered to re-elect him. This exceptional procedure was mandated by a constitutional amendment passed by the Parliament of Finland. Ryti was elected by an overwhelming majority. Ryti was willing to continue as <b>president</b> <b>because</b> he was among those who led Finland into the war, even though during the winter of 1942, both Ryti and Mannerheim had their doubts about German victory.|$|E
25|$|Thomas's {{political}} activity also included attempts at the US presidency. Following Eugene Debs's death in 1926, {{there was a}} leadership vacuum in the Socialist Party. Neither of the party's two top political leaders, Victor L. Berger and Hillquit, were eligible to run for <b>president</b> <b>because</b> of their foreign birth. The third main figure, Daniel Hoan, was occupied as mayor of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Down to approximately 8,000 dues paying members, the Socialist Party's options were limited, and the little-known minister from New York with oratorial skills and a pedigree in the movement became {{the choice of the}} 1928 National Convention of the Socialist Party.|$|E
25|$|James Kern Kyser {{was born}} in Rocky Mount, North Carolina, the son of pharmacists Emily Royster (née Howell) and Paul Bynum Kyser. Journalist and {{newspaper}} editor Vermont C. Royster was his cousin. Kyser graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with a Bachelor of Arts degree. He was also senior class <b>president.</b> <b>Because</b> of his popularity and enthusiasm as a cheerleader, he was invited by Hal Kemp to take over as bandleader when Kemp ventured north to further his career. He began taking clarinet lessons but was better as an entertaining announcer than a musician. He adopted the initial of his middle name {{as part of his}} stage name, for its alliterative effect.|$|E
50|$|Was born September 1, 1909 in Graves County, Western Kentucky. Some {{would say}} {{that he was one of}} the most {{influential}} and progressive of all the former <b>presidents,</b> <b>because</b> of the vast changes he brought about in a time where the school was still in a very infantile state. Graduated From Freed-Hardman College in Henderson, Tennessee. Former Kentucky House speaker and state representative. Earned a doctorate from the University of Kentucky in 1950.|$|R
50|$|In this year, Arosemena {{attended}} {{the meeting of}} Presidents of American states that was held in Punta del Este, Uruguay. At this meeting, he expressed frank opinions {{with respect to the}} US policy toward countries of Latin America, and the failure of the Alliance for Progress Program. He was the only attendee who refused to sign the Declaration of American <b>Presidents,</b> <b>because</b> he found it insufficient and lacking in practical content, as was demonstrated years later.|$|R
50|$|The Nichols House {{is known}} as the <b>President's</b> House <b>because,</b> when designed, it was {{intended}} to become the residence of the university's president.|$|R
25|$|The United States Mint {{produces}} Proof Sets {{specifically for}} collectors and speculators. Silver Proofs {{tend to be}} the standard designs but with the dime, quarter, and half dollar containing 90% silver. Starting in 1983 and ending in 1997, the Mint also produced proof sets containing the year's commemorative coins alongside the regular coins. Another type of proof set is the Presidential Dollar Proof Set where four special $1 coins are minted each year featuring a <b>president.</b> <b>Because</b> of budget constraints and increasing stockpiles of these relatively unpopular coins, the production of new Presidential dollar coins for circulation was suspended on December 13, 2011, by U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner. Future minting of such coins will be made solely for collectors.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, {{the general}} {{decided to run}} for {{governor}} of the Krasnoyarsk Krai (the second largest region in Russia), wanting {{to get out of the}} politics in Moscow after his ouster from the Yeltsin administration. He ended up winning the election for governor, defeating the incumbent Valery Zubov, despite being a complete outsider. There was speculation that he would run for the presidency in 2000, with Moscow mayor Yuri Luzhkov being projected as his main opponent at that time. However, in 2000 Lebed decided against running for <b>president</b> <b>because</b> he was satisfied with his position as the governor of Krasnoyarsk Krai. Lebed held this position until his death in a Mil Mi-8 helicopter crash on April 28, 2002, after it collided with electric lines during foggy weather in the Sayan Mountains.|$|E
25|$|NDP Now and the Waffle {{fought for}} control of the party’s bureaucracy, by trying to get as many people elected as party {{officers}} of the Federal Executive and Council. The major battles were for the party’s executive positions, especially the President and Vice-President positions. NDP Now, and its trade union backers, nominated the Ontario NDP’s former leader, Donald C. MacDonald as its candidate for party President. The Waffle candidate was Susan Gudmundson, from Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. Both MacDonald and Gudmundson were vying to succeed Allan Blakeney, who was stepping down as <b>president</b> <b>because</b> he recently was elected {{as the leader of the}} Saskatchewan NDP. MacDonald won 885 to 565, as expected, but Gudmundson received a surprisingly high level of support, due in part, to leadership candidate Ed Broadbent's supporters and the relative strength of the Waffle's supporters.|$|E
30|$|Noting several “paired” {{election}} coordinates, {{we observe}} that such pairs associate with two-term <b>presidents,</b> likely <b>because</b> their constituent support {{did not change}} much between elections.|$|R
50|$|Florida {{has won a}} {{total of}} eight SEC {{championship}}s. The Gators won their first championship with a conference record of 5-0-1 in 1984, but the title was vacated several months after the season ended by the SEC university <b>presidents</b> <b>because</b> of NCAA infractions by the Florida coaching staff under Charley Pell. The 1985 and 1990 teams also finished atop the standings with conference records of 5-1 and 6-1, respectively, but Florida was ineligible for the championship due to its NCAA probation for rule violations by previous coaching staffs. The Gators won their first official SEC football championship in 1991.|$|R
50|$|The 8th Ohio Infantry Regiment, U.S. Volunteers, {{arrived at}} Camp Alger on May 19, 1898, was nicknamed “McKinley’s Own” or “The <b>President’s</b> Own” <b>because</b> three {{companies}} were from President William McKinley’s hometown of Canton.|$|R
25|$|Many United Order {{communities}} {{were set up}} amongst Mormon towns beginning in 1874. One in particular was the United Order of Kanab, which was a communal experiment initiated by Brigham Young. Kanab was established in 1870. That year, John R. Young and the local bishop, Levi Stewart, began colonization of this area and twelve families followed to begin this endeavor. However, there was confusion as to who {{was the leader of}} this society. LDS Church authorities appointed the bishop and only they could revoke his status. But many wanted to elect John R. Young as <b>president</b> <b>because</b> he was related to LDS Church president Brigham Young. This conflict of power lasted until January 5, 1875, when Levi Stewart became the president. Eventually, Stewart resigned from his position and L. John Nuttall of Provo took his place.|$|E
500|$|For the moment, however, he did. There {{had been}} {{dramatic}} confrontations over policy before, {{the most notable}} of which was between President Abraham Lincoln and Major General George McClellan, in 1862. Another example was President James Polk's recall of Major General Winfield Scott after the Mexican-American War. Before relieving MacArthur, Truman consulted history books on how Lincoln and Polk dealt with their generals. Truman later said that Polk was his favorite <b>president</b> <b>because</b> [...] "he {{had the courage to}} tell Congress to go to Hell on foreign policy matters." ...|$|E
500|$|The Faculty Council later {{affirmed the}} right of Professors Finkelstein and Larudee to appeal, which a {{university}} lawyer said was not possible. Council President Anne Bartlett said she was [...] "'terribly concerned' correct procedure was not followed". DePaul's faculty association considered taking no-confidence votes on administrators, including the <b>president,</b> <b>because</b> of the tenure denials. In a statement issued upon Finkelstein's resignation, DePaul called him [...] "a prolific scholar and an outstanding teacher". Dershowitz expressed outrage at the compromise and this statement in particular, saying that the university had [...] "traded truth for peace".|$|E
5|$|The {{numbering}} {{reflects the}} uninterrupted terms in office {{served by a}} single man. For example, Jorge Sampaio served two consecutive terms and is counted as the 19th president (not the 19th and 20th). Teófilo Braga served as the first and sole president of the Provisional Government, and therefore is {{not considered to be}} the first President, although he would serve again as head of state and be the second president after the resignation of Manuel de Arriaga. However, Bernardino Machado served two non-consecutive terms, and he is counted as both the third and the eighth <b>presidents.</b> <b>Because</b> of this, the list below contains 20 presidencies, but only 19 presidents.|$|R
50|$|In 2010, Mohaqiq stopped {{supporting}} <b>President</b> Karzai <b>because</b> of Karzai's {{policy of}} appeasement towards the Taliban insurgents. In late 2011, Mohaqiq, Ahmad Zia Massoud and Abdul Rashid Dostum created the National Front of Afghanistan (also Afghanistan National Front, ANF).|$|R

500|$|Although he {{had made}} no {{political}} bargains, his supporters had given many pledges upon his behalf. When Boss Matthew Quay of Pennsylvania, who rebuffed for a Cabinet position for his political support during the convention, heard that Harrison ascribed his narrow victory to Providence, Quay exclaimed that Harrison would never know [...] "how close a number of men were compelled to approach...the penitentiary to make him President." [...] Harrison {{was known as the}} Centennial <b>President</b> <b>because</b> his inauguration celebrated the centenary of the first inauguration of George Washington in 1789. In congressional elections, the Republicans increased their membership in the House of Representatives by nineteen seats.|$|E
500|$|McCain was {{mentioned}} as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination beginning in 1997, but he took few steps to pursue it, instead concentrating on his 1998 senate re-election. [...] The decision of General Colin Powell not to run helped persuade McCain {{that there might be}} an opening for him. [...] McCain later wrote that he had a [...] "vague aspiration" [...] of running for president for a long time. [...] He would also be candid about his motivation: [...] "I didn't decide to run for president to start a national crusade for the political reforms I believed in or to run a campaign as if it were some grand act of patriotism. In truth, I wanted to be <b>president</b> <b>because</b> it had become my ambition to become president. I was sixty-two years old when I made the decision, and I thought it was my one shot at the prize." ...|$|E
500|$|Months {{prior to}} his announcement, McCarthy hinted that he would {{challenge}} President Johnson for the Democratic nomination due to his contrasting views {{with the president on}} the Vietnam War. The Americans for Democratic Action announced that they would support McCarthy's campaign if he decided to run. [...] Johnson took these mentions seriously, privately confiding to Democratic congressional leaders that McCarthy could gain the support of Martin Luther King, Jr. and Dr. Benjamin Spock, splintering the party. It was rumored that McCarthy had $100,000 pledged to use on the New Hampshire and Wisconsin primaries in the upcoming year. One politician explained to Johnson that McCarthy's run could be reminiscent of Estes Kefauver, whose 1952 campaign in the early primaries is speculated to have caused President Harry S. Truman to not seek re-election. McCarthy privately explained his intentions to Vice President Hubert Humphrey with whom he had served Minnesota in the Senate for nearly two decades. He commented that he did not believe he could win, but that he had [...] "lost interest" [...] in the Senate and felt [...] "very strongly about the war," [...] believing {{that the best way to}} express himself was to [...] "go on out and enter the primaries." [...] Humphrey stated that McCarthy was [...] "more vain and arrogant than his supporters wanted to admit", but that he did not decide to run for <b>president</b> <b>because</b> of his personal feelings for Johnson, but his genuine feelings about the Vietnam War.|$|E
2500|$|Following World War II, Hoover {{became friends}} with President Harry S. Truman despite their ideological differences. Hoover joked that they were for many years the sole members of the [...] "trade union" [...] of former <b>Presidents.</b> <b>Because</b> of Hoover's {{experience}} with Germany {{at the end of}} World War I, in 1946 President Truman selected the former president to tour Germany to ascertain the food needs of the occupied nation. Hoover toured what was to become West Germany in Hermann Göring's old train coach and produced a number of reports critical of U.S. occupation policy. The economy of Germany had [...] "sunk to the lowest level in a hundred years". He stated in one report: ...|$|R
5000|$|Gerson {{joined the}} Bush {{campaign}} before 2000 as a speechwriter {{and went on}} to head the White House speechwriting team. [...] "No one doubts that he did his job exceptionally well," [...] wrote Ramesh Ponnuru in a 2007 article otherwise very critical of Gerson in National Review. According to Ponnuru, Bush's speechwriters had more prominence in the administration than their predecessors did under previous <b>presidents</b> <b>because</b> Bush's speeches did most of the work of defending the president's policies, since administration spokesmen and press conferences did not. On the other hand, he wrote, the speeches would announce new policies that were never implemented, making the speechwriting in some ways less influential than ever.|$|R
50|$|The {{constitution}} of Afghanistan requires the Afghan Parliament to approve or disapprove the cabinet ministers which the Afghan <b>President</b> proposes. <b>Because</b> {{there was no}} Afghan Parliament when the administration was installed it {{was scheduled to be}} approved after the parliamentary election of 2005.|$|R
