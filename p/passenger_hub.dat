30|$|The {{practice}} {{indicates the}} following: {{the expansion of}} intercity passenger transportation network in urban agglomeration can attract more and more intercity passenger flow, and comprehensive <b>passenger</b> transport <b>hub</b> construction is the inevitable demand. The <b>passenger</b> transport <b>hub</b> construction will certainly attract new travel demands, producing a greater influence on network layout. In the network planning of rapidly developing intercity transportation, {{it is important to}} take both the hub location and network layout into consideration.|$|R
25|$|For the 2016 {{full year}} figures {{published}} by the airport, the airport handled 58,698,039 passengers (a 5.9% increase over the previous year), the most in its 35-year history. This made it the sixth busiest airport by international passenger traffic {{in the world and}} the second busiest in Asia. In December 2016, Changi Airport registered a total of 5.68million passenger movements, the highest the airport has ever achieved in a month since it opened in 1981. Its daily traffic movement record was also broken on 23 December 2016, with more than 202,000 passengers passing through during that day. In addition to being an important <b>passenger</b> <b>hub,</b> the airport is also one of the busiest cargo airports in the world, handling 1.97million tonnes of cargo in 2016. The total number of commercial aircraft movements increased by 4.1% from the previous year to 360,490 in 2016. In April 2017, the airport handled more than a billion passengers for the first time.|$|E
2500|$|In 1992, {{the airport}} had {{international}} service with nonstop flights to destinations in the Caribbean and Mexico when Key Airlines was operating a <b>passenger</b> <b>hub</b> in Savannah. Key Airlines also operated nonstop mainline jet service {{to a number}} of U.S. cities at this time and from Savannah. [...] According to the Key Airlines system timetable dated October 1, 1992, nonstop services primarily operated with Boeing 727-100 and 727-200 jetliners were being flown from the airport to Antigua (ANU), Aruba (AUA), Atlanta (ATL), Baltimore (BWI), Boston (BOS), Cancun (CUN), Chicago Midway Airport (MDW), Cozumel (CZM), Curaçao (CUR), Freeport (FPO), Montego Bay (MBJ), Nassau (NAS), New York Newark Airport (EWR), Orlando (MCO), St. Maarten (SXM) and St. Thomas (STT). [...] In addition to these nonstop flights, one-stop direct service was also flown by the airline from Savannah to St. Croix (STX). Key Airlines subsequently experienced financial difficulties and then ceased all flights in 1993.|$|E

50|$|A {{preliminary}} study was being conducted concerning the existing terminal building in planning for future growth and construction. Adding an extension {{to the terminal}} would have allowed Lafayette Regional Airport to handle more air traffic, which could entice international carriers {{to use it as}} a connecting airport. This would require a U.S. Customs department office stationed at the airport, which would bring Lafayette Regional Airport to an 'international airport' status. However, international service from Lafayette appears unlikely at this time due to the relatively small population base in the area as well as the presence of large international and domestic <b>passenger</b> <b>hubs</b> located relatively nearby in Atlanta (Delta Air Lines), Dallas/Fort Worth (American Airlines) and Houston (United Airlines).|$|R

The results show that the existing location model fails to quantitatively describe the behavior characteristics of massive passenger flows and results in the spatial planning and design of guidance signage being inaccessible for many in mass passenger transit and spatial topological networks resulting from 3 D hub architecture make the constraint conditions of location models more complex. Sophisticated guidance signs and location models responding to behavioral characteristics and spatial topological networks will be a trend of interest in the optimal layout of future comprehensive <b>passenger</b> transportation <b>hubs...</b>|$|R
