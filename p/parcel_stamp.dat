5000|$|In philately a <b>parcel</b> <b>stamp</b> is a stamp {{specifically}} {{issued to}} pay the fee for the transport of a parcel through the postal system and usually marked as such. It is to be distinguished from a postage stamp used {{to pay the}} cost of posting a parcel, although there may no practical distinction {{as far as the}} sender is concerned. Parcel stamps issued by governments have the same status in philately as postage stamps, but parcel stamps issued by private railway companies or road carriers are regarded as cinderella stamps and many parcel stamps are also railway stamps.|$|E

50|$|The first stamp {{depicting}} {{an aeroplane}} was a US 20-cent <b>parcel</b> post <b>stamp</b> issued on 1 January 1913 but not intended for airmail duty: {{the set of}} 12 showed transportation and delivery methods. Four years later an airmail stamp was issued in Italy. Several of the early ones were produced by surcharging other stamps with overprints; at first in 1917, Italy used express stamps; regular stamps were used by Austria in 1918, Sweden used official stamps in 1920. Some other examples are the use of fiscal stamps, telegraph stamps, postage due <b>stamps,</b> and <b>parcel</b> <b>stamps</b> by other countries. Airmail stamps have been issued for extra services, such as registered airmail, express airmail, airmail fieldpost, and even with welfare surcharges.|$|R

50|$|A meter stamp, or meter mark, is the {{impression}} {{made by a}} postage meter machine that indicates that postage has been paid on a letter or <b>parcel.</b> Meter <b>stamps</b> are widely used by businesses and organisations as they are more efficient than using postage stamps.|$|R
25|$|The <b>Parcel</b> Post <b>stamps</b> of 191213 {{were printed}} on the flat plate press which yielded plate blocks of six stamps with the plate number {{designated}} in the margin (designating a particular printing run). Beginning in January 1913, the denomination of the stamps was printed in word form in the margin.|$|R
2500|$|The U.S. <b>Parcel</b> Post <b>stamps</b> of 191213 {{were the}} first such stamps issued by the U.S. Post Office Department and {{consisted}} of twelve denominations to pay the postage on parcels weighing 16 ounces and more, with each denomination printed in the same color of [...] "carmine-rose". Their border design was similar while each denomination of stamp bore its own distinctive image in the vignette. Unlike regular postage items, whose rates were determined by weight in ounces, Parcel Post rates were determined and measured by increments in pounds. The new stamps were soon widely used by industry, farmers and others who lived in rural areas. Partly owing to some confusion involving their usage, their exclusive use as <b>Parcel</b> Post <b>stamps</b> proved short lived, as regular postage stamps were soon allowed {{to be used to}} pay parcel postage rates.|$|R

25|$|A special {{printing}} of the 191213 <b>Parcel</b> Post <b>stamps</b> {{was made for}} the Panama-Pacific Exposition held in San Francisco in 1915 from the dies that made the printing plates for this series of stamps. They {{are referred to as}} Die Proofs and are printed directly from the die on soft yellowish wove paper one at a time. Subsequently die proofs have no perforations around them.|$|R
50|$|Countries {{have issued}} postage stamps to {{recognize}} mobile postal services. For instance, in 1913, the U.S. issued <b>parcel</b> post <b>stamps</b> that portray a mail train {{as well as}} an employee of a railway post office. In 1974, Zambia issued a series of 4 stamps as commemoratives for the centenary of the Universal Postal Union. Israel issued a stamp in 1959 picturing its red mobile post truck, pictured.|$|R
25|$|With the {{termination}} of <b>Parcel</b> Post <b>stamps</b> the need for Parcel Post Postage Due stamps also ended. They had seen little use since most parcels were properly weighed and paid for at post offices. But in a way analogous to the Parcel Post issues they were retained by postmasters and used as regular postage due stamps until the supplies were exhausted. Some were employed well into the 1920s. The 25-cent denomination was of particular use {{since there was no}} correspondingly valued regular postage due stamp.|$|R

The 20-cent U.S. <b>Parcel</b> Post <b>stamp</b> of 1912 had the distinction for being the first postage stamp in history to depict an airplane (identified as an [...] "aeroplane"), six years before the U.S. Post Office Department issued stamps for airmail service. The steamship depicted on the 10-cent stamp is the SS Kronprinz Wilhelm with a mail tender along its starboard side in New York Harbor.|$|R

25|$|During {{the first}} half year of its {{inception}} the Parcel Post service with its new series of special stamps proved to be very successful, resulting with the mailing of more than 300 million parcels during this short period. But after much confusion among and pressure from postal workers, the Post Office Department acquiesced and the Postmaster General authorized the use of ordinary postage stamps to pay the postage on 4th class parcels, beginning on July 1, 1913, ending mandatory use of the new stamps after precisely six months. In turn <b>Parcel</b> Post <b>stamps</b> were allowed for use to pay the postage for all classes of mail until the supply finally ran out. This is the only series of stamps issued by the Post Office that have ever been allowed dual usage. The last printing of <b>Parcel</b> Post <b>stamps,</b> a run of the 10-cent value, occurred on June 24, 1913, but stamps still in stock continued to be shipped to post offices for quite some time, particularly of higher values, with the final delivery—a supply of 75-cent stamps—made as late as 1921. Although the stamps were discontinued, one new denomination of the series—20 cents—was deemed too useful to discard, and a 20 cent value was accordingly added to the existing definitive Washington-Franklin series.|$|R
25|$|Special stamps {{were printed}} for Parcel Post service {{to help in}} the effort of keeping {{accounts}} and revenues generated from general postage and the Parcel Post separate. The twelve <b>Parcel</b> Post <b>stamps</b> had three basic design themes that were associated with the Post Office and its delivery service. The denominations were such that any amount of postage up to one dollar could be made by using no more than three stamps. Three of the Parcel Post denominations—20 cents, 25 cents and 75 cents—were new to U. S. Postage.|$|R
