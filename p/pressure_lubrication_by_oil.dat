50|$|Engine braking in a premix {{two-stroke}} engine {{can be extremely}} harmful to the engine, because cylinder and piston lubricant is delivered to each cylinder mixed with fuel. Consequently, during engine braking, the engine starves not only of fuel but also lubricant, causing accelerated wear. Many old two-stroke cars (Saab, Wartburg, etc.) had a freewheel device on the transmission to make engine braking optional. Most two-stroke motorcycle engines since the 1970s have had <b>lubrication</b> <b>by</b> an <b>oil</b> pump, independent of the throttle and fuel system, such as Suzuki's Posi-Force system.|$|R

40|$|The {{heat flow}} paradox {{provides}} {{evidence that a}} dynamic weakening mechanism may be important in understanding fault friction and rupture. We present here a specific model for dynamic velocity weakening that uses the mechanics of well-studied industrial bearings to explain fault zone processes. An elevated fluid pressure is generated in a thin film of viscous fluid that is sheared between nearly parallel surface. This <b>lubrication</b> <b>pressure</b> supports part of the load, therefore reducing the normal stress and associated friction across the gap. The pressure also elastically deforms the wall rock. The model is parameterized using the Sommerfeld number, which {{is a measure of}} the <b>lubrication</b> <b>pressure</b> normalized <b>by</b> the lithostatic load. For typical values of the material properties, slip distance and velocity, the Sommerfeld number suggests that lubrication is an important process. If the lubrication length scales as the slip distance in an earthquake, the frictional stress during dynamically lubricated large earthquakes is 30 % less than the friction with only hydrostatic pore <b>pressure.</b> Elastohydrodynamic <b>lubrication</b> also predicts a decrease in high-frequency (> 1 Hz) radiation above a critical slip distance of a few meters. This prediction is well matched by the strong motion data from the 1999 Taiwan earthquake. The observed 2 orders of magnitude variation in scaled radiated energy between small (M_w 6) is also predicted <b>by</b> the <b>lubrication</b> model...|$|R

Jet lubricated ball bearings were limited to speeds less than 2, 500, 000 DN. Bearings having inner-race land riding cages produced lower temperatures than bearings with outer-race land riding cages.

40|$|AbstractLubricant {{retention}} during sliding of {{mating surfaces}} {{is one of}} the major problems encountered in the industrial components. The efficiency of the engine is affected by the frictional losses taking place at the engine liner-piston ring interface. The coefficient of friction and the resulting wear is directly related to the effectiveness of the lubrication. One of the methods to achieve good <b>lubrication</b> is <b>by</b> making <b>oil</b> pockets on the surface of the component. This leads to a mixed lubrication regime. The objective of this study focuses on the influence of oil pocket distribution on the effectiveness of lubrication. Oil pockets were made on the liner-ring samples.

Three basic parameters such as load, temperature and frequency were considered for the analysis. The result of this experiment will be analysed...|$|R
50|$|Early screw-propelled steamships used a {{thrust block}} or thrust box {{composed}} of perhaps a dozen lower-rated plain thrust journal bearings stacked {{on the same}} shaft. These were problematic in service: they were bulky, difficult to dismantle, wasted power through friction {{and they had a}} tendency to overheat. The thrust box was built of a box-like cast iron housing with a radial bearing at each end and a number of collars formed on the shaft between them. This shaft was often a short section of removable shaft called the thrust shaft, linking the engine ahead to the propeller shaft astern. A series of iron horseshoe-shaped collars fitted over the small diameter of the shaft and bore against the forward face of the shaft's collars. Each horseshoe was faced with a low-friction pad of babbitt metal. <b>Lubrication</b> was <b>by</b> an <b>oil</b> bath in the box and a plentiful volume was important for cooling purposes too.|$|R

50|$|The {{frame is}} a full steel duplex {{swingarm}} design, with Ceriani rear suspension, and Marzocchi front forks. The early models had a twin leading shoe drum brake up front (Strada: 200 mm drum, Sport: 230 mm drum) that was notoriously grabby on the Borrani spoked wheels, but these were replaced with a single chromed 260 mm Grimeca disc in 1976, and later optional double discs. The rear drum brake was replaced in the early 1980s with a Grimeca disc. Switchgear, tail and brake lights were the standard CEV model used on many Italian motorcycles of the 1970s. The month and year of manufacture is embossed in small figures {{on the side of}} each cast wheel, near where one of the seven cast spokes meets the rim. The helical gear transmission was a six-speed, with a top gear ratio of 1:0.954, making it akin to an overdrive. The transmission was engaged with a six-plate dry clutch, making a characteristic rattle similar to Ducatis when disengaged. Secondary drive was by a 5/8 x 3/8-inch chain to a rear sprocket with cush drive. Gear change is by right foot and the rear brake operated by left foot. Engine <b>lubrication</b> was <b>by</b> <b>oil</b> pump to the crankshaft but no force lubrication went to the rocker gear. Instead, crankcase pressure forced oil mist up the short pushrod tunnels to the rocker covers, where two 'crow's feet' allowed mist to condense and drip onto the rocker gear.

To investigate effects of additives known as sodium carbonate (NaCO 3), zeolite and lime (CaO) on density, viscosity, flash point, sulfur content, heating value and distillation temperature, the purified oil samples are blended separately with additives having mass basis of 2 %, 4 %, 6 %, 8 % and 10 %. The mixed samples are exposed to pyrolitic distillation process to produce fuels to be used in engines. Thermal and physical properties of the produced fuels such as density, flash point, viscosity, sulfur content, heating value and distillation temperatures are examined. From these results, the CaO with a ratio of 2 % has the highest effect on decreasing of sulfur content of the waste engine oil and on acquiring the most suitable distillation temperatures close to values of a diesel fuel.
