5|$|HIV-1 entry, {{as well as}} {{entry of}} many other retroviruses, has long been {{believed}} to occur exclusively at the plasma membrane.

5|$|Wagiman is {{differentiated}} {{from other}} Australian languages {{in that it}} has a regular and <b>productive</b> process of verbalisation, whereby coverbs can become verbs and act as the independent head of a clause. Despite being fully <b>productive,</b> meaning that all coverbs may undergo verbalisation, in practice only a handful of coverbs are commonly verbalised. The process appears to be unique to Wagiman within Australian languages.|$|E
5|$|A {{small number}} of <b>productive</b> species {{including}} carp, salmon, tilapia and catfish are farmed commercially, producing {{millions of tons of}} protein-rich food per year. The UN's Food and Agriculture Organization expects production to increase sharply so that by 2030, perhaps sixty-two percent of food fish will be farmed.|$|E
5|$|Advice on more <b>productive</b> {{techniques}} for farming {{began to appear}} in England in the mid-17th century, from writers such as Samuel Hartlib, Walter Blith and others. The main problem in sustaining agriculture in one place for a long time was the depletion of nutrients, most importantly nitrogen levels, in the soil. To allow the soil to regenerate, <b>productive</b> land was often let fallow and in some places crop rotation was used. The Dutch four-field rotation system was popularised by the British agriculturist Charles Townshend in the 18th century. The system (wheat, turnips, barley and clover), opened up a fodder crop and grazing crop allowing livestock to be bred year-round. The use of clover was especially important as the legume roots replenished soil nitrates.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the season, he {{embarked}} on a tour with the International Cavaliers, which toured Africa, mostly playing against provincial teams.

He also bowled more frequently than usual taking seven wickets at 53.29.|$|E
5|$|At {{the global}} level the {{environmental}} impact of agribusiness is being addressed through sustainable agriculture and organic farming.

5|$|Beginning {{his career}} as a fast-medium swing and seam bowler, Pathan broke into the {{national}} team soon after turning 19, and evoked comparisons with Pakistan's Wasim Akram with his promising performances and prodigious swing. In early 2006, Pathan became the only bowler to take a Test hat-trick in the first over of the match (vs Pakistan at Karachi). However, the <b>productive</b> run did not last and after the start of 2006, Pathan began to steadily lose pace and swing, and his wicket-taking dwindled. Although Pathan's batting continued to be <b>productive,</b> he was not regarded as a specialist and was dropped from the team in both Tests and ODIs by the end of 2006, and by 2007 was no longer in the squad until return in 2007 World Twenty20.|$|E
5|$|Belgium was {{the first}} country in {{continental}} Europe to experience the Industrial Revolution, and was the most intensively industrialized {{country in the world}} throughout most of the period.

5|$|From there on, Harvey's {{series was}} unproductive, failing to pass 31 {{in the six}} innings of the final three Tests. Australia's form slumped along with that of Harvey, losing the next two Tests and the series 3–1. Harvey ended with 354 runs at 44.25 for the series.
