40|$|The {{control of}} <b>perennial</b> <b>weed</b> species, which grow on {{permanent}} grass growths, {{is an increasing}} problem for the farmers. Their regulation is very difficult and expensive. Farmers should primarily focus on avoiding weed to excess. This expresses the need of finding cheap and advantageous regulations that {{will be able to}} prevent weed from excessing. The aim of this work is to contribute to the expansion of the knowledge about the appropriate regulatory precaution and the possibilities of its usage. There were observed the most represented weed species on permanent grass growth in ZD Třebelovice. Mostly, the land sorrel and dandelion medical Hinoki were found.

25|$|The beet {{leafhopper}} {{is commonly}} found in tropical and subtropical countries that have warm climates. They {{have been found to}} be residing within the Western part of the United States, Mexico, South America, and the Old World (the Mediterranean basin and the Middle East). During the winter in California, the beet leafhopper would migrate to the foothill of the coastal range located on the west side of the Central Valley and lay eggs in the <b>perennial</b> <b>weeds</b> and buckhorn plantains. When the nymphs of beet leafhoppers are born, they would consume the infected weeds and plants causing them to acquire the virus. During the mid to late spring, the adult leafhoppers would travel to the agricultural area of the Central Valley to infect other healthy plants and weeds. As fall approaches, the adult leafhoppers migrate back to the foothill and begin the process again.|$|E
25|$|Examples of such ruderal or pioneer species include {{plants that}} are adapted to {{naturally}} occurring disturbed environments such as dunes and other windswept areas with shifting soils, alluvial flood plains, river banks and deltas, and areas that are burned repeatedly. Since human agricultural practices often mimic these natural environments where weedy species have evolved, some weeds are effectively preadapted to grow and proliferate in human-disturbed areas such as agricultural fields, lawns, roadsides, and construction sites. The weedy nature of these species often gives them an advantage over more desirable crop species because they often grow quickly and reproduce quickly, they commonly have seeds that persist in the soil seed bank for many years, or they may have short lifespans with multiple generations in the same growing season. In contrast, <b>perennial</b> <b>weeds</b> often have underground stems that spread under the soil surface or, like ground ivy (Glechoma hederacea), have creeping stems that root and spread out over the ground.|$|E
2500|$|Resist weed invasion: Weed {{pressure}} {{has increased in}} upland rice systems as the fallow period has shortened. Ecologist Jack Ewel wrote: [...] "Weeds are widely recognized as a major impediment to continuous cropping in the humid tropics, and fields are often abandoned more because uncontrollable weed populations are anticipated than because of declining fertility or pest buildups." [...] Grassland restoration with perennials results in fewer annual weeds and perennial grasses, sown at appropriate densities, can out-compete even <b>perennial</b> <b>weeds</b> once they are established.|$|E

These weed species include Solanum nigrum (nightshade), S. aculeatissimum (soda apple), Chenopodium album (pigweed), Datura stramonium (jimson weed), Linaria canadensis (blue toadflax), and Physalis spp. (ground cherry). Thus, recommendations for the control of this virus include the control of weeds in and around susceptible solanaceous crops.|$|R

[...] The annual weeds like Plantago and flax and the <b>perennial</b> <b>weeds</b> like Cat's Ears and Queen Anne's Lace are also invading its habitat. [...] Nearby one population, eight different weeds cover 45% of the area, and the seven other native plants of the native grassland community, make up 55% cover. Each year, all the weeds need to be cleared away at a sufficient distance from the Hickmanii plants, and the area restored to as close to 100% native plant cover as possible, otherwise some of these populations could face extinction soon.|$|E
2500|$|Mouldboard ploughing, in {{cold and}} {{temperate}} climates, no deeper than 20cm, aerates the soil by loosening it. It incorporates crop residues, solid manures, limestone and commercial fertilisers along with oxygen. By doing so, it reduces nitrogen losses by denitrification, accelerates mineralization and increases short-term nitrogen availability for transformation {{of organic matter}} into humus. It erases wheel tracks and ruts caused by harvesting equipment. It controls many <b>perennial</b> <b>weeds</b> and pushes back the growth of other weeds until the following spring. It accelerates soil warming and water evaporation in spring because of the lesser quantity of residues on the soil surface. It facilitates seeding with a lighter seeder. It controls many enemies of crops (slugs, crane flies, seedcorn maggots-bean seed flies, borers). It increases the number of [...] "soil-eating" [...] earthworms (endogea) but is detrimental to vertical-dwelling earthworms (anecic).|$|E

Glyphosate, amino triazole and paraquat have been used safely and efficaceously [sic] postemergence. Combinations of mechanical and chemical weed control help allow maximum tree establishment and growth. Weeds are plants that compete for water...|$|R
40|$|We {{studied the}} early {{vegetation}} dynamics in former croplands (sunflower and cereal fields) sown with a low-diversity seed mixture (composed of 2 native grass species) in Egyek-Pusztakócs, Hortobágy National Park, East-Hungary. The percentage cover of vascular plants {{was recorded in}} 4 permanent plots per field on 7 restored fields between 2006 and 2009. Ten aboveground biomass samples per field were also collected in June in each year. We addressed two questions: (i) How do seed sowing and annual mowing affect the species richness, biomass and cover of weeds? (ii) How fast does the cover of sown grasses develop after seed sowing? Weedy species were characteristic {{in the first year}} after sowing. In the second and third year their cover and species richness decreased. From the second year onwards the cover of perennial grasses increased. Spontaneously immigrating species characteristic to the reference grasslands were also detected with low cover scores. Short-lived weeds were suppressed as their cover and biomass significantly decreased during the study. The amount of litter and sown grass biomass increased progressively. However, <b>perennial</b> <b>weed</b> cover, especially the cover of Cirsium arvense increased substantially. Our results suggest that grassland vegetation can be recovered by sowing low diversity mixtures followed up by yearly mowing.
