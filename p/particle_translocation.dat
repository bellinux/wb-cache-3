We have investigated this in an isolated perfused and ventilated rabbit lung preparation lacking pulmonary lymphatic flow. Fluorescent polystyrene particles of different diameters (24, 110 or 190 nm) and surface chemistry (carboxylate or amine modified) were injected either intratracheally (i. t.) or intravascularly (i. v.) and, after a period of 2 h, their presence in the perfusion liquid or in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, was assessed by spectrofluorimetry. Vascular pressures and lung weights were monitored. Following the i. t. administration, no <b>particle</b> <b>translocation</b> was observed from the alveoli into the vascular compartment.

The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the role of the endothelial barrier in the translocation of inhaled UFP from the lung into circulation. Methods The isolated perfused rat lung (IPRL) was used under negative pressure ventilation, and radioactive iridium particles (18 nm, CMD, 192 Ir-UFP) were inhaled during 60 minutes to achieve a lung burden of 100 – 200 μg. Particle inhalation was done under following treatments: i) control perfusion, ii) histamine (1 μM in perfusate, iii) luminal histamine instillation (1 mM), and iv) luminal instillation of H 2 O 2. <b>Particle</b> <b>translocation</b> to the perfusate was assessed by the radioactivity of 192 Ir isotope. Lung permeability by the use of Tc 99 m -labeled diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA). In addition to light microscopic morphological evaluation of fixed lungs, alkaline phosphatase (AKP) and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) in perfusate were measured to assess epithelial and endothelial integrity. Results Particle distribution in the lung was homogenous and similar to in vivo conditions. No translocation of Ir particles at negative pressure inhalation was detected in control IPL, but lungs pretreated with histamine (1 μM) in the perfusate or with luminal H 2 O 2 (0. 5 mM) showed small amounts of radioactivity (2 – 3 % dose) in the single pass perfusate starting at 60 min of perfusion. Although the kinetics of <b>particle</b> <b>translocation</b> were different from permeability for 99 m Tc-DTPA, the pretreatments (H 2 O 2, vascular histamine) caused similar changes in the translocation of particles and soluble mediator. Increased translocation through epithelium and endothelium with a lag time of one hour occurred in the absence of epithelial and endothelial damage. Conclusion Permeability of the lung barrier to UFP or nanoparticles is controlled both at the epithelial and endothelial level.

Surface proteins of all hepadnaviruses contain conserved functional TLMs. Genetic inactivation of the duck HBV TLMs does not interfere with viral morphogenesis; however, these mutants are noninfectious. TLM mutant viruses bind to cells and are taken up into the endosomal compartment, but they cannot escape from endosomes. Processing of surface protein by endosomal proteases induces their exposure on the virus surface. This unmasking of TLMs mediates translocation of viral particles across the endosomal membrane into the cytosol, a prerequisite for productive infection. The ability of unmasked TLMs to translocate processed HBV particles across cellular membranes was shown by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy and by infection of nonpermissive cell lines with HBV processed in vitro with endosomal lysate.

An interaction between molecules and membrane pores is modeled via {{a set of}} binding sites with different energies.

For small concentration gradients the attractive sites lead to largest currents and fluctuations, while the repulsive interactions yield the largest fluxes and dispersions for large concentration gradients. Interaction energies that lead to maximal currents and maximal fluctuations are the same only for locally symmetric potentials, while they differ for the locally asymmetric potentials. The conditions for the most optimal translocation transport with maximal current and minimal dispersion are discussed. It is argued that in this case the interaction strength is independent of local symmetry of the potential of mean forces.

Concerns linked {{to the use of}} alum particles emerged following recognition of their causative role in the so-called macrophagic myofasciitis (MMF) lesion detected in patients with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue/syndrome. MMF revealed an unexpectedly long-lasting biopersistence of alum within immune cells in presumably susceptible individuals, stressing the previous fundamental misconception of its biodisposition. We previously showed that poorly biodegradable aluminum-coated particles injected into muscle are promptly phagocytozed in muscle and the draining lymph nodes, and can disseminate within phagocytic cells throughout the body and slowly accumulate in brain. This strongly suggests that long-term adjuvant biopersistence within phagocytic cells is a prerequisite for slow brain translocation and delayed neurotoxicity. The understanding of basic mechanisms of particle biopersistence and brain translocation represents a major health challenge, since it could help to define susceptibility factors to develop chronic neurotoxic damage. Biopersistence of alum may be linked to its lysosome-destabilizing effect, which is likely due to direct crystal-induced rupture of phagolysosomal membranes. Macrophages that continuously perceive foreign particles in their cytosol will likely reiterate, with variable interindividual efficiency, a dedicated form of autophagy (xenophagy) until they dispose of alien materials.

Pulmonary inflammation via bronchoalveolar lavage and MWCNT translocation from the lungs to systemic organs was evident 24 h post-inhalation. Coronary arterioles were evaluated 24 - 168 h post-exposure to determine microvascular response to changes in transmural pressure, endothelium-dependent and -independent reactivity.

Using Brownian molecular dynamics simulations we investigate the mean first-passage time {{as a function of the}} length of the chain inside for different concentrations of binding particles. As a consequence of the interactions with these particles, the chain experiences a net force along its length whose calculated value from the simulations accounts for the velocity at which it enters the cell. This force can in turn be obtained from the solution of a generalized diffusion equation incorporating an effective Langmuir adsorption free energy for the chain plus binding particles. These results suggest a role of binding <b>particles</b> in the <b>translocation</b> process that is in general quite different from that of a Brownian ratchet. Furthermore, nonequilibrium effects contribute significantly to the dynamics; e. g., the chain often enters the cell faster than particle binding can be saturated, resulting in a force several times smaller than the equilibrium value...|$|R
40|$|SummaryIntracellular mRNA {{localization}} directs {{protein synthesis}} to particular subcellular domains to establish embryonic polarity {{in a variety}} of organisms. In Drosophila, bicoid (bcd) mRNA is prelocalized at the oocyte anterior. After fertilization, translation of this RNA produces a Bcd protein gradient that determines anterior cell fates [1, 2]. Analysis of bcd mRNA during late stages of oogenesis suggested a model for steady-state bcd localization by continual active transport [3]. However, this mechanism cannot explain maintenance of bcd localization throughout the end of oogenesis, when microtubules disassemble in preparation for embryogenesis [4, 5], or retention of bcd at the anterior in mature oocytes, which can remain dormant for weeks before fertilization [6]. Here, we elucidate the path and mechanism of sustained bcd mRNA transport by direct observation of bcd RNA <b>particle</b> <b>translocation</b> in living oocytes. We show that bcd mRNA shifts from continuous active transport to stable actin-dependent anchoring at the end of oogenesis. Egg activation triggers bcd release from the anterior cortex for proper deployment in the embryo, probably through reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. These findings uncover a surprising parallel between flies and frogs, as cortically tethered Xenopus Vg 1 mRNA undergoes a similar redistribution during oocyte maturation [7]. Our results thus highlight a conserved mechanism for regulating mRNA anchoring and redeployment during the oocyte-to-embryo transition...|$|E

Cryptosporidium parvum causes {{gastroenteritis}} {{in humans}} {{and is now}} recognized as an emerging pathogen. The inactive form, known as an oocyst, is excreted in the feces of infected animals and humans into the environment. Little {{is known about the}} transport of C. parvum oocysts through soil to reach and contaminate water bodies. A 40 x 30 -m site at the outlet of an 8 -ha grazing catchment just above a spring was instrumented to conduct a water budget analysis to evaluate soil-water and <b>particle</b> <b>translocation.</b> A tracer experiment using polystyrene microspheres, as surrogates to the oocysts, showed that microspheres had migrated through unsaturated soil to reach the ground water and spring within 20 days after injection 12 -m upstream of the spring.

40|$|In this study, the {{mobility}} of nanoparticles in mucus and similar hydrogels as model systems was assessed to elucidate the link between microscopic diffusion behavior and macroscopic penetration of such gels. Differences in particle adhesion to mucus components were strongly dependent on particle coating. Particles coated with 2 kDa PEG exhibited a decreased adhesion to mucus components, whereas chitosan strongly increased the adhesion. Despite such mucoinert properties of PEG, magnetic nanoparticles of both coatings did not penetrate through native respiratory mucus, resisting high magnetic forces (even for several hours). However, model hydrogels were, indeed, penetrated by both particles in dependency of particle coating, obeying the theory of particle mobility in an external force field. Comparison of penetration data with cryogenic scanning EM images of mucus and the applied model systems suggested particularly high rigidity of the mucin scaffold and a broad pore size distribution in mucus as reasons for the observed particle immobilization. Active probing of the rigidity of mucus and model gels with optical tweezers {{was used in this}} context to confirm such properties of mucus on the microscale, thus presenting the missing link between micro- and macroscopical observations. Because of high heterogeneity {{in the size of the}} voids and pores in mucus, on small scales, particle mobility will depend on adhesive or inert properties. However, <b>particle</b> <b>translocation</b> over distances larger than a few micrometers is restricted by highly rigid structures within the mucus mesh...|$|E
40|$|Macrophages exist {{throughout}} the body. They have critical {{roles in the}} peritoneal cavity, bone marrow, skin, spleen, liver, and elsewhere. Their migratory patterns, phagocytic behavior, immunoloc roles, and secretory potential are pivotal to both defense mechanisms and to the pathogenesis of disease. Macrophages have been impLicated recently in such diverse disease processes as arthritis, AIDS, and juvenile onset diabetes. It {{is important to recognize}} the existence of other lung macrophages besides alveolar macrophages. Macrophages exist in small and large airways above and below the mucus. They may release chemotactic factors and a variety ofmediatos They ingest and degrade antigens and are microbicidal. Interstitial macrophages are in direct contact with the extracellular matrix as well as other cells in pulmonary connective tissue such as fibroblasts. Thus, release of mediators or enzymes by interstitial macrophages can have a profound effect. Pulmonary intravascular macrophages are resident cells within the puhnonary capillaries of some species. They avidly remove particles and pathogens from circulating blood and secrete inammatory mediatos Finaily, pleual macrophages are involved in the fate and consequences of inhaled particles, especially fibes A key attribute of macrophages is motility. Movement is an essential step in phagocytosis. There can be no particle binding or ingestion unless macrophage-particle contact occurs. To what extent and by what mechanisms do alveolar macrophages move on the alveolar epithelium? We have used optical methods as well as magnetometry to describe macrophage motility. Lung macrophages express an array of contractile proteins that are responsible for spreading, migration, phagocytosis, and the controlled intracellular motions of phagosomes and lysosomes. VW have used magnetometric probing ofcytoplasmic motion and rheology for both in vvo studies of macrophage function in animals and humans as well as in in vt studies of macrophages. The<cytoskleton of macrophages and resulting motile events are key in understanding the role of macrophages in relation to <b>particle</b> phagocytosis, <b>translocation,</b> and solubilization...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFor cytosolic {{delivery}} of liposomes containing macromolecular drugs, such as proteins or nucleic acids, {{it would be}} beneficial to bypass endocytosis to prevent degradation in the lysosomes. Recent reports pointed {{to the possibility that}} coupling of TAT-peptides to the outer surface of liposome <b>particles</b> would enable <b>translocation</b> over the cellular plasma membrane. Here, we demonstrate that cellular uptake of TAT-liposomes occurs via endocytosis rather than plasma membrane translocation. The coupling of HIV- 1 derived TAT-peptide to liposomes enhances their binding to ovarian carcinoma cells. The binding was inhibited by the presence of heparin or dextran sulfate, indicating that cell surface proteoglycans are involved in the binding interaction. Furthermore, living confocal microscopy studies revealed that binding of the TAT-liposomes to the plasma membrane is followed by intracellular uptake in vesicular structures. Staining the endosomes and lysosomes demonstrated that fluorescent liposomal labels are present within the endosomal and lysosomal compartments. Furthermore, incubation at low temperature or addition of a metabolic or an endocytosis inhibitor blocked cellular uptake. In conclusion, coupling TAT-peptide to the outer surface of liposomes leads to enhanced endocytosis of the liposomes by ovarian carcinoma cells, rather than direct cytosolic delivery by plasma membrane translocation...|$|R
40|$|We have {{conducted}} a genetic screen {{in order to}} identify ribosomal proteins of Saccharomyces cerevisiae involved in nuclear export of the small subunit precursors. This has led us to distinguish Rps 15 p as a protein dispensable for maturation of the pre- 40 S particles, but whose assembly into the pre-ribosomes is a prerequisite to their nuclear exit. Upon depletion of Rps 15 p, 20 S pre-rRNA is released from the nucleolus and retained in the nucleus, without alteration of the pre-rRNA early cleavages. In contrast, Rps 18 p, which contacts Rps 15 p in the small subunit, is required upstream for pre-rRNA processing at site A 2. Most pre- 40 S specific factors are correctly associated with the intermediate particles accumulating in the nucleus upon Rps 15 p depletion, except the late-binding proteins Tsr 1 p and Rio 2 p. Here we show that these two proteins are dispensable for nuclear exit; instead, they participate in 20 S pre-rRNA processing in the cytoplasm. We conclude that, during the final maturation steps in the nucleus, incorporation of the ribosomal protein Rps 15 p is specifically required to render the pre- 40 S <b>particles</b> competent for <b>translocation</b> to the cytoplasm...|$|R
