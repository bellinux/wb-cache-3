40|$|A {{system that}} uses {{adaptive}} beamforming techniques for mobile Digital Video Broadcasting Satellite (DVB-S) reception is proposed in this paper. The {{purpose is to}} enable DVB-S reception in moving vehicles. Phased arrays are able to electronically track the desired signal during dynamic behaviour of the vehicle the array is mounted on. The proposed system uses blind beamforming to adapt the array steering vector to changing signal (conditions and) directions. Movement of the vehicle, the phased array is mounted on, leads to modulus and <b>phase</b> <b>deviations</b> at the beamformer output. An extended version of the Constant Modulus Algorithm (CMA) algorithm is used to adapt the steering vector weights to compensate for those deviations. For simulation of the proposed system a model of vehicle dynamics is used to generate realistic antenna data.

40|$|The paper investigates <b>phase</b> <b>deviations</b> as {{they occur}} in aeroacoustic array {{measurements}} in open jet wind tunnels. The accuracy of an approximative zero-thickness shear layer model, {{which is used}} in practice to predict the phase shift between source and microphones, is investigated numerically. The exact wave propagation through a generic shear layer is calculated by solving the full linearized Euler equations using a finite element method and by means of geometrical acoustics. The results are taken to determine the <b>phase</b> <b>deviations</b> between the simplified model and the exact case. It is demonstrated that {{the position of the}} zero-thickness shear layer is important for the accuracy at high frequencies. Additionally measurements are made to analyze the phase fluctuations which are generated by the scattering at turbulent structures in the open-jet shear layer. A procedure is proposed to compensate these phase fluctuations and to improve the array efficiency...|$|R
