5000|$|The Education Data Exchange Network (EDEN) is an {{automated}} {{system designed to}} support data transfer among state and local education agencies and the United States Department of Education (ED).EDEN began as a State Data Network pilot test among Oregon, Nebraska and ED in 1998. At the time all reports on federal grant programs were written and stored in <b>paper</b> <b>file</b> cabinets in ED program offices, although many of those reports contained similar, and often inconsistent, information. States, particularly the Council of Chief State School Officers and their data managers, called on ED to automate and streamline the process. Based {{on the success of}} the pilot test, the of Management and Budget (OMB) required ED to institute a Performance-Based Data Management Initiative (PBDMI) in 2000. PBDMI was designed to gather statistics from each state such as school populations within subgroups (race, gender, etc.), graduation rates, school spending, and federal program performance. This initiative resulted in EDEN. It was designed to: ...|$|E

50|$|Beginning in 1979, {{started by}} Steve Jobs {{and led by}} Jef Raskin, the Apple Lisa and Macintosh teams at Apple Computer (which {{included}} {{former members of the}} Xerox PARC group) continued to develop such ideas. The Lisa, released in 1983, featured a high-resolution stationery-based (document-centric) graphical interface atop an advanced hard disk based OS that featured such things as preemptive multitasking and graphically oriented inter-process communication. The comparatively simplified Macintosh, released in 1984 and designed to be lower in cost, was the first commercially successful product to use a multi-panel window interface. A desktop metaphor was used, in which files looked like pieces of <b>paper.</b> <b>File</b> directories looked like file folders. There were a set of desk accessories like a calculator, notepad, and alarm clock that the user could place around the screen as desired; and the user could delete files and folders by dragging them to a trash-can icon on the screen. The Macintosh, in contrast to the Lisa, used a program-centric rather than document-centric design. Apple revisited the document-centric design, in a limited manner, much later with OpenDoc.|$|E
5000|$|Metadata {{has been}} used in various ways as a means of {{cataloging}} items in libraries in both digital and analog format. Such data helps classify, aggregate, identify, and locate a particular book, DVD, magazine or any object a library might hold in its collection. Until the 1980s, many library catalogues used 3x5 inch cards in file drawers to display a book's title, author, subject matter, and an abbreviated alpha-numeric string (call number) which indicated the physical location of the book within the library's shelves. The Dewey Decimal System employed by libraries for the classification of library materials by subject is an early example of metadata usage. Beginning in the 1980s and 1990s, many libraries replaced these <b>paper</b> <b>file</b> cards with computer databases. These computer databases make it much easier and faster for users to do keyword searches. Another form of older metadata collection is the use by US Census Bureau of {{what is known as the}} [...] "Long Form." [...] The Long Form asks questions that are used to create demographic data to find patterns of distribution. Libraries employ metadata in library catalogues, most commonly as part of an Integrated Library Management System. Metadata is obtained by cataloguing resources such as books, periodicals, DVDs, web pages or digital images. This data is stored in the integrated library management system, ILMS, using the MARC metadata standard. The purpose is to direct patrons to the physical or electronic location of items or areas they seek as well as to provide a description of the item/s in question.|$|E
5000|$|Competition {{to receive}} a summer offer from a firm is intense, and {{credentials}} (a student's GPA and class rank, law review or moot court membership, publications, etc.) play a decisive role in determining who is selected. Most offers are received after a three-step interview process. First, during the early fall of their 2L (second year), students at each law school first submit their resumes to a central <b>paper</b> <b>file</b> or online database (such as CRIS or LexisNexis Martindale-Hubbell), from which interviewers selected candidates they wish to interview, based almost entirely on their 1L GPA and class rank. Second, selected students are notified, usually via email, and then schedule a screening interview, either at the law school or at a local hotel; this interview is usually conducted {{by one or more}} attorneys from that firm and is part of most schools' On Campus Interview ("OCI") program, in which firms send recruiters to schools across the country. Finally, students selected from the screening interviews are invited for a final [...] "callback" [...] interview, commonly held at the firm's offices. If the selected student attends school in a place far from the city in which the firm is located, {{it is not unusual for}} the firm to fly the student in and pay for accommodations while he is in town. After the callback, a selected candidate will receive a phone call (usually within 48 hours) informing him that he has been extended an offer. After the summer, early into their 3L (third) years, the vast majority of summer associates receive formal offers to join the firm after graduating school and sitting for the bar exam. Thus, the career path of many law students (at least initially) may be determined long before they ever begin to practice.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim was to}} {{evaluate}} the agreement between computerized insurance data in a large Swedish horse insurance database and {{the information in the}} corresponding clinical records (CR). A random sample of 400 veterinary care and 140 life claims was included. Information on name of the horse, breed and gender, year of birth, specific diagnosis and system diagnosis (e. g. joints, digestive and skeletal) was compared between sources. The concordance for demographic variables was categorized as agreement, disagreement or data missing. For diagnostic information, the categories were agreement, minor disagreement and major disagreement and for system information agreement or disagreement. There were missing values for demographic information in the CR, varying from 2 % for name to 16 % for breed. The overall agreement for demographic information was > 94 % (disregarding missing data), 92 % for system and 84 % for specific diagnosis. For veterinary care and life claims, the observed agreement for diagnosis was 85 and 83 %, minor disagreement 6 and 5 %, and major disagreement 9 and 12 %, respectively. Using the CR data as gold standard, for the systems evaluated (joints, digestive, skeletal, skin and hooves), sensitivity varied between 62 % (skin) and 89 % (digestive) whereas the specificity was > 96 % for all systems. The positive predictive values ranged from 86 % (skin) to 97 % (digestive). Logistic regression analysis was used to examine factors associated with agreement for diagnosis. Analyses were performed separately for veterinary care and life claims. Factors examined were type of visit (clinic/field), treating veterinarian/clinic (categorized as district veterinarians, private practitioners, small clinics, medium clinics and, for the clinics with > or = 20 claims, the specific clinics), computerized or manual CR, processing clerk, whether the CR was included in the <b>paper</b> <b>file,</b> if the claim was rejected or reimbursed, system diagnosis and if a immediate settlement (in analysis for veterinary care claims) or death certificate (in analysis for life claims) was included in the <b>paper</b> <b>file.</b> For veterinary care claims, in the logistic regression model type of visit was significantly associated with agreement, with clinic visits generating better agreement than field visits...|$|E

40|$|Formation of a pseudoknot in the conserved RNA {{core domain}} in the {{ribonucleoprotein}} human telomerase {{is required for}} function. In vitro experiments show that the pseudoknot (PK) is in equilibrium with an extended hairpin (HP) structure. We use molecular simulations of a coarse-grained model, which reproduces most of the salient features of the experimental melting profiles of PK and HP, to show that crowding enhances the stability of PK relative to HP in the wild type and in a mutant associated with dyskeratosis congenita. In monodisperse suspensions, small crowding particles increase the stability of compact structures {{to a greater extent}} than larger crowders. If the sizes of crowders in a binary mixture are smaller than the unfolded RNA, the increase in melting temperature due to the two components is additive. In a ternary mixture of crowders that are larger than the unfolded RNA, which mimics the composition of ribosome, large enzyme complexes and proteins in E. coli, the marginal increase in stability is entirely determined by the smallest component. We predict that crowding can restore partially telomerase activity in mutants, which dramatically decrease the PK stability.
