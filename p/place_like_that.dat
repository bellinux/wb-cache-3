500|$|PolyGram and Working Title Films, who had funded Fargo, backed The Big Lebowski with {{a budget}} of $15million. In casting the film, Joel remarked, [...] "we tend to write both for people we know and have worked with, and some parts without knowing who's {{going to play the}} role. In The Big Lebowski we did write for John [...] and Steve , but we didn't know who was getting the Jeff Bridges role." [...] In {{preparation}} for his role, Bridges met Dowd but actually [...] "drew on myself a lot from back in the Sixties and Seventies. I lived in a little <b>place</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> and did drugs, although I think I was a little more creative than the Dude." [...] The actor went into his own closet with the film's wardrobe person and picked out clothes that he had thought the Dude might wear. He wore his character's clothes home because most of them were his own. The actor also adopted the same physicality as Dowd, including the slouching and his ample belly. Originally, Goodman wanted a different kind of beard for Walter but the Coen brothers insisted on the [...] "Gladiator" [...] or what they called the [...] "Chin Strap" [...] and he thought it would go well with his flattop haircut.|$|E

[...] One of his songs, [...] "All This Time" [...] was borne of a trip through the Canadian wilderness. [...] Of the track's inspiration, Joseph explains, [...] "It humbles you visiting a <b>place</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> Anyone who has an ego problem needs to {{backpack}} through Canada for a while." [...] He is also a regular performer at major Canadian folk festivals, including the Vancouver and Edmonton Folk Music Festivals, and at the annual Greenbelt Festival in the UK.|$|E

2500|$|Patton married Cristina Zuccatosta, an Italian artist, in 1994. The couple divided {{their time}} between San Francisco and Bologna, Italy, until their {{separation}} in 2001. Patton used {{to own a}} home in Bologna and speaks Italian. Regarding his close association with Italy, Patton stated, [...] "It happened after I got married. I married an Italian lady, and I had to get acquainted. Basically, it started with the language because her family and her parents didn't really speak English. I had to learn the language, so I did that. The longer you spend in a <b>place</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> it really sucks you in.

5000|$|In January 2009, Weber, the IHR's director, {{released}} an essay titled, [...] "How Relevant Is Holocaust Revisionism?"

He noted that Holocaust denial had attracted little support over the years: [...] "It’s gotten some support in Iran, or <b>places</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> {{but as far as}} I know, there is no history department supporting writing by these folks." [...] Accordingly, he recommended that emphasis be placed instead on opposing [...] "Jewish-Zionist power", which some commentators claim is a shift to a directly antisemitic position. Since then, the Institute has not published any new articles or books on Holocaust denial.|$|R

The men may be provincials, {{but they are}} certainly citizens; they consult on a common basis. And I repeat that in this, after all, they do achieve what many prophets and righteous men have died to achieve. This plain village, fairly prosperous, fairly equal, untaxed by tyrants and untroubled by wars, is after all the place which reformers have regarded as their aim; whenever reformers have used their wits sufficiently to have any aim. The march to Utopia, the march to the Earthly Paradise, the march to the New Jerusalem, has been very largely the march to Main Street. And the latest modern sensation is a book written to show how wretched it is to live there.|$|R
5000|$|Brennan {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} Glee based on his own experience {{as a member of}} the Prospect High School show choir. He explained: [...] "I find it interesting that there is something in everybody, a longing for something transcendent, particularly in a <b>place</b> <b>like</b> Mt. Prospect, a place that’s very suburban and normal and plain. Even in <b>places</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> there’s this desire to shine. That’s fascinating and very funny to me, especially when people try to accomplish this through show choir - which, to me, is inherently a little ridiculous." [...] In 2005, a choir director at Prospect High was accused of inappropriate behavior with a student and was later convicted of aggravated criminal sexual abuse. Brennan was inspired by these events, and in August 2005, purchased a copy of Screenwriting for Dummies and wrote the first draft of Glee, initially envisioned as a film rather than a television series. He completed the script in 2005, but could not generate interest in the project for several years.|$|R
