40|$|Pound nets are traditional, passive fishing traps {{that have}} been used since the 1870 s to catch estuarine fish species in the Chesapeake Bay. Most {{unwanted}} species captured in the actual <b>pound</b> <b>net</b> can be released alive; however, sea turtles and marine mammals may die if they become entangled in the leader of the net. In 2004, NOAA Fisheries required changes in the construction of <b>pound</b> <b>net</b> leaders in part of the Chesapeake Bay to reduce entanglement rates of sea turtles. To date no actions have been taken to address the bycatch of bottlenose dolphins in <b>pound</b> <b>net</b> leaders. In the summer of 2007, I conducted a pilot study to sample catches of butterfish (Peprilus alepidotus and Peprilus triacanthus) and Spanish mackerel (Scomberomorus maculatus) in a Virginia Beach <b>pound</b> <b>net</b> fishery considering modifications to their leaders to reduce dolphin bycatch. Using these observations, I worked with the Virginia Aquarium to design an experiment to test the new leaders during the 2008 fishing season. The primary goal of this experiment is to determine whether the experimental leader will affect the catch of target fish species. From an analysis of dolphin strandings in Virginia from 1997 - 2004, I found that pound nets accounted for the greatest percentage (50 %) of all documented Human Interaction (HI) strandings. I also used geospatial analyses to examine the distribution of bottlenose dolphin strandings that may be associated with bycatch in pound nets. HI stranded dolphins were found significantly closer to the Virginia Beach pound nets than dolphins that stranded for another reason (No HI) or for an unknown cause (CBD).

40|$|Abstract. —Information on {{the stock}} {{composition}} of mixed-stock fisheries is often needed to develop management regulations for anadromous fishes. Although several methods {{can be used to}} infer stock composition, marking studies have long been identified as a promising approach. Hatchery-reared larval American shad Alosa sapidissima are marked with a river-specific mark and released in stock enhancement programs along the U. S. East Coast. We describe and apply a mark–recovery method for inferring the proportion of the catch in a mixed-stock fishery that originates from a particular river. The method is based on comparing the proportion of the mixed-stock catch with marks from the river with the proportion of the fish returning to the river with marks. We explore the utility of using mass marking of hatchery-reared American shad larvae with tetracycline to determine the stock composition of mixed-stock fisheries of American shad in Virginia. Our analysis focuses on the impact of the former Virginia coastal ocean fishery on fish produced in the James and Pamunkey rivers, Virginia, and on the impact of bycatch in Chesapeake Bay <b>pound</b> <b>nets</b> on Susquehanna River American shad.

Tank experiments were performed with three types of experimental bag nets: a box-shaped net with horizontal upper panel, one with square-pyramid shaped upper panels of 10 degrees (10 degrees slope net), and square-pyramid shaped bag net with upper panel of 20 degrees (20 degrees slope net). Five loggerheads in captivity (SCL: 42. 8 cm- 50. 0 cm) were prepared. The turtle swam around after entering the bag net, and about five minutes later it started to push its head up against the upper panel.

The test chamber is fully instrumented to measure and collect gas and particulate samples as well as to monitor shock phenomenology. Part two is a discussion of the NTS Tactical Demilitarization Demonstration (TaDD) program currently planned for the Area 11 Technical Facility. This project will produce equipment that can dispose of unneeded tactical military rocket motors in a safe, environmentally-friendly, and timely fashion. The initial effort is the development of a demilitarization system for the disposal of excess Shillelagh missiles at the Anniston Army Depot. The prototype for this system will be assembled at the Area 11 facility taking advantage of the inherent infrastructure and proximity to numerous existing structures. Upon completion of testing, the prototype facility will become the test bed for future tactical disposal development activities. It is expected that the research and development techniques, prototype testing and production processes, and expertise developed during the Shillelagh disposal program will be applicable to follow-on tactical missile disposal programs, but with significant cost and schedule advantages...|$|E
5000|$|This {{sturgeon}} is {{a valuable}} gourmet food fish, {{as well as a}} source of specialty products including caviar and isinglass. [...] "In 1860, this species, taken on incidental catches of other fishes, was killed and dumped back in the lake, piled up on shore to dry and be burned, fed to pigs, or dug into the earth as fertilizer." [...] It was even stacked like cordwood and used to fuel steamboats. Once its value was realized, [...] "They were taken by every available means from spearing and jigging to set lines of baited or unbaited hooks laid on the bottom to trap <b>nets,</b> <b>pound</b> <b>nets</b> and gillnets." [...] Over 5 million lb were taken from Lake Erie in a single year. The fishery collapsed, largely by 1900. They have never recovered. Like most sturgeons, the lake sturgeon is rare now and is protected in many areas.|$|R
40|$|Population {{control of}} great {{cormorants}} Phalacrocorax carbo sinensis {{has been suggested}} {{as a tool to}} mitigate fish losses by cormorants foraging in <b>pound</b> <b>nets,</b> gill nets and fykes. The objective of our study was to quantify the difference between first-year birds and older birds in the risk of drowning in fishing gear, and to explore the influence of population size on the proportion of individuals drowning. An index of the proportion of first-year birds and older birds that drowned was obtained for cormorants ringed in the Danish Vorsø colony using resightings of colour-ringed individuals and ring recoveries of individuals found dead. First-year birds were approximately 10 times more likely to drown than older birds. We used ring recoveries of cormorants ringed in Denmark and found dead in Denmark, North Germany and South Sweden (i. e. in the main postbreeding area) to reveal changes over a 25 -year period in the proportion drowned among those recovered. Among first-year birds the proportion drowned declined from 66...|$|R
40|$|The United States Marine Corps {{operates}} 13 Maritime Prepositioning Ships (MPS). Each {{of these}} ships can contain up to 1. 3 million <b>pounds</b> (<b>Net</b> Explosive Weight (NEW)) {{of all types}} of Marine Corps munitions. These ships are periodically returned to Blount Island in the St. Johns River, Jacksonville, Florida, for refurbishment of their equipment. At an NEW of 1. 3 million pounds, the standard value of the inhabited building distance encroaches upon several private dwellings. In order to address this problem, the U. S. Navy has conducted a large scale test (NEW of over 500, 000 pounds) and series of analyses to determine a more realistic estimate of the inhabited building distance. This report presents the background and history of the the problem, describes the set-up and conduct of the event, and summarize the data collected and its interpretation. One outcome of this program was the reduction of both the inhabited building distance and the public traffic route distances by approximately 18 %. These ranges were driven by airblast and not by fragmentation...|$|R
