5|$|The {{flight is}} weak-looking and {{resembles that of}} a bat, with {{fluttering}} interspersed with short glides. When feeding, the birds hang with raised wings and <b>patter</b> on the surface with their feet, but, unlike the Wilson's storm petrel, do not {{look as if they}} are walking on the water. Birds will sometimes settle on the sea. Like other petrels, the European storm petrel cannot walk properly on land, but shuffles on its tarsi; once there is enough room, the bird flaps its wings to support itself on its toes.|$|E
5|$|The {{internal}} {{structure of the}} ear, which has large numbers of auditory neurons, gives an improved ability to detect low-frequency sounds at a distance, which could include rustling made by prey moving in vegetation. The tawny owl's hearing is ten times better than a human's, and it can hunt using this sense {{alone in the dark}} of a woodland on an overcast night, but the <b>patter</b> of raindrops makes it difficult to detect faint sounds, and prolonged wet weather can lead to starvation if the owl cannot hunt effectively.|$|E
5|$|The {{repertory}} system {{ensured that}} the comic <b>patter</b> character who performed {{the role of the}} sorcerer, John Wellington Wells, would become the ruler of the Queen's navy as Sir Joseph Porter in H.M.S. Pinafore, then join the army as Major-General Stanley in The Pirates of Penzance, and so on. Similarly, Mrs. Partlet in The Sorcerer transformed into Little Buttercup in Pinafore, then into Ruth, the piratical maid-of-all-work in Pirates. Relatively unknown performers whom Gilbert and Sullivan engaged early in the collaboration would stay with the company for many years, becoming stars of the Victorian stage. These included George Grossmith, the principal comic; Rutland Barrington, the lyric baritone; Richard Temple, the bass-baritone; and Jessie Bond, the mezzo-soprano soubrette.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{the loss}} of his father, Skelton went to work as early as the age of seven, selling {{newspapers}} and doing other odd jobs to help his family, who had lost the family store and their home. He quickly learned the newsboy's <b>patter</b> and would keep it up until a prospective buyer bought a copy of the paper just to quiet him. According to later accounts, Skelton's early interest in becoming an entertainer stemmed from an incident that took place in Vincennes around 1923, when a stranger, supposedly the comedian Ed Wynn, approached Skelton, who was the newsboy selling papers outside a Vincennes theater. When the man asked Skelton what events were going on in town, Skelton suggested he see the new show in town. The man purchased every paper Skelton had, providing enough money for the boy to purchase a ticket for himself. The stranger {{turned out to be one}} of the show's stars, who later took the boy backstage to introduce him to the other performers. The experience prompted Skelton, who had already shown comedic tendencies, to pursue a career as a performer.|$|E

25|$|Yet another {{sub-classification}} {{can be made}} {{according to}} acting skills or requirements, for example the Basso Buffo who often must be a specialist in <b>patter</b> {{as well as a}} comic actor. This is carried out in detail in the Fach system of German speaking countries, where historically opera and spoken drama were often put on by the same repertory company.|$|E
25|$|As well as {{the main}} dialects, Edinburgh, Dundee and Glasgow (see Glasgow <b>patter)</b> have local {{variations}} on an Anglicised form of Central Scots. In Aberdeen, Mid Northern Scots is spoken by a minority. Due to their being roughly near {{the border between the}} two dialects, places like Dundee and Perth can contain elements and influences of both Northern and Central Scots.|$|E
25|$|Corporate magic {{or trade}} show magic uses magic as a {{communication}} and sales tool, {{as opposed to just}} straightforward entertainment.

They run workshops and can sometimes be found at trade shows, where their <b>patter</b> and illusions enhance an entertaining presentation of the products offered by their corporate sponsors. Pioneer performers in this arena include Eddie Tullock and Guy Bavli.|$|E

25|$|During {{the early}} 1970s, Horowitz {{developed}} a close friendship with Huey P. Newton, {{founder of the}} Black Panther Party. Horowitz later portrayed Newton as equal parts gangster, terrorist, intellectual, and media celebrity. As part of their work together, Horowitz helped raise money for, and assisted the Panthers with, the running of a school for poor children in Oakland. He recommended that Newton hire Betty Van <b>Patter</b> as bookkeeper; she was then working for Ramparts. In December 1974, Van Patter's body was found floating in San Francisco Harbor; she had been murdered. Horowitz has {{said he believes the}} Panthers were behind the killing.|$|E

500|$|Flea circuses {{provided}} entertainment to {{nineteenth century}} audiences. These circuses, extremely popular in Europe from 1830 onwards, featured fleas dressed as humans or towing miniature carts, chariots, rollers or cannon.

500|$|The judge's song, [...] "When I, good friends, {{was called}} to the Bar" [...] was {{followed}} by a string of similar <b>patter</b> songs that would come to epitomise Gilbert and Sullivan's collaboration. [...] In these, often, a [...] "dignified personage [...] supply a humorous biography of himself." [...] Just as in Gilbert's earlier play, The Palace of Truth, in these songs, the characters [...] "na√Øvely reveal their innermost thoughts, unconscious of their egotism, vanity, baseness, or cruelty". [...] Crowther points out that such revelations work particularly well in Trial by Jury, because people commonly expect [...] "characters singing in opera/operetta will communicate at a deeper level of truth than they would in mere speech." [...] In [...] "When I, good friends", the judge outlines the path of corruption that led to his becoming a judge, and this, too, would set the pattern for many of the <b>patter</b> songs in Gilbert and Sullivan operas to follow.|$|E
