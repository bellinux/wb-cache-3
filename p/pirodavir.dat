40|$|<b>Pirodavir</b> (R 77975) is the {{prototype}} of a novel class of broad-spectrum antipicornavirus compounds. Although its predecessor, R 61837, a substituted phenyl-pyridazinamine, was effective in inhibiting 80 % of 100 serotypes tested (EC 80) at concentrations above 32 micrograms/ml, <b>pirodavir</b> inhibits the same percentage of viruses at 0. 064 micrograms/ml. Whereas R 61837 was active almost exclusively against rhinovirus serotypes of antiviral group B, <b>pirodavir</b> is broad spectrum {{in that it is}} highly active against both group A and group B rhinovirus serotypes. <b>Pirodavir</b> is also effective in inhibiting 16 enteroviruses, with an EC 80 of 1. 3 micrograms/ml. Susceptible rhinovirus serotypes were rendered noninfectious by direct contact with the antiviral compound. Their infectivity was not restored by dilution of virus-drug complexes, but was regained by organic solvent extraction of the compound for most serotypes. Neutralized viruses became stabilized to acid and heat, strongly suggesting a direct interaction of the compounds with viral capsid proteins. Mutants resistant to R 61837 (up to 85 times the MIC) were shown to bear some cross-resistance (up to 23 times the MIC) to the new compound, indicating that <b>pirodavir</b> also binds into the hydrophobic pocket beneath the canyon floor of rhinoviruses. <b>Pirodavir</b> acts at an early stage of the viral replication cycle (up to 40 min after infection) and reduces the yield of selected rhinoviruses 1, 000 - to 100, 000 -fold in a single round of replication.

40|$|A novel small molecule, H 1 PVAT, was {{identified}} as a potent and selective inhibitor of the in vitro replication of all three poliovirus serotypes, whereas no activity was observed against other enteroviruses. Time-of-drug-addition studies revealed that the compound interfered with an early stage of virus replication. Four independently-selected H 1 PVAT-resistant virus variants uniformly carried the single amino acid substitution I 194 F in the VP 1 capsid protein. Poliovirus type 1 strain Sabin, reverse-engineered to contain this substitution, proved to be completely insensitive to the antiviral effect of H 1 PVAT and was cross-resistant to the capsid-binding inhibitors V- 073 and <b>pirodavir.</b> The VP 1 I 194 F mutant had a smaller plaque phenotype than wild-type virus, and the amino acid substitution rendered the virus more susceptible to heat inactivation. Both for the wild-type and VP 1 I 194 F mutant virus, the presence of H 1 PVAT increased the temperature at which the virus was inactivated, providing evidence that the compound interacts with the viral capsid, and that capsid stabilization and antiviral activity are not necessarily correlated. Molecular modeling suggested that H 1 PVAT binds with high affinity in the pocket underneath the floor of the canyon that is involved in receptor binding. Introduction of the I 194 F substitution in the model of VP 1 induced a slight concerted rearrangement of the core β-barrel in this pocket, which disfavors binding of the compound. Taken together, the compound scaffold, to which H 1 PVAT belongs, may represent another promising class of poliovirus capsid-binding inhibitors next to V- 073 and <b>pirodavir.</b> Potent antivirals against poliovirus will be essential in the poliovirus eradication end-game. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Background. The Enterovirus genus of the Picornaviridae is {{represented}} by several viral pathogens {{that are associated with}} human disease, namely Poliovirus 1, Enterovirus 71 and Rhinoviruses. Enterovirus 71 has been associated with encephalitis, while Rhinoviruses are a major cause of asthma exacerbations and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Based on the structure of both pleconaril and <b>pirodavir,</b> we previously synthesized some original compounds as potential inhibitors of Rhinovirus replication. Methods. These compounds were explored for in vitro antiviral potential on other human pathogenic Enteroviruses, namely Enterovirus 71 on rhabdo-myosarcoma cells, Coxsackievirus B 3 on Vero cells, Poliovirus 1 and Echovirus 11 on BGM cells. Results. Activity was confirmed for compound against Rhinovirus 14. Furthermore, few compounds showed a cell-protective effect on Enterovirus 71, presented a marked improvement as compared to the reference drug pleconaril for inhibitory activity on both Enterovirus 71 and Poliovirus 1. The most striking observation was the clear cell protective effect for the set of analogues in a virus-cell-based assay for Echovirus 11 with an effective concentration (EC 50) as low as 0. 3 [*]µM (Selectivity index or SI[*]=[*] 483), and selectivity indexes greater than 857 (EC 50 [*]=[*] 0. 6 [*]µM) and 1524 (EC 50 [*]=[*] 0. 33 [*]µM).

40|$|Enterovirus-D 68 was {{isolated}} {{for the first}} time in California in 1962 in children with pneumonia and bronchiolitis. Until 2008, the detection of EV-D 68 infections has been very rare. Since 2008 EV-D 68 got increased attention with different clusters of infections worldwide. In a recent epidemic in the United States, 1. 153 people were confirmed with respiratory illness caused by EV-D 68, mostly children with asthma or a history of wheezing. The virus also has been associated occasionally with polio-like illness (muscle weakness or paralysis). Moreover, EV-D 68 was detected in specimens from 14 patients who died. EV-D 68 thus emerged as a considerable global health threat, requiring the development of effective antiviral treatment. To assess the activity of antiviral molecules against EV-D 68 a panel of 7 clinical isolates was selected consisting of representative strains of the three major genogroups. The following inhibitors were included in this study: (i) two capsid-binding compounds, pleconaril and pirodavir; (ii) the protease inhibitor rupintrivir; (iii) the host cell-targeting compound enviroxime; and (iv) the broad-spectrum antivirals favipiravir (T- 705) and arbidol. Our preliminary results with the 7 clinical isolates reveal that pleconaril and rupintrivir efficiently inhibited in vitro EV-D 68 replication. Favipiravir (recently approved in Japan to treat influenza virus infections) and enviroxime also resulted in a clear antiviral effect.

40|$|Several {{viruses that}} belong to the {{enterovirus}} genus are important human pathogens, which include polioviruses (PV), rhinoviruses (HRV) and enterovirus 71 (EV 71). These viruses can cause relatively mild symptoms such as the “common cold” and skin rash {{but they are also}} the cause of various serious and potentially life-threatening complications such as meningitis, encephalitis, myocarditis and acute flaccid paralysis. There are no antiviral drugs available {{that can be used to}} treat enteroviral infections. The discovery and characterization of such drugs as well as the development of tools and models is the topic of this PhD thesis. In the PV end-game, it would be essential to have antivirals available to treat chronic PV shedders and to combat potential outbreaks in the “post oral poliovirus vaccine era”. A novel anti-PV compound, H 1 PVAT, is discovered and the mechanism of action is elucidated as part of this PhD project. We showed that the compound acts early in the viral lifecycle. Selection of H 1 PVAT-resistant PV 1 Sabin yielded viral variants that carry an I 194 F amino acid substitution in capsid protein VP 1; this virus is completely insensitive to the antiviral effect of H 1 PVAT. In addition, two other capsid binding compounds V- 073 and <b>pirodavir</b> are also no longer active against this mutant virus, which is less fit than wild type virus. Using thermo-stability assays we demonstrated that the compound protects PV against heat inactivation, which suggests a direct interaction between the viral capsid and H 1 PVAT. A modelling study revealed that H 1 PVAT is able to bind the capsid in the same pocket as where V- 073 and <b>pirodavir</b> bind, which is located under the canyon floor. Antiviral testing against EV 71 is usually performed against the arbitrarily selected prototype strain BrCr, which is not representative for all EV 71 strains. Moreover, capsid binding compound pleconaril is in some studies reported to be active against EV 71, whereas in others it lacks activity. Therefore, the activity of a selection of antivirals, including pleconaril, was assessed against a panel of 21 EV 71 isolates that were chosen to represent the different circulating genogroups. The antivirals tested included three capsid binding compounds, two protease inhibitors and a host cell targeting compound. No significant differences in antiviral activity were observed for any of the compounds against the different viral isolates. We demonstrated for once and for all that pleconaril is devoid of any anti-EV 71 activity. A molecular modelling study was performed in which the binding of pleconaril, vapendavir and <b>pirodavir</b> with the viral capsid was compared. This revealed that pleconaril lacks an (probably) essential hydrogen bond with the viral capsid, which may explain lack of anti-EV 71 activity. This study thus definitively proves that pleconaril should not be used to treat infections with EV 71. We studied the mechanism of anti-enterovirus activity of hydantoin. This antiviral, already discovered in 1997, is believed to act solely at the stage of viral morphogenesis. However in an experiment, in which we used hydantoin as a control compound, we obtained results that challenged this hypothesis. We demonstrated using infectious virus assays, qPCR and replicon assays that hydantoin, in addition to its inhibitory effect on morphogenesis, is also an inhibitor of viral RNA synthesis. The compound is thus endowed with a dual mechanism of action by which it inhibits enterovirus replication. We also identified on a novel inhibitor of in vitro enterovirus replication named “PHAR 193852 ”. The molecule is active against many enteroviruses but lacks activity against HRV’s. PHAR 193852 -resistant PV 1 Sabin variants were selected and were shown to carry mutations in the 3 A gene and in stem loop V of the Internal Ribosome Entry Site (IRES). Introduction of the individual 3 A or IRES mutation in a Sabin infectious clone did not yield resistant virus. Only when both mutations are introduced together, the virus becomes resistant against the antiviral effect of PHAR 193852. The mutations do not seem to influence replication efficiency of the virus. Unlike some other compounds that select for the same resistance mutations in 3 A, PHAR 193852 does not inhibit phospatidylinositol- 4 -kinase III β or oxysterol-binding protein. The precise mechanism of action of PHAR 193852 remains to be studied. To be able to assess efficacy of EV 71 inhibitors in a relevant small animal infection model we developed an EV 71 SCID mouse model. In this model, infection of the mice is performed using EV 71 strain # 812 (genogroup C 2), or with a mouse adapted variant of this virus (# 812 /MA) that we generated. Both strains were shown to cause paralysis of the hind limbs. However, it takes more time for strain # 812 to cause neurological disease, which demonstrates that the mouse adapted virus is indeed more neurovirulent. Using qPCR analysis on 10 different mouse tissue types it was demonstrated that EV 71 strain # 812 /MA is neurotropic, as high viral genome copy numbers were detected in the CNS. In contrast, the EV 71 parent virus, primarily replicates in the lungs after inoculation and becomes only at a later stage neurotropic. Using immunohistochemistry we showed that specifically the motor neurons in the CNS are targeted by the mouse adapted virus in SCID mice, hence explaining the paralysis observed. Virus isolated form the CNS of EV 71 # 812 infected SCID mice carried the V 135 I amino acid substitution in VP 2 (as compared to the inoculum), but in virus isolated from other tissue types this substitution was absent. We found that isoleucine 135 of VP 2 was already present in the more neurovirulent EV 71 # 812 /MA inoculum. This residue, which is located at the surface of the viral capsid, is probably of critical importance for neurotropism and neurovirulence of EV 71 in SCID mice. Gene and protein expression of the two known EV 71 receptors, SCARB 2 and PSGL- 1 was determined in 10 different tissue types using RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry. No correlation between the expression of these receptors and the tissue tropism of EV 71 was found. The goal of developing a relevant EV 71 small animal model was to be able to assess the efficacy of anti-EV 71 compounds in vivo. As a proof of concept we showed that, using the SCID mouse EV 71 infection model, the enterovirus 3 C protease inhibitor rupintrivir provides no protective effect against EV 71 # 812 /MA induced paralysis. Although the compound inhibits the in vitro replication of EV 71 with nM potency, most likely rupintrivir is unable to enter the CNS in sufficiently high concentrations, emphasising the importance of this model to assess the efficacy of novel EV 71 inhibitors. status: accepte...|$|E

Vaccinationto prevent rhinovirus infections seems not to be feasible, since to date more than 150 different genotypes are known and the number is still rising. Development of small molecule inhibitors of rhinovirus replicationis ongoing since the 80 s; however no drugs are yet available for the treatment of these infections. In the 80 s and 90 s, a number of rhinovirus inhibitors were evaluated in clinical studies for the treatment of common colds in otherwise healthy persons but none of them was approved. Nowadays, the new indication for the treatment of asthma and COPD exacerbations renewed the interest in the development of rhinovirus inhibitors. Since the path towards successful therapy of rhinovirus-induced COPD exacerbations not only involves (a) potent and broad-spectrum inhibitor(s), the different challenges on this road are discussed in ChapterI. The rhinovirus replication cycle consists out several stages that, theoretically, all can be the interfered with during drug treatment. The rhinovirus capsid {{is one of the best}} characterized antiviral targets in the viral lifecycle. A group of chemically diverse compounds, known as capsid binders, inhibit uncoating (and in some cases receptor attachment) of the virus through stabilization of the capsid. The capsid binders, including pleconaril, <b>pirodavir</b> and vapendavir, all interactwith a hydrophobic pocket underneath a canyon that surrounds the 5  fold axis in the capsid. In a large-scale, cell-based antiviral screening effort, we identified a benzonitrile analogue (LPCRW_ 0005, Chapter II) as a selective inhibitor of human rhinovirus 14 (HRV 14) replication. Further characterisation of the compound confirmed that it acts as a capsid binder. However, the compound has a chemical structure that is markedly smaller than that of other known capsid binders. In Chapter II. annex, we explored the antiviral activity of a panel of novel <b>pirodavir</b> analogues with modifications of the central hydrocarbon chain. The activity of these analogues against six prototype strains of the enterovirus genus was evaluated. Additionally, we characterised the antiviral activity and mechanism of action of ca 603, one of the most active congeners in the series. Due to the lack of proofreading of the viral polymerase, RNA-virus strains are not genetically uniform but consist of a quasispecies swarm. When drug pressure is applied tothis quasispecies, the drug-insensitive variants or the ones less susceptible to the drug will still be able to replicate. The rise of drug-resistant variants during therapy is a well-known problem during the treatment of chronic viral infections such as those caused by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV). Also for acute viral infections such as those caused by influenza viruses, drug-resistance has been observed. During the clinical development of capsid binders, drug-resistant rhinovirus variants were rapidly detected. In vitro, resistance selection is however a useful tool to identify the target of the compound. In Chapter III, we describe two resistance selectionmethods used for both capsid binders and non-capsid binders. In the first method, the virus is passaged in suboptimal compound concentrations which are gradually increased between the passages. Rhinovirus variants resistant to capsid binders are relatively easy to obtain by this method. However, a higher number of passages is needed to obtain virus resistant to a non-capsid binder, such as a protease inhibitor. Therefore a second method based on clonal selection was used and this method has proven to be a fast way to determine the primary compound-resistant mutations in a rhinovirus, compared to serial passage. In a large-scale, cell-based antiviral screening effort, we identified R 030987 as a broad-spectrum inhibitor of a representative panel of the two species HRV-A and HRV-B (Chapter IV). R 030987 acted, like the capsid binders, at an early stage of the replication cycle. Surprisingly, R 030987 did notstabilise the capsid and pleconaril-resistant HRV 14 variants did not show cross resistance to R 030987, suggesting a different mode of action. R 030987 -resistant HRV 14 carried mutations in the inner capsid protein VP 4, which is involved in both uncoating and assembly of the virus. Furtherexperiments are ongoing to understand the involvement of this small hydrophobic protein the mechanism of action of the rhinovirus inhibitor R 0303987. Viral proteases are crucial in the replication of the virus and are therefore promising drug targets. In Chapter V, we discuss the antiviral activity of SG 85, a peptidic α,β-unsaturated ethyl ester that was developed during a structure-based design of Michael acceptor inhibitors of the enterovirus 68 3 C protease. Designed to be a broad-spectrum enterovirus inhibitor, SG 85 inhibitsin vitro both rhinovirus A genotypes from the minor and major receptor group, and rhinovirus B genotypes. A low-level SG 85 -resistant HRV 14 variant was obtained by clonal selection and genotyping of this variant revealed a double amino acid mutation in the 3 C protease. One of these residues was also reported to be mutated in HRV 14 resistant to rupintrivir, another 3 C protease inhibitor. In a crystal structure of the enterovirus 68 3 C protease complexed with SG 85, the corresponding residue to the second mutated amino acid was observed to interact with the compound. The absence of a robust rhinovirus mouse model to evaluate antiviral agents led to the use of a surrogate virus, Coxsackie virus B 4 (CVB 4), ina pancreatitis mouse model. Since that SG 85 is only active in a µMrange against this related enterovirus CVB 4 compared to the activity against the rhinovirus strains (nM range),we therefore did not expected a potent effect in this infectious mouse model. Treatment with SG 85 did not reduce viral replication in the treated mice, however a modest effect on the clinical course of the disease was observed. In conclusion, we describe four small molecule inhibitors of rhinovirus replication. With these antiviral molecules, different stages of the viral lifecycle were targeted. Capsid binders LPCRW_ 0005 and ca 603 are early-stage inhibitors that stabilise the capsid and thereby prevent rhinovirus replication. R 030987 was also identified as an early-stage inhibitor, however thecompound has a mechanism of action that differs from that of the capsidbinder pleconaril. The precise involvement of the inner capsid protein VP 4 in the mechanism of action of R 030987 has yet to be elucidated. However, seen the crucial role of VP 4 during uncoating and RNA release, we identified an inhibitor class with a new and promising target in the replication cycle. Another well-known viral target is the 3 C protease. The 3 C protease inhibitors, such as the herein characterised SG 85, inhibit the vital processing of the viral polyprotein. Rhinoviruses do not only cause mild and self-limiting upper respiratory tract infections, but are also responsible for a great percentage of virus-induced asthma and COPD exacerbations. To lower the burden of these respiratory infections, the development of small molecules as described in this thesis is urgently needed. nrpages: 141 status: publishe...|$|E
