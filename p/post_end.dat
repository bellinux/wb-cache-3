40|$|SummaryAimThe aim of {{our study}} {{was to assess the}} {{efficacy}} of pulmonary rehabilitation in addition to regular chest physiotherapy in non cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis. MethodsThirty patients with clinically significant bronchiectasis and limited exercise tolerance were randomized into either the control group receiving chest physiotherapy (8  weeks) or into the intervention group, receiving pulmonary rehabilitation in addition to chest physiotherapy (8  weeks). Both groups were encouraged to maintain their exercise program and or chest physiotherapy, following completion of the study. ResultsEnd of training (8  weeks) No improvement in control group. In the intervention group, incremental shuttle walk test (ISWT) improved by 56. 7  m (p =  0. 03), endurance walk test (EWT) by 193. 3  m (p =  0. 01), Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ) improved by 2. 6 units (p <  0. 001) and St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) by 8 units (p <  0. 001). At 20 weeks (12  weeks <b>post</b> <b>end</b> of training) No improvement in control group. In the intervention group, ISWT improved by 80  m (p =  0. 04) and EWT by 247. 5  m (p =  0. 003). LCQ improved by 4. 4 units (p <  0. 001) and SGRQ by 4 units (p <  0. 001). ConclusionPulmonary rehabilitation in addition to regular chest physiotherapy, improves exercise tolerance and health related quality of life in non cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis and the benefit was sustained at 12 weeks <b>post</b> <b>end</b> of pulmonary rehabilitation.

30|$|<b>Post</b> <b>end</b> expiratory {{pressure}} (PEEP) reduces {{the collapse of}} alveoli during the expiratory phases due to its effect on functional residual capacity, which provides great support during mechanical ventilation in certain pathophysiological progress, such as severe pneumonia, atelectasis, ARDS, heart failure and pulmonary edema (Max et al. 1997). However, the benefits may come with certain adverse effects. Among them, hemodynamic disturbances drew {{a lot of attention}} from clinicians (Rajacich et al. 1988). Regarding to this issue, invasive measures such as Pulse Indicated Continuous Cardiac Output (Picco) monitoring has been introduced to help titrate PEEP in mechanically ventilated patients (Horster et al. 2012). But such invasive methods may aggravate patients’ affliction, with mechanical and infectious side effects, and proved not to change patients’ outcomes (Pavlovic et al. 2016). In this study we investigated the effects of increasing PEEP from 0 to 5 to 10  cmH 2 O on a novel parameter pleth variability index (PVI), a non-invasive hemodynamic indicator to help optimize PEEP settings in ventilated patients.|$|E

40|$|The {{accelerator}} {{production of}} platinum isotopes was investigated at the Brookhaven Linac Isotope Producer (BLIP). In this study high purity natural platinum foils were irradiated at 53. 2, 65. 7, 105. 2, 151. 9, 162. 9 and 173. 3. MeV. The irradiated foils were digested in aqua regia and then converted to their hydrochloride salt with concentrated hydrochloric acid before analyzing by gamma spectrometry periodically {{for at least}} 10 days <b>post</b> <b>end</b> of bombardment. A wide range of platinum (Pt), gold (Au) and iridium (Ir) isotopes were identified. Effective cross sections at BLIP for Pt- 188, Pt- 189, Pt- 191 and Pt- 195 m were compared to literature and theoretical cross sections determined using Empire- 3. 2. The majority of the effective cross sections (< 70 [*]MeV) confirm those reported in the literature. While the absolute values of the theoretical cross sections were up to a factor of 3 lower, Empire 3. 2 modeled thresholds and maxima correlated well with experimental values. Preliminary evaluation into a rapid separation of Pt isotopes from high levels of Ir and Au isotopes {{proved to be a}} promising approach for large scale production. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that with the use of isotopically enriched target material accelerator production of selected platinum isotopes is feasible over a wide proton energy range...|$|E
40|$|Part I: A {{study has}} been made of the unusual {{behavior}} that solid hexamminecobalt(III) chloride exhibits when examined by the technique of nuclear magnetic resonance absorption. From the examples of substances exhibiting similar behavior to this one, the conclusion is reached that some sort of internal motion is taking place within the solid. On the basis {{of the structure of the}} hexamminecobalt(III) ion, and from information gathered on related ions, it is postulated that the motion involved is the rotation of the whole complex ion in the crystal lattice. From a study of the nuclear magnetic resonance absorption line width for the protons in the complex ion as a function of temperature, the motion is described in terms of a rate process. The general theory of nuclear magnetic resonance is discussed, and in particular the application of this technique to the study of rate processes. The design and construction of a nuclear magnetic resonance spectrograph are described. Part II: An instrument has been developed for automatic control of coulometric titrations employing the dual indicator electrode amperometric end point. The instrument is capable of detecting the end of the titration and stopping the generation, freeing the analyst of this task. The titration is stopped at a pre-set indicator current, either as a "dead stop" end point or as a preliminary operation to determining the exact end point by extrapolation of the <b>post</b> <b>end</b> point current to zero. The operation of the instrument on three different types of coulometric titrations is described. ...|$|E
40|$|Background Pressure ulcers {{represent}} a major burden to patients, carers and the healthcare system, affecting approximately 1 in 17 hospital and 1 in 20 community patients. They impact greatly on an individual’s functional status and health-related quality of life. The mainstay of pressure ulcer prevention practice is {{the provision of}} pressure redistribution support surfaces and patient repositioning. The aim of the PRESSURE 2 study is to compare the two main mattress types utilised within the NHS: high-specification foam and alternating pressure mattresses, {{in the prevention of}} pressure ulcers. Methods/Design PRESSURE 2 is a multicentre, open-label, randomised, double triangular, group sequential, parallel group trial. A maximum of 2954 ‘high-risk’ patients with evidence of acute illness will be randomised on a 1 : 1 basis to receive either a high-specification foam mattress or alternating-pressure mattress in conjunction with an electric profiling bed frame. The primary objective of the trial is to compare mattresses in terms of the time to developing a new Category 2 or above pressure ulcer by 30 days <b>post</b> <b>end</b> of treatment phase. Secondary endpoints include time to developing new Category 1 and 3 or above pressure ulcers, time to healing of pre-existing Category 2 pressure ulcers, health-related quality of life, cost-effectiveness, incidence of mattress change and safety. Validation objectives are to determine the responsiveness of the Pressure Ulcer Quality of Life-Prevention instrument and the feasibility of having a blinded endpoint assessment using photography. The trial will have a maximum of three planned analyses with unequally spaced reviews at event-driven coherent cut-points. The futility boundaries are constructed as non-binding to allow a decision for stopping early to be overruled by the Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee. Discussion The double triangular, group sequential design of the PRESSURE 2 trial will provide an efficient design through the possibility of early stopping for demonstrating either superiority, inferiority of mattresses or futility of the trial. The trial optimises the potential for producing robust clinical evidence on the effectiveness of two commonly used mattresses in clinical practice earlier than in a conventional design...|$|E

40|$|To assess {{changes in}} food sources of omega- 3 fatty acids by heart {{patients}} {{participating in a}} nutrition education program. To increase omega- 3 fatty acid intakes and knowledge of omega- 3 fatty acids in heart patients. Experimental design with repeated measures. The outcome measure was dietary omega- 3 fatty acid intakes in g/day. Results are also given on servings of foods providing omega- 3 fatty acids from eleven food groups. The major methods for collecting data were an omega- 3 fatty acid food frequency questionnaire, a demographic form, a medical history form, and a decisional balance worksheet. The food frequency questionnaire was administered at baseline, one month post (midpoint), and two months <b>post</b> (<b>end).</b> Participants were 36 adults (15 males, 21 females) recruited from a local heart clinic. This was an eight week study that included a two hour omega- 3 fatty acid nutrition education program during week one. Decisional Balance was used during {{the second week of}} the program in a one-on-one meeting with a registered dietitian for participants in the intervention group A. Members of the intervention group B received a follow-up phone call during the second week instead. Both groups received follow-up telephone calls at weeks three and seven. The omega- 3 fatty acid daily intakes were determined using Microsoft Excel, 2000 package. Two-way repeated measures ANOVAs with post-hoc tests, Least Significant Difference were used to assess differences in dietary omega- 3 fatty acid intake over time. Post-hoc tests indicated a significant increase in omega- 3 fatty acid intakes between baseline and midpoint (P 3 ̆c. 001), and from baseline and end (P 3 ̆c. 014). This study depicts omega- 3 fatty acid intakes in Midwestern heart patients. This nutrition education program was designed to increase participants omega- 3 fatty acid intakes and knowledge and could be used by health care providers who work with populations that will benefit from consuming more dietary omega- 3 fatty acids. These results can facilitate future omega- 3 fatty acid interventions, and also offer clinical applications by identifying foods that may be beneficial to change. ...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION Oleylphosphocholine (OlPC) is in {{the same}} {{chemical}} class as miltefosine (MIL) and was shown to be of superior efficacy and safety at equivalent doses (Fortin et al. 2012; 2014). In the current study, the pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of OlPC were evaluated in hamsters following single oral dose administration. The prophylactic activity of the drug was also explored to establish exposure-activity relationships. Finally, based on knowledge gained on PK, the curative efficacy of a 2 × 5 days administration of 20 mg/kg was tested {{in the context of a}} longer post-treatment evaluation period. METHODS Female golden hamsters (4 - 8 /group) were administered single oral doses of 20, 50 and 100 mg/kg and blood samples were collected after 2, 6, 24, 32, 72 and 168 h for analysis. For prophylactic studies hamsters (6 - 7 /gr) were given a 100 mg/kg single-dose on day - 7, - 4, - 1 or - 4 h prior to infection. The animals were infected on day 0 with 2 × 107 amastigotes of L. infantum and parasitic burdens were measured in the liver, spleen and bone marrow on day 21. In the curative model, the animals (6 /gr) were infected on day 0 and treatment started on day 21. OlPC and MIL were orally dosed at 20 mg/kg for 2 × 5 days. Amastigote burdens were determined on day 42 (10 days <b>post</b> <b>end</b> of treatment, dpt) or day 72 (40 dpt). RESULTS OlPC had an elimination t 1 / 2 of ∼l 50 hrs and doseproportionality was seen between 20, 50 and 100 mg/kg. A onecompartment disposition model with first-order absorption and elimination fitted best the data. The prophylactic activity of OlPC was in agreement with respective drug exposures, showing dose-dependent residual activity. Interestingly, a 100 mg/kg single dose administered on - 4 day still reduced the overall parasitic burden by ∼l 50 %. In the curative model, a ≥ 99 % clearance of the infection was observed at 10 dpt in all OlPCtreated animals and remained the same at 40 dpt. For MIL, a good efficacy was measured at 10 dpt (98, > 99 and 90 % of reduction in liver, spleen and bone marrow), but the parasite loads had increased at 40 dpt (67, 99 and 79 %, respectively), reflecting relapse of the infection and inferiority to OlPC. CONCLUSION This study reveals that total OlPC plasma exposure is a good predictor of the prophylactic and curative efficacy in the hamster VL model. Translated to human, these results suggest that the daily dosing of OlPC will be adjustable to avoid side effects while retaining maximum drug efficacy...|$|E
