40|$|INTRODUCTION Significant {{observational}} {{evidence exists}} suggesting that some jet streaks on the <b>polar-front</b> <b>jet</b> stream are the balanced {{response to the}} superposition of monopolar and dipolar vortices of mesoscale dimensions with the enhanced potential vorticity (PV) gradients that constitute the extratropical tropopause and that coincide with the <b>polar-front</b> <b>jet</b> stream (e. g., Cunningham and Keyser 1996; Pyle 1997; Hakim 1999). These vortex features typically exhibit closed contours of PV on tropopause-intersecting isentropes and closed contours of potential temperature on surfaces of constant PV defining the dynamic tropopause. In addition, these vortices often are long lived, with observed life cycles in excess of two weeks (e. g., Bosart et al. 1996; Pyle 1997), during which time they {{may be associated with}} multiple, distinct jet streaks (Pyle 1997).

40|$|An {{association}} is discussed among a midlatitude storm track, a westerly <b>polar-front</b> <b>jet</b> stream and an underlying oceanic frontal zone. Their close {{association is}} observed when a subtropical jet stream is weak, {{as in the}} Southern Hemisphere summer or in the North Atlantic. Along a near-surface baroclinic zone that tends to be anchored around a frontal zone, storm track activity is enhanced within a well-defined <b>polar-front</b> <b>jet</b> with modest core velocity. This eddy-driven jet exhibits a deep structure with the strong surface westerlies maintained mainly through a poleward eddy heat flux. The westerly wind stress exerted along the frontal zone acts to maintain it by driv-ing the oceanic current system, suggestive of a feedback loop via midlatitude atmos-phere–ocean interaction. It is argued that {{the context of this}} feedback must be included in interpreting the tropospheric general circulation and its variability. In fact, decadal-scale sea–surface temperature anomalies observed in the North Pacific subarctic frontal zone controlled the anomalous heat release to the atmosphere. Seemingly, the local storm track responded consistently to the decadal-scale shift of the frontal axis, acting to reinforce basin-scale flow anomalies. Over the North and South Pacific, the association is disturbed in winter by an intensified subtropical jet that traps eddy activity into its sharp core. The trapping impairs baroclinic interaction of upper-level eddies with the surface baroclinicity along a midlatitude oceanic front, leading to the suppression of eddy activity as observed in midwinter over the North Pacific. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{variability}} of East Asian upper level westerly jets in winter is studied {{with regard to}} the concurrent existence of subtropical jet (East Asian subtropical jet (EASJ)) and <b>polar‐front</b> <b>jet</b> (East Asian <b>polar‐front</b> <b>jet</b> (EAPJ)) using the National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research reanalysis. In the distribution of jet occurrence revealed in 6 ‐hourly data, two jet branches along 30 °N and 55 °N, corresponding to locations of EASJ and EAPJ, respectively, are separated over the Tibetan Plateau. The leading two modes of zonal‐mean zonal wind in East Asia extracted from a mass‐weighted empirical orthogonal function analysis are characterized by the intensity changes and location displacements of two jets. The key regions for EASJ and EAPJ are then defined to represent variabilities of these two jets. Correlation analysis indicates that the subseasonal variation of EAPJ precedes EASJ by around 5 [*]days, which can be interpreted as wave‐mean flow interactions via synoptic‐scale transient eddy activities. Based on the pentad intensity indices of two jets, the concurrent variabilities of EASJ and EAPJ are investigated with typical temperature and precipitation anomalies in China. The results suggest that by taking account of the two jets, we are able to get a more comprehensive understanding of the winter climate.

40|$|INTRODUCTION Jet streaks, {{defined as}} {{localized}} wind speed maxima along {{the axis of}} a jet stream, are ubiquitous in the extratropical upper troposphere. As {{a result of their}} association with rapid cyclogenesis, heavy precipitation, and severe convective storms, jet streaks have assumed a prominent role in mainstream synoptic meteorology (e. g., Palm'en and Newton 1969; Bluestein 1993). However, the majority of investigations have focussed on the "weather-producing" aspects of jet streaks, and correspondingly few studies have attempted to provide a dynamical interpretation of these features. There is significant observational evidence that many jet streaks are associated with the superposition of nonlinear tropopause-based coherent vortices with the enhanced potential vorticity (PV) gradients that constitute the extratropical tropopause and that coincide with the <b>polar-front</b> <b>jet</b> stream (e. g., Cunningham and Keyser 1996; Pyle 1997; Hakim 1999).

In experiments with frontal midlatitude SST gradient as observed in the Southwestern Indian Ocean, transient eddy activity in each of the winter and summer hemispheres is organized into a deep storm track along the SST front with enhanced low-level baroclinic growth of eddies. In the winter hemisphere, another storm track forms just below the intense STJ core, but it is confined to the upper troposphere with no significant baroclinic eddy growth underneath. The near-surface westerlies are strongest near the midlatitude SST front as observed, consistent with westerly momentum transport associated with baroclinic eddy growth. Sharp poleward decline in the surface sensible heat flux across the SST frontal zone sustains strong near-surface baroclinicity against the relaxing effect by vigorous poleward eddy heat transport. Elimination of the midlatitude frontal SST gradient yield...|$|E
40|$|Recently, it {{frequently}} occurs that extratropical cyclones over Japanese {{islands and}} its surrounding area develop unusually in Spring and Autumn. It causes natural disaster and gives the damage to human activity with heavy precipitation and strong winds. For the reason of climatology, it is because North-South movement of jet streams which affect the formation of extratropical cyclones get intense by the expansion of subtropical high and advection of cold air in these seasons. Therefore, {{the main purpose of}} this study is to clarify the causation of these cyclones on the basis of fluctuation of the general circulation of atmosphere. In this paper, unusually developing cyclones are defined as the central pressure deepened to less than 980 hPa, using synoptic weather chart provided by the Japan Meteorological Agency（JMA）. These cyclones are classified into three types, depending on the positions of the formation and cyclone tracks. In order to research the characteristics of the developing process respectively, upper troposphere pressure field, zonal wind field, and relative vorticity on the scale of East Asia were analyzed, using global reanalysis daily average dataset based on NCEP／NCAR. The results are summarized as follows, 1 ）According to the statistical analysis, unusually developing cyclones are more frequent recently. Especially, March is the highest in the probability where an extratropical cyclone develops unusually. 2 ）Nihon-Kai low type（N-type）has the smallest level of the deepening of a depression in three types. This type showed that a positive relative vorticity in upper troposphere（ 200 hPa）contributes to the development of cyclones. 3 ）On the other hand, low passing along the south coast of Japan type（S-type）are formed by baroclinically unstable wave of the subtropical jet stream. In this type, subtropical jet stream and <b>polar-front</b> <b>jet</b> stream converge by the ridge（around 105 °E）in the west of Japanese islands. Consequently, vortices related cyclogenesis in the lower troposphere propagated to upper troposphere with developing cyclones. 4 ）Additionally, double-cyclone type（NS-type）develops by the coupling of the Nihon-Kai low and the low passing along south coast of Japan over Japanese islands. It has the largest level of the development and the most appearance days. As for this type, subtropical jet stream flowing at the high latitude side（around 35 °N） intensified by subtropical high. Further, <b>polar-front</b> <b>jet</b> stream meanders to the vicinity of Japan（around 30 °N） influenced by the trough at 500 hPa geopotential height field, and converge with subtropical jet stream. As a result, the lower tropospheric vortices with the low passing along south coast of Japan couple it with the upper tropospheric vortices with the Nihon-Kai low, and such a structure had an impact on developing cyclones unusually...|$|E
40|$|The summertime mei-yu–baiu rainband over East Asia {{displays}} considerable interannual variability. A singular value decomposition (SVD) {{analysis for}} interannual variability reveals that precipitation anomalies over the mei-yu–baiu region {{are accompanied by}} in situ anomalies of midtropospheric horizontal temperature advection. Anomalous warm (cool) advection causes increased (decreased) mei-yu–baiu precipitation locally by inducing adiabatic ascent (descent). The anomalous precipitation acts to reinforce the vertical motion, forming a feedback system. By this mechanism, the remotely forced anomalous atmospheric circulation can induce changes in mei-yu–baiu precipitation. The quasi-stationary precipitation anomalies induced by this mechanism are partially offset by transient eddies. The SVD analysis also reveals the association of mei-yu–baiu precipitation anomalies with several teleconnection patterns, suggesting remote induction mechanisms. The Pacific–Japan (PJ) teleconnection pattern, which is associated with anomalous convection over the tropical western North Pacific, contributes to mei-yu–baiu precipitation variability throughout the boreal summer. The PJ pattern mediates influences of the El Niño–Southern Oscillation in preceding boreal winter on mei-yu–baiu precipitation. In early summer, the leading covariability pattern between precipitation and temperature advection also features the Silk Road pattern—a wave train along the summertime Asian jet—and another wave train pattern to the north along the <b>polar-front</b> <b>jet</b> that often leads {{to the development of}} the surface Okhotsk high. 1...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{the wintertime}} cyclone/anticyclone {{activity}} and its variability over China are examined {{based on the}} National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) reanalysis data from 1948 to 2007. The climatology of the source, path and lysis regions for cyclones/anticyclones is investigated using an automatic tracking algorithm. Apparent asymmetries in source, lysis and path regions are observed between cyclones and anticyclones. The 1948 – 2007 data exhibit an upward trend in the annual number and a downward trend in the cyclone and anticyclone intensity. The leading empirical orthogonal function (EOF) mode of the cyclone transit counts (CTC) for the 1948 – 2007 period indicates an increase in cyclone activity over northeastern East Asia since the late 1970 s that becomes significant in the mid- 1980 s. The first EOF mode of the anticyclone transit counts (ATC) is a monopole over northern East Asia, centred west of Lake Baikal, which has increased since 1970. The CTC variability dominates the ATC variability, which corresponds well with the storm track variability. Two distinct variability modes in the upper tropospheric jets over East Asia are also observed. The first mode describes an oscillation in the subtropical jet position; the second mode describes the <b>polar-front</b> <b>jet</b> strength variation. Moreover, the second mode is {{closely linked to the}} cyclone/anticyclone activity variability...|$|E
40|$|Turbulent fluids are {{frequently}} observed to spontaneously self-organize into large spatial-scale jets; geophysical {{examples of this}} phenomenon include the Jovian banded winds and the earth’s <b>polar-front</b> <b>jet.</b> These relatively steady large-scale jets arise from and are maintained by the smaller spatial- and temporalscale turbulence with which they coexist. Frequently these jets {{are found to be}} adjusted into marginally stable states that support large transient growth. In this work, a comprehensive theory for the interaction of jets with turbulence, stochastic structural stability theory (SSST), is applied to the two-layer baroclinic model with the object of elucidating the physical mechanism producing and maintaining baroclinic jets, understanding how jet amplitude, structure, and spacing is controlled, understanding the role of parameters such as the temperature gradient and static stability in determining jet structure, understanding the phenomenon of abrupt reorganization of jet structure as a function of parameter change, and understanding the general mechanism by which turbulent jets adjust to marginally stable states supporting large transient growth. When the mean thermal forcing is weak so that the mean jet is stable in the absence of turbulence, jets emerge as an instability of the coupled system consisting of the mean jet dynamics and the ensemble mean eddy dynamics. Destabilization of this SSST coupled system occurs as a critical turbulence level is exceeded. A...|$|E
40|$|The {{formation}} of the Southern Hemisphere spiral jet is investigated using observations over a 40 -yr period. It is found that between late March and early April, the upper-tropospheric westerly jet in the Southern Hemisphere undergoes a transition from an annular structure in midlatitudes to a spiral structure that extends from 20 ° to 55 °S. The transition to the spiral structure is initiated by the {{formation of}} a subtropical jet, localized in the central Pacific. The inception of the jet spiral is completed with the forma-tion of a band of northwest-to-southeast-oriented zonal winds, which is connected to both the subtropical and the polar-front jets. This band, referred to as the tilting branch, arises from momentum flux conver-gence associated with breaking Rossby waves. As such, the direction of the wave breaking determines the direction of the jet spiral; an anticyclonic wave breaking, associated with equatorward wave dispersion, establishes a jet spiral that turns cyclonically toward the pole. This formation mechanism of the jet spiral is supported by a set of calculations with an idealized numerical model. These model calculations indicate that the jet spiral is obtained only if the model’s localized subtropical jet is sufficiently strong, and if the latitude of the <b>polar-front</b> <b>jet</b> is sufficiently higher than that of the subtropical jet. The calculations also indicate that the spiral jet is a transient solution, implying that the lack of spiral structure during the austral winter may be caused by the zonal wind field reaching a new statistically steady state. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{structure}} of westerly jets in a statistically steady state is investigated with both dry and moist models on the sphere. The dry model is forced with an idealized radiative equilibrium temperature profile {{that consists of}} a global-scale base profile plus both localized tropical heating and high-latitude cooling. The tropical heating controls {{the intensity of the}} subtropical jet, while the high-latitude cooling modulates the meridional width of the extratropical baroclinic zone. The jet structure is analyzed with a large number of dry model runs in which the tropical heating and high-latitude cooling rates are systematically varied. This parameter study shows that, in a regime with weak tropical heating and strong high-latitude cooling, the <b>polar-front</b> <b>jet</b> separates itself from the subtropical jet, forming a double-jet state. In contrast, if the tropical heating rate is greater than a certain value, a strong single jet emerges, indicating that the presence of one or two jets in a statistically steady state is dependent upon the relative values of both the tropical heating and the baroclinic zone width. A set of moist model runs is examined in which the moisture content is systematically varied. For a relatively small moisture content, the circulation prefers a double-jet state. However, for a moisture content that is greater than a certain threshold value, the two jets collapse into a single jet. With the aid of the aforementioned dry model results, an explanation for this nonlinear response exhibited by the moist model is provided. Based on the results of the dry and moist model calculations, this paper discusses various physical interpretations of the circulation responses to global warming presented in the literature. 1...|$|E
40|$|Air-fall {{volcanic}} ash and pumice were recovered from 22 intervals in upper Miocene-Pleistocene nannofossil oozes cored in Hole 810 C on Shatsky Rise, northwest Pacific. Shatsky Rise {{is near the}} eastern limit of ash falls produced by explosive volcanism in arc systems in northern Japan and the Kuriles, more than 1600 km away. Electron probe analyses establish that the ash beds and pumice pebbles are andesitic to rhyolitic in composition, and belong to both tholeiitic and high-alumina lineages similar to tephra from Japanese volcanoes. High-speed winds in the polar-front and subtropical jets are evidently what propelled the ash for such a distance. The pumice arrived by flotation, driven from the same directions by winds, waves, and currents. It is not ice-rafted debris from the north. One thick pumice bed probably was deposited when a large pumice mat passed over Shatsky Rise. Far more abundant ash occurs in sediments cored at DSDP Sites 578 through 580, about 500 km west of Shatsky Rise. Most of the ash and pumice at Shatsky Rise can be correlated with specific ash beds at 1, 2, or all 3 of these sites by interpolating to precisely determined magnetic reversal sequences in the cores. Most of the correlations are to thick ash layers (5. 7 +/- 3. 0 cm) at one or more sites. These must represent extremely large eruptions that spread ash over very wide areas. Whereas several of the thicker correlative ashes fell from elongate east-trending plumes directed from central Japan, {{the majority of them}} - dating from about 2 Ma - came from the North Honshu and Kurile arc systems to the northwest.

40|$|The Loess Plateau in China {{is located}} in a typical summer rain region with a {{rainfall}} season. It is one of the wheat belts, and {{is located in}} semi-arid region with a large variation in precipitation. Thus, the authors analyze the year-to-year variation of precipitation and wind systems transferring the vapor into the Loess Plateau. Used data are monthly average precipitation, wind, geopotential height and vapor transport calculated by wind vector and specific humidity. The monthly average precipitation is analyzed for 14 years from 1979 to 1992 at 22 observation sites using the data provided by the National Center for Atmospheric Research. The wind vector, geopotential height and vapor transport are analyzed based on the re-analysis data of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR). The results are summarized as follows. There are some differences in rainfall system between July and August, which cause rainfall over the Loess Plateau. In high precipitation year, southeasterly wind originated from southwesterly monsoon can flow into the inland due to the poleward shift of subtropical jet stream in July. It transports a large amount of water vapor into disturbance with <b>polar-front</b> <b>jet</b> trough staying in the northeastward of the Loess Plateau. Under this convective instability, it is expected that convective clouds produce precipitation around the Loess Plateau. In August, water vapor is transported into the Loess Plateau by the convergence of low-level jet from the North Pacific subtropical high and southwesterly monsoon. On the other hand, subtropical jet stream shifts southward, flowing over the Loess Plateau and its ridge-line appears over Japan at upper troposphere in low precipitation year. Westward extending North Pacific subtropical high along the ridge-line tends to weaken the southeasterly arm of southwesterly monsoon into the Loess Plateau, while the Taiwan convergence zone is intensifies and southwesterly monsoon towards the Korean Peninsula is forced. Therefore, water vapor is transported into the Loess Plateau mainly from the East China Sea. This {{is expected to be the}} mechanistic process of low precipitation in the Loess Plateau...|$|E

An associated nearly-isothermal layer underneath is much decper (up to 4 and even 6 km) than in other parts of the globe.
