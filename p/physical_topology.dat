40|$|Published in "Towards an Optical Internet", A. Jukan (Ed.). Optical packet {{switching}} over arbitrary <b>physical</b> <b>topologies</b> typically mandates complex routing schemes {{and the use}} of buffers to resolve the likely contentions. However, the relatively immature nature of optical logic devices and the limitations with optical buffering provide significant incentive to reduce the routing complexity and avoid optical domain contentions. This paper examines how the Manhattan Street Network (MSN) and a particular routing scheme may be used to facilitate optical {{packet switching}} over arbitrary <b>physical</b> <b>topologies.</b> A novel approach, genetic algorithms (GA), is applied to the problem of deploying the MSN (near) optimally in arbitrary <b>physical</b> <b>topologies.</b> A problem encoding is proposed and different implementations of GA described. The optimum GA parameters are empirically selected and GA is successfully used to deploy the MSN in <b>physical</b> <b>topologies</b> of up to 100 nodes. Favourable results are obtained.

40|$|Abstract – Optical packet {{switching}} over arbitrary <b>physical</b> <b>topologies</b> generally requires complex routing schemes coupled with contention resolving buffering. However, the relatively immature nature of optical logic devices and the limitations associated with optical buffering provide significant incentive {{to reduce the}} routing complexity and avoid optical domain contentions. This paper examines how the Manhattan Street Network (MSN) {{may be used to}} facilitate optical {{packet switching}} over arbitrary <b>physical</b> <b>topologies.</b> Several pertinent novel costs are introduced. Simulated annealing is used to deploy the MSN (near) optimally as a virtual <b>topology</b> in the <b>physical</b> <b>topologies.</b> Favourable and encouraging results are obtained, indicating that deploying the MSN is an attractive means to switch packets optically over arbitrary topologies.

The proposed on-chip interconnection network provides identical <b>physical</b> <b>topologies</b> to logical topologies for given applications. The network has been implemented with parameterized switches, dynamically multiplexed by a traffic controller. Considering practical media applications, a multiprocessor system combined with the presented network has been integrated and prototyped in Virtex-II Pro FPGA using the ESPAM design environment. The experiment shows that the network realizes on-demand traffic patterns, occupies on average 59 % less area, and maintains performance comparable with a conventional crossbar. ...|$|R
