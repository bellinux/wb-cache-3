25|$|While {{the number}} of nurses {{providing}} patient care is recognized as an inadequate measure of nursing care quality, there is hard evidence that nurse staffing {{is directly related to}} patient outcomes. Studies by Aiken and Needleman have demonstrated that patient death, nosocomial infections, cardiac arrest, and pressure ulcers are linked to inadequate nurse-to-patient ratios. The presence or absence of registered nurses (RNs) impacts the outcome for pediatric patients requiring pain management and/or peripheral administration of intravenous fluids and/or medications. These two indicators of <b>pediatric</b> <b>nursing</b> care quality are sensitive measures of nursing care. Professional nurses {{play a key role in}} successful pain management, especially among pediatric patients unable to verbally describe pain. Astute assessment skills are required to intervene successfully and relieve discomfort.33 Maintenance of a patient’s intravenous access is a clear nursing responsibility. Pediatric patients are at increased risk for intravenous infiltration and for significant complications of infiltration, should it occur.|$|E

40|$|Nursing staff {{spend more}} time with {{patients}} with pain than any other health staff member. For this reason, the nurse must possess the basic knowledge to identify the presence of pain in patients, to measure its intensity and make the steps necessary for treatment. Therefore, a prospective, descriptive, analytical, and cross-sectional study was conducted to investigate the knowledge and attitudes regarding pediatric pain in two different populations. The questionnaire, <b>Pediatric</b> <b>Nurses</b> Knowledge and Attitudes Survey Regarding Pain (PKNAS), was applied to 111 hospital <b>pediatric</b> <b>nurses</b> and 300 university nursing students. The final scores for <b>pediatric</b> <b>nurses</b> and nursing students were 40. 1 ± 7. 9 and 40. 3 ± 7. 5, respectively. None of the sociodemographic variables predicted the scores obtained by the participants (P> 0. 05). There was a high correlation between the PKNAS scores of <b>pediatric</b> <b>nurses</b> and nursing students (r= 0. 86, P< 0. 001). It was observed that the degree of knowledge about pain and its treatment was very low in both groups. Due to this deficiency, pain in children remains inadequately managed, which leads to suffering in this population. It is necessary to increase the continued training in this subject in both areas...|$|R
40|$|Background: Pakistan is a {{developing}} country that is struggling with rising child mortality and morbidity rates since many decades. The rising childhood morbidity and mortality rates indicate that this country needs trained <b>Pediatric</b> <b>nurses</b> to promote child health. From an educationist perspective, a pressing need was viewed to appraise whether the existing <b>Pediatric</b> Health <b>Nursing</b> curriculum is coherent with the health needs of Pakistani pediatric population. This paper will explore the way forward to strengthen knowledge, skills and attitudes of future <b>Pediatric</b> <b>nurses</b> in Pakistan. Methods: The existing <b>Pediatric</b> Health <b>Nursing</b> curriculum of the Higher Education Commission (HEC) /Pakistan Nursing Council (PNC) was reviewed and analyzed for its alignment, sequence, credits, course objectives, course content, and assessment. Results: Review of the <b>Pediatric</b> Health <b>Nursing</b> curriculum revealed that all of its components are in alignment with the HEC/PNC objectives, and it gives coverage to the four main themes including “integration of knowledge derived from humanities and science”, “effective communication”, “health promotion” and “nursing process”. It was also analyzed that the course can be further improved by involving students in lab based simulation exercises, adding practice sessions for communication, utilizing community sites for students’ clinical practice, and offering sessions on Pediatric medications and drug dosage calculation. Conclusions: Knowledge, attitudes and practices of future <b>pediatric</b> <b>nurses</b> can be enhanced with a <b>Pediatric</b> Health <b>Nursing</b> curriculum that is well aligned, uses an integrated approach, and is in accordance to the health needs of a nation.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} whether an interdisciplinary, multifaceted oral health education program delivered to <b>pediatric</b> <b>nurse</b> practitioner students at the University of California, San Francisco, would improve their knowledge, confidence, attitudes, and behaviors regarding the provision of oral health assessments, consultations, referrals, and services to young children during well-child visits. Thirty <b>pediatric</b> <b>nurse</b> practitioner students were included in the study. Participants completed a written survey before and after receiving an interdisciplinary educational intervention that included didactic education, simulation exercises, and clinical observation by a pediatric dental resident. Between pre-intervention and post-intervention, a significant improvement was seen in the <b>pediatric</b> <b>nurse</b> practitioners' knowledge of oral health topics (p < 0. 001), confidence when providing oral health counseling (p < 0. 001), and attitudes about including oral health counseling in their examinations (p= 0. 006). In the post-intervention survey, 83 percent of the subjects reported having incorporated oral examinations into their well-child visits. Our study suggests that providing an interdisciplinary oral health educational program for <b>pediatric</b> <b>nurse</b> practitioner students can improve their knowledge, confidence, attitudes, and behaviors regarding the incorporation of oral health care services during routine well-child visits...|$|R
