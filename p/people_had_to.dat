5|$|In New Jersey, {{the storm}} {{produced}} heavy rainfall, peaking at 8.1inches (205mm) in Tuckerton. The rains also caused river flooding, including the north {{branch of the}} Metedeconk River in Lakewood which crested at 8feet (2.5m). The flooding, severe at places, closed several roads, including numerous state highways. Gusty winds of up to 44mph (71km/h) in Atlantic City downed weak trees and power lines, leaving over 13,000 without power. Several <b>people</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be rescued from high waters, though no fatalities occurred in the state. Overall damage was minimal.|$|E
5|$|Sarmiento {{believed}} that the material and social needs of <b>people</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be satisfied {{but not at the}} cost of order and decorum. He put great importance on law and citizen participation. These ideas he most equated to Rome and to the United States, a society which he viewed as exhibiting similar qualities. In order to civilize the Argentine society and make it equal to that of Rome or the United States, Sarmiento believed in eliminating the caudillos, or the larger landholdings and establishing multiple agricultural colonies run by European immigrants.|$|E

5|$|The {{flag was}} {{a tool of}} Japanese imperialism in the {{occupied}} Southeast Asian areas during Second World War: <b>people</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> use the flag, and schoolchildren sang Kimigayo in morning flag raising ceremonies. Local flags were allowed for some {{areas such as the}} Philippines, Indonesia, and Manchukuo. In Korea which was part of the Empire of Japan, the Hinomaru and other symbols were used to declare that the Koreans were subjects of the empire.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the center}} of Gustav passed just {{to the east of}} Cape Hatteras, areas of North Carolina and southeastern Virginia {{experienced}} heavy rain and tropical storm force winds. Parts of the Outer Banks received 2–5inches (50–125mm) of rain and winds of up to 50mph (80km/h), and the Coast Guard station at Cape Hatteras reported a wind gust of 78mph (125km/h). The storm produced storm surges of 3– along the Outer Banks, and 1– along the southeastern coast of Virginia. These surges, combined with strong winds and high sea swells, resulted in minor flooding, mainly in Ocracoke and Hatteras Village, North Carolina. A weak waterspout also touched down on Silver Lake near Ocracoke and moved onshore, but only minor roof damage was reported. Sporadic power outages were also reported. One person died after suffering injuries in the high surf, and 40 other <b>people</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be rescued from riptides and storm surges. Damage in the region amounted to $100,000 (2002USD).|$|E
5|$|During this time, the Molonglo River {{flowed through}} the flood basin, {{with only a}} small {{fraction}} of the water envisaged in Griffin's plan. The centre of his capital city consisted of mostly farmland, with small settlements—mostly wooden, temporary and ad hoc—on either side. There was little evidence that Canberra was planned, and the lake and Parliamentary Triangle at the heart of Griffin's plan was but a paddock. Royal Canberra Golf Course, and Acton Racecourse and a sports ground were located on the pastoral land that was to become the West Lake, and <b>people</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> disperse the livestock before playing sport. A rubbish dump stood on the northern banks of the location of central basin, and no earth had been moved since Griffin's departure three decades earlier.|$|E

5|$|In 1846, a {{dysentery}} epidemic swept communities {{along the}} Assiniboine River in Manitoba. On June 22 of that year, Belcourt left his mission at Baie-Saint-Paul {{to join a}} group of hunters on their journey south for the summer. The hunters carried the disease, infecting others, and 25 people died of dysentery by July 5. On the worst days, eight <b>people</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be buried. Belcourt and six of the hunters travelled south to the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation in search of medicine, as the priest's supply had quickly run out.

5|$|Rainfall up to 5in (127mm) in Massachusetts {{caused a}} river in Somerset to {{overflow}} its banks, flooding nearby areas with 2feet (0.6m) of water. A large sinkhole formed on County Street and several cars were {{stranded in the}} floodwaters. Two <b>people</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be rescued by boat when their car was overcome by the floodwaters. In addition, numerous basements were flooded. Damages in Bristol County were estimated at $25,000. A mobile home park in Plymouth County was inundated with 2.5ft (0.7m) of water, causing one home to shift off its foundation. Damages to the homes were estimated at $50,000.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} tunnel {{as built}} {{was designed by}} Sir Alexander Binnie and built by S. Pearson & Sons, between 1892 and 1897, for whom Ernest William Moir was the lead engineer. It was constructed using tunnelling shield and compressed air techniques and a Greathead shield (named after its inventor, James Henry Greathead). It was lit by three rows of incandescent street lights. To clear the site in Greenwich, more than 600 <b>people</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be rehoused, and a house reputedly once owned by Sir Walter Raleigh had to be demolished. The work force was largely drawn from immigrants; the tunnel lining was manufactured in Glasgow, while the manual labour came from provincial England, particularly Yorkshire.|$|E

5|$|While Adams {{tried to}} reassert {{control of the}} meeting, people poured out of the Old South Meeting House and headed to Boston Harbor. That evening, a group of 30 to 130 men boarded the three vessels, some of them thinly {{disguised}} as Mohawk Indians, and dumped all 342 chests of tea into the water {{over the course of}} three hours. Adams never revealed whether he went to the wharf to witness the destruction of the tea. Whether or not he helped plan the event is unknown, but Adams immediately worked to publicize and defend it. He argued that the Tea Party was not the act of a lawless mob, but was instead a principled protest and the only remaining option that the <b>people</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> defend their constitutional rights.|$|E
5|$|A {{resident}} of Malakula was struck {{and killed by}} a falling coconut while seeking shelter from the worsening conditions. Agriculture on nearby Ahamb Island, already impaired by Paula, was further compromised; all crops, both those remaining after Paula and those planted in the intervening time, were destroyed. Four classrooms on the small island were also damaged beyond use. Buildings on Aoba incurred appreciable damage, while on Efate, the storm brought down utility poles, severely damaged local schools, and left roads covered with debris and floodwaters. Flooding in the nation's capital city of Port Vila forced 50 residents {{to leave their homes}} in search of higher ground. Espiritu Santo, particularly the island's south shore around Luganville, bore the brunt of Cyclone Sose. Several types of crops (also weakened by Paula) took a heavy beating, and 60 <b>people</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> evacuate due to encroaching floods. In total, the storm demolished 59 houses on the island and in some way damaged another 101. A young child drowned after being swept away while attempting to cross a swollen waterway. Just offshore, the M/V Omale succumbed to the heavy seas; all 16 of its occupants successfully swam four hours to shore.|$|E
5|$|During {{the opening}} days of 1994, Rewa moved southwards {{parallel}} to the Queensland coast; however, because it was located about 600km (370mi) to the north-east of Mackay, it {{was too far away}} from the coast for there to be any direct impact on Queensland. The only indirect impact was higher surf, from which several <b>people</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be rescued from before the cyclone started to move towards New Caledonia during 4January. As Rewa affected Queensland for the second time, watches and warnings were issued for various parts of Queensland by TCWC Brisbane, who predicted a landfall near Mackay. On 18 January local disaster committees met to consider evacuating people, while people who were on vacation in national parks were alerted about Rewa by a helicopter. A military training exercise that was due to take place in Shoalwater Bay had to be cancelled, with army personal evacuated to Rockhampton to avoid being cut off by flood waters. Along the coast, several ports including Gladstone were shut with large vessels told to head to sea and small vessels told to batten down and prepare for the storm.|$|E

5|$|In Texas, most of {{the damage}} was due to inland flooding. Heavy {{rainfall}} of 6 to 18inches (150 to 450mm) was reported across a large swath of Texas. The heaviest measured amount was 17.4inches (426mm) near Monroe City, Texas. Rainfall amounts of two to six inches were common throughout {{the eastern part of}} the state. In total, 38 houses were flooded in southeast Texas. The freshwater flooding resulted in the evacuation of 20 families in Chambers County. 250 <b>people</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> evacuate from their homes near Abilene, Texas due to floodwater. The storm surge impacts were fairly minor, ranging from 3 to 5feet (1.2 to 1.8 m) above mean sea level. A portion of State Highway 87 was flooded from the storm surge, although no significant property damage was reported as a result of it. Minor beach erosion and street flooding was also reported on Galveston Island. The highest wind gust on land was 51mph (82km/h) at Scholes Field. There were two tornadoes confirmed as a result of Dean. One touched down on High Island in Galveston County, and the other touched down near Anahuac. Both tornadoes were rated as F0 on the Fujita scale, with minor damage.|$|E
5|$|In other states, {{damage was}} lighter, but still significant. In Sonora, total damages rose to $64.4 million (2000 MXN, $6.8 million 2000 USD); in Chiapas, $25.6 million (2000 MXN, $2.7 million 2000 USD) of {{property}} damage {{were caused by}} the storm. This brings up the total damage in Mexico to $365.9 million (2000 MXN, $38.7 million 2000 USD). In Tabasco, flooding damaged 7,896 houses. Approximately 24,000 residents in the state were impacted by flooding. At {{the capital city of}} Villahermosa, large rivers in the area overflowed, flooding some streets. However, dikes and sandbags {{along the banks of the}} rivers prevented further flooding. Overall, about 46,000 <b>people</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> evacuate Mexico due to the storm and its flooding. There was one fatality when a man in Tampico was electrocuted by a downed power line. In Xicoténcatl, Tamaulipas, a swollen river killed a family of six when their house was flooded. Overall, Keith killed 23 people in Mexico ndash& 13 in Veracruz, 4 in Puebla, and 6 in Tamaulipas. There were six indirect deaths when a plane crashed while attempting to land in Reynosa, Tamaulipas.|$|E
5|$|Portions of Central America also {{experienced}} flooding {{related to the}} rains, causing landslides and washing away bridges and roads. Over 100,000people in the region had to leave their homes, and there were 70deaths in Central America. In Guatemala, 12people died related to the flooding, including two due to cholera from stagnant waters. Officials declared a red alert in Honduras, which mobilized the army for potential relief work and caused Red Cross shelters to open; the alert was dropped after rainfall eased on October8. About 6,500people evacuated in Honduras after four rivers flooded, which damaged or destroyed several houses. About 6,000 <b>people</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> evacuate in Sula Valley in the northern portion of the country, after the government released water from the El Cajón Dam. Damage was estimated at $1.5million (14million pesos), and there were 34deaths. Due to people having to evacuate, several schools were closed. The country was severely affected by Hurricane Mitch only a year prior, and bridges that were rebuilt after the hurricane were again destroyed.|$|E

5|$|The public {{loved the}} film, with lines {{stretching}} outside of theaters as <b>people</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> {{wait for the}} next showing. This, along with box office numbers, led to a reconsideration of the film by critics, and it eventually received a very large amount of praise. It broke box-office records in Japan and the rest of Asia, France, Britain, South America, the United States, and Canada, and was a moderate success in Australia for a brief period. It was the most profitable black-and-white sound film ever made, and Hitchcock personally realized well in excess of $15 million. He then swapped his rights to Psycho and his TV anthology for 150,000 shares of MCA, making him the third largest shareholder in MCA Inc., and his own boss at Universal, in theory; however, this did not stop them from interfering with his later films. Psycho was, by a large margin, the most profitable film of Hitchcock's career, earning over $12 million for the studio on release, and $15 million {{by the end of the}} year. Hitchcock's second most profitable was Family Plot ($7,541,000), and third place was a tie between Torn Curtain (1966) and Frenzy (1972), each earning $6,500,000. Around the time of the run's end, the film had grossed $32 million in domestic theaters.|$|E
