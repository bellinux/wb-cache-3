50|$|John Baptist Meÿenberg (1847-1914) was an {{operator}} at the Anglo-Swiss milk condensery at Cham, Switzerland. Anglo-Swiss made sweetened condensed milk. From 1866 through 1883, Meÿenberg experimented with preservation of milk {{without the use}} of sugar. He discovered that condensed milk would last longer if heated to 120°C (248°F) in a sealed container, and hence could be preserved without adding sugar. When Anglo-Swiss declined to implement Meÿenberg's work, he resigned from the company and emigrated to the United States. John Meÿenberg first moved to St. Louis, but soon transferred to Highland, Illinois, due to its large Swiss population. On 25 November 1884, U.S. Patents 308,421 (Apparatus for <b>Preserving</b> <b>Milk)</b> and 308,422 (Process for <b>Preserving</b> <b>Milk)</b> were issued to Meÿenberg. Meÿenberg associated with various local merchants, including John Wildi, Louis Latzer, Dr. Knoebel, George Roth and Fred Kaeser and, on February 14, 1885, organized the Helvetia Milk Condensing Company.|$|R

40|$|Milk {{spoilage}} {{remains a}} problems {{in many countries}} especially those in tropics with absence of preservation practices such as pasteurization. this has tempted milk dealers to use antimicrobial substances to combat the problem of spoilage with consequence health hazards. Khartoum State may not an exception as field observations suggested the use of antibiotics to <b>preserve</b> <b>milk</b> under the high ambient temperature of the day. Therefore the current study {{has been carried out}} in Khartoum State to investigate this possibility through culturing a strain of Bacillus subtilles (strain ATTC 6633) of no previously reported exposure to antibiotics in Nutrient Agar media. Wells were punched in the Nutrient Agar. Then, these wells filled with individual milk samples. Two hundred and sixty milk samples were collected randomly from three provinces of Khartoum State. These samples were collected from two different sources, the first source was conducted from 41 farms, the second source was collected from market milk and were collected both from the morning and the evening milking. The result indicated that antimicrobial substances, possibly antibiotics, are widely used to <b>preserve</b> <b>milk</b> sold in Khartoum State. Percentages of 27. 1 %, 21. 2 % and 25 % of the total milk samples collected from Khartoum, Khartoum North and Omdurman were respectively positive for antimicrobial residues. Further, higher percentage of samples collected from Khartoum markets was positive (30. 9 %) compared with those collected directly from producer farms (24. 3 %). Also higher percentage of samples collected in the morning (38. 9 %) compared with those collected in the evening (16. 8 %) suggesting an attempt to protect milk from the higher possibility of spoilage due to the high day temperature. The study has therefore recommended measures to combat the practice of adding antimicrobial substances to milk though random sampling and legislating regulations and rules, including penalties, to control the practice. Also milk producers should be encouraged to form cooperatives that should be provided with pasteurization, bottling and distribution facilities. In addition, door to door dispersion of milk should only be restricted to pasteurized and bottled milk...|$|R

60|$|The spoor {{of these}} people was easy to follow. First we found {{the body of a}} boy of about ten. Then {{vultures}} revealed to us the remains of two young men, one of whom had been shot and the other killed by a blow from an axe. Their corpses were roughly hidden beneath some grass, I know not why. A mile or two further on we heard a child wailing and found it by following its cries. It was a little girl of about four who had been pretty, though now she was but a living skeleton. When she saw us she scrambled away on all fours like a monkey. Stephen followed her, while I, sick at heart, went to get a tin of <b>preserved</b> <b>milk</b> from our stores. Presently I heard him call to me in a horrified voice. Rather reluctantly, for I knew that he must have found something dreadful, I pushed my way through the bush to where he was.

60|$|For he was {{difficult}} to dispose of, that boy. He was delicate and, in a frail way, good-looking too, except for the vacant droop of his lower lip. Under our excellent system of compulsory education {{he had learned to}} read and write, notwithstanding the unfavourable aspect of the lower lip. But as errand-boy he did not turn out a great success. He forgot his messages; he was easily diverted from the straight path of duty by the attractions of stray cats and dogs, which he followed down narrow alleys into unsavoury courts; by the comedies of the streets, which he contemplated open-mouthed, to the detriment of his employer’s interests; or by the dramas of fallen horses, whose pathos and violence induced him sometimes to shriek pierceingly in a crowd, which disliked to be disturbed by sounds of distress in its quiet enjoyment of the national spectacle. When led away by a grave and protecting policeman, it would often become apparent that poor Stevie had forgotten his address—at least for a time. A brusque question caused him to stutter to the point of suffocation. When startled by anything perplexing he used to squint horribly. However, he never had any fits (which was encouraging); and before the natural outbursts of impatience on the part of his father he could always, in his childhood’s days, run for protection behind the short skirts of his sister Winnie. On the other hand, he might have been suspected of hiding a fund of reckless naughtiness. When he had reached the age of fourteen a friend of his late father, an agent for a foreign <b>preserved</b> <b>milk</b> firm, having given him an opening as office-boy, he was discovered one foggy afternoon, in his chief’s absence, busy letting off fireworks on the staircase. He touched off in quick succession a set of fierce rockets, angry catherine wheels, loudly exploding squibs—and the matter might have turned out very serious. An awful panic spread through the whole building. Wild-eyed, choking clerks stampeded through the passages full of smoke, silk hats and elderly business men could be seen rolling independently down the stairs. Stevie did not seem to derive any personal gratification from what he had done. His motives for this stroke of originality were difficult to discover. It was only later on that Winnie obtained from him a misty and confused confession. It seems that two other office-boys in the building had worked upon his feelings by tales of injustice and oppression till they had wrought his compassion to the pitch of that frenzy. But his father’s friend, of course, dismissed him summarily as likely to ruin his business. After that altruistic exploit Stevie was put to help wash the dishes in the basement kitchen, and to black the boots of the gentlemen patronising the Belgravian mansion. There was obviously no future in such work. The gentlemen tipped him a shilling now and then. Mr Verloc showed himself the most generous of lodgers. But altogether all that did not amount to much either in the way of gain or prospects; so that when Winnie announced her engagement to Mr Verloc her mother could not help wondering, with a sigh and a glance towards the scullery, what would become of poor Stephen now.|$|E

Once dichromate had been added to the milk no difference in cell counts attributable to temperature of storage were detected and there was very little change with time up to 14 days. On the average the addition of the dichromate elevated the cell counts/mL. As well a method of rapid fixation of milk involving the addition of glutaraldehyde prior to counting was evaluated.

40|$|The {{suitability}} of milk preserved by refrigeration and CO 2 addition for {{the manufacture of}} rennet-coagulated Spanish hard cheeses was evaluated. Two types of cheeses were produced from milk preserved by refrigeration and CO 2 addition (pH 6. 2) and were compared with controls made from fresh milk. Degasified (50 - 52 °C and 300 mm Hg) and pasteurised milk was employed for the manufacture of 30 -day-old cheeses using a commercial starter. A degasified (30 - 32 °C and 350 - 375 mm Hg) mixture of 90 % cow's and 10 % ewe's raw milk {{was used for the}} manufacture of starter-free 75 day-old cheeses. Milk preservation did not affect multiplication and acidification capacity of lactic acid bacteria in cheeses from pasteurised milk but promoted lower levels of lactococci at first days of ripening in cheeses from raw milk and rendered lower amounts of lactic, pyruvic and succinic acids. Preservation did not affect the evolution of volatile compounds. Cheeses from <b>preserved</b> <b>milk</b> showed reduced clotting time, slightly higher cheese yields and increased curd hardness and whey losses during cheesemaking. The taste panel accepted cheeses from <b>preserved</b> <b>milk.</b> These results support the interest of CO 2 -addition in preservation of milk for the manufacture of Spanish hard cheeses. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.
