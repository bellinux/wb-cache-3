50|$|Some <b>printed</b> <b>wiring</b> assemblies, {{particularly}} those using single-layer circuit boards, include short lengths of wire soldered between pairs of points. These wires are called jumpers, but unlike jumpers used for configuration settings, {{they are intended}} to permanently connect the points in question.

When they do wear out, it is generally due to ink invading the guide plate of the print head, causing grit to adhere to it; this grit slowly causes the channels in the guide plate to wear from circles into ovals or slots, providing less and less accurate guidance to the <b>printing</b> <b>wires.</b> Eventually, even with tungsten blocks and titanium pawls, the printing becomes too unclear to read, a common problem when users failed to maintain the printer with regular cleaning as outlined in most user manuals.|$|R

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following: (1) (I), which are dispersible in liquid media; (2) Sedimentation-stable, electroconductive dispersions of (I) in a liquid medium. USE - The particles {{are used as}} fillers {{for the production of}} sedimentation-stable, electroconductive dispersions, preferably thixotropic dispersions (all claimed). These dispersions are useful as lacquers or adhesives for shielding active or passive devices; electroconductive and heat-conducting bonds in electrical and electronic applications; heat management of groups with active devices; and ink-jet <b>printing</b> of <b>wiring</b> traces in microsystems. ADVANTAGE - The particles are completely dispersible in liquid media. The dispersions are sedimentation-stable and can also be thixotropic.
