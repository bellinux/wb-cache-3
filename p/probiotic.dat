5|$|Nonpathogenic E. coli strain Nissle 1917, {{also known}} as Mutaflor, and E. coli O83:K24:H31 (known as Colinfant) are used as <b>probiotic</b> agents in medicine, mainly for the {{treatment}} of various gastroenterological diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease.|$|E
5|$|In soil, {{microorganisms}} that {{reside in}} the rhizosphere (a zone that includes the root surface and the soil that adheres to the root after gentle shaking) carry out nitrogen fixation, converting nitrogen gas to nitrogenous compounds. This serves to provide an easily absorbable form of nitrogen for many plants, which cannot fix nitrogen themselves. Many other bacteria are found as symbionts in humans and other organisms. For example, the presence of over 1,000 bacterial species in the normal human gut flora of the intestines can contribute to gut immunity, synthesise vitamins, such as folic acid, vitamin K and biotin, convert sugars to lactic acid (see Lactobacillus), as well as fermenting complex undigestible carbohydrates. The presence of this gut flora also inhibits the growth of potentially pathogenic bacteria (usually through competitive exclusion) and these beneficial bacteria are consequently sold as <b>probiotic</b> dietary supplements.|$|E
25|$|Thus, the L. bulgaricus meets all the {{criteria}} of the FDA <b>probiotic</b> guideline, with scientific evidence supporting the strain as the clearest example of a safe and effective <b>probiotic</b> food supplement.|$|E
40|$|<b>Probiotics</b> {{discussed}} in this paper are evaluated using the WHO/FAO definition from 2001. The authors present {{a brief description of}} the normal microbiota of the gastrointestinal tract, discuss <b>probiotics</b> in the aspects of gut immunity and then move to selection of bacterial strains as <b>probiotics.</b> The main issue raised is the critical evaluation of <b>probiotics</b> in randomized clinical trials for conditions such as: infectious diarrhoea; antibiotic associated diarrhoea; inflammatory bowel disease; pouchitis and diverticulitis; H. pylori infection; irritable bowel syndrome. Safety of <b>probiotics</b> is mentioned with respect to susceptible individuals and bacterial translocation. As a conclusion the authors again recall the strain specific actions of <b>probiotics</b> in different clinical situations and that so far <b>probiotics</b> play a role in rotaviral and post antibiotic diarrhoea and pouchitis. An important issue still to be solved in order to confidently recommend <b>probiotics</b> as efficacious therapy is the regulatory aspect of <b>probiotics...</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the impact of use of <b>probiotics</b> in shrimp farming. The study was carried out during 2011 in three mandals (talukas) viz., Pitlavani Palem, Nizampatnam and Karlapalem of Guntur District in Andhra Pradesh.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{reported}} {{that there is a}} group of microbiota, which have been shown to bring beneficial effects on human’s health. They are called <b>probiotics.</b> <b>Probiotics</b> have been defined as live, non pathogenic microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefi t on the host. The administration of <b>probiotics</b> can change the composition of the gut microbiota. Several <b>probiotics</b> preparations seem to have a role in the prevention of certain diseases as well as treatment of various conditions. <b>Probiotics</b> {{have been shown to be}} helpful in relieving constipation, promoting recovery from diarrhea, reducing the risks of colorectal cancer, normalizing nutritional status, and improving the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, and lactose intolerance. However, the benefits associated with probiotics are strain specific. Therefore, the use of <b>probiotics</b> to confer health benefits should indicate the dosage regimens of each <b>probiotics</b> strain, based on adequate clinical trials. Although <b>probiotics</b> are generally regarded as safe, careful monitoring should be performed on the use of <b>probiotics</b> in the elderly patients.

25|$|In the United States, {{where food}} product {{labeling}} requires language {{approval by the}} FDA, <b>probiotic</b> manufacturers have received warning letters of impending legal actions for using exaggerated claims of health benefits not supported by clinical evidence of efficacy. The Federal Trade Commission has taken punitive actions, including a US$21 million fine coordinated across 39 state governments against a major <b>probiotic</b> manufacturer, for deceptive advertising and exaggerated claims of health benefits for a yogurt and <b>probiotic</b> dairy drink.|$|E
25|$|The {{potential}} {{efficacy of}} <b>probiotic</b> AAD prevention {{is dependent on}} the <b>probiotic</b> strain(s) used and on the dosage. The Cochrane review (2015) recommends for children Lactobacillus rhamnosus or Saccharomyces boulardii at 5 to 40 billion colony forming units/day, given the modest number need to treat and the likelihood that adverse events are very rare. The same review states that <b>probiotic</b> use should be avoided in pediatric populations at risk for adverse events, for example severely debilitated or immuno-compromised children.|$|E
25|$|Although probiotics are {{considered}} safe, they may cause bacteria-host interactions and adverse health consequences.

40|$|Heart failure {{patients}} face {{a five-year}} 50 % mortality rate, due to impaired cardiac function and hypertrophy of the heart. <b>Probiotics</b> are live microorganisms which when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host. Considering the established cardiovascular benefits of some <b>probiotics,</b> including reduction of cholesterol and hypertension, {{it was hypothesized}} that <b>probiotics</b> can improve outcomes of heart failure. <b>Probiotics</b> or controls were administered orally to an animal model for heart failure. Those receiving <b>probiotics</b> showed a significant improvement in cardiac hypertrophy and an attenuation of heart failure compared to control. No changes in gut microbial composition occurred. An in vitro model for cardiomyocyte hypertrophy examined the mechanistic action of <b>probiotics</b> in preventing cardiac hypertrophy. Studies showed that <b>probiotics</b> confer a direct anti-hypertrophic benefit to cardiomyocytes. These results support the hypothesis that <b>probiotics</b> can improve outcomes of heart failure and present a novel treatment strategy for heart failure...|$|R

25|$|Probiotics are {{superior}} to antibiotics {{in the treatment of}} SIBO. A combination of <b>probiotic</b> strains has been found to produce better results than therapy with the antibiotic drug metronidazole and probiotics {{have been found to be}} effective in treating and preventing secondary lactase deficiency and small intestinal bacteria overgrowth in individuals suffering from post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome. Probiotics taken in uncomplicated cases of SIBO can usually result in the individual becoming symptom free. <b>Probiotic</b> therapy may need to be taken continuously to prevent the return of overgrowth of gas producing bacteria. A study by the <b>probiotic</b> yogurt producer Nestlé found that <b>probiotic</b> yogurt may also be effective in treating SIBO with evidence of reduced inflammation after 4 weeks of treatment.|$|E
25|$|Preliminary {{research}} is evaluating the potential physiological effects of multiple <b>probiotic</b> strains, {{as opposed to}} a single strain. As the human gut may contain several hundred microbial species, one theory indicates that this diverse environment may benefit from consuming multiple <b>probiotic</b> strains, an effect that remains scientifically unconfirmed.|$|E
25|$|Currently, the <b>probiotic</b> strain, frequency, dose and {{duration}} of the <b>probiotic</b> therapy are not established. Live bacteria might not be essential because of beneficial effects of probiotics seems to be mediated by their DNA and by secreted soluble factors, and their therapeutic effects may be obtained by systemic administration rather than oral administration.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: <b>Probiotics</b> {{are live}} {{microorganisms}} that promote health benefits upon consumption, while prebiotics are nondigestible food ingredients that selectively stimulate {{the growth of}} beneficial microorganisms in the gastrointestinal tract. <b>Probiotics</b> and/or prebiotics {{could be used as}} alternative supplements to exert health benefits, including cholesterol-lowering effects on humans. Past in vivo studies showed that the administration of <b>probiotics</b> and/or prebiotics are effective in improving lipid profiles, including the reduction of serum/plasma total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides or increment of HDL-cholesterol. However, other past studies have also shown that <b>probiotics</b> and prebiotics had insignificant effects on lipid profiles, disputing the hypocholesterolemic claim. Additionally, little information is available on the effective dosage of <b>probiotics</b> and prebiotics needed to exert hypocholesterolemic effects. <b>Probiotics</b> and prebiotics have been suggested to reduce cholesterol via various mechanisms. However, more clinical evidence is needed to strengthen these proposals. Safety issues regarding <b>probiotics</b> and/or prebiotics have also been raised despite their long history of safe use.

40|$|<b>Probiotics</b> {{are live}} {{bacteria}} that confer health {{benefits to the}} host physiology. Although protective role of <b>probiotics</b> {{have been reported in}} diverse diseases, no information is available whether <b>probiotics</b> can modulate neuromuscular immune disorders. We have recently demonstrated that IRT 5 <b>probiotics,</b> a mixture of 5 <b>probiotics,</b> could suppress diverse experimental disorders in mice model. In this study we further investigated whether IRT 5 <b>probiotics</b> could modulate the progression of experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis (EAMG). Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a T cell dependent antibody mediated autoimmune disorder in which acetylcholine receptor (AChR) at the neuromuscular junction is the major auto-antigen. Oral administration of IRT 5 <b>probiotics</b> significantly reduced clinical symptoms of EAMG such as weight loss, body trembling and grip strength. Prophylactic effect of IRT 5 <b>probiotics</b> on EMAG is mediated by down-regulation of effector function of AChR-reactive T cells and B cells. Administration of IRT 5 <b>probiotics</b> decreased AChR-reactive lymphocyte proliferation, anti-AChR reactive IgG levels and inflammatory cytokine levels such as IFN-c, TNF-a, IL- 6 and IL- 17. Down-regulation of inflammatory mediators in AChR-reactive lymphocytes by IRT 5 <b>probiotics</b> is mediated by the generation of regulatory dendritic cells (rDCs) that express increased levels of IL- 10, TGF-b, arginase 1 and aldh 1 a 2. Furthermore, DCs isolated from IRT 5 probiotics-fed group effectively converted CD 4 + T cells into CD 4 +Foxp 3 + regulatory T cells compared with control DCs. Our data suggest that IRT 5 <b>probiotics</b> could be applicable to modulate antibody mediated autoimmun...|$|R

25|$|Since Metchnikoff, {{advances}} in science have uncovered {{that the process}} of pathogenic inhibition is more complex than simply increasing the acidity in the colon, as the <b>probiotic</b> bacteria produce bacteriocins, bacterial synthesized proteins that inhibit pathogenic bacteria. In the case of L. bulgaricus this bacteriocin is called bulgaricin. Also there is a complex interplay between the <b>probiotic</b> bacteria and the body's immune system in the large intestine, where the good bacteria stimulate the body's own immune system to inhibit the pathogenic bacteria. For example, in a controlled study, 61 elderly volunteers, after 6 months of a daily dose of L. bulgaricus, responded to the intake of <b>probiotic</b> with an increase in the percentage of NK cells, an improvement in the parameters defining the immune risk profile (IRP), and an increase in the T cell subsets that are less differentiated.

One of the {{concerns}} throughout the scientific literature resides in the viability and reproducibility {{on a large scale}} of the observed results, as well as the viability and stability during use and storage, and finally the ability to survive in stomach acids and then in the intestinal ecosystem. Probiotics must have undergone controlled evaluation to document health benefits in the target host. Only products containing live organisms shown in reproducible human studies to confer a health benefit can actually claim to be a <b>probiotic.</b> The correct definition of health benefit, backed with solid scientific evidence, is a strong element for the proper identification and assessment of the effect of a <b>probiotic.</b> This aspect represents a major challenge for scientific and industrial investigations because several difficulties arise, such as variability in the site for <b>probiotic</b> use (oral, vaginal, intestinal) and mode of application.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE To defi ne {{the term}} <b>probiotics,</b> to {{indicate}} how to identify products that have been proven benefi cial, and to assess the quality of evidence regarding <b>probiotics.</b> QUALITY OF EVIDENCE A few level I studies support the eff ectiveness of specifi c <b>probiotics</b> for certain diagnoses. For most so-called <b>probiotics,</b> however, weak or no evidence supports their eff ectiveness. MAIN MESSAGE <b>Probiotics</b> are live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefi t on the host. Level I evidence supports use of VSL# 3 for maintaining remission of infl ammatory colitis. <b>Probiotics</b> for treating vaginal infections, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR- 1 and Lactobacillus reuteri RC- 14, have level I evidence of eff ectiveness, but are not available in Canada. Specifi c <b>probiotics</b> taken for certain indications improve health and have few side eff ects. CONCLUSION Limited but good evidence supports the role of certain <b>probiotics</b> in medical practice. Because consumer pressure will undoubtedly stimulate further interest in <b>probiotics,</b> family doctors need to be informed about them so they can advise their patients appropriately.
