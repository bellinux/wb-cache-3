5000|$|Most Parliaments, {{for obvious}} reasons of rationalising their work, limit the scope for {{individual}} members to act singly.

This is an important rationalisation of Parliament’s work. Instead of 626 individual members all tabling their own texts, amendments and so on and all wishing to speak on every issue, the Group system allows speakers, motions, amendments etc. to be tabled on behalf of a large number of like minded members. A ‘Technical’ or ‘Mixed’ Group with no <b>political</b> <b>affinity</b> would not be able to operate in this way. On whose behalf would amendments be tabled, for instance, or motions proposed? If the members of the Group have no <b>political</b> <b>affinity</b> whatsoever, then the rights exercised ‘in the name of the Group’ would in fact be exercised on behalf of individual components of the Group (either single members or parties within the Group), thereby giving such components rights not enjoyed by comparable components of other groups.|$|E

Oriya, hitherto largely spoken in the coastal Orissa, was planted as the language of Sambalpur and the other regions of Western Orissa overlooking Sambalpuri, which was the language of this region. As a result, there is considerable cultural difference between the people of two halves of Orissa and as the seat of power is in Eastern or coastal Orissa, the rich and fertile west serves only as a colony to be exploited, burdened and its resources harnessed to feed and develop Eastern Orissa.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{serves to}} shed light on a topic that has received little to no prior attention: the ways in which local media report state legislative campaigns. Previous research has tested the relationship between federal elections and the media, but the same cannot be said at the state level.

A study of newspaper output for six months before Election Day on November 6 th found that state legislators are rarely reported in the news at all. In a total of 360 politically relevant articles found in this time span for the three newspapers, only 26 articles contained information about state legislators. This shows that newspapers provide very little coverage of these figures. Although the conclusions drawn from these results were forcibly limited in scope, this research found supporting evidence that incumbency, political party, tone, name placement, and federal coverage all contribute to the explanation of how newspapers cover state legislative campaigns.

In 1254 (or 1260) Jatavarman first dragged the Hoysalas into war by routing his son Ramanatha out of Tiruchy. Vira Someshwara Hoysala, who had given the control of the empire to his sons, had to come out of his slumber and tried to challenge Jatavarman.

5000|$|Both Henry's {{personal}} and political lives were intertwined with that of David Lloyd George. When Lloyd George formed his coalition government with the Conservatives in December 1916, Henry {{was one of those}} Liberals who stayed on the government side and he was generally identified as a strong supporter of the new prime minister. But there was more than just <b>political</b> <b>affinity</b> between Henry and Lloyd George. Henry and his wife had been close to Lloyd George since at least the time of the death of his daughter Mair in 1907. Henry hosted a trip to Germany for Lloyd George in 1908 to allow Lloyd George, then recently appointed as Chancellor of the Exchequer, to study the invalidity insurance and contributory old age pensions which had been introduced there by Otto von Bismarck twenty-five years before. They also travelled together abroad socially to Nice and Monte Carlo [...] and other European destinations.The American Lady Henry had pretensions to be one of London's great political hostesses and Lloyd George often attended her functions in London and at their home at Henley-on-Thames, sometimes taking his son Richard with him. Lloyd George also attended Henry family occasions at Henry’s London home at Carlton Gardens. It is not known for certain if Lloyd George and Julia Henry had an affair, although one of Lloyd George’s biographers states that they did, adding that it was not serious on Lloyd George's part. However they certainly flirted together and corresponded privately with each other. Richard Lloyd George apparently thought his father could be in love with the “dark, tall and very attractive Lady J.” [...] and that they were having an affair. Even King Edward VII was concerned {{that there had been a}} lot of gossip about Lady Julia and Lloyd George and this may have delayed her husband's getting his knighthood. Frances Stevenson certainly believed that Lloyd George had not only been close to Lady Henry but that Lady Henry herself was clearly in love with him describing her as 'quite mad' about him. After Frances Stevenson started working for Lloyd George in 1911 and he began to become attracted to her, Lloyd George determined to stop any dalliance with Julia Henry. She was distressed by what she saw as a public snub and fled back to America, writing to her husband that she never wanted to be alone with Lloyd George again. It seems unlikely that Henry himself was aware of anything going on from Lloyd George's side. If anything he seems to have thought it was all in his wife's mind and believed she was exaggerating their relationship. It is also clear that Lady Henry's hurt feelings had a lot to do with the damage Lloyd George's rejection could do to her reputation as a political hostess.Some reconciliation was affected in 1915 when Lloyd George visited the Henrys to show sympathy on the loss of their son in battle even though he was reluctant to do so because of the awkwardness arising from his previous relationship with Lady Henry and the strength of Julia Henry’s feelings for him. Lloyd George also visited Henry when he was ill and dying in 1919, despite Lady Henry’s making a scene and her trying to use his visits to her advantage with other members of the social set. However the final breach with Lady Julia came the year after Henry’s death in recriminations over Lloyd George’s alleged misuse of £20,000 donated by American friends of the Henrys for British war charities.|$|E
40|$|In {{the study}} of {{contemporary}} politics few interstate relationships have proven more instrumental, controversial, and perplexing to global policy makers than that which has persisted between Moscow and Tehran {{since the collapse of}} the USSR. Despite the great importance of Russian-Iranian relations to questions of global and regional politics there has, to date, been very {{little in the way of}} critical scholarship performed on the subject. While a wide-array of accounts from subject analysts provide a wealth of data on contemporary and historical events which have presumably defined and conditioned bilateral relations, there has been relatively little effort to isolate, examine, test, and evaluate those conditions or variables that are deemed salient to cooperation. In light of these circumstances, this study seeks to initiate a tradition of scholarship on Russian-Iranian relations that appeals broadly to the use of a scientific methodology. The first step of any scientific inquiry requires attention devoted expressly to the development of a dependent variable of bilateral <b>political</b> <b>affinity.</b> While it remains outside the scope of this present investigation to analyze the host of factors/conditions capable of influencing bilateral relations, the formalization of a variable which records changing <b>political</b> <b>affinity</b> is a necessary first step and one that will fill-in a significant gap within the existing literary tradition. Rather than simply dismissing the extant tradition of literature on Russian-Iranian relations, this study seeks to aggregate and transform the subject 2 ̆ 7 s many diverse narratives into a user-friendly, quantitative, political metric which can form the basis for future empirical inquiry. Thus this study introduces a new approach to monitoring and measuring changes in Russian-Iranian cooperation known as General <b>Political</b> <b>Affinity</b> (GPA). Represented on the basis of a 21 -point scaled indicator of bilateral affinity, GPA succinctly defines cooperation between Moscow and Tehran as the summation of three underlying, persistent issue dimensions: the trade in conventional weapons; cooperation in Iranian nuclear development; and level of agreement on matters of Caspian Sea delimitation. In more generic terms, these three criteria seek to evaluate interstate cooperation, generically, as a product of: defense cooperation; state-sponsored development assistance; and territorial agreement. The unique approach to operationalizing <b>political</b> <b>affinity</b> presented in this study not only functionally improves our ability to explain and predict the course of Russian-Iranian relations, but also provides a new schematic for evaluating bilateral relations among all political dyads...|$|E

The introduction outlines the research context, the conceptual frameworks, the key terminology used in the thesis, {{as well as how}} my personal and professional life-story inspired this research. In Chapter Two, I discuss the research methodology, sites and spaces, describe the process of multi-sited ethnography in Brazil and Mozambique and reflect about my positionality. The main body of the thesis moves from the macro to the micro level. Chapters 3 and 4 map the reproduction of development and knowledge hierarchies within South-South cooperation institutional discourses and practices and the production of a political economy of opportunities and international mobility for Brazilian development workers. The following chapters discuss how difference and sameness, proximity and distance, and horizontality and verticality are experienced in interactions between Brazilian and Mozambican development workers. Chapter 5 explores principal ways in which the notion of kinship structure relations and imaginaries. Chapter 6 examines affinities, hierarchy and power in an International Non-Governmental Organisation office in Maputo, while Chapter 7 discusses <b>political</b> <b>affinities</b> in feminist knowledge practices.

40|$|The present article {{introduces}} some of {{the central}} themes explored across the contributions to this special issue on media cultures and politics, and sets them in a broader context. Media production, circulation and consumption in South Asia are increasingly central to national and transnational political and cultural processes [...] religious re-nationalisation and diasporisation in particular. New forms and flows of media serve to legitimate, {{as well as to}} contest, economic liberalisation, globalisation, and nuclearisation. Media discourses on cosmopolitanism and communalism are no longer necessarily oppositional, but are increasingly found to be mutually constitutive. Such trends may be explained, in part, as a defensive response to fears of 'cultural invasion' and loss of 'traditional values' associated with the advent of economic liberalisation and satellite television. Central to such developments is the increased targetting and representation of a mobile, global, middle class [...] but where does this leave the slum dwellers? What will be the socio-political consequences of stimulating an increased desire to consume among those with little or no power to do so? Are the disenchantments of modernity fuelling regressive <b>political</b> <b>affinities?</b> How are the symbols and narratives of religious nationalism woven into the fabric of everyday media? These are central questions for a transnational media study today, which the present special issue begins to address. The hegemony of Indian media in South Asia remains, as does the marginalisation of the many other national and regional cinemas and television cultures. What is clear is that a critical media study must provoke us to question all seemingly fixed boundaries and categories. In view of the communal conflicts in India and Pakistan today, this has never been more urgent...|$|R
