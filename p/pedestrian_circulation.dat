2500|$|In the 1920s, {{the ideas}} of modernism began to surface in urban planning. The {{influential}} modernist architect Le Corbusier presented his scheme for a [...] "Contemporary City" [...] for three million inhabitants (Ville Contemporaine) in 1922. The centrepiece of this plan was the group of sixty-story cruciform skyscrapers, steel-framed office buildings encased in huge curtain walls of glass. These skyscrapers were set within large, rectangular, park-like green spaces. At the centre was a huge transportation hub that on different levels included depots for buses and trains, as well as highway intersections, and at the top, an airport. Le Corbusier had the fanciful notion that commercial airliners would land between the huge skyscrapers. He segregated <b>pedestrian</b> <b>circulation</b> paths from the roadways and glorified the automobile {{as a means of}} transportation. As one moved out from the central skyscrapers, smaller low-story, zig-zag apartment blocks (set far back from the street amid green space) housed the inhabitants. Le Corbusier hoped that politically minded industrialists in France would lead the way with their efficient Taylorist and Fordist strategies adopted from American industrial models to re-organise society.|$|E

40|$|A {{community}} center serves people in close proximity. It draws {{residents of the}} immediate neighborhood and those commuting to that neighborhood for work and other purposes. It {{has the power to}} form a sense of community that many communities lack. It consolidates different wants and needs in one location. However, existing {{community center}}s, especially the ones in Hawai‘i, often lack these qualities. Simply put, they are basically senior and childcare centers. Buildings labeled “community centers” are not designed with the programs and spatial qualities that would attract a wide range of age groups. The unnoticeable locations of most community centers do not advocate the importance of community centers either. By incorporating a community center on top of an existing retail center, the resulting hybrid can create exciting changes that can accommodate for the programmatic and social needs of individuals. A retail development is ideal for addition of a community center for several reasons. Retail has the ability to unite people in a way that few other places can. Everyone has shopped in one way or another. A retail center’s central and visible location can help create an identity for and magnify the significance of the integrated community center. However, the single-functionality of typical retail centers has caused many to run out of business. There is a growing desire for greater living in today’s urban developments; it is about creating enjoyable environments for buying goods and spending time. People visit retail environments wanting to shop, dine, socialize, and be entertained. Retail cannot function as a single entity. Rather, it is a subunit that supports other uses, such as a community center. More importantly, second floor retail has been proven unworkable through the years because Americans are accustomed to shopping on the street level. Thus, the addition of a community center above an existing retail development is a feasible solution that would promote positive changes to both building types. Successful civic facilities address <b>pedestrian</b> <b>circulations</b> and activity spaces, which can serve as catalysts for buying goods. The resulting hybrid development merges two disparate functions to support and benefit from each other. Areas where the functions of the two overlay can pose opportunities for exciting interventions. This new combination of mixed-use can increase efficiency by concentrating more uses into a central location. The architecture of a retail and community center can bring about numerous spatial and program changes to correspond to the needs and lifestyles of the residents that it serves...|$|R
40|$|Parking {{areas are}} an {{important}} component of many transportation facilities such as safety rest areas, park and ride lots, and viewpoints. The parking area is often the first thing users see upon entering the facility, creating an important first impression. The optimum design for a parking area is not necessarily one that provides the maximum number of parking spaces. It is one that provides safe <b>pedestrian</b> and vehicular <b>circulation,</b> with ample stall and aisle widths, adequate turning radii, reasonable gradients, a pleasing appearance, visual access for law enforcement surveillance, provisions for handling and treating stormwater runoff, fits the site, is easy to maintain, and is in close proximity to the facility it serves.

Studies show that the use of shaded parking in hot weather can reduce noxious emissions by up to a ton a day for a municipality. The use of porous pavements for overflow parking areas can decrease the size of stormwater facilities needed. Parking facilities must conform to local (city or county) regulations and zoning codes in addition to the guidelines outlined in this chapter...|$|R

The purpose of this project is to provide detailed and accurate information for the campus master plan revision, which is currently developed by the research team of the Laboratory for Architectural Technology and Spatial Planning. An analysis of the changing needs and priorities related to academic program planning, student demands and faculty and administrative requirements is also provided. Included in the analysis are: identification of sites for future development, suggestions for improved <b>pedestrian</b> and vehicular <b>circulation</b> and parking systems, as well as landscape plans, designed to improve the overall look and functionality of the entire campus. In a further stage of the process, the system will be made available to the University Technical Administration staff, providing guidelines and procedures for the orderly and systematic development of the campus. The outcome of this research-planning project is an example of an information-technology-based planning system, which can be applied to a variety of spatial problems combining relevant geographic, statistical and other data and by using analytical methods and criteria. Based on reliable data and analytical procedures, planners or administrative officers can effectively prepare strategies and recommendations. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{renaissance of}} the American city's a {{phenomena}} of great potential {{but also one}} which threatens to destroy the fragile balance of elements that structure the city. In the rebuilding and reoccupation of these urban environments, architects and planners must {{bear in mind that}} infusions of new architecture must be carefully knitted into the existing economic, social and architectural context. This thesis examines specifically how commercial buildings have been, and should be integrated with the existing urban fabric. The design portion of the thesis is the generation of an alternative program and design scheme for a proposed regional shopping mall for the central business district of Pittsfield, Massachusetts. The process begins with a brief investigation into the economic and political history of the mall's development to date, and into an understanding of the principles of shopping mall design as they are currently practised. More importantly it is an investigation of urban architectural vocabularies as they relate to street edges of commercial districts, ranging from the scale of large buildings to that of street furniture. With the help of this information. the design project suggests that the success of new retail development in the American city depends upon the acknowledgement of the public street as the sole organizer of social and economic activities {{in addition to being a}} channel for <b>pedestrian</b> and vehicular <b>circulation.</b> by Arthur W.

It is part of the Metro Center neighborhood and adjacent to the Union Station that will be revitalized in 2016. The district is challenged by high vacancies and general abandonment. Housing opportunities and market-rate housing in particular are very low. The primary goal of the project was to develop a staged vision to revitalize and rediscover the Upper Lyman Warehouse District and to improve livability in the heart of downtown Springfield for employers, employees, residents, and visitors. The following recommendations can be articulated:Zoning regulations and creative incentives should encourage mixed land uses. Strategies such as adaptive reuse for significant historic buildings or urban infill could keep some of the historic character. New housing typologies should attract a diverse clientele to accommodate different styles of life, create a robust mix and support the vibrancy of the city. New retail with focus on grocery markets can attracts people to live in downtown and provides food security.

40|$|La Red de Alamedas de Bogota is a {{new type}} of public space project {{consisting}} in a network of tree lined pedestrian streets with bicycle paths. Alamedas connect parks and natural systems as well as residential areas and urban facilities. In general,. £!,Iamedas have been proposed for the periphery of the city where {{there is a lack of}} public space. La red de Alamedas was developed during the administration of Enrique Perialosa, Bogota City Mayorfrom 1998 to 2000; improvement of the quantity and quality of public space was one of Penalosa's government plan priorities. Moreover, a new general plan for the city, Plan de Ordenamiento Territorial, POT was developed during those years. Thus, alamedas became public space projects in more comprehensive interventions in the city. Alamedas proceed from a range of concerns in the construction of the city such as the development of public space projects to overcome the difficulties of general plans when dealing with particular problems and specific areas, and as a way to improve the quality of life in the city. Besides, alamedas can be considered a reinterpretation of promenades and paseos, an urban type which has been present in the city since colonial times. Alamedas have been proposed as a new public space which is superimposed to the existing urban structure in certain areas in order to reorganize the urban structure and at the same time as a new way of building the city that is, through the construction of public space in the first place. Most the alamedas are still urban design projects, only two of the alamedas included in this document have been built. Alamedas have different characters according to the areas and the urban conditions of the proposed corridors. Alameda EI Porvenir, the most ambitious one has been studied in more depth. Alamedas work as an alternative path for <b>pedestrian</b> and bicycle <b>circulation</b> and are at the same time a recreational space; besides, alamedas have also started to become a representative space much in the way of the traditional plaza. by Marcela Angel Samper.

The title of the project, Deep-Time Probe, Investigations in Light-Architecture, explores {{the use of an}} optically active-SETI experiment that centers on the thematic of time, vision, and movement through space. The realm of architecture was the digital glue that united the varied disciplines. The core of the project is broken down into three intrinsically linked components ? data representation ? collection, storage, and modulation, the Project Mission Wall, and the resultant Light Architecture or Deep-Time Probe. A small team of architecture students under the direction of one architecture faculty member designed the Mission Wall while the Robotics Department provided CNC machinery to digitally mill and fabricate its components. This same team assembled the 40 ix 60 ix 15 i structure in one day. The site of the launch created an adequate interface for the public art structure at the scale of an urban park. The scale of the Mission Wall addressed a variety of places, paces, and scales that mediated between the laser, the context of the surrounding plaza, and <b>pedestrian</b> and vehicular <b>circulation,</b> all while concealing the laser from direct view. The Mission Wall served three functions. It provided a housing for the Deep-Time Probe laser. It created windows and scaffolding for lighting. Moreover, it established a series of “View Corridorsi that provided the onlooker with multiple vantage points and thus multiple-readings of information as architecture. Nearly fifty “Time Probe Reporters” gathered information through oral interviews. In addition to messages linked to the interviews, the Deep-Time Probe contained verbal and graphic information, images depicting the design and fabrication processes. At the time of the launch, the design team digitized, specially formatted, converted, and modulated the data into a special high-powered laser that was “launchedi into space.
