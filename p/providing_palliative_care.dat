By this time, relations between the parents and the doctors had deteriorated. One GOSH doctor emailed another: [...] "Parents are spanner in the works. Recent deterioration with worsening seizures means trial is not in his best interests." [...] The email emerged in the subsequent court case; the judge said that he understood the distress it had caused the parents, but that it was important to view the email in the context of notes passed between consultants about Charlie's best interests.|$|E

50|$|In October 2016, Charlie was {{transferred}} to London's Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH), a National Health Service (NHS) children's hospital, because he was failing to thrive and his breathing was shallow. He was placed on mechanical ventilation, and in November MDDS was diagnosed. The following month the parents contacted a neurologist in New York, Michio Hirano, who was working on an experimental treatment based on nucleoside supplementation with human MDDS patients. He and GOSH agreed {{to proceed with the}} treatment, funded by the NHS. In January, after Charlie had seizures that caused brain damage, GOSH formed the view that further treatment was futile and might prolong suffering. They began discussions with the parents about ending life support and <b>providing</b> <b>palliative</b> <b>care.</b>|$|E
50|$|While India ranks at {{the bottom}} of the Index in overall score, and {{performs}} badly on many indicators, Kerala, if measured on the same points, would buck the trend. With only 3% of India's population, the tiny state provides two-thirds of India's palliative care services. The Economist has lauded the 'Kerala Community Model' in healthcare. Moreover, The Economist has patted the Kerala Government for <b>providing</b> <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> policy (It is the only Indian state with such a policy) and funding for community-based care programmes. Kerala had pioneered Universal health care through extensive public health services. Hans Rosling also highlighted this when he said Kerala matches United States in health but not in economy and took the example of Washington, D.C. which is much richer but is less healthy compared to Kerala.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE To assess {{challenges}} in <b>providing</b> <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> in long-term care (LTC) facilities {{from the perspective}} of medical directors. DESIGN Cross-sectional mailed survey. A questionnaire was developed, reviewed, pilot-tested, and sent to 450 medical directors representing 531 LTC facilities. Responses were rated on 2 different 5 -point scales. Descriptive analyses were conducted on all responses. SETTING All licensed LTC facilities in Ontario with designated medical directors. PARTICIPANTS Medical directors in the facilities. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Demographic and practice characteristics of physicians and facilities, importance of potential barriers to <b>providing</b> <b>palliative</b> <b>care,</b> strategies that could be helpful in <b>providing</b> <b>palliative</b> <b>care,</b> and the kind of training in palliative care respondents had received. RESULTS Two hundred seventy-fi ve medical directors (61 %) representing 302 LTC facilities (57 %) responded to the survey. Potential barriers to <b>providing</b> <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> were clustered into 3 groups: facility staff’s capacity to provide palliative care, education and support, and the need for external resources. Two thirds of respondents (67. 1 %) reported that inadequate staffi ng in their facilitie...|$|E

For those in their 50s and 60s, the percentage was higher, with about 20% reporting having <b>provided</b> <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> to a family member or friend. Women were also more likely to have <b>provided</b> <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> over their lifetimes, with 16% of women reporting having done so, compared with 10% of men. These caregivers helped terminally ill family members or friends with personal or medical care, food preparation, managing finances or providing transportation to and from medical appointments.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} the <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> <b>provided</b> by physicians in the Quebec city region {{and to identify}} factors that affect its delivery. DESIGN: Mailed survey. SETTING: Quebec city region. PARTICIPANTS: General practitioners in active clinical practice. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Physicians' personal and professional characteristics and their <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> practice (volume of work, source of requests for follow-up care, place of delivery of care, resources used, difficulties, encountered). RESULTS: Of the 476 physicians (67 %) who responded to our survey, 295 (62 %) <b>provided</b> <b>palliative</b> <b>care.</b> Of these, 70 % saw {{no more than two}} patients requiring <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> per month, and 55 % devoted no more than 2 hours per week to this aspect of patient care. Most (76 %) <b>provided</b> <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> {{in a variety of settings}} (private office, home, institution). Home care teams working out of local community health centres are the resource physicians drew upon most frequently (69 %). The main difficulties encountered were a lack of clinical expertise, scheduling home care, and providing patients and families with emotional support. CONCLUSION: Most physicians in the Quebec city region <b>provided</b> <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> occasionally. This care could be improved by removing various logistical and professional barriers...|$|R

40|$|Aim. This paper {{reports a}} study {{exploring}} district nurses' experiences of <b>providing</b> <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> {{for patients with}} cancer and their families. Background. There is an increasing demand for palliative care in the community, as many patients wish to die at home. District nurses are central to <b>providing</b> <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> in the community, {{but there is a}} dearth of literature on district nurses' experiences in palliative care. Method. A Husserlian phenomenological approach was adopted with a purposive sample of 25 female district nurses. Data were collected using unstructured, tape-recorded interviews and analysed using Colaizzi's seven stages of data analysis. Findings. Four themes were identified: the communication web; the family as an element of care; challenges for the district nurse in symptom management and the personal cost of caring. Conclusions. District nurses' experiences of <b>providing</b> <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> to family units was challenging but rewarding. The emotive nature of the experience cannot be under-estimated, as many district nurses were touched by the varying situations. Whilst acknowledging the need to maintain an integrated approach to care, district nurses should be identified as the key workers in the complex situation of palliative care...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Uganda {{is seen as}} {{a leading}} country in Africa {{regarding}} palliative care, but still far from all dying patients receive this specialized care. Many of them decease in non- palliative hospital wards, taken care of by nurses who do not have specialized education in palliative care. No research has been done in Uganda where these nurses’ experiences and perceptions of <b>providing</b> <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> has been examined. Purpose: To describe the experiences and perceptions of <b>providing</b> <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> among general nurses in a non-palliative medicine ward at Mulago hospital in Kampala, Uganda. Method: A qualitative method was used consisting of semi-structured interviews with seven general nurses working in a non-palliative medicine ward at Mulago Hospital in Kampala, Uganda. The participants were chosen through convenience sampling, and the data were analyzed by a qualitative content analysis. The results were discussed {{on the basis of the}} theoretical framework chosen for this study, the cognitive-motivational-relational theory of Lazarus. Results: In this study five categories were identified: <b>providing</b> <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> by own preconditions, giving symptom relief, involving the relatives, informing and communicating and working in a team. The nurses were familiar with the concept of palliative care but their knowledge about it was limited, often perceiving it as mostly being about physical pain relief. The nurses showed a willingness to improve their work with end-of-life care, but problems like staff shortage and lack of knowledge were described as hindering. To communicate with the patients and their relatives was identified as the biggest challenge among the nurses. Conclusion:  The nurses experienced <b>providing</b> <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> as difficult in many aspects such as communicating, symptom relief, teamwork and supporting relatives. They described the providing of palliative care as being emotionally challenging. Staff shortage and lack of knowledge and resources were perceived as hinders, preventing them from doing a good job. Overall the nurses wished more education in the subject, showing a willingness to improve their work with palliative patients...|$|E

Method: A qualitative approach was adopted. One-to-one interviews and facilitated case discussions were undertaken with 30 community nurses who had <b>provided</b> <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> to a child or young person with cancer. A grounded theory approachwas used for data analysis. Findings: Because of the relative rarity of childhood cancer many CCNs and CPCNs engage infrequently in the <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> of children or young people. This {{makes it difficult for}} them to develop and maintain knowledge and skills. There is a variation in the out-of-hours service provision available to families. Conclusion: Further funding is needed to develop teams of trained, experienced CCNs and CPCNs who can <b>provide</b> <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> for children and young people 24 hours a day and 365 days a year.
