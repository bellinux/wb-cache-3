5|$|As {{a powder}} {{or in the}} form of metal shavings, {{titanium}} metal <b>poses</b> <b>a</b> significant fire hazard and, when heated in air, an explosion hazard. Water and carbon dioxide are ineffective for extinguishing a titanium fire; Class D dry powder agents must be used instead.|$|E
5|$|As {{domestic}} {{cats are}} little altered from wildcats, they can readily interbreed. This hybridization <b>poses</b> <b>a</b> {{danger to the}} genetic distinctiveness of some wildcat populations, particularly in Scotland and Hungary and possibly also the Iberian Peninsula.|$|E
5|$|Manhattan is {{near the}} Nemaha Ridge, a long {{structure}} that is bounded by several faults. The nearby Humboldt Fault Zone in particular <b>poses</b> <b>a</b> threat to the city; though Kansas is not known for earthquake activity, an earthquake could occur at any time.|$|E
50|$|Domed or gripped {{heads are}} {{sometimes}} preferred over flat heads as dropped flat-headed tacks will point upward, <b>posing</b> <b>a</b> hazard. Thumb tacks also <b>pose</b> <b>a</b> hazard of ingestion and choking, {{where they may}} do serious harm.|$|R
2500|$|Alkanes also <b>pose</b> <b>a</b> {{threat to}} the environment. Branched alkanes have a lower {{biodegradability}} than unbranched alkanes.

5|$|Another {{example is}} the city of Berkeley, California. The tree {{protection}} ordinance prohibits the removal of coast live oak trees and any excessive pruning that can cause harm to the tree is also prohibited.

5|$|As a result, many {{countries}} in the Pacific region emulated the lead of Puerto Rico and introduced the toad in the 1930s. There are introduced populations in Australia, Florida, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, the Ogasawara, Ishigaki Island and the Daitō Islands of Japan, most Caribbean islands, Fiji and many other Pacific islands, including Hawaii. Since then, the cane toad has become a pest in many host countries, and <b>poses</b> <b>a</b> serious threat to native animals.|$|E
5|$|B.spinulosa {{does not}} appear to be under threat. It is {{resistant}} to Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback, which <b>poses</b> <b>a</b> major threat to many other Banksia species; and its wide distribution protects against the threat of habitat loss due to land clearing. As a result, it {{does not appear}} on the list of threatened Australian plants under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999.|$|E
50|$|Feral animals <b>pose</b> <b>a</b> huge {{threat to}} native species due to predation, disease and competition. Feral cats for example have been {{responsible}} for reduced numbers and extinction of small mammals and birds.) Rabbits <b>pose</b> <b>a</b> threat to the survival of tree seedlings competition with native herbivores.|$|R
50|$|The fire never <b>posed</b> <b>a</b> {{threat to}} urban areas because the {{majority}} of the blaze was located in Angeles National Forest. The Powerhouse Fire did <b>pose</b> <b>a</b> threat to local forests as well as to powerlines, watershed areas, and the habitats of threatened and endangered species.|$|R
25|$|Emergency – An Emergency {{is issued}} when {{an event that}} by itself cannot <b>pose</b> <b>a</b> threat to life or property, but may {{indirectly}} cause other events to happen that may <b>pose</b> <b>a</b> threat to life or property. An example {{of this would be}} a power outage, which although not directly <b>posing</b> <b>a</b> hazard, may threaten public safety and critical services. The only existing exceptions to this are the tornado emergency and flash flood emergency, which are issued {{to get the attention of}} the public to a major tornado or flash flood.|$|R
5|$|Bahrain invests {{little in}} {{research}} and development. In 2009 and 2013, this investment reportedly amounted to 0.04% of GDP, although the data were incomplete, covering only the higher education sector. The lack of comprehensive data {{on research and development}} <b>poses</b> <b>a</b> challenge for policy-makers, as data inform evidence-based policy-making.|$|E
5|$|Discarding one's {{corrective}} lenses, as Bates recommended, or wearing lenses {{weaker than}} one's prescribed correction, as some Bates method advocates suggest, <b>poses</b> <b>a</b> potential safety hazard in certain situations, especially {{when one is}} operating a motor vehicle. James Randi related that his father, shortly after discarding glasses {{on the advice of}} Bates' book, wrecked his car. Bates method teachers often caution that when driving, one should wear the correction legally required.|$|E
5|$|Ecuador {{is still}} at risk from earthquakes: Both intraplate (such as those in March 1987) and {{interplate}} earthquakes are possible. Intraplate seismicity <b>poses</b> <b>a</b> more formidable threat, {{as it can be}} much more powerful than interplate seismicity and is usually associated with landslides, subsidence, and even soil liquefaction.|$|E
50|$|Didymo {{can have}} a notable impact on the insects that are a food source for many species of fish. It can form massive algal blooms. It makes riverbeds {{slippery}} <b>posing</b> <b>a</b> danger to waders and swimmers.

5|$|Emerging economies {{like those}} of China and India aspire to the living {{standards}} of the Western world as does the non-industrialized world in general. It is the combination of population increase {{in the developing world}} and unsustainable consumption levels in the developed world that <b>poses</b> <b>a</b> stark challenge to sustainability.|$|E
5|$|Hedgehogs are not {{native to}} the Outer Hebrides—they were {{introduced}} in the 1970s to reduce garden pests—and their spread <b>poses</b> <b>a</b> threat to the eggs of ground nesting wading birds. In 2003, Scottish Natural Heritage undertook culls of hedgehogs in the area although these were halted in 2007 due to protests; trapped animals were instead relocated to the mainland.|$|E
5|$|However, von Rhein {{notes that}} the theater's size <b>poses</b> <b>a</b> {{challenge}} to the performers attempting to fill its seats, and feels that it overemphasizes high-priced events. In 2009–2010, the theater introduced a pair of discounted ticket programs: a five dollar lunchtime series of 45-minute dance performances, and a discounted ten dollar ticket program was initiated for in-person, cash-only purchases in the last 90 minutes before performances.|$|E

5|$|Human {{activities}} such as encroachment of settlements, agriculture, and hunting in rural areas <b>poses</b> <b>a</b> threat to the Natal red rock hare, due to which its population is decreasing. Since the 1900s, more than 21% to 50% of its habitat has been destroyed, which is predicted to remain between 21% and 50% till 2022, decreasing its population by 20% or more by then.|$|E
5|$|Mt. Rainier is {{considered}} one of the most dangerous volcanoes in the world, and it is on the Decade Volcano list. Because of its large amount of glacial ice, Mt. Rainier could produce massive lahars that could threaten the entire Puyallup River valley, and <b>poses</b> <b>a</b> grave threat to the southern sections of the 3.7-million-resident Seattle metropolitan area.|$|E
5|$|Primary implant {{stability}} {{refers to}} the stability of a dental implant immediately after implantation. The stability of the titanium screw implant in the patient's bone tissue post surgery may be non-invasively assessed using resonance frequency analysis. Sufficient initial stability may allow immediate loading with prosthetic reconstruction, though early loading <b>poses</b> <b>a</b> higher risk of implant failure than conventional loading.|$|E

5|$|The South Volcanic Zone has a {{long history}} of eruptions and <b>poses</b> <b>a</b> threat to the {{surrounding}} region. Any volcanic hazard—ranging from minor ashfalls to pyroclastic flows—could pose a significant risk to humans and wildlife. Despite its inactivity, Cerro Azul could again produce a major eruption; if this were to happen, relief efforts would probably be quickly organized. Teams such as the Volcano Disaster Assistance Program (VDAP) are prepared to effectively evacuate, assist, and rescue people threatened by volcanic eruptions.|$|E
5|$|These {{concerns}} aside, B.integrifolia {{does not}} appear to be under threat. It has excellent resistance to Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback, which <b>poses</b> <b>a</b> major threat to many other Banksia species; and its wide distribution protects against the threat of habitat loss due to land clearing.
