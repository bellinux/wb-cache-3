As a result, real power is usually transmitted from the bus with higher voltage angle to the bus with lower voltage angle, and reactive power is usually transmitted from the bus with higher voltage magnitude to the bus with lower voltage magnitude.

40|$|Movement towards lower <b>power</b> supply <b>voltages</b> {{is driven}} by the demand that systems consume less and less power coupled with the desire {{to reduce the number of}} <b>power</b> supply <b>voltages</b> in the system. Lowering <b>power</b> supply <b>voltages</b> and {{reducing}} the number of supplies has obvious advantages. One such advantage is to lower system power consumption. This has the additional benefit of saving space. Lowering overall power consumption has a residual benefit in that there may no longer be a need for cooling fans in the system. However, as the traditional system <b>power</b> supply <b>voltages</b> of ± 15 V and ± 12 V give way to lower bipolar supplies of ± 5 V and single supplies of + 5 V and + 3. 3 V, it is necessary for circuit designers to understand that designing in this new environment is not simply a matte...|$|R

Aircraft often use 400 Hz power internally, so 50 Hz or 60 Hz to 400 Hz frequency conversion is needed for use in the ground power unit used to power the airplane while it is on the ground. Conversely, internal 400 Hz internal power may be converted to 50 Hz or 60 Hz for convenience power outlets available to passengers during flight.|$|E

5000|$|Like <b>power,</b> <b>voltage</b> {{and current}} are signed quantities. The current flow in a wire has two {{possible}} directions, so when defining a current variable i the direction which represents positive current flow must be indicated, usually by an arrow {{on the circuit}} diagram. [...] This is called the reference direction for current i. [...] If the actual current is in the opposite direction, the variable {{i will have a}} negative value. Similarly in defining a variable v representing the voltage between two terminals, the terminal which represents the positive side must be specified, usually with a plus sign. [...] This is called the reference direction for voltage v. If the terminal marked positive actually has a lower voltage than the other one, then the variable v will have a negative value.|$|E
50|$|The {{functional}} {{requirement of the}} high voltage pre-charge circuit is to minimize the peak current out from the power source by slowing down the dV/dT of the input <b>power</b> <b>voltage</b> such that a new “pre-charge mode” is created. Of course the inductive loads on the distribution system must be switched off during the precharge mode. While pre-charging, the system voltage will rise slowly and controllably with power-up current never exceeding the maximum allowed. As the circuit voltage approaches near steady state, then the pre-charge function is complete. Normal operation of a pre-charge circuit is to terminate pre-charge mode when the circuit voltage is 90% or 95% of the operating voltage. Upon completion of pre-charging, the pre-charge resistance is switched out of the power supply circuit and returns to a low impedance power source for normal mode. The high voltage loads are then powered up sequentially.|$|E
5000|$|As {{they are}} based on a linear {{regulator}} design, the input current required is always the same as the output current. As the input voltage must always be higher than the output voltage, this means that the total <b>power</b> (<b>voltage</b> multiplied by current) going into the 78xx will be more than the output power provided. The difference is dissipated as heat. This means both that for some applications an adequate heatsink must be provided, and also that a (often substantial) portion of the input power is wasted during the process, rendering them less efficient than some other types of power supplies. When the input voltage is significantly higher than the regulated output voltage (for example, powering a 7805 using a 24 volt power source), this inefficiency can be a significant issue. Buck converters may be preferred over 78xx regulators because they are more efficient and do not require heat sinks, but they are more expensive.|$|E

50|$|A {{switched-mode}} {{power supply}} (switching-mode power supply, switch-mode power supply, switched power supply, SMPS, or switcher) is an electronic power supply that incorporates a switching regulator to convert electrical power efficiently. Like other power supplies, an SMPS transfers power from a DC or AC source (often mains power) to DC loads, such as a personal computer, while converting voltage and current characteristics. Unlike a linear power supply, the pass transistor of a switching-mode supply continually switches between low-dissipation, full-on and full-off states, and spends very little time in the high dissipation transitions, which minimizes wasted energy. Ideally, a {{switched-mode power supply}} dissipates no <b>power.</b> <b>Voltage</b> regulation is achieved by varying the ratio of on-to-off time. In contrast, a linear power supply regulates the output voltage by continually dissipating power in the pass transistor. This higher power conversion efficiency is an important advantage of a switched-mode power supply. Switched-mode power supplies may also be substantially smaller and lighter than a linear supply due to the smaller transformer size and weight.|$|E
5000|$|For a given processor, C is a fixed value. However, V and f {{can vary}} considerably. For example, for a 1.6 GHz Pentium M, the clock {{frequency}} can be stepped down in 200 MHz decrements {{over the range}} from 1.6 to 0.6 GHz. At the same time, the voltage requirement decreases from 1.484 to 0.956 V. The {{result is that the}} power consumption theoretically goes down by a factor of 6.4. In practice, the effect may be smaller because some CPU instructions use less energy per tick of the CPU clock than others. For example, when an operating system is not busy, it tends to issue x86 halt (HLT) instructions, which suspend operation of parts of the CPU for a time period, so it uses less energy per tick of the CPU clock than when executing productive instructions in its normal state. For a given rate of work, a CPU running at a higher clock rate will execute a greater proportion of HLT instructions. The simple equation which relates <b>power,</b> <b>voltage</b> and frequency above also {{does not take into account}} the static power consumption of the CPU. This tends not to change with frequency, but does change with temperature and voltage. Hot electrons, and electrons exposed to a stronger electric field are more likely to migrate across a gate as [...] "gate leakage" [...] current, leading to an increase in static power consumption.|$|E
50|$|Generally base {{values of}} power and voltage are chosen. The base power may be the rating of {{a single piece of}} {{apparatus}} such as a motor or generator. If a system is being studied, the base power is usually chosen as a convenient round number such as 10 MVA or 100 MVA. The base voltage is chosen as the nominal rated voltage of the system. All other base quantities are derived from these two base quantities. Once the base power and the base voltage are chosen, the base current and the base impedance are determined by the natural laws of electrical circuits. Note the base value should only be magnitudes, while the per-unit values are phasors. The phase angles of complex <b>power,</b> <b>voltage,</b> current, impedance etc. are not affected by the conversion to per unit values.As we have already known, the purpose of introducing per-unit system is to simplify our conversion between different transformers. Hence, it is appropriate to illustrate the steps for finding per-unit values for voltage and impedance. First, let the base power (S_base) of each end of a transformer become the same. Once we set every S on the same base, we can get base voltage and base impedance for every transformer easily. The numbers we have until now are all based on the same unit. Next, substitute the real numbers of impedances and voltages into the per-unit calculation definition. We can get the answers for the per-unit system. In other case, if we have known the per-unit values at first, we can get the real values by multiplying by the base values.|$|E
