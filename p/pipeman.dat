2500|$|Wilson {{regarded}} {{himself as}} a [...] "man of the people" [...] and did much to promote this image, contrasting himself with the stereotypical aristocratic conservatives who had preceded him. Features of this portrayal included his working man's Gannex raincoat, his pipe (the British Pipesmokers' Council voted him Pipe Smoker of the Year in 1965 and <b>Pipeman</b> of the Decade in 1976, though in private he smoked cigars), his love of simple cooking and fondness for popular British relish HP Sauce, and his support for his home town's football team, Huddersfield Town. His speech showed a Yorkshire accent at times. Eschewing continental holidays, he returned every summer {{with his family to}} the Isles of Scilly. His first general election victory relied heavily on associating these down-to-earth attributes with a sense that the UK urgently needed to modernise, after [...] "thirteen years of Tory mis-rule...". These characteristics were exaggerated in Private Eye's satirical column [...] "Mrs Wilson's Diary".|$|E

50|$|Pipe Smoker of the Year was {{an award}} given out {{annually}} by the British Pipesmokers' Council, to honour a famous pipe-smoking individual. Initiated in 1965 as <b>Pipeman</b> of the Year by the Briar Pipe Trade Association, it {{was presented at}} a lunch in London's Savoy Hotel each January. The award was discontinued in 2004 because its organisers feared it fell foul of laws banning all advertising and promotion of tobacco.The award was reintroduced in 2014, by the UK Federation of Pipe Clubs, at the British Pipe Smoking Championship at Newark Showground. In a departure from previous awards the recipient was not a celebrity, but the outgoing President of the UK Federation of Pipe Clubs Brian Mills, in recognition for his personal contribution in recommencing the British Pipe Smoking Championships.|$|E

40|$|An {{effective}} {{approach to}} infer {{the functions of}} genes {{is to use the}} concept of gene orthology. Because orthologous genes are likely to share similar functions, the functions of genes in an unstudied species can be inferred through the functions of their orthologs in a studied model species. To infer gene functions for a multitude of species, we developed a high-throughput orthology prediction method, termed PhyloTrace. PhyloTrace is both highly accurate and computationally efficient for large-scale applications, having the ability to infer orthologous genes across thousands of species. This is accomplished through three major steps: 1) all-against-all gene comparisons for every pair of genes, 2) pair-wise orthology predictions for every two genomes, and 3) the generation of orthologous clusters that contain orthologous genes across multiple genomes. We employed the previously developed <b>Pipeman</b> parallelization program to break down a set of millions of input sequences into small chunks and then processed them in parallel. We successfully predicted orthologs for over 900 bacterial genomes, achieving a false-positive prediction rate of 2. 0 %, which was a significant improvement compared with the widely used bidirectional best-hit method, which yielded a false-positive rate of 5. 5 %...|$|E
