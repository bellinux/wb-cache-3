50|$|One {{method for}} {{improving}} nitrogen utilisation by ruminants and reduce greenhouse gases (CH4, N2O), without altering their nitrogen and energy value, {{is to use}} forages that contain condensed tannins, such as sainfoin. The nutritive value of sainfoin, despite its lower nitrogen content than lucerne, is high. Future research, on the nutritional impact of condensed tannins is likely not only be based on condensed tannin content, but also include structure-activity considerations.The results obtained, with sheep at maintenance fed a diet containing only sainfoin will be tested with producing animals, for example growing sheep and cattle, lactating ewes, goats or cows. In producing animals the diet will comprise different forage sources and supplement feeds. Sainfoin is seldom used as a <b>pure</b> <b>crop</b> and is generally introduced in pasture in a grass-legume mix with cocksfoot (Dactylis), ryegrass (Lolium) or with other legumes such as red clover, white clover or lucerne. Results have shown {{the choice of the}} variety is important. A variety like Esparcette, characterised by the highest condensed tannin content, may provide beneficial effects with a lower proportion in a mixture with other legumes. Preserving legumes, as silage, {{is a good way to}} provide an on-farm source of home-grown energy and protein, offers advantages over traditional haymaking, being less weather-dependent, and allows a high quality of forage during the harvesting period. In particular, wrapped silage bales of sainfoin have great potential in animal nutrition and can be used by farmers, as found that condensed tannin effects were not reduced by this mode of preservation.|$|E

In a pot experiment conducted in three series during the years 2010 – 2012, plants were cultivated as mixed and <b>pure</b> <b>crop</b> at higher (consistent with agronomic recommendations) and lower density, decreased by 20 % compared to it. Dry mass accumulation tests for both species were conducted during the following wheat growth stages (BBCH) : leaf development (12 – 14), tillering (21 – 23), stem elongation (31 – 32), inflorescence development (54 – 56), and ripening (87 – 89). Based on the results obtained, the biomass growth rate for both species in question was also determined. It was shown that the mass of shoots of spring wheat cultivated as mixed crop was {{lower than that of}} wheat shoots grown as <b>pure</b> <b>crop</b> during the stem elongation and ripening stages.

In case of both sowing methods and plant densities, the mass of wheat roots was similar. Biomass accumulation in Persian clover shoots and roots in mixed sowing was lower than in <b>pure</b> <b>crop</b> during the entire growing period.

Cereal crops grown in these mixtures tend to accumulate more protein in their grain. At the same time they extend their growing season. The traditional oat production system in Poland is based on covered oats grown with vetch on poor and damp soils. Our objective was to determine the grain yield and quality of a naked oat cultivar grown as a <b>pure</b> <b>crop</b> and with a spring vetch companion crop. The field experiment was conducted at the Czyrna Experimental Station from 1999 to 2002. The naked oat cv. Akt was sown either as a <b>pure</b> <b>crop</b> or with spring vetch determinate cv. Ina at two seed rates. The amount of rainfall over the experimental years varied from 737 to 1040 mm, corresponding with the multiannual average of 834 mm. The effect of graded seed rates of spring vetch on yield and gross chemical composition of naked oat grain (AOAC, 1995) and ?-glucans content (the Megazyme assay kit no 995. 16) were determined. The present results confirm earlier findings indicating that total yields of wheat and triticale grown with legume companion plants were decreased with decreasing cereal seeding rates (Pisulewska, 1997). Cereal grain protein content was increased with increasing seeding rates of legume companions. We confirmed the negative relationship between oat grain protein and fat content, while ash and ?-glucans were only little, although significantly affected. In conclusion, the relative changes in grain yield and quality of naked oat grown either as a <b>pure</b> <b>crop</b> or with a spring vetch companion plant, were similar to those observed for wheat and triticale.

40|$|Increasing {{population}} density and food {{needs in the}} Sahel are major drivers behind the conversion of land under natural vegetation to arable land. Intensification of agriculture is a necessity for farmers to produce enough food. As manure is scarce and fertilizers expensive, this study looks into the potential role of cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L.) and short duration fallow in maintaining soil fertility and productivity and in reducing the major weed problem Striga hermonthica (Del.) Benth. The research was carried out `on-farm¿ in a traditional millet (Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br.) growing area in the Malian Sahel, near Bankass. The four year experiment combined 0, 2, 5, and 7 years of preceding fallow with (i) 4 years of millet, (ii) 1 year of cowpea + 3 years of millet, and (iii) 1 year of cowpea + 3 years of millet/cowpea inter-cropping. Total millet production (4 years) was 1440 kg ha¿ 1 for all systems with 2, 5 or 7 years of preceding fallow against 1180 kg ha¿ 1 for systems without fallow. Cowpea grain production showed {{no significant differences between}} fallow treatments. Over 4 years, all cropping systems produced similar total amounts of millet grain, implying that the millet `lost¿ during the year with a pure cowpea crop in treatments (ii) and (iii) was compensated within three years, while the cowpea grain production was an additional benefit. Such compensation was however not observed for increasing number of preceding fallow years, showing that there is no additional production benefit in 5 ¿ 7 years of fallow as compared to 2 years.

40|$|Intercrops between legumes and non-legumes {{are widely}} used for fodder {{production}} and as cover crops, but little quantitative data are available on competition between species in the mixture. The objective {{of the present study}} was to assess the interaction between hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth.) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) grown as <b>pure</b> <b>crops</b> or intercrops with different proportions of seed rates at sowing. A 4 -year field study was conducted using hairy vetch and barley as pure stands at full sowing density and as intercrops at different proportions of their own full seed rate according to the replacement principle. Interaction between species was evaluated on the basis of Land Equivalent Ratio (LER), Relative Neighbour Effect (RNE) and Aggressivity (A) calculated on biomass and nitrogen (N) accumulation. The N accumulation of the mixed crops increased linearly with the legume proportion in the mixture. The mixtures were more efficient than the <b>pure</b> <b>crops</b> in terms of N use (LER > 1). Partial LER values indicated that the barley component benefited from the presence of the legume, while the hairy vetch partial LER decreased with increasing barley proportion in the mixture. The competitive response in terms of biomass accumulation was high for both species when their density in the mixture was high. Concerning N accumulation, barley benefited from an asymmetric interspecific facilitation while the vetch behaviour was similar to that observed for biomass accumulation. Barley dominance progressively increased reaching a maximum just before the last sampling date. At the last sampling date the competitive ability of hairy vetch showed a considerable increase in all mixtures (A ≈ 0). These findings indicate that the use of mixtures between hairy vetch and barley allows an increase in the use efficiency of N resource with respect to <b>pure</b> <b>crops.</b> Barley is the dominant component of the mixture and the hairy vetch is able to cope with the cereal competitive effect only at the end of the shooting phase of barley. Moreover when the soil N supply is high, the recovering ability of the vetch in the mixture could be strongly reduced. In such conditions, the proportion of legumes at sowing should be increased in order to counteract barley dominance and allow a late recovery of the legume component...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1996 In an {{agrisilviculture}} system, {{trees and}} crops compete for {{above and below}} ground resources. This study aimed at quantifying the effect of shoot pruning and root barriers around pollarded trees on the production of crop and tree components with and without application of fertilizer to the crop. Sorghum (1991 & 1992) and cowpea (1993 & 1994) were grown as intercrops with Lezicaena trees on a shallow red soil (alfisol) under rain fed conditions at Hyderabad, India. Crops grown with pruned trees had higher leaf area index and dry matter than did those with unpruned trees. The grain yield of sorghum was 76 % and 39 % of the <b>pure</b> <b>crop</b> yield (1553 kg ha⁻¹) with pruned and unpruned trees with no root barriers. The corresponding values for cowpea were 49 % and 26 % of the <b>pure</b> <b>crop</b> yield (1075 kg ha⁻¹). Intercropped sorghum and cowpea responded to fertilizer application more strongly than their respective pure crops, suggesting a need for fertilizer application in an agrisilvi-system. impact of root bamers was not significant on either crop. The study suggested that competition for light was stronger than for soil water. Straw and grain yield of sorghum, and dry matter yield of cowpea {{were found to be}} roughly proportional to the amount of light intercepted by the crop at harvest. Pruning of trees twice during the cropping season reduced tree diameter growth and branch and foliage yield compared to no pruning. Unpruned trees yielded 5643 kg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ of branches and foliage compared to 2028 kg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ by pruned trees. Pruning eliminated litter fall and nutrient input to the soil nutrient pool because pruned material was utilized as fodder. Unpruned trees contributed 103 kg of nitrogen and 6. 4 kg of phosphorus per hectare annually to the soil nutrient pool through litter fall. During the cropping season, soil water content was higher near the surface in tree plots compared to <b>pure</b> <b>crop</b> plots. Tree transpiration declined only after {{more than half of the}} leaf area was removed. Pruning of roots to a depth of 60 cm caused no decline in transpiration suggesting trees can draw water equally well from deeper or shallow soil layers. The study highlighted the competitive interaction between trees and crops. The agrisilvi-system produced about 50 % more biomass with unpruned trees than with <b>pure</b> <b>crop</b> or pure tree. Based on cash value (fodder yield equivalent) it would require 1. 55 times as much land if trees and crops were grown separately compared to agrisilvi-system with unpruned trees. Soil nitrogen economy and stability of fodder and fuelwood production can be achieved with pollarded-unpruned leucaena trees in an agrisilvi-system but grain crop yields are severely depressed. Thus, there was little advantage of the agrisilvi-system over pure cropping for meeting the present and increasing demand of food production. For this agrisilvi-system to be adopted by subsistence farmers in India further refinements must be developed so that crop yields are maintained...|$|E

In 2011, mixture number 3, recognized as being recommended for the forest steppe area and composed from Lotus corniculatus L.,Onobrychis viciifolia Scop., Dactylis glomerata L., Festuca pratensis Huds., Bromus inermis Leyss, presented the highest productions (4. 82 t·ha- 1) for the 60 N 70 P 2 O 5 and 120 N 70 P 2 O 5 kg·ha- 1 levels of fertilization...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} was to optimise the yield percentage of blue lupins in mixed cropping systems. Field experiments were conducted at two locations in Northern Germany (Institute of Organic Farming near Hamburg and Institute of Plant and Soil Science at Braunschweig). Two types of blue lupins, the determinate and branched type were cultivated together with spring barley, spring wheat or fodder peas in different seeding ratios (SR) : 50 % : 50 %, 62, 5 % : 37, 5 % and 75 % : 25 % of the respective <b>pure</b> <b>cropping</b> seeding rate. We present data on total grain yield, yield of blue lupins, yield percentage of blue lupins, protein content, and protein yield. Total grain yield decreased with increasing SR of blue lupins whereas, in contrast, the yield of blue lupins, protein content and protein yield increased. This shows the low competitive ability of blue lupins against the mixed cropping partners, particularly cereals. Therefore, the yield percentage of blue lupins in mixed cropping with cereals did not reach more than 25 %. From the view of plant production and the purpose of animal nutrition the percentage of grain legumes should be higher and comparable to those of other crop mixtures like peas with spring barley or beans with oat...|$|R
40|$|Reforestation of Presila di Cosenza: three {{conifers}} compared. A comparison {{was made}} between forestations of Atlas cedar, Douglas fir and Calabrian pine {{realized in the}} mid- 70 s {{of the last century}} with identical modalities and in the same station conditions, in the Presila of Cosenza. The results achieved by the plantations must be considered, according to their main aim that was concerned with the fulfilments of essentially protective tasks, definitely positive. The data relating the rates of take and mortality through the years confirm the great ability to colonise and to form thick and <b>pure</b> <b>crops</b> on behalf of the calabrian pine, while the incremental ones emphasise the Douglas fir as a species with a quicker growth. The densities does not allow, in the test areas, the regeneration to assert itself. Surveyings on the phytosanitary state of the forest stands do not evidence, in the test areas, symptoms of suffering, while the margin plants in the warm slopes of the pine-wood strongly turn out exposed to the processionary attacks. The more important requirement, for the investigated crops, is represented by the carrying-out of silvicultural cuttings, which aim at: regulating their thickness and structure, increasing their biological stability, creating favourable conditions for their renaturalization. </strong...|$|R
40|$|The study {{investigated}} the effects of maize-annual forage legume associations on maize and fodder production for 4 years in the subhumid zone of western Ethiopia. Lablab purpureus (lablab) and Vicia atropurpuria (vicia) were grown as <b>pure</b> <b>crops</b> or as intercrops in maize at 2 planting dates (simultaneous vs delayed 6 weeks) for 3 consecutive years (1994 – 1996) and pure maize was planted in all plots in the fourth year (1997). Intercropping signifi cantly (P 0. 05). Among the intercrops, simultaneous planting of lablab sig-nifi cantly (P 0. 05) grain, stover, forage DM or total fodder yields. Forage yield of lablab was signifi-cantly (P < 0. 05) {{higher than that of}} vicia, as both a monoculture and an intercrop planted simulta-neously with maize. Plots under lablab and vicia monocultures for the previous 3 years produced maize yields comparable with those on fertilised plots. Among intercrops, the residual effects of simultaneously planted lablab were (P < 0. 05) greater than for delayed planting. Grain yields following lablab were greater (P < 0. 05) than following vicia both as a monoculture and as a simultaneously planted intercrop. When planted as a monoculture or simultaneously planted inter-crop with maize, lablab appeared superior to vicia in terms of its ability to improve both feed supply and soil fertility...|$|R
40|$|Root {{competition}} for below-ground resources between edible plants may provide for long-term sustainability of agriculture systems. Intercropping {{can be more}} productive than a <b>pure</b> <b>crop</b> due to {{taking advantage of the}} morphological differences between species. In pure cropping, all biophysical interactions between plants occur through soil conditions. In intercropping, {{competition for}} water and nutrients is of major importance, but if the roots of one species occupy the zone just underneath the roots of the other crop, they can better use the resources of the root zone of the crop. The root system demonstrates a high degree of plasticity in its development in response to local heterogeneity of the soil profile and plant density. This study aimed at determining: (i) the morphological characteristics of the root systems of linseed, pea and vetch depending on the method of sowing; (ii) the root distribution in various soil types and at different soil profile depths (0 – 15 cm, 15 – 30 cm). Two three-year field experiments were conducted on two soil types in south Poland: soil A – Luvic Phaeozem (s 1) and soil B – Eutric Cambisol (s 2). These results show that linseed was more aggressive toward both legumes in mixture, but it produced lower yield compared to pure cropping. The environmental stress of plants in mixtures increased the relative weight of roots, which resulted in decreasing the root-shoot ratio (RSR) ...|$|E
40|$|Effect of sowing dates on the agronomic {{performance}} of the intercrops: Lagenaria siceraria (Molina) Standl. (Cucurbitaceae) and Manihot esculenta Crantz (Euphorbiaceae). Description of the subject. The intercropping system is a beneficial method, which is widely used in tropical areas for sustainable soil fertility management, and {{has been found to}} improve both the yields of traditional agriculture and the income of small producers. Objectives. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare and evaluate the effect of associated culture and pure culture of cucurbit Lagenaria siceraria creeping plant and the variety of cassava Manihot esculenta var. 'Bonoua Blanc' upright plant on the {{agronomic performance}} of each crop. Method. An experiment was established in randomized complete block design with three replicates per treatment. The treatments compared were firstly, associated crops M. esculenta var. 'Bonoua Blanc' / L. siceraria with cucurbit seedlings at 0 days (CAT 0), 15 days (CAT 15), 30 days (CAT 30) and 45 days (CAT 45) after cassava; secondly, pure cultures of cucurbit on the same dates as for associated crops (CPT 0, CPT 15, CPT 30 and CPT 45), and thirdly, a pure culture of cassava at 0 days (CP). Nine agronomic characteristics were analyzed in cucurbit and eight in cassava. Results. The agronomic parameters evaluated were the yield components of cassava, which varied with the increase in seedling time of cucurbit. However, the performance of cucurbit decreased with the increase in seedlings either in the associated crop or in pure culture. Performance also decreased sharply for the same sowing dates in pure culture. Despite high productivity when cucurbit was simultaneously planted with cassava, it remained low compared to the cucurbit <b>pure</b> <b>crop.</b> Conclusions. Intercropping of cucurbit L. siceraria and cassava M. esculenta was not found to be beneficial to the yield of the individual crops. However, the use of cucurbit as an intercropping cover crop helps to conserve soil moisture and to manage arable land and weeds for the benefit of cassava crops...|$|E
40|$|The {{question}} of "future grain {{supplies for the}} intensive animal industries " raises {{some of the most}} fundamental issues facing man. But the issues are not new; they must have been raised many times over the thousands of years of agriculture whenever food which could have been used by man was directed to livestock despite human need for it. But it is now being raised more and more insistently as increasing world populations and so food needs sensitize the world community to the actual or potential competition between man and animals for food. As a result a not uncommonly expressed view is thatanimal production, particularly based on grain, must be a diminishing and eventually insignificant component of world agriculture. Evidence and arguments in support of this view are ready to hand:- as mixtures of plant foods can supply all the energy and essential nutrients needed by man, except for vitamin B 12 which can be supplied by fermented plant matter, animal products are not essential in human diets; and the emerging high lysine grains make nutritionally adequate plant-based diets potentially easier to achieve. - as energy ("calories"), not protein (essential amino acids) is the first limiting factor in the diets of most chronically underfed people of the world and in famine, there is no special case for increasing production of animal products because of their high protein content and high quality of protein. - as at least 80 percent and usually much more of the energy of plant matter is lost in converting it to animal products, animal production is energetically inefficient and wasteful. - because of this, it is immoral to feed animals on grain or other materials which could be eaten by man. - animals play no vital or irreplaceable tole in the functioning of agro-ecosystems, as <b>pure</b> <b>crop</b> production systems can be highly productive. The view of a likely diminishing role of animal production can then seem to have good support. But let us evaluate the arguments. +This article is based on an invited theme address to a Conference o...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Perennial legumes, alfalfa, red clover, bird's foot trefoil, white clover, {{sainfoin}} and grasses, cock's foot, meadow fescue, tall fescue, Italian ryegrass, English ryegrass, French ryegrass, {{red fescue}} and Timothy grass {{can be grown}} successfully in <b>pure</b> <b>crops</b> and in legume-grass mixtures, on different soil types. Their importance in livestock development is based primarily on the great potential for yield of dry matter of over 20 t ha- 1 if adequate agro-technical measures have been applied. Also, perennial legumes are characterized with high content of nutritive substances, especially protein and represent the most important protein source in livestock nutrition. Depending on the species and pheno stage of utilization, the content of crude proteins in grasses varies from 100 to 174, 6 g kg- 1 of DM, and in perennial legumes from 190, 0 to 228, 8 g kg- 1 of DM. Livestock feed obtained from these plant species {{can be used in}} several ways, from grazing as most efficient and economical way, to preparation of hay and high quality silages and haylages. Stated forage species are very important in sustainable agriculture and organic production, considering that they carry out the process of biological fixation of nitrogen, but also from the ecological aspect. By using diverse selection/breeding material numerous domestic cultivars of perennial legumes and grasses have been created which are characterized with high potential for main agronomical traits...|$|R
40|$|The maize {{yields of}} two agronomic {{experiments}} conducted in The Ivory Coast are analyzed. These experiments compared pure maize or maize intercropped with peanut at {{high or low}} density and fertilization level, with good or bad weeding, and with or without insecticide protection against borers. Insecticide protection gave a significant yield increase of 22 - 36 % {{when compared to the}} control. Good weeding resulted in a yield increase of 11 and 28 % when compared with late weeding. The comparison between <b>pure</b> <b>crops</b> and intercrops at various levels of density-fertilization gave different results in each locality. In one case, {{there was no difference between}} these modalities; in the other instance, yields increased with the fertilizer level. The study of rainfall and of its influence on the yield components (plant sterility, grain number per cob-carrying plant, and average weight of grain) enabled us to explain this difference. No interaction between the various factors was noticed. It is concluded that when there is some hydric stress risk, cultivation at low density and fertilization should be preferred whereas in other cases, high densities and fertilizations would give better results. Use of herbicides and insecticides gives good profits when rain conditions are correct, but is of less interest when low-density fertilizing crops have to be recommended because of water stress risk...|$|R
40|$|Large {{concerns}} over the impact of climate change on agriculture in temperate countries have been raised recently. The current stagnation of agricultural yields {{for most of the}} major crops in Europe, but also in other temperate areas of the world, has been evidenced. Climate change may be a major explanation for this. Excess heat in spring and increased water stresses seem {{to be involved in the}} process. We discuss how alley-cropping systems may cope with such climate changes. We used the Hi-sAFe process-based agroforestry model to analyse the behaviour of some agroforestry systems with various climate change scenarii. The model integrates light, water and nitrogen competition in 3 D at the day time step, and allows for adaptive rooting patterns of treesand crops to cope with water and nitrogen heterogeneity in the soil. Walnut and poplar systems were simulated. The long-term resilience of the system was assessed by calculating indicators of the sustainability of crop yields. Intercrops exhibited a lower yield variability over time than <b>pure</b> <b>crops.</b> The Land Equivalent Ratio of the system was significantly increased with climate change. The model indicated that several processes were responsible for this : the reduction of heat shocks on cereal flowering and grain filling in the shade was expected, but the reduction of nitrogen stresses was more a surprise. However, the model would need to be upgraded to include several processes that are not implemented yet such as the windbreak effect. The model may also allow to optimise the sustainability of the system by adjusting the choice of tree and crop varieties...|$|R
