5|$|When John was nine, {{his father}} {{sent him to}} Hopkins Academy; the next year, the father took him out again, in <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> boy was in {{constant}} trouble and in <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> father had lost his fortune in the Panic of 1819.|$|E
5|$|However, the toad was {{generally}} unsuccessful {{in reducing the}} targeted grey-backed cane beetles (Dermolepida albohirtum), in <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> cane fields provided insufficient shelter for the predators during the day, in <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> beetles live at the tops of sugar cane – and cane toads are not good climbers. Since its original introduction, the cane toad has had a particularly marked effect on Australian biodiversity. The population {{of a number of}} native predatory reptiles has declined, such as the varanid lizards Varanus mertensi, V. mitchelli, and V. panoptes, the land snakes Pseudechis australis and Acanthophis antarcticus, and the crocodile species Crocodylus johnstoni; in contrast, the population of the agamid lizard Amphibolurus gilbertiknown to be a prey item of V. panopteshas increased.|$|E
5|$|There {{had been}} {{occasions}} when a President was incapacitated. For example, following Woodrow Wilson's stroke no one officially assumed the Presidential powers and duties, in <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> First Lady, Edith Wilson, {{together with the}} White House Physician, Cary T. Grayson, covered up President Wilson's condition.|$|E

5000|$|The {{church is}} next to the {{historic}} Granary Burying Ground. It had its first worship service on January 10, 1810. The church became known as [...] "Brimstone Corner", in <b>part</b> <b>because</b> of <b>the</b> fervent missionary character of its preaching, and in <b>part</b> <b>because</b> of <b>the</b> storage of gunpowder during the War of 1812.|$|R
2500|$|Pham {{claimed that}} [...] "she doubts whether she {{can ever be}} a {{critical}} care nurse again -- in <b>part</b> <b>because</b> of <b>the</b> emotional stress and anxiety over the trauma she experienced and in <b>part</b> <b>because</b> of <b>the</b> fear and stigma that follows her". She sued the hospital and settled for an undisclosed amount of money.|$|R
5|$|AML {{is treated}} {{initially}} with chemotherapy aimed at inducing remission; people may {{go on to}} receive additional chemotherapy or a hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Recent research into the genetics of AML {{has resulted in the}} availability of tests that can predict which drug or drugs may work best for a particular person, as well as how long that person is likely to survive. The treatment and prognosis of AML differ from those of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> cellular differentiation is not the same; AML involves higher percentages of dedifferentiated and undifferentiated cells, including more blasts (myeloblasts, monoblasts, and megakaryoblasts).|$|E
5|$|After the Dissolution of the Monasteries, and {{the closure}} of Vale Royal Abbey in 1538, St Padarn's Church regained its independence, though now solely as a parish church {{rather than as a}} {{religious}} community. The church remained important in <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> parish was {{one of the largest in}} Wales (over 240 square miles). However, although the Abbot of Vale Royal was no longer rector, the church did not recover the tithes, nor the ownership of the lands that had once belonged to the church.|$|E
5|$|Since 2010, {{ridership}} on the G {{has risen}} 17%, with approximately 150,000 riders per weekday in 2015. It is the route with {{the fastest growing}} ridership base in the entire system. These improvements will also have the side benefit {{of being able to}} accommodate the growing ridership base in gentrified neighborhoods along the G, like Park Slope, Carroll Gardens, Bedford-Stuyvesant, Williamsburg, Greenpoint, and Long Island City. This is due in <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> G weekday frequencies have become more dependable {{as a result of its}} 2013 review. However, weekend service was still lacking, according to some riders.|$|E

50|$|There {{are several}} {{published}} editions of <b>the</b> score, in <b>part</b> <b>because</b> of <b>the</b> {{two versions of}} the piece, and in <b>part</b> <b>because</b> of <b>the</b> transfer of copyright from Universal Edition to the Stockhausen-Verlag in the mid 1990s. Universal Edition refers to both versions of the work as No. 12, whereas the Stockhausen-Verlag distinguishes the electroacoustic version as No. 12½.|$|R

5|$|The road {{has long}} {{served as a}} de facto {{cultural}} dividing line between the predominantly poor black city and its wealthier, predominantly white northern suburbs. The perception of 8Mile as the chief dividing line between racial groups and classes persists, in <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> suburban counties of Oakland and Macomb remain, on the whole, significantly whiter and more prosperous than the city of Detroit. However, in recent years increasing numbers of whites have moved into Detroit, especially around the downtown area, and other neighborhoods {{in the region have}} become more ethnically diverse as well.|$|E
5|$|There is {{considerable}} {{uncertainty about the}} identities of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania between Traidenis' death in 1282 and Vytenis' assumption of power in 1295. This is in <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> two main sources for Lithuanian history in the 13th century, the Hypatian Codex and the Livonian Rhymed Chronicle, end in the early 1290s. In 1285, one chronicle mentions Daumantas as Grand Duke. He attacked the Bishop of Tver and was severely wounded or even killed in the battle. However, that is the only information about him.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, {{demand for}} a Scottish Parliament grew, in <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> {{government}} of the United Kingdom was controlled by the Conservative Party, while Scotland itself elected relatively few Conservative MPs. In {{the aftermath of the}} 1979 referendum defeat, the Campaign for a Scottish Assembly was initiated as a pressure group, leading to the 1989 Scottish Constitutional Convention with various organisations such as Scottish churches, political parties and representatives of industry taking part. Publishing its blueprint for devolution in 1995, the Convention provided much of the basis for the structure of the Parliament.|$|E

25|$|On 4 January 1984 a Cessna {{aircraft}} {{crashed into}} the sea after take-off from the airport. Three people were killed, although no bodies or the wreck were found, only <b>parts.</b> <b>Because</b> <b>the</b> airport was not manned {{at the time of}} the accident, it was not reported until fourteen hours after it occurred.|$|R
5|$|Although Susan Hayward was {{reported}} to be in the running for one of the two female leads, Julie Harris was chosen for the role of Eleanor Lance. Wise had seen Harris on stage, and felt she was right for the part of the psychologically fragile Eleanor. Harris agreed to do the film in <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> role was complex and the idea of the house taking over Eleanor's mind was interesting. But she also chose it because she had a long-standing interest in parapsychology. English actress Claire Bloom was cast as Theo. In part, however, the decision to cast Bloom and Johnson was because of Eady Levy requirements that the cast be partly British. To make Bloom's character appear more bohemian, beatnik clothing designer Mary Quant was hired to design mod clothing specifically for the Theodora character.|$|E
5|$|By 1944, {{by which}} time Norway was {{occupied}} by Germany {{as part of the}} Second World War, overhead wire had been installed on the Flåm Line. The locomotives at Thune and nearly completed, except for the transformers, which were at Per Kure. This was during the height of resistance sabotage, and workers at Per Kure had joined the communist resistance group Osvald. Because of the Allied bombing of Germany, Per Kure was thought to become part of a decentralized production chain and would be set to assemble aircraft engines. Osvald considered the plant a legitimate target and on 30 May 1944, the factory was blown up and the transformers severely damaged. Reconstruction of them took considerable time, {{in part because of the}} general lack of materials, and in <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> head engineer for the project disappeared during late 1944. In 1945, all three locomotives were sent to Myrdal Station for storage until the transformers were finished.|$|E
5|$|Catholic priests from Yucatán founded several mission towns around Lake Petén Itzá in 1702–1703. The first {{towns to}} be {{concentrated}} into colonial reducciones were Ixtutz, {{which became the}} new town of San José, and neighbouring San Andrés, both {{on the north shore}} of Lake Petén Itzá. They were first subjugated by one of Ursúa's officers, Cristobal de Sologaistoa, before being passed into the care of the Dominican friars for the Christian conversion of the inhabitants. Surviving Itza and Kowoj were resettled in the new colonial towns by a mixture of persuasion and force. Kowoj and Itza leaders in these mission towns rebelled against their Spanish overlords in 1704 and almost retook Nojpetén, but although well-planned, the rebellion was quickly crushed. Its leaders were executed, and most of the mission towns were abandoned; by 1708 only about 6,000 Maya remained in central Petén. The reductions failed in large <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> missionaries charged with converting the inhabitants could not speak the Itza language.|$|E
50|$|In 1947, he {{accepted}} {{an offer to}} return to Chicago, where (in <b>part</b> <b>because</b> of <b>the</b> university's involvement in the Manhattan Project, and in <b>part</b> <b>because</b> of <b>the</b> administrative efforts of Marshall Stone) many other famous mathematicians and physicists had also recently moved. He traveled as a Guggenheim Fellow to ETH Zurich for the 1947-1948 term, where he worked with Heinz Hopf. Mac Lane succeeded Stone as department chair in 1952, and served for six years.|$|R
50|$|Nine verbs {{also have}} an {{irregular}} subjunctive stem, used {{at least for the}} singular and third plural of the present subjunctive. These verbs can be said to have 11 principal <b>parts,</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> subjunctive stem {{may or may not be}} used for the first and second plural present subjunctive, the imperative and/or the present participle, in ways that vary from verb to verb.|$|R
2500|$|Argent (Ger. Weiss) is {{similarly}} {{derived from the}} Latin argentum, [...] "silver". [...] Although sometimes depicted as metallic silver or faint grey, it is more often represented by white, in <b>part</b> <b>because</b> of <b>the</b> tendency for silver paint to oxidize and darken over time, and in <b>part</b> <b>because</b> of <b>the</b> pleasing effect of white against a contrasting colour. [...] Notwithstanding {{the widespread use of}} white for argent, some heraldic authorities have suggested the existence of white as a distinct heraldic colour.|$|R
5|$|Cuarón {{wanted to}} do {{tracking}} shots, in <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> producers wanted to film it like an IMAX-style Discovery Channel documentary. Like his previous films, Emmanuel Lubezki did not use prior footage {{as the starting point}} of his work on Gravity. Instead, he carried out a search of images from NASA and Roscosmos. He and his team put together a large collection of photographs and picked what was best for the movie. Lubezki said that they based the visuals on descriptions from astronauts, with some artistic license in depicting how the stars looked during the daytime in space. He wanted to incorporate the stars as much as possible to feel as deep as possible and avoid plain darkness and two dimensional feeling.|$|E
5|$|During the First World War, Queen Mary instituted an {{austerity}} {{drive at}} the palace, where she rationed food, and visited wounded and dying servicemen in hospital, which caused her great emotional strain. After {{three years of}} war against Germany, and with anti-German feeling in Britain running high, the Russian Imperial Family, which had been deposed by a revolutionary government, was refused asylum, possibly in <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> Tsar's wife was German-born. News of the Tsar's abdication provided a boost to those in Britain who wished to replace their own monarchy with a republic. The war ended in 1918 with the defeat of Germany and the abdication and exile of the Kaiser.|$|E
5|$|During {{the annual}} fleet {{maneuvers}} in SeptemberOctober 1907, Lepanto was present to carry {{observers of the}} exercises, though she did not directly {{take part in the}} training. At the start of the Italo-Turkish War of 191112, Lepanto was assigned to the 5th Division of the Italian fleet, along with her sister Italia and the ironclad Enrico Dandolo. In December 1911, Lepanto and Italia were sent to Tripoli, replacing the three s, to support the Italian garrison that had captured the city. The two Italias were sent in large <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> Italian Navy had a large stockpile of 17-inch shells. Lepanto was stricken on 26 May 1912, but was reinstated on 13 January 1913 as a first-class auxiliary ship. She was stricken a second time on 15 January 1914, sold for scrap on 27 March 1915, and subsequently broken up.|$|E
50|$|This case is important, in <b>part,</b> <b>because</b> of <b>the</b> Court's {{decision}} not to grant deference to the jury's determination that the defendants' confessions were voluntary.|$|R
50|$|Far fewer {{surgeons}} perform BPD {{compared to}} other weight loss surgeries, in <b>part</b> <b>because</b> of <b>the</b> need for long-term nutritional follow-up and monitoring of BPD patients.|$|R
50|$|The {{project was}} financed as a private-public partnership, {{established}} in 1990. The ambitious {{program has been}} delayed in <b>part</b> <b>because</b> of <b>the</b> mid-1990s real-estate market crisis.|$|R
5|$|Exton {{submitted}} {{his report}} to Madeleine's Fund in November 2008, but the fund told Exton {{that the report}} and its e-fits had to remain confidential. The relationship between {{the company and the}} fund had soured, in part because of a dispute over fees, and in <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> report was critical of the McCanns and their friends; it suggested that Madeleine may have died in an accident after leaving the apartment herself through its unlocked patio doors. The fund passed the e-fits to the police—the Polícia Judiciária and Leicestershire police had them by October 2009, and Scotland Yard received them when they became involved in August 2011—but did not otherwise release them. Kate McCann did not include them with the other images of suspects in her book, Madeleine (2011), although she suggested that both the Tanner and Smith sightings were crucial.|$|E
5|$|Falling attendances {{due to the}} {{commercial}} nature of the district, and also a sense {{that there was some}} redundancy of provision given the nearby St Matthew's Church, caused the Manchester diocese to review the status of St John's and its parish in the 1920s. Following an internal review and a public consultation, in 1927 it was formally proposed that the two parishes should be merged as St Matthew's parish. The diocese preferred to retain St Matthew's and demolish St John's, at least in <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> former was a more recent construction. This was a reversal of a proposal made in 1919, when the predominantly transient Roman Catholic population of the St Matthew's parish was given as a reason to merge it into St John's.|$|E
5|$|In 1905, Italia {{went into}} drydock {{for a major}} {{reconstruction}} that lasted into 1908. Her six funnels were reduced to four, and a second mast was erected. One of her 5.9in guns, six of the 57mm guns, and eight of the 37mm revolver cannon were removed. After returning to service in 1909, she served as a torpedo training ship; she served in this capacity through 1910. At {{the start of the}} Italo-Turkish War of 191112, Italia was assigned to the 5th Division of the Italian fleet, along with her sister Lepanto and Enrico Dandolo. In December 1911, Italia and Lepanto were sent to Tripoli, replacing the three s, to support the Italian garrison that had captured the city. The two ships were sent in large <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> Italian Navy had a large stockpile of 17in shells.|$|E
500|$|The largest part of {{the heart}} is usually {{slightly}} offset {{to the left side}} of the chest (though occasionally it may be offset to the right) and is felt to be on <b>the</b> left <b>because</b> <b>the</b> left heart is stronger and larger, since it pumps to all body <b>parts.</b> <b>Because</b> <b>the</b> heart is between the lungs, the left lung is smaller than the right lung and has a cardiac notch in its border to accommodate the heart.|$|R
50|$|In 1990 the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) was passed, {{in great}} <b>part</b> <b>because</b> of <b>the</b> {{national}} {{recognition that the}} Zuni’s efforts had received.|$|R
50|$|Several {{asbestos}} trusts {{have expressed}} strong opposition to this legislation, in <b>part</b> <b>because</b> of <b>the</b> burdensome administrative costs that will significantly reduce recoveries for future trust claimants.|$|R
