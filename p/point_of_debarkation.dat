60|$|There {{is a long}} {{tongue of}} land from the Louisiana side {{extending}} towards Grand Gulf, made by the river running nearly east from about three miles above and nearly {{in the opposite direction}} from that point for about the same distance below. The land was so low and wet that {{it would not have been}} practicable to march an army across but for a levee. I had had this explored before, as well as the east bank below to ascertain if there was a possible <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>debarkation</b> north of Rodney. It was found that the top of the levee afforded a good road to march upon.|$|E
60|$|Considerable {{correspondence}} {{took place}} {{in relation to the}} formation and constitution of the pioneer force, concerning which the General’s opinion was overruled by that of his excellency the Governor. The following extract from memorandum of September 8th fully shows this: “I concluded that I should receive some formal and definite information of any change in his excellency’s views or plans, and I was therefore not prepared to learn from Colonel Marriott, when the expedition was nearly ready to proceed, that his Excellency had decided to submit entirely to Colonel Merewether the responsible duty of determining finally the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>debarkation,</b> and of converting the reconnoissance into an occupation of the coast by a body of about 1500 men. Of all the various circumstances which may have led his Excellency to this conclusion, I am not fully informed; but I entertain strong objections to the question being left entirely to Colonel Merewether’s decision,—he being, in compliance with his Excellency’s opinion (expressed in his Excellency’s note to Colonel Marriott), in military command of the party,—because, while concurring entirely with his Excellency in his high estimation of that officer, it has seemed to me that Colonel Merewether has strong preconceived opinions in favour of a line of route which from the most recent reports, especially that of M. Munsinger, appears to me to be one that would be dangerous {{to the success of the}} expedition, and that his selection of a <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>debarkation</b> will be sensibly influenced by such very strong and sincere opinions.” Sir Robert Napier’s protest was attended to, and other officers were associated with Colonel Merewether; but this extract is sufficient to show how much was done by the Governor of Bombay without the concurrence or even consultation of Sir Robert Napier.|$|E
60|$|This {{interruption}} in my communications north--I {{was really}} {{cut off from}} communication with {{a great part of}} my own command during this time --resulted in Sherman's moving from Memphis before McClernand could arrive, for my dispatch of the 18th did not reach McClernand. Pemberton got back to Vicksburg before Sherman got there. The rebel positions were on a bluff on the Yazoo River, some miles above its mouth. The waters were high so that the bottoms were generally overflowed, leaving only narrow causeways of dry land between <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>debarkation</b> and the high bluffs. These were fortified and defended at all points. The rebel position was impregnable against any force that could be brought against its front. Sherman could not use one-fourth of his force. His efforts to capture the city, or the high ground north of it, were necessarily unavailing.|$|R

60|$|About {{eight o'clock}} we started from the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>debarkation,</b> marching by the flank. After moving {{in this way}} for a mile or {{a mile and a}} half, I halted where there was marshy ground covered with a heavy growth of timber in our front, and {{deployed}} a large part of my force as skirmishers. By this time the enemy discovered that we were moving upon Belmont and sent out troops to meet us. Soon after we had started in line, his skirmishers were encountered and fighting commenced. This continued, growing fiercer and fiercer, for about four hours, the enemy being forced back gradually until he was driven into his camp. Early in this engagement my horse was shot under me, but I got another from one of my staff and kept well up with the advance until the river was reached.|$|E
60|$|While King Harold {{was thus}} {{advancing}} to meet them, Tostig and his Norwegian allies entered the River Humber. Their object was {{to reach the}} city of York, which had been Tostig's former capital, and which was situated near the River Ouse, {{a branch of the}} Humber. They accordingly ascended the Humber to the mouth of the Ouse, and thence up the latter river to a suitable <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>debarkation</b> not far from York. Here they landed and formed a great encampment. From this encampment they advanced to the siege of the city. The inhabitants made some resistance at first; but, finding that their cause was hopeless, they offered to surrender, and a treaty of surrender was finally concluded. This negotiation was closed toward the evening of the day, and Tostig and his confederate forces were to be admitted on the morrow. They therefore, feeling that their prize was secure, withdrew to their encampment for the night, and left the city to its repose.|$|E
60|$|The two adventurers put {{off from}} Rancocus Island just at dark, and paddled in the {{direction}} that they believed would carry them to the Peak. It will be remembered that the last could not {{be seen from the}} ocean, until about half the passage between the islands was made, though it was plainly apparent from the heights of Rancocus, as already mentioned. Next morning, when day returned, the smoke of the volcano was in sight, but no Peak. There is little question that the canoe had been set too much to the southward, and was diagonally receding from its desired <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>debarkation,</b> instead of approaching it. Towards the smoke, Unus and his sister continued to paddle, and, after thirty-six hours of nearly unremitted labour, they succeeded in landing at the volcano, ignorant of its nature, awe-struck and trembling, but compelled to seek a refuge there, as the land-bird rests its tired wing on the ship's spars, when driven from the coast by the unexpected gale. When discovered, Peggy and her brother were about to take a fresh start from their resting-place, the Peak being visible from the volcano.|$|E

6000|$|... "It {{appears to}} me, sir, {{that the success}} of this {{expedition}} depends altogether upon {{the manner in which it}} is conducted." [...] After this lucid opening, the soldier hesitated a moment, as if to collect his ideas for a charge that should look down all opposition, and proceeded. [...] "The landing, of course, will be effected on a fair beach, under cover of the frigate's guns, and could it be possibly done, the schooner should be anchored in such a manner as to throw in a flanking fire on the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>debarkation.</b> The arrangements for the order of march must a good deal depend on the distance to go over; though I should think, sir, an advanced party of seamen, to act as pioneers for the column of marines, should be pushed a short distance in front, while the baggage and baggage-guard might rest upon the frigate, until the enemy was driven into the interior, when it could advance without danger. There should be flank-guards, under the orders of two of the oldest midshipmen; and a light corps might be formed of the topmen to co-operate with the marines. Of course, sir, Mr. Griffith will lead, in person, the musket- men and boarders, armed with their long pikes, whom I presume he will hold in reserve, as I trust my military claims and experience entitle me to the command of the main body." ...|$|E
60|$|The unknown mariner ceased speaking, for the {{situation}} of the periagua, was truly getting to be a little critical. At least so it seemed to the less-instructed landsmen, who were witnesses of this unexpected rencontre. As the ferry-boat had drawn in with the island, the wind hauled more through the pass which communicates with the outer bay, and it became necessary to heave about, twice, in order to fetch to windward of the usual landing-place. The first of these manoeuvres had been executed, and as it necessarily changed their course, the passengers saw that the cutter to which the stranger alluded was enabled to get within-shore of them; or nearer to the wharf, where they ought to land, than they were themselves. Instead of suffering himself to be led off by a pursuit, that he knew might easily be rendered useless, the officer who commanded this boat cheered his men, and pulled swiftly to the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>debarkation.</b> On the other hand, a second cutter, which had already reached the line of the periagua's course, lay on its oars, and awaited its approach. The unknown mariner manifested no intention to avoid the interview. He still held the tiller, and as effectually commanded the little vessel as if his authority were of a more regular character. The audacity and decision of his air and conduct, aided by the consummate mariner in which he worked the boat, might alone have achieved this momentary usurpation, had not the general feeling against impressment been so much in his favor.|$|E

50|$|On April 4, 1863 Colonel William Averill and his 3rd Pennsylvania Cavalry {{were sent}} to reconnoiter Ship Point’s {{garrison}} and defenses. When he returned that evening he reported that the place was abandoned and there were enough barracks for 3000 soldiers. General McClellan had particular interest in Ship Point. It is apparent from his reports {{that he was going}} to attempt to take Ship Point by force had it not already been abandoned by the Confederates. In his April 5 report he mentioned that Ship Point had been turned and was in control of his cavalry. Ship Point was to serve the Union army in three ways. They used it as a supply depot, a <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>debarkation,</b> and as a hospital. Ship Point figured highly in the General McClellan's plan to seize Yorktown. Troops would travel by ship from Alexandria to Fort Monroe then on to Ship Point where they would be marched to the Union lines in Yorktown.|$|E
5000|$|Significant {{emigration}} from Ireland to the United States {{occurred during}} the period 1810 - 1850, with a particularly large wave to New Orleans during {{the decade of the}} 1830s. The <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>debarkation</b> was Adele Street, where many immigrants, penniless, took up residence in simple cottages, providing the beginnings of today's shotgun houses. These Irish immigrants arrived primarily to dig the New Basin Canal, and were generally regarded as expendable labor. [...] Many of these immigrants were misled by shipping companies who led prospective immigrants to believe that New Orleans was close to other Irish enclaves in the United States such as New York City, Philadelphia, and Boston. New Orleans subsequently had the largest Irish population in the American South. These Irish immigrants were predominantly Roman Catholic, in contrast to the Protestant Irish that were more common as immigrants to {{most of the rest of}} the Southeastern United States. [...] In addition to the Irish Channel, many Irish immigrants also settled at Irish Bayou, in present-day Eastern New Orleans.|$|E
50|$|The real city of Sacramento was {{developed}} around a wharf, called the Embarcadero, on {{the confluence of}} the American River and Sacramento River that Sutter had developed prior to his retirement in 1849 as a result of gold discoveries at Sutter's Mill in Coloma. John Sutter, Sr. had replaced himself with his son, John Sutter, Jr., who noticed growth of trade at the Embarcadero and considered it a viable economic opportunity; the port was used increasingly as a <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>debarkation</b> for prospecting Argonauts heading eastwards. Sutter, Jr. had military officials William H. Warner and his assistant, William Tecumseh Sherman, survey his father's holdings for a location where he could establish a new city and create the city over a grid of numbered and lettered streets for organizational purposes. A number of businessmen, including millionaire-to-be Samuel Brannan, future California governor Peter Burnett, and George McDougall, brother of future California governor John McDougall, were attracted to the waterfront location. However, Sutter, Jr. and George McDougall disagreed over the terms of the lease of the location, and a trade war erupted between Sutter's Sacramento City and McDougall's new base of operations at Sutterville. Sutter, Sr., who had opposed many of his son's decisions, resumed control of his business affairs after Sutter, Jr. ended the competition between the two cities; trade in the area was biased toward Sacramento City as a result of Sutter, Jr.'s efforts.|$|E
