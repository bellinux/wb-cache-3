As reasons for applying inappropriate methods, performing incomplete evaluations, or even entirely omitting justifications, the special nature of Data Warehousing benefits and the large portion of infrastructure-related activities are stated. In this paper, the economic justification of Data Warehousing projects is analyzed, and first results from a large academiaindustry collaboration project in the field of non-technical issues of Data Warehousing are presented. As conceptual foundations, the role of the Data Warehouse system in corporate application architectures is analyzed, and the specific properties of Data Warehousing projects are discussed. Based on an applicability analysis of traditional approaches to economic IT <b>project</b> <b>justification,</b> basic steps and responsibilities for the justification of Data Warehousing projects are derived. 1...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to assess the current use being made of the {{sustainability}} message within business improvement activity and <b>project</b> <b>justification</b> within individual businesses. Design/methodology/approach – This is a reflective paper that looks at an illustrative case study against the wider perspectives of Lean Six Sigma (LSS) implementation, market orientation and business improvement initiatives in general. Findings – The piece discusses the gains derived from the LSS projects and identifies gaps in potential benefits in particular the paper questions how well any potential marketing messages were exploited by the organisation. The findings critically evaluates the impact that marketing function involvement could have in helping to promote the wider productivity message and its contribution to the wider corporate social responsibility (CSR) strategy for the organisation. The document also suggests how the company could leverage internally focused projects to adopt a companywide marketing orientation and use such leverage to support future LSS project selection and justification. Research limitations/implications – The observations are limited to a single case study, although tempered by the authors’ wider experience. Further empirical research is required to validate the observations and conclusions. Practical implications – The proposed approach to future improvement initiatives can help to increase the wider productivity message and assist organisations to exploit their internal projects in external communications and wider CSR strategy.

30|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a comprehensive approach}} to enhance the traditionally deterministic-based power grid planning using system well-being analysis concept. The objective is to identify and characterize the existing system reliability concerns inherited from the adopted deterministic criteria, so that power utilities can accordingly adjust their reliability criteria to cope with real-life system uncertainties and hence to enhance the overall system reliability. A determination of transmission capacity reserve derived from incorporating deterministic criteria into a probabilistic framework has been introduced in the paper. An application of the proposed methodology for justifying a transmission addition project to accommodate the system load growth is illustrated by using an actual island power grid. Both technical and economic aspects, greatly concerned in practice, have been taken into consideration in the <b>project</b> <b>justification.</b>|$|E

The most critical problem, chronic steam leakage from the turbine and subsequent oil system contamination, was corrected by the installation of noncontacting spiral groove seals. In addition, vibration problems caused by coupling lockup and subsequent premature coupling failure were solved by replacing the grease lubricated gear type coupling with a nonlubricated flexible coupling. A feature of the coupling is a keyed hub, designed for hydraulic removal. The turbine was sensitive to minor upsets and a rotordynamics study was done. The coupling and seal changes were both done at the same time.

40|$|AbstractResponding {{to growing}} {{international}} political {{interest in the}} potential of {{carbon capture and storage}} (CCS) to contribute to climate change mitigation, multiple CCS demonstration projects of various scales are emerging globally. A fully integrated power-plant with CCS has not yet been demonstrated at scale, and acknowledgement of the scale of learning that still must occur for the technology to advance toward deployment has resulted in calls from multiple constituents for more CCS demonstration projects. Among these demonstration projects, expectations for learning and knowledge-sharing structures vary considerably and attention to different approaches to facilitate learning has been minimal. Through a comparison of the structure, framing and socio-political context of three different CCS demonstration projects, this paper explores the complexity of social learning associated with demonstration projects. Variety in expectations of the demonstration projects’ objectives, learning processes, information sharing mechanisms, public engagement initiatives, financing and collaborative partnerships are highlighted. The comparison shows that multiple factors influence the learning in CCS demonstration projects, including the process of building support for the project, the governance context and the framing of the <b>project</b> <b>justification.</b> This comparative analysis highlights the importance of integrating careful consideration of framing and social learning into CCS demonstration project planning...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{the papers in}} this special issue and uses them as evidence through which to examine four questions. First: are we witnessing a widespread (re) turn to big infrastructure projects for water management? The evidence suggests that large-scale infrastructure development has remained largely unswayed by the 'ecological turn', or the promotion of demand management or 'soft path' thinking, despite a drop in investments observed {{at the turn of}} the 20 th century. Second: do these new <b>projects</b> have different <b>justifications</b> from those of the past? The papers in this issue provide evidence that the need to justify capital-intensive infrastructure in the face of commitments to sustainability, while borrowing from the conventional grammar of <b>project</b> <b>justifications,</b> has generated a few innovative tropes and rhetorical devices. Third: what does a (re) turn (or enduring commitment) to big infrastructure tells us about the governance and wider politics of large-scale infrastructure problems? Some of the traditional interest groups are well represented in the stories told here – the corporations that demand water or compete to build pipes and dams; the large-scale irrigators that rely on water to expand their production; the engineers and consultants who seek money, prestige, career advancement or even satisfaction from 'controlling' nature; the politicians who can extract 'rents' from all this activity. Even so, the history of each particular project involves many contingencies – of the society’s history, of previous rounds of infrastructure and of capital availability. Fourth: have there been changes in the scale at which water is managed within countries? In general, it seems there has been an increase in the scale of projects, generally involving a shift in power away from regional and up to multi-regional agencies of governance, such as the central state. Sometimes these shifts in scale and power have no effect on the salience of local voices – because in the past they were never heard or generally suppressed anyway. Sometimes the shifts in power and scale have been accompanied by increasing suppression of local voices of opposition.

40|$|Cost-benefit {{analysis}} has a considerable literature in which information {{systems have been}} patently ignored. This reflects the considerable difficulties of applying the theory to information systems, and the state-of-the art remains relatively as Koopmans described it some 19 years ago (1957).

This paper seeks to clarify the issues and provide a robust theoretical and data analysis framework that will cover most situations. The approach here is to separate explicitly the dimensions of cost from those of information benefit, and examine the implications. The Null Information Benefit condition emerges as a special theoretical case, but potentially a most important one in applications. This case together with the Pareto optimum defines a large class of such problems that can be handled by the decision criteria and data analysis techniques tabulated and discussed here. The selection of input data techniques defines the limits of later <b>project</b> <b>justification</b> and may be crucial to the political viability of the projects throughout its life.

40|$|This study explores {{and seeks}} to explain the EIA {{procedures}} practice gap in Lao PDR. It reviews the literature and studies EIA legislation, administrative procedures, guidelines, and relevant documents by using a model proposed by Leu et al. (1996) and applying criteria proposed by Wood (1995) to evaluate the performance of EIA systems. Key EIA legislation in Lao PDR has many strengths, but also major weaknesses: Inadequate planning procedures, no secondary regulations, few trained and skilled personnel, inadequate public consultation, lack of environmental data, weak follow-up and monitoring, and no enforcement machinery. Additionally, the EIA approval procedure is very bureaucratic and easily derailed by political and economic pressures. In addition, coordination among EIA proponents, consultants, concerned ministries, local authorities, planners, and decision-makers is generally weak. This delays decision-making and hinders implementation of environmental regulations. Thus, procedures and evaluation are not always performed well. EIAs are more a <b>project</b> <b>justification</b> tool than a project planning tool for sustainable development. We conclude with recommendations to strengthen the system, such as improving capacity building, implementing an EIA consultants’ accreditation system, ensuring effective public participation and access to EIA reports, applying systematic EIAs, reviewing criteria, and promoting environmental awareness. </p...|$|E

The excursions of high vibration restricted the operational load performance of the turbine. The cause of the vibration {{was determined to be}} a 'rotor instability,' identified as a subsynchronous vibration in the form of steam whirl of the rotor. This whirling excites a rotor critical speed resulting in a very unstable rotor system. The instability could lead to destructive levels of vibration. A rotordynamics model of the rotor-bearing-support system was developed. Then, using the computer model, a stability analysis was performed and the sensitivity of the instability was evaluated for various system parameters (such as seals, rotors, and bearings). Numerous possible solutions were investigated, of which two exhibited significant increases in the stability of the system. First, a? newly designed rotor and second, replacing the rotor interstage labyrinth seals with honeycomb seals. The latter had a high probability of success and a greatly reduced capital cost.

40|$|Software project {{escalation}} {{has been}} shown to be a widespread phenomenon. With few exceptions, prior research has portrayed escalation as an irrational decision-making process whereby additional resources are plowed into a failing project. In this article, we examine the possibility that in some cases managers escalate their commitment not because they are acting irrationally, but rather as a rational response to real options that may be embedded in a project. A project embeds real options when managers have the opportunity but not the obligation to adjust the future direction of the project in response to external or internal events. Examples include deferring the project, switching the project to serve a different purpose, changing the scale of the project, implementing it in incremental stages, abandoning the project, or using the project as a platform for future growth opportunities. Although real options can represent a substantial portion of a project’s value, they rarely enter into a <b>project’s</b> formal <b>justification</b> process in the traditional quantitative discounted cash-flow-based project valuation techniques.

Much of this funding has come through the Federal Transit Administration's (FTA) New Starts Program, which helps pay for rail, bus, and trolley projects. The Transportation Equity Act for the 21 st Century authorized about $ 6 billion in "guaranteed" funding for the New Starts program through fiscal year 2003. FTA's evaluation process assigns candidate projects individual ratings for <b>project</b> <b>justification</b> and local financial commitments. The process also assigns an overall rating intended to reflect the project's merit. FTA recommended four projects for funding commitments for fiscal year 2003 in its New Starts report and budget proposal.

" Although FTA has faced transit budget crunches for years, the agency will end the act's authorization period with $ 310 million in unused commitment authority. Proposals to limit the amount of New Starts funds would allow more projects to receive such funding, but could harm specific projects being developed and the local transportation planning process. For example, limiting New Starts funds to 60 percent of a project's cost for the 49 projects now in final design or preliminary engineering would "free up" $ 500 million for additional projects.

FTA was directed to prioritize projects for funding by evaluating, rating, and recommending potential projects on the basis of specific financial and <b>project</b> <b>justification</b> criteria. This report discusses (1) the refinements made to FTA's evaluation and rating process since last year, (2) how New Starts projects were selected for FTA's New Starts report and budget request for fiscal year 2002, and (3) FTA's remaining New Starts commitment authority. GAO found that FTA made several refinements to its rating process. For instance, potential grantees were more strictly assessed on their ability to build and operate proposed projects than in the past. FTA also made several technical changes and established new performance measures to evaluate the program. New Starts projects were selected by evaluating 40 new projects for 2002 and developing ratings for 26 of them. FTA then determined whether the projects rated "highly recommended" or "recommended" met its readiness criteria. Of these projects, FTA recommended four of them for funding commitments. FTA also recommended three additional projects [...] one that was exempt from the rating process and two that were rated last year. FTA reports that it will have limited authority to make funding commitments to new projects in fiscal year 2003 if it enters into the seven New Starts grant agreements in 2002 as proposed. ...|$|E
40|$|Currently, {{there is}} a {{tendency}} of transition to the long-term cycles of operation with fuel and to the new transitional modes. This fact requires extra experimental validation for design of fuel rods. New operating conditions are expanding operability requirements of claddings. To implement the experimental techniques the Mechanical Loading Device (MLD) was developed, capable of providing the conditions of stress-strain state similar to the pellet-cladding interaction (PCI) during operation of the reactor. Complex strain state of a fuel rod cladding is simulated by the impacting force on the plunger and then on the simulator of the fuel pellet. The simulator is made of interposer of zirconium and the inset made of ceramic - aluminum oxide. Mechanical properties of the aluminum oxide are similar to the material of the fuel pellet - uranium dioxide. Experiments conducted on the layout and the MLD as such have shown that a stress-strain state matches with that of under operating conditions of the fuel rod in the reactor. The developed device and test method allows us to simulate a wide range of reactor transient modes. Claddings can be used both in the delivered state, and with the further preparation, including the exposure in nuclear reactor. MLD design enables us to carry out experiments with the presence of an aggressive environment inside the cladding, simulating the presence of gaseous fission products in the fuel rod. For further the development of this research it is necessary to design the laboratory complex for MLD. Extra computational verification experiment is needed as well. In particular, stresses in the cladding achieved during the experiment ought to be calculated. Calculated stresses are required to make <b>project</b> <b>justification</b> on the performance capability of fuel rods. </p...|$|E
5000|$|Urban renewal, the {{redevelopment}} of areas within large cities, including white flight, {{has also been}} a factor in the growth patterns of African-American neighborhoods. The process began an intense phase in the late 1940s and continues in some places to the present day. It has had a major impact on the urban landscape. Urban renewal was extremely controversial because it involved the destruction of businesses, the relocation of people, and the use of eminent domain to reclaim private property for city-initiated development <b>projects.</b> The <b>justifications</b> often used for urban renewal include the [...] "renewal" [...] of residential slums and blighted commercial and industrial areas. In {{the second half of the}} 20th century, renewal often resulted in the creation of urban sprawl and vast areas of cities being demolished and replaced by freeways and expressways, housing projects, and vacant lots, some of which still remain vacant at the beginning of the 21st century. Urban renewal had a disproportionate and largely negative impact on African-American neighborhoods. In the 1960s James Baldwin famously dubbed urban renewal [...] "Negro Removal".|$|R
40|$|Escalation stickins with {{an ailing}} <b>project</b> beyond {{rational}} <b>justifications.</b> This happens {{because in the}} face of negative feedback, decision makers are strangled between whether to stick with or quit the dying project. Environmental uncertainty has been identified as the root cause of the escalatory behavior. This uncertainty emanates from several sources relating to individual, group, organization and broader environmental factors. This paper argues the premise that effective communication can help create an environment whereby workforce can develop an organized action thereby distributing the responsibility across the whole workforce and not the individuals – leading to the possible reduction of escalatory behavior in IT projects...|$|R
40|$|Devo IT and its {{subsidiary}} SoftRobot AB {{are planning}} to offer a new service to its clients to further enhance growth of the company. This new service is a website that allows clients to upload documents that are converted into machine-editable text. The website and its underlying database are developed by SoftRobot's developer, but they lack the hardware. Using Cisco's PPDIOO network life cycle model, the three first stages of the project are identified. The "prepare" stage is already done by Devo IT where the <b>project's</b> <b>justifications</b> are discussed. In the subsequent "planning" stage, {{the needs of the}} project, are identified and a gap analysis is made of what is needed. The "design" phase elaborates which specific hardware and software is needed for the project. Three servers are needed, one for the main web server, a second for the database, and a third as a cache server for relieving the load on the database. These are planned as virtual machines, {{so that they can be}} located on the same physical machine and easily moved if necessary. The disk space required for the database is calculated with test documents since the average document size, the number of clients and how much they upload is known. Disks with adequate size can therefore be chosen. Different ways of improving performance and lowering failure rate of the disks are discussed with the means of RAID levels. These levels improve both disks reliability and performance in different ways. RAID 10 is designated for the database and RAID 1 for the web server and the caching server since those levels are the most suited for these applications. CPU and memory requirements are chosen based on availability and cost. Network bandwidth is analyzed and confirmed as sufficient with the help of the test database and since the bottleneck would be the CPU converting the uploaded documents. Software for backup and administration of the virtual machines are chosen comparing their functionality and the requirements for the project and their cost. After the hardware needs are identified, an cost analysis is made between hosting in Devo IT's server room or outsourcing it to an external company. It was revealed, as Devo IT suspected, that outsourcing costs more. The results of this thesis enables Devo IT to create a service with good quality, which will meet the clients expectations and also make Devo IT grow as a company with new clients and increased revenue...|$|R
