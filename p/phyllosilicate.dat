5|$|Mathilde is very dark, with an albedo {{comparable}} to fresh asphalt, and {{is thought to}} share the same composition as CI1 or CM2 carbonaceous chondrite meteorites, with a surface dominated by <b>phyllosilicate</b> minerals. The asteroid {{has a number of}} extremely large craters, with the individual craters being named for coal fields and basins around the world. The two largest craters, Ishikari (29.3km) and Karoo (33.4km), are as wide as the asteroid's average radius. The impacts appear to have spalled large volumes off the asteroid, as suggested by the angular edges of the craters. No differences in brightness or colour were visible in the craters and there was no appearance of layering, so the asteroid's interior must be very homogeneous. There are indications of material movement along the downslope direction.|$|E

OMEGA spectral data have revealed a strong diversity of minerals in the Nili Fossae region, including mafic minerals and <b>phyllosilicates.</b> <b>Phyllosilicates</b> {{are found to}} be primarily Fe-rich smectites. These phylloslilicates are observed only on the Noachian crust, in four types of locations: Three are without any signatures other than <b>phyllosilicates,</b> on (1) smooth layered deposits, (2) massive exhumed material, and (3) crater ejecta, and one type of location is asociated with olivine (4) over an altered mafic unit. This diversity suggests a widespread liquid water activty and a variety of alteration processes. The formation of <b>phyllosilicates</b> underwent considerable reduction, if not cessation, by the time of formation of Syrtis Major lava flows in the Hesperian period. <b>Phyllosilicates</b> are spatially and chronologically disconnected from the fluvial and depositional landforms observed in the Nili Fossae region. Observations suggest that these landforms formed after the extensive formation of <b>phyllosilicates</b> during short periods of time and/or temperatures close to freezing...|$|R
40|$|Most <b>phyllosilicates</b> on Mars {{are thought}} to have formed during the planet's {{earliest}} Noachian era, then Mars underwent a global change making the planet's surface more acidic [e. g. 1]. Prevailing acidic conditions may have affected the already existing <b>phyllosilicates,</b> resulting in the formation of sulfates. Both sulfates and <b>phyllosilicates</b> have been identified on Mars in a variety of geologic settings [2] but only in a handful of sites are these minerals found in close spatial proximity to each other, including Mawrth Vallis [3, 4] and Gale Crater [5]. While sulfate formation from the acidic weathering of basalts is well documented in the literature [6, 7], few experimental studies investigate sulfate formation from acid-weathered <b>phyllosilicates</b> [8 - 10]. The {{purpose of this study is}} to characterize the al-teration products of acid-weathered <b>phyllosilicates</b> in laboratory experiments. We focus on three commonly identified <b>phyllosilicates</b> on Mars: nontronite (Fe-smectite), saponite (Mg-smectite), and montmorillonite (Al-smectite) [1, and references therein]. This information will help constrain the formation processes of sulfates observed in close association with <b>phyllosilicates</b> on Mars and provide a better understanding of the aqueous history of such regions as well as the planet as a whole...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSpectral indices from OMEGA hyperspectral {{data show}} {{that there are two}} main <b>phyllosilicates</b> exposed in and around Mawrth Vallis: Al <b>phyllosilicates</b> and Fe/Mg <b>phyllosilicates.</b> Detailed {{analysis}} of CRISM spectra shows that Al <b>phyllosilicates</b> such as montmorillonite, hydrated silica, kaolinite; Fe/Mg <b>phyllosilicates</b> such as nontronite, saponite, serpentine are widespread on the light-toned outcrops. Though similar stratigraphical sequences, morphologies and textures are observed on both sides of Mawrth Vallis from HiRISE images, suggesting that the geological processes that formed these units must have operated at a regional scale; the multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA) derived mineral abundance indicates that there is a higher level of alteration in the western side relative to the eastern side. We suggest that the observed <b>phyllosilicates,</b> stratigraphical sequences and different levels of alteration might have been caused by sedimentary deposition processes in which the composition of the external source sediment or the local solution was different, or by a pedogenic process closely related to the leaching of abundant liquid water with different chemical properties...|$|R
25|$|Some of {{the mineral}} classes {{detected}} may have formed in environments suitable (i.e., enough {{water and the}} proper pH) for life. The mineral smectite (a <b>phyllosilicate)</b> forms in near-neutral waters. Phyllosilicates and carbonates are good for preserving organic matter, so they may contain evidence of past life. Sulfate deposits preserve chemical and morphological fossils, and fossils of microorganisms form in iron oxides like hematite. The presence of opaline silica points toward a hydrothermal environment that could support life. Silica is also excellent for preserving evidence of microbes.|$|E
25|$|Phyllosilicates {{consist of}} sheets of {{polymerized}} tetrahedra. They are bound at three oxygen sites, which gives a characteristic silicon:oxygen ratio of 2:5. Important {{examples include the}} mica, chlorite, and the kaolinite-serpentine groups. The sheets are weakly bound by van der Waals forces or hydrogen bonds, which causes a crystallographic weakness, in turn leading to a prominent basal cleavage among the phyllosilicates. In addition to the tetrahedra, phyllosilicates have a sheet of octahedra (elements in six-fold coordination by oxygen) that balanced out the basic tetrahedra, which have a negative charge (e.g. 4−) These tetrahedra (T) and octahedra (O) sheets are stacked {{in a variety of}} combinations to create <b>phyllosilicate</b> groups. Within an octahedral sheet, there are three octahedral sites in a unit structure; however, not all of the sites may be occupied. In that case, the mineral is termed dioctahedral, whereas in other case it is termed trioctahedral.|$|E

40|$|<b>Phyllosilicates</b> on Mars {{are thought}} to have formed during Mars' {{earliest}} Noachian geologic era (approx. 4. 1 - 3. 7 Ga). Sulfate formation, on the other hand, requires more acidic conditions which {{are thought to}} have occurred later during Mars' Hesperian era (approx. 3. 7 - 3. 0 Ga). Therefore, regions on Mars where <b>phyllosilicates</b> and sulfates are found in close proximity to each other provide evidence for the aqueous conditions during this global transition. Both <b>phyllosilicates</b> and sulfates form in the presence of water and thus give clues to the aqueous history of Mars and its potential for habitability. <b>Phyllosilicates</b> that formed during the Noachian era would have been weathered by the prevailing acidic conditions that define the Hesperian. Therefore, {{the purpose of this study}} is to characterize the alteration products of acid-sulfate weathered <b>phyllosilicates</b> in laboratory experiments, focusing on the Fe/Mg-smectites commonly identified on Mars.

40|$|Asteroids {{belonging}} to the Ch spectral taxonomic class are defined {{by the presence of}} an absorption near 0. 7 μm, which is interpreted as due to Fe-bearing <b>phyllosilicates.</b> <b>Phyllosilicates</b> also cause strong absorptions in the 3 -μm region, as do other hydrated and hydroxylated minerals and H 2 O ice.

The parageneses of <b>phyllosilicates</b> generally change systematically with depth and with the degree of alteration, {{which in turn is}} related to permeability of basalts. Saponite and some mixed-layer chlorite/smectite are the dominant <b>phyllosilicates</b> {{at the top of the}} transition zone. Chlorite, corrensite, and mixed-layer chlorite/corrensite occur mainly in the lower transition zone and upper levels of the sheeted dike zone. Chlorite, talc, and mixed-layer talc/chlorite are the major <b>phyllosilicates</b> in the sheeted dike zone, although replacement of talc or ohvine by saponite is observed. The <b>phyllosilicates</b> consist of parallel or subparallel discrete packets of coherent layers with packet thicknesses generally ranging from< 100 Å to a few hundred Å. The packets of saponite layers are much smaller or less well defined than those of chlorite, corrensite and talc, indicating poorer crystal-linity of saponite. by contrast, chlorite and talc from the lower transition zone and the sheeted dike zone occur in packets up to thousands of Å thick. The Si/(Si+Al) ratio of these trioctahedral <b>phyllosilicates</b> increases and Fe/(Fe+Mg) decreases in the order chlorite, corrensite, saponite, and talc. These relations reflect optimal solid solution consistent with minimum misfit of articulated octahedral and tetrahedral sheets. Variations in composition of hydrothermal fluids and precursor minerals, especially in Si/(Si+Al) and Fe/(Fe+Mg) ratios, are thus important factors in controlling the parageneses of <b>phyllosilicates.</b> The <b>phyllosilicates</b> are generally well crystallized discrete phases, rather than mixed-layered phases, where they have been affected by relatively high fluid/rock ratios as in high-permeability basalts, in veins, or areas adjacent to veins. Intense alteration in basalts with high permeability (indicating high fluid/rock ratios) is characterized by pervasive albitization and zeolitization. Minimal alteration in the basalts without significant albitization and zeolitization is characterized by the occurrence of saponite±mixed-layer chlorite/smectite in the low-temperature alteration zone, and mixed-layer chlorite/corrensite or mixed-layer talc/chlorite in the high-temperature alteration zone. Textural non-equilibrium for <b>phyllosilicates</b> is represented by mixed layering and poorly defined packets of partially incoherent layers. The approach to textural equilibrium was controlled largely by the availability of fluid or permeability...|$|R

Pore-filling <b>phyllosilicates</b> are texturally characterized as having coherent, relatively thick and defect-free crystals of chlorite (14 Å) with occasional 24 -Å periodicities. Groundmass <b>phyllosilicates</b> are texturally characterized as 1) randomly oriented crystals up to 200 Å in width and 2) larger, more coherent crystals up to 1000 Å in width. Small crystallites contain predominantly 14 -Å layers with some 24 -Å units. Large crystals show randomly interlayered chlorite/smectite (C/S), with approximately 50 % chlorite on average. Adjacent smectite-like layers are not uncommon in the groundmass <b>phyllosilicates.</b> Electron microprobe analyses show that Fe/Mg ratios of both groundmass and vesicular <b>phyllosilicates</b> are fairly constant. Termination of brucite-like interlayers has been identified {{in some of the}} TEM images. The transformation mechanisms represented by these layer terminations are 1) growth of a brucite-like interlayer within smectite interlayer regions and 2) the dissolution and reprecipitation of elements to form chlorite layers. Both mechanisms require an increase in volume as smectite transforms to chlorite. The data, combined with that from previously published reports, suggest that randomly interlayered C/S is a metastable phase formed in microenvironments with low water/rock ratios. Chlorite forms in microenvironments in the same sample dominated by higher water/rock ratios. The relatively constant number of Mg's in the structure (Mg#) of both structures indicates that in both microenvironments the bulk rock composition has influence over the composition of <b>phyllosilicates...</b>|$|R

The specific surface areas of the samples are relatively large (> 100 m 2 g− 1) compared to naturally occurring montmorillonites. 29 Si and 27 Al nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) indicate substitutions of Al for Si in the tetrahedral sheet. 19 F NMR and Ni K-edge extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) local probes highlight a clustering of the metal elements and of the vacancies in the octahedral sheet of the samples.
