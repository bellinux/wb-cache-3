5000|$|An {{image of}} Narasiṃha {{supposedly}} dating to second-third century AD sculpted at Mathura {{was acquired by}} the Philadelphia Museum of Art in 1987. It was described by Stella Kramrisch, the former Philadelphia Museum of Art's Indian curator, as [...] "perhaps the earliest image of Narasiṃha as yet known". This figure depicts a furled brow, fangs, and lolling tongue similar to later images of Narasiṃha, but the idol's robe, simplicity, and stance set it apart. On Narasiṃha's chest under his upper garment appears the suggestion of an amulet, which Stella Kramrisch associated with Visnu's cognizance, the Kauṣtubha jewel. This upper garment flows over both shoulders; but below Hiranyakasipu, the demon-figure placed horizontally across Narasiṃha's body, a twisted waist-band suggests a separate garment covering the legs. The demon's hair streams behind him, cushioning {{his head against the}} man-lion's right knee. He wears a simple single strand of beads. His body seems relaxed, even pliant. His face is calm, with a slight suggestion of a smile. His eyes stare adoringly up at the face of Viṣṇu. There is little tension in this figure's legs or feet, even as Narasiṃha gently disembowels him. His innards spill along his right side. As the Matsya purana describes it, Narasiṃha ripped [...] "apart the mighty Daitya chief as a <b>plaiter</b> of straw mats shreds his reeds". Based on the Gandhara-style of robe worn by the idol, Michael Meiste altered the date of the image to fourth century AD.|$|E

50|$|The {{plaiting}} {{of straw}} in {{the counties of}} Buckinghamshire, Bedfordshire, Berkshire and Hertfordshire formerly gave employment to many thousands of women and young children; but this had largely ended {{by the beginning of}} the 20th century: the number of English <b>plaiters,</b> all told, was not more than a few hundreds in 1907, as compared with 30,000 in 1871.|$|R
50|$|Owing to its {{favorable}} agricultural conditions, {{up until}} at least {{the late nineteenth century}} Bedfordshire was predominantly an agricultural rather than a manufacturing county. From the 13th to the 15th century sheep farming flourished, Bedfordshire wool being in demand and plentiful. Surviving records show that in assessments of wool to the king, Bedfordshire always provided its full quota. Tradition says that the straw-plait industry owes its introduction to James I, who transferred to Luton the colony of Lorraine <b>plaiters</b> whom Mary, Queen of Scots, had settled in Scotland.|$|R
5000|$|Worldwide, {{the most}} {{valuable}} straw for plaits is grown in Tuscany, and from it the well-known Tuscan plaits and Leghorn hats are made. The straw of Tuscany, specially grown for plaiting, is distinguished into three grades of quality. The highest quality is Pontederas Semone, the second highest is Mazzuolo. The bulk of the plaits are made from this grade of straw. The third grade, Santa Fioro, is only used to plaite [...] "Tuscan pedals" [...] and braids.The wheat-seed for these straws is sown very thickly on comparatively elevated and arid land, and it sends up long attenuated stalks. When the grain in the ear is about half developed the straw is pulled up by the roots, dried in the sun, and subsequently spread out for several successive days to be bleached {{under the influence of}} alternate sunlight and night-dews. The pipe of the upper joint alone is selected for plaiting, the remainder of the straw being used for other purposes. These pipes are made up in small bundles, bleached in sulfur fumes in a closed chest; assorted into sizes, and so prepared for the <b>plaiters.</b> Straw-plaiting is a domestic industry among the women and young children of Tuscany and some parts of Emilia. Tuscan plaits and hats vary enormously in quality and value; the plait of a hat of good quality may represent the work of four or five days, while hats of the highest quality may each occupy six to nine months in making. The finest work is excessively trying to the eyes of the <b>plaiters,</b> who can at most give to it two or three hours' labor daily.|$|R
50|$|As of April 2011, Smith is the 12-time {{national}} ladies {{champion in}} competitive whipcracking, winning {{the title of}} the Australian Whipcrackers and <b>Plaiters</b> Association from 1995 to 1998, in 2000, and again each year from 2005 through 2011. Winning the competition for the tenth time in 2009, she introduced a number of new tricks which have since been adopted in international competitions by rival whipcrackers. In doing so, she established a new personal best, scoring 22 out of 20. Reporting on her ‘scintillating’ win in 2011, when the competition was held at Olympic Park, Sydney, the St George and Sutherland Shire Leader noted that Smith scored 24 out of 20 for one routine and was recognised on the train home.|$|R
50|$|Still {{new types}} of lace are being {{developed}} such as the 3D Rosalibre and a colored version of Milanese lace by borrowing rolls from Duchesse lace to store various shades and colors. Other artists are giving grounds a major role by distorting and varying stitches, pin distances and thread sizes or colours. The variations are explored by experimentation and mathematics and algorithms. The lace maintaining its shape without stiffening {{is no longer a}} requirement. Inspiring journals, guilds and foundations show that old techniques with a new twist can challenge young people to create works that can definitely classify as art.A Dutch design graduate in 2006 discovered bobbin lace was a technique to make a fancy fence. The first fences became museum pieces. The fences are now produced in Bangalore by concrete rebar <b>plaiters.</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} work {{in progress}} on a collaborative project being undertaken by the Department of Art and Design at the University of Luton with the architecture and planning departments at Luton Borough Council and community participation. Focussing on the <b>Plaiters</b> Lea urban zone in Luton, the project uses a three-dimensional digital urban model of the townscape, as a collaborative design and communication tool for urban regeneration. The proposals being developed include elements of architectural and urban design, landscape design and public art. The philosophical motivation for the project {{is that of the}} community architecture and arts movements, in which a wide constituency of stakeholders is involved in the evolution of design proposals. The digital model is the key feature of a world-wide-web site that facilitates the exchange of design data between the participants. Digital modelling work has been used for undergraduate CAD skills development, and students are contributing design proposals as part of their studio work. Hence the project also has a pedagogic component...|$|R
40|$|Between 1870 and 1900, {{the straw}} {{plaiting}} industry changed from being one that substantially contributed to local rural and family economies, {{to one in}} irrevocable decline. Researching {{the reasons for this}} decline is historically important because it gives insight into the practical working reality facing English <b>plaiters</b> during the period when the straw hat manufacturing industry sought new opportunities and experienced rapid expansion. There has, however, been little in-depth exploration of the relationship between this decline and the concurrent and rapid industrial revolution in the straw hat industry. Other studies have considered the social and economic history of the plaiting industry and have concluded with an acknowledgment that the industry declined in the 1870 s. The often brief reasons given for this decline have focused on the impact of straw plait imports and mechanisation in the hat industry. This study aims to move the discussion of decline forward by clearly linking the shape of the plaiting industry???s demise to industrial expansion in the straw hat industry. This has been attempted by researching a contemporary hat industry trade journal for the years 1873 to 1900. The Hatter and Umbrella Trade Circular; A Monthly Trade Journal, provides insight into the concurrent processes of decline and expansion, and is from the view point of the straw hat industry itself. This reveals a story of divergence between the fortunes of those working with straw. The rapid expansion of the straw hat industry created wealth in Luton, especially during the 1870 s and 1880 s and this threw the English plaiting industry into decline. However, it was the <b>plaiters???</b> responsiveness to changes in demand for labour from the hat industry, which appear to have facilitated the hat manufacturers??? and plait dealers??? ability to meet the explosion in demand for straw hats. South Midlands rural workers were an on-tap supply of skilled straw workers. Many of these workers reacted to Luton???s industrial revolution by adapting; by moving between plaiting and hand-sewing according to demand and by traveling or migrating to become straw hat machinists in Luton???s myriad of small workshops...|$|R
50|$|The districts around Luton in Bedfordshire and the {{neighbouring}} counties were, {{since the beginning}} of the 17th century, the British home of the straw-plait industry. The straw of certain varieties of wheat cultivated in that region is, in favourable seasons, possessed of a fine bright color and due to tenacity and strength. The straw is cut as in ordinary harvesting, but is allowed to dry in the sun, before binding. Subsequently straws are selected from the sheaves, and of these the pipes of the two upper joints are taken for plaiting. The pipes are assorted into sizes by passing them through graduated openings in a grilled wire frame, and those of good color are bleached by the fumes of sulphur. Spotted and discoloured straws are dyed either in pipe or in plait. The <b>plaiters</b> work up the material in a damp state, either into whole straw or split straw plaits. Split straws are prepared with the aid of a small instrument having a projecting point which enters the straw pipe, and from which radiate the number of knife-edged cutters into which the straw is to be split. The straws were put through a small mangle to flatten them. They were then braided to produce a woven strip which was sold on to the makers of hats, baskets and other wares.|$|R
60|$|It was {{the middle}} ages, however, that finally brought down Fiesole in earnest to the plain. Pisa had been the {{earliest}} Tuscan town to attain importance and maritime supremacy after the dark days of barbarian incursion; {{but as soon as}} land-transit once more assumed general importance, Florence, seated on the great route from the north to Rome by Siena, and commanding the passage of the Arno and the gate of the Apennines, naturally began to surpass in time its distanced rival. As early as the Roman days a bridge is said to have spanned the Arno {{on the site of the}} existing Ponte Vecchio. The mediæval walls enclosed the southern tête du pont within their picturesque circuit, thus securing the passage of the river and giving Florence its little Janiculus, the Oltrarno, with its southern exit by the Porta Romana. The real 'makers of Florence' were the humble workmen who thus extended the firm hold of the growing republic to the southern bank. By so doing, they gave their city undoubted command of the imperial route from Germany Romeward, and brought in their train Dante and Giotto, Brunelleschi and Donatello, Fra Angelico and Savonarola, the Medici and the Pitti, Michael Angelo and Raffaele, and all the glories of the Renaissance epoch. For as at Athens, so in Florence, art and literature followed plainly in the wake of commerce. But the rise of Florence was the fall of Fiesole. Already in the eleventh century the undutiful daughter had conquered and annexed her venerable mother; and in proportion as the mercantile importance of the city in the plain waxed greater and greater, that of the city on the hill-top must slowly have waned to less and less. At the present day Fiesole has degenerated into a mere suburb of Florence, which, indeed, it had almost become when Lorenzo the Magnificent held his country court at the Villa Mozzi, or even earlier, when Boccaccio's lively narrators fled from the plague to the gardens of the Palmieri, though it still retains the dignity of its ancient cathedral, its municipal palace, its gigantic seminary, and its great overgrown Franciscan monastery, that replaces the citadel on the height above the town. Nay, more, with its local museum, its bishop's palace, and its quaint churches, it keeps up, to some extent, all the airs and graces of a real living town. But in reality these few big buildings, and the graceful campanile which makes so fair a show in all the neighbouring views, are the best of the little city. Fiesole looks biggest seen from afar. All that is vital in it is the ecclesiastical establishment, which still clings, with true ecclesiastical conservatism, to the hill-top city, and the trade of the straw <b>plaiters,</b> who make Leghorn straw goods and pester the visitor with their flimsy wares, taking no answer to all their importunities save one in solid coin of good King Umberto.|$|R
