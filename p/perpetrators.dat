40|$|AbstractBoth real-life {{events and}} {{research}} show that rape victims are sometimes blamed for their victimization. The effect of <b>perpetrator</b> characteristics on victim blaming {{has rarely been}} studied. In an experiment using a community sample (N = 161), we investigated {{the effect of the}} <b>perpetrator's</b> previous conviction and age, as well as participants’ gender and belief in a just world (BJW) on blame attributions using a vignette methodology. It was predicted that less victim blame and more <b>perpetrator</b> blame would be attributed when the <b>perpetrator</b> had a previous conviction. Results showed that level of BJW was associated with victim blame (positively) and <b>perpetrator</b> blame (negatively). Men blamed the victim more and women blamed the victim less when the <b>perpetrator</b> had a previous conviction. Women blamed the <b>perpetrator</b> more and men less when the <b>perpetrator</b> had a previous conviction. Hence, gender {{is an important factor in}} explaining variation in blame attributions...|$|R

40|$|Current {{research}} surrounding {{reactions to}} sexual harassment {{focuses on the}} victim. However, the literature generally fails to consider {{the impact of the}} <b>perpetrator</b> 2 ̆ 7 s characteristics on reactions to sexual harassment. In an attempt to provide some insight into this question, this study utilized a social identity theory approach to investigate the impact of <b>perpetrator</b> cultural similarity to an observer on reactions to both the victim and <b>perpetrator</b> of sexual harassment. Ninety-eight participants from an Anglo-Australian background were presented with a vignette detailing a scenario of sexual harassment with a female victim (always from the same culture as the observer) and a male <b>perpetrator</b> (from either a similar or different culture to the observer) and asked a series of questions surrounding reactions to and identification with the <b>perpetrator</b> and victim. Results show that participant gender had the biggest impact on perceptions of the <b>perpetrator</b> such that male participants were more likely to identity with the <b>perpetrator</b> and {{were also more likely to}} find the situation humorous. However, it was found that <b>perpetrator</b> culture had the biggest impact on reactions to the victim such that when the <b>perpetrator</b> was culturally similar to the participants, both genders were less likely to blame, derogate or socially distance themselves from the victim. Mediation analyses showed that <b>perpetrator</b> identification was a significant mediator of the relationship between participant gender and humour found in the situation. Mediation analyses also showed victim identification was a significant mediator of the relationship between <b>perpetrator</b> culture and victim blame and a partial mediator of the relationship between <b>perpetrator</b> culture and social distancing from the victim. Of particular interest was the finding that both male and female observers had more positive reactions toward the victim when the <b>perpetrator</b> was from a different culture. This suggests that the victim of sexual harassment may receive more support when the <b>perpetrator</b> is culturally different to observers...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to examine how crime journalism relates to gender by {{exploring}} how a female <b>perpetrator</b> is constructed in Swedish news media. We examined a specific case where a female <b>perpetrator</b> murdered and dismembered her victim in Askersund, Örebro. The questions examined were; How are the female <b>perpetrator</b> represented in the tabloid Aftonbladet and the local newspaper Nerikes Allehanda and what are the differences and similarities between Aftonbladet’s and Nerikes Allehanda’s representation of her? We made a discourse analysis of eighteen news articles. The result shows that the female <b>perpetrator</b> is represented as a non-ideal female <b>perpetrator,</b> a heartbroken and weak victim and an ordinary woman who suddenly transforms. Aftonbladet and Nerikes Allehanda also represent the female <b>perpetrator</b> as an evil and insensitive murderer and like a jealous madman. Both Aftonbladet and Nerikes Allehanda describe that the female <b>perpetrator</b> saw her victim as a rival. At the beginning, mainly Nerikes Allehanda, represent the female perperator as a part of the community by representing her as a kind and innocent girl who loves horses. Then the representation is changing and the female <b>perpetrator</b> is represented as an intruder in the community. This representation also appears in Aftonbladet. However the tabloid mostly represents the female <b>perpetrator</b> with attributes like vicious, callous, jealous and mad. Our study also shows that the distance between the newspapers and the place where the crime occurred, influences the representation of the female <b>perpetrator.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|This {{retrospective}} study explores, through {{quantitative and qualitative}} methods, the relationship of two variables (<b>perpetrator</b> relationship and <b>perpetrator</b> methodology) to posttraumatic and dissociative symptomatology. The quantitative sample comprised a nonpsychiatric group (N = 39) of Australian adults reporting sexual abuse histories. A MANOVA revealed that current levels of posttraumatic and dissociative symptomatology were significantly higher in the group reporting sexual abuse by a <b>perpetrator</b> in a relationship of trust, guardianship, or authority. The qualitative sample comprised a purposively selected subgroup of the quantitative sample (n = 20). Thematic content analyses of <b>perpetrator</b> methodology suggest that <b>perpetrator</b> strategies involving emotional manipulation, rather than the <b>perpetrator</b> relationship per se, appear to differentiate between groups with clinical or nonclinical levels of posttraumatic and dissociative symptomatology. The combination of qualitative and quantitative methods provides integrated, contextualized data with implications for future research and clinical practice...|$|R

The event {{received}} a great deal of spatial attention in Swedish media and has been called the worst school attack in Swedish history. The twenty-one-year-old <b>perpetrator</b> had grown up in Trollhättan and it is his origin that is of interest in this study. The aim {{of this study is to}} examine how a <b>perpetrator</b> of native origin is portrayed in a Swedish medium. Previous research, which shows that there is a difference between how a <b>perpetrator</b> of native origin is portrayed compared to a foreign one, is used as background. According to these studies media often focuses on the <b>perpetrator’s</b> ethnicity and descent if the person is of foreign origin. Through a qualitative framing analysis we examine how the <b>perpetrator</b> in Trollhättan is portrayed in Sweden’s largest news website, namely aftonbladet. se. We explore how the <b>perpetrator's</b> ethnicity and origin are expressed and which of the <b>perpetrator's</b> characteristics are focused on by Aftonbladet. Through framing analysis we also explore how the <b>perpetrator</b> is portrayed from an us-and-them perspective, and how ideas and concepts are personalized through him. The results of this study show that the male <b>perpetrator</b> who is of native origin in the case Trollhättan is portrayed as a lone maniac who committed an act of evil and that Aftonbladet focused on his personal circumstances, for example that he had issues socializing...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} data from U.

Results indicated that frightening appraisals mediated the relationship between <b>perpetrator</b> rank and all outcomes for both sexes. However, frightening appraisals mediated the relationship between <b>perpetrator</b> sex and outcomes only for women. As predicted, having a male <b>perpetrator</b> or a higher status <b>perpetrator</b> was more strongly related to frightening appraisals for women than men. However, unexpectedly, the relationship between frightening appraisals and more psychological distress, more role limitations, and less work satisfaction was stronger for men than women.

40|$|Three studies {{examine how}} people’s {{attributions}} {{of responsibility for}} terrorist attacks depend on their group membership and their identification with the victim (study 1) or their identification with the victim’s or <b>perpetrator’s</b> ingroup (studies 2 and 3). We observe that people’s group membership (<b>perpetrator</b> group versus victim group) determines the judgments of responsibility for recent terrorist attacks. Members of the <b>perpetrator</b> group hold the direct perpetra- tors responsible, while members of the victim group perceive the <b>perpetrator</b> {{world as a whole}} as relatively responsible as well. Identification with the victim (study 1) or victim group (studies 2 and 3) strengthens attributions of responsibility to the whole <b>perpetrator</b> group, and this relationship is partially mediated by the perceived typicality of the <b>perpetrator</b> for the whole group. We discuss possible explanations for this pattern, and indicate the implications of these results in terms of improving intergroup relations...|$|R

Across two studies using different methods, we find that incidents of single <b>perpetrator</b> incivility are associated with target feelings of isolation and embarrassment, which in turn relate to targets’ perceived job insecurity and somatic symptoms (Studies 1 and 2) both the same day and three days later (Study 2). Moreover, we find that <b>perpetrator</b> power moderates the relationship between incivility and embarrassment, such that targets are more embarrassed when the <b>perpetrator</b> is powerful.

40|$|Background: Since 1997, {{hospital}} discharge {{data have}} included external cause of injury (E codes) for designating <b>perpetrator</b> relationship in assaults. For intentional injuries, guidelines require using two E codes; {{one for the}} injury mechanism and another (E 967. n) identifying <b>perpetrator</b> relationship. Completeness and characteristics {{of the use of}} these codes have not been studied on a multistate level among states with complete E coding. Methods: Hospital discharge data for 1997 were solicited from states with good E coding completeness. Data were received from 19 states (51. 9 % of women in the United States, ages 15 – 49). For assaulted women, a regression model was constructed to identify factors associated with <b>perpetrator</b> code assignment using age, payment source, pregnancy status, race, and severity as covariates. Results: Among 137 887 injured hospitalized women age 15 – 49, there were 7402 assaults (5. 4 %). Among all assaults to women, <b>perpetrator</b> coding was poor (8. 8 %). Among those that were <b>perpetrator</b> coded, 83. 7 % were spouse/partner related. Age was positively associated with probability of having a <b>perpetrator</b> code (p, 0. 001). Those paid by a private source were 42. 9 % {{more likely to have a}} <b>perpetrator</b> code (p = 0. 007). Pregnant women were seven times more likely to have a <b>perpetrator</b> code (p, 0. 001).
