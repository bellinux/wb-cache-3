According to the proposal Greece, Serbia, and the Republic of Macedonia would all be members of the tripartite confederation. In 1994, Milošević invited Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou to consider the longstanding proposal of the Athens-Belgrade-Skopje confederation. Papandreou characterized the idea as [...] "a pioneering, interesting proposal" [...] but noted that it had not yet been examined. Main opposition New Democracy party leader Miltiadis Evert, who had also met with Milošević, said that all Balkan countries should instead gain accession to the European Union. <b>Political</b> <b>Spring</b> party leader Antonis Samaras said that the proposal was [...] "interesting but should be thoroughly examined." [...] These proposals failed to gain any significant response from the Greek government, mostly because of the precarious state of Yugoslavia at the time.|$|E

In foreign policy, Mitsotakis took the initiative to have Greece formally recognize the state of Israel, and moved to reopen talks on American bases in Greece and to restore confidence among Greece's economic and political partners. In June 1990, Mitsotakis became the first Greek Premier to visit the United States since the Metapolitefsi. He promised to meet Greece's NATO obligations, to prevent use of Greece {{as a base for}} terrorism, and to stop the rhetorical attacks on the United States that had been Papandreou's hallmark. Mitsotakis also supported a new dialogue with Turkey, but made progress on the Cyprus dispute a prerequisite for improvement on other issues.Papandreou, cleared of charges arising from the Bank of Crete scandal in a 7-6 vote at the Eidiko Dikastirio (Special Court), criticised Mitsotakis's government for its economic policies, for not taking a sufficiently strict position over the naming dispute with the newly independent Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (Mitsotakis favored a composite name such as [...] "Nova Macedonia", for which he was accused at the time of being too lenient) as well as over Cyprus, and for being too pro-American. The heightened public irritation over the Macedonia naming issue caused several ND parliament members, led by Antonis Samaras, to withdraw their support from Mitsotakis's government and form a new political party, <b>Political</b> <b>Spring</b> ( [...] , [...] ).

Since President U Thein Seins government ascended to the power in March 2011, Myanmars <b>political</b> <b>spring</b> is gradually moving ahead. However, admit the brighter progress, there are struggles and frustrations embedded. Armed conflict between Kachin Independent Organizations (KIO) and governments troops (Tatmadaw) is still going on. The Kachin conflict has been a policy challenge for Tiongkok. Border tranquility, the protection of Chinese investments and the prevention of expanding US influence are the top three considerations for all border regions. The Kachin conflict has disrupted Tiongkoks border security and jeopardized its economic investments in the region.

This research applied neo-realis paradigm and intervention concept from J. G. Strake. The theories applied in this research are objectivity theory from Paul R. Viotti and Mark V. Kauppi on International and World Politics  Security, Economy, IdentityThis research shows that how the Kachin conflict affects these interests of Tiongkok has played a determining role in Tiongkoks policy toward the conflict. Tiongkoks most significant policy adjustment on the Kachin conflict was intervention in the negotiations. Tiongkok offered to resolve this difference by providing place for the talks. In addition, Tiongkok also explicitly guaranteed the security of all participants, sending armed police to guard the perimeter.
