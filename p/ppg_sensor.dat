In order to make a driver's HRV monitoring on the road possible, a new photoplethysmograph (<b>PPG)</b> Ring <b>Sensor</b> prototype has been devised specifically for countering the problem of motion artifact that almost all wearable <b>PPG</b> <b>sensors</b> are facing. Most importantly, the motion artifacts on PPG signals caused by motion in the direction of blood flow in the digital arteries along the finger flanks have been eliminated using a customized Adaptive Noise Cancellation algorithm. Both the lab results and the road test results have suggested that the new Ring Sensor is indeed capable of rejecting motion artifacts in all three possible motion axes and producing considerable amount of usable beat-to-beat heart rate data on the road for HRV analysis. The problem of occasional missing data on the road has also been tackled with a suitable linear curve-fitting algorithm. Also, the sunlight saturation problem is dealt with using a simple DC averaging reference circuit. The final road test has proven the validity of the driver Mental Workload model and the validity of the Ring Sensor in monitoring the HRV of the driver on the road. Besides the application on driver monitoring, the Ring Sensor can also be used for other forms of wearable monitoring such as jogging. by Honghui Jiang. Thesis (S. M.)

The size and, power consumption of the device are considered while developing, to ensure an easy deployment of the unit at the measuring site {{and the ability to}} power the entire unit with a battery. The selection of both the electronic circuits and signal processing techniques is based on their sensitivity to PPG signals, robustness against noise inducing artifacts and miniaturization of the entire measuring unit.

In this regard, heart rate (HR) is an effective physiological indicator of workers' physical demands. Currently, off-the-shelf wearable activity trackers (e. g., wristband-type) can monitor a worker's HR with its embedded photoplethysmography (<b>PPG)</b> <b>sensor.</b> However, PPG signals can be highly affected by signal noises resulted from user's movements, and thus the exact HR extraction from a wristband-type PPG may not be sufficiently accurate during intensive construction tasks. In this paper, we investigate the accuracy of a <b>PPG</b> <b>sensor</b> embedded in a wristband-type tracker {{to see if it}} can be used for construction. Through field data collection from seven construction workers, we conduct a comparative HR analysis between a <b>PPG</b> <b>sensor</b> and an electro-cardiography (ECG) sensor in a chest strap used as ground truth. The results show that a PPG-based HR sensor in a wristband-type activity tracker has a potential for practicable HR monitoring of construction workers with 4. 79 % of mean-average-percentage-error (MAPE) and 0. 85 of correlation coefficient for whole datasets (4. 44 %, 4. 52 %, and 533 % of MAPEs and 0. 89, 0. 70, and 0. 61 of correlation coefficients during light works with 110 bpm of HRs, respectively). Because there is still room for improvement of the accuracy, particularly during heavy works, we also investigate the factors affecting the accuracy of HR monitoring using inequality statistics. From this secondary investigation, we found the major sources of error including noises from motion artifacts.

Still, the most demanded biomonitoring smart systems focus on the examination of cardiovascular conditions due to the urgency of the problem in the public health.

40|$|The photoplethysmogram (PPG) is an {{extremely}} useful wearable sensing medical diagnostic tool. However, the PPG signal becomes highly corrupted when the wearer is in motion, rendering the measured signal useless. This thesis develops an adaptive motion artifact reduction scheme to recover the underlying physiologic information from the corrupted signal using a collocated accelerometer as a motion reference and adaptively estimating the motion-to-artifact system dynamics. It has previously been shown that this artifact reduction scheme can be utilized, but many tunable parameters were required to model the system dynamics and performance was poor. This work quantifies algorithm performance based on confidence in the estimated system dynamics, which shows low confidence using the previous parameterization when the wearer is jogging. To improve confidence, {{the form of the}} system dynamics is established and a Laguerre series is implimented to compactly represent the system dynamics using just a few parameters that can be confidently estimated. Using the new model, heart rate and amplitude can be estimated from typical jogger data with variance similar to separate <b>PPG</b> <b>sensors</b> located on contralateral motionless hands. The standard artifact reduction scheme does not work when the physiologic signal is correlated with wearer motion. Since the signals may become correlated, this work develops a method of recovering the physiological signal even when it is correlated with wearer motion by adapting blind source seperation techniques. However, the success of this new method is limited. by Levi Benjamin Wood. Thesis (S. M.) [...] Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, 2008.

A three channel instrumentation system (splanchnic PPG, peripheral PPG, and ECG) and software algorithms implemented in LabVIEW allowed for the continuous acquisition of PPG and ECG signals and the estimation of SpO 2. The feasibility of the fibre optic sensors to allow for sufficient illumination of the tissue and to adequately detect PPG signals was explored and validated in the laboratory.

Results Good quality PPG signals with high signal-to-noise (SNR) ratios were obtained from all splanchnic sites under investigation. Analysis of the ac and dc amplitudes of the red and infrared PPG signals showed there to be a statistically significant difference between PPG signals obtained from splanchnic organs with those obtained from the finger (using fiber optic sensors). Estimated SpO 2 values from the splanchnic organs show good agreement with those obtained from the finger using both a fiber optic sensor and a commercial device.

Consequently, acute occurrence of cardiac or pulmonary system failure reduces an employee’s likelihood of surviving {{due to the lack}} of ability for communication and the lack of ability for emergency calls. In the case of severe injury, a medic’s response time becomes a crucial parameter for increasing a person’s likelihood of survival. Continuous monitoring of vital signs therefore assists medics and employees by reducing response time to severe accidents. For detection of vital signs; electrocardiography, capnometry and pulse oximetry are being widely used as the golden standard for extraction of vital signs such as heart rate, respiration rate and blood oxygenation. But, these sensors require motionless attachment to specific areas of the body. The fact that employees are constantly in motion and sometimes covered by protection shields introduces difficulty concerning the continuous obtaining of vital signs. In this dissertation, we studied feasibility of replacing Electrocardiography by Photoplethysmography on mechanically flexible sensors. Three major studies were performed. First, we developed an algorithm for the detection of respiration rate from Photoplethysmography. During this study, a fast respond CO 2 sensor was also modulated to detect respiration rate, and both methods were compared to respiration effort transducer. Second, we assessed the feasibility of fabricating <b>PPG</b> <b>sensors</b> on plastic polymers. During this study, we designed and integrated a novel PPG device, using inkjet-printing technology. At last, we developed a computationally inexpensive algorithm for the extraction of heart rate variability (HRV) from the morphology of PPG. Results were compared to HRV from commercial ECG and the performance of the device was evaluated respectively...|$|R

The GSR signals were measured using two electrodes which were attached to the index and middle fingers of the subject’s right hand with Ag/AgCl gel materials. The SKT signals were measured with TSD 202 sensors placed on the thumb. Also, two channel electroencephalography (EEG) signals were measured at 512  Hz.|$|R
40|$|Monitoring blood {{perfusion}} and oxygenation {{changes is}} of vital importance {{and for this}} reason many different techniques have been developed over the decades. Photoplethysmography (PPG) is an optical technique that measures blood volume variations in vascular tissue and it is well known for its utilisation in pulse oximetry for the estimation of arterial blood oxygen saturation (SpO 2). In pulse oximetry, mainly the pulsatile component of the signal (AC PPG) is used while the continuous DC component is mostly excluded. Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) is another optical technique that measures changes in the concentration of oxygenated (ΔHbO 2), deoxygenated (ΔHHb), and total haemoglobin (ΔtHb) from the variations in light attenuations at different wavelengths. The main motivation of this research is to explore the capability of Photoplethysmography in assessing tissue perfusion and oxygenation similarly as NIRS. The hypothesis underlining this research is that the DC component of the PPG signal contains information on the overall absorbed light and this part of the PPG signal, acquired at least two wavelengths, may be used to obtain ΔHbO 2, ΔHHb, and ΔtHb as performed in NIRS. Therefore, DC PPG attenuations may be related to haemoglobin concentrations by the modified Beer-Lambert law (MBLL). In order to investigate this, novel reflectance, custom-made <b>PPG</b> <b>sensors</b> and measurement systems, including advanced signal processing algorithms, have been developed for the acquisition and analysis of raw PPG signals (AC + DC) from different anatomical locations. Three in vivo studies on healthy volunteers were carried out in order to investigate if ΔHbO 2, ΔHHb, and ΔtHb estimated from PPG could indicate changes in blood perfusion and oxygenation. The studies consisted of vascular occlusions on the forearm, negative bed tilting, and whole body cold exposure. Raw PPG signals were acquired from different locations such as the forearm, fingers, and forehead, whereas simultaneous NIRS signals were used as a reference. The results showed that ΔHbO 2, ΔHHb, and ΔtHb could be effectively estimated from PPG signals. These parameters indicated the changes in blood volumes and/or oxygenation, whereas comparison with NIRS signals showed good levels of correlation and trending. These promising results showed that DC PPG signals could be used to monitor changes in blood perfusion and oxygenation, extending the range of applications of Photoplethysmography...|$|R
