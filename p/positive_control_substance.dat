30|$|Both {{these high}} {{anaerobic}} degradation results were achieved despite {{the inclusion of}} potentially anomalous results of 38 % and 37 %, respectively, for these substances which were both generated by laboratory 3. Laboratory 3 reported a toxic influence of test substance FAS on the inoculum which explains the lower biodegradation value compared with other labs; however, {{this is not the}} case for FA + 7 EO. It is noted that this laboratory also generated significantly lower biodegradation levels for a number of test substances when compared with other labs. Conversely, the degradation of the <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> <b>substance</b> glucose is within acceptable limits, and therefore, it must be summised that the low value for FA + 7 EO and the toxicity demonstrated by FAS was simply a result of the inherent variability between inoculum sources. If these results are discounted, the results show much less variation with lower standard deviations. FA + 7 EO achieves a mean degradation of 106.9 % and standard deviation of 10.5 %, and FAS achieves a mean degradation of 102.7 % and standard deviation of 22.8 %.|$|E
30|$|Using {{the revised}} AnBUSDiC test {{procedure}} [5], there were noticeable {{differences in the}} levels of anaerobic biodegradation observed for the six different test substances. When all data submitted by the participating laboratories were included, four of the test substances, FA + 7 EO (a non-ionic linear alcohol ethoxylate), FAS (the anionic sodium dodecyl sulphates), betaine (an amphoteric surfactant) together with the positive control (glucose) were all efficiently anaerobically degraded with mean degradation levels of more than 70 %. Possible anomalous (lower biodegradation percentage) results were observed from participating laboratory 3 for FA + 7 EO and FAS. Exclusion of these two values resulted in higher degradation and improved standard deviation values for these two test products but {{does not change the}} overall conclusion that both these products are efficiently anaerobically degraded. Whilst the degradation of these two substances in laboratory 3 was lower compared with the other labs, degradation of the <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> <b>substance</b> glucose was within the normal range, and therefore, it must be summised that the low values are simply a result of the inherent variability between inoculum sources ability to degrade the test substances. When previously tested under OECD 311 test guidelines, FA + 7 EO was found to be 70 % to 80 % biodegradable in 60 days which supports the ring test data found in this study [1].|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} ferrous chelates {{including}} hairtail protein hydrolysates {{to prevent and}} reduce fatigue was studied in rats. After hydrolysis of hairtail surimi with papain, the hairtail protein hydrolysates (HPH) were separated into three groups by range of relative molecular weight using ultrafiltration membrane separation. Hairtail proteins were then chelated with ferrous ions, and the antioxidant activity, the amino acid composition and chelation rate of the three kinds of ferrous chelates including hairtail protein hydrolysates (Fe-HPH) were determined. Among the three groups, the Fe-HPH chelate showing the best conditions was selected for the anti-fatigue animal experiment. For it, experimental rats were randomly divided into seven groups. Group A was designated as the negative control group given distilled water. Group B, the positive control group, was given glutathione. Groups C, D and E were designated as the Fe-HPH chelate treatment groups and given low, medium, and high doses, respectively. Group F was designated as HPH hydrolysate treatment group, and Group G was designated as FeCl 2 treatment group. The different diets were orally administered to rats for 20 days. After that time, rats were subjected to forced swimming training after 1 h of gavage. Rats given Fe-FPH chelate had higher haemoglobin regeneration efficiency (HRE), longer exhaustive swimming time and higher SOD activity. Additionally, Fe-FPH chelate was found to significantly decrease the malondialdehyde content, visibly enhance the GSH-Px activity in liver and reduce blood lactic acid of rats. Fe-HPH chelate revealed an anti-fatigue effect, similar to or better than the <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> <b>substance</b> and superior to HPH or Fe when provided alone...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{provided}} conflicting results {{in regards to}} equine intradermal skin testing and its use in defining causative antigens in IgE mediated diseases such as equine recurrent airway obstruction (RAO). This study was divided into two experiments. In the first experiment of this study, the hypothesis tested was normal horses would have minimal variability in the wheals formed by intradermal injection of <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> stimulants. This was evaluated by examining the repeatability of skin test wheals created by 5 concentrations of histamine, compound 48 / 80, and phaseolus vulgaris (PHA) within a normal horse and between 12 normal horses at 0. 5 hours, 4 hours, and 24 hours post injection. Minimal variability was detected within individual horses and between 12 horses for histamine and compound 48 / 80 at 0. 5 hours and for PHA at 4 hours. This information suggests that the intradermal injection of <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> <b>substances</b> is a repeatable test in normal horses. In the second experiment of this study, the hypothesis tested was normal horses react differently to intradermal injection of <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> stimulants (histamine, compound 48 / 80, PHA) and/or an environmental antigen (Aspergillus) in comparison to horse...|$|R
40|$|To {{test for}} {{potential}} estrogenic activity of plant stanols and plant stanol esters, two short-term tests were performed. These were the E-screen test, which measures a substance's ability to induce proliferation of estrogen-responsive human breast adenocarcinoma (MCF- 7) cells in culture, and an in vivo test, which measures uterotrophic activity in immature female rats fed the test substance. Four samples of vegetable oil-derived stanols (containing 88 - 99 % stanols) {{were tested in}} the E-screen test, and one sample of wood-derived and one of vegetable oil-derived stanol fatty acid esters were tested in the in vivo test. In the E-screen test, the <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> <b>substance,</b> 17 β-estradiol, at 100 pM, produced a statistically significant, 11. 6 -fold increase in cell proliferation, as measured by sulforhodamine B staining. None of the stanol preparations produced any increase in cell proliferation when tested at 1, 10, and 100 μM. The highest dose of each stanol sample was associated with microscopic evidence of cytotoxicity and crystalline precipitation in the culture dishes. In the in vivo test, the positive control compound, diethylstilbestrol, produced a significant, dose- related increase in absolute and relative uterus weight in young female rats (17 days old {{at the start of}} treatment) fed the compound at 5, 10, and 20 ppb in the diet for 4 days. Neither of the two stanol ester preparations caused any significant change in absolute or relative uterus weight when fed at a concentration of 8. 3 % in the diet for 4 days. Thus, under the conditions of testing used, neither the free stanols nor the stanol fatty acid ester preparations showed evidence of estrogenic or uterotrophic activity...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{pharmacokinetics}} and neurotoxicity of paraquat dichloride (PQ) {{were assessed}} following once weekly administration to C 57 BL/ 6 J male mice by intraperitoneal injection for 1, 2 or 3 weeks at doses of 10, 15 or 25 mg/kg/week. Approximately 0. 3 % of the administered dose {{was taken up}} by the brain and was slowly eliminated, with a half-life of approximately 3 weeks. PQ did not alter the concentration of dopamine (DA), homovanillic acid (HVA) or 3, 4 -dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), or increase dopamine turnover in the striatum. There was inconsistent stereological evidence of a loss of DA neurons, as identified by chromogenic or fluorescent-tagged antibodies to tyrosine hydroxylase in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). There was no evidence that PQ induced neuronal degeneration in the SNpc or degenerating neuronal processes in the striatum, as indicated by the absence of uptake of silver stain or reduced immunolabeling of tyrosine-hydroxylase-positive (TH+) neurons. There was no evidence of apoptotic cell death, which was evaluated using TUNEL or caspase 3 assays. Microglia (IBA- 1 immunoreactivity) and astrocytes (GFAP immunoreactivity) were not activated in PQ-treated mice 4, 8, 16, 24, 48, 96 or 168 h after 1, 2 or 3 doses of PQ. In contrast, mice dosed with the <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> <b>substance,</b> 1 -methyl- 4 -phenyl- 1, 2, 3, 6 -tetrahydropyridine (MPTP; 10 mg/kg/dose× 4 doses, 2 h apart), displayed significantly reduced DA and DOPAC concentrations and increased DA turnover in the striatum 7 days after dosing. The number of TH+ neurons in the SNpc was reduced, and there were increased numbers of degenerating neurons and neuronal processes in the SNpc and striatum. MPTP-mediated cell death was not attributed to apoptosis. MPTP activated microglia and astrocytes within 4 h of the last dose, reaching a peak within 48 h. The microglial response ended by 96 h in the SNpc, but the astrocytic response continued through 168 h in the striatum. These results bring into question previous published stereological studies that report loss of TH+ neurons in the SNpc of PQ-treated mice. This study also suggests that even if the reduction in TH+ neurons reported by others occurs in PQ-treated mice, this apparent phenotypic change is unaccompanied by neuronal cell death or by modification of dopamine levels in the striatum...|$|E
40|$|Hypericum androsaemum is an {{evergreen}} shrub {{spread in}} the Mediterranean basin and cultivated in several European countries. The plant bears fleshy and berry-like capsules that ripen from red to shiny black. In several European conutries H. androsaemum has been traditionally used as diuretic, hepatoprotective, wound healing and as an antidepressant agent. The aim {{of the study was}} to evaluate the pharmaceutical potential of the methanolic extract of H. androsaemum red berries (HASE) through inhibition of CNS enzymes such as monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A), tyrosinase (TYR) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE). HASE was obtained by soxhlet extraction and analyzed by HPLC-DAD for the content of ten bioactive constituents. HASE activities were measured in terms of monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A),tyrosinase (TYR) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition. HASE was very rich of shikimic acid and chlorogenic acid, occurring at concentration of 94941. 7 and 39059. 1 mg/kg,respectively. HASE was able to inhibit MAO-A and TYR in a dose dependent manner, although activity was not superior to <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> <b>substances.</b> On the basis of HASE composition and inhibitory effects on MAO-A and tyrosinase, red berries might represent an alternative Hypericum to obtain pharmacologically active substances...|$|R

40|$|Exposure to xenoestrogens during {{development}} {{has been shown to}} impair sexual differentiation in various species. The major aim of this thesis was to elucidate the respective roles of the two estrogen receptors ERα and ERβ in normal and disrupted differentiation of sex organs and copulatory behavior in the Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica). The expression of ERα mRNA was much stronger than that of ERβ mRNA in the gonads and Müllerian ducts (embryonic oviducts) in early embryos. By contrast, ERβ seemed to be predominantly expressed in regions of the embryonic brain that are associated with male sexual behavior. Embryos were exposed to the selective ERα agonists propyl-pyrazole-triol (PPT) and 16 α-lactone-estradiol (16 α-LE 2). The estrogens 17 β-estradiol (E 2) and 17 α-ethynylestradiol (EE 2), which activate both ERα and ERβ, were used as <b>positive</b> <b>controls.</b> All <b>substances</b> impaired reproductive organ differentiation. The effects observed included oviductal malformations in females and partial development of oviducts in males. All substances also induced testis feminization (ovotestis) in male embryos. The male copulatory behavior was severely impaired by the <b>positive</b> <b>controls</b> but was unaffected by PPT and 16 α-LE 2 at doses that disrupted sex organ differentiation. A higher dose of 16 α-LE 2 significantly suppressed the behavior. However, it is possible that this effect was caused by cross-activation of ERβ. The substances also induced hepatic expression of mRNA encoding the egg-yolk proteins vitellogenin II and very low-density apolipoprotein II, which are commonly used as indicators of estrogen exposure. In conclusion, the results suggest that ERα is important for female reproductive organ differentiation. Excess activation of ERα by xenoestrogens impairs differentiation in both females and males and induces hepatic expression of egg-yolk proteins. The results also indicate that ERα alone cannot mediate demasculinization of male copulatory behavior in quail, although further studies are needed to test this hypothesis...|$|R
