5|$|In June 2008, Apple {{was named}} among others as a {{defendant}} in a suit brought by plaintiff Typhoon Touch Technologies in the federal U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging patent infringement in portable touch screen technology. The suit illustrated the vagaries of litigating <b>patent</b> <b>licensing</b> and royalty collection issues in the commercial exploitation of intellectual property rights. Ultimately, Typhoon could not prevail against patent defense arguments of prior art and obviousness and earned itself {{a reputation as a}} patent troll. Typhoon acquired two pre-existing patents, (filed in 1993 and 1994 and issued in 1995 and 1997), in mid-2007 for $350,000 plus a percentage of collected licensing fees. The patents had languished for some time and were not being policed; shortly after Typhoon acquired the patents, it began enforcement by bringing suit against exploiters of the technology who had not paid licensing fees. Typhoon was successful in its patent infringement suits against some small companies, and then expanded its litigation to go after larger ones. Typhoon alleged that Apple and others used its patented technology inventions without permission. Typhoon originally filed the suit in December 2007 against Dell after settling with some smaller companies but, in mid-2008, amended its complaint to add Apple, Fujitsu, Toshiba, Lenovo, Panasonic, HTC, Palm, Samsung, Nokia, and LG. In 2010, Apple settled with Typhoon for an undisclosed sum and was then dismissed from the litigation as of September 2010. The other large companies were able to rebuff Typhoon's claims, and Typhoon ceased doing business in 2008 after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) suspended its trading in a fraud investigation.|$|E

40|$|<b>Patent</b> <b>license</b> is {{established}} when the patent owner allows {{the other party}} to exercise rights granted under the patent grant based on the terms specified in the <b>patent</b> <b>license</b> contract. However, there is no standard form of <b>patent</b> <b>license</b> contract and hence, parties are left with their own discretion to decide the terms {{to be included in}} the <b>patent</b> <b>license.</b> The freedom to include terms in the <b>patent</b> <b>license</b> led parties to expand their rights via inclusion of anti-competitive provisions in the <b>patent</b> <b>license.</b> Thus, competition law authority plays its role in determining whether terms included in the <b>patent</b> <b>license</b> affects competition process. In fact, <b>patent</b> <b>license</b> is expected to comply with regulations set by the competition law authority if it contains provisions which are anti-competitive in nature. This research evaluates the legal mechanisms employed by the Malaysia and EU competition authority in order to establish whether the mechanisms have adequately address issues relating to competition law in <b>patent</b> <b>license.</b> It also seeks to identify problems surrounding the <b>patent</b> <b>license</b> contract and explores how it affects the competition law. The findings indicate that while Malaysia has the basic legal mechanism to implement competition law in <b>patent</b> <b>license,</b> which is Competition Act 2010, but review of the Competition Act 2010 and additional legal mechanisms such as Guidelines are necessary to cater the needs arising from the <b>patent</b> <b>license...</b>|$|R
