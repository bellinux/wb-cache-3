40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{methods to}} determine additional loads bolts susceptible to fatigue-T connections. The {{reason for this}} exercise is the desire to increase the level of knowledge in this area. There is very little in literature and standards on this subject. The target {{of the study was}} to gain overview of existing formulas to calculate <b>prying</b> <b>forces</b> in T-connections subjected to dynamic loads. The results should be compared against analysis in Ansys Workbench. If possible, it would also be prepared separate formulas that would be verified against Ansys Workbench. It should also draw up a supervisor who showed step by step how an analysis of additional forces could be estimated in Ansys Workbench. It has been carried out literature studies of screw charts, calculations of <b>prying</b> <b>forces</b> and fatigue standards to get an overview of the effects that affected screw. To test out theories it have been set up models in Ansys. These have been tried up against theory of both <b>prying</b> <b>forces</b> and screw chart. The studies of the screw charts has led to two main theories. One calculating the compressed parts using pressure cone, Shigly [2] and the other uses a cylinder, Waløen [1]. It turns out that the theory that uses pressure cone coincides best with Ansys results. This is also much more complicated to use. Evidence indicates that Ansys analysis is very conservative, yet both methods fall conservatively into practice. Evidence indicates that, since the method of cylinder is mostly used in Norway. The studies of <b>prying</b> <b>forces</b> has headed to two equations which predict <b>prying</b> <b>forces</b> and the smallest flange thickness these formulas apply. The formulas are very similar in their structure, but one is more conservative than the other. It's just the most conservative formula that provides opportunities for fatigue analysis. These fatigue analysis is also little nuanced and provides only the result that says less than 20, 000 cycles, between 20, 000 and 500, 000 and over 500, 000 cycles, screw guide [3]. From these data, it constructed a fatigue curve to compare with Ansys analyzes. These comparisons do not coincide very well. More factors than <b>prying</b> <b>forces</b> play a role when we look at fatigue. By <b>prying</b> <b>forces</b> we also get a bending effect in the screw. This often generate bending stresses which give almost equally large changes inn stress range in many cases, as <b>prying</b> <b>forces</b> alone. Of fatigue standards it has been looked in to DNV-RP-C 203 [6] and EN 1993 - 1 - 9 [5]. The literature does not say anything about witch fatigue curve that is suitable if you have <b>prying</b> <b>forces.</b> DNV-RP-C 203; W 2 and EN 1993 - 1 - 9; 40 is used in this report. These curves are also almost identical. The formulas for <b>prying</b> <b>forces</b> don’t say anything about stress range. It is actually stress range who is used in the fatigue standards. It's also bean created formulas to calculate the lifetime of bolts by susceptible to fatigue T-pieces based on the formulas that have been examined in the report. This formula publishes stress range, so it can be used with fatigue standards. The result of the comparison with Ansys, gives a curve on the conservative side. This formulas is very extensive and complicated, so it is relatively easy to get a calculation error along the way. Finally, it has bean produced a guide to determine stress range in Ansys. The model in this guide is design so all dimensions can be changed easily inside Ansys. This makes it possible to calculate models with other dimensions than the model initially...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Within {{construction}} industry developing rapidly in domestic, long span buildings and high-rise buildings emerge in endlessly. Steel tubular structures are increasingly widely used for its unique advantages. Thanks to the situation, flange-plate connections {{become more and}} more popular as an important solution of splicing steel tubular structures. The connections provide easy and fast installation, nice shape, simple constitution for tubular structures without the need for welding. Typical loading situations include axial tension force and moment for flange-plate connections. The loading capacity under axial tension was studied by many scholars. Unfortunately, study on flexural capacity of flange-plate connections is limited. This situation limits the generalization of the nice connections. As {{can be seen from the}} review on flange-plate connections, there is no doubt that doing research on flexural capacity of flange-plate connections is necessary. Previous studies on axial loading capacity of flange-plate connections can provide helpful options of research for this work. One of the options is to observe the <b>prying</b> <b>forces</b> caused by flange-plates ’ deformation, for prying is an important influencing factor on axial loading capacity of flange-plate connections which can reduce capacity of the connection. It is same as axial loading case that <b>prying</b> <b>forces</b> exists in the tensil...|$|E
30|$|To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} bending stiffness of bolt on prying force, comparison has been made between FE 4 and A 1 m connection models in which bolt diameters (d b) are taken to be 19.05  mm (3 / 4  in.) and 22.23  mm (7 / 8  in.), respectively, and pretension force is taken to be 40  % of the ultimate strength of bolt keeping the other parameters and material properties the same. It is observed from Fig.  11 b that prying force develops very similarly in both connection models {{at the beginning of}} loading, but near the ultimate state, connection model with larger bolt diameter develops higher <b>prying</b> <b>forces.</b>|$|E
30|$|In {{the cases}} of Type I and Type II mechanisms, {{it is assumed that}} the <b>prying</b> <b>force</b> {{develops}} in between the centerline of bolt hole and the top edge of the top angle (Ahmed and Hasan 2015), and the <b>prying</b> <b>force</b> and beam flange force (hereinafter, indicated as shear force) are determined considering the location of the <b>prying</b> <b>force</b> and the plastic moment capacity at the plastic hinges of the top angle. The least value of shear force among those estimated from these three mechanisms is taken as the shear resistance of a given connection and is used to evaluate the ultimate moment capacity of that connection.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} paper is the {{experimental}} and numerical investigation of the unilateral contact effect to the structural response of top and seated angle with double web angle bolted connections. The experimental study {{is focused on the}} study of ductility, deformability, moment capacity, bolts prying force and contact zone of these connections. Six full-scale top and seat angles with double web angle bolted connections were tested. Static vertical load was applied until the specimens to reach a condition that cannot resist any additional load after that. In parallel, a finite element analysis was developed to simulate the aforementioned test and in particular, to determine the contact area between the top angles with the column flange, given rise to additional forces, the so-called <b>prying</b> <b>forces.</b> The finite element results were compared to the experimental ones and to those derived theoretically from the application of a model that recently has been proposed in the literature...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} usual choices for the {{connection}} between the different structural members in steel structures is the bolted connection. The later provide a high level of deformation capacity for the whole structure and a level of stiffness comparable to that of fully welded connections. Top and seated angle with double web angle bolted connections are primarily used for beam-to-column joints. The most important factor for the structural response of beam-tocolumn connections is the rotational stiffness because it affects the behavior of the overall structural steel frame. For this purpose, many experimental tests have been recently conducted to obtain moment-rotation curves. Considering the moment-rotation curves obtained from experimental tests, a simplified analytical model has been suggested to predict the behavior of the connection by fitting techniques. The aim of the present paper is, from one side, the development of a moment-rotation curve for bolted top and seat angle connection with double web angle by means of a proposed theoretical model whose validity checked by comparison with experimental data, and from the other side, the determination of the appearing <b>prying</b> <b>forces</b> in the bolts by means of a simplified and reliable model...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{parts of}} {{results of an}} experimental research project {{on the behavior of}} end-plate connections subjected to monotonic and cyclic loading conducted at _Istanbul Technical University. This re-search project consists of standard and innovative end-plate connections in that the short I-shaped element (actually cut from the beam section) was placed between the end plate and the column flange. The connec-tions were designed for one of two limit states. In the rst limit state, the end plate was designed to be the weakest element of the component for connections with a thin end plate. In addition, these connections were designed as partial strength connections with a moment capacity that resists less than 80 % of the plastic moment capacity of the connected beams. In the second limit state, end-plate thickness was varied in order to minimize possible <b>prying</b> <b>forces</b> and the connection, which was designed as a full strength connection having a design resistance at least equal to that of the connected beam. The maximum moments obtained experimentally were compared with predicted moments. Three end-plate moment connection congurations were classied in one of three categories depending on the amount of inelastic rotation at the connections. Results show clearly that the innovative connections satisfy the basic criteria: sucient strength, sucient rotation capacity and adequate stiness for a moment connection...|$|E
30|$|Initial {{pretension}} forces applied on models A 1 Po, FE 5, A 1 m, and FE 6 are 0, 20, 40, and 60  % of {{the ultimate}} strength of bolt, respectively, {{and all the other}} properties are kept similar. In Fig.  11, the vertical difference in between two similar lines such as short dash and short dash with solid circle defines the magnitude of <b>prying</b> <b>force</b> corresponding to the shear force (tension flange force) for each bolt. It can be observed in Fig.  11 a that bolt tensile forces of corresponding models starting from different levels of pretensioning get closer as external load increases, and ultimately meet in the same point. Thus, <b>prying</b> <b>force</b> near the ultimate level of loading is not affected by the magnitude of pretension force. At the higher level of loading, contact force due to pretensioning of bolts is entirely neutralized, and only <b>prying</b> <b>force</b> is retained.|$|R
30|$|Reduction of {{flange angle}} {{thickness}} or increment of gage {{distance from the}} angle heel to the centerline of bolt hole can increase the magnitude of <b>prying</b> <b>force.</b>|$|R

40|$|A cast modular {{connector}} (MC) {{has been}} developed for use in seismic-resistant steel moment frames. The MC is a field bolted beam flange connection intended {{to serve as the}} frame's special energy-dissipating detail. The connector is specifically configured for optimal seismic performance through a casting process. The MC possesses inherent ductility through variable-section arms that minimize plastic strain demand and a reliable yet economical fastening method through a base end-region that virtually eliminates <b>prying</b> <b>forces</b> on bolts. The dissertation presents three journal papers. The first paper describes the portion of the analytical research focused on establishing the optimum geometry for the energy dissipating arm elements. Key parameters were evaluated through parametric studies using nonlinear (material and geometry) finite element analysis and supported by basic theoretical models. The outcome was a set of optimum geometric ratios covering width reduction, length to thickness, aspect ratio, and fillet radius. The second paper describes the development process of the isolated connector rather than full-connection behavior. Designs were alternately evaluated for structural performance and castability through the electronic exchange of solid model files with steel foundry industry partners. The analytical results indicate the potential for excellent ductility and energy dissipation characteristics in the MC Beta prototype. The third paper focuses on the prototyping and experimental verification of the MC Beta prototype. Steel foundry industry partners cast the MC Beta prototype at approximately half-scale. The scaled MC Beta prototype was tested in isolated fashion under monotonic and cyclic loading. The experimental results confirmed the performance of the analytically-based designs. The MC Beta prototype exhibited exceptional performance in terms of stable energy dissipation, far exceeding qualifying rotational ductility capacities. In direct comparisons to a WT section of similar stiffness and strength, the MC Beta prototype possessed greatly enhanced ductility and energy dissipation characteristics. With the MC Beta prototype developed and experimentally verified under isolated conditions, an experimental verification of beam-to-column joints containing the scaled MCs were performed using accepted testing protocols. The preliminary test results indicate that the connection exceeded qualifying rotational ductility capacities and showed promise as a special energy-dissipating detail in seismic-resistant steel moment frames...|$|E

30|$|Nonlinear {{finite element}} (FE) static {{analyses}} of top- and seat-angle connections were performed using ABAQUS standard {{to investigate the}} influence of connection parameters and its properties on prying action developed due to the interaction between column flange and top angle’s vertical leg. Contact phenomenon between two interfaces with finite sliding and bolt pretension in the initial step of analysis was considered in the FE model. FE analysis results were compared with the experimental ones to examine {{the applicability of the}} FE model. Then, the location of plastic hinges in connection assemblages was investigated at the ultimate state of the connection and a parametric study was performed varying connection parameters, material properties of connection assemblages, and magnitude of bolt pretension to visualize their effects on <b>prying</b> <b>force</b> and on the position of <b>prying</b> <b>force</b> on top angle’s vertical leg. Current study shows that plastic hinges not only develop at top angle’s heel and bolt hole region but also in the bolt shank that differs from some assumptions of power model (Kishi and Chen 1990): (1) top angle thickness and gage distance from angle heel to bolt hole center line have an distinct effect on prying action; and (2) distributed <b>prying</b> <b>force</b> developed near the region of the top edge of tension angle’s leg adjacent to column flange can contribute to the failure of the connection. Finally, a mathematical formulation to identify the location of <b>prying</b> <b>force</b> action point is proposed.|$|R

This table also shows that the performance of Eq. (3) over Eq. (2) estimating b distance demonstrates superior in eleven cases, equal in three cases and inferior in only two cases. In addition, the maximum and minimum discrepancies in b distance calculation by Eq. (3) are 11.4 and − 5.3  %, respectively. Corresponding discrepancies obtained using Eq. (2) are 13.8 and − 5.4  %, respectively. However, Eq. (2) is simpler as it uses only one parameter: tension angle thickness. But Eq. (3) shows superior results because of inclusion of more connection parameters to predict the distance of <b>prying</b> <b>force</b> from the center line of bolt hole of top angle’s vertical leg. However, overestimation of the value of b using Eq. (3) may be as high as 11.4  %. Overestimation of distance b (in other words leads to conservative design) by the proposed equations could slightly decrease the predicted strength of the connections.|$|R

40|$|International audienceL-stubs are {{commonly}} used to model the tensile parts of ring flange bolted connections. Contact between opposite flanges has {{a significant effect on}} the elastic and plastic behaviour of these tensile joints. In the present paper, the effects of contact between flange plates are modelled via a refined beam model which has been previously applied with success to represent the elastic behaviour of non-preloaded L-stubs and T-stubs. Taking into account the behaviour of the flange in the contact area and bolt bending, a model is developed to predict the plastic resistance of L-stub joints. Simplifications are proposed to facilitate the determination of the contact zone and the ultimate resistances corresponding to failure modes involving flange and bolt. The comparison between analytical results with 3 D finite element elasto-plastic analyses and experimental tests indicates that the proposed model provides good capacity predictions. Effects of contact, and therefore of the <b>prying</b> <b>force,</b> are particularly important in the case of relatively thin flanges. © 201...|$|R

30|$|In the AISC-ASD specifications, top- and seat-angle {{connections}} {{are treated as}} connections intended only for transferring beam shear force. However, experimental evidence and the present study on the connections show that besides transferring beam shear force, this type of connection transfers fairly considerable beam end moment to the column. When transferring this moment through the top angle to the column, an increase in tensile force is incurred in the bolts due to local deformation of the top angle’s vertical leg. This additional tensile force {{is commonly known as}} the <b>prying</b> <b>force</b> (Q in Fig.  4). Recently, researchers have paid serious attention to this additional force in their mathematical representation of connection behavior. Initially, the T-stub modeling concept has been used for designing extended end plate connections and modified for use to design angle type of connections (Faella et al. 1996; CEN 1997). However, the T-stub model is not accurate enough to represent actual deformation pattern of true angle type of connections at failure, and may not correctly estimate the connection strength.|$|R
30|$|Figure  8 a {{shows that}} contact {{pressure}} is almost uniformly developed {{on the back}} of the top angle’s vertical leg under the bolt head area by the bolt tightening force and the contact nodal forces are moved to the upper area of the left-hand side of vertical leg as the connection moment increased up to the plastic range (Fig.  8 b, c). The contact pressure distribution on the column surface facing top angle’s vertical leg is accumulated at the upper area of the left-hand side of vertical leg. The resultant force due to the contact pressure is determined by summing up nodal forces developed on the contact surface that was defined as slave surface in contact definition between the two surfaces. This resultant is located in the contact area at a distance b from the centerline of bolt hole at the ultimate state of the connection (Fig.  9). It should be noted that this contact pressure resultant at the ultimate state of a connection should be considered as the <b>prying</b> <b>force.</b>|$|R
3000|$|Accordingly, in the 80 s and 90 s, {{available}} moment-rotation {{models were}} modified and improved by incorporating more realistic representation of prying action (Kishi and Chen 1986, 1990; Faella et al. 1996; CEN 1997). Kishi and Chen’s (1990) connection model (named as power model) considered bending and shear deformations of the angle, but disregarded deformation of bolts for deriving the ultimate moment capacity of angle type of connections. To establish a rational prediction model for precise {{representation of the}} M–θ [...] r [...] curves of the connections, the effect of prying action on connection behavior should not be ignored. In this context, FE analyses were performed to investigate the contribution of prying action in moment-rotation behavior (Ahmed 2002; Komuro et al. 2006). The places of plastic zones, effect of connection parameters on prying action and the magnitude and location of prying action are also examined for tracing a failure mechanism of the connection. Finally, based on the FE analysis and experimental results (Azizinamini et al. 1985; Harper 1990), an equation determining the location of <b>prying</b> <b>force</b> at the final load level is suggested for general application of estimating the ultimate moment capacity of the connection.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Connections {{are vital}} in {{affecting}} {{the safety of}} steel structures and connection failure {{is one of the}} main causes of structural collapse. Bolt connections are a dominant means of connecting structural members. In the design of bolt connections in steel structures, the effects of prying action on the connected parts and bolts should be considered because use of thick base plates to avoid its consideration results in lack of connection ductility which is undesirable. Although equations are available for prying action in Chinese, AISC and HK manuals or codes, they suffer some deficiencies. To develop a better design method for extended end-plate bolt connection, design formulae in several codes are discussed and compared in this paper. The paper further proposes revision for the current formulae in codes and suggests design formulae for bending moment in bolts and in end-plate. The equations are validated with rigorous finite element results, which show that the proposed method has a satisfactory accuracy for calculation of <b>prying</b> <b>force</b> and bending moment. Further, the suggested equations have the advantages over current methods in the provision of a systematic design for end-plate connection.

30|$|Semi-rigid {{connections}} are receiving considerable {{interest in the}} research community because of their easy installation in steel frames and energy-dissipating capability under reversal loading (Elnashi et al. 1998; Shen and Astaneh-Asl 1999; Garlock et al. 2003; Pirmoz 2006; Cheol and Young 2007). Understanding the viability of these connections in practice, AISC (2001, 2010) adopted top- and seat-angle connections into the design specifications to transfer only the beam-shear force to the column. However, experimental evidences and the author’s past studies on the connections exposed that besides transferring beam-shear force, this type of connections transferred fairly significant beam-end-moment to the column. When transferring the moment through the top angle to the column, an increase in tensile force occurred in the bolts due to local deformation of the top angle’s vertical leg. This additional tensile force {{is commonly known as}} <b>prying</b> <b>force.</b> A few researchers have paid serious attention to this additional force in their mathematical representation of connection behaviour. The most recent stiffness modelling technique that includes individual elements behaviour reformed in equivalent T-stub connection model for both extended end plate connections and angle type of connections following the modelling technique of Weynand et al. (1995) has been adopted in Eurocode 3 (CEN 2005). However, the T-stub model is somehow different in respect to interaction with the actual deformation pattern of true angle type of connections at failure and may loose its efficiency in estimation of connection strength. So, precise understanding about interaction among connection components on moment–rotation behaviour is required to represent a straightforward and accurate mechanical model of the connection.|$|R
