40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to develop a new product in the form of handouts <b>television</b> <b>receiver</b> system at SMK Piri 1 Yogyakarta. Another {{purpose of this}} study was to determine the feasibility of the development stage and <b>television</b> <b>receiver</b> system handouts according to the Education Unit Level Curriculum (SBC) at SMK PIRI 1 Yogyakarta. The method used is the method of research and development ((Research and Development)). New product development in the form of handouts subjects <b>television</b> <b>receiver</b> system through several stages, namely (1) a preliminary study, (2) planning, (3) development of initial product, (4) the revised design, (5) the initial field trials, (6) Revision I, (7) main field trials; (8) revision II; (9) operational field trials; (10) Revision of the final product, and (11) improve the product. The research was conducted at the Department of Mechanical Grade XI Audio Video SMK PIRI 1 Yogyakarta. Data was collected using instruments such as questionnaires. The analysis technique used is the qualitative and quantitative analysis to determine the feasibility study handout <b>television</b> <b>receiver</b> system. The results of this study were produced in the form of instructional media shaped products subject handout <b>television</b> <b>receiver</b> system. Based on the syllabus, standards and basic competencies materials then developed into three (3) pieces handout. Subject matter of each handout, namely (1) handout 1 : explained the working principle of the <b>television</b> <b>receiver</b> and everything that stuff, explaining parts - the parts and functions of a <b>television</b> <b>receiver,</b> (2) a handout 2 : explain the working principle of black and white TV and color, (3) handout (3) : describes the kind of - kind of a <b>television</b> <b>receiver.</b> Test the feasibility of the learning handouts <b>television</b> <b>receiver</b> system that was developed, in the judgment of matter expert lecturers earn an average overall score of 4 with good assessment criteria, teachers Audio Video Engineering Program as matter experts earned an average overall score of 3. 58 with the assessment criteria well, from one media experts earned an average overall score of 4. 05 with a good assessment criteria, from two media specialists earned an average overall score of 4. 05 with the criteria of good judgment, and of the field test to obtain an average overall score amounted to 4. 10 with assessment criteria well. Handout eligibility standards if the average overall score of not less than the minimum standard of good. Based on these data it can be concluded that the handout <b>television</b> <b>receiver</b> system at SMK Piri 1 Yogyakarta already well developed so it is worth using.
