2500|$|The final {{document}} {{of the conference}} was titled [...] "For Peace, Security, Cooperation and Social Progress in Europe". The document contained several novelties compared to previous practices in the world communist movement. One {{of the most prominent}} features of the document was the recognition of the principle of [...] "equality and independence of all communist parties and their right to decide their own policies without external interference". The Soviet party had thus, at least in theory, conceded to the Eurocommunist demands for the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-interference</b> in the affairs of other parties. The document carried no mention of Marxism-Leninism, instead there was a reference to the 'great ideas' of Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels and V. I. Lenin. References to 'proletarian internationalism' were substituted with the term 'international solidarity'. Moreover, the document stated that fraternal criticism between communist parties would not constitute anti-communism (implying that criticism of Soviet policies would not be considered as 'anti-Sovietism', as the official Soviet discourse had argued). The document was not approved through signature or a vote, it was simply issued, a fact later criticized by the Yugoslavs.|$|E
2500|$|... – On 15 March, the Argentine {{representative}} to the UN Security Council, Maria Cristina Perceval, {{voted in favor of}} a US-sponsored resolution condemning 16 March referendum. She elaborated that she had voted in favour of the resolution because it asserted the principle of territorial integrity and would have contributed to constructive dialogue towards a peaceful solution involving all political actors. While urging refraining from actions that would hamper such a solution, she said it was indeed for Ukrainians to decide their own affairs. It was not for the Council to define the situation, but rather, to maintain international peace and security. [...] Argentina hoped all countries would respect the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-interference</b> in State affairs."On 19 March, during a press conference in Paris, Argentine President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner accused Western Powers of 'double standards' for [...] condemning the referendum in Crimea but supporting the referendum in the Falkland Islands (an overseas territory of the UK [...] which is claimed by Argentina but whose people voted for British sovereignty in 2013). President Putin later called Fernández to thank her for her support. Argentina went on to abstain in the vote on United Nations General Assembly Resolution 68/262.|$|E

Whether a man is Christian, Mahometan, or Jew is a question of no public concern, so long as he obeys the laws; and the laws ought to be such as men of all religions can obey. Yet even here there are limits. No civilized state would tolerate a religion demanding human sacrifice. The English in India put an end to suttee, in spite of a fixed <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-interference</b> with native religious customs. Perhaps they were wrong to prevent suttee, yet almost every European would have done the same.

50|$|The accords {{emerged from}} {{initiatives}} by Moscow and Kabul in 1981. They had claimed that Soviet forces had entered Afghanistan {{in order to}} protect it from foreign forces intervening on the side of rebels attempting to overthrow the DRA. The logic of the Geneva Accords was based on this accusation, that is, that once the foreign threat to Afghanistan was removed, the forces of its friend, the Soviet Union, would leave. For that reason a bilateral agreement between Pakistan, which was actively supporting the resistance, and the DRA prohibiting intervention and interference between them was essential. In meticulous detail each party agreed to terminate any act that could remotely affect the sovereignty or security of the other. This agreement included preventing an expatriate or a refugee from publishing a statement which his/her government could construe as a contribution to unrest within its territory. The bilateral agreement between the Afghanistan and Pakistan on the <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-interference</b> and non-intervention was signed on April 14, 1988.|$|R

40|$|East Asia has a {{long history}} of {{genocide}} and mass atrocities. For much of the Cold War, East Asia was one of the world's most violent regions, experiencing multiple outbursts of mass killing. Since the end of the Cold War, however, the region has been transformed thanks to another Asian miracle. There are now fewer cases of genocide and mass atrocities in East Asia today than at any point in history for which we have reliable records. This article demonstrates and then tries to account for the dramatic decline of mass atrocities in East Asia. It argues that the decline was enabled by a combination of three major structural changes: reduction in the selection of mass atrocities as a weapon of war, increase in incomes, and progress towards democratization combined with the emergence of new ideas about sovereignty and their accommodation with existing <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-interference.</b> Together, these structural and ideational changes created a changed regional context of increased costs and reduced payoffs for the commission of mass atrocities.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the governance of}} the minority at the micro-level in late colonial India. While the colonial production of micro-level state authority was inescapably conditioned by numerous political struggles between colonial subjects, {{the centrality of the}} minority in this story of state formation and citizen making is missing from most conventional descriptions of colonial governmental rationality. This study argues that the specifically colonial formulation of the minority as a figure to be both protected and inserted on to the path to modern citizenship shaped the regulation of customary modes of charity and inheritance as well as the regulation of local government power itself. Indeed, the dual commitment to protecting and modernizing of the minority constituted the micro-level state as arbiter: absolute in its judgment in cases of conflict between subjects, even though this authority was predicated on the <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-interference</b> and deliberation. by Shiben Banerji.

40|$|It {{is often}} {{argued that the}} {{increase}} in agreements, specialized courts, and litigation protecting human rights or responding to past abuses of human rights has begun to erode sovereignty. Contrary to traditional <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-interference</b> in internal affairs, it is argued, genuine protection of human rights involves an invasion of the sovereign preserve of the state. While many examples might be adduced in support of this claim, ranging from the ad hoc criminal tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda to the European Court of Human Rights, this article examines two types of transnational procedures: civil accountability through the use of the Alien Tort Claims Act in the US, and criminal accountability through the exercise of universal jurisdiction in a number of European countries. This article suggests that even in situations where courts of one country are in essence sitting in judgment upon actions taken by state officials in other countries, significant protections of sovereignty remain. Specifically, state and official immunity remain significant obstacles to pursuit of key rights abusers. These immunities, recently re-affirmed by the International Court of Justice in the DRC v. Belgium case, are also routinely respected by national courts...|$|R
