With the Bayesian network theory, combined the energy consumptions of unit production and indicators of air quality, energy consumption on the contribution to air quality from the various industrial sectors were analyzed in Ningbo. The results showed that the energy consumptions from five industrial sectors and GDP/capital directly affected on comprehensive air pollution index, while there was a direct causal relationship between GDP/capital and energy consumptions in five industrial sectors. The results implied that, for comprehensive air pollution index, the contribution from the <b>petroleum,</b> <b>coking</b> and nuclear fuel processes was larger. The sectors of the <b>petroleum,</b> <b>coking</b> and nuclear fuel processes and NOX from vehicle made more contributions on the NO 2. Meanwhile, the <b>petroleum,</b> <b>coking</b> and nuclear fuel processes and chemical raw materials and chemical products sectors gave more contributions on the SO 2. For the TSP and acid rain rate, the sector of the <b>petroleum,</b> <b>coking</b> and nuclear fuel processes was key contributor.

40|$|In {{this study}} the total coal {{consumption}} changed {{in recent years}} and the data on energy consumptions of different type energy resources were collected and analyzed. The CO 2 emissions from different main industrial sectors and in different districts were calculated based on the data in Ningbo in 2007. According to the calculation results the CO 2 emissions patterns and characteristics were studied. Research results showed that the unprocessed coal was the main energy resource consumed in Ningbo and the total CO 2 emission from Ningbo’s main enterprises in 2007 was almost 5 times compared with in 2000. The consumption of the unprocessed coal was mainly consumed at Beilun District among 11 districts in Ningbo and Beilun was the most serious emission region with 44. 06 % proportion of total CO 2 emitted from the main pollution enterprise. In terms of the relationship between CO 2 emission and industrial sector, the CO 2 emission mainly from Production and Supply of Electric Power and Heat Power, reached 66. 90 %, followed by Processing of <b>Petroleum,</b> <b>Coking,</b> Processing of Nuclear Fuel.

40|$|Understanding of the {{influencing}} factors of industrial sector {{carbon dioxide emissions}} is essential to reduce natural and anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. In this paper, we applied the Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) decomposition method based on the extended Kaya identity to analyze the changes in industrial carbon dioxide emissions resulting from 39 industrial sectors in Inner Mongolia northeast of China over the period 2003 – 2012. The factors were divided into five types of effects i. e., industrial growth effect, industrial structure effect, energy effect, energy intensity effect, population effect and comparative analysis of differential influences of various factors on industrial sector. Our results clearly show that (1) Industrial sector carbon dioxide emissions have increased from 134. 00 million ton in 2003 to 513. 46 million ton in 2012, with an annual average growth rate of 16. 097 %. The industrial carbon dioxide emissions intensity has decreased from 0. 99 million ton/billion yuan to 0. 28 million ton/billion yuan. Also, the energy structure {{has been dominated by}} coal; (2) Production and supply of electric power, steam and hot water, coal mining and dressing, smelting and pressing of ferrous metals, <b>petroleum</b> processing, <b>coking</b> and nuclear fuel processing, and raw chemical materials and chemical products account for 89. 74 % of total increased industrial carbon dioxide emissions; (3) The industrial growth effect and population effect are found to be a critical driving force for increasing industrial sector carbon dioxide emissions over the research period. The energy intensity effect is the crucial drivers of the decrease of carbon dioxide emissions. However, the energy structure effect and industrial structure effect have considerably varied over the study years without displaying any clear trend...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- The R&D {{spillover}} effect in China is analyzed {{in this paper}} by input-output technology, based on the 1999 input-output table of China with 40 sectors. First, the backward and forward R&D-flow-coefficient-matrix are defined and computed. Second, some important indexes derived from R&D-flow-coefficients-matrixes, MCR&D, SCR&D, and MDR&D, are computed and analyzed to show the inter-industry R&D spillovers. The main results are as follows. Generally, there are three kinds of sectors: 1) some sectors have large R&D spillover to other sectors, while accept little spillover from other sectors, such as scientific research, petroleum and natural gas extraction, metals mining and dressing, chemicals industry, etc; 2) some sectors have almost equivalent R&D spillover flowing from other industries with respect to dedicating to other industries, such as <b>petroleum</b> refining and <b>coking,</b> electronic and telecommunications, production and supply of power steam and hot water, transport equipment, etc; 3) other sectors, such as agriculture, coal mining and processing, metal products, accept more R&D spillover flow than dedicating to other sectors. The high-technological industries, such as IT industry, chemicals industry, and scientific research, have high R&D spillovers in the economy of China...|$|R
40|$|Refinery {{processes}} that convert heavy oils to lighter distillate fuels require heating for distillation, hydrogen addition or carbon rejection (coking). Efficiency {{is limited by}} the formation of insoluble carbon-rich coke deposits. Heat exchangers and other refinery units must be shut down for mechanical coke removal, resulting in a significant loss of output and revenue. When a residuum is heated above the temperature at which pyrolysis occurs (340 C, 650 F), there is typically an induction period before coke formation begins (Magaril and Aksenova 1968, Wiehe 1993). To avoid fouling, refiners often stop heating a residuum before coke formation begins, using arbitrary criteria. In many cases, this heating is stopped sooner than need be, resulting in less than maximum product yield. Western Research Institute (WRI) has developed innovative Coking Index concepts (patent pending) which can be used for process control by refiners to heat residua to the threshold, but not beyond the point at which coke formation begins when petroleum residua materials are heated at pyrolysis temperatures (Schabron et al. 2001). The development of this universal predictor solves a long standing problem in <b>petroleum</b> refining. These <b>Coking</b> Indexes have great potential value in improving the efficiency of distillation processes. The Coking Indexes were found to apply to residua in a universal manner, and the theoretical basis for the indexes has been established (Schabron et al. 2001 a, 2001 b, 2001 c). For the first time, a few simple measurements indicates how close undesired coke formation is on the coke formation induction time line. The Coking Indexes can lead to new process controls that can improve refinery distillation efficiency by several percentage points. Petroleum residua consist of an ordered continuum of solvated polar materials usually referred to as asphaltenes dispersed in a lower polarity solvent phase held together by intermediate polarity materials usually referred to as resins. The Coking Indexes focus on the amount of these intermediate polarity species since coke formation begins when these are depleted. Currently the Coking Indexes are determined by either titration or solubility measurements which must be performed in a laboratory. In the current work, various spectral, microscopic, and thermal techniques possibly leading to on-line analysis were explored for measuring the Coking Indexes...|$|R
