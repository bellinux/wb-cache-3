40|$|In this paper, a {{comprehensive}} study of the the downlink performance in a heterogeneous cellular network (or hetnet) is conducted. A general hetnet model is considered consisting of an arbitrary number of open-access and closed-access tier of base stations (BSs) arranged according to independent homogeneous Poisson point processes. The BSs of each tier have a constant transmission power, random fading coefficient with an arbitrary distribution and arbitrary path-loss exponent of the power-law path-loss model. For such a system, analytical characterizations for the coverage probability and average rate at an arbitrary mobile-station (MS), and average per-tier load are derived for both the max-SINR connectivity and nearest-BS connectivity models. Using stochastic ordering, interesting properties and simplifications for the hetnet downlink performance are derived by relating these two connectivity models to the maximum instantaneous received <b>power</b> (MIRP) <b>connectivity</b> model and the maximum biased received <b>power</b> (MBRP) <b>connectivity</b> models, respectively, providing good insights about the hetnets and the downlink performance in these complex networks. Furthermore, the results also demonstrate the effectiveness and analytical tractability of the stochastic geometric approach to study the hetnet performance.

While these services promise unprecedented computing <b>power,</b> <b>connectivity,</b> convenience, and low cost, their construction is a challenging exercise [...] -examples of costly failures abound (e. g., [11, 19, 22]). It is difficult to build these services because they must support enormous loads (e. g., millions of users) without appreciable downtime over very long periods of time (e. g., years). Further, loads can have large peaks, and, unlike traditional large scale computing problems, the performance of these services are not described by their overall runtime but rather by their response time to individual user requests. In particular, predictable response time is critical because users' perceived quality of serv...|$|E

3000|$|The {{decreasing}} {{costs of}} computing <b>power,</b> <b>connectivity</b> and electronic components have facilitated the realisation {{of the vision}} of Internet of Things (IoT) and have created potential {{for all sorts of}} applications. Various media channels, the World Economic Forum (Schwab 2015) and academic researchers (Brynjolfsson and McAfee 2014) have claimed that a technology-driven revolution is underway that would change the way mankind lives and runs the economy. At the core of this revolution is the merger of physical and digital spaces as cyber-physical systems. “Cyber-physical systems (CPS) will transform how humans interact with and control the physical world” (Rajkumar et al. 2010). The term is defined as follows: “cyber-physical systems (CPS) are physical and engineered systems whose operations are monitored, coordinated, controlled and integrated by a computing and communication core” (Rajkumar et al. 2010). The communication capabilities of such systems drive the technological revolution because they allow multiple systems to be connected, thereby creating the IoT. The IoT paradigm {{is the result of the}} convergence of three perspectives: (1) thing-oriented, (2) Internet-oriented and (3) semantic-oriented (Atzori et al. 2010). In other words, physical things can be sensed or can sense data automatically (1). The data are then communicated automatically to other things or humans (2). The data are interpreted and evaluated automatically to derive meaning (3). These three perspectives help realise the vision of an Internet containing information about the physical world without depending on human input (Ashton 2009). Technological progress in the information and communication technology (ICT) domain has reduced the costs of computing <b>power,</b> <b>connectivity</b> and electronic components. This decrease has helped the IoT to become increasingly real and has created potential for a wide range of promising innovations. Unsurprisingly, there is a lot of hype about IoT (Burton and Walker 2015). Clearly, several IoT applications are appearing in domains such as smart homes, wearables and smart cities. Well-known IoT applications are often desirable consumer gadgets (e.g. colour-changing light balls or fitness trackers). Known applications with a positive economic or ecological impact remain scarce (e.g. parking or bin fill level monitoring) (SAS Institute Inc 2016). In industrial manufacturing enterprises of specialised and export-oriented economies, even fewer IoT-based innovations are known, despite the opportunities offered by various technological enablers. The question then is, what inhibits the development and deployment of IoT applications in industrial manufacturing enterprises and thus prevents potential innovations—missing motivation or existing inhibitors?

The suggested model uses a framework that harnesses the stateless and secure nature of JWT for client authentication and session management. Furthermore, authorized access to protected cloud SaaS resources have been efficiently managed. Accordingly, a Policy Match Gate (PMG) component and a Policy Activity Monitor (PAM) component have been introduced. In addition, other subcomponents such as a Policy Validation Unit (PVU) and a Policy Proxy DB (PPDB) have also been established for optimized service delivery.

Therefore, while in scenarios with line-of-sight (LOS) communications a graph-theoretic approach could be adequate for determining the minimum transmit <b>power</b> required for <b>connectivity,</b> in scenarios with strong multipath fading and/or multiple access interference a communication-theoretic approach could yield much more accurate results and, therefore, be preferable...|$|R

Decreasing costs of computing <b>power,</b> <b>connectivity</b> and electronic components have facilitated {{a wide range of}} innovations based on Internet of Things (IoT) applications. However, only few successful IoT applications specific to industrial manufacturing enterprises are known. Although academics have been investigating challenges related to realising IoT, existing literature does not explain this situation integrally. Therefore, interest and engagement in and motivators and inhibitors of IoT application development and deployment are investigated based on a literature review and empirically based on a survey with N= 109 participants from enterprises in the Swiss metal, electrical and machine industries. Most enterprises are interested and are often engaged in IoT application development. Improving service and aftersales activities through IoT applications is a common motivator. Inhibitors from four domains hinder the development of IoT applications: business, organisational, technological and industrial. Business and organisational inhibitors are perceived to be more challenging than the technological and industrial ones. The business and organisational issues presented herein have essential impacts on the success of innovation in IoT applications. The results indicate future research directions for the innovation and development of IoT applications, and they can be used by organisations interested in IoT-based innovations to refine policy and decision-making.|$|E
40|$|Mobile devices, such as {{mobile phones}} and {{personal}} digital assistants, have gained wide-spread popularity. These devices will increasingly be networked, thus enabling {{the construction of}} distributed applications that have to adapt to changes in context, such as variations in network bandwidth, battery <b>power,</b> <b>connectivity,</b> reachability of services and hosts, and so on. In this paper we describe CARISMA, a mobile computing middleware which exploits the principle of reflection to enhance the construction of adaptive and context-aware mobile applications. The middleware provides software engineers with primitives to describe how context changes should be handled using policies. These policies may conflict. We classify the di#erent types of conflicts that may arise in mobile computing and argue that conflicts cannot be resolved statically at the time applications are designed, but, rather, need to be resolved at execution time. We demonstrate a method by which policy conflicts can be handled; this method uses a micro-economic approach that relies on {{a particular type of}} sealed-bid auction. We describe how this method is implemented in the CARISMA middleware architecture, and sketch a distributed context-aware application for mobile devices to illustrate how the method works in practise. We show, by way of a systematic performance evaluation, that conflict resolution does not imply undue overheads, before comparing our research to related work and concluding the paper...|$|E
