The upgrade requires {{the changing of the}} <b>power</b> <b>module</b> on older engines and can be seamlessly inserted into future production engines at a minimal increase in unit cost and no impact to delivery schedule. The Growth Option 1 offers a improvement of 6-10% thrust across the F-35 flight envelope while also getting a 5-6% fuel burn reduction.|$|E
25|$|The {{working gas}} of a Brayton cycle can be helium, nitrogen, or carbon dioxide. The {{high-pressure}} working gas is expanded in a turbine to produce power. The low-pressure warm gas is cooled in an ambient cooler. The low-pressure cold gas is compressed to the high-pressure of the system. Often the turbine and the compressor are mechanically connected through a single shaft. High pressure Brayton cycles {{are expected to}} have a smaller generator footprint compared to lower pressure Rankine cycles. A Brayton cycle heat engine can operate at lower pressure with wider diameter piping. The world's first commercial Brayton cycle solar <b>power</b> <b>module</b> (100kW) was built and demonstrated in Israel's Arava Desert in 2009.|$|E

25|$|In many cases, a dimmer can be {{replaced}} by a constant <b>power</b> <b>module</b> (CPM), which is typically a 20- or 50-ampere breaker in a dimming module casing. CPMs are used to supply line voltage to non-dimming electrical devices such as smoke machines, chain winches, and scenic motors that require constant operating voltage. When a device is powered by a CPM, it is fully energized whenever the CPM is turned on, independent of lighting console levels. CPMs must be used (in lieu of dimmers) to power non-dimming devices that require specific line voltages (e.g., in the US, 110 V, 60Hz power) in order to avoid damage to such devices. Dimmers are seldom used to control non-dimming devices because even if a dimmer channel is trusted to always operate at full power, it may not be controlled when communications are disrupted by start up and shut down of the lighting control surface, noise interference, or DMX disconnects or failure. Such a loss of control might cause a dimmer to dim a circuit and thus potentially damage its non-dimming device.|$|E
500|$|Bizarro {{operates}} {{with three}} steel and fiberglass trains. Each train has eight cars that have four seats {{in a single}} row. When the ride was re-themed, the middle two seats of the last row were removed on each train to install a computer and <b>power</b> <b>module</b> for the on-board audio. This reduced {{the capacity of the}} trains from 32 to 30 riders per train. Each seat on every train has a speaker to the left and right of the rider. A recording of Bizarro, fighting and talking is played {{for the duration of the}} ride. Frequently, while the train is braked, waiting to enter the station platform, riders hear Bizarro chanting his name and [...] "Bizarro #1". For the 2013 season the on-board audio speakers were removed; there was some speculation towards the end of the current (2013) season that the audio equipment would be given to Six Flags America so that the park's stand-up roller coaster Apocalypse could be fitted with an audio track for the 2014 season.|$|E
