40|$|The flow of ions {{through a}} {{biological}} ion channel {{can be considered}} as transitions between occupied energy levels in the channel and either of the connecting bulk reservoirs [2]. Discreteness of ions and an electrostatic exclusion principle ensure that the number of channel energy levels equals the number of occupying ions. Using these fundamental physical principles we have recently introduced [1] an ionic Coulomb blockade (ICB) theory developed by analogy with the similar phenomenon of electron tunnelling in quantum dots [2, 3]. In this <b>picture</b> <b>channel</b> selectivity is governed by energy level changes [1]. We present details of the ICB theory for ion transitions through the channel. It incorporates physiological solutions and channel properties: physical dimension, voltage drop and fixed charge, and hence allows for comparison with physiological data. The set of kinetic equations obtained using ICB is analysed. The channel probability of occupancy as a function of transition rates (and hence fixed charge and number of ions) is obtained in the steady-state approximation. It is shown that this probability displays the staircase structure familiar from analysis of occupancy in quantum dots. It is also shown that current through the channel displays sharp peaks as a function of fixed charge, hence relating channel selectivity to the structure and position of energy levels. The contribution of hydration energy is also discussed. We anticipate that inclusion of this energy into ICB theory will provide an important insight into the selectivity and conductivity of ion channels...|$|E
40|$|SummaryBackroundThe aim of palliative {{treatment}} of advanced malignant tumours involving the hilus {{of the liver}} is to decompress mechanical jaundice. In some cases, percutaneous drainage of biliary ducts is the only possible effective treatment. The aim {{of this paper is}} to evaluate the results of palliative percutaneous drainage of biliary ducts. Materials and methodsPercutaneous drainage of biliary ducts was carried out under ultrasound and x-ray control with a <b>picture</b> <b>channel.</b> A PIGTAIL catheter (9 F diameter, 45 cm length) was installed by entering its end-part into intrahepatic billiary ducts and bile diversion. In 5 patients bile was inserted in back to the gastrointestinal tract by simultaneous endoscopic microgastrostomy. In 1996 – 2003, 52 percutaneous drainages of biliary ducts were installed in 38 patients. All of them suffered from mechanical jaundice with the bilirubin level of 170 – 510 umol/l caused by neoplasm constricting biliary ducts. The neoplastic disease in all cases was histologically confirmed. The quality of life was evaluated one month after installing percutaneous drainage of biliary ducts. Regression of symptoms connected with mechanical jaundice, independence and self-service when using a catheter and the physical and mental state of patients were taken into consideration. ResultsIn all patients a decrease in the bilirubin level below 170 umol/l was observed 14 days after the procedure. In 20 patients jaundice regressed completely 4 weeks after the drainage. In a later period increased bilirubin levels were connected with temporary impairment of catheter patency or with infection of biliary ducts. Despite the advanced neoplastic disease patients showed total independence and selfservice. However neoplastic cachexia and the necessity to take analgesics deteriorated their quality of life. Conclusions 1) Percutaneous drainage of biliary ducts decompresses mechanical jaundice and decreases ailments typical of cholestasis. 2) Percutaneous drainage of biliary ducts requires specialized long-term care and cooperation with the patient and or his or her family. 3) Deterioration in the quality of life in return for its prolongation is accepted by patients and their families...|$|E

A multiplex schema is selected for formation of actual subpixel abstracts (SPA), which does not contain redundant subpixel. USE - Used for autostereoscopic creation of three dimensional picture information from subpixel samples of a right and left picture view on a matrix screen e. g. liquid crystal display and plasma display. ADVANTAGE - The multiplex scheme is selected for formation of the actual subpixel samples, thus enabling the misalignment free tracking of the picture contents with lateral head movement of the viewers. The subpixels are isolated to a high degree, thus providing a good channel separation. The method facilitates a very comfortable viewing process as {{a high degree of}} lateral head movement is possible without impairing the stereo effect. The method decreases the crosstalk between the two <b>picture</b> <b>channels,</b> and improves the brightness and resolution of the picture content...|$|R
