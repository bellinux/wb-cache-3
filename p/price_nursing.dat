The research is socio-phonetic in its focus and therefore three variables, the <b>PRICE,</b> <b>NURSE</b> and KIT vowels of Wells’ (1982) lexical sets, were selected for acoustic analysis, a selection which was guided partly by the researcher’s own intuitions and partly by observed correlations in the impressionistic literature between certain realisations of these vowels and the Cape and Kwa-Zulu Natal as regions...|$|R

Using individual level data from the largest German sickness fund merged with institutional level data, we examine the relationship between nursing home quality, as measured by recently introduced report cards, <b>nursing</b> home <b>prices,</b> <b>nursing</b> home s location and the individual choice of nursing homes. Report cards were stepwise introduced as of 2009 and we use a sample of 2010 that includes both homes that had been evaluated at that time and that had not yet been. Thus, we can distinguish between institutions with good and bad ratings as well as non-rated nursing homes. We find that the probability of choosing a nursing home decreases in distance and price. However, we find no significant effect of reported quality on individuals choice of nursing homes...|$|R

40|$|Nursing homes {{participate}} {{simultaneously in}} a regulated and an unregulated market, and {{are required to}} supply the same quality of service to both markets. Specifically, nursing homes compete for patients who finance their care privately, and patients whose care is financed by the government's Medicaid program. The government reimburses nursing homes a set fee {{for the care of}} Medicaid patients, whereas nursing homes charge "private pay" patients what the market will bear. Quality is determined by competition in the"private pay" patient market. The greater the size of the "private pay" market relative to the Medicaid market, the higher is quality. We find that Medicaid policy makers face a trade-off between the access of Medicaid patients to care and quality. Specifically, an increase in the Medicaid reimbursement rate causes nursing homes to reduce quality, increase"private pay" price, and to admit more Medicaid patients and fewer "private pay" patients. Hence, in the nursing home industry, higher prices are associated with lower levels of quality. In addition, nursing homes set quality higher if the remibursement rate is set via "cost plus" pricing than if it is set via "flat rate" pricing. Moreover, consumers in both markets are better off under "cost plus" <b>pricing,</b> <b>nursing</b> homes earn higher profits under "flat rate" pricing, and total governmental Medicaid expenditures are the same under both reimbursement methods. ...|$|R

These policies also represent barriers to entry and can result in excess demand. This study investigates the effect of market concentration and excess demand on private <b>prices</b> for <b>nursing</b> home care. The author finds evidence that both factors are associated with higher prices. Because higher prices may cause private patients to exhaust their financial resources and become Medicaid patients sooner than they otherwise would, these policies may have had indirect cost-increasing consequences.

40|$|The family plays {{a central}} role in {{decisions}} relative to the provision of long term care (LTC). We develop a model of family bargaining to study the impact of the distribution of bargaining power within the family on the choices of nursing homes, and on the location and <b>prices</b> chosen by <b>nursing</b> homes in a Hotelling economy. We show that, if the dependent parent only cares about the distance, whereas his child cares also about the price, the mark up rate of nursing homes is increasing in the bargaining power of the dependent parent. We contrast the laissez-faire with the social optimum, and we show how the social optimum can be decentralized in a first-best setting and in a second-best setting (i. e. when the government cannot force location). Finally, we explore the robustness of our results to considering families with more than one child, and to introducing a wealth accumulation motive within a dynamic OLG model, which allows us to study the joint dynamics of wealth and <b>nursing</b> home <b>prices.</b> We show that a higher capital stock raises the <b>price</b> of <b>nursing</b> homes through higher mark up rates...|$|R
30|$|The {{analyses}} were performed separately for the two areas of the care sector: The operation of nursing homes {{for the elderly and}} the provision of domestic nursing services. The results show that despite a steady growth of the sector between 2003 and 2009, carers’ incomes have not increased. Furthermore, a concentration to larger facilities can be observed. This development leads to an increased competition for labour, which has not yet affected wages, because the market for nursing services is close to a monopsony. Therefore, the <b>prices</b> for <b>nursing</b> services have increased to a lesser extent than the annual inflation rate between 2003 and 2009.|$|R

Bargaining between nursing homes and long-term care insurance companies and social assistance administration can restrain this price-enhancing effect.

30|$|These {{partnerships}} take a dual {{economic opportunity}} {{and turn it}} into an engine of human capital creation for both origin countries and destination countries. The first opportunity to create value is the very large gap in the <b>price</b> of <b>nursing</b> services between migrant-origin countries and destination countries. Nursing services are worth 5 – 8 times as much, for example, in Western Europe as in parts of North Africa. The second opportunity is that the cost of nurse training at the migrant origin is {{a small fraction of the}} cost at the destination. It likewise costs at least 5 – 8 times as much to train a nurse in Western Europe as it costs in North Africa. Skilled migration can thus create enormous economic value. Global Skill Partnerships share that value in a way that origins, destinations, and migrants can agree to.|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{experiences}} of nursing students with exposure of influenza A (H 1 N 1). Methods : A qualitative descriptive study design was used. A total of 24 nursing students participated in six focus groups. Results: The six themes that emerged from the data are as follows: (1) worrying about becoming infected; (2) protectingoneself and others; (3) relying on the nurses in the school health center; (4) being hurt by others’ negative reactions; (5) being ambivalent, and (6) being concerned over the high <b>price.</b> Conclusions: <b>Nursing</b> students who come in contact with patients in a clinical setting must also be considered as candidatesfor early vaccination. Healthcare professionals, as well as family and friends, should keep in mind that their verbal ornonverbal expressions can hurt others’ feelings at a time when special care and support are needed the most.

40|$|Concern {{about the}} effect of aging on {{long-term}} care has intensified, particularly because aging has been accompanied by several changes that spur long-term care output, including growth in demand subsidies, declining fertility rates, rising female labor-force participation, and the deregulation of entry barriers to the nursing home industry. This article summarizes our previous work on how economic forces govern the demand for and supply of care, and extends it by discussing how they are affected by public subsidies for long-term care. Aging many times may lower the demand for market care by increasing the supply of family-provided care, which substitutes for market care. This effect appears to explain important trends in the output of long-term care over the past thirty years. We document the exponential growth of public financing {{over the past several decades}} and use our previous framework to argue that part of this growth would have occurred even if eligibility for public subsidies had been held constant. Private demand growth, by raising the private <b>price</b> of <b>nursing</b> home care, provides incentives for people to qualify for public assistance and expands the share of total demand that is publicly financed. Endogenous eligi-bility and the private price pressure induced by aging have helped contribute to the explosion in Medicaid budgets. I...|$|R

40|$|Policy {{makers and}} health care payers are {{concerned}} about the costs of treating terminal patients. This study was done to measure the costs of treating terminal patients during the final month of life in a sample of Belgian nursing homes from the health care payer perspective. Also, this study compares the costs of palliative care with those of usual care. This multicenter, retrospective cohort study enrolled terminal patients from a representative sample of nursing homes. Health care costs included fixed nursing home costs, medical fees, pharmacy charges, other charges, and eventual hospitalization costs. Data sources consisted of accountancy and invoice data. The analysis calculated costs per patient during the final month of life at 2007 / 2008 <b>prices.</b> Nineteen <b>nursing</b> homes participated in the study, generating a total of 181 patients. Total mean nursing home costs amounted to 3, 243 € per patient during the final month of life. Total mean nursing home costs per patient of 3, 822 € for patients receiving usual care were higher than costs of 2, 456 € for patients receiving palliative care (p = 0. 068). Higher costs of usual care were driven by higher hospitalization costs (p < 0. 001). This study suggests that palliative care models in nursing homes need to be supported because such care models appear to be less expensive than usual care and because such care models are likely to better reflect the needs of terminal patients. © 2012 Springer-Verlag...|$|R
40|$|Dutch health {{economic}} guidelines {{include a}} costing manual, which describes preferred research methodology for costing studies and reference prices to ensure high quality studies and comparability between study outcomes. This paper describes {{the most important}} revisions of the costing manual compared to the previous version. An online survey was sent out to potential users of the costing manual to identify topics for improvement. The costing manual was aligned with contemporary health economic guidelines. All methodology sections and parameter values needed for costing studies, particularly reference prices, were updated. An expert panel of health economists was consulted {{several times during the}} review process. The revised manual was reviewed by two members of the expert panel and by reviewers of the Dutch Health Care Institute. The majority of survey respondents was satisfied with content and usability of the existing costing manual. Respondents recommended updating reference prices and adding some particular commonly needed reference prices. Costs categories were adjusted to the international standard: 1) costs within the health care sector; 2) patient and family costs; and 3) costs in other sectors. Reference prices were updated to reflect 2014 values. The methodology chapter was rewritten to match the requirements of the costing manual and preferences of the users. Reference <b>prices</b> for <b>nursing</b> days of specific wards, for diagnostic procedures and nurse practitioners were added. The usability of the costing manual was increased and parameter values were updated. The costing manual became integrated in the new health economic guidelines...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In most states, {{firms in}} the nursing home {{industry}} must obtain a state license, which is known as a Certificate of Need (CON), prior to constructing or expanding a skilled nursing facility. There are two competing theoretical justifications in the economics literature for this regulation of the supply of nursing home beds. The public interest justification for CON regulation is based upon the belief that unregulated competition will result in the construction of unnecessary facilities and raise the cost of providing care for state- funded Medicaid patients. In addition, CON regulations that impose conditions on CONs may be used by states to ensure a supply of beds for poor elderly through the state-funded Medicaid program, despite relatively low Medicaid reimbursement rates. In contrast, proponents of the special interest theory of regulation suggest that CON construction controls provide a mechanism for barring new entry into a cartelized industry. Indeed, by controlling entry, the state provides nursing homes with a buffer from competition. As such, control of entry allows for the possibility of above normal economic profits as firms are able to charge higher <b>prices</b> to private-pay <b>nursing</b> home residents (i. e. residents paying out of pocket for nursing home care). The objective of this research is to consider the competing theoretical justifications for CON laws empirically, using nursing hom...|$|R
40|$|The proper {{measurement}} of inflation {{in health care}} is important for policymakers to understand the drivers of price growth. For this reason, the U. S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) recently released an alternate presentation of inflation for the health care sector that examines prices by disease, such as treatment of diabetes, rather than by place of service, such as a hospital stay. This account does not yet incorporate spending on nursing home care, providing an incomplete picture of inflation {{in the health care}} sector. To fill this gap, this paper calculates price indexes by disease for nursing home care for 2000 - 2009. We find prices in the overall nursing home sector grew at an average annual rate of only 0. 9 % during the period using these indexes. Price growth was slower for long-term nursing home residents (1. 4 %) compared to short-term residents (2. 8 %). Diseases of the circulatory system was the most prevalent disease category, followed by mental illness for long-term residents and diseases of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue for short-term patients. These three categories of diseases also received the largest allocations of spending, with the bulk going towards patients diagnosed with mental conditions. Overall, <b>nursing</b> home <b>price</b> growth in the 2000 s was much slower than for other health care sectors. Incorporating disease-based <b>price</b> indexes for <b>nursing</b> homes into BEA’s new health care account will provide a more comprehensive picture of health care spending trends and inflation...|$|R
40|$|Cost {{of health}} care has {{significantly}} altered health care delivery systems in recent years. To secure an adequate proportion of the limited health care dollar, nursing must develop mechanisms for appropriate <b>pricing</b> of the <b>nursing</b> product. ^ Although work has been conducted on cost of nursing services, the work to date has reported costs in adult populations. Studies have looked at pure cost of nursing services and nursing cost per DRG. Many of these studies have lacked a good measure of output. Rather than identifying proportion of total cost attributable to nursing, these studies have attempted to identify optimal amount of manpower and fiscal resources necessary to provide nursing care. In times of fiscal constraint, careful use of resources {{and the ability to}} understand resource allocation is imperative. ^ This study was undertaken to develop a mechanism to evaluate nursing costs based on hospital characteristics and patient variables for newborns. The marginal cost estimate, a measure of how much more nursing resource would be consumed for each additional patient, was derived using cost functions. ^ The study was performed using retrospective data from all New Jersey hospitals with obstetric and newborn services. Sixty-seven of the seventy hospitals were included in the model development. Data were collected from Newborn Services Quarterly Reports, SHARE fiscal reports and UB- 82 Discharge data tapes for 1984 and 1985. Available data included total reported direct nursing costs, numbers of births, discharge by DRG, admissions by birthweight, transfers to newborn intensive care, number of newborn nursery beds, occupancy rates, and neonatal complications. ^ Descriptive statistics for the sample hospitals were calculated including range and frequencies for continuous variables. Cost functions were then developed using multiple regression analysis. Total cost functions were derived using birthweight or discharge by DRG as the output measures. Marginal cost estimates were then derived from these cost functions for each additional infant admission and each DRG category. Cobb-Douglas specifications were also used to determine the return to scale and output elasticities of total cost. Marginal costs estimates were highest for infants weighing less than 1500 grams or those in DRG 386, extreme immaturity or respiratory distress syndrome. ...|$|R
