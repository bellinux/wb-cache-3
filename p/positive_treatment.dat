5|$|Women with anti-TPO {{antibodies}} who {{are trying}} to become pregnant (naturally or by assisted means) may require thyroid hormone supplementation even if the TSH level is normal. This is particularly true if they have had previous miscarriages or have been hypothyroid in the past. Supplementary levothyroxine may reduce the risk of preterm birth and possibly miscarriage. The recommendation is stronger in pregnant women with subclinical hypothyroidism (defined as TSH 2.5–10mIU/l) who are anti-TPO positive, in view of the risk of overt hypothyroidism. If a decision is made not to treat, close monitoring of the thyroid function (every 4 weeks in the first 20 weeks of pregnancy) is recommended. If anti-TPO is not <b>positive,</b> <b>treatment</b> for subclinical hypothyroidism is not currently recommended. It has been suggested that many of the aforementioned recommendations could lead to unnecessary treatment, {{in the sense that the}} TSH cutoff levels may be too restrictive in some ethnic groups; there may be little benefit from treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism in certain cases.|$|E

Suryadinata, who notes a more <b>positive</b> <b>treatment</b> of interracial marriages along the patrilineal line in Thio's Tjerita Njai Soemirah (1917), suggests that this {{was caused by a}} fear that a Chinese woman who married into another culture would no longer be Chinese, whereas a Chinese man marrying a non-Chinese woman could facilitate her absorption into the Chinese community.|$|E

40|$|A central {{question}} in the stockman–animal relationship is how animals perceive humans depending on previous interactions with them. This study aimed at measuring {{the influence of a}} previous experience with humans on subsequent reactivity to humans of weaned piglets. Treatments differing in type (intrinsic vs extrinsic to the human) and valence (positive vs negative) of the reinforcements used over a 5 -day standardised treatment period with a handler were delivered to 48 groups of three piglets following weaning: (1) gentle handling (GENHD), (2) food reward (FOOD), (3) gentle handling and food reward (FOODHD), (4) rough handling (ROUHD), (5) ball gun (e. g., plastic ball fired by a spring gun) without movement (GUN), (6) ball gun with movement (GUNHD), (7) passive human (PASSIVE, no reinforcement) and, (8) control (CONTROL, absence of additional experience with humans). The approach behaviour during a motionless handler phase was recorded weekly for 5 weeks after the treatment period. Thereafter, reactivity was scored (i. e., 0 = no escape to 4 = piglet escapes before handler makes any contact) during a handler approach phase. Following the treatment period, whereas piglets from all <b>positive</b> <b>treatments</b> approached the motionless handler, only those that received a gentle handling and were habituated to human contact accepted to be touched (average scores: 0. 4, 0. 3, 2. 4 and 2. 0 for FOODHD, GENHD, FOOD and PASSIVE, respectively, P 3. 8 for all negative treatments, P > 0. 05). Unfamiliarity with the handler induced a natural vigilance and fear response since CONTROL piglets spent less time in contact with the handler than piglets from <b>positive</b> <b>treatments</b> until 2 weeks after the treatment period with the handler (28 % vs 84 %, 87 %, 86 % and 72 % for CONTROL vs GENHD, FOODHD, FOOD and PASSIVE, respectively, P 0. 05). The perception of the handler was strongly modulated by the previous experience with her as behavioural differences between <b>positive</b> and negative <b>treatments</b> persisted for at least 5 weeks. For instance, during the last reactivity test, it is particularly noteworthy that all piglets from <b>positive</b> <b>treatments</b> touched the handler within 22 s, whereas 20 % of piglets from negative treatments did not make contact (P < 0. 0001). To conclude, piglets are able to associate humans with particular experiences and remember the past experience with humans during at least 5 weeks...|$|R

2500|$|According to Scruton, {{the philosopher}} A. J. Ayer {{dismissed}} Sexual Desire as [...] "silly". Describing Ayer's comment {{as part of}} a pattern of negative responses to his work, Scruton replied that he considers Sexual Desire cogent and an answer to Foucault's [...] "mendacious" [...] The History of Sexuality (1976). Stafford suggested in 2005 that an essay that Scruton published subsequent to Sexual Desire, in which he argued that children should be encouraged to feel revulsion for homosexuality, was an attempt by Scruton to prevent his admission in Sexual Desire that homosexual desire is spontaneous and not necessarily perverted from being seen as supporting the <b>positive</b> <b>treatment</b> of homosexuality by moral educators. Christopher Hamilton called Sexual Desire [...] "the most interesting and insightful philosophical account of sexual desire" [...] produced within analytic philosophy.

Using a unique dataset of the treatment of all Supreme Court majority opinions in the courts of appeals from 1953 to 2012, we find that negative treatments of Supreme Court opinions increase, and <b>positive</b> <b>treatments</b> decrease, as the Justices who supported a decision retire from the Court.

40|$|Introduction: Approximately 25 – 30 % {{of breast}} cancers {{are assumed to}} be HER- 2 /neu positive. It is well known that HER- 2 /neu-positive cancers after {{treatment}} with trastuzumab can become HER- 2 /neu negative. Change in HER- 2 /neu status from negative to <b>positive</b> following <b>treatment</b> has not been well studied. We describe a patient with inflammatory breast cancer who was initially HER- 2 /neu negative but became <b>positive</b> after <b>treatment.</b> A 59 -year-old postmenopausal white female saw her surgeon for violaceous discoloration of the left breast for 4 months. The surgeon palpated a mass measuring 6 cm in the patient’s left breast. Additionally, there was violaceous discoloration involving two thirds of the breast. Biopsy of the breast mass and skin revealed inflammatory breast cancer. The tumor was estrogen receptor positive, progesterone receptor positive and HER- 2 /neu negative. The patient was given four cycles of chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and docetaxol. She subsequently underwent a mastectomy, excision of the skin over the chest wall and axillary node dissection. Of the axillary lymph nodes, 14 / 14 were involved. The tumor was still estrogen receptor positive and progesterone receptor positive, but HER- 2 /neu was 2 + by immunohistochemistry and amplified at 3. 3 as detected by fluorescent in situhybridization. The patient received trastuzumab along with chemotherapy followed by radiation therapy and letrozole. She is currently receiving trastuzumab and letrozole in the adjuvant setting and appears to be doing well. Conclusion: A breast cancer which was initially HER- 2 /neu negative can become <b>positive</b> following <b>treatment.</b> Therefore, re-biopsy may be necessary during the course of treatment of breast cancer to re-assess the HER- 2 /neu status. This gives the clinician the opportunity to include drugs like trastuzumab and lapatinib in the treatment of patients with a transformation to HER- 2 /neu-positive cancer...|$|R
