5|$|Hormonal {{therapy is}} only {{beneficial}} in {{certain types of}} endometrial cancer. It was {{once thought to be}} beneficial in most cases. If a tumor is well-differentiated and known to have progesterone and estrogen receptors, progestins may be used in treatment. About 25% of metastatic endometrioid cancers show a response to progestins. Also, endometrial stromal sarcomas can be treated with hormonal agents, including tamoxifen, hydroxyprogesterone caproate, letrozole, megestrol acetate, and medroxyprogesterone. This treatment is effective in endometrial stromal sarcomas because they typically have estrogen and/or <b>progestin</b> receptors. <b>Progestin</b> receptors function as tumor suppressors in endometrial cancer cells. Preliminary research and clinical trials have shown these treatments to have a high rate of response even in metastatic disease.|$|E
5|$|Smoking {{and the use}} of <b>progestin</b> {{are both}} {{protective}} against endometrial cancer. Smoking provides protection by altering the metabolism of estrogen and promoting weight loss and early menopause. This protective effect lasts long after smoking is stopped. <b>Progestin</b> is present in the combined oral contraceptive pill and the hormonal intrauterine device (IUD). Combined oral contraceptives reduce risk more the longer they are taken: by 56% after four years, 67% after eight years, and 72% after twelve years. This risk reduction continues for at least fifteen years after contraceptive use has been stopped. Obese women may need higher doses of <b>progestin</b> to be protected. Having had more than fiveinfants (grand multiparity) is also a protective factor, and having at least one child reduces the risk by 35%. Breastfeeding for more than 18months reduces risk by 23%. Increased physical activity reduces an individual's risk by 38–46%. There is preliminary evidence that consumption of soy is protective.|$|E
5|$|Medroxyprogesterone acetate, a <b>progestin,</b> {{has been}} shown to improve the {{ventilatory}} response, but this has been poorly studied and is associated with an increased risk of thrombosis. Similarly, the drug acetazolamide can reduce bicarbonate levels, and thereby augment to normal ventilatory response, but this has been researched insufficiently to recommend wide application.|$|E

40|$|The aims of {{the present}} study were to {{determine}} presence of immunoreactive <b>progestins</b> in feces, correlate fecal <b>progestins</b> with plasma progesterone (P 4) concentrations and subsequently assess the role of fecal <b>progestins</b> in monitoring estrous cycle in Kedah Kelantan (KK) beef cows. A total of 12 cycling cows were subjected to blood and matched fecal sampling twice a week for 9 weeks. The concentrations of plasma P 4 and fecal <b>progestins</b> extracted using a modified technique, were determined by a P 4 radioimmunoassay (RIA) kit. There was a significant positive correlation between the concentrations of fecal <b>progestins</b> and plasma P 4 (r = 0. 6, P< 0. 01), as tested for the whole group except one animal. High performance liquid chromatographic separation of fecal extracts and subsequent radioimmunoassay revealed presence of four immunoreactive <b>progestins</b> against the P 4 antibodies.

40|$|The <b>progestins</b> have {{different}} pharmacologic properties {{depending upon the}} parent molecule, usually testosterone or progesterone (P), from which they are derived. Very small structural changes in the parent molecule may induce con-siderable differences in {{the activity of the}} derivative. In hormonal contraceptives, <b>progestins</b> represent the major agent designed for suppressing ovulation and are used in combination with estrogen (E) usually ethinyl-estradiol (EE). The development of new generations of <b>progestins</b> with improved selectivity profiles has been a great challenge. Steroidal and nonsteroidal progesterone receptor (PR) agonists have been synthesized as well, although the latter are still in a very early stage of development. Several new <b>progestins,</b> have been synthesized in the last two decades. These include dienogest (DNG), drospirenone (DRSP), Nestorone (NES), nomegestrol acetate (NOMAc) and trimegestone (TMG). These new <b>progestins</b> have been designed to have no androgenic or estrogenic actions and to be closer in activity to the physiological hormone P. DRSP differs from the classic <b>progestins</b> as it is derived from spirolactone. It is essentially an antimineralocorticoid steroid with no androgenic effect but a partial antiandrogenic effect. The antiovulatory potency of the different <b>progestins</b> varies. TMG and NES are the most potent <b>progestins</b> synthesized to date, followed by two of the older <b>progestins,</b> keto-desogestrel (keto-DSG) and levonorgestrel (LNG).

5|$|A {{reversible}} surgical method {{under investigation}} is reversible inhibition of sperm under guidance (RISUG) {{which consists of}} injecting a polymer gel, styrene maleic anhydride in dimethyl sulfoxide, into the vas deferens. An injection with sodium bicarbonate washes out the substance and restores fertility. Another is an intravas device which involves putting a urethane plug into the vas deferens to block it. A combination of an androgen and a <b>progestin</b> seems promising, as do selective androgen receptor modulators. Ultrasound and methods to heat the testicles have undergone preliminary studies.|$|E
5|$|Improvements of {{existing}} birth control methods are needed, as around {{half of those}} who get pregnant unintentionally are using birth control at the time. A number of alterations {{of existing}} contraceptive methods are being studied, including a better female condom, an improved diaphragm, a patch containing only <b>progestin,</b> and a vaginal ring containing long-acting progesterone. This vaginal ring appears to be effective {{for three or four}} months and is currently available in some areas of the world. For women who rarely have sex, the taking of the hormonal birth control levonorgestrel around the time of sex looks promising.|$|E
5|$|Progestin-only pills, {{injections}} and intrauterine {{devices are}} {{not associated with}} an increased risk of blood clots and may be used by women with previous blood clots in their veins. In those with a history of arterial blood clots, non-hormonal birth control or a progestin-only method other than the injectable version should be used. Progestin-only pills may improve menstrual symptoms and can be used by breastfeeding women as they do not affect milk production. Irregular bleeding may occur with progestin-only methods, with some users reporting no periods. The progestins drospirenone and desogestrel minimize the androgenic side effects but increase the risks of blood clots and are thus not first line. The perfect use first-year failure rate of the injectable <b>progestin,</b> Depo-Provera, is 0.2%; the typical use first failure rate is 6%.|$|E
40|$|<b>Progestins</b> used in {{contraception}} and {{hormone replacement}} therapy are synthetic compounds designed to mimic {{the actions of the}} natural hormone progesterone and are classed into four consecutive generations. The biological actions of <b>progestins</b> are primarily determined by their interactions with steroid receptors, and factors such as metabolism, pharmacokinetics, bioavailability and the regulation of endogenous steroid hormone biosynthesis are often overlooked. Although some studies have investigated the effects of select <b>progestins</b> on a few steroidogenic enzymes, studies comparing the effects of <b>progestins</b> from different generations are lacking. This study therefore explored the putative modulatory effects of <b>progestins</b> on de novo steroid synthesis in the adrenal by comparing the effects of select <b>progestins</b> from the respective generations, on endogenous steroid hormone production by the H 295 R human adrenocortical carcinoma cell line. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry analysis showed that the fourth-generation <b>progestins,</b> nestorone (NES), nomegestrol acetate (NoMAC) and drospirenone (DRSP), unlike the <b>progestins</b> selected from the first three generations, modulate the biosynthesis of several endogenous steroids. Subsequent assays performed in COS- 1 cells expressing human 3 βHSD 2, suggest that these <b>progestins</b> modulate the biosynthesis of steroid hormones by inhibiting the activity of 3 βHSD 2. The Ki values determined for the inhibition of human 3 βHSD 2 by NES (9. 5 ± 0. 96 nM), NoMAC (29 ± 7. 1 nM) and DRSP (232 ± 38 nM) were within the reported concentration ranges for the contraceptive use of these <b>progestins</b> in vivo. Taken together, our results suggest that newer, fourth-generation <b>progestins</b> may exert both positive and negative physiological effects via the modulation of endogenous steroid hormone biosynthesis...|$|R
50|$|Some <b>progestins</b> have {{androgenic}} activity and can produce androgenic side effects such as acne, hirsutism, and weight gain, {{as well as}} changes in hepatic protein production. Only certain <b>progestins</b> are androgenic however, these being the testosterone (19-nortestosterone and 17α-ethynyltestosterone) derivatives and, to a lesser extent, medroxyprogesterone acetate; no other <b>progestins</b> have such activity (though some, conversely, possess antiandrogen activity (see above)). Moreover, the {{androgenic activity}} of <b>progestins</b> within the testosterone derivatives also varies, and while some may have high or moderate androgenic activity, others have only low or no such activity.|$|R
40|$|Problem: Endometriosis is an estrogen-dependent {{inflammatory}} disease. <b>Progestins</b> are a first-line {{treatment for}} endometriosis via activation of pituitary progesterone receptors and suppression of systemic estrogen: {{a less than}} optimal treatment. Increasing evidence is beginning to show that <b>progestins</b> may also influence local endometriotic cells, which may contribute to their clinical efficacy.

5|$|The {{period of}} oestrus itself, when the female is {{receptive}} to the male, lasts about 24 hours, and observations have placed its recurrence between 21 and 25 days.

40|$|Each {{synthetic}} <b>progestins</b> {{has its own}} specific {{activities on}} different tissues, which can vary significantly between <b>progestins</b> of different classes and even within the same class.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Hormone {{therapy is}} {{effective}} for {{the relief of}} menopausal symptoms. For women with a uterus, addition of a progestogen is required to protect the endometrium. However, synthetic <b>progestins</b> differ in certain pharmacological characteristics that may have implications for clinical practice. This literature-based review explores differences in the preclinical and clinical profiles of the <b>progestins</b> used in hormone therapy, focusing on their effects on the cardiovascular system and breast. DESIGN: Studies included are selected based on criteria of relevance, topicality, and subjective assessment of quality, following comprehensive searches of online databases. RESULTS: The biological actions of <b>progestins</b> depend on their receptor binding affinity profiles {{as well as their}} specific effects on progesterone receptor signaling, which often differ based on the ligand. Observational studies indicate that hormone therapies which include medroxyprogesterone acetate and certain other <b>progestins</b> may attenuate the cardiovascular benefits of estrogen and add to risk of breast cancer. Appraisal of the evidence suggests these clinical effects correlate with the progestin's pharmacological profile. Among the newer <b>progestins,</b> drospirenone has been investigated extensively in preclinical studies. With a pharmacological profile similar to progesterone, drospirenone is devoid of estrogenic, androgenic and glucocorticoid activity and possesses potent antialdosterone and antiandrogenic activity. This profile of drospirenone contrasts with that of older <b>progestins,</b> conferring specific effects on cardiovascular and breast cells.
