40|$|Current neurobiological {{accounts}} {{of language and}} cognition offer diverging views on the questions of ‘where’ and ‘how’ semantic information is stored and processed in the human brain. Neuroimaging data showing consistent activation of different multi-modal areas during word and sentence comprehension suggest that all meanings are processed indistinctively, {{by a set of}} general semantic centres or ‘hubs’. However, words belonging to specific semantic categories selectively activate modality-preferential areas; for example, action-related words spark activity in dorsal motor cortex, whereas object-related ones activate ventral visual areas. The evidence for category-specific and category-general semantic areas begs for a unifying explanation, able to integrate the emergence of both. Here, a neurobiological model offering such an explanation is described. Using a neural architecture repli- cating anatomical and neurophysiological features of frontal, occipital and temporal cortices, basic aspects of word learning and semantic grounding in action and perception were simulated. As the network underwent training, distributed lexico-semantic cir- cuits spontaneously emerged. These circuits exhibited different cortical distributions that reached into dorsal-motor or ventral- visual areas, reflecting the correlated category-specific sensorimotor patterns that co-occurred during action- or object-related semantic grounding, respectively. Crucially, substantial numbers of neurons of both types of distributed circuits emerged in areas interfacing between modality-preferential regions, i. e. in <b>multimodal</b> <b>connection</b> hubs, which therefore became loci of general semantic binding. By relating neuroanatomical structure and cellular-level learning mechanisms with system-level cognitive func- tion, this model offers a neurobiological account of category-general and category-specific semantic areas based on the different cortical distributions of the underlying semantic circuits...|$|R

Estimating the potential demand for a new or expanded port is critical for assessing its potential financial and economic success but is extremely difficult due to the many issues which must be considered. Among these issues are multimodal accesses to markets and competition from other ports. Yet, these issues {{are very difficult to}} assess without an appropriate model.

Using readily available and preliminary data for a hypothetical new port at Quonset Point, RI, we apply the model to estimate demand for several cases: (1) with and without multimodal rail access, (2) with and without recognition of competition faced from other ports. Estimated demand for the hypothetical port is small with no Class I rail access, but adding Class I rail access vastly expands the potential market service area and demand for the ports services. On the other hand, including the ports of Halifax and Montreal in the model substantially reduces estimated potential demand at the new port.

40|$|AbstractWorld {{trade has}} been {{increasing}} dramatically {{in the past two}} decades, and as a result containers exchange has grown significantly. Accordingly, container terminals are expanding to meet this increase and new container ports have opened. Ports with one or more container terminals are considered complex systems in which many resources, entities and transporters interact to achieve the objective of safely moving containers delivered by ships inland as well as loading containers delivered by trucks and rail onto ships. <b>Ports</b> with <b>multimodal</b> transportation systems are in particular complex as they typically operate with ships arriving to one or more terminals, multiple quay cranes, rubber tyred gantry cranes, trains, and trucks delivering containers of different types to terminals. With several resources of different types working and interacting, the system can be so complex that {{it is not easy to}} predict the behavior of the system and its performance metrics without the use of simulation. In this paper, a generic discrete-event simulation that models port operations with different resource types including security gates, space, rubber tyred gantry cranes, trains, quay cranes, and arriving and departing ships, trucks, and trains is presented.

Prospects of using transgenic mice currently focus molecular research on this lower mammal. In our study we searched for evidence of cortical reorganisation in response to lesions in the visual system of the adult mouse. We first investigated the effect of monocular enucleation on the expression levels of zif 268, an excellent neuronal activity marker, throughout the visual cortex. Analysis of these activity patterns at different survival times provided in a precise timeline in which cortical reorganisation occurs in mouse, as established based on the restoration of normal zif 268 expression levels in the monocular segment of the visual cortex. A popular explanation for this reorganisation is the take-over of the inactive part of the ipsilateral visual cortex by the non-deprived eye, yet somatosensory and auditory stimuli may drive the restoration of activity as well. To demonstrate these propositions we enucleated the remaining left eye, trimmed right side vibrissae or inactivated the right cochlea after long-term right eye deprivation. Following these deprivation experiments especially the infragranular layers of the monocular segment showed a decrease for the zif 268 signal.

40|$|Assessing the {{potential}} demand for container <b>ports</b> and related <b>multimodal</b> transportation {{is critical for}} several purposes, including financial feasibility analysis and the evaluation of net economic benefits and their distribution. When developed {{in conjunction with a}} geographical information system, port-related demand analysis also provides needed input for assessment of selected environmental issues, such as truck traffic on local roads and related potential external costs, such as air pollution and noise. However, container port demand analysis is very difficult due to the complexities of international trade in containerised goods, inter-port competition, and potential strategic behaviour by several parties. Difficulties also arise from the many factors to be considered, major data requirements, and the computationally intensive nature of the problem. This paper summarises the development and application of a spatial-economic, multimodal container transportation demand simulation model for major US container ports. The underlying economic framework assumes shippers minimise the total general cost of moving containers from sources to markets. The model is validated and then used to estimate (1) annual container transportation service demand for major container ports, (2) the market areas served by selected ports, and (3) the impact on port demand and interport competition due to hypothetical changes in port use fees at selected ports. This paper first describes the model and the underlying economic reasoning, followed by the assumptions, computational algorithms, and the software architecture. Then, the trade data, transportation networks, and economic variables are described. After that, model simulation results are presented with qualifications, needed refinements, and future directions.

40|$|There is a {{widespread}} belief these days that the Danube River is a waterway which is by far underutilised. This is usually attributed to the problems blocking navigation on the river (mostly on the Hungarian section), and to the missing regulations of the navigation routes. We have to add, however, {{that there are many}} other factors that set back the development of navigation, including the endowments of our economy that result in limited demand for water transportation. Also, several further economic, geopolitical and geographical endowments contribute to the low level of utilisation. The starting point of our paper is that the Danube River now offers one single long navigation route. The competitiveness of this route is decreased by the fact that no waterway network has been established in the last two hundred years that could have made river transportation more rationally usable. Think of the navigability of the tributaries, the connecting and branch canals, and <b>multimodal</b> <b>ports</b> (connected to railway and road transportation). Because of all these factors, no macro-regional economy was created at the adequate time, built on water transportation. Think of the fact that one single long railway line of motorway, without junctions and connections, cannot be operated economically, either, it will not become a system and its regional development impact will remain limited. Our paper focuses on those experiments that were made to contribute to the network development of the Danube River water system, with exact plans.

It is about [...] closer to {{destinations}} {{east of the}} Suez than the ports of Northern Europe, and the land transport from Koper by road and by railway to the main industrial centres in Central Europe is approximately 500 km shorter than from Northern European <b>ports.</b> It is <b>multimodal</b> {{and one of the}} most modern in this part of the world, but its development is hindered by the lack of sufficient depth. From it, there are reliable and regular shipping container lines to all major world ports. The port has been rapidly growing and in 2011, more than 17 million tonnes (16,7 million long tons, 18,7 million short tons) of cargo passed through it. It is the largest Northern Adriatic port in terms of container transport. In 2011, almost 590,000 TEUs passed through it. There is a skewed balance in the direction of trade flows in the Port of Koper where import flows clearly outweigh export flows. The majority of maritime passenger traffic in Slovenia takes place in Koper, where a passenger terminal was completed in 2005. It has recorded about 100,000 passengers in 2011, and has been visited by the largest passenger ships, such as the MS Voyager of the Seas. The two smaller ports used for the international passenger transport are located in Izola and Piran. The Port of Piran is also used for the international transport of salt, whereas the Port of Izola is used for fish disembarkation. Passenger transport in Slovenia takes place mainly with Italy and Croatia. The only shipping company of Slovenia is Splošna plovba. It operates 28 ships with 1,025,000 tonnes of tonnage. It transports freight and is active only in foreign ports.|$|R

Attempts {{to resolve these}} issues require development of new methods and extensions of existing approaches drawing upon advances in simulation techniques and their integration with economic theory. Demand for container port services is a critical factor for the economic analysis of, and decision making for, container port development. However, practical methods for demand estimation often are not convincing, while formal research in transportation demand estimation has not been extended to the practical use of container port demand estimation. ^ This dissertation designed, developed, and implemented a multimodal container transportation simulation model. It takes as given, the quantity of international containerized trade and the existing multimodal transportation system, and assumes the containers be transported along a least-cost route from source to market. The cost includes the fees paid to the transportation services, and the inventory cost. The estimated demand separates {{the effect of the}} supply side, and measures only the substitution effect of the existing ports. The simulation efforts in this research included the national and state highway system, and the railway system. It includes 14 existing major US ports, with 6 in East Coast, 4 in West Coast and 4 in Gulf Coast. Foreign countries are grouped into continents, with Asia divided into West Asia and East Asia by Singapore. The developed software was applied to the demand analysis for a hypothetical port at Quonset Point, Rhode Island, USA. The application includes the estimated demand under existing conditions, demand changes with rail improvement, and with competition by the eastern Canadian ports of Halifax and Montreal. ^ This dissertation contributes to the container port demand estimation literature, and provides a new tool for decision makers and business operators concerned with multimodal container transportation facility development. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{resilience}} of critical infrastructures (CI) to Extreme Weather Events (EWE) {{is one of}} the most salient and demanding challenges facing society. Growing scientific evidence suggests that more frequent and severe weather extremes such as heat waves, hurricanes and droughts and their effects such as flooding are having an ever increasing impact, with the range and effects on society exacerbated when CI is disrupted or destroyed. Disruptions of CI systems frequently cause major social and economic losses, both directly and through failures in one system leading to disruptions in another (cascading effects). The ability to ensure continuity in services provided by CI directly relates to the {{resilience of}} communities to withstand and recover from disasters. The approach adopted by the INTACT-project recognizes that a European-wide coordinated and cooperative effort is required because of cross border CI-activities and impacts as well as an integrated EU-policy. The INTACT-case studies and their expected outcomes are designed to bring added value for the concerned stakeholders locally and demonstrate the validity and applicability of the INTACT approach at the broader (European) scale. To achieve this, the selected case studies are geographically spread across Europe encompassing different climate, landscape and environmental zones, as to provide coverage of a representative range of CI types and also including different levels of governance. One of the case studies is located in the Netherlands and deals with the port of Rotterdam. The situation in Rotterdam is representative for many other main ports in Europe. These ports are all situated in a delta area, near the sea and rivers or canals. Also, these ports are close to urban areas and industrial complexes. Finally, these <b>ports</b> have a <b>multimodal</b> transport infrastructure to and from its hinterland, which is also vulnerable for extreme weather events.

40|$|Computer based {{simulation}} models {{have often been}} used to study the multimodal freight transportation system. But these studies {{have not been able}} to dynamically couple the various modes into one model; therefore, they are limited in their ability to inform on dynamic system level interactions. This research thesis is motivated by the need to dynamically couple the multimodal freight transportation system to operate at multiple spatial and temporal scales. It is part of a larger research program to develop a systems modeling framework applicable to freight transportation. This larger research program attempts to dynamically couple railroad, seaport, and highway freight transportation models. The focus of this thesis is the development of the coupled railroad and seaport models. A separate volume (Wall 2010) on the development of the highway model has been completed. The model railroad and seaport was developed using Arena® simulation software and it comprises of the Ports of Savannah, GA, Charleston, NC, Jacksonville, FL, their adjacent CSX rail terminal, and connecting CSX railroads in the southeastern U. S. However, only the simulation outputs for the Port of Savannah are discussed in this paper. It should be mentioned that the modeled port layout is only conceptual; therefore, any inferences drawn from the model's outputs do not represent actual port performance. The model was run for 26 continuous simulation days, generating 141 containership calls, 147 highway truck deliveries of containers, 900 trains, and a throughput of 28, 738 containers at the Port of Savannah, GA. An analysis of each train's trajectory from origin to destination shows that trains spend between 24 - 67 percent of their travel time idle on the tracks waiting for permission to move. Train parking demand analysis on the adjacent shunting area at the multimodal terminal seems to indicate that there aren't enough containers coming from the port because the demand is due to only trains waiting to load. The simulation also shows that on average it takes containerships calling at the Port of Savannah about 3. 2 days to find an available dock to berth and unload containers. The observed mean turnaround time for containerships was 4. 5 days. This experiment also shows that container residence time within the <b>port</b> and adjacent <b>multimodal</b> rail terminal varies widely. Residence times within the port range from about 0. 2 hours to 9 hours with a mean of 1 hour. The average residence time inside the rail terminal is about 20 minutes but observations varied from as little as 2 minutes to a high of 2. 5 hours. In addition, about 85 percent of container residence time in the port is spent idle. This research thesis demonstrates that it is possible to dynamically couple the different sub-models of the multimodal freight transportation system. However, there are challenges that need to be addressed by future research. The principal challenge is the development of a more efficient train movement algorithm that can incorporate the actual Direct Traffic Control (DTC) and / or Automatic Block Signal (ABS) track segmentation. Such an algorithm would likely improve the capacity estimates of the railroad network. In addition, future research should seek to reduce the high computational cost imposed by a discrete process modeling methodology and the adoption of single container resolution level for terminal operations. A methodology combining both discrete and continuous process modeling as proposed in this study could lessen computational costs and lower computer system requirements at a cost of some of the feedback capabilities of the model This tradeoff must be carefully examined.
