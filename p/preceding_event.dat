Nick Heidfeld, Nico Prost and Nelson Piquet Jr. were fourth on twelve points, and Bruno Senna, Filipe Albuquerque and Ricardo González rounded out the top five with ten points.

50|$|There {{are three}} main types of HAE. Type I and II {{are caused by}} a {{mutation}} in the SERPING1 gene that makes the C1 inhibitor protein while type III is often due to a mutation of the factor XII gene. This results in increased amounts of bradykinin which promotes swelling. The condition may be inherited from a person's parents in an autosomal dominant manner or occur as a new mutation. Triggers of an attack may include minor trauma or stress, but often occurs without any obvious <b>preceding</b> <b>event.</b> Diagnosis of type I and II is based upon measuring C4 and C1-inhibitor levels.|$|E

50|$|Wylie defined two {{patterns}} of strategy: sequential and cumulative. A sequential strategy involved a planned {{sequence of events}} where each event is dependent upon {{the success of the}} <b>preceding</b> <b>event.</b> Wylie offered MacArthur's campaign in the Southwest Pacific, Nimitz's campaign in the Central Pacific, and Eisenhower's campaign in Europe as examples of sequential strategies. A cumulative strategy involved a collection of small, disconnected actions that, when taken together, have a significant impact. Wylie uses insurgencies and the U.S. Navy's submarine campaign against Japan in World War II as examples of cumulative strategies. He and his strategies have been compared to Clausewitz to a somewhat successful degree. This would most likely be due to Wylie's approach to individual contingencies and utilization of resources.|$|E
50|$|Jorge Lorenzo {{entered the}} event leading the Riders' standings {{following}} his win at the <b>preceding</b> <b>event</b> - the French Grand Prix. Reigning world champion Casey Stoner {{was second in}} the standings, eight points behind Lorenzo, whilst his Honda teammate, Dani Pedrosa, was seventeen points behind him. Yamaha {{led the way in}} the Manufacturers' standings, all 90 of their points courtesy of Lorenzo. Honda were 4 points behind them, and Ducati remained in third place after Valentino Rossi scored their first podium of the season in Le Mans. Colin Edwards returned to his CRT ride after breaking his collarbone at the Portuguese Grand Prix four weeks previously; he had been replaced with Chris Vermeulen for the French Grand Prix. Bridgestone took asymmetric tyres to the race for the bikes to compensate for the large number of long, right-handed corners on the track.|$|E

40|$|Functional {{localization}} {{and mechanisms}} of sequential effects in serial reaction time tasks In randomly ordered stimulus presentations, {{such as those}} used in many experimental situations, choice reaction times (RTs) are strongly affected by the sequence of preceding stimuli and responses. These sequential effects take different shapes, depending {{on a number of}} experimental factors. The present article addresses the mechanisms underlying these effects and the locus of their actions within the information-processing system. In describing sequential effects, it is convenient to classify each event as a repetition (R) or an alternation (A) of the <b>preceding</b> <b>event.</b> Because the consequences of the immediately <b>preceding</b> <b>event</b> and of those events earlier in the sequence for the processing of a current stimulus can be quite different, they are often distinguished as firstorder (FO) and higher order (HO) effects, respectively. The type of FO and HO effects obtained in a given experimental situation depends on a number of factors (e. g., Bertelso...|$|E

40|$|Granuloma annulare (GA) is a common, benign, chronic {{inflammatory}} disorder, {{which is}} characterized by grouped papules in an enlarging annular shape. It has been described in several clinical subtypes, including localized, generalized, subcutaneous, perforating, and erythematous types. Even though generalized, subcutaneous, and perforating types of GA are unusual, there are several reports of those types. However, erythematous or patch GA, has not been reported yet in the Korean literature.

We presented a random sequence of visual, tactile, and auditory targets to either {{the left or right}} of central fixation, and tested for IOR between targets in all three modalities when presented successively to the same versus different side. Speeded detection for targets in all three modalities was indeed slower if the preceding target had been presented from the same position, regardless of the modality, of this preceding target.

An event of type OR may happen only after {{at least one of}} its <b>preceding</b> <b>events</b> has happened, with the corresponding delay after it. The early schedule is in question.
