2500|$|In Europe, {{it is the}} <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>accommodation,</b> if anything, {{that now}} distinguishes inns from taverns, alehouses and pubs. The latter tend to provide alcohol (and, in the UK, soft drinks and often food), but less {{commonly}} accommodation. Inns tend to be older and grander establishments: historically they provided not only food and lodging, but also stabling and fodder for the traveller's horse(s) and on some roads fresh horses for the mail coach. Famous London inns include The George, Southwark and The Tabard. There is however no longer a formal distinction between an inn {{and other kinds of}} establishment. Many pubs use [...] "Inn" [...] in their name, either because they are long established former coaching inns, or to summon up a particular kind of image, or in many cases simply as a pun on the word [...] "in", as in [...] "The Welcome Inn", the name of many pubs in Scotland.|$|E

He has also suggested that the focus on learning disabilities and the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>accommodations</b> in school fails to acknowledge that people have a range of strengths and weaknesses, and places undue emphasis on academic success by insisting that people should receive additional support in this arena but not in music or sports. Other research has pinpointed the use of resource rooms as an important—yet often politicized component of educating students with learning disabilities.|$|R
40|$|The rate of {{application}} for Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) benefits, {{as well as the}} number of beneficiaries has been increasing for the past several decades, threatening the solvency of the SSDI program.

40|$|In Britain, {{responsibility}} for the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> emergency <b>accommodation</b> for single homeless people has historically fallen to the voluntary sector. Responding to continuing concerns about unevenness in the supply and quality <b>of</b> such <b>accommodation,</b> New Labour have considerably increased the funding available to the sector and imposed tighter regulations upon the voluntary organisations providing such services. Drawing on the first national survey <b>of</b> emergency <b>accommodation</b> projects operating in England, Wales and Scotland the paper reports {{on the effect of}} these initiatives. The survey reveals that they have had far less impact than might be imagined. The supply <b>of</b> emergency <b>accommodation</b> in Britain remains markedly uneven, and the quality <b>of</b> <b>accommodation</b> and care provided by some voluntary organisations a cause of serious concern. 3 Introduction In Britain, {{responsibility for}} the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> emergency <b>accommodation</b> for single homeless people has historically fallen to the voluntary sector (Saunders, 1986).

50|$|The colleges, many {{of which}} were {{formerly}} known as Halls of Residence, have a long-standing presence within the Dunedin academic society; the earliest was founded in 1893, only 24 years after the university's establishment.

50|$|The {{alternative}} approach, {{response to}} intervention, identifies {{children who are}} having difficulties in school in their first or second year after starting school. They then receive additional assistance such as participating in a reading remediation program. The response of the children to this intervention then determines whether they are designated as having a learning disability. Those few who still have trouble may then receive designation and further assistance. Sternberg (1999) has argued that early remediation can greatly {{reduce the number of}} children meeting diagnostic criteria for learning disabilities. He has also suggested that the focus on learning disabilities and the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>accommodations</b> in school fails to acknowledge that people have a range of strengths and weaknesses and places undue emphasis on academics by insisting that students should be supported in this arena and not in music or sports.|$|R
