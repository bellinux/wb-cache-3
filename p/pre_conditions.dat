A range of arguments against using and enclosing animals, or in favour of certain (<b>pre)</b> <b>conditions</b> of captivity, can be {{found to have a}} tendency to focus on generic and isolated individual organisms.

Through a critical reading of the previous four chapters, this one will trace the extent to which reasoning in terms of welfare, freedom, capabilities or dignity may lead to granting attention and value to (many) animals as the idiosyncratic, relational, sociable beings which many of them are.

40|$|The {{so-called}} ‘Blackwater scandal' - {{a reference}} to the seventeen Iraqi civilians killed on Nisour Square by security guards of the private military company (PMC) Blackwater in September 2007 - puts into question the proposition that private military contractors or ‘mercenaries' could be relied upon to act effectively and responsibly in peacekeeping and other international operations. Arguably, Blackwater's frequently observed callousness, if typical of other Private Military Companies (PMCs), gravely undermines this proposition. After closely analysing the Nisour Square incident and the Blackwater company in a wider context of revealed patterns of violence by the personnel of multiple PMCs, the article concludes that the use of ‘mercenaries' is in principle still possible, doable and defensible - after the necessary reforms and improvements have been made.

These activities should be compositional {{in order to reduce the}} amount of residual verification activities that must be conducted on the composite in addition to the ones conducted on each components. In order to ensure the correctness of compositional verification and assess the minimality of the residual verification, the contribution proposes to use formal specification and verification at the composition operator level. A first experiment was conducted in [15] using proof assistants to formalize the generic composition technology ISC and prove that type checking was compositional. This contribution extends our early work to handle full model conformance and study the mandatory residual verification. It shows that ISC operators are not fully compositional with respect to conformance and provides the minimal preconditions on the operators mandatory to ensure compositional conformance.

30|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} parameters for the linear growth of the GRT instability {{is believed to be the}} F-region equatorial vertical plasma velocity driven by the background zonal electric field at the magnetic equator (e.g., Fejer et al. 1999). Around sunset hours, a pre-reversal enhancement (PRE) (Eccles et al. 2015) of the zonal electric field is often observed, which produces favorable conditions for the GRT instability growth. This explains the high occurrence of ESF after sunset and during equinoctial months when the sunset terminator and magnetic meridian are aligned in most longitude sectors. The alignment between the terminator and the magnetic meridian enhances the magnitude of the PRE (Abdu et al. 1981; Tsunoda 1985). A number of studies, however, have shown that ESF events can occur during June solstice, especially under low solar flux conditions (Patra et al. 2009; Li et al. 2011; Ajith et al. 2016). The appearance of these structures is intriguing since the amplitude of the PRE is extremely reduced during these conditions. A better understanding of the processes contributing to June solstice irregularities is a topic of current interest and investigation. In addition to the PRE, it is also believed that plasma fluctuations in the equatorial bottomside F-region could be responsible for the observed variability in ESF occurrence (Tsunoda et al. 2011). These plasma perturbations would provide initial perturbations (seed waves) that are amplified by the instability process and develop into the large-scale plasma depletions associated with ESF. It has been suggested that, when the initial perturbations have significant amplitudes, ESF can develop even under weak/absent <b>PRE</b> <b>conditions</b> (Abdu et al. 2009; Tsunoda et al. 2010).|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Hashing {{has yet to}} {{be widely}} {{accepted}} as a component of hard real-time systems and hardware implementations, due to still ex isting prejudices concerning the unpredictability of space and time re quirements resulting from collisions. While in theory perfect hashing can provide optimal mapping, in practice, finding a perfect hash function is too expensive, especially in the context of high-speed applications. The introduction of hashing with multiple choices, d-left hashing and Bloom filter-based hash table summaries, has caused a shift towards guaranteed single-DRAM access. However, these guarantees come at a high price. High amounts of rare and expensive high-speed SRAM needs to be traded off for predictability. Moreover, it is infeasible for many applications to provide enough on-chip memory. In this paper we show that previous suggestions suffer from the false <b>pre</b> <b>condition</b> of full generality. To provide a workable solution, our approach exploits four individual degrees of freedom available in many practica...|$|R

Pb and As are exported along with dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from these organic-rich systems, {{but it is not}} yet clear which hydrological (<b>pre)</b> <b>conditions</b> favor their export. This study combines a 1 -year monitoring of precipitation, bog water level and pore water concentration changes with bog discharge and DOC, iron, As and Pb stream concentrations. From these data, annual DOC, As, and Pb exports were calculated. Concentrations ranged from 5 to 30 mg L − 1 for DOC, 0. 2 to 1. 9 μg L − 1 for As, and 1. 3 to 12 μg L − 1 for Pb, with highest concentrations in late summer. As and Pb concentrations significantly correlated with DOC concentrations. Fluxes depended strongly on discharge, as 40 % of As and 43 % of Pb were exported during 10 % of the time with the highest discharge, pointing out the over-proportional contribution of short-time, high-discharge events to annual As, Pb and DOC export. Exponential increase in element export from the bog is explained by connection of additional DOC, As and Pb pools in the acrotelm during water table rise, which is most pronounced after drought. Pb, As and DOC concentrations in pore water provide evidence of an increase in the soluble Pb pool as soon as the peat layer becomes hydrologically connected, while DOC and As peak concentrations in runoff lag behind in comparison to Pb. Our data indicate a distinct bog-specific discharge threshold of 8 L s − 1, which is thought to depend mainly on the bogs size and drainage conditions. Above this threshold, element concentrations do not further increase and discharge becomes diluted. Combining pore water and discharge data shows that As and Pb exports are dependent on not only the amount of precipitation and discharge but also on the frequency and depth of water table fluctuations. Comparing the annual bog As and Pb export with element inventories indicates that As is much more mobilized than Pb, with annual fluxes accounting for 0. 85 and 0. 27 ‰ of total As and Pb inventory, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Context: Video {{stabilization}} {{techniques have}} gained popularity for their permit to obtain {{high quality video}} footage even in non-optimal conditions. There have been significant works done on video stabilization by developing different algorithms. Most of the stabilization software displays the missing image areas in stabilized video. In {{the last few years}} hand-held video cameras have continued to grow in popularity, allowing everyone to easily produce personal video footage. Furthermore, with online video sharing resources being used by a rapidly increasing number of users, a large proportion of such video footage is shared with wide audiences. Sadly such videos often suffer from poor quality as frame vibration in video makes human perception not comfortable. In this research an attempt has been made to propose a robust video stabilization algorithm that stabilizes the videos effectively. Objectives: The main objective of our thesis work is to perform effective motion estimation using SIFT features to calculate the inter frame motion, allowing to find Global Motion Vectors and optimal motion compensation is to be achieved using adaptive fuzzy filter by removing the unwanted shakiness and preserve the panning leading to stabilized video. Methods: In this study three types of research questions are used- Experimentation and Literature review. To accomplish the goal of this thesis, experimentation is carried out for performing video stabilization. Motion estimation is done using feature based motion estimation using SIFT and GMVs are calculated. The intentional motion is filtered using Adaptive fuzzy filter to preserve panning and Motion compensation is performed to wrap the video to its stabilized position. MOS implies the mean scores of the subjective tests performed according to the recommendations of ITU-R BT. 500 - 13 and ITU-T P. 910 to analyze the results of our stabilized videos.

Presently, close to 90 of the worldwide solar cell production is based on crystalline silicon c Si wafers; in the remaining market share, thin film amorphous a Si, micro and nano crystalline Si is dominating. A priceless advantage is the nearly boundless availability, the environ mental sustainability, and the knowledge about Si, which has been accumulated in recent years in microelectronic device manufacturing. Thermally prepared Si oxide SiO 2 layers are characterized by high chemical and electrical stability and provide excellent surface passiva tion. In Si thin film structures, which are necessary for solar cell applications, interfaces takes up {{a major part of the}} device and recombination losses due to interface defects. Moreover, on textured surfaces, which are utilized in high efficiency solar cells to enhance anti reflection properties, the interface area and the crystallographic irregularities are increased and conse quently surface defects become more critical to the electronic device properties of subse quently prepared thin and ultra thin oxide layers. It is well known from investigations of MOS devices that the quality of thin thermal oxide films strongly depends on interface micro roughness and oxide density and that interfacial defects give rise to interface elec tronic charges such as interface trapped charges and fixed oxide charge. Therefore, successful applications of ultra thin silicon oxide films in solar cells manufacturing require alternative smoothing and oxidation methods to achieve Si SiO 2 interfaces with low micro roughness lt;dr gt; and low interface state density Dit. We established correlations be tween surface morphology, interface charge, interface defects and interface recombination losses at polished, saw damage etched and textured substrates.
