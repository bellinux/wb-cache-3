5|$|The elite, hand-selected {{audience}} members favored with admission to performances by the concerto delle donne demanded diversions and entertainment beyond {{the pleasures of}} beautiful music alone. During the concerts, members of the concertos audience would sometimes <b>play</b> <b>cards.</b> Orazio Urbani, ambassador of the Grand Duke of Tuscany, having waited several years to see the concerto, complained that he was forced not only to <b>play</b> <b>cards,</b> distracting him from the performance, but also simultaneously admire and praise the women's music to their patron Alfonso. After at least one concert, to continue the entertainment, a dwarf couple danced. Alfonso was not as interested in these peripheral entertainments, and in one instance excused himself from the party to go sit under a tree {{to listen to the}} ladies, and follow along with the madrigal texts and musical scores, including embellishments, which were made available to listeners.|$|E
5|$|Edward {{had been}} invited to stay at Tranby Croft, Yorkshire, the home of Arthur Wilson and his family. Among Edward's party were his advisers, Lord Coventry and Lieutenant-General Owen Williams; Gordon-Cumming, a friend of the prince, was also invited. On the first night the guests played baccarat, and Stanley Wilson thought he saw Gordon-Cumming {{illegally}} adding to his stake. Stanley informed other members of the Wilson family, and they agreed to watch him on the following evening. Gordon-Cumming was again seen to be acting in a suspicious manner. The family members asked the advice of the royal courtiers who, with the agreement of the prince, confronted Gordon-Cumming and pressured him into signing a document that declared he would never <b>play</b> <b>cards</b> again, in exchange for the silence of the guests.|$|E

25|$|In 1956, Hiroshi Yamauchi, {{grandson}} of Fusajiro Yamauchi, visited the U.S. {{to talk with}} the United States <b>Playing</b> <b>Card</b> Company, the dominant <b>playing</b> <b>card</b> manufacturer there. He found that the biggest <b>playing</b> <b>card</b> company in the world was using only a small office. Yamauchi's realization that the <b>playing</b> <b>card</b> business had limited potential was a turning point. He then acquired the license to use Disney characters on <b>playing</b> <b>cards</b> to drive sales.|$|R

50|$|Nintendo was {{originally}} a <b>playing</b> <b>card</b> company in Kyoto. In 1958, Nintendo's then president Hiroshi Yamauchi visited the U.S. <b>Playing</b> <b>Card</b> Company's office and factory. He {{was shocked at}} the humble size of the office, despite USPCC being the top selling <b>playing</b> <b>card</b> company nationally in the U.S and also worldwide. Yamauchi understood Nintendo's limited potential if it continued to operate only in the <b>playing</b> <b>card</b> business, and so he famously began to diversify away from <b>playing</b> <b>cards</b> into other types of gaming.|$|R
50|$|Jerry's Nugget <b>playing</b> <b>cards</b> were {{supposedly}} {{printed in}} the 1970s for the gaming tables, but never saw any action at the gambling table. They were immediately sold in the gift store thereafter. The classic Jerry's Nugget <b>playing</b> <b>cards</b> were made from {{top of the line}} United States <b>Playing</b> <b>Card</b> Company card stock, that is not available today, which makes the cards much thinner than today's <b>playing</b> <b>cards.</b> The <b>Playing</b> <b>Card</b> Company also used a chemical finish then, which is also not available today due to environmental reasons.|$|R

5000|$|Taxes on <b>playing</b> <b>cards.</b> States used {{taxes on}} <b>playing</b> <b>cards</b> to {{generate}} revenue, and required specific stamps or wrappers on packs of cards. Such arrangements can create barriers for smaller manufacturers producing cards by hand. The Ottoman Empire introduced taxes on <b>playing</b> <b>cards</b> in 1904.|$|R
25|$|Another popular running gag {{concerned}} the social habits of Benny's on-air orchestra, who were consistently {{portrayed as a}} bunch of drunken ne'er-do-wells. Led first by Phil Harris and later by Bob Crosby, the orchestra, and in particular band member Frank Remley, were jokingly portrayed as often being too drunk to play properly, using an overturned bass drum to <b>play</b> <b>cards</b> on just minutes before a show, and so enamored of liquor that {{the sight of a}} glass of milk would make them sick. Remley was portrayed in various unflattering situations, such as being thrown into a garbage can by a road sweeper who had found him passed out in the street at 4am, and on a wanted poster at the Beverly Hills police station.|$|E
25|$|While {{ground beef}} {{was used by}} various {{cultures}} in Europe and Central Asia, the hamburger's other vital ingredient, bread, has a different history. Bread had {{always been part of}} the development of many types of foods, including sauces, such as those described by Marie-Antoine Carême in his compendium entitled L'art de la cuisine française au XIXe siècle. The word sandwich was not recorded until the 18th century. Many cultures claim invention of the sandwich, but it was given its name around the year 1765 in honor of the English aristocrat John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich, who preferred to eat sandwiches so he could <b>play</b> <b>cards</b> without soiling his fingers. However, it was not until 1840 when Elizabeth Leslie Cook included a sandwich recipe in her cookbook that it appeared in the local cuisine of the United States.|$|E
25|$|To {{heal and}} get better, Bourguiba's family sent young Habib {{to his brother}} Mohamed in Kef and therefore, enjoy natural landscapes and good {{mountain}} air. His brother, a 39 years old medic at the local hospital, was very appreciated by {{the inhabitants of the}} city. From January 1920, he welcomed his brother warmly for twenty one months. This long two years journey was a turning point in his life. Indeed, far away from the horrible school conditions and the abuse of both Dahouia and his sister-in-law, the skinny pale teenager could finally evolve into a confident man. His brother Mohamed played a major part in this change of personality, being open-minded, modernist and advocating for secularism. Mohamed lived with an Italian nurse who was not that snub bourgeoisie. On the contrary, she warmly welcomed him and had a great part in his metamorphosis, filling the emotional void of the young boy. Likewise, Mohamed was a great lover of theater and former director of the drama troupe Ech-Chahama, who had stopped its activities because of the war. Between 1909 and 1913, it performed famous plays such as Hamlet, Mejnoun Leila... Since it reprised its activities, Bourguiba rehearsed with his brother and participated in plays that gave him insurance. Unfortunately, the rehearsed play was prohibited by authorities because it recalled the situation of Netherlands people under Spanish colonization. However, Bourguiba enjoyed his brother's sympathy toward the Kef inhabitants: He learned to <b>play</b> <b>cards,</b> discussed military strategy, got interested in Mustafa Kemal Atatürk then visited his other brother Ahmed in Thala with whom he learned horseriding.|$|E

500|$|Washington lived {{an aristocratic}} lifestyle—fox hunting was a {{favorite}} leisure activity. He also enjoyed going to dances and parties, {{in addition to the}} theater, races, and cockfights. He also was known to <b>play</b> <b>cards,</b> backgammon, and billiards. Like most Virginia planters, he imported luxuries and other goods from England and paid for them by exporting his tobacco crop. [...] By 1764, these luxuries, coupled with a poor tobacco market, left Washington ₤1,800 in debt. He began to pull himself out of debt in the mid-1760s by diversifying his previously tobacco-centric business interests into other ventures and paying more attention to his affairs, especially in the form of buying fewer imported luxuries.|$|E

500|$|The British {{perceived}} him as too German, and in {{the opinion}} of historian Ragnhild Hatton, wrongly assumed that he had a succession of German mistresses. However, in mainland Europe, he was seen as a progressive ruler supportive of the Enlightenment who permitted his critics to publish without risk of severe censorship, and provided sanctuary to Voltaire when the philosopher was exiled from Paris in 1726. European and British sources agree that George was reserved, temperate and financially prudent; George disliked to be in the public light at social events, avoided the royal box at the opera and often travelled incognito to the house of a friend to <b>play</b> <b>cards.</b> Despite some unpopularity, the Protestant George I was seen by most of his subjects as a better alternative to the Roman Catholic Pretender James.

In this way, they hoped to win all of Wickliffe's money, then return it to him in exchange for his promise to forsake the vice. On the night appointed, however, it was Wickliffe who won all the money wagered by Duval and Oldham, despite their schemes. When Wickliffe later learned of the designs of his friends, he agreed to give up gambling.|$|E
