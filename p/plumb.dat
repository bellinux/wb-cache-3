5|$|In 1968, at Ciudad de Mexico, <b>Plumb</b> took an {{individual}} 14th, while the US team again {{finished with a}} silver. In 1970, when Jack le Goff became coach of the United States eventing team, <b>Plumb</b> {{was one of only}} three active US riders with international experience in the sport.

At the 1976 Games, <b>Plumb</b> achieved his only individual medal, taking silver, while the US team took gold. Despite the US boycott of the 1980 Moscow Olympics, <b>Plumb</b> competed at the alternate games in Fontainebleau, France. The team repeated this performance at the 1984 Olympics, while <b>Plumb</b> took {{an individual}} 10th place. In 1988, he was slated to make the US Equestrian Team, but was not able to compete due to a fall that resulted in a broken collarbone.

5|$|As of 2008, <b>Plumb</b> was the US Olympic athlete {{with the}} {{greatest}} number of appearances in any sport at the Games. He was named to the US team in every Olympic games between 1960 (his first) and 1984, as well as appearing for the last time at the 1992 Summer Olympics, and competed at all of the Games except for 1980, when the US did not compete. During his seven Olympic appearances, he gathered multiple medals. At the 1960 Summer Olympics, <b>Plumb</b> took an individual 15th, while the US team did not finish the competition. At the 1964 Games, he repeated his individual performance, while the US team improved to take the silver medal. At these Games, he became the first rider ever to win a medal on a horse that he had never previously ridden in competition. <b>Plumb</b> had planned to ride his main event horse, Markham, but on the flight to the Games in Tokyo, the horse panicked, possibly due to a bad experience previously suffered in a horse trailer. In order to keep him from destroying his stall and potentially the aircraft, the horse was euthanized. <b>Plumb</b> instead rode Bold Minstrel, a horse loaned to him by another top-level eventer.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the first}} modern {{measurements}} of the precise cardinal orientations of the pyramids by Flinders Petrie, various astronomical methods have been proposed for the original establishment of these orientations. It was recently proposed that this was done by observing the positions of two stars in the Plough / Big Dipper which was known to Egyptians as the thigh. It is thought that a vertical alignment between these two stars checked with a <b>plumb</b> bob was used to ascertain where north lay. The deviations from true north using this model reflect the accepted dates of construction.|$|E

5|$|Known {{since the}} Middle Ages {{by the name}} <b>plumb</b> dulcis, the {{production}} of lead(II) nitrate from either metallic lead or lead oxide in nitric acid was small-scale, for direct use in making other lead compounds. In the 19th century lead(II) nitrate began to be produced commercially in Europe and the United States. Historically, the main use was as a raw material {{in the production of}} pigments for lead paints, but such paints have been superseded by less toxic paints based on titanium dioxide. Other industrial uses included heat stabilization in nylon and polyesters, and in coatings of photothermographic paper. Since around the year 2000, lead(II) nitrate has begun to be used in gold cyanidation.|$|E
5|$|Both Houses of Congress were majority-Republican, {{but their}} {{solutions}} differed. The House {{passed a bill}} in June 1890 requiring the government to purchase 4.5 million ounces of silver each month (in addition to the $2â€“ $4 million required to be coined under Blandâ€“Allison). The Senate passed a bill by Republican Preston B. <b>Plumb</b> of Kansas for free coinage of silver at the legal (16:1) ratio. Sherman voted against Plumb's bill, but {{was appointed to the}} conference committee to produce a compromise bill that, now called the Sherman Silver Purchase Act, passed that July. The Treasury would buy 4.5 million ounces of silver and would issue Treasury Notes to pay for it, which would be redeemable in gold or silver. The law also provided that the Treasury could coin more silver dollars if the Secretary believed it necessary to redeem the new notes. Sherman thought the bill was the least harmful option. Harrison believed it would end the controversy, and he signed it into law. The effect of the bill, however, was the increased depletion of the nation's gold supply.|$|E
5|$|Observatories were {{constructed}} {{to the north}} and south of the mountain, plus a bothy to accommodate equipment and the scientists. Most of the workforce was however housed in rough canvas tents. Maskelyne's astronomical measurements were the first to be conducted. It was necessary for him to determine the zenith distances with respect to the <b>plumb</b> line for a set of stars at the precise time that each passed due south. Weather conditions were frequently unfavourable due to mist and rain. However, from the south observatory, he was able to take 76 measurements on 34 stars in one direction, and then 93 observations on 39 stars in the other. From the north side, he then conducted a set of 68 observations on 32 stars and a set of 100 on 37 stars. By conducting sets of measurements with the plane of the zenith sector first facing east and then west, he successfully avoided any systematic errors arising from collimating the sector.|$|E

5|$|The Egyptians worked {{deposits}} {{of the lead}} ore galena at Gebel Rosas to make net sinkers, <b>plumb</b> bobs, and small figurines. Copper {{was the most important}} metal for toolmaking in ancient Egypt and was smelted in furnaces from malachite ore mined in the Sinai. Workers collected gold by washing the nuggets out of sediment in alluvial deposits, or by the more labor-intensive process of grinding and washing gold-bearing quartzite. Iron deposits found in upper Egypt were utilized in the Late Period. High-quality building stones were abundant in Egypt; the ancient Egyptians quarried limestone all along the Nile valley, granite from Aswan, and basalt and sandstone from the wadis of the eastern desert. Deposits of decorative stones such as porphyry, greywacke, alabaster, and carnelian dotted the eastern desert and were collected even before the First Dynasty. In the Ptolemaic and Roman Periods, miners worked {{deposits of}} emeralds in Wadi Sikait and amethyst in Wadi el-Hudi.|$|E

5|$|The {{chair of}} European Parliament Mediator for International Parental Child Abduction was {{established}} in 1987 by initiative of British politician and MEP Charles Henry <b>Plumb,</b> {{with the goal of}} helping minor children of international couples victim of parental abduction. The Mediator finds negotiated solutions in the higher interest of the minor when said minor is abducted by a parent following separation of the couple, regardless whether married or unmarried. Since its institution, the chair has been held by Mairead McGuinnes (since 2014), Roberta Angelilli (2009-2014), Evelyne Gebhardt (2004-2009), Mary Banotti (1995-2004), and Marie-Claude Vayssade (1987-1994). The Mediator's main task is to assist parents in finding a solution in the minor's best interest through mediation, i.e. a form of controversy resolution alternative to lawsuit. The Mediator is activated by request of a citizen and, after evaluating the request, starts a mediation process aimed at reaching an agreement. Once subscribed by both parties and the Mediator, the agreement is official. The nature of the agreement is that of a private contract between parties. In defining the agreement, the European Parliament offers the parties the juridical support necessary to reach a sound, lawful agreement based on legality and equity. The agreement can be ratified by the competent national courts and can also lay the foundation for consensual separation or divorce.|$|E
