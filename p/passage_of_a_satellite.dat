25|$|In {{the early}} 1960s an outside {{broadcast}} {{was made from}} {{the very top of}} the tower, in which the first <b>passage</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>satellite</b> across the London sky was watched and described. It continued to be used for BBC News broadcasts until 1969, and for the Open University until the early 1980s. The antenna mast still stands and is used for local terrestrial television transmission, local commercial radio and DAB broadcasts. The main London television transmitter is now at Crystal Palace in south London.|$|E
50|$|Transits and occultations of the Sun by Earth's Moon {{are called}} solar eclipses {{regardless}} of whether the Sun is completely or partially covered. By extension, transits of the Sun by a satellite of a planet may also be called eclipses, as with the transits of Phobos and Deimos shown on NASA's JPL photojournal, as may the <b>passage</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>satellite</b> into the planet's shadow, as with this eclipse of Phobos. The term eclipse is also used more generally for bodies passing in front of one another. For example, a NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day refers to the Moon eclipsing and occulting Saturn interchangeably.|$|E
40|$|We present {{evidence}} for a Galactic North-South asymmetry in the number density and bulk velocity of solar neighborhood stars. The number density profile, which is derived from main-sequence stars in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, shows a (North - South) /(North + South) deficit at |z| ~ 400 pc and an excess at |z| ~ 800 pc. The bulk velocity profile, which {{is derived from the}} Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding and Exploration, shows a gradual trend across the Galactic midplane as well as smaller-scale features. We speculate that the North-South asymmetry, which has the appearance of a wavelike perturbation, is intrinsic to the disk. We explore the physics of this phenomenon through an analysis of the linearized Boltzmann and Poisson equations and through one-dimensional simulations. The perturbation may be excited by the <b>passage</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>satellite</b> galaxy or dark matter subhalo through the Galactic disk, in which case we are witnessing a recent disk-heating event.

An 8. 1 -second drop in signal, recorded simultaneously at both sites, is interpreted as resulting from the <b>passage</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> third <b>satellite</b> <b>of</b> Neptune {{in front of the}} star. From the duration of the event, the derived minimum diameter for an object sharing Neptune's motion is 180 kilometers.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} {{photometry}} for young star clusters in M 31, which are selected from Caldwell et al. These star clusters {{have been observed}} {{as part of the}} Beijing [...] Arizona [...] Taiwan [...] Connecticut (BATC) Multicolor Sky Survey from 1995 February to 2008 March. The BATC images including these star clusters are taken with 15 intermediate-band filters covering 3000 [...] 10000 Å. Combined with photometry in the GALEX far- and near-ultraviolet, broad-band UBVRI, SDSS ugriz, and infrared JHK_ s of Two Micron All Sky Survey, we obtain their accurate spectral energy distributions (SEDs) from 1538 - 20000 Å. We derive these star clusters' ages and masses by comparing their SEDs with stellar population synthesis models. Our results are in good agreement with previous determinations. The mean value of age and mass of young clusters (< 2 Gyr) is about 385 Myr and 2 × 10 ^ 4 M_, respectively. There are two distinct peaks in the age distribution, a highest peak at age ∼ 60 Myr and a secondary peak around 250 Myr, while the mass distribution shows a single peak around 10 ^ 4 M_. A few young star clusters have two-body relaxation times greater than their ages, indicating that those clusters have not been well dynamically relaxed and therefore have not established the thermal equilibrium. There are several regions showing aggregations of young star clusters around the 10 kpc ring and the outer ring, indicating that the distribution of the young star clusters is well correlated with M 31 's star-forming regions. The young massive star clusters (age ≤ 100 Myr and mass ≥ 10 ^ 4 M_) show apparent concentration around the ring splitting region, suggesting a recent <b>passage</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>satellite</b> galaxy (M 32) through M 31 disk.
