40|$|The present paper {{concerns}} the structural behaviour of <b>clad</b> <b>pipes.</b> This {{is a double}} wall pipe, composed by two pipes that are in contact through an appropriate manufacturing procedure; a thick-walled carbon steel "outer pipe", and a thin-walled corrosion-resistant inner pipe, referred to as "liner" pipe. To predict the bending response and the buckling curvature of the thin-walled liner, {{it is necessary to}} account for its contact with the confining thick-walled outer pipe. Because of this confinement, existing numerical solutions or analytical predictions for the bending buckling resistance of unconfined thin-walled tubes are inadequate to predict the buckling resistance of the bent liner. In the present work, the problem is solved numerically, using nonlinear finite elements to simulate the <b>clad</b> <b>pipe,</b> accounting for the interaction between the liner and the outer pipe. First, the manufacturing process of the <b>clad</b> <b>pipe</b> is simulated to determine the liner hoop prestressing. Subsequently, bending curvature is applied (with and without the presence of external pressure). Stresses and strains are monitored throughout the deformation stage with emphasis on possible detachment of the liner from the outer pipe and the formation of local buckling on the liner wall.

40|$|Pipelines are an {{essential}} part of the oil and gas offshore industry, for transporting unprocessed oil and gas from the seabed to the oil platform and to the mainland. The unprocessed oil and gas leaves a corrosive environment, which sets a demand for pipes with a corrosion resistant interior. <b>Clad</b> <b>pipes</b> meet this demand with a corrosion resistant, stainless steel interior and an outer carbon steel layer. There is of today no repair contingency for <b>clad</b> <b>pipes.</b> A knowledge basis needs to be established and the risk of hydrogen induced stress cracking (HISC) must be found. This thesis work has been divided into two parts; One part working on experimentally testing of the triple point in welded <b>clad</b> <b>pipes.</b> Focused on fracture resistance curves, fracture toughness and crack path, with and without hydrogen present. The second part was focused on modelling a FE-model that was able to simulate crack propagation in <b>clad</b> <b>pipe</b> interface samples, experimentally tested by Jemblie. Both with and without hydrogen present during testing. Fracture mechanical testing of welded <b>clad</b> <b>pipe</b> C(T) samples have been successfully conducted, in air and under cathodic protection (CP). The samples with Ni-interlayer showed almost no reduction in fracture toughness from tests in air to tests under CP, with an average fracture toughness reduction of 0. 13 %. The small fracture toughness reduction may be explained by the crack path going into the Ni-interlayer which is not much susceptible to hydrogen embrittlement (HE). The samples without Ni-interlayer experienced a high decrease in fracture toughness tested under CP, with an average reduction in fracture toughness equal to 92 %. The crack path in the samples without Ni-interlayer was examined in a light optical microscope (LOM). The test done in air showed a crack path shifting between the base material and the clad. The crack propagated mainly in the clad in the sample tested under CP. Not enough samples were tested to establish the fracture resistance curves for the samples without Ni-interlayer. A 2 D FE-model with cohesive zone elements was successfully modelled. The FE-model was able to simulate crack propagation along the crack ligament, in a C(T) specimen, both with linear elastic and elastic-plastic materials. The FE-model was however not able to simulate the crack propagation observed in experimentally testing by Jemblie. This was not possible due to numerical problems occurring after a few cohesive elements had failed, when using sufficiently high cohesive element parameter values. For further work should more tests in both air and under CP be done on welded samples, with and without a Ni-interlayer. To establish the fracture resistance curves for both sample types. The microstructure on the samples without Ni-interlayer needs to be checked, to be sure that the samples are representative for welded <b>clad</b> <b>pipes.</b> The fractography must be studied and the cross section on multiply samples must be examined, on the samples without Ni-interlayer.

40|$|<b>Clad</b> <b>pipes</b> {{are used}} in the oil and gas {{industry}} for transportation of corrosive substances. Maintenance, repairs and tie-in connections to existing subsea structures is done by hyperbaric welding. There is per today no repair contingency available for <b>clad</b> <b>pipes,</b> so that a knowledge basis must be established in order to maintain pipeline integrity. Welding of <b>clad</b> <b>pipes</b> can result in a variety of complex microstructures due to the presence of dissimilar alloys. The difference in chemical composition and thermal properties will influence the integrity of the welded joint, and may result in a crack susceptible microstructure. Previous work has shown that carbon migration and subsequent carbide precipitation in the clad, mainly during production, results in a hardened region in the clad. After welding, this region is susceptible to cracking. However, adding a Ni-interlayer between the clad and base metal (BM) provides a solution to the cracking related to the formation of a hard zone in the clad. Nevertheless, cracks may also arise from hydrogen charging from welding or from cathodic protection (CP) or H 2 S during service, so that the cold cracking mechanisms of <b>clad</b> <b>pipes</b> is still highly relevant. In this master s thesis, <b>clad</b> <b>pipes</b> with and without a Ni-interlayer have been investigated. The dissimilar interface region and carbides in the clad adjacent to the interface have been investigated using scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM). The clad immediately adjacent to the interface contained Cr 23 C 6 carbides, present both inside grains and at grain boundaries. The dissimilar interface showed a jagged distribution of Ni towards the clad side and segregation of Cr to carbides. The dissimilar interface showed a lath-like structure, however, there was no clear evidence of martensite. This should be further investigated. Slow strain rate (SSR) testing was successfully performed on miniature compact tension (CT) specimens in air and under CP to evaluate the fracture mechanical properties of the dissimilar interface, with respect to material combination and environment. Generally, samples without a Ni-interlayer tested in air showed the highest fracture toughness values, followed by samples with a Ni-interlayer tested in both air and under CP. The lowest fracture toughness values were obtained for samples without a Ni-interlayer tested under CP. Samples with a Ni-interlayer showed an average reduction in CTOD of 7 % in the presence of hydrogen. The minute effect of hydrogen is attributed to the samples failing mainly in the softer Ni-interlayer close to the BM, which has low susceptibility to hydrogen embrittlement (HE). Samples without a Ni-interlayer showed an average reduction in CTOD of 77 % in the presence of hydrogen. The samples failed mainly in the decarburized BM adjacent to the interface, and along the interface. None of the samples failed in the previously suspected crack susceptible region in the clad. Future work should focus on determining the mechanisms behind cracking in the clad by physical weld simulations combined with fracture mechanical testing, and numerical weld simulations to assess any residual stresses...|$|R

40|$|Corrosion under {{insulation}} (CUI) is {{a common}} cause of pipeline failure in {{the oil and gas}} industry. Its detection with conventional inspection techniques is challenging due to the presence of the insulation layer and a protective metallic cladding that prevent direct access to the pipe surface.

The <b>pipe</b> and metallic <b>cladding</b> naturally form a large coaxial transmission line in which the insulation acts as a dielectric and supports the propagation of microwave signals.

40|$|The {{increasing}} demand for energy has motivated {{the oil and}} natural gas exploration in very hostile environments, including very deep water operation and the transport of corrosive fluids. Technological advances favor the use of high strength steel pipelines either clad or mechanically lined with a corrosion resistant alloy (CRA), such as Alloy 625, for the transport of corrosive hydrocarbons. Moreover, these pipelines are subjected to severe installation conditions and a case of interest is the pipe reeling process which allows pipe welding and inspection to be conducted at onshore facilities. While cost effective, fracture assessments and specification of critical flaw sizes for the girth welds of lined/clad pipes become more complex due to the dissimilar nature of these materials and the high levels of plastic strain imposed during installation. In particular, effective analyses of crack driving forces in undermatched or partially mismatched pipe girth welds remain essential to determine more accurate acceptable flaw sizes for the piping system based upon conventional ECA procedures.

40|$|The {{development}} of an offshore gas field involves production {{of oil and gas}} from subsea wells. Design considerations for a particular subsea system have identified the maximum temperature for operations which is greater than 130 °C. Consequently, for large diameter flowlines, this precludes the use of duplex stainless steels as CRA&# 039;s (corrosion resistant alloys) for service under the expected operating conditions. Attention has therefore focused on alternative CRA&# 039;s such as austenitic stainless steels and Ni based alloys as mechanically clad or lined <b>clad</b> <b>pipe</b> for carbon steel subsea gas flowlines. One design concern is the recognized temperature limit for CRA materials, such as 316 L stainless steel and similar alloys in production fluids is taken to be 120 °C.

40|$|Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) are a {{powerful}} tool {{used to evaluate the}} performance of NDE methods; however, the need to manufacture and scan many test pieces with realistic defects means that they are expensive and time-consuming to produce. Advances in computational power now mean {{that it is possible to}} use numerical models to greatly increase the efficiency of producing ROC for practical applications. A Model Assisted Probability of Detection (MAPOD) framework has been developed to predict the performance of magnetic field measurement NDE techniques. The MAPOD method is used to predict the performance of a promising new technique relying on the deflection of a current injected into a pipe at remote locations, and measurement of the resulting magnetic field perturbations due to defects. A significant proportion of pipes cannot be inspected by pigging methods, and external inspection often requires complete coating removal; therefore, an NDE method that functions outside <b>pipe</b> coatings and <b>cladding</b> is attractive. In this method, changes in the radial and axial components of the field are measured and attributed to defects, but a strong azimuthal component means that misalignment can give significant apparent radial and axial signals due to the azimuthal field apparently having a component in these directions. This requires that the second-order gradient of the magnetic field be measured to maximise sensitivity. Fluctuations in the sensitivity and orientation of the gradiometer during the scan are expected to determine the maximum sensitivity of the technique in most practical applications; however, the flexibility of the framework allows performance to be rapidly predicted and quantified for many test scenarios. Results suggest good detection performance for defects greater than 15 % of the wall thickness (T = 7. 1 mm) in a 6 ″ pipe with 2 A (200 A/m 2) current injected when measuring above typical insulation thickness (25 – 50 mm) ...|$|R
40|$|Recently, X 65 {{carbon steel}} <b>pipes</b> {{internally}} <b>clad</b> {{with a thin}} Inconel 625 alloy lining are highly used. However, during welding the Inconel 625 lining in the root pass, the weld bead is uneven. To avoid weld defects in the successive passes, an additional grinding procedure is always required to flatten the weld bead. It is known that as an indispensable component in GMAW, the shielding gas can protect the liquid metal from oxidation and defects in the atmosphere. The shielding gas composition greatly determines {{the characteristics of the}} welding arc which plays {{a significant role in the}} heat, mass transfer during welding and flow motion in the weld pool. It is proposed that the uneven weld bead can possibly be improved by changing the shielding gas composition during welding the Inconel 625 lining. Therefore, it is necessary to study the effect of shielding gas composition on the weld bead geometry during short-circuit gas metal arc welding (GMAW) of Inconel 625 alloy. In this research, short-circuit GMAW of the Inconel 625 lining was reproduced in a laboratory scale. Three kinds of gas, argon (Ar), helium (He) and carbon dioxide (CO 2) were considered and two types of experimental configurations, bead-on-plate welding and U-shaped groove butt welding were performed. It was found that the shielding gas composition could make a great influence on the arc voltage, power of the heat source (welding arc), flow motion in the weld pool and the resultant geometry of the weld bead. For the Ar-He shielding gas mixtures, the arc voltage is increased as the He content is increased, which is attributed that the ionisation potential of He is higher than that of Ar. As a consequence, with an increase of the He content, the heat source (the welding arc) becomes more powerful and more heat is transferred to the workpiece. A larger fusion area is created. For the Ar-CO 2 shielding gas mixtures, it was found that adding 3. 3 % CO 2 to Ar could raise the arc voltage and lead to a more powerful welding arc. More importantly, the presence of oxygen which is dissociated from CO 2 can largely reduce the surface tension of the liquid metal. The temperature gradient of the surface tension can be changed from negative to positive and the direction of the Marangoni convection which is driven by the surface tension force will be changed from outward and upward to inward and downward. The efficiency of the heat transfer from the surface of the weld pool to the bottom is greatly enhanced. Consequently, addition of 3. 3 % CO 2 to Ar can deepen the penetration and enlarge the fusion area. Aerospace EngineeringAerospace Structures & Material...|$|R
