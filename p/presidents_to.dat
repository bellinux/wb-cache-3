5|$|Reform was {{demanded by}} such voices as U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt, who decried the {{brutality}} and foul {{play of the}} game, and called a meeting of school <b>presidents</b> <b>to</b> discuss the issue.

The forward pass was also introduced to open up the game and reduce the role of dangerous mass formations. Despite the planned changes, a number of universities banned the sport for the coming year, including Columbia, NYU, and Northwestern.|$|E
5|$|The {{return of}} {{democracy}} and government reforms beginning in 1986 were hampered by national debt, government corruption, coup attempts, disasters, a persistent communist insurgency, and a military conflict with Moro separatists. During Corazon Aquino's administration, U.S. forces withdrew from the Philippines, due to {{the rejection of the}} U.S. Bases Extension Treaty, and leading to the official transfer of Clark Air Base in November 1991 and Subic Bay to the government in December 1992. The administration also faced a series of natural disasters, including the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in June 1991.

5|$|Cleveland {{nominated}} 41 lower {{federal court}} judges {{in addition to}} his four Supreme Court justices. These included two judges to the United States circuit courts, nine judges to the United States Courts of Appeals, and 30 judges to the United States district courts. Because Cleveland served terms both before and after Congress eliminated the circuit courts in favor of the Courts of Appeals, he is one of only two <b>presidents</b> <b>to</b> have appointed judges to both bodies. The other, Benjamin Harrison, was in office {{at the time that the}} change was made. Thus, all of Cleveland's appointments to the circuit courts were made in his first term, and all of his appointments to the Courts of Appeals were made in his second.|$|E
5|$|By {{executive}} order, Bevin required {{all state}} agencies to reduce spending {{in their current}} budgets by 4.5 percent. House Speaker Greg Stumbo argued that Bevin {{did not have the}} authority to order such reductions without legislative approval, but Senate President Robert Stivers defended Bevin's action, saying it amounted to simply not spending money that was previously allocated. Bevin later compromised with the state's public college and university <b>presidents</b> <b>to</b> reduce the cuts to 2 percent, but Attorney General Andy Beshear sued to stop the cuts entirely. On May 18, 2016, a Franklin Circuit Court judge ruled Bevin did have the authority to make the cuts. The Kentucky Supreme Court accepted the case on appeal, granting Beshear's request to bypass the Kentucky Court of Appeals for expediency. A hearing before the Supreme Court occurred on August 18. On September 21, 2016, the Supreme Court issued a 5–2 decision reversing the Franklin Circuit Court ruling and agreeing with Beshear that Bevin did not have the authority to make mid-year budget cuts without the approval of the General Assembly.|$|E
