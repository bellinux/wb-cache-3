40|$|Protein {{trafficking}} to {{two different}} types of vacuoles was investigated in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum cv SR 1) mesophyll protoplasts using two different vacuolar green fluorescent proteins (GFPs). One GFP is targeted to a pH-neutral vacuole by the C-terminal vacuolar sorting determinant of tobacco chitinase A, whereas the other GFP is targeted to an acidic lytic vacuole by the N-terminal propeptide of barley aleurain, which contains a sequence-specific vacuolar sorting determinant. The trafficking and final accumulation in the central vacuole (CV) or in smaller peripheral vacuoles differed for the two reporter proteins, depending on the cell type. Within 2 d, evacuolated (mini-) protoplasts regenerate a large CV. Expression of the two vacuolar GFPs in miniprotoplasts indicated that the newly formed CV was a lytic vacuole, whereas neutral vacuoles always remained peripheral.

40|$|The {{sequential}} {{development of}} multiple summit calderas of shield volcanoes gives clues {{about how the}} spatial location of shallow magma chambers evolves with time and how the magma supply into these chambers evolves. We re-interpret the sequence in which caldera collapse events {{took place at the}} Martian shield volcano Ascraeus Mons and argue that the formation of the central caldera, usually accepted to be the most recent, was followed by two further collapse events. We also present structural evidence for an early, large central caldera and, therefore, also an early large magma reservoir. This challenges the current hypothesis for Ascraeus Mons that successive magma reservoirs have increased in size as this volcano matured and that a reservoir occupied a central location within the volcano only {{at the end of its}} active lifespan. We propose that there has been a cyclical oscillation in the site of shallow storage of magma at Ascraeus Mons between central and peripheral magma reservoirs. The earliest reservoir formed centrally, but magma was subsequently redirected into peripheral reservoirs, over which the peripheral calderas formed. Later, the central location was utilized again, only to be followed once more by a development of <b>peripheral</b> <b>storage</b> reservoirs. This alternating pattern implies substantial variations with position and time in both the magma supply rate from the Martian mantle and the distribution of stresses within the volcanic edifice...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis investigates the use of" single-source shortest path algorithms in two unrelated contexts. In the first application, the label setting and label correcting algorithms are examined for applicability to and implementation within a J-S. Organization of the Joint Chiefs of Staff contingency planning model. This model has encountered problems of slow execution {{directly related to}} shortest path computations, which can be resolved by the methods proposed. Additionally, these two shortest path algorithms are examined for use within the model for identification and presentation of alternate optima when they exist. The second application involves {{the development of a}} new algorithm, called reference node aggregation, which is designed to efficiently produce a subset of the allpairs shortest path solution for large scale networks. The anticipated use of this algorithm is in connection with vehicle routing models. The motivation for producing a subset of the full solution is that only a very small subset of all possible pairs of nodes will ever be considered for consecutive visitation by a vehicle; hence, most of the information in an all-pairs solution is irrelevant. For those pairs whose exact shortest paths are not computed, a single-step approximation is devised which does not require access to <b>peripheral</b> <b>storage.</b> The new algorithm has three user-specified engineering parameters which effectively control the tradeoff between the accuracy of the subset solution and the effort required to compute it.

40|$|Finite element {{formulation}} {{based on}} compatible, assumed displacement {{fields and the}} principle of stationary potential energy is applied to analyze edge-stiffened plates. Shear deformation is considered {{in the formulation of}} the plate bending and beam bending elements by allowing independent interpolation for displacements and rotations. In addition to bending deformation, plane stress action is superposed on the plate element, while torsion and axial deformation are incorporated in the beam element, so that structural interaction between plate and edge beam elements can be facilitated. By enforcing compatible displacements and rotations across the interface between plate and beam elements, the degrees-of-freedom in one element can be related to the degrees-of-freedom of the adjoining element of a different type. Accordingly, the stiffness matrix and equivalent load vector are transformed to correspond to the common degrees-of-freedom as a result of invariance of the potential energy. By means of the direct stiffness method, the global equilibrium equation is thus established and solved by a frontal solution subroutine. Special features are introduced into the solution subroutine in order to handle varying degrees-of-freedom per node in an element and multiple loading cases. In addition, the speed of input-output transfer between in-core and <b>peripheral</b> <b>storage</b> is optimized. Convergence studies on displacements and stresses show that the current formulation with the program is capable of analyzing shear-flexible structures. The formulation allows convergence of shear-rigid solutions as a limiting case by making use of the selective reduced integration scheme when formulating individual elements. Graphs are presented to aid the design of edge-stiffened plates with two adjacent edges clamped and others cast with intersecting edge beams...|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} whether the uptake and metabolic partition of glucose are influenced by its delivery route, 12 normal volunteers underwent two 3 -h euglycemic (approximately 93 mg/dl) hyperinsulinemic (approximately 43 mU/l) clamps at a 3 - to 5 -wk interval, one with intravenous (i. v.) {{and the other with}} intraduodenal (i. d.) glucose labeled with [3 - 3 H]- and [U- 14 C]glucose. Systemic glucose was traced with [6, 6 - 2 H 2]glucose in eight subjects. During the last hour of the clamps, the average glucose infusion rate (5. 85 +/- 0. 37 vs. 5. 43 +/- 0. 43 mg. kg(- 1). min(- 1); P = 0. 02) and exogenous glucose uptake (5. 66 +/- 0. 37 vs. 5. 26 +/- 0. 41 mg. kg(- 1). min(- 1); P = 0. 04) were borderline higher in the i. d. than in the i. v. studies. The increased uptake was entirely accounted for by increased glycolysis (3 H 2 O production), which was attributed to the stimulation of gut metabolism by the absorptive process. No difference was observed in glucose storage whether it was calculated as glucose uptake minus glycolysis (i. d. vs. i. v. : 2. 44 +/- 0. 28 vs. 2. 40 +/- 0. 31 mg. kg(- 1). min(- 1)) or as glucose uptake minus net glucose oxidation (2. 86 +/- 0. 33 vs. 2. 81 +/- 0. 35 mg. kg(- 1). min(- 1)). Because peripheral tissues were exposed to identical glucose, insulin, and free fatty acid levels under the two experimental conditions, we assumed that their glucose uptake and storage were similar during the two tests. We therefore suggest that hepatic glycogen storage (estimated as whole body minus <b>peripheral</b> <b>storage)</b> was also unaffected by the route of glucose delivery. On the other hand, in the i. d. tests, the glucose splanchnic extraction ratio calculated by the dual-isotope technique averaged 4. 9 +/- 2. 3 %, which is close to the figures published for i. v. glucose. Despite the limitations related to whole body measurements, these two sets of data do not support the idea that enteral glucose stimulates hepatic uptake more efficiently than i. v. glucose...|$|E

For comparison, ultrastructural changes in female zebra fish (Brachydanio rerio) liver were studied after exposure to 100, 1, 000 and 10, 000 micrograms/l atrazine for three months (exposure from egg stage to sexual maturation; model 2). Neither epithelial nor glandular cells in the gastrointestinal tract of rainbow trout reveal cytological modifications following exposure to atrazine. In contrast, hepatocytes of rainbow trout and zebra fish clearly display dose-dependent and species-specific cytopathological effects at 40 and 1000 micrograms/l, respectively. In rainbow trout (model 1), rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) appears of particular diagnostic value {{for the effects of}} atrazine, since it already shows a full spectrum of cytological alterations after 40 micrograms/l, and since in cells without RER modifications no further cytopathological symptoms can be revealed. At 40 micrograms/l atrazine, further changes include disturbance of the intracellular compartmentation, increased heterogeneity of mitochondria (longitudinally arranged cristae, branching, size), formation of myelinated bodies as well as immigration of macrophages and granulocytes along the biliary system and the space of Disse. The separation of <b>peripheral</b> <b>storage</b> areas from the central organelle-containing cytoplasm is no longer evident at 80 micrograms/l, and the phagocytic activity of invading macrophages is drastically increased. Following exposure to 160 micrograms/l atrazine, additional pathological changes comprise clubshaped deformation of mitochondria, formation of myelinated bodies in the intermembranous space of mitochondria, increase of degranulated ER cisternae and lysosomes, as well as perisinusoidal accumulation of lipid droplets. Deformation of the nuclear envelope, elevated mitotic activity and an increased number of nuclei with two or more nucleoli indicate interactions between atrazine and the nucleus. In the liver of female zebra fish (model 2), atrazine-induced alterations are limited to increased parenchymal variability, disturbance of the intracellular compartmentation, partial RER fractionation and vesiculation, club-shaped deformation of mitochondria and {{an increase in the number}} of lysosomes, myelinated bodies and invading macrophages at 1000 micrograms/l atrazine. After three months at 10, 000 micrograms/l, mortality of zebra fish is increased to 100 %.
