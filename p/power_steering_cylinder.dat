Steering wheel that the spooked hand wheel {{at the top of the}} steering column of an automobile which actuates the steering gear. Such a system is used in heavy commercial vehicle and therefore, application of <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> in car, is the biggest question today is. Because as per norms of <b>power</b> <b>steering,</b> whose vehicle unladen weight is more than 1500 kgs, may affect as the proper norms. However, introducing of <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> in car, in terms of prefect steering is to a problem by means of dragging, while sudden applied of brake. <b>Power</b> <b>steering</b> mechanism employs Electrical Devices, Compressed Air and Hydraulic pressure. There are two types of <b>power</b> <b>steering,</b> i. e. integral and linkage.

Modern <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> has almost universally relied on a hydraulic system, although electrical systems are steadily replacing this technology.

This extra oil flow increases driving torque of the pump, thus the hydraulic <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> system wastes energy. On the other hand, KEEPS can control oil flow electrically {{in accordance with the}} condition of a vehicle. In the measurement test for energy consumption of the <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> system with the actual vehicle on test courses, KEEPS got 48 % less at city mode, 41 % less at highway mode and 39 % less at country mode compared with the conventional hydraulic steering system...|$|R

This paper presents a pos-sible design solution of an electric <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> actuator for hybrid electric vehicles. The design criteria of a tubular linear motor with interior permanent magnet are described and a tubular interior permanent magnet lin-ear motor is designed and optimized with respect to weight and force ripple for Electric <b>Power</b> <b>Steering</b> applica-tion. Such an application requires low motor vibration and low force fluctuations which are considered in design process.

25|$|<b>Power</b> <b>steering</b> is {{a system}} for {{reducing}} the steering effort on vehicles by using an external power source to assist in turning the roadwheels. In 1926, Francis W. Davis of Waltham, Massachusetts invented <b>power</b> <b>steering.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{hydraulic}} <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> (HPS) uses {{hydraulic pressure}} supplied by an engine-driven pump {{to assist the}} motion of turning the <b>steering</b> wheel. Electric <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> (EPS) is more efficient than hydraulic <b>power</b> <b>steering,</b> since the electric <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> motor only needs to provide assistance when the steering wheel is turned, whereas the hydraulic pump must run constantly. In EPS, the amount of assistance is easily tunable to the vehicle type, road speed, and even driver preference. An added benefit is the elimination of environmental hazard posed by leakage and disposal of hydraulic <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> fluid. In addition, electrical assistance is not lost when the engine fails or stalls, whereas hydraulic assistance stops working if the engine stops, making the steering doubly heavy as the driver must now turn not only the very heavy steering—without any help—but also the power-assistance system itself.|$|R

40|$|In {{hydraulic}} <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> {{systems of}} motor vehicles, often unintended acoustic phenomena {{can result from}} certain driving situations. The acoustic phenomenon known as “rattling” is generated by impacts on the <b>steering</b> <b>cylinder,</b> if the car rides over bumps, kerb stones or similar obstacles. In special friction conditions between tyre and road surface during parking, a phenomenon called “shuddering” occurs and leads to strong vibrations. These are audible by the driver as noise, and sensory through shaky steering wheel torque. In this PhD thesis the reasons for rattling and shuddering are analysed. The design of two test benches afford {{easy access to the}} steering systems´ components and allow measurement equipment to be easily installed. Furthermore, the development of simulation models are used to study different hydraulic line designs of the steering system. With the simulation models, physical data can be calculated, which can not be measured at the test benches. A comparison between measured and simulated data then verifies the simulation models. To evaluate measured and simulated data of different hydraulic line designs, characteristic numbers are calculated and compared. Active components, to eliminate both phenomena, are worked out systematically and structured in a matrix of principle solutions. The choice of an intelligent switch element out of the matrix leads to the design of three prototype valves, which are installed in the hydraulic lines of the <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> system and analysed at the two test benches. Characteristic numbers of the three valve lines are calculated and compared to the hydraulic line of the series. With the designed valve lines the rattling and shuddering problem can be solved...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Power</b> <b>steering.</b> Older {{hydraulic}} <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> {{systems are}} <b>powered</b> by a hydraulic pump constantly engaged to the engine. Power assistance required for steering is {{inversely proportional to}} the vehicle speed so the constant load on the engine from a hydraulic pump reduces fuel efficiency. More modern designs improve fuel efficiency by only activating the power assistance when needed; this is done by using either direct electrical <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> assistance or an electrically powered hydraulic pump.|$|R

5000|$|The {{steering}} rack is almost conventional. As {{with a normal}} power-assisted steering setup, there is a rack-and-pinion, and a stepped hydraulic ram with a dividing plate (the piston) in the middle. On {{one side of the}} plate, the piston area is half the area of the other, giving twice the area for the fluid to work on. Thus, with full system pressure on the small area side of the ram, and half system pressure on the large area side, the ram remains perfectly balanced and centred. This is because the lower pressure is working on a larger surface area. The smaller side of the piston is at constant hydraulic pressure, the other side only varies in pressure. NOTE: The author seems to be describing the DS <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> piston and rod, on which the piston {{is in the middle of}} the rod. The SM's <b>steering</b> <b>cylinder</b> has the piston on the end of the rod, which rod's cross-sectional area is half the area of the other side of the piston. Full hydraulic pressure is admitted to the rod side at all times while the pressure on the other side of the piston (its [...] "head") is regulated.|$|R
