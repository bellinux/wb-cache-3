40|$|Abstract. The {{impact of}} {{geography}} on incidence of clinical episodes of malaria {{was investigated in}} a cohort of children enrolled in a longitudinal clinical trial of antimalarial therapy in Kampala, Uganda. Participant households and the boundaries of local swamps and streams were mapped and incidence of clinical malaria episodes was measured prospectively using passive surveillance during one year of follow-up. Of 316 cohort participants, 305 from 219 house-holds were followed {{for at least six}} weeks and were included in the analysis. Incidence of clinical malaria was highly variable, with no episodes occurring in 131 participants, and 367 new episodes of malaria diagnosed in the remaining 174 children. A gradient in incidence of clinical episodes of malaria was observed with distance of residence from a swamp (0. 41 episodes per <b>person</b> <b>year</b> for residence> 100 meters from a swamp increasing to 2. 22 episodes per <b>person</b> <b>year</b> for residence within a swamp), or a stream (0. 61 episodes per <b>person</b> <b>year</b> for residence 500 meters from a stream versus 1. 76 episodes per <b>person</b> <b>year</b> for residence 100 meters from a swamp. In this urban setting, incidence of clinical episodes of malaria was strongly associated with proximity of residence to potential mosquito breeding sites...|$|E

As population progressively ages, {{the economic impact of}} the disease will increase. METHODS: From a total of 1655 consecutive cases, the records of 194 patients were selected and stratified by disease severity. Record selection was based on diagnoses of primary open angle glaucoma, glaucoma suspect, ocular hypertension, or normal tension glaucoma; 5 years minimum follow up were required. Glaucoma severity was assessed using a six stage glaucoma staging system based on static threshold visual field parameters. Resource utilisation data were abstracted from the charts and unit costs were applied to estimate direct costs to the payer. Resource utilisation and estimated direct cost of treatment, per <b>person</b> <b>year,</b> were calculated. RESULTS: A statistically significant increasing linear trend (p = 0. 018) in direct cost as disease severity worsened was demonstrated. The direct cost of treatment increased by an estimated 86 for each incremental step ranging from 455 euro per <b>person</b> <b>year</b> for stage 0 to 969 euro per <b>person</b> <b>year</b> for stage 4 disease.

40|$|Aim To {{examine the}} course of non-infectious uveitis during pregnancy. Methods This is a {{retrospective}} case series. The medical records of 47 subjects with a previous history of non-infectious uveitis pre-dating their pregnancy were reviewed. Uveitis activity during the periods 1  year before pregnancy, during pregnancy and 1  year postpartum, were recorded. Information on patient demographics, type of uveitis, medication use, sex of child and breastfeeding status were also collected. The main outcome measures were the events of flare-ups during the prepregnancy, pregnancy and postpartum periods. Results The rate of flare-up was 1. 188 per <b>person</b> <b>year</b> prior to pregnancy, 0. 540 per <b>person</b> <b>year</b> during pregnancy and 0. 972 per <b>person</b> <b>year</b> in postpartum (p 3 ̆c 0. 001 for comparison between prepregnancy and pregnancy; p= 0. 009 for comparison between pregnancy and postpartum).

40|$|Care home {{residents}} have venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk profiles similar to medical inpatients; however, the epidemiology of VTE in care homes is unclear. To determine {{the incidence of}} VTE in care homes. Observational cohort study of 45 care homes in Birmingham and Oxford, UK. A consecutive sample of care {{home residents}} was enrolled and followed up for 12 months. Data were collected via case note reviews of care home and GP records; mortality information was supplemented with Health and Social Care Information Centre (now called NHS Digital) cause of death data. All potential VTE events were adjudicated by an independent committee according to three measures of diagnostic certainty: definite VTE (radiological evidence), probable VTE (high clinical indication but no radiological evidence), or possible VTE (VTE cannot be ruled out). (Study registration number: ISTCTN 80889792.) RESULTS: There were 1011 participants enrolled, and the mean follow-up period was 312 days (standard deviation 98 days). The incidence rate was 0. 71 per 100 <b>person</b> <b>years</b> of observation (95 % confidence interval [CI] = 0. 26 to 1. 54) for definite VTE, 0. 83 per 100 <b>person</b> <b>years</b> (95 % CI = 0. 33 to 1. 70) for definite and probable VTE, and 2. 48 per 100 <b>person</b> <b>years</b> (95 % CI = 1. 53 to 3. 79) for definite, probable, and possible VTE. The incidence of VTE in care homes in this study (0. 71 - 2. 48 per 100 <b>person</b> <b>years)</b> is substantial compared with that in the community (0. 117 per 100 <b>person</b> <b>years)</b> and in people aged ≥ 70 years (0. 44 per 100 <b>person</b> <b>years).</b> Further research regarding risk stratification and VTE prophylaxis in this population is needed...|$|R

40|$|Older {{people in}} {{residential}} care fall {{about three times}} as frequently as those living in the community. In part, this reflects higher incidences of risk factors for falls such as mobility limitations and dementia. Also, falls are an independent risk factor for admission to a nursing home. Falls in hospital settings are higher still: results from a Swedish study amounted to 6. 2 falls per <b>person</b> <b>year</b> in a psychogeriatric ward, 3. 4 falls per <b>person</b> <b>year</b> in a geriatric rehabilitation ward, and 1. 1 falls per <b>person</b> <b>year</b> in a nursing home. Falls in nursing care facilities and hospitals often result in serious injuries and are associated with considerable mortality and morbidity. For example, rates of hip fracture {{as a result of}} falls in nursing care facilities have been estimated to be 10. 5 times higher than in the community. Outcome too is poorer, as older people who fall while in hospital settings have significantly longer lengths of stay {{and are more likely to}} be discharged to a nursing home. Falls in these settings are thus a major public health issue and a wide range of interventions for preventing falls, often aimed at moderating risk factors, have been proposed and implemented. This points to the importance of the recent publication in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews of a comprehensive systematic review that examines the effects of interventions for preventing falls in older people living in nursing care facilities and hospitals...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} {{effectiveness}} of adenoidectomy in children with recurrent upper respiratory tract infections. DESIGN: Open randomised controlled trial. SETTING: 11 general hospitals and two academic centres. PARTICIPANTS: 111 children aged 1 - 6 with recurrent upper respiratory tract infections selected for adenoidectomy. INTERVENTION: A strategy of immediate adenoidectomy with or without myringotomy or a strategy of initial watchful waiting. Main outcome measure Primary outcome measure: number of upper respiratory tract infections per <b>person</b> <b>year</b> calculated from data obtained during the total follow-up (maximum 24 months). Secondary outcome measures: days with upper respiratory tract infection per <b>person</b> <b>year,</b> middle ear complaints with fever in episodes and days, days with fever, prevalence of upper respiratory tract infections, and health related quality of life. RESULTS: During the median follow-up of 24 months, there were 7. 91 episodes of upper respiratory tract infections per <b>person</b> <b>year</b> in the adenoidectomy group and 7. 84 in the watchful waiting group (difference in incidence rate 0. 07, 95 % confidence interval - 0. 70 to 0. 85). No relevant differences were found for days of upper respiratory tract infections and middle ear complaints with fever in episodes and days, nor for health related quality of life. The prevalence of upper respiratory tract infections decreased over time in both groups. Children in the adenoidectomy group had significantly more days with fever than {{the children in the}} watchful waiting group. Two children had complications related to surgery.

Methods:Data from the Nord-Trøndelag Health Study (1984 – 2008) linked to the Norwegian Cancer and Death Cause Registry were analyzed stratified by smoking status. In total, 97, 087 persons (1, 634, 967 <b>person</b> <b>years)</b> were included (never smokers 567, 575 <b>person</b> <b>years,</b> former smokers 295, 685 <b>person</b> <b>years,</b> current smokers 444, 922 <b>person</b> <b>years,</b> and unknown 326, 785 <b>person</b> <b>years)</b> and followed {{for an average of}} 15 years. The proportional hazard model was applied to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) with a 95 % confidence interval (CI) for self-reported CVD on lung cancer incidence rate adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, burden of tobacco smoking and chronic cough with phlegm. Results: 1080 cases of lung cancer (1. 1 %) occurred. A total of 5981 (6. 9 %) participants had at baseline or developed during follow-up self-reported CVD. After adjusting for confounders, self-reported CVD was an independent risk factor for the development of lung cancer in former (HR [95 % CI] 1. 74 [1. 11 – 2. 73]) and current smokers (HR [95 % CI] 1. 38 [1. 04 – 1. 83]), but not in never smokers (HR [95 % CI] 0. 87 [0. 34 – 2. 23]).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Barrett's {{oesophagus}} (BO) predisposes to oesophageal adenocarcinoma. Epidemiological {{data suggest}} that the incidence of BO is rising but it is unclear whether this reflects a true rise in incidence of BO or an increase in detection secondary to more upper gastrointestinal endoscopies performed. This study aimed to examine the changes in BO incidence relative to the number of upper gastrointestinal endoscopies performed in the general population. METHODS: We conducted a cohort study using the Integrated Primary Care Information database. This general practice research database contains the complete and longitudinal electronic medical records of more than 500, 000 persons. RESULTS: In total, 260 incident cases of BO were identified during the study period. The incidence of BO increased from 14. 3 / 100, 000 <b>person</b> <b>years</b> in 1997 (95 % confidence interval (CI) 8. 6 - 22. 4) to 23. 1 / 100, 000 <b>person</b> <b>years</b> (95 % CI 17. 2 - 30. 6) in 2002 (r 2 = 0. 87). The number of upper gastrointestinal endoscopies decreased from 7. 2 / 1000 <b>person</b> <b>years</b> (95 % CI 6. 7 - 7. 7) to 5. 7 / 1000 <b>person</b> <b>years</b> (95 % CI 5. 4 - 6. 1) over the same time period. This resulted in an overall increase in detected BO per 1000 endoscopies from 19. 8 (95 % CI 12. 0 - 31. 0) in 1997 to 40. 5 (95 % CI 30. 0 - 53. 5) in 2002 (r 2 = 0. 93). The incidence of adenocarcinoma increased from 1. 7 / 100, 000 <b>person</b> <b>years</b> (95 % CI 0. 3 - 5. 4) in 1997 to 6. 0 / 100, 000 <b>person</b> <b>years</b> (95 % CI 3. 3 - 10. 2) in 2002 (r 2 = 0. 87). CONCLUSION: The incidence of diagnosed BO is increasing, independent of the number of upper gastrointestinal endoscopies that are being performed. This increase in BO incidence will likely result in a further increase in the incidence of oesophageal adenocarcinomas in the near future...|$|R

Methods A health screening program for all retired cadres aged 55 years or older in 22 retired cadre homes of PLA in Xi’an in March 1987 and a cohort analytic study in 1 ? 268 males of them were carried out. The baseline data of smoking,cholesterol,triglyceride,blood pressure,histories of {{hypertension and}} coronary heart disease,stroke and diabetes were investigated. Main outcome measures were cardiovascular,cerebrovascular and all cause mortalities. Results The cohort was followed up until 20 November 1999 and the mean follow up time was 11. 17 years. The total <b>person</b> <b>year</b> of follow up was 14 ? 163. The adjusted mortality (per 100 ? 000 <b>person</b> <b>year)</b> was 2 ? 146 for all cause (304 deaths), 367 for coronary heart disease (CHD) (52 deaths) and 268 for stroke (38 deaths). Using Cox’s proportional hazards survival analysis,after adjusting for age,total cholesterol,triglyceride,smoking,drinking and physical exercise,we found that the systolic blood pressure {{and the history of}} hypertension were the independent risk factors influencing all cause,CHD and stroke mortalities. Conclusions The prevalence of hypertension and the all cause and stroke mortalities in this cohort were lower than those in the same age groups of the general population.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This {{research}} was conducted to study incidence, distribution, type, causes, severity and circumstances of injuries among people living in squatter settlements in Karachi, Pakistan. METHODS: Trained interviewers sought a 2 weeks recall for minor injuries for which no health care was sought, 2 months recall for major injuries for which a health provider was consulted and 1 year recall for hospitalization, disability and death from every third household in five squatter settlements in Karachi between May and August 1995. For understanding the injury circumstances 250 in-depth interviews of the injured or the close relatives were also conducted. RESULTS: Among 1182 households, having 9891 residents, 84 minor, 42 major injury episodes, 7 hospitalizations, 0. 6 permanent disabilities and 0. 3 deaths per 1000 <b>person</b> <b>years</b> were reported. Including all injury episodes, the common types of injury were cutting or piercing (n = 532), falls (n = 382) and burns (n = 235) estimating to 54, 38 and 23 injury episodes per 1000 <b>person</b> <b>years.</b> Injury mainly resulted from a piece of glass (n = 367), falling from height (n = 98) and knife (n = 97) estimating to 37, 10 and 10 injury episodes per 1000 <b>person</b> <b>years,</b> respectively. Fall (n = 32, 3. 2 / 1000 <b>person</b> <b>years)</b> was the major reason for hospitalizations and all permanent disabilities resulted from closed injuries. Medically trained providers were mostly contacted (n = 339, 34 / 1000 <b>person</b> <b>years),</b> but traditional healers were preferred in bone injury.

Methods Based on the Guangzhou Occupational Health Surveillance Record System established in 1989 ～ 1992, 165 660 factory workers and drivers(aged≥ 30) were included. Baseline information was retrieved from individual health records onto computer by Intelligent Character Recognition technology. Vital status and causes of death were followed up until 31 December 1998. RR (95 % CI) were calculated and survival curves for occupational exposure and smoking were developed with Cox proportional hazards models by SPSS 10. 0. Results There were 165 660 subjects(129 155 men, 36 505 women) in the study with mean age of (42. 0 ± 6. 3) years,and 87 % of them were 30 ～ 49. Of them, 37. 3 % had been exposed to occupational hazards. In men, 70. 8 % of factory workers and 54. 8 % of drivers were smokers,but only less than 2. 0 % of the women had ever smoked in. The mean follow up time was (7. 6 ± 1. 1) years with 1 252 168 person years in total 2 437 subjects died during the time, 51 (2. 1 %) of whom had unknown cause of death.

40|$|ObjectivesTo {{investigate}} {{the use of}} asthma medication and occurrence of asthma exacerbations up to 5 years {{before and after the}} onset of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T 1 DM) in children and adolescents. MethodsChildren and adolescents younger than 19 years with at least 2 insulin prescriptions between 1999 and 2009 classified as T 1 DM cohort (n= 915) and a 4 times larger reference cohort (n= 3, 590) with the same age and gender were identified from the Dutch PHARMO Record Linkage System. The date of first insulin dispensing was selected as the index date. ResultsThe 5 -year prevalence rate of asthma medication use in the T 1 DM cohort (23. 2 %) was significantly higher than the reference cohort (18. 3 %) after the onset of diabetes. No statistically significant difference between the two cohorts was observed in the use of specific types of asthma medication except for short acting muscarinic antagonists that were significantly more used in the T 1 DM cohort (5. 5 %) compared with the reference cohort (0. 62 %) after the onset of diabetes. The incidence rate of asthma medication use declined over time with a peak in the T 1 DM cohort the 1 st year after the onset of diabetes. Furthermore, 1 year after the index date there was a peak in incidence rate of asthma exacerbations in both T 1 DM (7. 8 per 1, 000 <b>person</b> <b>year)</b> and reference (6. 8 per 1, 000 <b>person</b> <b>year)</b> cohorts. ConclusionsT 1 DM is associated with statistically significantly higher asthma medication use after the onset of T 1 DM, especially in the 1 st year after the onset of diabetes.

40|$|Abstract: Artisanal and {{small-scale}} gold mining (ASGM) {{is inherently}} risky, but {{little is known}} about mining-associated hazards and injuries despite the tremendous growth worldwide of ASGM and the benefits it offers. The current study aimed to characterize the physical injuries associated with ASGM in Ghana to guide policy formulation. A cross-sectional survey was carried out in the Tarkwa mining district of the Western Region of Ghana in 2014. A total of 404 small-scale miners were recruited and interviewed regarding their occupational injury experiences over the preceding 10 years using a paper-based structured questionnaire. Nearly one-quarter (23. 5 %) of the miners interviewed reported getting injured over the previous 10 years, and the overall injury rate was calculated to be 5. 39 per 100 <b>person</b> <b>years.</b> The rate was significantly higher for women (11. 93 per 100 <b>person</b> <b>years)</b> and those with little mining experience (e. g., 25. 31 per 100 <b>person</b> <b>years</b> for those with less than one year of work experience).

40|$|We {{determined}} the prevalence and incidence of HBV and HCV infection {{in people who}} inject drugs (PWIDs) {{at high risk for}} HIV in China and Thailand and {{determined the}} association of HBV and HCV incidence with urine opiate test results and with short-term versus long-term buprenorphine-naloxone (B-N) treatment use in a randomized clinical trial (HPTN 058). 13. 8 % of 1049 PWIDs in China and 13. 9 % of 201 PWIDs in Thailand were HBsAg positive at baseline. Among HBsAg negative participants, the HBsAg incidence rate was 2. 7 / 100 <b>person</b> <b>years</b> in China and 0 / 100 <b>person</b> <b>years</b> in Thailand. 81. 9 % of 1049 PWIDs in China and 59. 7 % of 201 in Thailand were HCV antibody positive at baseline. The HCV confirmed seroincidence rate among HCV antibody negative PWIDs was 22 / 100 <b>person</b> <b>years</b> in China and 4. 6 / 100 <b>person</b> <b>years</b> in Thailand. Incident HBsAg was not significantly different in the short-term versus long-term B-N arm in China or Thailand. Participants with positive opiate results in at least 75 % of their urines during the time period were at increased risk of incident HBsAg (HR = 5. 22; 95 % CI, 1. 08 to 25. 22; P= 0. 04) in China, but not incident HCV conversion in China or Thailand...|$|R
30|$|Response to {{treatment}} or quiescence {{was defined as}} the reduction in anterior chamber (AC) inflammation to nil, with no episodes of flare-up of uveitis, which was defined as an increase in AC activity by one step. The primary outcome measures were time-to-quiescence, time-to-recurrence, and number of uveitis flare-ups per <b>person</b> <b>year.</b> Time-to-quiescence {{was defined as the}} duration from the presentation/recurrence of hypertensive uveitis to the time when zero cells were noted in the AC, as defined by the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) Working Group [13]. Time-to-recurrence was defined as the duration between the start of one episode of hypertensive uveitis to the next episode. Crude incidence rates and recurrence rates were calculated, and comparisons were made for the disease course of each eye before and after the use of topical ganciclovir.|$|E

40|$|Background: Most {{studies of}} chronic disease in Aboriginal people have {{described}} prevalence on cross-sectional surveys. We estimated incidence rates through a longitudinal study, (mean 10. 4 years follow up), in one high risk Northern Territory Aboriginal community. Methods: Community-wide surveys, each with > 80 % participation, were conducted from 1992 – 1996 and 2004 – 2006, and defined rates of albuminuria (ACR > 3. 4 g/mol), hypertension (BP > 140 / 90) and diabetes (history, medicines or defining glycemia). Results: In the first survey of 962 adults (18 + years, median 32. 6 years), 45. 7 % had albuminuria, 23. 5 % had hypertension and 13. 5 % had diabetes, while 39. 3 % {{had none of}} these conditions. In the second survey (n = 1153 adults, median age 34. 2 years) these rates were 44. 8 %, 17. 4 % and 19. 5 %. Among 250 adults with no abnormality on the first screen {{who participated in the}} second screen, 54. 7 % had developed one or more problems: 45. 1 % had developed albuminuria, 16. 2 % had developed hypertension and 15. 6 % had developed diabetes. These minimum incidence rates of 4. 3, 1. 6 and 1. 5 per <b>person</b> <b>year</b> translate to rates of 8. 6, 3. 2 and 3. 2 per <b>person</b> <b>year</b> if the conditions appeared halfway through the follow-up period. The proportion of previously unaffected people who had developed any one of these conditions by the second screen was 54. 7 %, with an estimated incidence of 11 % per year if those conditions appeared mid-way through the follow-up period. Discussion: Incidence rates of new disease are striking in this youthful Aboriginal population. Recent improvements in mortality and renal failure are clearly due to better surveillance and treatment, rather than fundamental diminution of risk. This information shows that those efforts cannot be relaxed. Specific targets for primary prevention remain obscure while the nature of accentuated susceptibility is not understood...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background: Studies into {{risk factors}} and causes of {{childhood}} mortality present the opportunity to identify intervention programs appropriate in different populations in our attempt to reach the WHO Millennium Development Goals. Objectives: To determine {{whether there is an}} association between parental labour migration and child mortality in the Agincourt Health and Demographic Surveillance Site (HDSS) in 2002. Methods: Secondary data extracted from the longitudinal database from the Agincourt Health and Demographic Surveillance System were used to study the association between father’s migration and child mortality in 2002 using logistic regression and survival analysis. The analysis included 10050 children born between 01 January 1998 and 31 December 2002.

40|$|Background: Human {{papillomavirus}} (HPV) is a causative {{agent in}} oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. The {{natural history of}} oral HPV in HIV-positive {{men who have sex}} with men (MSM) is unclear. Methods: Detection of oral human papillomavirus in 173 HIV-positive MSM using oral rinse samples 3 years apart was investigated. HPV DNA was detected by polymerase chain reaction, and genotyped by Roche Linear Array. Results: Of 173 men tested in 2010, 30 had at least one HPV genotype (17 %, 95 % CI: 12 - 23), 15 at least one hr-HPV (9 %, 95 % CI: 5 - 14) and 8 had HPV 16 (5 %, 95 % CI: 2 - 9) detected. In 2013, 33 had at least one HPV genotype (19 %, 95 % CI: 14 - 26), 20 had at least one hr-HPV (12 %, 95 % CI: 7 - 17) and 7 had HPV 16 (4 %, 95 % CI: 2 - 8) detected. Of 30 men at baseline (2010) with any HPV detected, 14 (47 %, 95 % CI: 28 - 66) had at least one persistent genotype. Of the 15 men in 2010 with high risk (hr-) HPV, 6 men (40 %, 95 % CI: 16 - 68) had at least one persistent hr-HPV genotype. The incidence rate of detection of at least one new HPV genotype was 4. 8 per 100 <b>person</b> <b>years</b> (95 % CI: 3. 1 - 7. 0), of at least one hr-HPV genotype was 3. 2 per 100 <b>person</b> <b>years</b> (95 % CI: 1. 8 - 5. 1) and of HPV 16 was 0. 8 per 100 <b>person</b> <b>years</b> (95 % CI: 0. 2 - 2. 0). The clearance rate was 14. 9 per 100 <b>person</b> <b>years</b> (95 % CI: 8. 2 - 24. 2) for any HPV, 18. 2 per 100 <b>person</b> <b>years</b> (95 % CI: 8. 2 - 32. 7) for hr-HPV and 17. 4 per 100 <b>person</b> <b>years</b> (95 % CI: 5. 0 - 38. 8) for HPV- 16. Persistent HPV detection was associated with duration of HIV (OR 1. 13 (per additional year), 95 % CI: 1. 00 - 1. 26) and tonsillectomy (OR 8. 17, 95 % CI: 1. 30 - 51. 40).
