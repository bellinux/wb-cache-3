The paper shows that substitution of traditionally applied precision rolling guides by a <b>pendulum</b> <b>suspension</b> of the ultrasonic converter allows significantly to simplify a process equipment design. A calculative model for contact interaction of an end face of the ultrasonic converter installed on a <b>pendulum</b> <b>suspension</b>  with a rigid basis and scheme of a mathematical  pendulum  that  corresponds are proposed in the paper and they permit to investigate an influence of <b>pendulum</b> <b>suspension</b> parameters and its loading conditions on the operational mode of an acoustic oscillatory system. The paper contains analytical dependences that make it possible to calculate time and power parameters in contact interaction of a target end face of the ultrasonic converter installed on a <b>pendulum</b> <b>suspension</b> with a rigid basis. These dependences take into account an amplitude of ultrasonic oscillations, converter weight, pendulum length and an angle of its deviation.

The seismic vibration is a particular problem at low frequency, because the mirror is suspended with pendulum with a resonant frequency around 1 Hz. The Japanese interferometric gravitational wave detector, TAMA 300, will have a vibrational attenuation system consisting of three stages: a stack, the two-dimensional X-pendulum attenuator presented here, and a double <b>pendulum</b> <b>suspension</b> system. The stack and the double <b>pendulum</b> <b>suspension</b> are only effective at relatively high frequencies, so the X-pendulum system will be used to improve [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The {{thermal noise}} is {{expected}} {{to be one of the}} main limiting factors on the sensitivity of interferometric gravitational-wave detectors like LIGO and VIRGO. Thermal fluctuations of internal modes of the interferometer's test masses and of suspension modes will dominate the noise spectrum at the important frequency range between 50 and 200 Hz. It is assumed that losses in the test masses and suspensions will occur mainly due to internal friction in their materials, which is related to anelasticity effects in solids. The present notes comprise some basic results on the theory of anelasticity and thermal noise in <b>pendulum</b> <b>suspensions.</b> This collection is by no means complete and focus on aspects which are of interest for the author.

The prototype interferometer will be housed inside a 100 m 3 ultra-high vacuum envelope. Seismically isolated optical tables inside the vacuum system will be interferometrically interconnected via a suspension platform interferometer. Advanced isolation techniques will be used, such as inverted pendulums and geometrical anti-spring filters in combination with multiple-cascaded <b>pendulum</b> <b>suspensions,</b> containing an all-silica monolithic last stage. The light source is a 35 W Nd:YAG laser, geometrically filtered by passing it through a photonic crystal fibre and a rigid pre-modecleaner cavity. Laser frequency stabilisation will be achieved {{with the aid of}} a high finesse suspended reference cavity in conjunction with a molecular iodine reference. Coating thermal noise will be reduced by the use of Khalili cavities as compound end mirrors. Data acquisition and control of the experiments is based on the AdvLIGO digital control and data system.
