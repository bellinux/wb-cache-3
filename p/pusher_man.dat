It appeared in numerous Marvel titles over the years previously and appeared in a two-part Young Avengers story in Autumn 2005. The following month, the Runaways were asked to fight the <b>Pusher</b> <b>Man,</b> an MGH dealer.|$|E
50|$|Gert and Nico {{had been}} close friends since birth. After Gert's death, Nico tells Victor (while crying) that Gert {{had sent her}} My Little Pony dolls in the forest because Gert thought they should be free, and Nico had knit a purple scarf for Gert's thirteenth birthday, {{prompting}} Gert to dye her hair that color. Nico also told Gert that should Nico get hurt, Gert would be leader. The pair's friendship briefly breaks after Gert discovered Nico's kiss with Chase after their encounter with the <b>Pusher</b> <b>Man.</b> Their falling out caused much friction in the group. Nico and Gert finally resolved their differences with a short bout of tossing insults. Despite Gert's cynical attitude, she rarely argued with Nico's decisions and was usually prepared to stand by her friend. Nico experiences survivor's guilt after Gert dies, knowing that Gert's murderer Geoffrey Wilder had initially meant to kill Nico.|$|E

50|$|Four <b>pushing</b> <b>men</b> ("spingitori") and a pilot {{take part}} in the races.The <b>pushing</b> <b>men</b> swap running and pushing the car, like in a relay race, where the baton is the car. The {{competition}} rules allow only one person to push the car at a time. On the downhill part of the track ("la bassa"), where the car increase its speed, the pusher jump in the car behind the driver and then resumes pushing when the car speed reduces.|$|R
5000|$|Nico {{provides}} the motherly and leadership foil for Chase's rule-breaking persona. The pair maintain a strong {{respect for each}} other despite often disagreeing over major group decisions, including Gert's burial site and allowing Victor Mancha to join the team. Chase cares for Nico's safety and well-being, as evidenced from when he comforted Nico after Karolina's departure and later when he took the Staff of One from Nico to destroy it (along with himself) and give her a normal life. Nico and Chase shared a kiss after Chase bluffed their way out of a potentially fatal encounter with inter-dimensional drug lord <b>Pusher</b> <b>Man</b> and managed to get a customer's name from the drug lord. Chase rejected the kiss but did not make a huge deal of it, even though Nico treated him more as an employee instead of a friend after the incident. After Gert's death, Chase and Nico's friendship strained as he allowed anger and grief to isolate him (both physically and emotionally) from the group's support. Nico was also the only person that Chase bid farewell before leaving to sacrifice himself for the Gibborim, which Nico interpreted as a cry for help, and is presumably a signal of the level of trust and respect Chase holds for Nico. In Joss Whedon's stint on Runaways, Chase and Nico's friendship appears more stable now that Chase seems to have moved past grieving for Gert. Their relationship became strained when Chase acted out frequently during Terry Moore's run on the series. However, their relationship stabilized and during Kathryn Immonen's run they were close once again. Especially, following the [...] "death" [...] of Old Lace, the two rekindled their relationship and shared an implied romantic moment to help then relieve their tension. Both were later kidnapped by Arcade and participated in the Avenger's Arena. During the events of the arena, Nico was angry at Chase for acting differently or untrustworthy, even kicking him out of the group at one point. Despite this, Chase planned on protecting Nico and making sure she, and not himself, was going to survive Murder World. After the events of the Arena, Nico became reclusive while Chase became the sole guardian of the Runaways. Nico was angry that Chase had reverted to his old self after Murder World, while she thought of herself as broken. She was devastated when Chase was left comatose after a battle.|$|E

2500|$|Joseph Luster of Otaku USA {{said that}} Tatsumi's art style and {{character}} designs reinforce {{the stories and}} that they linger in the reader's mind long after being read. Carlo Santos of Anime News Network found [...] "greater depth and variety" [...] than in The <b>Push</b> <b>Man</b> and Other Stories due to the larger amount of pages available, complimenting their simple layouts and executions, but disliked the endings {{as well as the}} repetitive character designs. Greg McElhatton of Read About Comics praised Tatsumi's characterization and found the stories to be memorable, but found fault in the same look of the characters. In a starred review, Publishers Weekly called the stories [...] "a bit more ambitious and sure-footed" [...] than those in The <b>Push</b> <b>Man</b> and Other Stories. Daryl Surat of the Anime World Order podcast felt that the longer stories in the manga allowed for more development than Tatsumi's earlier stories. Ng Suat Tong of The Hooded Utilitarian was critical of Tatsumi—feeling that the stories marked his transition into a rigorous artist, but disliking his repetitive themes and characters, concluding: [...] "These tales are neither close enough, true enough, sad enough nor vile enough to shock us from our modern stupor". In , Jason Thompson did not find the collection as powerful as The <b>Push</b> <b>Man</b> and Other Stories, but remarked that [...] "Tatsumi is a great storyteller and his pessimism is profound." [...] Dan Polley of Manga Life noted a departure by Tatsumi from his previous stories in The <b>Push</b> <b>Man</b> and Other Stories and called the stories [...] "Abandon the Old in Tokyo" [...] and [...] "Beloved Monkey" [...] the [...] "shining stars of the volume", concluding that his stories are timeless and have substance. Richard Rayner of the Los Angeles Times described the manga as [...] "remarkable, amazing", adding that [...] "the style is spare, elliptical and it's sometimes necessary to read two or three times to appreciate the full nightmarish power". Austin Ramzy of Time Magazine noted that the manga remains relevant, calling it [...] "a revealing time capsule and a strangely moving portrait of survival in a land where everything is changing". Kirkus Reviews felt that the strong illustrations made the manga relatable and that it did not feel dated. Gordon Flagg of Booklist said that Tatsumi's [...] "powerful drawing style depicts the characters with a starkness and simplicity that matches what is presented of their lives and conjures a convincing urban milieu through detailed backdrops".|$|R
