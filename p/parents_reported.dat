25|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 5 January 1937, 10-year-old Mona Tinsley disappeared after leaving her school in Newark-on-Trent. Her distraught <b>parents</b> <b>reported</b> her missing to the police that same evening. The police immediately launched an intense manhunt for the child. This search involved canals and rivers being dragged, and empty properties being searched. The police search was assisted by hundreds of local volunteers.|$|E
25|$|When the {{two girls}} had not {{returned}} home by 23:00, the <b>parents</b> <b>reported</b> them missing, and a major search operation was launched. Immediately, police together with canine units began searching the area. By the next morning, over 50 volunteers from the Norwegian Red Cross were participating in the search. This number soon swelled to the hundreds, as Sea King and special police helicopters were called in along with rescue divers and civilian divers who trawled the lakes and ponds in the area. Volunteer mountaineers also climbed the steep cliffs bordering Baneheia, while the fire department surveyed the shorelines. On Saturday night 16 electronic listening posts were set up around the terrain, which could detect extremely low volume noise during the night. This was done in case the girls were lying injured somewhere in the hills, in which case even the most faint crying or sulking would have been easily detected.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} how child and <b>parent</b> <b>reports</b> of <b>parenting</b> {{were related to}} early adolescent substance use and school suspensions. Data were from two time points six months apart on 321 families with an eighth grade student attending one of five schools in the Pacific Northwest. Child- and parent-report measures of family management practices were moderately correlated (r =. 29). Child <b>report,</b> but not <b>parent</b> <b>report,</b> of more positive family management practices uniquely predicted a lower likelihood of adolescent substance use. Also, discrepancies between child and <b>parent</b> <b>report</b> of <b>parenting</b> predicted substance use, with child positive report of family management losing its protective association with adolescent substance use when <b>parents</b> had negative <b>reports</b> of their <b>parenting.</b> <b>Parent</b> <b>report,</b> but not child <b>report,</b> of better <b>parenting</b> predicted lower likelihood of suspensions, suggesting that the salience of child and <b>parent</b> <b>report</b> may depend {{on the type of}} behavioral outcome...|$|R
40|$|Objective To {{develop and}} {{evaluate}} adjustment factors to convert parent-reported time in bed to {{an estimate of}} child sleep time consistent with objective measurement. Methods A community sample of 217 children aged 4 – 9 years (mean age = 6. 6 years) wore actigraph wristwatches to objectively measure sleep for 7 days while <b>parents</b> completed <b>reports</b> of child sleep each night. After examining the moderators of the discrepancy between <b>parent</b> <b>reports</b> and actigraphy, 3 adjustment factors were evaluated. Results <b>Parent</b> <b>report</b> of child sleep overestimated nightly sleep duration by ~ 24 min per night relative to actigraphy. Child age, gender, and sleep quality all had small or nonsignificant associations with correspondence between <b>parent</b> <b>report</b> and actigraph. Empirically derived adjustment factors significantly reduced the discrepancy between <b>parent</b> <b>report</b> and objective measurement.

500|$|The {{researchers}} found that 73% of 4- and 5-year-olds in their study understood that Mr. Hooper was dead and that 88% of this group understood {{that he was not}} coming back, although only about one-fourth of the 3-year-old viewers responded correctly. [...] Most of the 4- and 5-year-olds understood that Big Bird and the adults were sad. [...] Most children (80%) were attentive during the episode. [...] The parents interviewed had [...] "overwhelmingly positive" [...] reactions to the show, and that half reported that they had discussed death with their children after viewing it.

500|$|Iftah Ya Simsim {{inspired}} [...] "a {{flood of}} studies", from scientific research to doctoral or masters theses submitted to Arab, European, and American universities. No studies were {{conducted during the}} show's first five years, largely {{due to lack of}} government cooperation and unsuccessful attempts marred by subjects dropping out of the studies. In 1981, however, the JPPI invited children from Arab countries to Kuwait to access how they assimilated the program. Their attitudes about the show were assessed by education, social, and media specialists, who found that most viewers had benefited from watching it. <b>Parents</b> <b>reported</b> that their children's language use and ability improved, and the JPPI received many letters of appreciation and was commended for their efforts in producing the show. In 1984, in one of the first studies conducted researching the show's effects on its young viewers, Ibrahim Al-Khulaifi compared the relationship between the viewing behavior by the Kuwaiti preschooler of Iftah Ya Simsim and certain developmental and environmental variables. He found that variables such as socioeconomic status, parental education (especially that of the mother), sex, age, year in school, birth order, and family attitudes about the show influenced the frequency of viewing.|$|E
2500|$|A study {{conducted}} in 2011 {{led to the}} conclusion that environmental enrichment vastly improves the cognitive ability of children with autism. The study found that autistic children who receive olfactory and tactile stimulation along with exercises that stimulated other paried sensory modalities clinically improved by 42 percent while autistic children not receiving this treatment clinically improved by just 7 percent. The same study also showed that there was significant clinical improvement in autistic children exposed to enriched sensorimotor environments, and a vast majority of <b>parents</b> <b>reported</b> that their child's quality of life was much better with the treatment. [...] A second study confirmed its effectiveness. [...] The second study also found after 6 months of sensory enrichment therapy, 21% of the children who initially had been given an autism classification, using the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, improved to the point that, although they remained on the autism spectrum, they no longer met the criteria for classic autism. None of the standard care controls reached an equivalent level of improvement. The therapy using the methodologies is titled Sensory Enrichment Therapy.|$|E
50|$|During the {{development}} of the CMRS, researchers found that reliable and more accurate diagnostic accuracy is found in <b>parent</b> <b>reports</b> in comparison to teacher reports or self-reports and that these other reports rarely added new information to the <b>parent</b> <b>report.</b> Furthermore, the areas under the curve (AUC) of parent-rated instruments reported modest to excellent validity.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Objective: The goal of {{the study}} was to compare the {{accuracy}} and diagnostic power of a <b>parent</b> <b>report</b> measure and direct language assessment for early identification of children with language delay. Meth-od: The <b>parent</b> language <b>report</b> and direct language measures were compared for 47 typically developing toddlers and 70 late-talking toddlers aged 24 to 26 months. One year later, language abilities of 102 of the 117 children were reassessed. Results: The concurrent validity of the <b>parent</b> <b>report</b> was high both for judging language skills and for identifying language delay. No evidence was found of differences in the rating accuracy of mothers with different educational levels. Language abilities 1 year later were predicted better with direct language measurement than with the <b>parent</b> <b>report.</b> However, there were no differences between the accuracy of the <b>parent</b> <b>report</b> and individual language assessment concerning the prediction of language delay at age 3. Conclusion: The results suggest that the <b>parent</b> language <b>report</b> is a valid and efficient tool for assessing productive language abilities and judging expressive language delay in 2 -year-old toddlers. The measurement characteristics of the <b>parent</b> <b>report</b> are comparable with those of direct language measures.

6000|$|It {{seems that}} a {{personal}} tax had been levied by the government, {{the amount of}} which varied with {{the age of the}} individual assessed. Children paid so much. Young men and young women paid more. The line between these classes was not clearly defined, or, rather, the tax-gatherers had no means of determining the ages of the young people in a family, if they suspected the <b>parents</b> <b>reported</b> them wrong. In such cases they were often very insolent and rude, and a great many quarrels took place, by which the people were often very much incensed. The tax-gatherer came one day into Walter's house to collect the tax. Walter himself was away, engaged at work tiling a house nearby. The only persons that were at home were his wife and a young daughter just growing to womanhood. The tax-gatherer said that the girl was full-grown, and that they must pay the higher tax for her. Her mother said, [...] "No, she is not full-grown yet; she is only a child." [...] The tax-gatherer then said he would soon find out whether she was a woman or not, and went to her to take hold of her, offering her rudeness and violence of the worst possible character. The poor girl screamed and struggled to get away from him. Her mother ran to the door, and made a great outcry, calling for help. Walter, hearing the cries, seized for a club a heavy implement which he used in tiling, and ran home. As soon as he entered the house, he demanded of the officer, who had now left his daughter and came forward to meet him, what he meant by conducting in so outrageous a manner in his house. The officer replied defiantly, and advanced toward Walter to strike him. Walter parried the stroke, and then, being roused to perfect phrensy by the insult which his daughter had received and the insolence of the tax-gatherer, he brought his club down upon the tax-gatherer's head with such a blow as to break his skull and kill him on the spot. The blow was so violent that the man's brains were scattered all about the floor.|$|E

40|$|Parental harsh disciplining, like {{corporal}} punishment, {{has consistently}} {{been associated with}} adverse mental health outcomes in children. It remains a challenge to accurately assess the consequences of harsh discipline, as researchers and clinicians generally rely on <b>parent</b> <b>report</b> of young children’s problem behaviors. If parents rate their parenting styles and their child’s behavior this may bias results. The use of child self-report on problem behaviors is not common but may provide extra information about the relation of harsh parental discipline and problem behavior.

The present study examines the ability of <b>parent</b> <b>reports</b> and parent-administered tasks obtained through the post to assess non-verbal cognitive abilities in early childhood. In a sample of 107 2 -year-olds, age-corrected scores on <b>parent</b> <b>reports</b> and parent-administered tasks assessing non-verbal reasoning significantly predicted performance on the Mental Development Index (MDI) of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development-II two weeks later (r =. 49 and r =. 41, p <. 0001, respectively). The multiple correlation between the two components and the MDI was. 55 (p <. 0001). This ability of parental assessments to predict the MDI is comparable to the predictive power of standard tester-administered measures at this age, even though the parent measure specifically excludes verbal items that are included in the MDI. Adding <b>parent</b> <b>reports</b> of language development significantly improved the prediction of the MDI (R =. 66, p <. 0001).

40|$|BACKGROUND : Disease-specific {{health-related}} {{quality of}} life (HRQOL) questionnaires provide the clinician with important information regarding {{the impact of the}} disease on functioning and well-being. For patients with velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI), the VPI Effects on Life Outcomes (VELO) questionnaire was developed and validated in English by Skirko et al. (2012). However, a valid and reliable Dutch translation of this questionnaire is not available yet. METHODS : The English questionnaire was translated to Dutch following a forward-backward translation procedure. A linguistic validation and the evaluation of the internal consistency (Cronbach's α) of this Dutch version were performed based on the responses of 39 parents of patients with cleft (lip and) palate (mean age: 6. 8 years) (<b>parent</b> <b>report)</b> and the responses of 14 patients older than 8 years (mean age: 9. 5 years) (child report). Additionally, the concurrent validity was assessed by comparing the scores on the <b>parent</b> <b>report</b> to those on the pediatric voice handicap index. Furthermore, the validity of the parent proxy assessment and the relationship between age and responses on the VELO questionnaire were investigated. Based on the responses of an age and gender matched control group without cleft palate, the discriminant validity was evaluated. RESULTS : The <b>parent</b> <b>report</b> was easy to complete for all parents. Nine of the fourteen (64 %) patients were able to complete the child report independently. The median scores on the <b>parent</b> <b>report</b> and the child report were 82. 7 and 95. 1 respectively. The patient group had a significantly worse perception of HRQOL compared to the control group (p < 0. 001; p = 0. 029). There {{were no significant differences between}} the responses of the parent and their child's (p = 0. 345). A significant positive correlation was found between the score on the <b>parent</b> <b>report</b> and the age of the patients (p = 0. 001). Furthermore, a significant negative correlation was found between the <b>parent</b> <b>report</b> and the P-VHI (p < 0. 001). Cronbach's α was 0. 955 and 0. 817 for the <b>parent</b> <b>report</b> and the child report respectively. CONCLUSION : The Dutch VELO questionnaire is a valid, reliable and user-friendly tool that provides important information about HRQOL in patients with cleft (lip and) palate. The first author (L. B.) was funded by a PhD grant of the Research Foundation Flanders (1 S 01216 N). [URL] Pathology and Audiolog...|$|R
