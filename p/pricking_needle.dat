There are 2 kinds of interpretation of Fanzhen from different scholars {{in the history of}} Chinese Medicine,Wenzhen(Warm needling) and Huozhen(fire needle). The interpretation focuses Fan,but not Zhen;while also focuses on Jie,but not Ci. This kind of interpretation is not clear enough. The meaning in depth of Fanzhen Jieci should not be shown. Fanzhen can be understand in general or special. In special,Fanzhen gives the meaning of needle(tools). It is proceeded by a special procedure called Cui Huo(quenching),which can enhance the strength and the conductivity. In general,Fanzhen gives the meaning of a kind of needling method. 'Jieci' emphasizes using Fanzhen(quenching <b>needle)</b> with Jieci(robbery <b>prick)</b> <b>needling</b> methods to remove the pathogenic evils.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to clarify the {{learning}} process of practice on SMBG. We analyzed the reports of 67 second-year nursing students. As a result, 363 items of learning of practice on SMBG were extracted and classified into 12 subcategories, which were further divided into 3 categories. Those three categories are (1) `awareness of <b>prick</b> with a <b>needle</b> 2 ̆ 7, (2) `awareness when measured value comes out 2 ̆ 7, and (3) `acquisition through practice 2 ̆ 7. As for (1) `awareness of <b>prick</b> with a <b>needle</b> 2 ̆ 7, we extracted following 4 subcategories:(a) `feelings before <b>prick</b> with a <b>needle</b> 2 ̆ 7, (b) `phenomena at <b>prick</b> with a <b>needle</b> 2 ̆ 7, (c) `awareness of patient 2 ̆ 7 s feelings 2 ̆ 7, and (d) `intervention at SMBG 2 ̆ 7. As to (2) `awareness when measured value comes out 2 ̆ 7, we got following three categories:(a) `worry about blood glucose 2 ̆ 7, (b) `consideration into patient 2 ̆ 7 s feelings 2 ̆ 7, and (c) `intervention after blood glucose becomes clear 2 ̆ 7, Concerning (3) `acquisition through practice 2 ̆ 7, we extracted five subcategories such as (a) `confidence 2 ̆ 7, (b) `understanding of significance of SMBG from the viewpoint of selfmanagement 2 ̆ 7, (c) `significance of practice 2 ̆ 7, (d) `interest in diabetes and SMBG, and will to learn about them 2 ̆ 7, and (e) `feeling about health promotion 2 ̆ 7. Through SMBG simulation, the students have come to know the know-how of intervention by learning, from the standpoint of patients, about feelings, perception, and phenomena at <b>prick</b> with a <b>needle</b> as well as when measured value comes out. The students were almost perfect in three domains such as affective, cognitive, and psychomotor domains. So it was suggested that educational effect of practice on SMBG is high.

As he slipped from his blankets the same strong smell of black sage and juniper smote him, almost like a blow. His nostrils seemed glued together by some rich piny pitch; and when he opened his lips to breathe a sudden pain, as of a knife-thrust, pierced his lungs. The thought following was as sharp as the pain. Pneumonia! What he had long expected! He sank against the cedar, overcome by the shock. But he rallied presently, for with the reestablishment of the old settled bitterness, which had been forgotten in the interest of his situation, he remembered that he had given up hope. Still, he could not get back at once to his former resignation. He hated to acknowledge that the wildness of this desert canyon country, and the spirit it sought to instil in him, had wakened a desire to live. For it meant only more to give up. And after one short instant of battle he was himself again. He put his hand under his flannel shirt and felt of the soreness of his lungs. He found it not at the apex of the right lung, always the one sensitive spot, but all through his breast.

It is therefore important to know wether PP is a fix manifestation of the disease or a cyclic manifestation like mucocutaneous disorders. To evaluate the charaterist'tc of P'P over a period of time, 77 patients were selected randomly (rcgaardless of their disease activity or their disease manifestations), to have a second pathergy test, lite pathcrgy test was performed by needle puncture on the skin of the forearm.

METHODS [...] The pathergy phenomenon was assessed in 183 patients with Behçet's syndrome in a single blind study at 48 hours after a <b>needle</b> <b>prick</b> of the forearm skin, cleaned in the conventional way with alcohol, with 10 % povidine iodine, with 100 % chlorhexidine, and with a 4 % aqueous solution of chlorhexidine. RESULTS [...] The surgical cleaning of the forearm with povidone iodine before {{the application of the}} <b>needle</b> <b>prick</b> reduced the prevalence of the pathergy reaction to 27 % from 48 % in the conventionally (by alcohol swab) cleaned forearm. Cleaning the forearm with 100 % chlorhexidine reduced the prevalence of the pathergy to 36 % from 59 % in the conventionally cleaned forearm. No significant changes were observed with a 4 % aqueous solution of chlorhexidine. CONCLUSIONS [...] Surgical cleaning of the skin with disinfectants of various concentrations reduces the prevalence of a positive pathergy test in Behçet's syndrome. This implies that more than the disruption of the structural integrity of the dermis and epidermis is involved in the production of the pathergy phenomenon in Behçet's syndrome...|$|R

Participants were instructed to imagine the feeling of the person whose hand was shown and to evaluate his or her affective state. Pain conditions elicited greater EEG suppression than did nonpain conditions, particularly over frontocentral regions. Moreover, an interaction between pain and similarity revealed that for similar others, the pain effect was significant, whereas in the dissimilar-other group, suppression was equally large in the pain and no-pain conditions. We conclude that mu/alpha suppression is elicited both automatically, by observing a situation that is potentially painful for the observer, and by empathy for pain, even if the other person is different from oneself...|$|R

The average age of the respondents was 23 years, with a minimum age of 18 and a maximum age of 35. The sample consisted of more females than males. The majority of respondents were in the second year of study. The majority (56 %) rated needle recapping, disposing used needles (28. 1 %) and cleaning sharp instruments (56. 3 %) as extremely high-risk procedures. Furthermore, 30. 2 % of the respondents thought suturing and blood taking (33. 3 %) were high-risk procedures for NPI, while 25 % rated administering injections, 35. 5 % rated blood transfusion and 74. 8 % rated the lack of adequate containers for sharps disposal to be highly associated with the risk of NPI. A significant proportion of the respondents rated the lack of knowledge about NPI (policies and protocols) at institutions of clinical training as an extremely high risk, followed by the lack of accompaniment and in-service training. Only 16. 0 % of the respondents had suffered NPI and only 8. 3 % had reported the incident. Conclusion: Procedures rated as high risk were considered to be most likely associated with the occurrence of NPI.

30|$|We used {{wild-type}} (WT), Drosomycin-green fluorescent protein (GFP), and NF-κB-luc reporter male Drosophila melanogaster 4 – 5  days of age (unmanipulated). We infected Drosophila with Staphylococcus aureus (infected without treatment) or <b>pricked</b> with aseptic <b>needles</b> (sham). Subsets {{of insects}} {{were treated with}} oral linezolid after the infection (infected with antibiotics). We assessed rapid iterative negative geotaxis (RING) in all the groups as a surrogate for neuromuscular functional outcome up to 96  h following infection. We harvested the flies over the 7 -day course to evaluate bacterial burden, inflammatory and metabolic pathway gene expression patterns, NF-κB translation, and metabolic reserve. We also followed the lifespan of the flies.|$|R
40|$|A {{technique}} to enable long-term blood sampling from piglets aged 2 - 3 months is described. Piglets were housed individually in expandable cages and a hepar-inized polyurethane catheter was {{inserted into the}} external jugular vein. A technique was used which prevented the catheter from {{pulling out of the}} vein with growth of the animals. Blood samples could be obtained for more than 1 Qlonth, and levels of cortisol, glucose, white blood cell count, haematocrit, rectal temperature and heart rate were compared for samples obtained from simulated conventional vene-punctures and from the cannula using this technique. It was shown that restraint and <b>needle</b> <b>pricks</b> raised these levels considerably...|$|R
