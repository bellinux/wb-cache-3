5|$|The iPad 2 has a 25WÂ·h {{rechargeable}} {{lithium-ion polymer battery}} {{that lasts}} 10 hours, like the original iPad. It is charged via USB or included 10 W, 2 A <b>power</b> <b>adapter.</b> The battery is 2.5mm thick, 59% smaller than the original and has three cells instead of two. The improvements allowed the injection-molded plastic support frame to be omitted. The 10 W USB <b>power</b> <b>adapter</b> provides 4x {{the power of a}} conventional USB port. The tablet has an audio frequency response of 20 Hz to 20kHz. Without third-party software it can play the following audio formats: HE-AAC, AAC, Protected AAC, MP3, MP3 VBR, Audible formats (2, 3, 4, AEA, AAX, and AAX+), ALAC, AIFF, and WAV.|$|E
5|$|Apple {{offers several}} other accessories, {{most of which}} are {{adapters}} for the proprietary 30-pin dock connector, the only port besides the headphone jack. A dock holds the iPad upright at an angle, and has a dock connector and audio line-out port. The iPad can use Bluetooth keyboards that also work with Macs and PCs. The iPad can be charged by a standalone <b>power</b> <b>adapter</b> ("wall charger") compatible with iPods and iPhones, and a 10 Watt charger is included.|$|E
50|$|Older devices with <b>power</b> <b>adapters</b> {{that are}} large and are warm to the touch use several watts of <b>power.</b> Newer <b>power</b> <b>adapters</b> that are {{lightweight}} and are not warm to the touch may use less than one watt.|$|R

5|$|On September 17, 1992, Apple {{recalled}} 60,000 PowerBook100s {{because of}} a potential safety problem. An electrical short, it was discovered, could melt a small hole in the casing, which occurred {{in three of the}} 60,000 notebooks manufactured between October 1991 and March 1992. On the day of the recall, Apple shares closed at $47, down $1.25, but some analysts discounted the recall's importance. In addition, the original power supplies had problems with insulation cracks that could cause a short in a fuse on the motherboard; and the computer was prone to cracks in the <b>power</b> <b>adapter</b> socket on the motherboard, which required a $400 replacement motherboard if the warranty had expired.|$|E
5|$|The iPad uses an {{internal}} rechargeable lithium-ion polymer (LiPo) battery. The batteries {{are made in}} Taiwan by Simplo Technology (60%) and Dynapack International Technology. The iPad {{is designed to be}} charged with a high current of 2 amperes using the included 10 W USB <b>power</b> <b>adapter</b> and USB cord with a USB connector at one end and a 30-pin dock connector at the other end. While it can be charged by a standard USB port from a computer, these are limited to 500 milliamperes (0.5 amps). As a result, if the iPad is running while powered by a normal USB computer port, it may charge very slowly, or not at all. High-power USB ports found in newer Apple computers and accessories provide full charging capabilities.|$|E

50|$|External <b>power</b> <b>adapters</b> can fail, and {{can become}} {{separated}} from the product {{they are intended to}} power. Consequently, there is a market for replacement adapters. The replacement must match input and output voltages, match or exceed current capability, and be fitted with a matching connector. Many electrical products are poorly labeled with information concerning the power supply they require, so it is prudent to record the specifications of the original power supply in advance, to ease replacement if the original is later lost. Careful labeling of <b>power</b> <b>adapters</b> can also reduce the likelihood of a mixup which could cause equipment damage.|$|R

5|$|This iPad uses an {{internal}} rechargeable lithium-ion polymer (LiPo) battery that {{can hold a}} charge of 11,560mAh. The batteries are made in Taiwan by Simplo Technology (60%) and Dynapack International Technology (40%). The iPad {{is designed to be}} charged with a relatively high current of 2amps using the included 12W USB <b>power</b> <b>adapter</b> and Lightning connector. While it can be charged by an older USB port from a computer, these are limited to 500milliamps (0.5amps). As a result, if the iPad is in use while powered by a computer, it may charge very slowly, or not at all. High-power USB ports found in newer computers and accessories provide full charging capabilities. Apple claims that the battery can provide up to 10hours of video, audio playback, or web surfing on Wi-Fi, 9hours of web surfing over a cellular connection, or one month on standby. Like any rechargeable battery, the iPad's battery loses capacity over time. However, the iPad's battery is not user-replaceable. In a program similar to iPod and iPhone battery-replacement programs, Apple promised to replace an iPad that does not hold an electrical charge with a refurbished unit for a fee. During the battery replacement process, user data is not preserved/transferred, and repaired or refurbished units come with a new case. The warranty on the refurbished unit may vary between jurisdictions.|$|E

25|$|At launch, the Switch {{was sold}} as a bundle with a MSRP of Â¥29,980 (Japan), $299.99 (United States), Â£279.99 (United Kingdom), and AU$469.95 (Australia); with {{standardized}} pricing for the European market varying. The bundle includes the Switch Console, the Dock, two Joy-Con (left and right), two Joy-Con Straps, the Grip, a <b>power</b> <b>adapter</b> and an HDMI cable. Fils-AimÃ© said {{that the company had}} been aiming to keep the bundle's price point at $300 in the United States, fearing that including any additional hardware or games would raise the price to a level that would discourage consumers and harm sales.|$|E
25|$|A {{charging}} grip {{is available}} for the Joy-Con, which provides a means to attach a USB-C cable for power. Alongside that, Nintendo released a charging strap that allows players to charge an individual Joy-Con via embedded AA batteries. Nintendo offers a Joy-Con Wheel, a small steering wheel-like unit that a Joy-Con can slot into, allowing it {{to be used for}} racing games like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. The Switch supports the wireless Pro Controller, which has a more traditional design reminiscent of the Wii Classic Controller Pro and Wii U Pro Controller. As of Switch System Software 3.0.0 a setting can be turned on to use the controller in wired USB mode, however currently this will disable the NFC touchpoint. Standalone Docks are available, which include the <b>power</b> <b>adapter</b> and HDMI cable. Third parties also support the Switch with additional accessories, such as carrying cases and screen protectors. The 4.0.0 system update enabled support for GameCube controllers attached via USB with the Wii U GameCube adapter.|$|E
500|$|Some reviewers {{applauded the}} MacBook Pro for its {{doubling}} or tripling {{the speed of}} the PowerBook G4 in some areas. For example, the 3D rendering program Cinema 4D XL was 3.3times as fast (2.3 times faster), and its boot-up time was more than twice as quick. The MacBook Pro generally outperformed the PowerBook G4 in performance analyzer utility tests XBench and Cinebench. Reviewers lauded the screen's maximum brightness, 67percent higher than the PowerBook G4; the excellent horizontal viewing angles; the matte options; and the bright, crisp, and true colors. Although the screen offered fewer vertical pixels (1,440Ã900 in the MacBook Pro instead of 1,440Ã960 in the PowerBook), one reviewer called the screen [...] "nothing less than stellar". Reviewers praised the new MagSafe <b>power</b> <b>adapter,</b> although one reviewer said it disconnected too easily in some instances. They also praised the backlit keyboard, large trackpad, and the virtually silent operation of the machine. The new laptop also offered better wireless performance.|$|E
