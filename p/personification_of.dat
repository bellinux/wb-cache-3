5|$|Of Antisthenes' Aspasia {{only two}} or three {{quotations}} are extant. This dialogue contains much slander, but also anecdotes pertaining to Pericles' biography. Antisthenes appears to have attacked not only Aspasia, but the entire family of Pericles, including his sons. The philosopher believes that the great statesman chose the life of pleasure over virtue. Thus, Aspasia is presented as the <b>personification</b> <b>of</b> the life of sexual indulgence.|$|E

5|$|Statius {{mentions}} Orion {{four times}} in his Thebaïd; twice as the constellation, a <b>personification</b> <b>of</b> storm, but twice as the ancestor of Dryas of Tanagra, one of the defenders of Thebes.

5|$|Vizzini is {{the central}} {{character}} {{in the history of}} direct Mafia support for the Allied Forces during the invasion of Sicily in 1943.

5|$|According to Lafcadio Hearn, a {{butterfly}} {{was seen in}} Japan as the <b>personification</b> <b>of</b> a person's soul; whether they be living, dying, or already dead. One Japanese superstition says that if {{a butterfly}} enters your guest room and perches behind the bamboo screen, the person whom you most love is coming to see you. Large numbers of butterflies are viewed as bad omens. When Taira no Masakado was secretly preparing for his famous revolt, there appeared in Kyoto so vast a swarm of butterflies that the people were frightened— thinking the apparition to be a portent of coming evil.|$|E

The President is also entrusted with the safety, prosperity and stability {{of the country and}} acts as an intermediary between the bodies of the national government.|$|E
5|$|Hope {{is closely}} related to Idle Child of Fancy, {{completed}} by Watts in 1885, which also shows a <b>personification</b> <b>of</b> one of the traditional virtues (in this case Love) sitting on a cloud-shrouded globe. In traditional depictions of the virtues, Love was shown blindfolded while Hope was not; in Hope and Idle Child Watts reversed this imagery, depicting Love looking straight ahead and Hope as blind. It {{is believed to be the}} first time a European artist depicted Hope as blind.|$|E

5|$|Iridium was {{discovered}} in 1803 among insoluble impurities in natural platinum. Smithson Tennant, the primary discoverer, named iridium for the Greek goddess Iris, <b>personification</b> <b>of</b> the rainbow, because of the striking and diverse colors of its salts. Iridium {{is one of the}} rarest elements in Earth's crust, with annual production and consumption of only three tonnes. 191Ir and 193Ir are the only two naturally occurring isotopes of iridium, as well as the only stable isotopes; the latter is the more abundant of the two.|$|E
5|$|Orion served several {{roles in}} ancient Greek culture. The {{story of the}} adventures of Orion, the hunter, is the one on which {{we have the most}} {{evidence}} (and even on that not very much); he is also the <b>personification</b> <b>of</b> the constellation of the same name; he was venerated as a hero, in the Greek sense, in the region of Boeotia; and there is one etiological passage which says that Orion was responsible for the present shape of the Strait of Sicily.|$|E
5|$|Suggestions {{to explain}} the mythical blue men include {{that they may be}} a <b>personification</b> <b>of</b> the sea, or {{originate}} with the Picts, whose painted bodies may have given the impression of men raising themselves out of the water if they were seen crossing the sea in boats that might have resembled kayaks. The genesis of the blue men may alternatively lie with the North African slaves the Vikings took with them to Scotland, where they spent the winter months close to the Shiant Isles in the Minch.|$|E

5|$|The Kids in the Hall: Death Comes to Town (or simply Death Comes to Town) is an eight-episode Canadian mini-series that {{aired on}} CBC Television on Tuesdays between January 12 and March 16, 2010. The show {{takes place in}} a fictional Ontario town called Shuckton where their mayor has been murdered. As the Shuckton {{residents}} cope with the loss, a new lawyer moves in to prosecute a suspect – though another resident, unsatisfied with the evidence, tries to find the real killer. At the same time, a character who is a <b>personification</b> <b>of</b> death waits at a motel room for the latest Shuckton residents to die.|$|E
5|$|The Master Chief is {{a towering}} and faceless biochemically and cybernetically-enhanced supersoldier, raised and trained {{from an early}} age to be a weapon; he is almost never seen without his green-colored armor and helmet. He is {{commonly}} referred to by his naval rank, rather than his given birth-name or serial-designation. The character is voiced by Steve Downes, a Chicago disc jockey, in the video games in which he appears. Downes based his <b>personification</b> <b>of</b> the Chief on an initial character sketch which called for a Clint Eastwood–type character of few words.|$|E
5|$|The poem {{has three}} eleven-line stanzas which {{describe}} a progression through the season, {{from the late}} maturation of the crops to the harvest and to {{the last days of}} autumn when winter is nearing. The imagery is richly achieved through the <b>personification</b> <b>of</b> Autumn, and the description of its bounty, its sights and sounds. It has parallels in the work of English landscape artists, with Keats himself describing the fields of stubble that he saw on his walk as being like that in a painting.|$|E
