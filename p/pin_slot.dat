40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design of}} a mechanism with the following specifications: continuous alternate motion, wide motion phases with constant angular velocity, parallel input and output shafts, and great strokes. Those specifications derive from a possible application in the textile field. The mechanism is composed of two star wheels properly coupled together: there are two counter-rotating input wheels, alternately coupling with slots first, then teeth at each side of the output wheel. As usual for star wheels, <b>pins</b> and <b>slots</b> handle the acceleration and deceleration phases, while the constant velocity phase is performed by coupling sectors of toothed gears. A proper design of <b>pins</b> and <b>slots</b> is performed, so {{that at the same time}} when a pin from one input wheel is releasing a <b>slot,</b> a <b>pin</b> from the other input wheel engages a slot on the other side of the output wheel, forcing the latter to an opposite motion. In this way the output wheel has a continuous and smooth alternate motion. By annihilating the arrest phases typical of star wheels, the proposed system eliminates the discontinuities in the acceleration diagram. The paper develops a complete parametrical analysis of the device, underlining the effect of the constraints on the shape of the motion laws with particular emphasis on the acceleration and deceleration phases. In this way the output wheel has a continuous and smooth alternate motion. With respect to an analogous mechanism realizing the same laws of motion, e. g., cams, this device is very compact and economical, also presenting parallel input and output shafts, and significantly reduces sliding and wea...|$|R
40|$|Paper {{presented}} to the 10 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Florida, 14 - 16 July 2014. Short pin-fin arrays are used to enhance the heat transfer in cooling channels of gas turbine airfoils, combustor liners, electronic chips, bearing housings etc. Numerous experimental and numerical past studies ascertain the optimal spacing and length to height ratios within arrays of round short pin-fins for optimal heat transfer. However, the heat transfer enhancement in pin-finned channels is achieved {{at the expense of}} a significant pressure drop across the channel. Augmentation of pin-fins to improve the flow and heat transfer characteristics through the channel, may however lead to further improvements. This paper presents measured pressure drop characteristics in a channel with a staggered array of round short pin-fins where each pin has two through slots. The two slots located at the two ends of each pin have an identical slot-depth to pin-diameter ratio and slot-width to pin-diameter ratio which is 0. 48. The slots are oriented parallel to the mean flow direction in the pin-fin array. The pin-height to diameter ratio used is 1. 28 and pitch to diameter ratio in both streamwise and pitchwise direction of the pin-fin array is 2. The array consists of 13 staggered rows of pin-fins. Pressure drop in the channel is also measured with conventional solid round pin-fins. The same array spacing, pin-diameter and pin-height was used as with the slotted pin-fin array for comparison. The Reynolds number based on the mass averaged velocity and pin hydraulic diameter ranges between 3, 300 and 32, 800 covering different cooling applications. The objectives of the measurements are to investigate the effect of the pin-slots on the pressure drop over the array of pin-fins and recirculation region downstream of the <b>slotted</b> <b>pin</b> in the channel. The recirculation regions are responsible for low heat transfer coefficients on the end wall in the immediate vicinity downstream of the pin-fins. In general, the normalized pressure drop over the slotted pin-fin array decreases as Reynolds number decreases. The pressure drop over the slotted pin-fin array was also lower than the predicted pressure drop over an array of solid <b>pin</b> fins without <b>slots.</b> The normalized pressure distribution around the <b>slotted</b> <b>pin</b> circumference at mid-height shows a stagnation region over the frontal section of the <b>slotted</b> <b>pin.</b> The normalized pressure distribution changes little between 90 ° and 180 ° over the Reynolds number range that was used; this indicates a region of local flow separation. A short pin-fin array with <b>slotted</b> <b>pins</b> as described in this paper reduces the pressure drop over an array when compared to an unslotted array with the same geometrical arrangement. <b>Slotting</b> of <b>pin</b> fins may enhance the performance of an array of short pin-fins by reducing the pressure drop across the array. cf 201...|$|R

40|$|The work on {{rectangular}} microstrip antennas for {{dual frequency}} operation is reported on. The principle {{of this approach}} is based on the excitation of a patch for two or more different modes which correspond to different frequencies. However, for a given geometry, the modal frequencies have a fixed relationship; therefore, the usefulness of such a design is greatly limited. In this study three different methods have been contrived to control the frequency ratio over a wide range. First, as found prevously, if shorting pins are inserted at certain locations in the patch, the low frequency can be raised substantially. Second, if slots are cut in the patch, the high frequency can be lowered considerably. By using both techniques, the two frequency ratio can be varied approximately from 3 to 1. 3.

Suggested uses for such robots include pick and place operations, positioning within a grid system, and uses where hyper-redundancy leads to a large workspace even with discrete movements. Discrete or binary actuations offer accurate and repeatable positioning without the need for control loops that traditional manipulators necessitate. Three primary achievements are accomplished in this research. ^ The first contribution is the design, analysis, and prototyping of a three position mechanism for use in digital robotic systems. The mechanism relies on linear translation and a <b>pin</b> in <b>slot</b> connection to provide three angular output positions: a nominal position of 0 ° and two equal angular displacements. Full kinematic and static force analyses are outlined and sample results are given. The design has infinite mechanical advantage in all three output positions. The prototype is discussed and compares favorably with a previously designed mechanism used as a benchmark. ^ The second contribution is the design and analysis of an angular three position mechanism capable of cyclical motion. As in the linear design, the mechanism uses a <b>pin</b> in <b>slot</b> connection and provides three angular output positions: a nominal position of 0 ° and two equal angular displacements. Unlike the linear mechanism, the angular mechanism relies on angular motion driven by linear input and can actuate from any output position to either of the two remaining output positions. Full kinematic and static force analyses are outlined and sample results are given. The angular mechanism also has infinite mechanical advantage in all three output positions. ^ The third contribution is the presentation of a novel mechanism that uses repeated linear motions to drive an intermittent angular device. This mechanism is the modified Geneva drive, so named because it is similar to a Geneva drive. A kinematic analysis is included and several design alternatives are outlined. ...|$|R

40|$|When {{microstrip}} antennas (MSA) {{are loaded}} with monolithic stubs, shorting <b>pins</b> or <b>slots,</b> the electrical resonant length of the patch gets modified and hence tunable or multiple frequency antennas can be realized. As a stub protrudes from {{the periphery of the}} patch, this configuration occupies more space. Hence, where compact dual frequency antennas are required, cutting slots in the patch is more suitable. Using both CIM and IE 3 D, we theoretically analyze a rectangular microstrip antenna (RMSA) embedded with a rectangular slot along the non-radiating edge of the patch, yielding dual frequency operation with a broadside radiation pattern. The slot modifies the resonant length of the fundamental mode of the simple RMSA and introduces a new resonant mode similar to TM 11. The effects of slot dimensions and slot location on both of the resonance frequencies have been investigated. The proposed configuration is tunable for appropriate choice of the slot length and location of the slot. The simulation results have been verified experimentally and the theoretical resonance frequencies are within 1. 5 % of the measured values. © IEE...|$|R

The modeled spring design is capable of deflecting ± [pi]/ 6 radians, higher than any existing planar torsion spring designs, and is capable of providing 100 N-m of torque.

Important earlier reconstructions had been published by Derek de Solla Price in 1974 and Michael Wright in 2005. In this paper I will discuss the three reconstructions. Price did important work, but his reconstruction {{turned out to be}} seriously flawed, as Wright has shown in considerable detail. Wright’s work was a great advance on De Solla Price’s and resulted in a largely correct reconstruction of the topography of the wheelwork. He had identified a <b>pin</b> and <b>slot</b> mechanism that could model the anomaly of the Moon and he had discovered that the back dials consisted of spirals. Wright had got hold of most of the pieces of the puzzle, but some of the pieces didn’t fall into place. Freeth et al. gave the final solution. In the National Archeological Museum in Athens they discovered the so-called Fragment F of the mechanism. It yielded data that led to the discovery {{of the way in which}} the central wheelwork of the mechanism had functioned. I will argue that, while Wright was close to the solution, the 2006 paper in Nature represents a great step forward that was not taken easily. The creation of a team of 17 experts, engaging support from high-tech companies, can be considered an important change in research methodology. Wright worked alone; in Freeth’s team different kinds of expertise are represented by different individuals.
