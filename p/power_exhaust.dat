A typical desaxe engine will have strokes of 185° - 175° - 185° - 175°, etc., with the differential roughly (but not directly) proportional to the percentage of offset distance to stroke length.|$|E

The kerosene is used to start the turbine easily {{at the beginning of}} a trip and also to run the engine at the end of a trip to clean it, since biodiesel fuel tends to gum up the fuel system if not cleared.

40|$|The plasma {{particle}} and <b>power</b> <b>exhaust</b> to the divertor surface drives both particle {{and power}} recycling at the surface, which in return constrains the plasma density and temperature {{at the target}} and their profile further upstream. Both particle and <b>power</b> <b>exhaust</b> fluxes are mediated by the plasma sheath next to the divertor surface. In particular, the Bohm criterion constrains the ion exit flow speed, which enters directly into the particle flux and the kinetic flow energy component of the ion power flux, and indirectly into the electron power flux through the sheath potential drop. Here we give an overview on how the Bohm speed {{is set in a}} general plasma and how it enters <b>power</b> <b>exhaust</b> and power recycling at the divertor surface, and the implication on the correct implementation of sheath boundary conditions in numerical codes.

40|$|Abstract. Handoff in {{heterogeneous}} cellular networks {{is one of}} the hot {{topics for}} wireless networks beyond the third generation. We observe that a <b>power</b> <b>exhausting</b> issue may occur in a code division multiple access (CDMA) system with mixed-sized cells. During soft handoff in the downlink transmission, a number of base stations transmit signals to a user simultaneously. Usually, a microcell has a more stringent limitation on the total available power than a macrocell. Thus, ignoring the impact of various cell sizes, the traditional downlink power allocation techniques for soft handoff may easily consume excessive power to serve soft handoff users, while leaving insufficient power for serving other regular users. To resolve such an <b>power</b> <b>exhausting</b> issue in CDMA systems, we investigate different downlink power allocation techniques used in soft handoff subject to the impact of mixed-sized cells. For the single-site power allocation technique we consider the site selection diversity transmission (SSDT) technique, while for the multi-site power allocation we study the link proportional power allocation (LPPA), the quality balancing power allocation (QBPA), and the equal power allocation (EPA) techniques. We find that the multi-site LPPA technique can more efficiently allocate power to both handoff and non-handoff users than others. In an example with the ratio of the micrcocell radius/macrocell radius equal to 1 / 3, it is demonstrated that LPPA can improve the capacity over EPA, QBPA, and SSDT by 125, 30, and 5 %, respectively. By taking account of measurement errors in the same case, the capacity improvements of LPPA over EPA, QBPA, and SSDT become 180, 41, and 23 %, respectively...|$|R

40|$|Advanced divertors are {{magnetic}} geometries where {{a second}} X-point is {{added in the}} divertor region to address the serious challenges of burning plasma <b>power</b> <b>exhaust.</b> Invoking physical arguments, numerical work, and detailed model magnetic field analysis, we investigate the magnetic field structure of advanced divertors in the physically relevant region for <b>power</b> <b>exhaust</b> - the Scrape-Off Layer (SOL). A primary result of our analysis {{is the emergence of}} a physical "metric", the Divertor Index DI, that quantifies the flux expansion increase as one goes from the main X-point to the strike point. It clearly separates three geometries with distinct consequences for divertor physics - the Standard Divertor (SD, DI = 1), and two advanced geometries: the X-Divertor (XD, DI > 1) and the Snowflake (SFD, DI < 1). The XD, therefore, cannot be classified as one variant of the Snowflake. By this measure, recent NSTX and DIIID experiments are X-Divertors, not Snowflakes.

40|$|The {{concept of}} a cold {{radiating}} plasma boundary has been proposed {{as a solution to}} the problem of <b>power</b> <b>exhaust</b> in magnetically confined fusion plasmas. We describe experiments to study the impact of the radiating impurities on transport processes in the plasma boundary and the plasma core in the tokamak TEXTOR. The injection of impurities (neon, silicon, or argon) leads to the formation of a radiating plasma boundary where up to 90 % of the input power can be distributed to large wall areas, thereby strongly reducing the convective heat flux density onto the plasma-facing components. At high plasma densities the impurity seeding leads to a transition to an improved confinement state termed the radiative improved mode. This operational scenario combines high density and high confinement with <b>power</b> <b>exhaust</b> by radiation under quasi-stationary discharge conditions. The confinement improvement can be explained by a reduction of transport caused by the ion temperature gradient mode. This reduction is initiated by the impurity content and amplified by a characteristic steepening of the density profiles of the background plasma. The extrapolation of the results obtained in TEXTOR, based on experiments in larger devices, is discussed...|$|E
