Although it could be the case in some kinds of constructions because of the higher degree of independence of individual persons and the concentration of people in multi-story buildings, there are more <b>partitions</b> <b>between</b> different heated <b>spaces.</b> This caused us to wonder about the relevance of climatic energy loss through these interior partitions according to different occupancy patterns.

50|$|Like typical Japanese houses, Ruth Fairfax House's walls {{consisted}} of movable shoji (wood and translucent paper screens to filter the light between the exterior and interior) and fusuma (heavier paper mache <b>partitions</b> <b>between</b> interior <b>spaces</b> to provide privacy). The only fixed walls were around the kitchen, bathroom and tokonamas. These walls, presumably for bracing {{were made from}} a plaster on lathe. Heavy timber storm shutters or amado ran around the verandah and effectively formed another layer of enclosure. These could be slid away or removed entirely storing neatly away in the amaboko {{at the end of}} each run. At the New Farm site, the kitchen was detached off a servery via the dining room. A bathroom and teahouse were also located in the grounds.|$|R

The mate is then shaken very gently with a side-to-side motion. This further settles the yerba mate inside the gourd so that the finest particles move toward the opening and the yerba is layered along one side.

These were {{three types of}} TBS: Overlap (Type I), Symmetrically (Type II) and Convergence (Type III). Through a comprehensive bibliographical research, {{it is possible to}} identify the influenced parameters, and to show that the optimum efficiency of the Savonius rotor can be particularly improved their <b>partition</b> <b>space</b> <b>between</b> blade and tandem. This simulation shows the way of the flow characteristic and pressure distribution pattern in and around of the blade swept area. The results show that the convergence TBS (Type III) have a higher gap pressure between upstream and downstream, or they have best performance than other types...|$|R
40|$|Efficient thermal {{insulation}} {{has so far}} focused on improving building’s envelope, understanding a building as a unique thermal space. Although {{it could be the}} case for some kinds of constructions, because of the more independence of each person and the concentration of people in multistory buildings, there are more <b>partitions</b> <b>between</b> different heated <b>spaces</b> and it makes us wonder about the relevance of thermal energy loses through these interior partitions. Aiming to answer this question, we divided our research into two main steps: first basic calculations of different building typologies, and developing an accurate virtual model to represent this phenomenon. In our first approach we looked for some numbers of what this yet-non-studied energy flow could represent to the whole energy flux in two different building typologies by using a monitoring system named SIRENA from Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya ([URL] How relevant are interior losses compared with losses through the building’s envelope? Are those losses hight enough to be studied and improved? The answer is rotundly “yes”! We concluded that this loses represents about a 20...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{optimize}} the air-gap flux density and reduce the difficulty of processing, a surface mounted <b>partition</b> <b>between</b> poles(PBP) Halbach magnet of permanent magnet synchronous motor is designed. The influence between the parameters of <b>partition</b> <b>between</b> poles Halbach magnet and the waveform of air-gap flux density are systematically analyzed. On this basis,the way to choose the best parameters of <b>partition</b> <b>between</b> poles Halbach magnet is proposed. The Correctness {{of the way to}} choose the result of optimization is verified, and the superiority of the <b>partition</b> <b>between</b> poles Halbach magnet is also verified further through FEA and experimentation respectively...|$|R
