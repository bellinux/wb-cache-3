2500|$|The XTBD Devastator, which flew for {{the first}} time on 15 April 1935, marked a large number of [...] "firsts" [...] for the US Navy. It was the first widely used carrier-based {{monoplane}} as well as the first all-metal naval aircraft, the first with a totally enclosed cockpit, the first with <b>power-actuated</b> (hydraulically) folding wings and in these respects the TBD was revolutionary. A semi-retractable landing gear was fitted, with the wheels designed to protrude [...] below the wings to permit a [...] "wheels-up" [...] landing which might limit damage to the aircraft. A crew of three was normally carried beneath a large [...] "greenhouse" [...] canopy almost half the length of the aircraft. The pilot sat in front; a rear gunner/radio operator took the rearmost position, while the bombardier occupied the middle seat. During a bombing run, the bombardier lay prone, sliding into position under the pilot to sight through a window in the bottom of the fuselage, using the Norden Bombsight.|$|E
50|$|The Venom NF.2 {{was quickly}} {{modified}} after being subject to several accidents in which pilots had trouble making nighttime approaches; changes included {{the adoption of}} jettisonable clear canopies and alterations to the flight control surfaces, the altered aircraft were re-designated as NF.2As. The Venom NF.2 was soon followed by the NF 3, which was the ultimate night fighter variant of the Venom. The NF 3 had further improvements, including <b>power-actuated</b> ailerons and an improved air interception radar. In 1953, the Venom NF 3 performed its first flight; it entered operational service with the RAF during June 1955.|$|E
5000|$|Three Tachikoma {{survive the}} {{mandatory}} decommissioning, (one blue, calling itself [...] "Batou's Personal Tachikoma", and two others, repainted yellow and silver) and prove their worth when they abandon their new civilian jobs {{to save their}} imperiled comrades, without explicit orders to do so. The silver Tachikoma is destroyed on sight after it rescues Batou from attack by an Armed Suit, a bipedal <b>power-actuated</b> armored exoskeleton. The blue and yellow Tachikoma combine their efforts to save him, and conduct a desperate and ultimately suicidal attack against the Umibozu, while Batou watches from a nearby terrace with a stricken look on his face. This selfless act {{is the last thing}} they ever do. Those sent to the lab for structural analysis were restored from backups, their A.I. given a slew of upgrades and loaded into a new fleet, which appears in the second season.|$|E
