Large radius curves, resulting in a shallower point angle, will produce lower drags, particularly at supersonic velocities. Hollow point bullets behave much like a flat point of the same <b>point</b> <b>diameter.</b> Projectiles designed for supersonic use often have a slightly tapered base at the rear, called a boat tail, which reduces air resistance in flight. Cannelures, which are recessed rings around the projectile used to crimp the projectile securely into the case, will cause an increase in drag.|$|E

Vacuum fixtures give better signal reading versus the press-down type. On the other hand, vacuum fixtures are expensive because of their high manufacturing complexity. Moreover, vacuum fixtures cannot be used on bed-of-nails systems that are used in automated production lines, where the board is automatically loaded to the tester by a handling mechanism.The bed of nails or fixture, as generally termed, is used together with an in-circuit tester. Fixtures with a grid of 0.8 mm for small nails and test <b>point</b> <b>diameter</b> 0.6 mm are theoretically possible without using special constructions. But in mass production, test point diameters of 1.0 mm or higher are normally used to minimise contact failures leading to lower remachining costs.|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of a new joining technology, which is used to manufacture high strength hybrid constructions with thermoplastic composites (FRP) and metals, is introduced. Similar to natural regulation effects at trees, fibers around the FRP joint become aligned along the lines of force and will not be destroyed by the joining process. This is achieved by the local utilization of the specific plastic flow properties of the FRT and metal component. Compared with usual joining methods—such as flow drill screws, blind and self-piercing rivets—noticeably higher tensile properties can be realized through the novel process management. The load-bearing capability increasing effect could be proved on hybrid joints with hot-dip galvanized steel HX 420 LAD and orthotropic glass—as well as carbon—fiber reinforced plastics. The results, which were determined in tensile-shear and cross-shear tests according to DIN EN ISO 14273 and DIN EN ISO 14272, are compared with holding loads of established joining techniques with similar joining <b>point</b> <b>diameter</b> and material combinations...|$|E
30|$|As organic {{materials}} exhibit good absorption of CO 2 laser light, CO 2 laser of wavelength 10.6  µm {{has been applied}} almost exclusively in the machining of wood [1, 2]. As the laser can provide high output power at a relatively low cost, CO 2 laser {{has been used for}} cutting and welding applications that require high-speed machining with high output power, not only of wood but also other materials. Meanwhile, in the field of precision machining, short-wavelength lasers are being used that have, for example, wavelengths in the vicinity of Nd:YAG lasers (wavelength 1064  nm) and other, even shorter wavelengths. This is because, as the theoretical focal <b>point</b> <b>diameter</b> is proportional to wavelength, the use of short-wavelength lasers enables precise machining. In addition, lasers are normally irradiated at a short pulse width, as shortening the pulse width allows heat effects to the surrounding area to be controlled while increasing the peak power. In recent times, shorter and shorter pulse widths are being achieved, reaching nano-, pico-, and even femtoseconds.|$|E
40|$|Microfiltration of {{emulsions}} of oil (dodecane) {{in water}} using electrospun membranes of poly(trimethyl hexamethylene terephthalamide) (PA 6 (3) T) is demonstrated. Rejection of the emulsified dodecane increased from (4. 3 ± 0. 9) % to (85 ± 5) % when {{the ratio of}} droplet diameter to fiber diameter (dp/df) increased from 0. 57 ± 0. 04 to 2. 5 ± 0. 4, respectively. The normalized flux (relative to the pure water flux) decreased {{in proportion to the}} increase in emulsified oil concentration. The variations observed in flux with time are well-described by models in which the oil fouls the membrane, imparting an additional resistance to transport. The resistivity of the foulant increased with an increase in the concentration of oil in the feed, and grew fastest when dp/df was close to unity. A foulant deposition model is proposed in which the oil droplets form a conformal coating on the fibers. The normalized flux of electrospun membranes was approximately three times higher than that of a commercial phase inversion membrane of comparable bubble <b>point</b> <b>diameter,</b> while exhibiting a similar rejection...|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} investigates {{two types of}} optical {{elements}} which are exposed to particularly high thermal influences during practical operation. These are, on one hand, a transmitting optics in CO_ 2 laser material processing systems, i. e. primarily coupling-out mirrors and focusing lenses, but also additional windows and telescopic lenses. Here, thermal effects are due to absorption. The aberrations caused by this, primarily produce enlarged focal <b>point</b> <b>diameters</b> {{at the location of}} processing and thus deterioration of the processing result. On the other hand, closing windows of aerial photo pickup systems are involved. Their external surface cools down to very low temperatures during photo flights at high altitudes so that an axial temperature gradient develops. Influences from the mount may cause an additional radial gradient. This results in a wave deformation and, thus, deteriorated image quality. So-called thermal influences are numerically simulated and correlated with experimental results. (orig.)

40|$|A novel {{external}} reflection FTIR device, {{which enables}} nondestructive analyses {{in the region}} from 4000 - 450 cm- 1 with a measuring <b>point</b> <b>diameter</b> of approximately 5 mm, was tested for the identification of pigments and binding media in two modern paintings and several mockups with traditional pigment-binding media combinations. Comparative measurements were carried out with minute samples using a diamond cell for transmission FTIR microscopy. The results were interpreted by comparison to database spectra measured in transmission mode. The appearance of distorted peaks in raw reflection spectra impedes a direct comparison with the collected spectra in the transmission mode. Best matches with database spectra were obtained applying the Kramers-Kronig transformation to the reflection spectra of substances showing narrow bands, particularly {{in the region of}} about 1900 to 580 cm- 1. In the case of modern paintings a good match between transmission and reflection data could be achieved in the fingerprint region. It was possible to identify organic pigments PY 3 (Pigment Yellow 3) and PR 4 (Pigment Red 4) as well as calcite and PVAc (polyvinyl acetate). The identification of materials used for preparation of the mockups was successful for lead white, calcite, Prussian blue, indigo, ultramarine, azurite, malachite, Arabic gum and linseed oil, whereas the transformed spectra of cobalt blue, Naples yellow and especially of smalt and the proteinaceous binding media could not be identified using database spectra...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to {{evaluate}} a novel method for manufacturing test patterns with high spatial resolution {{to be used for}} visual inspection of spatial resolution of micro-CT systems. High resolution test patterns of less than 50 micro m line widths or <b>point</b> <b>diameter</b> for inspection of the performance of a micro-CT system have not been reported before. Test patterns were created on a silicon wafer using a dry etching method. For reference spatial resolution measurements were carried out on micro-CT systems using thin tungsten wires. The modulation transfer function (MTF) subsequently derived from a point spread function (PSF) of the wire profile was measured to determine spatial resolution at 10 % of the contrast ratio. The test pattern chip was scanned under the same conditions for visual inspection of the spatial resolution. The results of the wire-based MTF calculations and visual inspection of the test patterns were found in very good agreement. In the manufacturing process some limitations were found due to over-etching and maximum etch depth for smaller patterns (5 ?m) adjacent to larger structures (150 micro m) on one chip. Nevertheless, these circumstances can be solved by using choice of pattern sizes for specific scanner setup. The novel method of creating high resolution test patterns for quick visual inspection offers a very attractive solution, but also allows for quantitative evaluation...|$|E

This development with other recent interests has increased the importance of superheater high temperature corrosion. The aim of this thesis is to test and develop furnace alkali chloride sampling device including coarse particle pre-separator operating as virtual impactor. This sampling device {{can be used to}} take fine particles, vapours and gas containing samples from furnace. In this thesis is presented the background of alkali chloride sampling and flue gas processes. The analysis method, difficult conditions and sample processes gives limitations for sampling. Fine particle formation, deposition mechanisms and particle classification are reviewed in theory part. The sampling device under development and sampling environment are described in this thesis. At the measurements part of the thesis the pre-separator measurements and full scale tests are presented. The sampling device and virtual impactor were tested in laboratory conditions at Tampere University of technology aerosol physics laboratory. The main focus of laboratory tests was to measure the collection efficiency of virtual impactor with different flow velocities and different probe constructions. The availability and operation of sampling device in field conditions was tested at full scale fluidized bed boilers. The pre-separator is able to cut the coarse particles from the sample flow. Though, the sampling line and some parts of the sampling device before the pre-separator can exposure to fouling. The flow velocity has the strongest influence on the cut <b>point</b> <b>diameter</b> especially with lower velocities. However, the flow velocity and the viscosity have only a small effect on the collection efficiency at field conditions. The vapour sampling is a very sensitive to losses? and the consumption of pressurized air causes expenses. /Kir 1...|$|E

40|$|The loss {{of teeth}} and their {{replacement}} by artificial denture {{is associated with}} many problems. The denture needs {{a certain amount of}} ridge height to give it retention and a long-term function. Crest lengthening procedures are performed to provide a better anatomic environment and to create proper supporting structures for more stability and retention of the denture. The purpose of our study is to describe and evaluate the effectiveness of CO 2 laser-assisted surgery in patients treated for crest lengthening (vestibular deepening). There have been various surgical techniques described in order to restore alveolar ridge height by pushing muscles attaching of the jaws. Most of these techniques cause postoperative complications such as edemas, hemorrhage, pain, infection, slow healing, and rebound to initial position. Our clinical study describes the treatment planning and clinical steps for the crest lengthening with the use of CO 2 laser beam (6 – 15 Watts in noncontact, energy density range: 84. 92 – 212. 31 [*]J/cm 2, focus, and continuous mode with a focal <b>point</b> <b>diameter</b> of 0. 3 [*]mm). At the end of each surgery, dentures were temporarily relined with a soft material. Patients were asked to mandatorily wear their relined denture for a minimum of 4 – 6 weeks and to remove it for hygienic purposes. At the end of each surgery, the deepest length of the vestibule was measured by the operator. No sutures were made and bloodless wounds healed in second intention without grafts. Results pointed out the efficiency of the procedure using CO 2 laser. At 8 weeks of post-op, the mean of crest lengthening was stable without rebound. Only a loss of 15 % was noticed. To conclude, the use of CO 2 laser is an effective option for crest lengthening...|$|E
40|$|We {{have used}} an {{interference}} filter centered at 4305 A within the bandhead of the CH radical (the 'G band') and real-time image selection at the Swedish Vacuum Solar Telescope on La Palma to produce very high contrast images of subarcsecond photospheric bright points at all locations on the solar disk. During the 6 day period of 1993 September 15 - 20 we observed active region NOAA 7581 from its {{appearance on the}} East limb to a near-disk-center position on September 20. A total of 1804 bright points were selected for analysis from the disk center image using feature extraction image processing techniques. The measured Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) distribution of the bright points in the image is lognormal with a modal value of 220 km (0 sec. 30) and an average value of 250 km (0 sec. 35). The smallest measured bright <b>point</b> <b>diameter</b> is 120 km (0 sec. 17) and the largest is 600 km (O sec. 69). Approximately 60 % of the measured bright points are circular (eccentricity approx. 1. 0), the average eccentricity is 1. 5, and the maximum eccentricity corresponding to filigree in the image is 6. 5. The peak contrast of the measured bright points is normally distributed. The contrast distribution variance {{is much greater than}} the measurement accuracy, indicating a large spread in intrinsic bright-point contrast. When referenced to an averaged 'quiet-Sun' area in the image, the modal contrast is 29 % and the maximum value is 75 %; when referenced to an average intergranular lane brightness in the image, the distribution has a modal value of 61 % and a maximum of 119 %. The bin-averaged contrast of G-band bright points is constant across the entire measured size range. The measured area of the bright points, corrected for pixelation and selection effects, covers about 1. 8 % of the total image area. Large pores and micropores occupy an additional 2 % of the image area, implying a total area fraction of magnetic proxy features in the image of 3. 8 %. We discuss the implications of this area fraction measurement in the context of previously published measurements which show that typical active region plage has a magnetic filling factor on the order of 10 % or greater. The results suggest that in the active region analyzed here, less than 50 % of the small-scale magnetic flux tubes are demarcated by visible proxies such as bright points or pores...|$|E
40|$|Electrospun {{membranes}} {{are attractive}} for the liquid filtration applications especially as microfiltration membranes {{because they are}} low in solidity and have open, highly interconnected porous structures. Nevertheless, liquid filtration processes are pressure driven; hence, {{it is crucial to}} understand the compressive behaviors of electrospun membranes. Compressive properties of electrospun fiber mats are reported {{for the first time in}} this thesis. Membranes of bisphenol-A polysulfone (PSU) and of poly(trimethyl hexamethylene terephthalamide) (PA 6 (3) T) were electrospun and annealed at a range of temperatures spanning the glass transition temperature of each polymer. The data for applied stress versus solidity of membrane were found to be welldescribed by a power law of the form [sigma]zz =kE([phi]n - [phi]no) where [sigma]-zz is the applied stress and [phi] is solidity, in accord with the analysis of Toll (Polym. Eng Sci., 2004). The values of n range from 3. 2 to 6 for PSU and from 8. 0 to 20 for PA 6 (3) T. The lowest values in each case were exhibited by mats annealed near the glass transition temperature of the fiber material. The higher values of n are attributed to fiber slippage via a mechanism analogous to that of work hardening of metals. The values of kE can vary by an order of magnitude and were difficult to determine precisely, due to the nature of the power law and the inhomogeneity of the mats. The hydraulic permeabilities of electrospun fiber membranes are found to be functions of their compressibilities. Hydraulic permeabilities of electrospun PSU membranes experience a decrease of more than 60 % in permeability between 5 and 140 kPa, due to the increase in solidity, attributed to flow-induced compression. This behavior is explained using a simple model based on Darcy's law applied to a compressible, porous medium. Happel's equation is used to model the permeability of the fiber membranes, and Toll's equation is used to model their compressibilities. The permeation model accurately estimates the changes in solidity, and hence the permeability of the electrospun membranes, over a range of pressure differentials. The permeability of commercial phase inversion membrane was higher than those of electrospun membranes at pressures greater than 8 kPa. Microfiltration of emulsions of oil (dodecane) in water using electrospun PA 6 (3) T membranes was demonstrated. Rejection of the emulsified dodecane decreased from (85 +/- 5) % to (4. 3 +/- 0. 9) % when the ratio of droplet diameter to fiber diameter (dp/df) decreased from 2. 5 +/- 0. 4 to 0. 57 +/- 0. 04, respectively. The normalized flux (relative to the pure water flux) decreased in proportion to the increase in emulsified oil concentration, and decreased with the increase in the total solidity of the membranes. The resistances from the oil were in series with the resistances of the membranes tested. The resistivity of the foulant increased with an increase in the concentration of oil. Foulant deposition models showed that the oil droplets formed a coating that enveloped the fibers. The normalized flux of electrospun membranes was approximately three times higher than that of commercial phase inversion membrane of comparable bubble <b>point</b> <b>diameter,</b> while exhibiting a similar rejection. by Looh Tchuin (Simon) Choong.
