40|$|DE 10012538 C UPAB: 20011005 NOVELTY - The {{modulator}} has {{a device}} for pre-distorting I and Q components. The pre-distorted I component is formed as {{the difference between}} the I component multiplied by a first pre-distortion component and the Q component multiplied by a second pre-distortion component. The pre-distorted Q component is alternately formed as the sum of the I and Q components multiplied respectively by the first and second pre-distortion components. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The modulator has a <b>pre-distortion</b> <b>device</b> for pre-distorting the I and Q components with a signal dependent on the components. The pre-distorted I component is formed as {{the difference between the}} I component multiplied by a first pre-distortion component and the Q component multiplied by a second pre-distortion component. The pre-distorted Q component is alternately formed as the sum of the I component multiplied by the first pre-distortion component and the Q component multiplied by the second pre-distortion component. INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following: a method of processing a time discrete I/Q signal. USE - E. g. for use in transmitters for digital broadcasting and in base stations for mobile communications. ADVANTAGE - A significant simplification of the modulator is achieved based on the sampling ratio of the digital signals and the symmetry of the orthogonal signal components...|$|E
