Even though they are the safest way to transport petroleum products, pipelines do still fail generating hazardous consequences and irreparable environmental damages. Many models have been developed in the last decade to predict pipeline failures and conditions. However, most of these models were limited to one failure type, such as corrosion failure, or relied mainly on expert opinion analysis. The objective {{of this paper is to}} develop a model that predicts the failure cause of oil pipelines based on factors other than corrosion. Two models are developed to help decision makers predict failure occurrence. Regression analysis and artificial neural networks (ANNs) models were developed based on historical data of pipeline accidents. The two models were able to satisfactory predict pipeline failures due to mechanical, operational, corrosion, third party and natural hazards with an average validity of 90 % for the regression model and 92 % for the ANN model. The developed models assist decision makers and pipeline operators to predict the expected failure cause(s) and to take the necessary actions to avoid them.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} novel system for {{monitoring}} {{the health of}} underground pipelines. Some of these <b>pipelines</b> <b>transport</b> dangerous contents and any damage incurred might have catastrophic consequences. However, most of these damage are unintentional and usually a result of surrounding construction activities. In order to prevent these potential damages, monitoring systems are indispensable. This paper focuses on acoustically recognizing road cutters since they prelude most construction activities in modern cities. Acoustic recognition can be easily achieved by installing a distributed computing sensor network along the pipelines and using smart sensors to “listen ” for potential threat; {{if there is a}} real threat, raise some form of alarm. For efficient pipeline monitoring, a novel monitoring approach is proposed. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was studied and applied. Eigenvalues were regarded as the special signature that could characterize a sound sample, and were thus used for the feature vector for sound recognition. The denoising ability of PCA could make it robust to noise interference. One class SVM was used for classifier. On-site experiment results show that the proposed PCA and SVM based acoustic recognition system will be very effective with a low tendency for raising false alarms.

40|$|<b>Pipelines</b> <b>transport</b> {{invaluable}} {{energy resources}} such as crude {{oil and natural gas}} over long distances. The integrity of the piping system in terms of safety of the process is then of high importance. However, pipes are prone by time to defects that may degrade their properties and lead to failures. Particularly, wall thinning is a serious anomaly that threatens aging pipelines. Therefore, their inspection plays a critical role to prevent the collapse of the system. Magnetic Flux Leakage (MFL) {{is by far the most}} effective technique of nondestructive evaluation for robotic diagnosis of ferromagnetic pipes. This work follows a novel approach to control such problem and assess the condition of the pipe by measuring with a good precision the wall radial thickness based on calibrated curves of reference and using an MFL diagnostic system tool. The proposed technique is generic and can be applied systematically for pipes with different sizes and material properties. It represents an advancement over the current conventional practices which require multiple physical experiments to generate empirical reference curves. Such procedures are cumbersome, time consuming and in consequence costly. The MFL sensing tool will be placed at the end-effector of a mobile robot platform devoted for external pipe inspection in a desert environment. It is based on permanent magnets producing a strong magnetic field that locally magnetizes and saturates the sample in question.

30|$|During {{oil and gas}} {{extraction}} and production procedures, the oil, gas, formation water and TENORM mixture ascends to the surface via drilled wells through down-hole completion and production equipment. This mixture then travels to midstream equipment via a separator, which removes the gas and relays it to a downstream gas purification plant. The degassed oil stream is further pumped to midstream production from the upstream facilities via flow lines. Gathering and production stations then remove the oily sludge, sand and geological formation water that are contaminated with TENORM. A portion of the TENORM has a solidified form and deposits on the oil field extraction and production equipment internal surfaces (Testa et al. 1994; Kvasnicka 1996; Al-Masri and Aba 2005; Othman et al. 2005; ALNabhani et al. 2015). <b>Pipelines</b> <b>transport</b> crude oil to downstream facilities for further refining, where the refined products may still harbor TENORM.

30|$|Throughout the world, {{large numbers}} of <b>pipelines</b> <b>transport</b> non-Newtonian pseudoplastic fluids {{including}} crude oils and petroleum products under turbulent flow conditions. Pipeline design involves defining pipe size, thickness, and pumping head requirements where adequate provision for flow resistance is essential. The pumping head is required to overcome the inertia, gravity, and friction of the liquid inside the pipeline. The largest resistance force is the friction which is generally {{expressed in terms of}} pressure per unit length (dp/dl) required to overcome this resistance, psi/mile. The Darcy–Weisbach model is generally utilized to calculate the frictional pressure losses. Although it is a simple model, it involves a very essential factor; the friction factor. Numerous studies (Bogue 1962; Trinh 1969; Yoo 1974; Hanks and Ricks 1975; Govier 2008) have indicated that the friction factor is proportional to the kinetic energy of the fluid per unit volume and the area of the solid surface in contact with the fluid. This is the basis of the definition of the friction factor (Streeter and Wylie 1985). This friction factor or flow coefficient is not constant. Instead, it is defined in terms of the pipe specifications and fluid properties, but it is known to a high accuracy within certain flow regimes. For example, it was indicated that turbulent friction factors for non-Newtonian fluids can be obtained from the curves used for Newtonian fluids after the proper viscosity is inserted into the generalized Reynolds number (Govier 2008). However, {{there have been a number}} of advances in understanding the flow resistance of non-Newtonian fluids. As a result, many implicit and explicit equations; empirical, semi-empirical, and analytical have been proposed in the literature to accurately predict its value. Yet, they all seem to suffer from some drawbacks, either they are simple but not accurate or they are accurate but not simple.|$|E
40|$|Erosion-corrosion is a {{destructive}} process {{which can be}} encountered in {{the oil and gas}} industry when carbon steel <b>pipelines</b> <b>transport</b> sand particles in CO 2 -containing salt water and hydrocarbons. The high degradation rates attributed to this mechanism can create increased challenges to project economy and operation where material integrity, accurate corrosion rate prediction and long term performance are key concerns. This thesis presents a project with a firm foundation in practical engineering problems, supported by strong generic engineering science which holds wider applications. The research focuses on understanding and inhibiting the degradation processes occurring on a North Sea offshore facility which had experienced a number of unexpected failures and reportedly high degradation rates between 2005 and 2010. An empirical erosion-corrosion model is developed for the facility to provide accurate assessment of degradation rate. The prediction tool is subsequently compared to commercially available CO 2 corrosion models and validated using inspection data. An assessment of the corrosion inhibition strategy on the facility and the screening of numerous corrosion inhibitors are conducted through gravimetric analysis and insitu AC/DC electrochemical techniques in static and dynamic conditions. The research discovers a more efficient chemical for controlling degradation processes on the facility whilst highlighting the ability of electrochemical techniques to help understand inhibition mechanisms and behaviour. The methods presented for interpreting the results using generic science demonstrate wider applications in both inhibited and non-inhibited environments. A review of inhibition in more extreme erosion-corrosion environments is performed to elucidate the effect of increased levels of erosion on the degradation process. The application of in-situ electrochemistry in dynamic conditions allowed the individual contribution of erosion and corrosion components of mass loss to be quantified, producing information on the different mechanisms by which inhibitors mitigate degradation effects. Finally, the optimum inhibitor in this study is broken down into is constituent components for individual analysis. A test matrix is implemented to determine the effect of synergy between the individual components. The adsorption process of the most influential component onto carbon steel is studied and determined through the implementation of electrochemistry and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) before a colorimetric technique is tailored for residual analysis purposes...|$|E
40|$|In {{oil supply}} chains, crude oil {{needs to be}} transported from oil fields to refineries, and refined {{products}} need to be transported from refineries to regional depots. On land, pipelines are the preferred mode for long-distance oil transportation, because they are safe, efficient, silent, and cheap compared to other modes of transport. Pipelines are often part of large networks, in which they connect multiple supply and demand locations. Multi-product <b>pipelines</b> <b>transport</b> batches of different products, such as gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel. Pipeline networks should be operated such that temporal and spatial differences between supply and demand are balanced, operational limitations are satisfied, and costs are minimized. This is a rather complicated task, due to the size and complexity of pipeline networks, limited capacities of tanks and pipelines, {{and the existence of}} transportation times of several days. Because batches are pushed through pipelines, transportation times of current batches depend on injections of future batches, which is a distinctive feature of the pipeline scheduling problem. The minimization of operational cost is mainly related to transmix volumes, i. e. contaminated volumes that emerge between consecutive batches, and pumping energy. In this thesis, we propose a novel pipeline scheduling method for solving the pipeline scheduling problem. It consists of a planning and a scheduling phase that are coupled in a hierarchical decomposition scheme. In the planning phase, global day-to-day transportation volumes are determined for each pipeline. In the scheduling phase, we use the planning output to generate complete schedules. Both phases contain a discrete-time Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem. The MILP planning problem is solved with truncated branch and bound. The MILP scheduling problem is further decomposed using a rolling-horizon approach; the resulting subproblems are solved with branch and bound. The pipeline scheduling method has been successfully tested on two case studies involving up to 4 products, 8 pipelines, 8 tank farms, 2 supply locations, and 5 demand locations. The proposed method is flexible in terms of network configurations, intermediate supply and demand requirements, and cost structures. Complete schedules for 30 -day horizons are obtained within 3 to 4 minutes of computation time. With respect to current industry practice, the novel pipeline scheduling method can greatly reduce the time required to generate schedules. Compared to current spreadsheet approaches, the proposed method is generic and less error-prone. Moreover, the obtained schedules are significantly better in terms of transmix and pumping costs.
