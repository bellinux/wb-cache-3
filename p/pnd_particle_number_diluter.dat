The test fuels were petroleum diesel, pure Jatropha biodiesel (B 100), 20 % and 50 % biodiesel blends with diesel fuel (B 20 and B 50). The {{results show that}} the <b>number</b> of accumulation-mode <b>particles</b> decreases with the biodiesel blend ratio, but the <b>number</b> of nucleation-mode <b>particles</b> increases. The accumulation-mode particle size at peak value decreases with increasing biodiesel blend ratio. The total <b>particle</b> <b>number</b> concentration increases with the biodiesel blend ratio, and the total <b>particle</b> <b>numbers</b> for B 20, B 50 and B 100 biodiesel fuels are approximately 3 - 4. times that of pure diesel, with the nucleation-mode particle concentration dominating the total <b>particle</b> <b>number.</b> The <b>number</b> of nucleation-mode <b>particles</b> increases when using petroleum diesel during transient operating conditions (increasing torque at constant speeds). The mass of the accumulation-mode particles of the engine with the four kinds of fuels are larger than the nucleation-mode particles under the six operating conditions. The <b>number</b> of accumulation-mode <b>particles</b> increases at the initial stage of transient process and then decreases with increasing torque. The total <b>particle</b> <b>number</b> increases steadily with torque during transient operating conditions, and the accumulation-mode particles dominate the total <b>particle</b> <b>number</b> in the beginning, while nucleation-mode particles dominate the latter stages of transient operating conditions.

We introduce a complex scalar model with <b>particle</b> <b>number</b> violating mass terms and calculate the time evolution of the <b>particle</b> <b>number</b> density with non-equilibrium quantum field theory.

Depending upon whether the chemical potential is larger or smaller than the rest mass of the scalar particle, behaviors of the number density are very different to each other.

The experiments were conducted under dynamic engine operating conditions, such as steady-state, cold start, and transient conditions. The <b>particle</b> <b>number</b> and size distributions were analyzed with a high resolution PM analyzer. The diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC) had an insignificant effect on the reduction in <b>particle</b> <b>number,</b> but <b>particle</b> <b>number</b> emissions were drastically reduced by 3 to 4 orders of magnitude downstream of the diesel particulate filter (DPF) at various steady conditions. Under high speed and load conditions, the particle filtering efficiency was decreased by the partial combustion of trapped particles inside the DPF {{because of the high}} exhaust temperature caused by the increased <b>particle</b> <b>number</b> concentration.

Providers use various risk factors as a guide to monitor and treat patient’s {{cardiovascular}} risk. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) has been used as a way to measure cholesterol, a known major risk factor of cardiovascular disease. This systematic review examines the importance of using LDL <b>particle</b> <b>number</b> in predicting future cardiovascular events compared to total LDL cholesterol, LDL-C. Methods: An exhaustive search of available medical literature was conducted using Medline-OVID, Web of Science, CINAHL and EBMR Multifile databases. The following keywords were utilized as search terms: LDL <b>particle</b> <b>number,</b> LDL cholesterol, cardiovascular disease and nuclear magnetic resonance. Study quality was assessed using the GRADE system. Results: This search resulted in 51 articles. After unrelated articles were excluded, two cohort studies and one case-control study met criteria and were included in the review. The studies looked at LDL <b>particle</b> <b>number</b> and LDL-C with primary outcomes being cardiovascular events and coronary artery disease. Overall, when looking at LDL <b>particle</b> <b>number</b> compared to total LDL cholesterol, LDL <b>particle</b> <b>number</b> was more predictive of a future cardiovascular event.

In particular the effects of different combustion processes on PM characteristics were investigated, by comparing measurements made both under normal operating condition and under DPF regeneration mode. Exhaust gas was sampled at engine outlet, at DOC outlet and at DPF outlet, in order to fully characterize PM emissions through the whole exhaust line. After a two stage dilution system, sampled gas was analyzed {{by means of a}} TSI 3080 SMPS, in the range from 6 to 240 nm. <b>Particle</b> <b>number</b> and size distribution were evaluated at part load operating conditions, representative of urban driving. Finally, <b>particle</b> <b>number</b> and size distribution at engine outlet were also evaluated fuelling the engine with neat FAME (Fatty Acid Methyl Ester), in order to evaluate the impact of alternative fuels on PM characteristics during normal operating conditions.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the characteristics of}} diesel exhaust <b>particle</b> <b>number</b> and size distributions. These were measured for different engine load conditions from 10 % to 100 % of full engine load at a maximum torque of constant speed, using mini-dilution tunnel and sampling (MDTS) and ejector-diluter and sampling (EDS) systems. The exhaust particles sampled were analysed using a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS). In general, the <b>particle</b> <b>number</b> concentration increased with increasing engine load using both measurement systems. Comparing the <b>particle</b> <b>number</b> and volume concentrations, the MDTS system measures a lower level in the nanoparticle range, Dp< 50 nm, but a higher level in the accumulation mode size range, 50 <D p< 670 nm, than the EDS system. The measurements also showed that the MDTS system shifted the particle count median diameter (CMD) to larger particle diameter and the <b>particle</b> <b>number</b> size and volume distribution for all engine load conditions. It is mainly because the mini-dilution tunnel leads to the particle transformations of nucleation and condensation taking place simultaneously when the exhaust particle emissions are cooled and diluted. However, the effect of coagulation on the total <b>number</b> <b>particle</b> concentration was shown to be negligible. On the other hand, the EDS measurement system can minimise the particle transformations taking place on the exhaust <b>particle</b> <b>number</b> and size distributions during the heated dilution process.
