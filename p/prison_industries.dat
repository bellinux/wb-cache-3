500|$|The 1970s and 1980s saw {{numerous}} {{changes at}} a departmental level, and adjustments in {{the roles and}} responsibilities of the state's prison system. In 1971, within the midst of Campbell's reforms, the Prisons Department was renamed the Department of Corrections, and restructured into three divisions: Treatment and Training Branch, Correctional Psychiatric Branch, and Establishments Branch. The position of comptroller general was replaced with director of the department. [...] William Kidston succeeded Campbell following his death in 1977. Amidst growing prisoner numbers, Kidston oversaw a shift in policy from [...] "paternalistic rehabilitation" [...] of prisoners to merely providing opportunities for rehabilitation. The department was reorganised, with the Treatment and Training Branch becoming the Support Services Branch, with other branches for administration, institutions, and <b>prison</b> <b>industries.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The early 1920s {{brought the}} end to some more Ossining institutions, even as the village's {{population}} reached 12,000, many moving into farms newly subdivided into suburban residential neighborhoods on the village's outskirts. In 1920, a new warden at the prison shut down several <b>prison</b> <b>industries,</b> including the quarry. [...] Two years later, the Olive Opera House closed after almost 60 years. It was soon converted into a small factory. Two years after that, in 1924, the trolley system was shut down and dismantled, as more residents owned cars {{and more of the}} roads were paved. A bus system replaced it.|$|E
50|$|The Department of Corrections has {{annual budget}} of over $500 million.

50|$|The Ashurst-Sumners Act limits <b>prison</b> <b>industries</b> {{and prison}} labor while {{preserving}} a double government monopoly over the manufacturing {{and sale of}} prison-made goods and prison labor.

Prisons in the 1800s made money, while today's prisons are extremely expensive. The Prison Industry Enhancement Certification Program only substitutes different but equally burdensome limitations. In the 1800s, several state prisons made money, and one New York prison made profits four times greater than the cost of running the prison.|$|E

2500|$|According to Marie Gottschalk, a {{professor}} of political science at the University of Pennsylvania, studies that claim private prisons are cheaper to run than public prisons fail to [...] "take into account the fundamental differences between private and public facilities," [...] and that the <b>prison</b> <b>industry</b> [...] "engages in a lot of cherry-picking and cost-shifting to maintain the illusion that the private sector does it better for less." [...] The American Civil Liberties Union [...] reported in 2013 that numerous studies indicate private jails are actually filthier, more violent, less accountable, and possibly more costly than their public counterparts. The ACLU stated that the for-profit <b>prison</b> <b>industry</b> is [...] "a major contributor to bloated state budgets and mass incarceration – not a part of any viable solution to these urgent problems." [...] The primary reason Louisiana is the prison capital of the world is because of the for-profit <b>prison</b> <b>industry.</b> According to The Times-Picayune, [...] "a majority of Louisiana inmates are housed in for-profit facilities, which must be supplied with a constant influx of human beings or a $182million industry will go bankrupt." ...|$|R

5000|$|Proposition 36 was predated by {{two major}} trends {{since the late}} 20th century: rapidly {{increasing}} incarceration rates {{and the expansion of}} the private <b>prison</b> <b>industry.</b> Beginning in the late 1970s, President Richard Nixon announced the “war on drugs,” which led to 'tough on crime' policies by a range of politicians. Changes included mandatory minimum sentencing, harsh penalties barring inmates from being granted parole or probation, and stricter punishments for drug users {{both in and out of}} the prison. Neither party wanted to appear [...] "soft on crime", and criminalization of minor offenses continued, resulting in high rates of incarceration. In response to but surpassing the growing numbers of inmates, the private <b>prison</b> <b>industry</b> expanded nearly 1600% between 1990-2009.|$|R
