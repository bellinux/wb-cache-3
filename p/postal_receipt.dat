50|$|John Wilkinson was {{appointed}} Postmaster on February 24, 1820, {{of the area}} that included several small towns and villages, including; Bogardus Corners, Cossit's Corners and Salina.

The interior was renovated in the 1960s, the only significant change to the building since its construction.|$|R
60|$|During {{the past}} fiscal year the {{financial}} {{condition of the}} Post-Office Department {{has been one of}} increasing prosperity, and I am gratified in being able to state that the actual postal revenue has nearly equaled the entire expenditures, the latter amounting to $11,314,206.84 and the former to $11,163,789.59, leaving a deficiency of but $150,417.25. In 1860, the year immediately preceding the rebellion, the deficiency amounted to $5,656,705.49, the <b>postal</b> <b>receipts</b> of that year being $2,645,722.19 less than those of 1863. The decrease since 1860 in the annual amount of transportation has been only about 25 per cent, but the annual expenditure on account of the same has been reduced 35 per cent. It is manifest, therefore, that the Post-Office Department may become self-sustaining in a few years, even with the restoration of the whole service.|$|R
40|$|As {{part of the}} Road Home program, homeowners {{were given}} an option to rebuild instead of turning their {{property}} over to the Louisiana Land Trust. Owners of Option 1 properties were given up to $ 150, 000 towards rehabilitation or replacement post Hurricane Katrina in 2005. This paper provides an update to the initial study that was conducted in the Summer 2010 to evaluate the status of Road Home Option 1 properties. The property has an attached covenant that required rehabilitation within 3 years of fund receipt. There have been concerns that these homes have not met this legal requirement and may become future blight or turned into Option 2 / 3 homes that must be managed then sold by the State. While Louisiana Land Trust administration has used proxies for rehabilation (such as US <b>postal</b> <b>receipt</b> or Electrical usage), an on-the-ground parcel study has not been completed on over the 30, 000 properties throughout the City of New Orleans, LA. This paper describes the process to develop a unique dataset prior to site analysis to evaluate {{a sample of the}} Option 1 properties citywide. Converting the static property address data and matching this to the City parcel data allowed advanced GIS network analysis to identify the properties then conduct site visits. The result of this study suggests that monitoring reinvestment post disaster can be done with technology but cannot replace direct observation in the community...|$|E
50|$|During World War One, {{a number}} of British colonies {{introduced}} a temporary levy on correspondence {{in order to raise}} funds for expenditure incurred in connection with the war. In mid-August 1916 a notice was issued in Tortola notifying the public that effective 1 September, all letters and parcels posted in the Virgin Islands to places in the British Empire outside the Leeward Islands had to pay additional postage as follows: 1d. on every letter, and 3d. on every parcel. Incoming postal packets containing dutiable goods were also to be charged a “War Surtax” of 3d. before delivery. “Three-penny and penny stamps surcharged WAR STAMP will shortly be on sale for this purpose. Until these are ready ordinary stamps can be used,” the Postmaster’s notice stated. On 1 February 1917 the tax was extended to letters addressed to the U.S.A. Covers or <b>postal</b> <b>receipts</b> documenting proper (non philatelic) use of these stamps are scarce. War tax stamps remained in use as definitives after the war ended.|$|R

5000|$|The {{courthouse}} {{played an}} important role in the development and growth of Medford. In the early 1880s the Oregon and California Railroad, which was setting tracks south from Portland, began making surveys in southern Oregon. By the fall of 1883 trains were running into Grants Pass. Jacksonville, the county seat and the most important town in this portion of the state, was naturally supposed to be the next station on the railroad. The railroad asked Jacksonville for a $25,000 bonus (reportedly to compensate for the difficulties in passing over the Applegate Ridge of mountains), but the city refused. The Oregon and California railroad subsequently rerouted the railroad through the center of the Rogue River Valley where it proceeded to start a new town. Medford was named after the hometown of the railroad engineer, David Loring of Medford, Massachusetts. Land for the town site and railroad purposes was donated to the Railroad by local landowners, C.C. Beekman, C. Mingus, C.W. Brobeck and Ira J. Phipps, and on December 20, 1883, the town was founded. Due to the rail stop in the center of the rich agricultural/orchard producing Rogue River Valley, the town grew rapidly and by 1890 Medford housed 1,791 residents. (The 1990 population of Medford was 49,900, while Jacksonville was 2,005). By 1910, the monthly <b>postal</b> <b>receipts</b> had increased from the initial $2-$3 to over $2,000. On October 2, 1910, the Medford Daily Tribune reported that [...] "No better criterion of city's growth can be named than its postal receipts." [...] That same year congress had appropriated $110,000 for a new U.S. Post Office and Courthouse. The building was to replace the previous temporary postal facilities (three prior locations) and to provide a U.S. District Court presence in a high-quality, non-combustible structure. City residents were so enthused by the prospect of the new structure that many offered potential sites. The chosen lot at the corner of Sixth and Holly, only three blocks from the railroad depot, was chosen. The land, which was donated by Bert and May Anderson and W.C. and Flossie Green, was formally dedicated on March 13, 1911 with a payment of $1.|$|R
40|$|Abstract 	Although {{international}} uniform {{laws and}} rules relating to international sales transactions {{have attempt to}} harmonize differing legal systems through the world, different legal norms still exist, interalia, the time of contract formation has been one the controversial issues between jurisdictions. The application of the <b>postal</b> rule or <b>receipt</b> rule provide interesting legal discourse {{in the case of}} inter-distance business communications. As using electronic comunication means to create international sales contracts has significantly increased, the issue may be highly controversial. The purpose of this thesis is to analyze the formation of contract concluded by electronic communication. Because technology is in constant evolution and the possibility of electronic communication in our days are far from the ones that could developed tomorrow, law faces permanent challange to adapt itself to these changes. In addition to regulate this new way of doing business the rules must find a just balance between protecting users and ensuring the necessary freedom for this kind of new business.

5000|$|Terrorist attacks such {{as those}} {{executed}} by al-Qaeda on New York City and Washington, D.C. on September 11, 2001 and in London on July 7, 2005 have prompted fears that extremist groups might use radioactive dirty bombs in further attacks in the United States and elsewhere.In March 2007, undercover investigators from the Government Accountability Office set up a false company and obtained a license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission {{that would have allowed}} them to buy the radioactive materials needed for a dirty bomb. According to the GAO report, NRC officials did not visit the company or attempt to personally interview its executives. Instead, within 28 days, the NRC mailed the license to the West Virginia <b>postal</b> box. Upon <b>receipt</b> of the license, GAO officials were able to easily modify its stipulations, and remove a limit on the amount of radioactive material they could buy. A spokesman for the NRC said that the agency considered the radioactive devices a [...] "lower-level threat"; a bomb built with the materials could have contaminated an area about the length of a city block, but would not have presented an immediate health hazard.|$|R
40|$|The Contracts Act 1950 (Malaysia) {{is an old}} statute which {{basically}} provides postal rule to govern {{the formation of a}} contact made by sending letters through post office. It is silent about the emerging new issues on the Internet contracts. When technology advances the law lags behind. So, the old laws are usually modified to adapt to the new environment. At present time electronic commerce is expanding very rapidly everywhere on the globe including Malaysia. Millions of customers are buying goods and services on the Internet. As a result volumes of contracts are made on the Internet. Some of the disputes which are now arising out of the online contracts are new and the existing contract laws in Malaysia are unable to solve those problems, such as the validity of using data message to form a contract, the requirement of writing and signature on paper for certain contracts, time of dispatch and receipt of data message, time when an electronic acceptance is effective, whether <b>postal</b> rule or <b>receipt</b> rule will be applicable on the Internet contract and so forth.

40|$|The Dust Bowl of the 1930 s {{provides}} an excellent case study of American reactions to a major ecological crisis. By examining carefully how {{the nation and the}} region responded to this phenomenon, we could learn valuable lessons to aid in understanding current and future ecological crises. Thus it is of more than antiquarian interest to evaluate these two recent books on the Dust Bowl and the associated events now almost half a century behind us. Although both authors examine the same area, events, and personalities, their treatment and conclusions are decidedly different. Both focus on the southern plains and devote chapters to description of the landforms, weather, and climate. Both agree that the hardest-hit areas, the heart of the Dust Bowl, included such places as Baca County, Colorado, Morton County, Kansas, and Cimarron County in the Oklahoma Panhandle. Both discuss the early settlement of the southern plains and the droughts there in the 1890 s and 1930 s; the Great Depression and the planning and programs of the New Deal; major dust storms; dust pneumonia; how the Dust Bowl got its name; and Black Sunday, April 14, 1934, which anyone living in the area at that time remembers, as later generations remember what they were doing {{at the time of the}} New York Blackout or the John F. Kennedy assassination. Both mention personalities indelibly associated with the place and times, such as Woody Guthrie, FDR, Harry Hopkins, Rexford Tugwell, Hugh Hammond Bennett, and Howard H. Finnell. Both attest to the steadfast endurance of the people of the plains. The two books are about the same size and length and both contain many fine photographs of dramatic dust storms, drought effects, and dry-farming practices. That is about as far as the similarities go. Paul Bonnifield, in his forward, asserts that 2 ̆ 2 ultimately the story of the heartland of the dust bowl is the chronicle of hardworking, stouthearted folks who withstood the onslaught of nature at its worst, while living through a devastating depression and facing government idealism. 2 ̆ 2 He regards the outcome as a victory for the plains people, 2 ̆ 2 a victory that helps to feed a hungry world and heat our homes. 2 ̆ 2 Donald Worster, in contrast, argues that both the Depression and the Dust Bowl were products of fundamental weaknesses in the traditional culture of America. The Depression was due to a crisis in capitalism and the Dust Bowl was part of the same crisis, brought about 2 ̆ 2 because the expansionary energy of the United States had finally encountered a volatile, marginal land, destroying the delicate ecological balance that had evolved there. 2 ̆ 2 Worster does not regard the outcome as a victory. Despite its high standard of living and great productivity in good years, the plains still retain the old economic uncertainties of business farming and, in recent dust storms, the familiar evidence of ecological maladaption. Worster sums up the agriculture that America offers the world as 2 ̆ 2 producing an incredible bounty in good seasons, using staggering quantities of machines and fossil 2 ̆ 7 fuels to do so, exuding confidence in man 2 ̆ 7 s technological mastery over the earth, running along the thin edge of disaster. 2 ̆ 2 While it would be nice to believe that Bonnifield is correct and Worster wrong, there is no doubt that Worster does a superior job of marshalling his evidence. Bonnifield 2 ̆ 7 s book is based on information gathered in the southern plains, mainly from local newspapers, museums, and libraries, and from interviews with local residents. He recounts a bewildering array of individual dust storms, floods, tornadoes, hailstorms, and invasions by grasshoppers and worms as he skips from place to place, but there is little sense of broader weather patterns or a synthesis of the whole. His tables are not systematic. Wheat yields by counties in southeastern Kansas, 1933 - 39, annual <b>postal</b> <b>receipts</b> at Spearman, Texas, in 1929 and 2 ̆ 730, bank assets at Texhoma, 1930 - 39, and land prices in Morton County, Kansas, 1936 - 39, provide the type of evidence used to generalize for the entire region. Bonnifield does not assess the response to the droughts of the 1950 s and 1970 s...|$|R
