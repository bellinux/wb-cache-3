2500|$|A {{number of}} law professors and {{political}} scientists described the pardon as troubling and unusual. Experts {{also said that}} the pardon sent a <b>permissive</b> <b>signal</b> to people in law enforcement to commit unlawful acts. Legal scholars have offered different views as to the legal ramifications of Trump's pardon. For instance, Harvard University Professor of Constitutional Law Noah Feldman argued that issuing this pardon would be an impeachable offence under the U.S. Constitution, for if Trump [...] "pardoned Arpaio for willfully refusing to follow the Constitution and violating the rights of people inside the U.S.", it would demonstrate contempt for the judiciary, the Constitution and the rule of law. According to Northwestern law professor Martin Redish, Trump's pardon could be challenged in court and lead to limits being imposed on the heretofore unlimited power to pardon, if Trump's pardon is seen as a signal [...] "to government agents that there exists the likelihood of a pardon when they violate a judicial injunction that blocks his policies, he can all too easily circumvent the only effective means of enforcing constitutional restrictions on his behavior".|$|E
2500|$|The {{warning signal}} {{is the most}} unusual of {{the three types of}} British <b>permissive</b> <b>signal.</b> It is, like the shunt-ahead, placed under the signal {{governing}} entry to the section ahead, but its function is very different.

However, it is possible to accept a train under the [...] "Warning Arrangement" [...] if the block section, but not the quarter-mile overlap, is clear. As its name implies, the signalman must stop and caution the driver of the train concerned, and the warning signal simply replaces the signalman's caution where this operation is frequent. Because there is no margin for braking error, the warning arrangement cannot usually be applied to passenger trains: its commonest use is to allow a goods train to run into a section to shunt a siding {{in the middle of that}} section, while a train is still occupying the station ahead.|$|E

50|$|The 5-light {{protected}} <b>permissive</b> <b>signals</b> in the US are the same.|$|R
50|$|Signals {{are divided}} into <b>Permissive</b> and Absolute <b>signals.</b> Absolute signals cannot be passed at Stop without {{permission}} from the signaller or controller, whereas <b>Permissive</b> <b>signals</b> at Stop can be passed after having stopped for a one-minute waiting period. Absolute signals can be identified {{by the fact that}} the two lights are vertically aligned, whereas with <b>Permissive</b> <b>signals</b> they are vertically off-set (staggered on different sides of the post). Dwarf signals are always Absolute.|$|R
25|$|Subsidiary {{signals are}} those which usually control only {{shunting}} moves, {{as opposed to}} train movements. Under this category come <b>permissive</b> <b>signals</b> and shunting signals.|$|R
5000|$|Drivers need to {{be aware}} of which signals are automatic. In current British {{practice}} for example, automatic signals have a white rectangular plate with a black horizontal line across it. In US practice a <b>permissive</b> <b>signal</b> typically is indicated by the presence of a number plate. In the Australian states of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia, as well as New Zealand, a <b>permissive</b> <b>signal</b> has the lower set of lights offset (usually to the right) from the upper lights; in Victoria and New Zealand, an absolute signal displaying a red or white [...] "A" [...] light is also treated as a <b>permissive</b> <b>signal.</b> Some types of signal display separate permissive and absolute stop aspects. In Germany, the rules which apply to the respective signal are indicated by a vertical plate on the signal's post (Mastschild).|$|E
50|$|Permissive {{signals are}} {{indicated}} by a circular 'P' plate offset below the signal head and Absolute by a square 'A' plate directly below the signal head. As with three-position signalling, dwarf (low speed) signals are always absolute. An 'A' plate in New South Wales or Victoria means the signal is automatic {{and therefore a}} <b>Permissive</b> <b>signal,</b> which is again a source of conflicting meaning between the differing signalling systems.|$|E
50|$|A {{block signal}} is a <b>permissive</b> <b>signal,</b> so {{non-blocking}} operation is allowed. A train can continue at a maximum speed of 15 kph mph after stopping {{for one minute}} before a block signal displaying stop. However, due to accidents during non-blocking operation, many operators abandoned it in favor of non-block operation with full attention (閉塞指示運転, heisoku shiji unten). In this system, a train driver must wait until a dispatcher instructs them by radio to proceed.|$|E
40|$|AbstractDuring {{embryonic}} development, organs arise {{along the}} gut tube {{as a series}} of buds in a stereotyped anterior–posterior (A-P) pattern. Using chick-quail chimeras and in vitro tissue recombination, we studied the interactions governing the induction and maintenance of endodermal organ identify focusing on the pancreas. Though several <b>permissive</b> <b>signals</b> in pancreatic development have been previously identified, here we provide evidence that lateral plate mesoderm sends instructive signals to the endoderm, signals that induce expression of the pancreatic genes Pdx 1, p 48, Nkx 6. 1, glucagon, and insulin. Moreover, this instructive signal directs cells to form ectopic insulin-positive islet-like clusters in endoderm that would otherwise form more rostral organs. Once generated, endocrine cells no longer require interaction with mesoderm, but nonendocrine cells continue to require <b>permissive</b> <b>signals</b> from the mesoderm. Stimulation of activin, BMP, or retinoic acid signaling is sufficient to induce Pdx 1 expression in endoderm anterior to the pancreas. Lateral plate mesoderm appears to pattern the endoderm in a posterior-dominant fashion as first noted in the patterning of the neural tube at the same embryonic stage. These findings argue for a central role of the mesoderm in coordinating the A-P pattern of all three primary germ layers...|$|R
5000|$|Modern-day <b>permissive</b> <b>signals</b> {{consist of}} two white lights at 45°, {{normally}} unlit. When lit, {{with the main}} aspect showing red, they instruct the driver to proceed but be prepared to stop short of any obstruction. When unlit, the driver obeys the main signal aspect. They can therefore function either as calling-on or shunt-ahead signals, depending on their location (the Warning Arrangement in colour-light areas, uses the main aspect {{in a similar fashion}} to approach release junction signalling, in this case it is called a Delayed Yellow [...] ).|$|R
2500|$|The {{mechanical}} equivalents {{of these}} shunting signals are found as miniature semaphores (the arms {{are the same}} size as those of <b>permissive</b> <b>signals)</b> and disc varieties (the disc is about 12inches/30cm diameter). The small-arm semaphores are painted {{in the same way as}} a full-size stop signal, while the discs are painted white with a red horizontal band. A small-arm semaphore shows [...] "clear" [...] in the same way as a full-size stop signal, while a disc rotates through 45 degrees or so when pulled off so that the red band is angled. Both display small red or green lights by night.|$|R
5000|$|A {{distinction}} must be {{made between}} absolute signals, which can display a [...] "Stop" [...] (or [...] "Stop and Stay") indication, and permissive signals, which display a [...] "Stop & Proceed" [...] aspect. Furthermore, a <b>permissive</b> <b>signal</b> may be marked as a Grade Signal where a train {{does not need to}} physically stop for a [...] "Stop & Proceed" [...] signal, but only decelerate to a speed slow enough to stop short of any obstructions. Interlocking ('controlled') signals are typically absolute, while automatic signals (i.e., those controlled through track occupancy alone, not by a signalman) are usually permissive.|$|E
50|$|In Canada, fully {{signaled}} lines use CTC, where {{signal indication}} is the authority for movement. This system is supervised by a Rail Traffic Controller (RTC) {{who is in}} constant communication with the trains and engines on his territory. The RTC {{has the ability to}} line routes and give <b>permissive</b> <b>signal</b> requests to the system in the field from a central location. The RTC can also issue special permissions to trains via radio. In order to pass signals set at stop (Rule 564), reverse direction within a block (Rule 577) or enter the main line at a manual switch not equipped with a signal (Rule 568), the train crew must copy the RTC's instructions and repeat them back correctly before being allowed to proceed.|$|E
5000|$|Radical fringe (RFNG) is a {{signaling}} enzyme {{involved in}} {{the arrangement of the}} embryonic limb buds. It {{is a member of the}} fringe gene family, which also includes manic fringe and lunatic fringe. It is important for the dorsoventrally patterning of the limb and has been implicated in the formation of the apical ectodermal ridge (AER). The AER is essential for the distal patterning of the limb. Experiments executed in chicken models show Radical fringe is expressed in both the dorsal ectoderm and the AER. This provides evidence that the AER forms from cells already expressing radical fringe, though further evidence is needed to confirm. Grafting experiments have shown that formation of the AER comes from signals in the limb bud mesoderm. However, radical fringe acts as a <b>permissive</b> <b>signal</b> to create a boundary for the AER to form. The knockout experiments done in chicken models suggest Radical fringe plays an integral role in wing development.|$|E
2500|$|Although British railway {{operation}} is {{based solely on}} the absolute block principle, there are certain situations in which <b>permissive</b> <b>signals</b> are used to govern certain movements. There are three types of permissive semaphore in Britain: calling-on, shunt-ahead, and warning signals. Today, all three look broadly the same; they are shaped like a normal stop signal, though only about two-thirds of the size, and are painted red with a white horizontal band running centrally along them. When [...] "on", they show a small red or white light, and when [...] "off", they display a small green light and an illuminated 'C', 'S' or 'W', depending on their function.|$|R

50|$|EpoR's role in lineage {{commitment}} is currently unclear. EpoR expression can extend {{as far back}} as the hematopoietic stem cell compartment. It is unknown whether EpoR signaling plays a permissive (i.e. induces only survival) or an instructive (i.e. upregulates erythroid markers to lock progenitors to a predetermined differentiation path) role in early, multipotent progenitors in order to produce sufficient erythroblast numbers. Current publications in the field suggest that it is primarily permissive. The generation of BFU-e and CFU-e progenitors was shown to be normal in rodent embryos knocked out for either Epo or EpoR. An argument against such lack of requirement is that in response to Epo or hypoxic stress, the number of early erythroid stages, the BFU-e and CFU-e, increases dramatically. However, it is unclear if it is an instructive signal or, again, a <b>permissive</b> <b>signal.</b> One additional point is that signaling pathways activated by the EpoR are common to many other receptors; replacing EpoR with prolactin receptor supports erythroid survival and differentiation in vitro. Together, these data suggest that commitment to erythroid lineage likely does not happen due to EpoR's as-yet-unknown instructive function, but possibly due to its role in survival at the multipotent progenitor stages.|$|E

5000|$|Another {{distinction}} is between intersections that have dedicated signals for turning across {{the flow of}} opposing traffic {{and those that do}} not. Such signals are called dedicated left-turn lights in the United States and Canada (since opposing traffic is on the left). With dedicated left turn signals, a left-pointing arrow turns green when traffic may turn left without opposing traffic and pedestrian conflict, and turns red or disappears otherwise. Such a signal is referred to as a [...] "protected" [...] signal if it has its own red phase; a [...] "permissive" [...] signal does not have such a feature. Three standard versions of the <b>permissive</b> <b>signal</b> exist: One version is a horizontal bar with five lights - the green and yellow arrows are located between the standard green and yellow lights. A vertical five-light bar holds the arrows underneath the standard green light (in this arrangement, the yellow arrow is sometimes omitted, leaving only the green arrow below the solid green light, or possibly an LED based device capable of showing both green and yellow arrows within a single lamp housing). Some newer LED turn arrows seen in parts of Canada are capable of multicoloured animation. Such lights will often display a flashing and animated green or yellow arrow when the dedicated turn is allowed, but then transform into a red arrow on a white background with a red line through it, emphasising that the turn is no longer allowed. These lights will also often have the words [...] "no turn" [...] displayed, or an explanatory reason why the turn is not allowed, such as [...] "train" [...] {{in the case of a}} rail or light rail crossing. A third type is known as a [...] "doghouse" [...] or [...] "cluster head" [...] - a vertical column with the two normal lights is on the right side of the signal, a vertical column with the two arrows is located on the left, and the normal red signal is in the middle above the two columns. Cluster signals in Australia and New Zealand use six signals, the sixth being a red arrow that can operate separately from the standard red light. In a fourth type, sometimes seen at intersections in Ontario and Quebec, Canada, there is no dedicated left-turn lamp per se. Instead, the normal green lamp flashes rapidly, indicating permission to go straight as well as make a left turn in front of opposing traffic, which is being held by a steady red lamp. (This [...] "advance green," [...] or flashing green can be somewhat startling and confusing to drivers not familiar with this system. This also can cause confusion amongst visitors to British Columbia, where a flashing green signal denotes a pedestrian controlled crosswalk.) Another interesting practice seen at least in Ontario is that cars wishing to turn left that arrived after the left turn signal ended can do so during the yellow phase, as long as there is enough time to make a safe turn.|$|E
2500|$|The {{system is}} old, and some {{replacement}} parts must be custom {{built for the}} MTA, as {{they are no longer}} available from signaling suppliers. The old signals break down more easily, since some signals have outlasted their 50-year service life by up to 30 years, and signal problems accounted for 13% of all subway delays in 2016. Additionally, some subway services have reached their train capacity limits and cannot operate extra trains with the current Automatic Block Signaling system. Changes in assumptions about train performance, and changes in operational rules also had notable impact on system throughput, such as the prohibition of movement of trains past <b>permissive</b> <b>signals</b> at restricted speed (No Key-By without permission from Control Center.) ...|$|R

40|$|Precise {{control of}} somatic stem cell {{proliferation}} {{is crucial to}} ensure maintenance of tissue homeostasis in high-turnover tissues. In Drosophila, intestinal stem cells (ISCs) are essential for homeostatic turnover of the intestinal epithelium and ensure epithelial regeneration after tissue damage. To accommodate these functions, ISC proliferation is regulated dynamically by various growth factors and stress signaling pathways. How these signals are integrated is poorly understood. Here, we show that EGF receptor signaling is required to maintain the proliferative capacity of ISCs. The EGF ligand Vein is expressed in the muscle surrounding the intestinal epithelium, providing a <b>permissive</b> <b>signal</b> for ISC proliferation. We find that the AP- 1 transcription factor FOS serves as a convergence point for this signal and for the Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway, which promotes ISC proliferation in response to stress. Our results {{support the notion that}} the visceral muscle serves as a functional ‘niche’ for ISCs, and identify FOS as a central integrator of a niche-derived <b>permissive</b> <b>signal</b> with stress-induced instructive signals, adjusting ISC proliferation to environmental conditions...|$|E

Gfi 1 -deficient progenitor B cells show global defects in IL 7 Ra-dependent signal cascades. Consequently, IL 7 -dependent trophic, proliferative and differentiation-inducing responses of progenitor B cells are perturbed. Gfi 1 directly regulates expression levels of IL 7 Ra and indirectly controls STAT 5 signalling via expression of SOCS 3.

40|$|International audiencePuberty onset is {{initiated}} {{in the brain}} by activating gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurosecretion. Different <b>permissive</b> <b>signals</b> must be integrated for the initiation of reproductive maturation, however the neural circuits controlling timely awakening of the reproductive axis are not understood. The identification of the neuropeptide kisspeptin as a potent activator of GnRH neuronal activity suggests that kisspeptin-releasing neurons might coordinate puberty onset. To test this hypothesis we generated mice specifically lacking kisspeptin cells. Unexpectedly, puberty onset in females was unaffected by kisspeptin neuron ablation. Furthermore, the animals were fertile, albeit had smaller ovaries. Consistent with this, female mice lacking neurons that express the kisspeptin receptor GPR 54 were also fertile. Acute ablation of kisspeptin neurons in adult animals inhibited fertility suggesting compensation {{for the loss of}} kisspeptin neurons early during development.

40|$|Abstract: Integrins are {{important}} signal transduc-ers for virtually all neutrophil functions. Although {{a variety of}} signals ultimately result in integrin activa-tion, the intracellular targets of integrin-initiated signals are poorly delineated to date. Polymorpho-nuclear (PMN) leukocyte responses to inflamma-tion are dependent on both the stimulants and the extracellular environment encountered. Integrin ligation, by cell-cell or cell-matrix interactions, activates a variety of signaling cascades. These events dictate the nature of PMN responses to the encountered stimulus. The complex system of effec-tor molecule recruitment and <b>permissive</b> <b>signaling</b> by integrins serves to strictly regulate PMN func-tions such as cell adhesion, motility, oxidant produc-tion, and protein synthesis. Moreover, {{there is evidence that}} cross-talk between integrins exists to prime integrin populations for subsequent function-ing.

40|$|Leptin, a newly-discovered {{hormonal}} {{product of}} the obese (ob) gene, is expressed by adipocytes and thought {{to play a role}} in the regulation of food intake and metabolism. We tested the hypothesis that leptin signals metabolic information to the reproductive system by examining its effects on the reproductive system of ob/ob mice, which have a congenital deficiency in leptin and are infertile. We treated pair-fed males and females with leptin (50 microg twice daily, ip) or vehicle (n= 10 /group) for 14 days, after which the animals were bled and killed. Leptin-treated females had significantly elevated serum levels of LH, increased ovarian and uterine weights, and stimulated aspects of ovarian and uterine histology compared to controls. Leptin-treated males had significantly elevated serum levels of FSH, increased testicular and seminal vesicle weights, greater seminal vesicle epithelial cell height, and elevated sperm counts compared to controls. These results demonstrate that leptin stimulates the reproductive endocrine system in both sexes of ob/ob mice and suggest that leptin may serve as a <b>permissive</b> <b>signal</b> to the reproductive system of normal animals. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{vertebrate}} {{pituitary gland}} {{is a key}} endocrine control organ that contains six distinct hormone secreting cell types. In this study, we analyzed the role of direct cell-to-cell Delta–Notch signaling in zebrafish anterior pituitary cell type specification. We demonstrate that initial formation of the anterior pituitary placode is independent of Notch signaling. Later however, loss of Notch signaling in mind bomb (mib) mutant embryos or by DAPT treatment leads to increased numbers of lactotropes and loss of corticotropes in the anterior pars distalis (APD), increased number of thyrotropes and loss of somatotrope cell types in the posterior pars distalis (PPD), and fewer melanotropes in the posterior region of the adenohypophysis, the pars intermedia (PI). Conversely, Notch gain of function leads to the opposite result, loss of lactotrope and thyrotrope cell specification, and an increased number of corticotropes, melanotropes, and gonadotropes in the pituitary. Our results suggest that Notch acts on placodal cells, presumably as a <b>permissive</b> <b>signal,</b> to regulate progenitor cell specification to hormone secreting cell types. We propose that Notch mediated lateral inhibition regulates the relative numbers of specified hormone cell types in the three pituitary subdomains...|$|E

40|$|Stem cells {{derived from}} the dental pulp of {{extracted}} human third molars (DPSCs) {{have the potential to}} differentiate into odontoblasts, osteoblasts, adipocytes, and neural cells when provided with the appropriate conditions. To advance the use of DPSCs for dentin regeneration, it is important to replicate the <b>permissive</b> <b>signals</b> that drive terminal events in odontoblast differentiation during tooth development. Such a strategy is likely to restore a dentin matrix that more resembles the tubular nature of primary dentin. Due to the limitations of culture conditions, the use of ex vivo gene therapy to drive the terminal differentiation of mineralizing cells holds considerable promise. In these studies, we asked whether the forced expression of TWIST 1 in DPSCs could alter the potential of these cells to differentiate into odontoblast-like cells. Since the partnership between Runx 2 and Twist 1 proteins is known to control the onset of osteoblast terminal differentiation, we hypothesized that these genes act to control lineage determination of DPSCs. For the first time, our results showed that Twist 1 overexpression in DPSCs enhanced the expression of DSPP, a gene that marks odontoblast terminal differentiation. Furthermore, co-transfection assays showed that Twist 1 stimulates Dspp promoter activity by antagonizing Runx 2 function in 293 FT cells. Analysis of our in vitro data, taken together, suggests that lineage specification of DPSCs can be modulated through ex vivo gene modifications...|$|R
40|$|The use {{of adult}} hepatic stem cells for the {{treatment}} of diabetes, based both on the close embryological association of the pancreas and liver, and on a putative shared tissue stem cell, has been proposed by a number of studies. This study investigated the capacity of hepatic oval cells to differentiate into pancreatic endocrine cells in the presence of pancreatic mesoderm. The GaIN model of hepatic injury was used to induce oval cell activation in Male Sprague-Dawley rats. A viable and significant oval cell population could not however, be isolated and propagated in culture. In order to continue experimentation, a PHeSC-A 2 cell line, derived from normal adult porcine liver, was cultured with quail pancreatic mesoderm in the GFRM-Ham s F 12. ITS culture system. Cells demonstrating positive immulocalization of the pancreatic markers, insulin and glucagon, were identified as PHeSC-A 2 -derived, by visual assessment of their nuclear morphology. Techniques used to confirm these results and preclude the derivation of the pancreatic endocrine cells from pancreatic endodermal contamination, proved ineffectual. The tentative results obtained in this study have lead to the following postulations: firstly, the PHeSC-A 2 cell line may possess a higher level of potentiality than previously demonstrated; secondly, this potential {{may be due to the}} shared embryological origins of the pancreas and liver, and thirdly, <b>permissive</b> <b>signaling</b> from pancreatic mesoderm may have the capacity to induce the differentiation of hepatic oval cells into pancreatic endocrine cells.
