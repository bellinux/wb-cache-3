The pit was filled with a {{white-hot}} mass shooting out little tongues of white flame, and throwing out a heat beside which the scorching sun was a pleasant relief. A number of men were engaged, with long poles to which a loop of thick vine had been attached, in noosing the pieces of unburnt wood by twisting the pole, like a horse's twitch, until the loop was tight, and dragging the log out by main force. When the wood was all out there remained a conical pile of glowing stones {{in the middle of the}} pit. Ten men now drove the butts of green saplings into the base of the pile, and held the upper end while a stout vine was passed behind the row of saplings. A dozen men grasped each end of the vine, and with loud shouts hauled with all their might. The saplings, like the teeth of an enormous rake, tore through the pile of stones, flattening them out towards the opposite edge of the pit. The saplings were then driven in on the other side and the stones raked in the opposite direction, then sideways, until the bottom of the pit was covered with an even layer of hot stones. This process had taken fully half an hour, but any doubt as to the heat of the stones at the end was set at rest by the tongues of flame that played continually among them. The cameras were hard at work, and a large crowd of people pressed inwards towards the pit as the moment drew near. They were all excited except Jonathan, who preserved, even in the supreme moment, the air of holy calm that never leaves his face. All eyes are fixed expectant on the dense bush behind the clearing, whence the Shadrachs, Meshachs and Abednegos of the Pacific are to emerge. There is a cry of [...] "Vutu! Vutu!" [...] and forth from the bush, two and two, march fifteen men, dressed in garlands and fringes. They tramp straight to the brink of the pit. The leading pair show something like fear in their faces, but do not pause, perhaps because the rest would force them to move forward. They step down upon the stones and continue their march round the <b>pit,</b> <b>planting</b> their feet squarely and firmly on each stone. The cameras snap, the crowd surges forward, the bystanders fling in great bundles of green leaves. But the bundles strike the last man of the procession and cut him off from his fellows; so he stays where he is, trampling down the leaves as they are thrown to line the pit, in a dense cloud of steam from the boiling sap. The rest leap back to his assistance, shouting and trampling, and the pit turns into the mouth of an Inferno, filled with dusky frenzied fiends, half seen through the dense volume that rolls up to heaven and darkens the sunlight. After the leaves, palm-leaf baskets of the dracaena root are flung to them, more leaves, and then bystanders and every one join in shovelling earth over all till the pit is gone, and a smoking mound of fresh earth takes its place. This will keep hot for four days, and then the masawe will be cooked.|$|E
40|$|The {{constant}} increasing {{of eucalyptus}} forest areas in Brazil requires an accurate monitoring of water erosion. The present study aimed to evaluate soil, nutrients and organic carbon losses occasioned by water erosion in eucalyptus planted forests (EPF) at different development stages (2, 3 and 7 years old). Soil erosion sediments were measured and sampled from standard erosion plots installed on Red Argisol-RA (Ultisol) and Haplic Cambisol-HC (Inceptisol). Soil loss decreased as {{the age of}} plants increased; {{at the beginning of}} plant development, the canopy barely covered the soil surface, exposing the soil to higher erosion at young EPF plantations. Furrow planting system was used in the Red Argisol area and caused higher soil losses (1. 1 to 6. 2 Mg ha- 1 year- 1) as compared to <b>pit</b> <b>planting</b> system that was used in the Cambisol area (1. 1 Mg ha- 1 year- 1). It is known that Cambisol is less resistant to erosion than Argisol. However, using pit system in this EPF, resulted in lower erosion and, therefore, nutrients and carbon losses than the traditional furrow system used in Argisol. Concerning the soil loss, this work points to the need of improving soil conservation practices to prevent soil erosion at the earlier stages of eucalyptus plantation. The amount of calcium and potassium were higher than magnesium in the soil sediment. The relatively high amount of carbon found in the erosion sediments raises additional concerns about the environmental sustainability and deserves future research. 201...|$|E

This research program includes {{a series of studies}} undertaken in response to a request by the Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation and Water Development to look closely at the state of extension services provision with the intent to further strengthen the contribution of these services to food security, economic growth, and the achievement of sustainable development goals. In this paper, we assess the flow of technical advice along the knowledge chain from scientists to farmers to identify the challenges in information provision. The advancement of social network literature has fostered the lead or contact farmer modality or farmer-to-farmer approach of information transmission. However, there is limited evidence regarding the information efficiency of this modality, and the reasons of the potential information loss. In this article, we assess information efficiency along the knowledge transmission chain from researchers to agricultural extension agents (EAs) to lead farmers (LFs) to other farmers. By asking the same set of questions about a fairly well known technology, <b>pit</b> <b>planting,</b> we construct a measure of knowledge at each node of the knowledge transmission chain. Descriptive evidence shows that the majority of information loss happens at the EA-to-LF link, and that the loss is potentially caused by limited attention of both EAs and LFs to all important details of the technology. With more evidence about the importance of knowledge for technology adoption, we suggest that EAs emphasize all crucial dimensions of an agricultural technique during demonstrations and visits in order to reduce information loss.

40|$|Cue: When rain only {{falls for}} a few months each year, it is very tempting for farming {{families}} to try to store some of that rainfall for use during the dry months. Water storage tanks, both above ground and under ground, are one answer. Some collect water from roof tops, while others collect run off from the ground. Man made ponds, sometimes called charco dams, are another option. Depending on the soil type these may need to be lined with a plastic sheet, to prevent the water being lost. But how affordable are these technologies for smallholder farmers? Can they afford to build them individually or is it best to work as a group? And what technical support will farmers need to build them? In general these structures are a more expensive system of rainwater harvesting, and most farmers will need some technical help in building them, or else they may quickly crack and leak and become useless. Simon Mkwinda is the Chief Land Resources Conservation Officer in the Malawian Department of Land Resources. He spoke to Excello Zidana about how families can use tanks and ponds to harvest rainwater, and began by explaining that {{there are two types of}} water storage tanks. IN:		?Basically there are two types of tanks ?? OUT:		??change the materials to make them low cost. ? DUR?N:	 7 ? 48 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Simon Mkwinda of the Department of Land Resources in Malawi, explaining that structures for storing rainwater, such as tanks and ponds, do not have to be very expensive. The interview comes from a radio resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Mkwinda	Basically there are two types of tanks. The first one is what we call ?above ground tanks?. They are constructed of course using different materials but mostly bricks with cement. And in most cases we advocate construction of this type of tank for domestic uses. Then the second type is what we call ?underground water tanks?. This involves digging a pit in different shapes, but in most cases we advocate what they call hemispherical shape because these are proved to be strong enough to store large quantities of water. Now in terms of catchments that we use for collecting water from on the ground, mostly they could be rock outcrops or even any cultivated area where it is a source of runoff. Now instead of this runoff just flowing uncontrolled on the ground, we advocate that the runoff should be channelled to these tanks to store the water for usage later on. But by doing so, the construction of these tanks, it means they are assisting in reducing the amount of runoff that would otherwise would be flowing on the ground uncontrolled thereby causing erosion, soil erosion. So by constructing these tanks in a way we are also trying to help in controlling soil erosion which is rampant in the country. Zidana	How would you look at the materials used for constructing tanks. You talked of cement. Is it feasible for a local farmer to construct these things? Mkwinda	Yes at face value you may say these technologies are expensive and farmers may not be able to afford. But there are different methods of constructing these structures. For example if you are talking of an underground tank, depending on the condition of the soils you are dealing with, instead of using materials like cement and bricks or reinforcement wires, chicken wires and the like, you may do just with a plastic sheet. Because the idea is to keep water and you want to prevent seepage of water that has collected in the tank. At the same time, some of the rooftops you may construct using iron sheets. Iron sheets are very expensive. But then you can modify that. You can just provide a plastic sheet or even just grass. Because the idea is that you want to reduce evaporation of that water that you have stored in that tank. So there are those modifications which can make the whole thing cheaper and manageable by smallholder farmers. But most important of all, let?s not look at rainwater harvesting single-handedly, or in isolation. We have to empower farming communities with other initiatives that would assist them in generating income, so that some of these technologies they can adopt them quite easily. For example, World vision in Chingale. They are integrating in their programme issues that would bring a lot of income to the communities, like getting them involved in seed multiplication. The income they get from the seed multiplication programme is enabling the communities to source some of the materials on their own, as individuals or groups. Zidana	What do you encourage farmers to do when they are thinking of constructing or having ponds? Mkwinda	Pond construction is another technology that we are promoting among smallholder farmers, and you construct it in a strategic place, particularly near low-lying areas. The idea being that once you dig out a pond you should be able to let water, run off, to settle in that one, and the farmers should be able to utilise that water for different uses. If it is in low land it would be more ideal for irrigation, it may be ideal for fish farming. But then like I said, it depends on the conditions of the area where you are constructing these ponds. Sometimes it may be necessary for you to line the pond with plastic sheets to reduce seepage of the water. Zidana		Do you see this technology to be good for farmers or worth promoting? Mkwinda	It is worthwhile to promote it. In Malawi we have adequate rain for a limited number of months in a year, or in a season. We are talking of maybe at most 4 months of receiving rain. The other months are dry months. If we don?t develop a culture of storing the water we receive in that short period, then year after year we will be crying that we are unable to do A, B, C, D, because we don?t have water. This technology is coming into fill that gap. Let farmers harvest the rainwater as much as we can so that the stored water can be utilised for different purposes, domestic, livestock watering, irrigation, you name it. But then I should also mention that, yes, in our discussion here we have just looked at the structures. Those are the ones that we normally say are very expensive, because they require farmers to spend a lot of money. But there are other technologies we call in situ rainwater harvesting technologies which can be done right in the field, which are low cost, very simple, farmers can do them on their own, of course with guidance from extension workers. Zidana		Can you cite some examples? Mkwinda	Examples of these include <b>pit</b> <b>planting,</b> where you dig pits in the field, then you apply manure in those pits. The idea being after the rains have fallen most of the rains collect in those pits, and then you come and plant your crop in those pits. In this way you are assisting the crop to grow up so well because you have stored water in those pits. Another example is what we call swales. Swales are nothing other than small trenches that you dig on a contour in a field at a pre-determined interval. The idea is instead of runoff just flowing overland you store the runoff in those trenches, with the idea of recharging the soil profile, so that whatever crop you grow in that field should not suffer from moisture stress, especially in periods of dry spell. There are so many other technologies like water infiltration pits, rainwater harvesting from roadsides, whereby instead of just losing the water into drains, you channel the water into a field where you can grow a crop. Those are some of the techniques which are low cost, which we are already promoting. But like I said earlier, even the structures, you can try to modify them to suit the socio-economic status of the communities that you are dealing with, by modifying their design. You can change the materials to make them low cost. End of track. Ponds and underground water tanks can store large quantities of water for domestic or agricultural purposes...|$|E

The zai pits for concentration of in-field runoff, which originating in Burkina Faso have been practiced for centuries among smallholder farmers in West Africa (Reij et al. 1988). In a study in Niger, Olaleye et al. (2006) reported higher yields on zai treatments compared to flat planting and this was attributed to a build-up in the soil organic matter contents which may have increased the soil water holding capacity in the zai treatments. In Kenya, the zai technique utilizes shallow, wide pits that are about 30  cm in diameter and 15 – 20  cm in depth, in which four to eight seeds of a cereal crop are planted. In the Njombe district of southern Tanzania, the pits are made bigger and deeper (at least 0.6  m deep), and a 20 liter volume of manure is added and farmers plant about 15 to 20 seeds of maize per pit (Mati 2005).|$|R

40|$|The IFAD-funded {{soil and}} water {{conservation}} project in Niger`s Illela District is a model for the restoration of degraded and abandoned land, based on simple and replicable methods which are implemented by the local people. The project started in 1988 with deliberately modest targets. In 1989 a group of local farmers made an exchange visit to the Central Plateau of Burkina Faso. They recognized that the traditional <b>planting</b> <b>pits</b> (zay), which are used in the Yatenga to rehabilitate degraded land, resemble the (tassa) <b>planting</b> <b>pits</b> used in their region. But their tassa were smaller and they did not fill them with organic matter. Upon return 3 hectares of degraded land were treated with improved tassa. In 1990 this rose to 70 ha, in 1991 to 450 - 500 ha and in 1992 to about 1, 000 ha. The rehabilitation of barren, degraded land using improved traditional <b>planting</b> <b>pits</b> is a profitable activity. The costs of pitting one hectare, using hired labour, is about US$ 40 If a yield of 500 kg of millet/ha is obtained (compared to 0 kg in the 'without' situation), the value of the crop is about US$ 160. This partly explains the rapid adoption of the technique by the fanners in this region. Another explanation is that successful rehabillation of degraded land allows the expansion of the resource base for the growing population. Even if the IFAD funded {{soil and water}} conservation project in Niger stopped its activities today, farmers would continue digging improved traditional <b>planting</b> <b>pits.</b> A growing number of farmers from other parts of Niger come to Illela District to see for themselves what is happening and it is quite likely that these techniques will soon be transferred to other semi-arid regions characterised by high population densities, extreme degradation and a considerable pressure on available land resources.

50|$|Plant macrofossils are {{preserved}} through four main modes of preservation at archaeological sites. First, plant remains, usually cereal grains, chaff, seeds and charcoal are largely reduced to elemental carbon (charred) {{when they are}} heated in a reducing atmosphere. These {{are referred to as}} 'charred' or 'carbonised' plant remains. This mode of preservation is biased towards plant remains that come into contact with fire, through cooking or fuel use, and those which are less fragile, such as cereal grains and nutshell. Second, plant remains deposited in permanently waterlogged anoxic conditions {{are preserved}} as the absence of oxygen prohibits microbial activity. This mode of preservation occurs in deep archaeological features such as wells, in urban settlements where organic refuse is rapidly deposited, and at settlements adjacent to lakes or rivers. A wide range of plant remains are usually preserved, including seeds, fruit stones, nutshells, leaves, straw and other vegetative material. Third, calcium-phosphate mineralisation of plant remains occurs usually in latrine pits and in middens, as plant remains are completely replaced by calcium-phosphate. In latrine <b>pits,</b> <b>plant</b> remains which have been consumed by humans are the most common items, such as seeds of flavourings, fruit pips and fruit stones. Finally, plant remains are preserved by desiccation in arid environments, where the absence of water limits decomposition. Delicate vegetative plant remains are preserved, such as onion skin and artichoke bracts, alongside fruit stones, cereal chaff and seeds of wild plants.|$|R

Thus, {{the objective of the}} study was to assess soil moisture and maize yield improvement of combining infiltration and <b>planting</b> <b>pits.</b> Field experiments were conducted in Rushinga, Zimbabwe for three seasons at three sites using a split-plot design: main-plot factor, field-edge rainwater management method (RWMM); and split-plot factor, tillage method. Soil moisture content was measured weekly using gravimetric and Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) methods. A household and field survey to establish farmers’ perceptions, typology and availability of field-edge RWMM was conducted. In order to share experiences and enhance stakeholders’ learning, field days were held. Lateral movement of soil water was measured up to 2 m downslope from infiltration pits, hence infiltration pits did not improve maize yield and soil moisture content in the cropping area. Maize yield (kg ha- 1) was 45 % higher under conventional tillage (2697) than <b>planting</b> <b>pits</b> (1852) but the yield gap decreased from 90 to 30 % in the first and third year respectively. The value of infiltration pits is in reducing soil erosion by water and growing high value horticultural crops inside and close to pits, a view shared by host farmers and other stakeholders. <b>Planting</b> <b>pits</b> are an option for farmers without access to draught power and a fall-back method. Research is required to determine soil moisture, maize yield benefits and waterlogging risk in fields with underlying impermeable layers that enhance lateral flow of water...|$|R
