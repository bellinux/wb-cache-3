50|$|High <b>salt</b> <b>marsh</b> dieback, or <b>salt</b> <b>marsh</b> browning, is {{the primary}} force in <b>salt</b> <b>marsh</b> {{degradation}} in the high marsh. The general effect is that the plants in the marsh die off and brown, leaving dead organic matter, and ultimately open sediment. Without strong plant roots holding the sediment, these open areas of land erode, causing the <b>salt</b> <b>marsh</b> to retreat back to the mainland.

For Europe and North America there is a plethora of plant geographical and ecological work on <b>salt</b> <b>marsh.</b> The marshes of Australia are less well known apart from the Sydney region.

40|$|<b>Salt</b> <b>marshes</b> {{are widely}} {{distributed}} and most productive ecosystems in the temperate zones on the globe. These areas perform vital ecological functions and are populated mainly by halophytes—plants that {{are able to}} survive and reproduce in environments with exceptionally high salt concentrations. In <b>salt</b> <b>marshes,</b> in addition to tolerating high <b>salt</b> concentrations, <b>salt</b> <b>marsh</b> halophytes have to cope with damages caused by multiple anthropgenic pressures including metal and metalloid pollution. Extensive studies have been performed aiming at exploring naturally occurring endemic <b>salt</b> <b>marsh</b> halophytes with extraordinary potential for metals and metalloids remediation. However, a knowledge gap is perceptible on the basics of <b>salt</b> <b>marsh</b> halophyte adaptation/ tolerance to the joint action of damaging factors such as high concentration of salt and presence of metals–metalloids. In light of available literature, the current paper is critical in: (i) highlighting ecological significance of <b>salt</b> <b>marsh</b> halophytes and their use as bioindicators or biomonitors of metal–metalloid pollution; (ii) analyzing <b>salt</b> <b>marsh</b> halophyte significant contributions for metal- and metalloid-remediation processes; (iii) overviewing <b>salt</b> <b>marsh</b> halophytes–microbes interaction influence on metalphytoremediation processes; and (iv) cross-talking important physiological/ biochemical strategies adopted by <b>salt</b> <b>marsh</b> halophytes for salinity-, metal-, and metalloid-tolerance. Conclusively, the paper highlights important aspects so far less explored in the context of <b>salt</b> <b>marsh</b> halophyte services to metal–metalloid remediation and underlying mechanisms.

40|$|Local scale studies {{reported}} the silica recycling of <b>salt</b> <b>marshes</b> to substantially attenuate the dissolved silica (DSi) limitation in coastal waters during summer.

The resulting annual average contribution of <b>salt</b> <b>marshes</b> to the DSi budget of the North Sea is estimated to 0. 8 % of the annual river DSi export.

40|$|Many {{sea level}} rise {{adaptation}} plans emphasize {{the protection of}} adjacent uplands to allow for inland <b>salt</b> <b>marsh</b> migration, but little empirical information exists on this process. Using aerial photos from 1930 and 2006 of Delaware Estuary coastal habitats in New Jersey, I documented the rate of coastal forest retreat {{and the rate of}} inland <b>salt</b> <b>marsh</b> migration across 101. 1 km of undeveloped <b>salt</b> <b>marsh</b> and forest ecotone. Over this time, the amount of forest edge at this ecotone nearly doubled. In addition, the average amount of forest retreat was 141. 2 m while the amount of <b>salt</b> <b>marsh</b> inland migration was 41. 9 m. Variation in forest retreat within the study area was influenced by variation in slope. The lag between the amount of forest retreat and <b>salt</b> <b>marsh</b> migration is accounted for by the presence of Phragmites australis which occupies the forest and <b>salt</b> <b>marsh</b> ecotone. Phragmites expands from this edge into forest dieback areas, and the ability of <b>salt</b> <b>marsh</b> to move inland and displace Phragmites is likely influenced by salinity at both an estuary-wide scale and at the scale of local subwatersheds. Inland movement of <b>salt</b> <b>marsh</b> is lowest at lower salinity areas further away {{from the mouth of the}} estuary and closer to local heads of tide.

40|$|Concern {{about the}} effects of climate change have set in motion a search for flood {{protection}} measures to adapt coastlines to the foreseen accelerated sea level rise. In this context, the potential role of <b>salt</b> <b>marshes</b> to adapt the Wadden Sea’s flood defences was explored in the Netherlands Wadden Region Delta Programme. This paper provides an overview of the steps taken by the programme in developing a climate change adaptation strategy so that others might learn from its experiences. The second aim is to summarize the knowledge generated by the programme on the potential role of <b>salt</b> <b>marshes</b> as part of a climate change adaption strategy. Explorative modelling results indicate that Wadden Sea <b>salt</b> <b>marshes</b> affect wave heights, even under extreme conditions. Therefore, a salt-marsh zone in front of the Wadden Sea dikes that could keep pace with sea level rise may result in a reduced dike reinforcement task. A <b>salt</b> <b>marsh</b> potential map gives a rough impression of locations that are potentially interesting for <b>salt</b> <b>marsh</b> conservation and development, based on the current situation, on available information about abiotic conditions for <b>salt</b> <b>marsh</b> formation and the habitats present in the coastal zone. Besides elongated stretches were seminatural <b>salt</b> <b>marshes</b> are already present or developing, several stretches along the Dutch Wadden Sea coast have favourable abiotic conditions for <b>salt</b> <b>marsh</b> development.

Indeed, <b>salt</b> <b>marsh</b> sediment bacteria remain largely in a black box in terms of their diversity and functional roles within <b>salt</b> <b>marsh</b> benthic food web pathways.

40|$|There is {{a paucity}} of {{published}} information on fish utilization of <b>salt</b> <b>marshes</b> outside North America. This dissertation represents the first intensive examination of the ichthyofauna associated with <b>salt</b> <b>marshes</b> in southern Africa and examines the species composition, diversity, size structure, distribution and estuarine dependence of fishes that utilize <b>salt</b> <b>marshes</b> in the Kariega Estuary. The research was concentrated on Taylor's <b>salt</b> <b>marsh,</b> with comparative studies being conducted on other <b>salt</b> <b>marshes</b> and habitats within the marine dominated Kariega Estuary. The possible importance of <b>salt</b> <b>marshes</b> as feeding and refuge areas for fishes was examined, as was the role of <b>salt</b> <b>marshes</b> in the food web of the estuary. The fishes frequenting <b>salt</b> <b>marshes</b> in the Kariega Estuary were predominantly the juveniles of marine species, with Mugilidae being the dominant family. The ichthyofauna was distributed primarily in the intertidal creeks with very few specimens captured on the vegetated Spartina maritima and Sarcocomia perennis flats. The different reaches of the intertidal creek were characterised by distinct fish assemblages. The fish assemblages associated with the intertidal <b>salt</b> <b>marsh</b> creeks were significantly different from {{those found in the}} eelgrass beds, the other dominant intertidal habitat in the Kariega Estuary. The eelgrass beds were dominated by estuarine fish species and had a higher density and standing stock of fishes when compared to the <b>salt</b> <b>marsh</b> creeks. The diversity of fishes in the two habitats was however similar. The intertidal <b>salt</b> <b>marsh</b> creek ichthyofauna also differed significantly from that found in the main estuary channel. The creek ichthyofauna was dominated by 0 + juveniles while the main channel had many subadult and adult fishes. The channel habitat also had numerous large piscivorous fishes which were absent from the <b>salt</b> <b>marsh</b> creeks. The low number of piscivorous fishes, together with limited fish predation from other sources, may be the reason why <b>salt</b> <b>marshes</b> provide a refuge for juvenile fishes that frequent these habitats. Unlike previous studies on North American, Australian and European <b>salt</b> <b>marshes,</b> the dominant fish species that frequented Taylor's marsh were not recorded feeding extensively on the marsh, and those that did had a limited distribution. The role of fishes in the transfer of energy off the Kariega <b>salt</b> <b>marshes</b> is therefore likely to be minimal. A stable carbon isotope study on the dominant primary producers and consumers within the Kariega Estuary revealed that detritus originating from the high lying <b>salt</b> <b>marsh</b> plants Sarcocornia perennis and Chenolea diffusa was not utilized by fishes in the Kariega Estuary. Preliminary results indicated that the cord grass Spartina maritima may be an important energy source to the fishes in the Kariega Estuary, but {{further research is needed to}} confirm this...|$|R
40|$|Understanding the {{mechanisms}} limiting and facilitating <b>salt</b> <b>marsh</b> vegetation initial establishment is of widespread importance {{due to the}} many valuable services <b>salt</b> <b>marsh</b> ecosystems offer. <b>Salt</b> <b>marsh</b> dynamics have been investigated by many previous studies, but {{the mechanisms}} that enable or disable <b>salt</b> <b>marsh</b> initial establishment are still understudied. Recently, the “windows of opportunity” (WoO) concept has been proposed as a framework providing {{an explanation for the}} initial establishment of biogeomorphic ecosystems and the role of physical disturbance herein. A WoO is a sufficiently long disturbance-free period following seedling dispersal, which enables successful establishment. By quantifying the occurrence of WoO, vegetation establishment pattern can be predicted. For simplicity sake and as prove of concept, the original WoO framework considers tidal inundation as the only physical disturbance to <b>salt</b> <b>marsh</b> establishment, whereas the known disturbance from tidal currents and wind waves is ignored. In this study, we incorporate hydrodynamic forcing in the WoO framework. Its spatial and temporal variability is considered explicitly in a <b>salt</b> <b>marsh</b> establishment model. We used this model to explain the observed episodic <b>salt</b> <b>marsh</b> recruitment in the Westerschelde Estuary, Netherlands. Our results reveal that this model can significantly increase the spatial prediction accuracy of <b>salt</b> <b>marsh</b> establishment compared to a model that excludes the hydrodynamic disturbance. Using the better performing model, we further illustrate how tidal flat morphology determines <b>salt</b> <b>marsh</b> establishing elevation and width via hydrodynamic force distribution.

We present a combined theoretical and empirical study of complex dynamics in mineralogenic <b>salt</b> <b>marsh</b> ecosystems that emerge from a positive feedback between clay accumulation and plant growth. Positive feedback induces self-organizing within the ecosystem, which buffers for the strong physical gradient that characterizes the marine-terrestrial boundary, and improves plant growth along the gradient.

40|$|The {{population}} of breeding birds on the <b>salt</b> <b>marshes</b> along the Frisian coast (NFB) {{has been studied}} for over more than 20 years. Within this period many factors have changed, affecting both vegetation and bird densities. One {{of these is the}} restoration of <b>salt</b> <b>marsh</b> habitat by managed or 'accidental' realignment of dykes. In this paper we evaluate the development of the breeding bird community on NFB and focus on four different parts that were restored to <b>salt</b> <b>marsh</b> in 2001, 1992 and 1990 and 1975 respectively. Since 1991, 60 species of breeding birds have been recorded on NFB, mostly colonial species and meadow birds. Both on the <b>salt</b> <b>marsh</b> area and in the summer polders (separated from the <b>salt</b> <b>marsh</b> by a low dyke and flooded only during exceptionally high tides), the number of breeding bird species has increased. A crash of colonial species (mainly Black-headed Gull Chroicocephalus ridibundus and Pied Avocet Recurvirostra avosetta) after 2000 is assumed to be mainly driven by increased predation (presumably by Red Foxes Vulpes vulpes). Today, highest densities of breeding birds occur in the summer polders. The de-embanked <b>salt</b> <b>marshes</b> generally show declining densities of primary meadow birds, towards densities that are typical of <b>salt</b> <b>marshes.</b> With the restoration into <b>salt</b> <b>marsh,</b> the risk of inundation of nests and drowning of fledglings has increased, reinforced by an increased frequency of storm surges during the breeding season. Also vegetation has changed, to a large extent in interaction with grazing. Although the confounding effects of ditching, predation, local grazing management and regional food availability are relevant when considering the observed trends, a negative effect of restoration on primary meadow birds was nonetheless detected. The strong decrease of colonial species however is not associated with the restoration of <b>salt</b> <b>marsh</b> habitat and has occurred nearly simultaneously in <b>salt</b> <b>marshes</b> along the neighbouring Groningen coast...|$|R
40|$|The area of <b>salt</b> <b>marshes</b> does {{no longer}} increase. The recent erosion coincides with a rise on MHT-level {{in the last}} 25 years.

The stochastic appearance of gaps in the perennial vegetation cover appeared to be important for the establishment of annuals in the older <b>salt</b> <b>marsh.</b> Conclusion In the case of <b>salt</b> <b>marsh</b> succession, the generally accepted hypothesis of early successional stochasticity dominance versus late successional environmental determinism must be rejected...|$|R

2500|$|Ecosystem {{services}} are {{the benefits that}} humans derive from ecological systems. Today, {{one of the arguments}} for protecting <b>salt</b> <b>marshes</b> is to increase {{the quality and quantity of}} these services. <b>Salt</b> <b>marshes</b> sequester nitrogen, filtering runoff water and reducing nitrogen input to estuaries (Valiela and Cole 2002). <b>Salt</b> <b>marshes</b> also provide essential refuge habitat for young fish and crustaceans, provisioning coastal fisheries (Boesch and Turner 1984) that account for 90% of the world’s fish catch (UNEP 2006). <b>Salt</b> <b>marshes</b> also sequester carbon, which will be an important ecosystem service as climate change intensifies (Chmura et al. 2003). Arguably the most important ecosystem service <b>salt</b> <b>marshes</b> provide is to act as natural sea barriers because grasses bind soils, prevent shoreline erosion, attenuate waves, and reduce coastal flooding (Costanza et al. 2008).|$|R

40|$|Question In {{the past}} decades, the tall native {{invasive}} grass, Elytrigia atherica, {{has been increasing}} in frequency and dominance on <b>salt</b> <b>marshes</b> along the Wadden Sea coast. Is this rapid expansion an outcome of natural succession or is it driven by anthropogenic eutrophication resulting from atmospheric deposition? Location <b>Salt</b> <b>marshes</b> on four back-barrier islands, Wadden Sea {{on the coast of}} the Netherlands and Germany. Methods We used a combination of time series of vegetation maps and chronosequence data of four naturally developed <b>salt</b> <b>marshes</b> to address our questions. These <b>salt</b> <b>marshes</b> have not been grazed by livestock or subject to other management regimes. By comparing development within and between four different <b>salt</b> <b>marshes,</b> we were able to study the spatial and temporal dynamics of the community dominated by E. atherica on natural <b>salt</b> <b>marshes.</b> Results The expansion rate of the E. atherica community was highest on young <b>salt</b> <b>marshes</b> (up to 30 yr old) with vertical accretion rates of 0. 35 cm center dot yr 1. The rate of expansion decreased on older marshes and the direction reversed, becoming negative, on the oldest marshes (around 90 yr old), which have no vertical accretion and are under waterlogged conditions. Conclusions The expansion of E. atherica on natural, back-barrier islands along the Wadden Sea coast is more influenced by the age of the <b>salt</b> <b>marsh</b> and patterns in vertical accretion of soil than by uniformly spread atmospheric deposition. ...|$|R

We installed {{a set of}} 12 experimental <b>salt</b> <b>marsh</b> islands made from metal cages on a tidal flat in the German Wadden Sea to study the assembly of <b>salt</b> <b>marsh</b> communities in a metacommunity context. Experimental plots at the same elevation were established within the adjacent <b>salt</b> <b>marsh</b> {{on the island of}} Spiekeroog. For both, experimental islands and <b>salt</b> <b>marsh</b> enclosed plots, the same three elevational levels were realised while creating bare patches open for colonisation and vegetated patches with a defined transplanted community. One year into the experiment, the bare islands were colonised by plant species with high fecundity although with a lower frequency compared to the <b>salt</b> <b>marsh</b> enclosed bare plots. Initial plant community variations due to species sorting along the inundation gradient were evident in the transplanted vegetation. Competitive exclusion was not observed and is only expected to unfold in the coming years.

50|$|Although land {{reclamation}} {{has been an}} important factor for <b>salt</b> <b>marsh</b> loss in the UK in the past (Allen 1992) the majority of current <b>salt</b> <b>marsh</b> loss in the UK is believed to be due to erosion (Morris et al. 2004). This erosion may involve coastal squeeze, where protective sea walls prevent the landward migration of <b>salt</b> <b>marsh</b> in response to sea level rise when sediment supply is limited (Hulme 2005; Morris et al. 2004). <b>Salt</b> <b>marshes</b> are protected under the EU Habitats Directive as well as providing habitat for a number of species protected by the Birds Directive (see Natura 2000). Following this guidance, the UK’s biodiversity action plan aims to prevent net losses to the area of <b>salt</b> <b>marsh</b> present in 1992. It is therefore a legal requirement that all losses in marsh area must be compensated by replacement habitat with equivalent biological characteristics (Crooks et al. 2001). This equates to the need to restore approximately 1.4 km² of <b>salt</b> <b>marsh</b> habitat per year in the UK.|$|R
25|$|Inundation and {{sediment}} deposition on the marsh surface is also assisted by tidal creeks {{which are a}} common feature of <b>salt</b> <b>marshes.</b> Their typically dendritic and meandering forms provide avenues for the tide to rise and flood the marsh surface, {{as well as to}} drain water, and they may facilitate higher amounts of sediment deposition than <b>salt</b> <b>marsh</b> bordering open ocean. Sediment deposition is correlated with sediment size: coarser sediments will deposit at higher elevations (closer to the creek) than finer sediments (further from the creek). Sediment size is also often correlated with particular trace metals, and can thus tidal creeks can affect metal distributions and concentrations in <b>salt</b> <b>marshes,</b> in turn affecting the biota. <b>Salt</b> <b>marshes</b> do not however require tidal creeks to facilitate sediment flux over their surface although <b>salt</b> <b>marshes</b> with this morphology seem to be rarely studied.|$|R
25|$|A <b>salt</b> <b>marsh</b> or saltmarsh, {{also known}} as a coastal <b>salt</b> <b>marsh</b> or a tidal marsh, is a coastal {{ecosystem}} in the upper coastal intertidal zone between land and open saltwater or brackish water that is regularly flooded by the tides. It is dominated by dense stands of salt-tolerant plants such as herbs, grasses, or low shrubs. These plants are terrestrial in origin and are essential to the stability of the <b>salt</b> <b>marsh</b> in trapping and binding sediments. <b>Salt</b> <b>marshes</b> play a large role in the aquatic food web and the delivery of nutrients to coastal waters.
