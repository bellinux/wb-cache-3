2500|$|Civil {{rights activists}} {{regarded}} {{the construction of}} the arch as a token of racial discrimination. African Americans worked on the arch, and were hired because they were skilled laborers. On July 14, 1964, during the workers' lunchtime, civil rights protesters Percy Green and Richard Daly, both members of Congress of Racial Equality, climbed up 125-feet on the north leg of the arch to [...] "expose the fact that federal funds were being used to build a national monument that was racially discriminating against black contractors and skilled black workers." [...] As the pair disregarded demands to get off, protesters on the ground demanded that at least 10% of the skilled jobs belong to African Americans. Four hours later Green and Daly dismounted from the arch, to charges of [...] "trespassing, peace disturbance, and resisting arrest." [...] This incident inter alia spurred the United States Department of Justice to file the first pattern or <b>practice</b> <b>case</b> against AFL–CIO under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, on February 4, 1966, but the department later called off the charges. The 1966 lawsuit was an attempt by the Office of Federal Contract Compliance (OFCC) to desegregate building-trade unions nationwide. Many technical building unions had little or no African-American representation into the mid-1960s. During Lyndon Johnson's presidency, the federal government recognized the need for more integration in all levels of society and started enforcing equal employment opportunity through federally funded job contracts.|$|E

50|$|In practice, {{however, the}} lack of {{judicial}} review often produces the opposite result. An employer that wants to challenge the Board’s certification of a union in court must engage in what {{is referred to as}} a “technical refusal to bargain” in order to draw an unfair labor practice charge against it under Section 8(a)(5) of the Act. The General Counsel of the NLRB will typically file an unfair labor practice complaint against it for refusing to bargain, at which point the employer can then raise the same objections to the election that it raised earlier as a defense to the unfair labor practice charges against it. While the Board will almost always reject these objections on the ground that they have already been ruled upon, this enables the employer to raise these objections in the appellate court proceedings concerning the Board’s decision in the unfair labor <b>practice</b> <b>case.</b>|$|E

A metadata model named M 4 is used to declaratively define and document both, all steps of such a preprocessing chain and all the data involved. For data and applied operators there is an abstract level, understandable by human users, and an executable level, used by the metadata compiler to run cases for given data sets. An integrated environment allows for rapid development of preprocessing chains.

5000|$|On July 14, 1964, Green and Richard Daly, a white college student, scaled the Gateway Arch {{to protest}} the {{exclusion}} of blacks from federal contracts and jobs related {{to the construction of}} the Arch. [...] Green, Daly, and protesters on the ground demanded that MacDonald Construction Company, the contractor responsible for constructing the Arch, raise the number of African Americans employed on the project to 10% within 10 days. Green and Daly were charged with trespassing and other offenses. [...] Today, a photo of Percy Green hangs inside the Arch in a display commemorating the Arch's history. This incident was one of several that inspired the United States Department of Justice to file the first pattern or <b>practice</b> <b>case</b> against AFL-CIO under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Less than two months after climbing the Arch, Green was laid off by McDonnell Douglas Corporation, where he was employed as a mechanic and laboratory technician. [...] McDonnell Douglas claimed that the layoff was caused by budget constraints, but Green alleged that he was fired because of his race. The case was ultimately decided in Green's favor by the Supreme Court, in a landmark decision that clarified discrimination law by establishing the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework. The fight for equal access to employment opportunities for African Americans characterized much of Green's work with both CORE and ACTION. His activism targeted companies including Wonder Bread, Southwestern Bell, Laclede Gas Company, and Union Electric (now Ameren UE).|$|E
50|$|Another moral theory using a {{universal}} practice test is rule consequentialism, {{or more precisely}} that version of it sometimes called ideal rule consequentialism, where a moral rule is permissible {{if and only if}} its practice by all persons would produce at least as much of a balance of good over bad results than the universal practice of any other rule would. This theory was first suggested as an amendment to more standard form of consequentialism by R.F. Harrod in 1936, on the grounds that some behaviors cause more harm when everyone (or almost everyone) else is doing the same thing than in the more common case where not everyone else is doing so; since the harm can get so very bad in such cases, he argued that we should use its effects in this universal <b>practice</b> <b>case</b> to condemn the same behavior even when almost no one else is doing it, and even when it actually causes little or no harm in such cases. He illustrated this with Kant's example of telling a lie, arguing that the practice of lying by many individual people may actually only be modestly harmful, and sometimes may produce more good in individual cases, as long as enough truth-tellers are still around to provide a moral example and allows us to have some confidence that we will be told the truth (and be believed when we speak) when we would like this; but the effect of even those last few hold-outs for truth-telling switching their behavior so as to also lie is more devastating than that of a few lies told when not everyone else is doing so.|$|E

All four best <b>practice</b> <b>cases</b> had a long notice period and socially responsible coordination of management and employees, which created adjusted corporate strategies. Three cases had the CSR orientation in the earliest stage, while the fourth case had this coordination during a later stage of the closedown process. We develop a model where we show that the scope for action increases if the CSR orientation and coordination of actions come early in the closedown process, due to the increased ability to adjust the business strategy and create a plan for outreach HRM activities and local community activities...|$|R
