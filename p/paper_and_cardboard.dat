Wood is used not only for buildings, boats, and furniture, but also for smaller items such as musical instruments and sports equipment.

25|$|Lambert's book is {{fundamentally}} experimental. The forty experiments described in Photometria {{were conducted by}} Lambert between 1755 and 1760, after he decided to write a treatise on light measurement. His interest in acquiring experimental data spanned several fields: optics, thermometry, pyrometry, hydrometry, and magnetics. This interest in experimental data and its analysis, so evident in Photometria, is also present in other articles and books Lambert produced. For his optics work, extremely limited equipment sufficed: a few panes of glass, convex and concave lenses, mirrors, prisms, <b>paper</b> <b>and</b> <b>cardboard,</b> pigments, candles {{and the means to}} measure distances and angles.|$|E

In Celaya, the creation of these figures became a trade much the way metalwork and pottery did, with the work dominated by certain families. Since this time, the technique has been used to make a wide variety of objects for both ritual, festival and decorative use, mostly by poorer indigenous and mestizo communities. The <b>paper</b> <b>and</b> <b>cardboard</b> used is mostly waste paper, such as old newspapers and boxes, with decorative elements, such as crepe paper being new. Most shapes are created with molds, then painted with acrylics.|$|E

Within processing industry are represented most existing branches nationwide. Over 24% of the employed population is working in different industrial sub-branches. Likewise, an important sector of Cluj County economy is the IT sector and that related to customer service – services of sales, marketing, services of IT helpdesk, technical support, that record an annual increase of over 30% in the number of employees. The industrial production in the county is intended to cover the domestic demand and supply to foreign partners. Among processing industries, those with the highest share in industrial production are non-ferrous metal industry (17.9%), food and beverage industry (17.5%), metallurgic industry (12.9%), chemicals and man-made fibers industry (8.1%), cellulose, <b>paper</b> <b>and</b> <b>cardboard</b> industry (8%).|$|E

Handcrafted items here are noted for their variety and quality. Oaxacan handcrafts are traditionally made with wood, wool, clay and leather and are sold in many venues from local tianguis markets to upscale international stores. The best-known wood craft is the making of [...] "alebrije" [...] figures, which are usually miniature, brightly colored real or imaginary animals. These were originally created from <b>paper</b> <b>and</b> <b>cardboard</b> in Mexico City, but this craft was adapted to native Oaxacan woodcarving to the form it has today.

2500|$|The {{management}} of waste {{is a key}} component in a business' ability of maintaining ISO14001 accreditation. Companies are encouraged to improve their environmental efficiencies each year by eliminating waste through resource recovery practices, which are sustainability-related activities. One {{way to do this}} is by shifting away from waste management to resource recovery practices like recycling materials such as glass, food scraps, <b>paper</b> <b>and</b> <b>cardboard,</b> plastic bottles and metal. An important market for recycled materials is the construction sector. Many inorganic waste streams can be used for the production of materials for construction. This includes the recycling of concrete and bricks, mostly used as artificial gravel.

40|$|The BioBoard {{project is}} build built on past {{research}} that has revealed that whey protein coating can provide bio-degradable plastic layers that can replace existing plastic coatings in multilayer packaging and enhance their recyclability by separating the individual fractions of the multilayer packaging [1]. To this end, a tailored coating system based on the renewable raw material derived from agrofood waste and its technological application is beinghas been developed for extrusion coating <b>paper,</b> paperboard <b>and</b> <b>cardboard</b> to produce packaging materials. About 7 million tons of coated <b>paper,</b> paperboard <b>and</b> <b>cardboard</b> are currently manufactured annually worldwide. Typical laminate packaging contains about 20 mass percent of petrochemical based polyethylene (PE). Increased political, legislative and consumer pressure to reduce the dependency on fossil fuel based plastics, but also to produce recyclable solutions, poses a major challenge for packaging producers to seek alternative materials that do not harm the environment in their manufacture and end of life, {{are based on a}} sustainable resources, and offer similar performance to their conventional plastic counterparts.

Let me now say a little about toy soldiers and the world to which they belong. Toy soldiers used to be flat, small creatures in my own boyhood, in comparison with the magnificent beings one can buy to-day. There has been an enormous improvement in our national physique in this respect. Now they stand nearly two inches high and look you broadly in the face, and they have the movable arms and alert intelligence of scientifically exercised men. You get five of them mounted or nine afoot in a box for a small price. We three like those of British manufacture best; other makes are of incompatible sizes, and we have a rule that saves much trouble, that all red coats belong to G. P. W., and all other colored coats to F. R. W., all gifts, bequests, and accidents notwithstanding. Also we have sailors; but, since there are no red-coated sailors, blue counts as red.|$|E
