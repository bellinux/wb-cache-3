40|$|We {{developed}} a new machine learning-based method {{in order to facilitate}} the manufacturing processes of pharmaceutical products, such as tablets, in accordance with the Process Analytical Technology (PAT) and Quality by Design (QbD) initiatives. Our approach combines the data, available from prior production runs, with machine learning algorithms that are assisted by a human operator with expert knowledge of the production process. The process parameters encompass those that relate to the attributes of the precursor raw materials and those that relate to the manufacturing process itself. During manufacturing, our method allows production operator to inspect the impacts of various settings of process parameters within their <b>proven</b> <b>acceptable</b> <b>range</b> with the purpose of choosing the most promising values in advance of the actual batch manufacture. The interaction between the human operator and the artificial intelligence system provides improved performance and quality. We successfully implemented the method on data provided by a pharmaceutical company for a particular product, a tablet, under development. We tested the accuracy of the method in comparison with some other machine learning approaches. The method is especially suitable for analyzing manufacturing processes characterized by a limited amount of data. Key word...|$|E
40|$|The {{usage of}} fixed dose {{combination}} (FDC) tablets of Lamivudine and Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate (TDF) is increasing {{due to increased}} incidences of HIV/Hepatitis B and HIV/TB co-infections. This {{is likely to increase}} the financial crisis due to limited resources for funding procurement of ready-made products from the pharmaceuticals manufacturing leading countries. Therefore, production of local oral tablets containing Lamivudine and TDF FDC is inevitable. Lamivudine 300 mg/TDF 300 mg tablets were developed and optimized by D-optimal mixture design and produced by direct compression technique. Twenty trial formulations with independent variables, including PVP-CL 1 – 12. 00 %, PVP-K 30 1 – 10. 00 %, starch- 1500 2. 5 – 12. 5 % and Avicel-PH 102 2 – 19. 25 % were prepared by direct compression technique. The formulations were assessed on assay, dissolution, friability, weight variation and disintegration time. It was found that assay ranged from 98. 13 – 101. 95 % for Lamivudine, 98. 25 – 102. 84 for TDF, both were within the in-house assay specification of 95 to 105 %. Dissolution at single point was above 80 % for Lamivudine 93. 96 – 100. 55 % and 95. 85 – 103. 15 % for TDF, disintegration time was between 1. 92 – 66. 33 min and friability 0. 06 – 12. 56 %. Out of twenty formulation trials, eight formulations had all parameters in <b>proven</b> <b>acceptable</b> <b>range.</b> On optimization, one formulation with independent variables, PVP-CL 5. 67 %, PVP-K 30 1. 00 %, Starch- 1500 5. 76 % was selected. The optimized formulation was comparable to the reference product on the market with similarity factor (f 2) and difference factor (f 1) within the acceptable range for both Lamivudine and TDF...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Rhenium- 188 -HEDP (188 Re-HEDP) is a {{therapeutic}} radiopharmaceutical {{for treatment of}} osteoblastic bone metastases. No standard procedure for {{the preparation of this}} radiopharmaceutical is available. Preparation conditions may influence the quality and in vivo behaviour of this product. In this study we investigate the effect of critical process parameters on product quality and stability of 188 Re-HEDP. Methods A stepwise approach was used, based on the quality by design (QbD) concept of the ICH Q 8 (Pharmaceutical Development) guideline. Potential critical process conditions were identified. Variables tested were the elution volume, the freshness of the eluate, the reaction temperature and time, and the stability of the product upon dilution and storage. The impact of each variable on radiochemical purity was investigated. The <b>acceptable</b> <b>ranges</b> were established by boundary testing. Results With 2 ml eluate, adequate radiochemical purity and stability were found. Nine ml eluate yielded a product that was less stable. Using eluate stored for 24 h resulted in acceptable radiochemical purity. Complexation for 30 min at room temperature, at 60 °C and at 100 °C generated appropriate and stable products. A complexation time of 10 min at 90 °C was too short, whereas heating 60 min resulted in products that passed quality control and were stable. Diluting the end product and storage at 32. 5 °C resulted in notable decomposition. Conclusion Two boundary tests, an elution volume of 9 ml and a heating time of 10 min, yielded products of inadequate quality or stability. The product was found to be instable after dilution or when stored above room temperature. Our findings show that our previously developed preparation method falls well within the <b>proven</b> <b>acceptable</b> <b>ranges.</b> Applying QbD principles is feasible and worthwhile for the small-scale preparation of radiopharmaceuticals...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{suggests}} multi-agent systems (MASs) {{for implementing}} game artificial intelligence (AI) for video games. One of main hindrances against using MASs technology in video games {{has been the}} real-time con- straints for frame rendering. In {{order to deal with}} the real-time constraints, we introduce an adaptation-oriented approach for maintaining frame rate in <b>acceptable</b> <b>ranges.</b> The adaptation approach is inspired from the level of detail (LoD) technique in 3 D graphics. We introduce agent organizations for defining different roles of agents in game AI. The computational requirements of agent roles have been prioritized according to their functional roles in a game. In this way, adapting computational requirements of game AI works as a means for maintaining frame rate in <b>acceptable</b> <b>ranges.</b> The proposed approach has been evaluated through a pilot experiment by using a proof of concept game. The pilot experiment shows that LoD based adaptation allows maintaining frame rate in <b>acceptable</b> <b>ranges</b> and therefore enhancing the quality of service...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{most common}} tool used for {{assessment}} {{of knowledge is}} the essay questions. Their evaluations depend upon test and item analysis which is consisting of analysis of individual questions {{and analysis of the}} whole test. The objective of our study was to calculate the Item analysis (Facility value, FV and discrimination index, DI) of questions given in terminal examination of MBBS students and observes the adequacy of questions framing in examination. Methods: Study contains 150 medical students undergone terminal examination consist of questions of essay type, structured essay type and short answer questions were given to the students. We divide them into high ability group and low ability group. Mark range was decided for essay type, structured essay type and short answer type questions and FV and DI was calculated. Results: Studies described that facility values of 62. 5 percentage questions were come under recommended and <b>acceptable</b> <b>range</b> and 50 percentage questions were come under <b>acceptable</b> <b>range.</b> Discrimination value of 100 percentage questions were come under recommended and <b>acceptable</b> <b>range</b> where 75 percentage questions were come under <b>acceptable</b> <b>range.</b> Conclusion: The importance of item analysis is highlighted from our results. For improvement of examination items with average difficulty and high discrimination should be implemented into future examinations to improve test scores and properly discriminate among the students.
