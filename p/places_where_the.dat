It was also easily accessible to Saskatoon, Prince Albert and Humboldt, <b>places</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> Court of King's Bench sat. The local people were mostly immigrants, and Diefenbaker's research found them to be particularly litigious. There was already one barrister in town, and the residents were loyal to him, initially refusing to rent office space to Diefenbaker. The new lawyer was forced to rent a vacant lot and erect a two-room wooden shack.|$|E
5|$|Before the Mexican–American War, {{when this}} area was ceded to the United States, the main trade route through this part of Mexico was the Old Spanish Trail.

The trail had multiple routes; however, the main route proceeded north towards Moab, Utah, {{one of the few}} <b>places</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> Colorado River can be crossed without having to traverse steep cliffs. The modern US491 roughly correlates with the main route of the Old Spanish Trail between Cortez, Colorado and its northern terminus.|$|E

5|$|Remains of Brachytarsomys mahajambaensis {{were found}} during {{fieldwork}} in northwestern Madagascar {{that started in}} 2001. The species was described in a 2010 paper by Pierre Mein and colleagues, together with another extinct rodent, Nesomys narindaensis. The specific name, mahajambaensis, refers to Mahajamba Bay, which {{is close to the}} <b>places</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> species has been found. It is placed in the genus Brachytarsomys, together with two larger living species, B.albicauda and B.villosa. Brachytarsomys is classified in the exclusively Madagascan subfamily Nesomyinae of the family Nesomyidae, which includes various African rodents.|$|E

5|$|The Jurassic Coast {{is subject}} to severe weather {{conditions}} at times. Violent storms occurred in 1824 and 1974, and these and various lesser storms have battered the cliffs and caused flooding and structural damage in coastal towns.

Coastal defences have been put in place in Charmouth and Weymouth, where houses are at risk, but in other <b>places,</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> coastline remains in a natural state, the management policy is to take no action and allow erosion to take its course.|$|E

5|$|The {{rocks are}} home to over 70 species of animals and 340 species of plants, which {{includes}} over 200 species of wildflowers. Vernal pools atop the plateaus fill {{during the rainy season}} in winter and spring because the andesite is impermeable. The dwarf woolly meadowfoam, a species of wildflower, grows around these pools, and is endemic to the rocks. The pools are also one of only a few <b>places</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> federally threatened species of fairy shrimp, Branchinecta lynchi, can be found. To protect these and other threatened species, the Bureau of Land Management has listed the rocks as an Area of Critical Environmental Concern since 1984.|$|E
5|$|Yarralumla {{is located}} on the Yarralumla Formation which is a mudstone/siltstone {{formation}} that was formed around 425 million years ago during the Silurian Period. The formation extends from Red Hill and Woden in the South to Lake Burley Griffin in to the north, passing under the suburb of Yarralumla. The formation is evidence of the last major marine sedimentary period when eastern Australia was still covered by shallow seas. It shows fossil evidence of trilobites, coral and primitive crinoids. The Yarralumla brickworks quarry and the Deakin anticline are <b>places</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> formation is exposed and easily studied.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} history of the breed, certain white {{markings}} and whorls were considered to be indicators of character and good or bad luck. Horses with white socks on their feet were considered to have good or bad luck, depending on the leg or legs marked. A horse with no white markings at all was considered to be ill-tempered and vice-ridden, while certain facial markings were considered representative of honesty, loyalty and endurance. Similarly, hair whorls in various places were considered to show good or bad luck, with the most unlucky being in <b>places</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> horse could not see them – for example the temples, cheek, shoulder or heart. Two whorls near the root of the tail were considered a sign of courage and good luck.|$|E
5|$|The Chronicle is not unbiased: {{there are}} {{occasions}} when {{comparison with other}} medieval sources {{makes it clear that}} the scribes who wrote it omitted events or told one-sided versions of stories; there are also <b>places</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> different versions contradict each other. Taken as a whole, however, the Chronicle {{is the single most important}} historical source for the period in England between the departure of the Romans and the decades following the Norman conquest. Much of the information given in the Chronicle is not recorded elsewhere. In addition, the manuscripts are important sources for the history of the English language; in particular, the later Peterborough text is one of the earliest examples of Middle English in existence.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of the Don Valley Parkway was a major undertaking that changed much of the Don valley. While industrial areas existed both {{near the mouth of}} the Don River and the area of today's Leaside Bridge, several natural areas remained in those <b>places</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> steep sides of the valley had dissuaded large-scale urban development. The post-war growth period of Toronto provided an impetus to build a new automobile route into central Toronto, and the route through the valley was chosen to avoid expropriation of existing development and provide access for new development in the Metropolitan Toronto region. The {{construction of}} the six-lane highway modified the valley through the removal of hills, other earth works and the rerouting of the Don River. Since completion, the parkway has not been changed significantly, other than adding one partial interchange at Wynford Drive and updating its infrastructure to current standards.|$|E

5|$|The {{stranding}} of the Northern bottlenose whale mainly {{happens in}} two {{villages in the}} northern part of Suðuroy: Hvalba and Sandvík. It is believed that it happens because of a navigation problem of the whale, because there are isthmuses on these <b>places,</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> distance between the east and west coasts are short, around one kilometer or so. And for some reason it seems like the bottlenose whale want to take a short cut through what it thinks is a sound, and too late it discovers, that is on shallow ground and is unable to turn around again. It happened on 30 August 2012, when two Northern bottlenose whales swam ashore to the gorge Sigmundsgjógv in Sandvík. Two men who were working on the harbour noticed these whales, and some time later they had either died by themselves or were killed by the locals and then cut up for food for the people of Sandvík and Hvalba (Hvalba municipality).|$|E
5|$|Two {{distinct}} functions – {{first that}} of traction by adhesion as in an ordinary loco; second that of traction by pinions {{acting on the}} track bars. The brakes are four in number – two handbrakes, acting by friction; and two acting by preventing the free escape of air from cylinder and thus using compressed air in retarding {{the progress of the}} engine. The former are used for shunting whilst the later for descending steep gradients. One of the handbrakes acts on the tyres of the wheels in the ordinary manner and the second acts on grooved surfaces of the pinion axle, but can be used in those <b>places</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> rack is laid.|$|E
5|$|Cathedrals are <b>places</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> Christian rituals {{particular}} to a bishop, especially ordination and enthronement, can be performed, and are structured and furnished for these purposes. Each cathedral contains {{the seat of}} the local bishop, often literally a large throne. The bishop's throne is located towards the eastern end of the cathedral, near the high altar, which is main focus of worship. On the altar is served the Eucharist, a symbolic meal of bread and wine in memory of Jesus’ last supper with his disciples. In the early Medieval period, the altar always contained, or was associated with, the relics of a saint. Sometimes the relics were held in a separate shrine, near the high altar. In this part of the church are often located the tombs of former bishops, typically arranged either side of the major shrine, so the worshipping congregation symbolically comprised the whole body of clergy of the diocese, both living and dead, in communion with their patron saint. Seats are provided for the other significant clergy of the cathedral: the dean who is the foremost priest at the cathedral, the precentor, sacristan, archdeacon and canons.|$|E
