50|$|This {{is because}} the firm in perfect {{competition}} is a <b>price</b> <b>taker.</b> It {{does not have to}} lower the price in order to sell additional units of the good.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{economists have}} a {{different}} kind of criticism concerning perfect competition model. They are not criticizing the <b>price</b> <b>taker</b> assumption because it makes economic agents too [...] "passive", but because it then raises the question of who sets the prices. Indeed, if everyone is <b>price</b> <b>taker,</b> there is the need for a benevolent planner who gives and sets the prices, in other word, {{there is a need for}} a [...] "price maker". Therefore, it makes the perfect competition model appropriate not to describe a decentralize [...] "market" [...] economy but a centralized one. This in turn means that such kind of model has more to do with communism than capitalism.|$|E

50|$|Assume the {{structure}} of both the product and factor markets are perfectly competitive. In both markets firms are <b>price</b> <b>takers.</b> The <b>price</b> is set at the market level through the interaction of supply and demand. The firms can sell {{as much of the}} product as they want at the set price since they are <b>price</b> <b>takers.</b>|$|R

50|$|At {{the first}} trade on February 1, 2012 there were 9 members; they opened for an {{equivalent}} of a metric ton at $24,640, closing at $24,500. LME closed at $20,290. The transactions were still very low with only 2 lot (10 metric tons) transactions, but INATIN hopes it will change the <b>price</b> <b>taker</b> position to be a price maker.|$|E
50|$|If {{the firm}} is able to sell its {{transfer}} goods in an imperfect market, then it {{need not be a}} <b>price</b> <b>taker.</b> There are two markets each with its own price (Pf and Pt in the next diagram). The aggregate market is constructed from the first two. That is, point C is a horizontal summation of points A and B (and likewise for all other points on the Net Marginal Revenue curve (NMRa)). The total optimum quantity (Q) is the sum of Qf plus Qt.|$|E
50|$|Price {{controls}} are a government initiative to mitigate exploitative market power. Specifically {{in response to}} systems of pricing that capitalise on the dependency of one market entity upon another, such as monopolistic markets in which the supplier is a price maker and consumers {{assume the role of}} <b>price</b> <b>taker.</b> Price controls as a strategy provide relief from the price exploitation of the dominant player in a market transaction, albeit a short term abatement of this power which is a common criticism of this method.|$|E
40|$|In this study, we {{proposed}} a game-theory based framework to model the dynamic pricing process in the cloud manufacturing (CMfg) system. We considered a service provider (SP), a broker agent (BA), and a dynamic service demander (SD) population that is composed of <b>price</b> <b>takers</b> and bargainers in this study. The pricing processes under linear demand and constant elasticity demand were modeled, respectively. The combined effects of SD population structure, negotiation, and demand forms on the SP’s and the BA’s equilibrium prices and expected revenues were examined. We found that the SP’s optimal wholesale price, the BA’s optimal reservation price, and posted price all increase with the proportion of <b>price</b> <b>takers</b> under linear demand but decrease with it under constant elasticity demand. We {{also found that the}} BA’s optimal reservation price increases with bargainers’ power no matter under what kind of demand. Through analyzing the participants’ revenues, we showed that a dynamic SD population with a high ratio of <b>price</b> <b>takers</b> would benefit the SP and the BA...|$|R
50|$|It {{is often}} assumed that agents are <b>price</b> <b>takers,</b> and under that {{assumption}} two common notions of equilibrium exist: Walrasian, or competitive equilibrium, and its generalization: a price equilibrium with transfers.|$|R
50|$|In liquid markets {{like the}} New York Stock Exchange, nearly every asset has open interest, {{providing}} two beneﬁts: <b>price</b> <b>takers</b> can {{buy or sell}} at any time, and observers can continually monitor a precise price of every asset.|$|R
50|$|Suppose {{further that}} after a merger between firms in the {{industry}} takes place, unit costs fall to {{as a result of}} economies of scale or other forms of synergy. However, the industry is now less competitive, with a monopoly being the most extreme example. Since the firm is no longer a <b>price</b> <b>taker,</b> the price it charges will be above the (now lower) unit cost. For a monopoly, for example, the price will be set where the unit/marginal cost intersects marginal revenue. This means that the amount of consumer surplus, the area below the demand curve and above the price, will be lower.|$|E
50|$|If the {{production}} division {{is able to}} sell the transfer good in a competitive market (as well as internally), then again both must operate where their marginal costs equal their marginal revenue, for profit maximization. Because the external market is competitive, the firm is a <b>price</b> <b>taker</b> and must accept the transfer price determined by market forces (their marginal revenue from transfer and demand for transfer products becomes the transfer price). If the market price is relatively high (as in Ptr1 in the next diagram), then the firm will experience an internal surplus (excess internal supply) equal to the amount Qt1 minus Qf1. The actual marginal cost curve is defined by points A,C,D.|$|E
40|$|Average {{profits of}} a <b>price</b> <b>taker</b> are {{increasing}} in {{the variability of}} the output price (Oi, 1961). We show that, for the same reason, average profits of the <b>price</b> <b>taker</b> are increasing in the variability {{of the price of}} inputs. We proceed to establish that the same holds for a firm with a downward sloping demand curve. Unless the inverse demand curve of the firm with market power is very convex, the profit function of the <b>price</b> <b>taker</b> forms an upper limit for the convexity of profit (assuming constant curvature of costs) ...|$|E
30|$|In this model, {{emission}} {{trading is}} carried out on daily basis, and GENCOs are considered as <b>price</b> <b>takers,</b> who report their everyday emission allowance demand to the emission market. Daily emission price pe will then be generated based on a “demand–price” model.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{whether or}} not the number of fishers is optimal under an Individual Transferable Quotas (ITQ) program. We consider two cases on the structure of the quota market: (1) cases in which all fishers are <b>price</b> <b>takers,</b> and (2) cases in which large-scale fishers have market power. When all fishers are <b>price</b> <b>takers</b> in the quota market, the social optimum is likely to be achieved given the total allowable catch (TAC) level. On the other hand, when low-cost fishers have market power in the quota market, the inefficiency may be serious: excess entry of low-cost fishers and insufficient exit of high-cost fishers may take place. Moreover, we demonstrate that vessel controls and stock targeting may work for an ITQ program. ...|$|R
40|$|In many markets firms set {{posted prices}} which are {{potentially}} negotiable. � We analyze the optimal marketing mix of pricing and bargaining when <b>price</b> <b>takers</b> buy at posted prices but bargainers attempt to negotiate discounts. � The optimal bargaining strategy involves the firms offering bargainers randomly-sized discounts. � Competing firms keep posted prices high {{to weaken the}} bargainers' outside option, thus forgoing the chance to increase profits from <b>price</b> <b>takers</b> by undercutting their rival. � A range of posted price equilibria are possible, and the higher price in the range inrceases when the proportion of bargainers goes up or the bargainers become less skilled. � We consider how firms and competition authorities might encourage more consumers to bargain and determine {{the conditions under which}} each would choose to do so. � Finally, we study the firms' strategic decision about how much bargaining discretion sales staff should be allowed. � Both firms allowing full bargaining flexibility is always an equilibrium - but not always the most profitable one. � If there are enough bargainers, both firms committing to only matching the rival's posted price is also an equilibrium: price matching moderates competition, thus raising profits.

50|$|Samuelson {{indicates}} {{this point}} on the Consumer Demand curve is where Price is equal to one over one plus the reciprocal of the price elasticity of demand. This rule {{does not apply to}} competitive firms since such firms are <b>price</b> <b>takers,</b> and don't have the market power to control either prices or Industry-Wide Sales.|$|R
30|$|Scale also {{facilitate}} gain substantial {{market share}} in a competitive market. This helps large scaled firms to force customers and suppliers to become <b>price</b> <b>takers</b> {{as well as to}} review their own strategies in light of their dependency on local firm. Scale also serves as a strong barrier to entry for new entrants in an industry.|$|R
