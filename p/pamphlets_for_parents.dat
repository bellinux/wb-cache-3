[...] Frank and Theresa co-authored The Power of Play (1973), The First Twelve Months of Life (1977), The Second Twelve Months of Life (1978), and The Early Childhood Years: The 2 to 6 Year Old (1983), which covered the mental, physical, language {{and social development}} of early childhood with advice for parents and answers to common concerns.

40|$|The data {{collection}} contains {{qualitative and quantitative}} research data associated with the Parents and smoke-free Kids Project. The data was collected from {{a convenience sample of}} 46 parents/carers of primary school aged children via four focus groups and 17 interviews. To be eligible to participate, parents/carers had to have children aged four to nine years and to currently smoke, used to smoke or lived with someone who smoked. Participants were asked for their opinions about smoking cessation; ways to discourage children from smoking and features of the proposed intervention materials. Intervention materials were four versions of a <b>pamphlet</b> <b>for</b> <b>parents</b> about protecting their child from cigarette smoke and provide information on their preferred setting and channel for receiving information relating to smoking cessation and their child. Quantitative data includes gender, age, rural or Metro location and smoking status. In 2008 participants were also asked their preferred version of the draft pamphlets that had been developed and preferred channel and settings for distribution of smoking information. Quantitative data are stored as Excel and SPSS files. The qualitative data includes transcriptions of audio recordings of interviews (face-to-face and telephone) and focus groups conducted with parents of primary school aged children. Qualitative data are stored in Word format as NVivo 6 and NVivo 8 files. Data was collected from 150 parents/carers of primary school aged children in socially disadvantaged areas (selected using the SEIFA index) of the Perth Metropolitan area and two rural areas of Western Australia (Geraldton and Northam) during 2007 and 2008...|$|R
30|$|Prenatal {{diagnosis}} of orofacial cleft gives the parents {{the possibility to}} prepare themselves in an emotional and practical way [20]. A frank discussion {{of the cost of}} care and strategies for obtaining coverage for care can also relieve unspoken anxiety [4]. Knowing the diagnosis before delivery also allows the cleft team to discuss the plans, for example, feeding issues, type and geographical location of the cleft [2]. This would make delivery much less traumatic, especially <b>for</b> the <b>parents</b> and the extended family [2]. Our department offers information <b>pamphlet</b> <b>for</b> the future <b>parents</b> when they visit for first counseling. Information pamphlet should contain the concerns of parents-to-be, including longitudinal management of clefts and contact numbers [2].|$|R
40|$|AbstractPurposeIndoor tanning usually begins during adolescence, but few {{strategies}} {{exist to}} discourage adolescent use. We developed and tested a parent–teenager intervention to decrease indoor tanning use. MethodsThrough focus groups, we identified key messages to enhance parent–teenager communication about indoor tanning, and then developed a <b>pamphlet</b> <b>for</b> <b>parents</b> and postcards <b>for</b> adolescents {{to use in}} a direct mail experiment with randomly selected households. Two weeks after the mailing, we asked intervention parents (n = 87) and adolescents (n = 69) and nonintervention parents (n = 31) and adolescents (n = 28) about intervention receipt and content recall, parental concern, monitoring, parent–teenager conversations, and indoor tanning intention. ResultsIn intervention households, 54 % of mothers and 56 % of girls recalled receipt and reported reading materials, but few boys and no fathers did. Among mothers, 57 % in intervention households indicated concern about daughters' indoor tanning, and 25 % would allow daughters to tan indoors, whereas 43 % of nonintervention mothers had concerns and 46 % would allow indoor tanning. Fewer girls in intervention households than in nonintervention households thought parents would allow indoor tanning (44 % vs. 65 %), and fewer intended to tan indoors (36 % vs. 60 %). Most mothers and daughters who read the intervention materials also reported discussions about indoor tanning. Moreover, the less likely girls were to think that their mothers would allow indoor tanning, the less likely it was that they intended to tan indoors, a relationship mediated by perceptions of maternal monitoring. ConclusionsA systematic qualitative and quantitative research approach yielded well-received indoor tanning prevention messages for mothers and female adolescents. Enhancing maternal monitoring has potential to decrease adolescent indoor tanning...|$|R
40|$|Many {{families}} {{have turned their}} family room into classrooms. In 1993, homeschooling became legal in all 50 states, {{when the number of}} students staying at home for schooling tripled. This trend continues today because parents want to retain control over the education and socialization of their children. Homeschooling refers to education of school-age children with their parents 2 ̆ 7 guiding, directing, and monitoring them. It replaces full-time attendance at a traditional school. Parents express various reasons for educating their children at home; individualization, family time, strong academic, moral, and religious foundations. The problem with homeschooling, <b>for</b> <b>parents</b> of deaf children, is the lack of informational pamphlets to provide information and guide parents to educate their deaf children successfully. How can parents learn to guide their deaf children in their home without instructions on homeschooling? Where they find resources or materials they can use in homeschooling? Parents might have interrogations on homeschooling. Creating a <b>pamphlet</b> with guidelines <b>for</b> <b>parents</b> homeschooling their deaf children is suggested as a possible solution. These will help prepare parents in educating their deaf children in their home. Parents {{need to be aware of}} all aspects of children 2 ̆ 7 s life illustrating social, academics, and other issues...|$|R
