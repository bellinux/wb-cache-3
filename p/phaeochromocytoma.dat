Methods - The clinicopathological features of 65 patients (31 men, 34 women) with <b>phaeochromocytomas</b> or paragangliomas were analysed. The tumours were studied for the expression of p 53, Rb, and mdm 2 by immunohistochemical methods. Results - Thirty nine of the patients had <b>phaeochromocytomas</b> and 26 had paragangliomas. Bilateral tumours were noted in eight of the patients and malignant tumours were seen in 13. Paragangliomas were often small, non-functional, and presented incidentally, whereas <b>phaeochromocytomas</b> were usually large, functional, and symptomatic, p 53 overexpression, loss of Rb expression, and mdm 2 overexpression were seen in four, 43, and 37 of the patients, respectively. Three of the four patients with p 53 overexpression had bilateral tumours. Loss of Rb expression was often found in <b>phaeochromocytomas,</b> whereas mdm 2 overexpression was more frequently seen in paragangliomas. The 10 year survival rate of patients with malignant tumours was 45 %. Two patients died of tumour metastases more than 10 years after resection of the primary tumours. Conclusions - <b>Phaeochromocytomas</b> and paragangliomas had distinctive clinical features and genetic alterations.

40|$|Background <b>Phaeochromocytomas</b> and paragangliomas are neuro-endocrine tumours {{that occur}} {{sporadically}} {{and in several}} hereditary tumour syndromes, including the phaeochromocytoma-paraganglioma syndrome. This syndrome is caused by germline mutations in succinate dehydrogenase B (SDHB), C (SDHC), or D (SDHD) genes. Clinically, the phaeochromocytoma-paraganglioma syndrome is often unrecognised, although 10 - 30 % of apparently sporadic <b>phaeochromocytomas</b> and paragangliomas harbour germline SDH-gene mutations. Despite these figures, the screening of <b>phaeochromocytomas</b> and paragangliomas for mutations in the SDH genes to detect phaeochromocytoma-paraganglioma syndrome is rarely done because of time and financial constraints. We investigated whether SDHB immunohistochemistry could effectively discriminate between SDH-related and non-SDH-related <b>phaeochromocytomas</b> and paragangliomas in large retrospective and prospective tumour series. Methods Immunohistochemistry for SDHB was done on 220 tumours. Two retrospective series of 175 <b>phaeochromocytomas</b> and paragangliomas with known germline mutation status for phaeochromocytoma-susceptibility or paraganglioma-susceptibility genes were investigated. Additionally, a prospective series of 45 <b>phaeochromocytomas</b> and paragangliomas was investigated for SDHB immunostaining followed by SDHB, SDHC, and SDHD mutation testing. Findings SDHB protein expression was absent in all 102 <b>phaeochromocytomas</b> and paragangliomas with an SDHB, SDHC, or SDHD mutation, but was present in all 65 paraganglionic tumours related to multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2, von Hippel-Lindau disease, and neurofibromatosis type 1. 47 (89 %) of the 53 <b>phaeochromocytomas</b> and paragangliomas with no syndromic germline mutation showed SDHB expression. The sensitivity and specificity of the SDHB immunohistochemistry to detect {{the presence of an}} SDH mutation in the prospective series were 100 % (95 % CI 87 - 100) and 84 % (60 - 97), respectively. Interpretation Phaeochromocytoma-paraganglioma syndrome can be diagnosed reliably by an immunohistochemical procedure. SDHB, SDHC, and SDHD germline mutation testing is indicated only in patients with SDHB-negative tumours. SDHB immunohistochemistry on <b>phaeochromocytomas</b> and paragangliomas could improve the diagnosis of phaeochromocytoma-paraganglioma syndrome.

This study examined influences of hereditary factors {{and differences in}} catecholamine production on tumour expression of NPY, as assessed by quantitative PCR, enzyme immunoassay and immunohistochemistry. <b>Phaeochromocytomas</b> included hereditary adrenaline-producing tumours (adrenergic phenotype) in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2), predominantly noradrenaline-producing tumours (noradrenergic phenotype) in von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome, and other adrenergic and noradrenergic tumours {{where there was no}} clear hereditary syndrome. NPY levels in <b>phaeochromocytomas</b> from VHL patients were lower (P< 0. 0001) than in those from MEN 2 patients for both mRNA (84 -fold difference) and the peptide (99 -fold difference). These findings were supported by immunohistochemistry. NPY levels were also lower in VHL tumours than in those where there was no hereditary syndrome. Relative absence of expression of NPY in <b>phaeochromocytomas</b> from VHL patients when compared with other groups appears to be largely independent of differences in catecholamine production and is consistent with a unique phenotype in VHL syndrome...|$|R

40|$|<b>Phaeochromocytomas</b> usually occur {{sporadically}} but {{may also}} be a feature of three autosomal dominantly inherited cancer syndromes, multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2, von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL), and, very rarely, type 1 neurofibromatosis. Germ-line missense mutations in the RET proto-oncogene, which encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase, cause multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2. In VHL, germ-line mutations in one of the three exons of the VHL tumor suppressor gene have been found in the majority of families. Whereas somatic mutations in the VHL gene have been common in sporadic renal cell carcinoma, a component cancer of VHL, somatic mutations in the RET and VHL genes together have been found in approximately 10 % of sporadic <b>phaeochromocytomas.</b> Hence, other genes must also contribute to the pathogenesis of sporadic <b>phaeochromocytomas.</b> Recent data have suggested that glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) is a ligand for RET and acts via a heterotetrameric receptor complex that includes GDNF receptor alpha, which provides ligand binding capabilities, and RET, which provides the signaling component. Thus, both GDNF and GDNFR-alpha are plausible candidate genes for involvement in the pathogenesis of <b>phaeochromocytomas.</b> To investigate the role of GDNF in sporadic <b>phaeochromocytomas,</b> we scanned a panel of 22 tumors.

METHODS: 18 extra-adrenal paragangliomas and seven adrenal <b>phaeochromocytomas</b> were stained with CAM 5. 2, AE 1 / 3, and 34 beta E 12 following microwave antigen retrieval of formalin fixed tissue. RESULTS: A single {{case from the}} cauda equina was positive for both CAM 5. 2 and AE 1 / 3.

CONCLUSIONS: Cauda equina paragangliomas are known to stain with cytokeratins; however, occasional paragangliomas from other sites may also be immunoreactive with cytokeratins.

40|$|Evaluation of the {{malignant}} {{potential of}} <b>phaeochromocytomas</b> {{in the absence}} of metastases presents a formidable challenge to both clinicians and pathologists. Until now, no widely accepted clinical, histological, immunohistochemical or molecular method has become available to discriminate malignant from benign <b>phaeochromocytomas.</b> In other endocrine tumours, estimation of proliferative activity by MIB- 1 immunostaining has emerged as a promising approach for the determination of metastatic potential. In this study, the utility of MIB- 1 immunostaining as a predictive marker for the occurrence of metastases in <b>phaeochromocytomas</b> was evaluated. In addition, the density of S 100 -positive sustentacular cells was studied, since their depletion has been identified as a negative predictive marker in smaller series. Furthermore, several clinicopathological parameters were evaluated. One hundred and ten patients operated on for a total of 99 benign and 37 malignant <b>phaeochromocytomas</b> were studied. All malignant tumours had documented metastases. The histopathological diagnosis of primary tumours and metastases was reviewed and graded for angioinvasion, capsular extension, and intra-tumoural necrosis. The proliferative index (percentage of MIB- 1 -positive cells) and the density of S 100 -positive cells were assessed. In addition, age at resection, associated familial tumour syndromes, tumour size, and tumour location were recorded. Univariate analysis revealed statistically significant correlations between malignancy and proliferative index (p< 0. 0005) and depletion of S 100 -positive sustentacular cells (p< 0. 0005). Fifty per cent of the malignant, but none of the benign <b>phaeochromocytomas</b> had a proliferative index greater than 2. 5 %. Higher age at resection (p= 0. 03), sporadic occurrence (p< 0. 0005), extra-adrenal location (p< 0. 0005), tumour size (p< 0. 0005), and necrosis (p= 0. 03) were also significantly associated with malignancy. Logistic regression showed that proliferative index (p= 0. 0072), size (p= 0. 0022), and extra-adrenal location (p= 0. 0012) of the primary tumour were independently predictive for malignancy. In conclusion, this study indicates that assessing the proliferative activity of <b>phaeochromocytomas</b> by MIB- 1 immunohistochemistry can predict the occurrence of metastases.

5000|$|The sympathoadrenal {{system is}} a {{physiological}} connection between the sympathetic nervous system and the adrenal medulla and is crucial in an organism’s physiological response to outside stimuli. When the body receives sensory information, the sympathetic nervous system sends a signal to preganglionic nerve fibers, which activate the adrenal medulla through acetylcholine. Once activated, norepinephrine and epinephrine are released directly into the blood by postganglionic nerve fibers where they act as the bodily mechanism for [...] "fight-or-flight" [...] responses. Because of this, the sympathoadrenal system plays {{a large role in}} maintaining glucose levels, sodium levels, blood pressure, and various other metabolic pathways that couple with bodily responses to the environment. During numerous diseased states, such as hypoglycemia or even stress, the body’s metabolic processes are skewed. The sympathoadrenal system works to return the body to homeostasis through the activation or inactivation of the adrenal gland. However, more severe disorders of the sympathoadrenal system such as <b>phaeochromocytoma</b> (a tumor on the adrenal medulla) can affect the body’s ability to maintain a homeostatic state. In such cases, curative agents such as adrenergic agonists and antagonists are used to modify epinephrine and norepinephrine levels released by the adrenal medulla.|$|E

It appears in the episode. Symptoms that the inmate experienced includes: flank pain, elevated heart rate, elevated blood pressure, palpitations, anxiety and diaphoresis. PCC can also cause malignant hypertension. The diagnosis can be established by measuring catecholamines and metanephrines in plasma or through a 24-hour urine collection. Surgical resection of the tumor is the treatment of first choice, either by open laparotomy or else laparoscopy.

All underwent bilateral adrenalectomy: histological examination confirmed bilateral <b>phaeochromocytomas</b> in all three patients, with the smaller adrenal showing tumours between 3 and 11 mm in diameter. A fourth patient with von Hippel-Lindau disease was also evaluated because of a left 'suprarenal' mass discovered by ultrasound scanning. Urinary and plasma catecholamines were normal. Computed tomography showed a normal right adrenal, with a left para-aortic mass lying superior to the left adrenal. Magnetic resonance scanning showed an enhanced T 2 signal from the mass, which also showed positive uptake with radiolabelled mIBG. At operation, a non-secretory left para-aortic paraganglioma was found. Venous sampling suggested that the left adrenal was normal, and this was confirmed on histology. Venous sampling for catecholamine assays is effective in locating small bilateral <b>phaeochromocytomas</b> and defining a normal adrenal gland, and can be useful in preventing unnecessary or repeat operations in patients with non Hippel-Lindau disease...|$|R
