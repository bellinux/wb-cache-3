40|$|A {{new model}} for the farm-retail <b>price</b> <b>spread,</b> which {{accounts}} for both farm supply and retail demand changes, is introduced. This model is applied to beef, and its empirical performance relative to the markup pricing formulation is evaluated using nonnested testing procedures. The {{results are consistent with}} theory and indicate the markup pricing model is misspecified. Key words: beef, marketing margins, markup pricing, nonnested testing. In recent years the real farm price of beef has declined despite a secular decline in beef pro-duction. This suggests demand as well as sup-ply changes are important in explaining price changes. Farm-level demand for beef is influ-enced by changes in both consumer demand and the farm-retail <b>price</b> <b>spread</b> for beef. This paper focuses on factors affecting the <b>price</b> <b>spread</b> by estimating and testing alternative empirical specifications of the farm-retail <b>price</b> <b>spread</b> for beef. A common approach to modeling <b>price</b> <b>spread</b> behavior is to assume the <b>price</b> <b>spread</b> is a combination of both percentage and con-stant absolute amounts (Waugh; George and King). This suggests an empirical specification in which the <b>price</b> <b>spread</b> is related to retail price and marketing input prices. This mod-eling approach has been applied to beef by Freebairn and Rausser, Arzac and Wilkinson, and Brester and Marsh.

This study present a framework on how to model the <b>price</b> <b>spread</b> when farm and retail price are traded in different currencies. The <b>price</b> <b>spread</b> and <b>price</b> linkage relationship is estimated as a system using exchange rate and mark-up costs. The proposed framework is applied on farmed Atlantic salmon using Norwegian farm price and French retail price. The most important results suggests that exchange rate is, as expected, the most important factor; that exchange rate pass thru is not complete, but the law of one price is supported; that a formulation on market efficiency hold; and that changes in farm price are not reflected in the <b>price</b> <b>spread...</b>|$|R
