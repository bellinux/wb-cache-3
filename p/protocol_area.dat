40|$|This thesis {{documents}} the design, verification and benchmarking {{of a new}} set of handshake components for the Balsa synthesis system. The handshake components employ the 2 -phase single-rail asynchronous communication protocol. Balsa is the common name of a synthesis system and language that enable syntax-directed implementations of asynchronous circuits by connecting networks of handshake components. Handshake components enable an abstraction away from the gate level implementation, thus letting the designer focus entirely on functionality. To provide a background, an introduction to asynchronous systems and design styles is given, before the Balsa system and how it can help make asynchronous designs easier is explained. The general handshake component design process is gone through, in addition to particular challenges regarding specific components and evaluations of and possible improvements to certain components being highlighted. A collection of Balsa designs representing a diverse range of applications are used as benchmarking circuits for the 2 -phase single-rail handshake components. Results of the benchmarks are presented, analyzed and compared to results from benchmarks of circuit implementations using the 4 -phase single-rail <b>protocol.</b> <b>Area</b> estimations reveal an area overhead in implementations using the 2 -phase single-rail protocol compared to 4 -phase single-rail, which complies with expectations of complex control logic for the 2 -phase single-rail protocol. Analysis of synthesis results also reveals that area is distributed on quite different handshake components for the two protocols because of differently optimized handshake components. Estimations of throughput and latency indicate a certain performance increase for circuits implemented using the 2 -phase single-rail protocol, which can be seen as an expected, fortunate byproduct of the handshaking protocol's nature. Power consumption analyses performed on the benchmarking circuits indicate a substantial power and energy consumption decrease for the 2 -phase single-rail protocol in the Atmel technology, but the numbers are incomplete and will need verification. Together the results indicate that circuits implemented using the 2 -phase single-rail protocol will have potential benefits over the 4 -phase single-rail protocol for certain applications and cost functions, and can become an important asset to the Balsa system...|$|E

RemigFoodborne {{illness is}} a serious health problem in the United States, and {{especially}} in the mature adult population. This research examined food safety knowledge of mature Kansans(aged 55 years and older) in three important constructs (handwashing, food handling, and food preparation), their knowledge of foodborne illness symptoms, and their food safety concerns while eating away from home. One-hundred and forty participants completed a self-administered questionnaire containing ten food safety knowledge questions representing sixty answer options. Replies to those questions were compared by age, gender, geographic location,and educational attainment. Results indicated that geographic location was statistically significantly related to food safety knowledge; however, age, gender, and education had little to moderate association. Additional findings revealed food safety knowledge was not associated with participants’ level of food safety concern while eating away from home. In conclusion, the findings revealed that mature Kansans possessed general food safety knowledge; however, some responses indicated mature adults did not fully understand certain food safety <b>protocols.</b> <b>Areas</b> identified as needing further attention included appropriate hand drying and surface cleaning, safe food and refrigerator temperatures, proper thawing practices, as well as safe leftover and melon preparation...|$|R

We report on a controlled clinical study assessing the safety and efficacy of a new therapeutic ultrasound device for non-invasive body contouring, named Proslimelt (PromoItalia Group S. p. A, Pozzuoli, Italy). A prospective study was conducted on 50 healthy patients (37 females and 13 males). The evaluation period lasted 8 consecutive weeks at the frequency of 1 session every 15 days for a mean total of 3, 73 sessions. Results were assessed immediately after completion of the treatment <b>protocol.</b> <b>Areas</b> treated were the abdomen, the ankles, the arms, the buttocks and inner and outer thighs. Efficacy was determined by subjective and objective (plicometric and perimetric measurements, photographic and ultrasound evaluations) determinations. Safety was determined by clinical findings, assays of serum triglycerides, and hepatic transaminases. Finally, histopathological analyses were conducted in order to define morphological effects of the treatment. All patients showed significant reduction in subcutaneous fat thickness within the treated area, determined both by subjective an objective evaluations. Interestingly, weight was unchanged during the treatment and follow-up period and no adverse effects were observed. Histopathological analysis of the treated areas, showed cytoplasmic alteration of adipocytes.

Since all hardware clocks area unit imperfect, local clocks of nodes could alienate from one another in time, thus determined time or durations of your time intervals could differ for every node within the network.

40|$|Abstract- Massively multi user virtual {{environment}} (MMVE) applications must {{face the challenge}} of dealing with update message exchange among a large set of nodes distributed over the Internet. Therefore design of scalable network protocols is a major concern in such large scale distributed architectures. Several approaches have been proposed to aid update exchange in MMVEs. Message localization has always been a key point in the design of such distributed network <b>protocols.</b> <b>Area</b> of Interest Management (AoIM) mainly deals with the issues related to the update message localization with respect to the user’s interest. As the number of users in the {{virtual environment}} increases, update message localization becomes more important in order to prevent transmission of a huge bulk of unnecessary update messages to uninterested users. Therefore, scalable and efficient area of interest management is a challenge in MMVE design. This paper introduces a new zone selection and distributed regional message filtering architecture for MMVE applications. We propose Delaunay tetrahedrization of the virtual environment as a good way of virtual world partitioning due to several promising features. Moreover we propose a partitioning scheme with respect to barriers in order to reach a better performance through the filtering of a group of update messages that need not be propagated over the barriers. We will also introduce a distributed interest management design based on the previous partitioning technique. Our proposed distributed message dissemination approach is capable of providing the interested users with variable updates rate according to their required Level of Detail. I...|$|R
