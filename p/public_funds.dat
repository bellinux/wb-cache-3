40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effects of <b>public</b> R&D <b>funding</b> on the funded firms in Finland. It focuses on the input {{additionality}}, the output additionality of <b>public</b> <b>funding</b> and the effect an increase of innovation effort has on the innovation output of firms. The data set for this analysis is taken from the Community Innovation Survey which allows us to compare the results obtained with results obtained for other countries. For reasons discussed in the study the Finnish results are checked against results obtained for analyses of the Community Innovation Survey in Germany. Concerning the overall effects of <b>public</b> <b>funding</b> in Finland we can draw quite positive conclusions based on our empirical analysis: First, on average, <b>public</b> <b>funding</b> increases the private innovation effort of funded firms, in both nominal and real terms. Second, on average, <b>public</b> <b>funding</b> increases the innovation output of <b>funded</b> firms. <b>Public</b> <b>funding</b> yields the largest effects when it stimulating collaborative innovation activities.

40|$|Funding {{of parties}} is common and {{controversial}} in new democracies. Nonetheless, the nascent literature {{about the effects}} of money in new party systems largely sidesteps the issue of <b>public</b> <b>funding.</b> This article seeks to begin filling this theoretical and empirical void. Two hypotheses are formulated about the expected effects of introduction and marginal increases in <b>public</b> <b>funding</b> on institutionalization of the party system. The hypotheses are then tested in a statistical study of all new democracies in Eastern Europe, the Baltics, and other former Soviet Republics. The results show strong support for the idea that <b>public</b> <b>funding</b> increases institutionalization of new party systems. This is in stark contrast to theories about more established democracies that hold introduction of <b>public</b> <b>funding</b> decreases institutionalization of the party system. Furthermore, the results suggest that differing thresholds to <b>public</b> <b>funding</b> have divergent effects on political institutionalization, but this effect is not necessarily linear...|$|R

40|$|No isbnThis work {{analyses}} {{the impact}} of <b>public</b> <b>funding</b> for innovation on cooperation in innovation by firms, making use of data from the Third and Fourth European Community Innovation Surveys (CIS 3 and CIS 4) and the OECD bi-annual business R&D surveys 2004 and 2006 for Belgium. A combination of econometric techniques is used to measure {{the impact of}} different types of <b>public</b> <b>funding</b> on different types of research cooperation. First, cross-section regression estimates are presented of a bivariate probit model explaining the likelihood of research cooperation with business and with public research organisations (measured by data from CIS 4) by <b>public</b> <b>funding</b> and a set of control variables, each time instrumented by lagged values (from CIS 3). A non-parametric matching procedure is then applied, estimating the average treatment effect by <b>public</b> <b>funding</b> on the types of research cooperation considered, using again instrumented control variables. The results show that there is a substantial impact of total <b>public</b> <b>funding</b> and that its statistical significance is highest in the case of cooperation with public research organisations. Further refinement of total <b>public</b> <b>funding</b> by source of funding shows that regional government funding in Belgium has, by far, the greatest impact. There is also a more modest influence of federal government funding, mainly on cooperation with business, whereas EU funding has an impact when combined with regional funding, and this mainly on cooperation with public research organisations. These differences in impact can be explained both by the organisation of Belgian science and technology policy and by the distinct aims pursued by the respective <b>public</b> <b>funding</b> agencies. However, the combination of different conceptual and/or econometric approaches to measure the impact of <b>public</b> <b>funding</b> on research cooperation also clearly highlights the many shortcomings and problems arising when doing so. status: publishe...|$|R
