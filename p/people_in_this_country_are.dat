40|$|Côte d’Ivoire is {{the country}} worst {{affected}} by theHIV epidemic inWest Africa, and young <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>are</b> a particularly vulnerable group. This study examined the relation between parental factors and sexual risk-taking among young people using logistic regression and survival analysis methods. Three parental factors (living in the same household as the father during childhood, perceived parental disapproval of early and premarital pregnancy, and parent-child communication about sexual abstinence) were positively associatedwith primary sexual abstinence (defined as yet to experience sexual debut), secondary sexual abstinence (defined as sexual abstinence subsequent to sexual debut) and reduced number of sex partners. The findings suggest that parental monitoring and control are important predictors of youth sexual behaviours and underscore the need to target parents and guardians in efforts to promote responsible sexual behaviours among adolescents. It is important to promote parent-child communication about sexual issues and empower parents and guardians to communicate effectively with their children and wards about sexual issues.

This wetland includes rivers, estuaries, mangroves, freshwater marshes, river marsh areas, water storage reservoirs, ponds and other seasonal flood areas. About 50 % of <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>are</b> directly dependent on wetland resources for subsistence and 70 % of animal protein in the country comes from fresh water fish. Moreover, 6 - 8 % revenue comes from only marsh areas. However, most of these wetlands of Bangladesh are being destroyed due to the high population pressure and extreme level of resource extraction. A case study was completed in the Swamp Ratargul forest with the aim of characterizing the functions, values and services of the forest. This study also explores the dependence criteria of the local human population, disruption and optimal management option for this forest. To complete this study, approaches were followed by qualitative and quantitative research. The rural population was engaged in participatory tools to collect socio-economic information. GIS were used to detect changes in land use over time. The results showed that the forest is located 35 m above mean sea level. During the rainy season, the average height of the forest floor water level is 4 m. This forest provides various products and ecosystem services, which {{plays a key role in}} the livelihood of the local population. But, degradation and disturbance of the forest are significant. The study showed that the high-density forest was reduced in 18. 40 hectares and the degraded area increased by 25. 53 ha from 2005 to 2015. However, the participatory forest management approach could be an effective tool for sustainable managementN/...|$|E

40|$|The National Council Licensure Examination for Registered Nurses (NCLEX) is the {{examination}} that nursing graduates must pass {{to attain the}} title of registered nurse and practice professionally. Each year {{a substantial number of}} nursing graduates are unable to enter the nursing profession because of failure on the NCLEX. Failure on this examination is a concern, especially since this country desperately needs nurses. Currently, the United States (U. S.) is faced with a nursing shortage. This shortage significantly impacts the U. S. health care system and requires urgent attention so that the health care needs of the <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>are</b> met. Ensuring success on the NCLEX is a complex role for nurse educators. It is vital that nurse educators attain knowledge about the predictors of NCLEX success so that they can design strategies and interventions to optimize student performance. Numerous studies are noted that examined the predictors for NCLEX success, reflecting great interest in this area. However, most investigated the academic predictors; few studies examined the nonacademic predictors. This study aimed to provide new knowledge to nurse educators to assist them to (a) identify interventions that will facilitate success on NCLEX, and (b) identify the strategic points for intervention during a nursing program. This quantitative study used Albert Bandura 2 ̆ 7 s Social Learning Theory (Bandura, 1977) as the theoretical framework to guide it, and investigated the academic, nonacademic, and self- efficacy variables that influence NCLEX passage. Academic variables focused on pre-nursing scores/grades and nursing course grades, while the nonacademic variables focused on personal and environmental factors/stressors and self-efficacy expectations. Seventy-nine (79) universities in the U. S. with accredited baccalaureate nursing programs were contacted to distribute recruitment materials to students. Data was collected via an email survey using Survey Monkey. com© (SM) and was collected at one point, after the participant took the NCLEX {{for the first time and}} received results. Logistic regression was the primary data analysis method used to identify the academic, nonacademic, and self-efficacy variables that influence NCLEX passage. A support vector machine (SVM) model was used as a secondary testing method. Correlation analysis using Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient was done to identify relationships existing among self-efficacy, academic, and nonacademic variables of NCLEX passage. Logistic regression findings revealed that the variables of significance were the medical-surgical grade, home and family events and responsibilities, and self-efficacy expectations. The final adjusted model revealed that the variables of significance were the medical-surgical grade and self-efficacy expectations. The SVM model showed that the medical-surgical grade and the pharmacology grade were the variables that could best predict NCLEX outcomes. Correlation analysis revealed that all academic variables showed a positive correlation with self-efficacy expectations and negative correlations between the nonacademic variables and self-efficacy expectations...|$|E
