Up and down all season as the Red Sox made use of his options, he got a call-up—prompted by Bill Mueller having back spasms in batting practice—one August day as he was in Pawtucket's clubhouse before a game. Without changing out of the same white <b>pants</b> <b>that</b> he wore for both Boston and Pawtucket home games, he packed his car, drove the 40 miles to Boston, walked into the Red Sox clubhouse, changed his jersey and cleats, and was ready to play.|$|E
25|$|The Flyers {{were the}} first and {{one of only two}} NHL teams (the Hartford Whalers being the other) to wear Cooperalls, hockey <b>pants</b> <b>that</b> extend from the waist to the ankles, in 1981–82.

25|$|The Redskins, after {{wearing white}} almost {{exclusively}} in the 1980s and 1990s, occasionally reverted from 2002–2009 to using their burgundy jerseys for home games during the latter weeks of the season, but would still wear white against the Dallas Cowboys. At the 2010 season and home opener on September 12, the team debuted a never-before-seen look, pairing the standard modern burgundy jerseys with the throwback style of gold <b>pants</b> <b>that</b> are reminiscent of the era of George Allen, the late father of then GM Bruce Allen, which had last {{been seen in the}} game vs. the Giants in 2007. In 2010, the team wore burgundy jerseys for all regular season home games, including six total sporting the aforementioned new look. For two home games, vs Green Bay and Tampa Bay, the team wore the standard white pants. In Philadelphia on October 3, with the Eagles wearing white at home, the team also wore white pants with their burgundy jerseys—and did the same when visiting Dallas in December. Away against Tennessee on November 21, they debuted another new look, matching the gold pants with the standard modern white jerseys for the first time ever; the same combination would be worn at the Giants two weeks later. In the other four away games, the team wore the white jerseys over the burgundy pants.|$|E
25|$|Their white jerseys have {{provided}} three basic color combinations, {{two of which}} have been previously alluded to in this article. The last combination consists of both white jerseys and <b>pants.</b> <b>That</b> particular combination surfaced in {{the first game of the}} 2003 season, when the team was coached by Steve Spurrier, during a nationally televised game against the New York Jets, which led many sports fans and Redskins faithful alike to point out that they had never seen that particular combination before. That year the Redskins wore it two more times. That look didn't appear again until midway through the 2005 season when the Redskins wore it in a road game against the St. Louis Rams. The Redskins won six straight games, including one in the playoffs against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, wearing that combination and the local media jokingly pointed out that the reason the Redskins were winning was their use of the white over white combination. In the NFC Divisional Playoff game against the eventual 2005 NFC Champion Seattle Seahawks, the Redskins wore the all-white uniforms, in hopes that they could keep their streak going; however, they lost 20–10. The Redskins continued to wear the white jerseys and white pants into the 2006 preseason. In the 2006 season, the Redskins started wearing black cleats, something that hadn't been done for quite a while. It was a surprise because they wore white cleats during the preseason. They would have to wear that color for the rest of the season, because the NFL usually asks teams to choose either black or white cleats to be worn throughout the season.|$|E
25|$|In Los Angeles, {{clothing}} {{is an important}} marker for Filipino street gangs and gang members. After 1965, Los Angeles {{became one of the}} largest cities of Filipino immigrants which saw a massive migration of Filipino youth. To combat Mexican gang members, Filipino gangs arose. The Satana gang fused styles of the Philippines with those of other fashions, particularly cholo fashion among the Latino neighborhoods of Los Angeles. Satana members used the cholo style of dress as inspiration, as well as the jefrox style popularized in Manila. The jefrox style was typically associated with counterculture elements such as long hair and Rock and roll music. The hybrid of both jefrox and cholo styles resulted in brushed hair, the use of nets and bandanas, open toed sandals, and loose fitting shirts. Some Satana members preferred wearing khakis with significant creases as an homage to the Manong generation of the 1920’s and 1930’s. These khakis were deliberately worn to showcase the unity that the younger generations had with the Filipino laborers of the 1930’s who originally came to California. By the eighties and nineties, Filipino gang members quickly adopted the cholo style of Latino youth. Satana gang members wore loose fitting, baggy <b>pants</b> <b>that</b> were fully black in conjunction with white t-shirts and pendletons. Styles of dress varied, however, even among gangs. The Satana homeboys of the mid-Wilshire and Temple areas of Los Angeles were Filipinos from all economic backgrounds, from lower class to upper class families. Members from a wealthier background were easily identifiable, as they wore luxury clothes reminiscent of the “Manong” generation. Overall, men and women sought to wear brand name clothing such as Tommy Hilfiger and Nautica, who had significant presence in the hip-hop fashion community in the nineties. Filipino men chose to wore ill-fitting clothes while Filipina women chose to wear more revealing clothing. Items such as clothing played a role in how Filipino youth identified themselves, especially in inner city areas.|$|E

2500|$|By the 1990s, new {{styles of}} close-trimmed pants legs made it {{possible}} for players to wear <b>pants</b> <b>that</b> ran clear to the shoetops, in lieu of the traditional knee-breeches style that had prevailed for generations.

Players such as Manny Ramirez have taken this fashion trend to an extreme, wearing loose-fitting pants whose legs nearly lap under the heels of the shoes. Some, such as Gary Sheffield, have even developed straps that hook under the cleats.
