However, his document also explains that his supplement cannot block caesium-137, {{because it does not}} contain a <b>protective</b> <b>dose</b> of stable caesium: Additionally, Busby alleges the Japanese Government is involved in a conspiracy to spread radioactive contamination throughout Japan, in an effort to hide cancer clusters from epidemiologists and thus hinder litigation (cancer clusters are typically statistically identified by comparison with an unexposed cohort). Gerry Thomas, professor of molecular pathology at the department of surgery and cancer at Imperial College, London, condemned the [...] "anti-radiation" [...] pills as useless and described the claims made by Busby as ludicrous. Ohtsura Niwa, professor at the Kyoto University Radiation Biology Center and CEO of BioMedics Japan, disagreed with Busby's contention that radiation is being deliberately spread throughout Japan. Niwa noted that the ownership of dosimeters in Japan is now widespread and if radioactive contamination was actively spread about, people would know. Niwa also agreed with Thomas, that mineral supplements cannot guard against strontium, uranium and plutonium radioisotopes. Similar mineral supplements are widely available in chemists in Tokyo, at 1/8th cost offered by Busby Laboratories.|$|E

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} the hepatic protective effects of 5 -methoxypsoralen (5 -MOP) {{and to learn}} if 5 -MOP causes hepatotoxicity at <b>protective</b> <b>doses.</b> METHODS: C 57 BL/ 6 J mice were administrated orally with 5 -MOP at doses of 12. 5, 25 and 50 mg/kg body weight respectively every morning for 4 d before given acetaminophen (APAP) subcutaneously at a dose of 500 mg/kg. The 5 -MOP alone group was treated with 5 -MOP orally at a dose of 50 mg/kg body weight for 4 d without APAP. Twenty-four hours after APAP administration, blood samples of mice were analyzed for serum enzyme alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, and malondialdehyde (MDA), reduced glutathione (GSH) and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) of liver tissues were measured and histopathologic changes of the liver were observed. RESULTS: Compared with the vehicle control group, the serum levels (IU/L) of ALT, AST and LDH were all increased significantly in APAP group (8355 1; 3940 vs 30 1; 21, P 0. 05; 0. 59 1; 0. 07 vs 2. 15 1; 1. 07, P 0. 05; 5. 330 1; 0. 421 vs 3. 306 1; 0. 282, P < 0. 05; 6. 180 1; 0. 212 vs 3. 306 1; 0. 282, P < 0. 05). In the group treated with 5 -MOP but without APAP, the serum enzyme levels, the liver histopathologic manifestation, and the values of MDA and GSH/GSSG ratio were all normal.

40|$|The {{immunogenicity}} {{and safety}} of purified cholera toxin (CT), its B subunit, and a crude culture filtrate of toxigenic Vibrio cholerae (CrT) were compared in dogs immunized orally and challenged with virulent V. cholerae. CT and CrT caused marked protection in two- or three-dose regimens. Protection due to CT occurred only with doses that caused transient, sometimes severe, diarrhea in most dogs; this protection was proportional to the peak antitoxin response in jejunal mucosa and lasted at least 15 weeks. In contrast, minimum protective doses of CrT contained much less cholera toxin, caused very mild diarrhea in only 21 % of the dogs, and evoked protection that was greater than predicted from the modest jejunal antitoxin response. B subunit caused smaller jejunal antitoxin responses than did similar doses of CT and was poorly protective, the 50 % <b>protective</b> <b>dose</b> being > 40 -fold {{greater than that of}} CT. Two observations indicated that protection due to CrT involved synergy between antibacterial and antitoxic immune responses. First, the 50 % <b>protective</b> <b>dose</b> of CrT was 24 -fold and > 36 -fold smaller than the 50 % protective doses of its CT and non-CT antigenic components, respectively, when tested separately. Second, protection was greater in CrT-immunized dogs than in CT-immunized dogs for a given mucosal antitoxin response. Low doses of CrT evoked serotype-specific protection, indicating that the serotype-specific O somatic antigen contributed significatly to antibacterial protection. These results suggest that a simple, effective, nonliving oral vaccine for cholera based on combined antibacterial and antitoxic immunity can probably be achieved. However, further studies are needed to determine how a protective antitoxic response can be evoked without causing diarrhea during immunization...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{estimate}} the relative dose potency of salbutamol Turbuhaler compared with salbutamol pressurized metered dose inhaler (pMDI) with respect to the protective effect against methacholine bronchoconstriction. Twenty-three asthmatic subjects with stable asthma participated in the study. Baseline forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1) was 70 % or more of predicted, and baseline methacholine provocative concentration causing a 20 % fall in FEV 1 (PC 20) was 4 mg/mL or less. The design was randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, crossover and placebo controlled and was conducted over seven study days. On each study day, the subjects inhaled 50 µg or 100 µg of salbutamol via Turbuhaler, 100 µg, 200 µg, 400 µg or 800 µg of salbutamol via pMDI, or placebo in randomized order. PC 20 was determined 30 mins after inhalation. Increasing doses of salbutamol pMDI increased the PC 20 in a dose-dependent fashion from 3. 9 mg/mL after placebo to 13. 3 mg/mL after pMDI 100 µg, 19. 0 mg/mL after 200 µg, 32. 6 mg/mL after 400 µg, and 35. 1 mg/mL after 800 µg. The half-maximum response dose for pMDI (ED 50) was 104 µg. Salbutamol Turbuhaler 50 µg increased the PC 20 to 10. 0 mg/mL and 100 µg to 12. 6 mg/mL. Salbutamol pMDI 200 µg provided significantly greater protection to methacholine than pMDI 100 µg or Turbuhaler 100 µg and significantly less protection than pMDI 400 µg (P< 0. 05). This study demonstrates that the relative <b>protective</b> <b>dose</b> potency of inhaled beta-agonists can be determined by comparing their effects on methacholine airway responsiveness. The estimated relative <b>protective</b> <b>dose</b> potency for salbutamol Turbuhaler in comparison with pMDI was 1. 38 (95 % CI 0. 67 to 2. 87) at 50 µg and was 0. 96 (95 % CI 0. 56 to 1. 64) at 100 µg...|$|E

The greatest potency was observed against Haemophilus spp. and Neisseria spp., with MIC 90 s of 0. 06 and 0. 016 micrograms/ml, respectively. Broad-spectrum activity was also observed against anaerobes, with MIC 90 s ranging from 0. 125 to 0. 5 micrograms/ml among the species tested.

40|$|Oncogenic {{transformation}} of postmitotic neurons triggers cell death, but {{the identity of}} genes critical for degeneration remain unclear. The antitumor antibiotic mithramycin prolongs survival of mouse models of Huntington's disease in vivo and inhibits oxidative stress-induced death in cortical neurons in vitro. We had correlated protection by mithramycin with its ability to bind to GC-rich DNA and globally displace Sp 1 family transcription factors. To understand how antitumor drugs prevent neurodegeneration, here we use structure–activity relationships of mithramycin analogs to discover that selective DNA-binding inhibition of the drug is necessary for its neuroprotective effect. We identify several genes (Myc, c-Src, Hif 1 α, and p 21 waf 1 /cip 1) involved in neoplastic transformation, whose altered expression correlates with <b>protective</b> <b>doses</b> of mithramycin or its analogs.

40|$|Certain new fluoroquinolones {{have high}} {{activity}} against enterococci. Against Enterococcus faecalis (n = 18), MICs at which 90 % of the isolates were inhibited {{were as follows}} (in micrograms per milliliter) : clinafloxacin, 0. 125; CI- 990, 0. 5; and PD 138312, 0. 25 (compared with 1 microgram/ml for ciprofloxacin and 2 micrograms/ml for ofloxacin). Strains producing beta-lactamase or that were vancomycin resistant or resistant to high-level gentamicin were not quinolone cross-resistant. The drugs were bactericidal and were unaffected by 50 % human serum. Oral efficacies (in milligrams per kilogram of body weight for 50 % <b>protective</b> <b>doses)</b> in lethal mouse infections with quinolone-susceptible strains were 4. 3 to 24 for clinafloxacin, 7. 2 to 39 for CI- 990, 7. 2 to 76 for PD 138312, and 41 to > 100 for ciprofloxacin; when the drugs were given subcutaneously, the order was similar and values ranged from 1. 1 to 12. 5.

40|$|In a dose {{response}} {{study in}} foxes, the median <b>protective</b> <b>dose</b> of ERA BHK 21 vaccine in a blister pack bait was 10 (6. 0) tissue culture infective doses (TCID) /mL, while artificially aged baits with titers of 10 (6. 3) TCID/mL induced seroconversion in 78 % of foxes. There {{was no significant}} difference in the development of antibodies in foxes receiving 1, 2 or 3 mL volumes of vaccine in the bait. When baits were exposed to the elements and fed to foxes over a 21 day period, 85 % of the animals seroconverted. Age, sex and the way in which the vaccine container was contacted did not appear to be factors in the responses of these animals. Juvenile foxes, approximately six months of age, were marked more readily with the tetracycline bait marker than older animals. Approximately 25 % of foxes did not appear to respond well to vaccination and the titer of the vaccine was a critical factor in producing seroconversion in these animals...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY Using the hypoxic (FiO, = 0. 05) {{mouse model}} as {{originally}} described, the survival time follow-ing pretreatment with physostigmlne was examined. Tbe maximum Increase in arrival time was 87 % follow-ing a physostigmine dose of 0. 4 mg/kg. This increase was {{considerably less than}} that previously reported for this drug in a hypoxic mouse study wherein the standard method for exposing mice to hypoxia was altered. We speculate that this alteration in methodology resulted in small variations in FiO, sufficient {{to account for the}} differences between these studies. Stroke, Vol 11, No 2, 1980 PHYSOSTIGMINE has recently been reported to provide cerebral protection in the hypoxic (FiO, = 0. 05) mouse. 1 At the maximally <b>protective</b> <b>dose</b> (0. 3 mg/kg) survival was increased by 542 % (sur-vival time in controls was 4. 3 min) and 4 of 14 animals survived more than one hour.

40|$|Sera {{obtained}} from human volunteers at 6 weeks after vaccination with highly purified type III polysaccharide antigen prepared {{from a group}} B Streptococcus, strain M 732, were found to protect neonatal rats from otherwise lethal infection by the homologous strain. The specific antibody content of the sera, expressed in micrograms of antibody protein per milliliter, was determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in conjunction with quantitative precipitin analysis. For two sera studied in detail, the <b>protective</b> <b>dose</b> of antibody for 50 % of the animals was 0. 4 micrograms. Immune serum {{obtained from}} a volunteer who received type II polysaccharide vaccine was not protective against type III infection. Absorption of anti-type III serum by quantitative precipitation of antibodies with type III polysaccharide completely removed the passive protective activity of the serum. The results show that antibodies induced in humans by purified type II polysaccharide give serotype-specific protection in an animal model of neonatal infection...|$|E
40|$|Hypoxia–ischemia (H/I) in the {{premature}} infant leads to white matter injury termed periventricular leukomalacia (PVL), {{the leading cause}} of subsequent neurological deficits. Glutamatergic excitotoxicity in white matter oligodendrocytes (OLs) mediated by cell surface glutamate receptors (GluRs) of the AMPA subtype has been demonstrated as one factor in this injury. Recently, {{it has been shown that}} rodent OLs also express functional NMDA GluRs (NMDARs), and overactivation of these receptors can mediate excitotoxic OL injury. Here we show that preterm human developing OLs express NMDARs during the PVL period of susceptibility, presenting a potential therapeutic target. The expression pattern mirrors that seen in the immature rat. Furthermore, the uncompetitive NMDAR antagonist memantineattenuatesNMDA-evokedcurrentsindevelopingOLsinsituincerebralwhitematterofimmaturerats.

40|$|Three {{derivatives}} of oleandomycin {{in which}} the C"- 4 hydroxyl moiety was replaced {{for the first time}} with a nitrogen functionality have been compared with erythromycin base and oleandomycin base. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of these derivatives for 90 % of a group of clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus were one-half to one-fourth those of erythromycin. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of the experimental macrolides for 50 % of a group of S. aureus isolates resistant to greater than 12. 5 micrograms of erythromycin per ml ranged from 0. 2 to 0. 39 micrograms/ml. The activities of these experimental compounds were equivalent to the activities of erythromycin against Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacteroides fragilis, and Haemophilus influenzae isolates. In general, erythromycin was more active against Streptococcus species. Each experimental macrolide was superior to erythromycin in inhibiting RNA-directed, cell-free polypeptide synthesis. The three experimental compounds were markedly more active than erythromycin base after oral administration to mice infected with S. aureus. The 50 % <b>protective</b> <b>doses</b> of the experimental compounds ranged from 27. 4 to 45. 7 mg/kg; that of erythromycin was approximately 100 mg/kg...|$|R
40|$|The aim is {{to study}} in {{experiment}} {{the influence of the}} bacterial peptidoglycane manufactured from L. bulgaricus, and synthetic peptidoglycane-glycopin (analog of muramyldipeptide) for display of the basic properties of the corpuscular and subcellular pertussis vaccines - protective, toxic and sensibilizing ones. It has been determined that the influence of the investigated immunomodulators (IM) on the organism of the experimental animals depend upon the correlation of the IM doses and pertussis antigen and also upon the kind of the pertussis antigen. It has been shown that in certain doses the bacterial and synthetic IM not only increase the protective action of the pertussis vaccines but decrease the display of the toxic and sensibilizing properties in these preparations. The data about advantage of applying glycopine as an immunopotentiating component of the subcellular pertussis vaccine have been obtained by means of comparing action of the bacterial peptidoglycane of the synthetic glycopine.
