50|$|After a {{continuous}} period {{of growth in}} 1968 ERNI became the worldwide first manufacturer to produce connectors {{in compliance with the}} new standard DIN 41612. This standard has, by today, evolved into the most widely accepted standard for industrial <b>PCB</b> <b>connectors</b> in the world.|$|R
5000|$|JST {{manufactures}} a {{large number}} of series (families) of <b>connectors.</b> [...] The <b>PCB</b> (wire-to-board) <b>connectors</b> are available in top (vertical) or side (horizontal) entry, and through-hole or surface-mount.|$|R
5000|$|From 2003-06 {{he was one}} of {{the architects}} of Massachusetts health care reform, also known as [...] "Romneycare". [...] In 2006 he became an inaugural member of the Health <b>Connector</b> <b>Board,</b> the main {{implementing}} body for that effort. The same year, he was named the 19th most powerful person in health care in the United States by Modern Healthcare magazine.|$|R
5000|$|PCB pins are {{soldered}} {{directly to}} {{a printed circuit board}} and not to a wire. Traditionally through hole plated (THP) board style pins were used (print) but increasingly gull wing surface mount (SMD) connections are used, although the latter frequently exhibit solder pad contact problems when exposed to mechanical stress. These connectors are frequently mounted at a right angle to the PCB, allowing a cable to be plugged into the edge of the PCB assembly. While angled connectors traditionally occupied significant room on the <b>PCB,</b> flat SMD <b>connector</b> variants are produced by various manufacturers. Electrical/mechanical anchor points (often soldered) for the connector shell and locking screws are also provided, but significantly differ in their position between US and EU connector variants, so that the correct type must be used unless the PCB was designed to accept them both. The <b>PCB</b> <b>connectors</b> are available in variants with either inch or metric pitch of the soldered contacts. Tolerances are typically large enough to allow the mounting of the smaller connectors regardless of the pitch variant used, but this does not hold true for the larger connectors.|$|R
50|$|Similar in {{physical}} appearance to the 1530/C2N models is the Commodore 1531, {{made for the}} Commodore 16 and Plus/4 series computers. This had a Mini-DIN connector {{in place of the}} <b>PCB</b> edge <b>connector.</b> This could be used with a C64/128 via an adaptor, which was supplied by Commodore with some units.|$|R
40|$|A fully {{integrated}} solution for rejecting the interference caused by wireless {{local area network}} (WLAN) transmissions in the 4. 9 - 5. 825 GHz band for ultrawideband (UWB) receivers is presented. Front-end prototypes implemented in a low cost 0. 35 μm SiGe BiCMOS technology are used as a test vehicle to assess the effectiveness of the presented approach. The proposed blocker altering technique mitigates the gain desensitization, third-order intermodulation distortion and second-order intermodulation distortion by as much as 9. 8 dB, 7. 9 dB and 6 dB, respectively. At a power consumption of only 49. 2 mW, the maximum receiver conversion gain and the minimum double side-band NF measured at the <b>PCB</b> <b>connectors</b> are about 22 dB and 5. 5 dB, respectively, with an input match of - 10 dB over the 3. 1 - 8 GHz band...|$|R

5000|$|The 104 Form Factor {{is defined}} to be 3.550 xx 3.775 in, with {{mounting}} holes at all {{four corners of}} the board. The specifications also allow for a 0.5 in area beyond the edge of the <b>PCB</b> for I/O <b>connectors.</b> Some PC/104 products have oversized PCBs which extended into the I/O connector area. The extended PCB [...] "wings" [...] is not addressed in the specification, generally does not cause mechanical issues as long as the overall <b>PCB</b> + I/O <b>connector</b> overhang is within the maximum allowable dimensions of 4.550 xx 4.393 in.|$|R

50|$|Both {{versions}} use the Actel FPGA, a {{flash memory}} (size depends on version) and a cable connector for the cables which are to be soldered onto the Gamecube mainboard. The Pro version also includes a flex cable connector, a highspeed USB controller, a USB <b>connector</b> <b>board</b> and an integrated status LED.Since there is a connector for the cables integrated to the chip {{there is no need}} to solder the cables onto the chip, eliminating accidental burning of the chip. There are six wires which are to be soldered onto the Gamecube mainboard, making the Qoob chip installation difficult for some users.|$|R
50|$|Perhaps {{the biggest}} {{addition}} to G450 was that Matrox moved the previously external second RAMDAC, {{for the second}} monitor connector (DualHead), into the G450 chip itself. RAMDAC speeds were still different though, with the primary running at an excellent 360 MHz, but the secondary running at only 230 MHz. This meant that the primary monitor could run much higher resolutions and refresh rates than the secondary. This {{was the same as}} G400. The G450 also had native support for TMDS signaling, and thus DVI, but this was not a standard issue <b>connector.</b> <b>Boards</b> shipped with dual analog VGA connectors.|$|R
50|$|The first {{motherboard}} {{that was}} produced under this specification is called EPIA-P710. It {{was released in}} December 2008. It is 10 xx 7.2 cm and 12 layers deep. The operating temperature range is from 0°C to about 50°C. The operating humidity level (relative and non-condensing) can be from 0% to about 95%. It uses a 1 GHz VIA C7-M processor, a VIA VX800 chip set, and is RoHS compliant. It has onboard VGA video-out. Gigabit Ethernet is supplied by VIA's VT6122, but requires a <b>connector</b> <b>board.</b> HD 5.1 channel audio is provided by a VIA VT1708B chip.|$|R

40|$|A new small {{full bridge}} module for MMCC {{research}} is presented. Each {{full bridge converter}} cell is a single small (65 × 30 mm) multilayer PCB with two low voltage high current (22 V, 40 A) integrated half bridge ICs and the necessary isolated control signals and auxiliary power supply (2500 V isolation). All devices are surface mount, minimising cell height (4 mm) and parasitic inductance. Each converter cell can be physically stacked with <b>PCB</b> <b>connectors</b> propagating the control signals and inter-cell power connections. Many cells can be trivially stacked to create a large multilevel converter leg with isolated auxiliary power and control signals. Any of the MMCC family members is then easily formed. With a change in placement of stacking connector, a parallel connection of bridges is also possible. Operation of a nine level parallel full bridge is demonstrated at 12 V and 384 kHz switching frequency delivering a 30 W 2 kHz sinewave into a resistive load. A number of new applications for this novel module aside from MMCC development are listed...|$|R
50|$|October 2006 saw a minor rebranding: the X-Fi XtremeMusic edition, {{which was}} in fact a highly capable gaming card, as it offers {{hardware}} decoding and EAX support, was replaced with the XtremeGamer model. The revised model featured half-width <b>PCB,</b> non-gold-plated <b>connectors,</b> optical out instead of the digital out and digital I/O module jack, and lacked the connector for users wishing to purchase a separate X-Fi I/O box. Functionality is otherwise the same.|$|R

50|$|The Datasette {{has only}} one {{connection}} cable with a <b>PCB</b> edge <b>connector</b> at the computer end. All input/output signals to the datasette are all digital and so all digital to analog and vice versa is handled within the unit. Power is also included in this cable. The pinout is ground, +5 V DC, motor, read, write, key-sense. The sense signal monitors the play, rewind, and fast-forward buttons, but cannot differentiate between them. A mechanical interlock prevented any two of them being pressed at the same time. Unregulated 6.36 V DC is used to power the cassette motor.|$|R

40|$|An FPGA-based Linux {{test-bed}} {{was constructed}} {{for the purpose}} of measuring its sensitivity to single-event upsets. The test-bed consists of two ML 410 Xilinx development boards connected using a 124 -pin custom <b>connector</b> <b>board.</b> The Design Under Test (DUT) consists of the “hard core” PowerPC, running the Linux OS and several peripherals implemented in “soft” (programmable) logic. Faults were injected via the Internal Configuration Access Port (ICAP). The experiments performed here demonstrate that the Linux-based system was sensitive to 199, 584 or about 1. 4 percent of all tested bits. Each sensitive bit in the bit-stream is mapped to the resource and user-module to which it configures. A density metric for comparing the reliability of modules within the system is presented. Using this density metric, we found that the most sensitive user module in the design was the PowerPC's direct connections to the DDR 2 memory controller...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{progress}} in patterned microelectrode manufacturing technology and microfluidics {{has opened the}} way to a large variety of cellular and molecular biosensor-based applications. In this extremely diverse and rapidly expanding landscape, silicon-based technologies occupy a special position, given their statute of mature, consolidated, and highly accessible areas of development. Within the present work we report microfabrication procedures and workflows for 3 D patterned gold-plated microelectrode arrays (MEA) of different shapes (pyramidal, conical and high aspect ratio), and we provide a detailed characterization of their physical features during all the fabrication steps to have in the end a reliable technology. Moreover, the electrical performances of MEA silicon chips mounted on standardized <b>connector</b> <b>boards</b> via ultrasound wire-bonding have been tested using non-destructive electrochemical methods: linear sweep and cyclic voltammetry, impedance spectroscopy. Further, an experimental recording chamber package suitable for in vitro electrophysiology experiments has been realized using custom-design electronics for electrical stimulus delivery and local field potential recording, included in a complete electrophysiology setup, and the experimental structures have been tested on newborn rat hippocampal slices, yielding similar performance compared to commercially available MEA equipments...|$|R

40|$|The MuCell ® {{injection}} molding process is being applied by the world’s leading electronic connector manufacturers as a core plastics manufacturing technology to obtain (1) faster product development capability, (2) operating and capital cost savings and (3) productivity improvements. The MuCell {{injection molding}} process results in electronic connector components that have less residual stress, superior conformance to mold dimensions, and improved dimensional stability at extreme operating and soldering temperatures compared to conventionally molded parts. The MuCell microcellular foam injection molding process uses supercritical fluids (SCF) of inert gases, (nitrogen or carbon dioxide) to create evenly distributed and uniformly sized microscopic cells throughout a polymer. The MuCell process enhances thin-wall connector design, improves processing efficiency, and reduces product costs. Driven by compelling cost savings opportunities, {{a transition from}} conventional molding to MuCell microcellular foam processing is occurring within an extensive range of connection systems including wiring harness connectors, electronic control module headers, IC sockets including DIMM, DDR DIMM, and RIMM, fine pitch <b>connectors,</b> <b>board</b> level <b>connectors,</b> and PCMCIA connectors, and DIN connectors. The MuCell process has been deployed worldwide across an extensive range of automotive, business machinery, and industrial markets as a strategic cost savings technology...|$|R
5000|$|Following the {{dissolution}} of an Organization Task Force after an unsuccessful attempt to unite the national agencies in a single structure and vision, CBAmerica was reorganized as “a covenantal fellowship of Regional Associations of Conservative Baptist churches, which have joined together {{to make the most}} of the God-given strengths of each member Region for a common purpose.” [...] In 2005 new bylaws were adopted whereby regional associations of local churches are the only members of CBAmerica; the local churches themselves are members of the regional associations and no longer have any direct participation in the national organization. The regional directors and their boards, as representatives of their member churches, are organizationally and relationally bound through the Covenant of the Regions. [...] The regional directors comprise the CBAmerica Board, representing the interests of the regions and the member churches of the regions. CBAmerica is led by a leadership team consisting of a Catalyst (Board Chairman), a Facilitator and a <b>Connector</b> (<b>Board</b> Secretary/Treasurer).

50|$|There are no {{official}} standards for JTAG adapter physical <b>connectors.</b> Development <b>boards</b> usually include a header to support preferred development tools; {{in some cases}} they include multiple such headers, because they need to support multiple such tools. For example, a microcontroller, FPGA, and ARM application processor rarely shares tools, so a development board using all of those components might have three or more headers. Production boards may omit the headers; or when space is tight, just provide JTAG signal access using test points.|$|R
