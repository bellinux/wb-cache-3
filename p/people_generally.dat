5|$|Although kings, {{rulers and}} {{powerful}} {{people have always}} been able to pay for entertainment to be provided for them and in many cases have paid for public entertainment, <b>people</b> <b>generally</b> have made their own entertainment or when possible, attended a live performance. Technological developments in the 20th century meant that entertainment could be produced independently of the audience, packaged and sold on a commercial basis by an entertainment industry. Sometimes referred to as show business, the industry relies on business models to produce, market, broadcast or otherwise distribute many of its traditional forms, including performances of all types. The industry became so sophisticated that its economics became a separate area of academic study.|$|E

25|$|Creativity techniques: Heuristic {{methods to}} {{facilitate}} creativity {{in a person}} {{or a group of}} <b>people.</b> <b>Generally,</b> most creativity techniques use associations between the goal (or the problem), the current state (which may be an imperfect solution to the problem), and some stimulus (possibly selected randomly).

25|$|In pre-modern Denmark, <b>people</b> <b>generally</b> defecated on {{farmland}} {{or other}} places where the human waste could be collected as fertilizer. The Old Norse language had several terms for referring to outhouses, including garðhús (yard house), náð-/náða-hús (house of rest), and annat hús (the other house). In general, toilets were functionally non-existent in rural Denmark until the 18th century.|$|E

They had limited gardening, as recent findings suggest they included the sunflower which predates the large-scale Mesoamerican influence in the Carolinas and Virginia.|$|E
25|$|The Tabernacle also {{exhibited}} similarities with Mount Sinai.

Such outcomes include: improved health and mental health, greater longevity, lower rates of infant mortality, experience fewer stressful life events, and less frequently the victims of violent crimes However, research suggests that wealth has a smaller impact on SWB than <b>people</b> <b>generally</b> think, even though higher incomes do correlate substantially with life satisfaction reports.|$|E

These Svobodniki (Russian: free <b>people)</b> <b>generally</b> refused {{to send their children}} to government-run schools. The governments of Saskatchewan and later British Columbia did not heed reports by sociologists to appease the concerns of parents, and chose to legally charge many of the parents for not sending the children to school.|$|E
25|$|Kidney {{transplantation}} is a life-extending procedure. The typical {{patient will}} live 10 to 15 years longer with a kidney transplant than if kept on dialysis. The increase in longevity is greater for younger patients, but even 75-year-old recipients (the oldest group {{for which there}} is data) gain an average four more years of life. <b>People</b> <b>generally</b> have more energy, a less restricted diet, and fewer complications with a kidney transplant than if they stay on conventional dialysis.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{difficulties}} of the optimistic bias is that people know more about themselves than they do about others. While individuals know how to think about themselves as a single person, they still think of others as a generalized group, which leads to biased estimates and inabilities to sufficiently understand their target or comparison group. Likewise, when making judgments and comparisons about their risk compared to others, <b>people</b> <b>generally</b> ignore the average person, but primarily focus on their own feelings and experiences.|$|E

25|$|Longevity myths are traditions about {{long-lived}} <b>people</b> (<b>generally</b> supercentenarians), {{either as}} {{individuals or groups}} of people, and practices that have been believed to confer longevity, but for which scientific evidence {{does not support the}} ages claimed or the reasons for the claims.

25|$|Unlike {{most people}} in East Asia, Japanese <b>people</b> <b>generally</b> do not {{celebrate}} Lunar New Year (it having been supplanted by the Western New Year's Day, on January 1, in the late 19th century); although many Chinese residents in Japan, {{as well as some}} shrines and temples for religious purposes, still celebrate Lunar New Year in parallel with the Western New Year. In Yokohama Chinatown, Japan's biggest Chinatown, tourists from all over Japan come to enjoy the festival. Similar for Nagasaki's Lantern Festival that is based in Nagasaki Chinatown.

50|$|European dress changed {{gradually}} in {{the years}} 400 to 1100. People in many countries dressed differently depending on whether they identified with the old Romanised population, or the new invading populations such as Franks, Anglo-Saxons, and Visigoths. Men of the invading <b>peoples</b> <b>generally</b> wore short tunics, with belts, and visible trousers, hose or leggings. The Romanised populations, and the Church, remained faithful to the longer tunics of Roman formal costume.|$|R

The lex Sempronia can be seen as a direct reaction to the fate of Tiberius Gracchus and his followers, who were tried and sentenced in a special tribunal with powers of capital punishment.|$|E
25|$|Conflict {{about the}} waters of the Jordan River was a {{contributing}} factor to the Six-Day War when, starting in 1965, Syria attempted to divert some of its headwaters in collaboration with Lebanon and Jordan. The diversion works would have reduced the water availability for Israel's carrier by about 35%, and Israel's overall water supply by about 11%. In April 1967 Israel conducted air raids into Syria to halt this work, and two months later the Six Day War followed. The use of Jordan River's water was cited as a cause of the war by Ariel Sharon, who said, <b>People</b> <b>generally</b> regard June 5, 1967, as the day the Six Day War began. That is the official date, but in reality it started {{two and a half years}} earlier on the day Israel decided to act against the diversion of the Jordan River.|$|E
25|$|A {{meta-analysis}} of 208 experiments {{found that the}} mere-exposure effect is robust and reliable, with an effect size of r=0.26. This analysis found that the effect is strongest when unfamiliar stimuli are presented briefly. Mere exposure typically reaches its maximum effect within 10–20 presentations, and some studies even show that liking may decline after a longer series of exposures. For example, <b>people</b> <b>generally</b> like a song more after they have heard it a few times, but many repetitions can reduce this preference. A delay between exposure and the measurement of liking actually tends to increase {{the strength of the}} effect. The effect is weaker on children, and for drawings and paintings as compared to other types of stimuli. One social psychology experiment showed that exposure to people we initially dislike makes us dislike them even more.|$|E
