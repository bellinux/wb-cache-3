40|$|For the {{calibration}} of gas chromatographic {{measurements of}} {{volatile organic compounds}} in ambient air samples, standard gas mixtures at low concentrations are needed with high accuracy. For this purpose we developed a diffusion device combined with a dynamic dilution system. Pure liquid compounds are placed in glass vials. They diffuse through a capillary {{on top of each}} vial into a diffusion chamber flushed with synthetic air. In an additional dynamic dilution step the final concentration is adjusted with a flow of <b>purified</b> <b>synthetic</b> <b>air</b> to typical mixing ratios between several ppt (v/v) and ppb (v/v). The diffusion rates are determined from the mass loss of the vials. Extensive tests over 21 months showed that the diffusion rates varied little with time, between 1. 4 % and 3. 1 %, depending on the compound. The system proved to be suitable for compounds {{with a wide range of}} boiling points, from 305 K (1, 1 -dichlorethene) to 418 K (1, 2 -dimethylbenzene) The diffusion device was applied to a gas chromatographic system with a flame ionization detector and an electron-capture detector. The linearity of the diffusion device was checked with different standard mixtures with mixing ratios ranging from 0. 32 ppt (v/v) (tribromomethane) to 1353 ppt (v/v) (n-pentane). The regression analysis of peak area versus concentration showed excellent agreement among the standards for each compound with correlation coefficients (r(2)) between 0. 9826 and 0. 9998. The temporal stability of the diffusion device was determined from more than 270 measurements of one standard mixture. The reproducibility of the peak areas ranged between 2. 2 % and 12. 7 % depending on the compound. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

The temperature dependence of the fluorescence intensity was determined in the range 383 â€“ 640 K at a constant pressure of 1 bar <b>synthetic</b> <b>air.</b> For 248 nm excitation, a marked fall in the fluorescence signal was observed, whereas for 277 nm excitation the corresponding decrease was only half as strong.

These results are consistent with the observation of a red shift of the absorption spectra (9 nm) over this temperature range.

Severe internal sulfidation was observed underneath the chromium-rich oxide scale on Rene 80, leading to breakaway oxidation after longer exposure times.
