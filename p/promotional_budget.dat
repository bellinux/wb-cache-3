500|$|After the show-stealing performance, Reprise Records {{agreed to}} {{distribute}} Are You Experienced. However, despite the increased awareness that the Experience's performance at Monterey provided, the second Experience single, [...] "Purple Haze"/"The Wind Cries Mary", {{released in the}} US on August 16, 1967, stalled at number 65 on the Billboard Hot 100. Although the single performed poorly in the US charts, its presence on underground FM radio stations, which were transitioning from easy listening and classical music formats to album cuts, significantly aided sales of the LP. Reprise allocated a $20,000 <b>promotional</b> <b>budget</b> for the LP, which was an unprecedented amount for an unproven artist. Released in the US on August 23 by Reprise, Are You Experienced reached number five on the Billboard 200. The album remained on Billboards album chart for 106 weeks, 27 {{of those in the}} Top 40. The North American edition of Are You Experienced featured a new cover by Karl Ferris and a new track list, with Reprise omitting [...] "Red House", [...] "Remember", and [...] "Can You See Me", and including the first three A-sides omitted from the UK release: [...] "Hey Joe", [...] "Purple Haze", and [...] "The Wind Cries Mary".|$|E

2500|$|The {{film was}} re-released in 1952, {{becoming}} one of the media events of that year. Time magazine named it [...] "Movie of the Year". The film's studio RKO tried an experimental reissue of King Kong in the Midwest United States in 1952. In an unprecedented move they committed most of King Kong's <b>promotional</b> <b>budget</b> to television spots. The re-release was an enormous success, with the film attracting triple the usual business in its markets. This showed that television was a powerful tool for promotion. King Kong generated more box office receipts than the original 1933 release had. Theatre owners named it Picture of the Year. It was at this time that King Kong acquired its reputation as a popular culture phenomenon. The two most significant spinoffs of King Kong in this period were Mighty Joe Young (1949) and Godzilla (1954). Godzilla was inspired by King Kong's popularity in Japan. Godzilla revived and reconfigured parts of the King Kong story more powerfully than any other spinoff has. RKO theatrically re-released King Kong for the last time in 1956.|$|E

However, Corporal Punishment caught the attention of the small, independent Shifty label.

50|$|Since it is {{difficult}} to predict how successful a company's promotion will end up becoming, unexpected costs can easily accumulate if both the cost and success of the promotion are underestimated.

5000|$|Promotions are the on-air {{equivalent}} of lotteries for listeners. <b>Promotional</b> <b>budgets</b> usually run about $1 per listener per year. In a large market, a successful radio station can pay a full-time director of promotions, and run several lotteries per month of vacations, automobiles and other prizes. Lottery items are often bartered from advertisers, allowing both companies to charge full prices at wholesale costs. For example, cruising companies often have unused capacity, and when given the choice, prefer {{to pay their}} bills by bartering cruise vacations. Since the ship will sail in any case, bartered vacations cost the cruise company little or nothing. The promotion itself advertises the company providing the prize. The FCC has defined a lottery as “any game, contest or promotion that combines the elements of prize, chance and consideration.” ...|$|R
2500|$|At {{the end of}} the 1960s, Grain Belt was the 18th-largest brewing {{company in}} the US, and a major force in the Midwest. Primary {{competitors}} up to this point had been local rivals, Theodore Hamm and Jacob Schmidt, both in St. Paul, Gluek Brewing Company, in Minneapolis, Cold Spring Brewing Company in Cold Spring, Minnesota and a few other regional brewers. Business began to decline as better-capitalized national brewing companies such as Anheuser-Busch, Schlitz and Miller began targeting the markets of regional brewers like Grain Belt. These companies swooped into markets, often advertising heavily, dropping prices and forcing regional brands like Grain Belt into the background since the smaller regional brewers were unable to match the big brewer's advertising and <b>promotional</b> <b>budgets.</b> [...] In 1975, stockholders decided to sell the Grain Belt company to area businessman Irwin Jacobs, and operation ceased by {{the end of the}} year.|$|R

40|$|Managers and {{academics}} often think of price promotions merely as incentives that entice consumers to accept offers {{that they might}} not have considered otherwise. Yet the prospect of paying a lower price for a product of given quality can also discourage deliberation, in a sense "dumbing down" the purchase encounter by making it less consequential. The authors examine this possibility in a dual-system theory of consumer behavior. Specifically, they argue that price promotion lowers a consumer's motivation to exert mental effort, in which case purchase decisions are guided less by extensive information processing and more by a quicker, easier, strong conditioner of preference: affect. Field data from a large daily deal company and four controlled experiments support this idea and document its implications primarily for product choice, in turn providing insight into the form and cause of brand switching that manufacturers and retailers can leverage to improve the allocation of <b>promotional</b> <b>budgets</b> and category management...|$|R

Upon discovering no promotion or marketing budget had been set for the album after the release of the first two singles, Johnson left MCA Records and the album was left unreleased during a 12-month postponement until it was issued later in 1991. With limited promotion and a half-hearted release, the album failed to chart in the UK. The album was Johnson's last studio album until 1999's Soulstream as he discovered he was HIV positive in November 1991, which resulted in him withdrawing from music. During the 1990s period, he would write his autobiography A Bone in My Flute, release two singles and work primarily as a painter.|$|R

40|$|Cooperative (co-op) {{advertising}} plays {{a significant}} role in marketing programs in conventional supply chains and makes up the majority of <b>promotional</b> <b>budgets</b> in many product lines for both manufacturers and retailers. We develop three strategic models for determining equilibrium marketing and investment effort levels for a manufacturer and a retailer in a two-member supply chain. Especially, we address the impact of brand name investments, local advertising, and sharing policy on co-op advertising programs in these models. The first model offers a formal normative approach for analyzing the traditional co-op advertising program where the manufacturer is the leader and the retailer is a follower. The second model provides a further analysis on this manufacturer-dominated relationship. The third model incorporates the recent market trend of retailing power shifts from manufacturers to retailers to analyze efficiencies of co-op advertising programs. We examine the effect of supply chain on the differences in profits resulting from following coordinated strategies as opposed to leader-follower strategies. A cooperative bargaining approach is utilized for determine the best co-op advertising scheme for achieving full coordination in the supply chain. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|Classification JEL : M 37, Q 13, Q 18 The aim of {{this paper}} is to propose an {{interpretation}} of advertising strategies in the French wine sector. Several public reports reveal the weakness of promotional investments by the French wine producers. This situation can be explained by two strategic motivations. First, the structure of the French wine industry is mainly composed of numerous little producers. Stakeholders of small scale cannot a fford to develop strong brand names. This contrasts with the industry of Californian or Australian wines, which are supported by important <b>promotional</b> <b>budgets.</b> Secondly, the multitude of collective label (e. g Protected Designations of Origin, AOC in France) raises the risk of free riding and the possibility of externalities (advertising spillover) of individual strategies. So French fi rms are encouraged to join their investments and to develop collective advertising. These generic promotions are mainly done by collective marketing orders, called "interprofessions" in France. For several authors, the generic aspect makes necessary the cooperation between actors and justifi es the mandatory programs. Our study underlines a second e ect where the individual investments in advertising allow the development of the sector overall in spite of the presence of externalities. A process of cooperation is not thus an indispensable condition...|$|R
