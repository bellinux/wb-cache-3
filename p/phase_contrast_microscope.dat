After preparatory {{school and a}} {{classical}} education {{with the emphasis on}} Greek and Latin, Stähelin studied medicine in Basel, Zürich and Florence (1944–1950). His first position after graduation was at the Institute of Microbiology of the University of Basel (1951–1954) where he investigated the morphology and sporulation of anthrax bacilli {{with the help of the}} then-new <b>phase</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>microscope.</b> In May 1951, Stähelin was the first to observe naked anthrax bacilli protoplasts, called gymnoplasts, which had left behind their empty cell walls. A year later, during his studies of their osmotic behavior, he discovered and described the occasional fusion of naked protoplasts. This seminal paper in German immediately caught the attention of the bacterial geneticist Joshua Lederberg, who personally requested a copy.|$|E
25|$|Egg {{formation}} in M. javanica {{has been studied}} in detail, and is similar to egg {{formation in}} the well studied, free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Embryogenesis has also been studied, and the stages of development are easily identifiable with a <b>phase</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>microscope</b> following preparation of an egg mass squash. The egg is formed as one cell, with two-cell, four-cell and eight-cell stages recognisable. Further cell division leads to the tadpole stage, with further elongation resulting {{in the first stage}} juvenile, which is roughly four times as long as the egg. The J1 stage of C. elegans has 558 cells, and the J1 of M. javanica likely has a similar number, since all nematodes are morphologically and anatomically similar. The egg shell has three layers, with the vitelline layer outermost, then a chitinous layer and a lipid layer innermost.|$|E

50|$|Before the {{introduction}} of the <b>phase</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>microscope</b> it was difficult to observe living cells. As living cells are translucent they must be stained to be visible in a traditional light microscope. Unfortunately, the process of staining cells generally kill the cells. With the invention of the phase contrast microscopy it became possible to observe unstained living cells in detail. After its introduction in the 1940s, live cell imaging rapidly became popular using phase contrast microscopy. The <b>phase</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>microscope</b> was popularized through a series of time-lapse movies (Video 1), recorded using a photographic film camera. Its inventor, Frits Zernike, was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1953. Other later phase contrast techniques used to observe unstained cells are Hoffman modulation and differential interference contrast microscopy.|$|E

A total of 270 samples: 80 field and 10 field blank samples for each sampler type, were taken from seven stations in the processing mill of an iron ore mine whose ore contains amphibole minerals.

5|$|<b>Phase</b> <b>contrast</b> and {{differential}} interference contrast (DIC) microscopy {{are important}} tools in biology and medicine. Most animal cells and single-celled organisms have very little color, and their intracellular organelles are almost totally invisible under simple bright field illumination.

As seen in Figs.24 and25, <b>phase</b> <b>contrast</b> and DIC <b>microscopes</b> allow unstained, living cells to be studied.

40|$|The main {{component}} {{that contributes to}} the high value of pineapple is bromelain which is a proteolytic enzyme and has been scientifically identified as a therapeutic agent. This study was conducted to obtain high quantity of bromelain from pineapple and to investigate the anticarcinogenic activity of fresh pineapple juices against A 2780 ovarian and HT 29 colon cancer cell lines. It was found that homogenization, ultrafiltration, precipitation and dialysis contributed to heavy loss of bromelain. Therefore, fresh pineapple juices from the flesh (PJ-F), core (PJ-C) and stem (PJ-S) were selected as a source of crude bromelain. Various bromelain concentrations of PJ-F, PJ-C and PJ-S (1 mu g/ml, 10 mu g/ml, 100 mu g/ml and 1000 mu g/ml) were exposed to the cancer cells and the cell viability was determined using Methylthiazol Tetrazolium Assay (MTT assay) after 24, 48 and 72 h. Besides, IC 50 values were measured. Using normal cell (HSF 1184) comparison, it was found that a 100 mu g/ml concentration of bromelain would efficiently inhibit the cancer cells without affecting the surrounding normal cells. Microscopic examinations were carried out to elucidate the modes of cell death on the basis of morphological alterations using florescent and inverted <b>phase</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>microscopes.</b> Furthermore, the colony forming abilities of fresh pineapple juices on A 2780 and HT 29 cells were examined. The results demonstrated that PJ-F, PJ-C and PJ-S effectively suppressed the colony formation in cancer cells.

40|$|Cells of {{onion and}} garlic root tips were {{examined}} under the electron and <b>phase</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>microscopes</b> after fixation in KMnO 4. Special attention {{was focused on the}} distribution and behavior of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) during the several phases of mitosis. Slender profiles, recognized as sections through thin lamellar units of the ER (most prominent in KMnO 4 -fixed material), are distributed more or less uniformly in the cytoplasm of interphase cells and show occasional continuity with the nuclear envelope. In late prophase the nuclear envelope breaks down and its remnants plus cytoplasmic elements of the ER, which are morphologically identical, surround the spindle in a zone from which mitochondria, etc., are excluded. During metaphase these ER elements persist and concentrate as two separate systems in the polar caps or zones of the spindle. At about this same time they begin to proliferate and to invade the ends of the spindle. The invading lamellar units form drape-like partitions between the anaphase chromosomes. In late anaphase, their advancing margins reach the middle zone of the spindle and begin to fray out. Finally, in telophase, while elements of the ER in the poles of the spindle coalesce around the chromosomes to form the new envelope, the advancing edges of those in the middle zone reticulate {{at the level of the}} equator to form a close lattice of tubular elements. Within this, which is identified as the phragmoplast, the earliest signs of the cell plate appear in the form of small vesicles. These subsequently grow and fuse to complete the separation of the two protoplasts. Other morphological units apparently participating in mitosis are described. Speculation is provided on the equal division or not of the nuclear envelope and the contribution the envelope fragments make to the ER of the new cell...|$|R

40|$|An {{injury to}} adult {{mammalian}} skeletal muscle {{is followed by}} regeneration, which involves a process believed {{to be similar to}} the differentiation of muscle fibres in the embryo. The origin of these differentiating myogenic cells is conjectural. The aim {{of the present study was}} to examine the source of myogenic cells and the process of myogenesis in adult skeletal muscle. Mononucleated cells were released from adult rat leg muscle mince after incubation with 0. 1 % pronase for 50 - 60 minutes at 37 degrees C. The ultrastructural studies revealed that the freshly dissociated mononucleated cells consisted of at least two populations of cells: myogenic satellite cells and non-myogenic fibroblastic cells. These cells were plated in growth media at various densities in cell culture dishes and incubated for 3 weeks in a balanced air atmosphere at 37 degrees C. The culture was routinely examined with a <b>phase</b> <b>contrasted</b> <b>microscope</b> for evidence of myogenic activities of the plated cells. At selected time intervals, the cell cultures were processed for autoradiography and scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM). Attachment of cells to the dish began soon after plating, with flattening of some non-muscle cells. The round- to spindle-shaped cells, indicative of myoblasts, began to appear within 24 hours. DNA synthesis and cell proliferation were observed in myogenic and non-myogenic cells within 24 hours of culture. SEM revealed that at 72 hours some myoblasts aligned and fused with one another, forming myotubes. Quantitation of autoradiographs indicated that the maximum number of labelled myotubes were present in the 3 days old culture, and thereafter, the labelled myotubes decreased in number and were absent in the 7 days old culture. Within 5 - 7 days the myotubes became larger and showed contractility. TEM of 6 to 21 day culture revealed that the myotubes contained well differentiated myofibrils, T-tubules and sarcoplasmic reticulum. It was evident from our studies that the mononucleated cells, having satellite cell morphology, were capable of differentiating into fully formed muscle fibres.
