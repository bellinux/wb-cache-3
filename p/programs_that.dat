50|$|Architecture is design {{but not all}} {{design is}} {{architect}}ural. In practice, the architect {{is the one who}} draws the line between software architecture (architectural design) and detailed design (non-architectural design). There are no rules or guidelines that fit all cases, although there have been attempts to formalize the distinction. According to the Intension/Locality Hypothesis, the distinction between architectural and detailed design is defined by the Locality Criterion, according to which a statement about software design is non-local (architectural) if and only if a <b>program</b> <b>that</b> satisfies it can be expanded into a <b>program</b> <b>that</b> does not. For example, the client-server style is architectural (strategic) because a <b>program</b> <b>that</b> is built on this principle can be expanded into a <b>program</b> <b>that</b> is not client-server‚Äîfor example, by adding peer-to-peer nodes.|$|R
