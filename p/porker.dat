500|$|Reviewers of {{the episode}} have also praised it for its {{character}} development. Todd Gilchrist of IGN said he thinks the key to The Simpsons longevity is its [...] "sentimental but not gooey" [...] approach to storytelling and character development. He cited [...] "Lisa the Vegetarian" [...] as an example and said: [...] "Lisa sabotages Homer's barbecue, which results in an unceremonious death for his prize pig. But rather than simply punctuating the episode with an iconic image of the <b>porker</b> soaring through the air, the writers actually develop a story into which the joke fits. The comedic effect is actually intensified because we care about the characters, are invested in the story, and primed for a great gag." [...] The Niagara Gazettes Phil Dzikiy said that [...] "the character development and storytelling is perfect", noting that the episode was [...] "equally hilarious, touching and satirical".|$|E

40|$|The first aim of {{the study}} was to compare {{selected}} meat quality parameters in <b>porkers</b> without the gene RYR 1 T (ryanodine receptor gene). These were <b>porkers</b> slaughtered at 100 to 115 kg and 116 to 130 kg live weight. The second {{aim of the}} study was to determine the occurrence frequency of standard-quality meat (red, firm, nonexudative [RFN]) and the occurence frequency of defective meat (pale, soft, exudative [PSE] and acid, soft, exudative [ASE]). The analysis was conducted on the longissimus lumborum muscle in 114 crossbred <b>porkers.</b> The <b>porkers</b> were a cross of Camborough 22 sows and boars from lines 337 PIC (Pig Improvement Company), Norsvin Landrace and Pietrain. All of the animals were provided with identical environmental and nutritional conditions. The average weight of the slaughtered animals in the light and heavy groups was 110 kg and 122 kg, respectively. Both groups had the same average post-slaughter meatiness (56. 5 %). A statistical analysis of selected meat-quality parameters did not show any significant differences between the weight groups. On the other hand, the classification based on carcass quality showed an occurence frequency of defective meat in heavier crossbred <b>porkers</b> (116 to 130 kg) that was three times higher than in those crossbred animals which weighed 100 to 115 kg when slaughtered.

40|$|Association {{of growth}} hormone (GH) gene {{polymorphism}} with carcass and meat quality traits in PIC hybrid pigs The presented study {{was aimed at}} determining the association of growth hormone (GH) gene polymorphism with the traits that characterise carcass and meat quality and meat basic chemical composition in <b>porkers</b> with genotype CC with respect to RYR 1 locus. The study was carried out on 126 PIC <b>porkers</b> originating after Camborough 22 sows and PIC 337 boars. The polymorphism of GH gene was identified respectively with restrictive enzymes MspI, HaeII, CfoI and ApaI. The allele frequencies were as follows: GH/MspI A = 0. 78 and B = 0. 22; GH/HaeII A = 0. 86 and B = 0. 14; GH/CfoI C 1 = 0. 09 and C 2 = 0. 03 and C 3 = 0. 18 and C 4 = 0. 70; GH/ApaI A 1 = 0. 28 and A 2 = 0. 72. The analysis of association of GH genotypes identified with four restrictive enzymes did not show any relationship between the GH gene polymorphism and the carcass slaughter traits determined with meatiness measuring apparatus CGM and the meat quality and meat basic chemical composition in PIC hybrid <b>porkers.</b> It may be stated, basing on the analysis performed, that GH gene is weakl...|$|R
