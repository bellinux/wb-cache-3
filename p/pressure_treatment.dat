25|$|A main {{consideration}} regarding timber piles is {{that they}} should be protected from rotting above groundwater level. Timber will last for a long time below the groundwater level. For timber to rot, two elements are needed: water and oxygen. Below the groundwater level, dissolved oxygen is lacking even though there is ample water. Hence, timber tends to last for a long time below groundwater level. In 1648 the Royal Palace of Amsterdam was constructed on 13659 timber piles that still survive today since they were below groundwater level. Timber that is to be used above the water table can be protected from decay and insects by numerous forms of wood preservation using <b>pressure</b> <b>treatment</b> (alkaline copper quaternary (ACQ), chromated copper arsenate (CCA), creosote, etc.).|$|E

The results indicated that <b>pressure</b> <b>treatments</b> of 100 and 200 MPa {{can be used to}} produce frozen peppers with similar to better nutritional (soluble protein and ascorbic acid) and texture (firmness) characteristics, comparable activity of polyphenol oxidase and higher activity of pectin methylesterase, while pressure treated peppers show a higher level of peroxidase activity. It would be interesting to use higher pressures in future studies, as an attempt to cause a higher reduction on microbial load and on enzymatic activity. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The ascorbic acid (AA) content of the peppers was not affected by thermal blanching, {{with the exception of}} the more severe condition (98 °C/ 150 s), whereas all pressurized samples showed an increase of AA content in the range of 11 – 48 %.

40|$|International audienceWe {{investigated}} {{the influence of}} cell hydration {{on the ability of}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae CBS 1171 to withstand extreme hydrostatic pressure {{in order to determine the}} mechanisms involved in cell resistance. Hydration conditions were modified in two different ways. We first modulated the chemical potential of water by adding glycerol in cell suspensions. Another procedure consisted in dehydrating cells aerobically and immersing them in perfluorooctane, an innocuous hydrophobic liquid used as a pressure-transmitting medium, prior to <b>pressure</b> <b>treatments.</b> This original method made it possible to transmit isostatic pressure to yeast powders without changing the initial water activity (a w) level at which cells had been equilibrated. The a w ranged between 0. 11 and 0. 99. <b>Pressure</b> <b>treatments</b> were applied at levels of up to 600 MPa for 10 min, 24 h, and 6 days. The dehydration of cells was found to strongly limit, or even prevent, cell inactivation under pressure. Notably, cells suspended in a water–glycerol mixture with a w levels of 0. 71 or below were completely protected against all <b>pressure</b> <b>treatments.</b> Moreover, cells dehydrated aerobically survived for 6 days at 600 MPa even when a w levels were relatively high (up to 0. 94). We highlighted the crucial role of water content in determining cellular damage under pressure. When water is available in a sufficient amount, high pressure induces membrane permeabilization, causing uncontrolled mass transfers that could lead to death during a prolonged holding under pressure. Possible mechanisms of membrane permeabilization are discussed...|$|R

The control gel (cooking at 90 C for 20 min) was elastic and white. The meat paste treated by heat treatment began {{to form a}} gel texture at 50 C, and the gel was elastic, rigid, white and mainly constituted by covalent bonds. Gels induced by pressure (above 200 MPa) were softer, more viscous than those by heat, meanwhile, they were mainly constituted by hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions. Subsequent cooking process (90 C; 20 min) would increase the hardness, elasticity and whiteness of the gels both induced by heat and <b>pressure</b> <b>treatments.</b> The appearance of the pressure-induced gels showed glossiness and close to native color of meat pastes whereas that of the heat-induced gels showed white but no luster. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS The textural, chemical and physical characteristics of protein gels induced by heat and pressure are quite different; therefore combinations of heat and <b>pressure</b> <b>treatments</b> may produce various products. Pressure-induced gels are mainly constituted by noncovalent bonds and are soft, viscous and glossy in appearance, whereas heat-induced gels are mainly constituted by covalent bonds and are elastic, rigid and white.

The fruits were stored at 25 °C and changes in the concentration of ascorbic acid, total phenols, total flavonoids, total carotenoids, and antiradical efficiency were evaluated. It was demonstrated that in 'Ataulfo' mango high hydrostatic <b>pressure</b> <b>treatments</b> at 60 and 30 MPa for 20 minutes induced the synthesis of ascorbic acid during storage maybe as a consequence of physiological changes and possible structural modification of the cells, while the fruits pressurized at 15 MPa showed no effect on this parameter.
