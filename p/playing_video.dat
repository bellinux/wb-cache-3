According to Iwiński, {{although}} he enjoyed <b>playing</b> <b>video</b> games as a child they were scarce in Poland (which was in the Soviet Union's sphere of influence at the time). Polish copyright law did not exist and Iwiński, in high school, sold cracked copies of Western video games at a Warsaw marketplace. In high school Iwiński met Kiciński, who became his business partner; at that time, Kiciński also sold video games.|$|E

5|$|Research has disproved {{some common}} misconceptions about the brain. These include both {{ancient and modern}} myths. It is not true that neurons are not {{replaced}} {{after the age of}} two; nor that only ten per cent of the brain is used. Popular culture has also oversimplified the lateralisation of the brain, suggesting that functions are completely specific {{to one side of the}} brain or the other. Akio Mori coined the term game brain for the unreliably supported theory that spending long periods <b>playing</b> <b>video</b> games harmed the brain's pre-frontal region and the expression of emotion and creativity.|$|E
5|$|Often, Underwood's {{thoughts}} {{throughout the}} series {{are presented in}} a direct address to the audience, a narrative technique known as breaking the fourth wall. Immediately prior to starring in House of Cards, Spacey had starred in a production of William Shakespeare's Richard III as Richard III of England, a character {{that serves as a}} partial basis for both Urquhart and Underwood. His last name is derived from Oscar Underwood, who served as the first Democratic House Minority Whip from about 1900 to 1901. His few vices include smoking cigarettes and <b>playing</b> <b>video</b> games; when the Secret Service cuts off his online gaming service after he becomes Vice President, he takes up creating model figurines.|$|E
5|$|Through Steamworks, Steam {{provides}} a means of server browsing for multiplayer games that use the Steam Community features, allowing users to create lobbies with friends or members of common groups. Steamworks also provides Valve Anti-Cheat (VAC), Valve's proprietary anti-cheat system; game servers automatically detect and report users who are using cheats in online, multiplayer games. In August 2012, Valve added new featuresincluding dedicated hub pages for games that highlight the best user-created content, top forum posts, and screenshotsto the Community area. In December 2012, a feature called Game Guides, where users can upload text and images detailing games and game strategies {{in the same manner}} as GameFAQs was added.

5|$|Mother 3 is a single-player role <b>playing</b> <b>video</b> game {{similar to}} {{previous}} {{games in the}} Mother series. The player controls a party of playable characters who explore the game's two-dimensional fictional world, primarily shown from a top-down perspective. While navigating the overworld, the player may converse with non-player characters, obtain items, or encounter enemies. Winning battles against enemies awards experience points to the party, which is required for leveling up. Leveling up a character permanently enhances its individual attributes such as maximum hit points (HP), power points (PP), offense, and defense. Weapons, armor, or accessories can be equipped on a character to increase certain attributes. The player can restore their characters' HP and PP or heal various status ailments by visiting hot springs which are placed abundantly in the game world, and the player can save the game by talking to frogs. Currency is introduced in the later half of the game as Dragon Points (DP), earned by winning battles and used to purchase items. The player can deposit or withdraw DP from frogs.|$|E
5|$|Swords and Sorcery is {{presented}} in a first person top-down perspective and contains elements of dungeon crawling, a common trait of role <b>playing</b> <b>video</b> games. The game {{is set in a}} fictional land called Zob, in which he main objective is to explore its catacombs and discover a large wealth of treasure, alongside collecting seven pieces of sacred Zob armour. The game begins with allowing the player to choose their player-character; the default protagonist is called Flubbit the Dull, however there is an option to allow the player to create and personalise their own character. Once a character has been created, a 14 in-game day training scheme will commence which gives the player an opportunity to improve their abilities such as lock picking, sword fighting and thieving. An in-game armoury is also accessible at any time, which includes utilities such as body armour and various weaponry. The form of currency in the game is dragon's teeth, which can be used to purchase items and equipment.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the MacBook Air, the MacBook {{follows the}} same design first {{seen in the}} MacBook Pro; however, it is rounder on the edges than {{previous}} laptops in the MacBook line. This model has an all-white fingerprint-resistant glossy palm rest, unlike the grayish surface of its predecessor, and uses a multi-touch glass trackpad like the one found on the MacBook Pro. The video-out port is Mini DisplayPort. The bottom of the MacBook features a rubberized non-slip finish. The built-in battery of the late 2009 revision, a feature introduced {{earlier in the year}} with the MacBook Pro, is claimed by Apple to last seven hours compared with five hours in the older models. However, in tests conducted by Macworld, the battery was found to last only about four hours while <b>playing</b> <b>video</b> at full brightness with AirPort turned off. However, Apple's battery life was calculated with the brightness at the middle setting and while browsing websites and editing word documents, not with video and at full brightness. Gizmodo also reached about the same conclusion in their tests, but with AirPort turned on. The battery included in the mid-2010 model holds an additional five watt-hours over the previous model's and is claimed to last up to ten hours.|$|E

25|$|Performance {{in mental}} {{rotation}} and similar spatial tasks {{is affected by}} gender expectations. For example, studies show that being told before the test that men typically perform better, or that the task is linked with jobs like aviation engineering typically associated with men versus jobs like fashion design typically associated with women, will negatively affect female performance on spatial rotation and positively influence it when subjects are told the opposite. Experiences such as <b>playing</b> <b>video</b> games also increase a person's mental rotation ability. A study from the University of Toronto showed that differences in ability get reduced after <b>playing</b> <b>video</b> games requiring complex mental rotation. The experiment showed that playing such games creates larger gains in spatial cognition in females than males. However, male participants still performed superior to female participants {{both before and after}} training.|$|E
25|$|Preliminary {{studies have}} {{supported}} the idea that <b>playing</b> <b>video</b> games {{is a form of}} neurofeedback, which helps those with ADHD self-regulate and improve learning.
