40|$|To {{improve the}} {{rigidity}} of the exposed type steel column base, the anchor bolt shall be tightened. The nut tightening {{tests of the}} anchor bolt set with the rolled threads, the torque-control type hexagon nut, the discspring and the <b>plain</b> <b>washer</b> were conducted. The fracture behavior and the bolt tension are discussed. And {{the relationship between the}} diameter of the narrow part in nut and the failure tightening torque is investigated...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA design {{concept of}} a gas flow {{pulsation}} damper at a pressure regulator outlet is offered. It is formulated the operational principle of this damper, which contains the orifice with high and low resistance and also the stabilizer (vortex damper) of an outflow. Future references for choosing the diameter {{and the amount of}} passages in the orifices are also done. It is proposed the sequence of choosing the damper parameters, which contains the stages of tentative gas-dynamic calculation of the <b>plain</b> <b>washer</b> parameters on basis of the Saint-Venant-Wenzel formula and the final modeling, produced on basis of the numerical simulation. It is presented the pulsation damper, which was developed by the offered method...|$|E

50|$|Complaints {{from the}} pilots {{led to a}} search for a solution. Beatrice 'Tilly' Shilling, a young female {{engineer}} working at the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough, came up with a disarmingly simple solution. She introduced a simple flow restrictor: a small metal disc much like a <b>plain</b> metal <b>washer.</b> The restrictor orifice was made to accommodate just the fuel needed for maximum engine power, the power setting usually used during dogfights. It came in two versions, one for 12 psi manifold pressure and one for boosted engines with 15 psi manifold pressure.|$|R
40|$|When a bar falling {{or moving}} at any speed strikes the {{opposite}} side of threaded rod fastening a thick circular disk, stress wave propagating from the collision interface is transmitted into the assembly system, tightening the thick circular disk by the bolt-nut unit. This paper experimentally studies the relationship between the loosening response of bolt-nut fastening assembly system and stress wave modes (tension or compression) along the direction of propagation. The technique of observing the loosening of a bolt-nut assembly system by monitoring the configuration of stress waves reflected from the surface of a thick circular disk is presented. The axial stress of a bolt tightened by a hexagonal nut in conjunction with a <b>plain</b> <b>washer,</b> a spring washer or a flanged nut is measured, when a number of incident waves are impinged into the assembly system. The shift of axial stress due to tightening by flanged nut is the smallest...|$|E
40|$|Experience {{has shown}} that a bolt-nut {{assembly}} system properly tightened can be loosened under vibrating load or impact. This paper experimentally investigates the loosening response of an assembly when a stress wave is transmitted from a gross area of a bolt, a face of a circular disk, or a screw thread of the thick circular disk assembly fastened by the bolt-nut unit. When a falling bar strikes {{the opposite side of}} a threaded rod fastened to the circular disk, or a falling circular pipe collides with the circular disk or with the anvil attached {{to the end of a}} screw, a stress wave propagating from the collision interface is transmitted into the assembly. The axial stress of a bolt tightened by a hexagonal nut in conjunction with a <b>plain</b> <b>washer</b> is measured, while a number of incident waves are impinged into the assembly. The shift of axial stress due to the stress wave transmitted from the portion of the screw thread is the largest. The cause of the loosening is investigated by observing the stress waves transmitted into the circular disk assembly system...|$|E

These joints may get loose with time and if not attended timely may result in catastrophic failure also. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the effect of tightening torque on loosening. For this purpose tests were conducted using three different tightening torque values, in the vicinity of rated torque. Washers of different types are used in bolted joint, with an understanding that they prevent or retard loosening. This study also attempts to examine the role of two types of most commonly used washers: the <b>plain</b> <b>washer</b> and the spring washer. Trials were also performed on joint without any washer, for the sake of comparison of loosening performance of the joint. The results of this experimental study are shown in terms of starting point of loosening of joint and rate of loosening of the joint. Various combinations of washers for three values of tightening torque are considered in the experimental study. The results are useful in understanding the role of type of washer in prevention of loosening of the bolted joint...|$|E
