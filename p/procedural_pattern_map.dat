40|$|An updated flow <b>pattern</b> <b>map</b> was {{developed}} for CO 2 {{on the basis of}} the previous Cheng-Ribatski-Wojtan-Thome CO 2 flow <b>pattern</b> <b>map</b> [1, 2] to extend the flow <b>pattern</b> <b>map</b> to a wider range of conditions. A new annular flow to dryout transition (A-D) and a new dryout to mist flow transition (D-M) were proposed here. In addition, a bubbly flow region which generally occurs at high mass velocities and low vapor qualities was added to the updated flow <b>pattern</b> <b>map.</b> The updated flow <b>pattern</b> <b>map</b> is applicable to a much wider range of conditions: tube diameters from 0. 6 to 10 mm, mass velocities from 50 to 1500 kg/m(2) s, heat fluxes from 1. 8 to 46 kW/m(2) and saturation temperatures from - 28 to + 25 degrees C (reduced pressures from 0. 21 to 0. 87). The updated flow <b>pattern</b> <b>map</b> was compared to independent experimental data of flow patterns for CO 2 in the literature and it predicts the flow patterns well. Then, a database of CO 2 two-phase flow pressure drop results from the literature was set up and the database was compared to the leading empirical pressure drop models: the correlations by Chisholm [3], Friedel [4], Gronnerud [5] and Muller-Steinhagen and Heck [6], a modified Chisholm correlation by Yoon et al. [7] and the flow pattern based model of Moreno Quiben and Thome [8 - 10]. None of these models was able to predict the CO 2 pressure drop data well. Therefore, a new flow pattern based phenomenological model of two-phase flow frictional pressure drop for CO 2 {{was developed}} by modifying the model of Moreno Quiben and Thome using the updated flow <b>pattern</b> <b>map</b> in this study and it predicts the CO 2 pressure drop database quite well overall.

40|$|A {{security}} {{pattern is}} a well-understood {{solution to a}} recurring information security problem. They are patterns in the sense originally defined by Christopher Alexander (the basis {{for much of the}} later work in design patterns and pattern languages of programs), applied to the domain of information security. A security pattern encapsulates security expertise in the form of worked solutions to these recurring problems, presenting issues and trade-offs in the usage of the pattern. This document presents version 1. 0 of our Security Patterns Repository. The Security Patterns Repository Version 1. 0 consists of 26 patterns and 3 mini-patterns. (A mini-pattern is a shorter, less formal discussion of security expertise in terms of just a problem and its solution.) To define the scope of the problems our patterns address, we focused on the domain of web application security. The patterns are divided between structural <b>patterns</b> and <b>procedural</b> <b>patterns.</b> Structural patterns are patterns that can be implemented in an application; they encompass design patterns (such as those presented by the Gang of Four), but can also apply at the architectural or implementation levels. <b>Procedural</b> <b>patterns</b> are patterns {{that can be used to}} improve the process for development of security-critical software; they often impact the organization or management of a development project. Following the presentation of security patterns in this document, we include a comprehensive bibliography collecting references from all the patterns with other relevant web application security and patterns material. To supplement this patterns repository document, we have developed a Web application that is a functional repository for these Security Patterns. Our repository application enables viewing of patterns, submitting of feedback on the patterns, and editing of patterns for authorized users. We will include relevant example code within the repository document when this application is finalized. The Security Patterns repository is available a...|$|R

This article, being {{the first of a}} two-part paper (the second part concentrates on the pressure drops and void fractions), presents flow patterns and heat transfer coefficients during condensation for different mass fluxes and vapour qualities for the whole range of inclination angles (from vertical downwards to vertical upwards). The results were compared with three flow <b>pattern</b> <b>maps</b> available in literature. It was found that for low mass fluxes and/or low vapour qualities, the flow pattern is strongly dependent on the inclination angle whereas it remains annular for high mass fluxes and high vapour qualities, whatever the tube orientation. The models of flow <b>pattern</b> <b>maps</b> available in the literature did not predict the experimental data well. In the inclination-dependent zone, experiments showed that there is an optimum inclination angle that leads to the highest heat transfer coefficient for downward flow.

40|$|In this paper, a joint {{transmitter}} {{and receiver}} design for pattern division multiple access (PDMA) is proposed. At the transmitter, <b>pattern</b> <b>mapping</b> utilizes power allocation to improve the overall sum rate, and beam allocation to enhance the access connectivity. At the receiver, hybrid detection utilizes a spatial filter to suppress the inter-beam interference caused by beam domain multiplexing, and successive interference cancellation to remove the intra-beam interference caused by power domain multiplexing. Furthermore, we propose a PDMA joint design approach to optimize <b>pattern</b> <b>mapping</b> based on both the power domain and beam domain. The optimization of power allocation is achieved by maximizing the overall sum rate, and the corresponding optimization problem is shown to be convex theoretically. The optimization of beam allocation is achieved by minimizing the maximum of the inner product of any two beam allocation vectors, and an effective dimension reduction method is proposed through the analysis of pattern structure and proper mathematical manipulations.
