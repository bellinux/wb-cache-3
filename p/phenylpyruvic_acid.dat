40|$|Aryl {{metabolite}} biosynthesis was {{studied in}} the white rot fungus Bjerkandera adusta cultivated in a liquid medium supplemented with l-phenylalanine. Aromatic compounds were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry following addition of labelled precursors (14 C- and 13 C-labelled l-phenylalanine), which did not interfere with fungal metabolism. The major aromatic compounds identified were benzyl alcohol, benzaldehyde (bitter almond aroma), and benzoic acid. Hydroxy- and methoxybenzylic compounds (alcohols, aldehydes, and acids) were also found in fungal cultures. Intracellular enzymatic activities (phenylalanine ammonia lyase, aryl-alcohol oxidase, aryl-alcohol dehydrogenase, aryl-aldehyde dehydrogenase, lignin peroxidase) and extracellular enzymatic activities (aryl-alcohol oxidase, lignin peroxidase), as well as aromatic compounds, were detected in B. adusta cultures. Metabolite formation required de novo protein biosynthesis. Our results show that l-phenylalanine was deaminated to trans-cinnamic acid by a phenylalanine ammonia lyase and trans-cinnamic acid was in turn converted to aromatic <b>acids</b> (<b>phenylpyruvic,</b> phenylacetic, mandelic, and benzoylformic acids); benzaldehyde was a metabolic intermediate.

Our findings {{support the hypothesis that}} all of these compounds are intermediates in the biosynthetic pathway from l-phenylalanine to aryl metabolites. Additionally, trans-cinnamic acid can also be transformed via β-oxidation to benzoic acid. This was confirmed by the presence of acetophenone as a β-oxidation degradation intermediate.

Despite {{his work in the}} field, the cause of his son's disability was never diagnosed. [...] In 1958, Guthrie's 15-month-old niece was diagnosed with phenylketonuria (PKU), a condition in which the body cannot metabolize phenylalanine. Untreated PKU results in irreversible neurological damage. [...] After the discovery of PKU as a cause of mental retardation, Horst Bickel and colleagues discovered that it could be treated successfully with a diet low in phenylalanine. [...] The main drawback in successful treatment of PKU was the delay in identifying affected individuals. The common test for PKU at the time was mixing urine with ferric chloride. The excess <b>phenylpyruvic</b> <b>acid</b> in the urine of an individual with PKU would produce a bright green colour when reacting with the ferric chloride. Infants do not excrete high enough concentrations of this compound to give a positive test result, thus delaying their diagnosis, and allowing irreversible damage to take place. [...] Guthrie's disabled son had driven his interest in causes of mental retardation, the diagnosis of his niece with PKU turned his attention to preventable causes. Others working with children who had PKU asked Guthrie to focus on a test that would allow for earlier identification, before irreversible damage had taken place.|$|E
40|$|The {{production}} of benzaldehyde from phenylalanine {{has been studied}} in various microorganisms, and several metabolic pathways have been proposed in the literature {{for the formation of}} this aromatic flavor compound. In this study, we describe benzaldehyde formation from phenylalanine by using a cell extract of Lactobacillus plantarum. Phenylalanine was initially converted to <b>phenylpyruvic</b> <b>acid</b> by an aminotransferase in the cell extract, and the keto acid was further transformed to benzaldehyde. However, control experiments with boiled cell extract revealed that the subsequent conversion of <b>phenylpyruvic</b> <b>acid</b> was a chemical oxidation step. It was observed that several cations could replace the extract in the conversion of <b>phenylpyruvic</b> <b>acid</b> to benzaldehyde. Addition of Cu(II) ions to <b>phenylpyruvic</b> <b>acid</b> resulted not only in the formation of benzaldehyde, but also in the generation of phenylacetic acid, mandelic acid, and phenylglyoxylic acid.

40|$|HENYLKETONURIA (phenylpyruvic oligophrenia) is a {{metabolic}} dis-order first {{recognized by}} Foiling (1) approximately 25 years ago. He found that two mentally retarded children in. {{the same family}} excreted urine containing a substance which gave a green color with ferric chloride. This substance was identified as <b>phenylpyruvic</b> <b>acid.</b> It has subsequently been recognized that in phenylketonuria a block in the utilization of phenylalanine causes this amino acid to accumu-late in the blood. The work of Wallace, Moldave and Meister (2) suggests that the deficiency in. the utilization of phenylalanine by the phenyilcetonuric {{may be due to}} the absence of at least one component of an enzyme system which effects the conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine. With the increase of serum phenylalanine, an accompany-ing irreversible injury to the brain occurs which may or may not be due to direct toxic effect of phenylalanine. A portion of the phenyl-alanine is deaminated to <b>phenylpyruvic</b> <b>acid</b> which appears in the urine.

40|$|Mothers with {{untreated}} phenylketonuria (PKU) have {{an increased}} risk of bearing children with congenital malformations. PKU causes accumulation of phenylalanine (PHE) and its metabolites in urine and blood, and this condition may contribute to the developmental problems. In the present study we investigated the embryotoxicity of these compounds in the rat postimplantation embryo culture system. Whereas PHE was ineffective, <b>phenylpyruvic</b> <b>acid</b> and phenylacetic acid induced general growth retardation. Phenylacetic acid and O-hydroxyphenylacetic acid were also growth retarding and in addition affected yolk sac circulation. Phenylethylamine was the most embryotoxic compound tested, with a lowest effective concentration of 0. 03 g/l. It induced various anomalies including incomplete flexion and neural tube defects. The effects of a mixture of phenylketones in culture did not reveal synergism between compounds. In the presence of maternal hepatocytes PHE was metabolized in culture without leading to embryotoxic effects. Extending culture duration from 26 to 48 hours did not increase sensitivity to <b>phenylpyruvic</b> <b>acid.</b> No changes in osmolarity or pH of media were observed that might have been responsible for the embryotoxicity observed. Analysis with HPLC of media after culture revealed no biotransformation of added compounds into other metabolites, except for <b>phenylpyruvic</b> <b>acid.</b> In addition, in the presence of maternal hepatocytes, metabolism was observed that was not accompanied with embryotoxic effects. Embryo culture in human PKU sera, either or not supplemented with 5 % (v/v) rat serum, was not detrimental to development. Rather, embryo's tended to thrive better on PKU sera versus control sera. Analysis of human PKU sera revaled lower glucose levels and increased levels of PHE and PKU-related metabolites. The results suggest that the embryotoxicity of PKU-related phenylketones may contribute to teratogenicity of maternal PKU in man. However, in view of the relatively high concentrations necessary for embryotoxicity to occur in vitro, other factors yet unknown may play a significant role. Alternatively, the absence of embryotoxicity of human PKU sera in culture may be interpreted to suggest that the rat postimplantation embryo culture technique may not contain the developmental en points that are most vulnerable in maternal PKU. ...|$|E

40|$|The present {{method is}} {{intended}} for screening or measurement of high excretion of 5 -HIAA, {{and it is difficult}} to determine the normal value because of its lesser sensitivity. Discussion The nitrosonaphthol test, a widely used for screening test for argentaffinoma, is highly sensitive for the detection of 5 -HIAA, but the reagent must be freshly prepared before use, and even in the qualitative method undesirable pigment must be extracted with an organic solvent. The reaction with di-methylaminobenzaldehyde is also nonspecific for 5 -HIAA. From these considerations, purification of the urine sample by chromatography or many steps of extraction cannot be avoided. The present method is less sensitive than the nitro-sonaphthol reaction, but its specificity is better, so that it may be considered to be useful as a screening test for suspected cases of metastasizing carcinoid tumors.
