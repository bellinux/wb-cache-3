50|$|In both species, {{the primary}} xylem strand {{was central to}} stems, {{branches}} and appendages. In the main stems and branches it was X-shaped in cross-section, corresponding to the four rows of branches. In the final appendages it became circular in cross-section. The xylem development was 'mesarch', i.e. the first maturing <b>protoxylem</b> had later maturing metaxylem on either side. <b>Protoxylem</b> occurred both at {{the tips of the}} lobes of the xylem strand and in the centre.

50|$|Xylem {{appeared}} {{early in}} the history of terrestrial plant life. Fossil plants with anatomically preserved xylem are known from the Silurian (more than 400 million years ago), and trace fossils resembling individual xylem cells may be found in earlier Ordovician rocks. The earliest true and recognizable xylem consists of tracheids with a helical-annular reinforcing layer added to the cell wall. This is the only type of xylem found in the earliest vascular plants, and this type of cell continues {{to be found in the}} <b>protoxylem</b> (first-formed xylem) of all living groups of plants. Several groups of plants later developed pitted tracheid cells, it seems, through convergent evolution. In living plants, pitted tracheids do not appear in development until the maturation of the metaxylem (following the <b>protoxylem).</b>|$|E
50|$|Stage I: The first morphologically {{identifiable}} {{stage is}} the asymmetric division of two {{cells of the}} pericycle, termed pericycle founder cells, which are adjacent to the <b>protoxylem</b> poles and from which the lateral roots are derived entirely. These cells then undergo further division, causing radial expansion.|$|E
50|$|As a young {{vascular}} plant grows, {{one or more}} strands of primary xylem form in its stems and roots. The first xylem to develop is called 'protoxylem'. In appearance <b>protoxylem</b> is usually distinguished by narrower vessels formed of smaller cells. Some of these cells have walls which contain thickenings {{in the form of}} rings or helices. Functionally, <b>protoxylem</b> can extend: the cells are able to grow in size and develop while a stem or root is elongating. Later, 'metaxylem' develops in the strands of xylem. Metaxylem vessels and cells are usually larger; the cells have thickenings which are typically either in the form of ladderlike transverse bars (scalariform) or continuous sheets except for holes or pits (pitted). Functionally, metaxylem completes its development after elongation ceases when the cells no longer need to grow in size.|$|E
5000|$|Endarch is {{used when}} {{there is more than}} one strand of primary xylem in a stem or root, and the xylem {{develops}} from the inside outwards towards the periphery, i.e. centrifugally. The <b>protoxylem</b> is thus closest to the center of the stem or root and the metaxylem closest to the periphery. The stems of seed plants typically have endarch development.|$|E
5000|$|Exarch is {{used when}} {{there is more than}} one strand of primary xylem in a stem or root, and the xylem {{develops}} from the outside inwards towards the center, i.e. centripetally. The metaxylem is thus closest to the center of the stem or root and the <b>protoxylem</b> closest to the periphery. The roots of vascular plants are normally considered to have exarch development.|$|E
5000|$|Centrarch {{refers to}} the {{case in which the}} primary xylem forms a single {{cylinder}} {{in the center of the}} stem and develops from the center outwards. The <b>protoxylem</b> is thus found in the central core and the metaxylem in a cylinder around it. This pattern was common in early land plants, such as [...] "rhyniophytes", but is not present in any living plants.|$|E
50|$|These ferns are {{characterized}} by root steles having 3-5 <b>protoxylem</b> poles and antheridia with 6-12 narrow, twisted or curved cells in their walls.

They are tropical ferns, most diverse in Asia and the Pacific region.|$|E
5000|$|Mesarch is {{used when}} {{there is more than}} one strand of primary xylem in a stem or root, and the xylem {{develops}} from the middle of a strand in both directions. The metaxylem is thus on both the peripheral and central sides of the strand with the <b>protoxylem</b> between the metaxylem (possibly surrounded by it). The leaves and stems of many ferns have mesarch development.|$|E
50|$|The {{stems of}} zosterophylls were either smooth or covered with small spines known as enations, {{branched}} dichotomously, and grew {{at the ends}} by unrolling, {{a process known as}} circinate vernation. The stems had a central vascular column in which the <b>protoxylem</b> was exarch, and the metaxylem developed centripetally. The sporangia were kidney-shaped (reniform), with conspicuous lateral dehiscence and were borne laterally in a fertile zone towards the tips of the branches.|$|E
50|$|The main stems (axes) of Hsua robusta {{are about}} an inch thick, with circinate, pseudo-monopodial side {{branches}} emerging from the sides.The small side branches emerge immediately above a dichotomous branching point of the main axis. The lateral branches are in a plane (planar). In {{the centre of the}} axes is a protostele with an elliptical cross-section. The <b>protoxylem</b> was probably inside the xylem, maturing from the inside out. The tracheids have annular secondary wall thickening.|$|E
50|$|In some eudicot {{families}} (Apocynaceae, Convolvulaceae, Cucurbitaceae, Solanaceae, Myrtaceae, Asteraceae, Thymelaeaceae), phloem also develops on {{the inner}} side of the vascular cambium; in this case, a distinction between external phloem and internal phloem or intraxylary phloem is made. Internal phloem is mostly primary, and begins differentiation later than the external phloem and <b>protoxylem,</b> though it is not without exceptions.

5000|$|Yunia is a genus of extinct {{vascular}} {{plants from}} the Early Devonian (Pragian or Siegenian stage, around [...] ). It was first described from the Posongchong Formation of Yunnan, China. The leafless plant consisted of spiny stems, some 2 to 5 cm wide, which branched dichotomously at wide angles in a cruciate arrangement. Each stem contained vascular tissue {{with one or}} two strands of <b>protoxylem.</b> The spore-forming organs (sporangia) were elongated and borne on short stalks. The spores had a relatively smooth sculptural pattern and were trilete (i.e. each spore has three lines on it resulting from its formation in a tetrahedral set of four spores).|$|E
50|$|This {{plant is}} similar to Hamatophyton verticillatum and {{is found in the}} Xiejingsi Formation. R. songziensis {{consists}} of branched axes, up to 20 cm long, which have slightly swollen nodes and internodes with ribs and narrow branches produced from the nodes. The axes are protostelic. Cross sections show a roughly triangular or quadrangular organization of the primary xylem and radial arrangement of the secondary xylem. Primary xylem is exarch upon maturation, with <b>protoxylem</b> strands positioned around the tips of the primary xylem arms. No differentiation between fascicular and interfascicular regions of the secondary xylem is apparent, and ray cells are rarely observed. <b>Protoxylem</b> tracheids have helical wall thickenings, whereas the tracheids of meta- and secondary xylem possess scalariform and/or bordered pits. All R. songziensis axes bear trichomes or spines, some up to 2.8 mm long. At the nodes are whorls of six leaves, up to 2.4 cm long, that regularly or irregularly fork two to four times. The leaves are positioned perpendicular to the axis in proximal portions of the plant but insered at acute angles in distal portions. Fertile branches are produced in a terminal strobilus (8.5 cm long), which is subtended by whorls of normally developed leaves. It consists of a central axis and up to 16 whorls of fertile units, each of which consists of a bract and 6-10 sporangia. The bracts are elongate-cuneate and have prominent marginal fringes; sporangia are attached to the abaxial surface at the base of each brac. Although R. songziensis closely resembles H. verticillatum with its external axis morphology, leaf shape, and structure of the primary xylem. However, the two forms differ in strobilus morphology.|$|E
5000|$|The {{array of}} floral and faunal fossils {{found in the}} Princeton Chert has offered unequivocal {{evidence}} {{that it was a}} lacustrine or lake environment. The plant fossils found show many structural and anatomical adaptations to an aquatic environment, including a reduced vascular system, aerenchyma in tissues (air spaces to provide buoyancy), and <b>protoxylem</b> lacunae surrounded by a ring of cells with thickened inner walls. [...] Further evidence is provided by the fossils’ clear affinities with modern aquatic angiosperms. Many extant plants show these adaptations and are similar to the organisms found in the chert. For example, water lilies (Allenbya, Nymphaeaceae), water plantains (Alismataceae), arums (Keratosperma, Araceae) and rushes and sedges (Ethela, Juncaceae/Cyperaceae) {{are just some of the}} angiosperms found both today and in the Princeton Chert. Seeds have also been found which share adaptations with living aquatics. On the other hand, terrestrial fossils have rarely been found. The few that are, are represented mainly by seeds, some of which may have been transported by birds.|$|E
5000|$|... {{where the}} monilophytes {{comprise}} about 9,000 species, including horsetails (Equisetaceae), whisk ferns (Psilotaceae), and all eusporangiate and all leptosporangiate ferns. Historically both lycophytes and monilophytes were grouped together as pteridophytes (ferns and fern allies) {{on the basis}} of being spore-bearing ("seed-free"). In Smiths molecular phylogenetic study the ferns are characterised by lateral root origin in the endodermis, usually mesarch <b>protoxylem</b> in shoots, a pseudoendospore, plasmodial tapetum, and sperm cells with 30-1000 flagella. The term [...] "moniliform" [...] as in Moniliformopses and monilophytes means [...] "bead-shaped" [...] and was introduced by Kenrick and Crane (1997) as a scientific replacement for [...] "fern" [...] (including Equisetaceae) and became established by Pryer et al. (2004). Christenhusz and Chase (2014) in their review of classification schemes provide a critique of this usage, which they discouraged as irrational. In fact the alternative name Filicopsida was already in use. By comparison [...] "lycopod" [...] or lycophyte (club moss) means wolf-plant. The term [...] "fern ally" [...] included under Pteridophyta generally refers to vascular spore-bearing plants that are not ferns, including lycopods, horsetails, whisk ferns and water ferns (Marsileaceae, Salviniaceae and Ceratopteris), and even a much wider range of taxa. This is not a natural grouping but rather a convenient term for non-fern, and is also discouraged, as is eusporangiate for non-leptosporangiate ferns.|$|E
40|$|The {{water pipes}} of {{elongating}} plant organs {{are the result}} of programmed cell death and are formed by the walls of dead and empty <b>protoxylem</b> elements. These <b>protoxylem</b> elements are passively elongated many times by the surrounding tissue before they are replaced and collapse. Well-known adaptations for this unique task include the characteristic secondary wall thickenings, forming rings and helices. A new, clearly distinct structural element containing glycine-rich proteins is now visualized for the first time, using confocal laser scanning microscopy in the mature <b>protoxylem</b> of elongating organs of seed plants. This structural element is arranged along the longitudinal axis of the <b>protoxylem</b> elements. It interconnects the secondary wall thickenings within and between <b>protoxylem</b> elements, as well as the <b>protoxylem</b> with other cell types such as xylem parenchyma cells and metaxylem elements. The structural element is stable against detergent extractions, proteinase, pectinase and cellulase hydrolysis, and is closely associated with rhamnogalacturonan-I, a pectic polysaccharide. The results clearly demonstrate that the cell wall of <b>protoxylem</b> cells is a highly dynamic and complex structure. The typical polysaccharide-rich primary wall of living and elongating plant cells is progressively modified and finally replaced by a protein-rich wall in the dead and passively stretched <b>protoxylem</b> elements. These glycine-rich walls originated early {{in the evolution of the}} seed plants as confirmed by the analysis of genomic information...|$|E
40|$|<b>Protoxylem</b> {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the hydraulic function of vascular systems of both herbaceous and woody plants, but relatively little is known about the processes underlying the maintenance of <b>protoxylem</b> function in long-lived tissues. In this study, embolism repair was investigated in relation to xylem structure in two cushion plant species, Azorella macquariensis and Colobanthus muscoides, in which vascular water transport depends on <b>protoxylem.</b> Their <b>protoxylem</b> vessels consisted of a primary wall with helical thickenings that effectively formed a pit channel, with the primary wall being the pit channel membrane. Stem <b>protoxylem</b> was organized such that the pit channel membranes connected vessels with paratracheal parenchyma or other <b>protoxylem</b> vessels and were not exposed directly to air spaces. Embolism was experimentally induced in excised vascular tissue and detached shoots by exposing them briefly to air. When water was resupplied, embolized vessels refilled within tens of seconds (excised tissue) to a few minutes (detached shoots) with water sourced from either adjacent parenchyma or water-filled vessels. Refilling occurred in two phases: (1) water refilled xylem pit channels, simplifying bubble shape to a rod with two menisci; and (2) the bubble contracted as the resorption front advanced, dissolving air along the way. Physical properties of the <b>protoxylem</b> vessels (namely pit channel membrane porosity, hydrophilic walls, vessel dimensions, and helical thickenings) promoted rapid refilling of embolized conduits independent of root pressure. These results have implications for the maintenance of vascular function in both herbaceous and woody species, because <b>protoxylem</b> plays a major role in the hydraulic systems of leaves, elongating stems, and roots...|$|E
40|$|Polyamines are {{involved}} in key developmental processes and stress responses. Copper amine oxidases (CuAOs) oxidize the polyamine putrescine (Put) producing an aldheyde, ammonia and hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2). The Arabidopsis At 4 g 14940 gene (AtAO 1) encodes an apoplastic CuAO expressed at {{the early stages of}} vascular tissue differentiation in roots. Here, its role in root development and xylem differentiation was explored by pharmacological and forward/reverse genetic approaches. The analysis of AtAO 1 expression pattern in roots by a promoter::GFP-GUS fusion revealed a strong gene expression in the <b>protoxylem</b> at the transition, elongation and maturation zones. Methyl jasmonate (MeJA) induced AtAO 1 gene expression in vascular tissues, especially at the transition and elongation zones. Early <b>protoxylem</b> differentiation was observed upon MeJA treatment along with Put level decrease and H 2 O 2 accumulation in wild-type (WT) roots, whereas Atao 1 loss-of-function mutants were unresponsive to the hormone. The H 2 O 2 scavenger N,N 1 -dimethylthiourea (DMTU) reversed the MeJA-induced early <b>protoxylem</b> differentiation in WT seedlings. Likewise, Put, which had no effect on Atao 1 mutants, induced early <b>protoxylem</b> differentiation in WT, this event being counteracted by DMTU-treatment. Consistently, AtAO 1 over-expressing plants showed lower Put levels and early <b>protoxylem</b> differentiation concurrent with H 2 O 2 accumulation in the root zone where the first <b>protoxylem</b> cells with fully developed secondary wall thickenings are found. These results show that the H 2 O 2 produced via the AtAO 1 -driven Put oxidation plays a role in MeJA signaling leading to early <b>protoxylem</b> differentiation in root...|$|E
40|$|A {{polyclonal}} antibody {{was used to}} localize a glycine-rich cell wall protein (GRP 1. 8) in French bean hypocotyls with the indirect immunogold method. GRP 1. 8 could be localized mainly in the unlignified primary cell walls of the oldest <b>protoxylem</b> elements and also in cell corners of both proto- and metaxylem elements. In addition, GRP 1. 8 was detected in phloem using tissue printing. The labeled primary walls of dead <b>protoxylem</b> cells showed a characteristically dispersed ultrastructure, resulting from the action of hydrolases during the final steps of cell maturation and from mechanical stress due to hypocotyl growth. Primary walls of living <b>protoxylem</b> and adjacent parenchyma cells were only weakly labeled. This was true also for the secondary walls of proto- and metaxylem cells, which in addition showed high background labeling. Inhibition of lignification with a specific and potent inhibitor of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase {{did not lead to}} enhanced labeling of secondary walls, showing that lignin does not mask the presence of GRP 1. 8 in these walls. Dictyosomes of living proto- and metaxylem cells were not labeled, but dictyosomes of xylem parenchyma cells without secondary walls, adjacent to strongly labeled <b>protoxylem</b> elements, were clearly labeled. These observations suggest that GRP 1. 8 is not produced by xylem vessels but by xylem parenchyma cells that export the protein to the wall of <b>protoxylem</b> vessels...|$|E
40|$|Cell–cell {{communication}} {{is critical for}} tissue and organ development. In plants, secretory CLAVATA 3 /EMBRYO SURROUNDING REGION-related (CLE) peptides function as intercellular signaling molecules in various aspects of tissue development including vascular development. However, {{little is known about}} intracellular signaling pathways functioning in vascular development downstream of the CLE ligands. We show that CLE peptides including CLE 10, which is preferentially expressed in the root vascular system, inhibit <b>protoxylem</b> vessel formation in Arabidopsis roots. GeneChip analysis displayed that CLE 10 peptides repressed specifi cally the expression of two type-A Arabidopsis Response Regulators (ARR s), ARR 5 and ARR 6, whose products act as negative regulators of cytokinin signaling. The arr 5 arr 6 roots exhibited defective <b>protoxylem</b> vessel formation. These results indicate that CLE 10 inhibits <b>protoxylem</b> vessel formation by suppressing the expression of type-A ARR genes including ARR 5 and ARR 6. This was supported by the fi nding that CLE 10 did not suppress <b>protoxylem</b> vessel formation in a background of arr 10 arr 12, a double mutant of type-B ARR genes. Thus, our results revealed cross-talk between CLE signaling and cytokinin signaling in <b>protoxylem</b> vessel formation in roots. Taken together with the indication that cytokinin signaling functions downstream of the CLV 3 /WUS signaling pathway in the shoot apical meristem, the cross-talk between CLE and cytokinin signaling pathways may be a common feature in plant development...|$|E
40|$|The glycine-rich {{structural}} protein GRP 1. 8 of French bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) is specifically localized in the modified primary cell walls of <b>protoxylem</b> elements. Continuous deposition of GRP 1. 8 {{into the cell}} walls during elongation growth of the plant suggests that GRP 1. 8 {{is part of a}} repair mechanism to strengthen the <b>protoxylem.</b> In this work, a reporter-protein system was developed to study the interaction of GRP 1. 8 with the extracellular matrix. Fusion proteins of a highly soluble chitinase with different domains of GRP 1. 8 were expressed in the vascular tissue of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum), and the chemical nature of the interaction of these fusion proteins in the cell wall compartment was analyzed. In contrast with chitinase that required only low-salt conditions for complete extraction, the different chitinase/GRP 1. 8 fusion proteins were completely extracted only by a nonionic or ionic detergent, indicating hydrophobic interactions of GRP 1. 8. The same interactions were found with the endogenous GRP 1. 8 in bean hypocotyls. In addition, in vitro experiments indicate that oxidative cross-linking of tyrosines might account for the insolubilization of GRP 1. 8 observed in later stages of <b>protoxylem</b> development.

40|$|The {{development}} {{and growth of}} higher plants is highly dependent on the conduction of water and minerals throughout the plant by xylem vessels. In Arabidopsis roots the xylem is organized as an axis of cell files with two distinct cell fates: the central metaxylem and the peripheral <b>protoxylem.</b> During vascular development, high and low expression levels of the class III HD-ZIP transcription factors promote metaxylem and <b>protoxylem</b> identities, respectively. <b>Protoxylem</b> specification is determined by both mobile, ground tissue-emanating miRNA 165 / 6 species, which downregulate, and auxin concentrated by polar transport, which promotes HD-ZIP III expression. However, the factors promoting high HD-ZIP III expression for metaxylem identity have remained elusive. We show here that auxin biosynthesis promotes HD-ZIP III expression and metaxylem specification. Several auxin biosynthesis genes are expressed in the outer layers surrounding the vascular tissue in Arabidopsis root and downregulation of HD-ZIP III expression accompanied by specific defects in metaxylem development is seen in auxin biosynthesis mutants, such as trp 2 - 12, wei 8 tar 2 or a quintuple yucca mutant, and in plants treated with L-kynurenine, a pharmacological inhibitor of auxin biosynthesis. Some of the patterning defects can be suppressed by synthetically elevated HD-ZIP III expression. Taken together, our results indicate that polar auxin transport, which was earlier shown to be required for <b>protoxylem</b> formation, {{is not sufficient to}} establish a proper xylem axis but that root-based auxin biosynthesis is additionally required...|$|E

The spiny axes are characterized by cruciate dichotomy. Associated, but not in organic connection, with the vegetative axes, are numerous elongate elliptical or ovoid sporangia. One small branching system consisting of a single dichotomy bears the basal part of a sporangium, suggesting {{the possibility that the}} sporangia were borne terminally in pairs. Sections of permineralized segments of the axis reveal a columnar protostele, circular to elliptical in transverse section containing one or two roughly circular to transversely elongate (often lunate) regions of large parenchyma cells sparsely interspersed peripherally with tracheids of small diameter. We interpret these regions of parenchyma and tracheids to be <b>protoxylem</b> strands and development of primary xylem to be centrarch. During branching of an axis, the initially single <b>protoxylem</b> region in a branch stele divides precociously prior to the separation of the daughter axes.

The Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) gene At 4 g 14940 (AtAO 1, previously referred to as ATAO 1) encodes an apoplastic copper amine oxidase expressed in lateral root cap cells and developing xylem, especially in root <b>protoxylem</b> and metaxylem precursors. In our recent study, we demonstrated that AtAO 1 expression is strongly induced in the root vascular tissues by the wound-signal hormone methyl jasmonate (MeJA). Furthermore, we also demonstrated that the H 2 O 2 derived by the AtAO 1 -driven oxidation of putrescine, mediates the MeJA-induced early <b>protoxylem</b> differentiation in Arabidopsis roots. H 2 O 2 may contribute to <b>protoxylem</b> differentiation by signaling developmental cell death and by acting as co-substrate in peroxidase-mediated cell wall stiffening and lignin polymerization. Here, by the means of AtAO 1 promoter:: green fluorescent protein-b-glucuronidase (AtAO 1 ::GFP-GUS) fusion analysis, we show that a strong AtAO 1 gene expression occurs also in guard cells of leaves and flowers.
