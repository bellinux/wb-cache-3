5|$|Keynesian {{principles}} fared increasingly {{poorly on}} the practical side of economics – by 1979 {{they had been}} displaced by monetarism as the primary influence on Anglo-American economic policy. However, many officials {{on both sides of}} the Atlantic retained a preference for Keynes, and in 1984 the Federal Reserve officially discarded monetarism, after which Keynesian principles made a partial comeback as an influence on <b>policy</b> <b>making.</b>|$|E
5|$|As the {{economic}} situation kept deteriorating and the regime avoided implementation of the agreed reforms, the government and Solidarity representatives met in early August to discuss the outstanding issues. The talks ended in disagreement. During a conference of Solidarity's National Commission (a central representative <b>policy</b> <b>making</b> body) that followed, Modzelewski, Kuroń and others proposed a democratic transformation and practical arrangements by which the Union would take upon itself a major political role, participating in governing the country, accepting responsibility for the outcome and keeping social peace, thus relieving the (still) ruling party {{of some of its}} burdens. Such a deal was seen as the only constructive way forward, but it would require government partners interested in a negotiated solution.|$|E
5|$|Marine {{research}} at Dalhousie {{has become a}} large focus of the university, {{with many of the}} university's faculty members involved in some form of marine research. Notably, Dalhousie is the headquarters of the Ocean Tracking Network, a research effort using implanted acoustic transmitters to study fish migration patterns. Dalhousie houses a number of marine research pools, a wet laboratory, and a benthic flume, which are collectively known as the Aquatron laboratory. Dalhousie is one of the founding members of the Halifax Marine Research Institute, founded on 2 June 2011. The institute, which is a partnership between a number of private industries, government, and post-secondary institutions, was designed to help increase the scale, quality, internationalization and impact of marine research in the region. In 2011, the university, along with WWF-Canada, created the Conservation Legacy For Oceans, which aimed at providing scholarships, funding, curriculum development, and work placements for students and academics dedicated to marine research, law, management, and <b>policy</b> <b>making.</b>|$|E

5|$|Per , {{state and}} union governments, as duty, shall make further {{detailed}} policies and laws for implementation considering DPSPs as fundamental policy. In contrary to Article 37, many {{policies have been}} implemented by state and union governments which go against the DPSPs such as using intoxicating drinks as source of major tax revenue instead of implementing prohibition for better health of people, separation of judiciary from executive, uniform civil code for the citizen, etc. When the union government feels that a DPSP is no longer useful to the nation, it shall be deleted from Constitution by bringing {{a constitutional amendment to}} remove ambiguity in <b>policy</b> <b>making</b> / direction. Judiciary can repeal any policy/law devised by the government which is diametrically opposite to any DPSP.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after taking}} office, Cleveland {{was faced with}} the task of filling all the {{government}} jobs for which the president had the power of appointment. These jobs were typically filled under the spoils system, but Cleveland announced that he would not fire any Republican who was doing his job well, and would not appoint anyone {{solely on the basis of}} party service. He also used his appointment powers to reduce the number of federal employees, as many departments had become bloated with political time-servers. Later in his term, as his fellow Democrats chafed at being excluded from the spoils, Cleveland began to replace more of the partisan Republican officeholders with Democrats.; this was especially the case with <b>policy</b> <b>making</b> positions. While some of his decisions were influenced by party concerns, more of Cleveland's appointments were decided by merit alone than was the case in his predecessors' administrations.|$|E

40|$|Current {{approaches}} to foreign <b>policy</b> decision <b>making</b> and international conflict have ignored {{the role of}} emotions as variables influencing foreign policy choices. However, a growing area of political research suggests that emotions are of critical importance to many aspects of political life. Predominant foreign <b>policy</b> decision <b>making</b> models currently attend to either rational calculations or ??????cold?????? cognitive processes and heuristics. These models provide little theoretical space for propositions about how enduring and intense emotions such as hatred and fear influence perceptions and interpretations of interstate conflict. In this {{paper we propose a}} model which addresses this deficiency in foreign <b>policy</b> decision <b>making</b> research. A theory of emotions is introduced and integrated into the existing research on foreign <b>policy</b> decision <b>making.</b> Hypotheses pertaining to the influence of negative emotions on information processing and choice in international relations are derived from the model and tested in a multimethod setting. Findings are reported and discussed within the framework of existing empirical research on process-oriented models of foreign <b>policy</b> decision <b>making...</b>|$|R
