25|$|Red {{worked on}} new {{material}} for Until We Have Faces during their 2009â€“2010 tours. They travelled with a <b>portable</b> <b>case</b> that unfolds into a mini recording studio, {{allowing them to}} put down ideas {{in the green room}} at venues. In a departure from their usual songwriting methods, much of the demo material stemmed from Rauch's rhythms he developed for song ideas on his home kit, leaving {{the rest of the group}} to develop their parts from them. Barnes said the band wanted to direct the album towards the idea of someone finding their own identity, and drew inspirations from various sources, including the novel Till We Have Faces by C.S. Lewis.|$|E

50|$|Larvae {{have been}} found in <b>portable</b> <b>cases</b> within the seed {{capsules}} of Bursaria spinosa. They probably feed on the flowers and developing seeds of this plant.|$|R
50|$|The larvae feed {{on various}} aquatic plants, {{including}} Nymphaea odorata, Potamogeton natans, Potamogeton pusillus, Myriophyllum spicatum, Myriophyllum heterophyllum, Hydrochtoa caroliniensis, Eleocharis vivipara, Utricularia inflata and Salvinia rotundifolia. They {{live in a}} <b>portable</b> <b>cases,</b> made of plant material.|$|R

50|$|The larvae feed on {{the leaves}} of Acer and {{sometimes}} also Fagus, Quercus, Betula and huckleberry species. Older larvae cut two circular portions of a leaf and bind them together as a <b>portable</b> <b>case.</b> They have a brownish thorax, black head and translucent whitish abdomen. Larvae can be found from June to September. The species overwinters in the pupal stage on the ground inside the <b>portable</b> <b>case.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Integripalpia are a {{suborder}} of Trichoptera, the caddisflies. The name {{refers to}} the unringed nature of maxillary palp's terminal segment in the adults. Integripalpian larvae construct <b>portable</b> <b>cases</b> out of debris during the first larval instar, which are enlarged through subsequent instars. These cases are often very specific in construction at both the family and genus level.|$|R

5|$|Caddisflies {{are best}} known for the <b>portable</b> <b>cases</b> created by their larvae. About thirty {{families}} of caddisfly, members of the suborder Integripalpia, adopt this stratagem. These larvae eat detritus, largely decaying vegetable material, and the dead leaf fragments on which they feed tend to accumulate in hollows, in slow-moving sections of streams and behind stones and tree roots. The cases provide protection to the larvae as they make their way between these resources.|$|R

50|$|The {{adults are}} usually brown in colour, often with narrow mottled or {{patterned}} forewings and much broader, transparent hindwings. The aquatic larvae construct <b>portable</b> <b>cases</b> {{from a wide}} variety of plant and mineral materials, sometimes even snail shells. Cases of young larvae often looking completely different from those of larger instars. Larvae tend to be eruciform (with a thickset head and thorax), rather slow-moving, and usually feed by browsing algae or scavenging animal remains. They pupate within the larval case, the pupa swimming to the surface before flying away as an adult. For most species the life cycle is completed within one year.|$|R
50|$|The larvae {{probably}} feed on Phragmites species. They {{create a}} <b>portable</b> <b>case</b> of leaf fragments. Full-grown larvae reach {{a length of}} 15-18 mm.|$|E

5000|$|This small moth has a {{wingspan}} of 12-18 mm when adult. Their forewings are a plain greyish-buff with {{a golden}} hue, and bear the one large, one medium and one small clear-cut black dots referenced in the specific name trinotella. On the head, they have a tuft of yellow or orange hairs. The caterpillars live in small <b>portable</b> <b>cases</b> they build from debris held together with their own silk, just {{like those of the}} case-bearing clothes moth (T. pellionella) and other relatives. They typically inhabit bird nests [...] - [...] e.g. of chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus), domestic pigeon (Columba livia domestica), linnet (Carduelis cannabina) or common chaffinch (Fringilla coelebs) [...] - [...] where they feed on food remains and similar organic detritus. They have also been found on discarded woolen fabrics.|$|R
5|$|In {{contrast}} to larvae that have <b>portable</b> <b>cases,</b> {{members of the}} Annulipalpia have a completely different feeding strategy. They make fixed retreats in which they remain stationary, waiting for food to come to them. Members of the Psychomyiidae, Ecnomidae and Xiphocentronidae families construct simple tubes of sand and other particles held together by silk and anchored to the bottom, and feed on the accumulations of silt formed when suspended material is deposited. The tube can be lengthened when the growing larva needs to feed in new areas. More complex tubes, short and flattened, are built by Polycentropodidae larvae in hollows in rocks or other submerged objecte, sometimes with strands of silk suspended across the nearby surface. These larvae are carnivorous, resembling spiders in their feeding habits and rushing out of their retreat to attack any unwary small prey crawling across the surface.|$|R
50|$|The larvae feed on Succisa pratensis and Scabiosa columbaria. They first {{feed on the}} seeds. Later, {{they feed}} on the lower leaves from within a <b>portable</b> <b>case.</b>|$|E
50|$|The larvae feed on {{the green}} leaves of Eucalyptus tereticornis. They live in a silken tube between tied leaves. Pupation takes place in <b>portable</b> <b>case</b> of leaves.|$|E
50|$|The larvae feed on {{the flowers}} of Acacia baileyana and Acacia genistifolia. Later instar larvae live {{on the ground in}} a <b>portable</b> <b>case</b> made from flower parts or detritus.|$|E
5|$|The pupal cocoon is spun from silk, {{but like}} the larval case, often has other {{materials}} attached. When pupating, species that build <b>portable</b> <b>cases</b> attach them to some underwater object, seal {{the front and back}} apertures against predators while still allowing water to flow through, and pupate within it. Once fully developed, most pupal caddisflies cut through their cases with a special pair of mandibles, swim up to the water surface, moult using the exuviae as a floating platform, and emerge as fully formed adults. They can often fly immediately after breaking from their pupal cuticle. Emergence is mainly univoltine (once per year) with all the adults of a species emerging at the same time. Development is within a year in warm places, but takes over a year in high latitudes and at high elevation in mountain lakes and streams.|$|R
