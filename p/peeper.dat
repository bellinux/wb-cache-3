Many of the streams in Quehanna Wild Area are known for trout (brook, brown and rainbow); some populations are wild and others are stocked by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission and Mosquito Creek Sportsmen's Association.

25|$|As an artist, Shovelton {{began with}} scraperboard and ink drawing and later turned to {{watercolour}} painting. He {{also became a}} skilled calligrapher. He designed posters, flyers and other artwork for the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, including the programme cover for the company's {{last night at the}} Adelphi Theatre, as well as for all the Gawsworth Hall productions. He created the book covers and illustrated poem collections by his former tutor and friend, the geographer Jay Appleton. Shovelton's cartoons graced the monthly newsletter of the Gilbert and Sullivan Society of New York, The Palace <b>Peeper,</b> for over three decades. Shovelton also created numerous Gilbert and Sullivan themed Christmas, greeting and note cards, and was a keen photographer. He provided the cover illustration for a novel by Tony Joseph, The Diary of April March, and illustrated two books of poetry by his former tutor at Hull, Jay Appleton (Grains Among the Chaff and Enter the Fat Lady) and all three editions of Harry Benford's The Gilbert and Sullivan Lexicon (1978, 1991 and 1999).|$|E
5000|$|Running jokes {{tended to}} involve <b>Peepers</b> coping with misbehaving inanimate objects and with acutely {{embarrassing}} moments. In a typical moment, <b>Peepers</b> sees a hopscotch grid chalked on a sidewalk and, thinking himself alone, plays {{the game with}} abandon, {{only to discover that}} his girlfriend Nancy has been silently watching the entire time.The actors in the series lent appeal to the show. The principal's dithering wife, Mrs. Gurney, played by Marion Lorne, is kind and gracious but absentminded. In one episode, <b>Peepers</b> injures his finger with a hammer, and Mrs. Gurney solicitously bandages up his finger to at least five times its actual size. When she leaves the room, he points out to Nancy that she has actually bandaged the wrong finger. Tony Randall's role as Harvey Weskit is that of the handsome ladies' man who befriends <b>Peepers.</b> The confident and popular Weskit is a foil to the timid, bespectacled <b>Peepers,</b> and their friendship is incongruous. In one episode, Weskit points out a packet of unopened love letters that women have sent him, complaining that he is always getting them. He begins to look inside Peepers' locker to see the stack of similar letters he expects to find there, and <b>Peepers</b> quickly closes the locker door, commenting that he has to keep the door closed so that they won't all fall out. Patricia Benoit as Nancy Remington is Peepers' [...] "love at first sight," [...] although she seems unaware of his attraction to her at first. Peepers' bumbling attempts to approach her add charm and humor to the plot and leave the viewer waiting for their next encounter to see whether any progress will occur with their relationship. The episode in which <b>Peepers</b> married Nancy was, for 1954, a blockbuster ratings event, but it also {{marked the beginning of the}} series' slide in popularity.|$|R

6000|$|The {{letter of}} Rose Bradwardine to Waverley is alone enough to {{disprove}} Scott's disparagement of himself, {{his belief that}} he had been denied exquisiteness of touch. Nothing human is more delicate, nothing should be more delicately handled, than the first love of a girl. What the [...] "analytical" [...] modern novelist would pass over and dissect and place beneath his microscope till a student of any manliness blushes with shame and annoyance, Scott suffers Rose Bradwardine to reveal with a sensitive shyness. But Scott, of course, had even less in common with the <b>peeper</b> and botanizer on maidens' hearts than with the wildest romanticist. He considered that [...] "a want of story is always fatal to a book the first reading, and it is well if it gets a chance of a second." [...] From him [...] "Pride and Prejudice" [...] got a chance of three readings at least. This generous universality of taste, in addition to all his other qualities of humour and poetry, enabled Scott to raise the novel from its decadence, and to make the dry bones of history live again in his tales. With Charles Edward at Holyrood, as Mr. Senior wrote in the [...] "Quarterly Review," [...] "we are in the lofty region of romance. In any other hands than those of Sir Walter Scott, the language and conduct of those great people would have been as dignified as their situations. We should have heard nothing of the hero in his new costume 'majoring afore the muckle pier-glass,' of his arrest by the hint of the Candlestick, of his examination by the well-powdered Major Melville, or of his fears of being informed against by Mrs. Nosebag." [...] In short, [...] "while the leading persons and events are as remote from ordinary life as the inventions of Scudery, the picture of human nature is as faithful as could have been given by Fielding or Le Sage." [...] Though this criticism has not the advantage of being new, it is true; and when we have added that Scott's novels are the novels of the poet who, next to Shakspeare, knew mankind most widely and well, we have the secret of his triumph.|$|E
