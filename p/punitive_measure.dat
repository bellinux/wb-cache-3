25|$|During the 1973–74 winter season, Clarksons's plight worsened. At the time, the UK was in {{the grip}} of a recession, as a result of the early 1970s energy crisis caused by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' oil boycott of the West in the {{aftermath}} of the 1973 Arab–Israeli War. This was a <b>punitive</b> <b>measure</b> directed against these countries for their support of Israel during that war. It led to a drastic reduction in the availability of petroleum products — including jet fuel. This in turn resulted in a tripling of the oil price in October 1973 and a subsequent quadrupling.|$|E
25|$|The Sublime Porte {{issued a}} demand for Abdullah to pay a fine of 25,000 purses to {{compensate}} for the expenses of the siege, and detached the districts of Tripoli, Latakia, Gaza and Jaffa from Sidon Eyalet until Abdullah made the payment. Abdullah had exhausted his financial resources during the siege and decided to impose the entire fine on Sheikh Bashir Jumblatt of the Shuf in Mount Lebanon as a <b>punitive</b> <b>measure</b> for defecting from Abdullah's coalition during Darwish Pasha's campaign. Emir Bashir intervened so that Sheikh Bashir would only pay a third of the fine, while Emir Bashir and his subjects would make up the remainder. In 1824, the Sublime Porte restored the districts of Gaza and Jaffa to Abdullah's jurisdiction.|$|E

25|$|When the Syrian Revolt {{erupted in}} {{southern}} Syria in 1925, the French held in Aleppo State new elections {{that were supposed}} to lead to the breaking of the union with Damascus and restore the independence of Aleppo State. The French were driven to believe by pro-French Aleppine politicians that the people in Aleppo were supportive of such a scheme. After the new council was elected, however, it surprisingly voted to keep the union with Damascus. Syrian nationalists had waged a massive anti-secession public campaign that vigorously mobilized the people against the secession plan, thus leaving the pro-French politicians no choice but to support the union. The result was a big embarrassment for France, which wanted the secession of Aleppo to be a <b>punitive</b> <b>measure</b> against Damascus, which had participated in the Syrian Revolt. This was the last time that independence was proposed for Aleppo.|$|E
500|$|At the Berlin Conference in 1884, Germany claimed several colonies {{including}} German East Africa, German South West Africa, Togoland, and Kamerun. Later, Germany further {{expanded its}} colonial empire to include German New Guinea, German Micronesia and German Samoa in the Pacific, and Kiautschou Bay in China. In {{what became known}} as the [...] "First Genocide of the Twentieth-Century", between 1904 and 1907, the German colonial government in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) ordered the annihilation of the local Herero and Namaqua peoples, as a <b>punitive</b> <b>measure</b> for an uprising against German colonial rule. In total, around 100,000 people—80% of the Herero and 50% of the Namaqua—perished from imprisonment in concentration camps, where the majority died of disease, abuse, and exhaustion, or from dehydration and starvation in the countryside after being deprived of food and water.|$|E
500|$|Kentucky {{historian}} Thomas D. Clark {{wrote that}} Desha [...] "made rash promises {{to relieve the}} horde of bankrupt voters... promises on which he had to deliver." [...] His first address to the legislature was critical of the judiciary in general, especially the Supreme Court's recent decision {{in the case of}} Green v. Biddle which held that land claims granted by Virginia in the District of Kentucky prior to Kentucky becoming a separate state took precedence over those later granted by the state of Kentucky if the two were in conflict. Encouraged by Desha's strong stance against the judiciary, Relief partisans set about removing the judges on the Court of Appeals who had earlier struck down their debt relief legislation. The first <b>punitive</b> <b>measure</b> proposed against the offending judges was to reduce their salaries to 25 cents per year, but this course was quickly abandoned. Next, legislators attempted to remove the judges by address, but they found they lacked the necessary two-thirds majority in both houses to effect this removal.|$|E

500|$|By Louis's reign, Bastille {{prisoners were}} {{detained}} using a [...] "lettre de cachet", [...] "a letter under royal seal", {{issued by the}} king and countersigned by a minister, ordering a named person to be held. Louis, closely involved in this aspect of government, personally decided who should be imprisoned at the Bastille. The arrest itself involved an element of ceremony: the individual would be tapped on the shoulder with a white baton and formally detained {{in the name of}} the king. Detention in the Bastille was typically ordered for an indefinite period and there was considerable secrecy over who had been detained and why: the legend of the [...] "Man in the Iron Mask", a mysterious prisoner who finally died in 1703, symbolises this period of the Bastille. Although in practice many were held at the Bastille as a form of punishment, legally a prisoner in the Bastille was only being detained for preventative or investigative reasons: the prison was not officially supposed to be a <b>punitive</b> <b>measure</b> in its own right. The average length of imprisonment in the Bastille under Louis XIV was approximately three years.|$|E
500|$|According to oral history, Andriamasinavalona was {{temporarily}} usurped through the trickery {{of his son}} Andriantomponimerina, who ruled the western territory from his rova at Ambohidratrimo. Once Andriamasinavalona's sons had been installed in their territories, Andriantomponimerina tested his authority by imposing a particular hairstyle upon the Marovatana people he ruled, in disregard of the promise that the king had made to respect the diverse customs and taboos of Imerina. The Marovatana reminded the king of this vow and refused to submit, prompting the king and his sons to prepare for war against {{the people of the}} fief. This conflict provided the prince with an opportunity to seize power. Upon the suggestion of the prince's half-brother, Andrianentoarivo, the prince hid himself in a trench he dug into the dirt floor of his royal residence at Ambohidratrimo, then ordered his people to send word to his father that he was [...] "in the ground". Believing his son to be buried alive by the Marovatana as a <b>punitive</b> <b>measure,</b> Andriamasinavalona hurried to Ambohidratrimo carrying reeds as a symbol of peace; upon the king's entrance into the residence, however, Prince Andriantomponimerina locked Andriamasinavalona inside and refused to release him for the next seven years. During this time the prince repeatedly offered to free the king on the condition that Andriamasinavalona accept to transfer power to him, which the king repeatedly refused. Andriantomponimerina prevented his brothers from taking action against him by telling their messengers that the king simply preferred his company and had decided to reside with him at Ambohidratrimo.|$|E
500|$|On {{basis of}} the {{available}} data and materials accumulated in {{the archives of the}} International Association on the Political Use of Psychiatry, one can confidently conclude that thousands of dissenters were hospitalized for political reasons. From 1994 to 1995, an investigative commission of Moscow psychiatrists explored the records of five prison psychiatric hospitals in Russia and discovered about two thousand cases of political abuse of psychiatry in these hospitals alone. In 2004, Anatoly Prokopenko said he was surprised at the facts obtained by him from the official classified top secret documents by the Central Committee of the CPSU, by the KGB, and MVD. According to his calculations based on what he found in the documents, about 15,000 people were confined for political crimes in the psychiatric prison hospitals {{under the control of the}} MVD. In 2005, referring to the Archives of the CPSU Central Committee and the records of the three Special Psychiatrial Hospitals— Sychyovskaya, Leningrad and Chernyakhovsk hospitals— to which human rights activists gained access in 1991, Prokopenko concluded that psychiatry had been used as <b>punitive</b> <b>measure</b> against about 20,000 people for purely political reasons. This was only a small part of the total picture, Prokopenko said. The data on the total number of people who had been held in all sixteen prison hospitals and in the 1,500 [...] "open" [...] psychiatric hospitals remains unknown because parts of the archives of the prison psychiatric hospitals and hospitals in general are classified and inaccessible. The figure of fifteen or twenty thousand political prisoners in psychiatric hospitals run by the Soviet Ministry of Internal Affairs was first put forward by Prokopenko in the 1997 book Mad Psychiatry ("Безумная психиатрия"), which was republished in 2005.|$|E

He commented that the scandal was largely owed to the victim's father having made use of his political connections with the Ion Brătianu cabinet, and protested when the teacher assigned a provincial post as a <b>punitive</b> <b>measure.</b> This {{was one of several}} polemics between Eminescu and various associates of Rosetti: literary historian Perpessicius argued that they were partly responsible for the [...] "super-tensed" [...] relations between Românul and Timpul.
