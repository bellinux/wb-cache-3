50|$|The {{capacitor}} in the {{stacked capacitor}} scheme is constructed {{above the surface}} of the substrate. The capacitor is constructed from an oxide-nitride-oxide (ONO) dielectric sandwiched in between two layers of polysilicon plates (the top plate is shared by all DRAM cells in an IC), and its shape can be a rectangle, a cylinder, or some other more complex shape. There are two basic variations of the stacked capacitor, based on its location relative to the bitline - capacitor-over-bitline (COB) and capacitor-under-bitline (CUB). In a former variation, the capacitor is underneath the bitline, which is usually made of metal, and the bitline has a polysilicon contact that extends downwards to connect it to the access transistor's source terminal. In the latter variation, the capacitor is constructed above the bitline, which is almost always made of polysilicon, but is otherwise identical to the COB variation. The advantage the COB variant <b>possesses</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> ease of fabricating the contact between the bitline and the access transistor's source as it is physically close to the substrate surface. However, this requires the active area to be laid out at a 45-degree angle when viewed from above, which makes it difficult to ensure that the capacitor contact does not touch the bitline. CUB cells avoid this, but suffer from difficulties in inserting contacts in between bitlines, since the size of features this close to the surface are at or near the minimum feature size of the process technology (Kenner, pp. 33-42).|$|E

5000|$|Beginning in 1899, the Victoria Copper Mining Company {{started running}} the mine and Captain Hooper {{was hired to}} run the operation. One of the first {{problems}} Hooper encountered {{was a lack of}} fuel. Wood was hard to come by at that time and coal was expensive, so Hooper began to look into other energy sources. Even as early as 1882, the possibility of hydropower was discussed. The Michigan Department of Mineral Statistics annual report in 1882 stated: “Among the important advantages which the property <b>possesses</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> water-power in the west branch of the Ontonagon river, about a mile south of the mine; forty feet of head can be used here…If it shall be decided to systematically work the mine, the water-power in the west branch will undoubtedly be utilized to operate the machinery…”. In 1904, Charles Havelock Taylor, a Canadian inventor, visited the site in order to build a hydraulic air compressor that would harness the water in the Ontonagon River. Once running, the Taylor Air Compressor was able provided the Victoria Mine with an inexpensive power source which uniquely equipped the mine with the ability to extract the low grade ore. In fact, the Mines Register reported that the Victoria was “placed in a position to handle rock of lower average grade than perhaps any other mine in the Lake Superior district”. During this time, the village near the mine site, Victoria, grew to eighty houses. All buildings in the town were owned by the mining company, including the school, general store, and houses. The inhabitants of the town were miners and their families. These miners were paid average wages of the time: $1 a day for a ten-hour day and later $2 for the same amount of time. [...] Records from this time {{are hard to come by}} and so it is unknown exactly how much copper was mined during this time. The mine ran almost continuously for nearly twenty years, but as the 1920s approached, the price of copper started to decline. The cheap power provided by the Taylor Air Compressor allowed the Victoria Mine to remain open longer than most of its competitors. After World War I ended, though, copper prices fell by fifty percent to 13 cents per pound. When the price dropped to 11 cents a pound, the Victoria Mine closed for the final time.|$|E

In our present study, the effect of koumine on lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -mediated RAW 264. 7 cell apoptosis was evaluated. MTT assays showed that koumine obviously increased cell viability in LPS-mediated RAW 264. 7 macrophages. Preincubation with koumine ameliorated LPS-medicated apoptosis by decreasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, which resulted in a significant decrease in the levels of nitric oxide (NO) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). In addition, koumine-pretreated RAW 264. 7 macrophages exhibited reduction of LPS-induced levels of TNF-α, IL- 1 β, and IL- 6 mRNA. Furthermore, pretreatment with koumine suppressed LPS-mediated p 53 activation, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, caspase- 3 activation, decrease of Bcl- 2 expression, and elevation of Bax and caspase- 3 expressions, suggesting that koumine might act directly on RAW 264. 7 cells to inhibit LPS-induced apoptosis. It seems as though the mechanism that koumine <b>possesses</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> anti-apoptotic effect mediated by suppressing production of ROS, activation of p 53, and mitochondrial apoptotic pathways in RAW 264 cells.

40|$|It is {{traditionally}} {{thought that the}} value of one's nation is not merely the sum of life, liberty and security; but rather something over and above these things. Given that one's own nation seems to be valuable in and of itself, it seems essential that nations possess a degree of immunity from foreign interference. Cosmopolitans criticise this view of the nation and argue that, given human beings are fundamentally similar, the only value that one's own nation <b>possesses</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> instrumental value of protecting human rights. Further to this, cosmopolitans argue that valuing one's nation is an obstacle in realising human rights globally. However, there is a worry that cosmopolitanism may lead to an imperialism of liberalism, with a global order that coercively forces liberal values on every nation. My thesis aims to show the importance of nationalism, within a broadly cosmopolitan framework. This is to be achieved by developing a republican theory of legitimate violent conflict. The idea is that if we can determine when violent resistance against authority is morally acceptable, we can determine what states ought to be entitled to international respect and which states are not. This analysis will show that traditional non-interventionist views are untenable, but also that fundamental cosmopolitan views on foreign intervention are also untenable. We begin this discussion by first looking briefly at just war theory. Rather than begin with an abstract question (should states possess sovereignty?), we will begin with the more practical discussion of when foreign interference is justified in order to illuminate the practical consequences of the competing views...|$|E

The expression is also helpful to classify the spectra into multipole order parameters which are brought about.

The sixfold symmetry in the AFQ phase arises from the simultaneously induced hexadecapole order.

40|$|Arguably, one of {{the most}} {{important}} wars in our World's History, WWII stands out for its magnitude, the ferocity in which it was fought, and for the consequences that resulted. Officially fought between the years 1940 - 1945, its beginning is not easily defined. Some historians believe WWII actually began as early as the conclusion of WW 1 in 1918. Regardless of when WWII began, the War itself impacted the entire World. It was an extremely complex War fought on multiple fronts: militarily, economically, ideologically, and politically. Due to its complexity, WWII is {{one of the}} most interesting events in our World's History to study, learn, and write about. This is demonstrated by the astonishing amount of resources available to study regarding the Second World War. While there is an abundance of resources available, historians still debate why the Allied Powers were successfully able to win the War. Once again, due to the War's complexity, historians have arrived at a multitude of different reasons the Allies won. In this thesis paper, I will explain my personal belief of why the Allies won, focusing on six main elements that led to the Allies' success. I will discuss the importance and interaction of the Battle of the Atlantic, the Battles of the Eastern Front (Soviet Union's sacrifice), the Allied Bombing, the superior Allied technology/military power, Allied moral motivations, and the strength of Allied leadership to demonstrate why the Allies won WWII. However, it is also important to be able to teach our future generations about the important historic events that have shaped the world in which they live. One of the biggest tests to the amount of understanding about a topic an individual <b>possesses</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> ability to teach the topic to another person.
