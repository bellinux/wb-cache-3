5|$|Silicon carbide is a {{semiconductor}} {{in research}} and early mass production providing advantages for fast, high-temperature and/or high-voltage devices. The first devices available were Schottky diodes, followed by junction-gate FETs and MOSFETs for high-power switching. Bipolar transistors and thyristors are currently developed. A major problem for SiC commercialization has been the elimination of defects: edge dislocations, screw dislocations (both hollow and closed core), triangular defects and basal plane dislocations. As a result, devices made of SiC crystals initially displayed poor reverse blocking performance though researchers have been tentatively finding solutions to improve the breakdown performance. Apart from crystal quality, problems with the interface of SiC with silicon dioxide have hampered the development of SiC-based power MOSFETs and insulated-gate bipolar transistors. Although the mechanism is still unclear, nitridation has dramatically reduced the defects causing the interface problems. In 2008, the first commercial JFETs rated at 1200 V {{were introduced to the}} market, followed in 2011 by the first commercial MOSFETs rated at 1200 V. Beside SiC switches and SiC Schottky diodes (also Schottky barrier diode, SBD) in the popular TO-247 and TO-220 packages, companies started even earlier to implement the bare chips into their power electronic modules. SiC SBD diodes found wide market spread being used in PFC circuits and IGBT <b>power</b> <b>modules.</b>|$|E

25|$|The Uzlovoy Module (UM), or Node Module is a 4-metric-ton ball-shaped module {{that will}} allow docking of two {{scientific}} and <b>power</b> <b>modules</b> during {{the final stage of}} the station assembly, and provide the Russian segment additional docking ports to receive Soyuz MS and Progress MS spacecraft. UM is due to be launched in late 2018. It will be integrated with a special version of the Progress cargo ship and launched by a standard Soyuz rocket. Progress would use its own propulsion and flight control system to deliver and dock the Node Module to the nadir (Earth-facing) docking port of the Nauka MLM/FGB-2 module. One port is equipped with an active hybrid docking port, which enables docking with the MLM module. The remaining five ports are passive hybrids, enabling docking of Soyuz and Progress vehicles, as well as heavier modules and future spacecraft with modified docking systems. The node module was conceived to serve as the only permanent element of the future Russian successor to the ISS, OPSEK. Equipped with six docking ports, the Node Module would serve as a single permanent core of the future station with all other modules coming and going as their life span and mission required. This would be a progression beyond the ISS and Russia's modular Mir space station, which are in turn more advanced than early monolithic first generation stations such as Skylab, and early Salyut and Almaz stations.|$|E
40|$|In {{support of}} the Space Station Freedom (SSF) Solar Dynamic <b>Power</b> <b>Module</b> effort, {{structural}} design studies were performed to investigate {{issues related to the}} design of the <b>power</b> <b>module,</b> its pointing capabilities, and the integration of the module into the SSF infrastructure. Of particular concern from a structural viewpoint are the dynamics of the <b>power</b> <b>module,</b> the impact of the <b>power</b> <b>module</b> on the Space Station dynamics and controls, and the required control effort for obtaining the specified Solar Dynamic <b>Power</b> <b>Module</b> pointing accuracy. Structural analyses were performed to determine the structural dynamics attributes of both the existing and the proposed structural dynamics module designs. The objectives of these analyses were to generate validated Solar Dynamic <b>Power</b> <b>Module</b> NASTRAN finite element models, combine Space Station and <b>power</b> <b>module</b> models into integrated system models, perform finite element modal analyses to assess the effect of the relocations of the <b>power</b> <b>module</b> center of mass, and provide modal data to controls designers for control systems design...|$|R

40|$|The design {{feasibility}} study is documented {{of a single}} cylinder, free piston Stirling engine/linear alternator (FPSE/LA) <b>power</b> <b>module</b> generating 150 kW-electric (kW sub e), and {{the determination of the}} <b>module's</b> maximum feasible <b>power</b> level. The <b>power</b> <b>module</b> configuration was specified to be a single cylinder (single piston, single displacer) FPSE/LA, with tuning capacitors if required. The design requirements were as follows: (1) Maximum electrical power output; (2) <b>Power</b> <b>module</b> thermal efficiency equal to or greater than 20 percent at a specific mass of 5 to 8 kg/kW(sub e); (3) Heater wall temperature/cooler wall temperature = 1050 K/ 525 K; (4) Sodium heat-pipe heat transport system, pumped loop NaK (sodium-potassium eutectic mixture) rejection system; (5) Maximum <b>power</b> <b>module</b> vibration amplitude = 0. 0038 cm; and (6) Design life = 7 years (60, 000 hr). The results show that a single cylinder FPSE/LA is capable of meeting program goals and has attractive scaling attributes over the power range from 25 to 150 kW(sub e). Scaling beyond the 150 kW(sub e) power level, the <b>power</b> <b>module</b> efficiency falls and the <b>power</b> <b>module</b> specific mass reaches 10 kg/kW(sub e) at a power output of 500 kW(sub e). A discussion of scaling rules for the engine, alternator, and heat transport systems is presented, along with {{a detailed description of the}} conceptual design of a 150 kW(sub e) <b>power</b> <b>module</b> that meets the requirements. Included is a discussion of the design of a dynamic balance system. A parametric study of <b>power</b> <b>module</b> performance conducted over the power output range of 25 to 150 kW(sub e) for temperature ratios of 1. 7, 2. 0, 2. 5, and 3. 0 is presented and discussed. The results show that as the temperature ratio decreases, the efficiency falls and specific mass increases. At a temperature ratio of 1. 7, the 150 kW(sub e) <b>power</b> <b>module</b> cannot satisfy both efficiency and specific mass goals. As the power level increases from 25 to 150 kW(sub e) at a fixed temperature ratio, <b>power</b> <b>module</b> efficiency is seen to increase slightly, but at the expense of increased specific mass. An empirical equation relating <b>power</b> <b>module</b> thermal efficiency as a function of <b>power</b> <b>module</b> specific mass, <b>power</b> output, and temperature ratio is developed. Alternative configurations to the single cylinder, direct coupled linear alternator approach are also evaluated, but are shown to have technical drawbacks that lessen their attractiveness. The dynamic balance assembly mass (moving mass and structure) represents 20 to 30 percent of the total single cylinder <b>power</b> <b>module</b> mass. Joining two modules in a balanced opposed configuration eliminates the need for the balancer, and a hot end junction can be made without significant addition of structural mass. Recommendations are made for evaluation of advanced heat pipe concepts, tests of radial flow heat exchangers, and evaluation of high temperature alternator materials...|$|R
