5000|$|Accepting one’s own {{feelings}} of vulnerability and dependence demonstrates {{the act of}} movement toward people. Moving toward people {{is the only way}} a person can feel secure.

Once we establish a behavioral strategy for coping with basic anxiety, this pattern ceases to be flexible enough to permit alternative behaviors.|$|R

5|$|In his Commentary on Isaiah (1529), Zwingli {{noted that}} there were three kinds of governments: monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy.

In the publication, rather than comparing the three forms of government, he gave a defence of aristocracy against a monarchy. He argued that a monarchy would invariably descend to tyranny. A monarchy had inherent weaknesses in that a good ruler could be easily replaced by a bad one or a single ruler could be easily corrupted. An aristocracy with more <b>people</b> <b>involved</b> did not have these disadvantages.|$|E
