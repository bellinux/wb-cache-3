50|$|Intelsat {{arranged}} for a rescue of 603 by the US Space Shuttle. STS-49 was launched on May 7, 1992, 7:40 p.m. EDT. Three of the shuttle astronauts successfully captured the satellite by hand on May 14, 1992, after several failed attempts using a capture bar. After being secured in the shuttle cargo bay, a new <b>perigee</b> <b>kick</b> <b>motor</b> was installed. Intelsat 603 {{was released from the}} shuttle and the <b>perigee</b> <b>kick</b> <b>motor</b> was successfully ignited and 603 was placed into the proper geostationary orbit.|$|E
50|$|The Intelsat 603 satellite, {{stranded}} in an unusable orbit since launch aboard a Commercial Titan III rocket in March 1990, {{was captured by}} crewmembers during an EVA (extra-vehicular activity) and equipped with a new <b>perigee</b> <b>kick</b> <b>motor.</b> The satellite was subsequently released into orbit and the new motor fired to put the spacecraft into a geosynchronous orbit for operational use.|$|E
5000|$|During STS-51-D, {{the shuttle}} crew {{deployed}} two communications satellites: Telesat-I (Anik C1) and Syncom IV-3 (also known as Leasat-3). Telesat-I {{was attached to}} a Payload Assist Module (PAM-D) motor and successfully deployed. Syncom IV-3, however, failed to initiate antenna deployment and spin-up, or ignite its <b>perigee</b> <b>kick</b> <b>motor</b> upon deployment. The mission was consequently extended by two days {{to ensure that the}} satellite's spacecraft sequencer start lever was in its proper position. Griggs and Hoffman performed an unscheduled EVA to attach homemade [...] "Flyswatter" [...] devices to the shuttle's Remote Manipulator System (RMS). Seddon then engaged the satellite's start lever using the RMS, but again the post-deployment sequence did not begin.|$|E
50|$|The Long March 2E was {{the first}} in the Long March rocket family to {{introduce}} liquid rocket boosters, as well as a solid rocket <b>perigee</b> <b>kick</b> stage, to improve its GTO payload capacity to satisfy the domestic and international launch market in the 1990s. It was first launched in 1992.|$|R

50|$|Westar 6, also an HS-376 based satellite, was {{launched}} from STS-41-B on February 3, 1984, {{to be put}} into service afterward, but the <b>perigee</b> <b>kick</b> <b>motor</b> (also known as the Payload Assist Module, or PAM) on the satellite failed during its approach to geosynchronous orbit, placing it at an improper and inoperable low Earth orbit. It was retrieved on November 16, 1984, by the STS-51-A mission of NASA's Space Shuttle, where it was brought back to earth. It was then resold to AsiaSat in Hong Kong, who refurbished it and relaunched it on April 7, 1990 as AsiaSat 1. The Space Shuttle mission to retrieve Westar 6, as well as the Palapa B2 satellite which shared the launch payload with Westar 6, was funded by the insurance companies that insured the launch of those two satellites.|$|E
5000|$|The third SYNCOM IV {{spacecraft}} was deployed {{along with}} Telesat Canada's Anik-C satellite during Discovery's mission in mid-April 1985. Discovery lifted off Pad 39A at 1359:05Z on 12 April 1985. Discovery's crew deployed the Anik-C satellite successfully {{on the first}} day of the mission, and the SYNCOM IV was deployed on Day 2. Unfortunately, the SYNCOM IV's <b>perigee</b> <b>kick</b> <b>motor</b> failed to fire, and two more days were added to the mission to allow a rendezvous and an improvised restart of the spacecraft. Two [...] "flyswatter" [...] devices were attached to the Shuttle's Remote Manipulating System (RMS) to allow the crew to depress the SYNCOM IV's timer switch. Despite a successful rendezvous and a switch reset on Day 6, the attempt failed. The SYNCOM IV spacecraft was left in orbit to be retrieved and redeployed in early September 1985. Discovery landed at KSC's Shuttle Landing Facility at 1355:37Z on 19 April 1985.|$|E
5000|$|Discovery's sixth {{trip into}} space was {{launched}} in late August 1985. The countdown was started again at 0205Z on 27 August, and it proceeded smoothly except for a three-minute extension in a built-in hold to clear traffic in a solid rocket booster retrieval area. Discovery lifted off Pad 39A at 1058:01Z on 27 August 1985. The AUSSAT-1 spacecraft was ejected from the orbiter's cargo bay at 1733Z on the 27th, and the satellite's deployment and <b>perigee</b> <b>kick</b> <b>motor</b> burns were both successful. The ASC-1 deployment and boost were also successful on Day 1 of the mission. The SYNCOM IV-4 deployment went extremely well on Day 3, and Discovery's crew prepared for their rendezvous with the wayward SYNCOM IV-3 spacecraft on Day 5. The spacecraft was retrieved and repairs were completed on the satellite on Day 6 of the mission. SYNCOM IV-3 was redeployed at 1512Z on 1 September 1985. Unlike its earlier performance in April, the spacecraft began sending good telemetry data to ground stations shortly thereafter. Discovery landed on Edwards' Runway 23 at 1315Z on 3 September 1985.|$|E

50|$|The second launch {{occurred}} on 14 March, {{and carried the}} Intelsat 603 satellite. The rocket's second stage failed to separate, and the payload could only be released from the rocket by means of jettisoning its <b>kick</b> <b>motor.</b> It was later visited by , on mission STS-49. Astronauts attached a new <b>kick</b> <b>motor,</b> which raised the satellite into a geosynchronous transfer orbit, as had originally been planned.|$|R
5000|$|STS-32 {{launched}} from Kennedy Space Center (KSC), Florida, on 9 January 1990 at 7:35:00 am EST. The launch was initially scheduled for 18 December 1989, but was later postponed {{to allow the}} modifications to Pad A to be completed and verified. The second scheduled launch, on 8 January 1990, was aborted due to weather conditions. Columbia had a mission launch weight of 255,994 lb (116,117 kg). [...] The primary objectives of the mission were to deploy the Syncom IV-F5 defense communications satellite (also known as Leasat 5), and to retrieve NASAs Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF), whose retrieval had been delayed for 4 years by scheduling changes and the Challenger disaster of 1986. Syncom IV-F5 was deployed on the second flight day, and a third-stage Minuteman solid <b>perigee</b> <b>kick</b> <b>motor</b> propelled it into a geosynchronous orbit. Dunbar retrieved the LDEF {{on the fourth day}} of the flight using the shuttles Remote Manipulator System. The timeliness of the retrieval was of critical importance, because a high rate of solar flux had increased the density of the LDEFs orbital environment and accelerated its rate of orbital decay. Specialists who carefully monitored the stability of the crafts orbit had anticipated that if the LDEF was not retrieved in time, it would pass too low for the shuttle to safely reach, and could be destroyed during re-entry in February 1990. Thus, the missions exact liftoff time was determined about 12 hours before launch, using the latest tracking data on LDEF. It was flown on a 352 km orbit inclined 28.5 degrees to the equator.|$|E
40|$|If the Space Transportation System is {{to serve}} in the 1980 's for {{launching}} geostationary satellites that presently use the Delta and Centaur boosters, the cost of STS launches must be competitive. This can be accomplished through the provision of a multiple-launch capability in the orbiter, combined with the design of a low cost, spinning solid <b>perigee</b> <b>kick</b> <b>motor</b> (PKM). The PKM will be attached to the spacecraft and function essentially as the Delta third stage does today...|$|E
40|$|A {{contract}} was completed to design, build, and test a Payload Spin Assembly (PSA) for installation onto the Martin Marietta Titan 3 Commercial launch vehicle. This assembly provides launch support for satellite payloads up to 5783 kilograms (6. 37 tons) and controls release, spin-up, and final {{separation of the}} satellite from the second stage. Once separated, the satellite's <b>Perigee</b> <b>Kick</b> <b>Motor</b> (PKM) boosts the satellite into its transfer orbit. The first successful flight occurred December 31, 1989.

40|$|A {{potentially}} {{cost effective}} technique was investigated of launching operational satellites into synchronous orbit using the space transportation system (STS). This technique uses an unguided spinning solid rocket motor {{as the means}} for boosting a satellite from a low altitude shuttle parking orbit into a synchronous transfer orbit. The spacecraft is then injected into a geosynchronous orbit by an apogee kick motor fired at transfer orbit apogee. The approach is essentially that used on all Delta and Atlas-Centaur launches of synchronous satellites with the shuttle orbiter performing {{the function of the}} first two stages of the Delta three stage launch vehicle and the <b>perigee</b> <b>kick</b> <b>motor</b> performing the function of the Delta third state. It is concluded that the STS can be useful to the space communication community as well as to other geostationary satellite system users if the recommended actions are implemented...|$|E
40|$|A three-axis {{controlled}} spacecraft (1), {{typically a}} satellite, is spun up about its roll axis (20) prior to firing a motor (2), i. e., a <b>perigee</b> <b>kick</b> <b>motor,</b> {{to achieve the}} requisite degree of angular momentum stiffness. Thrusters (21) for imparting rotation about the roll axis (20) are activated in open-loop fashion, typically at less than full duty cycle. Cross-axis torques induced by this rotational motion are compensated for by means of closed control loops {{for each of the}} pitch and yaw axes (30, 40, respectively). Each closed control loop combines a prebias torque (72) with torques (75, 74) representative of position and rate feedback information, respectively. A deadband (52) within each closed control loop can be widened during the spinup, to conserve fuel. Position feedback information (75) in each of the control loops is disabled upon saturation of the gyroscope associated with the roll axis (20) ...|$|E

5000|$|An apogee <b>kick</b> <b>motor</b> is used, for example, for {{satellites}} {{launched into}} a geostationary orbit. As {{the vast majority of}} geostationary satellite launches are carried out from spaceports at a significant distance away from Earth's equator, the carrier rocket often only launches the satellite into an orbit with a non-zero inclination approximately equal to the latitude of the launch site. This orbit is commonly known as a [...] "geostationary transfer orbit" [...] or a [...] "geosynchronous transfer orbit". The satellite must then provide thrust to bring forth the needed delta v to reach a geostationary orbit. This is typically done with a fixed onboard apogee <b>kick</b> <b>motor.)</b> When the satellite reaches its orbit's apogee position, the AKM is ignited, transforming the elliptical orbit into a circular orbit, {{while at the same time}} bringing the inclination to around zero degrees, thereby accomplishing the insertion into a geostationary orbit. This process is called an [...] "apogee kick".|$|R
