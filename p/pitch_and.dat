5|$|In 1989, {{a project}} was started to bring Bodø/Glimt {{back to the}} top league. Among the most {{important}} issues was to secure better training facilities, particularly during the Arctic winter. The club proposed upgrading the artificial turf field at Aspmyra with a new field with under-soil heating, in addition to constructing both a new gravel <b>pitch</b> <b>and</b> an indoor training hall with a full-size pitch. The Municipal Committee for Sport and Culture stated that they wanted to prioritize the artificial turf field over a gravel pitch. They therefore proposed that NOK3.5 million be allocated to lay under-soil heating on the artificial turf <b>pitch</b> <b>and</b> remove the turf. New artificial turf would be laid at a later date, when funding could be allocated. This was agreed upon, construction started on 24 October 1989 and was scheduled for completion ahead of the winter training. However, the Football Association of Norway (NFF) stated that the club {{would not be allowed to}} play their matches on a gravel <b>pitch,</b> <b>and</b> the grass at Aspmyra was in so bad condition that it would not be permitted for play in the top league, should the team be promoted. The municipal council therefore gave grants to finance a new artificial turf on the training pitch, which was taken into use in 1990.|$|E

5|$|Triumph in the 1976 League Cup final gave Manchester City a {{place in}} the UEFA Cup after a {{four-year}} absence. City drew Juventus in the first round.

Juventus {{went on to win the}} competition. As league runners-up in 1976–77, Manchester City again qualified for the UEFA Cup. Drawn against Widzew Łódź, City drew the first leg at Maine Road 2–2. In the late 1970s, hooliganism was becoming a more prominent part of English football. Following an incident where a fan invaded the <b>pitch</b> <b>and</b> attacked Widzew's Zbigniew Boniek, City were fined by UEFA, and fencing was erected between the <b>pitch</b> <b>and</b> the stands.
