50|$|The FAA {{has spent}} over US$3 billion on software, but a fully {{automated}} system is still over the horizon. In 2002 the UK {{brought a new}} area <b>control</b> <b>centre</b> into service at the London Area <b>Control</b> <b>Centre,</b> Swanwick, Hampshire, relieving a busy suburban centre at West Drayton, Middlesex, north of London Heathrow Airport. Software from Lockheed-Martin predominates at the London Area <b>Control</b> <b>Centre.</b> However, the centre was initially troubled by software and communications problems causing delays and occasional shutdowns.|$|R
5000|$|Initially {{individual}} SCADA manufacturers {{developed their}} own proprietary [...] "closed" [...] protocols for communicating from a <b>control</b> <b>centre</b> to electrical equipment in the field. These were followed {{by the development of}} [...] "open" [...] industry-standard protocols such as DNP3 and IEC 61850. However, none of these communication protocols were suited to the requirements of communicating between <b>control</b> <b>centres.</b> To meet these special requirements for communication and co-ordination between <b>control</b> <b>centres</b> the IEC developed the IEC 60870 set of standards.|$|R
50|$|Following the {{privatisation}} of the UK electricity {{industry in}} 1989, {{ownership of the}} property passed to the National Grid Company. It was used to house the Leeds Grid <b>Control</b> <b>Centre</b> for the UK's electricity transmission network from 1958 until its operational closure in 1997. Advances in communications technology (including remote substation operation) during this period reduced the requirement for regional <b>control</b> <b>centres.</b> By {{the time of its}} operational closure in 1997, the entire electricity transmission network in England and Wales could be controlled from a single control room anywhere in the country. Later used as a <b>control</b> <b>centre,</b> it performed as one of the <b>control</b> <b>centres</b> for the Dinorwig hydroelectric storage facility in North Wales.|$|R
50|$|ICCP {{is based}} on client / server principles. Data {{transfers}} result from a request from a <b>control</b> <b>centre</b> (client) to another <b>control</b> <b>centre</b> (server). <b>Control</b> <b>centres</b> may be both clients and servers. ICCP operates at the application layer in the OSI model. As such any physical interfaces, transport and network services that fit this model are supported. TCP/IP over Ethernet (802.3) {{seems to be the}} most common. ICCP may operate over a single point-to-point link between two control centres; however, the more general case is for many <b>control</b> <b>centres</b> and a routed wide area network. The logical connections or “associations” between <b>control</b> <b>centres</b> are completely general. A client may establish associations with more than one server and a client may establish more than one association with the same server. Multiple associations with same server can be established at different levels of quality of service so that high priority real time data is not delayed by lower priority or non real time data transfers.|$|R
