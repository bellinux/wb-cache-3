Meanwhile, the plate-like SAPO- 34 catalysts synthesized by this method exhibited higher selectivity to light olefins and longer lifetime in methanol-to-olefins (MTO) reaction than the traditional cubic SAPO- 34 catalyst.

40|$|Throughout {{the whole}} Valles Marineris, Interior Layered Deposits (ILDs) are present. Their origin is still {{uncertain}} {{although they have}} been known and studied for many decades. Our studies concentrate on ILDs in the eastern Valles Marineris and adjacent chaotic terrains. We analyse their elevation, thickness, layer geometry, stratigraphic position, competence, and mineralogy. Mostly ILDs appear as light-toned layered outcrops but they show various <b>morphologies.</b> <b>Plate-like</b> <b>morphologies</b> which show cap rock material (Aureum, Aram Chaos), mounds with light and dark layering (Gangis Chasma), and flow-like structures embaying mounds of chaotic terrain (Iani Chaos) are observed. Further, ILDs are eroded into yardangs and exhibit heavily fractured and rugged surfaces. Many slopes demonstrate debris fans. The surface looks coarse and massive or fine with appearing cap rock. Few ILDs show a fine-layered lower part changing into a massive upper part. There is no correlation between elevation and morphology or surface structure. ILDs are hardly cratered which may indicate a young erosional age. Using ORION structural analysis software with HRSC DTMs (50 m/px) and corresponding HRSC orthoimages strike and dip measurements are applied on ILDs with distinct layering. In Iani Chaos ILDs show horizontal layering (dip 10 °). The deposits are located at different elevations. The elevation range is from - 6000 up to ~- 800 m and they are always situated below the surrounding plateau rim, in contrast to ILDs in the western Valles Marineris (e. g. Candor, Hebes and Ophir Chasma), which reach or even overlap the canyon rim with elevations from ~ - 5000 up to ~ 3500 m. Sulfates and hematite detected by OMEGA and TES in Aram and Iani Chaos {{as well as in}} Capri Chasma point on aquatic conditions because they form by hydrothermal alteration of volcanic material or evaporation due to decreasing water availability. We consider a possible lacustrine origin for the ILDs, because of their internal layering and their topographic position below the plateau rim. Debris fans and a lack of boulders {{at the base of the}} ILDs may indicate loose to partly consolidate sedimentary rocks.

40|$|Abstract. Small-angle neutron {{scattering}} (SANS) measurements of low concentration, single crystal Nb–D alloys {{have been performed}} to characterize the effect of deformation on deuteride phase formation. The SANS response from the deuteride phase formed at low temperature in the undeformed matrix was consistent with a spherical particle morphology, as expected from {{a large body of}} published TEM studies. In addition, a significant hysteresis was observed (1 T 100) in the SANS response versus temperature from the undeformed sample material. The hysteresis is attributed to the irreversible plastic deformation required to nucleate the incoherent phase. Deformation produced by unidirectional rolling to 50 % thickness reduction altered the deuteride phase transformation characteristics in a fundamental way. The SANS response was highly anisotropic, indicative of an oriented, anisometric particle morphology. Metallographic analysis of deformed specimens electropolished below the solvus temperature confirmed the presence of large deuteride plates with an orientation consistent with the anisotropic SANS response. Deformation also eliminated the temperature hysteresis observed in the undeformed material. A cellular dislocation substructure was found in TEM characterization of the deformed Nb single crystal material. The <b>plate-like</b> particle <b>morphology</b> in the deformed material is attributed to an interaction between the precipitating deuterium and the cellular dislocation substructure. The elimination of the temperature hysteresis is consistent with an interaction between the deuterium and regions of high dislocation density facilitating heterogeneous nucleation. 1...|$|R

40|$|Zeolites are {{crystalline}} aluminosilicates {{that are}} widely used as shape-selective catalysts in the refinery and petrochemical industries. By synthesizing a series of structurally related zeolite catalyst and applying them in the industrially relevant conversion of methanol to hydrocarbons, new and extended understanding {{of the concept of}} shape selectivity has been reached. We have analyzed the relationship between particle morphology and pore system for catalysts having both small- and medium-sized pores using microscopy and diffraction, as well as performing extensive standard characterization. Two instances of preferential exposure of certain crystal facets, favoring access to one pore system over the other, have been found. Zeolites ZSM- 57 (MFS) and SUZ- 4 (SZR) both have both 8 - and 10 -ring channels. MFS prefers a <b>plate-like</b> or nanosheet-type <b>morphology,</b> where the 10 -ring channels are perpendicular to the plates/sheets. This leads to favorable diffusion properties and a pronounced deactivation resistance. For SZR, needle-like crystals with high aspect ratio are preferred. In this instance, the sides of the needles are covered by the 8 -ring pore openings, whereas the 10 -ring pore openings are only exposed at the ends of the needles. This leads to unexpected product selectivity, as the material behaves essentially as an 8 -ring catalyst. We argue that {{it should be possible to}} tune the shape selectivity of zeolite catalysts having pore systems of different dimensions by controlling the crystal morphology...|$|R

40|$|This {{work has}} shown that the kaolin binder that has been used in {{commercial}} Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis catalysts doe not offer any significant attrition resistance. This {{is due in part to}} its <b>morphology</b> (<b>plate-like)</b> and to its particle size being much greater than the primary crystallite size of the iron oxide catalyst. From a microscopic examination of these catalysts, it appears that if the nanoscale attrition of the iron catalyst is to be avoided, the iron must be well dispersed on the binder, and the binder must provide an interlocking microstructure that provides strength and stability to the 30 - 70 {mu}m agglomerates. The study of Fe/SiO{sub 2 } catalysts {{has shown that}} co-precipitation of the iron and silica leads to formation of an amorphous glassy phase which is difficult to reduce even at 723 K. On the other hand, when the iron was precipitated on a preformed silica, 25 - 40 % of the iron could be reduced and carbided. The supported iron catalyst, after reduction, formed 15 - 20 nm iron carbide particles that look very similar to those on the unsupported catalyst. The major difference is these nanometer sized particles are anchored on a support and therefore would not be expected to breakup further and contribute to the fines generated as catalyst attrition proceeds. However, since only a fraction of the silica-supported iron can be reduced to the active carbide phase, our present efforts are devoted to moderating the Fe/SiO{sub 2 } interaction by introducing an interfacial oxide phase. We are also studying the role of added Cu on the ease of reducibility of Fe/SiO{sub 2 }. The implication of this work is that other binder materials should be explored that have a morphology that can strengthen the agglomerates and minimize the Fe-SiO{sub 2 } interfacial reactions.

40|$|Aluminium alloys {{based on}} the aluminium-silicon system are widely used for {{automotive}} and aerospace applications as this industry seeks competitive light materials to replace e. g. cast iron and steel. Al-Si alloys have low density, hence manufactured parts are light weight; they possess good strength and high ductility. The alloys {{can be made from}} higher purity raw materials such as primary aluminium or by recycling of aluminium alloy scrap. In both processing routes undesired impurity elements may enter the alloy along the process chain and eventually will be found downstream in the final Al alloy. Recent estimates predict a decrease of the quality of raw materials used for the electrolytic reduction of Al and an increased use of scrap metal. Consequently, higher levels of some trace elements must be tolerated in future Al-Si based alloys as there currently exist no cost efficient method for removal. This thesis deals with the effect of the trace elements Calcium, Nickel, Phosphorus, Vanadium and Zinc on the solidification and microstructure of hypoeutectic Al-Si foundry alloys. It was found that P is the key element influencing the structure of the Al-Si eutectic. Higher P concentrations promote nucleation of eutectic Si at lower undercoolings resulting in a coarse <b>plate-like</b> Si <b>morphology</b> as opposed to P lean alloys which possess a refined plate-like Si. In addition, the element P represents the link to the alteration of the macroscopic growth mode of the Al-Si eutectic which itself can be applied to describe the differences of Si morphology. Ca can be added to Al-Si alloys in order to induce a reversion of the coarsening of Si crystals in the presence of higher amounts of P. It is concluded that the precipitation of Al 2 Si 2 Ca intermetallics and calcium phosphides removes P {{before the start of the}} eutectic reaction preventing Si nucleation on heterogeneous substrate particles such as AlP. In this case, the structural transformation of the eutectic Si from flakes to fine plates is caused by an increase of the velocity of eutectic solid-liquid interface. A definite flake-to-fibrous transition, in other words chemical modification cannot be achieved with Ca additions. It is emphasized that with respect to the mechanism that is active, there is a distinction between a refined and modified morphology of the Al-Si eutectic. An investigation of solidification path and microstructure of high purity Al-Si alloys shows that Ni partitions into the Al 3 Ni phase which is well distributed in the Al-Si eutectic and forms a close system with eutectic Si crystals. In commercial Al-Si alloys where Fe is inevitably present in concentrations sufficient to form a variety of different intermetallics Ni binds Fe in the Al 9 FeNi phase. The solidification path remains unchanged as the Ni-rich intermetallics precipitate in the eutectic reaction together with Al, Si and other intermetallic phases when 300 ppm Ni or more are added. V and Zn additions in the range of 50 to 600 ppm each have no influence on the solidification sequence of hypoeutectic Al-Si alloys. Zn remains in solid solution in the Al matrix and does not form any intermetallic phase. V tends to partition into known ternary Fe-rich phases.  Traces of V were detected in ß-Al 5 FeSi and α-Al 8 Fe 2 Si phase particles. It was found that in A 356 alloys most of the V was consumed by the formation of the pre-eutectic polyhedral Si 2 V phase when the V concentration was increased to or above 0. 2 wt%.

We examined the mouse mylohyoid muscle at both the transcriptional and protein levels by RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, and Western Blotting. MyHC- 2 b, which is expressed in almost all head and neck muscles and is thought {{to play a role}} in rapid mastication movement, was not detected in the mouse mylohyoid muscle. This result suggests that the mouse mylohyoid muscle has a special function and does not directly function during ingestion.

40|$|Abstract. Al 8 B 4 C 7 {{ceramic powder}} was {{successfully}} synthesized via a gas-solid reaction method using aluminum, boron trioxide and activated carbon {{as the starting}} materials. The effects of synthesis temperature {{and the amount of}} B 2 O 3 addition on synthesis of Al 8 B 4 C 7 were investigated. The results indicated that the optimized process for preparing the Al 8 B 4 C 7 was that the mixtures were heated at 1800 °C for 2 h in flowing argon atmosphere. With the heated temperature increasing, the Al 8 B 4 C 7 content was decreased in the products. And 0. 5 molar excess of B 2 O 3 addition promoted the formation of Al 8 B 4 C 7. The heating samples at 1800 °C had a hexagonal <b>plate-like</b> <b>morphology</b> with ~ 100 µm in size...|$|E
40|$|Zn-doped MgAl-layered double {{hydroxides}} (LDHs) with M 2 +/M 3 + = 2 {{and different}} molar ratios of Mg/Zn have been synthesized by modified homogeneous co-precipitation method and characterized by powder X-ray diffraction, Transmission electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectrum and thermogravimetry, and {{differential thermal analysis}} techniques. The thermal stabilizing effects of different LDHs on PVC were studied by Congo red test and thermal aging test. All of the nanoparticles show <b>plate-like</b> <b>morphology</b> and the average diameter of particles is around 90 nm. Results show that the introduction of Zn increased the average bond length and area of the layers of LDHs, therefore enhanced the adsorption ability on HCl gas which was generated during degradation of PVC to improve the thermal stability of PVC. LDHs with molar ratio of Mg/Zn = 1. 0 shows the best thermal stabilizing effect on PVC...|$|E
40|$|Problem statement: It {{is known}} that layer double {{hydroxide}} {{is one of the}} nano ordered layered compounds and possesses <b>plate-like</b> <b>morphology</b> if carefully crystallized. Approach: In this study, Co-Sn LDH consisting of divalent and tetravalent cations was prepared with new morphology. XRD patterns of the prepared Co-Sn LDH showed that the interlayer spacing of the LDH was 0. 78 nm and SEM image showed nano-needles structure. Results: By intercalation reaction with monocarboxylic acids at room temperature, XRD patterns indicated that the interlayered spacing increased to 3 - 4. 8 nm and formed organic-inorganic nano-hybrid materials. Also, SEM images showed that the nano-needles structure of Co-Sn LDH changes to plate like-structure. Conclusion: Thermal analyses (TG, DTG and DTA) and Infrared spectrum confirmed the intercalation processes of n-capric acid and n-stearic acid inside Co-Sn LDH and the formation of nano-hybrid materials...|$|E
40|$|Calcium {{phosphate}} (CaP) coatings {{on carbon}} fabric substrate were produced by sonoelectrodeposition at different current densities (5, 8, 13, 20 and 34 mA/cm 2). The surface morphology and chemical {{composition of the}} coatings were characterized by SEM, Raman and FTIR spectra. The results showed that at 5 mA/cm 2 current density, the coating exhibits <b>plate-like</b> <b>morphology,</b> indicating an octacalcium phosphate (OCP) phase was pre-formed in the deposits and then converted into hydroxyapatite (HA). When the current density was increased to 8 mA/cm 2 and higher, the coatings exhibited needle-like morphology corresponding to a HA phase. Furthermore, the sonoelectrodeposited CaP coating exhibited denser and more uniform structures with smaller crystal sizes as the current density increased. Cathodic reaction mechanisms of CaP coatings on carbon in the sonoelectrochemical processes are proposed to explain {{the different kinds of}} calcium phosphate obtained...|$|E
