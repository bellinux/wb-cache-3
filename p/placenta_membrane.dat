40|$|Long-term {{engraftment}} and phenotype correction {{has been}} difficult to achieve in humans after in utero stem cell transplantation mainly because of allogeneic rejection. Autologous cells could be obtained during gestation from the amniotic fluid with minimal risk for the fetus and the mother. Using a sheep model, we explored the possibility of using amniotic fluid mesenchymal stem cells (AFMSCs) for autologous in utero stem cell/gene therapy. We collected amniotic fluid (AF) under ultrasound-guided amniocentesis in early gestation pregnant sheep (n = 9, 58 days of gestation, term = 145 days). AFMSCs were isolated and expanded in all sampled fetal sheep. Those cells were transduced using an HIV vector encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) with 63. 2 % (range 38. 3 - 96. 2 %) transduction efficiency rate. After expansion, transduced AFMSCs were injected into the peritoneal cavity of each donor fetal sheep at 76 days under ultrasound guidance. One ewe miscarried twin fetuses after amniocentesis. Intraperitoneal injection was successful in the remaining 7 fetal sheep giving a 78 % survival for the full procedure. Tissues were sampled at postmortem examination 2 weeks later. PCR analysis detected GFP-positive cells in fetal tissues including liver, heart, <b>placenta,</b> <b>membrane,</b> umbilical cord, adrenal gland, and muscle.

40|$|The cancer {{stem cell}} model links {{neoplastic}} cells with normal stem cell biology, but little is known on how normal stem cells are transformed into {{cancer stem cell}}s. Methods: To investigate the processes underlying the transformation of normal stem cells we developed in vitro a cancer stem cell model from human amniotic and chorionic <b>placenta</b> <b>membranes.</b> In this model we studied the expression of specific stem cell molecules by flow cytometry, and genes, by real time RT-PCR. Microscopy immunfluorescence was employed to investigate the proliferative and differentiation patterns. Fluorescence microscopy and FACS were employed to investigate the proliferative and differentiation patterns. To evaluate the tumorigenic potential of our model we injected the cells into NOD. CB 17 -Prkdcscid/NCrHsd mice. Results: Normal human stem cells from amniotic and chorionic <b>placenta</b> <b>membranes</b> were converted into neural cell lineages, under specific conditions, to form secondary neurospheres with a capacity for self-renewal. After extensive in vitro culture, these cells underwent spontaneous transformations and acquired a neuroblastoma (NB) -like phenotype with an elevated proliferative potential that is comparable to established neuroblastoma cell lines. The ability of these cells to transform their phenotype was evidenced by increased clonogenic ability in vitro; by augmented expression level of certain proliferation- and transformation-related genes (e. g., CCNA 2, MYCN, ENPP 2, GRIA 3, and KIT); {{by the presence of}} multinucleated and hyperdiploid cells.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) is {{a member}} of the {{transforming}} growth factor-β superfamily, playing a role in sexual differentiation and recruitment. Since a correlation exists between AMH serum levels in cord blood and fetal sex, the present study aimed to identify mRNA and protein expression of AMH and AMHRII in <b>placenta</b> and fetal <b>membranes</b> according to fetal sex. METHODS: <b>Placenta</b> and fetal <b>membranes</b> samples (n = 40) were collected from women with singleton uncomplicated pregnancies at term. Identification of AMH protein in <b>placenta</b> and fetal <b>membranes</b> was carried out by immunohistochemistry and AMH and AMHRII protein localization by immunofluorescence, while mRNA expression was assessed by quantitative real-time PCR. RESULT: AMH and AMHRII mRNAs were expressed by <b>placenta</b> and fetal <b>membranes</b> at term, without any significant difference between males and females. Placental immunostaining showed a syncytial localization of AMH without sex-related differences; while fetal membranes immunostaining was significantly more intense in male than in female fetuses (p < 0, 01). Immunofluorescence showed an intense co-localization of AMH and AMHRII in <b>placenta</b> and fetal <b>membranes.</b> DISCUSSION: The present study for the first time demonstrated that human <b>placenta</b> and fetal <b>membranes</b> expresses and co-localizes AMH and AMHRII. Although no sex-related difference was found for the mRNA expression both in <b>placenta</b> and fetal <b>membranes,</b> a most intense staining for AMH in male fetal membranes supports AMH as a gender specific hormon...|$|R

Study design: Dystroglycan expression was characterized by Western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and immuno-fluorescence microscopy using human tissues and cultured cells. Results: Both a-DG and b-DG are expressed in the term syncytiotrophoblast, and a-DG is localized to the basement membrane. In first-trimester chorionic villi, a-DG and b-DG are localized to {{the periphery of the}} cytotrophoblast. Expression varies in term fetal membranes. a-Dystroglycan is not detectable in choriocarcinoma cells or HTR cells, but b-DG is present in both normal and cleaved forms. Conclusion: Dystroglycan is expressed at high levels in human trophoblasts, and localization of the a- and b-subunits varies with gestational age and tro-phoblast differentiation.

These {{results indicate that the}} insulin receptor of both liver and placenta has a subunit of molecular weight 135, 000 that binds insulin and that the receptor may be composed of at least two different subunits that are linked together or greatly stabilized by disulfide bonds...|$|R
40|$|The syncytiotrophoblast {{separates}} the maternal and fetal blood and constitutes the primary barrier for maternal-fetal transport. The Maxi-chloride channel from the apical membrane of the syncytiotrophoblast {{plays a role}} in the chloride conductance. Annexins can {{play an important role in}} the regulation of membrane events. In this study we evaluate the role of annexin 6 in the Maxichloride channel properties. The results showed that annexin 6 is bound in the apical <b>placenta</b> <b>membranes</b> in a calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding manner but also in a calcium-independent fashion. The neutralization of annexin 6 decreased the total current by 39 +/- 1. 9 % in the range of +/- 80 mV, and the currents decrease with the time. The single-channel slope conductance was decreased from 253 +/- 7. 4 pS (control) to 105 +/- 13 pS, and the amplitude decreased by 50 %. The open probability was also affected when higher voltage steps were used, changes in either the positive or negative direction induced the channel to close, and the open probability (P-o) did not decrease. In channels with neutralized annexin 6, it was maintained at 1 at +/- 40 mV and at +/- 80 mV. These results suggest that endogenous annexin 6 could regulate the Maxi-chloride channel. The results obtained with normal placentae, in which annexin 6 was neutralized, are similar to those described for the Maxichloride channel isolated from pre-eclamptic placenta. Together these data suggest that annexin 6 could play an important role in ion transport of the placenta...|$|R
40|$|Monoclonal and {{polyclonal}} antibodies {{were raised}} against a <b>placenta</b> plasma <b>membrane</b> protein preparation, which {{was obtained by}} fractionation on Blue B dye matrix and by HPLC-anionexchange, and which was shown to contain fibronectin receptors. Immunochemical and functional evidence showed that monoclonal antibody DH 12 recognized the beta subunit of the human fibronectin receptor on fibroblasts. This monoclonal antibody reacted with two proteins in Western blots and in double immune precipitations of whole cell preparations. Only the higher Mr protein became labeled by surface iodination of intact fibroblasts. The lower Mr protein {{is thought to be}} an intracellular precursor of the beta subunit of the fibronectin receptor. status: publishe...|$|R
