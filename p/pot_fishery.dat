40|$|With {{the growing}} grey seal {{population}} in the Baltic Sea, the inshore cod fishery has suffered dramatic increases in both catch losses and damage to fishing gear. To mitigate this situation, cod pots were evaluated {{as an alternative to}} traditional gillnets and longlines. During a 3 -year study, cod pots were used by commercial fishers in two areas off the coast of Sweden. Using the data from this study, we evaluated catches from pots in relation to other gear types and investigated the effects of environmental and fisheries-related variables such as depth and soak time. The comparison of pots with other gear types showed that, {{during the first half of}} the year, the <b>pot</b> <b>fishery</b> generated lower daily catches than the gillnet and longline fisheries at comparable fishing efforts. During the second half of the year, catches in the <b>pot</b> <b>fishery</b> exceeded or were equal to those in the traditional fisheries. Using generalized additive models to evaluate the impact of environmental and fisheries-related variables on pot catches, we showed that, in both areas, the catch per unit effort (cpue) of legal-sized cod was affected by the water depth, the time of year (months), and the soak time. In one of the areas, cpue was also affected by the direction of the water current in relation to the orientation of the string of pots. The cpue of undersized cod was affected by topographic variables such as the slope and the complexity of the bottom, in addition to the water depth, month of the year, and soak time. The results from the study indicate that pots can be a useful alternative gear in the Baltic cod fishery, at least during part of the year.

In response to this increased fishing pressure, emergency legislation was passed to limit entry, reduce gear, and reduce the harvesting period in the 1999 fishing season. An escapement study was attempted at Sherman Lake, but was unsuccessful due, in part, to poaching and lack of cooperation from harvesters. However, the study did show that escapement into freshwater occurred within a very narrow time period, and that the excluder panel reduced, but did not completely eliminate, bycatch. The upstream passageway/recruitment monitoring project was expanded in 1998, and showed that escapement into freshwater and upstream migration in riverine habitat occurs in short, intense pulses.

40|$|A {{new policy}} {{incorporating}} an operational protocol {{was developed for}} the establishment of new fisheries in South Africa. The common octopus, Octopus vulgaris was used as a candidate species for the project. The operational protocol consisted of a three-phased development framework, namely information gathering (Phase 0), an experimental fishery (Phase 1) and the final implementation of a commercial fishery (Phase 2). The present study focussed on phase 0 of this theoretical framework and protocol and was implemented by using a proposed octopus <b>pot</b> <b>fishery</b> in South Africa as a case study. Phase 0 included a desktop study, information gathering in the field, an economic feasibility study and the formulation of a Fishery Management Plan and experimental design for the fishery. Information gaps identified during the desktop study were addressed during field investigations into the population structure and biology of O. vulgaris along the southeast coast. Immature females were found to use the intertidal area to feed and grow before migrating to the subtidal area to mature and spawn. Mean size differed substantially between intertidal and subtidal areas, with larger octopus found subtidally. Age and growth trials using tetracycline as a marker showed that O. vulgaris deposit daily growth lines in their beaks. A genetic study showed that there is most likely only one panmitic population along the coast. The economic feasibility study indicated that a longline <b>pot</b> <b>fishery</b> could be feasible provided a 30 % catch in 6600 pots/month is attained. Only existing, debt-free vessels should be used in this fishery. The Fishery Management Plan proposed in this study includes management measures such as effort limitation of licences and gear, size restrictions, vessel monitoring systems, and observer programmes. Based on the population dynamics and biology of O. vulgaris it is suggested that a precautionary approach to developing fisheries for this species in both the inter- and subtidal areas along the South African coast. ii CONTENT...|$|E

40|$|The {{paradigm}} that mangroves {{are critical}} for sustaining production in coastal fisheries is widely accepted, but empirical evidence has been tenuous. This study showed that links between mangrove extent and coastal fisheries production could be detected for some species at a broad regional scale (1000 s of kilometres) {{on the east coast}} of Queensland, Australia. The relationships between catch-per-unit-effort for different commercially caught species in four fisheries (trawl, line, net and <b>pot</b> <b>fisheries)</b> and mangrove characteristics, estimated from Landsat images were examined using multiple regression analyses. The species were categorised into three groups based on information on their life history characteristics, namely mangrove-related species (banana prawns Penaeus merguiensis, mud crabs Scylla serrata and barramundi Lates calcarifer), estuarine species (tiger prawns Penaeus esculentus and Penaeus semisulcatus, blue swimmer crabs Portunus pelagicus and blue threadfin Eleutheronema tetradactylum) and offshore species (coral trout Plectropomus spp.). For the mangrove-related species, mangrove characteristics such as area and perimeter accounted for most of the variation in the model; for the non-mangrove estuarine species, latitude was the dominant parameter but some mangrove characteristics (e. g. mangrove perimeter) also made significant contributions to the models. In contrast, for the offshore species, latitude was the dominant variable, with no contribution from mangrove characteristics. This study also identified that finer scale spatial data for the fisheries, to enable catch information to be attributed to a particular catchment, would help to improve our understanding of relationships between mangroves and fisheries production.

Two sets of traps (n= 30) consisting of 3 PVC tubes within cement blocks were set-up on two different substrates; soft sediment (Pedro Miguel) and rocky-sand (Pasteleiro) at depth varying between 10 and 30 metres. From June to August 2006, 11 hauls per site were performed. A total of 191 octopuses (from 1. 1 to 989 g; average = 135. 3 g) were captured. Catches in the soft sediment site were significantly higher than in the other location (CPUE: mean ± SD: 0. 33 ± 0. 17 vs. 0. 15 ± 0. 17 octopus trap- 1 hour- 1 * 100). The catch was initially dominated by octopus of 300 - 400 g but as fishing continued, this size classes disappeared and was replaced by smaller individuals. As a result, half of the catch at both sites (51. 8 %) was composed of specimens with a weight equal or inferior to 50 grams. The occurrence of summer recruitment event combined with a natural displacement of larger individuals into deeper waters is most probably responsible for this pattern. Our results showed that in shallow water and during this period of the year, individuals inferior to 50 grams are far more abundant than larger octopuses and should be the target size class for ongrowing activities...|$|R

We {{examined the relationship between}} catch-per-unit-effort for commercially caught species and the spatial patterning of mapped benthic habitat types along the coast of Queensland, Australia in their dominant fisheries (trawl, line, net or <b>pot</b> <b>fisheries).</b> We quantified the composition and spatial configuration of seascapes and calculated coastline length, number of estuaries, river length and geographical latitude using 12 metrics within ninety 30 -nautical-mile grid cells, which supported inshore fish catch data from 21 species groups. Multiple regression analysis and non-metric multidimensional scaling plots indicated that ecological linkages may exist between geomorphic coastal features and nearshore fisheries production for a number of species groups. Connectivity indices for mangroves, salt marsh and channels explained the largest proportion (30 – 70 %), suggesting the importance of connected tidal wetlands for fisheries. Barramundi (Lates calcarifer) catch-per-unit-effort was best explained by the number of wetland patches, mangrove connectivity and wetland connectivity (r 2 = 0. 38, n = 28). Catch-per-unit-effort for the Gulf of Carpentaria was highly correlated with wetland connectivity, the number of estuaries and seagrass patch density (r = 0. 57, n = 29). The findings could guide the spatial design of marine protected area networks to maintain ecosystem services and avoid potential disruption to connectivity caused by habitat removal or modification. Application of the same approach to analyses of finer spatial scales would enable catch information to be related to particular estuarine habitats and provide better understanding of the importance of habitat connectivity for fisheries...|$|R

Fishers draw on social relationships to acquire information relating to fishing opportunities, contributing to knowledge that underpins decision making and behavior. In this study we use quantitative social network analysis (SNA) to compare the structure of information-sharing networks and explore links between information flow and fishing success at four ports in the Northumberland (UK) <b>potting</b> <b>fishery.</b> In our results we describe the different information-sharing networks existing at each port, and show the following: {{a high proportion of}} fishers reported sharing information, though fewer than a third of reported ties were reciprocated; subgroups existed in which greater information sharing occurred; and networks displayed varying levels of cohesiveness. Fishers commonly shared information with others whom they perceived to be successful, and reciprocal relationships were more common among fishers of similar success. Furthermore, fishers more central in networks had more sources of incoming information through social relationships, shared information with fewer peers, and were more successful than those who were less central.

Although information-sharing networks may contribute to fishing success, i. e., high lobster landings, these outcomes may not be compatible with long-term fisheries management objectives. Nevertheless, understanding the social dynamics of information sharing can help inform management strategies by identifying central fishers in information-sharing networks, who have access to a range of information on others' fishing behavior.

A recent policy on developing fisheries in South Africa emphasizes the importance of investigating the economic feasibility of a fishery as part of its management framework. The study reported here generated baseline information necessary {{in the design of the}} experimental fishery, giving guidelines as to which vessels, fishing gear and markets would be most feasible. The proposed fishery, gear and vessel type, fishing techniques and expected catch rates are described, the results of market research are outlined, and the cost of fishing is estimated. The potential business should consist of small and medium-sized vessels deploying unbaited pots attached to long lines. The longline <b>pot</b> <b>fishery</b> could be economically feasible, provided a 30 percent catch in 6600 pots/month is attained. Only existing, debt-free vessels should be used. The minimum catch per unit effort (CPUE) for various fishing operation scenarios was calculated to determine economic feasibility. This is an estimated minimum CPUE, based on assumptions that cannot be confirmed until the fishery starts. Furthermore, this economic analysis also needs to be assessed by stakeholders with experience of fishery operationsRhodes Centenary issue of: South African Journal of Science...|$|E
40|$|The ASPM {{assessment}} of the Prince Edward Islands toothfish resource by Brandão and Butterworth (2004) that permitted annual fluctuations about a deterministic stockrecruitment relationship is updated {{to take account of}} further catch, GLM standardised CPUE and catch-at-length information that has become available for the years 2004 and 2005. The assessment is also generalised to allow for a second fleet to accommodate data from a <b>pot</b> <b>fishery</b> that has been in operation since November 2004. Results obtained show a much greater selectivity for larger toothfish for the pot than for the longline fishery – a feature which has important implications for the status of the population. The possible extent of cetacean predation and its consequences are also investigated. Twenty year biomass projections under the assumption of various constant annual catches for the two-fleet model are computed. Although higher sustainable yields may be possible, it is suggested that a prudent management approach at this stage would be for the annual legal catch not to exceed 500 tonnes for the time being, together with encouragement that this be taken more by pots than by longline to reduce the impact of cetacean predation. Industry observations of the extent of cetacean predation for the longline fishery have proved helpful, and should be extended to a more formal data recording basis in the future...|$|E
40|$|In the Gulf of Maine, the {{entanglement}} of humpback {{whales in}} fishing gear {{is a substantial}} source of human-caused mortality. The current mortality and serious injury of humpback whales in the Gulf of Maine is twice the Potential Biological Removal (PBR) level set for this population. Researchers and managers are challenged to reduce entanglement to below PBR without extensive information on many important factors. The goal {{of this study was}} to describe entanglement injuries and investigate whether different fishing gear types, particularly pot and net fisheries, resulted in distinctive entanglement patterns of humpback whales from the Gulf of Maine. I searched the Center for Coastal Studies' entanglement database for whales that fit the following criteria: the entanglement occurred between 1995 and 2002, the whale was photographed during the disentanglement, and the gear type or line type of the entangling gear was known. Sixteen cases were identified that fit the criteria. Three cases involved entanglements in <b>pot</b> <b>fishery</b> gear, four in net gear, and nine cases with known line type. I qualitatively analyzed photographs from these sixteen cases to describe the injuries and to investigate whether any entanglement patterns could be determined based on gear type in terms of location of entanglement on whale, presence of trailing gear, presence of buoys or high flyers, free swimming versus anchored in gear, disentanglement success, or type of injury. I was unable to find a relationship between entangling gear type and any of the factors assessed. I discuss potential reasons for the finding of no relationship as well as considerations for future research in this area...|$|E
40|$|Chapter 3 {{has been}} {{published}} as: Gall, S. C. & Rodwell, L. D. (2016). Evaluating the social acceptability of Marine Protected Areas. Marine Policy, 65, 30 - 38 Historically, the governance streams of fisheries and conservation management have run separately to one another, with little attempt at integration despite their similar goals. Efforts to integrate the two have increased {{as a result of}} their similarities and the potential benefits that may arise, but a requirement for additional research was identified to determine the effectiveness of this approach. This thesis therefore took an interdisciplinary approach, seeking to combine knowledge and methods from ecological, social and economic disciplines to provide a holistic evaluation of the potential for success. Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) were chosen as a management tool to evaluate for this purpose. Ecological research used underwater video methods to show that potting may be compatible with the conservation objectives of a multi-use MPA, but that this will depend on the level of impact and what is deemed ‘acceptable’ by regulators. An evaluation of social acceptance of MPAs using Q methodology stressed the importance of stakeholder engagement and transparency in decision making. Stakeholder acceptance can be facilitated by provision of clear evidence of the need for management, and of the benefits it may bring. Economic research evaluated the potential economic benefits of multi-use MPAs through quantification of change in quantity and value of landings for <b>potting</b> <b>fisheries</b> finding landings increased following MPA implementation. Finally, the thesis considered the effectiveness of ecosystem based fisheries management using a questionnaire designed to gather the opinions of stakeholders. This highlighted the potential role of co-management and the value of the ecosystem approach and emphasised the need for responsive, adaptive management which considers all stakeholders and all three disciplines. Overall the thesis highlighted the strength of taking an interdisciplinary approach, finding that whilst there is evidence for successful integration seen through designation of well managed multi-use MPAs, success may be limited by fundamental differences in the goals of the two streams. Further success may be facilitated by increased evidence for the benefits of integration for both governance streams, and provision of adequate resources to ensure management measures are reactive and adaptive.

40|$|Interaction between {{seals and}} {{fisheries}} along the Swedish coast has serious {{environmental and economic}} consequences. This thesis describes the conflict as it affects four different small-scale coastal fisheries; the eel fisheries on the west coast, the herring fisheries and salmon fisheries in the northern Baltic and the cod fisheries in the central Baltic. Knowledge gained through studies {{of the interaction between}} seals and fisheries has been instrumental for the development of alternative seal-safe fishing gear and mitigation methods. For some fisheries the improved understanding has led to a resolution of certain parts of the conflict. Certain coastal fisheries in the Baltic, such as the herring gillnet fishery, are at the point of collapse because of this conflict. Damage caused by grey seals to this fishery {{has been shown to be}} much more extensive than previously recognised. When seals raid nets, a significant part of the catch is lost without trace. Seals remove fish from nets without leaving any remains. This represents a hidden loss. Another hidden loss is caused by the presence of seals around fishing gear, which scares away fish from the area. The result is often a total loss of catch. Hidden losses are also evident in the gillnet fishery for cod in the central Baltic sea. In recent years damage by seals in the cod gillnet fishery has increased significantly. Due to the high value of cod the cod fishery is currently one of the fisheries that suffer the highest economic loss by seal damage. Seal-safe fishing gear is at present the only long lasting solution which would meet the needs of both seals and fishermen. Mitigation of damage to catch and fishing gear as well as the prevention of accidental by-catch are two sides of the same problem; a solution to one is also a solution to the other. However, development of new fishing gear is challenging and time-consuming. It requires better knowledge of both fish and seal behaviour. At present suitable alternative fishing gear is not available for the herring fisheries carried out through the whole season. However, a herring trap has been developed as an alternative fishing gear for catching spawning herring in spring time. In the cod gillnet fishery, promising results have been achieved in trials of an alternative fishing gear - the two-chamber <b>pot.</b> Another coastal <b>fishery</b> in the Baltic subjected to damage by grey seals, is the salmon trap net fishery in the North Baltic. A seal-safe salmon trap has been developed and is used by most of the salmon fishermen. This so called pontoon trap prevents the seal from reaching the catch by keeping the fish in an enclosed seal-safe fish chamber. However, in recent years there have been reports of damage by seals also in the pontoon trap. By filming the seals attacking traps it has been possible to identify 10 individual seals hunting in the traps and to determine that these same animals returned to the traps over a long period of time. It is possible therefore, to limit or decrease damage to the fisheries by limiting access for or by culling the individual seals specialized in raiding fishing gear. On the west coast of Sweden the eel fyke net fishery suffers from damage by harbour seals. In order to find a lasting solution to the conflict, seal behaviour has been studied as well as the fyke nets' fishing efficiency. The issue of whether it is the eels or the by-caught species which motivate harbour seals to attack fyke nets was studied. It was shown that harbour seals raiding fyke nets have a preference for eel. Certain harbour seals that specialise in foraging at fyke nets, have developed different feeding preferences compared to those of most seals. Seal-safe fyke nets, which resisted attacks while still being efficient in terms of yield, have been developed. They are already in use in commercial fishery along the west coast...|$|R
40|$|A {{pilot study}} on the {{characteristics}} of crab pot buoy line movements to assess bottlenose dolphin entanglement was conducted from 19 September to 30 September 2005 in the Charleston Harbor, Charleston, South Carolina. The objectives of this study were to determine: 1) the movements of the buoy line in the water at various tidal stages, current strengths, lengths of line, and water depth, 2) if lead-core rope was a better alternative to nylon rope, 3) and if the manner of deployment of the gear affected the suspension of the line in the water and on the bottom. Diamond braided nylon (# 10) rope of varying length (20 ft. – 80 ft.) were used during 31 trials and stiffened (polypropylene lead-core) rope was used in four trials. Observations of the buoy line movements were captured with an Atlantis underwater camera attached to a Digital DPC- 1000 video recorder. Results from this study showed that: 1) the method used for deployment was important in keeping the buoy line from arcing or coiling, 2) little to no arcing occurred in water current velocities of > 0. 20 m/s, 3) rope lengths of ≥ 50 ft. deployed in < 10 ft. of water produced waving in the water column and arcing on the bottom, 4) slack tide was a period of increased risk of entanglement for bottlenose dolphins, and 5) poly lead-core rope was not a good alternative to nylon rope unless in deep water with strong water current velocities. This pilot study produced questions {{that can be used for}} future studies {{on the characteristics of}} buoy line movements in the crab <b>pot</b> <b>fishery</b> as it relates to bottlenose dolphin entanglements...|$|E
