5|$|In {{those who}} have had stones, <b>prevention</b> <b>is</b> by {{drinking}} fluids such that more than two liters of urine are produced per day. If this is not effective enough, thiazide diuretic, citrate, or allopurinol may be taken. It is recommended that soft drinks containing phosphoric acid (typically colas) be avoided.|$|E
5|$|One {{suggested}} {{method of}} <b>prevention</b> <b>is</b> to make paracetamol a prescription-only medicine, or {{to remove it}} entirely from the market. However, overdose is a relatively minor problem; for example, 0.08% of the UK population (over 50 thousand people) present with paracetamol overdose each year. In contrast, paracetamol is a safe and effective medication that is taken without complications by millions of people. In addition, alternative pain relief medications such as aspirin are more toxic in overdose, whereas non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are associated with more adverse effects following normal use.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the thesis was to explore the issues {{surrounding}} the cost and implementation of prevention. Specifically, methods for determining cost-effectiveness and measuring the health benefits conferred from <b>prevention</b> <b>were</b> explored and services that have been determined to be cost-effective were discussed. Through interviews with health care professionals, administrators, and public health professors, perceptions of the benefits and costs of <b>prevention</b> <b>were</b> explored. Barriers {{to the implementation of}} <b>prevention</b> <b>were</b> discussed. The thesis concludes with suggestions on steps that health care providers and policy-makers can take to improve the health of the U. S. population through prevention...|$|R

5|$|<b>Prevention</b> <b>is</b> by washing {{hands and}} not sharing eating utensils. There is no vaccine for the disease. Treatment with {{antibiotics}} is only recommended {{in those with}} a confirmed diagnosis. Those infected should stay away from other people for at least 24 hours after starting treatment. Pain can be treated with paracetamol (acetaminophen) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) such as ibuprofen.|$|E
5|$|Falls can {{be avoided}} by {{installing}} grab bars in bathrooms and handrails on stairways; removing tripping hazards such as throw rugs; or installing window guards and safety gates {{at the top and}} bottom of stairs around young children. Playgrounds with shock-absorbing surfaces such as mulch or sand also prevent head injuries. Child abuse <b>prevention</b> <b>is</b> another tactic; programs exist to prevent shaken baby syndrome by educating about the dangers of shaking children. Gun safety, including keeping guns unloaded and locked, is another preventative measure. Studies on the effect of laws that aim to control access to guns in the United States have been insufficient to determine their effectiveness preventing number of deaths or injuries.|$|E
5|$|Various beetles in the Bostrichoidea {{superfamily}} {{attack the}} dry, seasoned wood used as structural timber in houses {{and to make}} furniture. In most cases, it is the larvae that do the damage; these are invisible from {{the outside of the}} timber, but are chewing away at the wood in the interior of the item. Examples of these are the powderpost beetles, which attack the sapwood of hardwoods, and the furniture beetles, which attacks softwoods, including plywood. The damage has already been done by the time the adult beetles bore their way out, leaving neat round holes behind them. The first that a householder knows about the beetle damage is often when a chair leg breaks off or a piece of structural timber caves in. <b>Prevention</b> <b>is</b> through chemical treatment of the timber prior to its use in construction or in furniture manufacture.|$|E

40|$|Maintenance and <b>prevention</b> <b>are</b> {{important}} {{concepts in}} the science of intelligent systems, yet they are usually ignored in favor of concepts related to achievement. We show, however, that maintenance and <b>prevention</b> <b>are</b> neither trivial nor intractable to formalize or compute and, given their value, merit serious research attention. Maintenance and <b>prevention</b> <b>are</b> duals of each other, but cannot be reduced to other known concepts. We formalize maintenance in a general model of actions and time, giving its model theory and axiomatization. We next introduce techniques from theoretical computer science by giving a fixpoint characterization of maintenance. That characterization yields an efficient algorithm for computing maintenance. Variants of this algorithm apply to achievement-like concepts as well. When applicable, it appears superior to traditional planning approaches...|$|R

25|$|Given {{the disease}} burden of strokes, <b>prevention</b> <b>is</b> an {{important}} public health concern. Primary <b>prevention</b> <b>is</b> less effective than secondary prevention (as {{judged by the}} number needed to treat to prevent one stroke per year). Recent guidelines detail the evidence for primary prevention in stroke. In those who are otherwise healthy, aspirin does not appear beneficial and thus is not recommended. In {{people who have had}} a myocardial infarction or those with a high cardiovascular risk, it provides some protection against a first stroke. In those who have previously had a stroke, treatment with medications such as aspirin, clopidogrel, and dipyridamole may be beneficial. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends against screening for carotid artery stenosis in those without symptoms.|$|E
