2500|$|Although rarely {{listed as}} an element, {{the common law}} {{required}} that [...] "entry occur {{as a consequence of}} the breaking". For example, if a wrongdoer partially opens a window with a pry bar—but then notices an open door, which he uses to enter the dwelling, there is no burglary under common law. The use of the pry bar would not constitute an entry even if a portion of the <b>prybar</b> [...] "entered" [...] the residence. Under the instrumentality rule the use of an instrument to effect a breaking would not constitute an entry. However, if any part of the perpetrator's body entered the residence in an attempt to gain entry, the instrumentality rule did not apply. Thus, if the perpetrator uses the <b>prybar</b> to pry open the window and then used his hands to lift the partially opened window, an [...] "entry" [...] would have taken place when he grasped the bottom of the window with his hands.|$|E
50|$|Dextre was put {{together}} today during the second spacewalk of STS-123. Mission Specialists Richard Linnehan and Mike Foreman completed their 7-hour, 8-minute orbital stroll Sunday at 06:57 UTC. The spacewalkers encountered some difficulty removing two bolts that secured the robot arm during transport, and {{had to resort to}} using a <b>prybar</b> to remove them.|$|E

50|$|These include: tape measures, sockets, ratchets, wrenches, squeeze tools (pliers, visegrips), screwdrivers, hammers, <b>prybars,</b> axes, handsaws, chisels, staple guns, hand sanders, gear wrenches, levels, chalk line, etc.|$|R
50|$|Vaughan & Bushnell Manufacturing, {{also known}} as Vaughan Manufacturing and branded as simply Vaughan, is an American {{manufacturing}} company that specializes {{in the production of}} hammers, axes, <b>prybars,</b> and hand saws. The company produces more than 250 different kinds of hammers.|$|R
50|$|The mounts {{could be}} {{constructed}} as either full, 3/4 or half circles of steel rail {{set in concrete}} with a diameter of approximately 36 ft. A concrete column with a diameter of ten feet (3 m) was constructed {{in the center of}} the circle to support the gun and carriage. The concrete column was connected to the outer concrete ring by concrete beams for alignment/stability. Originally traverse was accomplished with several men and <b>prybars</b> to move the trailing arms around the steel ring. Later installations included a geared steel ring just inside of the outer steel rail for improved traverse. The Canon de 155mm GPF, designated 155 mm gun M1917 (French-made) or M1918 (US-made) in U.S. service, was often married with Panama mounts; these were the primary weapons of the United States Army Coast Artillery Corps' tractor-drawn units 1920-1945.|$|R
5000|$|The {{tomahawk}} {{has gained}} some respect {{by members of}} various law enforcement tactical (i.e. [...] "SWAT") teams. Some companies have seized upon this new popularity and are producing [...] "tactical tomahawks." [...] These SWAT-oriented tools {{are designed to be}} both useful and relatively light. Some examples of [...] "tactical tomahawks" [...] include models wherein the shaft is designed as a <b>prybar.</b> There are models with line/rope cutting notches, cuts in the head allowing its use as a wrench, and models with broad, heavy heads to assist in breaching doors.|$|E
50|$|Lug nuts may {{be removed}} using a lug, socket or impact wrench. If the wheel {{is to be}} removed then an {{automotive}} jack to raise the vehicle and some wheel chocks would be used as well. Wheels that have hubcaps or hub covers need these removed beforehand, typically with a screwdriver, flatbar, or <b>prybar.</b> Lug nuts {{can be difficult to}} remove, as they may become frozen to the wheel stud. In such cases a breaker bar or repeated blows from an impact wrench can be used to free them. Alternating between tightening and loosening can free especially stubborn lug nuts.|$|E
5000|$|The Mark 3 {{features}} a 6" [...] 440 stainless steel blade. It has a saw tooth {{back and a}} black oxide finish, with high impact plastic handle and sheath. The original had a steep counter curved point which the Navy requested be reinforced because of damage {{to the tip of}} the blade when prying. The have since reinforced the tip eliminating the reverse curve making the point more sturdy. People have found many uses for this knife, including using the butt as a hammer and the blade as a <b>prybar</b> which may cause personal harm. The blade is said to hold a great edge and be very durable.|$|E
5000|$|Crash axe A short {{lightweight}} handheld emergency chopping tool {{with a sharp}} or serrated blade spanning {{a quarter}} circular from the axis of the handle, sometimes with a notch in the blade to catch on sheet metal, and often a short pick opposite the blade, this tool or a <b>prybar</b> is required to be carried in most large aircraft cockpits with 20 seats or more to quickly chop and pry walls and cabinets to gain access when extinguishing a fire while in flight or to escape when exits are unavailable. A crash axe is sometimes also used by crash rescue firefighter crews to chop through the airplane's sheet metal skin for a rescue opening; modern crash axes are often made with an electrically insulated handle.|$|E
5000|$|A crowbar, {{also called}} a {{wrecking}} bar, pry bar or <b>prybar,</b> pinch-bar, or occasionally a prise bar or prisebar, and more informally or known to non-American {{nations such as}} Britain and Australia as a jimmy (also called jimmy bar or jemmy), gooseneck, or pig foot, is a tool consisting of a metal bar with a single curved end and flattened points, often with a small fissure on one or both ends for removing nails. In Britain, Ireland, New Zealand, and Australia, due {{to the influence of}} American media [...] "crowbar" [...] may occasionally be used loosely for this tool, but it is still mainly used to mean a larger straighter tool, its original English meaning (see digging bar). The term jammy or jimmy most often refers to the tool when used for burglary.|$|E
40|$|Selectins are {{adhesion}} {{molecules that}} resist large tensile forces applied by hydrodynamic forces to leukocytes binding to vessel walls. In crystals, the liganded (high-affinity) and unliganded (low-affinity) conformations differ in orientation between their tandem lectin and EGF domains. I examine how tensile force exerted on a selectin–ligand complex in vivo could favor the more extended, high-affinity conformation. Allostery {{is transmitted from}} the EGF–lectin domain interface to the ligand-binding interface on the lectin domain, 30 Å away. Trp- 1 of the lectin domain and the long axis of the EGF domain form an L-shaped <b>prybar</b> that is welded together by hydrogen bonds to the Trp- 1 α-amino group. Pivoting of the <b>prybar</b> induced by force demolishes an interface between the Trp- 1 side chain and the lectin domain at a switch 1 region. These changes are transmitted by rigid body movement of the switch 2 region to rearrangements in the switch 3 region at the ligand binding site. Another switch region corresponds to a single residue in the EGF domain with large effects on ligand binding and rolling adhesion. Allostery in selectins, and the alignment of tensile force on a selectin–ligand complex with the transition pathway for conformational change, explain much of the structural basis for selectin mechanochemistry...|$|E
