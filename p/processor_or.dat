25|$|Distribution sort {{refers to}} any sorting {{algorithm}} where data are distributed from their input to multiple intermediate structures {{which are then}} gathered and placed on the output. For example, both bucket sort and flashsort are distribution based sorting algorithms.

This allows external sorting of data too large to fit into a single computer's memory.|$|E

2500|$|OLE allows an editing {{application}} to export {{part of a}} document to another editing application and then import it with additional content. For example, a desktop publishing system might send some text to a word <b>processor</b> <b>or</b> a picture to a bitmap editor using OLE. The main benefit of OLE is to add different kinds of data to a document from different applications, like a text editor and an image editor. This creates a Compound File Binary Format document and a master file to which the document makes reference. Changes to data in the master file immediately affect the document that references it. This is called [...] "linking" [...] (instead of [...] "embedding").|$|E
2500|$|Early {{computing}} machines had fixed programs. For example, a desk calculator is a fixed program computer. [...] It can do basic mathematics, but it {{cannot be}} used as a word <b>processor</b> <b>or</b> a gaming console. [...] Changing the program of a fixed-program machine requires re-wiring, re-structuring, or re-designing the machine. [...] The earliest computers were not so much [...] "programmed" [...] as they were [...] "designed". [...] "Reprogramming", when it was possible at all, was a laborious process, starting with flowcharts and paper notes, followed by detailed engineering designs, and then the often-arduous process of physically re-wiring and re-building the machine. With the proposal of the stored-program computer this changed. A stored-program computer includes by design an instruction set and can store in memory a set of instructions (a program) that details the computation.|$|E
2500|$|According to {{spokesman}} Bill Calder, Intel {{has maintained}} only the Celeron brand, the Atom brand for netbooks and the vPro lineup for businesses. Since late 2009, Intel's mainstream processors {{have been called}} Celeron, Pentium, Core i3, Core i5, and Core i7, in order of performance from lowest to highest. The first generation core products carry a 3 digit name, such as i5 750, and the second generation products carry a 4 digit name, such as the i5 2500. In both cases, a K {{at the end of}} it shows that it is an unlocked processor, enabling additional overclocking abilities (for instance, 2500K). vPro products will carry the Intel Core i7 vPro <b>processor</b> <b>or</b> the Intel Core i5 vPro processor name. In October 2011, Intel started to sell its Core i7-2700K [...] "Sandy Bridge" [...] chip to customers worldwide.|$|E

2500|$|In 2011, JEDEC {{published}} the Wide I/O 2 standard; it stacks multiple memory dies, {{but does that}} directly {{on top of the}} CPU and in the same package. This memory layout provides higher bandwidth and better power performance than DDR4 SDRAM, and allows a wide interface with short signal lengths. It primarily aims to replace various mobile DDRX SDRAM standards used in high-performance embedded and mobile devices, such as smartphones. [...] Hynix proposed similar High Bandwidth Memory (HBM), which was published as JEDEC JESD235. [...] Both Wide I/O 2 and HBM use a very wide parallel memory interface, up to 512 bits wide for Wide I/O 2 (compared to 64 bits for DDR4), running at a lower frequency than DDR4. Wide I/O 2 is targeted at high-performance compact devices such as smartphones, where it will be integrated into the <b>processor</b> <b>or</b> system on a chip (SoC) packages. HBM is targeted at graphics memory and general computing, while HMC targets high-end servers and enterprise applications.|$|E
2500|$|The Dan Sandin Image <b>Processor,</b> <b>or</b> [...] "IP," [...] is {{an analog}} video {{processor}} with video signals sent through processing modules that route to an output color encoder. The IP's most unique attribute is its non-commercial philosophy, emphasizing a {{public access to}} processing methods and the machines that assist in generating the images. The IP was Sandin's electronic expression for a culture that would [...] "learn to use High-Tech machines for personal, aesthetic, religious, intuitive, comprehensive, and exploratory growth." [...] This educational goal was supplemented with a [...] "distribution religion" [...] that enabled video artists, and not-for-profit groups, to [...] "roll-your-own" [...] video synthesizer for only the cost of parts and the sweat and labor it took to build it. It was the [...] "Heathkit" [...] of video art tools, with a full building plan spelled out, including electronic schematics and mechanical assembly information. Tips on soldering, procuring electronic parts and Printed Circuit boards, were {{also included in the}} documentation, increasing the chances of successfully building a working version of the video synthesizer.|$|E
2500|$|Intel Active Management Technology, part of Intel vPro, {{implements}} out-of-band management, giving administrators remote administration, remote management, {{and remote}} control of PCs with no {{involvement of the}} host <b>processor</b> <b>or</b> BIOS, even when the system is powered off. Remote administration includes remote power-up and power-down, remote reset, redirected boot, console redirection, pre-boot access to BIOS settings, programmable filtering for inbound and outbound network traffic, agent presence checking, out-of-band policy-based alerting, access to system information, such as hardware asset information, persistent event logs, and other information that is stored in dedicated memory (not on the hard drive) where it is accessible even if the OS is down or the PC is powered off. Some of these functions require the deepest level of rootkit, a second non-removable spy computer built around the main computer. Sandy Bridge and future chipsets have [...] "the ability to remotely kill and restore a lost or stolen PC via 3G". Hardware rootkits built into the chipset can help recover stolen computers, remove data, or render them useless, but they also present privacy and security concerns of undetectable spying and redirection by management or hackers who might gain control.|$|E

2500|$|The {{first version}} of the game was {{released}} for the BBC Micro, model B on tape and disk and [...] "about {{a month or two}} later" [...] the Acorn Electron tape version was released. [...] The Electron's limitations meant several game features were cut including Thargoids and suns. Neither the BBC nor the Electron tape versions featured missions. [...] Additionally, the original tape version for the Electron contained a bug that stopped Galactic Hyperspace from working. Acorn provided a mail-in tape-replacement service to upgrade to v1.1 (marked as such on the tape label) that fixed this bug. The BBC B disk version, referred to as Classic Elite, would load a new set of ships after every hyperspace jump or space station launch, meaning a larger number of ships were available. A new disk version released by Superior Software in 1986 was enhanced {{to take advantage of the}} BBC Micro Model B's successors including the BBC Micro Model B+, Master 128 computers, the optional 6502 Second <b>Processor</b> <b>or</b> sideways RAM, if they were fitted.
