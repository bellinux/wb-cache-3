40|$|Steelhead and {{rainbow trout}} are common names for marine-migratory (anadromous) and freshwater-resident forms of Oncorhynchus mykiss, a {{partially}} migratory salmonid fish. Anadromous and resident forms are sympatric and can produce offspring {{with a life}} history different from their own (i. e., steelhead parents can produce rainbow trout offspring and vice versa). The expression of these alternative life histories is a plastic response to individual patterns of energy acquisition, assimilation, and allocation during juvenile life stages. Individual performance during early stream life {{is of particular interest}} because of <b>potential</b> <b>carry-over</b> effects on subsequent growth and developmental trajectories. In a series of experiments in laboratory streams, I determined the influence of individual variation in energy metabolism on behavior, growth, and life-history expression in O. mykiss. Individual variation in energy metabolism was a strong predictor of feeding territory acquisition by juvenile fish during the transition from dependence on maternal provisioning of egg yolk reserves to independent feeding.

40|$|Background To {{enhance the}} non-technical skills (NTS) {{assessment}} literature {{by developing a}} reliable and valid peer and self-assessment tool for NTS in a simulated ward setting to include emotional reactions: the Temporal Rating of Emergency Non-Technical skills (TRENT) Index. The paper aims to document (1) {{the psychometric properties of}} the TRENT index (e. g., reliability, idiosyncrasy biases) and (2) its validity in terms of performance-emotional associations in the high fidelity simulated ward environment. Methods Two samples of doctors (Ns = 150 & 90) taking part in emergency simulations provided both self and peer-assessment of NTS, with the second sample also providing self-assessments of mood. The psychometric properties of the TRENT were explored for self- and peer-assessment, and pre- and post-simulation environment mood was used to assess validity. Results A psychometrically reliable and valid 5 -factor assessment of NTS was developed. While there was evidence for both intra-rater and inter-rater reliability, inter-rater idiosyncrasy was also observed. Self-rated, but not peer-rated, negative performance was positively associated with post simulation negative mood. Conclusion These are the first results that pertain to inter-, intra-rater reliability as well as idiosyncratic biases in NTS assessment and the first to show that simulator performance can influence mood after assessment. <b>Potential</b> clinical <b>carry-over</b> effects of mood are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Keywords: {{food intake}} rate; giving-up density; habitat switch; parental costs; social {{dominance}} After reproducing successfully, birds with extended parental care form family groups. Despite being the dominant social unit, such family {{groups have been}} reported to switch to alternative habitat earlier than adults without offspring, with <b>potential</b> negative <b>carry-over</b> effects for the next breeding season. Here we test a proposed mechanism for this earlier habitat switch, namely a low foraging efficiency in juveniles. Such a test is best performed under controlled conditions because in the field families may occupy food patches of a different quality than singles or pairs without young. We studied this mechanism in Bewick's Swans Cygnus columbianus bewickii, which trample (or ‘treadle’) for food buried in the sediment. The gross intake rate of juveniles was as low as 60 % of that of adults, depending on the burial depth of the food. Trampling effort did not differ between age classes, but differences in intake rate were related to body size, suggesting that larger or heavier birds were trampling more efficiently. Corresponding giving-up densities in the field were calculated to be c. 60 % higher for juveniles than for adults. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the lower foraging efficiency of juveniles may be responsible for the segregation of family groups from adults without offspring. ...|$|R

Various diagnostic markers for helminth parasites of cattle from different age groups were assessed monthly from April 2007 to March 2008. First season grazing stock were subjected to significant challenge from Ostertagia ostertagi nematodes as reflected in serum pepsinogen concentrations, which rose markedly {{in the second half of}} the grazing season. In addition, plasma albumin concentrations decreased and faecal egg counts (FEC) increased moderately, indicating exposure to both O ostertagi and probably Cooperia oncophora. Second season grazing animals had a peak FEC early in the grazing period, suggestive of a <b>potential</b> <b>carry-over</b> of Ostertagia species infection ('Type 2 ') during housing. All classes of cattle showed evidence of fluke (Fasciola hepatica) infection. Adult cow exposure to O ostertagi and fluke was estimated via the use of ELISA testing to detect antibodies to O ostertagi and F hepatica and the high levels detected suggested a significant exposure response.

40|$|Environmental {{conditions}} {{encountered by}} migratory seabirds in their wintering areas can shape their fitness. However, the underlying physiological mechanisms remain largely unknown as birds are relatively inaccessible during winter. To assess physiological condition during this period, we measured corticosterone concentrations in winter-grown primary feathers of female great skuas (Stercorarius skua) from three breeding colonies (Bjørnøya, Iceland, Shetland) with wintering areas identified from characteristic stable isotope signatures. We subsequently compared winter feather corticosterone levels between three wintering areas (Africa, Europe and America). Among females breeding in 2009, we found {{significant differences in}} feather corticosterone levels between wintering areas. Surprisingly, levels were significantly higher in Africa despite seemingly better local ecological factors (based on lower foraging effort). Moreover, contrary to our predictions, females sharing the same wintering grounds showed significant differences in feather corticosterone levels depending on their colony of origin suggesting that some skuas could be using suboptimal wintering areas. Among females wintering in Africa, Shetland females showed feather corticosterone levels on average 22 % lower than Bjørnøya and Iceland females. Finally, the lack of significant relationships between winter feather corticosterone levels and any of the breeding phenology traits {{does not support the}} hypothesis of <b>potential</b> <b>carry-over</b> effects of winter feather corticosterone.

40|$|In birds, {{different}} types of predators may target adults or offspring differentially and {{at different times of}} the reproductive cycle. Hence they may also differentially influence incubation behaviour and thus embryonic development and offspring phenotype. This is poorly understood, and we therefore performed a study to assess the effects of the presence of either a nest predator or a predator targeting adults and offspring after fledging on female incubation behaviour in great tits (Parus major), and the subsequent effects on offspring morphological traits. We manipulated perceived predation risk during incubation using taxidermic models of two predators: the short-tailed weasel posing a risk to incubating females and nestlings, and the sparrowhawk posing a risk to adults and offspring after fledging. To disentangle treatment effects induced during incubation from <b>potential</b> <b>carry-over</b> effects of parental behaviour after hatching, we cross-fostered whole broods from manipulated nests with broods from unmanipulated nests. Both predator treatments lead to a reduced on- and off-bout frequency, to a slower decline in on-bout temperature as incubation advanced and showed a negative effect on nestling body mass gain. At the current state of knowledge on predator-induced variation in incubation patterns alternative hypotheses are feasible, and {{the findings of this study}} will be useful for guiding future research...|$|E

The main goal of our studies was to experimentally identify this carry-over effect of intergroup threat. Specifically, we hypothesized that (by definition relatively abstract) symbolic threats (e. g., threats to the ingroup's worldview) have an especially strong <b>carry-over</b> <b>potential</b> because those threats can be easily attributed to other outgroups.

To understand the <b>potential</b> consequences of <b>carry-over</b> effects for management, we have introduced constant effort harvesting in the model.

Many amphibians can plastically respond to changes in pond drying by emerging earlier, but few studies have examined the post-metamorphic consequences for performance. To investigate the <b>potential</b> <b>carry-over</b> effects of plasticity to pond drying, we studied the túngara frog, Physalaemus pustulosus, a tropical anuran that breeds in highly ephemeral habitats. We conducted a field study with three different water depth treatments in 60 L mesocosms and measured time and size at metamorphosis, hind limb length and jumping performance. We also conducted a complimentary laboratory study that manipulated resources and water depth. In the field experiment, metamorphs from dry-down treatments emerged earlier, but at a similar size to constant volume treatments. In the laboratory experiment, metamorphs from the low depth and dry-down treatments emerged both earlier and smaller. In both studies, frogs from dry-down treatments had relatively shorter hind limbs, which negatively impacted their jumping performance. Reductions in resources delayed and reduced size at metamorphosis, but had no effect on jumping performance. We demonstrate that conditions experienced early in ontogeny can transcend the metamorphic boundary by erasing the relationship between hind limb length and jumping performance...|$|E

In order to accommodate for the intended uses of metaflumizone in Europe, Italy proposed to raise the existing MRLs for all the crops under consideration, except for pepper, head cabbage, Brussels sprouts, lettuce, scarole, melon and watermelon as well as to raise MRLs for several animal commodities. According to EFSA, the data are sufficient to derive MRL proposals for all crops under consideration, except for melons, watermelons, herbs and salad plants (except lettuce). For peppers, Brussels sprouts and head cabbage no need to modify the existing MRL was identified [...] The new intended use on cotton seed will not affect the existing livestock dietary burden and thus the <b>potential</b> <b>carry-over</b> of metaflumizone residues into food of animal origin was not further investigated.

Although most studies examine carry-over effects across 2 seasons in single populations, the effects may persist beyond the following season and vary across a species’ range. To assess <b>potential</b> <b>carry-over</b> effects across the annual cycle and among populations, we deployed geolocation loggers on black-legged kittiwakes Rissa tridactyla at 10 colonies in the north-east Atlantic and examined relationships between the timing and destination of migratory movements and breeding success {{in the year of}} deployment and sub - sequent season. Both successful and unsuccessful breeders wintered primarily in the north-west Atlantic. Breeding success affected the timing of migration, whereby unsuccessful breeders departed the colony earlier, arrived at the post-breeding and main wintering areas sooner, and departed later the following spring. However, these patterns were only apparent in colonies in the south-west of the study region. Furthermore, the effect of breeding success was stronger on migration timing {{in the first part of}} the winter than later. Timing of migratory movements was weakly linked to subsequent breeding success, and there was no detectable association between breeding success in the 2 seasons. Our results indicate temporal structure and spatial hetero - geneity in the strength of seasonal interactions among kittiwakes breeding in the north-east Atlantic. Variable fitness consequences for individuals from different colonies could have important implications for population processes across the species’ range and suggest that the spatiotemporal dynamics of carry-over effects warrant further study.

40|$|The {{different}} xenobiotic compounds, such as insecticides, fungicides, herbicides, chlorinated derivatives and polycyclic {{aromatic hydrocarbons}} (PAHs), which are widely used in agricultural activities for increased crop production and other human benefits, can enter the soil and water environments and cause significant toxic impacts on the soil health, microorganisms, ecosystem, human health and environmental quality. The application of biochar to soil can improve soil health and fertility, soil organic matter, nutrient content, pH and soil water retention and aggregation, but reduce soil greenhouse gas emissions, soil bulk density, erosion potential and leaching of pesticides and nutrients to surface and groundwater and mitigate climate change impacts. The biochar has high potential to remediate the soils contaminated by xenobiotic compounds reducing their mobility and bioavailability in soil. This book chapter has reviewed (1) biochar production properties and their effects on soil fertility, physical, chemical and biological properties; (2) the fate and behaviour of xenobiotics in soil, illustrating their interaction with soil constituents and uptake by plants; and (3) the remediation techniques to reduce mobility and bioavailability of the xenobiotic compounds through biochar application to soil. Depending on the type, amount of biochar applied and the physicochemical properties of the biochar itself, it may change the soil properties as well as impact the use, rates, efficacious properties and fates of xenobiotic compounds used in agronomic management. The effects of biochar on the fate and mobility of xenobiotic compounds in soil ecosystems depend on the soil types and properties. Since biochars contain colloidal-sized particles that move through soil pore water flows, colloid-facilitated transport could actually enhance mobility and leaching of xenobiotic compounds {{in the presence of}} biochar. Increased sorption to soils and recalcitrance of pesticides leading to longer residence times in the environment is desirable if bioactivity is still acceptable, and it controls the target pest. However, longer residence time may also create some environmental problems, such as greater leaching <b>potential</b> or <b>carry-over</b> problems into the following season...|$|R

(Food Technology) Abstract: Mycotoxins are toxic fungal {{metabolites}} {{and their}} indispensable nature in agriculture generates serious {{problems associated with}} food and farming systems for both human and animals worldwide. In this regard, the dairy farming sector is largely affected, with feeds routinely being contaminated posing a risk factor to productivity and animal health. In addition to this, the <b>potential</b> for <b>carry-over</b> of mycotoxins from animals to humans via consumption of contaminated animal by-products remains apparent thus making mycotoxin surveillance and monitoring a necessity in the bid to preserve public health. Such studies are very limited in South Africa. The overall aims {{of this study were}} therefore, to establish an understanding of Gauteng dairy farmer perception on mycotoxins and subsequently determine the degree with which the dairy cattle feeds are contaminated by these mycotoxins. A socio-demographic survey was undertaken in the Gauteng Province of South Africa, where 13 randomly selected dairy farms from various locations in the region participated by completing self-administered open- and closed-ended questionnaires. Additionally, similar farmers voluntarily donated representative samples of feeds and feed components for their animals. A total of 40 dairy feeds from different classes comprising maize grits, commercial dairy meals, silages, grasses, total mixed rations, brewer’s spent grains, molasses, bran and oilcake were therefore collected and analyzed for multi-mycotoxin contamination. Estimations of levels of aflatoxins (AFB 1, AFB 2, AFG 1 and AFG 2), fumonisin B 1 (FB 1), ochratoxin A (OTA), citrinin (CIT), zearalenone (ZEN), α-zearalenol (α-ZEL), β-zearalenol (β-ZEL), deoxynivalenol (DON), 3 - and 15 -acetyl-deoxynivealenol (ADONs), HT- 2 toxin (HT- 2) and beauvericin (BEA) were established using an ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC- QTOF–MS/MS). Calibration curves for all analytes showed good linearity (R 2 > 0. 998). The overall limits of detection (LODs) and quantification (LOQs) were in the range of 0. 02 - 3. 46 ppb and 0. 06 - 11. 52 ppb, respectively. On perception studies, data obtained indicated that all farmers had a general knowledge on mycotoxins and their associated risks, however, it was also revealed that there is generally among farmers, limited understanding of mycotoxin legislation and modern forms of mitigation strategies they may have access to as farmers.

40|$|Among {{several species}} of insect pests that attack the millet crop, the earhead caterpillar, Raghuva albipunctella de Joannis and Acigona ignefusalis Hmps., are {{considered}} the major pests. The constraints against the successful implementation of an integrated pest management programme of these insects are examined. The relative importance and significance of host plant resistance in such a programme is compared against other modalities. The use of insecticides is negated by lack of cash value returns, water supply, trained personnel and poor delivery system. Cultural practices, such as the synchronisation of early planting, destruction of harvest residues and end-of-season ploughing, have the <b>potential</b> for reducing <b>carry-over</b> populations. However, the difficulties in their implementation range from farmer education and efficiency to changes in traditional practices and introduction of new labour intensive practices after harvest. While it appears that natural enemies are taking a gradual toll on R. albipunctella, they appear inefficient in controlling A. ignefusalis. A range of plant characters have been identified: tillering in certain varieties {{as a form of}} tolerance to borers; maturity cycles that result in escape (pseudo-resistance) from Raghuva infestation, hairiness in relation to preference for oviposition and head compactness in deterring larval penetration into millet heads. Most of these characters are common in landrace types. The real problem appears to be one of incorporating and utilising the identified resistance into germplasm sources which possess other desirable agronomic characters that the farmer requires. This implies multi-disciplinary effort which is the basis for integrated pest management. In most of Africa, and in the Sahel in particular, this basis is remotely present. ...|$|R
40|$|Understanding the {{diversity}} of life {{is one of the}} main aims of evolutionary biology, and requires knowledge of the occurrence and causes of adaptive genetic differentiation among geographically distinct populations. Environmental stress caused by acidity may cause strong directional selection in natural populations, but is little explored from an evolutionary perspective. In this thesis, a series of laboratory experiments and field data was used to study evolutionary and ecological responses of amphibians to environmental acidity. Local adaptation to acid stress was studied in the moor frog (Rana arvalis). The results show that acid origin populations have higher acid stress tolerance during the embryonic stages than neutral origin populations, and that acid and neutral origin populations have diverged in embryonic and larval life-histories. The mechanisms underlying adaptive differentiation are partially mediated by maternal effects related to extra-embryonic membranes and egg size. Acid origin females invest in larger eggs and have a stronger egg size-fecundity trade-off than females from neutral areas, likely reflecting adaptive differentiation in maternal investment patterns. <b>Potential</b> <b>carry-over</b> effects of low pH, and the effects of UV-b/pH interaction were investigated in the common frog (R. temporaria). The results suggest that amphibian larvae are able to compensate for the negative effects of acidity experienced early in life, if conditions later turn beneficial. R. temporaria populations differed in their sensitivity to synergistic effects of low pH/UV-B, indicating variation in population responses to environmental stress. In conclusion, these results suggest rapid evolution in response to human induced environmental change, much of which may be mediated via adaptive maternal effects.

The ADI serves to determine maximum residue levels (MRL) for foodstuff of animal origin (meat, kidney, fat, milk, eggs and honey). The MRL are determined so that the daily intake of veterinary medicinal product residues up to these levels is not expected to endanger the health of the consumer.

Few studies have considered how CORT levels during non-breeding relate to a broader physiological profile during subsequent breeding, and fewer still have considered measures other than body condition. To explore CORT's <b>potential</b> role in <b>carry-over</b> effects, we investigated the relationship between CORT and foraging ecology of northern gannets (Morus bassanus) during the non-breeding period, and tested for associations between these factors and variation in a suite of physiological and biochemical metrics during subsequent breeding. Northern gannets are the largest seabird top predator in the North Atlantic and were among the hardest hit by the Deepwater Horizon oil blowout in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. We used light-level geolocators to confirm winter origins of individuals in our study. No interrelationships were found among levels of CORT from feathers grown during non-breeding (CORTf) and variation in foraging ecology, measured by stable isotopes of carbon (δ(13) C) and nitrogen (δ(15) N) from the same feathers. CORTf was correlated negatively with hematocrit and positively with triglyceride measured during subsequent incubation, and explained more variation in these variables than did body mass during incubation. These findings provide support for the hypothesis that energy management, measured using CORTf, during non-breeding carries over to influence physiological measures other than body condition. Gannets that previously wintered within the Gulf of Mexico {{in the years following}} the Deepwater Horizon oil blowout had higher levels of CORTf compared to birds that wintered along the Atlantic coast, suggesting an increased energetic cost associated with visiting the Gulf of Mexico.

The EMS proposed to raise the existing MRLs for aminopyralid in ruminant meat, fat, liver, kidney and milk. The metabolism of aminopyralid has been elucidated in lactating goats and poultry. Parent aminopyralid is proposed as residue definition for enforcement and risk assessment for all products of animal origin. The residue levels in the imported {{food of animal origin}} should reflect livestock exposure from the intake of all feed crops treated with aminopyralid in the country of origin. Since EFSA does not have a comprehensive overview of the feeding practices and the aminopyralid residues in feed available in these countries, it is more appropriate to calculate the dietary burden on an international level, using internationally agreed methodologies. Thus, livestock dietary burden calculated by the JMPR was used to estimate the <b>potential</b> <b>carry-over</b> of residues into food of animal origin. Data from feeding studies indicate that the existing EU MRLs have to be raised for ruminant meat, fat, kidney and liver. For milk, eggs, poultry and swine products no modification of the existing EU MRLs is required. Based on the risk assessment results, EFSA concludes that residues in food commodities of animal origin from the use of aminopyralid on grass in third countries and the resulting MRL proposals will not result in a consumer exposure exceeding the toxicological reference values and therefore is unlikely to pose a public health concern...|$|E

For example, young male soccer players born early in their age group are overrepresented in elite teams while studies in adult soccer indicated <b>potential</b> <b>carry-over</b> effects from talent development systems. This two-study approach focuses on the processes within multi-year age groups in youth and adult elite soccer and on the role of players’ age position within the age band with regard to players’ birth year and birth month. Study 1 tests for an interaction of two different types of relative age effects among data from participants in the last five Under- 17 FIFA World Cups (2007 – 2015). Analyses revealed a significant global within-year effect and varying birthdate distributions were found between confederations. Even stronger effects were found for constituent year effects. For the total sample, a multi-way frequency analysis (MFA) revealed an interaction with a pattern of a stronger within-year effect for the younger year group. This study highlights the need to consider interactions between different types of age effects. The main aim of Study 2 was to test for carry-over effects from previously found constituent year effects among players participating in the 2014 soccer World Cup and, therefore, to test for long-term effects of age grouping structures used during earlier stages of talent development. A secondary {{purpose of this study was}} to replicate findings on the existence of within-year effects and to test whether effects vary between continental confederations. No significant interaction between constituent year and within-year effects was shown by the MFA among the World Cup sample and previous findings on varying within-year effects were replicated. Results indicate that long-term effects of age grouping structures in earlier high-level talent development structures exist. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2013 Steelhead and {{rainbow trout}} are common names for marine-migratory (anadromous) and freshwater-resident forms of Oncorhynchus mykiss, a {{partially}} migratory salmonid fish. Anadromous and resident forms are sympatric and can produce offspring {{with a life}} history different from their own (i. e., steelhead parents can produce rainbow trout offspring and vice versa). The expression of these alternative life histories is a plastic response to individual patterns of energy acquisition, assimilation, and allocation during juvenile life stages. Individual performance during early stream life {{is of particular interest}} because of <b>potential</b> <b>carry-over</b> effects on subsequent growth and developmental trajectories. In a series of experiments in laboratory streams, I determined the influence of individual variation in energy metabolism on behavior, growth, and life-history expression in O. mykiss. Individual variation in energy metabolism was a strong predictor of feeding territory acquisition by juvenile fish during the transition from dependence on maternal provisioning of egg yolk reserves to independent feeding. Feeding territory acquisition was positively associated with standard metabolic rate (SMR) under conditions of an abundant and predictable food supply. When the density of intraspecific competitors was manipulated, the association between SMR and territory acquisition was strongest at intermediate stocking densities, moderate at the highest stocking densities, and weakest at the lowest stocking densities. However, reducing the spatial predictability of food resources within streams reversed the influence of SMR on competitive outcomes. These experiments determined that variation in ecological conditions during early life stages imposes different selection regimes on juvenile O. mykiss and results in physiological divergence among cohorts. Subsequent rearing experiments determined that behavioral dominance influences rates of anadromy and freshwater maturation, most likely through the association between SMR and territory acquisition. In addition to the effects of behavioral dominance, I observed a significant influence of sex, rearing temperature, and individual growth trajectories on the expression of anadromy and freshwater maturation. Partially migratory populations of O. mykiss maintain an exceptionally diverse portfolio of life-history strategies. Results from this work lend insight into a suite of behavioral and physiological processes influencing individual life histories...|$|E
40|$|The {{knowledge}} of capture efficiency and {{side effects of}} electrofishing is essential for research and monitoring of stream fish populations. Differences amongst electrofishing crews have hardly been investigated and are particularly important given the on-going implementation of the Water Framework Directive and wide-ranging exchange of data worldwide. We aimed to assess fish catchability in Mediterranean streams and to compare four electrofishing crews (with minor differences in gears used) and their short-term effects on fish populations. In eight different sites, we compared two adjacent stations, one sampled with conventional single-pass catch-effort data and the other closed with block nets and with four-pass removal estimates. We used a Williams' cross-over design to estimate the independent effects of repeated sampling in four consecutive days, site and crew and also to assess a <b>potential</b> <b>carry-over</b> effect. We modelled capture probability and estimated population size using program MARK and an information-theoretic framework. Our results show that electrofishing was generally efficient in these reaches, with 50 - 100 % of the species and of 40 - 60 % of the individuals captured in a single pass. The CPUE was significantly higher at sites blocked with nets than at open sites, but observed richness was not significantly different. Capture probability was generally not constant along removal passes and increased with fish size. Observed fish richness and species composition did not depend on electrofishing crew and fishing day {{and there was no}} significant carryover effect. There were, however, significant differences in single-pass CPUE estimates amongst electrofishing crews, after accounting for other sources of variation. There was also a significant carry-over effect, surprisingly with increasing fish captured after fishing by specific crews. Overall, our results suggest that although capture probability depends heavily on a number of factors (such as species, size, and sampling site) and needs careful consideration, the effect of electrofishing crew is negligible for assessment of species richness and composition but considerable for fish abundanceThis study was financially supported by the Catalan Water Agency (project Ibicat 2) and the Spanish Ministry of Science (projects CGL 2009 - 12877 -C 02 - 01 and Consolider-Ingenio 2010 CSD 2009 - 00065...|$|E
40|$|The Actinide Removal Process (ARP) {{facility}} and the Modular Caustic Side Solvent Extraction Unit (MCU) {{are scheduled to}} begin processing salt waste in fiscal year 2007. A portion of the streams generated in the salt processing facilities will {{be transferred to the}} Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) to be incorporated in the glass matrix. Before the streams are introduced, a combination of impact analyses and research and development studies must be performed to quantify the impacts on DWPF processing. The Process Science & Engineering (PS&E) section of the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) was requested via Technical Task Request (TTR) HLW/DWPF/TTR- 2004 - 0031 to evaluate the impacts on DWPF processing. Simulant Chemical Process Cell (CPC) flowsheet studies have been performed using previous composition and projected volume estimates for the ARP sludge/monosodium titanate (MST) stream. Due to changes in the flammability control strategy for DWPF for salt processing, the incorporation strategy for ARP has changed and additional ARP flowsheet tests were necessary to validate the new processing strategy. The last round of ARP testing included the incorporation of the MCU stream and identified potential processing issues with the MCU solvent. The identified issues included the <b>potential</b> <b>carry-over</b> and accumulation of the MCU solvent components in the CPC condensers and in the recycle stream to the Tank Farm. Therefore, DWPF requested SRNL to perform additional MCU flowsheet studies to better quantify the organic distribution in the CPC vessels. The previous MCU testing used a Sludge Batch 4 (SB 4) simulant since it was anticipated that both of these facilities would begin salt processing during SB 4 processing. The same sludge simulant recipe was used in this round of ARP and MCU testing to minimize the number of changes between the two phases of testing so a better comparison could be made. ARP and MCU stream simulants were made for this phase of testing. The ARP stream represented the sludge/MST stream from Appendix E of the material balance provided by Subosits. The MCU stream represented the ''Maximum Volume'' case from the material balances provided by Campbell. The latest DWPF processing plan involves adding the ARP stream to the sludge at boiling in the Sludge Receipt and Adjustment Tank (SRAT). This would be accomplished before the SRAT receipt sample is taken and SRAT processing is initiated. The MCU stream will be added at boiling during the normal reflux phase of the SRAT cycle. The SRAT cycle will be considered complete once the MCU stream has been added. SRNL replicated this processing strategy in this testing...|$|E
40|$|Managing {{oxidative}} stress {{is an important}} physiological function for all aerobic organisms, particularly during periods of prolonged high metabolic activity, such as long-distance migration. However, no previous study has investigated the oxidative status of songbirds {{at different stages of}} migration, whether that oxidative status depends on the condition of the birds, how birds use their condition in concert with access to free water to make stopover decisions, or the effects of oxidative challenges like flight on subsequent reproduction. Additionally, scientists undertaking such research are commonly expected to disseminate their results as a Broader Impact of their studies - typically to secure research funding - and often struggle to do so, given that they are not usually trained in non-technical communication or public engagement. In this dissertation, I introduce the fundamentals of oxidative balance in flying songbirds (Chapter 1), discuss physiological factors affecting the condition and behavior of migratory songbirds on stopover (Chapters 2 and 3), describe the impact of dietary antioxidants and flight exercise on songbird reproduction (Chapter 4), and present a framework of guiding principles to help researchers communicate their science (Chapter 5). Development of this framework influenced the style and approach of the dissertation as a whole, with each chapter’s organization and figure design benefiting from lessons transferrable from communication with non-scientist audiences to communication with professional peers. To investigate the relationship between energy stores and oxidative status of long-distance migratory birds on stopover, I drew blood samples from two species of Neotropical migrant (Blackpoll Warbler, Setophaga striata, and Red-eyed Vireo, Vireo olivaceus) with differing migration strategies during autumn migration on Block Island, USA, and a species of trans-Saharan migrant (Garden Warbler, Sylvia borin) during spring migration on the island of Ponza, Italy; I found fat stores to be positively correlated with circulating antioxidant capacity in Blackpoll Warblers and Red-eyed Vireos and positively correlated with circulating lipid oxidation levels in all three species. Among Garden Warblers, oxidative damage levels decreased with time on stopover (up to 8 nights). Thus, the physiological strategy of migrating songbirds appears to be to (1) build prophylactic antioxidant capacity in concert with fuel stores at stopover sites before a long-distance flight, and (2) repair oxidative damage while refueling at stopover sites after long-distance flight. To assess the contribution of free water to migratory birds’ stopover decisions, I captured 61 free-living Garden Warblers in spring at a frequently used stopover site in the Mediterranean Sea, housed them with or without drinking water, and measured nocturnal restlessness (Zugunruhe) in relation to energy stores at capture; water-deprived birds of high fat score showed the highest Zugunruhe activity, suggesting that individuals with higher fat scores might be expected, regardless of flight muscle size, to depart a dry stopover site more readily than a site with freely available water. To examine how songbirds use nutrition to manage trade-offs in antioxidant allocation between endurance flight and subsequent reproduction, I performed a controlled experiment with Zebra Finches (Taeniopygia guttata), using four treatment groups of birds that either were or were not provided a water- and lipid-soluble antioxidant-supplemented diet and were or were not trained to perform daily endurance flight for 6 weeks before breeding; I found that exercised birds had higher oxidative damage levels than non-exercised birds after flight training, supplementation with water-soluble antioxidants decreased the deposition of lipid-soluble antioxidants to eggs and yolk size, and flight exercise lowered deposition of lutein but not vitamin E to eggs. These results mechanistically demonstrate <b>potential</b> <b>carry-over</b> effects of nutrition and exertion on the capacity of songbirds to provision eggs with important nutrients after long-distance flights. To address how the potential for “impact” of varied Broader Impacts dissemination activities can be critically assessed during proposal writing and peer review, I combined the experiences of successful practitioners with communication theory to synthesize a five-point framework; this “Broader Impacts Impact Framework” summarizes best practices in communication and outreach, can be easily used by scientists during proposal writing and review, and focuses on five main factors: who, why, what, how, and with whom...|$|E
