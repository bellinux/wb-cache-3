40|$|ABSTRACT Diet-induced {{thermogenesis}} {{has been}} evaluated in five ovariectomized young women, five late pregnant (at the 8 th month of pregnancy) and five age matched lean control women. <b>Post-prandial</b> <b>thermogenesis</b> was tested after a 900 Kcal mixed meal. Although pregnant (p less than 0. 05) and ovariectomized showed a {{basal metabolic rate}} higher than control females, both groups had a significantly lower <b>post-prandial</b> <b>thermogenesis</b> {{when compared to the}} lean one (p less than 0. 05). It is concluded that <b>post-prandial</b> <b>thermogenesis</b> is depressed in pregnant and ovariectomized females and that this condition may facilitate, at least in predisposed adult women, the development of obesity...|$|E
40|$|Thermogenesis is an {{obligatory}} {{consequence of}} cellular metabolism and {{is identified as}} a unique property of homeotherms which have to maintain constant their body temperature in a cold environment. Physiologically, thermogenesis is made of basal metabolism, <b>post-prandial</b> <b>thermogenesis,</b> exercise-induced thermogenesis and adaptive thermogenesis induced by changes in the environmental temperature. Biochemically, thermogenesis comes from exergonic reactions from a loose coupling between endergonic and exergonic reactions. In cells, respiration and oxidations occur in mitochondria which ensure the coupling of oxidative energy to ATP synthesis. Identification of mitochondrial uncoupling proteins UCP allowed further understanding of the mechanism of coupling or uncoupling of respiration to ADP phosphorylation. Such data maybe of help in the understanding, or possible treatment, of certain types of obesity...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{dexfenfluramine}} (dFE: 30 mg per os) on energy expenditure were evaluated in seven young obese male subjects (mean +/- s. d. : age 30. 9 +/- 6. 1 years; BMI 39. 8 +/- 4. 4 kg/m 2). Each subject was submitted, on a double-blind protocol and by random order, to four tests in which dFE or placebo (Pla) were administered {{either in the}} fasting state or in combination with a mixed test meal. Energy expenditure was measured by indirect calorimetry for 60 min before (BMR) and from 90 to 330 min after dFE or Pla. In those cases where the protocol required it, a mixed test meal (5 MJ, 1200 kcal; percentage of protein, carbohydrate and fat: 15, 55, and 30 respectively) was eaten 120 min after dFE or Pla. In the fasting state resting metabolic rate increased after dFE (mean +/-s. d. : 0. 49 +/- 0. 20 kJ/min) but not after Pla (- 0. 04 +/- 0. 16 kJ/min) in comparison to BMR, {{the difference between the}} two tests being highly significant (P < 0. 01). <b>Post-prandial</b> <b>thermogenesis</b> (over 3 h) was also significantly higher after dFE than after Pla (232 +/- 85 kJ vs. 181 +/- 73 kJ; P < 0. 025). On the other hand, dFE did not affect respiratory quotient (RQ), either in the fasting state or in the fed state. These results show that in obese subjects dFE increases energy expenditure in the post-absorptive state, as well as after the ingestion of food...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to examine the effects of a 12 -week {{endurance}} exercise training on resting metabolic rate (RMR), thermic effect of a meal (TEM), and excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC), and to provide insights into mechanisms by determining several blood hormones and substrates responsible for metabolic alterations consequent to exercise training. Nineteen untrained male subjects, aged 18 – 32 yrs, were randomly assigned to one of two groups, i. e., exercise training group (EX) or control group (CON). All subjects participated in a 45 -min RMR test, a 180 -min TEM test, and a EPOC test following an exercise for 30 min at 70 % VO 2 max at pre-intervention test, followed by 12 weeks of intervention. Upon the completion of intervention, RMR, TEM, and EPOC were measured. Subjects in the EX group completed two EPOC sessions at post-intervention test, i. e., same absolute intensity trials and same relative intensity trials. Epinephrine, norepinephrine, total and free thyroxine, insulin (INS), cortisol, free fatty acids (FFA), blood glucose and/or blood lactate were determined during RMR, TEM, and EPOC tests. No significant change in RMR was found in the EX group, whereas RMR decreased significantly in the CON group. The mechanism for the decreased RMR in the CON group was uncertain. The results suggest that 12 weeks of endurance exercise training program failed to increase RMR; however, exercise training might have prevented a decline in RMR. TEM increased significantly following the 12 -week exercise training as post-prandial INS sensitivity and/or glucose absorption may have increased with training. The magnitude of EPOC decreased during the same absolute intensity trial following 12 weeks of exercise training, indicating that exercise training improved control of metabolic stress during recovery from a bout of exercise. During the same relative intensity trial, no significant change in the EPOC response was found, suggesting that EPOC varies as a function of relative intensity. It was concluded that 12 weeks of endurance exercise training increased post-absorptive and <b>post-prandial</b> <b>thermogenesis</b> and improved metabolic efficiency during recovery from a bout of exercise. ...|$|E
40|$|Total daily energy {{expenditure}} (TEE) {{is composed of}} resting metabolic rate (RMR), <b>post-prandial</b> <b>thermogenesis</b> and activity {{energy expenditure}} (AEE). Higher AEE is strongly associated with lower mortality and physical limitations among older adults, but factors that predict changes in AEE in septu and octogenarians are not clearly understood. To identify factors associated with late-life longitudinal change in AEE. Energy expenditure was re-assessed in 83 participants (average age at baseline, 74. 4 ± 3. 2 years) -an average of 7. 5 ± 0. 54 years since the baseline measure. RMR was measured using indirect calorimetry and the thermic effect of meals was estimated at 10 % of TEE. AEE was calculated as: TEE(0. 9) -RMR. Participants were categorized into two groups according to the estimated day-to-day precision of the doubly-labeled water technique. Those who were within 10 % or increased relative to their initial AEE measurement were categorized as having preserved AEE. Participants who declined greater than 10 % of their initial measurement were categorized as having reduced AEE. A variety of socio-demographic, functional and mental factors, body composition, community and personal behaviors, blood measurements and health conditions were evaluated between groups at baseline and changes during follow-up. Daily AEE declined 106. 61 ± 293. 25 kcal, which equated to a 14. 63 ± 40. 57 kcal/d decrease per year. Fifty-nine percent (n = 49) preserved their AEE and 41 % (n = 34) declined. Those who demonstrated a decline in AEE were older, had lower walking speed at baseline and showed a higher lean mass loss during follow up. Otherwise, groups were similar for socio-demographic characteristics, body composition, mental and physical function, health conditions and community and personal behaviors at baseline and change in these factors during follow-up. This study demonstrates that AEE declines through the 8 th decade of life and is associated with age, lower walking speed at baseline and lean mass loss. Additionally, there are {{a significant number of}} individuals who appear to be resilient to these declines despite having health events that are expected to {{have a negative impact on}} their physical activity...|$|E
