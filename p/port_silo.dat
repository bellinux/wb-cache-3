50|$|One of {{the main}} {{criteria}} of the registration was that intrastate operation was not permitted. The load had to come from one state and be delivered to another state or territory. Many grain carriers were reported and prosecuted for cartage from the paddock to the silos. If, though, {{they went to a}} <b>port</b> <b>silo,</b> they were given the benefit of the doubt, as that grain was more than likely going overseas.|$|E

Both spaces were injected with CO 2 and smoke stopped coming from the <b>port</b> <b>silo.</b> Smoke continued from the starboard silo and {{with the assistance of the}} local fire brigade water and foam were used. Monitoring of the silo continued and more water was used later. With the second injection of water the seat of the fire was deemed to have been reached and there was no further danger. No livestock was on board at the time.

50|$|The {{transportation}} industry {{accounts for more}} than 1,000 jobs. The Twin Ports of Duluth-Superior, the largest in the Great Lakes, welcomes both domestic and foreign vessels. Bulk solids (such as grain) make up much of the tonnage handled by the <b>port,</b> and the <b>silos</b> of such <b>port</b> facilities are visible on the Superior waterfront. In 2004, the port’s busiest year since 1979, more than 41.4 million metric tons were shipped out of the port. Burlington Northern Railroad has an operations hub in Superior.|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} metal silo {{structures}} {{is dominated by}} the need to resist shell buckling failures in service. Shell buckling can occur in many different modes, and the strengths are very sensitive to the form and amplitude of very minor deviations of geometry (geometric imperfections) from the ideal shape. Many imperfection forms have been studied in the theoretical literature on shell buckling, but only one study appears to have ever extensively and rigorously measured the imperfections in real full-scale metal silos: this is the study of the 10, 000 tonne <b>Port</b> Kembla grain <b>silos</b> in NSW, Australia. The data from this study of three seemingly identical silos are very extensive and cannot be assimilated without considerable processing. In this paper, the first attempt is made to provide a full characterisation of the imperfection set in a manner that permits them to be used in shell buckling analyses of the silo shell that do not rely on simplifying assumptions.
