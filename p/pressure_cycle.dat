50|$|We {{see that}} the {{adiabatic}} flame temperature of the constant pressure process is {{lower than that of}} the constant volume process. This is because some of the energy released during combustion goes into changing the volume of the control system. One analogy that is commonly made between the two processes is through combustion in an internal combustion engine. For the constant volume adiabatic process, combustion is thought to occur instantaneously when the piston reaches the top of its apex (Otto cycle or constant volume cycle). For the constant pressure adiabatic process, while combustion is occurring the piston is moving {{in order to keep the}} pressure constant (Diesel cycle or constant <b>pressure</b> <b>cycle).</b>|$|E
5000|$|Inductive pumps {{use both}} sides of the piston to pump and suction simultaneously. This means that {{both sides of}} the pump piston are always {{experiencing}} the inlet pressure at a minimum until the <b>pressure</b> <b>cycle</b> that would exceed the inlet pressure. This may be interpreted as meaning the net head pressure in a close circuit, {{at the beginning of a}} stroke cycle, is always zero. Therefore, inductive pumps may be used in very high pressure closed circuits to circulate liquids at very low differential pressures. Essentially the inductive pump does not have to overcome the closed system pressure in order to move liquid in the system. This results in far less use of energy to move liquid with the circuit. This also provides additional circulation without any dynamic seals that could eventually leek to the outside of the system.|$|E

50|$|In 1872 George Brayton {{patented}} {{a constant}} pressure internal combustion engine, initially using vaporized gas but later using liquid fuels such as kerosene and oil, known as Brayton's Ready Motor, The engine used one cylinder for compression, a receiver reservoir, {{and a separate}} power/expander cylinder in which the products of combustion expanded for the power stroke. The significant difference from other piston driven internal combustion engines {{is that the two}} cylinders are arranged so that the fuel/air mixture burns progressively at constant pressure as it is transferred from the compressor cylinder and reservoir to the working/expansion cylinder. In the original version a gas/air mixture was created by a heated-surface carburetor, then compressed and stored in a reservoir where it was ignited and then introduced into an expansion cylinder. A metal gauze/mesh was used to prevent the combustion running back to the reservoir. However at times the mesh failed, leading to flash-back or explosion. In 1874 Brayton filed a patent for a liquid fuel injection system. In this version, fuel was introduced as the air passed into the expansion cylinder, thus eliminating the explosion problem. Ignition remained a pilot flame. The principle was referred to as constant pressure combustion, and had been attempted without success by Sir William Siemens c1861 using a 4-cylinder engine with a separate combustion chamber. Brayton not only achieved success in making the constant <b>pressure</b> <b>cycle</b> work, but he also made and marketed a commercial product.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{last decade}} has seen {{remarkable}} improvements in industrial gas turbine size and performances. There {{is no doubt}} that the coming years are holding the promises of even more progress in these fields. As a consequence, the fuel utilization achieved by combined cycle power plants has been steadily increased. This is however also because of the developments in the heat recovery technology. Advances on the gas turbine side justify the development of new combined cycle schemes, with more advanced heat recovery capabilities. Hence, the system performance is spiralling upwards. In this paper, we look at some of the heat recovery possibilities with the newly available gas turbine engines, characterized by a high exhaust temperature, a high specific work, and the integration of some gas turbine cooling with the boiler. The schemes range from classical dual pressure systems, to triple pressure systems with reheat in supercritical steam conditions. For each system, an optimum set of variables (steam pressures, etc) is proposed. The effect of some changes on the steam cycle parameters, like increasing the steam temperatures above 570 °C are also considered. Emphasis is also put on the influence of some special features or arrangements of the heat recovery steam generators, not only from a thermodynamic point of view.

30|$|The {{diminishing}} {{oil resources}} make the {{exploration and development}} of heavy oil reservoirs more and more important. Heavy oil reservoirs need steam stimulation or other thermal development methods; temperature increasing during the thermal recovery process will inevitably affect the reservoir compressive characteristics. In order to study the variation of the compression coefficient of heavy oil reservoirs in the multi-round steam stimulation process, the compression coefficients of the reservoirs after different temperature and pore pressure cycles were tested. The {{results show that the}} compression coefficient of heavy oil reservoir decreases with the increase in effective confining pressure and increases with the increase in test temperature; After the temperature and pore <b>pressure</b> <b>cycle,</b> the compression coefficient of the rock is greatly reduced; the decrease in range of compression coefficient of the reservoir after the temperature and pore <b>pressure</b> <b>cycle</b> increases with the increase in the test temperature, and increases with the increase in maximum effective confining pressure.
