50|$|Euphorbia peplus (<b>petty</b> <b>spurge,</b> radium weed, cancer weed, or milkweed) is {{a species}} of Euphorbia, native to most of Europe, {{northern}} Africa, and western Asia, where it typically grows in cultivated arable land, gardens, and other disturbed land.|$|E
50|$|Ingenol mebutate is a newer {{treatment}} for AK used in Europe and the United States. It works in two ways, first by disrupting cell membranes and mitochondria resulting cell death, {{and then by}} inducing antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity to eliminate remaining tumor cells. A 3-day treatment course with the 0.015% gel is recommended for the scalp and face, while a 2-day treatment course with the 0.05% gel is recommended for the trunk and extremities. Treatment with the 0.015% gel was found to completely clear 57% of AK, while the 0.05% gel had a 34% clearance rate. Advantages of ingenol mebutate treatment include the short duration of therapy and a low recurrence rate. Local skin reactions including pain, itching and redness can be expected during treatment with ingenol mebutate. This treatment {{was derived from the}} <b>petty</b> <b>spurge,</b> Euphorbia peplus which {{has been used as a}} traditional remedy for keratosis.|$|E
30|$|Ingenol mebutate is a {{diterpene}} ester {{derived from}} the sap of the Euphorbia peplus (<b>petty</b> <b>spurge)</b> plant. Topical application is associated with both chemo-ablative and immunomodulatory effects (Dodds et al. 2014). This combination of activity results in preferential cell death in transformed keratinocytes and an inflammatory reaction that kills any remaining cancerous cells (Martin and Swanson 2013). However, the precise mechanism of action of ingenol mebutate is still the subject of research. A recent study suggested that ingenol mebutate-induced cell death is mediated through the PKCÎ´/MEK/ERK pathway, and that downstream induction of IL 1 R 2 and IL 13 RA 2 expression reduce the viability of treated cells (Freiberger et al. 2015).|$|E
40|$|Background The sap from Euphorbia peplus, {{commonly}} known as <b>petty</b> <b>spurge</b> in the U. K. or radium weed in Australia, {{has been used as}} a traditional treatment for a number of cancers. Objective To determine the effectiveness of E. peplus sap in a phase I /II clinical study for the topical treatment of basal cell carcinomas (BCC), squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) and intraepidermal carcinomas (IEC). Methods Thirty-six patients, who had refused, failed or were unsuitable for conventional treatment, were enrolled in a phase I /II clinical study. A total of 48 skin cancer lesions were treated topically with 100 - 300 lL of E. peplus sap once daily for 3 days. Results The complete clinical response rates at 1 month were 82 % (n = 28) for BCC, 94 % (n = 16) for IEC and 75 % (n = 4) for SCC. After a mean follow-up of 15 months these rates were 57 %, 75 % and 50 %, respectively. For superficial lesions 2 cm in diameter), are comparable with existing nonsurgical treatments. An active ingredient of E. peplus sap has been identified as ingenol mebutate (PEP 005). This clinical study affirms community experience with E. peplus sap, and supports further clinical development of PEP 005 for the treatment of BCC, SCC and IEC. No Full Tex...|$|E
40|$|In {{the absence}} of a clear {{understanding}} of the aetiology of diseases and measurable parameters for the attributes of drugs described in the traditional systems of medicine, an approach encompassing a broad spectrum of biological activities on the whole body that may be ascribable to the attributes of the drugs and aetiology of a disease described in the traditional medical systems such as Ayurveda, taken to investigate putative anticancer plants, is presented. Extracts of the putative anticancer plants, Euphorbia peplus L. (<b>petty</b> <b>spurge)</b> and Viola odorata L. (sweet violet), which grow in Australia, were investigated for in vitro anticancer activity using DPPH free radical scavenging, Fe-(III) -TPTZ reducing (FRAP) and linoleic peroxidation inhibitory (TBARS and FTC) antioxidant activities; human complement inhibitory (CP and AP), anti-platelet aggregating (impedance method), COX- 2 inhibitory immunomodulatory activities as well as the conventional in vitro anticancer activities using CEM (3 H] thymidine uptake, MTS and US-NCI's sulforhodamine B assay using 60 cell line humour tumour screen. Results were compared with relevant standards. Isolation of active extracts and chemical studies were carried out using HPLC-PDA, UV-VIS, TLC, GC-MS, ESI-MS, and AAS. Although the two plants have failed in the NCI's conventional in vitro anticancer screen, our results showed that the extracts of both plants indicated a combination of biological activities. These results raise the possibility that broad-spectrum approach comprising a number of different biological systems may help to explain the purported in vivo anticancer activity of Euphorbia peplus L. and Viola odorata L. Preliminary chemical studies showed the presence of the flavonoid, quercetin among other compounds, in the antioxidant extracts of both plants. The ESI-MS and GC-MS profiles may be used to characterise the active extracts. Presented results may be used to design further in vivo studies towards utilising natural resources as anticancer agents...|$|E
