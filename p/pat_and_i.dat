5000|$|The {{rivalry with}} Sunday Silence {{concluded}} in the Breeders' Cup Classic, run on November 4 at 1¼ miles. With champion honors at stake, {{the race was}} labeled [...] "Race of the Decade" [...] by the horse racing media. Easy Goer was favored by the wagering public based on his Belmont Stakes win and four subsequent Grade I wins, three against older horses. Sunday Silence's regular rider, Patrick Valenzuela, had recently been suspended for cocaine use. Trainer Charles E. Whittingham assigned the mount to Chris McCarron. Easy Goer came into the 10-furlong Classic off the 12-furlong Gold Cup—a potentially tricky parlay for a trainer, because the longer race can have the dangerous effect of dulling the colt's natural speed and blunting the quickness that he might need in a shorter race. In contrast, trainer Charlie Whittingham had run Sunday Silence only twice in the five months since the Belmont, both times over a 1¼-mile distance—in the Grade II Swaps Stakes at Hollywood Park, where he finished second, and two months later in the Sept. 24 Super Derby at Louisiana Downs, which he won. Easy Goer ran 11 lengths off the lead, about seven lengths behind Sunday Silence, behind the brisk opening fractions of 22:2/5 and 46:1/5, but made a big run down the backstretch and got near his rival at the half-mile point. Sunday Silence then made a charge turning for home and gained {{the lead in the}} final furlong, four lengths ahead of Easy Goer. Easy Goer closed ground late with another big move but lost by a diminishing neck to Sunday Silence, who was under strong urging by McCarron, with a final time of 2:00 1/5. Blushing John, the American Champion Older Dirt Male Horse that year, finished behind the top two in third. The victory assured Sunday Silence Eclipse Award for Outstanding Three-Year-Old Male Horse and Horse of the Year honors for 1989. After the race, McGaughey said, [...] "Sunday Silence had a perfect trip and we made a couple of mistakes. <b>Pat</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> agree that he made riding mistakes in the Preakness. But in the other races, there were circumstances that contributed to what happened. Maybe when Pat grabbed him after the start, the horse didn't understand what he was doing. Then Pat was content to sit and wait behind Sunday Silence, as he had done before, and the other horse got away from us. [...] In my heart, I think Easy Goer is the better horse; [...] I think anybody would say that if those two ran against each other ten times, each would probably win five." [...] Day said his ride wasn't the best, while also stating, [...] "I've said it before, I think Easy Goer was better than Sunday Silence, despite his three to one edge in the head to head races. [...] I'll go to my grave believing that. We lost two photos to him and the one in the Preakness was due to a rider error on my part." [...] Current Daily Racing Form publisher Steven Crist stated in his New York Times article in January 1990 that had the question on the ballot been, [...] "Who is the better horse, Sunday Silence or Easy Goer?", his view was that a lot more than 19 people would have voted against Sunday Silence. Crist also went on to state, [...] "Easy Goer was a great horse and so was Sunday Silence. I still think Easy Goer had more pure, raw talent. [...] Sunday Silence held the three to one edge over Easy Goer in the races they met, but he never beat him in a way that proved he was just plain better. In Easy Goer's best race, he walloped Sunday Silence by eight lengths in the Belmont. In a few of his close defeats, Easy Goer had legitimate excuses: he lost the Derby on a muddy track he did not handle, and lost the Preakness by only a nose after a dubious ride. In the Classic, where Sunday Silence held him off by a neck, Easy Goer just missed, but left no one thinking it could not have gone the other way." [...] Daily Racing Form's Mike Watchmaker concurred, stating, [...] "To this day, you won't have any trouble finding people who believe that Easy Goer was a better racehorse than Sunday Silence. I know this, because I am one of them." [...] "Paul Moran of the Los Angeles Times and Newsday agreed, stating, [...] "Sunday Silence is Horse of the Year, but most still believe Easy Goer is the better horse. Sunday Silence is Horse of the Year despite never having won at 12 furlongs (the classic distance for the most of the world) and never having given weight while defeating older horses, as Easy Goer did in three races. He is Horse of the Year despite going one for three during a span of five months while Easy Goer won the Belmont, Whitney, Travers, Woodward and Jockey Club Gold Cup." ...|$|E

40|$|The model linking {{environmental}} impact to population, affluence, and technology, or I = PAT, is reformulated {{in terms of}} households (i. e., I = HAT) as opposed to persons. Such an approach may be preferable {{in the case of}} {{environmental impact}}s that arise from activities, such as residential heating and automobile transport, for which there exist significant household-level economies of scale. Because of changes in average household size, the I = HAT model gives rise to a very different decomposition of the sources of historical growth of environmental impacts than does I = PAT. Taking growth of global energy consumption as an example, the authors find that I = PAT attributes 18 percent of the annual increase (in absolute terms) over the period 1970 - 90 to demographic increase in more developed regions, whereas I = HAT attributes 41 percent because the number of households grew faster than the number of persons. The I = <b>PAT</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> = HAT models also give rise to substantially different projections of CO_ 2 emissions in the year 2100.

40|$|Reversible S-palmitoylation confers spatiotemporal {{control of}} protein {{function}} by modulating protein stability, trafficking and activity {{as well as}} protein-protein and membrane-protein associations. While {{it is evident that}} palmitoylation is regulated in vivo, mechanisms that mediate cellular stimuli-driven changes of the lipid modification are not understood. Furthermore, the requirement for substrate specificity among the highly redundant palmitoyl acyltransferases (PATs) remains unresolved. To study the regulation of <b>PATs</b> <b>and</b> palmitoylomes, <b>I</b> developed bioorthogonal chemical strategies for improved analysis of dynamic palmitoylation in mammalian cells. I showed that alkyne-functionalized fatty acids, in conjunction with azido-fluorophores, provide the most sensitive detection of acylated proteins following CuI-catalyzed azidealkyne cycloaddition. Linkage-specific hydrolysis, mutagenesis and inhibitor studies reveal that these alkynyl-fatty acids are incorporated into proteins by endogenous fattyacylation machinery via native linkages at specific amino acid residues. In addition, shorter and longer chain fatty acids label myristoylated and palmitoylated proteins respectively. Since myristoylation is co-translational <b>and</b> constitutive, <b>I</b> employed both palmitoylation and myristoylation chemical reporters with orthogonal fluorophores to simultaneously monitor palmitate and protein turnover. Dual pulse-chase analysis of Lck, a tyrosine kinase required for T-cell signaling, revealed accelerated palmitate cycling upon T-cell activation. Pharmacological perturbation of Lck palmitate turnover suggests yet uncharacterized serine hydrolases contribute to dynamic palmitoylation in cells. These significant improvements allow rapid and robust biochemical analysis of palmitoylated proteins without overexpression, facilitating the functional characterization of cellular factors and drugs that modulate protein palmitoylation. Taking advantage of the sensitive bioorthogonal detection of protein palmitoylation <b>and</b> the simple <b>PAT</b> network in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, I provided evidence for regulation of <b>PATs</b> <b>and</b> palmitoylomes in vivo at physiological enzyme <b>and</b> substrate concentrations. <b>I</b> showed that the Erf 2 -Erf 4 PAT modulates sexual differentiation, and that upregulation of its expression is required to establish the meiotic palmitoylome. Importantly, I demonstrated that changes in Erf 2 - Erf 4 levels within the physiological range control <b>PAT</b> specificity <b>and</b> result in the differential palmitoylation of its substrates in vegetative and meiotic cells. Underscoring the biological significance of controlling PAT levels, Erf 2 -Erf 4 overproduction in proliferating cells alters the palmitoylome and the subcellular distribution of Rho 3, a major meiotic target, stimulating sexual differentiation in the absence of normal physiological cues. From this study, I conclude that PAT substrate specificity depends on enzyme levels and propose the rheostatic control of PAT activity as a mechanism by which cells shape stimuli-induced palmitoylomes. Future questions stemming from this work are also discussed...|$|R
