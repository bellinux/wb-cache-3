40|$|BACKGROUND: Research {{findings}} are of little benefit to patients or society {{if they do}} not reach the audience they are intended to influence. A dissemination strategy is needed to target new findings at its user group and encourage a process of consideration and adoption or rejection. AIM: To evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of different marketing strategies for the dissemination of a screening and brief alcohol intervention (SBI) programme to general practitioners (GPs). METHOD: Seven hundred and twenty-nine GPs, one per practice, from the former Northern and Yorkshire Regional Health Authority were {{randomly assigned to one of}} three <b>marketing</b> strategies: <b>postal</b> <b>marketing</b> (mailing a promotional brochure to GPs), telemarketing (following a script to market the programme over the telephone), and personal marketing (following the same script during face-to-face marketing at GPs' practices). GPs who took up the programme were asked if they would agree to use it. Outcome measures included the proportions of GPs who took up the programme and agreement to use it. RESULTS: Of the 614 GPs eligible for the study, 321 (52 %) took the programme. There was a significant difference in the proportions of GPs from the three marketing strategies who took the programme (82 % telemarketing, 68 % personal marketing, and 22 % <b>postal</b> <b>marketing).</b> Of the 315 GPs who took the programme and were eligible to use it, 128 (41 %) agreed to use the programme for three months. GPs in the <b>postal</b> <b>marketing</b> group were more likely to agree to use the programme (55 % <b>postal</b> <b>marketing,</b> 44 % personal marketing, and 34 % telemarketing). Personal marketing was the most effective overall dissemination strategy; however, economic analysis revealed that telemarketing was the most cost-effective strategy. Costs for dissemination per GP were: 13 Pounds telemarketing, 15 Pounds <b>postal</b> <b>marketing,</b> and 88 Pounds personal marketing. CONCLUSION: Telemarketing appeared to be the most cost-effective strategy for dissemination of SBI to GPs...|$|R

40|$|Market {{competition}} {{has been widely}} considered {{as one of the}} main determinants of business efficiency. This study evaluates this hypothesis for European postal operators. In particular, it takes advantage of the coexistence of various degrees of competition in national <b>postal</b> <b>markets</b> and the differences in regulations established among countries. For this purpose, a stochastic production frontier model is estimated, using a database of 17 European national postal operators. The results show that the degree of competition in domestic markets and the independence of national regulatory authorities are the main factors to explain the increase in efficiency in the postal sector. This reinforces the need for transposing the European regulatory framework into all national <b>postal</b> <b>markets</b> and opening them up to competition with no further delay. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractDuring {{the last}} years, the Greek <b>Postal</b> <b>Market</b> is facing {{considerable}} adversities {{due to the}} full liberalization of the <b>postal</b> <b>market</b> imposed by the European Commission, the economic crisis {{as well as the}} electronic substitution and its effects. Consequently, the long-term viability of Hellenic Post depends on whether the company will be able to encounter the increasing competition after the full <b>postal</b> <b>market</b> liberalization and the consumer turn to digital services and products. But isn’t this the case for all the European Posts? Have they started “dying” or do they move on to conform to the new customer needs? This paper shows that in order to obtain a viable development, Hellenic Post should focus on strategic innovation. In this new-formed environment, in spite of the challenges that Hellenic Post is facing, there are new significant opportunities that has to take advantage of. In order to have future prospects for market growth and profitability in the Greek <b>Postal</b> <b>Market,</b> Hellenic Post has to be converted in a modern company providing postal and electronic services aiming at customer new “digital” needs...|$|E

We show that the results are very sensitive to the operatorsÕ labor policies. Consequently, VAT exemptions have a different impact in countries with different labor regulations. The comprehensive treatment of competition and welfare enables us to provide guidance on how to resolve the policy trade-off between consumer surplus, government tax revenue, and a level playing field in liberalized <b>postal</b> <b>markets.</b> Value-added tax, indirect taxation, tax regulation, tax exemption, universal service obligation, postal sector...|$|R

Costs of postal sector are strictly connected with delivered volumes, so liberalisation can change into a great failure in those markets characterised by a small postal volume.

40|$|The new European Postal Directive of 2008 {{provides}} the <b>postal</b> <b>market</b> with new opportunities as {{it allows for}} the gradual development of competition of services of general interests in Europe.

Thus the European Commission is handling complaints about state aid which is granted to national postal services in order to facilitate their role as service of national interest. Much harder to challenge are a number of "de facto barriers" which fall outside competition law. Currently, the infringement procedure is the aggressive weapon against Member States contravening the Treaty. However, this procedure does not offer an overall solution to remove all trade barriers especially the "de facto barriers".

This is shown with the example of mobile market analysis, and empirical evidence is given that demonstrates the correctness of RegTP's analysis of an effectively competitive German mobile market.
