40|$|Populations of European {{starlings}} {{have declined}} over {{large parts of}} northern and western Europe during the last 20 years. It {{has been suggested that}} reduced availability <b>of</b> <b>pasture</b> in the agricultural landscape was one reason for this decline. To investigate this, breeding colonies for starlings were established in southern Sweden, in agricultural landscapes with different availabilities <b>of</b> <b>pasture.</b> Agricultural land-use was classified in a circular area of 500 m around each colony. Production of young per nest was positively related to the availability <b>of</b> <b>pasture</b> close to the breeding colony, not because the availability <b>of</b> <b>pasture</b> affected clutch size or hatchability of eggs, but because nestling survival was higher in colonies surrounded by pasture. The growth rate of an offspring feather character, but not offspring final mass or tarsus length, tended {{to be related to the}} availability <b>of</b> <b>pasture.</b> When availability <b>of</b> <b>pasture</b> was low, the variability of breeding success between years was high. Breeding density was also positively related to the availability <b>of</b> <b>pasture</b> near colonies. The combined trends in reproductive success and breeding density in this study support the contention that the reduction <b>of</b> <b>pasture</b> in modern agricultural landscape may be one reason why starling population size has declined...|$|R

Three rumen-fistulated Holstein Friesian cows {{were used for the}} in situ incubations and provided rumen liquor for in vitro incubations. The inclusion of YM in a control diet (pasture+pellets) affected some in sacco degradation parameters. YM supplementation decreased the effective degradability and degradation rate <b>of</b> <b>pasture</b> crude protein (CP), and it seems to slow down the degradation <b>of</b> <b>pasture</b> neutral detergent fiber. A significant increase <b>of</b> degradation <b>of</b> <b>pasture</b> acid detergent fiber (ADF) was detected after YM inclusion in the control diet. YM supplementation reduced in vitro gas production <b>of</b> <b>pasture</b> and ammonia concentration of pellets. The addition of YM in ruminant diet could decrease ammonia production and increase protein availability for productive purposes. The moderate presence of tannins in YM could have affected the degradation kinetics <b>of</b> <b>pasture</b> CP and ADF and the ammonia production of pellets...|$|R
40|$|The {{sustainable}} use <b>of</b> <b>pastures</b> is <b>of</b> fundamental importance, given that a considerable part <b>of</b> the Brazilian <b>pastures</b> {{may be in}} process of degradation or degraded (Andrade et al., 2016). In general, the use <b>of</b> <b>pastures</b> is characterized by extractivism, with few producers who invest in {{the recovery of the}} productive potential <b>of</b> <b>pastures</b> and adopting less impactful technologies to the environment. Thus, the intensification of pastoral production systems can be adopted as a viable option to minimize the pressure on opening new areas of agricultural production and reduce the emission of gases causing the greenhouse effect (Barcellos et al., 2008). However, identify areas <b>of</b> <b>pasture</b> that have low production potential {{can be one of the}} challenges for large-scale implementation of efficient government policies with the adoption of strategic mitigation measures.

40|$|Mato Grosso do Sul State {{has about}} 20 million {{hectares}} <b>of</b> <b>pastures</b> (SIGA-MS, 2016). From this total, close to four million hectares are natural grasslands in the Pantanal wetlands. The balance, or about 16 million hectares, are sown pastures.

It is a fact that the tame and cultivated grasses have an important place, yet in my estimation they will never replace the natural grasses, especially for resistance, and abundance of feed and on the rocky side hill or dry upland. My observations extended over the three <b>pasturing</b> seasons <b>of</b> 1903, 1904 and 1905, each year over the same group <b>of</b> <b>pastures.</b> These groups contained several thousand acres in each, taking in as many varieties <b>of</b> <b>pasture</b> as possible, and in this respect {{it would be hard to}} excel in any other part of the state.
