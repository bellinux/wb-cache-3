40|$|The {{potential}} use {{of waste}} cashew nut shell (CNS) ash {{as a source for}} potash production was investigated in this study. Managing waste ash generated from cashew nut processing is a major challenge, as land filling and open dumping of the waste ashes have been the main options in management of the ash in Nigeria. Economically viable ways of using waste ash rather than having to dispose of it have to be investigated. The CNS was air-dried for 4 weeks and combusted to ashes; the resulting ash was extracted with water for its <b>potash</b> <b>content.</b> Some parameters of the CNS, including moisture, dry matter, and ash content, were determined. Potash yield obtained was 33. 4 % of 150 g CNS ash used; analysis of the potash gave it a percentage purity of 78 %, while purity on recrystalization increased to 86 %. Potash yield from CNS ash was comparable to those reported for wood ash, plantain peels, and other agro-wastes.

40|$|Chessboard-twinned albite is {{abundant}} in some Franciscan metaconglomerates and associated metagraywackes in the Diablo Range of California. The chessboard albite occurs in pebbles of sedimentary rocks, felsic volcanic and plutonic pebbles, {{and in the}} graywacke matrix of the metaconglomerates, where it has probably formed during blueschist-facies metamorphism. The mode of occurrence of chessboard albite in felsic igneous pebbles suggests that this albite formed by replacement of potash feldspar (albitization); potassium released from the feldspar reacted with aluminous silicates to form white mica. Similarly, chessboard-twinned albite in Franciscan metagraywackes may also result from albitization of detrital potash feldspars. Thin-section examination of many Franciscan metagraywackes has revealed that chessboard albite is selectively distributed among pumpellyite- and lawsonitebearing rocks which now lack potash feldspars.

40|$|Abstract: This is {{the first}} {{detailed}} report of the well-developed leucocratic rocks, dominantly plagiogranites, from the Bela ophiolite, the most complete and largest ophiolitic outcrop of Pakistan. A wide range of leucocratic rock types occur within the ophiolite including leucogabbro, gabbroic pegmatite, diorite, quartz diorite, trondhjemite, epidote trondhjemite, granite, keratophyre and acidic pegmatite. Two suites of acidic leucocratic rocks are recognized: a very low potash and high soda suite containing magma-fractionated plagiogranite characteristic of most ophiolites, isaccompanied by an anatectic suite with higher <b>potash</b> <b>content.</b> Each suite possesses distinct trace element and rare earth contents, together with distinctly different Sr and Nd systematics. These differences indicate differences intectonic setting for each leucocratic suite. U-Pb isotopic measurements on zircons separated from the acidic rocks yield a crystallization age of 65 _+ 1 Ma for both the rock suites. On the basis of geochemical data a suprasubduction zone origin dominated by a marginal basin is proposed for the Bela ophiolite. The plagiogranitic rock suite could have been derived from basic magma by fractional crystallization. The potash-richer granitic rocks may have been generated by crustal anatexis forming amelt that locally invaded the ophiolite. Plagiogranites form conspicuous outcrops of relatively small dimensions in most ophiolites.

40|$|The aim of thiswork is to {{test the}} {{applicability}} and the protective effect of a sol–gel silica coating on potash–lime–silica glasses of low durability. Such glasses were applied during the Romanesque and Gothic periods for manufacturing stained glass objects still in situ at historic buildings such as cathedrals or smaller churches north of the Alps. Their high <b>potash</b> <b>content</b> and low silica amount led to a low chemical stability and to degradation processes on the glass surfaces; a protection is hence necessary {{for the conservation of}} those art objects. Two synthetic glasses with compositions close to the historical stained glass were used for the studies. The sol–gel coating does not alter the optical characteristics of the surface and is compatible with the substrate since its composition and chemical–physical properties are similar to the glass it is applied on. Moreover, it can be easily applied and does not require any heating treatments after the application. It is therefore particularly suitable for the application on cultural heritage objects. The effect of the sol–gel application was monitored and leaching tests with different times and pH values were performed both on coated and uncoated parts. The protective effect was verified using light microscopy and ToF–SIMS analyses were performed to check the ion migration (e. g. K, Na, Ca and Mg) and the interface between bulk glass and coating. The coating protects the glass from the formation of cracks also after severe treatments that would have caused serious damages on the uncoated glass...|$|E

The possibility to distinguish different geologic units, sedimentary and volcanic (acid and basic types) {{by means of the}} statistic analyses from the use of airborne gamma-ray spectrometry integrating potash radiation emissions data with geological and geochemistry data is discussed. This Project was carried out at 1973 by Geological Survey of Brazil/Companhia de Pesquisas de Recursos Minerais.

Essas experiências foram conduzidas entre os anos de 1943 e 1947, sendo duas em vasos, na Estação Experimental Central, Campinas, e oito no campo, em diferentes áreas de quatro localidades do Estado de São Paulo. Em média de tôdas as doses o efeito do potássio foi pequeno, tanto nas experiências em vasos como nas de campo. Na média destas a resposta máxima ao potássio, de + 10 %, foi obtida com a dose de 45 kg/ha de K 2 O. Em três delas, instaladas em solos bem providos de potássio, a adubação potássica não aumentou o produção. Nas outras cinco, algumas das quais instaladas em solos pobres de potássio, a resposta máxima também foi alcançada com a dose de 45 kg/ha, mas elevou-se, em média, a + 18 %, apesar de os "stands" terem sido seriamente prejudicados. As reduções sofridas pelos "stands" são atribuídas à escassez de chuvas no período imediato ao plantio e à aplicação das adubas nos sulcos destinados às batatas-semente, pouco antes da distribuição destas. Isso veio mostrar, mais uma vez, a necessidade de modificar o método de aplicação tradicionalmente usado em nosso meio.

The pot experiments were conducted in the Central Experiment Station, Campinas, and the field trials were located on different areas of four sites of the State of São Paulo. Averaging {{the results obtained}} with all the doses the responses to potash were small in both pot and field trials. In the average of the latter the maximum effect of potash, + 10 %, was obtained with about 45 kilograms of K 2 O per hectare.

40|$|Burning seaweed {{to produce}} kelp, valued for its high <b>potash</b> and soda <b>content,</b> was {{formerly}} a significant industry in remote coastal areas of Scotland and elsewhere. Given the {{high concentrations of}} arsenic in seaweeds, up to 100 mg kg− 1, this study investigates {{the possibility that the}} kelp industry caused arsenic contamination of these pristine environments. A series of laboratory-scale seaweed burning experiments was conducted, and analysis of the products using HPLC ICP-MS shows that at least 40 % of the arsenic originally in the seaweed could have been released into the fumes. The hypothesis that the burning process transforms arsenic from low toxicity arsenosugars in the original seaweeds (Fucus vesiculosus and Laminaria digitata) to highly toxic inorganic forms, predominantly arsenate, is consistent with As speciation analysis results. A field study conducted on Westray, Orkney, once a major centre for kelp production, shows that elevated arsenic levels (10. 7 ± 3. 0 mg kg− 1, compared to background levels of 1. 7 ± 0. 2 mg kg− 1) persist in soils in the immediate vicinity of the kelp burning pits. A model combining results from the burning experiments with data from historical records demonstrates the potential for arsenic deposition of 47 g ha− 1 year− 1 on land adjacent to the main kelp burning location on Westray, and for arsenic concentrations exceeding current UK soil guideline values during the 50 year period of peak kelp production...|$|R

Four common plant species (Elaeis guineensis, Cocos nucifera, Carica papaya and Musa paradisiaca) were investigated. Freshly harvested parts of these species were weighed, dried and burnt to ash. The ash samples were subjected to metal analysis by Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry (AAS) first as raw ash (5 g of sieved ash for each sample), then as ash leachate (10 mL each). Potash was determined for each sample by evaporating the ash leachate at 60 °C with subsequent drying at 110 °C. E. guineensis fruit bunch recorded the highest ash value of 5. 65 kg while the least value of 0. 76 kg was observed in M. paradisiaca. <b>Potash</b> <b>content</b> increased from 30. 67 % in E. guineensis frond to 53. 47 % in M. paradisiaca.

40|$|An {{account is}} given of the {{taxonomy}} {{and distribution of}} Macrocystis in Australian waters, {{the development of the}} plant is outlined, and beds on the east coast of Tasmania are described. Measurements of growth indicate that the most rapid elongation of the stipe takes place near the apex, and that a stipe may increase in length a t a rate of a t least 3. 4 cm per day. The life of a stipe is estimated a t between 7 and 10 months. Experiments show that the apical blade with a portion of the stipe may sometimes continue growth when severed from the holdfast. I t is found that decrease in length of a blade caused by decay of tissue a t the apex is for a time made good by meristematic activity near the base of the blade, but that finally meristematic activity ceases and decay eventually removes the whole blade. Harvesting of Macrocystis pyrifera (L.) Ag. in selected areas over 2 yr gave no indication that beds are adversely affected by cutting the stipes 3 ft. below the surface a t approximately 4 -monthly intervals. The average yield obtained in three localities over 2 yr was 4 tons/ac, and on this basis the area surveyed could be expected to yield approximately 355, 000 tons of wet weed or 35, 000 - 44, 000 tons of air-dried weed per year.

40|$|The Soufriandegrave;re region, which {{includes}} the most recently active volcanic centre {{on the island of}} St. andnbsp;Lucia in the West Indies, is the site of a relatively recent volcanic caldera. This structure, with a diameter of approximately 4 miles, has an age of definitely more than 50, 000 years and probably of several times this age. Apart from continuous solfataric activity, there have been no historic eruptions, and the morphology of the caldera has been considerably modified by erosion since the time of its formation. The history of volcanic events in the Soufriandegrave;re region may be divided into four principal phases: the first involved the effusion of basalt lava from vents both within and to the east of the site of the ultimate caldera. During the second phase, following what was probably a long time-interval, a group of andesitic strato-volcanoes developed in an area slightly to the northeast of the ultimate caldera. These emitted andesite flows and, apparently, a very large volume (estimated a 6 cubic miles) of pyroclastic material, probably mainly as glowing avalanches. The third phase opened with the emission of andesite pumice fall and pumice flow from a vent which probably lay within the ultimate caldera. After an erosion interval, activity was renewed on a more violent scale, in a series of ultravulcanian explosions, and these were followed by a second period of voluminous, andesite pumice flows which immediately preceded caldera subsidence. The fourth and final phase has occupied the relatively long period since collapse, during which fifteen volcanic domes and seven craters have developed within the caldera: initially of andesitic composition, around the margin of the caldera, and subsequently of dacite lava, towards the centre of the collapsed area. The effusion of these lavas was accompanied by pyroclastic eruptions of pumice fall (with an estimated volume of 1. 23 cu. miles) and pumice flows (with an estimated volume of 0. 27 cu. mile). The youngest large pumice flow, dated by the radiocarbon method, occurred 39, 050 years ago. The mineralogy of the St. andnbsp;Lucian lavas compares closely with that of typical, calcium-rich, island-arc suites. All rocks contain calcic plagioclase phenocrysts, the cores of which generally consist of bytownite while the rims, especially in the andesites and dacites, include oscillatory zones in which the calcium content commonly decreases to a minimum of about An 40. The mafic minerals in the basalts include augitic clinopyroxene, with or without orthopyroxene and olivine, whilst in the andesites, orthopyroxene (hypersthene or ferrohypersthene) predominates. The dacites are characterized by amphibole (common hornblende, oxyhornblende, or cummingtonite) and biotite, with subordinate orthopyroxene and occasional olivine phenocrysts, accompanied by 5 andndash; 15 % of large, rounded or bipyramidal phenocrysts of quartz. The youngest dacites of the Soufriandegrave;re region are unusual in that they contain phenocrysts of calcium-poor, cummingtonitic amphibole. Twenty new analyses of whole rocks from St. andnbsp;Lucia are presented, and these extend over a silica range from 50 % in the earliest to 66 % in the most recent products. The suite is relatively rich in alumina (15 andndash; 19 %) and poor in alkalis (Na 2 O up to 3. 5 % K 2 O up to 1. 5 %), although by West Indian standards the <b>potash</b> <b>content</b> is high. The rocks as a whole are members of the calc-alkaline, "Pacific" series, characteristic of mobile structural belts. The silica variation diagram for St. andnbsp;Lucia illustrates the compositional heterogeneity of the basalts, and the gap (from 53 andndash; 59 %) in silica content, which also corresponds to the gap in time between the eruption of the basalts (phase 1) and the andesites (phase 2). The andesites, on the other hand, appear to be closely related to the dacites, forming a single, continuous series. A comparison of the Feandnbsp;: Mgandnbsp;: Na+K ratios reveals the close chemical similarity of the andesites and dacites of St. andnbsp;Lucia to those of Crater Lake, Oregon, and to the "hypersthenic" series of Hakone volcano, Japan. The Caandnbsp;: Naandnbsp;: K ratios show that the rocks of St. andnbsp;Lucia contain a higher proportion of potash relative to soda and lime than most other suites of the orogenic regions. The distribution of the minor elements in ten rocks from St. andnbsp;Lucia conforms closely to that found in other West Indian and orogenic volcanic suites, with the notable exception of rubidium, which is much more abundant in the acid rocks of St. andnbsp;Lucia than in those of other suites from the Lesser Antilles. A co-variance plot of seven minor elements in the analysed samples from St. andnbsp;Lucia provides an arrangement of specimens along the abscissa which is closely parallel to the order according to silica content, and this in turn corresponds to the chronologic sequence of eruption. The basalts of St. andnbsp;Lucia are believed to have crystallized from essentially unmodified, primary magma. The occurrence in the Soufriandegrave;re region of two basalt varieties, namely porphyritic and aphyric, is explicable either {{as the result of the}} accumulation at depth of plagioclase felspar crystals, or alternatively may be attributed to the independent development two primary magmas, of tholeiitic and alumina-rich types. There is no support in the Soufriandegrave;re region for differentiation of basalt, or assimilation by primary basalt magma, on a sufficiently extensive scale to produce the observed volume and sequence of the more acid lavas. It is, therefore, proposed that the andesites and dacites of St. andnbsp;Lucia were derived largely by partial melting of local crustal material. </p...|$|E
40|$|The major gneissic {{metasediment}} {{within the}} Grenville {{series of the}} northwest Adirondacks extends northeastward across the Grenville Lowlands for about 35 miles, though areas of different degrees of metamorphism and igneous intrusion. Within this region, the gneiss is interpreted to be grossly monoclinal, but overturned to form the southeast flank of a regional anticlinorium. The opposite flank of this structure probably lies just northwest of the St. Lawrence River in the Brockville-Mallorytown-Kingston areas, Ontario. The gneiss is interstratified with thick zones of siliceous magnesian marble, thin quartzites, and schists. Two siliceous marble zones stratigraphically below the gneiss have a total thickness of about 8000 feet. A siliceous dolomite zone immediately above the gneiss (southeast of it) is at least 4000 feet thick and, with an overlying feldspathic quartzite, adjoins the central Adirondack igneous-rich massif. The gneiss itself is about 3000 feet thick and, except for thin interlayers of amphibolite and marble, the layers interpreted as relict beds are monotonous in texture and composition. These least-altered layers of gneiss are granoblastic, faintly foliated, quartz-greenish biotite-oligoclase gneiss in which the ratio of Na 2 O/K 2 O is approximately 1. 3 : 1. Consequently the rock is far more sodic than typical shales. Layers of this composition are widely although sporadically distributed through the complex, and are injected lit-par-lit, replaced by and transitional into biotitic quartz-microcline-oligoclase granite, pegmatite, and alaskitic granite. Variants from these fades include garnetiferous and sillimanitic gneiss and migmatite, and tourmaline-bearing pegmatites. The simple assemblage quartz-greenish biotite-oligoclase, found principally in those areas farthest from large bodies of igneous granite, undoubtedly represents not only the least-altered metasediment but moreover the lowest-rank metamorphic facies into which the parent sediment is reconstituted. This rock type is abundant northwest of Hyatt, New York, in that segment of the gneiss farthest from the central Adirondack igneous complex. The alteration of the gneiss into various rock types reflecting increasing degree or rank of metamorphism as well as increasing interaction with magmatic fluids may be observed as the gneiss is traced northeastward toward Edwards, New York, which lies adjacent to the igneous massif. Alteration of the quartz-greenish biotite-oligoclase gneiss by granitic fluids commonly is accompanied by successive and marked decreases in biotite and in both the amount of plagioclase and in the per cent anorthite molecule of the plagioclase, {{as well as by}} a decrease in quartz content. Marked increases in <b>potash</b> feldspar <b>content,</b> particularly, serve as a useful index against which other mineralogical and textural changes may be plotted. As these changes appear in the gneiss, the greenish-brown biotite commonly gives way to a reddish-brown, probably more magnesian and titaniferous variety. A corollary to these successive mineralogical changes of gneiss toward granitic types are the chemical modifications involving, especially, a diminution in total iron, lime, and magnesia, and an increase in alkalis, particularly K 2 O, which becomes dominant over Na 2 O in many granitized facies. Intermediate types of this alkali-rich, potassic derivative of the gneiss most nearly approximate the composition of well-sorted shales and are possibly those considered by some earlier workers as representative of the sedimentary parent. Textural changes include the development not only of migmatite, pegmatite, and equigranular granite, but also of widespread augen gneisses and “porphyritic” granite, both of which contain large porphyroblasts and possibly some phenocrysts, chiefly microcline. The processes of injection and granitization seem to involve both magma and fluids from magma, which permeated the gneiss, interacting with and replacing it. Where the interaction of granitic fluids and gneisses occurred near, along, and in the central igneous-rich complex of the Adirondacks, in an environment of higher temperatures, the reddish-brown biotite appears almost or quite to the exclusion of greenish varieties. In addition, almandite garnet and sillimanite are formed, in that order, as products of the interaction. Almandite and some orthoclase also have formed as new phases presumably reflecting increasing rank of regional metamorphism without significant chemical modification of the parent sediment. Some of the earliest magmatic fluids appear to have included iron-rich derivatives, which by metasomatism formed scattered ferriferous biotite and hornblendic layers in and along the gneiss. These are largely granitized by the subsequent and dominant incursions of potassic, low-iron magma and associated fluids. Considerations of volume relations, compositional features, and paragenesis in the gneiss complex indicate that the potash in the “injecting” fluids had its source outside the gneiss; that is, it could not have been derived from the gneiss itself by secondary leaching, differential anatexis, or related processes. Nor seemingly could the relatively high soda content of the least-altered gneiss represent an earlier, but secondary, inoculation of the gneiss or parent sediment after diagenesis. Accordingly, the soda to potash ratio which approaches 1. 3 : 1 in the quartz-biotite-oligoclase layers is regarded as either inherent in the sedimentary particles, or added essentially at the interface of sedimentation. If the composition of the quartz-biotite-oligoclase gneiss near Hyatt was inherent in the clastic particles deposited in Grenville seas, graywacke type sediments or tuffs are the most logical parent rocks. If soda was added to the clastic particles at the interface of deposition, or penecontemporaneously, the pre-existing sediment may {{have been one of the}} more common clay-weathering products. Unfortunately neither alternative is particularly compelling or more readily demonstrated than the others. The seemingly intimate and concordant intercalation of the gneiss with thick marbles and pure quartzites suggests that the gneiss was derived from shales or argillaceous sandstones which were products of marked residual weathering and good sorting. Graywackes, on the other hand, are presumed to imply a minimum of chemical weathering with rapid erosion, transportation, and deposition in an unstable crustal environment. Thick, monotonous tuffs are as anomalous within this Grenville association of sediments as are graywackes and hardly represent a logical parent to the gneiss. To assume soda-rich clays as the parent sediment poses problems equally great. The uniform addition of soda to great volumes of the commoner clayey products of residual weathering is almost unknown as a normal marine process. Commonly potash, rather than soda, is added to the accumulating clays, forming illitic shales. In addition to potash, both calcium and magnesium have greater replacing power than sodium and thus would replace it in requisite marine environments. The principal justification for assuming that soda could have been added to Grenville clays lies in indications that parts of the Grenville seas were, periodically at least, abnormally saline and soda rich. The great thickness of the carbonate sequence, its content of magnesia, silica, anhydrite, and halite indicate this, although most or all of these substances except the silica could be of secondary origin. If seas of abnormal salinity were involved, several possibilities suggest themselves. Some water-laid tuffs, altered tuffs, and clays are known to alter to zeolites and zeolitelike minerals. Thus, clinoptilolite, analcime, and apophyllite with more or less admixed clay are found as marine beds evolved through interaction of tuffaceous material and saline water. Some zeolites even form in open seas. The zeolitic rocks occur as both intermediate and end-stage products in the weathering of tuffs and probably of other rocks and form widespread uniform beds. As such they suggest a possible parent to the gneiss. Another alternative is that during sedimentation sodic shales are formed, by base exchange, from clay products of marked residual weathering. Base exchange of this type is credible if the seas were abnormally warm, rich in soda, and depleted in other bases which have greater energies of exchange than soda. In this environment, common clay minerals such as montmorillonite are known to take up soda in exchange for a previously held base, especially calcium, magnesium, or hydrogen. Lateral extensions of the Adirondack type gneiss should appear in the near-by parts of Canada where most gneisses in the Grenville series are described as “normal shales. ” It is hardly reasonable to infer that the lateral transition from a sodic to potassic sediment coincides with the international boundary. The data, though fragmentary, suggest that gneiss of the Adirondack type occurs in the Brockville-Mallorytown-Kingston areas and possibly for many miles beyond. Along and northeast of the Ottawa River, however, most gneisses described to date appear to represent derivatives of more normal shales or argillaceous sandstones. Accordingly the Adirondack gneiss may be inferred to pinch out to the northeast or grade laterally into metasediment probably derived from much less sodic parent elastics. In the northern and northeastern parts of the subprovince, however, paragneisses which seem to approach the Adirondack type are reported in numerous areas.
